# Cycling for a cause
## Stanford graduate bikes to support AIDS 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial Staff 
On the morning of June 2, when most
Stanford students are winding down their
spring quarters in anticipation of Dead Week,
Scott Stocker will just be gearing up for a big
adventure.
Stocker, a Stanford alumnus and the in
formation technology manager for Overseas
Studies, will participate in a week-long bike
ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles de
signed to raise money and awareness for
AIDS. On June 2, the first and longest day,
Stocker will ride 94 miles.
"I'd been looking for a personal challenge
to do over the summer," said Stocker, who
graduated in 1990. "I felt like I needed some
thing service-related, beyond myself, some
thing outside of work, something to motivate
me to evaluate where I am in life."
The challenge of the California AIDS Ride
corresponded with his new interest in cy
cling, Stocker said. "I just took up cycling re
cently, in the beginning of March. I have an
uncle who's in his 80s who cycles about 200
miles a week. My brother-in-law races, so
they convinced me to take up cycling."
In a local bike shop, Stocker saw a sign for
the California AIDS Ride, which was estab
lished three years ago. Stocker is one of sev
eral members of the Stanford community
who will participate in the ride, although he
said he does not know any of the other partic
ipants and became involved with the ride on
his own.

tion Technology Manager Scott Stocker will bike
from San Francisco to Los Angeles as part of the
California AIDS Ride in June.
"I was looking for [a way] to
get more into the sport," said
Stocker. He called the number on
the sign at the bike shop and at
tended an orientation session.
Stocker said that so far, he has
not been disappointed by the
high expectations he developed
at the orientation: In addition to
providing support for a social
cause Stocker considers impor
tant, practicing for the ride has
enhanced both Stocker's social
life and his physical fitness.
"Through this, I've been able
to meet a lot of cyclists," said
Stocker. "I've been able to get in
volved in a cycling community."
Stocker said he spends his
weekends going on "training
rides," which are day-long rides
ranging in length from 60 to 80
miles. The training rides, Stock
er said, "are various loops from
around here, over Skyline, to the
ocean and back. One thing I've
heard from people who did the
ride last year is that Bay Area rid
ers tend to be more prepared for
the hilly parts of the ride."
The training rides entail more
than just huffing and puffing up
hills, Stocker said. "I've made
good friends through the train
ing rides. You meet people going
about your same pace, and you
talk to them, except for the times

you're going up a really long as
cent and are completely out of
breath."
Participants in the ride come
from all segments of the popula
tion, Stocker said. "There are a
number of retirees, mothers,
people touched by the AIDS epi
demic. There's a large proportion
of gay men, but there's also a fa
ther and his 17-year-old son.
There are a lot of lesbians. While
the | AIDS] epidemic has primari
ly struck the gay male communi
ty, the lesbian community has
been very supportive of the cause
— it really is one community."
As a gay man, Stocker said he
values the chance to do some
thing positive about AIDS. "I
think this is a really wonderful
opportunity to give something
back to the gay community,
which I'm a part of and which has
been especially devastated by
this disease."
Stocker and 2,000 other rid
ers will "give back" in the form of
$6 million. Each cyclist must
raise a minimum of $2,500 to be
eligible to participate in the ride.
Donors make flat pledges rather
than making pledges on a per
mile basis, in part because it is
expected that each cyclist will
complete the entire ride. Every
night at dark, vans will collect
riders who might have fallen too
far behind and bring them to the
camp sites.
The ride is not a race, Stocker
said, and, in fact, the riders will all

complete the ride at the same time.
"On the last day, when we ar
rive in L.A. for the closing cere
monies, we stop in West Holly
wood and wait for everyone to
finish, and everyone rides in, in a
procession."
Such a large contingent of cy
clists raises awareness of AIDS
both at the conclusion of the ride
and along the way, Stocker said.
"We go through a lot of small
communities on the ride. One
place they went through last
year, [the townspeople] lined the
main road with red ribbons, and
all the students and families were
out cheering and clapping."
Stocker said he attributes
much of the success of the ride to
the event's organizers. "I've
done some [other] fund-raising
events, like an AIDS walk. This is
by far the best organized event
like this I've ever participated in.
There's a huge crew of volun
teers."
As the date of the ride draws
closer, Stocker said he is looking
forward to it, despite the obvious
physical discomforts the journey
will present. "The days are going
to be very challenging, but I feel
ready for this," he said.

Although Stocker has met the
minimum amount required to
participate in the ride, he wel
comes pledges until May 31. He
can be contacted by e-mail at
stocker(a)leland.stanford.edu or
