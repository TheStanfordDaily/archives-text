# Cycling for a cause
## Stanford graduate bikes to support AIDS 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial Staff 
On the morning of June 2, when most
Stanford students are winding down their
spring quarters in anticipation of Dead Week,
Scott Stocker will just be gearing up for a big
adventure.
Stocker, a Stanford alumnus and the in
formation technology manager for Overseas
Studies, will participate in a week-long bike
ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles de
signed to raise money and awareness for
AIDS. On June 2, the first and longest day,
Stocker will ride 94 miles.
"I'd been looking for a personal challenge
to do over the summer," said Stocker, who
graduated in 1990. "I felt like I needed some
thing service-related, beyond myself, some
thing outside of work, something to motivate
me to evaluate where I am in life."
The challenge of the California AIDS Ride
corresponded with his new interest in cy
cling, Stocker said. "I just took up cycling re
cently, in the beginning of March. I have an
uncle who's in his 80s who cycles about 200
miles a week. My brother-in-law races, so
they convinced me to take up cycling."
In a local bike shop, Stocker saw a sign for
the California AIDS Ride, which was estab
lished three years ago. Stocker is one of sev
eral members of the Stanford community
who will participate in the ride, although he
said he does not know any of the other partic
ipants and became involved with the ride on
his own.
