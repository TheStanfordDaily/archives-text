# Ugly Man contest nets $1,200
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Stanford's ugliest man has never before raised so
much money for charity.
This year's Ugly Man on Campus contest raised
more than four times the amount of the last contest in
May 1994. The fund-raiser is sponsored by the nation
al service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega.
All of the $1,243.56 raised this year by the 13 can
didates who ran for Ugly Man on Campus will go to the
Children's Wish Foundation — Alpha Phi Omega's
national target charity this year — a not-for-profit
group that grants wishes to children under age 18 with
life threatening illnesses.
Residences and other campus groups nominated 12

men and one woman to be the Ugly Man(ifestation) on
Campus. Votes were held in White Plaza from Monday
to Thursday, and the candidate with the most votes —
the most money in his or her jar — was the winner.
"I didn't know embarrassment could be that fun,"
said senior T akashi Terada, who was part of the "beau
ty pageant," or "ugly pageant," held Tuesday in White
Plaza. Terada came out the No. 1 candidate — the ugli
est man on campus — raising a total of $241.74 during
the week. He was sponsored by his dormitory, Soto
House.
"I'm not sure if it's an honor or a dishonor," Ter
ada joked, "[but] the fact that they raised over
$1,200 is really awesome, and I'm glad to have been
a part of that."
As the winner, Terada will have
the option of a pizza party with 20
of his supporters at Pizza A Go Go,
or a truckload of ice cream with all
the toppings for himself and 40 of
his supporters.
Senior Rob Swierk, who orga
nised this year's contest, said he
had originally expected to raise
about $500.
"I was really impressed by how

enthused dorms and organizations
got about the contest," Swierk said,
adding as one example that he was
surprised to receive a bag full of
money collected by Soto at a house
meeting the night before, which al
most knocked over the table with
its weight.
Swierk said the purpose of the
contest was twofold: to "raise
money for a very worthwhile chari
ty" and "to raise Alphi Phi
Omega's visibility on campus and
let people know that we not only do
service, but we have a lot of fun
doing it. ... 1 think we succeeded
with both of those [goals]."

Besides contributions from
dorms, door-to-door collections in
the form of spare change constitut
ed a significant portion of the
funds. According the Swierk, the
final tally of pennies alone came
out to over 14,000.
Sophomore Greg Francis, who
came in third place with a total of
$182.22, said he wanted to use this
as "an opportunity to make people
aware of the kind of injustices di
rected to ugly people."
He added, "I want to thank my
parents, grandparents and great
grandparents for [enablingl me to
be this ugly and to win this title."
