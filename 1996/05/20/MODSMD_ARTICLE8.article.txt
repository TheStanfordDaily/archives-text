# Ticket calls for a clean break
## Shen, Thompson want ASSU to do business differently 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
A new era, a new agenda, a new vision.
The ASSU presidential ticket consisting of sopho
more Bill Shen and junior Nick Thompson want a
change from the past.
"This is a new year," Shen said. "Everything is on
the table. The old way of doing business is out, is
dead."
Shen and Thompson are running as president and
vice president respectively in the special election to be
held Wednesday and Thursday.
Thompson, who has held a number of positions
with student publications and is currently the presi
dent of the California chapter of the Student Environ
mental Action Coalition, and Shen, this year's deputy
senate chair, characterize themselves as the "ultimate
outsider" and "ultimate insider."

Shen said this diversity would bring great benefits
to students.
"This is a clean break from the old way of doing
business," he said. "We didn't want to offer the same
old, boring regurgitated ideas. We don't want to make
promises we can't keep."
Shen originally ran as part of the"For Real" Coun
cil of Presidents slate, which was defeated by the"I
Prefer a Single President" slate in this spring's gener
al election.
The defeat and Shen's new running mate for this
election made him rethink his ideas of how to run a
campaign, Shen said.
"It forced me to step back and re-examine what my
concept of running for the ASSU meant," he said.
Thompson and Shen detailed a platform of several
ideas — changing the campaign process, reforming the
distribution requirement system
and maintaining more institution
al memory within the ASSU —
which they felt would be fresh to
students' ears.
The spring general election
campaigns are just one example of
student dissatisfaction with the
ASSU, said Shen, citing the
amount of fliers and paper pro
duced by the campaigns.
"There are very few ideas in the
midst of all that paper," he said. "If
we expect to have a more credible,
respected ASSU, then we have to
expect to elect more than catchy
slogans."
If elected, the ticket would en
courage use of the World Wide Web
and get rid of the elections hand

books, according to Shen.
In the area of academic reform,
the ticket would like to "broaden the
scope of what it means to get an ed
ucation," according to Thompson.
The ticket supports giving stu
dents academic credit for commu
nity service or broadening the ways
in which students can fulfill DRs.
In addition, the ticket hopes to
make the University more socially
responsible, through the creation
of an alumni endowment fund
which will invest money in places
such as needy East Palo Alto orga
nizations.
"We'd like to change the concept
of alumni giving," Thompson said.
Above all, the ticket would like
to be student advocates, Shen said.
"Next year has to be more grass
roots," he said. "We're going to
pick a few issues to bring to the stu
dents. We want to get students a
little informed and opinionated."
