can we hire?
Well, we've already hired 40 and we're looking for more grads with
solid academic records and excellent presentation skills. Why?
We're growing! Score! Learning Corporation has merged with the
Washington Post Company and Kaplan Educational Center
(the test prep folks) to become Score@Kaplan.
Together, we are ready to go national immediately!
With new centers opening in Los Angeles, New York and Boston,
we need top graduates to lead this explosive growth. At
Score@Kaplan, you can help change the face of education as you
learn practical business skills firsthand.
If you have a heart for kids, keen business acumen, and the
ability to hang with one of the nation's fastest-growing
educational companies, give us a call or stop by our
information session on Tuesday.
