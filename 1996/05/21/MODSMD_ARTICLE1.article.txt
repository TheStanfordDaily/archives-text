# Election mistake
## Senate must OK presidential vote 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
The stage is
set. The actors
are in place. The
preparations
have been made.
But one problem
remains: For the

moment, there is no show.
The student body is supposed to
go to the polls tomorrow to elect the
first single ASSU president in ill
most 30 years.
Unfortunately, due to an over
sight of the ASSU Senate, unless ac
tion is taken at tonight's senate
meeting, no such election can con
stitutionally be held.
But never fear. That action will
be taken and there will be a presi
dential election, Senate Chair Alane
Murdock said last night.
At its April 30 meeting, the sen
ate ordered a special election to be
held tomorrow and Thursday for
members of the graduate student
council which, due to a similar over
sight, were not elected during the
spring general election.
The bill authorized Elections
Commissioner Ryan Medders to so
licit declarations of intent from can
didates for president and vice presi
dent, but stated that the availability
of those positions was "contingent
upon certification of the spring
quarter general election and ratifi
cation of the association's new con
stitution." The bill hence refrained
from placing the presidential vote
on the May ballot.
The necessary final verification
of election results and ratification of
"Constitution '96" occurred at last
