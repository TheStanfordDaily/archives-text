# Election mistake
## Senate must OK presidential vote 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
The stage is
set. The actors
are in place. The
preparations
have been made.
But one problem
remains: For the

moment, there is no show.
The student body is supposed to
go to the polls tomorrow to elect the
first single ASSU president in ill
most 30 years.
Unfortunately, due to an over
sight of the ASSU Senate, unless ac
tion is taken at tonight's senate
meeting, no such election can con
stitutionally be held.
But never fear. That action will
be taken and there will be a presi
dential election, Senate Chair Alane
Murdock said last night.
At its April 30 meeting, the sen
ate ordered a special election to be
held tomorrow and Thursday for
members of the graduate student
council which, due to a similar over
sight, were not elected during the
spring general election.
The bill authorized Elections
Commissioner Ryan Medders to so
licit declarations of intent from can
didates for president and vice presi
dent, but stated that the availability
of those positions was "contingent
upon certification of the spring
quarter general election and ratifi
cation of the association's new con
stitution." The bill hence refrained
from placing the presidential vote
on the May ballot.
The necessary final verification
of election results and ratification of
"Constitution '96" occurred at last

Tuesday's senate meeting, but the
senate failed to officially call for a
presidential election at that time.
"I think all of the leadership as
sumed that it was taken care of in
that bill," Murdock said.
Medders, acting under the au
thority granted to him by the April
30 bill, has spent the last few weeks
preparing for the special election,
collecting declarations of intent and
publishing a special election hand
book on the World Wide Web. With
out senate authorization, however,
candidates' names will not appear on
this week's ballot.
Graduate senator Sandeep Sing
hal, author of the April 30 bill, said
he saw no cause for alarm, noting
that the senate could still act at its
meeting tonight to allow the election
to go on as scheduled.
"Given that this is for the presi
dency and vice presidency, there
shouldn't be a problem," Singhal
said.
Singhal added that the oversight
is not an attempt to delay or derail
the process, and that the sense of the
senate is that the election should
take place this week.
"Someone just dropped the belli,"
he said.
The senate, however, has an addi

tional obstacle to overcome at this
evening's meeting — time. At 11:59
p.m., "Constitution '96" officially
takes effect and the grand carriage of
the senate will turn back into a
pumpkin and the Council of Presi
dents will again become mice. The
official time for transition set in the
ratification documents passed last
week serves as the final deadline for
any action by this year's senate.
Unfortunately, there are a num
l>er of other items on the agenda be
sides theelection, although Murdock
said the presidential election creation
will be first on the agenda. The sen
ate is also set to consider the ASSU's
1996-97 budget, spring allocations,
bylaw modifications, Nominations
Commission appointments of stu
dents to University committees, real
location of graduate senate seats and
a resolution supporting University
funding of the Women's Center.
If the senate fails to take action on
an item, it will be deferred to the new
senate, which will meet for the first
time one week from today.
Leaving the new, inexperienced
senate with such weighty issues is
inexcusable for some ASSU leaders.
"It is important that the ASSU
not ignore such obvious responsibil
ities as these. We spend too much
time airing our petty, personal and
partisan differences and not enough
time on our most important respon
sibilities," said COP member Jon
Oram.
