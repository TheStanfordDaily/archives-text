# 'People were so angry. All they wanted to do was have revenge. I chose not to.'
## Recalling life in Auschwitz — and after 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
She may have lived through
Auschwitz, but Edith Eva Eger re
fuses to call herself a survivor.
The clinical psychologist, a
dancer in her spare time, shared
her profound views on life and
therapy as a guest lecturer in
Prof. Philip Zimbardo's Psycholo
gy 1 class yesterday.
"In psychotherapy, I teach peo
ple and guide them from their vic
timization to being empowered. I
don't like the word 'survivor.' I
am looking for a better word.
Something like 'prevail' or
'thrive,' " said Eger.
Taken from home in 1944 at
the age of 16, Eger was placed in a
cattle cart and transported to the
Nazi concentration camp in
Poland with family members. Life
and death were determined by the
wave of a single Nazi doctor's
hand.
" I looked outside and there was
fire coming out of the chimney. I
asked the girl who had just torn
my earrings out, 'When can I see
my mother?' " Eger said. "And

she said, 'She's burning there.
You'd better talk about her in past
tense.' So my sister and I huddled
and she said to me, 'The soul never
dies. The soul never dies.' "
Eger reflected on how the Nazis
took samples of her blood twice a
week. Of Hungarian descent, she
spoke German and occasionally
talked to the guards. When asked
what the samples were for, the of
ficer taking the blood replied that
they were going to the German
war effort.
"I remember today verbatim
what I said to myself," Eger said.
" 'I [am] a pacifist. I've never
harmed anyone in my life. I bet
with my blood you'll never win the
war.' And maybe that's why they
didn't win the war."
During her year in captivity,
she "created a world inside" her
self in order to maintain a hold on
life. "It was a wonderful skill to re
treat and find a world inside that
nothing could rob me from. And I
talked to myself every day. I want
ed to live desperately," she said.
American soldiers in the 71st
infantry liberated Auschwitz on
May 4, 1945, and for many years,

Eger lived in denial of her concen
tration camp experience. Upon
immigratingto the United States,
she vowed not to be different from
any other immigrant. Difference
had rarely been a good thing in
her past experience.
It was not until 40 years later
that she returned to Auschwitz to
confront her past trauma. "You
have your secret and then some
how your secret will have you. I
will never forget my experience in
the concentration camp, but I
don't live there," said Eger.
Much of Eger's "post-mortem"
healing process — as she calls the
transition she has gone through
since her liberation — has dealt
with the issue of forgiveness, as
well as feelings of guilt and shame
surrounding her survival.
After her liberation, she talked
to herself again when she was
hospitalized to recuperate from
her experience. She resolved that
she couldn't "live with hate."
"Deep down, with myself, I for
gave. But I did not tell anyone, be
cause I would have been clob
bered," said Eger. "People were so
angry. All they wanted to do was

have revenge. I chose not to."
Instead she chose to be as posi
tive as possible. "Sometimes the
most tragic events become the
best experiences in one's life,"
said Eger. "I have become a much
more compassionate and less
judgmental human being."
Eger made it clear that she
does not think the world owes
her anything, a mentality which
she feels belongs to victims.
"That entitlement gives me the
license to do nothing," she said.
"It's OK to feel sorry for your
self, but then the magic word
comes: 'Next?' "
Eger said she has "committed
herself to peace so that my chil
dren and grandchildren will never
experience what I did." She ex
pressed concern about the current
abundance of right-wing militia
groups in the United States.
"Today there are militant
militia in America. . . that believe
Hitler was and is a saint and that
hejust didn't finish the job," Eger
said. "And they're going to do it
here in America. This is America
1996. . . . Our biggest enemy is ig
norance."
