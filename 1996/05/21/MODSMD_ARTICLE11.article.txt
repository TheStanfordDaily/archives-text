Ten students received the Boothe Prize for
Excellence in Writing for their outstanding es
says written in the Cultures, Ideas and Values
and Writing and Critical Thinking programs at
a reception at the Faculty Club last week.
The prize was first awarded in 1983 in
honor of Catie and D. Power Boothe, Jr., Class
of'3l.
The recognized students said they felt flat
tered and encouraged in their writing.
At Stanford, "sometimes writing gets ig
nored in favor of the sciences," said winner
Steven Perez. "The Boothes have contributed
to Stanford by recognizing achievements in
writing."
Opening remarks were made by Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven. Students and their essay topics were
introduced by History Prof. Paul Seaver, direc
tor of the CIV program, and English Prof. Ken
Fields, director of the Writing and Critical
Thinking program.
Within the CIV program, the award-win
ning essayists included Jennifer Kao, who

wrote "The Riddle of Identity in 'A Dream of
Passion' and 'Season of Migration to the
North,' " Rajani Rajan for "Unhappy Dido and
the Female Ethic in the 'Aeneid' " and Brad
Anderson for "Playing at Power: The Appara
tus of the State in 'The Tempest' and 'The
Prince.' "
Honorable mentions were given to Lucy
Stark for her essay "Induction and Falsifica
tion in Science," to Perez for his "Intimations
of Individuality" and to Ann Karash for "Pas
sage: Towards Redefinition of the Self and Re
construction of World Order."
Boothe prizes were given in Writing and
Critical Thinking to Yi-An Chen for "Para
chute Kid — Is It a Safe Landing?," Susan
Landsittel for "Fine" and Andrew Chiang for
"Glass Ceilings and Painted Mirrors: Asian-
American Stereotypes and Exclusion From
American Television and Movies."
An honorable mention was given to
Thomas Federico for "New Brew: A Documen
tation of the Rebirth of Domestic Microbrew
eries."
Students in both programs were nominated
for the Boothe Award by their section leaders
or teaching assistants. The nominated essays

were passed on to a group of readers made up of
faculty from all CIV and Writing tracks, who
made the final selections.
At the reception students mingled with pro
fessors, as well as with the section leaders and
TAs who had nominated them.
"The reception was really nicely put togeth
er," said Perez.
"It was really laid-back, in typical Stanford
fashion," said Landsittel.
The students recognized were given a copy
of "The Riverside Shakespeare."
"I've always loved Shakespeare. I'm sure I'll
be reading [the book] this summer," said
Perez.
Winners also received a certificate and a
cash award of $350.
"The money will make the summer easier in
terms of working," said Anderson. Chen plans
to use her cash award to partially finance her
plane ticket to Taiwan to visit her parents this
summer.
Landsittel said she is more confident now
that she has the award in hand.
"Coming to Stanford is intimidating. [The
award] has given me more confidence in my
writing," said Landsittel.
