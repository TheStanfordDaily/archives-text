# Court rules in favor of gay rights
## Justices say Colorado measure would make homosexuals 'unequal' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a dramatic
victory for gay rights, the Supreme Court
struck down a Colorado measure it said
would deny homosexuals constitutional
protection and make them "unequal to
everyone else."
Colorado's constitutional amendment,
banning laws that protect homosexuals
from discrimination, "identifies persons
by a single trait and then denies them pro
tection across the board," said Justice
Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majori
ty in yesterday's 6-3 decision.
"It is not within our constitutional tra
ditions to enact laws of this sort," Kennedy
wrote.
It was the first major ruling involving
gay rights since a 1986 decision in which
the justices upheld a Georgia law that
criminalized homosexual sex between con
senting adults.
Yesterday's ruling did not address the
legality of homosexual conduct. It also did
not require stricter legal scrutiny of laws
based on sexual orientation, as the court
has for laws creating classifications based
on race or sex.
But the justices said the Colorado

amendment denied gays a political right
enjoyed by everyone else — the chiince to
seek protection from discrimination in
employment, housing and public accom
modations.
Such anti-discrimination laws do not
grant homosexuals special rights,
Kennedy said, but give them "protections
taken for granted by most people either
because they already have them or do not
need them."
In a stinging dissent, Justice Antonin
Scalia accused the majority of "imposing
upon all Americans" the pronouncement
that "animosity toward homosexuality ...
is evil."
Scalia called the amendment "Col
orado's reasonable effort to preserve tradi
tional American moral values" and added
that it was not the courts' business "to
take sides in this culture war."
"The amendment prohibits special
treatment of homosexuals and nothing
more," Scalia said.
His dissent was joined by Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and Justice Clarence
Thomas.
Joining Kennedy's majority opinion

were Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra
Day O'Connor, David Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer.
President Clinton "believes today's
decision was appropriate," said White
House spokesman Mike McCurry. He
called the Colorado law "bad policy ...
inconsistent with our common values."
"I think this is the most significant
decision in a decade for gay rights, abso
lutely," said Gene Copello of San Francis
co.
Shannon Wyss of Washington said the
ruling was only a small step for the gay
rights movement as a whole, but "I think
that for this Supreme Court, it's a huge
step."
Colorado Attorney General Gale Nor
ton said she was disappointed, adding,
"The debate in Colorado was about
whether special rights should be extended
to a new group."
The Colorado constitutional amend
ment, approved in 1992, has never been
enforced because it was immediately chal
lenged in court by gay men and women as
well as three cities that had enacted gay
rights ordinances.
