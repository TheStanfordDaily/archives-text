# Clinton renews Beijing trade benefits
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Steering a
zigzag path in his China policy, Presi
dent Clinton announced unconditional
renewal of trade benefits for Beijing just
days after threatening massive sanc
tions for trade piracy.
"We must not seek to isolate our
selves from China," the president said
in a speech yesterday. "We will engage
with China, without illusion, to advance
our interests in a more peaceful and
prosperous world."
The announcement may ease severe
strains with China but likely will ignite
a battle in Congress to revoke trade ben
efits, commonly known as MFN. Critics
from both parties say China should not
be rewarded for human rights and trade
abuses and its sale of materiel for nucle
ar weapons.
Revoking China's most-favored
nation status would sever economic ties
and "drive us back into a period of
mutual isolation and recrimination that

would harm America's interests, not
advance them," Clinton said.
With Congress' Republican leader
ship on his side, Clinton is likely to pre
vail in any congressional fight over the
question. But Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole, the Republicans' presumed
presidential nominee, said Clinton's
policies have put MFN's extension in
doubt. Dole urged the president "to
begin serious work" on Democratic law
makers to gain their support.
Like Dole, House Speaker Newt Gin
grich has endorsed MFN renewal but
accuses Clinton of having a weak Asian
policy.
Arguing against trade privileges for
Beijing, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
said the U.S. trade deficit with China
expanded from $10 million in 1985 to
$35 billion in 1995. Further, she said,
China is guilty of trade piracy and the
export of prison-made products.
"Why should the American worker

have to compete with slave labor?"
Pelosi asked. "It just isn't fair trade. It
isn't free trade."
In a House speech, Rep. Frank Wolf,
R-Va., accused China of religious and
political persecution and urged
Congress to override Clinton's decision.
"Let it be on his conscience, not ours,"
he said.
Republican presidential candidate
Pat Buchanan called Clinton's decision
"an act of economic, moral and military
appeasement."
The president notifies Congress for
mally of his MFN decision on June 3,
starting a 60-day clock during which the
House and Senate could vote to revoke
China's benefits. Clinton still could veto
the rejection.
China has been a persistent foreign
policy problem for American presidents,
and the debate over MFN presents the
opportunity for some election-year carp
ing about Clinton's policies.
