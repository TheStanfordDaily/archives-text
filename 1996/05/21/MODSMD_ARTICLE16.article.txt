Shen-Thompson ticket
has knowledge, skills for
strong ASSU leadership

Students have the
chance in this week's ASSU
election to finally put some
legitimacy back into the tired, self
centered bureaucratic body their
student government has become.
The first ASSU president in more
than two decades will have the
unique opportunity to lay the
groundwork for years to come
regarding what role the leader of
student government will play in
advancing student concerns. Presi
dential candidate Bill Shen and his
running mate Nick Thompson are
the only two candidates who are
qualified and competent enough to
take this pivotal role.
Shen's involvement with the
ASSU has given him the experi
ence a president needs in directing
issues to the appropriate channels
within the University. Indeed, his
advocacy in the name of student
safety recently led to the Universi
ty agreeing to install 75 emergency
phones around campus.
Thompson also knows his way
around the University hierarchy
and how to get things done. When
campus environmental groups
raised questions about the Univer
sity's investment policies, Thomp
son's proactive actions led to his
appointment of the University
Advisory Panel on Investment
Responsibility. His campaign
against corporate investment in
Myanmar, formerly known as
Burma, has attracted national
attention and recently led to Pepsi-
Co's decision to reconsider its
involvement in that country.
However, both Shen and Thomp
son must be careful not to embroil

the ASSU in issues that are outside
its purview. Thompson has said he
would support the repeal of the
Bone-Overdeck amendment, which
mandates that the ASSU not act on
issues that do not directly affect
Stanford students. This year's sen
ate has proven it can debate ad nau
seam about trivia] minutiae of par
liamentary procedure — when the
floor is opened to debates of national
significance, it is questionable that
the senate would have the time to
address its fundamental mission as a
source of support for student organi
zations. The ASSU must remember
that its primaiy mission is to advo
cate for students, not to topple gov
ernments.
In addition, Shen has also not
always stuck to his political guns.
As president, he cannot waffle on
issues that concern the student
body. Shen caused quite a stir when
he wrote an opinion piece in The
Daily calling for reform in the
ASSU. But when others began to
actively push for that cause, Shen
was conspicuously absent.
The other candidates in the race
lack the experience and knowledge
to be effective leaders of the student
body. Presidential candidate Sam
Ockman and vice presidential can
didate Mike Mitchell have forward
ed ambitious goals, but they display
little knowledge of how to actually
implement their plans. The Ham
mer and Coffin slate, consisting of
presidential candidate Margot
Quandt and Ben Olding, says it is
running a serious campaign. How
ever, they say they will merely act as
a conduit for student concerns, with
little ambitions of their own as to
what to do in this pivotal year.
This year's presidential race cen
ters on the abilities of the candi
dates, rather than each slate's per
sonal projects. Shen and Thompson
are the only candidates who display
the type of acumen required to run
student government— from both
within the ASSU and outside of it.
