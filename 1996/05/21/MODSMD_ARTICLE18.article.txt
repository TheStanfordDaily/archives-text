## In the context of memory 
### 
A YEARBOOK LIES on the pool
table, in place of cue balls and
racks. The pseudo-leather bur
gundy cover seems more mysterious
than the other swollen paperbacks. The
other books are fiction and philosophy
and technical manuals — theories of 1 ife.
In comparison, the yearbook purports to
present a snapshot of life.
I flip to a quintessential church tower.
St. Paul's School, 1983 rests upon the
weather vane. I can't see what direction
the wind is blowing. Every picture seems
to fit a stereotype. Professors in coats and
ties, plaid and argyle sweaters and dress
es. Pale faces and curly hair and puffy
parkas parade across the pages. Rugby
and lacrosse, bandannas cockily tied and
muddy knee guards are sprinkled
throughout. Forms — instead of grade
levels — mimic the British school system.
Single-sex houses, with names like
"Armour" and "Conover Twenty" squat
heavily in the shrubbery. Color panels
capture the blaze of fall and a worn wood
en farmhouse. "The overarching trends,"
a cultural anthropologist might say, "of a
New England prep school."
The seniors each have a section, filled
with quotes and private messages to each
other. Small black type speaks quietly:
"How can I tell you . . . that I love you?"
I wonder whom she addresses, if they
both understood, or if the name is care
fully encoded for solitary meaning. Yet
even at this moment of the significant

and the unique, the faces and thoughts
seem all alike. "Don't be dismayed by
good-byes. A farewell is necessary before
you can meet again," is repeated in sev
eral entries. One woman even writes,
"We're just mirror images of each other.
Good analogy. Remember, I love you." I
ponder the existence of love across time,
the intensity of feeling that comes with
parting, and then may fade thereafter.
Maybe all that matters is that the emo
tion was once real and touched the truth
of an individual.
I wonder, then, how to piece together
a life, to understand a community
through a smattering of pictures and
sentiments. A few odd details protrude
from the surface of the smooth, glossy
pages. Strange clubs: the "Deli Line," for
cafeteria workers? The "Pub Club,"for
minors? Then I see a memorial to a pro
fessor and his wife, a former student. He
started the Committee for Social Aware
ness because "it is necessary for a com
munity as isolated as that of St. Paul's to
have some knowledge of the problems
which confront the rest of the world."
They died within a day of each other,
while studying in Japan. Controversy
and tragedy, muted by smiling faces and
opaque text. These mysteries I can never
know. I don't know whom to ask, and
lack the context to imagine.
The back of the yearbook lists where
the seniors went. Many attended Ivy
League institutions and other East Coast

standbys. Eleven of them came to Stan
ford's Wild West. One of those names
represents the person who brought the
book I now hold in my hands.
A collection of signatures scatters
across the flaps of the cover. No person
alized messages, no indication of the
owner exists. I remember the long
entries from my friends in high school —
what causes someone to leave behind a
yearbook, to cast aside those memories?
When do objects lose their meaning?
Maybe shiny pages did not reflect reality.
The truth glints off and falls away into
shadow.
So the yearbook sits in the dorm
library, to be pawed through by year
after year by curious hands. Perhaps
that was the appeal to the owner; the
pages would continue to come to life
every time, instead of being buried in the
rafters of an attic.
Memories drift away like snow. Walk
ing through the cold hush, I make tracks
with broad willow snowshoes. I wonder if
the footsteps linger in some safe place, in
a space for the evanescent, after the
spring snow melts. Perhaps thoughts
and emotions exist somewhere after fad
ing from the heart.
