Editorial criticizing Mahood unfair, English prof, says

WHAT PROVOKED THAT nasty
little sexist screed and ad feminam
editorial against Professor
Mahood, one of the faculty's most dedicat
ed, hard-working, respected and idealistic
leaders and a steady advocate for excellence
and betterment in undergraduate educa
tion? We can disagree over whether a tight
ening of the Stanford grading procedures
to bring it in line with the policies of all
comparable universities is good or bad (the
faculty, in near unanimity, thinks it a good
thing), and we can differ in good faith
about whether students on the Faculty
Senate's Planning and Policy Board Com
mittee would make it more or less effective,
more or less ceremonial in the delibera-

tions of the administration (that's what the
close vote in the senate was really about),
but there's something oddly disturbing
about the spirit of personal vendetta and
the petulant falsehood of the anti-Mahood
tantrum. I really doubt that even the
author of the editorial believes the words
and charges in it that she, "in the eyes of
many" (how many?), "single-handedly"
was responsible for the grade-changing pol
icy (all but two senators voted for a unani
mous senate committee's recommenda
tion) and rim "a tireless public relations
campaign" to support it (in fact, no one is
less interested in PR and rhetorical pos
ing), or that she is "a woman who believes
that students are too incompetent to be

allowed freedom in their academic choic
es," "that she would quite clearly prefer
Stanford students to sit down, shut up and
always do as she says" (actually, it's hard
to imagine a more courteous and patient
professor and moderator), or that she is
the prideful sort who "reworks her
resume" (no one seems less vain and no
one has less time to look at her resume).
With delusions of grandeur ("As he
begins his tenure as senate chair, Bratman
must always remember..."), the writer of
the editorial, professing to see with "the
eyes of the student body" and to know
what "has provoked the ire of the vast
majority of Stanford students" (a course
drop policy change — break out the

whine), pompously awards her, as Senate
Chair, an NP. On the contrary, let me
invoke the Change of Grade Policy — error
in transcription, work overlooked: I know
of no member of the senate or the faculty
at large who would give Gail Mahood any
thing less than an A+ for her tenure as
Chair and for her remarkable service to the
University and all its constituencies over
the years — a richly deserved A+.
Is it too late to drop the course of ad
feminam, ad hominem attack on people
whose ideas you sometimes disagree with?
