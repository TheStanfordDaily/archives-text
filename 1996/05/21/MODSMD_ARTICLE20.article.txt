# Students must make an effort to have a voice in decisions on education
## 
### 
I have been watching the recent
changes in course and objective of Stan
ford's decision-making bodies for quite a
while now. I am frightened when I consid
er the myopic vision of those who enact
these changes. It seems to me that this
university has undergone a rapid loss of
self-confidence. Although it is important to
avoid complacency, it is an entirely differ
ent matter to turn any notions of self-con
fidence into fears of inferiority.
The key point of these statements is not
to criticize those who are working so hard
to improve our community, but rather to
remind those who are making the decision
why we, as students and faculty, are
attracted to this truly wondrous institu
tion. It is not simply the name, it is not
simply the weather, and it is not the
tuition. It is the freedom of thought and
education of this campus that draws its
students and faculty.
Shifts in focus by the administrative
bodies of our university, as evidenced by
recent articles in The Daily as well as the

ungodly sum spent on the web page reno
vations, to public relations and advertise
ment betray a certain insecurity concern
ing the ability of our university to stand on
its own merits. As a student, it has become
clear to me that we have become afraid
that our own top-rated academic system is
no longer adequate. The return of the F
may sound quite fair. However, the some
half dozen other adulterations of our for
merly unique grading policy denying the
credibility and responsibility of our stu
dents to own up to their education are not.
The increasing economization of our vari
ous departments may mean tidier and
leaner expenditures, but in many cases,
cost to education may be outweighing the
benefit of conserved resources. Specialized
programs like Sophomore College and
Presidential Scholars may do well to bring
attention to changc and improvement in
these particular aspects of education, but
they do little to afTect and benefit the vast
majority of students. These programs
merely point out the fact that, although we
are finding the time and money to help the
lucky few, we are unwilling to invest in the
improvement of the overall education of
the Stanford student.
The very system of education seems to
have come apart at the hinges. Mentoring,

access to guidance, even commonplace
advice seems to be harder and harder to
get on this campus. The level of personal
education should be first and foremost on
the list of educational priorities, not the
pedestalization of a few, or pretty pictures
on the Internet, or censored news bites.
However, we are now on the threshold
of a new era in student empowerment. The
ASSU is undergoing rapid and sweeping
changes. The very nature and function of
student government is changing. We must
use this opportunity wisely, to get our foot
in the door to student voice and empower
ment. We as students are not powerless to
the will and desire of the omniscient
"administration." There is no better time
to drive this point home than now.
We must guide this new government
well in these incipient stages, both as crit
ics and as participants. We must ensure
that our opinion as a student body is heard
and believed. We must uphold these
changes with the fullest support of the
entire Stanford community. But most
importantly, we must secure every possibil
ity of student representation within the
campus decision-making process. I refuse
to allow the voice of a minority of faculty
senators and a handful of administrators
dictate my education. If we fail to drive for

the changes we need to preserve education
on this campus, we will never get a second
chance. We must push for student empow
erment now, before it is too late.
