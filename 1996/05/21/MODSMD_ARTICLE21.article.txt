# Editorial regarding Prof. Mahood right on target
## 
### 
Kudos to the author of Monday's edito
rial! During Mahood's tenure as Fac Sen
chair, I never once heard her express an
interest in student opinion. And until
today, I have never heard The Daily so ade
quately express my opinion of her and her
harebrained ideas. I'm graduating next
month and it is not too soon. I've heard
incessant bitching for four years about
budget cuts, increased efficiency and his
torical records. This university has become
so anal-retentive because of people like Gail
Mahood that Stanford is run more like
Xerox than an institution of personal edifi
cation. It is a sad commentary when we
seek leadership from a washed-up hag who
is so righteous, she deserves to be crucified.
