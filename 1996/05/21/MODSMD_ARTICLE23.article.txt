QHow do fire walkers avoid getting
*burned?
A There are lots of different theories
• about why fire walkers don't get
• burned. A lot of them are, to put it
objectively, pretty stupid. Most of these
ideas come from infomercial-type people
who are trying to get infomercial-watching
type people to pay lots of money to join their
karma pyramid. Supposedly, there are
supernatural powers that protect fire walk
ers from being burned, and when these
powers are released they can then be chan
neled into other avenues of your life, like
winning the lottery.
Of course, before I introduce any of the
scientific theories about fire walking, I have
to give the prerequisite spiel about physics
and heat. There are two methods of heat
transfer that are important for understand
ing fire walks.

The first is how heat is transferred
between two objects. From common experi
ence, you probably know that heat travels
from objects with higher temperatures to
those with lower temperatures. However, if
the hotter object decreases in temperature
by one degree, it's not necessarily true that
the other object increases in temperature by
one degree. The actual change in tempera
ture is related to the amount of heat trans
ferred into or out of the object by a number
known as the heat capacity.
Something with a high heat capacity is
harder to cool down because you have to
extract more heat from it to lower its tem
perature. It's also harder to heat up that
same thing because you have to put more
heat in to raise its temperature. In general,
it's just harder to change the temperature of
a substance with a high heat capacity, so
make sure you're prepared if you're going to
try.
The second thing that needs to be con
sidered is how fast a substmce can conduct
heat within itself. This property is the ther
mal conductivity of a substance. A high

thermal conductivity means that heat trav
els quickly, such as in a metal. A low ther
mal conductivity means that heat travels
slowly through the substance, like in Styro
foam. Good insulators have low thermal
conductivities so that heat can't travel
through them as quickly. Remember that.
One of the first theories proposed to
explain fire walking is pretty cool, but prob
ably isn't the major reason fire walkers
don't have fried feet. It's called the Leiden
frost effect, named after some German guy
whose name I don't remember. The basic
idea is that when water touches an extreme
ly hot object, a small layer of the water
touching the hot object immediately vapor
izes.
The water vapor that forms this layer
has a low thermal conductivity, so it can't
transfer heat to the rest of the water as well.
In effect, the water vapor insulates the rest
of the water from the heat source. This is
why when you drop water onto a really hot
skillet it bounces around and takes longer to
fry than you would expect. The claim was
that people who fire walked had wet feet

because of sweat or wet grass around the
fire walking pit. In the end, even though it
had a really cool name, people just didn't
really believe it was the major reason fire
walking worked.
The main theory people have now is that
the coals and embers which fire walkers use
have low heat capacities and low thermal
conductivities. What this means is that
when you step on the hot coals, the heat on
the surface goes really quickly into your
foot. The reason this doesn't feel very hot,
though, is because of the low heat capacity
of the embers. By absorbing a small amount
of heat from the embers, you can drop the
temperature of the surface a lot.
Then, because of the low thermal con
ductivity of wood, the surface doesn't reheat
very quickly because heat llow is slow with
in the embers themselves. As long as you
don't spend too much time on each step, the
total amount of heat transferred from the
hot coals and embers to your feet is pretty
small. A conservative estimate would be
about half a second for each step.
Scientists who believe in this theory have

challenged fire walkers who claim mystic
powers to walk over hot metal plates, which
have very high thermal conductivities With
a high thermal conductivity, heat would be
transferred to the feet very quickly and
would definitely cause burns. Some claim
that this is ethically dubious, for scientists
to make a challenge they believe would seri
ously injure a fire walker. But, hey, all in the
name of science, right?
My theory is that all the fire walking
infomercial people know about the physics
behind it, but won't admit to it because oth
erwise people wouldn't pay them any
money. Would you rather spend $49.95 on a
simple physics demonstration or on super
natural powers?
Thus offer is not valid in Massachusetts,
Illinois and Maine.
