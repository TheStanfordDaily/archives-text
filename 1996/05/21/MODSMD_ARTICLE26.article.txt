### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
The Curriculum on Children and Society an
nounced the five undergraduate recipients of this
year's Caroline Penney Summer Fellowships last
week.
Each winner has secured public policy summer
internships with agencies that address the concerns
of children and youth. They will each receive $2,000.
Students were chosen by a selection committee
based on submitted proposals in a "pretty competi
tive" process, said Christina Johannes, assistant di
rector of the Curriculum on Children and Society.
"I was definitely surprised |I had won]," said
Rachel Timbie, one of the fellowship winners. "I'm
really excited for the opport unity to work for a speak
er we had for Children and Society. [Johannes] is a
really strong and driven woman who has devoted her
work to helping children, youth and the family."
Other fellowship recipients include junior
Zachary Foreman, sophomore Sally Foster, fresh
man Anupama Menon and sophomore Catherine
Roller.
Timbie is a coterminal student in sociology and
will work with the Peninsula Partnership for Chil
dren, Youth and Families this summer in San Mateo
County. She will be involved with projects helping
social service programs make the transition to offer
ing more accessible forms of service on a county
wide basis.
Timbie said she "probably would not have been
able to do it as a full-time job" if she hadn't re
ceived the fellowship. "I'm really grateful for this

opportunity.
Roller will serve as an intern in the Seattle School
District's Family Support Worker Program and ad
dress the service needs of homeless children.
Menon will be an intern at the Office of Youth
Arts and Education in the Los Angeles Cultural Af
fairs Department. Without the fellowship, she said
she would have just "gotten a job in a bank or just
volunteered" somewhere.
"I didn't expect it all, since I'm a freshman," said
Menon. "I thought they'd give priority to upper
classmen."
As an intern at the Youth Policy Institute in
Washington, DC., Foreman will research the poten
tial role of technology and the Internet for elemen
tary and secondary education.
Foster plans to work in the Child Care and Fami
ly Services Department in Palo Alto's Office of
Human Services.
"I'm from Palo Alto. Growing up there and the
interaction I had through family situations high
lighted to me how oftentimes different families in
the same circumstances — needing child care — will
need different services," said Foster. "It's exciting
for me to do something about a problem that I've
grown up witnessing."
This may be the last year that the fellowships will
be offered. The fund has a limited amount of money,
said Johannes. The fellowships have been offered
annually since 1993.
"It was intended to support experiential learning
for undergraduate students," said Johannes. She
said she hopes to be able to raise funds to continue
the program next year.
