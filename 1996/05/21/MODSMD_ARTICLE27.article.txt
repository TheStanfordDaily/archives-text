A 1 HENS, Ga. — Some 4,000 people
piled into the Dan Magill Tennis Com
plex at the University of Georgia yester
day to watch their beloved Bulldogs face
off against the Stanford Cardinal. They
got their money's worth, as every fan was
able to witness one of the greatest dual
matches in NCAA tournament history.
The defending champion Cardinal relied
heavily on their experience, as they es
caped college tennis' version of the
"Dawg Pound" with a very narrow 4-3
victory. The win puts Stanford in the fi
nals where they will meet UCLA.
Manuel Diaz, Georgia's coach, said of
the match, "You can't get any closer than
that. It's one that got away. A match like
this doesn't just get away — the other
team's gotta go get it. Stanford is a cham
pionship team that's been in this kind of
situation before, and they won the big
points."
Indeed, Stanford's experience paid off,
as three of the Cardinal's four points
were earned by seniors. "I give a lot of
credit to my players' character and their
hearts," said Stanford coach Dick Gould.
For the first time in the tourney, Stan
ford was unable to pull out the doubles

point, making it necessary for the team to
win four of six singles matches if they
wished to move onto the finals.
Senior southpaw Jeff Salzenstein (No.
4) wasted no time in evening the match
score at 1-1 with a 6-0, 6-3 win over his
Australian opponent, Steven Baldas (No.
23).
Next off the courts was 6-foot-4 Jim
Thomas (No. 51), who overpowered a
much smaller Eddie Jacques (No. 98) in
straight sets, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), to take the
point at fourth singles.
The Thomas victory gave the Cardinal
a 2-1 lead, as all of the remaining four sin
gles bouts dragged into third sets. The
first match to conclude was at fifth sin
gles, where a gutsy Kevin Sessions (No.
53) fought back from one set down, to
knock off Grant Elliott (No. 99) 2-6, 6-2,
6-4. Sessions' victory re-knotted the
score at 2-2.
Paul Goldstein (No. 28) trailed by a
count of 1-3 when Elliott's match con
cluded. The spirited sophomore fought
hard, but Georgia's hard serving John
Roddick (No. 16) refused to give up his
one game advantage, defending all of
Goldstein's break chances with big
serves, and won 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.
Goldstein's loss darkened Cardinal
hopes. At the moment of his match's fin
ish, Ryan Wolters(No. 11) found himself
down 3-0 in the third, and Ricky Becker
was in a similar predicament, down 3-1
after splitting the first two sets. Stanford
was on the brink of defeat, needing to win
each of those matches to stay alive.
However, Stanford's star freshman

raised his game to counter Laschinger's.
He silenced the rowdy crowd and gained
all momentum by rattling off five
straight games and assuming a 5-3 lead.
He held serve easily twice, to win the
match, 6-4,4-6, 6-4.
While VVolters* victory again dead
locked the score at 3-3, Stanford was still
in a tight spot. Egyptian freshman
Hisham Hemeda had preserved his one
break lead, and at 5-3 was serving for the
set, his match, and a berth into the finals.
Becker had to break his sixth singles
counterpart to keep hope alive for the few
Cardinal fans in attendance. As the en
tire "Dawg Pound" crowded around
court No. 6, Becker put himself in excel
lent position by winning the first three
points of the game, good for a love-40 lead
and three break chances.
However, the Bulldog freshman,
whose only regular season loss came to
Becker last February, won three consec
utive points of his own forcing a deuce.
Becker gained the advantage and his
fourth break point opportunity with an
overhead, but was again unable to capi
talize when Hemeda drilled a cross-court
backhand past him at the net.
Hemeda's next serve was deep, and
Becker shanked a forehand wide. The er
rant return gave Hemeda, and the Geor
gia Bulldogs, a match point. But the Bull
dog pushed Becker's return deep, and a
third deuce was reached.
This time, the Stanford senior won the
advantage with a tough forehand volley.
