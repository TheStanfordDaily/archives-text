A 1 HENS, Ga. — Some 4,000 people
piled into the Dan Magill Tennis Com
plex at the University of Georgia yester
day to watch their beloved Bulldogs face
off against the Stanford Cardinal. They
got their money's worth, as every fan was
able to witness one of the greatest dual
matches in NCAA tournament history.
The defending champion Cardinal relied
heavily on their experience, as they es
caped college tennis' version of the
"Dawg Pound" with a very narrow 4-3
victory. The win puts Stanford in the fi
nals where they will meet UCLA.
Manuel Diaz, Georgia's coach, said of
the match, "You can't get any closer than
that. It's one that got away. A match like
this doesn't just get away — the other
team's gotta go get it. Stanford is a cham
pionship team that's been in this kind of
situation before, and they won the big
points."
Indeed, Stanford's experience paid off,
as three of the Cardinal's four points
were earned by seniors. "I give a lot of
credit to my players' character and their
hearts," said Stanford coach Dick Gould.
For the first time in the tourney, Stan
ford was unable to pull out the doubles

point, making it necessary for the team to
win four of six singles matches if they
wished to move onto the finals.
Senior southpaw Jeff Salzenstein (No.
4) wasted no time in evening the match
score at 1-1 with a 6-0, 6-3 win over his
Australian opponent, Steven Baldas (No.
23).
Next off the courts was 6-foot-4 Jim
Thomas (No. 51), who overpowered a
much smaller Eddie Jacques (No. 98) in
straight sets, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), to take the
point at fourth singles.
The Thomas victory gave the Cardinal
a 2-1 lead, as all of the remaining four sin
gles bouts dragged into third sets. The
first match to conclude was at fifth sin
gles, where a gutsy Kevin Sessions (No.
53) fought back from one set down, to
knock off Grant Elliott (No. 99) 2-6, 6-2,
6-4. Sessions' victory re-knotted the
score at 2-2.
Paul Goldstein (No. 28) trailed by a
count of 1-3 when Elliott's match con
cluded. The spirited sophomore fought
hard, but Georgia's hard serving John
Roddick (No. 16) refused to give up his
one game advantage, defending all of
Goldstein's break chances with big
serves, and won 6-4, 2-6, 6-4.
Goldstein's loss darkened Cardinal
hopes. At the moment of his match's fin
ish, Ryan Wolters(No. 11) found himself
down 3-0 in the third, and Ricky Becker
was in a similar predicament, down 3-1
after splitting the first two sets. Stanford
was on the brink of defeat, needing to win
each of those matches to stay alive.
However, Stanford's star freshman

raised his game to counter Laschinger's.
He silenced the rowdy crowd and gained
all momentum by rattling off five
straight games and assuming a 5-3 lead.
He held serve easily twice, to win the
match, 6-4,4-6, 6-4.
While VVolters* victory again dead
locked the score at 3-3, Stanford was still
in a tight spot. Egyptian freshman
Hisham Hemeda had preserved his one
break lead, and at 5-3 was serving for the
set, his match, and a berth into the finals.
Becker had to break his sixth singles
counterpart to keep hope alive for the few
Cardinal fans in attendance. As the en
tire "Dawg Pound" crowded around
court No. 6, Becker put himself in excel
lent position by winning the first three
points of the game, good for a love-40 lead
and three break chances.
However, the Bulldog freshman,
whose only regular season loss came to
Becker last February, won three consec
utive points of his own forcing a deuce.
Becker gained the advantage and his
fourth break point opportunity with an
overhead, but was again unable to capi
talize when Hemeda drilled a cross-court
backhand past him at the net.
Hemeda's next serve was deep, and
Becker shanked a forehand wide. The er
rant return gave Hemeda, and the Geor
gia Bulldogs, a match point. But the Bull
dog pushed Becker's return deep, and a
third deuce was reached.
This time, the Stanford senior won the
advantage with a tough forehand volley.



Laura Hester — Daily
Senior Jim Thomas smashes a forehand yesterday in his match against Georgia's
Eddie Jacques. Thomas won the match 6-3,7-6.
Hemeda foiled Becker's fifth break
chance with a hard forehand down
the line. The game reached its
fourth deuce, and both players
took time to drink some water, and
regain their composure. It had
been nearly four hours since they
had first taken the courts, and the
humid 93-degree heat was taking
its toll on both players.
Hemeda gained the advantage
and his second match point oppor
tunity moments later, but threw
away his chance to clinch the win
when he smacked a forehand wide.
The Georgia freshman came right
back, however, when Becker
pushed an easy backhand volley
out.
Becker again fended off match
point, resuscitating Cardinal life
when Hemeda failed to get Beck
er's forehand back over the net.
Hemeda netted the next ball also,

giving Becker his sixth break op
portunity.
This time "the Doctor," as his
fans call him, took advantage of a
Hemeda slip. Hemeda mis-hit
Becker's return into the net, for
feiting his one break advantage,
and restoring vitality to the Stan
ford team.
Hemeda appeared broken and
frustrated, and Becker held his
serve easily to tie the set score at 5-
5. Becker fed off the momentum to
break Hemeda in the eleventh
game with little difficulty. He then
served out the match, winning the
final point on a service winner.
"I think that a true champion,
which Ricky is, comes through in
that situation," Gould said. "It
takes little luck, but it also takes a
lot of guts to win that kind of
match. I'm proud of the way Ricky
and Ryan, and really the way all
our guys played."
Cardinal players and fans
stormed the court in reckless jubi
lation, as a disappointed Georgia
crowd left in somber silence.
