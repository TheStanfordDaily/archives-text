TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - After
disposing of the No. 3 Duke Blue
Devils 5-2 in the national semifi
nals yesterday, Stanford women's
tennis squad has an opportunity to
return to a familiar position in
women's tennis: the top. The Car
dinal (25-1) has won eight national
titles, including six in a row, but is
in the midst of a five-year champi
onship drought. The second-seed
ed Stanford squad can end that
streak today, however, with a win
over top-seeded Florida.
"We are happy to be there and
have a chance to play for the na
tional championship again," said
Stanford head coach Frank Bren
nan.

"Duke gave us a great match. I
have to take my hat off to them.
They did a great job. I have a lot of
respect for those players."
The championship task will not
be easy, though. The Gators (30-0)
are the top-ranked team in the
country and have been all season
long. They have yet to lose a game,
and boast a 5-2 victory over the
Cardinal in the National Team In
door Championships in February.
The No. 2 Cardinal doubles
team of senior Kim Shasby and
sophomore Julie Scott clinched the
victory over Duke with a 6-1, 6-3
straight-set win which was post
poned due to a rain delay. It was
the first match in which the Cardi
nal reached doubles play before
winningtherequired five matches.
The other doubles contests
were suspended in progress. The
No. I Stanford duo of sophomore
Ania Bleszynski and junior Katie
Schlukebir were about to clinch
the match themselves, leading
Vanessa Webb and Diana Spadea
