TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - After
disposing of the No. 3 Duke Blue
Devils 5-2 in the national semifi
nals yesterday, Stanford women's
tennis squad has an opportunity to
return to a familiar position in
women's tennis: the top. The Car
dinal (25-1) has won eight national
titles, including six in a row, but is
in the midst of a five-year champi
onship drought. The second-seed
ed Stanford squad can end that
streak today, however, with a win
over top-seeded Florida.
"We are happy to be there and
have a chance to play for the na
tional championship again," said
Stanford head coach Frank Bren
nan.

"Duke gave us a great match. I
have to take my hat off to them.
They did a great job. I have a lot of
respect for those players."
The championship task will not
be easy, though. The Gators (30-0)
are the top-ranked team in the
country and have been all season
long. They have yet to lose a game,
and boast a 5-2 victory over the
Cardinal in the National Team In
door Championships in February.
The No. 2 Cardinal doubles
team of senior Kim Shasby and
sophomore Julie Scott clinched the
victory over Duke with a 6-1, 6-3
straight-set win which was post
poned due to a rain delay. It was
the first match in which the Cardi
nal reached doubles play before
winningtherequired five matches.
The other doubles contests
were suspended in progress. The
No. I Stanford duo of sophomore
Ania Bleszynski and junior Katie
Schlukebir were about to clinch
the match themselves, leading
Vanessa Webb and Diana Spadea

6-0,5-2.
Junior Emily Burt and senior co
captain Beth BerrLs also had a one
set lead on opponents Karen O'Sulli
van and Luanne Spadea as well, 6-4,
2-2 when the match was clinched.
" I was glad that we got a chance to
play doubles," Brennan said. "I was
thrilled with the way the doubles
teams played."
The victory was a bit of an anom
aly, however, as Stanford's most
successful singles competitors un
characteristically dropped their
matches. Both Scott (22-2) and se
nior co-captain Amy Chiminello
(22-2) lost to their Duke counter
parts. The two losses were as many
as the they have lost all season com
bined.
Scott jumped all over Wendy Fix
in the first set of the No. 5 singles
match, 6-1. But Fix fought back and
forced a split in a tight second set. Fix
rode the momentum of that split to
take the match, 1-6,6-4,6-2.
At the No. 6 position, Chiminello
caught Duke's Karen O'Sullivan on
the wrong day. The Blue Devil junior
had it stuck on automatic all after
noon, downing the Cardinal senior
in straight sets, 6-2,6-2.
With Scott and Chiminello, usu
ally money in the bank, falling on the
bottom courts, it was up to the rest of
the Cardinal singles lineup to pull
their weight and they did just that.
Stanford junior Sandra De Silva
(20-4) continued to tear through her
NCAA opponents at No. 3 singles,
drowning Diana Spadea, 6-1, 6-4.
The match marked De Silva's third
straight-set victory of the tourna
ment. On the No. 4 court, senior
Kim Shasby gave the Cardinal its
second point of the afternoon by de
feating Luanne Spadea in three sets,
6-2,3-6,6-3.
Shasby (15-7) took the first set,
but could not hold on in the second.
Facing a 4-3 deficit in the final set,
Shasby broke serve to tie it up and
went on to win the final two games.
In those four victorious games,
Shasby lost just three points total.
Shasbv is now 10-0 in the past three

years in NCAA team competition.
Bleszynski (18-8) also gained a
Stanford point in singles in a block
buster matchup on the No. 1 court.
Ranked No. 7 in college singles, the
Cardinal All-American met Webb,
the country's third-ranked singles
player.
After defeating the No. 8 player in
the quarterfinals on Sunday,
Bleszynski did not let up. After fight
ing her way through a dismal first
set in which Webb cruised to a 6-0
win, Bleszynski broke serve in the
second to take a 4-2 lead and eventu
ally split by taking the set, 6-3.
The Stanford sophomore caught
fire at that point, taking a 3-0 third
set lead by passing a charging Webb
left and right. Webb climbed back to
within 4-2 with the two players trad
ing breaks, but Bleszynski held on
for the upset, 0-6,6-3,6-2.
"I obviously didn't play my best
tennis in the first set," Bleszynski
said. "But then I think I started clos
ing out the point better. I had a lot of
opportunities to do that in the first
set, but I wasn't finishing. She was
able to sneak a lob or a passing shot
in because I didn't put the point
away in the first place."
Brennan cited Bleszynski's atti
tude as motivating her to come back.
"Ania's pride kicked in," Bren
nan said. '"And she has a load of tal
ent. When she gets mad, she serves
pretty well, and she was pretty riled
up."
On the No. 2 court, Schlukebir
turned the heat up at just the right
time. After splitt ing the first two sets
with Kristin Sanderson, the Cardi
nal junior found her serve up 6-5 in
the third. After a controversial let
call by Sanderson, Schlukebir reeled
off two straight aces to give the Car
dinal a 4-2 overall lead going into
doubles.
In February's preview of tomor
row's final, the Oators took four of
the six singles matches. Yet that was
Stanford's only loss of the season
and occurred before the Cardinal
reeled off 15 straight games includ
ing a perfect Pacific 10 Conference
season.
Much like the Cardinal, the Flori
da singles lineup features two top 10
competitors, a top 20 player and su
perb depth through the No. 6 player.

"We were hoping it would work out
like this," Brennan said. "We know
Florida has a great team. They're
very good, undefeated. I think it will
be a great tennis match. We have a
lot of respect for them."
In the Indoor title game, Florida
won all but the No. 3 and No. 5
matches, which were taken by De
Silva and Scott, respectively.
Bleszynski found herself on the
sour end of a straight set match cap
tured by Craybas, and Schlukebir
lost a tight match to Buth, 6-4.
Senior Lisa Pugliese dropped
Shasby in straight sets as well, while
Chiminello lost her only match of
the regular season in a three-set
thriller to freshman Stephanie Nick
itas.
The Gators clinched the match at
No. 1 doubles as Buth and Nickitas
defeated Bleszynski and Schlukebir,
8-2.
Yet Stanford feels it has improved
in just the places it needs in order to
upset Florida.
"Ania has stepped it up so much
since then and Katie lost a real tight
one to Dawn," said senior co-captain
Chiminello. "Obviously, Julie is now
Pac-10 champion, and I think I've
improved rny game also."
Brennan agreed that the Gators
will see a different Cardinal squad.
"I think we have improved
tremendously since then," he said.
"Maybe they have too. I also think
we are a better team outdoors. We're
looking forward to it."
Chiminello also commented on
the Cardinal's improvement since
the Florida loss.
"I think the loss was good because
we have busted our butts ever since
that match," said Chiminello. "If we
had by with a victory, I think we
might have been able to rest on our
laurels. Instead, I think we have im
proved leaps and bounds."
The statistics support the im
provement theory. Scott and
Chiminello obviously were tough be
fore and after the match, but since
February, Bleszynski has beaten
three top-10 singles players, and
Shasby is playing her best tennis of
the year.
Florida advanced to the title
match by eliminating Pac-10 rival
UCLA in the semifinals, 5-1.

buster matchup on the No. 1 court.
Ranked No. 7 in college singles, the
Cardinal All-American met Webb,
the country's third-ranked singles
player.
After defeating the No. 8 player in
the quarterfinals on Sunday,
Bleszynski did not let up. After fight
ing her way through a dismal first
set in which Webb cruised to a 6-0
win, Bleszynski broke serve in the
second to take a 4-2 lead and eventu
ally split by taking the set, 6-3.
The Stanford sophomore caught
fire at that point, taking a 3-0 third
set lead by passing a charging Webb
left and right. Webb climbed back to
within 4-2 with the two players trad
ing breaks, but Bleszynski held on
for the upset, 0-6,6-3,6-2.
"I obviously didn't play my best
tennis in the first set," Bleszynski
said. "But then I think I started clos
ing out the point better. I had a lot of
opportunities to do that in the first
set, but I wasn't finishing. She was
able to sneak a lob or a passing shot
in because I didn't put the point
away in the first place."
Brennan cited Bleszynski's atti
tude as motivating her to come back.
"Ania's pride kicked in," Bren
nan said. '"And she has a load of tal
ent. When she gets mad, she serves
pretty well, and she was pretty riled
up."
On the No. 2 court, Schlukebir
turned the heat up at just the right
time. After splitt ing the first two sets
with Kristin Sanderson, the Cardi
nal junior found her serve up 6-5 in
the third. After a controversial let
call by Sanderson, Schlukebir reeled
off two straight aces to give the Car
dinal a 4-2 overall lead going into
doubles.
In February's preview of tomor
row's final, the Oators took four of
the six singles matches. Yet that was
Stanford's only loss of the season
and occurred before the Cardinal
reeled off 15 straight games includ
ing a perfect Pacific 10 Conference
season.
Much like the Cardinal, the Flori
da singles lineup features two top 10
competitors, a top 20 player and su
perb depth through the No. 6 player.

"We were hoping it would work out
like this," Brennan said. "We know
Florida has a great team. They're
very good, undefeated. I think it will
be a great tennis match. We have a
lot of respect for them."
In the Indoor title game, Florida
won all but the No. 3 and No. 5
matches, which were taken by De
Silva and Scott, respectively.
Bleszynski found herself on the
sour end of a straight set match cap
tured by Craybas, and Schlukebir
lost a tight match to Buth, 6-4.
Senior Lisa Pugliese dropped
Shasby in straight sets as well, while
Chiminello lost her only match of
the regular season in a three-set
thriller to freshman Stephanie Nick
itas.
The Gators clinched the match at
No. 1 doubles as Buth and Nickitas
defeated Bleszynski and Schlukebir,
8-2.
Yet Stanford feels it has improved
in just the places it needs in order to
upset Florida.
"Ania has stepped it up so much
since then and Katie lost a real tight
one to Dawn," said senior co-captain
Chiminello. "Obviously, Julie is now
Pac-10 champion, and I think I've
improved rny game also."
Brennan agreed that the Gators
will see a different Cardinal squad.
"I think we have improved
tremendously since then," he said.
"Maybe they have too. I also think
we are a better team outdoors. We're
looking forward to it."
Chiminello also commented on
the Cardinal's improvement since
the Florida loss.
"I think the loss was good because
we have busted our butts ever since
that match," said Chiminello. "If we
had by with a victory, I think we
might have been able to rest on our
laurels. Instead, I think we have im
proved leaps and bounds."
The statistics support the im
provement theory. Scott and
Chiminello obviously were tough be
fore and after the match, but since
February, Bleszynski has beaten
three top-10 singles players, and
Shasby is playing her best tennis of
the year.
Florida advanced to the title
match by eliminating Pac-10 rival
UCLA in the semifinals, 5-1.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - After
disposing of the No. 3 Duke Blue
Devils 5-2 in the national semifi
nals yesterday, Stanford women's
tennis squad has an opportunity to
return to a familiar position in
women's tennis: the top. The Car
dinal (25-1) has won eight national
titles, including six in a row, but is
in the midst of a five-year champi
onship drought. The second-seed
ed Stanford squad can end that
streak today, however, with a win
over top-seeded Florida.
"We are happy to be there and
have a chance to play for the na
tional championship again," said
Stanford head coach Frank Bren
nan.

"Duke gave us a great match. I
have to take my hat off to them.
They did a great job. I have a lot of
respect for those players."
The championship task will not
be easy, though. The Gators (30-0)
are the top-ranked team in the
country and have been all season
long. They have yet to lose a game,
and boast a 5-2 victory over the
Cardinal in the National Team In
door Championships in February.
The No. 2 Cardinal doubles
team of senior Kim Shasby and
sophomore Julie Scott clinched the
victory over Duke with a 6-1, 6-3
straight-set win which was post
poned due to a rain delay. It was
the first match in which the Cardi
nal reached doubles play before
winningtherequired five matches.
The other doubles contests
were suspended in progress. The
No. I Stanford duo of sophomore
Ania Bleszynski and junior Katie
Schlukebir were about to clinch
the match themselves, leading
Vanessa Webb and Diana Spadea

6-0,5-2.
Junior Emily Burt and senior co
captain Beth BerrLs also had a one
set lead on opponents Karen O'Sulli
van and Luanne Spadea as well, 6-4,
2-2 when the match was clinched.
" I was glad that we got a chance to
play doubles," Brennan said. "I was
thrilled with the way the doubles
teams played."
The victory was a bit of an anom
aly, however, as Stanford's most
successful singles competitors un
characteristically dropped their
matches. Both Scott (22-2) and se
nior co-captain Amy Chiminello
(22-2) lost to their Duke counter
parts. The two losses were as many
as the they have lost all season com
bined.
Scott jumped all over Wendy Fix
in the first set of the No. 5 singles
match, 6-1. But Fix fought back and
forced a split in a tight second set. Fix
rode the momentum of that split to
take the match, 1-6,6-4,6-2.
At the No. 6 position, Chiminello
caught Duke's Karen O'Sullivan on
the wrong day. The Blue Devil junior
had it stuck on automatic all after
noon, downing the Cardinal senior
in straight sets, 6-2,6-2.
With Scott and Chiminello, usu
ally money in the bank, falling on the
bottom courts, it was up to the rest of
the Cardinal singles lineup to pull
their weight and they did just that.
Stanford junior Sandra De Silva
(20-4) continued to tear through her
NCAA opponents at No. 3 singles,
drowning Diana Spadea, 6-1, 6-4.
The match marked De Silva's third
straight-set victory of the tourna
ment. On the No. 4 court, senior
Kim Shasby gave the Cardinal its
second point of the afternoon by de
feating Luanne Spadea in three sets,
6-2,3-6,6-3.
Shasby (15-7) took the first set,
but could not hold on in the second.
Facing a 4-3 deficit in the final set,
Shasby broke serve to tie it up and
went on to win the final two games.
In those four victorious games,
Shasby lost just three points total.
Shasbv is now 10-0 in the past three

years in NCAA team competition.
Bleszynski (18-8) also gained a
Stanford point in singles in a block
buster matchup on the No. 1 court.
Ranked No. 7 in college singles, the
Cardinal All-American met Webb,
the country's third-ranked singles

set lead by passing a charging Webb
left and right. Webb climbed back to
within 4-2 with the two players trad
ing breaks, but Bleszynski held on
for the upset, 0-6,6-3,6-2.
