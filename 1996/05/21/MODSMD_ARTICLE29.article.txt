# It's time to let athletes live their private lives
## 
### 
When I decided to join in
the investigation and
writing of the Eric
Abrams story, I did it for one rea
son. I knew that the story was
about to hit the Bay Area media,
and given some of my connections
in the Department of Athletics
and on the football team, I felt it
was my responsibility to make
sure that the initial coverage was
fair, accurate and insightful.
Since the story broke, I have
been accused of "creating news,"

"mud-slinging," and simply using
the Abrams case as an opportuni
ty to better my journalism career.
Though hurt by the comments, I
realized that as a journalist I had
to accept whatever repercussions
my articles brought about. Yet, I
constantly wondered why so
many people automatically as
sumed I was out to ruin Abrams,
rather than having faith that I
was out to tell the truth.
Now, I'm not naive — I know
reporters have a horrible reputa
tion, often thought of as "slimy"
as ambulance-chasing lawyers.
However, concomitant with that

reputation was my belief that
journalists often get a "bad rap,"
and that the same people who
complain about the media's
"muckraking" are the same peo
ple who protest when no such in
vestigating is done.
Last week, however, the inno
cence of my journalistic virginity
was plucked from me, as, for the
first time, I witnessed first-hand
the origins of the degeneracy of
my profession. I am referring to
the article Kyle Utsumi wrote
about Cardinal baseball player
Brian Dallimore. The original ar
ticle revolved solely on Dal
limore's decision to stay in school
this year and his subsequent ac
complishments on the field. The
only mention of any off-the-field
details pertaining to Dallimore's
life concerned his relationship
with his father, who coaches
baseball at UNLV.
I read the seemingly innocu
ous article and submitted it to my
bosses for further review. The ar
ticle was on its way through pro
duction when a contingent of edi
tors effectively stopped the press
es. It appeared that a portion of
the editorial staff believed that
the article must mention Dal
limore's involvement in the van
dalizing of Stanford's "Gay Lib
eration" statue.
After much debate, the verdict
came in — a paragraph was added
to include the incident of two
years ago. Thus, in Thursday's


Todd
Bernstein
Daily you read: "His career was
interrupted in November 1994
when Dallimore pled 'no contest'
to misdemeanor vandalism
charges for defacing the 'Gay Lib
eration' sculpture with a group of
student-athletes and was placed
on academic suspension for one
quarter."
It was, and will always be, my
contention that the paragraph
should not have been added.
There is a time when journalists
have to let people break from
their pasts, especially in articles
where the damaging information
is irrelevant. I am not claiming
that people should forget what
happened, or that Dallimore
should be pitied or excused for
what he pleaded no contest to. I
am also not maintaining that de
tailing someone's past in articles
is never appropriate.

Had the article been about Dal
limore, the person, I would have
accepted the final version of the
article. Had the article talked
about Dallimore's off-the-field ac
complishments, I would have
agreed with the final decision to
alter the story. Had the article
contained even one sentence about
Dallimore's character, I would
have been the first to say, "Yes,
people need to be reminded about
what happened two years ago."
Many editors and reporters
would argue with me, maintain
ing that athletes are public fig
ures and that everything they do,
both on the field and off, that is
considered "newsworthy" should
be reported on in all cases. I com
pletely disagree. There are obvi
ously two spheres in any "fa
mous" athlete's life — the per
sonal sphere and the sports
sphere.
The people who argue that all
newsworthy events should al
ways be reported believe that fea
ture articles must always reflect

both aspects of an athlete's life.
While I do not dispute the fact
that it is often necessary to write
about both slices of an athlete's
life, I refuse to swallow the fact
that the two spheres can't be sep
arated. Many believe that every
feature article that will ever be
written about Eric Abrams
should mention what happened
earlier this year. Again, I dis
agree. It is time for editors to re
alize that the two spheres of an
athlete's life can be mutually ex
clusive and that it is not always
appropriate to include the per
sonal life of an athlete in a specif
ic on-the-field feature story.
The Dallimore article was one
of these instances, and thus, no
mention of Dallimore's plea
should have ever reached Thurs
day's sports page. Instead of doing
what was right, the editors took
the only opportunity they have
had this year to remind you of, yet
again, how a group of athletes
were responsible for the vandal
ism done to the statue two vears

ago. Instead of realizing that it is
possible to praise an athlete solely
for his or her athletic ability, they
chose to use The Daily as a con
duit for telling you that even
though he can hit a baseball, he
still might be a homophobe.
When I became a "profession
al" journalist, I swore that I was
going to be different — I promised
myself that I would always take
the extra hour to get a needed
quote, that I would always go the
extra mile to balance out my arti
cles and, above all, that I would
use the power of my pen to aid, in
form and, at times, entertain my
readers. I never realized until
Thursday what an uphill battle I
am fighting.
I remember thinking on Feb.
28 (the day the Abrams story
broke), that I hoped I wasn't ru
ining Abrams' life and that even
tually he would be able to break
from his involvement in sexual
misconduct.
Now I know that the media will
never let that happen.
