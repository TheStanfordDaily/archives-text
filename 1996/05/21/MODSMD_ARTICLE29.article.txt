# It's time to let athletes live their private lives

When I decided to join in
the investigation and
writing of the Eric
Abrams story, I did it for one rea
son. I knew that the story was
about to hit the Bay Area media,
and given some of my connections
in the Department of Athletics
and on the football team, I felt it
was my responsibility to make
sure that the initial coverage was
fair, accurate and insightful.
Since the story broke, I have
been accused of "creating news,"

"mud-slinging," and simply using
the Abrams case as an opportuni
ty to better my journalism career.
Though hurt by the comments, I
realized that as a journalist I had
to accept whatever repercussions
my articles brought about. Yet, I
constantly wondered why so
many people automatically as
sumed I was out to ruin Abrams,
rather than having faith that I
was out to tell the truth.
Now, I'm not naive — I know
reporters have a horrible reputa
tion, often thought of as "slimy"
as ambulance-chasing lawyers.
However, concomitant with that

reputation was my belief that
journalists often get a "bad rap,"
and that the same people who
complain about the media's
"muckraking" are the same peo
ple who protest when no such in
vestigating is done.
Last week, however, the inno
cence of my journalistic virginity
was plucked from me, as, for the
first time, I witnessed first-hand
the origins of the degeneracy of
my profession. I am referring to
the article Kyle Utsumi wrote
about Cardinal baseball player
Brian Dallimore. The original ar
ticle revolved solely on Dal
limore's decision to stay in school
this year and his subsequent ac
complishments on the field. The
only mention of any off-the-field
details pertaining to Dallimore's
life concerned his relationship
with his father, who coaches
baseball at UNLV.
I read the seemingly innocu
ous article and submitted it to my
bosses for further review. The ar
ticle was on its way through pro
duction when a contingent of edi
tors effectively stopped the press
es. It appeared that a portion of
the editorial staff believed that
the article must mention Dal
limore's involvement in the van
dalizing of Stanford's "Gay Lib
eration" statue.
After much debate, the verdict
came in — a paragraph was added
to include the incident of two
years ago. Thus, in Thursday's
