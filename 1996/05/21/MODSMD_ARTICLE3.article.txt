# Turow entertains Kresge crowd
## 'Presumed Innocent' author gives audience a peek at his new book 
### Victoria Foster Contributing writer 
Stanford alumnus Scott Turow, au
thor of the popular novel "Presumed In
nocent," entertained a half-full Kresge
Auditorium last night with an animated
reading of his newest book.
Turow's book, titled "The Law of our
Fathers," is due to be published in two
weeks and, like "Presumed Innocent,"
centers around a murder trial. The plot
draws together a group of people who
knew each other 20 years earlier on a uni
versity campus which, Turow hinted, was
modeled after Stanford.
Turow said the book — which he

worked on for seven years — was inspired
in part by his own life experiences in the
19705, but relies primarily on his more re
cent encounters as a lawyer.
After writing "One L," a chronicle of
his first year at Harvard Law School,
Turow moved into legal practice, includ
ing doing pro-bono work for people in
housing projects in Chicago. As he became
closer to the people he represented, he was
struck with the realization that the state
of American racial relations is this soci
ety's "saddest and most tormented lega
cy."
"There are many things we don't say
about this subject. We never acknowledge
how well we've done, the achievements

that never would have taken place but for
those accomplishments" which took place
during the long struggle for racial civil
rights, he said. "But the reason why we
don't is that the plight of the poorest
African-Americans is so desperate."
Turow said he takes on this irony in
"The Law of our Fathers."
He described his work as, "a book in
many voices, from many viewpoints," and
in his hour-long reading, offered the audi
ence an animated sampling of some of the
diverse voices he alluded to.
These voices included a middle-aged
African-American small-time gang leader
