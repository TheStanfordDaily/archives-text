# Turow entertains Kresge crowd
## 'Presumed Innocent' author gives audience a peek at his new book 
### Victoria Foster Contributing writer 
Stanford alumnus Scott Turow, au
thor of the popular novel "Presumed In
nocent," entertained a half-full Kresge
Auditorium last night with an animated
reading of his newest book.
Turow's book, titled "The Law of our
Fathers," is due to be published in two
weeks and, like "Presumed Innocent,"
centers around a murder trial. The plot
draws together a group of people who
knew each other 20 years earlier on a uni
versity campus which, Turow hinted, was
modeled after Stanford.
Turow said the book — which he

worked on for seven years — was inspired
in part by his own life experiences in the
19705, but relies primarily on his more re
cent encounters as a lawyer.
After writing "One L," a chronicle of
his first year at Harvard Law School,
Turow moved into legal practice, includ
ing doing pro-bono work for people in
housing projects in Chicago. As he became
closer to the people he represented, he was
struck with the realization that the state
of American racial relations is this soci
ety's "saddest and most tormented lega
cy."
"There are many things we don't say
about this subject. We never acknowledge
how well we've done, the achievements

that never would have taken place but for
those accomplishments" which took place
during the long struggle for racial civil
rights, he said. "But the reason why we
don't is that the plight of the poorest
African-Americans is so desperate."
Turow said he takes on this irony in
"The Law of our Fathers."
He described his work as, "a book in
many voices, from many viewpoints," and
in his hour-long reading, offered the audi
ence an animated sampling of some of the
diverse voices he alluded to.
These voices included a middle-aged
African-American small-time gang leader
nicknamed "Hardcore," an old lady
who chases you ng dealers out of her
slum living room, and Seth, a
columnist of some distinction who
dated the female judge of the mur
der trial while she was a philosophy
graduate student in the '70s.
Introducing Hardcore, Turow
detailed in his own voice the streets
of u bleak city project where nightly
screams and gunfire are "sounds of
life in the extreme."
Turow then went into character,
imitating Hardcore's black vernac
ular accent and language with un
canny skill. He followed the drug
lord from his window, where he
could survey his entire operation, to
a gang shoot out in the street which
leaves a young female smuggler
maimed and a white woman dead,
or "smoked."
Turow then switched scenes,
moving to the tortured voice of
Seth, a young idealist torn between
his own anti-war passions which
push him to dodge the draft and the
pressure of his immigrant parents,
Auschwitz survivors who urge him
to compromise his beliefs.
Turow spoke in the voices of
both the U.S.-born Seth and his
heavily accented German parents.
Asked where he learned the ac
cents, Turow said, "I've always been
very lucky — I only speak English,
but I hear very well for a writer."
He said he has not formally stud
ied the black vernacular speech pat
terns he used in the voice of Hard
core, but was influenced by a book
written by the former "Monster
Kobe" of the Los Angeles Crips.
