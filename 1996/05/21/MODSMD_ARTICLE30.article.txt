# Stanford to renew rivalry with Bruins
## Conference rivals to face off for fourth time this season 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — If the Stanford men's
tennis team thought yesterday's semifinal
match against the Georgia Bulldogs was a
( dogfight, then wait until it gets thrown to the
Bruins today in the final round of the NCAA
Team Championships.
More firepower. More depth. More head
to-head success against the Cardinal.
In eveiy category aside from home court
advantage, the Bruins will be a decidedly more
formidable opponent than the Bulldogs, and
moreover, most observers would say that on
paper UCLA's starting six should beat their
Cardinal counterparts in today's dual match.
Stanford has already been defeated by the
Bruins three times this year. Only once — a 4-
3 victory at Stanford — was the match tightly
contested.
Starring for UCLA is the nation's top
ranked college player, Justin Gimelstob, who
has been virtually unbeatable in his sopho
more year. He has Jeff Salzenstein's number,
having defeated Stanford's senior captain
each of the last three times they have met.
Yesterday, Gimelstob took apart the nation's
No. 2 player, Paul Robinson of Texas Christ
ian, by a count of 7-5,6-0.
Elsewhere in the Bruin lineup, there are
few apparent weaknesses. Their top three
players are a combined 10-0 against Stanford
opponents this year. Their No. 5 player, Matt
Breen, is 2-0 in head-to-head competition
