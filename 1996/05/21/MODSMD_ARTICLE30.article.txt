# Stanford to renew rivalry with Bruins
## Conference rivals to face off for fourth time this season 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — If the Stanford men's
tennis team thought yesterday's semifinal
match against the Georgia Bulldogs was a
( dogfight, then wait until it gets thrown to the
Bruins today in the final round of the NCAA
Team Championships.
More firepower. More depth. More head
to-head success against the Cardinal.
In eveiy category aside from home court
advantage, the Bruins will be a decidedly more
formidable opponent than the Bulldogs, and
moreover, most observers would say that on
paper UCLA's starting six should beat their
Cardinal counterparts in today's dual match.
Stanford has already been defeated by the
Bruins three times this year. Only once — a 4-
3 victory at Stanford — was the match tightly
contested.
Starring for UCLA is the nation's top
ranked college player, Justin Gimelstob, who
has been virtually unbeatable in his sopho
more year. He has Jeff Salzenstein's number,
having defeated Stanford's senior captain
each of the last three times they have met.
Yesterday, Gimelstob took apart the nation's
No. 2 player, Paul Robinson of Texas Christ
ian, by a count of 7-5,6-0.
Elsewhere in the Bruin lineup, there are
few apparent weaknesses. Their top three
players are a combined 10-0 against Stanford
opponents this year. Their No. 5 player, Matt
Breen, is 2-0 in head-to-head competition

Senior captain Jeff Salzenstein prepares to power a forehand by a USC opponent in Sunday's
match. Yesterday, Salzenstein rolled to a 6-0, 6-3 victory over his Georgia opponent, Steven
Baldas, as Stanford edged out the Bulldogs 4-3.
against Stanford's No. 5, Grant El
liott, while their lone weakness
against Stanford has been at No. 6
singles, where Vincent Allegre has
dropped three out of three matches
to Rickv Becker.

Looking at the two teams' roads
to the final, it is apparent that
Stanford has had to work harder to
win its last two matches. UCLA's
only scare came in the first round
against an upstart team from New
Mexico. The Lobos lasted five
hours with the mighty Bruins be
fore bowing out by a 4-2 margin.
Last year, it was Stanford that
marched to the final with an unde

feated record after having beaten
UCLA in the semifinals for the
fourth time in 1995.
In a dramatic reversal of roles,
this year's Bruin squad has
amassed a 27-0 record and needs a
fourth victory over Stanford to be
come the first team to duplicate the
Cardinal's undefeated dream sea
sons of 1978 and 1995.
Even though UCIJ\ might seem

to "want" a championship more
than a team like Stanford, which
has already tasted victory in
Athens, this should not much af
fect the outcome of tomorrow's
match. What ought to worry Stan
ford head coach Dick Gould, how
ever, is the possibility of a letdown
after yesterday's emotional victo
ry-
However, when asked about

avoiding the letdown, Salzenstein
points out dryly, "We will be play
ing in the finals of the national
championship. That should an
sweryour question."
If the letdown is avoided, Stan
ford will still have to overcome
their on-paper shortcomings. In
order to this, it will take what
coaches call "heart."
According to Georgia head

coach Manuel Diaz, "UCLA has the
material to win a national champi
onship, but you can't ever count
Stanford out. They have been there
before. It's going to be a great
final."
And, oh, there will be one more
incentive for both teams to play
well: the match will be televised
(tape delayed) on ESPN, Thurs
day, May 23 at 10:30 a.m. PST.
