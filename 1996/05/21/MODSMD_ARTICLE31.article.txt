# Track and field finishes in middle of pack
## Teams enjoy success despite taking fifth and sixth places at Pac-10s 
### Sam Wang Staff writer 
Winning does not always dic
tate success and losing does not al
ways equate failure.
This is the mindset that must
be taken when the results of last
weekend's Pacific 10 Conference
Track and Field Championships
are examined.
Despite seemingly ho-hum fin
ishes by both the Stanford men
and women's teams at the two-day
competition, solid team-wide per
formances fostered a sense of opti
mism that permeates the Stanford
track and field program.
The Cardinal men chalked up
80.5 points to come in sixth, only
17 points short of third-place
Washington. The women's team
came in fifth place after ringing up
69 points, fallingjust seven points
shy of fourth-place Washington.
UCIxA tallied 151 points to cap
ture the men's crown. The women
of USC secured the championship
also with a score of 151.
"I thought the team really did a
good job," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "I evaluate success not
just on the basis of scores or team
standings, but the ability to pro
duce a solid team."
Senior Mark Fadil, who came in
third in the 3,000 meter steeple
chase concurs with Lananna.

"I think the team performed
very well. Sixth place might not
sound very good, but we were
right there," Fadil said. "We had
some really big performances. We
had people score in almost every
event which is a good indication of
a well-rounded team."
The men's team scored in 16 of
19 events, while the women tallied
in 17 of 18. Nineteen Stanford
athletes placed in the top five,
with 11 Cardinal athletes putting
up personal-bests during the
weekend.
While no Cardinal placed in the
top spot, three athletes were able
come in second.
Senior Dena Dey ran the 1,500
in 4:24.12, just a half-second shy
of first place.
Junior Greg Jimmerson
teamed with senior Rob Reeder to
come in two-three in the 5,000.
Jimmerson ran a 14:21.92 while
Reeder sped to a personal-best
14:22.14.
Jimmie Johnson, a junior
sprinter, also came in second
when he blazed to a career-best of
46.17 in the 400-meter dash. He
then came back to team with ju
nior Tad Heath, freshman Jauron
Pigg and sophomore Jeff Allen,
who earlier placed third in the
400-meter hurdles, to put the Car
