# Track and field finishes in middle of pack
## Teams enjoy success despite taking fifth and sixth places at Pac-10s 
### Sam Wang Staff writer 
Winning does not always dic
tate success and losing does not al
ways equate failure.
This is the mindset that must
be taken when the results of last
weekend's Pacific 10 Conference
Track and Field Championships
are examined.
Despite seemingly ho-hum fin
ishes by both the Stanford men
and women's teams at the two-day
competition, solid team-wide per
formances fostered a sense of opti
mism that permeates the Stanford
track and field program.
The Cardinal men chalked up
80.5 points to come in sixth, only
17 points short of third-place
Washington. The women's team
came in fifth place after ringing up
69 points, fallingjust seven points
shy of fourth-place Washington.
UCIxA tallied 151 points to cap
ture the men's crown. The women
of USC secured the championship
also with a score of 151.
"I thought the team really did a
good job," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "I evaluate success not
just on the basis of scores or team
standings, but the ability to pro
duce a solid team."
Senior Mark Fadil, who came in
third in the 3,000 meter steeple
chase concurs with Lananna.

"I think the team performed
very well. Sixth place might not
sound very good, but we were
right there," Fadil said. "We had
some really big performances. We
had people score in almost every
event which is a good indication of
a well-rounded team."
The men's team scored in 16 of
19 events, while the women tallied
in 17 of 18. Nineteen Stanford
athletes placed in the top five,
with 11 Cardinal athletes putting
up personal-bests during the
weekend.
While no Cardinal placed in the
top spot, three athletes were able
come in second.
Senior Dena Dey ran the 1,500
in 4:24.12, just a half-second shy
of first place.
Junior Greg Jimmerson
teamed with senior Rob Reeder to
come in two-three in the 5,000.
Jimmerson ran a 14:21.92 while
Reeder sped to a personal-best
14:22.14.
Jimmie Johnson, a junior
sprinter, also came in second
when he blazed to a career-best of
46.17 in the 400-meter dash. He
then came back to team with ju
nior Tad Heath, freshman Jauron
Pigg and sophomore Jeff Allen,
who earlier placed third in the
400-meter hurdles, to put the Car

dinal 4 x 400 relay team into third
place.
Sophomore runner Sarna Ren
fro was among the many to come
up big for the women's team. She
placed third in the 3,000 at 9:19.61
and fourth in the 5,000 at
16.22.74.
"I scored some points which
benefited out team and scoring
team points is what Pac-lOs is all
about. So I was glad I was able to
contribute that way," Renfro said.
"(But] I was a little frustrated
because I felt like in each race I
could have grabbed another place
to help us in the point total. With
300 (meters] to go, you have to
make the decision that when the
leaders go, you're going to go with
them. For me that decision just
came a little too late in each race."
Freshman Tracye Lawyer also
provided scoring punch for the
women. She tied her personal-best
at 5 feet-10 3/4 inches, good
enough for in third-place.
Coming off a sub-par high jump
performance in last week's Pac-10
Heptathlon Championships,
Lawyer entered last weekend's
competition with shaken confi
dence.
"I was very pleased with my
high jump," Lawyer said. "I was
going in a little worried but when I
got into a rhythm everything be
came OK."
Last weekend's performance is
yet another encouraging step
taken by the Stanford track pro
gram. Both the men and women
showed signs for even more im
provements next year.
"We scored points across the
board, in all events," Renfro said.
"That really speaks highly of our
team in terms of where our pro
gram is going. We keep moving up
a couple of places each year.
"Our team is good and we're ex
cited for the step we made this year
and where we're going to be
going."
Lananna is just as excited and
optimistic for Stanford's chances.
