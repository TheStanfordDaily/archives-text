# All-American pleases both old and young
## 
### Kyle Utsumi Senior staff writer 
Afler the final out has been made at Sunken Di
amond, the young voices can immediately be
heard.
"A.J., A.J., sign my ball. Pleeeze?"
And if you pause to listen in on a post-game
conversation between the older fans, they are like
ly to be talking with wonder about another spec
tacular day at the plate for Stanford's fan-favorite,
A.J. Hinch.
Hinch, a four-year starter behind the plate, is
everyone's All-American. He has proved it on the
field, earning consensus first-team All-American
honors as a junior in 1995 and first-team on the
Smith Super Team in 1994. In 1993, Hinch was
named a Freshman All-American.
However, the native of Midwest City, Okla
homa, has also proved himself to be an All-Ameri
can off the field. Hinch is loved and respected by
Stanford fans of all ages, from the very young to
the very old.
"I think the way he handles himself publicly,
and the type of person he is off the field — it's "All-
American," said Cardinal coach Mark Marquess.
"He's the All-American player, the All-American
young man. I don't think you can find a better
young man when you combine his baseball tiilent
and all the other things that go into the complete
person."
Hinch speaks often about giving back to the
fans in appreciation for their support.
"I love being around kids and speaking to
them," Hinch said. "I think athletes in general
don't pay enough attention to how much they can
affect other people's lives. I want to make any im
pact I can, whether it's by signing a ball, or taking
a picture with someone, or just talking to them."
"He's involved with people, he's a people per
son," Marquess said. "He relates well to older re
tired people, middle-aged people, teammates,
kids, whatever — he's a very special young man."
Hinch understands what it means to be a fan
because he remembers how it felt to be one.

"I used to watch Oklahoma and Oklahoma
State play baseball," Hinch recalled. "Those guys
were my idols — I remember how good I felt when
they paid attention to me. Now I'm glad that I can
be a role model."
While Hinch speaks of idolizing those college
baseball players as a youngster, his true hero has
always been his father, Dennis Hinch.
The father and son spoke on the phone afler
Hinch tagged his first collegiate home run on Feb
ruary 5 of his freshman year. The long-ball was a
dramatic one, as Hinch connected on a two-out,
two-run blast on an 0-2 pitch in the bottom of the
ninth to give the Cardinal a 4-3 victory over rival
Fullerton State.
That conversation turned out to be the last be
tween Hinch and his father, as Dennis Hinch
passed away of a heart attack the next day at the
age of 39.
"I had struck out three times in that game be
fore hitting the game-winning home run," Hinch
said. "It was a bittersweet game and the game that
is closest to my heart.
"My dad was my biggest hero," Hinch contin
ued. "He taught me a lot about life. He was my
best friend as well as my father. I think about the
impact he made on people — he was the type of fa
ther, husband and friend that I want to be."
Hinch will have a chance to reach out to a
worldwide audience this summer in Atlanta as a
member of the United States Olympic Team. A
third-round draft choice of the Minnesota Twins
afler his junior year, Hinch opted to return to
Stanford in 1996, a choice which was made par
tially with the Olympics in mind. Hinch was the
only player guaranteed a spot on the Olympic
team, and will likely be the starting catcher at the
Games this summer.
"Once I play in the Olympics, it will become a
reality," said Hinch, who has spoken about the
Games and his decision to remain in school to
droves of media. "All the hard work, the ques
tions, the critics — it will all be worth it and it will
finally hit me as a reality."
It seems the decision he made was as good as

gold, as Hinch has returned to the field in his se
nior year to post the most impressive stats of his
career, much to the pleasure of Marquess.
"The thing that's amazed me about AJ. is that
he's had his best year offensively this year," Mar
quess said. "Not because he doesn't have the abil
ity but because most people aren't going to pitch to
him. Teams are very conscious about not letting
him beat them.
"It's been his best year and that's saying some
thing because he's had so much to live up to and a
lot of pressure on him," Mtirquess added.
All I linch has done this year is bat .403 with 55
RBIs and 11 home runs on his way to earning Pa
cific 10 Southern Division Player of the Year hon
ors. Hinch shared Six-Pac Player of the Year Hon
ors with USC's Geoff Jenkins.
As the Cardinal heads into NCAA Regional
play this week at Sunken Diamond, Hinch will
look to lead the team back to the College World Se
ries in Omaha.
"Individually, regardless of whether we make
it, I'm proud of what I've done here," Hinch said.
"But if we don't make it back, there will Ik 1 a dark
cloud over my career. I would take a less success
ful individual year for the chance to go back to
Omaha. We've got a legitimate shot at going and
winning the thing."
No matter what the final outcome of this sea
son is, Hinch says he will have no regrets about the
decisions he has made.
"I'm going to do everything I came back to
school for," Hinch said. "I'm graduating, I'll get
drafted, I'll play in t he Olympics and now I have a
chance to go to the College World Series. If I had it
all to do over again, I'd make the same decision."
Hinch won't be on the Farm next year, but you
can be sure that the kids will miss him and the
older fans will be reminiscing about his on-the
field abilities mid his off-the-field likability.
"He's almost too good to be true," Marquess
said. "He's a great representative of S Urn ford
baseball, the University and of the USA"
Afler all, A.J. Hinch is everybody's All-Ameri
can.

nior year to post the most impressive stats of his
career, much to the pleasure of Marquess.
"The thing that's amazed me about AJ. is that
he's had his best year offensively this year," Mar
quess said. "Not because he doesn't have the abil
ity but because most people aren't going to pitch to
him. Teams are very conscious about not letting
him beat them.
"It's been his best year and that's saying some
thing because he's had so much to live up to and a
lot of pressure on him," Mtirquess added.
All I linch has done this year is bat .403 with 55
RBIs and 11 home runs on his way to earning Pa
cific 10 Southern Division Player of the Year hon
ors. Hinch shared Six-Pac Player of the Year Hon
ors with USC's Geoff Jenkins.
As the Cardinal heads into NCAA Regional
play this week at Sunken Diamond, Hinch will
look to lead the team back to the College World Se
ries in Omaha.
"Individually, regardless of whether we make
it, I'm proud of what I've done here," Hinch said.
"But if we don't make it back, there will Ik 1 a dark
cloud over my career. I would take a less success
ful individual year for the chance to go back to
Omaha. We've got a legitimate shot at going and
winning the thing."
No matter what the final outcome of this sea
son is, Hinch says he will have no regrets about the
decisions he has made.
"I'm going to do everything I came back to
school for," Hinch said. "I'm graduating, I'll get
drafted, I'll play in t he Olympics and now I have a
chance to go to the College World Series. If I had it
all to do over again, I'd make the same decision."
Hinch won't be on the Farm next year, but you
can be sure that the kids will miss him and the
older fans will be reminiscing about his on-the
field abilities mid his off-the-field likability.
"He's almost too good to be true," Marquess
said. "He's a great representative of S Urn ford
baseball, the University and of the USA"
Afler all, A.J. Hinch is everybody's All-Ameri
can.
