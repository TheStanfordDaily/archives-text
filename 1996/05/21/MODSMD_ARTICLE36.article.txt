# Renovation campaign gets a $20M boost from donors
## 
### Alex Scherbakovsky Contributing writer 
Stanford's Restoration Fund is $20 million closer
to achieving a goal of raising $50 million thanks to
large donations from three families who have long
standing relationships with the University.
The campaign was launched by the University
Board of Trustees in April 1994 to facilitate the re
building and reinforcement of various campus struc
tures including the Quad and the west wing of Green
Library. Only $10 million more is needed to fulfill the
campaign's goal.
David Glen, director of principal gifts for the Of
fice of Development, expressed satisfaction with the
campaign results.
"We are very pleased with the fund-raising suc
cess that we have had that has allowed us to begin
and in some cases to already complete the recon
struction and reinforcement of earthquake-damaged
buildings," said Glen.
The gift will not speed up the construction occur
ring on campus, which is scheduled to be concluded
by 2000, he said.
"A lot of work that is going on right now is not be
cause of the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989," said
Glen. "We are trying to reinforce buildings to make
them conform to more stringent safety codes so as to
prepare them for any future earthquakes."
The three families that made the recent contribu

tions are the Pigotts, the Brauns and the Lanes.
The Pigott family's ties to the University stretch
back to the 19205, University Trustee Charles Pigott
said in a statement. As an engineering student at
Stanford, Pigott spent a great deal of his time at the
former Engineering Corner, currently known as
Language Corner.
To recognize the generosity of major donors, Stan
ford offers the donors a choice of having their names
associated with campus structures and rooms that
have not yet been named after other gift givers.
In recognition of the Pigott family's gift, Lan
guage Corner will be renamed Pigott Hall.
The Braun family's connection with Stanford
originated during the University's founding. The
family's gift to Quad rebuilding will be recognized by
renaming Geology Corner to Braun Corner.
The Lanes' support of the University dates back to
the family's restoration of the Stanford Red Barn
and continues with their support of the work on the
Stanford Governor's Mansion in Sacramento.
History Corner will be renamed Lane History Cor
ner to commemorate the family's gift.
"Each of the three donor families has long and
deep involvement with Stanford," Glen said. "Affili
ating their names with corners of the historic Stan
ford Quadrangle, a representation of the 'original
Stanford,' is a way to honor these families."
Dedication ceremonies for the newly renamed
buildings are expected to be held in the fall.
