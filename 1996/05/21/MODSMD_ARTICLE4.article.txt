# UCSF merger plans on track at Stanford
## Medical workers seem less worried here 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
The recent controversy over the merger
between Stanford Health Services and the
UC-San Francisco medical center does not
seem to have derailed Stanford's plans for
the move, nor has the prospect of merging
yet created problems with unions and ad
ministrators here, as it has at UCSF, ac
cording to employees at the Stanford Med
ical Center.
At a meeting of the UC Board of Regents
Wednesday, union officials representing
UCSF workers said they were disturbed by
a perceived lack of openness in the merger
negotiations. Many expressed deep opposi
tion to the move.
At the same meeting, some regents said
they "had problems" with the merger's fast
pace and the limited time the board had to
gather information and consider the move;
many members suggested the project might
have to be delayed.
Reacting to the regents' concerns, SHS
President Peter Van Etten admitted that
"it's not surprising" that the regents would
have complicated questions about such a
complicated issue.
"Hopefully we'll be able to resolve these
issues in the near future," Van Etten said,
adding that both SHS and UCSF adminis
trators hope that "some clear direction
could be reached in the next month or two."

He explained that the merger could not
be deliberated indefinitely because pro
longed negotiations would be an obstacle to
the regular operation of both medical cen
ters.
"The uncertainty that exists is destabi
lizing," Van Etten said, citingas an example
the difficulty of recruiting and hiring new
employees while in the middle of a merger.
The proposal also needs the approval of
Stanford's Board of Trustees, which Van
Etten said is scheduled to discuss the mat
ter at its meeting next month.
Van Etten said he did not yet know
whether to expect any action from the
trustees at that time. Though he did not
want to speculate about what concerns they
might raise, he did note that "clearly, there
will be issues of concern, just as there are
among the regents."
One of these issues revolves around the
unions at UCSF, who have been opposing
the merger for weeks. Nick Jones of the Cal
ifornia Association of Interns and Residents
said the merger would "drive down wages
and benefits" and cause layoffs that would
lead to understaffing and hurt patient care.
"It's going to have a devastating effect on
the Bay Area," Jones added.
Many union officials at UCSF also ex
pressed concern that the move was being
steamrolled through without the public's
