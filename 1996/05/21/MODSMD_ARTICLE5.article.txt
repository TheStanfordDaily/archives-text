# Wasow to take position as graduate policy dean
## 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
Linguistics and Philosophy Prof. Thomas
Wasow has been named associate dean of
graduate policy, replacing English Prof.
George Dekker.
Wasow, who previously held administra
tive positions as dean of undergraduate stud
ies and associate dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences, currently serves as the
director of the Program in Symbolic Systems.
He will begin his new half-time job on Sept. 1.
"I plan to learn the job and take it from
there," said Wasow, adding that he brings no
specific agenda to the new position. "I sus
pect that my focus may be more on funding
issues, on issues of employment."
The position of associate dean, which falls
under Dean of Research Charles Kruger, was
created three years ago to centralize and give
more time to graduate student issues,
Dekker said. Graduate education is basically
run by individual departments.
"There was a huge need to try to make
sure that the policies that we have were ar
ticulated in a clear way and in a way that was
available to graduate students, student ser
vices staff and faculty," Dekker said.
The associate dean serves for three years;

Dekker's term ends this summer.
"I have the highest regard for IWasow] as
a faculty member and as an academic,"
Kruger said. "I'm sure Tom will have new
problems that will come up and new solu
tions for them."
For Dekker, new problems did arise, al
though he said he anticipated some of the is
sues during his tenure.
"In a decentralized graduate environment,
there simply is a huge need for information
and for trying to make complex procedures
and regulations clearer, so I don't think that
those problems never change," Dekker said.
"New problems keep cropping up."
Wasow received his linguistics doctorate
from MIT in 1972, came to Stanford the fol
lowing year and chaired the Linguistics De
partment in 1983-84. He directed the Center
for the Studv of Language and Information
in 1986-87.
The most current graduate policy issue is
the new Graduate Fellows program, an
nounced by University President Gerhard
Casper on May 9. The program — and its
$200 million fund-raising campaign — aims
to bring 100 of the world's top graduate stu
dents to Stanford each year for three years,
where the fellows will be allowed
to choose their own topic of re
search.
In addition, the upcoming loss of
tuition remission funding for grad
uate students has required
Kruger's office to re-evaluate grad
uate student funding, and Wasow
said he will likely be called upon to
launch new proposals.
"Actually implementing the
new system will undoubtedly take
some close attention," he said.
Wasow also praised Dekker's
work on improving student ser
vices and vowed to continue it dur
ing his three-year tenure as associ
ate dean.
