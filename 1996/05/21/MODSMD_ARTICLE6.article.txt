# Chappie ticket stresses action
## Quandt and Olding focus on tangible student advocacy 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
Margot Quandt and Ben Olding would like to be
remembered as the ASSU president and vice presi
dent who provided tangible responses to student
concerns — like bringing more Stairmasters to
Stanford.
The two sophomores are running for those of
fices, respectively, on the Chaparral's Hammer and
Coffin ticket in this week's ASSU election, sched
uled to take place tomorrow and Thursday. The
Stairmaster initiative typifies their broad cam
paign goal of rethinking the role of student govern
ment.
"Our first priority would be to move the focus of
the student government from what it is to what it
does," Quandt said. "I would be a representative of
the student body to the administration rather than
an expert on the specifics of student government."
Criticizing the current ASSU Senate and Coun
cil of Presidents, Quandt said neither institution
fulfills its primary role of student advocacy. No
group, Olding commented, effectively addresses
the true concerns of the student body.
"A lot gets lost," he said. "The thing we find
most ridiculous is that the administration is just
running away with this school, and no one is doing
anything to stop it."
The ticket promises to take initiative in building
strong, long-lasting lines of communication be
tween the executive branch of the ASSU and the

University administration.
"We will set up pathways to make the adminis
tration aware of our concerns. We need to get them
used to hearing from us," Olding said.
But Olding said that as vice president, he would
pursue his goals independent of the senate, which,
under "Constitution '96," he would be entitled to
chair.
"The senate can drag everyone down," Olding
said. "We'll take as much initiative as needed to ac
complish our goals. We'll drag [the senate) behind
kicking and screaming if we have to."
The ticket, however, shrugged off addressing the
specifics of transferring ASSU power from a four
person council to a single president.
"The [constitutional] transition has been typi
fied by indecision. We want to be the antithesis of a
COP. We won't focus on the past; we will focus on
the future," Olding said.
Like their opponents, Quandt and Olding said
they would seek greater student involvement in the
management of Tresidder Union, citing an appar
ent loss of student control over the union as one of
the greatest examples of ASSU bungling.
Despite the seriousness with which the pair ap
proach campaign issues, in true Hammer and Cof
fin style, Quandt and Olding are not without a
sense of humor.
Neither were able to offer strong, substantive
reasons why they, rather than their competitors,
should be president and vice
president, but Olding drew one

comparison between their slate
and another ticket.
"Margot's more attractive
than Bill Shen, and I bathe more
often than Nick Thompson," he
said. "I don't know what else to
say."
