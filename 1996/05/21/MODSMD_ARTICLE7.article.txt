## Stanford students teach youth the finer points of forensics 
### Hugh Handeyside 
"American cultural unity is when everyone ac
cepts everyone else's beliefs but they don't neces
sarily believe in them themselves," contends Eliz
abeth Yin, an eighth-grader at Castilleja School in
Palo Alto, as she concludes an affirmative debate
speech.
"That took you two minutes," returns Stanford

sophomore Ravi Belani. "Now I want you to say the
same thing in one minute."
Belani is a debate coach for Stanford Youth
Forensics, a group he established this year. The
group travels to Castilleja three times each week to
coach students in debate, individual events and
mock congressional speaking.

The group is composed of stu
dents who competed in forensics
during high schooi but did not
nave either the time or the desire
to continue at Stanford. Al
though most people are used to
hearing the word in relation to
dead bodies, forensics also de
notes debate and individual
speaking events, both interpre
tive and rhetorical.
Belani said he is interested in
forensics because of his experi
ences in high school. "I didn't have
the zeal to kill that you need to
compete on the college level," said
Belani, a two-time California state
champion in extemporaneous
speaking, "and at the same time I
love teaching." He decided that
Stanford Youth Forensics would
be the perfect alternative to com
peting in college.
Because neither Castilleja nor
Palo Alto High School hire full
time forensics teachers, Stanford
students have assumed the re
sponsibility as volunteers. Al
though this is the first year there
has been an organized group of
coaches, several students offered
to teach forensics after the last
coach left Palo Alto High in 1989.
The students have since managed
to devote as much time as any nor
mal coach, despite the enormous
commitment.
Senior Andrew Morse has been
the unpaid head coach since 1992,

teaching during the week and at
tending tournaments on the
weekends. Under Morse's direc
tion, Palo Alto High School stu
dents have experienced much suc
cess in the Coast Forensics
League, attending the state tour
nament every year and winning
the prestigious Berkeley Invita
tional and the Tournament of
Champions.
Morse attributed the students'
success to the fact that the activity
is extracurricular. "Motivation
here is a big deal. It is an extracur
ricular activity and people that do
this want to be doing it," said
Morse.
Palo Alto High School senior
Greg Ludvik, a debater who will
attend UC-Berkeley next year,
echoed Morse. "We're doing this
because we want to, not because
we have to," said Ludvik.
Although Stanford Youth
Forensics currently teaches only
at Castilleja, Belani is confident
that the group will soon be able to
cover Palo Alto High School as
well.
Belani said he feels having a
larger group of students coaching
their areas of interest not only dis
tributes responsibility, but also
improves the quality of the coach
ing. "If I went in there and tried to
coach interpretive events, I'd
probably make the students worse
off than they were beforehand,
but having students coaching
their specific interests really
helps."
Belani suggested that students
are more receptive to college

teachers than they would be to
adults: "They respect [us] enough
because [we] know enough about
the issues, and yet they can talk to
[us]."
This rapport between teacher
and student is evident in the class
room. The students laugh and
joke with Belani as he teaches
word economy and cross-examina
tion techniques. Eighth-grader
Carolyn Cobey said of her adult
teachers, "They're too old. College
students can definitely remember
what it's like to be our age."
Ludvik agreed that the close
ness in age between the students
and teachers makes the learning
environment more relaxed. "Hav
ing college students as judges
made it easier to relate to them be
cause they're closer in age," he
said. With a glance toward Morse,
he added, "Plus we get to hear all
their life lessons."
Not all of the coaches' motiva
tion is altruistic. They agreed that
the most rewarding part of volun
teering so much of their time is the
interaction with the students. Ac
cording to the coaches, escaping
the monotony of campus life and
dealing with motivated students
makes coaching an attractive di
version.
Said Belani, "It's like doing a
lot of fun things at once. It's an ego
trip; having students write down
what I say is really fun."
Morse agreed. "The thing that
gets me out of bed in the morning
is that I get to go and interact with
the students and laugh and have a
good time," he said.
