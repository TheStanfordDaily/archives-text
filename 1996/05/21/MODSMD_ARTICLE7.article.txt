"American cultural unity is when everyone ac
cepts everyone else's beliefs but they don't neces

Belani is a debate coach for Stanford Youth
Forensics, a group he established this year. The
group travels to Castilleja three times each week to
coach students in debate, individual events and
mock congressional speaking.
