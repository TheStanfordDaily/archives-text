ATHENS, Ga. — The Cardinal mystique is alive
and well here.
Yesterday afternoon the Stanford men's tennis
team won its 14th national championship by up
setting the No. 1 and previously undefeated UCLA
Bruins 4-1 at the Dan Magill Tennis Complex. But
perhaps even more impressive, it was Stanford's
12th crown in the last 20 years since the advent of
the current NCAA tournament format.
"There is definitely something about Stanford
that I just can't figure out. It's something magi
cal," said Stanford senior and two-time captain
Jeff Salzenstein. "I think it starts with (head)
coach (Dick) Gould. He really motivates me, and I
think the whole team."
It would be tough to argue with Salzenstein's
logic. Since Gould took over the Stanford tennis
program 30 years ago, his team has won a nation-

al title almost as many years as it hasn't. He has created a remarkable
dynasty; his teams have accumulated a 586-122 (.828) record.
However, while Stanford's regular seasons have made up the bulk
of that record, Gould's team shines brightest in the post season. The
Cardinal has an incredible 61-6 (.910) record in NCAA tournament
play.
Four of those wins came this year, as Stanford made it through the
roughest of roads on the way to the finals, knocking off Texas 4-0, USC
4-1 and Georgia 4-3. In the Georgia battle, the Bulldogs had three
match points in the deciding sixth singles match. Cardinal senior Ricky
Becker was able to fight off all three points, however, and propelled
Stanford into the final matchup with UCLA.
UCLA had thrice defeated the Cardinal this year, and the Bruins
had rolled through the tournament showing no signs of weakness. Ac
tually, the Bruins had rolled through the entire year without exhibit
ing so much as a single chink in their tennis armor. All indications
pointed to a perfect season and national championship for UCLA.
The Bruins appeared to be on championship course as they blew
past Stanford to start the match, winning the doubles point with a 9-8

(7-5) win at first doubles and a 9-7 victory at third doubles.
Down one point going into the singles competition, prospects looked
bleak for Stanford. No Cardinal player had won a match against the
Bruins' top three all year, and there was little to suggest that UCLA's
No. 1 Justin Gimelstob, No. 17 Srdjan Muskatirovic or No. 27 Eric
Taino were going to let that statistic change. Thus, Gould realized the
need for tough play at the bottom of the lineup.
That is exactly what the "Road Warriors" did. Stanford's four, five
and six singles players are Jim Thomas, Grant Elliott and Ricky Beck
er, respectively. The three dubbed themselves the "Road Warriors" be
cause they always had to travel to the far courts to play their matches.
Each of the "Warriors" ousted his UCLA counterpart to score Stan
ford's first three points in the match.
Becker (No. 54), still riding high off his match-clinching win over
Georgia, beat Vincent Allegre 6-4, 6-2 to start things off for Stanford.
Becker is the only player this season to beat the Bruin freshman in a
dual match, and he has done it four consecutive times.
Elliott (No. 99) was next off the courts, giving Stanford a 2-1 lead
with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Matt Breen (No. 88). Breen had beaten Elliott
in straight sets the last two times they had met, but the Cardinal junior
showed his experience, maintaining his composure in a very tight sec
ond set.
Meanwhile Thomas had taken the first set of his match with a 7-3
tie-break victory, and was only just beginning his second set. It was
typical Thomas tennis, calm and deliberate.
"Jim is kind of a tainted 'Road Warrior' because he goes too slow,"
said Becker earlier this year. "To be a true 'Warrior,' you've got to be
crash and burn."
Well, Thomas, wasn't crashing or burning, but he was perfectly ex
ecuting his game plan, pressuring his opponent, Heath Montgomery,
to pass him at the net. Montgomery wasn't up to the task, as the 6-4
Stanford senior utilized his height and reach to smother all balls com
ing his way. He closed out the match with a 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 victory.
"I knew Jim was going to win because, well, because he's Jim," said
a giddy Salzenstein at the post-match press conference. And why
shouldn't Salzenstein, and for that matter everyone, have felt that
way? Thomas has an unblemished 9-0 record at fourth singles this
year, and has proven all season long that he can be depended on to win
his point.
Usually, however, Stanford doesn't even need his point. Because
Thomas operates so deliberately, he has only finished four of his 12
tournament matches. He has won all of them, for a 4-0 mark.
As Thomas's match was closing down, action on the top three courts
was fast and furious. Salzenstein (No. 4) was in an intense struggle on
the first court against Gimelstob (No. 1). After losing the first set, 6-4,
the Cardinal captain fought back to take the second, 6-1. The quality
of tennis was excellent, as both players proved deserving of their high
ranking. Neither player could gain the edge for an extended amount of
time and the stars traded one break each and three service holds to
push the match to 4-4 in the decisive set.
On court two, Paul Goldstein (No. 28), was also engaged in a tight
third set. Muskatirovic (No. 17), had beaten Goldstein in straight
sets in both teams' last regular season match, but the Stanford
sophomore had given the lanky 6-4 Yugoslavian all he could handle in
the first two sets. Goldstein kept his crisp-volleying opponent off the
net by charging it himself, and seemed to be on the verge of taking
over in the third.
However, the second and third singles matches, as exciting as they
were, never received the opportunity to conclude. Less than two min
utes after Thomas had secured the third Stanford point, Ryan Wolters
(No. 11) found himself with a match point in his third singles bout
with Taino (No. 27). Taino was serving at 2-5 in the third, desperate
ly trying to breathe life back into his match and into the entire Bruin
team.
The eighth game of the deciding set went to deuce, but Wolters
gained the advantage when Taino sailed a backhand too deep. The
Bruin junior stepped up to the challenge, and nailed a service winner
down the middle to stay alive.
Wolters again gained the advantage, this time with a winner of his
own. The UCLA southpaw unleashed a powerful serve to start the sec
ond match point, but two strokes later, Stanford's freshman phenom
drilled a backhand cross-court, and a lunging Taino was unable to vol
ley the ball back into the court.
"I had been looking at the other courts, so I sort of knew we were
winning," Wolters said after the match. "I was just excited I won. Then
when everyone ran out to hug me I realized that my match was the
clincher."

Becker was able to fight off all three points, however, and propelled
Stanford into the final matchup with UCLA.
UCLA had thrice defeated the Cardinal this year, and the Bruins
had rolled through the tournament showing no signs of weakness. Ac
tually, the Bruins had rolled through the entire year without exhibit
ing so much as a single chink in their tennis armor. All indications
pointed to a perfect season and national championship for UCLA.
The Bruins appeared to be on championship course as they blew
past Stanford to start the match, winning the doubles point with a 9-8

(7-5) win at first doubles and a 9-7 victory at third doubles.
Down one point going into the singles competition, prospects looked
bleak for Stanford. No Cardinal player had won a match against the
Bruins' top three all year, and there was little to suggest that UCLA's
No. 1 Justin Gimelstob, No. 17 Srdjan Muskatirovic or No. 27 Eric
Taino were going to let that statistic change. Thus, Gould realized the
need for tough play at the bottom of the lineup.
That is exactly what the "Road Warriors" did. Stanford's four, five
and six singles players are Jim Thomas, Grant Elliott and Ricky Beck
er, respectively. The three dubbed themselves the "Road Warriors" be
cause they always had to travel to the far courts to play their matches.
Each of the "Warriors" ousted his UCLA counterpart to score Stan
ford's first three points in the match.
Becker (No. 54), still riding high off his match-clinching win over
Georgia, beat Vincent Allegre 6-4, 6-2 to start things off for Stanford.
Becker is the only player this season to beat the Bruin freshman in a
dual match, and he has done it four consecutive times.
Elliott (No. 99) was next off the courts, giving Stanford a 2-1 lead
with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Matt Breen (No. 88). Breen had beaten Elliott
in straight sets the last two times they had met, but the Cardinal junior
showed his experience, maintaining his composure in a very tight sec
ond set.
Meanwhile Thomas had taken the first set of his match with a 7-3
tie-break victory, and was only just beginning his second set. It was
typical Thomas tennis, calm and deliberate.
"Jim is kind of a tainted 'Road Warrior' because he goes too slow,"
said Becker earlier this year. "To be a true 'Warrior,' you've got to be
crash and burn."
Well, Thomas, wasn't crashing or burning, but he was perfectly ex
ecuting his game plan, pressuring his opponent, Heath Montgomery,
to pass him at the net. Montgomery wasn't up to the task, as the 6-4
Stanford senior utilized his height and reach to smother all balls com
ing his way. He closed out the match with a 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 victory.
"I knew Jim was going to win because, well, because he's Jim," said
a giddy Salzenstein at the post-match press conference. And why
shouldn't Salzenstein, and for that matter everyone, have felt that
way? Thomas has an unblemished 9-0 record at fourth singles this
year, and has proven all season long that he can be depended on to win
his point.
Usually, however, Stanford doesn't even need his point. Because
Thomas operates so deliberately, he has only finished four of his 12
tournament matches. He has won all of them, for a 4-0 mark.
As Thomas's match was closing down, action on the top three courts
was fast and furious. Salzenstein (No. 4) was in an intense struggle on
the first court against Gimelstob (No. 1). After losing the first set, 6-4,
the Cardinal captain fought back to take the second, 6-1. The quality
of tennis was excellent, as both players proved deserving of their high
ranking. Neither player could gain the edge for an extended amount of
time and the stars traded one break each and three service holds to
push the match to 4-4 in the decisive set.
On court two, Paul Goldstein (No. 28), was also engaged in a tight
third set. Muskatirovic (No. 17), had beaten Goldstein in straight
sets in both teams' last regular season match, but the Stanford
sophomore had given the lanky 6-4 Yugoslavian all he could handle in
the first two sets. Goldstein kept his crisp-volleying opponent off the
net by charging it himself, and seemed to be on the verge of taking
over in the third.
However, the second and third singles matches, as exciting as they
were, never received the opportunity to conclude. Less than two min
utes after Thomas had secured the third Stanford point, Ryan Wolters
(No. 11) found himself with a match point in his third singles bout
with Taino (No. 27). Taino was serving at 2-5 in the third, desperate
ly trying to breathe life back into his match and into the entire Bruin
team.
The eighth game of the deciding set went to deuce, but Wolters
gained the advantage when Taino sailed a backhand too deep. The
Bruin junior stepped up to the challenge, and nailed a service winner
down the middle to stay alive.
Wolters again gained the advantage, this time with a winner of his
own. The UCLA southpaw unleashed a powerful serve to start the sec
ond match point, but two strokes later, Stanford's freshman phenom
drilled a backhand cross-court, and a lunging Taino was unable to vol
ley the ball back into the court.
"I had been looking at the other courts, so I sort of knew we were
winning," Wolters said after the match. "I was just excited I won. Then
when everyone ran out to hug me I realized that my match was the
clincher."
