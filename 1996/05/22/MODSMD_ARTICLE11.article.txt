# ASSU passes budget, presidential election
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
In its final meeting before
dissolution, the ASSU Senate
took action to make this week's
special election constitutional
by officially placing the names of
presidential candidates on the
ballot.
"The election will go on as
scheduled," said Elections Com
missioner Ryan Medders.
Following the meeting, the sit
ting senate dissolved, and "Con
stitution '96" officially became

the ASSU Con
stitution, hand
ing full legisla
tive power over
to the senate
elect and ending
27 years of a
Council of Pres
idents.
The senate
also passed a

compromise bill
to approve the 1996-97 ASSU
budget.
At issue was the ASSU's bud
get deficit. A proposal presented
to the Budget and Finance Com
mittee originally contained a
$10,000 shortfall to be made up
by drawing money from the
ASSU's endowment.
The bill the committee pre
sented to the senate, however,
made cuts in the presidential
and senatorial operating bud
gets to achieve a balanced bud
get.
Many members of the senate,
including former COP member
Mike Choo, opposed the harsh
cuts in items such as presiden
tial stipends and senate pro
gramming which funds ad hoc
committees.
"We have three choices: We
can adopt a budget that is slight
ly draconian but reduces the
deficit, which the financial man
ager wants to be zero; or we can
take the slightly cushier route
and make this number to
$10,000; or we can come to some
form of compromise," said grad
uate senator Doug Natelson.
The senate approved a com
promise proposal offered by for

mer graduate senator Sandeep
Singhal and graduate senator
Donald Aingworth which re
duced the deficit to $4,150 by
scaling back the cuts proposed
by the Budget and Finance Com
mittee.
The senate also approved the
spring allocations for the Com
munity Service Board and the
Publications Board without de
bate.
Program Board funding,
however, passed over objections
that it unfairly denied money for
organizations that lost special
fees as part of larger "umbrella"
groups.
The senate upheld the Pro
gram Board decision to deny
funds to any group that received
more than 50 percent of its bud
get from another group which
also receives funding from the
Program Board.
Singhal raised the concern
that if the senate did not deny
funding to members of "umbrel
la" groups it would eventually
allow all groups denied a special
fee to separate into smaller
pieces and apply for general-fee
funds.
"I would love to see all these
groups get money, but I would
hate to see them play the name
game just to get funding," Sing
hal said.
In other action, the senate ap
proved a Nominations Commis
sion recommendation in ap
pointing students to University
committees and passed a resolu
tion supporting University
funding for the Women's Cen
ter. It failed, however, to make
bylaw changes requested by the
Speakers' Bureau allowing the
bureau to offer larger honoraria
to speakers.
Deferring action to its succes
sor, the senate passed a resolu
tion recommending that the
senate-elect consider re-appor
tioning the graduate senate
seats to reflect changes in en
rollment. In its last official ac
tion the COP vetoed the propos
al.
The senate was considering
bylaw revisions when it failed a
quorum call and adjourned.
