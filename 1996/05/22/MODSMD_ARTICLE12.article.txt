## Dole outlines his welfare plan Strategy requires work, caps benefits; allows for drug testing

FOND DU LAC, Wis. (AP) -
Promising to end liberalism's "grand
failure," Bob Dole outlined a welfare
plan yesterday that would require work,
put a lifetime cap on benefits, halt pay
ments to illegal immigrants and allow
drug testing of recipients.
It was the beginning of an effort by
Dole, the certain Republican presiden
tial nominee, to seize the initiative on
an issue with proven political appeal.
President Clinton stressed the issue
with considerable success in his 1992
campaign.
Dole said that in the days since can
didate Clinton promised to "end welfare
as we know it,"the president has twice
vetoed Republican welfare reform
plans.
"We don't need four more years of
broken promises," Dole told a luncheon
audience in Fond du Lac. "We need a
president who will sign genuine welfare
reform."
The White House and Clin ton's cam
paign quickly derided Dole's speech as a
rehash of existing Republican positions
and said Clinton was delivering many of
the things Dole promised. White House

spokesman Mike McCurry called Dole's
address "bereft of any new ideas."
Dole chose to deliver his address in
Wisconsin because of Gov. Tommy
Thompson's 10-year leadership in push
ing welfare reform. With Thompson at
his side, Dole toured Brenner Tank Co.,
where the governor signed into law his
latest reform package. It would require
able-bodied recipients to work and pro
vides health and child care benefits for
their children.
During his tour, Dole chatted with
area workers who have gotten their jobs
through welfare-to-work programs.
During a chat over ham and cheese
sandwiches, Lisa Miesner told Dole of
her pride at getting a check that read
"Brenner Tank instead of State of Wis
consin."
Clinton caught Republicans off
guard by praising the Wisconsin pro
gram over the weekend. But the White
House has since retreated, suggesting
Wisconsin is unlikely to get all of the
waivers it would need to fully imple
ment the plan.
Dole said that retreat was another
example of "calculated cynicism" by

Clinton in which he talks like a conser
vative but governs with "a sorry grab
bag of liberal policies."
"Too often President Clinton's state
ments are like the tornadoes in the
movie 'Twister' â€” it looks like a lot is
happening but in reality it's all just spe
cial effects," Dole said.
Echoing Dole, Thompson said Clin
ton had repeatedly changed his position
on national welfare reform and failed to
keep his word to quickly approve state
experiments. But he gave Clinton
begrudging credit for successfully using
the issue to his benefit in 1992 and said
Dole needed to "passionately" address
the issue to block Clinton.
"Thirty years ago, the 'Great Society'
was liberalism's greatest hope, its great
est boast," Dole said. "Today it stands
as its greatest shame, a grand failure
that has crushed the spirit, destroyed
the families and decimated the culture
of those who have become enmeshed in
its web."
Dole's plan is consistent with pro
posals he helped pass as Senate majori
ty leader only to see them vetoed by
Clinton.

ways on the issue.
