# Study finds that less salt in diet doesn't help lower blood pressure

CHICAGO (AP) — Challenging
the conventional wisdom among
doctors and government experts, a
study found that healthy people
and even some patients with high
blood pressure gain little from low
ering the salt in their diet.
From bacon to peanut butter,
low-salt products abound at the
supermarket, aimed at health-con
scious shoppers trying to avoid
high blood pressure.
But the report by Canadian
researchers concludes that while a
salt-restricted diet can lower blood
pressure in hypertension patients
over age 45, it has little or no ben
efit among younger hypertension

patients and those with normal
blood pressure.
The analysis of 56 previous
studies was paid for in part by the
Campbell Soup Co., which has
been criticized by the U.S. govern
ment and interest groups for tout
ing the health benefits of its salt
laden soups.
The report appears in today's
Journal of the American Medical
Association. This week's issue
focuses solely on high blood pres
sure, which afflicts some 50 mil
lion Americans. It includes a study
underscoring the link between
high blood pressure and heart dis
ease, and one emphasizing the

effectiveness of diet, exercise and
drugs in treating hypertension.
In an accompanying editorial,
Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the
National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute, challenged the Canadian
report because it includes several
studies of less than two weeks'
duration — not enough time, he
said, for a salt-hypertension rela
tionship to show up.
"The preponderance of evi
dence continues to indicate that
modest reduction of sodium, as
recommended in the 1995 U.S.
Dietary Guidelines for Americans,
would improve public health,"
Lenfant wrote.
