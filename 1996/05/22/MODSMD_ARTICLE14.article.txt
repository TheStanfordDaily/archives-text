Freemen send out armed patrols
JORDAN, Mont. (AP) — The Freemen sent
out armed patrols around their farmhouse yes
terday for the first time in the 58-day standoff
after talks with a mediator broke up in anger.
The mediator, a leader in the so-called patri
ot movement in Colorado, blamed Freemen
stubbornness for the breakdown and went so
far as to praise the FBl's patience.
"The FBI has now pursued each and every
avenue to a peaceful solution," mediator
Charles Duke said. "If it should come to a less
than peaceful solution, I can tell you for sure
the FBI has bent over backwards to avoid it."
At least a half-dozen Freemen, carrying
rifles over their shoulders and wearing
sidearms, spread out in the fields and hills. The
anti-government fugitives have maintained two

sentry posts for most of their standoff with the
FBI but had not previously conducted foot
patrols.
Earthquake shakes Bay Area
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - An earthquake
shook the San Francisco Bay Area yesterday
afternoon, jarring residents from Monterey Bay
to Sacramento.
The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude
at 4.7 and the epicenter 10 miles east of San Jose
on the Calaveras Fault.
"It was a jolt, followed by a lot of rolling," said
Myna Bushman, a computer supervisor at the
county building in Santa Cruz.
There were no immediate reports of damage or
injury, according to Michelle Lloyd of the Santa
Clara County Office of Emergency Services.
