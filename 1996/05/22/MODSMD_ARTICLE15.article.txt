President, dean worked
well with ASSU leaders
to implement new plan

AT 11:59 LAST NIGHT, Con
stitution '96 officially became
the chief governing docu
ment for the Associated Students of
Stanford University. With the new
document comes a new election,
which began at midnight this morn
ing, for the first single ASSU presi
dent in a quarter-century.
Constitution '96 (which, thank
fully, will soon be simply "the
ASSU Constitution") will cause sig
nificant changes in the structure of
the ASSU, but what is truly
remarkable is the short period of
time in which such a grand over
haul has taken place. All involved
deserve credit for getting this
important new document imple
mented so quickly and effectively.
Constitution '96 was passed by
the voters during the ASSU Spring
Elections, held only one month ago.
In the intervening period, a group
of ASSU leaders known collectively
as the Constitutional Transition
Committee met regularly to come
up with a framework for the transi
tion to the new government and to
grapple with such issues as deter
mining the proper method for fill
ing the new senate's 30 seats with
the 40 students elected in the last
election. They examined how to
create continuity between the old
and new governments and they
made recommendations unani
mously accepted by both the old
and the new senates for how to deal
with such issues. The committee's
members — even those who dis
agreed with some of the fundamen-

tal assumptions underlying their
efforts — worked in good faith to
make sure that this transition
caused as little damage to the
ASSU as possible.
More importantly, however, Con
stitution '96 could not be imple
mented until University President
Gerhard Casper issued his condi
tions and interpretations of the
document and the senate approved
them. What is truly remarkable
about this process is that Casper,
who took nearly nine months to
sign off on the last amendment to
the ASSU Constitution needing his
approval, issued a thorough and
comprehensive set of conditions
and interpretations so promptly.
The president, then, is to be
lauded for his recognition that
quick implementation of the new
constitution was important to the
students and to the continued func
tioning of the ASSU. Particular
credit is due to Dean of Students
Marc Wais and Senior University
Counsel Thomas Fenner for the
enormous amount of time and
energy spent negotiating the terms
of Casper's letter of acceptance
with ASSU officials.
The one provision of Constitu
tion '96 which Casper simply reject
ed would have required him to act
on amendments to the ASSU Con
stitution within 90 days; he claimed
that it is sometimes impossible for
the Office of the President to move
that quickly. His claim has merit,
and the speedy work of Casper and
his staff on Constitution '96 shows
that when it is possible to move
quickly, he can. Hopefully, the
ASSU and the administration
should be able to build on the good
faith developed during the recent
constitutional negotiation to create
a system to ensure that future
amendments are handled as quick
ly, thoroughly and professionally.
