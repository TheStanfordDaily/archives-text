## End Stanford athletics 
### 
LET ME START by saying there are a
surprisingly large number of good
things to say about the Department
of Athletics. Stanford is its way to winning
its second Sears Cup as the nation's best
athletic department. Since 1980, Stanford
has won 47 NCAA championships, the
most in the country. Because it's an
Olympic year, I should add that Stanford
athletes will earn as many medals as a
good-sized Eastern Bloc Nation.
As a whole, Stanford's athletes are
roughly equivalent to other Stanford stu
dents as a whole. They take roughly equal
course loads. The department even gets
points for complying more fully than any
other school in the country with Title IX,
the notorious but just gender equity
requirement.
However, we should still dump the Ath
letics Department. There's a high opportu
nity cost to having such a prominent ath
letic department — we are accepting ath
letes instead of social activists, and watch
ing basketball instead of ballet. As well-run
as the department is, there are well-docu
mented problems with athletes' off-the
field behavior. Finally, sports are valued too
much in our nation, and by cutting back
our programs, we would be doing the a
moral thing, reminding ourselves and oth
ers that games are just that.
There are about 6,500 undergraduates
at Stanford. That's a small student base to
field 33 varsity teams against public uni
versities with three or four times as many

students. To compete at such a high level
means that Stanford must be incredibly
jockish, probably more so than any other
school in the country. There are more than
300 scholarship athletes, and, by my esti
mate, at least 700 varsity athletes. So 10
percent of the student body has athletics as
its primary focus. That's 10 percent whose
focus isn't art, music, social activism or
academics. And many of this 10 percent
receive help in admissions, whether they
need it or not. Judging by the football
team's reported average SAT score of
1069, the boost is needed. John Elway II
may have taken the next Mae Jemison's
place
There is also, unfortunately, a rather
sordid side. Letter-winners from promi
nent athletic teams have, over the past
few years, been involved in incidents like
couch theft, stalking, sexual assault. The
most infamous of these incidents was the
vandalism / art criticism of two years
past, the most recent the thrashing of a
hapless Phi Delt. Sure, the Athletics
Department doesn't countenance these
activities, but at the same time, we all
know it's not the Harmonics or the Solar
Car Project people roughing up passers
by and smashing the "Gay Liberation"
sculpture. Just because they weren't
wearing cleats at the time doesn't mean
they weren't athletes.
Of course, athletes engage in all man
ners of public service, including the men
toring of their young fans. And the good

outnumber the bad by far. But these insti
tutions do beget unpalatable behavior rang
ing from the puerile to the terrible, from
drunkenness to rape and assault. As long as
we have this athletic culture, we will also
have nasty incidents which the Athletics
Department will call aberrations, but which
we know are anything but.
Finally, and most importantly, we're in
a society which is too focused on sports.
America is a nation of athletic supporters.
Michael Jordan is going to sign a contract
paying him close to $20 million a year this
summer. Twelve-year-old girls get ulcers
and anorexia training to be Olympic gym
nasts. Final Four tickets were scalped for
thousands of dollars apiece this year. Bil
lions are spent on the latest in high-tech
athletic apparel. All of the above are sick
and wasteful, symptoms of a nation which
has placed too much value on games.
By cutting the number of scholarships,
by reducing rather than expanding the
number of varsity teams and by decreasing
the weight of athletics in admissions deci
sions, Stanford would show its commit
ment to being a leader in times where far
too many young dreams have touchdowns
and home runs, and too few a violin.

James G. Wheaton is glad that Ted
Leland has never publicly used the word
"epistemological."
