Daily unfairly critical of Mahood's actions, prof says

After reading Monday's
editorial I decided to write a letter
in defense of Gail Mahood but
unfortunately I never got around to it.
This morning after reading Rob Polhe
mus' excellent response I had decided to
let Rob's articulate prose stand for itself
until my eye fell on the letter from Greg
Martellotto. My unhappiness with The
Daily's treatment of Gail turned to
downright anger after reading this
"epistle of hate" and so I write to add
my voice to that of Rob Polhemus in
defense of Gail Mahood.
Let's be clear on one thing at the out
set. I seldom see issues the same way as
Gail. In fact we often vote on opposite
sides of issues discussed in the Faculty
Senate. A case in point was the extensive
discussion on the grade change policy in
the senate two years ago. I was one of
the three senators who voted against
this new policy after trying in vain with
Ron Rebholz to try to modify its terms.

In another instance I voted to retain stu
dent membership on the Planning and
Policy Board, an issue Gail decided with
a casting vote against student member
ship. However to attribute these deci
sions solely to the efforts of Gail, as The
Daily editorial attempts to do, is simply
ridiculous and naive.
Gail did in fact work tirelessly on the
Grade Change Policy, as a member of the
senate's Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement. She did a
fine job of bringing the issues to as many
meetings as she could possibly attend,
including a number with students. The
Daily states that the grade change policy
"provoked the ire of the vast majority of
Stanford students" at the time. How I
wish that the "vast majority" of the stu
dent body at the time had in fact stood
up to be counted. The student meetings
were very poorly attended, a fact not lost
on the senators who voted for the policy.
To her credit Gail stood her ground and

very patiently explained her position
numerous times publicly, in newspaper
articles and via e-mail. When the time
came for the discussion in the senate,
Gail played it very straight and did not
resort to any underhanded PR manipula
tion as suggested by The Daily. Simply
stated, she was not "single-handedly"
responsible for this policy. Thirty-seven
of her colleagues in the senate, unfortu
nately, saw it the same way as she did.
To suggest that Gail was responsible
for students being removed from the
Planning and Policy Board is also ridicu
lous. The fact remains that, by a small
margin, the senate voted to remove stu
dent membership. I personally thought
that this was an awful decision but in my
frustration I did not think to blame this
on Gail. Her decision not to bring the
issue back to the senate was not hers
alone either. The Faculty Senate Steer
ing Committee, of which Gail is a mem
ber, made this decision and Gail, in her

capacity as senate chair, reported it to
the ASSU Senate. The Daily's editorial
writer, who is clearly knowledgeable
about how the senate works, should not
have let his / her understanding of senate
rules be undermined, in this case, by the
need to score a few cheap points at
Mahood's expense.
I hope that in the future when The
Daily picks issues to fight for that its
writers are able to separate their frus
trations and unhappiness from the need
to vilify individuals in very demeaning
terms. The decision to treat her in this
manner says more about the editorial
board of The Daily and its apparent lack
of understanding of how this institution
works than it does about Gail. Gail
Mahood has worked countless hours on
behalf of this university and all its con
stituents, and for this she deserves
much better.
