# Stanford grade policy was in need of change
## 
### 
Having been a graduate student at
Stanford since 1989 (first in chemistry,
now in philosophy), I got a good taste of
the old grading system and drop policy
before the new one was implemented. It
may be the case that many, even most, of
the students under the old policies had the
"credibility and responsibility" to "own up
to their education." However, an alarm
ingly large number of students did not.
I have seen students drop courses on
the day of the final exam to avoid the
dreaded B-f, only to retake the course
the next term or year. I know students
who did not take the final (but didn't
officially drop) to achieve the same end
(since the resulting NC never appeared
on the transcript). This behavior was

not just a problem for the students dis
playing it, who certainly lacked both
credibility and responsibility. It was a
problem as well for the students who did
not abuse the policies â€” who had to
compete with students who had already
had the same material in the same
course from the same professor (some
times twice), who had to deal with class
es overcrowded by retakers and staffed
by professors and TAs distinctly
unpsyched to be seeing large numbers of
the same faces over and over again.
The grade inflation that resulted from
the last-minute bail-outs of students with
less than desirable grades (where desirabil
ity was sometimes judged from the point
of view of acceptance to a top-10 medical
school) has made a difference to Stanford's
reputation in more important circles than
simply media circles; for example, medical
schools are known to count A's from Stan
ford as less impressive than A's from

Berkeley, because the Berkeley A's are
harder to get. If the old policies had hurt
only the irresponsible, we could have lived
with it, but it penalized the responsible as
well, perhaps even more.
A historical transcript seems like the
only realistic means to prevent some stu
dents from taking advantage of their
classmates in these ways. As we've seen
in recent discussions of the Honor Code
as well, it seems the cost of a Stanford
education and the difficulty of the job
market stand in the way of the develop
ment of fellow-feeling that ought to be
able to do the job. Perhaps when Stan
ford students have learned to live with
the new grading and transcript policies
we have a chance at achieving the
integrity and fellow-feeling not to need
these new policies in quite the same way.
