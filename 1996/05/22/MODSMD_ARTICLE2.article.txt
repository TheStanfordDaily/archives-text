# New center requested by disability activists
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Members of Disabled Students of
Stanford gathered yesterday in
White Plaza to host a disabilities
awareness day and petition for an ac
cessible, more conveniently located
community center on campus.
The requested center would re
place the current one, which will be
converted into office space this fall.
The center's conversion is the re
sult of a mandate from the Office of
Civil Rights which requires the Uni

versity to add professional staff so
that services for disabled students
can be increased, said Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais.
The community center — which
is now located in the Meyer Library
building — will be converted into of
fice space to accommodate new staff
members at the Disability Resource
Center. The current resource center
is too small, Wais said.
Senior Danielle Lee spoke against
the loss of the community center,
drawing a distinction between Dis
abled Students at Stanford and
other campus student organiza
tions.
"We did not choose to belong to
this student group," Lee said. Other
students "can choose to belong to a
Republican or Democratic or reli
gious group. .. .We did not have this
choice. Disabilities are a part of our
nature."
Lee said the community center is
"a safe place for us to discuss issues
that interest u5.... This is not some
place where we meet to talk about a
boat dance, it's what we live every
day," she said.
The concerns of disabled stu
dents, however, have not gone un
heard. "It's not that we want to dis
place them," Wais said. "The Uni
versity is responding to a federal
mandate from the Office of Civil
Rights, and we're making a very con
certed effort to relocate the meeting
room to somewhere else on cam

pus," he said.
Wais, who has met with students
from the group several times in the
last two weeks and will meet with
them again this afternoon, said he is
hopeful to announce a new location
before the end of spring quarter.
Freshman Brad Harris, in atten
dance at yesterday's rally, said the
community center is especially im
portant to disabled students, em
phasizing the fact that "we're hav
ing something taken away, we're not
asking for something."
"Especially when disabled stu
dents come to campus, it's so big and
spread out," Harris said. "The com
munity center gives us a space where
we can feel we belong, feel safe and
discuss problems."
Part of the concern about not
having an established space, accord
ingtojunior Daniel Davis, is that dis
abled students with mobility or visu
al impairments would have difficul
ty making it to different rooms at dif
ferent times, if there was no estab
lished space.
Kurt Schwehr, who will graduate
next month, emphasized the impor
tance of the community center for its

accessibility and the comfortable en
vironment it offers disabled stu
dents.
"It made me feel much more com
fortable about my disabilities,"
Schwehr said.
Many disabled students need a
place to come together and discuss
issues such as combinations — ex
tended time on tests, note takers, tu
tors — in an established, accessible
space, he said.
According to Vice Provost and
Dean for Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds, the University is committed
to meeting the needs of disabled stu
dents.
"I'm very sensitive to their
needs," Edmonds said, "and we'll be
working together to try to resolve
some of the issues." Edmonds will
soon hold a meeting with adminis
trators, faculty and students to dis
cuss their concerns.
"We're all in support of the stu
dents and not in opposition to
[them]," said Car la Dunn, assistant
director of the resource center.
Dunn added that she felt the rally
and petitioning in White Plaza was a
"multi-pronged effort" on the part of

students to "do everything they can,
to be visible and be heard and to
stress the importance of this com
munity space."
Davis said he recognized the Uni
versity's efforts to support the needs
of disabled students, but still felt
strongly about the need for a com
munity center.
"We know there are people in the
University who are working for us,"
Davis said. "We're just trying to
raise public awareness and trying to
make sure that we don't lose what
took 10 years to gain in the first
place."
"Despite the space considera
tions, we feel like it would be a blow
to the disabled community if we
were not able to have a place where
we could meet, identify and talk," he
said. Davis said the rally gained a lot
of support, with more than 100 stu
dents signing the petition.
Wais said he hopes a place for dis
abled students to meet will be identi
fied and established by fall quarter,
but added, "The only guarantee I
can give them is that we're doingour
absolute best to respond to their
demonstrated needs."
