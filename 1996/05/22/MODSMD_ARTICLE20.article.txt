# Daily erred in printing anti-Mahood letter
## 
### 
I do not agree with The Daily editorial
about Gail Mahood; I agree with the senti
ments expressed in Rob Polhemus' letter.
My real purpose in writing is to express
my outrage over the printing of Greg
Martellotto's letter in yesterday's Daily. Did
anyone on the staff bother to read it before
publishing it? Is it The Daily's policy to pub
lish irresponsible name-calling as part of
freedom of expression? It seems to me that
The Daily was so desperate to advertise sup
port for Monday's misguided editorial that
no one bothered to read past the first sen
tence of Martellotto's hit piece. I fmd the
lack of judgment shown by The Daily's edi
tors in this entire matter truly regrettable.
