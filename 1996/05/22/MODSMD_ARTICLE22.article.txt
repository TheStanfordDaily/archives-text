## Decision '96: Clinton, Stanford and second chances 
### 
ON ELECTION NIGHT 1992, as a
callow first-year reporter for The
Stanford Daily, I was assigned to
cover the reaction of Stanford Republicans
to the evening's results. If my fading mem
ory serves me correctly, they stayed home
that night, licking their wounds after the
electoral triumph of Bill Clinton. After a
short telephone call with one of the group's
organizers, I headed to the American Stud
ies house, where Stanford Democrats had
assembled to sip champagne and toast
their young president-elect as he accepted
victory in Arkansas. The
enthusiasm of the students — their hoot
ing at big-screen televisions, their hormon
al, hands-on affection with each other and
their gushing garrulousness about, of all
things at Stanford, politics — impressed
me that night, as I whirled around the
room, a novice reporter four months
removed from high school. After I filed two
short articles, my editor looked at me and
asked, without a trace of the usual sar
casm, "That was fun, huh?"
I suppose it was. It was fun and
rewarding to be a young American that
November night, to watch a candidate
whom we actually supported win, a guy
who possessed a vague idea how to get
along and live and relate to people beyond
the Mall of America, who had a teenage
daughter of his own and was within a

generation's reach of us MTV children.
I'm no Lindsay Buckingham fan, but
Fleetwood Mac did sound pretty hip and
fresh for a couple weeks. Future leaders
may prove to be more decisive, relevant
and, well, presidential. But the Clinton
presidency will always be, for better or
worse, the period when we came of age.
Bill Clinton is "our" president.
For those of us who entered college in
1992, the Clinton presidency has taken
on even larger importance, partly
because Americans have a habit of neatly
demarcating time into presidential-term
intervals. Lionel Ritchie just released his
first album since the Reagan administra
tion. The Boston Red Sox have not won
the World Series since Woodrow Wilson's
second term. The only four-year period
more aggrandized in the popular imagi
nation, it seems, is the 45-month stint we
spend as college undergraduates. Com
mencement exercises and party conven
tions are occasions to assess who we are
and what we've done, to decide whether,
in fact, our lives are better than they
were four years ago. For all of us
approaching graduation, then, the Clin
ton presidency has become a metaphor
for our Stanford lives, a drama unfolding
in parallel to our own.
We both arrived in daunting new sur
roundings fairly confident that we were

prepared to handle them, having primed
ourselves with wise outside counsel from
the Congressional leadership and
Approaching Stanford. We could remake
ourselves — shed all the bad '80s CDs
and demons we wanted, get a new haircut
and lose the old accent. We would take
classes and enact deficit-reduction pack
ages that meant something to us. We
were wrong.
I can recall reconciling myself to the
grim reality of 8:15 p.m. freshman
English sections while reading of Clin
ton's travails on the job: the catastrophic
battles to fulfill campaign promises to lift
restrictions on gays in the military and
provide middle-class tax cuts. How, we all
wondered, to satisfy your new friends and
aspirations and still repay those who got
you there? When push came to shove,
Clinton abandoned Lani Guinier as quick
ly as many of us gave up on Chem 31.
We had setbacks, some greater than
others: failed health-care legislation, a
shellacking at the polls, rejected applica
tions for summer internships and study
abroad. And, along the way, we have had
our share of regrets — about things we
would have done differently, words we
might not have meant to say, friends we
should have held onto more ardently. By
now, Bill Clinton and the rest of us have
settled, more or less, into positions in

which we acquit ourselves competently,
knocking off term papers and vetoing
Republican bills with a steady, rhythmic
regularity that is fast becoming second
nature.
The compatibility of the paths we've
traveled in the last four years now pre
pare to diverge. In some three weeks,
those of us at Stanford will leave the
Quad a final time, kicked out of the com
fort of this place into the world where
angels fear to tread. In fairly short order,
we will decide whether Clinton deserves
the same fate. Charitably speaking, I'm
less than convinced he does not. The hope
of that election night, when Clinton
exuded the promise of a more robust and
productive social agenda, has given way
to a pallid national cynicism about gov
ernment's capacity to improve the state
of the republic. He's become a reformed
neo-conservative by bashing liberal caus
es and tacking right, prodded by the
advice of a stealth svengali. And he has
governed so incompetently at times that
the prospect of a second term, historical
ly disastrous for re-elected presidents,
arouses more dread than curiosity.
Besides, none of us have the opportu
nity to go back and correct the mistakes
we made during our sophomore year or
this morning; on June 16, no matter how
many ends remain untied, Stanford will

recede into memory. It hardly seems fair
that Clinton may earn another term in
the same office by default while we sub
sist in the new jobs and locations that the
past four years have ostensibly earned us.
And yet who among us wouldn't jump at
a second chance? It is Clinton's greatest
gift, a New York Times Magazine profde
offered last Sunday, "to look past what he
is to what he might be, to look over what
he has not been to what he wants to be, to
dream no small dreams." What senior
does not believe that after four years she
too has changed for the better, learned
from past errors and would do more and
better given the luxury of going through
it all again?
That, it seems to me, is the dilemma of
Bill Clinton's future, and ours, too. Vot
ing for a second Clinton term no longer
constitutes some affirmation of the pro
priety of my personal progress. Like
many young voters, I'm much more
ambivalent about myself and Clinton
today than I was on November 8, 1992.
Awarding Clinton a second term, if we
choose to, will be a grudging act, a wiz
ened acknowledgment of the shortcom
ings as much as the accomplishments of
our last four years.
