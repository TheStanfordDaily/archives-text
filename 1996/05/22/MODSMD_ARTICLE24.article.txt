## Baseball comes full circle in '96 season 
### 
It looks like we've got a con
tender, folks — and don't
you take it for granted.
The sixth-ranked Stanford
baseball team will hit the field at
Sunken Diamond tomorrow
night with as good a chance as
anyone of advancing to the Col
lege World Series in Omaha next
week. That's because the Cardi
nal is not only playing some of
the best baseball this team is ca
pable of playing, but it will also
be playing this weekend's NCAA
West Regional on its home field.
Now, if someone had said
four months ago that Stanford
would be hosting an NCAA re
gional come season's end, few
would have batted an eyelid.
News that the Cardinal would
earn a No. 2 seed may have been
met with mild surprise, if only
because head coach Mark Mar
quess' squad — ranked No. 2 in
the nation at season's start —
was expected to do better.
But that's not the case any
more. The Cardinal couldn't be
happier about this opportunity,
one that might have seemed
ridiculous just two short months
ago.
Indeed, things have come full
circle for this Stanford team,
lauded as one of the top collegiate
teams in the nation by preseason
publications like Collegiate Base
ball and Baseball America, both
of which tabbed the Cardinal as
the second-best team in the
country. After all, Stanford
would be fielding one of the best,
if not the best starting rotation in
the country — led by sophomore
flame-thrower Kyle Peterson
(the National Freshman of the
Year in 1995), junior Jason Mid
dlebrook and highly-touted
freshmen Chad Hutchinson and
Jeff Austin — and a solid lineup
anchored by two-time All-Ameri
can catcher A.J. Hinch.
But as things turned out, the
'96 edition of Cardinal baseball
was destined to follow in the
footsteps of the '95 squad, which
dropped like a rock in the na
tional polls after battling a series
of early-season injuries.
The season began inauspi
ciously enough in Honolulu,
where Peterson and the Cardi
nal were shelled 11-1 in their
season opener, a crushing loss to
the Hawaii Rainbows. Two
weeks later, Hinch suffered an
injured shoulder while diving
back to first base on a pickoff
throw during a game against
Santa Clara. Still though, things
weren't going all that bad — the
Cardinal would lose a game here
and there, even dropping three
in a row at one point to Santa
Clara, USF and Fresno State,
but overall the team looked
solid.
At least until March 8-10.
That was the weekend the Car
dinal yielded 27 runs while suf
fering a three-game sweep at the

hands of USC, the first of two
sweeps by the Trojans that left
the Cardinal in a Six-Pac tail
spin and helped sink Stanford to
No. 18 in the national polls.
But alas, much like last year's
team — which won 14 of its last
19 contests — this year's squad
has rebounded from its lacklus
ter early-season showing to post
perhaps the most impressive
run in school history, notching a
Stanford-record 16 straight
wins to close out the regular sea
son, a streak that included
sweeps of conference rivals Ari
zona, UCLA and Cal.

That hot streak vaulted the
Cardinal to an improbable sec
ond-place finish in the division
and — along with the lights —
helped Stanford become one of
eight NCAA regional host sites
last Monday.
So how'd they get here? Pe
terson has turned his season
around after seemingly losing
the form that earned him a phe
nomenal 14 wins and 112 strike
outs last season. Hutchinson
and Austin have lived up to the
hype. Hinch has rebounded
from his shoulder injury in a big
way — Six-Pac Player of the
Year honors will attest to that.
And that's not even to mention
guys like Mario Iglesias, Tom
Reimers, Jody Gerut, Brian Dal
limore, Troy Kent and Joe Kil
burg, guys who make up the
backbone of this Cardinal team.
Stanford takes the field to
morrow night at 7 p.m. against
Cal State-Northridge. The Car
dinal has the talent, the momen
tum and the home-field support
to win this four-day, double
elimination tournament, but
it'll probably take a few good
breaks. They could easily go out
Friday with losses in each of
their first two games; they could
just as easily breeze through the
regional undefeated. Either
way, this team will be remem
bered for its grit and determina
tion in resurrecting a season
that often seemed headed on a
road to nowhere.
It's time to get excited. It's
that time of year when every
pitch, every swing, every bad
hop grounder looms larger than
life. And, perhaps for the first
time since January, the Cardinal
looks like a legitimate con
tender.
Four days, six teams and a
trip to Omaha on the line. Let
the games begin.
