Stanford 2
Florida 5

The second-ranked Stanford
women's tennis so.uad lasted a

couple rounds, but was knocked
out by No. 1 Florida in the cham
pionship bout of the NCAA tour
nament yesterday, 5-2.
Fittingly, Gator seniors Jill
Craybas and Lori Ann Freed man
clinched the NCAA title in the No.
3 doubles match. Cardinal senior
co-captain Beth Berris and junior
Emily Burt (7-1) fought valiantly
to split sets in the match, but
dropped a tight tie-breaker as
Florida nabbed its second

women's tennis trophy.
Florida, which ended the sea
son undefeated, grabbed four of
the six singles matches. But the
second-seeded Cardinal extended
the Gators, the tournament' top
seed, to doubles, something no
other team had been able to ac
complish.
The results mirrored the first
Stanford-Florida meeting be
tween the two powerhouses to a
tee. The February clash in the fi
nals of the National Team Indoors
was also a 5-2 victory for the
Gators.
"We played well at every
point," Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan. "They're just a
better team than we are. We saw
what we needed to do when we lost
to them earlier and we came back
a much better team. Unfortunate
ly, so did they.
"We got better and better since
then, but so did they. I have a lot
more respect for Florida now than
I did then. We have nothing to be
ashamed of."
The loss extended the Cardinal
championship drought in
women's tennis. Stanford has
won eight titles in women's ten
nis, but its hands have not sported
rings in the last five years.
"This is my second time losing
in the finals," Cardinal junior
Katie Schlukebir said. "It's no
fun. It's disappointing, but at the
same time, every other team
would have loved to have been
where we were today. There is al
ways tomorrow."
Freshman Stephanie Nickitas
gave Florida a one-match lead by
defeating Stanford senior co-cap
tain Amy Chiminello in straight
sets, 6-1, 6-1. The match marked
the end of a tremendous career for
Chiminello (22-3), who finished
with an overall dual-match record
of 87-9.
"Having Nickitas at No. 6 is
very intimidating," Brennan said.

"She is a very good player. Playing
her at No. 6 shows how good they
really are."
Sophomore Julie Scott (23-2)
quickly tied the match by sending
Bonnie Bleeker home with a
straight-set loss of her own, 6-3,6-
2. Florida again moved out to a
one-match lead by taking the No.
1 singles match. The fourth
ranked player in the country,
Craybas, ended her career at
Florida in fine fashion. Craybas
beat Cardinal Ail-American Ania
Bleszynski, ranked No. 7. Craybas
jumped out on Bleszynski (18-9)
in the first set. Bleszynski hung
tough in the second set, but could
not hold on to split and lost the
match, 6-3, 6-4.
Junior Sandra De Silva again
brought the Cardinal back to a tie
with a win at the No. 3 singles
spot. De Silva (21-4) captured a
tight first set from Gator Divya
Merchant, winning in a tie-break.
De Silva then took control of the
match, taking the second set and
the match, 7-6, 6-2. De Silva did
not lose a match in four attempts
during the tournament, winning
all four in straight sets.
Florida took a decisive 4-2 edge
going into doubles by taking the
final two singles matches in three
sets.
On the No. 4 court, senior Lisa
Pugliese and Kim Shasby battled
to split sets. Shasby (15-8)
emerged victorious from a tight
first set, but Pugliese stormed
back to take the second. After
dropping to a 2-0 deficit in the
third set, Shasby earned a service
break, but it was not enough as
Pugliese answered back for the
win, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1.
Florida earned its fourth point
at the No. 2 singles match be
tween Cardinal junior All-Ameri
can Katie Schlukebir and sopho
more Gator Dawn Buth.

Emily Burt reaches for a forehand yesterday in her doubles match.
Schlukebir (20-6) responded to
Buth's first set win with a 6-4 vic
tory in the second and broke Buth
in the first game of the third. Still,
Schlukebir found herself down 4-
2 in the final set. A break brought
her within one game, but Buth
stepped up to take the match, 6-4,
4-6, 6-3, setting the stage for the
No. 3 doubles team.
De Silva and Scott were the
only winners in the match against
Florida in February. Yet despite
the symmetry, the Cardinal felt
like they put up a better fight.
"I felt like we had better
matches," Schlukebir said. "After
the match at Indoors, we knew
what we had to do to beat them,
and we were close. We gave it all
we had, but Florida was just
tougher than us today."
After the match, Brennan was
quick to point out the value of his
graduating seniors.
"What a group," Brennan said.
"They were so focused, such great
leaders. You hear those trite
phrases all the time, but in my 17
years, I've never seen anything
like this. It was a wonderful team
experience. In all my winning
teams, none have ever been as
close as this team.
"They are disappointed that
they lost, but you just don't win
these things because you want
to."
The Cardinal is not done vying
for NCAA titles, however. Up next
for selected member's of the team
are NCAA individual brackets in
both singles and doubles play be
ginning today.
In singles, the Cardinal will be
represented by Bleszynski,
Schlukebir, De Silva and Scott.
Bleszynski, who received the sixth
seed in the singles draw, will meet
Syracuse's Nicole Strnadova.

Schlukebir, seeded in the 9-16
group, will face Michelle O from
William & Mary.
Unseeded De Silva and Scott
will take on Alabama's Bali

Camino and Florida's Pugliese,
respectively. Two doubles teams
will represent Stanford this af
ternoon. Bleszynski and
Schlukebir, seeded second over

all, will meet Syracuse's Strnado
va sisters while the tandem of
Shasby and Scott face Georgia's
Anderson and Chauza in the
opening round.

one-match lead by taking the No.
1 singles match. The fourth
ranked player in the country,
Craybas, ended her career at
Florida in fine fashion. Craybas
beat Cardinal Ail-American Ania
Bleszynski, ranked No. 7. Craybas
jumped out on Bleszynski (18-9)
in the first set. Bleszynski hung
tough in the second set, but could
not hold on to split and lost the
match, 6-3, 6-4.
Junior Sandra De Silva again
brought the Cardinal back to a tie
with a win at the No. 3 singles
spot. De Silva (21-4) captured a
tight first set from Gator Divya
Merchant, winning in a tie-break.
De Silva then took control of the
match, taking the second set and
the match, 7-6, 6-2. De Silva did
not lose a match in four attempts
during the tournament, winning
all four in straight sets.
Florida took a decisive 4-2 edge
going into doubles by taking the
final two singles matches in three
sets.
On the No. 4 court, senior Lisa
Pugliese and Kim Shasby battled
to split sets. Shasby (15-8)
emerged victorious from a tight
first set, but Pugliese stormed
back to take the second. After
dropping to a 2-0 deficit in the
third set, Shasby earned a service
break, but it was not enough as
Pugliese answered back for the
win, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1.
Florida earned its fourth point
at the No. 2 singles match be
tween Cardinal junior All-Ameri
can Katie Schlukebir and sopho
more Gator Dawn Buth.


L A. Rothstein — Special to the Daily
Emily Burt reaches for a forehand yesterday in her doubles match.
Schlukebir (20-6) responded to
Buth's first set win with a 6-4 vic
tory in the second and broke Buth
in the first game of the third. Still,
Schlukebir found herself down 4-
2 in the final set. A break brought
her within one game, but Buth
stepped up to take the match, 6-4,
4-6, 6-3, setting the stage for the
No. 3 doubles team.
De Silva and Scott were the
only winners in the match against
Florida in February. Yet despite
the symmetry, the Cardinal felt
like they put up a better fight.
"I felt like we had better
matches," Schlukebir said. "After
the match at Indoors, we knew
what we had to do to beat them,
and we were close. We gave it all
we had, but Florida was just
tougher than us today."
After the match, Brennan was
quick to point out the value of his
graduating seniors.
"What a group," Brennan said.
"They were so focused, such great
leaders. You hear those trite
phrases all the time, but in my 17
years, I've never seen anything
like this. It was a wonderful team
experience. In all my winning
teams, none have ever been as
close as this team.
"They are disappointed that
they lost, but you just don't win
these things because you want
to."
The Cardinal is not done vying
for NCAA titles, however. Up next
for selected member's of the team
are NCAA individual brackets in
both singles and doubles play be
