# Stanford Invitational marks the end of the season for Cardinal squad
## Badminton team closes out with optimism 
### Hillary Stamm 
The Stanford badminton
team finished its long and ardu
ous season this past weekend
when it hosted the Stanford In
vitational at Ford Center. The
coed team, which includes 35
students, faculty and staff, as
well as players from the area,
had a season highlighted by a se
ries of individual improvements
and accomplishments.
In the open tournament this
past weekend, Stanford had
some outstanding perfor
mances. Sophomores Lily Chen
and Jerry Wong won the mixed
doubles in the A division easily,
and freshman Jeff Ho and Wong
lost a tough match in the semifi
nals of the B division.
While the Cardinal was

pleased with its performance in
1995-1996, it hopes to reach
even greater heights in 1996-
1997.
"We had some really strong
showings this year," said fresh
man Deborah-Anna Reznek.
"But next year we are looking
forward to an even stronger sea
son."
The team managed to score a
fourth place finish in the North
ern California Intercollegiate
Badminton League this year,
placing behind champion UC-
Davis, San Jose State and UC-
Berkeley. At the four tri-meets
that took place this season, the
Cardinal squad was hurt by its
relatively small size, but used its
strong doubles teams to capture
some outstanding individual
wins.

One of these was May 4 at the
state championships at Berke-

year we are looking

ley, when the Stanford doubles
duo of Jeff Ho and Jerry Wong
defeated a squad from Cal in the

men's A doubles match.
Sophomore and co-president
of the Badminton Club, Lily
Chen, remarked that a highlight
of the season was the team's trip
to San Diego in February. "We
played in the Sun God Invita
tional and did really well over
all," Chen said.
Although the Stanford team
was hurt by inconsistent
turnout at its four tri-meets, it
does have the depth and individ
ual talent necessary to capture
the league title next season.
"We have the ability to be
number one next year," Ho said.
"We will have good depth from
the bench, as well as two players
coming who played at the na
tional level for their age group,
and one of them trained at the
Olympic Training Center."
