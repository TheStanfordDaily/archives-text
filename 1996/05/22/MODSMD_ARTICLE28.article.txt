# Cardinal given No. 2 seed in tough Western Regional
## 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
Christmas cards seldom overflow
the office of the NCAA selection com
mittee. After the latest announcement
of the 48-team college baseball regional
field, Stanford will probably not mail
any greetings that way in December.
The sixth-ranked Cardinal (39-17),
winners of a school-record 16 consecu
tive contests, not only drew one of eight
No. 2 seeds but also the toughest No. 5
seed. Tenth-ranked Cal State-North
ridge (49-16), the Western Athletic
Conference winners, will face the Car
dinal in the third and final game of the
regional's opening day in a 7 p.m. con
test tomorrow night at Sunken Dia
mond.
"In our opinion, when looking at
their schedule, they deserved a five
seed," said Ron Maestri, chair of the se
lection committee. "Nonconference
schedules were very important."
Maestri also said Stanford was "consid
ered for a one seed because of their play
at the end of the year."
Maestri said that parity was more
evident this year than in previous sea
sons, and that seeding the two through
five positions proved most difficult. He
added that CSUN was not hurt by play
ing in the WAC, although it did not
earn an automatic bid and had to win a
play-in series against West Coast Con
ference champ Santa Clara (39-20),
which did not earn a bid.
Atlantic Coast Conference regular
season champ Florida State (45-17)
was sent west as the top seed, and the

No. 8 Seminoles will face Northeastern
Illinois (31-27) in the first postseason
game at Stanford in six years at 11 a.m.
tomorrow. The Golden Eagles endured
a .500 conference slate in the Mid-Con
tinent Conference but won the league
tourney and defeated Northern Illinois
of the Midwestern Collegiate Confer
ence in a play-in series to earn an auto
matic bid.
The middle game begins at 3 p.m.
and pits the No. 3 seed Mississippi
State (37-22) against the fourth seed,
UC-Santa Barbara (32-18). The Gau
chos were thought to be on the bubble
after dropping both games of the Big
West Conference championship series
to UNLV, but four teams received bids
from that league. A tourney-high five
squads including the Bulldogs were se
lected from the Southeastern Confer
ence. Mississippi State is ranked 16th
in the Collegiate Baseball poll but are
not ranked in the Baseball America top
25.
The Matadors' selection as a fifth
seed highlighted the stunners of Mon
day's announcement. No other fifth
seed holds down a spot in any major
poll, but CSUN has been ranked no
lower than 13th from the third poll of
the year onward. On the other hand,
Stanford is ranked higher than any
other No. 2 seed, and two of the second
seeds, Georgia Tech and Long Beach
State, are not ranked in the Baseball
America poll.
Maestri explained that geography
dictated some seeding and placement
decisions.
"We did what we possibly
could to keep teams in their
proper geographic regions,"
Maestri said.
Western schools have long
complained that the committee
maintains a bias against their
region. Nine schools from the
West received bids (two more
than last year), but only three
from the Six-Pac.
No. 23 Arizona State (35-21,
14-16) was snubbed for the sec
ond consecutive year, leaving
top-ranked USC (41-14-1, 24-6)
and UCLA (33-26, 16-14) as the
Pac-10's three representatives
along with Stanford. The Tro
jans are the top seed in the Cen
tral II regional at Texas Tech,
while the Bruins are the fourth

seed in the Central I at Texas.
The ratings percentage index
es (RPIs) of Pac-10 schools are
lumped together, even though
the Six-Pac sports a 22-17 mark
against tourney teams and the
NorPac, which has no represen
tatives, went an awful 4-24.
Maestri believed that increas
ing the size of the field would al
leviate some of the gripes from
West Coast coaches.
"We need to go to 64 teams,"
Maestri said. "That decision is
out of our hands." Maestri said he
does not expect that to happen in
the near future. He also disputed
the complaints from the Pacific.
"The West has had more
teams and more sites historical
ly than just about anybody in
the country," Maestri said.
Only three hosts are not top
seeds, and with USC also in the
Six-Pac, either Florida State or
Miami had to be sent to Stan
ford.
