# NCAA MEN'S TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS
## Cardinal gets to the heart of the matter 
### Joe Bialowitz Senior staff writer 
They say repeating as champi
ons is one of the most difficult
feats in sports. Maybe that is why
some people reckon Stanford
head coach Dick Gould is the best
in the business. After all, his
teams have now repeated on six
separate occasions during his 30-
year career as a coach.
According to senior team cap
tain Jeff Salzenstein, it was not
easy at all — until the team came
to Athens, the Cardinal's home
away from home. "I think repeat
ing was definitely tough," he said.
"I know some days in practice or
even in some matches this year, it
was really tough for me to get
fired up. Sometimes coach and I
questioned our sense of purpose
this year.
"But I knew that once we got to
Athens, it would all come togeth
-99
GF.
And it did. A gargantuan dis
play of heart against Georgia sent
Stanford to the finals, where it
dismantled highly-touted UCLA
— a team Gould calls the best he
has seen in five years — for the
first time in four attempts this
year. And the accomplishments
of beating Texas and USC in the
earlier rounds cannot be over
looked.
Stanford's domination in
Athens is a thing to ponder.
When the team gets Georgia on
its mind, incredible things seem
to happen. Salzenstein said, ' I
think it starts with Gould — the
way he handles himself on the
court, the things he says to us.
When we lost the doubles point,
he told us Cardinal teams fight
to the end."
Says UCLA head coach Billy
Martin, "Stanford is always a very
tough, tough team. If you don't go
out and beat them, they are never
going to beat themselves."
Jim Thomas points to some

thing teammate Grant Elliott
said on one of the first few days
they were in Athens: "Gosh I'm
feeling comfortable. The Road
Warriors (the team's nickname
for Thomas, Elliott and Ricky
Becker) are back."
And Thomas agrees with
Salzenstein regarding the aura of
Athens: "It was difficult some
times to get motivated, but once
we got here there was no question
in my mind we were going to fight
hard."
Martin says the key to Stan
ford's repeat performance was
the addition of Ryan Wolters to
the team as a replacement for
Scott Humphries, who left school
after his freshman year. Wolters
said before the match he was
aware of the fact he was the only
one on the team without a cham
pionship ring. "Now," he says,
"I'm the only one without two
rings."
There is no question Wolters
was a necessary addition to the
team. His 4-0 record in Athens at
tests to that. But there is some
thing more, something of a mys
tique that is hard to put one's fin
ger on.
Sports observers usually refer
to "heart" when they are trying
to explain an intangible quality of
a team or player. Gould remarked
several times in Athens on the
"heart" of his players. After
Becker fought off three match
points to keep the Cardinal alive
against the Bulldogs, Gould said,
"It takes a little bit of luck and a
lot of guts to win a match like
this."
Heart and guts. The qualities
of any champion, especially one
that repeats.
In the end, Stanford's suc
cess might be best summed up
by the words of Becker, who
borrowed a line from Houston
Rockets' Rudy Tomjanovich:
"Never underestimate the heart
of a champion."
