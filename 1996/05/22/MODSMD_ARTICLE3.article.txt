# Rabbi fills associate dean post at church
## Karlin-Neumann first Jewish leader at chapel 
### David Stein Contributing writer 
For the first time in University
history, a member of the Jewish
community will help direct the ever
changing religious population on
campus.
Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann
will begin work next year as one of
three new associate deans of reli

gious life at Memorial Church. No
other non-Christian has ever been
selected as an associate dean.
According to Dean of Memorial
Church Robert Gregg, Karlin-Neu
mann was a "star candidate with
great experience" whose appoint
ment helps reflect the religious di
versity of students.
"We've always had a long tradi
tion of Christian chaplains at the
church, but the demographics of the
campus have really changed," Gregg
said. "There are so many different
religious traditions now that [hiring
Karlin-Neumann] was perfectly ob
vious."
Gregg said the staff and students
who make use of the chaplains
"come to them as members of the
University, not with respect to their
individual religious identities."
Joining Karlin-Neumann next
year will be the Rev. Kelly Denton-

Borhaug, a Lutheran minister based
in San Francisco, and Maurice
Charles, who works at the Universi
ty of Chicago and will be ordained as
an Episcopal priest next year.
While all of the deans perform re
ligious ceremonies, Gregg said, their
main task is to help with non-de
nominational projects. He said more
than half of the deans' time is spent
counseling individuals and couples,
holding positions on University
committees and leading religious
and ethnic groups in dorms and
around campus.
Because a new perspective has
been added to the religious leader
ship, study groups may now be
taught with both Jewish and Christ
ian views on the same set of texts,

Gregg said.
Karlin-Neumann, who currently
leads a synagogue in Alameda, said
she is excited to "explore the world of
religious ideas" available to her next
year.
"I am less focused on the ritual of
religion and more on the different
lives in the community," she said. "I
am really looking forward to taking
part in a multi-faith chaplaincy."
Karlin-Neumann will begin on
Sept. 1, working approximately 30
percent of the time. The next year,
she will become a full-time employee.
Although she comes from an indi
vidual congregation, Karlin-Neu
mann has previously worked at
Princeton, UCLA and the Clare
mont Colleges, Gregg said.
