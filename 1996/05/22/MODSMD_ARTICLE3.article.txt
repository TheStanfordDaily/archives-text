### David Stein Contributing writer 
For the first time in University
history, a member of the Jewish
community will help direct the ever
changing religious population on
campus.
Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann
will begin work next year as one of
three new associate deans of reli

gious life at Memorial Church. No
other non-Christian has ever been
selected as an associate dean.
According to Dean of Memorial
Church Robert Gregg, Karlin-Neu
mann was a "star candidate with
great experience" whose appoint
ment helps reflect the religious di
versity of students.
