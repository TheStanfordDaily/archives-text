# 'Are you kidding me?'
## Freshman phenom Wolters caps off amazing 1996 tennis campaign 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
It has been one heck of a year for Ryan Wolters.
The freshman from San Jose has done more this year than most young
tennis players even dream of. In the span of one school year he has climbed
to the top of the ITA collegiate tennis rankings, won two national tourna
ments, brought the Sunshine Cup (the 18-and-under version of the Davis
Cup) back to the United States, faced off against Andre Agassi in his first
professional tournament and gone 4-0 in the NCAA team championships
including winning the clincher against UCLA in the finals.
To quote the freshman phenom's favorite phrase: "Are you kidding
me?"
Wolters started off his incredible year with a bang, becoming the first
freshman, and the first qualifier ever to win the ITA All-American Cham
pionship. To emerge as the victor of that tourney, he won nine consecutive
matches. In the finals he demolished UNLV's Roger Petterson, now the
No. 5 player in the country, 6-4, 6-2. The tournament in Austin was the
first leg of the college Grand Slam, and Wolters' win drew much attention
from the tennis world.
Still, many thought the victory was a fluke; just a freshman experienc
ing a little beginner's luck. Wolters soon quieted all critics by reaching the
finals of the Rolex Northern California Invitational. He lost to teammate
Paul Goldstein — his first loss of the year to his 14 wins.
On the strength early season tournament wins, Wolters' ranking
jumped from his pre-season slot of No. 75 all the way to No. 1. "I never
thought this could happen this year," Wolters said at the time. "I'm just
playing as well now as I ever have, and I hope I can keep it going."
Indeed, to say the freshman had been playing well would have been a
gross understatement. Wolters had accumulated a 22-1 record, by far the
best in the country.
By virtue of his No. 1 ranking, Wolters received a wild card entiy into
the Sybase Open, a professional tournament held at the San Jose arena By
the luck of the draw, he was chosen to face Andre Agassi in the first round.
As expected, he was beaten handily, 6-2,6-2, but the experience was one to
remember. He won over the San Jose crowd and was pictured on the front
of the San Francisco Chronicle and San Jose Mercury sports pages the next
day.
Wolters assumed the second singles position on the team, but after
recording easy victories over Hawaii, he lost his first match to Fresno
State's Fredrik Giers (No. 14). He then won five in a row, but had a some
what disappointing showing at the Rolex National Indoor Team Champi
onships in February.
It was after the 5-1 loss to UCLA that Wolters' sensational year began
to take a turn for the worse. He started to experience a throbbing sensation
in his left foot. It turned out to be a stress fracture, and the star was ordered
not to put pressure on the ailing foot for three weeks. Wolters was forced to
miss three matches, and when he came back, something was missing from
his game.
Wolters was moved down to the fourth spot in the lineup, to make room
for Jim Thomas, who was undefeated, in the top three positions. He played
four the rest of the regular season, winning seven matches, but losing twice
to USC. His ranking dropped 10 spots from where he was in the fall, and he
entered the NCAA tournament ranked No. 11.
"I feel like I've got back most of what I had early in the year," Wolters
said prior to the NCAAs. "I think I'm back on top of my game, and my foot
isn't affecting me at all. I really think I should play three in the tourna
ment. I think I could really do well there, and Paul (Goldstein) and Jim
(Thomas) haven't beaten Eric Taino (UCLA's third single player) yet this
year."
Head coach Dick Gould must have agreed, because he moved the fresh
man back onto the main courts, and slotted him at third singles for the
tourney.
Wolters responded. He beat Texas' Mark Loughin and USC's Manny
Ramirez in straight sets to pace the Cardinal in its first and second round
matches.
It was in the semifinals and finals that the freshman really stepped up
his game. With Stanford trailing to Georgia by a 3-2 margin, it was imper
ative that Wolters win his match against Bulldog captain Jaime Laschinger
(No. 85). With 4,000 rowdy Georgia fans yelling at the top of their lungs,
and Wolters trailing by one break, 3-0, in the third and final set, things
didn't look good for the team.
But Wolters showed composure and character uncharacteristic of a
freshman, and proceeded to win the next five games, before going on to
win his match, 6-4,4-6,6-4. "I can't say how proud I am of Ryan for com
ing through in that situation for us. He showed a lot of heart," said
Gould.
In Tuesday's final, Wolters became the first Stanford player to beat one
of UCLA's top three players this year. He lost the first set badly, but never
gave up, winning the next two for a 2-6,6-3,6-2 victory His match was the
fourth point for Stanford, the clincher.
As his Cardinal teammates and fans poured onto the third court, hug
ging him, a huge smile broke across the freshman's face. And why not? It
has been one heck of a year.
