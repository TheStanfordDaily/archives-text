## New study to look at therapy's effect on HIV-infected people 
### Yvette Delahoussaye Contributing writer 
Scientists at the Medical Cen
ter are preparing to study the ef
fect that intensive group therapy
has on both the quality of life and
the overall health of HIV-infected
individuals.
Previous studies with termi
nal breast cancer patients indicat
ed that those who participated in
this sort of group therapy were
less anxious and depressed, had
half of the pain and survived an
average of 18 months longer than
those patients who did not partic
ipate in the therapy, according to
Psychiatry Prof. David Spiegel,
principal investigator of the
study.
"We are interested to see if the
same model applies to people liv
ing with HIV," said Spiegel.
Currently, researchers are re
cruiting and interviewing poten
tial participants, according to
Acting Assoc. Psychiatry Prof.
Cheryl Koopman, the project di
rector.
"What's exciting and unique
about this study is that we are re

cruiting equal numbers of men
and women for the study. This
will give us the opportunity to
study the different issues faced by
each gender in dealing with a life
changing situation and to look at
the different ways people have of
coping," said Koopman.
The therapy, termed "sup
portive expressive group thera
py," will begin this summer both
at Stanford and at various loca
tions around the Bay Area. The
study is expected to last four
years, although volunteers need
only commit for one year.
According to Koopman, the
study is advantageous in that it
will be carried out at different
places around the Bay Area.
"Dennis Israelski, a co-investi
gator at the San Mateo County
Hospital, has been a big help in re
ferring patients to help guarantee
that our study will include low-in
come individuals. Too often,
word-of-mouth about these stud
ies tends to reach primarily the
more educated, and the studies
are not as inclusive as they could
be," said Koopman.
The goal of the treatment is to

help the patients build new sup
port networks and, through in
tensive psychotherapy, help them
re-assess their lives and priori
ties, said Spiegel.
"In a common sense way, we
know that there is a connection
between a person's physical
health and state of mind. We are
devising ways to measure this
connection directly," said Spiegel.
"Also, in a practical sense, we
want to change the way that med
icine is practiced. Increasingly,
insurance companies treat medi
cine as a commodity. However,
we are seeing that feeling cared
for and supported throughout an
illness helps improve the outcome
of the patient," added Spiegel.
A future aim of the research is
to look at changes in the immune
system in response to therapy.
"There is evidence that marital
stress decreases a person's ability
to produce certain molecules
needed for fighting off disease.
Perhaps undergoing therapy and
learning to deal with living with
HIV will help these patients bol
ster certain functions of the im
mune system," said Spiegel.
