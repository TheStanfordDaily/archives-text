# Tuition perks may face cuts
## Effects of OMB plan broad 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
A recent federal government
policy change may jeopardize
Stanford's tuition benefits pro
gram unless the University ad
ministration finds alternate rev
enue sources.
Through the University's
fringe benefits pool, individuals
employed by Stanford for at least
five years are entitled to as much
as half the cost of Stanford's tu
ition to fund undergraduate edu
cation for their children. The
University contributes two
thirds of the funding, and the
federal government supports the
rest.
However, in a May 8 policy
shift by the Office of Manage
ment and Budget, the federal
government will no longer con
tribute money to tuition benefits
beginning Sept. 1, 1999. Among
other reasons, officials cited the
uniqueness of this perquisite to
higher education as cause for its
elimination.
The program's fate is unde

cided, Provost Condoleezza Rice
said yesterday, but the Universi
ty will work rapidly to find a so
lution if there is one, she said.
"We're reviewing the situa
tion," Rice said. "We certainly
understand the?■

importance of
this benefit.
"I don't know
what we're going
to do yet," she
said. "We really
have to take a
hard look at it."
The OMB's
announcement

is part of larger decision which
places further restrictions on
how universities spend federal
funds. The impact will be felt at
Stanford, but its force is un
known, administrators say.
The move to cut the federally
funded tuition benefits, unlike
some of the other federal restric
tions, came as a surprise to the
administration, Rice said, al
though the measure was origi-

nally proposed in February
1995. The University conducted
negotiations with the OMB and
hoped to convince the organiza
tion to allow universities to re
tain use of the funds for tuition
benefits.
"We tried to make the case,"
Rice said. "We lost."
Stanford, which gives all its
employees 30 cents of every
salaried dollar in benefits, pays
for two-thirds of the tuition al
lowance from its decreasing gen
eral operating budget. In the last
two years, the University has
slashed $10.9 million from the
budget with an additional $3.1
million planned for the 1997 fis
cal year.
Along with Rice, University
Budget Director Tim Warner
and Vice President of Faculty
and Staff Services Barbara But
terfield will examine the feasibil
ity of continuing the program
and, Rice said, will hopefully
provide an answer this summer.
The problem, said Jim
Franklin, associate vice presi
dent for total compensation, is
finding a source of revenue.
"We don't know what re
sponse that could be," he said.
"There are many possibilities. It
could be discontinued, or it could
be kept totally in place.
"If we keep it in place, how
would we pay for it?" Franklin
said.
Rice said she disagreed with
the OMB's decision and called
the benefits, which are given by

many private universities, a le
gitimate use of federal funds.
"We think it's totally appro
priate that in a competitive envi
ronment it be a good benefit,"
Rice said. "It seems perfectly
logical that a university would
want to extend the possibility to
do this. [The OMB'sl argument
didn't hold."
In the statement, the OMB
said "allowing dependent tuition
benefits to educational institu
tions would provide allowable
costs for only one group of
grantees and contractors."
Should the University decide
to discontinue the program,
Dean of Students Marc Wais, a
parent of two young children,
said it would mean a big loss to
employees with children.
"Clearly it would be disap
pointing that there could be less
support," said Wais, who said
the package was very attractive
when he signed with Stanford
last summer. "I would be in
favor of parents receiving the
same benefits, although I recog
nize the expense and drain it
puts on the University."
A University decision to dis
continue the perquisite would
not be met favorably by a union
of food service, maintenance and
other technical employees, the
union's senior field representa
tive said.
The contract between the
University and its staff members
states that the tuition benefit
will be provided, said Rusty
Smith, senior field representa
tive for Local 715 of the Stanford
chapter of the Service Employ
ees International Union. About
1,200 Stanford employees are

members of the union, he said.
"The contract says nothing
about that they will only provide
benefits if they get it from the
federal government," Smith
said. "This benefit is provided by
our contracts with the Universi
ty, although we'll certainly talk
to [the University] if we end up
in a bind."
OMB's new policy comes just
two years after it announced it
will disallow federal funds from
being used toward graduate stu
dent tuition remission.
Currently, graduate students
who teach sections are designat
ed as half-time employees and

are allowed to take nine units for
free in addition to their salary.
The tuition is covered 40 percent
by the federal government, with
the remainder borne by the Uni
versity. The government pays 50
percent of the applicable tuition
at the School of Medicine.
However, beginning Sept. 1,
1998, the federal government is
pulling its funding out of the pot,
and, to continue reimbursing
graduate students, the faculty
members who sponsor them
must use their own grant money

to cover tuition remission.
"It should not have an effect
on individual graduate stu
dents," Rice said. "It has an ef
fect on how they are funded."
To combat a possible decrease
in graduate students, University
President Gerhard Casper an
nounced on May 9 the Graduate
Fellows program which, in addi
tion to bringing top graduate
students to Stanford, will dis
tance the degree to which the
University is dependent on the
federal government for research
support.
The University is entering
into cost-sharing agreements
with faculty members, Rice said.
"There's a last attempt to get
the OMB to reconsider," Rice
said. "I don't know what the
chances are there."
Another federal decision to
disallow universities from using
federal money as housing assis
tance benefits in 1992 is just one
of the many factors which led
Stanford's budget and research
heads to begin searching for
stronger revenue sources than
the federal government.
"We've been careful on our
budgeting the last few years,"
said Dean of Research Charles
Kruger. "There's a certain
amount of reserve built into the
budget for this type of thing."
In the May 8 document, the
OMB added a number of other
restrictions which will limit the
extent of its funding of universi
ties and could ultimately de
crease Stanford's indirect-cost
rate. It will implement virtually
all of the measures it originally
proposed in February 1995.
A change likely to be lauded

by longtime Stanford followers,
however, is OMB's decision to
obliterate the term "indirect
cost"from its vocabulary. Indi
rect costs — overhead costs
which arise from federal funding
— will be broken down into "fa
cilities" and "administrative"
costs to more accurately reflect
their origin.
"The intention here is to try
to get away from indirect costs as
a term simply because it has so

much baggage on it," said Larry
Horton, director of government
and community relations. "It's a
loaded term. I'd be thrilled not to
discuss it anymore."
Indirect cost disputes with
the Office of Naval Research, the
federal agency with which the
University negotiates, ended in a
$1.2 million settlement in Octo
ber 1994, bad press and ulti
mately led to the resignation of
then-University President Don
ald Kennedy.

In a more complicated policy
change which is not being re
ceived well by Stanford, the
OMB will no longer accept cer
tain cost studies through which
universities negotiate federal re
imbursement rates for libraries,
utilities and student services.
"We're still looking at the im
pact, but it's likely to [lead to a
funding] decrease," said Sara
Bible, Stanford's director of cost
and rate studies.
Bible, who represents Stan
ford on a committee composed of
delegates from Naval Research,
the Office of Health and Human
Services and 10 other universi
ties, is hopeful the OMB will ac
cept a proposal adopted by the
committee in October which will
mollify but not eliminate the po
tential decrease in federal fund
ing.
"They're studying it," Bible
said. "We're hoping they put it
into place."
The cost rate analysis
changes, if they occur as
planned, will begin in September
1998 and, Kruger said, should
decrease Stanford's indirect
cost recovery rate, or, as it may
soon be called, the facilities and
administrative cost recovery
rate.
The Clinton administration is
also disallowing universities
from renegotiating reimburse
ment rates, or indirect costs,
after the original agreement
with the federal government is
reached. Currently, universities
can alter facility and administra
tive cost rates, but this change
will force universities to negoti
ate rates once for the life of spon
sored agreements.
