# Time to vote again
## Leaders hope for high voter turnout, many students aren't aware of election

A special election for a single
president began yesterday at
midnight, as members of the
Elections Commission took steps
to solicit the student vote.
Members of the commission
have attempted to publicize the
election to students.
"We've done fliering, posted
mass e-mails to graduate stu
dents and put tons of ads in The
Daily to boost voter turnout,"
Elections Commissioner Ryan
Medders said. But, he admitted,
"We're not expecting a huge
turnout."
Typically, special elections
have not generated a large voter
turnout, as with last year's spe
cial election for the Balanced
Funding Deal which saw a 25

A special election for a single
president and graduate student
council will be held today and to
morrow. Polls opened at mid

on the World Wide Web. The

ford.edu/.
In addition, paper ballots will
be available from 10 a.m. to 4

percent voter turnout.
Medders added that "Consti
tution '96" mandates simple ma
jority balloting, rather than the
preferential balloting used in the
last election.
If no presidential ticket wins a
majority of the votes, a runoff
election will be held, according to

Medders.
When asked what they
thought about the special elec
tion, undergraduates offered re
sponses which ranged from apa
thetic to frustrated.
Freshman Brian Bolz said,
"What election? I've seen some
fliers, but I had no idea that
there was actually an election or
anything. I didn't read the
fliers."
Those who did read the fliers
seemed unimpressed with their

contents.
"From the fliers and things
I've seen around, I was not im
pressed," said freshman Wenson
Chern. "I have nothing really to
go on because everything seems
so trite, not very informative."
Despite cautioning that his
knowledge of the election is
"vague," junior Felix Yeung, who
is majoring in English and Com
munication, is optimistic about
having a single president. Yeung
said, "I think originally the idea

of a Council of Presidents was a
good one because they could di
vide the job. But things didn't get
done because the COP spent a lot
of time bickering."
Sophomore Jenny Ellickson,
who is majoring in Modern
Thought and Literature, also
said she felt a single president
will lead to expediency in the po
litical process.
Ellickson said she thinks a
single president is "a really good
idea because it is a lot easier to

get a consensus with one person
than with four."
Law School students, whose
academic year has finished, will
still be able to vote either
through the elections address on
the World Wide Web or through
absentee ballots.
Medders said one law student
has approached him for a ballot.
The special election also in
cludes elections for the graduate
student council, a position simi
lar to Senior Class presidents.

Students can elect two represen
tatives from each of three dis
tricts: the Schools of Engineer
ing and Earth Sciences; the
Schools of Humanities and Sci
ences and Education; and the
Schools of Law, Business and
Medicine.
Trisha Tang is running as the
representative from the School
of Humanities and Sciences.
Mercedes Salomon is running as
the representative from the Law
School.
