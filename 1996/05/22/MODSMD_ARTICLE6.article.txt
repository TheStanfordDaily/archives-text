# Hoover Tower: Student tour guides tell all
## 
### Chad Bennett Contributing writer 
According to Stanford tour guide Vikram
Bhagat, the most common reaction to the view
from Hoover Tower's 250-foot observation plat
form is one of awe.
"People say 'Wow, Stanford's huge,' " said
Bhagat, a sophomore.
Tour guide Sonya Cotero, a senior, agreed.
"People are like "Ooh!' They're just kind of
amazed that Stanford is so large."
Taking visitors up Hoover Tower, which was
built in 1941, is only one of the many duties Bha
gat and Cotero fulfill as Stanford tour guides.
They also greet visitors, give daily campus tours
and run an information booth in Tresidder
Union. "We're übiquitous," said Cotero.
"There's always a guide around to answer ques
tions."
Stanford tour guides, who are currently being
hired for next year, are trained to answer these
questions by memorizing an information manu
al crammed full of factoids. Any tour guide can
tell you that the voice of Betty Rubble graduated
from Stanford; Terman engineering building
was built without nails; there are 7,777 pipes in
Memorial Church's organ; and White Plaza is
named for two of Raymond White's children, one
of whom died in a surfing accident.
According to tour guide Tarlan Hedayati, a
senior, Stanford is also the only university to own
a shopping center. "So Victoria's Secret funds
Stanford," said Hedayati.
"You have to learn everything about Stan
ford," said senior Adam Fingerhut, a tour guide.
"So you are sort of a walking, talking encyclope

dia of Stanford. A backwards walking, talking en
cyclopedia of Stanford."
Bhagat took it a step further, adding, "Some
times I feel like Stanford incarnate. People meet
you and you are Stanford."
One of the few drawbacks to embodying Stan

ford is, accordingto Fingerhut, havingto deal with
less than intelligent inquiries. "People always ask
when the 11 o'clock tour is," said Fingerhut.
According to Cotero, tour guides working at


Chad Bennett — Daily
Stanford tour guides — from left to right, seniors Sonya Cotero and Adam Fingerhut, mas
ter's student Tristan Ching and senior Gerardo Estolano — are adept professionals at the
art of walking backwards around campus, as well as operating the Hoover Tower elevator.
Hoover Tower's ticket desk must be
on the lookout for more than the oc
casional stupid question. "People
frequently come up and they're like,
'I've got my son here with me. What
does it take to get into Stanford?
What sort of test scores?' This hap
pened to a tour guide once and, luck
ily, he said all the right tilings: *You
can't really formulate it,' etc. It
turned out the man asking the ques
tions was Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions James Montoya."
Incognito administrators pose an
acute threat to Cotero, who claimed
she wouldn't recognize well-known
figures such as Montoya or Provost

Condoleezza Rice.
While most of Hoover Tower's
visitors are tourists, or, according to
Cotero, "families with 14-year-old
children who are looking at the Uni
versity," sometimes visitors are
well-known. According to Hedayati,
past visitors have included former
Secretary of State George Shultz
and Ross Perot's former running
mate, Adm. James Stockdale. "You
see Stockdale all the time," said He
dayati. Both Shultz and Stockdale
are research fellows at the nearby
Hoover Institution.
Cotero has also had a brush with
fame while working at Hoover
Tower. "The governor of Massa
chusetts came one day when I was
working. Secret Service agents had
to clear the whole building, and I
got to sit in the elevator with

them," said Cotero.
Sometimes visitors aren't note
worthy, just unusual. Said Heday
ati, "We had a psych section up (on
the platform) last week. I have no
idea why. The TA thought it would
be cute to have section up there, I
guess. He had all these blankets laid
out. Normally, we wait with them up
at the top, but this time we came
back down. It was kind of a pain."
According to Fingerhut, the best
part of taking visitors up Hoover
Tower is not sighting well-known
people or encountering odd situa
tions — it's his co-workers. Said Fin
gerhut, "It's a great group of people.
I love them all."
Bhagat agreed, "It's like they boil
out all the nerds."
"It's a sweet job," said Cotero.
"Everyone should apply."
