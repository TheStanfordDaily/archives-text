# Hoover Tower: Student tour guides tell all
## 
### Chad Bennett Contributing writer 
According to Stanford tour guide Vikram
Bhagat, the most common reaction to the view
from Hoover Tower's 250-foot observation plat
form is one of awe.
"People say 'Wow, Stanford's huge,' " said
Bhagat, a sophomore.
Tour guide Sonya Cotero, a senior, agreed.
"People are like "Ooh!' They're just kind of
amazed that Stanford is so large."
Taking visitors up Hoover Tower, which was
built in 1941, is only one of the many duties Bha
gat and Cotero fulfill as Stanford tour guides.
They also greet visitors, give daily campus tours
and run an information booth in Tresidder
Union. "We're übiquitous," said Cotero.
"There's always a guide around to answer ques
tions."
Stanford tour guides, who are currently being
hired for next year, are trained to answer these
questions by memorizing an information manu
al crammed full of factoids. Any tour guide can
tell you that the voice of Betty Rubble graduated
from Stanford; Terman engineering building
was built without nails; there are 7,777 pipes in
Memorial Church's organ; and White Plaza is
named for two of Raymond White's children, one
of whom died in a surfing accident.
According to tour guide Tarlan Hedayati, a
senior, Stanford is also the only university to own
a shopping center. "So Victoria's Secret funds
Stanford," said Hedayati.
"You have to learn everything about Stan
ford," said senior Adam Fingerhut, a tour guide.
"So you are sort of a walking, talking encyclope

dia of Stanford. A backwards walking, talking en
cyclopedia of Stanford."
Bhagat took it a step further, adding, "Some
times I feel like Stanford incarnate. People meet
you and you are Stanford."
One of the few drawbacks to embodying Stan

ford is, accordingto Fingerhut, havingto deal with
less than intelligent inquiries. "People always ask
when the 11 o'clock tour is," said Fingerhut.
According to Cotero, tour guides working at
