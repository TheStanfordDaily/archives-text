# Chem prof heads National Science Board
## Zare elected to two-year term as chairman of prestigious organization 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
The National Science Board,
the governing body of the Na
tional Science Foundation, elect
ed Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare
as its chairman at a meeting last
week.
"Being chairman of the board
has some awesome responsibili
ties," said Zare. "I am both de
lighted and terrified."
Zare said he hopes to lead the
board into more active champi
oning of science and engineering
research. "The reasons for sup
porting science and engineering

are just as pressing as they ever
were," Zare said. "Supporting
science is an enabling factor —
we are really giving society a
chance to do something about its
economy."
The National Science Board is
made up of 24 members from
mostly businesses and universi
ties. Members serve a six-year
term, and officers serve for two
years. Zare said he felt honored
to be chosen as chair, as the last
few chairs have been university
presidents, and"I am just a
chemistry prof," he said.
As a professor still active in
teaching and research, Zare said

he hopes to emphasize these
parts of science and engineering.
"I don't consider the sciences to
be only physical — social and be
havioral sciences receive a lot of
support from the National Sci
ence Foundation, and those
areas are less developed than
physical science."
The false notion that science
is only about discoveries or in
ventions surrounds the field,
suggested Zare. "The process of
science also produces skilled peo
ple, which we need to compete as
a country in all areas.
"People are asking for short
term practical gains from sci

ence. There is an erosion of faith
in the institutions which do sci
ence. We need to make it clear to
people the importance of doing
science and engineering."
Having devoted his time to
studying what happens when
molecules collide, Zare is known
for his research in laser chem
istry. He developed technique to
use laser-induced fluorescence in
studying reaction dynamics.
Zare earned his bachelor's and
doctoral degrees from Harvard
University and taught at MIT,
the University of Colorado and
Columbia University before com
ing to Stanford in 1977.
