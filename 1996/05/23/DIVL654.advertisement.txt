Don't you just love these
evening walks in the spring? The
weather is perfect, the stars are out,
everything kx)ks and smells
brand new...
You really
""are unbelievable! You turn a
perfectly wonderful walk into yet
another seque involving Applewcxxl.
Have you ever thought about
moving in there for good?
Uh, yeah, I do
enjoy these walks, and yeah it
smells great out here, but I think
that's because we're so close to
Applewood Pizza!
Of
course I've thought
about it! But I could never
give up these lovely walks
with you.

Great Pizza within walking distance!
