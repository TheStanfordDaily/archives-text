# Just say Saroyan
## Green scores papers from UC-Berkeley 
### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
California legend and prolific
writer William Saroyan joined lit
erary greats John Steinbeck and
Ernest Hemingway in Stanford's
Special Collections in Green Li
brary when more than 4,000 of his
literary works, papers and docu
ments were recently given to the
University as a gift.
Stanford acquired Saroyan's
works after Robert Setrakian, the
executor of the Saroyan estate and
director of the William Saroyan
Foundation, began looking into a
permanent home for Saroyan's
collection.
Saroyan's works had previous
ly been divided between UC-
Berkeley's Bancroft Library and
Saroyan's estate in his hometown
of Fresno, Calif. But Saroyan, al
though he favored storing his col
lection at Bancroft, preferred to
store all the items together. Stan
ford was the only place to offer fa
cilities for the entire collection,
which also includes pebbles, glass
shards and mustache clippings.
The late Saroyan authored nu
merous works, including his col
lection of short stories "The Dar
ing Young Man on the Flying
Trapeze." He was awarded the
Pulitzer Prize in 1938 for"The
Time of Your Life," but declined it,
saying the play was "no more
great" than his other works.
More than 900 boxes of manu
scripts, contracts, letters and di
aries have already been transport
ed from Fresno to Stanford, and
several hundred more boxes are
still to come.
Stanford University Librarian
and Director of Academic Infor-
mation Resources Michael Keller
said Saroyan was "a man so con
cerned with posterity that he kept
everything."
Keller said Stanford will serve
as a "cultural custodian" for the
Saroyan collection, adding that
Stanford is only one of many large
repositories in which special liter
ary collections are housed.
Anthony Angiletta, assistant
University librarian for collec
tions, said Saroyan's collection in
cludes some surprises. The collec
tion reportedly contains such odd
ities as mustache clippings and
glass shards collected on bike
rides.
"There may be some odd things
that turn up," Angiletta said.

The Special Collections person
nel will begin organizing and clas
sifying the Saroyan materials im
mediately. A manuscripts librari
an will work with a curator for
British and American literature to
interpret the materials.
Once the collection is sorted,
Stanford faculty and students will
be able to access the manuscripts
and memoirs of one of the most
prolific writers of the 20th centu
ry-
Angiletta said "the archive will
generate interest that wasn't
there before."
Although the collection will be
available for independent re
searchers, the Stanford communi
ty will benefit most directly,
Angiletta said. "Our first interest
is always Stanford faculty and stu
dents," he said.
English Department Chair Jay
Fliegelman said the Saroyan col

lection will allow scholars to exam
ine "an important window in liter
ary production."
"The Saroyan archive will let us
look at a complex literary career
and see possible relationships be
tween literature and politics,"
Fliegelman said.
Angiletta said Stanford may
also be interested in Saroyan mate
rials which are currently privately
owned.
"We will probably make some
inquiries regarding the value of
outlying materials to see whether
or not they are worth pursuing,"
Angiletta said.
The son of an Armenian immi
grant, Saroyan was born in Fresno
in 1908. He wrote hundreds of short
stories, novels, plays and essays,
many of which were never pub
lished. He wrote the Pulitzer Priye
winning "The Time of Your Life" in
six days. Saroyan died in 1981.
