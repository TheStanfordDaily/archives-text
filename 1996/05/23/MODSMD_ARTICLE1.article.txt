# Just say Saroyan
## Green scores papers from UC-Berkeley 
### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
California legend and prolific
writer William Saroyan joined lit
erary greats John Steinbeck and
Ernest Hemingway in Stanford's
Special Collections in Green Li
brary when more than 4,000 of his
literary works, papers and docu
ments were recently given to the
University as a gift.
Stanford acquired Saroyan's
works after Robert Setrakian, the
executor of the Saroyan estate and
director of the William Saroyan
Foundation, began looking into a
permanent home for Saroyan's
collection.
Saroyan's works had previous
ly been divided between UC-
Berkeley's Bancroft Library and
Saroyan's estate in his hometown
of Fresno, Calif. But Saroyan, al
though he favored storing his col
lection at Bancroft, preferred to
store all the items together. Stan
ford was the only place to offer fa
cilities for the entire collection,
which also includes pebbles, glass
shards and mustache clippings.
The late Saroyan authored nu
merous works, including his col
lection of short stories "The Dar
ing Young Man on the Flying
Trapeze." He was awarded the
Pulitzer Prize in 1938 for"The
Time of Your Life," but declined it,
saying the play was "no more
great" than his other works.
More than 900 boxes of manu
scripts, contracts, letters and di
aries have already been transport
ed from Fresno to Stanford, and
several hundred more boxes are
still to come.
