# Republicans fight wage increase
## Clinton vows to veto bill eliminating wage protections for workers 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Backed by
President Clinton's veto threat,
Democrats accused House Republicans
yesterday of trying to sabotage an
increase in the minimum wage by creat
ing a loophole to exempt millions of work
ers.
"If Congress sends me a bill to elimi
nate the minimum wage and wage protec
tions for millions of workers, I will veto
it," Clinton said in a written statement
issued as debate was unfolding on the
House floor.
Republicans defended their proposal as
necessary to prevent the loss of jobs as
labor costs rise, and Speaker Newt Gin
grich said he doubted Clinton would fol
low through on his veto threat.
The purpose behind several GOP pro
visions, Gingrich said, is to help "small
business and help create jobs for the veiy
people who most need that very first job."
The minimum wage proposal itself,
opposed by many Republicans, would
establish a 90-cent increase in two steps
over the current $4.25 an hour — a 50-
cent hike on July 1 and a 40-cent increase
a year later.
Republican leaders agreed to permit a

vote on the measure only after about two
dozen GOP moderates broke ranks this
spring and joined Democrats in support
ing the increase.
Debate on the legislation was delayed
for several hours as GOP leaders strug
gled to balance competing demands of
moderates and conservatives. By day's
end, they decided to postpone votes on the
measure until today.
Before quitting for the night, the
House approved, 414-10, a package of
GOP-crafled tax breaks for small business
intended to offset any economic hardship
caused by a minimum wage increase.
Even so, the future of the bill was in
doubt. Several Democrats, including the
party's leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, announced they would vote
against the legislation if conservatives
succeeded in attaching a measure
designed to exempt employees of many
small businesses.
The furor over a proposed exemption
for small businesses was the latest incar
nation of a brutal political struggle over
an increase in the minimum wage that
Democrats and Clinton have been
demanding for months. Supporters say an

increase is necessary because, when infla
tion is taken to account, the purchasing
power of the minimum wage is at a 40-
year low. Opponents say an increase
would result in lost jobs as business
adjusted to higher labor costs.
In a statement that echoed Democratic
comments made on the House floor, Clin
ton said, "We must not tolerate sweat
shops and a repeal of wage protections for
millions of Americans as a condition of
assuring a living wage for some workers."
Injecting the presidential campaign
into the debate, Clinton also called on
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, the
GOP presidential candidate-to-be, to "join
me in opposing this extreme measure."
Dole's Senate spokesman had no
immediate response to the president.
But in floor debate, House Republicans
offered a strong rebuttal, with several of
them saying the provision built on a mea
sure strongly backed by Democrats sever
al years ago.
Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., said,
"Increasing a federally mandated mini
mum wage is a job killer. It's something
that's going to jeopardize jobs for" low
wage workers.
