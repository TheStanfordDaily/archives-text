### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Federal
officials seized $4 million in
weapons and arrested representa
tives of two Chinese arms compa
nies on smuggling charges yester
day in what agents called the largest
seizure of smuggled automatic
weapons in American history.
The representatives of the state
owned China Northern Industrial
Corp., also known as Norinco, and
Poly Technologies, a related compa
ny that manufactures weapons for
the Chinese military, were charged
with smuggling 2,000 AK-47 fully
automatic rifles, The New York
Times and the Ixxs Angeles Times
reported today.
Federal officials said it was the
largest seizure of smuggled auto
matic weapons in American history.
Norinco and Poly Technologies

are two of China's biggest arms
traders, although in the past few
years they have tried to diversify
into other areas of industry and
commerce. Both have strong ties to
the military and senior leadership;
Poly Technologies president is lie
Ping, the son-in-law of China's
senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
More than 90 federal agents
seized the weapons and arrested at
least eight suspects in the San Fran
cisco Bay area. The suspects includ
ed American citizens and Chinese
visiting or living in the United
States, the Times reported.
The arrests followed a 16-month
sting operation during which agents
of the Treasury Department's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms posed as arms traffickers.
The agents were working on a

deal with the representatives that
focused on the AK-47 and also dealt
with more sophisticated systems
ranging from hand-held anti-air
craft missiles, to explosives and
other devices, The New York Times
reported, quoting an unidentified
official familiar with the investiga
tion.
The arrests occurred before the
agents had time to negotiate over
the more sophisticated weaponry,
The New York Times reported.
Officials said they focused on the
companies because they have evi
dence that they had previously
smuggled other weapons into the
United States, the Times reported.
It was unclear if the representa
tives had sold the goods for personal
profit or if the sale was sanctioned
by the company itself.
