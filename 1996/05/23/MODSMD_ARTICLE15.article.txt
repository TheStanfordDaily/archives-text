Oxygen generators banned
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government plans
to prohibit all passenger airlines from transporting
oxygen generators like the ones suspected in the Val
uJet crash, an administration official said last night.
The Transportation Department will make the
announcement today, and it will be effective imme
diately through the end of this year while investiga
tors continue a safety review, said the official, who
spoke on condition that his name not be used.
"The department believes this to be an appropri
ate and prudent step to assure ourselves and the
public that we are continuing to maintain the high
est level of aviation safety," he said.
Current regulations allow airlines that are autho
rized to carry hazardous materials to carry the oxy
gen generators as cargo. ValuJet was not authorized
to carry them, but the airplane that crashed in the

Florida Everglades had 119 of the canisters in its
cargo area.
Court to re-think abortion law
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The state Supreme
Court, with decisive votes from its two newest
members, agreed yesterday to reconsider its April
4 ruling upholding California's parental consent
law for minors' abortions.
Since last month's ruling, Chief Justice Mal
colm Lucas and Justice Armand Arabian, both
members of the 4-3 majority, have retired.
The two newest justices, both appointees of
Gov. Pete Wilson, joined the three previous dis
senters to vote for a rehearing.
The 1987 law requires an unmarried woman
under 18, living at home, to get permission from
at least one parent from an abortion.
