GPAs should be visible
in Axess and an option
for offical transcripts

WITH DEBATE ALREADY
swirling around grade-pol
icy changes, University
Registrar Roger Printup is consid
ering offering grade-point averages
over Axess and / or printing them
on Stanford's transcripts, raising
questions about the nature of both
a transcript and a GPA.
If a transcript is a record of aca
demic history, then a list of classes
and the grades received in them
seems sufficient. Graduate schools
and some employers, however, view
a transcript as a means by which
they can judge academic achieve
ment and potential. Thus, the GPA
can also be a quick, statistical mea
sure of scholastic success. This
interpretation could become prob
lematic.
Reducing academics to a single
number makes it much easier to
compare performance — perhaps
inaccurately. This could change
the academic atmosphere at
Stanford. The University is
already academically competitive,
and judgments concerning one's
grades and class load are preva
lent. By having actual numbers
with which to fuel these judg
ments, Stanford could become a
campus where students know —
and C0Tfce>i*'" , themselvS3 — with
others' grades. Changing our v pol
icy simply to make it similar to
other schools is a flimsy reason.
On the other hand, it is impor
tant that students know what
exists in their University files.
Stanford alreadv calculates a GPA

for each student, and this number
is used for various awards and dis
tinctions, including Phi Beta Kappa
and Rhodes Scholarship nomina
tions. So that these nominations do
not seem arbitrary — thereby
reducing the weight they carry as
academic achievement awards —
students must have their GPA
made available to them. Axess
allows students to find out any
aspect of their academic record, and
a calculated GPA would be a logical
addition.
Printing the GPA on transcripts,
however, is a more complex issue.
Mandatory GPA appearances bring
up the issues of academic competi
tion and interpretation of academic
achievement. It seems the best way
to skirt these potential problems is
to make printing GPAs optional.
Students who feel GPAs should be
printed on their transcript can elect
to do so. Keeping this an option —
and not a requirement — allows
students to decide for themselves
how they wish to view and present
their own academic achievement.
In addition, because a GPA
weighs all grades in all classes of
identical units equally, it removes
emphasis from individual classes. A
low grade in one freshman math
class, for example, may lower one's
GPA, creating an inaccurate picture
of academic performance. To reme
dy this, the Registrar's Office
should offer separate GPAs — one
for a person's major and a cumula
tive average.
The debate regarding what a
transcript and GPA stand for has
no definitive answer, ifi acknowl
edgment of this, the Registrar's
Office should make optional print
ing GPAs on transcripts. To
acknowledge students' right to
know what exists in their own aca
demic files, GPAs should be avail
able on Axess.
