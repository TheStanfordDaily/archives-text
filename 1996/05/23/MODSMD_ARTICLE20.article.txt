## Stanford's price for ideals 
### 
LAST WEEK'S CAREER Fair was
pretty distressing for me, but every
career fair makes me twitch. In
fact, I would have completely avoided this
last one had the forces of the universe not
conspired to impress the Career Fair on
me.
I was going through my usual routine
that day — write in the LaIR, black bean
and-rice burrito at the CoHo, orange soda
at Tres Ex, back to writing in the LaIR —
when two supernatural events forever
changed my destiny. It rained and I ran
out of print quota. So I headed towards
the ATM machines and the Career Fair
moved inside. We collided in the Tresid
der Lounge.
I was sucked into the jet stream of
suits and little leather folders, bounced
between engineering firms and invest
ment bankers. I felt myself spiraling into
the management-consult ing vortex at the
center of it all. But somehow I gained a
foothold at the AmeriCorp table and
began clawing my way back out of the
maw. Hand over hand, past the public
service table, a strong boost from the
Peace Corps folks, and finally I saw the
light of day. I dashed for the exit, but was
stopped in my tracks by the hideous beast
guarding the gates of this inferno on
earth — the military recruiters.
I hate military recruiters. They would
never hire me, but not because I'm not
qualified. I could be Norman Schwarzkopf
and they wouldn't hire me because I've

said the magic words: "I'm gay."
This University doesn't allow discrim
ination on the basis of sexual orientation.
The military discriminates on the basis of
sexual orientation. The activities of the
CPPC fall somewhere in between this
discrepancy. In the interest of educating
students about all possible employment
options, the CPPC has a policy of allow
ing all employers to recruit who do not
unlawfully discriminate and "agree to
talk in good faith" with all students who
sign up and "meet the employer's legiti
mate specifications." Thus, a small eddy
has been carved out to allow the military
recruiters, who lawfully discriminate, to
be present on our campus. They can
meet, interview, recruit and discriminate
in a fashion clearly forbidden by Stan
ford's policies.
The real issue lurking behind this
compromise is Stanford's dependence on
government contracts; specifically, con
tracts from the Defense Department. The
federal government has ruled all institu
tions which receive such contracts must
allow military recruiters access to their
campuses. Violating this mandate would
jeopardize a great deal of research and
funding at this University.
The CPPC's compromise is a logical
one, and I understand why it has been
made. But it is still discomforting to know
that Stanford will compromise its anti-dis
crimination principles if the price is right.
There are other employers who dis

criminate against gays and lesbians.
Cracker Barrel, a company which pro
duces cheese and fruit baskets for gift
giving, had a policy of summarily dis
missing gay or lesbian employees. If
Cracker Barrel was paying Stanford to
develop exciting new cheeses or engineer
flame-retardant gift baskets, would we
would allow them onto our campus? In
short, how much money would they have
to give us before we ditched our anti-dis
crimination policies?
The standard of "unlawful discrimina
tion" is really very low. In 41 states there
is still no legal protection on the basis of
sexual orientation. That means that
within those states anyone, gay or
straight, can be fired solely because of
who they are, and they will have no legal
recourse.
Stanford has committed itself to a
higher standard, affirming that on its
campus sexual orientation is not a legiti
mate basis for discrimination. If Stanford
values this ideal and believes it has some
right to sovereignty on this issue, it
should stop making compromises. Then
maybe the Career Fair would reflect our
values instead of serving as a commen
tary on their selling price.
