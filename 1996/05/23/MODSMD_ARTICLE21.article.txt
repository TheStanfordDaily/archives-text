Mahood's efforts in the Fac Sen should be appreciated

I NORMALLY RESIST the urge to pen
a response to any of the letters, but I
felt my input on the criticism of Prof.
(Jail Mahood could be important.
First of all, as contrary to student
convention as this idea seems, professors
at this school deserve some respect
inherently. By all counts, it is one of the
five or so best academic research and
teaching schools in the country, and that
with its accomplished athletics program.
Getting in was ridiculously difficult as an
undergraduate, as we all know by the
number of our friends that had to go to
Cornell and Berkeley (heh, heh). I won
der if undergrads ever stop to think how
hard it must be to get a faculty position
here. Knowing the accentuation of
research in the tenure granting process,
isn't it amazing that Mahood cares
enough about undergrad education to
spend hours debating it and trying to
make (in my opinion) needed reforms?
This doesn't affect her compensation,
people. She already received tenure for
being a world-class researcher. She could
be writing books she can collect royalties
from (this isn't a joke; many faculty do

consulting or writing on the side to aug
ment their income). Like it or not, she
must be doing it because she cares. Many
of us deeply appreciate her commitment.
Students should be respectful and
thoughtful in their criticism of our
world-renowned faculty that give so
much of their time to undergrads.
Secondly, even if Martellotto's letter
hadn't been churlish in tone, it was
unfair to claim he was speaking for most
undergrads. I know that Stanford's repu
tation for grade-inflation and casualness
made my choice between here and the
University of Chicago difficult. I work
very hard and I want my grades to mean
something. I spent last summer at UC-
Berkeley (this is my first year here) and
despite the grudging acknowledgment
that "no, they didn't get in," many of my
UC friends cautioned me that the "word
on the street" is that grad schools don't
take Stanford transcripts seriously. This
upset me, and I'm not the only one.
Mahood's efforts (and her colleagues')
may mean I'll be in the first generation
of Stanford grads to have their tran
scripts taken at face value.

Third, I believe the old grading policy
caused a pathological perspective on
grades. A policy that allows everyone to
cover their tracks puts students who get
some Bs and Cs (shudder) and then
move on and learn from them at a gross
disadvantage. The point of grades is to
assist learning and if the courses here
are all so easy that most of us don't get
knocked around a little, it probably isn't
worth the money. A historical transcript
fosters the healthy outlook that grades
are to be learned from and that our time
here is for learning, not padding a
resume. The obsession to make sure
every grade on the transcript is an A,
regardless of whether that makes Chem
33 one of the "five hardest courses at
Stanford," creates a superficial grade
grubbing culture and validates the
ridiculous conventional wisdom that a
GPA is a perfect indicator of knowledge
and accomplishment. Mahood's (et al)
reforms can help restore perspective.
Fourth, Stanford's liberal student rep
resentation policies have helped make it
the unique and famed institution it is.
It's a head scratcher that the Fac Sen

voted to remove us from the Planning
and Policy Board. Maybe they noticed
that schools that have less student repre
sentation (i.e., Harvard and Princeton)
have higher percentages of alumni-giv
ing. Ironic, isn't it? Overindulgence
almost always breeds contempt and petu
lance instead of loyalty and spirit. In any
event, the sole indictment of Mahood is
wrong. She couldn't have done it alone.
In conclusion, not only does Mahood
deserve a more thoughtful response than
the trash Martellotto pushed, Martellot
to misrepresented the student body.
Many of us agree with the reforms and
are relieved that Stanford is assuming
grading policies commensurate with its
stature as a challenging "Top Five"
school. Kudos to Gail and the Faculty
Senate for their hard work. As for
Martellotto, with vitriolic sweeping
indictments like his letter, I think he'd
be the perfect successor to Nick Thomp
son's column space in The Daily. But
next time, Greg, please speak for your
self!
