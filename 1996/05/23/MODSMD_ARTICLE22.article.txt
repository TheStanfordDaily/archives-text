# Daily endorsement for president missed best ticket, student says
## 
### 
I read with some dismay that The
Daily endorsed Bill Shen for the post of
ASSU President. Without impugning
Shen or his running mate, I must say I
am disappointed the campus paper over
looked the most qualified candidate for
the job: Doug Natelson, a third-year
graduate student in physics. Running
with Sue Owen (a third-year geophysics
graduate student), Natelson represents
the students' best option for a vibrant,
meaningful student government.
It is perhaps surprising to hear Natel

son is running, since he will not appear
on the official ballot. Though Natelson
has tossed his hat into the ring later
than the official deadline, he nonetheless
remains the soundest choice for the
office. Throughout the past year — a
year marked by bickering and diatribes
even more acrimonious and petty than
usual — Natelson has consistently been
the voice of reason and moderation. Not
surprisingly, he has been among the
most productive senators, achieving
results on issues such as TA policies — a
feat noted by The Daily as one of the few
net goods accomplished by this year's
senate.
The current field is awash with politi
cians, but Natelson would be a states
man. He is in the senate but not of the
senate — at least, not temperamentally.

The model of civility and decorum,
Natelson has lost his temper over one
issue consistently: the failure of our
alleged student "leaders" to advocate on
behalf of their constituents. His opposi
tion to the very idea of undergraduate
parties is a matter of long record,
because (as he says) everyone in student
government should pursue one goal: the
representation of student interests to
the administration.
When Constitution '96 passed,
Natelson was one of the few who took
early, active steps to smooth its imple
mentation — a task lamentably ignored
by the constitution's most ardent sup
porters. As a measure of his stature
among the student leadership, Natelson
was asked to chair the Transitional
Committee which prepared implemen

tation. He turned down the chair,
because his sense of honor told him
that at that time he would be unable to
dedicate the energy and effort this
undertaking involved.
We face a historic chance: this new
Constitution, with its single presidency,
offers the opportunity to break the pat
tern of apathy and abuse which students
so rightfully regard as business-as-usual
at the ASSU. But it will not happen if
the first president under the new system
is a hack of the old. It's time for a firm,
nonpartisan hand to guide the new gov
ernment through its first year. I feel
strongly that Doug Natelson would be
the best hand at the helm, and I hope
you will agree.
