# Josh Gohlke: Laughing leads to crying
## Keeping the legend alive: predictions for Stanford 
### 
SOMEONE ONCE SAID that the
problem with being famous for 15
minutes is that it only lasts for 15
minutes. The problem with being famous
for several weeks is quite similar and,
furthermore, quite apparent to me with
the advent of this, my penultimate col
umn.
Hence, in an effort to transcend the
constraints of my all-too-brief relevancy,
I would like to make some predictions
about Stanford's future.
The following prophecies were
achieved while in a trance induced by
multi-gram doses of Mr. Stayalert (Safe
way, $5.29). So, although the visions
should prove to be very reliable, the lan
guage can appear cryptic and obtuse
when not filtered through a painful, caf
feinated haze. This fact necessitated the
help of several trained experts who have
interpreted my raw, free-associative
prognostications to make them under
standable in terms of their mundane his
torical meanings.
As a final note, I should add that,
though my writings so far have been
somewhat apocalyptic regarding Stan
ford's future, I can only repeat what I

once said to my younger brother: "It gets
much, much worse."
Prediction: The minstrels without
lutes, shouting the war cry "Doo wop,"
shall march triumphantly, and thou
sands will be converted to their ranks.
The cacophonous din of their voices shall
become so unbearable that many flee and
none listen. After several cycles of their
horrible reign, the incomprehensible
Hun shall quell them.
Interpretation: By the "minstrels" who
have no instruments, Gohlke is clearly
indicating the growing contingent of a
cappella groups at Stanford. He seems to
predict a rise of the already annoying
movement to intolerable proportions,
perhaps even to the point that every sin
gle Stanford student will be a member of
an a cappella group. Due to steadily
declining audiences as well as admis
sions, Gerhard Casper finally outlaws the
barber-shop style of singing.
Prediction: Vanquished temporarily by
his many victims, the Evil Messenger will
disappear suddenly and peace will prevail
for several moons. Hut he will return on a

tide of fire and iron that will consume all
of his cohorts and several youths before
destroying the Evil Messenger himself.
Interpretation: In this prophecy,
Gohlke seems to be earmarking the "big,
mean guy" at the Stanford Post Office for
the tragic and cliched fate of many other
disgruntled postal workers. After being
fired due to numerous complaints, he
returns with a shotgun to deal out the
expected mass homicide, followed by sui
cide.
Prediction: The Gauls of the Occident,
after their northern brothers, shall rebel
against their rulers. The people will flood
the gates of their castle and bring brutal
destruction upon them as retribution for
a history of offenses.
Interpretation: It seems that residents
of the Erench House will attempt to copy
Quebec by seceding from Stanford. Other
students will respond immediately by
beating them to death in anger and irri
tation at the mere idea of a "French
House."
Prediction: When the Sages depart for
ever, the Rampant Lion shall be betrayed

and trapped by 12 hunters who don black
and white and consort with fallen
women. The Italian from France may be
the Lion's last true ally.
Interpretation: The Dekes could lose
all credibility when the seniors graduate
and the new pledges decide to have a
"Deke Formal." The mysterious
Matthew "Matty C" Cesario must stop
them.
Prediction: A carriage full of ribald
troubadours traveling to the northeast
will drown in the sea unmourned.
Interpretation: The entire Stanford
Band is wiped out on the way to Big
Game when their bus falls off the Bay
Bridge, and no one really cares.
Prediction: The Druids who practice
agriculture in the backwoods will shed
their colorful, flowing garments for drab
uniforms. They will count gold and silver
for the rest of their lives.
Interpretation: Residents of EBF will
sell out and become consultants just like
everyone else.
Prediction: The men in red shall chop

down the Tall Tree and build a magnifi
cent fortress for wizards and alchemists
beneath a heavenly thoroughfare.
Interpretation: Stanford will purchase
Palo Alto and level it in order to build a
huge science complex and a new freeway
overpass.
Prediction: The wise magistrates will
become dissatisfied with the merry play
ers, declaring themselves the sole practi
tioners of the arts.
Interpretation: A group of veteran
Intermission writers will form their own
rock band and refuse to review any CDs
but their own.
Prediction: The world will spin seven
more times, and the angry, laughing
Israelite will vanish into obscurity.
Interpretation: One more week and
I'm outta here!
Josh Gohlke would like to send a shout
out and a big bow-wow to creative consul
tant Torn Baranowski.
