## Links prove to be tricky Women deep in pack but only eight back

The first round of the NCAA Women's Golf Cham
pionship was completed yesterday as the unranked
( ardinal squad finished 11th with a team score of 321,
which was just eight strokes off the lead. The tourna
ment, which is being held at UCLA, is a four-day affair,
leaving Stanford plenty of time to make at run at the
title.
However, that task could prove quite difficult. A
tough Texas squad put up a tournament-best 313 team
score and was followed closely by Arizona, UCLA, New
Mexico State and Wake Forest. The Wildcats finished
just one stroke off the lead at 314 and placed first in in
dividual standings with Maria Baena hitting four
strokes better than her nearest competitor at 70.
Wake Forest and New Mexico State also managed to
sneak into a three-way tie with UCLA for third with
impressive individual performances to boost their
team scores to 315 each. NMSU's A. J. Eathorne came
in second with a 74, while Wake's Laura Philo and
Sonia Bauer were part of a four-way tie for fourth with
scores of 75 each.
The top flnishqr for the Cardinal was junior Andrea
Baxter. Baxter came in with five other competitors at
77 to place her at ninth after round one at seven
strokes off the lead. Senior Vicky Strada put up the
next-highest individual performance for Stanford
with a score of 78 to place her 15th along with a slew of
other players.
Three other golfers filled out the list of individual
standings for the Cardinal. Junior Mhairi McKay
pulled in at the 31-spot with a score of 80, while senior
Julie Bowen shot an 86 and freshman Michelle Sperry
shot an 89 to finish at 84th and 91st, respectively.
Stanford will have three more rounds of competi
tion to improve upon their scores from day one, and the
winner of the NCAA Championship will be determined
once all the scores are compiled on Saturday. Eight
strokes is not an insurmountable lead by any means,
but for the Cardinal to make up lost ground it will need
key performances from McKay and Baxter.
This duo has led Stanford's team all season long, but
after round one they were a combined 17 strokes be
hind Baena. For now, however, Texas is the team to
beat. The Longhorns placed two golfers in the top 20, a
feat which only Wake Forest matched, and with strong
performances throughout the rest of their lineup ap
pear poised to make a run at the championship.
