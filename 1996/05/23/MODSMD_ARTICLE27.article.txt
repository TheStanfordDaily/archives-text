# Women bounce back, all advance in tennis
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
TALIiAHASSEE, Fla. — All six Stanford
competitors advanced yesterday in the open
ing round of singles and doubles at the
NCAA individual championships.
Four singles players and two doubles
teams emerged unscathed from first-round
competition, but success did not come easy
for the Cardinal.
The Stanford representatives found
themselves both physically and emotionally
exhausted after losing on the previous day to
Florida in the NCAA team title match.
"Even though the match yesterday was
not excruciatingly long, with all the emotion
involved, it takes a lot out of you," said Stan
ford head coach Frank Brennan. "Also,
when the rest of the team isn't there, that
takes the wind out of your sail a little bit."
The players agreed that it was difficult to
come back from Tuesday's loss.
"In the beginning, it was hard to come
back after Tuesday," sophomore Julie Scott
said. "I was physically and emotionally tired
so I started off slow."
After struggling early on to find the ener
gy and motivation, the Cardinal players
found a way to move themselves into the sec
ond round.
The upset of the day belonged to the dou
bles team of Scott and senior Kim Shasby,
who were seemingly overmatched in the
first round in a duel with Georgia's Michelle
Anderson and Anne Chauzu, the third-seed
ed team in the draw.
Scott and Shasby hung tough until they
pulled ahead to take the first set. After
Chauzu and Anderson forced a split, Scott
and Shasby pulled away in the third set to a
4-1 lead. Anderson and Chauzu began to
fight back with that first-game win, but the
Cardinal No. 2 doubles team held on for the
upset, 6-4, 3-6,6-2.
"We had no pressure on us and they did,"
Scott said. "Also, they didn't play in the
team competition, so they were coming out
cold."
Shasby also felt that the fact that they
had played all weekend was a factor.
"We were definitely ready to play," Shas
by said.
Scott pulled off an upset of her own in the
singles draw. As if she hadn't had enough of
the Gators in the final match, the Cardinal

No. 5 singles player found herself across the
net from Florida's No. 4 singles player, Lisa
Pugliese.
Pugliese had just beaten Shasby the day
before in three sets, but Scott was up to the
challenge. After falling behind to Pugliese 4-
1 in the first set, Scott reeled off five straight
games to bring the set back on serve.
The first set was extended to a tie-break
er where Scott took over and took a one-set
advantage. The Cardinal sophomore, who
received entry into the draw through her
Pac-10 singles crown, then ended the
Gator's hopes of an additional title by taking
the second set and the match, 7-6, 6-2.
"It's always nice to beat a Gator the day
after they beat you," Brennan said. "That
was my favorite match of the day."
Scott agreed that revenge had something
to do with it.
"After losing to them on Tuesday, I didn't
want to lose to them the day after also,"
Scott said.
In other singles action, sixth-seeded Ania
Bleszynski advanced as expected despite the
efforts of Syracuse's Nicole Strnadova. The
Stanford Ail-American took the first set
with relative ease, but Strnadova hung
tough in the second.
Bleszynski ended any upset dreams in
second-§et tie-breaker with a booming over
head to end the match with a 6-3, 7-6 tri
umph.
Junior Katie Schlukebir, seeded in the 9-
16 group, also fought off a morning-after
malaise in her opening round match with
William & Mary's Michelle O. After strug
gling to capture the first set, Schlukebir
found her groove in the second and moved
on, 6-4,6-2.
Junior Sandra De Silva advanced as well,
but faced possibly her toughest match of the
week. De Silva jumped out to an early lead in
the first set, but Alabama's Bali Camino
fought back. De Silva denied that comeback
and took the set. In a similar position in the
second set, Camino was able to bring the
match to a second -set tie-breaker.
The Cardinal junior fought off the bid to
split and outlasted Camino for a 6-4, 7-6 vic
tory.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles team, Bleszyns
ki and Schlukebir, battled Syracuse as well,
represented by Yanna and Strnadova. The

Sophomore Julie Scott follows through en route to one of two upset
triumphs in NCAA action yesterday.
No. 2-ranked and second-seeded
Cardinal tandem earned a straight
set win, 6-2, 6-3.
Bleszynski and Schlukebir will
face a squad from Mississippi, con
sisting of Marie-Laure Bougnol and
Courtney Chapman. The Rebels
moved to the second round by de
feating USC's Suzzane Italiano and

Nicole London in straight sets.
Scott and Shasby will meet an
underrated Washington squad in
the second round. Huskies Costain
and Sosnowy, who defeated
Bleszynski and Schlukebir in an
early dual match at Stanford, won
a three-set thriller over a Michigan
duo, 7-5, 6-7, 7-5.
Scott will have her hands full in
singles a well. After upsetting
Pugliese, Scott will be in search of
some more underdog magic in the
second round against the nation's

No. 1 singles player, sophomore
Vicky Maes from Arizona.
Yet Scott is looking forward to
the matchup.
"I'm fired up," Scott said. "I
think our games match up really
well and like today, there will be no
pressure on me."
De Silva will also be facing one
of the nation's top singles players,
Duke freshman Vanessa Webb,
who was recently named NCAA
Rookie of the Year. The Cardinal
just saw Webb in the NCAA semifi

nals, where she fell to Bleszynski.
Webb is ranked No. 3 nationally.
Both Schlukebir and Bleszyns
ki will see familiar faces in the sec
ond round. Bleszynski will battle
California's Pam Enkoji, whom
she played in the dual meeting at
Stanford in the last week of the
regular
season. Bleszynski took that
match in straight sets.
Schlukebir will collide with fel
low All-Pac-10 team member
Paige Yaroshuk of UCLA.

Yaroshuk and Schlukebir have
faced each other twice this season
in dual-match play, with each of
them taking one match.
The Cardinal now has the op
portunity to add to its extensive
list of All-Americans. Bleszynski
and Schlukebir automatically earn
that distinction again, based on
the seeds which they received for
the draw.
With wins in the second round,
Scott, De Silva and Shasby willfind
themselves in the same company

with their teammates. For Shasby,
it would be her second Ail-Ameri
can honor, for Scott and De Silva,
their first.
"I hope that happens," Bren
nan said. "For Kim, it would be
sort of a bookend since she won it
her freshman year, and Julie and
Sandra had such great years."
In addition, senior Amy
Chiminello has been named one of
three finalists for the national
Arthur Ashe Award which recog
nizes excellence in sportsmanship.

pulled ahead to take the first set. After
Chauzu and Anderson forced a split, Scott
and Shasby pulled away in the third set to a
4-1 lead. Anderson and Chauzu began to
fight back with that first-game win, but the
Cardinal No. 2 doubles team held on for the
upset, 6-4, 3-6,6-2.
"We had no pressure on us and they did,"
Scott said. "Also, they didn't play in the
team competition, so they were coming out
cold."
Shasby also felt that the fact that they
had played all weekend was a factor.
"We were definitely ready to play," Shas
by said.
Scott pulled off an upset of her own in the
singles draw. As if she hadn't had enough of
the Gators in the final match, the Cardinal

No. 5 singles player found herself across the
net from Florida's No. 4 singles player, Lisa
Pugliese.
Pugliese had just beaten Shasby the day
before in three sets, but Scott was up to the
challenge. After falling behind to Pugliese 4-
1 in the first set, Scott reeled off five straight
games to bring the set back on serve.
The first set was extended to a tie-break
er where Scott took over and took a one-set
advantage. The Cardinal sophomore, who
received entry into the draw through her
Pac-10 singles crown, then ended the
Gator's hopes of an additional title by taking
the second set and the match, 7-6, 6-2.
"It's always nice to beat a Gator the day
after they beat you," Brennan said. "That
was my favorite match of the day."
Scott agreed that revenge had something
to do with it.
"After losing to them on Tuesday, I didn't
want to lose to them the day after also,"
Scott said.
In other singles action, sixth-seeded Ania
Bleszynski advanced as expected despite the
efforts of Syracuse's Nicole Strnadova. The
Stanford Ail-American took the first set
with relative ease, but Strnadova hung
tough in the second.
Bleszynski ended any upset dreams in
second-§et tie-breaker with a booming over
head to end the match with a 6-3, 7-6 tri
umph.
Junior Katie Schlukebir, seeded in the 9-
16 group, also fought off a morning-after
malaise in her opening round match with
William & Mary's Michelle O. After strug
gling to capture the first set, Schlukebir
found her groove in the second and moved
on, 6-4,6-2.
Junior Sandra De Silva advanced as well,
but faced possibly her toughest match of the
week. De Silva jumped out to an early lead in
the first set, but Alabama's Bali Camino
fought back. De Silva denied that comeback
and took the set. In a similar position in the
second set, Camino was able to bring the
match to a second -set tie-breaker.
The Cardinal junior fought off the bid to
split and outlasted Camino for a 6-4, 7-6 vic
tory.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles team, Bleszyns
ki and Schlukebir, battled Syracuse as well,
represented by Yanna and Strnadova. The


L A. Rothstein — Special to The Daily
Sophomore Julie Scott follows through en route to one of two upset
triumphs in NCAA action yesterday.
No. 2-ranked and second-seeded
Cardinal tandem earned a straight
set win, 6-2, 6-3.
Bleszynski and Schlukebir will
face a squad from Mississippi, con
sisting of Marie-Laure Bougnol and
Courtney Chapman. The Rebels
moved to the second round by de
feating USC's Suzzane Italiano and

Nicole London in straight sets.
Scott and Shasby will meet an
underrated Washington squad in
the second round. Huskies Costain
and Sosnowy, who defeated
Bleszynski and Schlukebir in an
early dual match at Stanford, won
a three-set thriller over a Michigan
duo, 7-5, 6-7, 7-5.
Scott will have her hands full in
singles a well. After upsetting
Pugliese, Scott will be in search of
some more underdog magic in the
second round against the nation's

No. 1 singles player, sophomore
Vicky Maes from Arizona.
Yet Scott is looking forward to
the matchup.
"I'm fired up," Scott said. "I
think our games match up really
well and like today, there will be no
pressure on me."
De Silva will also be facing one
of the nation's top singles players,
Duke freshman Vanessa Webb,
who was recently named NCAA
Rookie of the Year. The Cardinal
just saw Webb in the NCAA semifi

nals, where she fell to Bleszynski.
Webb is ranked No. 3 nationally.
Both Schlukebir and Bleszyns
ki will see familiar faces in the sec
ond round. Bleszynski will battle
California's Pam Enkoji, whom
she played in the dual meeting at
Stanford in the last week of the
regular
season. Bleszynski took that
match in straight sets.
Schlukebir will collide with fel
low All-Pac-10 team member
Paige Yaroshuk of UCLA.

Yaroshuk and Schlukebir have
faced each other twice this season
in dual-match play, with each of
them taking one match.
The Cardinal now has the op
portunity to add to its extensive
list of All-Americans. Bleszynski
and Schlukebir automatically earn
that distinction again, based on
the seeds which they received for
the draw.
With wins in the second round,
Scott, De Silva and Shasby willfind
themselves in the same company

with their teammates. For Shasby,
it would be her second Ail-Ameri
can honor, for Scott and De Silva,
their first.
"I hope that happens," Bren
nan said. "For Kim, it would be
sort of a bookend since she won it
her freshman year, and Julie and
Sandra had such great years."
In addition, senior Amy
Chiminello has been named one of
three finalists for the national
Arthur Ashe Award which recog
nizes excellence in sportsmanship.
