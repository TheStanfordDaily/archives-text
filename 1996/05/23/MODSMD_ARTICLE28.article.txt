## Northridge on deck as regional begins 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
The road to the 50th College
World Series gets underway
today, and for the six teams in
the West Regional, Sunken Dia
mond will be the launching pad.
Second-seeded Stanford (39-
17) will face Cal State-North
ridge (49-13) in the most intrigu
ing matchup of opening day at 7
p.m. tonight. The earlier affairs
pit top-seed Florida State (47-15)
against Northeastern Illinois
(31-27) at 11 a.m. and Mississip
pi State (37-22) against UC-
Santa Barbara (32-18), the No. 4
seed, at 3 p.m.
The West features three of the
top-10 squads in the land, and
the nightcap is the only opening
day contest between top-20
teams. The lOth-ranked Mata
dors have socked 119 home runs
and feature two 13-game win
ners, head-to-head victories
against several better-seeded
teams with worse marks and the
second- most victories in Division
I.
"We've gotten no respect the
whole season," said Matador
catcher Robert Fick. "It was sur
prising, but you've got to beat the
best teams in your bracket any
way."
Fick and the Matadors have
battled back from consecutive
losing campaigns under first
year head coach Mike Batesole.
Although picked to finish fourth
in the six-squad Western Athlet
ic Conference's West Division,
CSUN took all but one of its first
20 contests and edged Fresno
State (35-22) for the title. The
Matadors then went crazy
against WAC South champion
BYU, sandwiching 29-15 and 23-
15 wins around a 10-9 loss to
earn a berth in a play-in series for
an automatic regional bid.
"I saw they've put up some
football numbers once in
awhile," said Stanford sopho
more hurler Kyle Peterson, who
will get the nod tonight. The two
time All-Six-Pac selection will
face a club with a .318 average
and five players with double-digit
home run totals.
"I'll take our pitching staff
against any team in the country,"
said senior catcher A.J. Hinch.
"[The Matadors have] put up
some numbers unmatched by
anyone, and our staff hasn't

given up the offense that North
ridge usually produces. I think
it's going to be a great matchup
with Kyle facing them tomorrow
night."
Peterson's off-speed pitches
may spell the difference against
the fastball-happy Matadors.
With the mind-boggling 270
extra-base hits have come 530
strikeouts. Peterson may employ
the change-up often to keep
CSUN bats off their guard.
Despite scoring in double dig
its 21 times in the regular season,
Northridge was contained in a
three-game set against Santa
Clara for an automatic regional
bid last weekend. The Matadors
scored 15 runs total but surren
dered just three, lowering the
club's ERA to under 4.00. Sopho
more southpaw Erasmo Ramirez
(13-1, 3.13 ERA) blossomed from
a raw prospect with an 8.27 ERA
into an ace with six complete
games. Although Stanford was
just 10-9 against lefties this year,

Batesole was expected to throw
senior co-ace Robby Crabtree
(13-7,3.90), a right-hander. Four
other pitchers have made at least
five starts.
"It's interesting, because
when we saw them versus Santa
Clara, their pitching really came
around," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess, who has a
54-28 record in 13 previous re
gional appearances, including
four at Sunken Diamond.
"They're well-rounded, but the
thing that scares you the most is
their power."
Fick led the way with a .420
average, 88 RBIs and 24 long
balls, including five in the WAC
Championship series. The junior
catcher and sophomore short
stop Adam Kennedy (.379, 14
HRs, 69 RBIs) finished one-two
in the nation in hits with 110 and
108, respectively. Fick and Hinch
are the two finalists for the
Smith Super Team award at
catcher, and Firk will try to earn

the backup role to Hinch on the
Olympic team.
"IHinch] deserves to be [the
starter]," Fick said. "But I think
I'm the best collegiate catcher in
the nation. If I thought I wasn't,
I'd get walked all over."
Some fear Northeastern Illi
nois will be walked over by Flori
da State in the morning game.
The Golden Eagles are celebrat
ing their first Division I postsea
son event as an institution, while
the Seminoles were disappointed
that they had to travel to a re
gional for the first time since
1990. While Florida State has
traveled to the College World Se
ries seven times in the last 10
years, it has never won a regional
on the road.
"They've been ranked in the
top 10 all year," Marquess said.
"They're deserving of a No. 1
seed."

3.44) have also shone. Morgan
(.312, 12, 37) doubles as desig

On the flip side, NEIU enjoyed
its second winning season in 20
years. Two upset wins over Mid-
Continent Conference regular
season champ Troy State vaulted
the Golden Eagles into a play-in
series against Northern Illinois.
NEIU swept and has now taken
11 of its last 12 games, despite a
staff ERA of 5.37. Jim

Hawrysko's squad is paced by
first baseman / outfielder Rob
Bruce(.3ss, 9, 51) and starter
Jamie Puorto (9-5, 3.00).
Like FSU and NEIU, the
teams in the middle game have
never met. Mississippi State, a
consistent power from the
Southeastern Conference, lost
six of nine to close the season but
is back in a regional for the first
time in three years. Skipper Ron
Polk has an outside shot at his
I,oooth career win if the Bull
dogs win the double-elimination
tournament despite a loss.
"We're excited to have two big
baseball schools like Florida
State and Mississippi State in
our yard," Hinch said.
The Bulldogs' talented sopho
more squad is highlighted by in
fielder Rob Hauswald (.349, 15,
56) and ace lefty Eric Dußose (9-

4, 3.18, 10 complete games). Du-
Bose's 163 strikeouts rank third
in the NCAAs.
UC-Santa Barbara has faced
Stanford more often than any
other squad in the regional. Al
though the Gauchos and Cardi
nal have not met this year, UCSB
has gone 10-14 against Mark
Marquess all-time. One of four
Big West representatives, the
Gauchos returned to the postsea
son for the first time in six years
thanks in large part to junior
catcher David Willis (.362, 16,
66) and despite a sketchy pitch
ing staff. Junior Bryan Noyes (5-
3, 4.88) and sophomore Seth
Bean (9-3, 5.54) try to turn it
over to junior closer John Minton
(3-1, 3.97, 8 saves).

NEIU swept and has now taken
11 of its last 12 games, despite a
staff ERA of 5.37. Jim

Hawrysko's squad is paced by
first baseman / outfielder Rob
Bruce(.3ss, 9, 51) and starter
Jamie Puorto (9-5, 3.00).
Like FSU and NEIU, the
teams in the middle game have
never met. Mississippi State, a
consistent power from the
Southeastern Conference, lost
six of nine to close the season but
is back in a regional for the first
time in three years. Skipper Ron
Polk has an outside shot at his
I,oooth career win if the Bull
dogs win the double-elimination
tournament despite a loss.
"We're excited to have two big
baseball schools like Florida
State and Mississippi State in
our yard," Hinch said.
The Bulldogs' talented sopho
more squad is highlighted by in
fielder Rob Hauswald (.349, 15,
56) and ace lefty Eric Dußose (9-

4, 3.18, 10 complete games). Du-
Bose's 163 strikeouts rank third
in the NCAAs.
UC-Santa Barbara has faced
Stanford more often than any
other squad in the regional. Al
though the Gauchos and Cardi
nal have not met this year, UCSB
has gone 10-14 against Mark
Marquess all-time. One of four
Big West representatives, the
Gauchos returned to the postsea
son for the first time in six years
thanks in large part to junior
catcher David Willis (.362, 16,
66) and despite a sketchy pitch
ing staff. Junior Bryan Noyes (5-
3, 4.88) and sophomore Seth
Bean (9-3, 5.54) try to turn it
over to junior closer John Minton
(3-1, 3.97, 8 saves).

The road to the 50th College
World Series gets underway
today, and for the six teams in
the West Regional, Sunken Dia
mond will be the launching pad.
Second-seeded Stanford (39-
17) will face Cal State-North
ridge (49-13) in the most intrigu
ing matchup of opening day at 7
p.m. tonight. The earlier affairs
pit top-seed Florida State (47-15)
against Northeastern Illinois
(31-27) at 11 a.m. and Mississip
pi State (37-22) against UC-
Santa Barbara (32-18), the No. 4
seed, at 3 p.m.
The West features three of the
top-10 squads in the land, and
the nightcap is the only opening
day contest between top-20
teams. The lOth-ranked Mata
dors have socked 119 home runs
and feature two 13-game win
ners, head-to-head victories
against several better-seeded
teams with worse marks and the
second- most victories in Division
I.
"We've gotten no respect the
whole season," said Matador
catcher Robert Fick. "It was sur
prising, but you've got to beat the
best teams in your bracket any
way."
Fick and the Matadors have
battled back from consecutive
losing campaigns under first
year head coach Mike Batesole.
Although picked to finish fourth
in the six-squad Western Athlet
ic Conference's West Division,
CSUN took all but one of its first
20 contests and edged Fresno
State (35-22) for the title. The
Matadors then went crazy
against WAC South champion
BYU, sandwiching 29-15 and 23-
15 wins around a 10-9 loss to
earn a berth in a play-in series for
an automatic regional bid.
"I saw they've put up some
football numbers once in
awhile," said Stanford sopho
more hurler Kyle Peterson, who
will get the nod tonight. The two
time All-Six-Pac selection will
face a club with a .318 average
and five players with double-digit
home run totals.
"I'll take our pitching staff
against any team in the country,"
said senior catcher A.J. Hinch.
"[The Matadors have] put up
some numbers unmatched by
anyone, and our staff hasn't

given up the offense that North
ridge usually produces. I think
it's going to be a great matchup
with Kyle facing them tomorrow
night."
Peterson's off-speed pitches
may spell the difference against
the fastball-happy Matadors.
With the mind-boggling 270
extra-base hits have come 530
strikeouts. Peterson may employ
the change-up often to keep
CSUN bats off their guard.
Despite scoring in double dig
its 21 times in the regular season,
Northridge was contained in a
three-game set against Santa
Clara for an automatic regional
bid last weekend. The Matadors
scored 15 runs total but surren
dered just three, lowering the
club's ERA to under 4.00. Sopho
more southpaw Erasmo Ramirez
(13-1, 3.13 ERA) blossomed from
a raw prospect with an 8.27 ERA
into an ace with six complete
games. Although Stanford was
just 10-9 against lefties this year,

Batesole was expected to throw
senior co-ace Robby Crabtree
(13-7,3.90), a right-hander. Four
other pitchers have made at least
five starts.
"It's interesting, because
when we saw them versus Santa
Clara, their pitching really came
around," said Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess, who has a
54-28 record in 13 previous re
gional appearances, including
four at Sunken Diamond.
"They're well-rounded, but the
thing that scares you the most is
their power."
Fick led the way with a .420
average, 88 RBIs and 24 long
balls, including five in the WAC
Championship series. The junior
catcher and sophomore short
stop Adam Kennedy (.379, 14
HRs, 69 RBIs) finished one-two
in the nation in hits with 110 and
108, respectively. Fick and Hinch
are the two finalists for the
Smith Super Team award at
catcher, and Firk will try to earn

the backup role to Hinch on the
Olympic team.
"IHinch] deserves to be [the
starter]," Fick said. "But I think
I'm the best collegiate catcher in
the nation. If I thought I wasn't,
I'd get walked all over."
Some fear Northeastern Illi
nois will be walked over by Flori
da State in the morning game.
The Golden Eagles are celebrat
ing their first Division I postsea
son event as an institution, while
the Seminoles were disappointed
that they had to travel to a re
gional for the first time since
1990. While Florida State has
traveled to the College World Se
ries seven times in the last 10
years, it has never won a regional
on the road.
"They've been ranked in the
top 10 all year," Marquess said.
"They're deserving of a No. 1
seed."

Randy Choate (14-3, 2.63) is the

On the flip side, NEIU enjoyed
its second winning season in 20
years. Two upset wins over Mid-
Continent Conference regular
season champ Troy State vaulted
the Golden Eagles into a play-in
series against Northern Illinois.
NEIU swept and has now taken
11 of its last 12 games, despite a
staff ERA of 5.37. Jim
