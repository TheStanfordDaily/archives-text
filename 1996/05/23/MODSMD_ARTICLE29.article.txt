# Salzenstein upset
## Others move on but Cardinal favorite stunned in round one 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Less than 24 hours after
winning the National Champi
onships, four Stanford players
were back on the courts to test
their games in the individual
tournament. The top 64 tennis
players in college received invi
tations to compete in the 112 th
year of this event. Stanford sent
its top four, Jeff Salzenstein
(No. 4), Ryan Wolters (No. 11),
Paul Goldstein (No. 28) and Jim

Thomas (No. 51).
Salzenstein, a senior and the
team's captain, received a the
fifth seed in the tournament,
and looked to have a fairly easy
first round match against
Auburn's Lee Pearson (No. 39).
However, the Tigers' Aus
tralian sophomore was not in
timidated by Salzenstein's ag
gressive serve and volley game
and, after losing the first set,
fought back to win the next two,
2-6, 7-5, 6-2. It was a monumen
tal upset, as the Cardinal star
was expected to make a strong
run for the title.
Stanford's other three en
trants survived the first round
with convincing straight-set vic
tories. Thomas, who squeaked
into the tourney as the first al
ternate, ousted Mississippi
State's Thomas Dupre handily,
6-2, 6-2. Thomas' victory was
quite an upset as well. Dupre, a
sophomore from France, is
ranked No. 9 in the nation.
Thomas will face the winner of
the match between UCLA's Eric
Taino (No. 27) and Georgia's
John Roddick (No. 16) in the next
round.
Wolters wasted no time in his
match, blowing Texas A&M's
Blake Arrant (No. 63) off the
court, 6-0, 6-2. The freshman
from San Jose has been playing
excellent tennis of late, and is
showing flashes of the brilliance
that helped him to a 22-1 start of
the season including victories in
two national tourneys. He will
square off against Fresno State's
Fredrik Bergh (No. 18) in the sec
ond round.
Goldstein, like Thomas,
knocked off a Frenchman from
Mississippi State. Matt Ballay was
no match for the Cardinal sopho
more's consistency, losing 6-1, 6-
2. Goldstein will probably meet
UCLA's Srdjan Muskatirovic (No.
17) in the next round.
It will be a rematch of the sec
ond singles match from Tues
day's final. In that match, Gold
stein and his Bruin counterpart
traded sets before their match
was suspended early into the
third set.
