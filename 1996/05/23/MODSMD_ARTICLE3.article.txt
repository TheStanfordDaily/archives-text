### Marni Leff Contributing writer 
It's equipped with special technology that al
lows listeners to view more than 200 shots of the
Stanford Band in action using a CD-ROM, while
simultaneously delighting in the Band's music.
It's got 26 digitally recorded tracks, includ
ing everything from traditional Band favorites
such as "All Right Now" to hits from Green Day
and Offspring.
It's got a picture of University President
Gerhard Casper with a gun.
It's "Mirth Control," the Stanford Band's
newest CD, released to the public yesterday in
White Plaza.
In the works since last spring, the album was
recorded the weekend before Big Game in No
vember, according to Patrick Neschleba, a se
nior and drum major emeritus. Approximately
115 undergraduate and graduate students as
well as Band alumni contributed to the project.
Neschleba said the Band generally tries to
produce an album every four years. The last

album, "The Band is Not Helping," was re
leased in 1991.
"Out of all honesty," said Band Manager
Josh Schiller, "I think this is one of the best —
if not the best — Band albums ever. It's really
high quality with really good humor and good
content."
Using modern technology, Neschleba ex
plained, Band members scanned pictures to ac
company the CD to give listeners a sense of
what the Band is all about.
"I believe that we are the first college band to
do this," Neschleba said. "I haven't heard of any
other bands with multimedia presentations.
Back in the '40s, we were also the first band to
fly to an away game, so it's kind of neat from
that standpoint to be innovative again."
The pictures, Asst. Band Manager Scott
McKissen added, also help people get a better
sense of the Band.
"It's a nice little extra thing, and we're not
charging any more for it," McKissen said. "It
shows us doing our thing, which is so much
more than just the music we play."

"Mirth Control" is different from the Band's
previous albums, members say, because it fea
tures more tracks and for the first time includes
the music the Band plays when the basketball
teams take the court and the football team
takes the field. In addition, the album's back
cover features a picture of Casper holding a gun,
Neschleba said.
"Originally we were going to have him load
ing a gun," Neschleba said. "We didn't want
him to die on the photo shoot so we compro
mised. It's a really great, funny shot."
For the band's previous album, Neschleba
said, members asked former University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, but he declined the offer.
"I guess Gerhard one-upped him on this
one," Neschleba said.
The album was initially scheduled for release
in time for last Christmas, McKissen said, but
the amount of work involved in producing the
album pushed back the release.
The album took between 600 and 800 man
hours to produce, Neschleba estimated.
"We're really proud of it,"
McKissen said. "It took a lot of
sleepless nights and shitty grades
but everyone who has listened to
the album thinks that it sounds re
ally good. It was an interesting

project done by students with real
ly busy schedules, and we did it
with little outside help."
Reflecting the opinion of many
Band members, senior Mary
Ringhoff, who wrote the liner
notes for the album, said she's
"pleased as punch with the new
album."
"Mirth Control" will most likely
be on sale in White Plaza next

week, Schiller said. It is also avail
able for purchase from the Band
for $10; the cassette costs $8. The
CD and cassette can also be pur
chased at the Bookstore for $12
and $9, respectively.
"It's a good album and it's out in
time for graduation," Schiller said.
"It makes a good gift, a cheap gift
for relatives coming into town "
He added, "Join the Band."
