# It just will never get any better than this
## Your guide to the Golden Age 
### 
£112 1 hank you all for coming
along today for our tour
JL through the Golden
Age of Sports, that magical span
from 1990 to 2010 that changed
the face of sports.
"Please take your seat in your
replica Nike Air Jordan shoe
cars, fasten your seat belts and
keep your hands inside the vehi
cle at all times.

"As we start our tour, on your
left you'll see the 72-foot statue
of His Airness commemorating
the 1996 Chicago Bulls' 72nd
win season, the 72 points he
scored in game seven to beat
Seattle for his fourth NBA title
and the subsequent $72 million
a-year salary he received.
"Continuing on through our
basketball wing we get to the di
aper dandies of the new millen
nium, identical 6-foot-10 quin
tuplets Darrell, David, Devin,
Dametri and Deon Wilson. Going
straight from the eighth grade to

the NBA, all five were selected by
Los Angeles Lakers player
owner Earvin "Magic" Johnson
in a daring draft-day trade of the
rights to Shaquille O'Neal, Jr.
and ownership of ShaqWorld en
terprises.
"Is that a question in the
back? What happened to his dad,
you ask? After splitting from the
NBA in 1999 to start his own
league without free throws, the
basketball player formerly
known as Shaquille O'Neal
bought Australia in 2007 and
calls himself King Shaq the First
now.
"The Rodman room? No, we
took that out after too many kids
injured themselves in the Tat
too-yourself-j ust-like-Dennis'
fun center.
"If you'll follow me to the
baseball section, we have a com
plete display for the new Sultan
of Swat Albert Belle. On the left
is the bat he used to club home
run No. 62 at the end of the 1998
season, to the right you'll see the
bat he used to club the 62 re
porters gathered around his
locker after that game.
"What's that? Yeah, he never
was the same after that year
when commissioner-owner-um
pire Bud Selig ordered that
anger-removal treatment. But


Greg
Collins
he does make a pretty mean
bundt cake these days.
"Just behind the ball used to
retire the final out of Greg Mad
dux's 512 th career victory you
can see his old right arm that he
gave up after the transplant of
2004. Sure, the last 197 wins
came with the new whip, but
when aluminum bats made their
debut the year before you had to
give the pitchers a little some
thing back.
"That's not the only thing
those aluminum monstrosities
have done to the game. Recycle
them all, I say, just like the life
size Grant Hill Sprite cans that
came out after he won his second
MVP in 2001.
"Why? Ask Mark Kotsay, who
was five years into a Hall of

Fame career before he lined a
rocket off Cal Ripken, Jr.'s head,
ending The Streak. The poor guy
had to enter the Witness Protec
tion Program, for crying out
loud. He was out of baseball for
awhile, but I hear he worked his
way back to the Show under the
name Roy Hobbs, Jr.
"But I digress. So where are
all you from? Stanford, huh?
Well, you know your share of
sports legends. We all remember
'little' John Montgomery, who
won the national championship
in 2005 for the Cardinal, the
year his father Mike retired after
20 years on the Farm.
"Or the other coach's son who
made Stanford history, head
football coach Tyrone Willing
ham's son Nathaniel who fol
lowed in his father's footsteps
and walked on to both the foot
ball and baseball teams. Can you
believe he led them to national
titles in 2009 and 2010? Tough

as nails, just like his old man.
"Yeah, I guess Stanford made
out okay even after the Exodus
of 1998 when every underclass
man declared himself eligible.
Was I surprised that Tiger
Woods stayed all four years? Not
at all. It's not like he's going to
blow out his knee on a tricky par
5, right?
"Do we have a set of his trade
mark 'Tiger' woods and irons?
Not yet — our archivist is still
trying to get Nike to release the
prototypes. We do have the limit
ed edition 'Eldrick' Sticks which
came out in 1999 but were later
determined just to be cheap
knockoffs of the original 'Tiger'
series.
"Just a minute, folks, my
phone's ringing. Hello?
"What? A 1 Davis 111 just
cheated his grandfather out of
the Oak-Angeles Raiders?
"Sorry, folks. End of the
tour."
