# Bridging the gap
## Speaker calls for tolerance 
### Tienlon Ho 
Salam Al-Marayati delivered a
message of tolerance to an audi
ence of about 40 last night in Kres
ge Auditorium.
Al-Marayati, director of the
Muslim Public Affairs Council in
Los Angeles, discussed current po
litical issues affecting the Muslim
community. The speech was spon
sored by the Muslim Students
Awareness Network.
A minority issues associate
with CNN and The Wall Street
Journal, Al-Marayati compared
"the human experience of the

Muslim people today and Ameri
ca's founding fathers."
Both groups, he said, "fled per
secution to reach American shores
and American ideals of hope and
freedom" and both faced the op
pression of "international bosses"
and the "terrorist" stereotype.
In both cases, such labels are in
accurate and unfair, Al-Marayati
said, and are mainly "the result of
the rising extremism from a hand
ful of militants."
An end to animosity toward
Islam, Al-Marayati proposed last
night, requires overcoming politi
cal and social biases by promoting

open dialogue and confronting
stereotypes.
"The status of being a minority
is putting people in more and more
of a jeopardizing situation," Al-
Marayati said.
He cited recent occurrences
such as the overwhelming popular
support for state proposals such as
Proposition 187 and the California
Civil Rights Initiative, and the ini
tial association of the April 1995
Oklahoma City bombing with Is
lamic extremists as evidence of
America's growing animosity to
ward the "politically challenged."
"We live under a democratic
structure, and yet Muslims don't
have real political representation
proportional to our economic base.
We probably don't even have a dog
catcher," Al-Marayati said.
He attributed the weak part
nership between Islam and democ
racy to common portrayals of the
two as diametrically opposed and
incompatible. Al-Marayati argued
that both actually share similar
ideas. In fact, Islam was the first
religion to adopt a system of elec
tion, pre-dating the eighth centu
iy, which was not based on mili
taiy power or bloodline.
Unfortunately, he said, the
partnership between Islam and
this ancient system of democratic
government has deteriorated.
"Now the Muslim people are
ruled by monarchs, dictators, mili
tary thugs and arms dealers," he
said. "Dictatorships, monarchies
and theocracies are not Islamic.
Democracy is Islamic."
Al-Marayati concluded his
speech by addressing some ques
tions posed by his audience. He
emphasized the importance of ed
ucation in every situation involv
ing minority issues.
Because citizens pay taxes, they
are already involved with the gov
ernment, he said, and have the
power to control how that money
is applied. Through education,
Americans may reaffirm control
over their rightful positions in the
democratic structure.
"Become educated with the is
sues and choose to support those
groups which facilitate freedom
and justice," he said.
"We face a struggle for human
decency," he said. In that struggle,
"America is not ready for another
victim."
