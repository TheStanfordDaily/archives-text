# When being Blue isn't bad
## Outstanding staffers to receive their 'Amys' today 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
In recognition of excellence in staff service to the
University, Valerie Fratus, animal subjects coordi
nator in the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of
Research, will receive the 1996 Amy J. Blue Award in
a ceremony today at Serra Complex.
In addition, four other staff members will be rec
ognized at the reception as recipients of "Amys" be
cause of their responsibility, commitment and ener
gy in the workplace: Arthel Coleman, project crew
leader with Housing and Dining Services; Michael
Cowan, associate dean for graduate student affairs in
the School of Medicine; Andrew Harker, budget plan
ner in the Office of the Provost; and Karen Zack,
technical consultant for Information Technology
Systems and Services.
The awards are named after Amy J. Blue, an asso
ciate vice president for administrative services who
died of a brain tumor in 1988. The first award was
given in 1991.
Academic Secretary Susan Schofield, one of the
founders of the award and currently chair of the
awards committee, described Blue as "an extraordi
nary, highly visible well-loved figure." After her
death, Schofield and several other faculty members
"decided in her honor to establish an award for excel
lent, energetic staff members" to recognize contribu
tions by University staff.
Award winners are nominated by staff and facul
ty members and are selected by the committee. The
recipient of the main award receives $1,000 and a
plaque. The other four winners do not receive a fi
nancial award but also receive a plaque and recogni
tion for their achievements, according to Schofield.
Fratus helps facilitate humane research using lab
oratory animals, "helping analysts and researchers
understand the guidelines and getting the project

ready for other committees to help facilitate their re
search," Fratus said. "I care very much about the
people and what they're doing and that they do the
projects correctly."
Fratus was selected from more than 70 other
nominees because "she epitomized this energetic,
dedicated commitment to the faculty who do re
search, to take a really complicated administrative
process and make it as effective and humane as pos
sible," Schofield said.
Other winners were pleased with the recognition
they will receive for their work.
Harker, who has worked in the Provost's Office
since 1993 and is currently helping prepare a new
budgeting application, said he was surprised when he
was informed that he was a winner.
"I love this institution and I love working with
everyone, with people in the departments in helping
them to make their job easier, which we're hoping
this system will do," Harker said. "I was surprised
(when I heard). I consider what I do to be part of my
job."
Zack, who has worked for Information Technolo
gy Systems and Services for five years, also felt hon
ored by the award.
"It's one thing when people say thank you, but
this is incredible," Zack said. "It's like icing on the
cake of a job that I really enjoy and it makes the job
really special to me to know that people appreciate
what I do."
Schofield said she feels the award has a positive ef
fect for both the recipients and the committee mem
bers.
"From a human interest point of view," Schofield
said, "it's a really fabulous opportunity for those of
us lucky enough to be on the committee to get to read
about and sometimes talk about some wonderful
staff members who are making some amazing contri
butions at many different levels."
