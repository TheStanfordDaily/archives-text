You think you'll always keep in touch
with those best friends from college,
but most friends naturally drift
apart. Not so with Frank Thomas and
Ollie Johnston, Stanford alumni and life
long friends, collaborators and subjects of
the new documentary film "Frank and
Ollie."
Frank and Ollie's friendship spans over (->()
years through their years as students, as ani
mators for Walt Disney and as authors of
four books on Disney animation.
"We came from similar backgrounds,"
says Frank, referring to the fact that his father
was president of Fresno State College and
Ollie's father was head of the Department of
Romance Languages here at Stanford in the
19305. "We could have been brothers."
Ollie has similar memories of the art class
in which they met. "There were only six peo
ple. You couldn't avoid meeting each other."
They immediately hit it off, traveling off
campus together to complete assignments
and to attend an art school in San Mateo. The
University president's wife "walked into our
art class with a nude model [in 1933]," ex
plains Ollie, "and she said, They'll be no
more models here, nude or otherwise,' so we
had to go to San Mateo a couple of nights a
week to get the credit."
And the evening didn't stop there. "On the
way home," Ollie reveals, "We'd stop at a
speakeasy and have a little drink. Frank
would play jazz piano and they'd let us drink
for free."
Their other activities included writing a
skit for Gaieties, work for The Stanford Daily
and a stint on the track team. Both were
members of fraternities: Frank was Theta

Delta Chi and Ollie was Delta Tau Delta.
After Frank's graduation, he attended art
school near LA. and was hired by Disney. He
pulled Ollie with him. "I expected to return
to school," says Ollie, who was just shv of
graduation, "but 1 got hooked on it. I
couldn't pull myselfaway."
The two lived in a dilapidated old board
ing house run by a former undertaker. At the
first opportunity they bought a parcel of land
together and split it between them.
The early years at Disney were "a magical,
wonderful experience,' reveals Ollie.
Their days were spent learning about ani
mation. "Our coffee breaks were spent in a
live action analysis course where we'd look at
a strip of live action, a horse keeping his bal
ance, the draping of a woman's skirt, hair
blowing in the wind, until we understood the
action," says Frank.
Walt Disney even hired their art teacher
for after-hours lessons at the office.
"Walt was a marvelous creative genius,"
says Frank. "He used to say 'get the entertain
ment!' He never criticized you for doing a
poor job. He'd criticize everybody because
we didn't communicate."
It was Walt's philosophy, both claim, that
allowed the films he made to endure for pos
terity. "Walt insisted that we get good charac
ters," says Ollie. "We always had sequences
where characters got to know each other, ar
guing or happy." Ollie contrasts this narrative
technique with today's movies in which "we
see types of people where we know what they
do. We had all the dwarfs standing around
Snow White's bed talking. That way the audi
ence finds out what they're like."
Frank and Ollie collaborated on such

monumental characters as Pinocchio,
Thumper, (Cinderella, Captain Hook and Mr.
Smead. Whether they worked together or
apart on various films, they rode to work to
gether every day.
Ollie's fascination with trains led them to
the foundry every morning to drop off and
pick up engine parts, "and they never
weighed less than 75 pounds!" laughs
Frank. They bought 40 acres outside of San
Diego together so that Ollie could build a
rail for his restored train cars. "And now 1
live on the wrong side of the tracks," Frank
claims.
The documentary about two of the "Nine
Old Men," as Walt liked to refer to his favorite
animators, was directed and produced by
Frank's son and daughter-in-law. It is chock
full of anecdotes about their time at Disney,
including Walt's famous answer to the ques
tion, "How many people work at Disney?"
"Oh, about half of them."
Other memories of Walt include his al
most photographic memory. "He had a mind
like a steel trap. I remember when they were
building Disneyland, he could take you
around and tell you what every nut and bolt
was doing," remembers Ollie.
"He remembered everything anybody
ever said. You had to watch what you said,"
says Frank.
It was Walt's perfectionism, his bottom
less store of ideas and his insistence on delv
ing deep into character that made his movies
successful. He demanded the same excellence
from his employees. "Perfection is what he
was paying you for,"says Frank. "You had to
be better than that."
According to Ollie, "Frank and Ollie" di

rector Ted Thomas had two points he wanted
to express: "A 64-year friendship and a histo
ry ofanimation with Walt Disney." It gave the
subjects a chance to reminisce about their
days as Disney animators.
"I still get a lump in my throat when 1
watch Cinderella," says Frank. "The pictures
are so well made, the story is strong and
clear."
While both admire the new computer an
imation, they fear it lacks the polishing and
the artistry of the older films. "They were
different days back then in the '305," says
Frank. "It was the Depression. It was a time
of innocence, you could trust just about any
body."
Ollie adds, "these new people are trained
in animation. We didn't know what we were
doing."
When Frank and Ollie retired in 1978,
their collaboration did not stop. They have
authored four books, and still share a back
yard. While Ollie's arthritis has put a damper
on his drawing, his wife still jumps up to do
the Charleston every time Frank hits the
ivory keys.
Though they haven't always agreed on
everything, both Frank and Ollie are anxious
to see the movie "Frank and Ollie" achieve
success. "We agreed to disagree a long time
ago," says Frank. "That way we can wrestle
around and horse around and someone can
think of a better way [to do things]. There've
been arguments, but there's never been any
thing that caused such a big problem (that we
couldn't] arrive at a solution."
"Life's just more fun around him," says
Ollie simply. How else can you sum up over
60 years of friendship?
