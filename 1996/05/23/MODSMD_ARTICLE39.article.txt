The crisis that brings the throe McCrath
sisters of "Crimes of the Heart" togeth
er is shocking enough for national
newspaper headlines; In their hometown of
Ha/.elhurst, Miss., it is positively cataclysmic.
Youngest sister Babe has just shot her sen
ator husband because she "didn't like his
looks." This is the frame of Beth Henley's
Pulitzer Prize-winning play about the love
and tension in family relationships, especial
ly those between sisters.
Meanwhile, Babe's two older sisters are
facing their own personal crises. It seems that
nearly everyone has forgotten oldest sister
Lennie's birthday, and her horse has been
struck by lightning. Middle sister Meg has
come home from California, where she's
been trying to lead a singing career. Director
Lucinda Otto, an Arts Education Masters stu
dent, explains, "They're all trying to support
the youngest sister but also at the same time
they're all confronting the ramifications of
their own experiences."
The portraits of all three sisters, as well as
their interactions, are richly and fully de
tailed. "I think we all have our quirks," says
Joanna Selznick, a senior, who plays oldest
sister Lennie.
Lennie's been leading a rather sedate exis
tence until her 30th birthday, when "every
thing sort of collapses on her," says Selznick.
Selznick also describes Lennie as being the
most motherly of the three. While the other
two sisters have either left home or gotten
married, Lennie has stayed in their childhood
house and taken care of their sick grandfa
ther. Lennie is withdrawn and shy, easily van

quished by the sisters' busybody cousin,
Chick Boyles (played by Si Ivy Nordquist).
"Meg and Babe were a little more clued in
to life than Lennie was," Selznick explains,
"so maybe they laugh about things that
Lennie would never understand." There is
constant tension between Meg and Lennie,
particularly because Lennie doesn't always
approve of her younger sister's wild behavior.
Tanya Lukin, a sophomore, plays middle sis
ter Meg, perhaps the most flamboyant and
dramatic of the three sisters. Yet for all her
colorful theatrics, Meg is not without her in
securities.
"I think that Meg is deeply sensitive with
in," says Lukin, "but she's been through so
many hard things in her life that she's become
really defensive to cover her emotions. She's
dealing with the expectations placed on her
by her family, by her grandfather, by her sis
ters, by the whole town."
The way Meg deals with these expecta
tions is through rebellion.
"She's always bucking authority," explains
Lukin. "At the same time, being rebellious is
also an expectation placed on her. Everyone
expects her to run off and go to California
and sing, and that's exactly what she does."
Although Meg has attempted to escape her
old life, her return home brings back some
figures from the past; namely, her high school
sweetheart, Doc Porter, (played by Nathan
Harper), who she's rather surprised to dis
cover has married a "yankee" woman.
Babe, the youngest sister, is perhaps the
quirkiest of all. On one hand she's sweet; a
girl-next-door-type. On the other, she shoots

her husband in cold blood. Her only regret is
that her hands were shaking so much that she
got him in the stomach instead of the heart.
One person who definitely finds Babe's per
sonality attractive is her lawyer, Barnett I.loyd
(played by John Wright), who has a "person
al vendetta" against Babe's husband.
She's "an interesting dichotomy between a
woman who's very angry and woman who's
feels an obligation to be very well-behaved,"
says Julianne Arnall, a junior, of the character
she plays.
Arnall describes Babe as "the kind of
woman who's been raised to be obedient,
pleasant and sociable." At the same time,
Babe has had to endure a lot of abuse. "She's
finally gotten to the point where she's stand
ing up for herself," says Arnall.
In the family, Babe also functions as a
peacemaker. As the youngest she holds a spe
cial place in theheartsof the other two sisters.
The many different levels that Babe exists on
fascinates Arnall.
"She has this whole underground fantasy
world that she lives in because of the world
that she's allowed to live in,"says Arnall, "Her
social status, that she's a senator's wife, that
she's in the south — in order to really be her
self she's had to contrive this fantasy world
for herself."
The production of "Crimes of the Heart"
was born out of an actor-director class taught
by Anna Deavere Smith, which Otto, Arnall
and Lukin attended. After working together
on a scene from the play, they considered a
full production in the future.
"Crimes of the Heart" is being produced

witli the help of the Women's Performance
Collective. The theme of WPC's recent pro
duction "Presents and Promises: A Perfor
mance Kxploring Domestic Violence" is par
ticularly relevant to this play. In addition,
"Crimes of the Heart" provides an excellent
opportunity to showcase female actors and
directors.
Otto says,"It has really good strong roles
for women, which there seems to be not so
much of at Stanford in general and this quar
ter in particular." Lukin agrees, "It's really
nice to be working with a female director, and
I think that's really imperative for this show."
Although the most overt theme of this
play is sisterly relationships, "Crimes of the
Heart" also illustrates the bittersweet realities
in all relationships and in life.
Otto says,"I think it really says a lot about
people — women in particular— who make
choices for their lives based on what they
think is expected of them, rather than what
they want; and the serious consequences that
can have. I think that's a pretty strong mes
sage to get out to people who are at the age
and phase of life that Stanford undergradu
ates are."
