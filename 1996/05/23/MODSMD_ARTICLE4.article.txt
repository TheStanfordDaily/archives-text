# Costs of course readers increase
## Royalties reason behind rising prices 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
They lurk in the corner of the
Stanford Bookstore's lower level,
bound volumes of photocopies
that occasionally — and seeming
ly inexplicably — cost more than a
glossy textbook.
Course readers are an integral
part of every student's Stanford
career. But more frustrating than
understanding the material that
the readers contain is understand
ing the price.
Readers are priced by combin
ing the costs of production (paper,
printing and binding); estimates
of royalties to copyright owners,
called "permissions;" and the
costs of providing copies to the in
structor for use in class or as re
serve materials.
Permissions make up a signifi
cant portion of most course read
ers' price. The amount of royalties
charged varies widely among pub
lishers — some materials may be
used by the University for free,
while others cost several dollars
each.
The Daily selected four spring
quarter 1996 course readers as
representatives of the variety
available at the Bookstore: Prof.
Ward Watt's Biology 1 course
reader, Asst. Prof. Karen Kenkel's
Myth and Modernity Cultures,
Ideas and Values reader, Assoc.
Prof. Scott Sagan's Political Sci

ence 134 A reader and Asst. Prof.
Philippe Buc's History 15S read
er.
Of the readers studied, permis
sions costs ranged from 36 per
cent of the total price in the case of
Buc's three-volume History 15S
reader to 76 percent of the costs of
Watt's Biology 1 reader. Accord
ing to the Bookstore, these per
centages have been rising on a
quarterly basis.
A case currently being argued
in court, along with the increasing
use the Internet to grant permis
sions, may help keep costs from
skyrocketing further.
Estimation game
When professors request read
ers, they must give the Bookstore
copies of all the materials to b
eluded in the reader.
The Bookstore then begins the
long process of acquiring permis
sions. Because the process can
rarely be completed before the
professor needs the reader, the
Bookstore uses computerized esti
mates of the total cost of royalties.
As the permissions are acquired,
more than 75 percent of the read
ers are sent out to four local print
ers.
A database of previously used
articles helps make estimates
more accurate, said Stanford
Bookstore Custom Publishing
Production Supervisor Gerhard
Rokicki. With requests for approx
imately 600 readers each quarter,
the Bookstore is the largest cus
tom publisher of its kind in the
world.
Sometimes the computerized
estimates are right on the button,
Rokicki said. Other times, they are
not.
For example, the Bookstore se
verely underestimated the costs of
Sagan's Political Science 134 A
reader. Because the reader was
not turned in until March 22, 10
days before it was needed, the
Bookstore had to rely almost en
tirely on estimates. The Book
store's estimate was for royalties
amounting to $26.64 per student.
With a number of permissions still
to return, the actual per-student
cost amounts thus far to $53.91.

This makes me wor
ried. If these costs
continue to rise like
this, it could force
professors to rely on
judgments else
where, as in antholo
gy books, rather than
decide for ourselves,
as in readers.'
— Scoff Sagan

"We stand to lose about $3,000
on this one reader alone," Rokicki
said.
Sagan said he had not heard
about the Bookstore's estimation
error. But, he said, the fact that
the price of an already-expensive
reader should have been higher is
unsettling.
In contrast, for Watt's Biology
1 reader, the Bookstore estimated
a price of $22.36 per student for
royalties. This figure, when all
permissions had been granted,
was correct to the penny.
The estimate turned out a little
high for Kenkel's Myth and
Modernity reader. As of mid-quar
ter, the permissions had come
back costing $4.80 per student;
the Bookstore estimated $8. How
ever, several permissions requests
had not come back yet; therefore,
Rokicki said, the actual cost per
student would probably approach
the estimate.
For Buc's three-volume reader,
the estimate came back fairly
close, too. As of mid-quarter, the
permissions had come back cost
ing $26.42, while the estimate had
been for $24.58. Only four permis
sions had not returned yet.
Bookstore Course Materials
Manager Hani Sayegh said prices
can be more accurate if professors
turn in reader requests as soon as
possible.
"As an incentive to get the read
ers turned in early, we tell profes
sors that if they turn in their or
ders four weeks before they need it

on the shelves, we'll give them a 20
percent discount on the produc
tion costs," he said. "If they turn it
in three weeks before, we'll give a
10 percent discount."
These discounts pay off, Sayegh
said, because the Bookstore avoids
fees for rush printings and permis
sions costs can be predicted more
accurately.
"In most cases, if you can give
us enough time, we can get an an
swer, and we can work with it at
that point," Sayegh said.
Other vendors of course read
ers say they try not to rely on esti
mates, fearing cases such as with
Sagan's reader.
UC-Berkeley Bookstore Cus
tom Publishing Coordinator
Melissa Reeve said the bookstore
there sets a much earlier deadline
than Stanford, which makes de
pendence on estimates less neces
sary. The deadline for fall semes
ter readers is on June 28, almost
two months before they are need
ed.
"The truth is, usually only 30
percent of the readers are in by
deadline," she said. "About 50 per
cent come in during the three
weeks before classes."
Nonetheless, she said, earlier
deadlines and the fact that only
about 150 readers per semester
are requested protect the book
store from such errors.
"Probably the worst it's ever
been for us is about $5 over the
cost," she said. "Each semester,
we have only one or two readers
come in over cost."
Greg Crossfield, owner of Copy
Perfect, said he asks professors to
turn in readers at least a week to a
week-and-a-half early, so they do
not have to rely on estimates. Copy
Perfect, the Stanford Bookstore's
largest competitor, produces
about 35 readers per quarter, and
thus has a much smaller volume of
readers for which to get permis
sions.
Royal royalties
Prices of course readers have
gone up substantially in the past
several years, Sayegh said.
While production costs go up at
a modest clip of about 5 percent
per year, he said, permissions
costs have spiked significantly.
"Royalty costs are going up be
cause publishers' costs are going
up," he said.
However, UC-Berkeley's Reeve
said she has not seen such a dras
tic change in costs.
"I came in here in the middle of
the fall semester in 1994," she
said. "In my three full semesters
here, it has been pretty consis
tent."
The price hike can almost ex
clusively be traced to an increase
in the number of publishers re
questing permissions fees.
Two years ago, of the 31 per
missions requested for Buc's read
er, only five publishers requested
payment. This year, of 33 permis
sions requests, nine publishers re
quested money — a small percent
age comparatively. Prices of indi
vidual permissions have remained
steady, however.
In contrast, 25 of 30 permis
sions requests for Sagan's reader,
three of eight permissions re
quests for Kenkel's reader, and 15
of 17 permissions requests for

Watt's reader came back request
ing payment.
Isabella Hinds, the director of
professional relations for the
Copyright Clearing Center, said
while she has not seen permis
sions costs rising, she has seen
more publishers requesting fees.
The center is a not-for-profit com
pany which serves as an agent for
1,000 university bookstores and
handles 300,000 permissions re
quests each year.
"We have not seen any trends in
permissions costs rising," she
said. "We, however, have seen a
number of publishers who did not
charge for permissions beginning
to do so. This coincides with a rise
in the number of course packs and
the amount of material used in
this way."
Reader prices at Stanford have
reflected a significant change.
In the case of Buc's reader, the
cost has jumped from a total of
$58.05 two years ago, when the
class was last offered, to $85.15.
Despite this cost increase, the
reader contents are virtually the
same, both Buc and Sayegh said.
There is also a wide variance in
what companies charge for per
missions. In the readers studied,
articles and book excerpts cost
anywhere from less than a dollar
for an entire class to more than $6.
For example, the one-time
rights to a four-page article in
Watt's reader from Nature Maga
zine cost $ 185, or the equivalent of
$6.17 per reader. Another article
from Nature cost $139.00, or
$4.63 per reader.
Philip Campbell, the editor of
Nature, said change is coming.
"We are on the point of intro
ducing a drastic reduction in the
prices charged for photocopies,"
Campbell said. "Rates will be an
nounced shortly, but they will be
within the range charged by other
publishers."
For Sagan's reader, a set of nine
articles from MIT Press Journals
came to a total $ 18.96 per student.
Sagan says he found this figure
disturbing.
"This makes me worried,"
Sagan said. "If these costs contin
ue to rise like this, it could force
professors to rely on judgments
elsewhere, as in anthology books,
rather than decide for ourselves,
as in readers.
"We base readers in our best
judgment," Sagan said.
Paul Dzus, the subsidiary
rights manager for MIT Press
Journals, said his company sets
prices on a per-page, per-person
basis, charging 6 cents per page of
material used.
"As a university press, we try to
make sure we have a lower cost
than a commercial publisher," he
said, saying that the industry av
erage for a not-for-profit publisher
was about 5 cents a page, as op
posed to the 10 cents a page for
commercial publishers.
"The costs come from where it
costs us," Dzus said, citing em
ployee costs and production costs
as factors.
"If the first cost is not paid (for
printing the book or journal), then
the journal is not produced, and
you do not get the articles," Dzus
explained
Sayegh said that if a reader
ends up being overly expensive, he

will occasionally attempt to nego
tiate with the publisher to lower
the costs.
"I wish we could do it in every
single case, but it is not really pos
sible," he said. "It's done when
something really jumps out at you.
At that point, we'd call the pub
lisher and see if there's something
we can do. If not, we'll call the pro
fessor, and let them decide," he
said, adding that in rare cases, he
will ask the professors to negotiate
themselves.

'I am always torn
when I order readers.
I suspect that there
are always a few stu
dents for whom it is a
hardship, but when I
have suggested to
students that I would
forego readers and
put the stuff on re
serve, I meet cries of
pain. Most students
seem to want the
readers for conve
nience.'
— Donald Roberts

"It helps that we are Stanford,"
Sayegh said. "Typically, when we
call the publisher and (he) talks to
us one-on-one and sees that we are
from Stanford, it definitely helps."
Buc said he has never been ap
proached by the Bookstore to ne
gotiate but would if asked.
"I certainly would be willing to
negotiate with the presses when
they quote to the Bookstore an
egregious price per copy," Buc
said.
Sagan also said he has never
been approached.
"I think the Bookstore could go
back to the professors and tell
them the estimated costs for the

readers," Sagan said. "We have no
way of estimating the costs."
Some professors have even
tried putting course materials on
reserve, instead of having readers
made, to save the students money.
However, according to Communi
cation Prof. Donald Roberts, this
does not work well.
"I am always torn when I order
readers," Roberts said. "I suspect
that there are always a few stu
dents for whom it is a hardship,
but when I have suggested to stu
dents that I would forego readers
and put the stuff on reserve, I
meet cries of pain. Most students
seem to want the readers for con
venience."
Legal changes?
Earlier this year, it appeared
that the era of paying high royalties
costs could be at an end because of
a court decision supporting the
right of for-profit publishers to use
materials for educational purposes
without paying royalties.
On Feb. 12, the Sixth Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in
favor of a commercial Michigan
publisher, Michigan Document
Services, which produces readers
for several Michigan universities.
The company had been sued by
three publishers, backed by the
Association of American Publish
ers, for copyright infringement.
The court ruled that because the
readers were for educational use,
the company did not have to pay
royalties or get permissions.
Many legal analysts said this
case could set a precedent for other
publishers nationwide, such as the
Stanford Bookstore and Copy Per
fect. Such a ruling, if upheld, could
result in a 50 percent reduction in
reader cost, Sayegh said.
The three publishers have filed
a petition for rehearing and their
case will go to court June 12.
"We subjected a brief saying,
look, this decision is wrong, and it
is dangerously wrong," said Hank
Goldsmith, an attorney from the
law firm of Proskauer, Rose,
Goetz and Mendelsohn, who is
representing the three publishers
in the case.
The company "is taking this
and not paying for what it sells,"
Goldsmith said, comparing the
company's actions to theft.

Goldsmith emphasized that the
case is not about professors, stu
dents or not-for-profit retailers,
such as the Stanford Bookstore
but about a for-profit company
selling material it does not own.
"However, I can tell you that if
anybody made 500 copies of some
thing, we think the permissions
would have to be sought," Gold
smith said.
Goldsmith also emphasized
that his clients are not trying to
eliminate course readers.
"I think the point that kind of
gets lost here is that the publish
ers that create textbooks and so on
do not oppose readers," he said.
"What the publishers do oppose is
are course packs sold without per
missions."
A look ahead
The problem of rising course
reader costs is in the air right now,
especially with the court case still
looming. But, Hinds said improve
ments to the permissions process
are on the way.
"We feel very strongly at the
[Copyright Clearance Center] that
the summer of 1996 is a very im
portant time for the publishing
community to demonstrate to the
academic community its willing
ness to make the permissions
process easier, simpler and more
responsive to the needs of faculty
and students," she said. The cen
ter's on-line rights clearance cen
ter has already simplified the
process.
Sayegh said the center has told
him that a site licensing system —
in which rights are licensed to uni
versities and students pay a fee to
publishers as part of their tuition
— may be developed in the future.
"It would be easier for every
body," he said.
There is also talk of putting cer
tain texts on-line for students to
read. However, this creates a
whole new set of problems, accord
ing to History Prof. Jack Rakove.
"It would be nice to imagine a
brave new world where primary
sources and secondary materials
are on-line, and we can dispense
with hard copy," Rakove said.
"But what happens when you
want to ask a class to stare fixedly
at a particular passage and explain
just what... it means?"

Goldsmith, an attorney from the
law firm of Proskauer, Rose,
Goetz and Mendelsohn, who is
representing the three publishers
in the case.
The company "is taking this
and not paying for what it sells,"
Goldsmith said, comparing the
company's actions to theft.

Goldsmith emphasized that the
case is not about professors, stu
dents or not-for-profit retailers,
such as the Stanford Bookstore
but about a for-profit company
selling material it does not own.
"However, I can tell you that if
anybody made 500 copies of some
thing, we think the permissions
would have to be sought," Gold
smith said.
Goldsmith also emphasized
that his clients are not trying to
eliminate course readers.
"I think the point that kind of
gets lost here is that the publish
ers that create textbooks and so on
do not oppose readers," he said.
"What the publishers do oppose is
are course packs sold without per
missions."
A look ahead
The problem of rising course
reader costs is in the air right now,
especially with the court case still
looming. But, Hinds said improve
ments to the permissions process
are on the way.
"We feel very strongly at the
[Copyright Clearance Center] that
the summer of 1996 is a very im
portant time for the publishing
community to demonstrate to the
academic community its willing
ness to make the permissions
process easier, simpler and more
responsive to the needs of faculty
and students," she said. The cen
ter's on-line rights clearance cen
ter has already simplified the
process.
Sayegh said the center has told
him that a site licensing system —
in which rights are licensed to uni
versities and students pay a fee to
publishers as part of their tuition
— may be developed in the future.
"It would be easier for every
body," he said.
There is also talk of putting cer
tain texts on-line for students to
read. However, this creates a
whole new set of problems, accord
ing to History Prof. Jack Rakove.
"It would be nice to imagine a
brave new world where primary
sources and secondary materials
are on-line, and we can dispense
with hard copy," Rakove said.
"But what happens when you
want to ask a class to stare fixedly
at a particular passage and explain
just what... it means?"


Sothy Chhe — Dally
They lurk in the corner of the
Stanford Bookstore's lower level,
bound volumes of photocopies
that occasionally — and seeming
ly inexplicably — cost more than a
glossy textbook.
Course readers are an integral
part of every student's Stanford
career. But more frustrating than
understanding the material that
the readers contain is understand
ing the price.
Readers are priced by combin
ing the costs of production (paper,
printing and binding); estimates
of royalties to copyright owners,
called "permissions;" and the
costs of providing copies to the in
structor for use in class or as re
serve materials.
Permissions make up a signifi
cant portion of most course read
ers' price. The amount of royalties
charged varies widely among pub
lishers — some materials may be
used by the University for free,
while others cost several dollars
each.
The Daily selected four spring
quarter 1996 course readers as
representatives of the variety
available at the Bookstore: Prof.
Ward Watt's Biology 1 course
reader, Asst. Prof. Karen Kenkel's
Myth and Modernity Cultures,
Ideas and Values reader, Assoc.
Prof. Scott Sagan's Political Sci

ence 134 A reader and Asst. Prof.
Philippe Buc's History 15S read
er.
Of the readers studied, permis
sions costs ranged from 36 per
cent of the total price in the case of
Buc's three-volume History 15S
reader to 76 percent of the costs of
Watt's Biology 1 reader. Accord
ing to the Bookstore, these per
centages have been rising on a
quarterly basis.
A case currently being argued
in court, along with the increasing
use the Internet to grant permis
sions, may help keep costs from
skyrocketing further.
Estimation game
When professors request read
ers, they must give the Bookstore
copies of all the materials to b
eluded in the reader.
The Bookstore then begins the
long process of acquiring permis
sions. Because the process can
rarely be completed before the
professor needs the reader, the
Bookstore uses computerized esti
mates of the total cost of royalties.
As the permissions are acquired,
more than 75 percent of the read
ers are sent out to four local print
ers.
A database of previously used
articles helps make estimates
more accurate, said Stanford
Bookstore Custom Publishing
Production Supervisor Gerhard
Rokicki. With requests for approx
imately 600 readers each quarter,
the Bookstore is the largest cus
tom publisher of its kind in the
world.
Sometimes the computerized
estimates are right on the button,
Rokicki said. Other times, they are
not.
For example, the Bookstore se
verely underestimated the costs of
Sagan's Political Science 134 A
reader. Because the reader was
not turned in until March 22, 10
days before it was needed, the
Bookstore had to rely almost en
tirely on estimates. The Book
store's estimate was for royalties
amounting to $26.64 per student.
With a number of permissions still
to return, the actual per-student
cost amounts thus far to $53.91.

This makes me wor
ried. If these costs
continue to rise like
this, it could force
professors to rely on
judgments else
where, as in antholo
gy books, rather than
decide for ourselves,
as in readers.'
— Scoff Sagan

"We stand to lose about $3,000
on this one reader alone," Rokicki
said.
Sagan said he had not heard
about the Bookstore's estimation
error. But, he said, the fact that
the price of an already-expensive
reader should have been higher is
unsettling.
In contrast, for Watt's Biology
1 reader, the Bookstore estimated
a price of $22.36 per student for
royalties. This figure, when all
permissions had been granted,
was correct to the penny.
The estimate turned out a little
high for Kenkel's Myth and
Modernity reader. As of mid-quar
ter, the permissions had come
back costing $4.80 per student;
the Bookstore estimated $8. How
ever, several permissions requests
had not come back yet; therefore,
Rokicki said, the actual cost per
student would probably approach
the estimate.
For Buc's three-volume reader,
the estimate came back fairly
close, too. As of mid-quarter, the
permissions had come back cost
ing $26.42, while the estimate had
been for $24.58. Only four permis
sions had not returned yet.
Bookstore Course Materials
Manager Hani Sayegh said prices
can be more accurate if professors
turn in reader requests as soon as
possible.
"As an incentive to get the read
ers turned in early, we tell profes
sors that if they turn in their or
ders four weeks before they need it

on the shelves, we'll give them a 20
percent discount on the produc
tion costs," he said. "If they turn it
in three weeks before, we'll give a
10 percent discount."
These discounts pay off, Sayegh
said, because the Bookstore avoids
fees for rush printings and permis
sions costs can be predicted more
accurately.
"In most cases, if you can give
us enough time, we can get an an
swer, and we can work with it at
that point," Sayegh said.
Other vendors of course read
ers say they try not to rely on esti
mates, fearing cases such as with
Sagan's reader.
UC-Berkeley Bookstore Cus
tom Publishing Coordinator
Melissa Reeve said the bookstore
there sets a much earlier deadline
than Stanford, which makes de
pendence on estimates less neces
sary. The deadline for fall semes
ter readers is on June 28, almost
two months before they are need
ed.
"The truth is, usually only 30
percent of the readers are in by
deadline," she said. "About 50 per
cent come in during the three
weeks before classes."
Nonetheless, she said, earlier
deadlines and the fact that only
about 150 readers per semester
are requested protect the book
store from such errors.
"Probably the worst it's ever
been for us is about $5 over the
cost," she said. "Each semester,
we have only one or two readers
come in over cost."
Greg Crossfield, owner of Copy
Perfect, said he asks professors to
turn in readers at least a week to a
week-and-a-half early, so they do
not have to rely on estimates. Copy
Perfect, the Stanford Bookstore's
largest competitor, produces
about 35 readers per quarter, and
thus has a much smaller volume of
readers for which to get permis
sions.
Royal royalties
Prices of course readers have
gone up substantially in the past
several years, Sayegh said.
While production costs go up at
a modest clip of about 5 percent
per year, he said, permissions
costs have spiked significantly.
"Royalty costs are going up be
cause publishers' costs are going
up," he said.
However, UC-Berkeley's Reeve
said she has not seen such a dras
tic change in costs.
"I came in here in the middle of
the fall semester in 1994," she
said. "In my three full semesters
here, it has been pretty consis
tent."
The price hike can almost ex
clusively be traced to an increase
in the number of publishers re
questing permissions fees.
Two years ago, of the 31 per
missions requested for Buc's read
er, only five publishers requested
payment. This year, of 33 permis
sions requests, nine publishers re
quested money — a small percent
age comparatively. Prices of indi
vidual permissions have remained
steady, however.
In contrast, 25 of 30 permis
sions requests for Sagan's reader,
three of eight permissions re
quests for Kenkel's reader, and 15
of 17 permissions requests for

Watt's reader came back request
ing payment.
Isabella Hinds, the director of
professional relations for the
Copyright Clearing Center, said
while she has not seen permis
sions costs rising, she has seen
more publishers requesting fees.
The center is a not-for-profit com
pany which serves as an agent for
1,000 university bookstores and
handles 300,000 permissions re
quests each year.
"We have not seen any trends in
permissions costs rising," she
said. "We, however, have seen a
number of publishers who did not
charge for permissions beginning
to do so. This coincides with a rise
in the number of course packs and
the amount of material used in
this way."
Reader prices at Stanford have
reflected a significant change.
In the case of Buc's reader, the
cost has jumped from a total of
$58.05 two years ago, when the
class was last offered, to $85.15.
Despite this cost increase, the
reader contents are virtually the
same, both Buc and Sayegh said.
There is also a wide variance in
what companies charge for per
missions. In the readers studied,
articles and book excerpts cost
anywhere from less than a dollar
for an entire class to more than $6.
For example, the one-time
rights to a four-page article in
Watt's reader from Nature Maga
zine cost $ 185, or the equivalent of
$6.17 per reader. Another article
from Nature cost $139.00, or
$4.63 per reader.
Philip Campbell, the editor of
Nature, said change is coming.
"We are on the point of intro
ducing a drastic reduction in the
prices charged for photocopies,"
Campbell said. "Rates will be an
nounced shortly, but they will be
within the range charged by other
publishers."
For Sagan's reader, a set of nine
articles from MIT Press Journals
came to a total $ 18.96 per student.
Sagan says he found this figure
disturbing.
"This makes me worried,"
Sagan said. "If these costs contin
ue to rise like this, it could force
professors to rely on judgments
elsewhere, as in anthology books,
rather than decide for ourselves,
as in readers.
"We base readers in our best
judgment," Sagan said.
Paul Dzus, the subsidiary
rights manager for MIT Press
Journals, said his company sets
prices on a per-page, per-person
basis, charging 6 cents per page of
material used.
"As a university press, we try to
make sure we have a lower cost
than a commercial publisher," he
said, saying that the industry av
erage for a not-for-profit publisher
was about 5 cents a page, as op
posed to the 10 cents a page for
commercial publishers.
"The costs come from where it
costs us," Dzus said, citing em
ployee costs and production costs
as factors.
"If the first cost is not paid (for
printing the book or journal), then
the journal is not produced, and
you do not get the articles," Dzus
explained
Sayegh said that if a reader
ends up being overly expensive, he

will occasionally attempt to nego
tiate with the publisher to lower
the costs.
"I wish we could do it in every
single case, but it is not really pos
sible," he said. "It's done when
something really jumps out at you.
At that point, we'd call the pub
lisher and see if there's something
we can do. If not, we'll call the pro
fessor, and let them decide," he
said, adding that in rare cases, he
will ask the professors to negotiate
themselves.

'I am always torn
when I order readers.
I suspect that there
are always a few stu
dents for whom it is a
hardship, but when I
have suggested to
students that I would
forego readers and
put the stuff on re
serve, I meet cries of
pain. Most students
seem to want the
readers for conve
nience.'
— Donald Roberts

"It helps that we are Stanford,"
Sayegh said. "Typically, when we
call the publisher and (he) talks to
us one-on-one and sees that we are
from Stanford, it definitely helps."
Buc said he has never been ap
proached by the Bookstore to ne
gotiate but would if asked.
"I certainly would be willing to
negotiate with the presses when
they quote to the Bookstore an
egregious price per copy," Buc
said.
Sagan also said he has never
been approached.
"I think the Bookstore could go
back to the professors and tell
them the estimated costs for the

readers," Sagan said. "We have no
way of estimating the costs."
Some professors have even
tried putting course materials on
reserve, instead of having readers
made, to save the students money.
However, according to Communi
cation Prof. Donald Roberts, this
does not work well.
"I am always torn when I order
readers," Roberts said. "I suspect
that there are always a few stu
dents for whom it is a hardship,
but when I have suggested to stu
dents that I would forego readers
and put the stuff on reserve, I
meet cries of pain. Most students
seem to want the readers for con
venience."
Legal changes?
Earlier this year, it appeared
that the era of paying high royalties
costs could be at an end because of
a court decision supporting the
right of for-profit publishers to use
materials for educational purposes
without paying royalties.
On Feb. 12, the Sixth Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in
favor of a commercial Michigan
publisher, Michigan Document
Services, which produces readers
for several Michigan universities.
The company had been sued by
three publishers, backed by the
Association of American Publish
ers, for copyright infringement.
The court ruled that because the
readers were for educational use,
the company did not have to pay
royalties or get permissions.
Many legal analysts said this
case could set a precedent for other
publishers nationwide, such as the
Stanford Bookstore and Copy Per
fect. Such a ruling, if upheld, could
result in a 50 percent reduction in
reader cost, Sayegh said.
The three publishers have filed
a petition for rehearing and their
case will go to court June 12.
"We subjected a brief saying,
look, this decision is wrong, and it
is dangerously wrong," said Hank
Goldsmith, an attorney from the
law firm of Proskauer, Rose,
Goetz and Mendelsohn, who is
representing the three publishers
in the case.
The company "is taking this
and not paying for what it sells,"
Goldsmith said, comparing the
company's actions to theft.

Goldsmith emphasized that the
case is not about professors, stu
dents or not-for-profit retailers,
such as the Stanford Bookstore
but about a for-profit company
selling material it does not own.
"However, I can tell you that if
anybody made 500 copies of some

smith said.
Goldsmith also emphasized
that his clients are not trying to
eliminate course readers.
"I think the point that kind of

"What the publishers do oppose is

especially with the court case still

Sayegh said. "Typically, when we
call the publisher and (he) talks to
us one-on-one and sees that we are
from Stanford, it definitely helps."
Buc said he has never been ap
proached by the Bookstore to ne
gotiate but would if asked.
"I certainly would be willing to
negotiate with the presses when
they quote to the Bookstore an
egregious price per copy," Buc
said.
Sagan also said he has never
been approached.
"I think the Bookstore could go
back to the professors and tell
them the estimated costs for the

readers," Sagan said. "We have no
way of estimating the costs."
Some professors have even
tried putting course materials on
reserve, instead of having readers
made, to save the students money.
However, according to Communi
cation Prof. Donald Roberts, this
does not work well.
"I am always torn when I order
readers," Roberts said. "I suspect
that there are always a few stu
dents for whom it is a hardship,
but when I have suggested to stu
dents that I would forego readers
and put the stuff on reserve, I
meet cries of pain. Most students
seem to want the readers for con
venience."
Legal changes?
Earlier this year, it appeared
that the era of paying high royalties
costs could be at an end because of
a court decision supporting the
right of for-profit publishers to use
materials for educational purposes
without paying royalties.
On Feb. 12, the Sixth Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 in
favor of a commercial Michigan
publisher, Michigan Document
Services, which produces readers
for several Michigan universities.
The company had been sued by
three publishers, backed by the
Association of American Publish
ers, for copyright infringement.
The court ruled that because the
readers were for educational use,
the company did not have to pay
royalties or get permissions.
Many legal analysts said this
case could set a precedent for other
publishers nationwide, such as the
Stanford Bookstore and Copy Per
fect. Such a ruling, if upheld, could
result in a 50 percent reduction in
reader cost, Sayegh said.
The three publishers have filed
a petition for rehearing and their
case will go to court June 12.
"We subjected a brief saying,
look, this decision is wrong, and it
is dangerously wrong," said Hank
Goldsmith, an attorney from the
law firm of Proskauer, Rose,
Goetz and Mendelsohn, who is
representing the three publishers
in the case.
The company "is taking this
and not paying for what it sells,"
Goldsmith said, comparing the
company's actions to theft.

Goldsmith emphasized that the
case is not about professors, stu
dents or not-for-profit retailers,
such as the Stanford Bookstore
but about a for-profit company
selling material it does not own.
"However, I can tell you that if
anybody made 500 copies of some
thing, we think the permissions
would have to be sought," Gold
smith said.
Goldsmith also emphasized
that his clients are not trying to
eliminate course readers.
"I think the point that kind of
gets lost here is that the publish
ers that create textbooks and so on
do not oppose readers," he said.
"What the publishers do oppose is
are course packs sold without per
missions."
A look ahead
The problem of rising course
reader costs is in the air right now,
especially with the court case still
looming. But, Hinds said improve
ments to the permissions process
are on the way.
"We feel very strongly at the
[Copyright Clearance Center] that
the summer of 1996 is a very im
portant time for the publishing
community to demonstrate to the
academic community its willing
ness to make the permissions
process easier, simpler and more
responsive to the needs of faculty
and students," she said. The cen
ter's on-line rights clearance cen
ter has already simplified the
process.
Sayegh said the center has told
him that a site licensing system —
in which rights are licensed to uni
versities and students pay a fee to
publishers as part of their tuition
— may be developed in the future.
"It would be easier for every
body," he said.
There is also talk of putting cer
tain texts on-line for students to
read. However, this creates a
whole new set of problems, accord
ing to History Prof. Jack Rakove.
"It would be nice to imagine a
brave new world where primary
sources and secondary materials
are on-line, and we can dispense
with hard copy," Rakove said.
"But what happens when you
want to ask a class to stare fixedly
at a particular passage and explain
just what... it means?"


Sothy Chhe — Dally
They lurk in the corner of the
Stanford Bookstore's lower level,
bound volumes of photocopies
that occasionally — and seeming
ly inexplicably — cost more than a
glossy textbook.
Course readers are an integral
part of every student's Stanford
career. But more frustrating than
understanding the material that
the readers contain is understand
ing the price.
Readers are priced by combin
ing the costs of production (paper,
printing and binding); estimates
of royalties to copyright owners,
called "permissions;" and the
costs of providing copies to the in
structor for use in class or as re
serve materials.
Permissions make up a signifi
cant portion of most course read
ers' price. The amount of royalties
charged varies widely among pub
lishers — some materials may be
used by the University for free,
while others cost several dollars
each.
The Daily selected four spring
quarter 1996 course readers as
representatives of the variety
available at the Bookstore: Prof.
Ward Watt's Biology 1 course
reader, Asst. Prof. Karen Kenkel's
Myth and Modernity Cultures,
Ideas and Values reader, Assoc.
Prof. Scott Sagan's Political Sci

ence 134 A reader and Asst. Prof.
Philippe Buc's History 15S read
er.
Of the readers studied, permis
sions costs ranged from 36 per
cent of the total price in the case of
Buc's three-volume History 15S
reader to 76 percent of the costs of
Watt's Biology 1 reader. Accord
ing to the Bookstore, these per
centages have been rising on a
quarterly basis.
A case currently being argued
in court, along with the increasing
use the Internet to grant permis
sions, may help keep costs from
skyrocketing further.
Estimation game
When professors request read
ers, they must give the Bookstore
copies of all the materials to b
eluded in the reader.
The Bookstore then begins the
long process of acquiring permis
sions. Because the process can
rarely be completed before the
professor needs the reader, the
Bookstore uses computerized esti
mates of the total cost of royalties.
As the permissions are acquired,
more than 75 percent of the read
ers are sent out to four local print
ers.
A database of previously used
articles helps make estimates
more accurate, said Stanford
Bookstore Custom Publishing
Production Supervisor Gerhard
Rokicki. With requests for approx
imately 600 readers each quarter,
the Bookstore is the largest cus
tom publisher of its kind in the
world.
Sometimes the computerized
estimates are right on the button,
Rokicki said. Other times, they are
not.
For example, the Bookstore se
verely underestimated the costs of
Sagan's Political Science 134 A
reader. Because the reader was
not turned in until March 22, 10
days before it was needed, the
Bookstore had to rely almost en
tirely on estimates. The Book
store's estimate was for royalties
amounting to $26.64 per student.
With a number of permissions still
to return, the actual per-student
cost amounts thus far to $53.91.

This makes me wor
ried. If these costs
continue to rise like
this, it could force
professors to rely on
judgments else
where, as in antholo
gy books, rather than
decide for ourselves,
as in readers.'
— Scoff Sagan

"We stand to lose about $3,000
on this one reader alone," Rokicki
said.
Sagan said he had not heard
about the Bookstore's estimation
error. But, he said, the fact that
the price of an already-expensive
reader should have been higher is
unsettling.
In contrast, for Watt's Biology
1 reader, the Bookstore estimated
a price of $22.36 per student for
royalties. This figure, when all
permissions had been granted,
was correct to the penny.
The estimate turned out a little
high for Kenkel's Myth and
Modernity reader. As of mid-quar
ter, the permissions had come
back costing $4.80 per student;
the Bookstore estimated $8. How
ever, several permissions requests
had not come back yet; therefore,
Rokicki said, the actual cost per
student would probably approach
the estimate.
For Buc's three-volume reader,
the estimate came back fairly
close, too. As of mid-quarter, the
permissions had come back cost
ing $26.42, while the estimate had
been for $24.58. Only four permis
sions had not returned yet.
Bookstore Course Materials
Manager Hani Sayegh said prices
can be more accurate if professors
turn in reader requests as soon as
possible.
"As an incentive to get the read
ers turned in early, we tell profes
sors that if they turn in their or
ders four weeks before they need it

on the shelves, we'll give them a 20
percent discount on the produc
tion costs," he said. "If they turn it
in three weeks before, we'll give a
10 percent discount."
These discounts pay off, Sayegh
said, because the Bookstore avoids
fees for rush printings and permis
sions costs can be predicted more
accurately.
"In most cases, if you can give
us enough time, we can get an an
swer, and we can work with it at
that point," Sayegh said.
Other vendors of course read
ers say they try not to rely on esti
mates, fearing cases such as with
Sagan's reader.
UC-Berkeley Bookstore Cus
tom Publishing Coordinator
Melissa Reeve said the bookstore
there sets a much earlier deadline
than Stanford, which makes de
pendence on estimates less neces
sary. The deadline for fall semes
ter readers is on June 28, almost
two months before they are need
ed.
"The truth is, usually only 30
percent of the readers are in by
deadline," she said. "About 50 per
cent come in during the three
weeks before classes."
Nonetheless, she said, earlier
deadlines and the fact that only
about 150 readers per semester
are requested protect the book
store from such errors.
"Probably the worst it's ever
been for us is about $5 over the
cost," she said. "Each semester,
we have only one or two readers
come in over cost."
Greg Crossfield, owner of Copy
Perfect, said he asks professors to
turn in readers at least a week to a
week-and-a-half early, so they do
not have to rely on estimates. Copy
Perfect, the Stanford Bookstore's
largest competitor, produces
about 35 readers per quarter, and
thus has a much smaller volume of
readers for which to get permis
sions.
Royal royalties
Prices of course readers have
gone up substantially in the past
several years, Sayegh said.
While production costs go up at
a modest clip of about 5 percent
per year, he said, permissions
costs have spiked significantly.
"Royalty costs are going up be
cause publishers' costs are going
up," he said.
However, UC-Berkeley's Reeve
said she has not seen such a dras
tic change in costs.
"I came in here in the middle of
the fall semester in 1994," she
said. "In my three full semesters
here, it has been pretty consis
tent."
The price hike can almost ex
clusively be traced to an increase
in the number of publishers re
questing permissions fees.
Two years ago, of the 31 per
missions requested for Buc's read
er, only five publishers requested
payment. This year, of 33 permis
sions requests, nine publishers re
quested money — a small percent
age comparatively. Prices of indi
vidual permissions have remained
steady, however.
In contrast, 25 of 30 permis
sions requests for Sagan's reader,
three of eight permissions re
quests for Kenkel's reader, and 15
of 17 permissions requests for

Watt's reader came back request
ing payment.
Isabella Hinds, the director of
professional relations for the
Copyright Clearing Center, said
while she has not seen permis
sions costs rising, she has seen
more publishers requesting fees.
The center is a not-for-profit com
pany which serves as an agent for
1,000 university bookstores and
handles 300,000 permissions re
quests each year.
"We have not seen any trends in
permissions costs rising," she
said. "We, however, have seen a
number of publishers who did not
charge for permissions beginning
to do so. This coincides with a rise
in the number of course packs and
the amount of material used in
this way."
Reader prices at Stanford have
reflected a significant change.
In the case of Buc's reader, the
cost has jumped from a total of
$58.05 two years ago, when the
class was last offered, to $85.15.
Despite this cost increase, the
reader contents are virtually the
same, both Buc and Sayegh said.
There is also a wide variance in
what companies charge for per
missions. In the readers studied,
articles and book excerpts cost
anywhere from less than a dollar
for an entire class to more than $6.
For example, the one-time
rights to a four-page article in
Watt's reader from Nature Maga
zine cost $ 185, or the equivalent of
$6.17 per reader. Another article
from Nature cost $139.00, or
$4.63 per reader.
Philip Campbell, the editor of
Nature, said change is coming.
"We are on the point of intro
ducing a drastic reduction in the
prices charged for photocopies,"
Campbell said. "Rates will be an
nounced shortly, but they will be
within the range charged by other
publishers."
For Sagan's reader, a set of nine
articles from MIT Press Journals
came to a total $ 18.96 per student.
Sagan says he found this figure
disturbing.
"This makes me worried,"
Sagan said. "If these costs contin
ue to rise like this, it could force
professors to rely on judgments
elsewhere, as in anthology books,
rather than decide for ourselves,
as in readers.
"We base readers in our best
judgment," Sagan said.
Paul Dzus, the subsidiary
rights manager for MIT Press
Journals, said his company sets
prices on a per-page, per-person
basis, charging 6 cents per page of
material used.
"As a university press, we try to
make sure we have a lower cost
than a commercial publisher," he
said, saying that the industry av
erage for a not-for-profit publisher
was about 5 cents a page, as op
posed to the 10 cents a page for
commercial publishers.
"The costs come from where it
costs us," Dzus said, citing em
ployee costs and production costs
as factors.
"If the first cost is not paid (for
printing the book or journal), then
the journal is not produced, and
you do not get the articles," Dzus
explained
Sayegh said that if a reader
ends up being overly expensive, he

will occasionally attempt to nego
tiate with the publisher to lower
the costs.
"I wish we could do it in every
single case, but it is not really pos
sible," he said. "It's done when
something really jumps out at you.
At that point, we'd call the pub
lisher and see if there's something
we can do. If not, we'll call the pro
fessor, and let them decide," he
said, adding that in rare cases, he
will ask the professors to negotiate
themselves.

'I am always torn
when I order readers.
I suspect that there
are always a few stu
dents for whom it is a
hardship, but when I
have suggested to
students that I would
forego readers and
put the stuff on re
serve, I meet cries of
pain. Most students
seem to want the
readers for conve
nience.'
