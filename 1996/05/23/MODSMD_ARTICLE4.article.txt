# Costs of course readers increase
## Royalties reason behind rising prices 
### Jimmy Boegle Contributing writer 
They lurk in the corner of the
Stanford Bookstore's lower level,
bound volumes of photocopies
that occasionally — and seeming
ly inexplicably — cost more than a
glossy textbook.
Course readers are an integral
part of every student's Stanford
career. But more frustrating than
understanding the material that
the readers contain is understand
ing the price.
Readers are priced by combin
ing the costs of production (paper,
printing and binding); estimates
of royalties to copyright owners,
called "permissions;" and the
costs of providing copies to the in
structor for use in class or as re
serve materials.
Permissions make up a signifi
cant portion of most course read
ers' price. The amount of royalties
charged varies widely among pub
lishers — some materials may be
used by the University for free,
while others cost several dollars
each.
The Daily selected four spring
quarter 1996 course readers as
representatives of the variety
available at the Bookstore: Prof.
Ward Watt's Biology 1 course
reader, Asst. Prof. Karen Kenkel's
Myth and Modernity Cultures,
Ideas and Values reader, Assoc.
Prof. Scott Sagan's Political Sci

ence 134 A reader and Asst. Prof.
Philippe Buc's History 15S read
er.
Of the readers studied, permis
sions costs ranged from 36 per
cent of the total price in the case of
Buc's three-volume History 15S
reader to 76 percent of the costs of
Watt's Biology 1 reader. Accord
ing to the Bookstore, these per
centages have been rising on a
quarterly basis.
A case currently being argued
in court, along with the increasing
use the Internet to grant permis
sions, may help keep costs from
skyrocketing further.
Estimation game
When professors request read
ers, they must give the Bookstore
copies of all the materials to b
eluded in the reader.
The Bookstore then begins the
long process of acquiring permis
sions. Because the process can
rarely be completed before the
professor needs the reader, the
Bookstore uses computerized esti
mates of the total cost of royalties.
As the permissions are acquired,
more than 75 percent of the read
ers are sent out to four local print
ers.
A database of previously used
articles helps make estimates
more accurate, said Stanford
