## Teddy Turner hits the Web

With the Internet
Revolution upon
us, it seems that
there is very little
information out
there that cannot
be found on the
World Wide Web.
I've never been a
particularly big fan
of the whole web
surfing thing, but
the new crop of on
line magazines,
whose subjects

range from news to fashion to sports, are ac
tually pretty surf-worthy endeavors, even for
those of us who only use our computers to e
mail and write papers.
One particularly intriguing site is

http://www.cnn.com. Yep, that's right:
CNN on the Web! If you don't have a chance
to watch the fabulous 24-hour news net
work on television, now you can conve
niently catch all the day's news without ever
looking away from your computer screen!
Okay, so maybe the idea of an online CNN
news magazine doesn't exactly float your
boat, but the site does have enough going
for it, if only in terms of sheer quantity, to
please and appease just about any bored In
ternet disciple.
The home page consists of the day's head
lines (they aren't joking when they say "up
to-the-minute" — these babies get updated
just about every hour), as well as the "Link of
the Day"and other links to U.S. news, world
news, financial news, the political scene,
weather, sports, showbiz, technology news,
food and health info, the environment and
style news.
The format is pretty much exactly like
CNN itself— the news is broken down into

understandable bits of information that can
be swallowed relatively quickly. News within
each category is summarized in a short para
graph, with a link to longer, more detailed
versions of stories for those people with an
interest in them. The sports and style pages
are particularly appealing visually, with great
photographs accompanying the various
newsbites. And since the sites are all updated
so often, you can actually find out just what is
going on in the oh-so-volatile fashion world
at exactly the moment you log on.
Ah, the wonders of the Web.
l or those of you interested in the history
of CNN's online magazine, you can read the
letter on the site from CNN's president Tom
Johnson, who (pretty smugly) explains
CNN's critical role in the whole information
superhighway thing, you know, making sure
no one in the world falls out of "the loop."
Come on, if you don't have time to watch
CNN, now you can logon and find out what's
going on at any time!

But seriously, the CNN news magazine i.«
definitely not a bad thing. Since CNN (the
network) is broken down into half-hour seg
ments of news programs (financial news
sports, etc.), people might not be able to ac
cess the news they want at the time they want
For those people, the online magazine ver
sion is ideal, because it allows you to access
whatever you want whenever you want. Tht
site also features a "seek" function so you can
find information on a particular subject very
easily, whether it be for a research paper or
for your own edification.
When CNN (the network) first came oui
years ago, it was on the cutting edge of new>
reporting, promising to keep the world in
formed with up-to-the-minute news. Now
the network takes its promise to another level
and, all sarcasm aside, manages to live up to
its promise, providing the computer-literate
sector of the public with another way to stay
informed about what's going on in the world
today.
