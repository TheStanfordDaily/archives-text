### Story by Liz Chien Graphic by Travis Vigil 
Summer is quickly approaching, and
many students are scurrying to secure I
full-time positions for the fall or sum- 1
mer internships. Reality just kinda came and i
slapped everyone around. To many, the divid- I
ing line between the happy, fun days of college
and the drudgery of work, is a gluttonous \
chasm. In essence, work does not equal fun. <
But it doesn't have to be this way, as Garbage
shows us. The group of Shirley Manson (vocals, :
guitar), Butch Vig (drums), Steve Marker (gui- 1
tar) and Duke Erikson (guitar, bass, keyboards) <
is currently riding high on the success of their i
self-titled debut album, but things weren't al- J
ways this grand and chipper.
With the exception of Manson, who joined <
in 1994, the trio has known each other for over ,
a decade. Vig and Marker met while they were 1
undergrads at the University of Wisconsin. 1
After two years as a pre-med, Vig dropped out
and joined the band Spooner, where he met :
Erikson, who was that band's guitarist and !
singer. <
Marker continued at Wisconsin, as a Com- :
munication Arts major, and completed the trio
when he met the other members of Spooner I
hanging out at local clubs. A while later, Vig re- i
turned to college and he and Marker started
recording Spooner's songs with a four-track 1
recorder and a microphone.
"We would go all over town and record Â«
weird stuff and play it backwards and at wrong i
speeds. But it was just the process of making |
something sound cool that was fascinating to I
us," says Marker. <
This interest in mixing and creating noises
led to the founding of Smart Studios in 1984.
"We booked a lot of bogus bands that never ;
played actually. Often, somebody would cancel 1
studio time, and Steve and 1 would invent a I
band and just record one song," says Vig in a Los i
Angeles Times interview.
"We were just really, really poor for a long <
time, because we put everything we made back
into the studio to try to make it better," says
Marker. I
Their perseverance paid off as Marker, Vig I
and Erikson became well-known producers in i
the music industry. It was at Smart Studios
where Vig produced Nirvana's "Nevermind," :
and the Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth and i
Soul Asylum albums. <
But was the trio ready for something differ- i
ent? Why not stick with something successful,
something comfortable? Or even a job in a dif- i
ferent field? Says Marker, "It's gone too far now
and there's no other options. So we have to keep i
the music going."
I
That continuation was Garbage. After i
doing a series of remixes for U2, De- I
peche Mode and Nine Inch Nails,
where the trio experimented with sound, in- i
strumentals and vocals, they created complete- i
ly new tracks, and from that, a unique style i
emerged. Says Vig in Rolling Stone magazine, '
"We wanted to be able to take punk and funk 1
and techno and hip-hop and ambiance and j
noise, whatever, and just somehow use all those |
elements within the context of a pop song." <
All this is fine and good, but without some- I
one to vocalize those lovely melodies, the pro
ject still fell short. The trio wanted a female i

singer because as Vig has said "we were sick of
hearing our own voices, and we were used to
working with guys. We thought it would be cool
to have a different perspective." This is where
Manson enters the picture.
Marker spotted her, then in the band An
gelfish, playing on MTV's 120 minutes, and de
cided that she was the one. "We liked her voice
a lot. It's a dark, seductive voice, and we wanted
something with depth anil character," explains
Marker. Yes, Manson's voice definitely has those
qualities, and Marker was not the first to recog
nize it. In her early 2()s, she also played with the
Scottish group Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie.
However, some have criticized the three in
dustry veterans' calculated search for a singer.
After all, when Marker first spied Manson, she
was still a part of Angelfish. But the process
wasn't as shady as it sounds.
"I wrote down the name of the band, made
some calls the next day and tracked her down in
Scotland. They [Angelfish] were coming to the
states, and we met in Chicago, had cocktails,
stayed up late and had fun," explains Marker.
The trio's timing could not have been better. At
the time of the meeting in Chicago, "her drum
mer had just quit and her band was falling
apart. So we were lucky and really glad that she
was able to do it,"says Marker.
Manson's first trip out to Smart Studios
didn't go quite so well. "It was weird at first. I
mean, it was a situation where there were three
people who knew each other really well, and a
fourth who just came from Scotland, who
didn't know the others well," Marker admits.
"But the singing was great."
Although it was an awkward situation, Man
son "had the balls to come back. The last thing
we wanted was somebody we could manipu
late," Vig has said. Manson, indeed, had the
gumption to say what was on her mind.
To some song lyrics, she would exclaim, "I
can't sing this bloody crap!" Manson has said,
"There were just certain things I wouldn't sing
about, and on other songs I wanted to change
the perspective. Being the only woman in the
band, it was necessary to do this to stay true to
myself."
Rather than alienating the others, Manson's
strong personality only reinforced the dynam
ics of the group. "When Shirley arrived,
Garbage became a band rather than just an
idea," F.rickson has said.
"There was no way we could've made the
record without her," says Marker.
Manson brought more than her unique
character to the group; she also brought her
song writing and lyrics. "We all contribute to
the music and words, but some of the songs are
mainly hers. But we all write very collaborative
ly," explains Marker.
He continues, "Our song writing is frag
mented. People would bring in pieces of
noise, lyrics, progressions and titles, and we
would sit and mess around with it. And then
we would play around with it in the studio.
For every song that does get used, a hundred
get thrown out." Marker laughs, "So, it's a
good way to waste lots of time. But at the end
of the day, we usually end up with something
that's worthwhile."
Although the group collaborates on the
initial ideas for songs, Manson has the final

word on songs. "Shirley's the one who has to
sing the lyrics and she has the most to do with
how the lyrics get put together in the end. So,
if she doesn't like something, she simply won't
sing it. She's like our editor," explains Marker.
Perhaps this elucidates why there are such
dark undertones to most of the songs, lie
sides the fact that Vig was looking for some
one who "could sing in an understated way,"
so that the sound would be more subversive,
Manson'sown personal history lends itself to
this angstful atmosphere. She grew up des
perately unhappy, despite a perfect upbring
ing.
"I was convinced I was the ugliest creature
that ever lived, that everybody hated me and
the only way to deal with it was to be as un
pleasant as possible," Manson has said. This
attitude comes out in "Vow," where she sings,
"You burned me out / but I'm back at your
door/Like loan of Arc coming back for
more /1 came around to tear your little world
apart. / And break your soul apart."
But the group's propensity for these
themes of such extreme emotions is not com
pletely random. Manson has said, "I find
most normal people full of excess anil rebel
lion. Weirdness lurks in the most unlikely cor
ners ... It's easy to be morose and hard to be
happy. Maybe the next album will be more
jolly."
This is not to say that the band did not try
for a "happy" song. In "A Stroke of Luck,"
Manson wonders, "A stroke of luck or a gift
from God? / The hand of fate or devil's
claws? / You come to me now." This may
sound depressing. But trust me, its the most
chipper song on the album. Vig has said, "We
wanted to have one happy song, but..."
However, this dearth of peppy tunes sim
ply shows Garbage's individuality, and their
ability to play what they want without the in
terference of extraneous influences. Their
music allows the listener to interpret for him
self the meaning of the lyrics, and what he
wants to get out of them. Says Marker, "We get
letters from kids about how a song helped
them get through a bad situation.
For instance, "Queer" was received by a lot
of people as a song that gave them strength,
and told them that's it's okay to be different
and not to fit in like everyone else." He con
tinues, "We don't want to be a preachy, mes
sage band, especially since everything on the
radio is very serious grunge stuff that's
preachy and political. Just because you're a
singer in a band doesn't mean that you under
stand the world. If people get little things here
and there from our songs, that would be
enough for us."
So, the group sees themselves as role mod
els?
"No, not at all. Some people may like how
we put songs together, or that we're older and
it took a long time for us to get a record out...
that we stuck to it for a long time. But I won't
ever suggest that people live like us. It's better
just to live your own life. That's a better way to
go," says Marker.
But why wouldn't people want to live like
them? Just think: success, riches, fame. But
surprisingly enough, the group is very down
to earth and doesn't try to perpetuate any

image. For example, during vacations, Mark
er just goes home to Madison, Wis., and likes
to read in his spare time. "We're not real glam
orous people. But Shirley can be and she has
fun with that," says Marker. "If we tried to
concoct an image, we would all fall over
laughing. It would be so ridiculous."
He continues, "Life is screwed up enough
having people act like rock stars."
Their modest attitudes is also seen in how
the group received their "big break."
Marker explains, "There's no one thing.
We're just really lucky to take this crazy idea
we had and made up a demo tape with four
songs. We didn't want to push the fact that
Butch is a pretty well known guy in the indus
try. We just wanted people to respond to the
music."
As for the whole process of becoming a
successful band, Marker feels that:
"We've done everything backwards.
Most bands go on the road, play in every club
and drive around the country in a station
v\agon, but we have all done that in other bands
and didn't want to do that this time. This was
more of a writing songs in a studio kind of
thing."
Their sensible natures are also reflected in
how they view success. "We have been through
the business, and we've seen so many people get
totally fucked up by the business and get
screwed up in the head by taking it so seriously
... by getting caught in the hype. You do have
people telling you that you're great which is all
fine and well, but if you start believing that
you're better than everybody else, then you can
turn into a monster. That happens to rock mu
sicians everyday. We've been able to avoid that,
and I'm glad for that," says Marker.
But for all their practicality and fun, like
any group, conflicts do arise. "Like every three
and a half minutes," says Marker. "There are
constantly so many decisions to make and
we're all pretty pigheaded when it comes to
getting our way. We tend to lock ourselves in a
dark room and have some good fights about
how a song should sound like. The strongest
ideas usually emerge from this. But we can still
go out to dinner after squabbling the whole
day."
This ability to cooperate both professionally
and personally predicts a long lite for Garbage.
Future plans? "Well, we spent Monday with
Trickydoinga newversion of"Milk," which will
sound pretty cool when it's finished. We also
worked for the "Sweet Relief" album to help out
musicians without health insurance. But for
right now, we're just touring and playing with
Smashing Pumpkins," says Marker. They plan
to work on a new album early next year.
By now, you might be curious to find out
why the band name is Garbage. The idea came
while the trio was working on a "Nine Inch
Nails thing that never got released. At the be
ginning, it sounded really horrible... the tape
was just full of horrible noises. We tilled the tape
up with weird stuff and edited from there.
Friends listened to it and said, 'That's garbage.'
But that was before we found Shirley ..." ex
plains Marker.
And the rest is, well, history. Garbage has
shown us that work can be fun. That is, if you're
involved with the music industry. But more
than their career field, their down-to-earth atti
tude about work and success goes a long way in
determining how content they are with life.
Then again, can someone with an e-mail ad
dress of "subhuman*Â®garbage.com" be that
happy?

Scottish group Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie.
However, some have criticized the three in
dustry veterans' calculated search for a singer.
After all, when Marker first spied Manson, she
was still a part of Angelfish. But the process
wasn't as shady as it sounds.
"I wrote down the name of the band, made
some calls the next day and tracked her down in
Scotland. They [Angelfish] were coming to the
states, and we met in Chicago, had cocktails,
stayed up late and had fun," explains Marker.
The trio's timing could not have been better. At
the time of the meeting in Chicago, "her drum
mer had just quit and her band was falling
apart. So we were lucky and really glad that she
was able to do it,"says Marker.
Manson's first trip out to Smart Studios
didn't go quite so well. "It was weird at first. I
mean, it was a situation where there were three
people who knew each other really well, and a
fourth who just came from Scotland, who
didn't know the others well," Marker admits.
"But the singing was great."
Although it was an awkward situation, Man
son "had the balls to come back. The last thing
we wanted was somebody we could manipu
late," Vig has said. Manson, indeed, had the
gumption to say what was on her mind.
To some song lyrics, she would exclaim, "I
can't sing this bloody crap!" Manson has said,
"There were just certain things I wouldn't sing
about, and on other songs I wanted to change
the perspective. Being the only woman in the
band, it was necessary to do this to stay true to
myself."
Rather than alienating the others, Manson's
strong personality only reinforced the dynam
ics of the group. "When Shirley arrived,
Garbage became a band rather than just an
idea," F.rickson has said.
"There was no way we could've made the
record without her," says Marker.
Manson brought more than her unique
character to the group; she also brought her
song writing and lyrics. "We all contribute to
the music and words, but some of the songs are
mainly hers. But we all write very collaborative
ly," explains Marker.
He continues, "Our song writing is frag
mented. People would bring in pieces of
noise, lyrics, progressions and titles, and we
would sit and mess around with it. And then
we would play around with it in the studio.
For every song that does get used, a hundred
get thrown out." Marker laughs, "So, it's a
good way to waste lots of time. But at the end
of the day, we usually end up with something
that's worthwhile."
Although the group collaborates on the
initial ideas for songs, Manson has the final

word on songs. "Shirley's the one who has to
sing the lyrics and she has the most to do with
how the lyrics get put together in the end. So,
if she doesn't like something, she simply won't
sing it. She's like our editor," explains Marker.
Perhaps this elucidates why there are such
dark undertones to most of the songs, lie
sides the fact that Vig was looking for some
one who "could sing in an understated way,"
so that the sound would be more subversive,
Manson'sown personal history lends itself to
this angstful atmosphere. She grew up des
perately unhappy, despite a perfect upbring
ing.
"I was convinced I was the ugliest creature
that ever lived, that everybody hated me and
the only way to deal with it was to be as un
pleasant as possible," Manson has said. This
attitude comes out in "Vow," where she sings,
"You burned me out / but I'm back at your
door/Like loan of Arc coming back for
more /1 came around to tear your little world
apart. / And break your soul apart."
But the group's propensity for these
themes of such extreme emotions is not com
pletely random. Manson has said, "I find
most normal people full of excess anil rebel
lion. Weirdness lurks in the most unlikely cor
ners ... It's easy to be morose and hard to be
happy. Maybe the next album will be more
jolly."
This is not to say that the band did not try
for a "happy" song. In "A Stroke of Luck,"
Manson wonders, "A stroke of luck or a gift
from God? / The hand of fate or devil's
claws? / You come to me now." This may
sound depressing. But trust me, its the most
chipper song on the album. Vig has said, "We
wanted to have one happy song, but..."
However, this dearth of peppy tunes sim
ply shows Garbage's individuality, and their
ability to play what they want without the in
terference of extraneous influences. Their
music allows the listener to interpret for him
self the meaning of the lyrics, and what he
wants to get out of them. Says Marker, "We get
letters from kids about how a song helped
them get through a bad situation.
For instance, "Queer" was received by a lot
of people as a song that gave them strength,
and told them that's it's okay to be different
and not to fit in like everyone else." He con
tinues, "We don't want to be a preachy, mes
sage band, especially since everything on the
radio is very serious grunge stuff that's
preachy and political. Just because you're a
singer in a band doesn't mean that you under
stand the world. If people get little things here
and there from our songs, that would be
enough for us."
So, the group sees themselves as role mod
els?
"No, not at all. Some people may like how
we put songs together, or that we're older and
it took a long time for us to get a record out...
that we stuck to it for a long time. But I won't
ever suggest that people live like us. It's better
just to live your own life. That's a better way to
go," says Marker.
But why wouldn't people want to live like
them? Just think: success, riches, fame. But
surprisingly enough, the group is very down
to earth and doesn't try to perpetuate any

image. For example, during vacations, Mark
er just goes home to Madison, Wis., and likes
to read in his spare time. "We're not real glam
orous people. But Shirley can be and she has
fun with that," says Marker. "If we tried to
concoct an image, we would all fall over
laughing. It would be so ridiculous."
He continues, "Life is screwed up enough
having people act like rock stars."
Their modest attitudes is also seen in how
the group received their "big break."
Marker explains, "There's no one thing.
We're just really lucky to take this crazy idea
we had and made up a demo tape with four
songs. We didn't want to push the fact that
Butch is a pretty well known guy in the indus
try. We just wanted people to respond to the
music."
As for the whole process of becoming a
successful band, Marker feels that:
"We've done everything backwards.
Most bands go on the road, play in every club
and drive around the country in a station
v\agon, but we have all done that in other bands
and didn't want to do that this time. This was
more of a writing songs in a studio kind of
thing."
Their sensible natures are also reflected in
how they view success. "We have been through
the business, and we've seen so many people get
totally fucked up by the business and get
screwed up in the head by taking it so seriously
... by getting caught in the hype. You do have
people telling you that you're great which is all
fine and well, but if you start believing that
you're better than everybody else, then you can
turn into a monster. That happens to rock mu
sicians everyday. We've been able to avoid that,
and I'm glad for that," says Marker.
But for all their practicality and fun, like
any group, conflicts do arise. "Like every three
and a half minutes," says Marker. "There are
constantly so many decisions to make and
we're all pretty pigheaded when it comes to
getting our way. We tend to lock ourselves in a
dark room and have some good fights about
how a song should sound like. The strongest
ideas usually emerge from this. But we can still
go out to dinner after squabbling the whole
day."
This ability to cooperate both professionally
and personally predicts a long lite for Garbage.
Future plans? "Well, we spent Monday with
Trickydoinga newversion of"Milk," which will
sound pretty cool when it's finished. We also
worked for the "Sweet Relief" album to help out
musicians without health insurance. But for
right now, we're just touring and playing with
Smashing Pumpkins," says Marker. They plan
to work on a new album early next year.
By now, you might be curious to find out
why the band name is Garbage. The idea came
while the trio was working on a "Nine Inch
Nails thing that never got released. At the be
ginning, it sounded really horrible... the tape
was just full of horrible noises. We tilled the tape
up with weird stuff and edited from there.
Friends listened to it and said, 'That's garbage.'
But that was before we found Shirley ..." ex
plains Marker.
And the rest is, well, history. Garbage has
shown us that work can be fun. That is, if you're
involved with the music industry. But more
than their career field, their down-to-earth atti
tude about work and success goes a long way in
determining how content they are with life.
Then again, can someone with an e-mail ad
dress of "subhuman*Â®garbage.com" be that
happy?
Summer is quickly approaching, and
many students are scurrying to secure I
full-time positions for the fall or sum- 1
mer internships. Reality just kinda came and i
slapped everyone around. To many, the divid- I
ing line between the happy, fun days of college
and the drudgery of work, is a gluttonous \
chasm. In essence, work does not equal fun. <
But it doesn't have to be this way, as Garbage
shows us. The group of Shirley Manson (vocals, :
guitar), Butch Vig (drums), Steve Marker (gui- 1
tar) and Duke Erikson (guitar, bass, keyboards) <
is currently riding high on the success of their i
self-titled debut album, but things weren't al- J
ways this grand and chipper.
With the exception of Manson, who joined <
in 1994, the trio has known each other for over ,
a decade. Vig and Marker met while they were 1
undergrads at the University of Wisconsin. 1
After two years as a pre-med, Vig dropped out
and joined the band Spooner, where he met :
Erikson, who was that band's guitarist and !
singer. <
Marker continued at Wisconsin, as a Com- :
munication Arts major, and completed the trio
when he met the other members of Spooner I
hanging out at local clubs. A while later, Vig re- i
turned to college and he and Marker started
recording Spooner's songs with a four-track 1
recorder and a microphone.
"We would go all over town and record Â«
weird stuff and play it backwards and at wrong i
speeds. But it was just the process of making |
something sound cool that was fascinating to I
us," says Marker. <
This interest in mixing and creating noises
led to the founding of Smart Studios in 1984.
"We booked a lot of bogus bands that never ;
played actually. Often, somebody would cancel 1
studio time, and Steve and 1 would invent a I
band and just record one song," says Vig in a Los i
Angeles Times interview.
"We were just really, really poor for a long <
time, because we put everything we made back
into the studio to try to make it better," says
Marker. I
Their perseverance paid off as Marker, Vig I
and Erikson became well-known producers in i
the music industry. It was at Smart Studios
where Vig produced Nirvana's "Nevermind," :
and the Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth and i
Soul Asylum albums. <
But was the trio ready for something differ- i
ent? Why not stick with something successful,
something comfortable? Or even a job in a dif- i
ferent field? Says Marker, "It's gone too far now
and there's no other options. So we have to keep i
the music going."
I
That continuation was Garbage. After i
doing a series of remixes for U2, De- I
peche Mode and Nine Inch Nails,
where the trio experimented with sound, in- i
strumentals and vocals, they created complete- i
ly new tracks, and from that, a unique style i
emerged. Says Vig in Rolling Stone magazine, '
"We wanted to be able to take punk and funk 1
and techno and hip-hop and ambiance and j
noise, whatever, and just somehow use all those |
elements within the context of a pop song." <
All this is fine and good, but without some- I
one to vocalize those lovely melodies, the pro
ject still fell short. The trio wanted a female i

singer because as Vig has said "we were sick of
hearing our own voices, and we were used to
working with guys. We thought it would be cool
to have a different perspective." This is where
Manson enters the picture.
Marker spotted her, then in the band An
gelfish, playing on MTV's 120 minutes, and de
cided that she was the one. "We liked her voice
a lot. It's a dark, seductive voice, and we wanted
something with depth anil character," explains
Marker. Yes, Manson's voice definitely has those
qualities, and Marker was not the first to recog
nize it. In her early 2()s, she also played with the
Scottish group Goodbye Mr. Mackenzie.
However, some have criticized the three in

happy. Maybe the next album will be more
jolly."
This is not to say that the band did not try
for a "happy" song. In "A Stroke of Luck,"
Manson wonders, "A stroke of luck or a gift
from God? / The hand of fate or devil's
claws? / You come to me now." This may
sound depressing. But trust me, its the most
chipper song on the album. Vig has said, "We
wanted to have one happy song, but..."
However, this dearth of peppy tunes sim
ply shows Garbage's individuality, and their
ability to play what they want without the in
terference of extraneous influences. Their
music allows the listener to interpret for him
self the meaning of the lyrics, and what he
wants to get out of them. Says Marker, "We get
letters from kids about how a song helped
them get through a bad situation.
For instance, "Queer" was received by a lot
of people as a song that gave them strength,
and told them that's it's okay to be different
and not to fit in like everyone else." He con
tinues, "We don't want to be a preachy, mes
sage band, especially since everything on the
radio is very serious grunge stuff that's
preachy and political. Just because you're a
singer in a band doesn't mean that you under
stand the world. If people get little things here
and there from our songs, that would be
enough for us."
So, the group sees themselves as role mod
els?
"No, not at all. Some people may like how
we put songs together, or that we're older and
it took a long time for us to get a record out...
that we stuck to it for a long time. But I won't
ever suggest that people live like us. It's better
just to live your own life. That's a better way to
go," says Marker.
But why wouldn't people want to live like
them? Just think: success, riches, fame. But
surprisingly enough, the group is very down
to earth and doesn't try to perpetuate any

image. For example, during vacations, Mark
er just goes home to Madison, Wis., and likes
to read in his spare time. "We're not real glam
orous people. But Shirley can be and she has
fun with that," says Marker. "If we tried to
concoct an image, we would all fall over
laughing. It would be so ridiculous."
He continues, "Life is screwed up enough
having people act like rock stars."
Their modest attitudes is also seen in how
the group received their "big break."
Marker explains, "There's no one thing.
We're just really lucky to take this crazy idea
we had and made up a demo tape with four
songs. We didn't want to push the fact that
Butch is a pretty well known guy in the indus
try. We just wanted people to respond to the
music."
As for the whole process of becoming a
successful band, Marker feels that:
"We've done everything backwards.
Most bands go on the road, play in every club
and drive around the country in a station
v\agon, but we have all done that in other bands
and didn't want to do that this time. This was
more of a writing songs in a studio kind of
thing."
Their sensible natures are also reflected in
how they view success. "We have been through
the business, and we've seen so many people get
totally fucked up by the business and get
screwed up in the head by taking it so seriously
... by getting caught in the hype. You do have
people telling you that you're great which is all
fine and well, but if you start believing that
you're better than everybody else, then you can
turn into a monster. That happens to rock mu
sicians everyday. We've been able to avoid that,
and I'm glad for that," says Marker.
But for all their practicality and fun, like
any group, conflicts do arise. "Like every three
and a half minutes," says Marker. "There are
constantly so many decisions to make and
we're all pretty pigheaded when it comes to
getting our way. We tend to lock ourselves in a
dark room and have some good fights about
how a song should sound like. The strongest
ideas usually emerge from this. But we can still
go out to dinner after squabbling the whole
day."
This ability to cooperate both professionally
and personally predicts a long lite for Garbage.
Future plans? "Well, we spent Monday with
Trickydoinga newversion of"Milk," which will
sound pretty cool when it's finished. We also
worked for the "Sweet Relief" album to help out
musicians without health insurance. But for
right now, we're just touring and playing with
Smashing Pumpkins," says Marker. They plan
to work on a new album early next year.
By now, you might be curious to find out
why the band name is Garbage. The idea came
while the trio was working on a "Nine Inch
Nails thing that never got released. At the be
ginning, it sounded really horrible... the tape
was just full of horrible noises. We tilled the tape
up with weird stuff and edited from there.
Friends listened to it and said, 'That's garbage.'
But that was before we found Shirley ..." ex
plains Marker.
And the rest is, well, history. Garbage has
shown us that work can be fun. That is, if you're
involved with the music industry. But more
than their career field, their down-to-earth atti
tude about work and success goes a long way in
determining how content they are with life.
Then again, can someone with an e-mail ad
dress of "subhuman*Â®garbage.com" be that
happy?
