## SPOON Telephono 
### 
The songs on Spoon's magnificent debut
"Telephono" seem impulsive, the careening
guitars and bent rhythms the signature of a
band committed to off-the-cuff hysterics. ()n
closer listen, however, this savvy threesome
from Austin, Tex., reveals deceptive restraint.
The melodies are too perfect, the blasts ot
noise too expertly placed to be pure improvi
sat ion. bach song is a compact wonder, exud
ing an energy that leans against tightly held
reins. The deception has to do with speed
and brevity. Along with skill and style,
Spoon's got urgency 011 their .side.
Insistent and fierce, Britt Daniel's guitar
sounds wonderfully thin. His amped-up
acoustic delivers a granular attack, a ringing,
airy sound that never grinds or crunches. I lis
voice, ranging from dour precision to an un
kempt howl propels songs like "All the Nega
tives Have Been Destroyed" with savory em
phasis. "Nefarious" is a brilliant tribute to the
odd-ball pop instincts of the Dixies, with
bassist Andy Maguire's accompaniment pro
viding the Kim to Daniel's dead-011 I rank.
The similarity is more tribute than imitation,
however, more flattery than thievery. The
Pixies wrote the book on pop irreverence,
and Spoon seem to know it. If "Dismember"
sounds like something off of "Surfer Rosa,"
that's only because Daniel's guitar manages
to maneuver an odd, upbeat verse before
whipping itself into a frenetic pav-off in the
refrain.
"Plastic Mylar" may be the best song on
the album recalling the king pins of indie
pop with its acidic tunefulness. The edge is
unmistakable, but Spoon's bitterness never
sounds wounded. They pound at you with an
irrepressible gaiety, an impulse to impress.
With "Telephono," Spoon have delivered one
of the great albums of the year and one of the
greatest debuts in a while.
