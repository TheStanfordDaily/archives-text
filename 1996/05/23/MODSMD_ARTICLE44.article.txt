College bands are often frowned upon by
the public. They usually consist of a couple of
semi-musicians who just want to play for free
beer. But every once in awhile, a college band
will challenge the stereotype, fine tune their
music and come across with a genuine origi
nal sound.
I abrosse-King, straight from our own
Stanford University, are doing just that. The
acoustic trio, named after vocalist Joseph
King and percussionist lean Paul I.abrosse,
have put together an impressive debut album
that should put them in a different category
112 rom the "typical college band" genre.
The band's music is simple: a strummed
acoustii guitar, melodic bass line, percussion
in the background and soothing vocals.
1 lowever, the way the music is mixed togeth
er in a way that adds an entirely new depth to
the sound. No one instrument dominates the
songs, yet at the same time each instrument
is interesting enough to keep individually the
listener's attention. Likewise, King's vocals
don't overpower the music, but they blend in
perfectly.
The album begins with the upbeat,
groove-oriented "Robinson Canyon." The
percussion track on this song makes it one of
the better songs on the album with the way it
creatively blends into the background even
though it is an essential part of the song.
I ikewise, the acoustic guitar blends in just as
well, allowing the bass and vocals to set the
stage for the melody.
The album also features slower songs like
"Brown To Gold" and "You." While these
songs may lack the energy of the more upbeat
songs, they don't sacrifice any of the musical
talents of the band.
I.abrosse-King's debut album is a good
compilation of acoustic sounds, creating an
enjoyable but relaxing feeling. While they
probably won't turn into the next frat band
made-big like Hootie and the Blowfish, it's

good music to go listen to with some friends
if you just want to kick hack, relax and feel a
little groove.
