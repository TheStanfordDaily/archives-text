# CHINO XL
## Here to save you all 
### 
Every so often a rap album comes
along that restores my faith in the genre.
"Here to Save You All" is one of the finest
rap releases of the year, courtesy of Chino
XL's slick use of metaphors and powerful
delivery.

Chino XL delivers the
goods. The album starts off
strong with two tracks, "De
liver" and "No Complex,"
which showcase the rapper's
incredible flow. He pours
out lines like hot maple
syrup on pancakes. Chino
throws things together that
seemingly have no connec
tion. In "Deliver" he raps,
"Avoid battlin' me like I'm
Eazy-E's blood samples"
and on "No Complex" he
uses the line, "I'm hot like
Bob Marley's fingertips
from reefer burns." Some of
his imagery is awesome, and
it flows so effortlessly, like it
just drips out of his mouth
and covers the beat.
Chino often sounds
angry, but he finds a way to
channel his rage without
talking about guns and vio
lence. On "What Am I?",
one of the album's best
tracks, Chino talks frankly
about his multi-racial

background and the reaction he gets from
people, black and white, being light-skinned.
"What am 1? / I'm confused / Black or
White / can't decide" he raps in the chorus.
The song is so great because it is a subject not
often discussed in rap, and Chino pulls no
punches, angrily asserting his blackness
while at the same time rapping, "What I lack
in melanin /1 make up in adrenaline /my
mixed heritage I'm cherish in.' "
Unfortunately, the only thing that drags
the album down is the sometimes muddled
and uninspired production. On bass
heavy, slow-down tracks like "Waiting to
Exhale" and "Many Different Ways" the
beat just can't do justice to Chinos raps
and so the songs sound like they should be
short interludes. The beats start to sound
rather similar and so by the end I felt like I
was listening to one very long song. But it
was a great song.
