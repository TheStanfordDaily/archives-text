## VARIOUS ARTISTS Twister Soundtrack VARIOUS ARTISTS I shot Andy Warhol Soundtrack 
### 
The "Twister" soundtrack fails in precise
ly the way that most motion picture sound
tracks fail — it consciously strives lor some
broad sort of cohesion that never comes. Ap
parently, the soundtrack's producers thought
they could piece the albums 14 songs togeth
er with the film's midwestern, tornado
strewn landscape — resulting in a lot of ref
erences to wind, a lot of yee-haw-cowboy
musical moments for the old folks and a lot of
faux-nietal big guitars and schnazzy produc
tion for the young ones.
And, like a big-ass tornado haphazardly
whipping its way through the heartland, the
whole thing sucks. Boring songs by Belly and
Soul Asylum stand out in juxtaposition with
schlock like Lisa Loeb's grating "How" and
the Red Hot Chili Peppers' unfortunately
earnest lounge song, "Melancholy Mechan
ics." Meanwhile, Tori Amos' "Talula," a truly
decent song, suffers from a "tornado" remix
that adds little else than a Casio keyboard
backbeat and a breathy little intro where
Amos — dollar signs in her eyes — sighs
something about "chasing tornadoes."
If "Twister" is a perfect example ot trying
to cram unwanted subject matter into a col
lection of songs for the sake of evoking a
mood, then the soundtrack to "I Shot Andy
Warhol" is its exact opposite, effortlessly
melding together a concoction of classics,
covers and new material. There's no reason
the two Donovan covers (Luna's oddly urgent
"Season of the Witch," with its syncopated
bassline, and the glossy, tambourine shim
my-shake of Jewel's "Sunshine Superman")
found on the album should go so well with

the staggering, lethargic genius of Pavement's
"Sensitive Euro Man." Yet they do, the effect
bizarre, timeless.
A few tracks do jut out, however slightly.
Yo La Tengo's "Demons" tries so hard to be
mellow and brooding that eventually you re
alize it might just be boring; and Bettie
Serveert's hyper-speed version of "I'll Keep it
with Mine" (my favorite Dylan song) rips off
the opening guitar riff of the Cranberries'
"Linger" (but why?) and ends by basking in
gratuitous distortion.
Even if these songs were had, though —
which they aren't — it wouldn't really matter.
From Wilco doing Buffalo Springfield's
"Burn" and giving us two and a half minutes
of country rock bliss to REM's cover of the
Trogg's "Love is All Around" (updated to in
clude pop can fizz "ahhs" and "bababa" back
ing vocals), "I Shot Andy Warhol" is a rarity
among soundtrack albums — good music
that actually belongs together.
