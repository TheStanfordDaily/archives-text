# SOUL BOSSA TRIO
## 
### 
With the advent of swank pop groups like
Pizzicato 5, Cibo Matto and Super Junkey
Monkey, the Japanese music industry has
been watched closely of late. The latest new
comers, Soul Bossa Trio, releases its first and
disappointing bossa nova compilation in the
U.S. on San Francisco's Cubop-Übiquity
label. Mostly a tepid re-rendering of bossa
nova themes, Soul Bossa adds to the long list
of tawdry bossa nova rip-offs since this musi
cal genre's rise to popularity in the 19605.
When bossa nova emerged with figures
like Stan Getz and Antonio Carlos Jobim,
groups like Brazil '65, and movies such as
"Black Orpheus," this brand of Latin jazz
sought to repair the esoteric gap spawned by
the anarchic, free jazz movement. Bossa nova
established itself as a romantic, evocative
musical form whose fusion of Brazilian folk,
samba and bcebop moved, if not seduced, the
listener.
Since then, bossa nova has touched the
world of music in diverse directions — from
landmark recordings like that of Mingus'
"Boogie Bossa Nova" to abominable ere-

ations like "Bossa Nova Baby."
The music of Soul Bossa Trio
travels in the well-worn path of
cheesy bossa nova replications.
With three performers (acoustic
/ electric guitar, piano/electric
keyboard and drums), the most
obvious tlaw of Soul Bossa Trio
stems from its use of pro
grammed instrumentals and
vocals. While programmed ac
companiments are not inher
ently culpable, it goes without
saying that bossa nova sounds
better with live performers. In
the case of Soul Bossa Trio, the
group compromises musical
quality and ends up with a
bankrupt imitation of bossa
nova standards.
In a version of "Tin Tin
Deo," a tune perhaps cherish
able thanks to West Coast jazz
saxophonist Art Pepper, Soul
Bossa conjures up images of
hotel lounge madness or shop-

ping-mall culture. Done at a rel
atively slow pace, "Tin Tin Deo" lags unfor
givably. Suavity is turned up to the highest
notch possible — but with an embarrassing
seriousness that excludes any possibility of
playing with it.
The same uncomfortable suavity applies
to Soul Bossa's "A Holiday In South Zone
(Suadade de Rio)" which tries to mimic a
Booker T. and the MG's electric organ sound
without success. The synthesized claps and
the rolling conga which run along with the
deep vibrato of the electric organ lack the
swing to carry Soul Bossa beyond the level of
music programmers.
Soul Bossa elide the humor which even the
most popularized bossa nova improvisations
play up.
