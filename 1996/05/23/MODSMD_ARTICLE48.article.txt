# HUMMEL
## Piano Concertos 
### 
Hum m e 1
(1778-1837) was
an early Romantic
composer roughly
contemporary of
Beethoven and
Schubert. Along
with John Field,
he cast indelible
influence on the
music of Chopin
(especially his
Nocturnes) and
posterity. Though
quite a keyboard
virtuoso in his
heyday, Hummel
has almost com
pletely faded into
oblivion by now.
T his disc features
two of his piano
concertos, writ
ten in 1816 and
1819, respective
ly. Somehow the
reason why these
concertos are for-

gotten comcs clear after a few listening.
Though these concerto have great melod
ic appeals, one is struck by the conventional
ity of the music structure and layout. Both
concertos start with long, drawn-out orches
tral introductions that contain all subsequent
themes before the solo piano entry. The
piano writing is relentlessly virtuosic, de
manding rapid scale runs, arpeggios and
thirds. But the music suffers from its overt
predictability, with always one too many se
quences that separates the nobility in
Mozart's music from the banality in the
hands of Hummel.
There are certainly moments of great ten
sion and powerful orchestral tutti, but the
harmonic language remains conservative.
One can hear remnants of Mozart and
Beethoven intermixed with prettified ro
mantic melodies. Hummel's concertos share
with Chopin's two the youthful longings and
romantic sweep but lack the latter's freshness
and harmonic daring.
Frankfurt-trained pianist Hae-won
Chang offers solid playing, jumping hurdles
of incessant notes with considerable security,
but lacks a sense of humor and rhythmical vi
tality in the Rondo movements. One wishes
she would use some rubato to bring out the
inherent charm and to dispel the repetitive
ness of the music. Conductor Tamas Pal of
fers steady but pedestrian orchestral support,
dutifully aiding the pianist to let her tone
shine through.
Naxos Label deserves credit for record
ing a rare repertoire that other major
brands sneer at. Along with their low
pricing marketing ($5.99 per CD at
Tower), Naxos is doing well at targeting an
audience that is either budget-minded or
curious-minded, or both. For those in
quisitive enough to pry into concerto lit
erature in the early 19th century, this
Hummel disc offers delightful tunes well
suited for easy listening. For those insist
ing on more musically "profound" listen
ing, I am afraid Ill again have to refer you
to the much-beaten and generic piano
concertos by Chopin, Schumann and
Brahms.
