## Heaven's Prisoners 
### 
Alec Baldwin is having a difficult time find
ing quality scripts. The husky-voiced actor has
made some excellent movies in the past, includ
ing a powerful role in the critically acclaimed
"Glengarry Glen Ross," but his recent outings
have been less than stellar. "Malice" and"The
Shadow" were abysmal and"The Juror" flopped
at the box-office.
"Heaven's Prisoners," a formula thriller with
out the thrills, will do nothing to repair his image.
The story takes place in Louisiana, which
means that everybody gets to use a faux bayou
accent and says things like, "I'm gon' fin' you
padner." Baldwin plays Dave Robicheaux, a for
mer cop and recovering alcoholic who just can't
ignore his police instincts. While out sailing
with his wife (Kelly Lynch), Robicheaux wit
nesses a plane crash and saves a young Hi Sa I -
vadoran girl from the wreckage. After that,
there's too much plot and lots of confusion.
It turns out that somebody crashed the plane
and Robicheaux decides to investigate the mat
ter. Unfortunately, he gets in too deep. Some bad
guys kill his wife, so of course he seeks revenge
and uncovers a massive drug operation which
may lead to his childhood friend-turned-crimi
nal Bubba Rocque (played convincingly by a
steel-faced I'ric Roberts).
There is more to it than that, but it really
doesn't matter. The movie is boring and slower
than a crippled snail. "Heaven's Prisoners'' drags
on for 132 minutes, with absolutely no excite
ment and no endearing qualities. The bad guys
are greasy-haired idiots who tell Robicheaux
their whereabouts so he can kill them. Teri
Hatcher ("Lois and Clark") plays Bubba
Rocque's wife, Claudette, a seductress who hides
her inability to act by showing everyone her
cleavage and standing naked on her balcony.
None of the characters are gripping, they all just
seem to be trying too hard to say their lines
without slipping out ot their annoying accents.
This is the most tediously dull movie I have
seen in a long time. By the end of the flick I just
didn't care about the story to even try to deci
pher the convoluted plot.
If this movie had just stuck to being an ac
tion-thriller, it may have been watchable, but in
stead it's burdened with a lazy script, pointless
scenes and characters, and pitiful attempts at
drama.
