### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Former Polish president and
Nobel Laureate Lech Walesa will
share his thoughts on his coun
try's prospects for democracy in a
speech at Stanford next Friday.
Walesa, Poland's first post
communist leader, will speak at
noon May 31 at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
His speech will be titled "The
Present and Future of Democracy
in Poland" and will be delivered
through an interpreter. It is one in
a series of talks he is giving in the
United States and Great Britain.
"We're delighted to have some
one of his stature," said Assoc.
History Prof. Nancy Kollmann, di
rector of the Center for Russian
and East European Studies,
adding that Walesa "is said to be
an excellent speaker."
"Hopefully, he will talk about
the transition to democracy in
Poland," said History Prof. Nor
man Naimark.
Naimark added it would be
"very interesting to see how he
evaluates the government since
the election," referring to the 1995
contest in which Walesa lost his

re-election bid to Aleksander
Kwasniewski, a former commu
nist.
Naimark said Walesa's rela
tions with the new government
since then have been extremely
unfriendly.
Another question Naimark ex
pects Walesa to address will be
whether and how Poland should
join the European Union or
NATO. Naimark said both Walesa
and Kwasniewski have strongly
favored such integration.
Kollmann also said Walesa may
have plans to found a "research
center" on the emergence cf
democracy in Poland, and if so he
will likely speak about it next
week.
In addition to giving the speech,
Walesa may take time to visit the
archives of Hoover Institution,
Naimark said.
"The Hoover archives are fan
tastic on Poland," Naimark said,
adding that the collection of mate
rial on Poland during World War
II is "unique." He specifically
mentioned documents on the Pol
ish resistance and the wartime
govern men t-in -exile.
Walesa won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1983 for his leadership of
Solidarity, a trade union that led
the successful resistance to the

communist government in Poland.
Although Walesa has no per
sonal connection with the Univer
sity, Kollmann said Stanford's
strong program in East European
studies makes it a natural venue
for his speech. The center is one of
a very few federally recognized
centers of its kind in the country

and Stanford maintained an over
seas campus in Cracow, Poland,
until 1991.
Walesa appears as a guest of the
Center for Russian and East Euro
pean Studies, the Institute for In
ternational Studies, Stanford-in-
Government and Hoover Institu
tion.
