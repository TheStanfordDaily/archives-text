# I Shot Andy Warhol
## 
### 
"1 Shot Andy Warhol" is not a whodunit;
even the title reveals the killer.
The suspense in this artfully crafted film
by director-screenwriter Mary Harron is the
burning question: what makes someone
shoot a celebrity?
Having deservedly won the Grand Jury
prize at the Sundance Film Festival, the
movie is a must-see for Warhol buffs and
Factory virgins alike.
Lili Taylor stars as Valerie Solanas, the in
telligent radical feminist and founder of
SCUM (the Society for Cutting Up Men).
Taylor plays Solanas as funny, sardonic and
more than a little deranged, as we witness
her descent from homeless panhandler to

prostitute to assassin. Standing on a street
corner, Solanas offers to say a dirty word for
10 cents: "Men."
Surrounding Taylor is a superlative
supporting cast including Stephen Dorff
as drag queen Candy Darling. Jared Har
ris, who assumes the role of Andy
Warhol, provides a performance that is
almost frightening to watch. Martha
Plimpton rounds out the cast in a throw
away role as Solanas' "butch-dyke" friend
Stevie.
When Warhol won't produce Solanas'
play, her grip on reality becomes increasingly
slippery. Throughout, she maintains an iron
ic sense of humor. "Arc you a member of a
revolutionary organization?" asks one mem
ber of the press. "Yeah," Solanas answers, "my
own."
Other sources of humor include director
Harron's use of the camera to create a sense of

irony. Parting from most cliched views of the
Warhol Factory (see: "The Doors") which
seem to find it so inexplicable that the only
way the audience can experience the Factory
scene is if the director simulates an acid trip
while filming, Harron's camera holds still so
that we can get a good look at the fabulous
surroundings. The Warhol gang is exposed
for what it really was, a self-selecting elitist
group of pseudo-artists.
Kudos to Harron for penning a screen
play which under instead of overstates the
sad alienation from society that all these
characters experience. Solanas' rejection
from this last potential society of misfits is
perhaps the last straw for her fragile psy
che.
"Yeah, I shot Andy Warhol," she tells a sea
of video cameras. "He had too much control
over my life."
