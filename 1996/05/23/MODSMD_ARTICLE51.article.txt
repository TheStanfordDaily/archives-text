## Once Upon A Time... When We Were Colored 
### 
When an honest and well-crafted film
comes along (it's rare, hut sometimes it hap
pens), it should be seen far and wide. Such a
film has finally arrived.
"Once Upon A Time ... When We Were
Colored" is a beautiful movie that weaves
hope and reality together so finely that it's
impossible to make a distinction between the
two. The film presents honest portrayals of
.ill aspects of life involved.
This film, directed and produced by sit

com star I im Reid, is about a boy growing up
in the Mississippi Delta from 1946 to 1962. It
may seem that there is nothing phenomenal
about another coming-of-age story, but
those were remarkable times for the whole
nation.
It may be hard for us to imagine anything
like the era presented to us on the screen, an
era when men cannot be men because of Jim
Crow laws, when the only identities people
have are the ones given and prescribed to
them and not the ones they create.
I his movie is not a cry against injustices,
though. It's not a militant rally nor is it a plea
ol the cliched rant, "can't we just all get
along?!?" "Once Upon A Time ... When We
Were (Colored" celebrates humanity. It shows

the two different worlds and two different
frames of minds that have co-existed in our
nation since its inception. It shows how both
the black and white races deal with this dual
ity. This movie has risen above finger point
ing. There are no heroes or villains here.
The movie's narrative is driven by Jim
Crow injustices but the movie does not whol
ly blame the people involved. More of the re
sponsibility is placed on the system that cre
ated such laws. The movie stresses t he need to
break down such a system.
The film is compelling and there are many
wonderful and poignant scenes that are won
derfully acted by an all-star cast featuring
Phylicia Rashad (you'll never see her as Clair
Huxtable again), Saili Richardson ("Posse,"

"Great White Hype"), Leon ("Waiting to Ex
hale"), Anna Maria Horsford ("Amen") and
Isaac Hayes ("Shaft").
In terms of composition, Tim Reid's work
resembles "Daughters of the Dust" in its cin
ematography and realistic depiction of Black
skin color. It's also reminiscent of "The Color
Purple" in its slow, almost lazy linear narra
tive.
"Once Upon A Time .. .When We Were
Colored" honestly features Black America.
The film emphasizes notions of the extended
family in the Black collective, a community
linked by experience and survival — if not by
direct blood.
Go see it.
