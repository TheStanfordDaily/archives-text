# Flipper
## 
### 
Go Flipper!
Yes, I found myself silently cheering
for the cute dolphin star of "Flipper"
even feeling a slight surge of childhood
nostalgia — even though I haven't seen
either the original Flipper movies or the
'60s TV show.
It's probably because Willy, that life
saving whale of the "Free Willy" movies
which I ashamedly admit to having seen,
is a complete rip-off of the "Flipper"
genre: a boy with family problems learns
lessons about life from a friendly sea
mammal who's separated from its own
family.
Refraining from pushing the family
values theme too hard, "Flipper" pulls it
off better.
Flipper and his aquatic family mem
bers are definitely the true stars of this
flick. The National Geographic-like
footage of frolicking dolphins leaping
beautifully in the air during the opening
credits and their exciting mob assault on
Scar, the evil shark, leave you wanting
more dolphin action. After all, Flipper is
the hero who finds the toxic waste (the
environmental crisis plot device neces
sary to kids' flicks these days). He even
films the evidence with his "Flip-o-cam."
(What a stud!)
Unfortunately however, the audience is
forced to watch humans for the majority of
the movie.
Elijah Wood ("The War," "The Good
Son") plays Sandy, a young teenager sent to
live with his uncle on an island off the
Florida coast for the summer after his par
ents' divorce. Wood makes the best of his
bummed and bored character whose
biggest goal for the summer is seeing a
Chili Peppers concert.
Paul Hogan (in his best movie role since
the first "Crocodile Dundee") plays
Sandy's uncle, Porter Ricks, a fisher
man obsessed with the Beach Boys who
water skis with a cigar in his mouth and
lives off of Spaghetti-Os. He's the em
bodiment of both class and beach
bum-hood — in one scene he compli
ments Martha Stewart for her "fishnet
curtains" decorating tip. Resembling the
young Kirk Douglas in "20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea" with leathery tan skin and
a surprisingly buff body, Hogan plays the

gruff Porter with humor and charm (and
with some help from his belching and
snoring pelican side-kick). But he some
times ruins the fun with surprisingly stern
and mean moments.
Of course, each of the male characters
have romantic interests but, quite thank

fully, the movie avoids any potential sappi
ness.
While the humans are having fun, due in
part to Flipper's matchmaking, Flipper
languishes on the beach after being poi
soned by toxic dumping or hangs around
looking for sympathy after being shot at.

The humans, preoccupied with relation
ships, tend to forget about their finned
hero until it's almost too late.
"Flipper" is a pretty decent kids movie,
but I'm waiting for Flipper to star in his
own action flick.
