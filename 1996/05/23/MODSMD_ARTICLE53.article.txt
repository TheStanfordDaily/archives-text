## Soren Johnson Clapton's Heart of Darkness 
### 
I am an anti-Christ!" spewed Johnny Rot
ten on the infamous Sex Pistols' track
"Anarchy in the U.K.," starting what has
become a long and proud tradition ot punk
rock shocking its audience.
Indeed, shock-rock has seen a remark
able number of perspectives as it has be
come institutionalized over the years, from
the comic (Alice Cooper), to the intellectual
(Patti Smith) to the genuinely depraved
(Iggy Pop). Nevertheless, the question
which begs to be asked is whether shock
rock is truly frightening or not.
Obviously, its comic incarnation is little
more than a winking in-joke. Anyone who
actually felt threatened by Kiss' make-up
has some serious problems differentiating
between fantasy and reality. As for intellec
tual shockers, their work proved far tot)
studied to truly frighten any listener who
scratched more than surface deep.
Thus, only the most savage and nihilistic
groups seemed to possess the ability to in
still actual fear within its audience, but this
fear could be explained away far too easily.
These punks had no place within normal
society, and whether one wanted to call
them "socially degenerate" or not, they
could be seen as aberrations. The common
ground a member of the English middle
class shared with Sid Vicious, based upon
his own humanity if nothing else, became
too easy to ignore.
No, the art which has the best chance of
frightening its audience invariably has to

come from the "mainstream," from firmly
within the boundaries of acceptable entertain
ment. Because these artists could not be mere
ly explained away as social anomalies, the lis
tener is forced to confront their pain, anger
and darkness directly. 1 hese artists explore t he
very boundaries of human emotions as they
find themselves spiralingover the edge.
Truth fully, however, most performers
never come close to these kind of revelation.
The Rolling Stones always held themselves
at a safe, ironic distance from the brink. The
Beatles only approached it with the painful
"Let It Be" album and Lennon's cathartic
solo album, "Plastic Ono Band." Bruce
Springsteen came close with "Darkness on
the Edge of Town," but the most poignant
example of such despair found on a popular
recording is undoubtedly Eric Clapton's
masterpiece, recorded under the name of
Derek and the Dominoes, "Layla and Other
Assorted Love Songs."
The pain behind "Layla" is an oft-told
story, involving a love triangle between
Clapton, his best friend, George Harrison of
the Beatles, and Pattie Boyd, Harrison's
wife. The pain of Boyd's return to Harrison
after an affair with Clapton produced this
gorgeous album, and on tracks like "Why
I)oes Love Got to be so Sad," "It's Too Late"
and "Keys to the Highway," this pain is read
ily apparent.
The ultimate moment, however, is the
monumental title track, "layla." The
scorching guitar and anguished vocals are as

startling as they are frightful. As rock histo
rian Dave Marsh once stated, Clapton
"reached so deeply into himself that the ef
fect of hearing [itj is akin to witnessing a
murder or a suicide."
The song laments, "Let's make the best of
the situation / Before I finally go
insane / Please don't say we'll never find a
way / Or tell me all my love's in vain." This
thinly veiled reference to blues legend
Robert Johnson's classic song "Love in
Vain," helps emphasize Clapton's awareness
that he has stepped over the edge.
Johnson's legend is inevitably wrapped in
mystery and darkness. An unremarkable
guitarist, Johnson disappeared for a year
and returned as perhaps the greatest non
electric blues guitarist the world has ever
seen. Rumors of a deal with the devil, as well
as a mysterious death by poisoning, have
only added power to Johnson's legend.
However, Clapton's despair is paralleled by
Johnson's own pain. In the words of rock
critic David McCee, " There is in | Johnson's]
lyrics a desperation and sense of moment
that can transport the listener into the deep
heart of Johnson's darkness."
Indeed, Clapton's vision actually paral
lels the emotional realization and personal
torment the Polish-English writer Joseph
Conrad described in his scathing novella
Heart of Darkness, another example of an
artistic work which steps over the edge.
Conrad saw the hole at the heart of civilized
man, embodied through Kurtz, the Euro

pean turned savage, and Clapton too had
come to recognize the heart of darkness
beating within himself. Forced to recognize
that, in his own words, "being Derek was a
cover for the tact that I was trying to steal
someone else's wife," and that this someone
else was in fact his best friend, Clapton knew
the anguish and despair of a hopeless situa
tion. And for the first half of "Layla," the
pain is all too evident.
However, in a sly and understated man
ner, Clapton's work does pull back from the
brink. Just as Conrad's protagonist, Marlow,
eventually lies to Kurtz about the essential
depravity of the human soul, Clapton too
lies about his own hopelessness. Halfway
through "Layla," |im Gordon's profound
and elegant piano takes over, and the song is
finished with a mysterious sense of redemp
tion. Clapton, however, spent the next year
in virtual isolation, fighting a painful hero
in addiction. For some unknown reason,
Clapton had felt compelled to retreat from
the edge and give his tempestuous lament a
peaceful, serene ending, regardless of the
depravity of his own condition.
Perhaps the truth is that an artist can only
be expected to stretch him or herself so far.
How can an artist be expected to plummet
over the edge, and then be able to maintain
any semblance of a "normal" life, one which
would allow us, their audience, to relate to
their work? In the words of Conrad's Mar
low, "It would have been too dark â€” too
dark altogether..."
