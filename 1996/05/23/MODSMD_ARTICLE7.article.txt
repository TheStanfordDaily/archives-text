# It ain't the '80s anymore!
## Footloose hacky sackers eye the next century 
### Dale Margolin Contributing writer 
Stanford Footbag is not like the hacky
sack you might have played in high school.
According to Stanford Footbag Club founder
Steve Goldberg, "Footbag involves dance,
gymnastic and soccer skills, and it empha
sizes endurance and muscle strength."
Established by Goldberg in 1987, the
Stanford Footbag Club now has approxi
mately 15 members who meet every Tues
day. This year, the club is hosting the 1996
Western Regional Championship, which
will take place this weekend.
Goldberg, who earned his doctorate in
computer science from Stanford and now
works for Apple Computer, said the West
ern Regionals is the second largest footbag
event in the world. The event will take
place over three days, with 100 competitors
of all levels and 1,200 spectators expected.

The tournament involves two types of
competition, said Goldberg: freestyle and
net play. Freestyle is a complicated form of
play, which most spectators do not under
stand, said Goldberg.
"But it is still really fun to watch. Jaws
drop at the athleticism and grace of the
routines," he said. On the other hand, net
play is "more of a spectator sport," said
Goldberg, because it is easy for spectators
to follow the action.
Players from across the United States
and Canada will attend this year's Western
Regionals, said Goldberg. Although many
of the top players from around the world
will be there, novices are also invited. Any
one age 15 or older is urged to come out and
attend teaching workshops throughout the
weekend. Goldberg said the tournament
will be shown on ESPN2, Sports Channel

and a local news station.
The Stanford Footbag Club
was chosen to host the event be
cause of its prominence in the
sport. The club was the second col
lege footbag organization founded
in the United States, said Gold
berg. The first club was at UC-
Berkeley, where Goldberg used to
play before he organized the Stan
ford club in 1987.
Goldberg graduated from
Georgia Tech and came out to Cal
ifornia partly because he wanted
to get better at footbag. "The West
really dominates the sport," he
said.
For many years, the club had
two or three consistent members,
but this year participation has in
creased tremendously. "This year,
we have had about six members
who come every week and about
15 all together, which is much bet
ter than any other year," said co
president Ben Gallant, a sopho
more.
Gallant said he started playing
with the club in the fall of his

freshman year, although he had
played hacky sack in high school in
Washington, D.C.
"It was nothing like the footbag
we play here," Gallant said of his
high school experience. Footbag is
an intense and highly skilled
sport, whereas hacky sack is a ca
sual hobby, he said.
Although footbag is a highly
skilled sport, the Stanford club in
vites people of all levels to partici
pate.
"The club is extremely inclu
sive," said Goldberg. "It doesn't
matter what your skill level is. We
love teaching people." Although
he completed his studies last year,
Goldberg still comes every Tues
day to the meetings and enjoys
teaching new members and im
proving his own skills.
Visitors also often show up at
the Tuesday practices. Some of
these visitors include well-known
players from the area, including
Carol Wedemeyer, one of the top
women in the world, who played
with the club earlier this quarter,
said Goldberg.
The noticeably wide range of
skills at the meetings helps every
one improve, said Goldberg.
Vandy Johnson, a sophomore,

started playing last year. Shj& ac
companied a friend to a meeting
and immediately enjoyed the ath
leticism of footbag and the social
atmosphere. Music is played at
every session, and"it is a lot of
fun," said Johnson. This quar
ter, she has come almost oVery
week and has noticed that her
skills have greatly improved, she
said.
Footbag is becoming more pop
ular across the country, especially
on college campuses, said Gold
berg. Footbag clubs modeled after
Stanford's have recently been
founded at Cornell University,
University of Pennsylvania and
University of Florida, Goldberg
said.
The Stanford Footbag Club
has become better-known
through its World Wide Web page,
located at http://gregorio.stan
ford.edu/footbag/footbag.html.
The club was the first in the na
tion to have its own Web page, and
this has helped familiarize people
with the sport and encouraged
them to play or start their own
clubs, said Gallant.
"I get e-mail from people all the
time saying that they need help or
ganizing a club,"he said.
