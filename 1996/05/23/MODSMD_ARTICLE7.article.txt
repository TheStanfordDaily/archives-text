# It ain't the '80s anymore!
## Footloose hacky sackers eye the next century 
### Dale Margolin Contributing writer 
Stanford Footbag is not like the hacky
sack you might have played in high school.
According to Stanford Footbag Club founder
Steve Goldberg, "Footbag involves dance,
gymnastic and soccer skills, and it empha
sizes endurance and muscle strength."
Established by Goldberg in 1987, the
Stanford Footbag Club now has approxi
mately 15 members who meet every Tues
day. This year, the club is hosting the 1996
Western Regional Championship, which
will take place this weekend.
Goldberg, who earned his doctorate in
computer science from Stanford and now
works for Apple Computer, said the West
ern Regionals is the second largest footbag
event in the world. The event will take
place over three days, with 100 competitors
of all levels and 1,200 spectators expected.

The tournament involves two types of
competition, said Goldberg: freestyle and
net play. Freestyle is a complicated form of
play, which most spectators do not under
stand, said Goldberg.
"But it is still really fun to watch. Jaws
drop at the athleticism and grace of the
routines," he said. On the other hand, net
play is "more of a spectator sport," said
Goldberg, because it is easy for spectators
to follow the action.
Players from across the United States
and Canada will attend this year's Western
Regionals, said Goldberg. Although many
of the top players from around the world
will be there, novices are also invited. Any
one age 15 or older is urged to come out and
attend teaching workshops throughout the
weekend. Goldberg said the tournament
will be shown on ESPN2, Sports Channel
