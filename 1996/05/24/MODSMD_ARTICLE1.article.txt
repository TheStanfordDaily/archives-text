# Krugman leaving Stanford for MIT
## Economist cites 'personal' reasons 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Paul Krugman, one of the
world's leading economists, is leav
ing Stanford after two years to re
turn to MIT, where he was a profes
sor for 14 years before coming to the
Farm.
Krugman said he was leaving
"somewhat sadly," and that his rea
sons were "basically personal." He
said his position at MIT would be
comparable to the post he held here.
"I'm moving from one great eco
nomics department to another," he
said.
Krugman, 43, is currently a pro
fessor of economics and a senior fel
low at the Institute for Internation
al Studies.

Economics Department Chair
David Starrett said Krugman's
most well-known work has been on
the competitiveness of the U.S.
economy in the world market.
Aside from his outstanding
teaching, Starrett said, Krugman's
scholarship has become very popu
lar and has gained him "outside vis
ibility."
Krugman is a frequent contribu
tor to major publications such as
The New York Times and Foreign
Affairs.
"All the work that he's done re
flects well on us," Starrett said.
Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven said
he was sad to see Krutrman leave.
He called him "a star of the first
magnitude."
"[Krugman's leaving] is a blow,"
Shoven said. "We did our best to
keep him."
In his articles and in several
books, including a collection of es
says titled "Pop Internationalism,"
Krugman has criticized what he
identifies as the popular view of in
ternational trade as a process of
conflict and competitiveness.
Krugman is a strong proponent

of global free trade and holds that
trade relations between countries
can frequently be beneficial to all
the parties.
Krugman said he will not leave
Stanford until the end of fall quar
ter because, he said, he had previ
ously committed to teaching cours
es that quarter.
"I will be doing the teaching I
promised to do," Krugman said.
Krugman also said he does not
anticipate staying on at Stanford as
a visiting scholar or returning in
the foreseeable future.
"I came to Stanford with every
intention of staying, and I am doing
the same [at MIT]," Krugman said.
