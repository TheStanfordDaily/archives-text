# Krugman leaving Stanford for MIT
## Economist cites 'personal' reasons 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
Paul Krugman, one of the
world's leading economists, is leav
ing Stanford after two years to re
turn to MIT, where he was a profes
sor for 14 years before coming to the
Farm.
Krugman said he was leaving
"somewhat sadly," and that his rea
sons were "basically personal." He
said his position at MIT would be
comparable to the post he held here.
"I'm moving from one great eco
nomics department to another," he
said.
Krugman, 43, is currently a pro
fessor of economics and a senior fel
low at the Institute for Internation
al Studies.

Economics Department Chair
David Starrett said Krugman's
most well-known work has been on
the competitiveness of the U.S.
economy in the world market.
Aside from his outstanding
teaching, Starrett said, Krugman's
scholarship has become very popu
lar and has gained him "outside vis
ibility."
Krugman is a frequent contribu
tor to major publications such as
The New York Times and Foreign
Affairs.
"All the work that he's done re
flects well on us," Starrett said.
Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven said
he was sad to see Krutrman leave.
