# Protest barricade blocks History Corner
## Disabled-rights supporters say University needs to improve accessibility of facilities 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
Students advocating rights for
the disabled community built a
barricade on the steps of the
northeast corner of the History
building late Wednesday night,
disorienting some students on
their way to class yesterday.
The structure was made of
cloth and wood and bore slogans
declaring, for instance, "Equal ac
cess for all students" and "Why
are all the ramps in the back of the
building?"
Students wrapped police-line
tape around the blockade and
painted large wheelchair-access
signs on the cloth. The structure
had been torn down by noon yes
terday, although it is unclear by
whom.
The barricade did not block the
steps completely, but it was locked
to the handrails and could not be
removed easily.
Members of Disabled Students
of Stanford hosted a disabilities
awareness Tuesday during which
they collected more than 100 sig
natures on a petition for a new
community center on campus.
The current center, located in the
Meyer Library building, will be
converted to office space next year
as the result of a federal mandate.
Disabled Students of Stanford
was not responsible for the barri
cade, however, according to
sophomore Lisa Connor, a leader
of the group.
"This was a group of individual

students who decided they wanted
to make a statement about access,
to display visually that this en
trance isn't accessible," Connor
said. "It was not an organized ac
tion."
A student who claimed to have
been involved in building the bar
ricade agreed to speak to The
Daily on condition of anonymity.
She confirmed that the activity
was not organized by Disabled
Students of Stanford.
She said that although disabled
students meet often with the ad
ministration and students are
doing "everything we can through
formal channels," a need for visi
ble activism remains.
"Other students don't under
stand," she said. "For a student
who is blind, signs explaining the
construction that is blocking an
entryway doesn't help much," she
said.
"Even Memorial Church is
only accessible when someone you
are with can go inside and open a
locked door for you," she said.
The student added that if
nondisabled students thought the
barricade was annoying, they
should "try to get around campus
if you are blind, deaf or in a wheel
chair."
Although the action did not
have the official support of Dis
abled Students of Stanford, senior
Bliss Temple, who is a leader in
the group, said she is glad "atten
tion is being paid to the issues â€”
people should not be afraid to ex
press themselves in this way."

Protesting what they call insufficient access for members of the dis
abled community on campus, students constructed a wood and
cloth barricade on the stairs of History Corner late Wednesday. The
barrier was taken down by lunchtime yesterday.
