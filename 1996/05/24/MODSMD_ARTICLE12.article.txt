## Clinton and Dole clash over issue of abortion 
### 
MILWAUKEE (AP) - On a day of
fiery political combat, President Clinton
accused Sen. Bob Dole of trying to divide
Americans by attacking him on the emo
tional issue of abortion. "1 am always a
little skeptical when politicians piously
proclaim their morality," Clinton
declared yesterday.
Dole, the certain GOP presidential
nominee, began the unusually sharp
exchange of words by criticizing Clin
ton's veto of a bill banning certain late
term abortions. In a speech in Philadel
phia, Dole said Clinton's veto "pushed
the limits of decency too far."
Firing back, Clinton angrily jabbed
his fin tier in the air and demanded to

know what Dole would say to women
with severely deformed fetuses who feel
they have no choice but to undergo a so
called "partial-birth" abortion.
Clinton was in Milwaukee for talks
with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
but their joint news conference at mid
day was dominated by questions about
domestic issues and election-year poli
tics.
The two leaders later quenched their
legendary appetites over lunch at Miss
Katie's Diner. They feasted on barbe
cued chicken wings, short ribs, vegetable
soup with meatballs, steak, lemon chick
en, meat loaf, hash browns, green beans
and apple pie.
