# House raises minimum wage
## Election-year legislation increases pay by 90 cents an hour 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” In a striking
triumph for President Clinton and the
Democrats, the House approved elec
tion-year legislation yesterday to raise
the minimum wage by 90 cents an hour.
The 281-144 vote came after a
sharply divided House rejected a pro
posal by Republican leaders to exempt
millions of workers from federal wage
and overtime laws.
"The House worked its will and
America will get a raise," exulted Rep.
Jack Quinn of New York, the most out
spoken in a group of moderate Republi
cans who defied their leaders in sup
porting the increase.
House approval of the measure sets
the stage for Senate action after law
makers return from next week's Memo
rial Day break.
Clinton, on a visit to Milwaukee,
challenged Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole to bring the issue to a Senate vote
before he leaves office next month to
focus on the presidential election. "That
is the way to honor our values of work,
family, opportunity and responsibility,"
Clinton said.
The legislation provides for a 50-
cent-an-hour increase in the current

$4.25-an-hour minimum wage, effective
on July 1. A second, 40-cent increase
would take effect a year later. The bill
also includes a series of small business
tax breaks that Republicans crafted to
offset the impact of the higher wage on
employers.
In debate that spilled over two days
in a deeply polarized House, Democrats
and moderate Republicans said a mini
mum wage increase was simple fairness.
"The people who cook our meals and
sweep our floors and work in our child
care centers in this country deserve a
raise," said Rep. Robert Andrews, D-
N.J. "If you want Mom off welfare,
make the job worth going to," added
Democratic Rep. Pat Williams of Mon
tana.
But many Republicans said raising
the minimum wage would cost jobs, par
ticularly for disadvantaged workers who
tend to hold low-paying positions.
"There's a hate passion from the
(Democrats) in relationship to business
and a tremendous hate passion in rela
tionship to small businesses," said Rep.
William Goodling, R-Pa. "Well it is
those small businesses that are going to
create the jobs in this country."

The vote was a rare triumph for
Democrats, who lost their House major
ity in the 1994 elections and showed
uncommon unity this spring in pursu
ing the minimum wage increase. For his
part, Clinton threatened a veto of the
bill on Wednesday if Republicans suc
ceeded in attaching their proposed
exemptions for firms with annual
incomes of $500,000 or less.
Election-year politics played a role in
the debate, as well, as Clinton chal
lenged Dole, the GOP presidential nom
inee-in-waiting, to join him in opposing
the exemptions. And Rep. Martin Frost,
chairman of the Democratic campaign
committee in the House, said the day's
action marked a "defining moment in
this election."
The vote was also a setback for the
GOP leadership, which attacked the
proposal as a Democratic payoff to orga
nized labor and at first refused to sched
ule a floor vote. Confronted with the
rebellion by moderate Republicans, they
eventually relented. But they masked
their surrender with several provisions
to reduce the sting for small businesses,
who are among the GOP's strongest
political supporters.
