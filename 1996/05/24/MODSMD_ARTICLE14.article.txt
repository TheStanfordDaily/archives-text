# Tobacco industry wins big in court
## 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) - In a huge
victory for the tobacco industry, a feder
al appeals court yesterday rejected a
class-action liability suit brought
against cigarette manufacturers on
behalf of millions of smokers across the
country.
A three-judge panel of the sth U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously
agreed with industry arguments that a
case of such magnitude would be too
unwieldy.
The lawsuit had the potential to be
the biggest class-action case in history,
embracing practically anyone who
claimed to be hooked on cigarettes and
exposing the tobacco industry to billions
of dollars in claims.
It accuses the industry of concealing

knowledge that nicotine is addictive and
manipulating nicotine levels to keep
smokers hooked.
Under the appeals court ruling, the
case can still go forward as a lawsuit on
behalf of the original plaintiffs â€” three
smokers and Dianne Castano, whose
husband died of lung cancer.
The lawsuit was filed in 1994 against
the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Ameri
can Tobacco Co., Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corp., Philip Morris USA,
Lorillard Corp., United States Tobacco,
the Liggett Group and the industry's
lobbying arm, the Tobacco Institute.
Liggett, the smallest of the nation's
major tobacco companies, broke ranks
in March and agreed to settle, pledging
to dedicate some of its profits over 25

years to pay for stop-smoking programs.
However, Liggett reserved the right to
back out of the deal if the class-action
was nullified.
In a statement, Brown & Williamson
hailed the ruling as "a strong message
to class-action plaintiffs' lawyers to stop
the insanity in our nation's courts."
The plaintiffs' attorneys said they
haven't decided whether to appeal but
they plan to file numerous class-action
lawsuits in state courts to keep the pres
sure on the industry.
"If anything, the process is going to
move ahead aggressively and become
increasingly challenging for the tobacco
defendants, because they'll have more
fronts to fight," attorney Cliff Douglas
said.
