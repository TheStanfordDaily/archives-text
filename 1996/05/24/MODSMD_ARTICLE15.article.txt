# Arrests made in gun smuggling ring
## Officials seize 2,000 rifles made by two state-owned Chinese companies 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Heighten
ing tensions between the United States
and China, federal authorities seized
2,000 AK-47 assault rifles made by two
state-owned Chinese companies and
charged a top Chinese arms official.
All told, 14 people were charged and
seven arrested, federal prosecutors said
yesterday. Top officials of the companies
participated in the smuggling operation,
they said.
Among one company's top execu
tives: Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's
son-in-law, though neither he nor any
one else from his company was charged.
"Involvement of the Chinese govern
ment is under investigation," said San
Francisco-based U.S. Attorney Michael
Yamaguchi.
Along with the automatic rifles, the
Chinese arms dealers had proposed
shipping far more sophisticated
weapons to the United States, said
Wayne Yamashita of the U.S. Customs
Service.
"Weapons such as hand-held rocket
launchers, anti-aircraft missiles,
silenced machine guns and even tanks,"
he said.

The Beijing-based Chinese compa
nies were identified as the China North
ern Industrial Corp. (aka Norinco) and
Poly Technologies, a related company
that makes weapons for the Chinese
military.
Among those charged in a federal
complaint unsealed yesterday was Lu Yi
Lun, second-in-command of Norinco.
His boss, Fnu Zhang, the head of Norin
co, sent him to negotiate the deal, but
was not charged, the complaint said.
The companies tried to disguise the
weapons' origin, listing them as "hand
tools" and shipping them through
Japan and Hong Kong.
"The weapons were to have all Chi
nese markings removed, and North
Korean markings stamped on ... to fur
ther establish plausible deniability," the
complaint said.
Smuggling-ring members had erased
the serial numbers and converted the
weapons to illegal, fully automatic rifles
before the sale. The weapons had an
estimated street value of $4 million.
The Beijing-based Chinese companies
were identified as the China Northern
Industrial Corp. (aka Norinco) and Poly

Technologies, a related company that
makes weapons for the Chinese military.
The sale of the weapons — which
Chinese officials apparently thought
were going to U.S. street gangs — was
targeted as part of a 16-month sting
called Dragon Fire that was conducted
by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms and the Customs Service.
"Automatic assault weapons repre
sent a grave and serious threat to our
public safety and the security of our
country," Yamaguchi said. "They are
often the choice of street gangs."
He refused to say if the same group
was responsible for previous successful
shipments.
More than 90 federal agents seized
the weapons and made the arrests
Wednesday night in the San Francisco
Bay area.
Norinco and Poly Technologies are
two of China's biggest arms traders,
although in the past few years they have
tried to diversify into other areas of
industry and commerce. Both have
strong ties to the military and political
leadership; Poly Technologies' presi
dent is He Ping, Deng's son-in-law.
