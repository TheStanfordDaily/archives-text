University classrooms
must stay locations for
learning, not selling

CLASSROOMS ARE A place
where, in the name of edu
cation, all ideas should be
freely expressed. But there are
some kinds of expression that
have no place in the academic
environment. Increasing num
bers of commercial fliers advertis
ing credit cards, travel discounts
and magazine deals are invading
bulletin boards across campus;
they threaten to turn classrooms
into Times Square-esque havens
of marketing excess.
While having to stare at a few
posters may not be a dramatic
problem (and may sometimes be
a welcome diversion to less-than
entranced students), advertise
ments are not appropriate wall
decorations for Stanford's class
rooms. Ideally, classrooms should
be calm, isolated islands where
groups can focus on the matter at
hand — which, usually, is learn
ing and not European sojourns
(unless as field trips).
These advertisers pay no
money to use the space, but
instead assume that because
classrooms are relatively open
places they can simply post wher
ever they please. Clearly there is
a place within University build
ings for fliers and postings serv
ing an educational purpose such
as those advertising speakers,
cultural events and programs.
However, it is inappropriate for
classroom bulletin board space to
be taken up by advertisements
that use classrooms as a means to
reach a particularly desirable
demographic: affluent Stanford
students.
Advertisers do enjoy the same
freedom of speech that is accord
ed by the First Amendment to
other forms of expression,

except in cases where the adver
tising is misleading. Precedent
has also established that this
right is not forfeited when step
ping onto private property. How
ever, the right of advertisers to
post on campus is limited to pub
lic areas, and not private rooms
such as is the case with class
rooms. It is fine for advertise
ments to be posted in the public
halls of buildings on bulletin
boards specifically set aside for
open use. However, when these
advertisements make their way
into classrooms, they become a
troubling detraction from the
academic environment that
classrooms are created to
achieve.
Departmental policies vary
from building to building, but
administrators agree that the
growth in number of advertise
ments is disturbing. In the Politi
cal Science building, for example,
administrators clean off the bul
letin boards every other week,
but the ads relentlessly reappear.
Other departments do not have a
regular schedule for flier
removal, but say that as soon as
they clean out their buildings,
the fliers return nearly instanta
neously.
It must be made clear to these
advertisers that they are free to
post in public places, but cannot
use classrooms for their cam
paigns. In order to combat the
explosion of fliers, there must be
a clear policy statement made as
well as stepped-up efforts to
remove the fliers as soon as they
appear on walls. Whenever possi
ble, the University should charge
the agencies which post the fliers
— if they can be identified — for
their removal.
If a larger campaign to elimi
nate the fliers is undertaken now,
it will eventually mean that
administrators will have to spend
less time removing the advertise
ments in the future. The Univer
sity should create spaces to learn
during the year and leave travel
plans for summer break.
