Stanford Language Center Direc
tor Elizabeth Bernhardt has named
five faculty to the new center's advi
sory board, saying that they "repre
sent a wide array of perspectives
about languages."
The advisory board, selected by
Bernhardt in consultation with
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Etchemendy, comprises
German Studies Prof. Russell
Berman, director of Overseas Stud
ies; Walter Falcon, director of the In
stitute for International Studies;
French and Comparative Literature
Prof. Hans Gumbrecht; English and
Linguistics Prof. Shirley Brice
Heath; and Political Science Assoc.
Prof. Terry Karl, director of the Cen
ter for Latin American Studies.
"We were very interested in hav

ing them participate, and they were
very gracious in accepting," Bern
hardt said of the board members.
"I'm really delighted."
The Language Center, which will
begin its first full year in the fall, was
established in response to recom
mendations by the Commission on
Undergraduate Education. It will
conduct research on the study and
teaching of languages, as well as ofTer
workshops, computational equip
ment and other services for student
and faculty use.
The advisory board will have its
first meeting the week of June 10 and
begin regular discussions in the fall.
Its function will be "to articulate
broad-based concerns," Bernhardt
said.
As "some of the most visible and
highly respected professors on cam-
pus, and the world, in fact, (board
members] can see sort of the broad in
ternational Issues Stanford might ad
dress," she said. "All global concerns
inevitably have some language di
mension.
"The immediate charge of the cen
ter is to enhance undergraduate edu
cation, but we are also concerned
about graduate students who need
languages for research purposes,"
Bernhardt said.
Overall, the center will seek to de

termine "what outside constituencies
really want from language depart
ments," Bernhardt said.
Some of the center's goals are to
implement the recently altered un
dergraduate language requirement
and install on-line placement tests for
incoming freshmen.
The new language requirement,
passed by the Faculty Senate last
year, stipulates that students demon
strate proficiency in a language by
scoring a 4 or 5 on an Advanced Place
ment test or a 600 or better on a Col
lege Board achievement test. Alterna
tively, they may pass a Stanford-de
signed proficiency test or take three
quarters of a language at Stanford.

With freshmen taking placement
tests on the Internet the summer be
fore they arrive at Stanford, language
instructors will be able to compile stu
dent portfolios for the first day of
classes.
Another concern is "aligning our
campus-based language programs
with the needs of students who go
abroad," Bernhardt said.
"Any students who study overseas
immediately confront concerns about
language," she said. "Are they pre
pared in a social sense for the lan
guage they're going to use? Have we
made available to them an array of
languages to use? Have we prepared
them?"

The center will also work with area
studies centers such as the Center for
Russian and East European Studies
to find "ways in which the Language
Center could facilitate the acquisition
of language skills for students in
those centers," Bernhardt said.
Making sure students feel com
fortable with multiple languages is
the overarching aim of the Language
Center.
"What's really important... is
that all students at Stanford, regard
less of their major, are trained in lan
guage use and how comfortable they
feel in using language for their own
purposes, research or academic,"
Bernhardt said.
