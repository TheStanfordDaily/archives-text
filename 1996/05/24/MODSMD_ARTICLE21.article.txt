## A 						delusional columnist? 
### 
lAM DELUSIONAL. No, I am not
hearing disembodied voices or talking
to imaginary people (well, not much
anyway). But I am continually being told,
both directly and indirectly, that I do not
realize the true nature of the world in
which I live. Hence the one where I think
I live must be a delusion.
Directly, people have seen fit to tell me
that I'm crazy to believe that a world
exists where people are people, where we
can all recognize each other as a human
beings, where the potential exists for us
to all work together and live together
even if we don't necessarily like each
other. I have been told that I can contin
ue to fool myself as long as I remain in
the pristine environs of Stanford Univer
sity, but my awakening will occur when I
go out into the "real" world. I will find
out that "they" are all against me, plot
ting my demise, planning my destruction.
That people feel compelled to inform
me of my delusion happens frequently.
During one plane ride, the man next to
me expounded at length about how it is
impossible to trust white people, how he
is teaching his children to grow up and
hate white people, how his wife used to
trust them and think they could really be
her friends but some pivotal incident in
her life caused her to find out who her
real friends were, and none of them were
white. He even gave me his phone num
ber so I could call his wife and talk to her,
in case I thought he was lying.

Another mail felt compelled to inform
me that I could not go out with someone
of European descent, as he put it. His
rationale was that those people had
enslaved blacks, then kept blacks down
for all of these years, and look at how they
used to go conquer and subjugate other
people, etc. They control the media, he
told me, and they purposely manipulate
the media to negatively portray blacks.
When I pointed out how unlikely it was
that I'd be dating the owners of The New
York Times or any other media moguls,
this was not relevant. When I pointed out
that the people who committed many of
the deeds he mentioned were dead, and
even if they were alive, I'd be unlikely to
date any of those particular individuals
either, that was irrelevant as well.
Then there are the indirect messages I
receive from the other side. The people on
that side claim that we live in a world
where women and minorities don't have
problems finding jobs or obtaining hous
ing or getting contracts for their busi
nesses or advancing in their careers sim
ply because they are women and minori
ties. They tell me we live in a world
where, all other things being the same,
we are all treated equally and fairly. Sin
gling out people based on their race is not
necessary and doesn't occur in this world,
they say, so we don't need affirmative
action.
At the same time that these people are
selling me the view of the world where

society doesn't need to have defined for it
standards for fair hiring practices, fair
housing practices, or to be encouraged to
admit diverse racial groups to its schools,
while they are telling me that less inter
vention is more, some other people are
saying that society needs to have defined
for it what a family is, what consenting
adults are allowed to do in private and
what the reproductive choices for women
should be.
And they think I'm crazy.
Last I checked, I don't dwell in either
of those worlds. I live in a world where
sometimes I get followed by security
guards in stores. I live in a world where
my friends are of many races and nation
alities. I live in a world where Asians and
Hispanics and African Americans are sin
gled out because of their race, sometimes
beaten and killed, sometimes by the peo
ple who are supposed to be protecting all
of us. I live in a place where often women
and minorities are treated equally, but
sometimes we are not.
My world is not so bleak a place as the
first group would have me believe, nor so
rosy a place as the second group asserts.
So I guess I'll stay in my delusion until
something better comes along.
