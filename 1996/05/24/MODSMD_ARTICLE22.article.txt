Student concerns must play a role in Fac Sen decisions

THE GRADING POLICY has become
such a tired issue for me. I was not
put here to quibble over grading pol
icy minutiae. However, since the ability of
students on this campus to "own up" to
their education has been brought to ques
tion, I feel that the bias of chemistry grad
uate student Janet Stemwedel's argument
in Wednesday's Daily must be pointed out.
Perhaps I am making too many assump
tions, but it is my understanding that
chemistry graduate students must be teach
ing assistants. Hence, as a chemistry TA,
Stemwedel has undoubtedly seen Stanford
education at its worst. I have been through
nearly all of pre-med chemistry here; not
because I was a pre-med, but because I was
a chemistry major. However, the manner in
which the classes were taught and the stu
dents treated left me without the thirst for
knowledge that I entered with, but instead
with a malingering disgust with grading
curves and unhealthy competition. It was
then that I realized that the problem was
not the subject, but the mode of learning.

Any Chemistry 32 student will extol the
wonders of chemistry and science. Profes
sors Richard Zare and James Collman
embody the paradigm for scientific teach
ing. By sharing their enthusiasm and
knowledge, Collman and Zare, as well as
their TAs, are able to teach advanced topics
to first-quarter frosh. It is classes like this
that should be the model for sciences
taught here. Zare and Collman have done
away with the definite curve citing the
responsibility and talent of the students as
their chief reasoning. They trust the stu
dents to learn, and the students respond
with eagerness and curiosity.
Every subsequent chemistry class I
have taken, however, has painted quite a
different picture. The rigidly enforced
grade curve, the increasing levels of
unhealthy competition and the focus on
grades instead of education has reduced
the environment for learning to a rat race.
It is no wonder why the more relaxed drop
policy was abused; it was the only escape.
I am not saying that chemistry is the

only subject in need of improvement. It is
just a very good example of where it has
become apparent that grading and drop
policy changes cannot remedy the funda
mental failings of the courses themselves.
With changes in the drop policy like this,
unscrupulous students, desperate for the
extra A will resort to other means (includ
ing cheating) to attain their ends. Whether
it comes in the form of last minute drops
or crib notes, the ultimate result will be the
abuse of the system. Right or wrong, these
abuses will continue to evolve until the sys
tem itself is repaired.
With that said, it should be noted that
this is only one of many issues on this cam
pus. The grading policy changes are a com
paratively minor complaint compared to
the greater abuses of student rights. There
is much talk of change, but few solid ideas
on how that change might occur. I propose
a student committee be formed to make
sure that student interest is considered
when sweeping changes (such as the grad
ing policy) occur. It is my opinion that the

reason why people attack Geological Sci
ences Prof. Gail Mahood is not because she
is solely responsible. She merely stuck her
neck out to support what she felt was
right. Rather, it is because students were
not given any reasonable say in the matter.
Their voices went largely ignored by Uni
versity figures, most notably Mahood. So
when the ax came down, it was clearly
Mahood's head to be left on the floor. She
has become the scapegoat.
A student committee, whose purpose
would be to protect student rights, provide
an ear for complaint and offer a firm voice
of support, is precisely what our student
body needs to overcome the barriers of
misunderstanding, avoiding unfortunate
situations such as the shameless scape
goating of Mahood. Without a representa
tive b()dy strong enough to elicit response
from the administrators of this school, we
will forever be powerless to affect those
decisions which will affect us.
