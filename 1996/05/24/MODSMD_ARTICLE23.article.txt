The Daily's editorial attack on Faculty
Senate Chair Gail Mahood was intemper
ate and unwarranted. As a member of
both the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, which pro
posed the grading reform, and the senate's
Steering Committee, I know her to be a
dedicated and conscientious University cit
izen, one who is willing to take on thank
less tasks that others shun, and a strong
advocate for undergraduate education at
Stanford.
The grading reform that you regard as
Mahood's "single-handed responsibility"
was passed by a vote of 34-3 in the senate,
after weeks of open-campus debate. It

reflected the overwhelming sentiment of
the faculty, as indicated not just by the
vote but in a series of detailed surveys con
ducted by C-AAA. The outside headlines
that you deride were a source of exaspera
tion to the committee and senate members
as well, since they could never get past the
"Bring back the F" slogan to recognize the
real objective was to establish stability in
class enrollments.
On the question of student member
ship on the Planning and Policy Board,
clearly faculty opinion is much more divid
ed. But your complaint is with all 17 of the
negative voters, not with the one person
who voted last simply because she hap
pened to be chair of the meeting. But that
is not the issue at hand. The letter to the
ASSU Senate to which you object was not
Gail Mahood's personal communication,
but was unanimously approved by the
Faculty Senate Steering Committee —
including members on both sides of the

original vote. Like any similar body, the
Faculty Senate operates within a standard
set of rules, one purpose of which is to pro
vide a modicum of closure when a decision
has been made. As our letter made clear,
in asking to re-open an agenda item on
which a vote has been completed, the
ASSU Senate was asserting a privilege
that no faculty senate committee would be
allowed.
On both of these issues, the student
representatives at the senate spoke force
fully and fully. There was no lack of voice
and no lack of free discussion. What the
issues have in common is the refusal by
The Daily to acknowledge that a majority
of the faculty can sometimes hold an opin
ion that is different from its own. Attribut
ing such differences to a villainess in the
person of Gail Mahood is simply a denial
of that reality.
