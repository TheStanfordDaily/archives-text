# Student regrets tone of anti-Mahood letter
## 
### 
I hope you had a good laugh about
the letter I wrote on Monday. Origi
nally, I did too. Rest assured, I now
regret it. It was no joke to vilify Gail
Mahood nor suggest she should be
crucified.
I do not personally know Gail
Mahood, let alone her religious affilia
tion. I am aware of issues she has sup
ported, and I strongly disagree with
several of them. However, I hold no
grudge against her as Stanford has
taught me that we must accept others,
even for their sense of humor.
I sincerely apologize for any misun
derstanding.
