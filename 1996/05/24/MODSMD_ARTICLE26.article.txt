# Allison Amend: The better part of valor
## Dorm as commune: Home is where the friends are 
### 
PARDON MY HYPOTHESIS, but
college dormitories might be the last
communes, sans the idealistic Utopi
an component, of course. Where else on
earth do grown adults who make a decent
amount of money (or at least, spend a
decent amount of money) share such per
sonal space as bathrooms? The fact that
two sexually active members of society
would share one room without a wall is
further proof that Residential Education is
a holdover from the peace-grooving free
love movement.
Strangely enough, and I only say this
because I am notoriously selfish about per
sonal space, I love dorm living.
I love the fact that you get to preview
your colds and flus, watching the athletes
get the virus first (the swimmers are the
first to go) and then the sophomores. Yes,
watch that puppy spread like wildflower
through the dorm hook-ups and wait, just
wait, until its dragon-like claws sink into
your flesh. "How long will this last?" you
ask your neighbor. And he / she knows.
No matter what your vice, there must
be someone in the house who shares it.
Like to eat after 4 a.m.? There's always

some drunken slob in the kitchen with the
munchies. Watch a really cheesy soap
opera? Chances are there's a "Guiding
Light" fan among the residents. Like to do
e-mail naked . . . ?
There's nothing like dorm intrigue.
Who's zoom in' who, indeed? And if the
telephone connection occurs in a public
place, like say, the lounge, the gossip mills
could be churning for weeks. The walk of
shame is that much more poignant when
you have to march down three flights of
stairs knowing all the doors have eyes and
ears. Who's sharing breakfast on Saturday
morning? The fun never ends!
Let me give you an example. Take, say,
my house â€” an unnamed theme residence
on the Row. The house is a harbinger of
trends on campus, a sort of mini-indicator
of larger themes at play in the University in
the same way a kibbutz is a micro-society.
I live in the Sartorial State, the fashion
theme dorm. Yes, we pretend to be cen
tered around language and culture, but
truly, it is fashion that unties us here on
the Row.
On any given day, we wake up late. We
shower quickly, throw our hair back

(approximately eight out of 25 women
have had the "Rachel-cut") and stand
naked in front of our closets, knees knock
ing. arms crossed, surveying our means of
attack.
We may have individual styles, but our
commitment to fashion is what separates
us from the rest. Some are retro, some
mod. Some model ourselves alter Jackie
0., some after Mr. T; some lacy, some racy;
some Chanel, some tunnel (as in, they
must have gotten dressed in the dark that
day, because their socks don't match); still,
we've all got Style.
Style is what makes the world go round.
Style is what separates Willie Brown from
Frank Jordan. Take location alone: We are
the Milan, even the Paris, of Stanford.
My house sports "jungle lagoon," a baby
pool-cum-Jacuzzi which gets "fired up" on
the weekends to residential delight. Our
lawn is lay-out heaven, and we all wear
beautiful, healthy tans. The basketball
court is the sight of one-on-one volleyball
action. The irony of this does not escape us.
Admittedly, all of this bonding occurs at
the expense of classes, but, hey, no one I
know is taking any. We spend our after

noons lounging, watching the cars go by.
We know the Black Mountain Water Man
by name (Marc). We know the Annoying
Couple's schedule (at 1:15 every afternoon,
they walk through the parking lot. She has
her right hand in his front pocket. His
hand rests comfortably around her shoul
ders. We anxiously await the day when
they have to carry something, for we sus
pect they are surgically joined that way).
We recognize the Facilities guy who's come
to fix the roof leak every single time it's
rained this year.
In short, we're hip to the system. Yes,
we're housewives in the gender-neutral
sense of the term. We're always home.
We eat together, we all watch "ER," we
all have been known to throw back a few
shots if the occasion warrants. We don't
venture out much. We're self-sufficient.
Now before you send me hate mail
telling me that your house is the greatest,
realize: that is the point. Every house is the
greatest, because you and all your friends
live there.
And unless you move to a Fox series or
a retirement apartment building, this is
the only time in your life where you will be

surrounded by people who like to do the
same things you do.
Should you milk it for all it's worth,
gathering knowledge like a sorority pledge
collects painted cups? After all, at what
future point in your life will you have so
many available resources?
But I say, no, don't harvest their wis
dom, just exploit it. Let the ME majors fix
your flat tire and let the EE majors pirate
cable to your room. Let the econ majors do
your taxes and let the English majors forge
letters to your long-distance girlfriend.
And then leave it at that, content in the
thought that you couldn't have possibly
completed these tasks without them. In
the commune that is residential living,
each has his own task.
In other words, enjoy the company of
friends, because, before you know it, you'll
be cooking your own food, cleaning your
own bathrooms and borrowing Taster's
Choice from strangers. Graduation looms
large; better stay in the womb. Viva el dor
mitory!
