Athletes deserve praise,
not condemnation
Daily columnist James G. Wheaton,
who summarily dismissed the impor
tance of varsity athletics at Stanford in
his piece "End Stanford athletics," is off
his highfalutin' rocker. Ke has single
handedly proclaimed himself god of
American culture with statements like
the one where he implies that Stanford's
admission policy leads us to "watchlingl
basketball instead of ballet." He is
offended that Stanford places such an
emphasis on athletics through recruit
ment and "help in admissions" which he
feels only serves to lower our standards
and academic reputation.
What Wheaton seems to ignore is
that Stanford Athletics is a major con
tributor to our overall excellence as a
university. Stanford appears to look for
diversity in the candidates which they
accept, and as someone who played a
varsity sport all through high school,
athletics is a component (but not the
only) of the well-roundedness which
Stanford seeks out. Athletics teach you
pride, discipline, time-management,
physical fitness and keep many kids
occupied and out of trouble.
Athletics in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, which is arguably one of the
toughest Division I leagues in the nation
in many sports, requires dedication and
hard work which allows students to take
athletics to a whole new level. They
spend at least 20 hours per week practic
ing to put on a Stanford uniform and
ensure that the Stanford name is top in
athletics, as well as in academics. Our
athletes pay for their scholarships many

times over, both in gate receipts and
happy alumni who contribute big dollars
because of their experience with athlet
ics. These donors benefit the whole Uni
versity. Who in their right mind would
knock sports when alumni like Jack
McDowell will plunk down money to
beautify and improve our school for the
entire student body? Even David
Packard, one of the most generous
donors in our history, played football
here in the 1930s and was assuredly
influenced by his Stanford Athletics
experience.
Wheaton's focus on athletes in trou
ble with the University is a pot shot
which focuses on a few bad seeds and
belittles the vast accomplishments
which are too numerous to name in this
short of a space. Were we to put our
faith in Wheaton's beliefs, resident
assistants should be eliminated too. I
mean, there are a few bad RAs each
year, so why not scrap the whole system,
right?
While Wheaton can whine and com
plain about the maladies of varsity
sports, sports are an excellent release
from the grind of everyday life for much
of the student body. Many Stanford stu
dents were athletes in high school and
continue to play sports here: they run,
they play tennis, they play intramurals
and so on. Stanford caters to everyone,
whether it be culturally, athletically or
academically. Wheaton, in my estima
tion, is in the minority with his lofty ide
als of violins and ballet replacing base
ball and football. James, why don't you
drop by a varsity football game some
time? 80,000 fans — students and alums
alike — can't be wrong.

Affirmative action is
needed for construction
workers at Stan ford
I write to take up a cause which Hank
Organ championed for many years
before retiring, but which is still as
much in need of action as when he first
addressed it.
The issue is the apparent absence of
affirmative action in the construction
crews which are so prevalent around
Stanford's campus. Although millions of
dollars are being spent on earthquake
rebuilding, seismic strengthening and
the construction or renovation of cam
pus buildings, very few of the workers
(and on several sites, none of them) are
women or people of color. Organ com
plained for years about the absence of
African Americans in particular on such
work crews, and they remain almost
completely unrepresented.
When one considers the economic
depression of women and ethnic minori
ties in communities like East Palo Alto
and Redwood City and the economic
opportunity represented by employment
opportunities in the construction indus
try, Stanford's failure to insist that its
contractors hire more women and people
of color is quite troubling. It is certainly
not in keeping with the commendable
efforts which the University has made to
promote affirmative action in other
areas, like undergraduate admissions.
I call on all members of the Stanford
community to use their eyes to confirm
the situation as described above as they
walk, bike and drive around this con
struction-prone campus, and I call on

the administration to insist that its con
tractors hire more women and people of
color if they wish to acquire or retain
lucrative contracts.

Athletics at Stanford
benefit athletes, and
other students as well
James G. Wheaton's column about
ending the Stanford athletics program Ls
upsetting and inaccurate.
Wheaton makes a number of false
accusations and ignorant generalizations
about Stanford athletes. He assumes that
athletes are responsible for most of the
vandalism, sexual assaults and other ille
gal activities that take place at Stanford. I
can think of about four or five recent
occurrences that involved Stanford ath
letes and the Stanford police. Estimating
that there are about 700 athletes, about
15 of them have recently committed some
type of serious campus disturbance. Even
though I am an athlete at this school, I
still have the intelligence to figure out
that these disturbances involve two per
cent of Stanford athletes.
Most incidents at Stanford have noth
ing to do with athletes. I do not see how
anyone can conclude that two percent is a
good representation of the majority of the
athletes at Stanford. This poor reasoning
only shows that Wheaton has no idea
what he is talking about. He believes that
every athlete only cares about his or her
sport and spends the rest of the time get
ting drunk, vandalizing the school or
assaulting someone. It is obvious that

Wheaton spends too much time playing
his violin or watching ballet.
The truth is, Stanford athletes should
be commended and deserve any positive
recognition they receive. While many stu
dents rollerblade to the library and send
e-mail to their friends at Harvard, Stan
ford athletes are working hard every day
so they can compete against the most tal
ented athletes from other colleges. At the
same time, these athletes have to manage
their time to keep up with their academics
and any other extracurricular activities.
By looking at the number of academic Ail-
Americans and NCAA championships
Stanford athletes have earned, one can
conclude that Stanford has the most intel
ligent and talented athletes in the nation.
Wheaton complains that there is too
much emphasis on sports in our society. I
believe that sports provide a great service
for participants and spectators. Stanford
ticket sales to football games, basketball
games and other sports greatly contribute
to our university. The truth is that our
society loves to watch sports. Why is this
a bad thing? The love for sports is clearly
evident when we watch the Olympics,
NBA finals or any other widely publicized
athletic event. Sports provide entertain
ment, excitement and drama. One of my
best times at Stanford was watching the
basketball team defeat UCLA at Maples
Pavilion. Sports teach athletes discipline
and goal setting, two useful skills difficult
to acquire in the classroom. Reading
books and listening to lectures are not the
only forms of education. A person who
does not participate in sports may not be
able to understand this, so I guess I can
sympathize with Wheaton's ignorance.

continue to play sports here: they run,
they play tennis, they play intramurals
and so on. Stanford caters to everyone,
whether it be culturally, athletically or
academically. Wheaton, in my estima
tion, is in the minority with his lofty ide
als of violins and ballet replacing base
ball and football. James, why don't you
drop by a varsity football game some
time? 80,000 fans — students and alums
alike — can't be wrong.

Affirmative action is
needed for construction
workers at Stan ford
I write to take up a cause which Hank
Organ championed for many years
before retiring, but which is still as
much in need of action as when he first
addressed it.
The issue is the apparent absence of
affirmative action in the construction
crews which are so prevalent around
Stanford's campus. Although millions of
dollars are being spent on earthquake
rebuilding, seismic strengthening and
the construction or renovation of cam
pus buildings, very few of the workers
(and on several sites, none of them) are
women or people of color. Organ com
plained for years about the absence of
African Americans in particular on such
work crews, and they remain almost
completely unrepresented.
When one considers the economic
depression of women and ethnic minori
ties in communities like East Palo Alto
and Redwood City and the economic
opportunity represented by employment
opportunities in the construction indus
try, Stanford's failure to insist that its
contractors hire more women and people
of color is quite troubling. It is certainly
not in keeping with the commendable
efforts which the University has made to
promote affirmative action in other
areas, like undergraduate admissions.
I call on all members of the Stanford
community to use their eyes to confirm
the situation as described above as they
walk, bike and drive around this con
struction-prone campus, and I call on

the administration to insist that its con
tractors hire more women and people of
color if they wish to acquire or retain
lucrative contracts.

Athletics at Stanford
benefit athletes, and
other students as well
James G. Wheaton's column about
ending the Stanford athletics program Ls
upsetting and inaccurate.
Wheaton makes a number of false
accusations and ignorant generalizations
about Stanford athletes. He assumes that
athletes are responsible for most of the
vandalism, sexual assaults and other ille
gal activities that take place at Stanford. I
can think of about four or five recent
occurrences that involved Stanford ath
letes and the Stanford police. Estimating
that there are about 700 athletes, about
15 of them have recently committed some
type of serious campus disturbance. Even
though I am an athlete at this school, I
still have the intelligence to figure out
that these disturbances involve two per
cent of Stanford athletes.
Most incidents at Stanford have noth
ing to do with athletes. I do not see how
anyone can conclude that two percent is a
good representation of the majority of the
athletes at Stanford. This poor reasoning
only shows that Wheaton has no idea
what he is talking about. He believes that
every athlete only cares about his or her
sport and spends the rest of the time get
ting drunk, vandalizing the school or
assaulting someone. It is obvious that

Wheaton spends too much time playing
his violin or watching ballet.
The truth is, Stanford athletes should
be commended and deserve any positive
recognition they receive. While many stu
dents rollerblade to the library and send
e-mail to their friends at Harvard, Stan
ford athletes are working hard every day
so they can compete against the most tal
ented athletes from other colleges. At the
same time, these athletes have to manage
their time to keep up with their academics
and any other extracurricular activities.
By looking at the number of academic Ail-
Americans and NCAA championships
Stanford athletes have earned, one can
conclude that Stanford has the most intel
ligent and talented athletes in the nation.
Wheaton complains that there is too
much emphasis on sports in our society. I
believe that sports provide a great service
for participants and spectators. Stanford
ticket sales to football games, basketball
games and other sports greatly contribute
to our university. The truth is that our
society loves to watch sports. Why is this
a bad thing? The love for sports is clearly
evident when we watch the Olympics,
NBA finals or any other widely publicized
athletic event. Sports provide entertain
ment, excitement and drama. One of my
best times at Stanford was watching the
basketball team defeat UCLA at Maples
Pavilion. Sports teach athletes discipline
and goal setting, two useful skills difficult
to acquire in the classroom. Reading
books and listening to lectures are not the
only forms of education. A person who
does not participate in sports may not be
able to understand this, so I guess I can
sympathize with Wheaton's ignorance.
