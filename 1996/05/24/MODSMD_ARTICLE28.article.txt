### Robin Davidson Contributing writer 
The Stanford women's golf team took day two

moving from 11th place after one round of play
into a two-way tie for second with Arizona.
The Cardinal shot a tournament-best 304 at La

finished the first round eight strokes off the lead,
but managed to take a substantial chunk out of
that deficit in round two.
Texas, which finished the first round in first
place with a score of 313, shot a mere 320 to drop
to ninth. New Mexico State also fell in the stand
ings. The Lobos finished the first round in a three
way tie for third with UCLA and Wake Forest, but
while the Bruins and Demon Deacons managed to
improve upon their first-round scores of 315 —
maintaining a two-way tie for fourth with scores of
311 each — New Mexico dropped into oblivion.
With a vacuum at the top of the standings, Pa
cific 10 Conference rival Arizona State made the
most of the opportunity, matching Stanford's sec
ond-round score of 304 to vault into first place.
ASU finished round one with a modest 320, but its
second-round effort left the Sun Devils one stroke
ahead of both Stanford and Arizona heading into
today's third round.
In individual competition, Arizona's Maria
Baena maintained her position in first place with a
two-round total of 145. Baena shot a 70 in the first
round and followed that up with a 75 in round two
to secure her place atop the individual standings.
Stanford senior Vicky Strada and junior An

first-round performances, allowing them to move
into a two-way tie for fourth place. Strada and Bax
ter put up scores of 73 and 74, respectively, to bet
ter their first-round scores of 78 and 77.
Junior All-American Mhairi McKay shot four
better than her first-round score of 80 to move to
18th, and senior Julie Bo wen moved to 78th with a
second-round score of 81. Meanwhile, freshman
Michelle Sperry dropped to 94th with an 89.
