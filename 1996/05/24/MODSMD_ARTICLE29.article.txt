Throughout the past week, Cal State-Northridge's
baseball squad fought for respect in the wake of a
shocking No. 5 seed. It took one pitch last night for the
Matadors to earn some from Kyle Peterson.
The sophomore Stanford ace surrendered a home run
to shortstop Adam Kennedy to start the game. However,
the wily right-hander kept his composure and pitched a
shutout until the seventh, and the Stanford bats poured
it on to defeat Robby Crabtree (13-8) and the Matadors
(49-17), 10-5. A season-high partisan crowd 0f3,364 was
on hand as Stanford extended its school-record win
streak to 17 games and upped its home record to 25-5.
The second-seeded Cardinal (40-17) will next face
third-seeded Mississippi State (38-22), a 6-2 winner over
UC-Santa Barbara (32-19), in a 7 p.m. battle tonight at
Sunken Diamond. Cal State-Northridge will battle bot
tom-seed Northeastern Illinois (31-28) in an 11 a.m.
elimination game. In the 3 p.m. contest, top-seed Florida
State (48-15), who defeated the Golden Eagles 16-0 to
open the day, will attempt to eliminate the Gauchos.
The Cardinal avoided the losers' bracket thanks to
some stellar defense, timely hitting and Peterson's
ability to elude jams. Although Peterson (10-5) battled
control problems throughout the evening, he settled
into a groove after Kennedy's shot, which rattled
everybody.
"It was not a good feeling," Peterson said. "I
thought it was a good pitch. It was a fastball away.
With the wind if a ball is hit well there is a good chance
it will go out."
While no Cardinal hitters belted one out, eight dif
ferent Stanford players banged 14 hits, including four
for extra bases. Sophomore designated hitter John
Schaeffer led the way with three hits and two runs,
sophomore right fielder Joe Kilburg scored three
times and senior catcher A.J. Hinch added three RBIs.
Matador catcher Robert Fick, named yesterday the
Collegiate Baseball / Mizuno first-team All-American
backstop, suffered through an 0-for-3 performance be
fore his ejection in the seventh inning. His liner to
right-center field in the third inning seemed destined
for extra bases before freshman Jody Gerut made a
stunning running grab.
"He has had about 10-15 catches like that this sea
son," said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "It was a
big catch for us at that time of the game."
