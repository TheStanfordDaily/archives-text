Cal State-Northridge 2

Throughout the past week, Cal State-Northridge's
baseball squad fought for respect in the wake of a
shocking No. 5 seed. It took one pitch last night for the
Matadors to earn some from Kyle Peterson.
The sophomore Stanford ace surrendered a home run
to shortstop Adam Kennedy to start the game. However,
the wily right-hander kept his composure and pitched a
shutout until the seventh, and the Stanford bats poured
it on to defeat Robby Crabtree (13-8) and the Matadors
(49-17), 10-5. A season-high partisan crowd 0f3,364 was
on hand as Stanford extended its school-record win
streak to 17 games and upped its home record to 25-5.
The second-seeded Cardinal (40-17) will next face
third-seeded Mississippi State (38-22), a 6-2 winner over
UC-Santa Barbara (32-19), in a 7 p.m. battle tonight at
Sunken Diamond. Cal State-Northridge will battle bot
tom-seed Northeastern Illinois (31-28) in an 11 a.m.
elimination game. In the 3 p.m. contest, top-seed Florida
State (48-15), who defeated the Golden Eagles 16-0 to
open the day, will attempt to eliminate the Gauchos.
The Cardinal avoided the losers' bracket thanks to
some stellar defense, timely hitting and Peterson's
ability to elude jams. Although Peterson (10-5) battled
control problems throughout the evening, he settled
into a groove after Kennedy's shot, which rattled
everybody.
"It was not a good feeling," Peterson said. "I
thought it was a good pitch. It was a fastball away.
With the wind if a ball is hit well there is a good chance
it will go out."
While no Cardinal hitters belted one out, eight dif
ferent Stanford players banged 14 hits, including four
for extra bases. Sophomore designated hitter John
Schaeffer led the way with three hits and two runs,
sophomore right fielder Joe Kilburg scored three
times and senior catcher A.J. Hinch added three RBIs.
Matador catcher Robert Fick, named yesterday the
Collegiate Baseball / Mizuno first-team All-American
backstop, suffered through an 0-for-3 performance be
fore his ejection in the seventh inning. His liner to
right-center field in the third inning seemed destined
for extra bases before freshman Jody Gerut made a
stunning running grab.
"He has had about 10-15 catches like that this sea
son," said Stanford coach Mark Marquess. "It was a
big catch for us at that time of the game."

Sophomore Kyle Peterson fires one home during the Cardinal's 10-5 victory over Cal State-Northridge
last night at Sunken Diamond. The right-hander earned his 10th win by going 6 and 2/3 innings, yielding
seven hits and three runs while fanning four.
After the snare, the Stanford
batters started to get to Crabtree.
Kilburg and junior first baseman
Luke Quaccia doubled to tie the
score at one run apiece in the
third, before the Cardinal pounced
for four in the fourth.
Junior left fielder Chris Clark
batted in Schaeffer with one out,
and Kennedy committed a key
error on a grounder by sopho
more shortstop Jay Pecci. With
two outs, Gerut singled in Clark
before Hinch laced a two-run
triple past a diving Kurt Airoso
and on into center field. Hinch
moved into fourth place in career
RBIs at Stanford and a six-way
tie for fourth on the Cardinal's's
career triples list. Crabtree sur
rendered two more unearned
runs in the sixth before leaving
with one out.
"It was the defense that made
the difference," Kennedy said. "I
don't know what was the matter."
Two miscues by Matador sec
ond baseman Cesar Martinez al

lowed Stanford to bat around in
the fifth. Quaccia's triple preceded
three consecutive two-out singles.
CSUN finally chased Peterson
in the seventh, scoring two runs
and loading the bases before ju
nior Tom Reimers extinguished
the fire, drawing a hard liner from
Airoso to a perfectly placed Troy
Kent at the hot corner.
Reimers surrendered two more
runs in the eighth before sealing
the triumph in an uneventful
ninth, moving Peterson into the
top 10 in career wins (24) at Stan
ford in just his second year.
Tonight, Marquess said either
freshman Chad Hutchinson (7-1,
3.30 ERA) or senior Mario Igle
sias (9-1, 2.49) will take the
mound. Iglesias' experience and
surprising success in a must-win
situation at last year's Midwest
Regional moved him ahead of nor
mal No. 3 starter Jeff Austin, a
freshman. Ron Polk's Bulldogs
should throw one of two junior
righties, either Keith Dilgard (6-
3, 5.04) or David Hooten (8-7,
4.58). Although struggling in his
last start, Dilgard has won his last
three decisions while Hooten has
dropped his last two.
