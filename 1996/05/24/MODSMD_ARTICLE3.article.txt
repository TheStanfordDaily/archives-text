# Shen seizes ASSU presidency
## Election marked by low turnout; ticket wins with 52 percent of vote 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
Deputy ASSU Senate Chair Bill Shen
soundly defeated opponents Sam Ockman
and Margot Quandt last night, capturing just
over 52 percent of votes cast to become the
first ASSU president in 27 years.
Low voter turnout characterized the elec
tion, with only 1629 out of more than 13,000
enrolled students voting — less than 12.4
percent of the student body.
Undaunted by the apparent student apa
thy, Shen is confident he has the support of

the student body to go ahead with what he
has termed "a new vision" for student gov
ernment.
"It's not going to be a problem if I recog
nize that before I get into office, before I start
serving as president, before I start serving as
the student advocate," Shen said.
The spring general election, when voters
approved a single president as part of "Con
stitution '96," boasted a 30.1 percent
turnout.
In this week's election, Shen received 820
