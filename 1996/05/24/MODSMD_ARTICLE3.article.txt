# Shen seizes ASSU presidency
## Election marked by low turnout; ticket wins with 52 percent of vote 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
Deputy ASSU Senate Chair Bill Shen
soundly defeated opponents Sam Ockman
and Margot Quandt last night, capturing just
over 52 percent of votes cast to become the
first ASSU president in 27 years.
Low voter turnout characterized the elec
tion, with only 1629 out of more than 13,000
enrolled students voting — less than 12.4
percent of the student body.
Undaunted by the apparent student apa
thy, Shen is confident he has the support of

the student body to go ahead with what he
has termed "a new vision" for student gov
ernment.
"It's not going to be a problem if I recog
nize that before I get into office, before I start
serving as president, before I start serving as
the student advocate," Shen said.
The spring general election, when voters
approved a single president as part of "Con
stitution '96," boasted a 30.1 percent
turnout.
In this week's election, Shen received 820

votes, Ockman came in second
with 384 votes and Quandt had
232 votes.
To receive a majority of votes
presidential candidates needed
788 votes. The number is less
than half the total number of
votes cast because some students
voted only for Graduate Council
members, which were elected on
the same ballot as ASSU presi

dent.
Shen, a sophomore majoring in
public policy, will assume power
with a mandate approved by 6.2
percent of the student body.
"It's a special election," Elec
tions Commissioner Ryan Med
ders explained. "That's the nature
of special elections. Without a
pressing issue on the ballot,
turnout suffers."
With junior Nick Thompson as
his running mate, Shen cam
paigned as the "ultimate insider"
to Thompson's "ultimate out
sider." Both have pledged to take

drastic action to sweep away the
vestiges of the Council of Presi
dents and make a clean break
from what Shen characterized as
"old, boring regurgitated ideas."
"Tomorrow, we'll go through
our platform and find out what
steps need to be taken to get the
groundwork in place. It's going to
take a great deal of research, but
next fall we'll hit the ground run
ning," Thompson said.
Both men have a history as out
spoken activists within the Stan
ford community.
In the senate, Shen was instru

mental in forming a panel to ex
amine campus safety, helping to
speed the implementation of the
University's plan to improve cam
pus lighting and install a network
of emergency phones — the first
of which will appear this summer.
Thompson has focused his en
ergies outside the student govern
ment arena. As president of the
California chapter of the Student
Environmental Action Coalition,
he is credited with organizing stu
dent protest against a proposed
Taco Bell in Tresidder Union and
lobbying the senate to pass a reso

lution condemning Taco Bell's
parent company, PepsiCo, for its
investment in Myanmar, the
country in Southeast Asia former
ly known as Burma.
When the election results were
announced yesterday, Thompson
was wearing a black armband as
part of his involvement in a
hunger strike against the govern
ment of Myanmar, held in solidar
ity with a human rights activist.
The president- and vice presi
dent-elect hope to channel their
energy and experience by forming
a transition team of student lead

ers to plan carefully their first
quarter in office.
"The structural changes [of
"Constitution '96"1 are in place,"
Shen said. "The students have
elected who they think is quali
fied. Let's get to work."
Shen will take power after the
new senate certifies the election at
its next meeting.
Graduate students also elected
two members to the Graduate
Student Council: Trisha Tang and
Mercedes Salomon. The four re
maining council seats will be filled
with write-in candidates.
