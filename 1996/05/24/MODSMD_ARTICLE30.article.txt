# Postseason drama returns to Farm
## 
### Jeremy Stone Senior staff writer 
On a day when six of eight no. 2
seeds fell in NCAA Regional action,
Sunken Diamond played host to no
upsets. Sunshine and halogen lights
welcomed postseason baseball back
to Stanford after a six-year absence.
The Cardinal has advanced each
of the four previous tunes it has
served as host, and extended its
home postseason win streak to 10
games with last night's triumph.
Stanford has dropped just one re

gional contest at Sunken, a 5-1 set
back to Pepperdine on May 26,
1985.
Last night's matchup was antici
pated more than any other game in
the nation, with two top-10 teams
squaring off. But the other four
squads all brought an interesting
background with them to set the
table for the grand finale.
Late-May baseball returned to
Stanford with a yawner before 643
when Florida State battled North
eastern Illinois. The Golden Eagles,
content with their first bid in a Divi

sion I postseason event in any sport,
were obliterated 16-0.
The Seminoles scored in each of
the first seven innings, and seemed
capable of scoring 30 runs if desired.
NEIU ace Jamie Puorto (9-6) was
shelled for 10 runs (seven earned) in
three innings as the Seminoles
cleared the left-field wall four times,
the most all season. Left fielder Je
remy Morris enjoyed a 4-for-5, four
RBI performance and belted his
NCAA-record 35th double.
Without question, the space in
David Letterman's front teeth can
not compare with the gap between
the bottom two seeds in the West.
The Golden Eagles, just four weeks
ago, stood 20-26 overall in the Mid-
Continent Conference, featuring
such giants as New York Tech, Pace
and C.W. Post in its weaker Eastern
half. They crawled over .500 for the
first time since opening day just
three games ago.
Before the MCC tournament,
NEIU had played just 11 nine-in
ning games all year, with the major
ity of the rest seven-frame double
headers. Second baseman Eric Mau
said, "There were some butterflies,"
as one might expect when a squad
with just its third winning season in
20 years faces one which has never
suffered through anything even re
motely close to sub-.500.
"We were going to have a good
time," said beleaguered coach
Jim Hawrysko, as if his squad's
season were over. "It was our
first time here, and nobodv ex

pected us to be here."
Many doubted that the Semi
noles would be here, as in Stanford,
but there was no question they
would go somewhere. Mark Mar
tin's team has advanced to seven
College World Series in its last 10
tries, although it is unaccustomed to
leaving Tallahassee in late May.
While FSU and NEIU provided
a stark contrast in talent, one can
not imagine a odder geographical
pairing than Mississippi State and
UC-Santa Barbara, two schools
which have never met before and
may never meet again. Mississippi
State hung tough to fight off UC-
Santa Barbara in the middle game
before 1,068, scoring in its last
three innings. The storied Bulldog
program returned to the postsea
son after a three-year absence,
while the Gauchos made the re
gional trek to Sunken Diamond for
the third time. UCSB had not par
ticipated in the tourney since
1990.
Bulldog coach Ron Polk eyes his
I,oooth victoiy, needing just four
more to attain the milestone. But
tonight he will face a Cardinal squad
with a milestone of its own â€” post
season game No. 100.
