# Postseason drama returns to Farm

On a day when six of eight no. 2
seeds fell in NCAA Regional action,
Sunken Diamond played host to no
upsets. Sunshine and halogen lights
welcomed postseason baseball back
to Stanford after a six-year absence.
The Cardinal has advanced each
of the four previous tunes it has
served as host, and extended its
home postseason win streak to 10
games with last night's triumph.
Stanford has dropped just one re

gional contest at Sunken, a 5-1 set
back to Pepperdine on May 26,
1985.
Last night's matchup was antici
pated more than any other game in
the nation, with two top-10 teams
squaring off. But the other four
squads all brought an interesting
background with them to set the
table for the grand finale.
Late-May baseball returned to
Stanford with a yawner before 643
when Florida State battled North
eastern Illinois. The Golden Eagles,
content with their first bid in a Divi

sion I postseason event in any sport,
were obliterated 16-0.
The Seminoles scored in each of
the first seven innings, and seemed
capable of scoring 30 runs if desired.
NEIU ace Jamie Puorto (9-6) was
shelled for 10 runs (seven earned) in
three innings as the Seminoles
cleared the left-field wall four times,
the most all season. Left fielder Je
remy Morris enjoyed a 4-for-5, four
RBI performance and belted his
NCAA-record 35th double.
