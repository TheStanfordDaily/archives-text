# Bleszynski advances to quarterfinals
## Sophomore is last hope for NCAA singles title; both doubles teams win 
### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
It was a day of ups and downs at the NCAA indi
vidual championships in Tallahassee, Fla., yester
day.
Sixth-seeded Ania Bleszynski fought off the sti
fling heat and advanced to the quarterfinals with
straight-set victories over Pam Enkoji of California
and Lori Sowell of Florida State, but she was the sole
Stanford survivor on a day that saw Katie Schluke
bir, Julie Scott and Sandra De Silva all eliminated
from singles competition.
However, it was on the doubles courts where the
most exciting event of the day transpired. It was
there that Scott and senior Kim Shasby — upset win
ners over Georgia's third-seeded tandem of Michelle
Anderson and Anne Chauzu on Wednesday — ad
vanced to the round of eight with a stirring victory
over Costain and Sosnowy of Washington.
"It was a pretty good day overall," said head coach
Frank Brennan. "It gets tougher and tougher, obvi
ously."
With yesterday's win, Shasby earned All-Aineri
can honors for the first time since 1993, when she
was a redshirt freshman. Scott, a sophomore, gar
nered Ail-American honors for the first time in her
career.
Shasby and Scott won't he the only Stanford duo
on the courts tomorrow — the second-seeded pair of
Bleszynski and Schlukebir also advanced to the
quarterfinals by topping Marie-Laure Bougnol and
Courtney Chapman of Mississippi. That means the
Cardinal now constitutes one-quarter of the field in
doubles competition.
The same can't be said for singles play, however.
Bleszynski was the only Stanford player to make it
out of the second round, notching a 7-5,6-3 win over
Cal's Enkoji. She followed that up with an identical
7-5, 6-3 victory over Sowell of Florida State in the
round of 16, earning her a date with downstate rival
Keri Phebus of UCLA in tomorrow's quarterfinals.
"It's really hot here, and she was dying," Brennan
said of Bleszynski, who had to play three matches in
the grueling Florida heat. "She was conserving her
energy, just trying to get through the match.
"The locals are saying it's very unusual. It's bru
tal."
In other singles action, Schlukebir saw her title
hopes brought to an end with a 6-4, 6-0 loss to
UCLA's Paige Yaroshuk. Meanwhile, Scott was
ousted by top-ranked Vicky Maes of Arizona in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, and De Silva fell to Vanessa
Webb of Duke — the NCAA's Rookie of the Year —
by a 6-4,6-0 score.
"Basically, we had our [Nos. 3 and 5 players! play
ing some of the best players in the country," Bren
nan said, referring to Scott and De Silva. "They put
up a good fight, but it wasn't good enough to win."
Dreams of an NCAA singles title now rest square
ly on the shoulders of Bleszynski, who faces a tough
opponent in Phebus. The two have met twice this
season, with Bleszynski topping Phebus in L.A. and

she's also very good. It would be

quite an upset for Ania to beat her.

Bleszynski and Schlukebir will

"It's not too bad a draw, I

can beat that Cal team."
