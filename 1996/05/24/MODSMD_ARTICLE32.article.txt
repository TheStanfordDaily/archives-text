# Men's tennis swept out of singles play
## Goldstein, Thomas, Wolters all lose; doubles teams advance to round two 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Four Stanford players re
ceived invitations to participate
in the NCAA individual singles
tournament this season. No
other school entered as many
players.
However, two days after the
start of the tournament, there
are no more Cardinal netters
remaining in the title hunt. Se
nior Jeff Salzcnstein, the No. 5
seed and winner of 1996's Se
nior of the Year award, was
upset in the first round, and
yesterday Ryan Wolters (No.
11), Paul Goldstein (No. 28)
and Jim Thomas (No. 51) joined
their captain in the losers' cir
cle.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal's
two doubles teams continued to
advance.
Although each of Stanford's
competitors was defeated by

top-notch collegiate players, it
was obvious that the four days
of intense team competition im
mediately prior to the individ
ual tournament had drained
the Cardinal entrants. Winning
the NCAA team championship
took a lot out of all of the Cardi
nal players, both emotionally
and physically.
UCLA, which lost to Stan
ford in the finals of the team
event, also recorded disappoint
ing results in the singles com
petition. The top seed and No.
1-ranked player in college,
Justin Gimelstob, was knocked
out of the tournament by little
known Phil Cooper of Wichita
State. Cooper, who is from Eng
land, is not ranked in the top
100 in the latest collegiate
rankings. Gimelstob's loss
marked the first time since
1989 that the top seed bowed
out in the first round. Eric Taino
(No. 27) was another Bruin who
failed to advance past the first
round.
After his loss to Auburn's Lee
Pearson (No. 39) on Wednesday,
Salzenstein acknowledged how
much the team competition had
taken out of him.
"I didn't quite have my legs
under me today," he said. "Yes
terday was one of the greatest
days of my life and I'll always
have that. Justin (Gimelstob]
and I threw our guts out on the
line yesterday, and it's tough
coming back. We both had shots
at winning this tournament, but
you can't take anyone lightly."
Wolters, ranked No. 11 in the
country, was defeated by Fresno
State's Fredrik Bergh, 6-3, 6-3.
Bergh is ranked 17th, and the
Swedish sophomore's baseline
power was too much for a tired
Wolters. Wolters had won five
consecutive matches in NCAA
competition before losing yester
day.
Goldstein ran into the fourth
seeded and third-ranked player in
the country, USC's Cecil Mamiit,
in the second round. The Cardinal
sophomore gave the Trojans' top
player all he could handle before
falling in three sets, 7-6 (7-0), 4-6,
6-2. Mamiit was recently named
the Freshman of the Year .
Thomas lost to Georgia's
16th-ranked John Roddick 6-4,
6-1. Roddick, who benefited from
playing in front of a home crowd,
defeated Goldstein earlier this
week in the team competition.
While it was disappointing for
all the Cardinal players to be
knocked out of the singles draw,
they were able to bounce back in
the doubles.
Thomas and Goldstein, the No.
2-seeded pair, easily beat LSU's
Chad Dudley and Ryan Ideta, 6-1,
6-4. They will face New Mexico's
Chris Brown and Javier Gutierrez
(No. 28) in the round of 16.
Meanwhile, Salzenstein and
Wolters (No. 19) beat 27th
ranked David Caldwell and Brint
Morrow of North Carolina. They
meet Texas Christian Universi
ty's David Roditi and Paul Robin
son in the second round. Roditi
and Robinson are ranked No. 3,
and were the top doubles team in
the nation earlier this year.
