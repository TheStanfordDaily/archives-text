# Stanford crew set to row for Pac-10 title
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
It all comes down to this. The
Stanford men's and women's crew
teams will race in the Pacific 10
Conference championships this
weekend at Redwood Shores for
the right to compete in the NCAAs.
The Cardinal women enter the
tournament seeded second, having
gone undefeated in their dual
meets this season. In its last race,
the Cardinal crushed California,
beating the Golden Bears by 25 sec
onds and setting a course record in
the process. This Saturday, Stan
ford expects to see more of the
same.
"Things have been going pretty
well," said senior Leah Meagher.
"Our guys are ready."
The Stanford squad will face off

against seventh-seeded Oregon in
its first race. Most likely the Cardi
nal will then meet Washington
State, a team that has raced closely
with Stanford this season. The two
teams split the season series, with
the Cardinal winning the last meet
by three seconds. A win over the
Cougars would propel Stanford
into the conference final, probably
against top-seeded Washington.
The Cardinal also has its eye on
the NCAAs. The top three teams
from the Pac-10 qualify, so by beat
ing Washington State, Stanford
would secure a place in the nation
al tournament.
"If we stay relaxed and row our
race, we will qualify for the final,"
said coach Ainiee Baker.
If it qualifies for the Pac-10
final, the Cardinal would have to
race exceptionally well in order to
challenge the Huskies for the con
ference championship.
"Our chances are good," said se
nior captain Kara Johnson. "It's a
matter of who wants the race
more."
The Stanford men's team will
face a slightly more uphill battle in
its quest to qualify for nationals.
The fourth-seeded Cardinal squad
will square off against fifth-seeded
Gonzaga in the opening round. The
Stanford men are coming off a
course record-setting performance
of their own, although it came in a
losing effort against Cal. The Car
dinal hopes for the same effort but
different results this weekend.
"It is quite open," said coach
Wieslaw Kujda. "Four boats which
are basically a boat length apart
from each other — I'm looking for
big surprises."
If Stanford defeats Gonzaga in
the first round, it would most likely
face top-seeded Washington in the
semifinals. Defeating the Huskies

would send the Cardinal to the con
ference final and automatically
qualify the team for nationals. A
loss to Washington would elimi
nate Stanford from conference
championship contention, though
the men would still have a chance
to qualify for nationals. They
would probably face Oregon State
or possibly Cal in the consolation
race.
Earlier this season, Stanford
traveled to Oregon State and suf
fered a lackluster performance
against the Beavers in rough
weather conditions. Hut if qualify
ing for nationals comes down to the
race against Oregon State, the Car
dinal will be sure to show up.
"This time around, our tech
nique has improved dramatically
along with our feel of the boat,"
said senior captain Rob Bigler.
"The added confidence would guar
antee a better performance on our
part."
Both the men's and women's
squads have a trip to nationals on
their minds, and both remain con
fident that it can happen.
"We will be ready," Kujda said.
"If somebody doesn't think we
have any more cards in our deck,
then thev are mistaken.
