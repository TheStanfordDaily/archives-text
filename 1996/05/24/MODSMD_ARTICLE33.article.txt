It all comes down to this. The
Stanford men's and women's crew
teams will race in the Pacific 10
Conference championships this
weekend at Redwood Shores for
the right to compete in the NCAAs.
The Cardinal women enter the
tournament seeded second, having
gone undefeated in their dual
meets this season. In its last race,
the Cardinal crushed California,
beating the Golden Bears by 25 sec
onds and setting a course record in
the process. This Saturday, Stan
ford expects to see more of the
same.
"Things have been going pretty
well," said senior Leah Meagher.
"Our guys are ready."
The Stanford squad will face off

against seventh-seeded Oregon in
its first race. Most likely the Cardi
nal will then meet Washington
State, a team that has raced closely
with Stanford this season. The two
teams split the season series, with
the Cardinal winning the last meet
by three seconds. A win over the
Cougars would propel Stanford
into the conference final, probably
against top-seeded Washington.
The Cardinal also has its eye on
the NCAAs. The top three teams
from the Pac-10 qualify, so by beat
ing Washington State, Stanford
would secure a place in the nation
al tournament.
"If we stay relaxed and row our
race, we will qualify for the final,"
said coach Ainiee Baker.
