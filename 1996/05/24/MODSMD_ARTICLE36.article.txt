# A 						fuzzie's odyssey
## 
### 
A fuzzie at Job (Connection Day is like a tan
gerine in a shoe store: Absolutely nothing
fits.
Last Wednesday, Tresidder Union was filled
with a plethora of business-types wearing "1 lello!
My name is..name tags stuck to their suit
jackets and student-types wearing "Hello! This is
my cleanest shirt" smiles stuck on their faces.
They schmoozed, they laughed, they shook
hands, they kissed babies. They kissed ass. All in
the hopes of finding someone who would give
them not only a cubicle, but a weekly paycheck
with lots of zeros in it. And use of the company
car. And the resort down in the (Caymans. And
stock options. And opportunities for promotion.
1, however, am a fuzzie ... and I just wanted
the cubicle.
And 1 only wanted to borrow it for the sum
mer. No lifetime commitment. No dental plan. 1
just wanted someone to walk up to me and say:
"Jeremy, you know that thing you do . . . |insert
marketable skill here 1.. . I'd like you to do it in a
cubicle at my office this summer." 1 mean, after
all. I had taken the first step I dragged my lit
tle tangerine ass up that circular staircase wear
ing a casual, yet sensible, outfit and way too
much after-shave. Heck. I had even bought
resume paper the night before. Who wouldn't
want to hire a motivated, self-starter like that?
And, after all, I do go to Stanford.
But as I rolled into Oak West 1 knew that this
Job Fair was just another techie party that I
wasn't invited to. Nearly every company in the
room had the letters "micro-" or "compu-" or "-
tec" or "Hewlett somewhere in its name, embla
zoned on three-color brochures with pictures of
computers and microchips scattered in a graphi
cally-innovative, yet aesthetically-pleasing lay
out. Kmployers sat behind every desk waiting to

snatch up Stanford techies — the few, the elite,
the employable. I decided to swallow my fear of
these fuzziephobes and see if they had a job for
me. I leaned over to check out a brochure and the
woman behind the desk stood up.
"Hi. I'm [insert techie-sounding female name
here| from MicroCompuTec Industries. Can I
help you?"
This was my chance. Someone wanted to help
me. She wanted to give me a job. A multimillion
dollar contract. A spot on the board of directors.
My own (gulp) cubicle! I carefully cleared my
throat (almost choking on the pride I had just
swallowed) and flashed her my "hire-me" smile.
"Hi, my name is 1 insert "Jeremy Desman " here\.
I am a public policy major here at Stanford and 1
was wondering— "
"Sorry, we're looking for engineering majors:
EE, ME, Computer Science. Hut it sure was nice
to meet you! Here, take a ball-point pen!" She
clicked it a few times and the words "Send
resume to www.technobabble.com" scrolled
through its tiny little window like a player piano.
Four pens, three highlighters, a Slinky and a
yo-yo later, my "hire-me" smile was slowly
becoming a "bite-me" glare. No one in that room
was planning on hiring me. My corporate hopes
were disappearing rapidly. The reality of my job
lessness hit me as 1 walked up to the Sun
Microsystems table. The man smiled and started
to push his chair back toextend a firm, yet trust
ing. handshake, hut I spoke first. "Hi, don't both
er standing up . . . uh..." (I read his name tag.)
". . . Jim. Look, I'm not in the mood. I'd tell you
my name but you don't care. I'm a fuzzie and
therefore have no redeeming social value in your
eyes. What 1 want is one of those cool, blue,
squishy balloon stress-ball things you've got
there. Don't get up, I'll just take one myself."

"OK," he said, bewildered. I took two. He
looked at me like I was from another planet. 1
could have sworn I heard him mutter under his
breath, "Damn fuzzies."
I walked out of the room with nine pens, five
highlighters, two stress-halls, one Slinky, one vo
yo, zero prospective jobs and a remarkable
amount of negative self-worth. Another day in
the life of a fuzzie.
As I left Tresidder, I looked down at my sen
sible, yet business-minded, leather binder and
counted the resumes inside. ()nlv three less than
I had walked in with. I pulled one out and looked
it over. My name, my address, my phone num
ber. I read on. What was wrong with those peo
ple? I mean, with this resume, I would certainly
hire me. Look at those active verbs! Look at
those margins! Look at that watermark! Who
were they to tell me that I wasn't what thev were
looking for?! Who were they to tell me that / was
the tangerine?! If anything, they were the tan
gerines! I'm marketable! I have self-worth! No
job, but dammit, I have self-worth!
1 looked back at the rest of the ass-kissers
inside Tresidder and laughed to myself. 1 didn't
need them. I was a fuzzie and I was proud of
it. 1 didn't need a reliable source of income or a
business card to prove that I was worth some
thing! I put my resumes back into my binder and
pulled my new yo-yo out of my pocket. 1 walked
away, jobless, and did a loop-de-loop for all to see.
