# Move of Saroyan papers irks writer's family, Cal
## 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
Despite Stanford's warm welcome,
William Saroyan may still rest uneasily
among the shelves of Green Library Special
Collections.
Family members and UC-Berkeley offi
cials expressed disappointment yesterday
over William Saroyan Foundation Presi
dent Robert Setrakian's decision to move
the late author's entire collection to Stan
ford. Much of the collection is currently on

deposit at UC-Berkeley's Bancroft Library.
"I'm very disappointed that the move
has been made," said Ruben Saroyan, a
cousin of the late author. "(The archives]
could have been brought to Fresno, where
(Saroyan] was born."
When Saroyan died 15 years ago, it was
his wish that his entire collection end up in
the same place. The archives are composed
of literary papers and 1,200 boxes of per
sonal effects.
Bancroft Library received the initial
offer to accept the whole collection. It

turned down the opportunity because of the
volume of Saroyan's personal items but
took in many literary items, Setrakian said.
Saroyan's personal items were placed at
California State University at Fresno, the
Fresno Metropolitan Museum and at his
various homes in Paris, New York and Mal
ibu, Calif.
"The original arrangement was that we
would keep the literary papers," said Ban
croft Library Director Charles Faulhaber.
"Other materials would go to Fresno State
in hopes that a Saroyan museum would

keep them."
Recently both Cal State-Fresno and the
Fresno Metropolitan Museum told the
foundation they needed the storage space
back. Setrakian, the executor of Saroyan's
estate, considered various universities and
ultimately decided on Stanford.
"I had the dilemma of trying to find a
place for all this," Setrakian said. "Saroyan
wanted to keep his collection intact, and it
was my job to do that."

"The thing that most dis
tressed us was that there was no
prior contact by the foundation or
Stanford concerning this arrange
ment," Bancroft's Faulhaber said.
"It's simply a part of professional
etiquette among libraries."
Bancroft Library has asked its
university lawyers to look into the

situation.
Setrakian said he felt that UC-
Berkeley had lost its chance the
first time around and simply
didn't deserve a second chance.
"How many times do you offer
something to someone when they
turn it down?" Setrakian said.
"They had already made it
clear they were only interested in
part of the collection."
However, Faulhaber said Ban
croft "would have been very inter
ested in accepting the entire col

lection. We were simply not given
the opportunity."
"It fits with the other materials
we have," Faulhaber said. "I don't
believe that [Green Library] has
the same depth and breadth [of
California history!. It makes sense
that it goes here."
Ruben Saroyan said he felt that
loyalty to an alma mater played a
large part in Setrakian's decision.
Setrakian graduated from Stan
ford in 1949.
"It's detrimental. What ties

does Setrakian have [to Stanford]
other than (being an) alumnus?"
Saroyan said. "Is there something
behind it that we haven't heard
about? We don't know, and it's dis
couraging."
Setrakian discredited that as
sertion.
"I don't have any responsibility
to the University of California,
and I don't have any responsibility
to Stanford either," Saroyan said.
"My responsibility is to the Saroy
an Foundation. Just bv chance, I

happen to be an alumnus of Stan
ford."
Ruben Saroyan said the Saroy
an family has had disagreements
with the William Saroyan Founda
tion in the past regarding the exe
cution of Saroyan's will.
"Nobody has followed through
on Bill's will to the word," Saroyan
said. "Everything being done is
against his will."
Setrakian argued that family
members did not have their facts
straight.

"Baloney," he said. "The fact is,
it's in the will."
There is currently no commu
nication between the family and
the foundation, according to
Saroyan.
Meanwhile, University Librari
an Michael Keller said, "Stanford
is delighted to have received a do
nation of the William Saroyan col
lection."
Portions of the archives are al
ready in the process of being
moved.

William Saroyan may still rest uneasily
