# Move of Saroyan papers irks writer's family, Cal

Despite Stanford's warm welcome,
William Saroyan may still rest uneasily
among the shelves of Green Library Special
Collections.
Family members and UC-Berkeley offi
cials expressed disappointment yesterday
over William Saroyan Foundation Presi
dent Robert Setrakian's decision to move
the late author's entire collection to Stan
ford. Much of the collection is currently on

deposit at UC-Berkeley's Bancroft Library.
"I'm very disappointed that the move
has been made," said Ruben Saroyan, a
cousin of the late author. "(The archives]
could have been brought to Fresno, where
(Saroyan] was born."
When Saroyan died 15 years ago, it was
his wish that his entire collection end up in
the same place. The archives are composed
of literary papers and 1,200 boxes of per
sonal effects.
Bancroft Library received the initial
offer to accept the whole collection. It

turned down the opportunity because of the
volume of Saroyan's personal items but
took in many literary items, Setrakian said.
Saroyan's personal items were placed at
California State University at Fresno, the
Fresno Metropolitan Museum and at his
various homes in Paris, New York and Mal
ibu, Calif.
"The original arrangement was that we
would keep the literary papers," said Ban
croft Library Director Charles Faulhaber.
"Other materials would go to Fresno State
in hopes that a Saroyan museum would

keep them."
Recently both Cal State-Fresno and the
Fresno Metropolitan Museum told the
foundation they needed the storage space
back. Setrakian, the executor of Saroyan's
estate, considered various universities and
ultimately decided on Stanford.
"I had the dilemma of trying to find a
place for all this," Setrakian said. "Saroyan
wanted to keep his collection intact, and it
was my job to do that."
