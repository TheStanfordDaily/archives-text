# Jaramillo: A man for all seasons
## Sophomore balances responsibilities as a Theta Delt and a member of SEAS 
### Jessica Lehman Contributing writer 
The phrase "frat boy" usually conjures up
images of young men swilling beer more often
than images of young men saving the world.
Tom Jaramillo does a little of both.
As a sophomore straddling the two spheres
of Theta Delta Chi fraternity and Students for
Environmental Action at Stanford, Jaramillo
said he feels equally comfortable in both set
tings. "People in [Theta Delt] never chide me
for being an environmentalist or for being in
SEAS."
People in SEAS, he said, equally respect his
fraternity membership, although they tease
him about it. "It's definitely a source of humor.
They joke about it a lot."
His frat brothers, in turn, like to ask him
about his activities with SEAS. "People defi
nitely know that I'm the one in the house who
will be fighting for recycling and stuff like that.
"When you have your foot in two different
worlds, it's really tough to focus and just stick
with the same crowd," Jaramillo said. He likes
to watch movies or go to parties with fellow
Theta Delts, yet he also goes backpacking or
camping with other SEAS members. "I totally
enjoy who I am," he said.
Jaramillo participated in an environmental
club in high school in San Juan, Puerto Rico, so
he decided to join SEAS during his first year at
Stanford. He said he likes the all-encompassing
view SEAS holds of the world.
"It's not just about human rights, it's not
just about keeping the environment clean or
raising the standard of living," he said. "It's
about having a world in which everyone gets

along with each other and with the environ
ment."
Jaramillo has recently been working on the
SEAS campaign for investment responsibility.
He explained that SEAS wants Stanford to
take a more active role at shareholders' meet
ings for companies in which it owns stocks and
bonds.

People definitely know that
I'm the one in the house who
will be fighting for recycling
and stuff like that. When you
have your foot in two different
worlds, it's really tough to
focus and just stick with the
same crowd.'

Jaramillo said that currently SEAS suggests
to Stanford which way to vote on each major
issue, but the organization foresees a larger,
more comprehensive system in which Stanford
votes regularly on a variety of issues. "What
we're doing is proposing a plan to restructure
the way investment responsibility is done at
Stanford," Jaramillo said.
Jaramillo spends some of his time obtaining
support from students for these efforts, and he
often passes petitions around his fraternity.
His housemates ask him questions about envi

ronmental issues, and he said he appreciates
their interest. He said he loves living in a fra
ternity house and even ended up being house
manager this year.
Jaramillo never thought he wanted to join a
fraternity, but his friends convinced him to
rush anyway, and he liked what he saw at
Theta Delt. "This house really impressed me
because there was no image whatsoever. There
was no stereotype. No one would expect me to
do anything that was not me."
He said initially he worried about having the
"frat boy" image attached to him, but he has not
encountered negative reactions when he has
told people that he is a Theta Delt. He said he has
a good time with and greatly respects everyone
in the house. "It's definitely a fun place to be."
In addition to stretching himself between
his fraternity and his environmental activism,
Jaramillo finds time to tutor with East Palo
Alto Tennis and Tutoring.
Jaramillo said he tutors "a very bright kid
who definitely has not had the same education
al opportunities [as other people]. I try to give
him as much confidence as I can because I
know he's going to be up against a lot. Tutoring
definitely makes me feel good."
Jaramillo also participates in sports ranging
from basketball to mountain biking and pur
sues his major, chemical engineering.
"As an engineer, I feel like I could do a lot of
good," he said. "I see myself solving problems.
After I've done a lot to help the planet, to solve
real-world problems, I'd love to go back to high
school and teach AP chemistry."
"It's all about balance. I love Mark Twain's
quote: 'Don't let schooling get in the way of
your education.' I just love that."
