Satan wasn't always evil, scholar Elaine
Pagels told a standing-room only crowd last
night in Cubberley Auditorium.
Pagels, a Princeton University professor of re
ligion, delivered her speech, titled "Satan and All
His Angels," to an audience of about 550. Many
late arrivals found themselves standingor sitting
in the aisles of Cubberley, which can seat about
400 people.
Pagels, a Stanford alumna, discussed how
early dissident groups of Jews predating Christ
began to transform ideas of the devil from a
rarely mentioned angel — a sort of "prosecuting
attorney" in God's court — into God's antagonist
and rival. She said such representations are
prevalent in today's society.
"When you look at all the stories of Satan,"
Pagels said, "they all agree on one thing: This

greatest enemy did not originate as an outsider
or stranger. On the contrary, he is an intimate
angel who became unexpectedly hostile and dan
gerous. "
These dissident groups, by transforming the
image of Satan, were then able to say that the
majority groups of Jews had turned against the
ways of God, like Satan, Pagels said.
"They claimed that the majority of Israel had
been seduced by the power of evil," she said.
This idea that the devil was present in one's
enemies was then adopted by Christians and
later on by Muslims, Pagels said.
In the four Christian gospels of Mark,
Matthew, Luke and John, Pagels said, the writ
ers transformed traditional alien enemies into
intimate enemies to link these intimate enemies
with the devil. She cited the example of how in
the gospel of Matthew, Jesus fled to Egypt to es
cape the Hebrew king Herod. Pagels said this was
a reversal of the situation presented in the He

brew Bible, where Egypt is a representation of
oppression of the Hebrew people.
"If'you look at the gospels as a case history of
the early Christian movement," Pagels said,
"you see that the movement became increasing
ly gentile, and as it did, its depictions of Jesus'
[Jewishl enemies turned more and more hos
tile."
Pagels emphasized that this does not mean
that Christians invented anti-Semitism, as some
claim. She also said that this is only one side of
Christianity.
"This is a one-sided look at an aspect of Chris
tian tradition that many of us had not paid any
attention to," she said.
She also said such representations of one's en
emies as satanic continue in Christian and Is
lamic culture today. She pointed to statements
by Saddam Hussein and President Bush during
the Gulf War in which they referred to each other
as satanic.
