# CSRE plan headed for review
## H&S committee will review proposal June 4, Camarillo says 
### Dana Hangai Contributing writer 
The Humanities and Sciences Curriculum Com
mittee will review a proposal for the Comparative
Studies in Race and Ethnicity program June 4, and
CSRE should be high on the Faculty Senate's fall
quarter agenda, History Prof. A 1 Camarillo said in an
informational discussion last night.
When the CSRE proposal was first submitted to the
Humanities and Sciences committee, it requested that
the curriculum design committee, which is chaired by
Camarillo, integrate the original proposals into a sin
gle submission.
Because some of the proposals for the program's
majors had different guidelines and requirements, the
curriculum committee requested that they be unified
to use the same language and standards, according to
Camarillo.
"What they're saying is that they want to be able to
review an entire package of an entire group of majors
and minors in a single study," Camarillo said.
Camarillo cited the tightness of the timeline and
changes in the stated goals of the curriculum commit
tee as major factors in delaying the approval of the
program, which was originally slated to begin fall
quarter.
"Originally, we were not supposed to submit an in
tegrated proposal," Camarillo said. "So now we're
back to reformatting" in order to comply with the cur
riculum committee's requirements.
After the proposal is approved by the curriculum
committee, it will be submitted by Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences John Shoven to the sen

ate's Committee on Undergraduate Studies. If the
program is authorized, it will be sent to the senate's
steering committee, which will decide whether to put
it to a vote fall quarter.
Concerned by the University's recent cutbacks in
interdisciplinary programs, sophomore Angela Parker
asked if the University can commit to supporting
CSRE in the future.
Camarillo cited faculty interest as an important de
termining factor in the program's survival.
"The first question they j the University] will ask is
how involved are the faculty with the task," Camarillo
said. "In this case, you have a lot of committed faculty
who want to start something new, but what will hap
pen in 10 years?"
Camarillo also discussed some of CSRE's proposed
requirements. Currently, any prospective majors
must take two courses in an introductory core and
four focus classes in a CSRE major. In their senior
year, all majors will also be required to take a senior
"capstone seminar." The proposed CSRE majors will
all require 60 units to complete.
Senior Kris Hayashi, a student representative on
the curriculum committee, said it is difficult to predict
how the CSRE program will turn out in the future.
"I think it's hard to say how their progress Is, be
cause so much of it depends on what happens at the
Faculty Senate and what the committees decide to
do," she said. "However, I think what the committee
has done in asking for clarification of the affiliation of,
say, Native American Studies, is a positive contribu
tion."
Camarillo cited the importance
of student support in creating the
program.
"Much of this came from stu
dent voices," Camarillo said. "Most
universities on the West Coast do
have majors in this area. Stanford
is coming very late to the game, but
because it's late in entering this in
tellectual development, it's drawn
a lot of interest from people who
have taught these types of courses
for 20 years."
