## Vigil remembers victims of AIDS 
### Victoria Foster Contributing writer 
Twelve people gathered last
night at the Claw for a candlelight
vigil in memory of AIDS victims
and a march to the Oval for a po
etry reading. The march was part
of AIDS Awareness Week, put on
every year by the "Stanford AIDS
Volunteer Education" class of
fered through the Psychology De
partment.
Junior Angela Amarillas, one
of the organizers of the event,
said she planned the vigil so peo
ple could "take time out" to think
about the disease.
"AIDS Awareness Week is ob
served outside of Stanford too,"
Amarillas said. A vigil will be held
in San Francisco Sunday.
Freshman Stephanie Enyart,
another of the organizers, said
she developed her interest in
AIDS prevention before she came
to Stanford through her work
with an organization which em
phasized AIDS education. Main
ly, she said, she has stayed in
volved with AIDS education be
cause of the people she has known
who are dying of the disease.
Graduate student Mark Lel
louch, who is not in theclass, said,
"I have a feeling that people don't

realize how close it might get to
them and their families. They see
it as somebody else's problem.
Until it's acceptable to have it,
people with AIDS will be in hid
ing. Our culture emphasizes hav
ing control, and everything going
well. It's unacceptable to have
your life in disorder."
The group stood in a circle, lit
their candles one by one and
walked silently and slowly to the
Oval. When the wind rose and
blew out several of the candles,
Amarillas commented, "We
might just have to carry the flame
in our hearts until we get down
there."
Of the march, Lellouch com
mented, "I just wish it was a little
bit darker!"
Another organizer complained
that the Coffee House had put a
damper on plans to publicize the
event. The group had planned to
place candles and fliers with in
formation about the disease on
many of the tables in the Coffee
House.
"They originally gave us per
mission to do it, and now they're
being lame," said junior Madeline
Tregidga.
The Coffee House manager
said fire codes would allow only
two candles, Tregidga said.
