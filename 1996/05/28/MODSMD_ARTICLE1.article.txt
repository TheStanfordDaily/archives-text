Stanford Police were called to the scene of Mela
'96, Stanford's annual South Asian American variety
show, Sunday evening after repeated disturbances in
the audience, during which unknown persons hit one
of the show's coordinators on the head.
Student singers, dancers, models and actors per
formed for a nearly sold-out crowd at Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium for the event put on by Sanskriti, Stanford's
Indian organization.
Throughout the evening's performances, there
was some raucous behavior in the audience, according
to Stanford Police Sgt. David Lee.
"There was a group of five to seven individuals that
were a bit boisterous, making lewd comments toward
those performing," said Lee, who was called in to han
dle the situation.
At the end of the show, after Bhangra dancers fin
ished performing, they followed tradition and invited
the audience to participate in a Bhangra dance on the
stage. According to Lee, this is apparently when the
group's behavior got out of hand.
"They tried to get on the stage. The individual run
ning the production didn't want them on the stage.
They got on the stage," Lee said. "Somehow, some
where, the person in charge of the show, was struck
on the head once by unknown suspects while his back
was turned. He declined any medical treatment. He
sustained one strike to the right side of his head. We
are in the process of writing a battery case against this
individual."
Both Sanskriti officers and Stanford security offi
cers present at the event declined to comment on the
disturbance, although earlier in the evening Masum
Momaya, one of the Mela coordinators, explained the
purpose of having security present at the event.
"We just have security as a precautionary mea
sure," she said. "The San Francisco Bay Area has had
trouble with Indian gangs in the
past."
Before the disturbance, audi
ence members enjoyed perfor
mances by a variety of traditional
and contemporary Indian acts.
The audience was first enter
tained by an Indian parody of the
television show "ER." "The skits
make fun of Indian culture alto
gether," said Angel Rampal, cul
tural chair of Sanskriti.
Later, models wearing clothing
from India — from traditional
saris to contemporary suits —
graced the catwalk for the fashion
show. Their clothes came from
their own collections.
Dances performed during the
evening included the Kurathi, a
gypsy folk dance; Bharatnatyam,
a classical dance originating in
South India; Raas, a folk dance
that implements sticks and
Bhangra, Mela's grand finale.

Between performances, Mela
emcees Monisha Bajaj and Raja
Jagadeesan said Sanskriti was
given an honorable mention for
the Saturn Award this year by the
dean of students and director of
student activities.
Sanskriti earned the honorable
mention for turning the organiza
tion around after some trouble
last year, they said.
While Momaya would not
comment on the disturbance, she
did comment on the evening
overall.
"It went really well," she said.
"I'm glad a lot of people participat
ed. We just wanted more and more
people to get involved in the Indi
an community."
The funds raised by Mela will
be donated to Northside Commu
nity Center in San Jose, which
sponsors programs to help Indian
senior citizens ease into American
culture.
Anyone who attended Mela and
has information regarding the at
tack should contact the Stanford
Police at 723-9633.
