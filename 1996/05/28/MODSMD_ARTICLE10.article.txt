# Committee to examine primary-care education
## 
### Adam Kemezis Staff writer 
How to teach medical students the basics
of primary care is one of the biggest unan
swered questions at the School of Medicine. A
recently appointed faculty committee plans
to consider possible answers.
The committee of 14 was appointed by the
Medical School's Faculty Senate, and Assoc.
Medicine Prof. Gabriel Garcia, who will chair
the committee, said he hopes to have a report
by the end of the year.
Asst. Dean of Medical Education Marc
Nelson said there is an increasing shortage of
primary-care physicians just as their role is
growing in medicine.
He added that this shortage is reflected in
the problem of teaching primary-care skills.
"There aren't enough faculty members to
go round," he explained.
"Medical students often get a skewed view
of what medicine is all about," Nelson said,
because their education tends to focus on
more advanced and specialized aspects and
does not sufficiently emphasize what makes
up most of the day-to-day work of a physician.
The committee will actually examine two
related questions. One is how to teach prima
ry care; the other is how to arrange faculty

workloads and salary structure to make
teaching easier.
"The school has never really defined its
mission in primary care," said Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman. Holman is in charge of find
ing a director for the Center for Primary Care
Policy Research and Education, a planned
center which he hopes will "define for the
school the academic responsibilities we have
in primary care."
Holman's center is one thing the commit
tee will look at in its efforts to find the best
teaching methods. Another is the clerkship in
faculty medicine program, taught by Assoc.
Medicine Prof. Samuel Leßaron.
Leßaron's program gives students four
weeks of classroom and clinical training in
family practice. Nelson highly praised
Leßaron and the clerkship.
"He's winning practically every teaching
award we offer," Nelson said. "To have a pri
mary-care physician do that is something
unique."
The second set of issues the committee will
address is the unique problems faced by pri
mary-care physicians.
Because they are not paid as much as spe
cialists, Nelson explained, primary-care
physicians have to devote more time to clini
cal work in order to maintain their income,

which inevitably clashes with their teaching
needs. This compounds the problems caused
by the overall shortage of primary-care physi
cians.
Garcia said there are three directions his
committee might consider. The first is to sug
gest the Medical School set aside some of its
money for subsidy of primary-care teaching.
Another option is to have Stanford Health
Services, which is in charge of clinical opera
tions, divert some of the money it gets from
fees and insurers to a fund for primary-care
teaching.
A third possibility is that outside physi
cians will volunteer time for teaching, thus
allowing faculty more time for clinical work.
Garcia said he dislikes this option because it
involves outside doctors doing the work of
faculty and faculty doing the work of outside
doctors.
Garcia was confident, however, that the
committee will come up with a constructive
solution beyond defining the problem.
Nelson, however, noted that the solution
is not likely to be simple because primary care
is a combination of several disciplines, includ
ing general practice, internal medicine and
gynecology.
"There isn't going to be one solution; there
are going to be many solutions," Nelson said.
