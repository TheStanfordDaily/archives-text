Cease-fire negotiated for Chechnya
MOSCOW (AP) — President Boris Yeltsin
negotiated a cease-fire to the war in Chechnya in
his first meeting with the rebels' leader yesterday,
breaking a months-long deadlock and bolstering
his campaign for re-election.
The agreement between Yeltsin and rebel lead
er Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev calls for fighting in the
breakaway republic to end Saturday.
But it was unclear whether the accord will lead
to the end of the 17-month war, which has killed
an estimated 30,000 people and reduced much of
Chechnya to rubble.
Chechnya's independence — the question at
the root of the insurgency — has been put off for
later discussion. And there is cause to doubt
whether Russia's military will honor a negotiated
truce.
Yeltsin and Yandarbiyev assured one another
that their generals would adhere to the agreement.
"We decided the main question: peace in Chech
nya," Yeltsin was quoted by the ITAR-Tass news
agency as saying after the agreement was signed
by Yandarbiyev and Russian Prime Minister Vik
tor Chernomyrdin.
Yandarbiyev, dressed in military camouflage

and a tall sheepskin hat, said on leaving for
Moscow earlier in the day, "We come to suggest to
the Russian side that the war be stopped and the
troops withdrawn."
Almost $2 billion in taxes lost
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government has
lost almost $'2 billion this year because it isn't col
lecting industry taxes that died due to haggling
between Congress and the White House. The loss
es are mounting daily.
Beneficiaries range from petroleum and chem
ical companies, no longer paying millions into the
Superfund for toxic waste cleanup, to airline pas
sengers saving a few bucks each after a federal tax
on air tickets expired.
Two other environmental taxes have lapsed.
One hit gasoline and other fuels to pay for pollu
tion from leaking underground storage tanks, and
the other targeted crude oil to finance cleanups of
major oil spills.
The government stopped collecting Superfund
taxes in January because lawmakers were unable
to fashion a compromise on reauthorizing the
toxic cleanup law acceptable to the Clinton admin
istration.
