# Fire occurred on ValuJet
## Recorder also shows passengers did not get oxygen 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Six
minutes into the doomed ValuJet
Flight 592, the cockpit door
opened and there was conversa
tion about fire in the passenger
cabin, the plane's voice recorder
indicated yesterday.
Robert Francis, vice chairman
of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said the passengers
also had problems getting oxygen
before the plane crashed in the
Florida Everglades, killing all
aboard.
"It appears that the cockpit
door opened," Francis told a news
conference. "There were verbal
indications from the cockpit there
was fire in the passenger cabin.
There was also an indication from
the cabin that there were prob
lems obtaining oxygen."
Francis said the tape contains
30 minutes of recorded material,
the normal capacity. He said the
tape is in good shape but the sound

quality is poor and is "very, very
difficult to decipher."
Francis said a group of experts
are listening to the tape but added,
"At this stage we have not had the
opportunity to do enough work on
the tape to say how much help it's
going to be."
"It's not going to be a question
of hours but of days" before the
experts know if there is more to be
learned from the tape, he said.
Earlier, in Miami, NTSB
spokesman Mike Benson said of
the voice recorder: "It takes time
to handle and get information out
of it and experts need to sit down
and listen to it very carefully. We
want to make sure we know what
we have."
Benson said the black box
found in the Everglades muck on
Sunday was in good condition, but
could not say if it may have gaps
because of loss of power on the DC
9.

The data recorder — found two
days after the crash that killed 110
passengers and crew — stopped 50
seconds before the flight ended.
A police diver had found the
elusive voice recorder Sunday just
before the searching was to be sus
pended because of an approaching
thunderstorm. The outer case of
the recorder was damaged by the
impact but was intact.
The tape could provide details
on what happened in the cockpit as
the planed nose-dived into the
swampy Everglades, as well as
other sounds that could indicate
what went so wrong with the DC
9.
Taped conversations from the
airport control towers indicated
there was smoke in the cockpit.
Investigators said Sunday that fire
damage had been found on an alu
minum frame of a passenger seat,
indicating flames had reached into
the cabin.
