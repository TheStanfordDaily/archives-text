Preference system for
Draw should guarantee
one year of top housing

ALL ACROSS THE Stanford
campus Saturday, undergrad
uates (but not seniors) awoke
surprisingly early for a weekend
morning, and they all had one spe
cific and important goal in mind.
When Axess opened at 9 a.m. that
day, it contained the much-antici
pated and ofl-discussed results of
the 1996 Undergraduate Housing
Draw; the early-rising students
wanted to know where they'd be liv
ing next year.
In many respects, the results of
the Draw were unsurprising: Bob
and Storey went first and assorted
Stern and Wilbur houses went last,
as always. But in other ways, times
are changing. This year's seniors,
for example, were members of the
first Stanford class to be guaran
teed, upon their admission, four
years of on-campus housing. As that
group graduates, the University
should consider reworking the sys
tem of preferred and unpreferred
housing years which sprung up with
that class.
Prior to the Class of '96, stu
dents were guaranteed only three
years of on-campus housing includ
ing their frosh year. In their one
unguaranteed year, they drew from
the highest batch of numbers. If a
student's unguaranteed draw num
ber was low enough, and if enough
housing was available, he or she
would receive on-campus but less
than-luxurious housing. With a
number too high, the student
would be left to find his or her own
place to live.
When the University began guar
anteeing four years of housing, the
real distinction between guaranteed
and unguaranteed numbers neces
sarily disappeared. In its place, a
contrived distinction between pre
ferred and unpreferred numbers

was created. A student drawing for
undergraduate housing receives two
preferred and one unpreferred year.
In all three of those years, the stu
dent will end up in University hous
ing somewhere, but in the one
unpreferred year he or she must
draw from a higher pool of numbers.
The ostensible purpose of this
system is to ensure that all students
will reside in the University's more
coveted housing for at least some of
his or her time at Stanford. Unfor
tunately, the system does not seem
to work as intended.
The difference between housing
which draws 1,800, for example, and
that which draws 2,200 is fairly
insignificant in terms of living con
ditions. They are very different,
however, in that one is preferred and
the other unpreferred. A more sig
nificant change in housing quality
occurs not at 2,000 but around
1,000.
With that in mind, it would make
far more sense to have a draw sys
tem in which students have only one
preferred year. A student drawing
preferred would receive a number
up to 1000, as opposed to the cur
rent two-years-below-2,000 system.
Such a system would ensure that
each Stanford student will have at
least one year in desirable housing
and will still have the opportunity to
draw into mid-range housing in the
two unpreferred years. The only
promise implicit in the current sys
tem is that each student will be rele
gated to truly bad housing for only
one year.
The distinction between guaran
teed and unguaranteed housing
years was an important one. If you
were unguaranteed, you might not
have had a place to live. The distinc
tion between preferred and unpre
ferred years, however, is an artificial
one. It serves only to protect stu
dents from the risk inherent in a
pure lottery: that some students
could draw very poorly all three
years. If there needs to be a mecha
nism to ensure that all students get
at least one year of good housing,
students using it should be assured
of actually getting good housing.
