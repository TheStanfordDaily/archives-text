Disabled students' center eviction not required by law

I would like to commend The Daily for
its balanced coverage of the Disabled
Students of Stanford Community
Center issue. However, Wednesday's and
Friday's articles both contained a glaring
factual inaccuracy that needs to be cor
rected.
In both articles, The Daily reported
that the removal of the Disabled Stu
dents of Stanford Community Center
from its current location in Meyer
Library was required by a federal man
date from the Office of Civil Rights. This
is not accurate. Additional office space,
services and staff for the Disability
Resource Center may be required by the
OCR mandate, but removing the Dis
abled Students of Stanford from their

community space is certainly not.
In fact, removing the Disabled Stu
dents of Stanford from its room without
providing a suitable replacement violates
federal laws. The Americans with Disabili
ties Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the
Educational Rehabilitation Act of 1973
require that a university make reasonable
accommodations to afford the disabled an
equal opportunity to participate in the
University's programs. Many experts on
disability law agree that these statutes
apply to both academic and extracurricu
lar activities. Lawyer Jeanne Kincaid, an
expert on disability rights issues who was
invited by Stanford earlier in the year to
address these issues, interprets equal
access to extracurricular activities as an

essential component of providing equal
opportunity under these laws.
With the lack of access for disabled stu
dents to Old Union, much of the Quad
and the science and engineering portion of
campus, which are exacerbated by exten
sive construction, many of my fellow dis
abled students are already unable to fully
access and participate in many campus
organizations. The Disabled Students of
Stanford community room constitutes a
reasonable accommodation under these
laws, which helps alleviate this lack of
access by offering disabled students
jivenues for obtaining leadership posi
tions, planning and implementing events,
discussing issues of concern and studying
the use of adaptive equipment.

I realize that the campus cannot be
made fully accessible overnight. However,
the Stanford community needs to know
that equal access extends to extracurricu
lar activities, as well as academics. If
accessibility concerns cannot be corrected
overnight, then Stanford University
should at least enhance its commitment
to the disabled community by providing
Disabled Students of Stanford with
another community room before the end
of spring quarter. It took almost a decade
to obtain this community room. This cor
nerstone of the disabled community
should not be removed without a suitable
replacement.
