# Much of Stanford off limits for disabled
## 
### 
I applaud the efforts of some disabled
students who took it upon themselves to
barricade the entrance to the History
Corner earlier this week.
During my first year as a non-tradi
tional transfer student, I contacted the
housing office to ask how my mother-in
law, who is unable to climb stairs and
was scheduled to arrive for a visit, might
use the bathroom. Since we live in a
two-story apartment at Escondido Vil
lage, our bathroom is upstairs. I was
told to put her in the car and drive her
to a public restroom — Tresidder Union
was specifically suggested — every time
she needed to use a bathroom.
As I was looking for things to do with
my in-laws, I visited the art museum
next to the Cummings Art Building and

realized that this building also would be
off limits to my mother-in-law. I asked
the volunteer docents how people who
can't climb steps visit the exhibits and
was told, "They don't." The docent said
she had once offered to help carry a visi
tor up the steps but was told to never do
it again because of potential legal liabili
ty.
A couple of weeks later I watched a
wheelchair-bound person sit outside
Cummings and ask a passerby to go
inside the building and get someone who
could go open the side door that would
allow her access.
These experiences happened to coin
cide with the assignment of a "spring
project" for my CIV class, so I decided
that sitting in a wheelchair with a video
camera to graphically describe the limi
tations to access that the Stanford envi
ronment presents would make a worth
while spring project. However, my TA
didn't agree — he thought my alterna-

tive idea, "The Age of Naturalism in
Art," would be more thought-provoking.
I took the chicken way out and got a
great grade on the topic he thought
would be interesting. I've never forgiven
myself.
