# Casper reacts to Mahood editorial and responses on campus
## 
### 
Upon my return from a University
business trip, I discovered the reprehen
sible attacks on Faculty Senate Chair
Gail Mahood in The Daily editorial of
May 20 and in the Greg Martellotto let
ter the following day. I grieve that Stan
ford students wrote and chose to print
such calumny, apparently judging it to

be an appropriate level of discourse for a
university. I am dispirited about Stan
ford's failure to convey that university
citizenship entails the obligation to pur
sue truth with rationality, intellectual
honesty and moral humility, not mind
less vitriol. Martellotto at least has
offered a public apology, though diluting
it with the intimation that his original
letter was misunderstood humor; The
Daily has yet to show any sense of
regret.
I find some encouragement in the
answering letters by students Marc
Goormastic and Janet Stemwedel. I
thank and commend the citizenship dis
played by them, and by faculty members
Rob Polhemus, Jeffrey Koseff, Mark
Zoback and Gavin Wright, who quickly
and publicly responded with the truth of
Mahood's honorable and distinguished
service.
