## Frosh and canned cheese 
### 
Recently, i found an essay
that I wrote freshmen year. Life,
or myself — I can't decide which —
has changed so much since then. My
story won't ever appear in "Approaching
Stanford." Instead, I pause for myself,
and stand within the moment.
Easy Cheese! Great on crackers! Deli
cious on hot dogs! Try it on tacos! Avail
able in: Cheddar, Sharp Cheddar, Ched
dar 'n' Bacon, and Nacho! Do! I! Always!
Speak! in! Exclamations!? Although I
may be a hyperactive frosh, I do not.
My voice is deeper now. I take naps.
I am merely quoting the ad copy on a
can of Easy Cheese. What's so special
about a cheese that squirts? For my
friends and I, Easy Cheese has become
mythical, transcending its lowly earthly
form and becoming a bonding tool.
For the most part, I've kept in contact
with friends from my freshman dorm. We
smile as we ride past each other on bikes.
Seriously, though, we've watched each
struggle and shimmy through life,
through friendship and fits of fighting.
Bonding can be best explained through
the sacred text of the can: Remove cap,
hold applicator tip close to food and
move slowly across food surface. For
best results, do not refrigerate.
Remove cap. We pried off the blue cap
with trepidation. When we arrived on the
first day, all of us were excited but scared.
We watched our parents leave. We orga
nized our rooms to perfection and then

waited. The doors stayed shut. Then, the
sound of one voice was a siren call.
Bjarne and I have promised to play
racquetball again — for the past two
years. The intention of affection is con
stant, but so is the external interference.
Demanding the planets to converge
seems more feasible
Hold applicator tip closc to food
and move slowly across food surface.
At first we played the name game. I'll
never forget the evening / morning we
first tasted the culinary delight known as
Easy Cheese. 2 a.m. Out comes the can of
cheese. We began with genteel cheesc-on
cracker eating. Then Froot Loops . . .
signs . . . message pads. Some even dared
to put the cheese straight into their
mouths, which is akin to looking straight
into the sun. I've only known these people
for a few weeks, but I feel as if 1 know
them for years. I reveal things with reck
less abandon; I trust them.
Michael, present at those proceedings
and purveyor of the cheese, told me that
he didn't really like me freshman year. I
shake my head, thinking of my foibles, and
my struggles to grow. Ironically, he and I
are now close friends. I realize that we all
stumbled toward understanding: no easy
process. And after reaching those levels of
comfort, we become more independent.
We don't spend as much time together.
Ixiter, our conversation topics became
more serious. We discussed everything
from communism to cartoons, a topic in

which every Stanfordite is oddly well
versed.
Later, I learned how much more there
was to know; the joys and the sorrows
that aren't easily shared, that come only
after a deeper trust grows.
For best results, do not refriger
ate. Toasty cheer blows through these
halls, not cold indifference. And so the
warm fuzzy feeling imparted from Easy
Cheese begins to squirt. In the first week,
1 used to say "I'm going back to the
dorm." Now I say "I'm going home."
Freshman year, I wondered how to
keep in touch with people who lived else
where. When my draw group was split, I
remember feeling tragic. But it all
worked out, though never quite like I
imagined.
College is a unique time for bonding.
The real world looms on the horizon, for
sure, but for now all is well.
Well, the real world was always upon us
— we just didn't realize it. I try to remem
ber the preciousness as I pass through the
moment. Someone once said that "Only
poets and madmen can know the beauty of
life." The rest of us am only try.
