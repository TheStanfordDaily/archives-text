## Blue skies, white clouds, red sunsets and yellow suns

Why is the sky blue?
A All year long, people have been
•asking me this question, and I've
• been avoiding writing an article
about it all year long because every time I
explain it, no one remembers and then they
come back and ask me again the next week.
So, ask me next week.
Just kidding. I'll explain it, I guess.
The first thing to understand is that
there's a lot of air in the sky. Every direc
tion you look in the sky, there's got to be at
least a few hundred miles of air. In your
normal experience, you probably think
that air is transparent and that light just
passes straight through it without getting
messed up too much. Well, over short dis
tances, you're right, but over longer dis
tances, that would be a fallacious presump
tion.

You see, air scatters light slightly. The
effect isn't extremely big, so that's why you
don't notice it over short distances. But
when light travels through hundreds of
miles of air, the scattering effect does make
a difference. Here on earth, this means that
the sun's light doesn't all come straight
through the atmosphere, but some of it is
scattered around.
The scattering of the sun's light is what
allows us to see the sky. If the light came
directly to us from the sun, without being
scattered by an atmosphere, then our sky
would be drastically different. The scatter
ing of light disperses the light of the sun
throughout the whole atmosphere so that
no matter where we look, we can see some of
the sun's light. On the moon, where there is
no atmosphere, the sky is black because
there is no scattering of the light.
However, this isn't enough to explain
why the sky is blue. The color of the sky
comes from the fact that air scatters light of
different wavelengths by differing amounts.
It turns out that the amount of scattering is
proportional to the fourth power of the fre

quency of the light, but I bet you knew that
already. Since blue light has a frequency
about double that of red light, it is about 16
times more scattered. So, when sunlight
comes through the atmosphere, more of the
blue light is scattered throughout the sky
than red light. When you look at the sky, the
excess of blue light makes it look blue.
This is also the reason why the sunset
is red. At sunset, sunlight has to travel
through a lot more air to get to your eyes
because of the angle you are viewing the
sun at. Because the light travels through
more air, a lot of blue light is scattered out,
and more red light makes it through. The
difference between looking at the sky and
looking at the sunset is that when you look
at the sky, you are looking at light that has
already been scattered, whereas when you
look at the sunset, you are looking at light
which hasn't been scattered. It's like the
difference between night and day, except
it's not night.
The scattering of light also explains why
clouds look white. Everyone knows that
clouds are condensed water vapor in the

skies. The problem, though, is that we can't
see the water until it condenses. There's a
lot of water vapor in the sky, yet we don't
see it until it condenses into clouds. There
must be a difference between water vapor
and the condensed water which makes it
possible to see clouds.
The scattering of light also depends on
the size of the particle that it is scattering.
If the size of the scattering particle is less
than the wavelength of the scattered light,
then the scattering of the light is related to
the size of the particles. However, when the
particle size gets larger than the wave
length of the light there is no more signifi
cant increase in the scattering.
For relatively small particles, like air
molecules, blue light is scattered more than
red light and gives us the blue sky / red sun
set effect. As particle size increases past the
wavelength of blue light, the amount of
scattering of blue light stops increasing.
However, since red light has a longer wave
length, the scattering of red light can still be
increased by increasing the size of the parti
cle. So, with larger particles, both red and

blue light are scattered and the scattered
light appears white.
If you haven't figured out by now, clouds
are made of relatively large particles, so the
light scattered by the clouds appears white.
One more thing, since ultraviolet light
is of a much shorter wavelength than
either red or blue light, it doesn't matter
what the size of the particle is. The same
amount of ultraviolet light comes through
whether or not the scattering particles are
condensed water vapor or air molecules.
This means the same amount of ultraviolet
light gets through on a cloudy day as on a
clear day and that's why you can get sun
burned on a cloudy day, just like on a clear
day.
Now stop asking me about the stupid
sky!

The Science Bug's job would be a lot easier
if he could turn in the same column every
week.
