# Sculpture garden artists to return for opening
## 
### Dana Hangai Staff writer 
Imagine you are one of 10 artists who has
traveled from your village in Papua New
Guinea to Stanford in order to create art for
others. After five months of painting and carv
ing 40 works of art in wood and stone, sight
seeing in Reno, Nev., and dining on a new culi
nary delight called the "Whopper," you return
home, not knowing if you will ever see your
work again.
Then, two years later you are invited to re
turn to Stanford to participate in a five-day
opening ceremony celebration for a sculpture
garden that draws a few hundred visitors each
day.
After two years, the Papua New Guinea
Sculpture Garden, located between Roble Hall
and Terman Engineering Building, is finished
and will officially be opened in an all-night
drum and dance ceremony at the garden on
Saturday. University dignitaries and the 10
artists will also speak at the beginning of the
celebration. The opening ceremony follows a
week-long celebration, which begins today.
Project Director Jim Mason said it is tradi
tional for the Papua New Guinea artists to cel
ebrate the completion of a large building pro
ject with an all-night gathering and party. At
the event, some of the artists will play 5-foot
long flutes and others will play "garamut
drums," wooden crocodile-shaped drums that
the artists made in 1994.
The artists will begin their drumming at
sunset and will not stop until sunrise, Mason
said. "From 9 to 12 a variety of other drum
groups will also perform," he continued. "After
12, it will be a general free-for-all, with every
body playing on drums. That's why we're going
to advise that people bring something they can
bang on so they can participate."
Other events are scheduled for each evening
in the garden. These events include perfor
mances by the Center for Computer Research

and Acoustics at Stanford, the Stanford Im
provisers and internationally acclaimed musi
cians.
Project Coordinator Sari Cooper said many
of the artists are planning to play music and
perform dance that is based on the atmosphere
of the garden.
"They will respond to the environment
around here and use it in creating their art,"
she said. "It's very interesting to watch the
groups interact with the art here and experi
ence the place."

Mason originally started the project while
researching in the Sepik River region of Papua
New Guinea in 1989 as a graduate student in
anthropology. During his stay, he was ap
proached by two artists from the Kwoma soci
ety who wanted to display their art to other
Western countries.
In 1994, Mason was able to raise enough
money to bring the 10 artists and a translator
to Stanford. The artists, ranging in age from 27
to 74, come from two different cultures, the
latmul and the Kwoma societies, which are the
two dominant artistic communities in the
Sepik River region.
Mason raised almost $500,000 from various
sponsors and more than 300 individuals and
businesses from the local community. During
their stay, the artists lived with local families.
"We have many friends (here)," artist David
Yamanapi said. "We've missed them for two
years. So we come back, and they're all very

happy to see all of us back here. They want to
talk to us and they have many questions."
The project has not been without its prob
lems. Before installation, two of the statues
were stolen. Both were later returned, one
anonymously and the other under condition of
secrecy.
Because of their jungle climate, the artists
were not used to the colder climate of Northern
California. During the first weeks of their 1994
visit, many fell ill because of the shock to their
systems, according to Mason.
Contacting the artists for the second trip to
Stanford was also difficult, Mason said.
"In Papua New Guinea, there aren't many
telephones so I have to call their relatives who
live in the nearby cities," Mason said. "They
then transmit the information through the
marketplace to other people, who take it to the
villagers. After about a week or so, I get a re
sponse back from the artists."
However, the time and money that has gone
into the project have been worth it, according
to Thomas Seligman, director of the Stanford
Art Museum. Although the project is now inde
pendently run by Mason, after the opening cer
emony it will become an official exhibit of the
museum.
Along with the Native American totem pole
outside the Art Gallery, the garden is one of the
"first two significant groups of non-Western
art on the campus, and I hope that they begin
to open people's eyes and minds and experi
ences to the richness and value of the artists of
these other world cultures," Seligman said. "I
think the New Guinea garden has been partic
ularly rich because of the involvement of so
many artists for such a long time on the cam
pus."
According to Cooper, organizers expect the
opening ceremonies to attract 1,000 people,
Volunteers are needed to help out during the
events; those interested should contact Cooper
at 725-0153. There will be a volunteer meeting
today at 4 p.m. in the sculpture garden.
