## Women's golf earns fifth place at NCAAs 
### Robin Davidson Staff writer 
The Stanford women's golf
team closed its season with a fifth
place finish in the 1996 NCAA
Women's Golf Championship this
weekend at the La Quinta Resort
and Club in La Quinta, Calif. The
Cardinal's team total of 1,248
placed it just eight strokes behind
champion Arizona â€” ironically,
the same deficit Stanford faced
against Texas after round one.
"I'm very pleased," said inter
im head coach Carolyn O'Connor.
"We went in there the first day
and were eight strokes back. The
weather conditions were rough,
and the greens were really hard
and fast. But we knew we had
three more days of golf to play."
The Cardinal fought back after
day one and leapt into a two-way
tie for second with Arizona at just
one stroke off the lead. Round
three brought even more success
for Stanford. The team posted a
311, enough to place the Cardinal
in a two-way tie with Arizona for
the top spot. A score of 312 in the
final round dropped Stanford into
fifth as the top four teams posted
team-best performances in that
round.
"I don't think anyone expected
us to be in [ first place]O'Connor
said. "Winning the NCAA cham
pionship would have been a
dream for this team."
In individual competition, ju
nior Andrea Baxter was the Car
dinal's top player. She finished
the competition tied for fourth
with San Jose State's Janice
Moodie. Baxter's final total was
305, nine strokes off the lead and
just two strokes away from sec
ond place Kellee Booth of Arizona
State. UCLA's Kathy Choi fin
ished in third with a 304.
Other Cardinal standouts in
the competition were senior Vicky
Strada and junior Mhairi McKay.
Strada placed just one stroke be
hind Baxter at 306 for a three-way
sixth-place finish, and McKay put

up a 309 to tie her with two other
competitors for tenth. In addi
tion, senior Julie Bowen and
freshman Michelle Sperry fin
ished in the top 100 at 78 and 84
respectively.
"Our top five players are as
good as the top five on any other
team," O'Connor said. "We defi
nitely had a chance at it. We were
disappointed with our seventh
seed going in, but being seeded
higher puts more pressure on
you. So does being first after the
third round. I would have much
rather been one or two strokes
back."
Arizona finished the four
round competition with a 1,240
team total but were forced into a
playoff by local rival San Jose
State which matched the Wild
cats' score with a remarkable
fourth-round performance. The
Spartans posted a tournament
best 300 team score in that round
to finally surpass the eight-stroke
disadvantage it faced most of the
tournament. However, the effort
was not enough as Arizona's
Maria Baena sank an eagle to give
the Wildcats a one-stroke advan
tage for the victory in the playoff.
San Jose State finished round
one in a tie with Stanford and a
slew of other schools for eighth
place. The Spartans moved into
seventh place after round two but
were still down eight strokes.
They maintained their position in
round three but managed to close
the gap by four strokes before tak
inga tie for first in the final round.
Unlike the Spartans, Arizona
was never far off the lead in the
entire tournament. The Wildcats
finished round one just one shot
behind the Longhorns in a three
way second place finish with
UCLA and Wake Forest. The sec
ond round was less successful for
Arizona, but it maintained the
second position. Arizona moved
into first after round three and
then posted its best team perfor
mance of the tournament to en
sure a tie for first.
