In the midst of its 18-game
winning streak, nothing could
go wrong for the Stanford base
ball team. But on Saturday, its
heart was broken twice.
Within a span of less than 12
hours, the Cardinal plummeted
from the winners' bracket of the
NCAA West Regional to elimina
tion by dropping a pair of one
run, nail-biting decisions at
Sunken Diamond. In the first
contest, Geoff Sprague's one
out solo blast in the ninth inning
propelled top seed Florida State
to a 5-4 win. That forced Stan
ford into a losers' bracket affair
against Cal State-Northridge in
the evening. Stanford (41-19)
scored two runs in the ninth to
close the gap to 4-3 before senior
Sean Flikke, just inserted into
the game as a pinch runner, was
picked off second as the poten
tial tying run for the final out.
"It was a big pickoff move by
Northridge," said senior catcher
A.J. Hinch, who went 3-for-16 in
the tournament. "It was like
stabbing you in the heart."
But Stanford had been
wounded throughout the game,
struggling to generate any of
fense against the Matador's No.
3 starter Benny Flores (7-2).
The right-hander dissected the
Cardinal for eight innings, on
the heels of a pitchers' night
mare. Just 45 minutes prior to

Freshman Jody Gerut tees off against Florida State on Saturday. Despite Gerut's 2-for-4,1-RBI perfor
mance, the Cardinal dropped the game, 5-4.
