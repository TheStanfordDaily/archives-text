In the midst of its 18-game
winning streak, nothing could
go wrong for the Stanford base
ball team. But on Saturday, its
heart was broken twice.
Within a span of less than 12
hours, the Cardinal plummeted
from the winners' bracket of the
NCAA West Regional to elimina
tion by dropping a pair of one
run, nail-biting decisions at
Sunken Diamond. In the first
contest, Geoff Sprague's one
out solo blast in the ninth inning
propelled top seed Florida State
to a 5-4 win. That forced Stan
ford into a losers' bracket affair
against Cal State-Northridge in
the evening. Stanford (41-19)
scored two runs in the ninth to
close the gap to 4-3 before senior
Sean Flikke, just inserted into
the game as a pinch runner, was
picked off second as the poten
tial tying run for the final out.
"It was a big pickoff move by
Northridge," said senior catcher
A.J. Hinch, who went 3-for-16 in
the tournament. "It was like
stabbing you in the heart."
But Stanford had been
wounded throughout the game,
struggling to generate any of
fense against the Matador's No.
3 starter Benny Flores (7-2).
The right-hander dissected the
Cardinal for eight innings, on
the heels of a pitchers' night
mare. Just 45 minutes prior to

tlie Stanford game, the Mata
dors all but squandered a 14-0
Jead against Mississippi State
(38-23), eking out a wild 20-19
decision when the Bulldogs
stranded the go-ahead run in the

ninth.
"I was very impressed with
their pitcher Flores," said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess,
who wrapped up his most suc
cessful record in six years. "He
pitched a heck of a game. He re
ally kept us off-balanced."
Northridge, designated the
home team for the contest, wast
ed little time staking Flores to a

2-0 lead in the bottom of the
first. Center fielder Kurt Airoso
blasted his 12th homer of the
year to score All-Regional short
stop Adam Kennedy before
freshman Jeff Austin (6-4) had
retired a batter.
Austin was chased in the
fourth. Right fielder Jose Miran
da doubled and senior third
baseman Troy Kent dropped a

pop-up by first baseman Casey
Cheshier, leaving two men in
scoring position to score on des
ignated hitter David Stephen
son's base hit. That brought on
seldom-used sophomore Josh
Koons, who proceeded to silence
the explosive Matador lineup.
Although hurling just eight
innings all year prior to the
game, Koons went the rest of the
way, allowing just one hit and
one walk while striking out
eight. The unlikely hero gave
Stanford a chance to go down
without a whimper.
Stanford scraped a run across
to break the ice in the fifth, when
All-Regional second baseman
Brian Dallimore, also a senior,
scored from second on a wild
pitch that skipped by All-Region
al catcher Robert Kick. The Car
dinal threatened again in the sev
enth but left the bases full when
sophomore right fielder Joe Kil
burg hit a deep fly ball to center.
Flores finally lost it in the
ninth, sandwiching a Dallimore
double between two walks. Robby
Crabtree, the loser in the Thurs
day affair between the two clubs
and the earner of the save in the
afternoon contest, came on and
induced junior shortstop Eric
Sees to ground out, scoring
sophomore pinch runner Jay
Pecci and moving the tying runs
into scoringposition. Flikkecame
in for the first time all weekend to
run for senior Cale Carter, the
former speedster who has been
nagged by leg and foot injuries.
Kilburg then launched a sacrifice
fly to left, plating Dallimore but
leaving Flikke on second.
Stanford would not have been
playing Saturday night if it could
have topped the No. 1-seed Flori
da State (51-15), who went on to
win the championship 9-2 over
Cal State-Northridge (52-18) on
Sunday. In a classic duel, fresh
man Chad Hutchinson (7-2)
matched Seminole ace and All-
Regional hurler Randy Choate
(15-3) until surrendering
Sprague's homer.
"I really only made two mis
takes, the home runs, and they
cost us the game," Hutchinson
said. "[The last pitch 1 was a fast
ball right down the middle."
At its beginning, the contest
showed no indications of a pitch
ers' duel. The "visiting" Cardi
nal struck for two in the top of
the first with back-to-back dou
bles by freshman center fielder

Jody Gerut and Hinch and a two
out single from Kent. But just as
in the later game, the opposition
pounced before an out had been
recorded.
All-Regional center fielder
J.D. Drew popped his 20th
homer to score three and give the
Seminoles the lead back until the
seventh inning, as the teams
traded zeroes.
The Cardinal finally went
back on top just before the near
sellout crowd of 3,887 stretched.
With two outs, Kilburg doubled
to the left-center gap to score ju
nior left fielder Chris Clark and
give the Cardinal its first hit
since a Dallimore leadoff single
in the second. Gerut then singled
Kilburg home but was thrown
out trying to advance to second,
but the Cardinal had the lead.
The Atlantic Coast Confer
ence champs answered quickly,
with consecutive one-out singles
following a walk scoring the
pinch-running Sprague. With
runners on first and second,
Drew slapped a liner to a leaping
junior first baseman Luke
Quaccia, who tagged the bag for
a huge double play.
The defense rose to the occa
sion in the next inning as well,
when cleanup hitter Jeremy
Morris singled to lead off the
frame. The Regional's most out
standing player Scooby Morgan
slapped a single to right, but Kil
burg made a sparkling throw to
Kent, nailing Morris at third for
his second assist of the game.
"We had some great defensive
plays that kept us in the game,"
Marquess said. "It was just a
great college baseball game."
Baserunning gaffes would bite
the Cardinal in the ninth — ironi
cally, occurring after a runner
strayed too far from second. Dal
limore singled with one out, and
shortstop Brooks Badeaux botched
a sure double-play ball, advancing
Dallimore to second and allowing
Clark to reach first. But the Cardi
nal ran itself out of the inning
when he strayed too far off the bag,
prompting an easy 9-6-5 caught
stealing at third. Clark was then
thrown out trying to steal second.
Hutchinson struck out his
seventh batter to start the bot
tom half, but Sprague's first at
bat of the day went to a 3-1
count. The freshman, who had
surrendered just two homers all
year before the day, went with a
fat fastball, and Sprague lifted it

into the wind and over the wall
in left for just his second round
tripper.
"We are very, very lucky and
fortunate considering the things
we got out of," said Seminole
head coach Mike Martin.
Stanford had advanced to the
marquee matchup against Flori
da State by edging third-seeded
Mississippi State 8-6 on Friday
night. Stanford never trailed in
taking a tense contest before a
then-season-high crowd of
3,712.
Senior Mario Iglesias (10-1)
was tagged for a season-high five
runs, but pitched just well
enough to turn things over to the
bullpen, and junior Tom
Reimers picked up his second
save in as many nights and his
Fifth of the year by pitching the
eighth and ninth.
Kent got the Cardinal on the
board with a leadoff homer in the
bottom of the second off of loser
Keith Dilgard (6-4). Stanford
sacrificed twice after sophomore
All-Regional designated hitter
Jon Schaeffer and Dalliniore
reached base, and Kilburg laid
down a perfect two-out bunt sin
gle, staking the Cardinal to a 3-0
lead.
MSU second baseman Rob
Hauswald's two-run blast in the
fourth cut the lead to 3-2, but
the Cardinal tacked on three un
earned runs to answer and send
Dilgard to the showers. Schaef
fer doubled and moved up after
Dallimore reached on an error.
He scored on a Pecci grounder,
and after Kilburg was hit by a
pitch, Gerut doubled down the
line in right, scoring two.
The Bulldogs pushed across
two in the fifth and loaded the
bases on Iglesias in the seventh,
bringing on junior right-hander
Brendan Sullivan from the pen.
Sullivan induced Hauswald to
whiff but struck third baseman
Adam Piatt, cutting the lead to
one with two outs. But freshman
southpaw Tony Cogan got first
baseman Brian Clark to ground
out to Kent.
Schaeffer was instrumental
in scoring both of the Cardinal's
subsequent insurance runs. He
led off the seventh with a double
and scored on a clutch two-out
single by Sees. After the Bull
dogs answered with one in the
eighth, Schaeffer crunched his
third double of the day, scoring
Gerut.
