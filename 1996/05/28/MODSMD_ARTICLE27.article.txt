### Ben Hur Staff writer 
Sometimes, it just doesn't all
come together. The men's and
women's crew teams fought
valiantly this weekend, but fell

short at the Pacific 10 Champi
onships.
Racing on their home course,
the fourth-seeded Stanford men
opened competition by defeating
fifth-seeded Gonzaga. The Cardi
nal pulled out to an early lead by

the 300-meter mark, then sat on
it, eventually winning by three
seconds.
Stanford then faced a daunt
ing opponent in top-ranked
Washington, a Pacific 10 confer
ence powerhouse and one of the

best crews in the nation. The Car
dinal men had an exceptional
race, but could not make up the
five-second margin.
On Sunday, the Cardinal chal
lenged Oregon State for third
place and a possible spot at the
NCAA championships. The
Beavers defeated Stanford in the
squads' regular season meeting,
but the Cardinal knew it could
race with Oregon State. The
teams raced closely during the be
ginning of the contest, but the
Beavers began to pull away at the
1000-meter mark. Oregon State
held on to win, pushing the Cardi
nal to fourth place in the tourna
ment and ending its season.
Graduating senior coxswain
Eva Kim reflected on the season
and offered words of advice to her
returning teammates.
"I want them to take what
we've learned this year, the way
we think, the way we work, the
way we row; and apply it," Kim
said. "I don't want them to forget
the lessons we learned."
