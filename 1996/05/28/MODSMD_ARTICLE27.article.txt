# Crew teams fall short at Pac-10 championships

### Ben Hur Staff writer 
Sometimes, it just doesn't all
come together. The men's and
women's crew teams fought
valiantly this weekend, but fell

short at the Pacific 10 Champi
onships.
Racing on their home course,
the fourth-seeded Stanford men
opened competition by defeating
fifth-seeded Gonzaga. The Cardi
nal pulled out to an early lead by

the 300-meter mark, then sat on
it, eventually winning by three
seconds.
Stanford then faced a daunt
ing opponent in top-ranked
Washington, a Pacific 10 confer
ence powerhouse and one of the

best crews in the nation. The Car
dinal men had an exceptional
race, but could not make up the
five-second margin.
On Sunday, the Cardinal chal
lenged Oregon State for third
place and a possible spot at the
NCAA championships. The
Beavers defeated Stanford in the
squads' regular season meeting,
but the Cardinal knew it could
race with Oregon State. The
teams raced closely during the be
ginning of the contest, but the
Beavers began to pull away at the
1000-meter mark. Oregon State
held on to win, pushing the Cardi
nal to fourth place in the tourna
ment and ending its season.
Graduating senior coxswain
Eva Kim reflected on the season
and offered words of advice to her
returning teammates.
"I want them to take what
we've learned this year, the way
we think, the way we work, the
way we row; and apply it," Kim
said. "I don't want them to forget
the lessons we learned."

took an early lead and eventually
finished 30 seconds ahead of the
overmatched Ducks.
The Stanford women then
moved on to face third-seeded
Washington State, a team that
the Cardinal had traded victo
ries with during the regular sea
son. The Cougars started the
race by keeping its stroke rate
high, causing the Cardinal to
fall behind during the first 500
meters. Stanford battled back,
gaining about four seconds in
the last 1000, but could not
overtake the Washington State
crew.
A strong headwind worked in
favor of the Cougars, who have a
heavier crew than Stanford.
However, the Cardinal made no
excuses.
"We pulled our hardest race,"
said senior Audra Pligavko. "It's
a race we feel good about even if
we didn't win."
After losing to Washington
State, Stanford faced fourth seed-

Ed Oregon State the next day. Al
though the squad was disappoint
ed about its loss the previous day,
it pulled together and defeated
the Beavers handily.
The win earned Stanford third
place and qualified them for the
NCAAs. However, the team knew
that if they did not finish in either
first or second, it would stay
home.
"We needed to set a prece
dent," said coach Amee Baker.
"We wanted to be able to go to Na
tionals and compete. I told these
guys before that if we don't finish
in the top two, we aren't going."
The Stanford women finished
the regular season undefeated in
dual meet competitions. Its loss
to Washington State did not di
minish the squad's accomplish
ments, said Baker.
"I think these guys did a great
job this season," Baker said. "Yes,
we came up a little short, but ulti
mately, we had a great season and
1 am proud of them."
Baker, who served as interim
coach during the past year,
signed a new contract that will
bring her back to the Farm next
season.
