Bleszynski soared to the semifi
nals of individual competition at
the 1996 NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships this weekend in
Tallahassee, Fla., before falling to
Florida's Jill Craybas 6-2,6-3.
"I was happy to live up to my
seeding and make it past the quar
terfinals," Bleszynski said. "Beat
ing Keri Phebus is obviously good.
I was kind of disappointed losing in
the semifinals because I wtis get
ting so close, but I didn't have
much left."
Bleszynski, who played at the
No. 1 singles position for the Car
dinal all season, was the sixth seed
in the tournament and did not
meet a ranked player until the
quarterfinals. Bleszynski domi
nated the lesser competition, win
ning eveiy match against unseed
ed players in straight sets.
In the first round Bleszynski
faced Nicole Strnadova of Syra
cuse and won 6-3, 7-6 (1). Howev

er, the match was not as easy as the
straight-set victory might indicate.
After dropping the first set 6-3,
Strnadova extended Bleszynski to
a tiebreak in the second set. But
Bleszynski turned up the heat in
the tiebreak, allowing Strnadova
to score only one point and sealing
the victory.
"It was a good match to win and
get back into the tournament,"
Bleszynski said. "I was kind of ner
vous with it being the first round.
It was the day after losing to Flori
da, and it was hard to regroup."
The next opponent for Bleszyn
ski was the University of Califor
nia's Pam Enkoji. Enkoji defeated
Utah's Miija Wallmark with ease,
6-2,6-0, but was not able to handle
Bleszynski's arsenal. Enkoji put
up a good fight in the first set.
Bleszynski was down 5-3 and faced
set point before charging back to
take the set 7-5. Bleszynski carried
the momentum from the first set
into the second and ran away with
the set and the match 6-3.
"She started well and hit a lot of
winners," Bleszynski said. "I was
struggling until I came up with a
new strategy and slowed her mo
mentum."
In round three, Bleszynski faced
a surprise opponent in Florida
State's Lori Sowell. Sowell aston
ished everyone with a first round vic
tory over top-16 entry Farley Taylor
ofTexas.
Unfortunately for Sowell, her
luck ran out against Bleszynski.
Bleszynski took a difficult first set
7-5, before racing to victory in the
second set 6-3. The victory placed
Bleszynski into the quarterfinals
against Pacific 10 Conference rival
Keri Phebus of UCLA.
Phebus was the No. 2 seed in the
tournament and had faced Bleszyns
ki several times during the season.
Bleszynski was sharp in the first set
and took the early advantage over
Phebus 6-4. Phebus would not go
quietly though, as she fought back in
the second set and forced Bleszynski
to a tiebreaker.

In the tiebreaker, Bleszynski al
most snuck away with the straight
set victory, but Phebus hung on to
take the set and break even 7-6 (6).
Bleszynski caught fire in the final set
and took the victory 6-4, 7-6 (6), 6-3
to advance to the semifinals.
"It was a very long match,"
Bleszynski said. "In the beginning I
knew I didn't have much to lose.
She's the defending national cham
pion; she's the senior.
"I played more relaxed than she
did," she added. "My strategy was to
attack and move her around the
court. The way the points were going
caused her to get tired quicker so it
was a big factor in the third set."
Fourth-seeded and eventual
winner Craybas was waiting for
Bleszynski in the semifinals in a
rematch of a match from the
NCAA team championships be
tween the Gators and the Cardi
nal. Craybas took that match 6-3,
6-4 as Florida won the title. In the
semifinal match, Bleszynski never
got her engines started, and Cray
bas won 6-2,6-3.
"I didn't play really well,"
Bleszynski said. "I was tired. I don't
think there was much I could have
done to beat her that day."
