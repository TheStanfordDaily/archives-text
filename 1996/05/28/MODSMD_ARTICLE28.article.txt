Bleszynski soared to the semifi
nals of individual competition at
the 1996 NCAA Women's Tennis
Championships this weekend in
Tallahassee, Fla., before falling to
Florida's Jill Craybas 6-2,6-3.
"I was happy to live up to my
seeding and make it past the quar
terfinals," Bleszynski said. "Beat
ing Keri Phebus is obviously good.
I was kind of disappointed losing in
the semifinals because I wtis get
ting so close, but I didn't have
much left."
Bleszynski, who played at the
No. 1 singles position for the Car
dinal all season, was the sixth seed
in the tournament and did not
meet a ranked player until the
quarterfinals. Bleszynski domi

In the first round Bleszynski
faced Nicole Strnadova of Syra

er, the match was not as easy as the
straight-set victory might indicate.

Strnadova extended Bleszynski to

Bleszynski turned up the heat in
the tiebreak, allowing Strnadova
to score only one point and sealing
the victory.
"It was a good match to win and
get back into the tournament,"
Bleszynski said. "I was kind of ner
vous with it being the first round.
It was the day after losing to Flori
da, and it was hard to regroup."
The next opponent for Bleszyn

Utah's Miija Wallmark with ease,
6-2,6-0, but was not able to handle
