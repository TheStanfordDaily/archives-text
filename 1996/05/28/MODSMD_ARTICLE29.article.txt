The individual portion of the
NCAA tennis championships didn't
go quite as well as the Cardinal may
have hoped it would. All four Stan
ford entrants in the singles were
eliminated by the second round,
and both doubles teams invited
were ousted by the third round.
The players involved in the indi
vidual half of the tournament in
Athens, Ga., acknowledged that the
team championships had already
taken a lot out of them. After win
ning the national team title, the
Cardinal came out flat for the per
sonal tourneys.
"Basically the theme for the
week after the team championships
(when the individuals took place)
was that it was really hard to get
motivated," said sophomore Paul
Goldstein. "We had just won the na
tional championship and it left us
both emotionally and physically
drained. It was really tough to get
up for those matches."
In the singles, senior Jeff Salzen
stein was upset by Auburn's Lee

Pearson 2-6, 7-5, 6-2 in the first
round. It was a disappointing loss
for the Cardinal captain, as he had
been the fifth seed and one of the fa
vorites to go the distance. It also
marked the first of Salzenstein's
pre-season goals that wasn't ac
complished.
Before the year began, the senior
set three goals: to play first singles,
to win the NCAA team title and to
win the singles championship. Un
fortunately for Salzenstein, this
year's recipient of the most out
standing senior award, the four
days of intense team competition
left him weary from the outset of
the singles event.
Ryan Wolters, Goldstein and
Jim Thomas were all knocked out
one round later. Goldstein was de
feated by the eventual champion,
USC's Cecil Mamiit 7-6 (7-0), 4-6,
6-2. Goldstein gave Mamiit his
biggest scare of the week. The Tro
jan freshman lost only two sets in
his five matches.
Wolters lost to the other finalist,
Fredrik Bergh of Fresno State, 6-3,
