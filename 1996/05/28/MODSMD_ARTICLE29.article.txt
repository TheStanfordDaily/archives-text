The individual portion of the
NCAA tennis championships didn't
go quite as well as the Cardinal may
have hoped it would. All four Stan
ford entrants in the singles were
eliminated by the second round,
and both doubles teams invited
were ousted by the third round.
The players involved in the indi
vidual half of the tournament in
Athens, Ga., acknowledged that the
team championships had already
taken a lot out of them. After win
ning the national team title, the
Cardinal came out flat for the per
sonal tourneys.
"Basically the theme for the
week after the team championships
(when the individuals took place)
was that it was really hard to get
motivated," said sophomore Paul
Goldstein. "We had just won the na
tional championship and it left us
both emotionally and physically
drained. It was really tough to get
up for those matches."
In the singles, senior Jeff Salzen
stein was upset by Auburn's Lee

Pearson 2-6, 7-5, 6-2 in the first
round. It was a disappointing loss
for the Cardinal captain, as he had
been the fifth seed and one of the fa
vorites to go the distance. It also
marked the first of Salzenstein's
pre-season goals that wasn't ac
complished.
Before the year began, the senior
set three goals: to play first singles,
to win the NCAA team title and to
win the singles championship. Un
fortunately for Salzenstein, this
year's recipient of the most out
standing senior award, the four
days of intense team competition
left him weary from the outset of
the singles event.
Ryan Wolters, Goldstein and
Jim Thomas were all knocked out
one round later. Goldstein was de
feated by the eventual champion,
USC's Cecil Mamiit 7-6 (7-0), 4-6,
6-2. Goldstein gave Mamiit his
biggest scare of the week. The Tro
jan freshman lost only two sets in
his five matches.
Wolters lost to the other finalist,

6-3. Thomas, who reached the tour
nament as the first alternate, pulled
off a big upset in the first round
when he beat Mississippi State's top
player and a 9-16 seed, Thomas
Dupre, in the first round. However,
Georgia's John Roddick had too
many weapons for the 6-4 Cardinal
netter, and he dispatched Thomas
6-4,6-1 in the second round.
The doubles matches went much
the same way, as Salzenstein and
Wolters made it past Arkansas' Tim
Crichton and Tom Hamilton, 6-4,
6-4, before losing to Texas Christ
ian's David Roditi and Paul Robin
son. Roditi and Robinson, the
Horned Frogs' top duo and the No.
3 team in the nation, were played
very close by Stanford's second
team 6-3,4-6,6-3.
"We knew we would have to play
at the top of our games to win that
match," Wolters said. "They're one
of the best teams in the country,
and they were just better than us on
that day."
Thomas and Goldstein, the sec

ond seed in the tournament,
reached the quarterfinals of the
doubles by defeating LSU's Ryan
Ideta and Chad Dudley 6-1,6-4 and
New Mexico's Chris Brown and
David Murphy 6-3, 6-3. They ran
into a tough tandem from Ten
nessee in the third round however,
and were beaten by a 6-4, 6-4 mar
gin. The Volunteers' Chris Mahony
and Pablo Montana were winners
of the Rolex Indoor Championships
earlier this year, and entered the
doubles as a 5-8 seed.
"We were tired from a long
stretch of tough tennis," Goldstein
said. "We didn't do as well as we
would have liked, and we're a little
disappointed."
But while the players were
slightly frustrated by the less than
stellar showing in the individuals,
all agreed that winning the team
championship was the most impor
tant thing.
Said Wolters, the only starter on
the team without a ring from the
1994-1995 season: "None of us did
as well as we wanted to in the indi
viduals, but when we get our rings
it's really not going to matter much.
We're national champions — that is
what matters."
