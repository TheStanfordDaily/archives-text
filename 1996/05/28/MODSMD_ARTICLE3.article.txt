## SEAS leads Stanford protest in conjunction with nationwide group 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Fifteen students fasted at Stanford
Thursday and Friday in a protest against
the deteriorating human rights situa
tion in Myanmar, the country in South
east Asia formerly known as Burma.
As of Saturday, nearly 260 members
of the democracy movement in Myan
mar had been arrested by authorities as
they prepared for a pro-democracy meet
ing.
Students for Environmental Action
at Stanford led the two-day-long fast in
solidarity with numerous student
groups across the country in support of
the Free Burma Coalition and the Demo

cratic Burmese Students Organization.
Members of these two groups were
fasting on the steps of the Capitol in
Washington to protest the crackdown on
members of the National League for
Democracy (NLD) in Myanmar.
SEAS member Kelly Naylor, a sopho
more, said the Stanford fast is "so that
they feel a sense of connection. We're
also trying to continue the education
process of the Stanford community," she
said.
As part of the effort, SEAS members
were in White Plaza at lunchtime Thurs
day and Friday asking passersby to sign
letters listing the demands of the pro
testers. As of Friday, they had collected
more than 250 signatures.

"People seem pretty supportive," said
SEAS member Tim Knight, a junior.
"When they hear someone is hunger
striking," that has an effect, he said.
"Because of the previous community
outreach [by SEAS], people are pretty
open [to these efforts]," Naylor added.
There has been a continued effort at
Stanford to support the democracy
movement in Myanmar. SEAS members
led a protest last quarter about a pro
posed Taco Bell in Tresidder Union.
Taco Bell's parent company, PepsiCo,
had operations in Myanmar but decided
in late April to close most of them in re
sponse to nationwide protests.
