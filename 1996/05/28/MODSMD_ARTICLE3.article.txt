# Students fast for Myanmar rights
## SEAS leads Stanford protest in conjunction with nationwide group 
### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Fifteen students fasted at Stanford
Thursday and Friday in a protest against
the deteriorating human rights situa
tion in Myanmar, the country in South
east Asia formerly known as Burma.
As of Saturday, nearly 260 members
of the democracy movement in Myan
mar had been arrested by authorities as
they prepared for a pro-democracy meet
ing.
Students for Environmental Action
at Stanford led the two-day-long fast in
solidarity with numerous student
groups across the country in support of
the Free Burma Coalition and the Demo

cratic Burmese Students Organization.
Members of these two groups were
fasting on the steps of the Capitol in
Washington to protest the crackdown on
members of the National League for
Democracy (NLD) in Myanmar.
SEAS member Kelly Naylor, a sopho
more, said the Stanford fast is "so that
they feel a sense of connection. We're
also trying to continue the education
process of the Stanford community," she
said.
As part of the effort, SEAS members
were in White Plaza at lunchtime Thurs
day and Friday asking passersby to sign
letters listing the demands of the pro
testers. As of Friday, they had collected
more than 250 signatures.

"People seem pretty supportive," said
SEAS member Tim Knight, a junior.
"When they hear someone is hunger
striking," that has an effect, he said.
"Because of the previous community
outreach [by SEAS], people are pretty
open [to these efforts]," Naylor added.
There has been a continued effort at
Stanford to support the democracy
movement in Myanmar. SEAS members
led a protest last quarter about a pro
posed Taco Bell in Tresidder Union.
Taco Bell's parent company, PepsiCo,
had operations in Myanmar but decided
in late April to close most of them in re
sponse to nationwide protests.
The fight for democracy in
Myanmar has been long. In May
1990, the State Law and Order
Restoration Council (SLORC),
the military dictatorship which
holds power, held multiparty elec
tions.
The NLD, led by 1991 Nobel
Peace Prize Recipient Aung San
Suu Kyi, won a landslide victory,
gaining more than 80 percent of
the seats in the parliament, said
freshman Eric Huang, one of the
fasters. But so far the SLORC has
not honored the election results
and refuses to negotiate with the
NLD's representatives, he said.
This latest round of arrests by
the SLORC came after the NLD
announced that it would hold a
meeting May 27 to plan their
strategy, Huang explained.
Despite the detentions, the
conference has begun, Knight
said. It is the first meeting of the
NLD since the 1990 elections, he
added.
Demonstrators want the U.S.
government to exert strong pres
sure on the SLORC for the release

of political prisoners, and they
want President Clinton to official
ly urge the military dictatorship
to open a dialogue with Aung San
Suu Kyi and the NLD.
In addition, they want the U.S.
government to lead a worldwide
boycott of tourism in Myanmar
and U.S. corporations to termi
nate their business with Myan
mar's authorities.
Their final demand is that
Congress adopt a bipartisan bill
known as the Burma Freedom
and Democracy Act. The mea
sure, which is currently pending
in the Senate, would bar much of
the U.S. government and busi
ness involvement with dictators
in Myanmar.
The State Department opposes
the bill, citing that unilateral
sanctions will not have positive
impacts on the situation in Myan
mar. There is also opposition from
U.S. multinationals such as UN
OCAL, ARCO, Texaco and Pepsi-
Co which have economic interests
in the country.
When Congress, which is cur
rently out of session, reconvenes
Monday, the demonstrators in
Washington will begin a hunger
strike, refusing to eat until de
mands are met.
