Motorist, bicyclist fight
An altercation broke out between a motorist and a bicyclist after
a near collision May 13 at about 2:30 p.m.
The motorist was driving a vehicle on Lomita Drive near Muse
um Way, said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer. The bicyclist
pulled in front of the vehicle.
The two began to yell at each other, and the argument became vi
olent. The bicyclist allegedly began kicking the car and a fight en
sued.
"Actually, it looks like mutual combat more than an assault,"
Niemeyer said.
After the fight died down, the motorist began to walk back to his
car when "the bicyclist ran up to him and hit him on the back of the
head with his fist," said Niemeyer. That blow resulted in the charge
of assault.
"The person then took off on foot," he said. The bike was left be
hind and confiscated by the police.
"As it turns out, the bike was stolen," Niemeyer said.
No arrests have been made.
Fire occurs in Building 300
A small paper fire erupted in Building 300 on May 15 at 5:49 p.m.
The Palo Alto Fire Department responded to a manual-pull fire
alarm and located a smoldering recycling bin on the second floor
landing of the English building.
"Someone apparently lighted some papers, some trash in a bar
rel," said Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The fire was extinguished by a sprinkler system. The cause of the
fire is still under investigation.
