Sunday afternoon, Tresidder Union's Oak
Lounge was filled with people discussing South
Asian American culture at the Stanford South
Asian American Conference, "Awaaz: Discover
ing Our Voice."
"We have so many pressing issues in our
community that need to be addressed," said
freshman Hemanth Parasuram, co-chair of
Awaaz, which means "voice." "These type of
conferences for me do a lot of things. You learn
a lot of new things about these issues, you have
an opportunity to hear some fresh new points
and you have a chance to express what your
viewpoints are."
The conference, which has been in the works
for three months, was organized by Parasuram
and junior Puneet Agarwal with the support of
Sanskriti, Stanford's Indian organization. In
cluding Awaaz volunteers, about 150 people at
tended. Awaaz coincided with Mela, the South
Asian American variety show produced by San
skriti.
The conference kicked oIT with a keynote ad
dress by Priya Agarwal, a 1991 Stanford gradu
ate and author of "Passage from India: Post
-1965 Indian Immigrants and Their Children,"
which took a personal look at the Indian immi
grant experience. The book began as her senior
honors thesis in political science.
Agarwal said she at first had abroad focus for
her book, but "it always came back to genera

tional issues." Agarwal issued a challenge to the
audience: "It's time to stop blaming our par
ents. It's time to stop blaming everyone else and
start writing our own history."
Community leaders later participated in
panel discussions on cultural education, politi
cal action, domestic violence and arranged mar
riages.
Throughout the conference, a recurring
theme was the conflict between first-generation
South Asian immigrants and their children. For
example, one panel dealt with how many par
ents still expect to play a part in arranging their
children's marriages, while often the children
wish to marry for love.
Panelist Chitra Divakaruni proposed that
opening the doors of communication could ease
this problem.
"We have this picture of this faint-hearted
Indian parent who will collapse if you tell them
the truth," she said. "I think we just have to
come out and tell them."
Assimilation into American culture was also
a major theme of the conference. At one work
shop, community panelist Michael liao spoke on
his experiences of being Americanized while
growing up.
"Even though there were things about my
culture I knew, I did everything in my power to
be 'American,'" Rao said. "I think it is critical to
be proud of who we are, and I think I missed
some of that."
The conference culminated with a stu
dent / parent panel called "Walking a

Tightrope: Exploring the Question of Identity."
One of the parent panelists, Asha Bajaj, de
fended the parents' perspective.
"If we don't expect anything out of you, we
won't get anything out of you," she said. "I'm
afraid you are boxing us as much as we are box
ing you."
"The thing I want my children to have,
again," she said, "is an open mind, but not just
to be open and not just to be American, but to
really question and take the best elements out
of each culture, and being above being just In
dian or American, but being human."
The panel moved on to other concerns. Mod
erator Raj Apte speculated about the future of
the South Asian American community.
"I have an idea in my head that there is
going to be some steady state five generations
from now where we're either all going to be
'coconuts'; we're all going to be completely
Americanized except for skin color," he said,
"or Indians will form a little Chinatown of
their own.
"They will form a tightly cohesive society
that would exist apart from the general society,"
he said. "I hope that this is not true. I hope that
neither of these extreme examples are what's
going to happen."
Parasuram, who hopes to makes the confer
ence an annual event, said he was pleased with
the audience participation.
"I didn't feel like an organizer," he said. "I
felt like a part of the conference. It was wonder
ful."
