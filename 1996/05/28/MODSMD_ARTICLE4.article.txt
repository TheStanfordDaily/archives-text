# COP says year was focused on advocacy
## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Although often internally divid
ed, this year's Council of Presidents
pushed through an agenda which
focused on student advocacy rather
than communication with the ad
ministration, its members claim.
COP members Mike Choo, Jon
Oram, Rich Stolz and Nicole
Vazquez faced a series of challenges
to the COP's credibility.
Despite being overshadowed by
the issue of ASSU reform, the COP
said they worked on issues ranging
from the implementation of the
Stanford Fund to raising financial
aid awareness to revising the Nom
inations Commission.
"This was a year of challenges,"
said Vazquez. "There were a lot of
possibilities. People began taking
up the possibilities that the ASSU
can offer."
Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen,
next year's single president, echoed
Vazquez's theme of accomplish
ment.
"There is a perception that the
COP didn't do a lot," he said.
"That's not true. Each member of
the COP put in a lot of time. It's a
shame that they couldn't work in
tandem, but independently they ac
complished a lot."
Stolz said ideological differences

often made tasks
more complicat
ed.
"Personality
conflicts made
for a challenging
year," he said. This
year saw a division
among members
of the COP over
whether a single

president would be able to repre
sent a diversity of viewpoints in the
executive branch of the ASSU,
among other issues.
"Division hindered the COP's
performance," said undergraduate
senator Howard Loo. "I wouldn't
praise the COP so much for getting
things accomplished but for their
good faith efforts."
One senator said this difference
of opinion created a more represen
tative COP.
"The COP didn't always see eye
to eye, but this wasn't always a bad
thing," said graduate senator Don
ald Aingworth.
In looking at their accomplish
ments for this year, however, COP
members talked about a variety of
achievements, both individual and
collective.
In the area of student advocacy,
members point to the development


Vazquez
of a financial aid awareness office
and the institution of Financial Aid
Awareness Week.
I n addition, members of the COP
flew to Washington to lobby for in
creased financial aid on Capitol Hill.
"The COP is committed to advo
cating a need-blind admissions poli
cy," Vazquez said. "We as students
are committed to struggling for
that."
The COP said they also worked
in the area of affirmative action,
writing a letter supporting Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper's en
dorsement of affirmative action.
In hopes of spreading awareness
about the issue, the COP was in
volved in organizing the fall visit of
Jesse Jackson to campus.
"We tried to center our efforts
around a few themes," Choo said.

"Accessibility to higher education
was one of them."
In the area of student education,
the COP worked to bring a knowl
edge of the ASSU to students, they
said.
Stolz and Vazquez started a class

— "Student Gov
ernance in a Mul
ticultural Univer
sity" — which ex
amined many is
sues surrounding
student leader
ship.
"We felt that
service learning is
an important

part of education," Vazquez said.
"This was something I had never
seen before," said Nanci Howe, di
rector of the Office of Student Ac
tivities.
Also in the area of leadership
training, the COP has planned a
"Leadership Connection" evening,
a forum for newly elected student

leaders to gather together.
"We felt that coalition building
across organizations was very im
portant," Vazquez said. "We want
ed to provide a way to strengthen
the campus community."
The Leadership Connection will
be held today from 6 to 8 p.m. in
Tresidder Union's Oak West
lounge.
Members of the COP, however,
denied charges that the COP has
concentrated on student issues
rather than building on ties with
the administration.
"It is hard to spend a lot of time
with the administration," Vazquez
said. "The ASSU is pressured to
focus on student issues. However, it
is important for the doors to be open
both ways."
Vazquez said the administration
will have to be willing to make some
compromises if any progress in
communication is to be achieved.
"There needs to be room for de
bate," she said. "It's going to have to

involve a power compromise for the
administration."
The COP has also been involved
with the Office of Student Activities
on several issues, from revising the
party planning process to strength
ening the Nominations Commis
sion.
"The COP had an aggressive

agenda," Howe
said. "I'm not even
sure of the full
scope of what they
did. They worked
particularly hard
to get student
voices heard in the
University."
"We put a lot of
work into revamp-

ingthe Nominations Commission,"
Stolz said. The commission "is
doing pretty well, so we are hoping
this will carry on in the future."
The COP also worked to ease the
transition for the first year of the
Stanford Fund and the student

group partnership, a mechanism
for groups to raise money by work
ing for the Office of Development.
"This is its first year so [the
fund] had its problems," said COP
member Jon Oram. "However,
overall, I'd say it did very well."
Members of the COP, however,
claim particular success in the area
of academics.
Among their accomplishments
were the drafting of a resolution
on teaching assistants which was
presented to the Faculty Senate
and work with a commission
charged with reviewing the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values curricu
lum, they said.
Chrershadowing and, at times,
hindering some of these projects
was the issue of ASSU reform.
"We were divided internally over
the issue of 'Constitution '96,' "
Stolz said. "That made what we did
a lot tougher. There was a lot of
work that we could have done that
we didn't because of that debate."

Another member of the COP
said the passage of the new consti-

tution set the
mood for the
COP. "Seeing the
new constitution
pass set a tone for
a new ASSU,"
Oram said.
Student advo
cacy, however, re
mained the real
strength of this

year's COP, according to COP
members and ASSU senators.
"Hopefully, we were able to
reach out and fight for students on
different issues," Vazquez said.
"We tried to provide a voice where
students traditionally haven't had
one."
"This year's COP worked espe
cially hard on behind-the-scenes ad
vocacy," Shen said. "Each member
of the COP had their own issues and
they pushed hard for them."

portant," Vazquez said. "We want
ed to provide a way to strengthen
the campus community."
The Leadership Connection will
be held today from 6 to 8 p.m. in
Tresidder Union's Oak West
lounge.
Members of the COP, however,
denied charges that the COP has
concentrated on student issues
rather than building on ties with
the administration.
"It is hard to spend a lot of time
with the administration," Vazquez
said. "The ASSU is pressured to
focus on student issues. However, it
is important for the doors to be open
both ways."
Vazquez said the administration
will have to be willing to make some
compromises if any progress in
communication is to be achieved.
"There needs to be room for de
bate," she said. "It's going to have to

involve a power compromise for the
administration."
The COP has also been involved
with the Office of Student Activities
on several issues, from revising the
party planning process to strength
ening the Nominations Commis
sion.
"The COP had an aggressive

agenda," Howe
said. "I'm not even
sure of the full
scope of what they
did. They worked
particularly hard
to get student
voices heard in the
University."
"We put a lot of
work into revamp-

ingthe Nominations Commission,"
Stolz said. The commission "is
doing pretty well, so we are hoping
this will carry on in the future."
The COP also worked to ease the
transition for the first year of the
Stanford Fund and the student

group partnership, a mechanism
for groups to raise money by work
ing for the Office of Development.
"This is its first year so [the
fund] had its problems," said COP
member Jon Oram. "However,
overall, I'd say it did very well."
Members of the COP, however,
claim particular success in the area
of academics.
Among their accomplishments
were the drafting of a resolution
on teaching assistants which was
presented to the Faculty Senate
and work with a commission
charged with reviewing the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values curricu
lum, they said.
Chrershadowing and, at times,
hindering some of these projects
was the issue of ASSU reform.
"We were divided internally over
the issue of 'Constitution '96,' "
Stolz said. "That made what we did
a lot tougher. There was a lot of
work that we could have done that
we didn't because of that debate."

Another member of the COP
said the passage of the new consti-

tution set the
mood for the
COP. "Seeing the
new constitution
pass set a tone for
a new ASSU,"
Oram said.
Student advo
cacy, however, re
mained the real
strength of this

year's COP, according to COP
members and ASSU senators.
"Hopefully, we were able to
reach out and fight for students on
different issues," Vazquez said.
"We tried to provide a voice where
students traditionally haven't had
one."
"This year's COP worked espe
cially hard on behind-the-scenes ad
vocacy," Shen said. "Each member
of the COP had their own issues and
they pushed hard for them."
