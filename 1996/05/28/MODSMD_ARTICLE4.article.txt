# COP says year was focused on advocacy
## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Although often internally divid
ed, this year's Council of Presidents
pushed through an agenda which
focused on student advocacy rather
than communication with the ad
ministration, its members claim.
COP members Mike Choo, Jon
Oram, Rich Stolz and Nicole
Vazquez faced a series of challenges
to the COP's credibility.
Despite being overshadowed by
the issue of ASSU reform, the COP
said they worked on issues ranging
from the implementation of the
Stanford Fund to raising financial
aid awareness to revising the Nom
inations Commission.
"This was a year of challenges,"
said Vazquez. "There were a lot of
possibilities. People began taking
up the possibilities that the ASSU
can offer."
Deputy Senate Chair Bill Shen,
next year's single president, echoed
Vazquez's theme of accomplish
ment.
"There is a perception that the
COP didn't do a lot," he said.
"That's not true. Each member of
the COP put in a lot of time. It's a
shame that they couldn't work in
tandem, but independently they ac
complished a lot."
Stolz said ideological differences

often made tasks
more complicat
ed.
"Personality
conflicts made
for a challenging
year," he said. This
year saw a division
among members
of the COP over
whether a single

president would be able to repre
sent a diversity of viewpoints in the
executive branch of the ASSU,
among other issues.
"Division hindered the COP's
performance," said undergraduate
senator Howard Loo. "I wouldn't
praise the COP so much for getting
things accomplished but for their
good faith efforts."
One senator said this difference
of opinion created a more represen
tative COP.
"The COP didn't always see eye
to eye, but this wasn't always a bad
thing," said graduate senator Don
ald Aingworth.
In looking at their accomplish
ments for this year, however, COP
members talked about a variety of
achievements, both individual and
collective.
