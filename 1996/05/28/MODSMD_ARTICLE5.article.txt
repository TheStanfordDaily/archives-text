# Shen will target 'winnable' fights
## Work with VP Thompson will be a partnership 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
The clock has started â€” ASSU President
elect Bill Shen's one-year term begins tonight
pending certification by the senate. He now
confronts the task of sorting through and pri
oritizing the concerns of his constituents.
"With the few short months we have, we
have to pick our battles, and they have to be
winnable battles," Shen said.
Shen and Vice President-elect Nick Thomp
son, both experienced political activists, placed
particular emphasis on student participation
in the U.S. electoral process.

"We have an election in November. Our
goal is 100 percent total voter registration,"
Shen said. He said he hopes to distribute regis
tration materials using freshman orientation
packets and volunteer labor.
"The ethnic centers have a lot of manpower
and are willing to take the time to do this; the
[ASSU] president and vice president are in a
position to use programming funds to provide
the motor-voter forms," Shen said.
He brushed aside concerns that his associa
tion with Stanford Democrats might under
mine claims to a bipartisan intent.
