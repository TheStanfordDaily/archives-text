# Shen will target 'winnable' fights
## Work with VP Thompson will be a partnership 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
The clock has started — ASSU President
elect Bill Shen's one-year term begins tonight
pending certification by the senate. He now
confronts the task of sorting through and pri
oritizing the concerns of his constituents.
"With the few short months we have, we
have to pick our battles, and they have to be
winnable battles," Shen said.
Shen and Vice President-elect Nick Thomp
son, both experienced political activists, placed
particular emphasis on student participation
in the U.S. electoral process.

"We have an election in November. Our
goal is 100 percent total voter registration,"
Shen said. He said he hopes to distribute regis
tration materials using freshman orientation
packets and volunteer labor.
"The ethnic centers have a lot of manpower
and are willing to take the time to do this; the
[ASSU] president and vice president are in a
position to use programming funds to provide
the motor-voter forms," Shen said.
He brushed aside concerns that his associa
tion with Stanford Democrats might under
mine claims to a bipartisan intent.

"We're not in office to swing the
election one way or another," he
said. "Students are smart enough to
make the right decision."
Shen also hopes the University
will approve a plan to award acade
mic credit for work done outside the
classroom.
"If students can get two units for
water-skiing, they should be able to
get two units for working 60 hours a
week in the Haas Center," Shen
said. "Band, varsity and club sports
all receive academic credit; a com
mitment to service should be simi
larly rewarded."
Stanford used to award such
credit but ended the practice. Shen
said he has not read the report that
ended the practice but was confident
that he could work with the admin
istration to address the shortcom
ings of t he old policy.
Working with the University is at
the center of another Shen objec
tive, the creation of a second endow
ment fund. The second endowment
would invest in "socially responsi
ble," community-building projects
rather than the large multinational
corporations found in the current
endowment's investment portfolio.
"We should give alumni the op
tion of donating to the regular en
dowment that will invest in Texaco

and earn 6 percent or the second
fund which will invest in a commu
nity development bank in East Palo
Alto," Thompson said.
Shen said he hopes to start the
second endowment with funds from
the Senior Class gift and a matching
contribution from Stanford bene
factor and former ASSU President
Peter Bing, The Board of Trustees
has already encouraged the propos
al.
"They told me that it's a great
idea if I could do the legwork,"
Thompson joked. "They also said it
would take me a lifetime to do the
legwork."
Shen, however, is confident that
all sides will work well together to
establish the fund.
"To get the University to make a
commitment, you have to back de
mands up with research, a substan
tial proposal, a realistic timeline and
then work with them," Shen said.
In addition to his policy initia
tives, Shen emphasized his adminis
tration's role in student advocacy.
"The University is legally bound to
recognize us as the representatives
of the student body and meet with
us in that capacity," he said.
Shen plans to use that position to
advocate student interests in issues
such as tuition increases.
"You can keep raising tuition by
inflation, but at some point you
reach a pain threshold where the av
erage family won't be able to afford
tuition," Shen said. "That's one

area we can work in as the newly
elected student body advocates."
Although he did not take issue
with the trustees' recent decision to
raise tuition by 4 percent, he set a
benchmark for concern.
"An increase of more than infla
tion plus 1 [percent] raises an eye
brow."
The problem, according to Shen,
is not merely rising costs but deep
program cuts.
"Stanford's trying to be like
AT&T. They want to be streamlined
and competitive in the academic
market. It's this 'academic market'
that concerns me. ... The Universi
ty is frustrated with itself. It used to
recognize we're unique, we did
things differently."
"Now," Thompson added, "it
seems that U.S. News & World Re
port lives in Building 10; it makes all
the decisions."
Referring to recent proposed cuts
in interdisciplinaiy programs such
as Science, Technology and Society
and East Asian Studies, Shen criti
cized the administration for making
major decisions without consulting
all the involved parties.
"Students, faculty and some ad
ministrators didn't see [decisions]
coming," Shen said. "Decisions are
rooted in Building 10 and don't make
it much fart her. If that's the attitude
I University President Gerhard]
Casper and [Provost Condoleezza]
Rice want to take with academic mat
ters, we'll have a problem next year."

Shen said he also intends to take
the administration to task on the
high student cost of living.
"I want to look at student cost of
living — housing, dining, Tres Ex,"
Shen said. "We pay more for con
sumable goods than elsewhere, and
we want to know why."
His administration, however,
will not make changing food service
a priority.
"Food service is not a winnable
battle. We're fighting a 10- to 15-
year contract monopoly. Our time is
better spent elsewhere."
One area where Shen hopes to
focus that time is gaining University
funding for the Women's Center.
"I authored a resolution in the
senate supporting funding and we'll
follow through with it," Shen said.
"[The Women's Center] has sub
mitted a proposal to the provost, and
I've requested a copy of it. The
provost seemed unwilling to allocate
extra funds for the center. They'll
spend $1 million on [emergency]
telephones but don't want to give
$20,000 for a center that serves over
half of this campus."
A self-proclaimed "ASSU insid
er," Shen's broad reform plan does
not spare student government. Top
ping the list of his internal initia
tives is a major change in campaign
regulations.
"Everything is on the table,"
Shen said.
He will consider proposals to
limit the number of fliers candidates

are allowed to post, increase World
Wide Web-based campaigning and
make it easier to vote.
"We'll take the lead on [campaign
reform]," Shen promised. "[Elec
tions Commissioner] Ryan Medders
has started work on reform, and we
will bring it forth at the first senate
meeting of the academic year."
In his new role as president, how
ever, Shen hopes to rise above the
partisan politics of the senate.
"The senate is a place for presen
tation of certain interests; when
you're the president and vice presi
dent you are supposed to be the voice
for every single student," Shen said.
"We put together a [ticket] with
support from both parties," he said.
"I intend to be in open dialogue with
[People's] Platform senators and
[Students'] Alliance senators. I
want to be a coalition builder within
the senate."
Although he vowed to attend sen
ate meetings, neither he nor
Thompson will be actively involved
in its debates.
Under the ASSU Constitution
the vice president may, at his discre
tion, preside over the senate.
Thompson, however, said he will
leave that duty to Senate Chair Don
Aingworth.
Thompson also gave assurances
that he will not seek to repeal the
controversial Bone-Overdeck
Amendment. Passed in 1991, the
amendment prohibits the senate
from debating issues not directly af

fecting Stanford students. A long
time critic of the restriction, Thomp
son reaffirmed his opposition but
said he would not actively seek to
strike it from the constitution.
"I have strong feelings, but I
know when not to fight," Thompson
conceded. "I'm not going to go piss
ing against brick walls."
Although Thompson is deferring
to Shen's concerns on the Bone-
Overdeck Amendment, the presi
dent-elect characterized the rela
tionship with his running mate as a
partnership.
"For both the president and the
vice president, we're going to define
the role for years to come," Shen
said. "I see Nick on equal footing
with myself as a student advo
cate. ... There is no real hierarchy."
Addressing concerns that such a
partnership was contrary to the in
tentions of the constitution, Shen
could not offer assurances that the
new executive structure will be any
different than the old Council of
Presidents.
"There's no guarantee," he ad
mitted. However, he plans to draw
on his experience in student govern
ment to seek University response to
student concerns.
"We have a strong commitment
to a strong dialogue with students,"
Shen said. "That's going to mean
grassroots and a few dining hall din
ners. We were elected by the stu
dents, and that's who we intend to
serve."

and competitive in the academic
market. It's this 'academic market'
that concerns me. ... The Universi
ty is frustrated with itself. It used to
recognize we're unique, we did
things differently."
"Now," Thompson added, "it
seems that U.S. News & World Re
port lives in Building 10; it makes all
the decisions."
Referring to recent proposed cuts
in interdisciplinaiy programs such
as Science, Technology and Society
and East Asian Studies, Shen criti
cized the administration for making
major decisions without consulting
all the involved parties.
"Students, faculty and some ad
ministrators didn't see [decisions]
coming," Shen said. "Decisions are
rooted in Building 10 and don't make
it much fart her. If that's the attitude
I University President Gerhard]
Casper and [Provost Condoleezza]
Rice want to take with academic mat
ters, we'll have a problem next year."

Shen said he also intends to take
the administration to task on the
high student cost of living.
"I want to look at student cost of
living — housing, dining, Tres Ex,"
Shen said. "We pay more for con
sumable goods than elsewhere, and
we want to know why."
His administration, however,
will not make changing food service
a priority.
"Food service is not a winnable
battle. We're fighting a 10- to 15-
year contract monopoly. Our time is
better spent elsewhere."
One area where Shen hopes to
focus that time is gaining University
funding for the Women's Center.
"I authored a resolution in the
senate supporting funding and we'll
follow through with it," Shen said.
"[The Women's Center] has sub
mitted a proposal to the provost, and
I've requested a copy of it. The
provost seemed unwilling to allocate
extra funds for the center. They'll
spend $1 million on [emergency]
telephones but don't want to give
$20,000 for a center that serves over
half of this campus."
A self-proclaimed "ASSU insid
er," Shen's broad reform plan does
not spare student government. Top
ping the list of his internal initia
tives is a major change in campaign
regulations.
"Everything is on the table,"
Shen said.
He will consider proposals to
limit the number of fliers candidates

are allowed to post, increase World
Wide Web-based campaigning and
make it easier to vote.
"We'll take the lead on [campaign
reform]," Shen promised. "[Elec
tions Commissioner] Ryan Medders
has started work on reform, and we
will bring it forth at the first senate
meeting of the academic year."
In his new role as president, how
ever, Shen hopes to rise above the
partisan politics of the senate.
"The senate is a place for presen
tation of certain interests; when
you're the president and vice presi
dent you are supposed to be the voice
for every single student," Shen said.
"We put together a [ticket] with
support from both parties," he said.
"I intend to be in open dialogue with
[People's] Platform senators and
[Students'] Alliance senators. I
want to be a coalition builder within
the senate."
Although he vowed to attend sen
ate meetings, neither he nor
Thompson will be actively involved
in its debates.
Under the ASSU Constitution
the vice president may, at his discre
tion, preside over the senate.
Thompson, however, said he will
leave that duty to Senate Chair Don
Aingworth.
Thompson also gave assurances
that he will not seek to repeal the
controversial Bone-Overdeck
Amendment. Passed in 1991, the
amendment prohibits the senate
from debating issues not directly af

fecting Stanford students. A long
time critic of the restriction, Thomp
son reaffirmed his opposition but
said he would not actively seek to
strike it from the constitution.
"I have strong feelings, but I
know when not to fight," Thompson
conceded. "I'm not going to go piss
ing against brick walls."
Although Thompson is deferring
to Shen's concerns on the Bone-
Overdeck Amendment, the presi
dent-elect characterized the rela
tionship with his running mate as a
partnership.
"For both the president and the
vice president, we're going to define
the role for years to come," Shen
said. "I see Nick on equal footing
with myself as a student advo
cate. ... There is no real hierarchy."
Addressing concerns that such a
partnership was contrary to the in
tentions of the constitution, Shen
could not offer assurances that the
new executive structure will be any
different than the old Council of
Presidents.
"There's no guarantee," he ad
mitted. However, he plans to draw
on his experience in student govern
ment to seek University response to
student concerns.
"We have a strong commitment
to a strong dialogue with students,"
Shen said. "That's going to mean
grassroots and a few dining hall din
ners. We were elected by the stu
dents, and that's who we intend to
serve."
The clock has started — ASSU President
elect Bill Shen's one-year term begins tonight
pending certification by the senate. He now
confronts the task of sorting through and pri
oritizing the concerns of his constituents.
"With the few short months we have, we
have to pick our battles, and they have to be
winnable battles," Shen said.
Shen and Vice President-elect Nick Thomp
son, both experienced political activists, placed
particular emphasis on student participation
in the U.S. electoral process.

"We have an election in November. Our
goal is 100 percent total voter registration,"
Shen said. He said he hopes to distribute regis
tration materials using freshman orientation
packets and volunteer labor.
"The ethnic centers have a lot of manpower
and are willing to take the time to do this; the
[ASSU] president and vice president are in a
position to use programming funds to provide
the motor-voter forms," Shen said.
He brushed aside concerns that his associa
tion with Stanford Democrats might under
mine claims to a bipartisan intent.

"We're not in office to swing the
election one way or another," he
said. "Students are smart enough to
make the right decision."
Shen also hopes the University
will approve a plan to award acade
mic credit for work done outside the
classroom.
"If students can get two units for
water-skiing, they should be able to
get two units for working 60 hours a
week in the Haas Center," Shen
said. "Band, varsity and club sports
all receive academic credit; a com
mitment to service should be simi
larly rewarded."
Stanford used to award such
credit but ended the practice. Shen
said he has not read the report that
ended the practice but was confident
that he could work with the admin
istration to address the shortcom
ings of t he old policy.
Working with the University is at
the center of another Shen objec
tive, the creation of a second endow
ment fund. The second endowment
would invest in "socially responsi
ble," community-building projects
rather than the large multinational
corporations found in the current
endowment's investment portfolio.
"We should give alumni the op
tion of donating to the regular en
dowment that will invest in Texaco

and earn 6 percent or the second
fund which will invest in a commu
nity development bank in East Palo
Alto," Thompson said.
Shen said he hopes to start the
second endowment with funds from
the Senior Class gift and a matching
contribution from Stanford bene
factor and former ASSU President
Peter Bing, The Board of Trustees
has already encouraged the propos
al.
"They told me that it's a great
idea if I could do the legwork,"
Thompson joked. "They also said it
would take me a lifetime to do the
legwork."
Shen, however, is confident that
all sides will work well together to
establish the fund.
"To get the University to make a
commitment, you have to back de
mands up with research, a substan
tial proposal, a realistic timeline and
then work with them," Shen said.
In addition to his policy initia
tives, Shen emphasized his adminis
tration's role in student advocacy.
"The University is legally bound to
recognize us as the representatives
of the student body and meet with
us in that capacity," he said.
Shen plans to use that position to
advocate student interests in issues
such as tuition increases.
"You can keep raising tuition by
inflation, but at some point you
reach a pain threshold where the av
erage family won't be able to afford
tuition," Shen said. "That's one

area we can work in as the newly
elected student body advocates."
Although he did not take issue
with the trustees' recent decision to
raise tuition by 4 percent, he set a
benchmark for concern.
"An increase of more than infla
tion plus 1 [percent] raises an eye
brow."
The problem, according to Shen,
is not merely rising costs but deep
program cuts.
"Stanford's trying to be like
AT&T. They want to be streamlined
and competitive in the academic
market. It's this 'academic market'
that concerns me. ... The Universi
ty is frustrated with itself. It used to
recognize we're unique, we did
things differently."
"Now," Thompson added, "it
seems that U.S. News & World Re
port lives in Building 10; it makes all
