# Row houses top Draw; ethnic houses go last
## Spots in Bob first choice for both men and women 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Contributing writer 
Shouts of joy and groans of frustration
could be heard throughout campus Saturday
as students discovered their housing assign
ments for next year.
As usual, the most popular housing options
were located on the Row. The quest for Row
occupancy was even more challenging this
year, with Bob, Storey, Xanadu and 553 May
field all drawing under 400. Bob once again

won top honors for both men and women,
drawing at an astounding 39 for men.
Because the Delta Tau Delta fraternity lost
its house earlier this year, 353 Campus Drive
was included in this spring's Draw. The for
mer fraternity house was popular, drawing at
541 for women and 820 for men.
While 190 students were not assigned
housing in the Draw last year, only 131 were
unassigned this year. According to Bill


Sothy Chhe â€” Daily
Georges, manager of Housing As
signment Services, "The big drop in
unassigned students can be attrib
uted to the fact that the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity house is in the
Draw this year. This added addi
tional housing spaces to the Draw."
Unassigned students should
apply to the waiting list if they still
want to receive an assignment.
Georges said he expects all students
on the waiting list, whether they
are using a guaranteed year or not,
to be assigned housing by the end of
the first week of school next fall.
There were only slight varia
tions between this year's top five
residences and last year's. Kimball
changed places with Xanadu, to be
come the men's third most popular
residence. Storey and Xanadu
moved up to the second and third
most popular residences for
women, pushing 557 Mayfield
down to fourth most popular.
One oddity in this year's Draw
results was that the French House,
although it is scheduled to be re
modeled this summer under the
Capital Improvement Program,
was the least popular residence for
men. Residences scheduled for re
modeling usually draw higher than
they did in previous years. The
French House, however, after an
increase in popularity last year,
when itdrewat 1,182 for men, drew
2,930 this year for men.
The promise of updated facilities
attracted the attention of women.
There was an increase in popularity
of the French House, from 2,645 to
401, among women.

Kairos and the Delta Kappa Ep
silon fraternity house are also
scheduled for remodeling this sum
mer under the Capital Improve
ment Program. Anticipation of im
provements at Kairos did not seem
to affect the co-operative's popular
ity in the Draw.
Hammarskjold experienced a
substantial increase in popularity
this year among students. The in
ternational focus house drew at
1,771 for men, an increase of 942
from last year, and 1,028 for
women, an increase 0f683 from last
year.
The popularity of Alpha Sigma,
Durand and Slavianskii Dom also
surged this year.
Ethnic theme houses did not fair
well in the women's Draw this year.
Three of the least popular residences
for women were theme houses.
Okada, the Asian-American theme
house, drew 2,915; Ujamaa, the
African-American theme house,
drew 2,921 and Casa Zapata, the
Chicano / Latino theme house, drew
last at 2,955. Casa Zapata was the
least popular residence overall, bare
ly missing a slot on the list of the five
least popular residences for men.
Housing was assigned to all
graduate student couples and grad
uate students with children.
According to Georges, 90 per
cent of single graduate students re
ceived assignments. A small num
ber of single graduates who were
unassigned will be assigned hous
ing during this fall's walk-ons, but
Georges said the remainder will
have to find their own housing ofT
campus.
Priority for graduate, student
housing is given to new graduate
students who apply over the sum
mer.
