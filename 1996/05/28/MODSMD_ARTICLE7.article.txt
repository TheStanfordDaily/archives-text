# Credit Union's Pagano gets 15 minutes

Editor's note: In 1968, Andy Warhol made the
oft-quoted (and misquoted) statement, "In the
future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes."
With that in mind, in addition to the idea that
everyone has a story to tell, this article is the
third in a series about various members of the
Stanford community. Interview subjects are
picked entirely at random from the Stanford Di
rectory.

Members of
the Stanford
Federal Credit
Union might
be reassured
to know that

Sandy Pagano, vice president of finance and ac
counting, has a long history of being fiscally re
sponsible: As a 16-year-old in Elizabeth, N.J.,
Pagano was voted Treasurer of the Year by the
local Junior Achievement Club.
"I was flown out to Chicago, then down to
Peoria," Pagano said. "All the Treasurers of the
Year came and had a personalized tour of the
Caterpillar tractor plant in Peoria. It was my
first trip on an airplane."
Now almost 50, Pagano is still a treasurer of
sorts. "I'm part of the management team of the
Credit Union," Pagano explained. "I'm involved
in strategic planning and budgeting and busi
ness analysis. I'm also responsible for corporate
accounting."

As vice president of the Stanford Federal Credit Union, Sandy Pagano, a former high
school Treasurer of the Year, plans and keeps track of strategic planning and budgeting.

Pagano, who has been em
ployed by the Credit Union for
seven years, arrived at her posi
tion through a somewhat indirect
route.
Born Sandra Ziemian in
Newark, N.J., Pagnno was the sec
ond of five children. Her father,
the son of Polish immigrants, op
erated a hardware store, and her
mother was a registered nurse.
"On my mother's side, I could join
the Daughters of the American
Revolution," Pagano mentioned.
As a child, Pagano attended St.
Genevieve's, a Catholic school in
Elizabeth. Her best year was
eighth grade, she said, because
"the teacher was so challenging
but fun. I was a good student over
all."
In high school, Pagano moved
to Battin High School, which was
at the time "the only all-girl pub
lic high school in New Jersey. In
Elizabeth, someone had donated
some land [close to the already ex

isting high school], and the only
way they could split the school
was male and female. The schools
were about a mile apart."
Pagano characterized her high
school experience as "very posi
tive." She did not mind attending
a single-sex school, she said. "We
had a close relationship with the
boys' school. Several of my friends
were cheerleaders and such for
the boys' sports teams."
Though Pagano herself was
not a cheerleader, she was a mem
ber of both Future Teachers of
America and Blue Bells, an orga
nization for hospital volunteers.
Pagano anticipated a career in
teaching and got an early start. "I
actually went back to St.
Genevieve's and taught science
because they didn't have science
in their curriculum. I got out of
school at 1 o'clock and went to
teach the sixth-graders."
As a senior in high school,
Pagano was offered a partial
scholarship to study physics at
Bradley College in Peoria, 111.
However, she said, "It was not fi
nancially possible for my family to
make up the rest of the money."

Pagano enrolled instead at
Kean College in Union, N.J., a
teaching college. During the sec
ond semester of her freshman
year, she left in order to marry
Rocky Pagano, whom she had met
the year before.
"I met him in a bowling alley
across the street from the small
hotel where I was working the
summer after graduating from
high school," Pagano said. The
Paganos briefly managed an
apartment building together in
the Asbury Park area.
"I hung out at Mrs. Jay's, a bar
on the same street as the Stone
Pony, the place where (Bruce]
Springsteen got his start,"
Pagano said. Unfortunately,
Pagano said she never had the op
portunity to see Springsteen per
form.
After managing the apartment
building with her husband,
Pagano went to work for a bank.
"I became head teller and assis
tant manager. I helped out one of
a Pepsi's bottler's accounting peo
ple reconcile a bank statement
problem, and I was offered a job
by the Pepsi bottlers." Pagano ac

cepted the job and stayed with
PepsiCo for five years.
By the winter of 1974, Pagano
again wished to move on, both in
terms of her career and in terms
of her marriage. She and Rocky
had not had children, and they
separated after 8 1/2 years of mar
riage. Pagano decided to come to
California. Though she had never
visited before, the state appealed
to her for two reasons
"I wanted to see Disneyland,"
she said. In addition, Pagano said,
"I had [always] lived in beach
communities. I had watched the
sun rise many a morning over the
ocean, and I wanted to see the
other half of the show, the sun
setting on the ocean."
Neither of Pagano's expecta
tions of California was disap
pointed, she said, although she
initially had a bit of trouble locat
ing Disneyland. "After spending
the better part of an afternoon
going in circles on the freeway, it
was wonderful," she said. "I grew
up with the Mickey Mouse Club,
and I was actually getting to see
those things you dream of when
you're a child."

Post-Disneyland, Paganocame
north and stayed with a cousin in
San Francisco. She had driven to
California with all her posses
sions, anticipating the possibility
of relocating permanently, and
seeing San Francisco confirmed
this possibility. "I just sort of fell
in love with San Francisco,"
Pagano said. "It had a much more
personal feeling than New York.
It was much cleaner. There was
something very comfortable
about it. There still is."
Pagano has stayed in the Bay
Area for the past two decades, liv
ing in several different towns and
working at several different jobs,
all of which have involved financial
management. Currently, she lives
in a condo in Mountain View with
her cats Mouse, Hissy-Fit and
Blackjack. Her feline menagerie
aside, Pagano described herself as
"single and unattached."
However, Pagano does not lack
ways of keeping busy. In addition
to reading adventure and mystery
novels, she is in the midst of the
"ongoing process" of decorating
her condo. "I'm landscaping my 6
by 12 patio," Pagano joked.

More significantly, Pagano de
votes most of her free time to pur
suing her education. In 1993, she
received a bachelor's degree from
the College of Notre Dame in Bel
mont, and she is now working to
ward a master's. "I just kind of
enjoy the learning process, to
learn new things and interact with
other students, most of whom are
working adults," she said.
Pagano's life as a student is not
all work, she said. After earning
her bachelor's degree, Pagano
traveled to Australia as "my grad
uation gift to myself," she said. "I
went with two girlfriends for
three weeks."
The trip included the highlight
of her life, Pagano said. "The best
time of my life was being on top of
Ayers Rock. It's the best-known
geographic landmark in Aus
tralia, in the middle of the desert,
on Aboriginal sacred ground. I'm
not a particularly physical person,
so climbing the rock was an
achievement for me. The first
part is so steep you need a chain
rope to climb.
"Australia was a longtime
dream."
