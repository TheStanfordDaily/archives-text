# Credit Union's Pagano gets 15 minutes

Editor's note: In 1968, Andy Warhol made the
oft-quoted (and misquoted) statement, "In the
future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes."
With that in mind, in addition to the idea that
everyone has a story to tell, this article is the
third in a series about various members of the
Stanford community. Interview subjects are
picked entirely at random from the Stanford Di
rectory.

Members of
the Stanford
Federal Credit
Union might
be reassured
to know that

Sandy Pagano, vice president of finance and ac
counting, has a long history of being fiscally re
sponsible: As a 16-year-old in Elizabeth, N.J.,
Pagano was voted Treasurer of the Year by the
local Junior Achievement Club.
"I was flown out to Chicago, then down to
Peoria," Pagano said. "All the Treasurers of the
Year came and had a personalized tour of the
Caterpillar tractor plant in Peoria. It was my
first trip on an airplane."
Now almost 50, Pagano is still a treasurer of
sorts. "I'm part of the management team of the
Credit Union," Pagano explained. "I'm involved
in strategic planning and budgeting and busi
ness analysis. I'm also responsible for corporate
accounting."
