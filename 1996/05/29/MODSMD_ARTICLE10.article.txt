### Jimmy Boegle Staff writer 
Seven journalists from around the world were re
cently named International Knight Fellows for the
1996-97 school year.
The group was selected from a pool of approxi
mately 100 applicants, according to Jim Bettinger,
deputy director of the Knight Fellows Program.
"We apply pretty much the same selection process
to the international fellows as the U.S. fellows," Bet
tinger said. "The fellows are all really good, have a lot
of ambition and could make good use of a year at Stan
ford."
The 12 U.S. fellows were announced April 30.
Knight Fellow candidates must submit an essay
about their careers, an essay outlining their study
plans, letters of recommendation and samples of their
work.
Each Knight Fellow will take a leave of absence
from his or her current job to study at Stanford for a
year. During the year, the fellows will take classes

from a number of departments and research journal
ism topics of their choice.
The funds to support the international fellows
come from a variety of sources, Bettinger said, includ
ing the Reuter Foundation, the Lyle and Corrine Nel
son International Fellowship Fund, the Egon Scot
land Memorial Fellowship Fund, the Fulbright and
the Michener Awards Foundation, as well as the
Knight Foundation. The funds for the U.S. fellows
come solely from the Knight Foundation.
The fellows include Heather Abbott, senior pro
ducer of "Sunday Morning" for CBC Radio in Toron
to; Rodrigo Carpio, general director of El Grafico in
Guatemala City; Anna Husarska, contributing editor
for The New Republic as well as a staff writer for The
