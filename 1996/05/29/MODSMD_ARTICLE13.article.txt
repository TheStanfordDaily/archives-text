# Jury convicts Whitewater defendants

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) â€” In a major
blow to President Clinton's hopes of putting
Whitewater behind him before Election Day,
his former business partners, James and
Susan McDougal, and Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy
Tucker were convicted of fraud yesterday.
Tucker, a Democrat who succeeded Clinton
as governor, later announced he would resign
his post July 15.
A federal jury in the first trial to emerge
from the investigation into the Arkansas real
estate venture deliberated eight days before
convicting all three defendants, despite the
president's videotaped testimony as the star
witness for the defense.
"At 5 p.m. today, the cover up began to
unravel," said Tony Blankley, House Speaker
Newt Gingrich's spokesman.
At the White House, Clinton said he feels
sorry "on a personal level" for his three
Arkansas friends. Asked whether the verdict
meant the jurors did not believe him when he

testified he took no part in discussions about
illegal loans, he said: "I doubt that. I doubt
that that's what was going on, but you ought
to ask them."
McDougal was convicted on 18 of 19 counts
of fraud and conspiracy, and Tucker was
found guilty on two of seven counts. Mrs.
McDougal was convicted on all four fraud
related charges against her.
Tucker said he needed to resign the gover
norship so he could work on his appeals.
"The people of the state should not be put
through that," Tucker said.
He will be succeeded by Republican Lt.
Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is also the GOP
candidate for U.S. Senate.
Tucker and McDougal were convicted of
conspiring to arrange nearly $3 million in
loans from two federally backed banks, includ
ing the McDougals' Madison Guaranty Saving
and Loan, via fraudulent appraisals, and using
the money for certain business expenses and

other improper purposes.
Mrs. McDougal was convicted of fraud, mis
application of funds and other charges for ille
gally benefiting from a $300,00U loan made in
the 1986, when Clinton was governor.
The prosecution's chief witness, former
banker David 1 lale, claimed two years ago that
Clinton pressured him to make the loan to
Mrs. McDougal in the mid-1980s when Clin
ton was governor. An FBI agent testified that
nearly $50,000 of the loan went improperly to
Whitewater transactions.
In videotaped testimony played for the
jury, Clinton denied exerting any such pres
sure and said he never talked to Hale about
money and didn't know about the Whitewater
transactions the FBI agent mentioned.
"It's not up to me to make the determina
tion about what the verdicts mean to the
Whitewater investigation or President Clin
ton," said the chief prosecutor at the trial, W.
Ray Jahn.
