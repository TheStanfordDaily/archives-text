Appointment of female
rabbi calls into question
Mem Chu's role on campus

Memorial church has
just hired a female
Reform Rabbi to fill one of
its associate dean positions. By
making such an unprecedented
move, Memorial Church has once
again made itself the focus of cam
pus attention and, in doing so, has
raised some serious questions
about its official role at Stanford.
The appropriateness of main
taining an established church on
campus is, in itself, debatable. In
the past, Memorial church has
come under fire from conservative
Christians and non-Christians
alike. Many Catholics and tradi
tionalist Christians feel put off by
the liberal Protestant clergy who
run Memorial Church; the homo
sexual commitment ceremony a lit
tle over a year ago in the church
came to symbolize, for many, the
abandonment of traditional Chris
tian teachings. On the other side of
the spectrum, non-Christians and
secular students have wondered
why the University supports a bla
tantly Christian institution in the
first place. Anybody who maintains
that the church is non-denomina
tional and, thus, amenable to every
religion need only direct his or her
eyes to the large cross atop the
mural of Jesus. It seems silly to
belabor the point, but Memorial
Church is, after all, a Christian
house of worship. There is no rea
son for anyone to pretend other
wise.
The Church's decision to hire a
Jewish rabbi to fill one of its lead
ership posts is thus, at the very
least, curious. One can understand
the benevolent impulse behind the
move to include Jewish interests in
the church; in this time of multi
culturalism and religious plural
ism, the church has made a con

scious effort to expand its relevan
cy to the student body. But expan
sion of church functions to include
Jews is not a sign of benevolence;
rather, it smacks of a paternalistic
attempt to co-opt the largest reli
gious minority on campus.
One wonders what the Dean of
Memorial Church Robert Gregg
means when he says students go to
see the church chaplains "as mem
bers of the University, not with
respect to their individual reli
gious identities." Are Hindu stu
dents really served by Lutheran
and Episcopalian pastors? Do
Orthodox Jewish students ever
look to a female Reform Rabbi for
spiritual guidance?
Memorial Church was founded
according to Jane Stanford's wishes
as a non-denominational Protes
tant church, a progressive stance
for the turn of the century. But, as
even Gregg admits, times have
changed, and Stanford's demo
graphics have changed, too. Stan
ford is no longer the preserve of the
West Coast Protestant elite, and it is
unclear how a church is to fulfill the
multiple religious needs of the cur
rent student body. When Memorial
Church has trouble pleasing the
Christian population on campus,
how do the chaplains propose to
adequately provide religious guid
ance to all Stanford students?
There may be good reasons for
maintaining Memorial Church,
but it is time to call a spade a
spade; a church is a church, and a
church has its limits. Rabbi Kar
lin-Neumann's credentials to lead
a religious community are not in
question here, but her appoint
ment appears to be a desperate
attempt by an archaic institution
to diversify. Tokenism is not diver
sity.
Hopefully, the counterintuitive
headline "Rabbi fills associate
dean post at church" will spark a
wide-ranging discussion of religion
at Stanford. It is high time Stan
ford students and administrators
reassessed the structure and role
of religious institutions inside the
University.
