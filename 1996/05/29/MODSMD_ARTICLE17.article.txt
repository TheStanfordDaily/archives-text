## Seeking a place in the world 
### 
I SHOCKED MYSELF this weekend.
For reasons I can't divine now, I
prayed. Earnestly. Silently. Almost
devoutly.
I rejoiced in my health, my friends, my
family and an open future. Heartwarming
things. Break out the Velveeta.
Even more surprisingly, I left behind
the narcissism, the cynicism, the rush to
judge others, the intellectual wannabeism.
My venom left me.
Of course, it came back. So instead of
accepting a brief transcendent moment,
I've asked the inevitable.
Why do we yearn for look for meaning
in some religious form?
There are two easy correlated dis
missals for why religion catches on. One is
inculcation, the other that religion is a
delusion.
Inculcation: If you've been proselytized
enough, you'll end up believing it. God's a
three for the price of one, a cosmic case of
separate but equal? A 600-year-old man led
a group of people from Egypt to a chunk of
real estate given straight from God? An
archangel brought a great revelation to
some guy in Illinois? Pretty implausible
stuff, at least in our age. If you're going to
accept whatever religion as a literal truth,
somebody has to drill it into your head. 1
went to a Unitarian Universalist church,
known as Protestant Lite® in ecclesiastical
circles. Don't believe Jesus was the Son of
God? That's cool with your minister. Of
course, the skepticism I've been granted as

a Unitarian means, in the eyes of most of
Christendom, I'm a May Pole and a sacrifi
cial goat away from heathendom. And that
skepticism I've been ingrained with is, at
some level, no different from the faith I
might have developed in, say, a strict
Catholic tradition.
The correlated dismissal of faith is that
religion is just delusions, both for an indi
vidual and for society. A lot of people con
vert at difficult junctures in their lives. Had
a tough life? Forgiveness and salvation.
Can't put your kids through college? Your
efforts will give you acceptance in the here
after. Church is a more effective distraction
than Thursday night on NBC. Eighty mil
lion Americans are at religious services on
any given Sunday — Super Bowls and non
presidential elections get about 50 million,
for comparison. You get tricked, you have
something to do with yourself. End of story.
Delusion and inculcation, sufficient
explanations for me for a long time, seem
inadequate now. For starters, a majority of
people have to be malleable and a little
dense for the theory to work. More impor
tant is the impact religion (meaning most
ly Chrisitanity, with some Judaism and
Islam tossed in) has on the lives of those
who practice it.
The typical metaphor is faith as a bea
con — but I prefer faith as a firmament.
Yes, religion can be a goal, but it can also be
a source of stability that helps some under
stand and cope with problem sets and
death, lost wallets and lost friends. Strong

faith seems to make people happier and
give a better sense of placement in the
world.
Now, the joy can be ersatz. Intimacy
can't hurt if it's postponed, but it brings no
joy either. If you surround yourself with
your brothers and sisters in faith, then
you've assured yourself acceptance, but
lost a bit of spice. Without the payoff of
heaven, without friends partially homoge
nized by a creed, without the rewards that
some temptations bring, is the happiness
true?
Perhaps. Perhaps not.
But then there's another facet. Reli
gion, better than anything I can think of,
teaches one one's real position in the
world. It's very easy for The Daily, the
ASSU, a girl / boyfriend, Rush, a concert, a
resume or the promise of UCSF med
school to become almost encompassing.
But they don't.
But religion says do good here, for there
are greater things beyond here. Communi
ty service serves the same purpose. At
times, the outward directness fails, and
petty politics or load concerns grow. But
on the whole, religion, broadly defined,
seems the best way to recall where we
stand in Creation.
Thus, I prayed.
