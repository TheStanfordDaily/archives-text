Students must actively avoid Texaco products

STANFORD DRIVERS: be aware of
where you buy your gas. Beacon
gasoline — the brand currently sold
at our own Campus Service Station — is
arguably the most environmentally and
socially responsible of the gasoline brands
sold in this area. Unfortunately, Campus
Service is currently considering switching
to gasoline sold by Texaco, a corporation
considered irresponsible even by oil stan
dards. While the oil industry carries with
it certain inherent evils, the social and
environmental records of oil companies
are not all the same, and Beacon and Tex
aco represent two ends of the spectrum.
According to Progressive Asset Man
agement, an investment responsibility

research firm, both corporations donate
money to highly visible organizations
such as symphonies and to charities in
the communities where they operate (and
often pollute). While Beacon's environ
mental record ranks among the best, the
Council on Economic Priorities repeated
ly cites Texaco as the worst polluter in
the industry. The human rights records
of these companies make an even clearer
distinction. After the Nigerian govern
ment, despite international outrage,
hanged civil rights activist Ken Saro-
Wiwa to quiet his protest of the devasta
tion of his homeland by oil companies,
Beacon stopped buying crude oil from
Nigeria. In contrast, Texaco, in their pur

suit of the natural gas off the coast of
Burma, continues their support of the
illegitimate Burmese military dictator
ship.
Despite the regime's murder of thou
sands of students and monks, despite
their continuing use of torture and rape
to ensure compliance with forced labor,
despite the plea of Nobel prize winner
Aung San Suu Kyi and the other elected
representatives of the Burmese people
not to do business in Burma until democ
racy has been attained, Texaco continues
to give legitimacy and hard currency to a
regime that has outlawed the very men
tion of the phrase "civil rights." Texaco
has been further indicted for severe pol

lution of the Ecuadorian rain forests and
rivers leading to deaths and illness
among the native people, and for negli
gence resulting in the explosion of their
Wilmington, Calif, refinery which hospi
talized hundreds of residents of the sur
rounding low-income community.
Be conscious of what your money sup
ports. Don't, in even the smallest way, be
complicit with the evil perpetrated and
underwritten by Texaco. When you buy
from Campus Service let them know
you're buying Beacon deliberately, and
that you'll just as deliberately avoid fill
ing your tank with Texaco gas.
