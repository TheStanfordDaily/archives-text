# Stanford should praise its athletic tradition
## 
### 
This letter is in regard to a somewhat
offensive and narrow-minded column
that was published in last Wednesday's
Daily. The column ridiculed the Stan
ford Athletics Department and its
prominent position on campus, in the
country and, in fact, in the world. The
author, James G. Wheaton, cited several
reasons why Stanford should drop its
athletic program — a program which is
without a doubt the finest college athlet
ic / academic program in the country.
Wheaton seems to be under the false
assumption that a varsity athlete can't
be at once a dedicated athlete and a driv
en student. He feels that the 700 or so
varsity athletes who make up 10 percent
of the University's undergraduate
enrollment are a hindrance to the aca
demic progress of the University as a
whole, because they have diversified
interests that let them explore their full
range of talents. I find his statement —
that an athlete's main focus can't be
academics — offensive and naive. I am

glad to see that Stanford does take pride
in its athletic program, as it well should.
I think that Stanford is concerned with
creating a well-rounded student body
that excels at academics, social activism
and athletics. It is the well-rounded
Stanford student that will lead this
country into the next millennium.
The author also forwarded the notion
that Stanford student-athletes are to
blame for a large part of the crime and
misconduct on campus. This is a false
perception which is due mainly to the
fact that student-athletes are in the pub
lic eye. The actions of a student-athlete,
whether good or bad, are more likely to
be brought to attention than the actions
of a student who is not a varsity athlete.
Wheaton also cites at least one incident
that had extemporaneous circumstances
that he conveniently withheld.
Overall, I believe that Stanford stu
dent athletes are some of the most well
rounded and amazing people I've ever
had the pleasure of knowing. They
spend as much time on academics and
social activism as any other Stanford
student. I think that Stanford should be
very proud of its athletic program,
because it stands as a benchmark for

every other university in the country.
