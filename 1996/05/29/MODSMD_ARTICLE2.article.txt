# Heart transplant patient Jensen prompts anti-discrimination bill
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Editorial staff 
The California State Assembly passed a
bill yesterday prohibiting doctors from dis
criminating against disabled people in de
cisions regarding organ transplant recipi
ents.
The bill, passed in the assembly on a 62-
0 vote, was in response to the case of heart
patient Sandra Jensen, who received a
transplant at Stanford Hospital in Janu
ary.
Both Stanford and UC-San Diego origi

nally refused to consider the application
for a heart-lung transplant to Jensen, a 35-
year-old Sacramento woman with Down
syndrome. The hospitals said Jensen
lacked the mental capacity to participate in
the medical care necessary after the opera
tion.
After Jensen publicized her case, Stan
ford reversed its decision.
Assemblyman Antonio ViUaraigosa, D-
IjOs Angeles, sponsored the bill, which
would forbid discrimination on the basis of
a potential recipient's disability at any
point in the organ transplant. The bill is in

accordance with the American Disabilities
Act of 1990.
Villaraigosa said the hospitals original
ly rejected Jensen without evaluating her.
"Stanford sent [Jensen] an initial rejection
letter stating they feel patients with Down
syndrome do not make appropriate candi
dates for organ transplants," Villaraigosa
said. "This is totally unacceptable."
Each case will be reviewed on its merits,
so hospitals am make except ions if the dis
ability is medically significant.
"This legislation is intended to
ensure that no one else must en
dure what Sandra Jensen went
through," Villaraigosa said.
Jensen suffered from congenital
heart problems and pulmonary hy
pertension. Down syndrome is a
genetic, chromosomal disorder.
