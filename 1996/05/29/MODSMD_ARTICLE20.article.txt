# Flicks paper throwing can become dangerous
## 
### 
Sometimes fun stops being fun when
taken to an extreme. That's how I felt at
the 10 p.m. Flicks this past Memorial Day.
Usually, I am amused by the paper throw
ing that seems to prevail at the 10 p.m.
showings; sometimes, I even catch myself
participating by hurling a few of my own
crumpled paper balls.
But the fun came to an abrupt halt this
Monday when one of my moviemates got
struck squarely in the face by a fast-mov
ing projectile. She was reading and did not
even see it coming. The projectile was
made from rolled-up newspaper with a
knot tied on one end, presumably designed
to be thrown long distances with high
momentum. Though she would survive the
incident, she was obviously hurt. Our
group was silenced; there was nothing to
say, no specific person to blame.
Three minutes later, another nearby

person got his glasses dislodged by a simi
larly made projectile; a lens popped out and
fell onto the floor. Like my friend, he was
minding his own business. Yet another
projectile was forcefully whipped from the
balcony straight to the seats below, clob
bering the back of some unsuspecting per
son's head. There were undoubtedly many
other incidents similar to these.
I am privileged to be a student at Stan
ford, where we are granted an unusual
degree of freedom which is simply not
available at most other institutions. I cer
tainly would not want to be part of a police
state where every small behavior is regu
lated by law. However, when exercising
this freedom, we have a responsibility to
consider the rights and the needs of others.
The flagrant abuse of these liberties by
a few individuals threatens the fun for the
majority of us. In particular, the hurling of
missile-type projed-iles at Flicks is clearly
insensitive and irresponsible, not to men
tion dangerous. If you are one of those
individuals, grow up from this behavior.
And if you see someone else hurling some
thing dangerous, don't just watch passive
ly: tell that person to grow up as well.
