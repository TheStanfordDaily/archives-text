# Colleen Krueger: Left of center
## Virtues of the father visited upon the daughter 
### 
C THAVE TO write my last column
I tonight, or tomorrow, I guess...." I
-Lgroaned to my parents on the way to
the Seattle-Tacoma airport Monday night.
"I wanted to make this one sort of momen
tous, since this is the last one and all. It
seems like a weird one to go off about the
Religious Right or something."
"You think that's bad," my father said
facetiously. "I have to write a graduation
speech before Wednesday." Out of the
blue, someone called him in April from the
tiny town in Idaho (population about 900)
where he grew up, asking him to deliver
the high school commencement speech. As
far as we can tell, the only thing that
makes him qualified to give the speech is
that he left town 35 years ago.
"You could help me, Colleen. Can you
think of a popular song with a message?"
he asked.
"Oh no," my mom shrieked, "you can't
do that!"
"No, Dad,' I agreed. "That's going to
sound so corny. 'As Kurt Cobain put
it. . . ' "
"I was thinking Nine Inch Nails, " he
said in the tone I used to call his "joke
voice" as a little girl. He still uses it all the
time, to convince my cousin Melisa he's
going to eat all of her candy as the two of
them return home from a soggy night of
Northwest trick-or-treating, or to per

suade me that he's voting for Boh Dole.
The next time we'll all be together will
be at my graduation, on Father's Day.
"We'll have to share the day,"he said to
me. "I have a feeling you're going to steal
my thunder this year."
I wonder if he knows how honored I am
to share the occasion with him, how appro
priate it is that we are celebrating together
that day. I wonder if can tell what a pro
found impact he's had on my college years,
and how happy I am that we have become
such good friends.
My Stanford application essay was
about my father, about his intense com
mitment to social justice. His father, a Lat
vian immigrant and a Holocaust survivor
who I never knew, wrote these words to
him from the Holy Land in 1968:
"To my beloved son, Jamie: May you
live the Lord's commandments, always
help and protect the poor and the persecut
ed, never compromise with evil regardless
of what it might cost you in worldly goods,
and the Lord will love and protect you and
you will always be happy. Dad."
It is easy to lose sight of this message at
Stanford, in an environment where one's
primary reason for living aui seem to be
professional and financial success. Many
times, my grandfather's words — exempli
fied in my own father's life — have had to
counter-balance the dominant culture

here, with its expectations of material
glory and intellectual fame. It is always a
struggle for me. But my father's expecta
tions for me, indeed my family's expecta
tions, are very different. And they are more
difficult. To find the lost, to heal the bro
ken, to feed the hungry, to calm the child,
to release the prisoner.
I remember coming home from Stan
ford after freshman year, wearing my self
conscious political correctness like suit of
mail. I was a crusader, all right. Giving my
mother pointed glares when she referred to
the "girls" in her office. Constantly substi
tuting "African-American" for "black,"
"Chicano / Latino" for "Hispanic," "Native
American" for "Indian." Practically driv
ing off the road when an innocent, nine
year-old Melisa referred to an Indian man
as a "swami."
"Colleen, I think the Indian Bingo par
lor has the right to choose its own name,"
my father would tease me. "Shall we go tell
the Vietnamese place with the sign in the
window that says 'Oriental Cuisine' that
we're offended?" I would make self-righ
teous speeches about how his flippant
remarks about gay men could be misinter
preted. "Would you say that if a gay man
was right here?"
Sometime later, I learned that —
unknown to everyone but my mother —
my father spent that summer caring for a

gay friend and colleague who was dying of
AIDS. Almost every morning, my mother
told me, he would visit the hospice before
or after work. "He is all alone," he said to
her when she finally pried it out of him.
"He needs me." Thus, without the least bit
of discrimination or judgment, my compas
sionate father spent three months helping
a dying man face his final days, while his
19-year-old daughter spent three months
lecturing him on sensitivity.
My father coaxed me through my home
sickness freshman year and my excruciat
ingly long term as managing editor of The
Daily junior year. "Only five more weeks,"
he would say, always keeping a running
count. Books of coupons for the Starbucks
coffee I couldn't afford for myself would
come in unassuming, brown-paper
envelopes. "Study hard," the yellow post-it
note would say. "Only three weeks till you
come home. Love, Big Guy."
He tolerates being in a family with four
women amazingly well. I watched him at
dinner last weekend, laughing at the sto
ries Melisa told about who's "going out":
the power elite of the seventh grade. He
can't possibly think that the politics of
junior high girls are as funny as the rest of
us do, but — if he feels left out — he never
lets on. He never gets jealous of the
intense, exclusive relationship between my
mother and I. After dinner, he went out for

ice cream for"the girls." Jamoca-Almond
Fudge for my mom and my aunt. Choco
late-Chip Mint for me. Cookie Dough for
Melisa. He eats whatever we don't.
After dinner, my Dad and I watched
Seinfeld together, laughing at his favorite
character, Kramer, all hyped up on cafe
lattes. He gave me a book about the histo
ry of the Puget Sound to read this summer:
"It means so much to understand the his
tory of where you are now," he said. I
agreed.
The drive to the airport inevitably came
to an end, and we found our way to Gate D
-8 with, as usual, seconds to spare. "I guess
I have to go," I said, as the flight attendant
called my row number.
It was then that the words came tum
bling out. "I don't want to graduate, you
know," I said, half-frantically. "I had a
dream about it last night, that we had all
graduated, and I was so sad...
My dad smiled at me, amused. (He could
never wait to leave school.) A smile that
said it will be OK, that the most important
things in life won't change.
"See you on Graduation Day,"he said
firmly and reassuringly.
"See you on Father's Day," I said, smil
ing back.

the "girls" in her office. Constantly substi
tuting "African-American" for "black,"
"Chicano / Latino" for "Hispanic," "Native
American" for "Indian." Practically driv
ing off the road when an innocent, nine
year-old Melisa referred to an Indian man
as a "swami."
"Colleen, I think the Indian Bingo par
lor has the right to choose its own name,"
my father would tease me. "Shall we go tell
the Vietnamese place with the sign in the
window that says 'Oriental Cuisine' that
we're offended?" I would make self-righ
teous speeches about how his flippant
remarks about gay men could be misinter
preted. "Would you say that if a gay man
was right here?"
Sometime later, I learned that —
unknown to everyone but my mother —
my father spent that summer caring for a

gay friend and colleague who was dying of
AIDS. Almost every morning, my mother
told me, he would visit the hospice before
or after work. "He is all alone," he said to
her when she finally pried it out of him.
"He needs me." Thus, without the least bit
of discrimination or judgment, my compas
sionate father spent three months helping
a dying man face his final days, while his
19-year-old daughter spent three months
lecturing him on sensitivity.
My father coaxed me through my home
sickness freshman year and my excruciat
ingly long term as managing editor of The
Daily junior year. "Only five more weeks,"
he would say, always keeping a running
count. Books of coupons for the Starbucks
coffee I couldn't afford for myself would
come in unassuming, brown-paper
envelopes. "Study hard," the yellow post-it
note would say. "Only three weeks till you
come home. Love, Big Guy."
He tolerates being in a family with four
women amazingly well. I watched him at
dinner last weekend, laughing at the sto
ries Melisa told about who's "going out":
the power elite of the seventh grade. He
can't possibly think that the politics of
junior high girls are as funny as the rest of
us do, but — if he feels left out — he never
lets on. He never gets jealous of the
intense, exclusive relationship between my
mother and I. After dinner, he went out for

ice cream for"the girls." Jamoca-Almond
Fudge for my mom and my aunt. Choco
late-Chip Mint for me. Cookie Dough for
Melisa. He eats whatever we don't.
After dinner, my Dad and I watched
Seinfeld together, laughing at his favorite
character, Kramer, all hyped up on cafe
lattes. He gave me a book about the histo
ry of the Puget Sound to read this summer:
"It means so much to understand the his
tory of where you are now," he said. I
agreed.
The drive to the airport inevitably came
to an end, and we found our way to Gate D
-8 with, as usual, seconds to spare. "I guess
I have to go," I said, as the flight attendant
called my row number.
It was then that the words came tum
bling out. "I don't want to graduate, you
know," I said, half-frantically. "I had a
dream about it last night, that we had all
graduated, and I was so sad...
My dad smiled at me, amused. (He could
never wait to leave school.) A smile that
said it will be OK, that the most important
things in life won't change.
"See you on Graduation Day,"he said
firmly and reassuringly.
"See you on Father's Day," I said, smil
ing back.
