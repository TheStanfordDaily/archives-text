## Men's golf heads to NCAAs 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
After nine months and 14 tour
naments, the slate has been wiped
clean for the Stanford men's golf
team.
The No. 15 Cardinal 's one-tour
nament season begins today with its
pursuit of the national title at the

NCAA Championship in Chat
tanooga, Tenn.
"In college golf, this is the only
tournament that counts," said se
nior David Garcia. "The regionals
were pretty much just qualifiers for
this."
Stanford's path into the champi
onship was paved by its victory in
the NCAA West Regional last week.

Widely perceived as only the sixth
best team in the region, the squad
left the experts with egg on their
faces, holding off late charges by
both No. 2 Arizona State and No. 3
Nevada-Las Vegas to win the re
gional title for the first time in
school history.
"Last week's win was a huge con
fidence booster," Garcia said. "A lot
of people sold us short, so it really
helped our team pride."
While doubters are now few and
far between, the team is still far
from the favorite. The 27-school
field features the top eight teams
from the East region, the top 10
from the Central, and the top nine
from the West.
Topping everybody's bad list is
defending national champion Okla
homa State. The top-ranked Cow
boys, who edged the Cardinal by one
stroke for last year's title, bring an
obscene amount of talent to the
table, sporting six of the best seven
golfers in their region. Among the
other top teams, the Sun Devils and
the Runnin' Rebels are chomping at
the bit to redeem themselves after
last week's defeat on the Farm. Out
of the East, No. 4 Florida remains
the team to beat.
"I feel that we have the ability to
play with anyone in the nation,"
said head coach Wally Goodwin.
"Some teams may have a bit more
talent, but I really think this thing's
up for grabs between several
teams."
Headlining the Stanford attack
will be the usual trio of Tiger Woods,
Jerry Chang and Joel Kribel. Woods
will be the man to beat individually
as the consensus top collegian. The
sophomore All-American is coming
off an impressive pair of back-to
back victories in the Pac-10 and Re
gional Championships, with only
the national title now missing from
his trophy case.
Chang, the senior captain, enters
with momentum as well, having fin
ished the regionals with a superb
final round to help boost the squad
to the team title. Kribel, already one
of the nation's top players as a fresh
man, will look to remedy an off-per
formance last week.
"I would put our top three up
against anybody's," Goodwin said.
At the four and five spots, Garcia
and junior Conrad Ray round out
the starting squad after a season
long dogfight among the second
teamers. Garcia solidified his posi
tion with a promising showing last
week, while Ray edged out sopho
more Eri Crum in a team qualifier
for the final spot.
"I've said it till season, but we re
ally have to have good production
out of these two places," Goodwin
said. "We're only as good as our
highest scorer."
As important as the talent in
volved, the difficulty of the course
should be a key factor in deciding
who will be crowned at week's end.
The site, which is the home course
of Tennessee-Chattanooga, will be
the toughest of the year for most of
the field. Exceptionally long with ex
tremely tight greens, the course will
be unforgiving, turning the slight
