# Frosh phenom Kribel looks to cap off banner rookie year

A lone figure strides purposefully down the
dim hallway, a set of golf clubs slung casually
across his shoulder. Gradually, Joel Kribel
emerges from the darkness and apologizes for
his absence.
He enters his room, wading through the
clutter of dirty socks, old pizza boxes and crum
pled lecture handouts before collapsing onto a
worn couch beneath a poem dedicated to a
failed chemistry exam.
Chemistry, however, is not a top priority for
Kribel at the moment. As the No. 2 player on
the Stanford men's golf team, Kribel, a fresh
man from Pleasanton, Calif., is considered by
many to be the best freshman golfer in the na
tion.
In 1994, Kribel was selected by the Ameri
can Junior Golf Association as the National
Rolex Player of the Year, a highly selective and
coveted golf honor.
"It's basically out of the whole country,"
Kribel said. "That was a pretty big award for
me to win."
Yet winning has not always come easily for
Kribel. He remembers with a smirk the diffi
culties he experienced when he first arrived at
Stanford.
"It wasn't exactly what I expected when I got
here," Kribel said. "There was a lot more
schoolwork than I anticipated, and in turn I
didn't really get to practice golf as much as I
normally had. My game was kind of struggling
a little bit, so I had some bad tournaments and
I got really frustrated.
"In high school I could get away with doing
minimal work and still get good grades," Kribel
said. "I did spend a lot of time in high school
practicing golf and playing golf, but here
there's a lot more time-balancing going on be
tween school and golf."
Stanford men's golf coach Wally Goodwin
first noticed Kribel during his junior year in
high school at Amador Valley High.
"He's a blue-collar, hard working, never
give-up fighter," Goodwin said. "He is deter
mined to not be beaten. He really controls his
destiny."
Determination and control are perhaps two
