# Frosh phenom Kribel looks to cap off banner rookie year

A lone figure strides purposefully down the
dim hallway, a set of golf clubs slung casually
across his shoulder. Gradually, Joel Kribel
emerges from the darkness and apologizes for
his absence.
He enters his room, wading through the
clutter of dirty socks, old pizza boxes and crum
pled lecture handouts before collapsing onto a
worn couch beneath a poem dedicated to a
failed chemistry exam.
Chemistry, however, is not a top priority for
Kribel at the moment. As the No. 2 player on
the Stanford men's golf team, Kribel, a fresh
man from Pleasanton, Calif., is considered by
many to be the best freshman golfer in the na
tion.
In 1994, Kribel was selected by the Ameri
can Junior Golf Association as the National
Rolex Player of the Year, a highly selective and
coveted golf honor.
"It's basically out of the whole country,"
Kribel said. "That was a pretty big award for
me to win."
Yet winning has not always come easily for
Kribel. He remembers with a smirk the diffi
culties he experienced when he first arrived at
Stanford.
"It wasn't exactly what I expected when I got
here," Kribel said. "There was a lot more
schoolwork than I anticipated, and in turn I
didn't really get to practice golf as much as I
normally had. My game was kind of struggling
a little bit, so I had some bad tournaments and
I got really frustrated.
"In high school I could get away with doing
minimal work and still get good grades," Kribel
said. "I did spend a lot of time in high school
practicing golf and playing golf, but here
there's a lot more time-balancing going on be
tween school and golf."
Stanford men's golf coach Wally Goodwin
first noticed Kribel during his junior year in
high school at Amador Valley High.
"He's a blue-collar, hard working, never
give-up fighter," Goodwin said. "He is deter
mined to not be beaten. He really controls his
destiny."
Determination and control are perhaps two

of Kribel's best assets.
"A lot of people just think
going out there and playing in a
regular tournament is a lot of
pressure, but I don't really feel a
whole lot of that," Kribel said.
"Most of the pressure that I re
ceive is from myself, and I think
what keeps me going and striving
to get better is me putting pres
sure on myself and wanting to get
better and better and to succeed."
Success in golf became impor
tant to Kribel long before high
school, though. He first picked up
a club at the age of six at his
hometown golf course.
"There was a public course
about 10 minutes from my
house," Kribel said. "I started out
there and I got into their junior
program. Once I met one of the
pros, I stuck with him for a while.
I still go to him today, as a matter
of fact."
Kribel credits his father, how

ever, with actually serving as his
first instructor.
"He knew a lot of the basics and
he's who got me started pretty
much with every sport," Kribel
said. "My dad taught me a lot of
things and got me interested in
I go If I."
Both Kribel's father, a fire
fighter, and his mother, a postal
clerk, have been very influential
in his life. In addition to provid
ing financial support, they often
travel with him to tournaments.
"They've been the biggest fac
tors in my life," Kribel said. "Any
thing I need, they've been there
for me. They're always providing
and providing and providing and
not asking for anything back. I
owe a lot of what I have to them."
Kribel hopes to continue play
ing tournaments at the profes
sional level when he graduates
from Stanford.
"There's nothing else I want to
do," Kribel said. "It's like a dream
to get paid to play golf."
In Kribel's case, these dreams
will almost certainly become re
alities.
