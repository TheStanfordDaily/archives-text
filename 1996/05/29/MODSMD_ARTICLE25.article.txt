# Last shot for Cardinal track stars
## Nine Stanford athletes will head to NCAAs to make final title run 
### Sam Wang Staff writer 
In a sport that one-tenth of a sec
ond or a half-inch can decide one's
fate, only nine Stanford track and
field athletes remain alive in the
outdoor track season.
The group of nine will travel
north to participate in the NCAA
Outdoor Track and Field Champi
onships this week at Hayward Field
in Eugene, Ore.
For their teammates, this sea
son ended 10 days ago with the con
clusion of the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships at UCLA, where
the men took sixth place and the
women came in fifth.
Three runners, senior Dena Dey,
sophomore Sarna Renfro and
freshman Mary Cobb all had run
NCAA automatic qualification

times during the season and were
assured a spot in the national
championships.
However, there remained 13
Cardinal athletes who posted
NCAA provisional marks, meaning
their fates remained in the balance
as the NCAA filled unoccupied
spots with the best marks from the
provisional qualifiers after all auto
matic invitations were extended.
Out of this group, six made the
cut.
Junior Monal Chokshi will run
the 3,000, junior Greg Jimmerson
will compete in the 10,000 and ju
nior Jason Lunn will race in the
1,500. Junior Justin Strand and
sophomore Adam Connolly will
participate in the hammer throw,
and senior Sue Demars will toss the
discus.
Along with Jimmerson, Chokshi

and Lunn, the presence of Cobb,
Dey and Renfro ensure Cardinal
representation in the middle dis
tance and distance events as they
will run the 3,000, 1,500 and the
5,000, respectively.
Many of the NCAA athletes are
coming off strong performances in
recent weeks.
Dey came in second in the 1,500
in the Pac-lOs and ran an astonish
ing 4:16.30 the week before in the
Cardinal Invitational. At that time,
Dey's mark was the second-best col
legiate time of the year.
Both Jimmerson and Renfro
had placed in the top three at the
Pac-lOs in their events, while De
mars achieved a personal record in
the discus.
