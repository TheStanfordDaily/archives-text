# Sports editing and tequila shots — a retrospective
## 
### 
There were nights when I thought I'd
never see this day. After four
months, more 1 a.m. nights than I'd
care to remember and enough Chinese
take-out to last me a lifetime, I've finally
come upon that unmistakable portent that
the end is near: the farewell column.
That's right, there's only three issues of
The Daily left in this volume, which means
it's time to bid you farewell and reflect back
on the good times and bad times of my
tenure as sports editor.
When I was offered this job back in Jan
uary, I accepted the post with a mixed sense
of excitement and fear. As a freshman, I was
somewhat hesitant about shouldering edi
torial duties after just four months of expe
rience on the paper. Would I be able to han
dle the commitment that came with editing
a daily newspaper? Would I be able to keep
up my grades? Could I come up with fresh
and provocative material for my column
week in and week out? Would I be able to
avoid the careless mistakes that had always
seemed to plague the sports page in the
past?
Unfortunately, the answer was no — to
all of the above. That's not to say that I
shirked my duties as sports editor — for the
most part, I think I met the commitment of
the job and then some. But the bright-eyed
optimism and enthusiasm that helped pro
pel me through those First two hectic
months soon wore thin. You can only work
so many nine-hour nights before you start
to lose your sanity.
Those first few weeks, I'd be in the office
by 4 or 4:30 at the latest. By the middle of
spring quarter, 4:30 had turned into 5:15,
5:30,5:45. Stories were sent through after a
quick once-over. Game articles were pushed

ahead a day so we'd have enough stories to
fill our page. Less effort was made to identi
fy hard-to-make-out athletes in file photos.
Not that any of this took place without
affecting my classes. Quite to the contrary
— my GPA took a half-point nose-dive dur
ing winter quarter. And as for fresh and
provocative column material . . . well,
you've seen some of my columns. And care
less mistakes? Let's just say I've had my
share.
Of course, we did do some things right.

Kyle Utsumi and Sasha Mitelman did a fan
tastic job of providing daily coverage of the
U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials from Indi
anapolis. Same goes for our tennis writers
who traveled to Georgia and Florida State
for last week's NCAA championships.
But as with any student-run operation,
things haven't always been perfect. At a
school with 33 varsity sports, it's often hard
to find enough talented and dedicated writ
ers to provide adequate coverage of every
team. As a result, sports like sailing, syn
chronized swimming, crew and women's
golf suffered.
Of course, there was certainly no shortage

of materia] during those first two
months of February and March,
when basketball, baseball, tennis,
swimming, gymnastics, wrestling,
men's volleyball, track, golf, soft
ball, lacrosse and women's water
polo (did I miss any?) were all in full
swing. There were some Mondays
when we probably could have fdled
three or four full pages with our
weekend coverage. By the end of
April, though, the schedule was so
t bin, there were days we didn't have
a single game story to report on.
And, of course, there was the in
famous night of Wednesday, Feb.
28, when I found myself left with
no stories after 1) the baseball
game was rained out, 2) the soft ball
game was rained out, and 3) my
Wednesday columnist (and co-edi
tor) bailed out to work on the
breaking Eric Abrams story. Only a
Greg Collins feature column, a life
sized box of Pac-10 basketball
standings and an impromptu
lacrosse article kept us from scrap
ping the sports page altogether.
But I've yet to touch upon the
most exciting, most visible and
sometimes the most stressful part
of my job — coming up with a week
ly column. To be honest, I probably
don't have the maturity, the per
spective, the writing savvy, the

pointed opinions or even the far
reaching knowledge of sports that
it takes to make a good sports
columnist. But I gave it a shot.
And after all was said and done,
having my mug shot smudged
across this page every week really
didn't bringas much recognition as
I expected. I did learn something
about the demographics of our
readership during Rush, though,
when just about every other guy I
met seemed to recognize me from
the paper. By comparison, I've had
my face recognized by random girls
all of, like, twice. (Speaking of
Rush, I might mention that per
haps my most interesting column
writing experience took place on
Bid Night — after five tequila shots
on an empty stomach. Oh, that was
a good one.)
And while we're on the topic of
demographics, I shouldn't forget
another valuable lesson I learned
after writing a column that allied
for a ban on boxing. While the most
common response from guys
(starting with Robert and Duran in
Type & Design) was to unequivo
cally challenge my masculinity,
every girl I talked to told me how
much they loved the column. l ake
note, future columnists — I may
have hit on something there.
Well, that's it, in a nutshell.
Good times, bad times, they're all
there. Now if you'll excuse me —
I've got a social life and a GPA to re
suscitate. See ya next year.
