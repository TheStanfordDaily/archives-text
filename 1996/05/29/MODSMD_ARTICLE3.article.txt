# CIV professors object to shortening program
## Faculty already concerned though plans not yet final 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
Although the commission examining
Cultures, Ideas and Values has a year left to
consider possible changes to the program,
some CIV faculty members fear one of the
proposals the commission is considering
could destroy the program.
Specifically, the commission is consider
ing, among other proposals, reducing CIV
from three to two quarters. The free third
quarter would most likely be taken over by
the new freshman seminars.
If CIV is reduced to two quarters, the
salaries of the postdoctoral instructors who
teach sections would be cut by one-third.
According to Judith Cain, assistant dean of
the School of Humanities and Sciences, the
instructors earn an annual salary of

around $35,000.
"Absolutely none of them would stay
with the program if they were cut to two
thirds salary," said Linda Paulson, coordi
nator for the Literature and the Arts track.
"It's not a living wage."
Lecturers and postdoctoral fellows are
hired for a period of two to three years, dur
ing which they usually teach all three quar
ters and remain with the same group of stu
dents.
"It's not possible to say that CIV
wouldn't or couldn't survive [as a two-quar
ter course], but it would not survive as the
high-quality course it currently is, particu
larly if the teaching staff is changed so that
it doesn't involve postdoc lecturers, which is
one of the very strong points of this course,"
said History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee, who chairs the History
CIV track.
"If that were to be tampered
with . . . CIV as we have known it
for the past 60 years would be
dead," she added.
Lougee said CIV is important
because it gives students a "cultur
al literacy," without which they
wouldn't know"the things that
everyone thinks everybody
knows."
Stanford's first Western civi
lizations course started in 1935 in
the History Department and last
ed until the late 19605. The West
ern Culture requirement was in
stituted in 1980 and differed from
the previous course because it was
designed as a group of related
tracks with different emphases
rather than a single class.
In 1989, the University adopted
the current CIV after months of
heated debate concerning what the
program's curriculum should in
clude.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, di
rector of the CIV program, said it
would be impossible to fill the sec
tion leader positions with graduate
students.
"We don't have nearly enough,"
Seaver said. He also pointed out
that it would be "monstrously ex
pensive" and "fundamentally un
economic" to hire faculty to lead
sections.
"Logistically, it just isn't possi
ble, particularly if we want faculty
to teach [freshman] seminars as
well," he said.
The commission, which is

chaired by English Prof. Robert
Polhemus, will not present its rec
ommendations to the Faculty Sen
ate until next spring. However, ac
cording to Lougee, there is a belief
among faculty that the two-quar
ter plan is being seriously consid
ered and that the impetus for its
implementation would be finan
cial.

As far as I can see,
there has been a great
deal of secrecy in the
plans. This is very differ
ent from the way plan
ning has taken place at
Stanford in the past.'

"As far as I can see, there has
been a great deal of secrecy in the
plans," Lougee said. "This is very
different from the way planning
has taken place at Stanford in the
past. [The CIV community) has
not been let in on the secret by the
Polhemus commission or the Pres
ident's Office. It has not been
talked to or had its opinion asked."
Provost Condoleezza Rice, who
is an ex officio member of the com
mission, said it is too early to spec
ulate on whether CIV will be short
ened, and faculty who feel the need
to express their concerns should
address them directly to the com
mission.
"I'm certain that anything that
anyone has to say, Polhemus
would be happy to listen to and get
their view and even let them speak

to the commission," Rice said. "I
think that people should avoid
drawing conclusions about a com
mission that has a year to go."
Both Seaver and Lougee
warned against doing away with
CIV.
"One of the problems that the
program has always had is trying
to do too much in a three-quarter,
five-unit course," Seaver said.
"There's always been a temptation
either to drop most of the histori
cal depth or to try to pack so much
in that the freshmen complain, le
gitimately.
"Then saying we'll improve the
course [by reducing it to two quar
ters] is to say we're giving up on
trying to give freshmen an intellec
tual map of culture in the ancient
world to the present," he said.
Lougee said abandoning CIV
would mean eliminating structure
in the freshman year and, conse
quently, in the entire undergradu
ate experience.
"CIV accomplishes a lot of
things people don't realize it ac
complishes," Lougee said. "It
teaches [students! to write, to
read, to listen critically to lectures,
to read critically. Everyone who
has these students afterwards
benefits."
Seaver said when CIV in its pre
sent form was established, it re
ceived significant criticism in the
press and from alumni for being
too liberal and for purportedly
abandoning "standard texts." But
what CIV did, Seaver said, was say
that "women and minorities are
part of our culture.
"To cut that out is to tell stu
dents it's not important. And I
don't think that's what higher ed
ucation should be doing at the end
of the 20th century."
