# CIV professors object to shortening program
## Faculty already concerned though plans not yet final

Although the commission examining
Cultures, Ideas and Values has a year left to
consider possible changes to the program,
some CIV faculty members fear one of the
proposals the commission is considering
could destroy the program.
Specifically, the commission is consider
ing, among other proposals, reducing CIV
from three to two quarters. The free third
quarter would most likely be taken over by
the new freshman seminars.
If CIV is reduced to two quarters, the
salaries of the postdoctoral instructors who
teach sections would be cut by one-third.
According to Judith Cain, assistant dean of
the School of Humanities and Sciences, the
instructors earn an annual salary of

around $35,000.
"Absolutely none of them would stay
with the program if they were cut to two
thirds salary," said Linda Paulson, coordi
nator for the Literature and the Arts track.
"It's not a living wage."
Lecturers and postdoctoral fellows are
hired for a period of two to three years, dur
ing which they usually teach all three quar
ters and remain with the same group of stu
dents.
"It's not possible to say that CIV
wouldn't or couldn't survive [as a two-quar
ter course], but it would not survive as the
high-quality course it currently is, particu
larly if the teaching staff is changed so that
it doesn't involve postdoc lecturers, which is
one of the very strong points of this course,"
