# Stanford second highest in donations nationally

Receiving more than $240.8 million in gifts,
Stanford ranked second among colleges and
universities in overall donations last year, ac
cording to comparative statistics released last
week.
Harvard University came in first with
$323.4 million, while Yale University placed
third, the Council for Aid to Education report
ed. Donations to the University during the
1995 fiscal year totaled $240,832,287 in all.
"Last year was the biggest we have ever
had," said David Glen, director of principal
gifts for the Office of Development, regarding
the donations raised by the University. A 1994
survey by the Chronicle of Philanthropy
ranked Stanford 20th in overall donations re
ceived.
Though the council reported that gifts to
American colleges increased at the slowest
rate in eightyears during 1995, the University
has enjoyed a great year.
"We have generally been in the top three.
Three or four years ago we were No. 1. It
varies. Harvard had a spectacular year be
cause they are on a fund-raising campaign,"

Glen said.
The sources of these funds are many and
varied; however, the bulk of the contributions
consists of personal donations and gifts left in
wills.
"The corporate donations have fallen off in
recent years," Glen said.
Nevertheless, one area in which the Uni
versity has not scored a total success is alum
ni donations. Last September U.S. News &
World Report ranked the University 33rd in
alumni satisfaction, with a 28 percent alumni
giving rate.
"A significant amount of gifts come from
non-alumni," Glen said. "We are a newer,
younger institution than, say, a Princeton or a
Yale. Stanford has only been fund raising for
about 60 years. We don't have the alumni giv
ing tradition."
Glen also blamed poor fund-raising strate
gies for the lack of alumni support. "We have
also been fragmented in soliciting our alumni.
We haven't focused on the t'und," he said, re
ferring to the Stanford Fund which solicits an
nual gifts from undergraduate alumni.
The low alumni giving rate has bothered
many high-ranking administration
officials. "One of [University! Pres
ident (Gerhard) Casper's priorities
has been to improve this number,"
said Brian Perronne, director of
young alumni and student develop
ment for the Stanford Fund. "The
president was concerned when he
first saw the figure, thinking it was
a low one for such an elite institu
tion."
Glen said he feels the fund is in
tegral to a successful fund-raising
attempt, especially if alumni partic
ipation is to improve. "We are de
voting more resources to the Stan
ford Fund in an attempt to get high
er participation rates so that dollar
amounts will go up," he said.
Perronne also attributed the
problem to perception. "Some
alums feel that Stanford is wealthy.
Now, in the last few years the par
ticipation rate has gone up because
we have done a better job at articu
lating the need."
Glen agreed but warned that the
problem goes beyond perceptions of
the University's wealth. "Stanford

has not done a good job indoctrinat
ing students. At Yale, you would
hear the first day about your duty
to the school as a student and a fu
ture alumnus," he said.
"We need to cultivate relation
ships," he said, noting the need to
involve the alumni. "You have to
give your first dollar before you give
your first million dollars. We need
to start educating our alumni and
tell them over and over again how
important they are â€” and not just
because of money, but because of
their overall impact to the school.
"Stanford tries to engage alumni
in the process. If they are involved
and engaged they are more likely to
invest their time and money. We
are trying to bring people closer to
the institution," he continued.
However, Glen explained that
the University does not use many of
the strategic practices employed by
other colleges.
The Los Angeles Times recently
reported that UCLA, one of the most
successful public institutions in the
arena of private fund raising, gathers
information to determine prospec
tive donors, including who just made
a huge stock deal to who is wearing
expensive designer clothing.
"We have a research function,"

Glen explained, "but they spend
their time reading The Wall Street
Journal finding out whose company
went public. We use publicly avail
able information. As far as who's
wearing Armani suits," he contin
ued, "that suit might have cost them
their last dime. That isn't an effec
tive technique for fund raising."
The Times also reported that
UCLA offered personal tutoring by
the dean of one of its schools to the
son of a major donor. Brain re
searchers gave private seminars to
billionaire David Howard Murdock,
and Disney executive Michael
Ovitz's wife gets her book club mod
erated by an English professor, the
Times said.
"I am not aware of any cases
where we've sent professors out to
book clubs. We send professors out
to talk to alumni groups who are in
terested in certain topics. For in
stance, we send Business School or
economics professors to talk to
groups who may be interested in
tax reform," Glen said. "We know
who attends events, but we don't
use those lists specifically for fund
raising. There isn't that big a re
turn on it."
Glen said, "These types of things
are just not done at Stanford."
