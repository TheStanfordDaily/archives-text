Receiving more than $240.8 million in gifts,
Stanford ranked second among colleges and
universities in overall donations last year, ac
cording to comparative statistics released last
week.
Harvard University came in first with
$323.4 million, while Yale University placed
third, the Council for Aid to Education report
ed. Donations to the University during the
1995 fiscal year totaled $240,832,287 in all.
"Last year was the biggest we have ever
had," said David Glen, director of principal
gifts for the Office of Development, regarding
the donations raised by the University. A 1994
survey by the Chronicle of Philanthropy
ranked Stanford 20th in overall donations re
ceived.
Though the council reported that gifts to
American colleges increased at the slowest
rate in eightyears during 1995, the University
has enjoyed a great year.
"We have generally been in the top three.
Three or four years ago we were No. 1. It
varies. Harvard had a spectacular year be
cause they are on a fund-raising campaign,"

Glen said.
The sources of these funds are many and
varied; however, the bulk of the contributions
consists of personal donations and gifts left in
wills.
"The corporate donations have fallen off in
recent years," Glen said.
Nevertheless, one area in which the Uni
versity has not scored a total success is alum
ni donations. Last September U.S. News &
World Report ranked the University 33rd in
alumni satisfaction, with a 28 percent alumni
giving rate.
"A significant amount of gifts come from
non-alumni," Glen said. "We are a newer,
younger institution than, say, a Princeton or a
Yale. Stanford has only been fund raising for
about 60 years. We don't have the alumni giv
ing tradition."
Glen also blamed poor fund-raising strate
gies for the lack of alumni support. "We have
also been fragmented in soliciting our alumni.
We haven't focused on the t'und," he said, re
ferring to the Stanford Fund which solicits an
nual gifts from undergraduate alumni.
The low alumni giving rate has bothered
