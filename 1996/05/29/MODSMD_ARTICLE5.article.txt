# Rally held to address human rights abuses

### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
Speakers from Stanford and
Bay Area organizations urged stu
dents to take responsibility for the
treatment of fellow humans at a
human rights awareness forum
yesterday afternoon in White
Plasa.
The forum, which lasted more
than an hour, featured speakers
from Friends of Tibet, the Stan
ford Park Hotel and the Human
Rights Defense Committee of San
Jose.
Gary Wood, a member of the
committee, welcomed listeners,
saying that the purpose of the
forum was to create a sense of "col
lective responsibility and campus

awareness." Wood said the forum
would address the "first human
right" — the right to life.
Speaker Socorro Zapien — who
was fired from Lafayette Park, a
hotel in the Stanford Park Hotel
chain — spoke on the "abuses and
injustices" she saw everyday at the
hotel.
Zapien said she and fellow
workers were not allowed to take
breaks, often working for eight
hours before being allowed to eat.
She also said workers at the hotel
were unknowingly exposed to
toxic chemicals.
After she began to organize a
workers' union, Zapien said the
hotel started treating her unfairly.
"Lafayette Park started accusing
me of things I didn't do," she said.
The hotel started showing work
ers "bad," intimidating movies to
scare them, Zapien said. She said
she was finally fired for heading the
unionizing movement.
Despite this setback, Zapien has
not stopped fighting for human
rights. "Now I'm fighting even
harder for a union," she said.
Elaine Peterson, an active mem

ber of the Hotel and Restaurant
Workers' Union, exhorted students
to boycott the Stanford Park Hotel.
Peterson explained that because the
University owns the land on which
Stanford Park Hotel sits, it indirectly
supports of the abuse of workers'
rights.
Other speakers at the forum also
addressed the lack of human rights
awareness. A representative of Cop
Watch, Cornelius Hall, spoke about
a fatal police shooting during which
his son was shot in the back of the
head. He told students to "stand up"
for their rights and "refuse to be
abused."

Hall's son, Jarrole Hall, was
killed on a Bay Area Rapid Transit
train in a confrontation with a police
officer. Hall said BART and the po
lice wrongly accused his son of
charging an officer. Hall is currently
seeking redress with police review
boards.
Hall said people must work to
correct injustices. "Ifyou're not part
of a solution, you 're part of the prob
lem," Hall said.
Ventul Rinpoche, the president
of the Tibetan Association of North
ern California, also urged students
to protest abuses of human rights.
"Do not remain silent spectators.

Principles are being trampled on
with ruthless impunity," Rinpoche
said.
Rinpoche said the Chinese army
shot two monks on May 7. Also, the
Chinese government banned any
pictures of the Dalai Lama, the Ti
betan leader who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1989.
Also present at the human rights
forum were Stanford activist groups
Resistance Action Organizing Edu
cation (RAGE), Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford and
Disabled Students of Stanford.
Junior Daniel Davis, an active
member of Disabled Students of

Stanford, called for expanded cam
pus access for the disabled. "We
want people to know that equal ac
cess includes extracurricular as well
as academic activities," Davis said.
The student organization is asking
for another community room in
which it can hold activities.
Sponsored by MEChA, a Chi
cano / Latino student group, the
human rights awareness forum was
the first of its kind. Freshman Crys
tal Zermeno, a key organLzer of the
event, said MEChA began planning
the forum after the Human Rights
Defense Committee of San Jose in
quired to see if such an event could

be held at the University.
Zermeno said Stanford wanted
the forum to include groups both on
and off campus. "We wanted the or
ganizations to work together on
things; that's why we chose White
Plaza," Zermeno said.
Zermeno said she thought the
forum reached a considerable num
ber of students, although she would
have liked to have seen more stop
and listen. "I had hoped for more
students," she said.
MEChA will discuss whether the
forum would continue on an annual
or quarterly basis, Zermeno said.
"Hopefully the forum will continue."
