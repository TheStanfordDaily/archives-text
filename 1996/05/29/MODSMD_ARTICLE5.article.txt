### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
Speakers from Stanford and
Bay Area organizations urged stu
dents to take responsibility for the
treatment of fellow humans at a
human rights awareness forum
yesterday afternoon in White
Plasa.
The forum, which lasted more
than an hour, featured speakers
from Friends of Tibet, the Stan
ford Park Hotel and the Human
Rights Defense Committee of San
Jose.
Gary Wood, a member of the
committee, welcomed listeners,
saying that the purpose of the
forum was to create a sense of "col
lective responsibility and campus

awareness." Wood said the forum
would address the "first human
right" — the right to life.
Speaker Socorro Zapien — who
was fired from Lafayette Park, a
hotel in the Stanford Park Hotel
chain — spoke on the "abuses and
injustices" she saw everyday at the
hotel.
Zapien said she and fellow
workers were not allowed to take
breaks, often working for eight
hours before being allowed to eat.
She also said workers at the hotel
were unknowingly exposed to
toxic chemicals.
After she began to organize a
workers' union, Zapien said the
hotel started treating her unfairly.
