# ASSU allows KSZU access to resources in reserve fund
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
Meeting yes
terday for the
last time this
school year, the
ASSU Senate ap
proved a mea
sure allowing
KZSU access to
its reserve fund
of approximately

$21,500 in an effort to alleviate
the radio station's budgetary
problems.
KZSU lost its special fee for the
first time ever last month and
must conduct business next year
without the $94,000 it requested

from the student body. In addi
tion to liquidating its reserve, the
radio station will raise $30,000
from underwriting, broadcast fees
and gifts to meet its operating
costs.
In other business, acting on the
Constitutional Transition Com
mittee's recommendations, the
senate seated 10 ex officio mem
bers. The new ASSU Constitution
reduced the senate's size from 40
members to 30. Those individuals
elected to the last five seats in the
graduate and undergraduate dis
tricts will have the same privi
leges in committees as senators.
In addition, they can speak, but

not vote, on the senate floor.
"We are dealing with election
results that were done under one
session and election results that
were done under another ses
sion," graduate senator Alane
Murdock said.
"It's hard to, within the frame
work of one constitution, replace
that document with an entirely
new constitution and avoid inter
nal inconsistencies and tautolo
gies," graduate senator Doug Na
telson added. "I think this is the
best solution to the problem."
The senate chose to wait until
fall quarter to assign members to
committees. Senate Chair Don
Aingworth presented the senate
with his recommended committee

assignments but later rescinded
the appointments in the face of ob
jection from Murdock. Murdock
felt Aingworth's recommenda
tions left the Appropriations Com
mittee, which is entrusted with
approving all ASSU expenditures,
dangerously inexperienced.
The senate also elected under
graduate senator Joe Freund as
its deputy chair. In that post, Fre
und, a former senate associate,
will be responsible for managing
debate on the senate floor and as
sisting senators in developing
their own initiatives.
Completing its agenda, the sen
ate appointed Natelson as its repre
sentative to the Faculty Senate, cer
tified the results of last week's spe
cial general election and approved
undergraduate senator Bruce Gib
ney's request for a fall quarter leave
of absence. Gibney will attend Stan
ford-in-Oxford that quarter.
