# International students create community
## 
### Joy Moses 
The Stanford International
Undergraduate Community is
taking a world of different experi
ences and creating an opportunity
to come together and educate the
entire Stanford community.
"We want to make it clear that
we are not an ethnic organiza
tion," said co-chair Arnab Chan da,
a senior. "It is not who we are, but
what we do that is important."
Students interested in forming
the group initially began meeting
in fall 1994, following Orientation
events for international students.
Formal programming was not im
plemented until this year.
According to co-chair Bill Chiu,
"A lot of international students got
together and discovered that we
felt a general sense of a lack of a
home, a lack of an adequate repre
sentation for us on campus."
Group members said they have
been able to create a kind of home
despite their cultural differences.
"The first friends I met were inter
national students," said freshman
group member Yuri Takhteyev.
"We all felt that we had something
in common. We share a common
international experience and a de
sire to spread it to other Stanford
people."
The current leadership visual
izes the Stanford International
Undergraduate Community as
being more than a set of gatherings
solely for international students.
"We have always tried to give
out the message that we don't
want to create an enclave," said
Chanda. "We want to open up our
group to Americans who have had
extensive international experi
ence or who are just interested in
hangingoutand meeting interna

tional people."
The organization would like to
be advisers to those students who
would like to study overseas in the
various countries which they rep
resent.
Another of the group's primary
goals is to encourage the general
Stanford community to attend the
variety of international events
that already occur on campus.
Chanda cited a lack of publicity
and a sense of discomfort as possi
ble reasons for the lack of partici
pation by American students.
"We can highlight international
cultural events by being a part of
them," stated Chanda. "Unfortu
nately, international events at
Stanford tend to become very
graduate student-based."
Among the club's own interna
tional events was a party held dur
ing fall quarter. The club also put
on an International Week during
the winter that included a discus
sion with University President
Gerhard Casper, a talk about im
migration and a movie night with
Chinese, Latin American and
Caribbean films.
The group was able to make
these events possible by soliciting
various dorms for funds. However,
they hope to sponsor similar pro
grams next year with the group's
newly won ASSU special fee.
"By winning the special fee,"
said Chiu, "I think we have
proven that a definite [interna
tional undergraduate] communi
ty exists and that there is support
for this community. What we are
doing is definitely something that
is making a positive impact on
campus."
According to the co-chairs, for
every international student vote,
the group received at least seven or

eight American student votes.
The Stanford International
Undergraduate Community is
currently in the process of electing
its officers for next year.
"At first there were three or
four people doingeverything," said
Chanda, "but now many more peo
ple are involved, and we have
members from just about every
class level running for office."

Also on this year's agenda is
working on the club's World Wide
Web site and extending the mailing
lust so that it includes students who
have lived or traveled extensively
in foreign countries but who are
not considered international by
University standards.
The group has many plans for


Johnny Zannis — Daily
next year, including another inter
national week, a cooking fest, the
formation of an alumni network
and discussions of immigration is
sues and job opportunities.
