# Better Dead than Flo Mo
## Levitsky houses are all right

With names like Scarlet Fire, Touch of Grey
and Dark Hollow, most people can't help but be
intrigued bv several of the houses located on and
around Embarcadero Road. Besides being the ti
tles of Grateful Dead songs, these houses serve as
homes away from home for many Stanford stu
dents.
While the houses are a little offbeat and out of
the ordinary for off-campus living, senior Chris
Lehman, a resident of Touch of Grey, is a sup
porter of them. "I love it," said Lehman. "All my
friends were talking about it last year. We were
trying to find a place to live. We generally don't do
anything until the last minute, and this seemed
like a good thing."
The Dead Houses, as they have come to be
known, began as one house in 1984. Owner Rob
Levitsky had some extra room in the house now
known as Terrapin and rented it out to some
Stanford students looking for space away from
campus.
"I had bought that house with other friends,
and we had extra rooms and so I put up an ad on
campus," said Levitsky. After he had saved some
money, he slowly began to acquire more of the
houses, and a new lifestyle was created. Levitsky
said he found most of the houses by riding his bike
around the neighborhood and seeing what was on
the market. About the houses' names, Levitsky, a
man of few words, said only that the Grateful
Dead is "more than a band."
There are now 10 Dead Houses, and Levitsky
said he could not be happier. "I grew up here in
Palo Alto and studied at the University of Califor
nia at Davis. I enjoyed the college experience at
Davis and wanted to maintain that."
