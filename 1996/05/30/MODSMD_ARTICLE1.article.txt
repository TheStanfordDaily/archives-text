# Better Dead than Flo Mo
## Levitsky houses are all right

With names like Scarlet Fire, Touch of Grey
and Dark Hollow, most people can't help but be
intrigued bv several of the houses located on and
around Embarcadero Road. Besides being the ti
tles of Grateful Dead songs, these houses serve as
homes away from home for many Stanford stu
dents.
While the houses are a little offbeat and out of
the ordinary for off-campus living, senior Chris
Lehman, a resident of Touch of Grey, is a sup
porter of them. "I love it," said Lehman. "All my
friends were talking about it last year. We were
trying to find a place to live. We generally don't do
anything until the last minute, and this seemed
like a good thing."
The Dead Houses, as they have come to be
known, began as one house in 1984. Owner Rob
Levitsky had some extra room in the house now
known as Terrapin and rented it out to some
Stanford students looking for space away from
campus.
"I had bought that house with other friends,
and we had extra rooms and so I put up an ad on
campus," said Levitsky. After he had saved some
money, he slowly began to acquire more of the
houses, and a new lifestyle was created. Levitsky
said he found most of the houses by riding his bike
around the neighborhood and seeing what was on
the market. About the houses' names, Levitsky, a
man of few words, said only that the Grateful
Dead is "more than a band."
There are now 10 Dead Houses, and Levitsky
said he could not be happier. "I grew up here in
Palo Alto and studied at the University of Califor
nia at Davis. I enjoyed the college experience at
Davis and wanted to maintain that."

Rob Levitsky, owner of the Dead Houses on and around Embarcadero Road, began
renting rooms to students in 1984. His empire includes 10 houses, with names like
Scarlet Fire, Touch of Grey and Dark Hollow.
Food Research Institute, lives in
Scarlet Fire. Gorgue said Levitsky
has helped to create an interest
ing subcommunity. "There is
something really nice about what
Rob does," said Gorgue. "He facil
itates another campus scene.
We're connected to a good group
of people."
Levitsky said, "In a sense it's
an extended family. We do a lot of
stuff together."
This sense of community in
volves trust between the owner
and residents and among the resi
dents themselves. Abe Newman, a
graduate student in international
relations and international policy
studies and a resident of Scarlet
Fire, explained, "The house defi
nitely works on an honor system.
Rob rents almost exclusively to
Stanford students because there
is an honor most Stanford stu
dents keep."
Levitsky said he has faith that
his residents will take advantage
of their surroundings but will not

take advantage of each other.
"I'm an idealist," said Levitsky.
About the type of person who is
drawn to the Dead Houses,
Lehman said, "Before I moved in,
I thought the Dead Houses were
exceedingly progressive and liber
al. There wasn't much structure.
The people seemed kind of artistic
and into culture. There are a lot of
musicians and people into paint
ing and writing in my house.
There are also a lot of surfers.
Downstairs this guy's room is cov
ered in surf pictures."
Gorgue echoed Lehman. "The
house as a whole is a place where a
lot of different groups of people
hang out and feel comfortable,"
she said.
Levitsky had similar feelings
about his tenants. "There isn't a
certain type of person who lives
here, but it seems to be a pretty
self-selecting group."
While the possibility for fric
tion between Dead residents and
their more suburban neighbors
might seem high, Levitsky said
few problems occur. Parking and
noise definitely are issues, Levit
sky said, but the residents seem to
respect their surroundings and do

not have many hassles.
"This is a beautiful college
town, and you can't have that
without college students," Levit
sky explained. "If you want shiny
BMWs and mowed lawns with no
students, you shouldn't be here."
The students create the dis
tinct characters of each house,
said Levitsky. Levitsky himself
also works to make sure the hous
es all have a little something spe
cial. Almost all have front porches,
complete with front porch swings.
One house comes with a hot tub,
while another has a black light on
the porch which is turned on at
night for a psychedelic effect.
There is no application process
or draw necessary to move into
the houses. "It's all word of
mouth," Levitsky said. "Most of
the people who want to move in
are friends of the people who al
ready live here." Gorgue, Lehman
and Newman all said they heard
about the houses through their
friends who were living there or
who knew of Levitsky and his
houses.
As to the question of whether
there are any drawbacks to living
off campus, some residents com

mented that it can be lonely.
"It definitely is a little isolat
ing," said Lehman. "I'm sort of
more aware of life outside of cam
pus and of doing things outside of
campus."
Gorgue said she does not find
the so-called isolation a disadvan
tage. "It's what you make of it. I
don't spend any time on campus
but a lot of people come to our
house."
In general, the residents said
they wouldn't have it any other
way. Lehman said he likes th»i
spontaneity that arises from hav
ing so many people doing differ
ent things at once.
"We hang out and rarely plan
stuff," he said. "We do stuff on the
fly."
Newman said he enjoys living
in a laid-back environment with a
lot of friends. "People are very re
spectful of other people. People
look for the best in people even if
they're not like them."
Levitsky cited another advan
tage to living in one of his houses,
"The people here can always go to
campus, but the campus can't al
ways come here. It's an oasis of
your own little privacy."
