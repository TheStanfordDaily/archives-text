# Unfinished battle
## Freedman says gender bias persists 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
Calling on her scholarly re
search as well as personal experi
ence with sexism in academia,
History Prof, and Feminist Stud
ies Chair Estelle Freedman dis
cussed gender discrimination in
the University setting in a
lunchtime speech at Tresidder
Union yesterday.
"The University is a large bu
reaucratic organization that con
tinually attempts to reproduce it
self," Freedman told an audience
of about 30 people. "It often as
sumes that what has been is what
is best, ignoring the structural in
justices of the past."
Freedman explored the histori
cal context of women's entry into
universities as students, faculty
and staff. She referred to a time
when "popular scientific notion
believed that a college education
unfitted women for motherhood.
Freedman also cited observa
tions from her study of Miriam
van Waters, an educated social re
former who is the subject of
Freedman's most recent book.
Van Waters challenged gender
discrimination as a graduate stu
dent and later became a superin
tendent of a women's prison in
Framingham, Mass. Freedman
said van Waters preferred to pro
vide service outside of the academ
ic setting "rather than struggle
further in the male-dominated
university system."
Freedman recounted her own
life experiences and recalled the
time when she became aware of
gender discrimination. After
graduating from college, she spent
a year working for a Jewish orga
nization in New York City. "My
treatment as a woman, for exam
ple always asked to serve food
rather than ideas, raised my con
sciousness about sex discrimina
tion," Freedman said.
Things did not change upon
her return to academia. "Gradu
ate school soon revealed that the
discrimination I'd experienced in
the real world was replicated in
the university," she said.
Freedman said she felt very

connected to van Waters' life,
Freedman also chose to fight gen
der discrimination in theuniversir
ty system. She told of an experi
ence where she and a group of
other women graduate students
gathered stories of discriminatory
behavior and wrote them down on
3 x 5 index cards.
"We called a big meeting of the
faculty — an all-male faculty and
filled the lounge," Freedman said.
"Then we read all of these experi
ences out loud to say, 'This is what
people experience in this depart
ment, and we'd like this to
change.' "
Freedman also recalled her
struggle to earn tenure at Stan
ford in the early 1980s. Many had
argued against it, saying that her
field of study was "too narrowly
focused on women." After "10 sec
onds" of doubting herself, she re
solved to fight for her position.
"Wait a minute. There are peo
ple at this university who build
their careers on studying lizards.
More power to them!" Freedman
said. "What do you mean you
can't study women? Resist that
internalization that you are
wrong for being a female in the
university."
Freedman said every individ
ual also has a responsibility to
guard against gender bias. Freed
man summed up her own person
al strategy: "Be careful not to in
ternalize negative attitudes based
on assumptions about gender,
race or other categorical differ
ences. Even if you encounter bar
riers, take care not to police them
yourself."
Freedman said much of the
mentality prevalent in the early
1980s still exists. "To this day I en
counter remnants of the attitude
that informed the original denial
of my promotion — namely the de
valuation of women as a group and
as a subject of scholarly inquiry."
She challenged the audience to
change the status quo. "1 would like
to hear more voices of resistance on
this campus than I do. No one of us
can fight every battle," Freedman
said. "(But) the more of us [who]
make a commitment to respond,
the fewer battles get left unfought."
