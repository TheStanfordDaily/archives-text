\\ hitewater investigation picks up speed
WASHINGTON (AP) — With two grand juries at work and another court appear
ance looming for President Clinton, the Whitewater investigation is building
momentum.
While the White 1 louse was trying to minimize the fallout from the guilty verdicts
in Arkansas, prosecutor Kenneth Starr spent much of yesterday in meetings with his
Whitewater staff in Washington and Little Rock.
It all points to a long season of damage control for the White House and the re
election campaign.
For now, all three newly convicted Whitewater defendants vow they will never
cooperate.
Thomas' invitation withdrawn
LANDOVER, Md. (AP) — In a move tinged with racial politics, a predominantly
black school district in a suburb of Washington withdrew a speaking invitation to
Clarence Thomas, the only black justice on the Supreme Court.
Thomas' invitation to address a June 10 awards ceremony at the Thomas Pullen
Creative and Performing Arts School was withdrawn after a school board member
complained that Thomas' work on the court had hurt black people.
