# Israel waits for election results
## Peres, Netanyahu locked in virtual tie as final votes counted

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — As Israel
held its breath, the election battle yester
day over the country's leadership and the
course of Mideast peacemaking persisted
until the final votes could be counted.
Prime Minister Shimon Peres and
hard-line challenger Benjamin
Netanyahu were locked in a virtual tie as
results from yesterday's voting were
counted through the night.
Netanyahu was ahead with 50.2 per
cent to Peres' 49.7 percent, separated by
just 10,000 votes out of an electorate of
3.9 million, according to Israel radio and
television. Final results will not be
known until at least today when more
than 100,000 absentee ballots are count
ed.
The results were based on a count of
98 percent of the country's polling sta

tions. The other 2 percent was not count
ed immediately because of problems at
polling stations.
Israel radio said more than 75 percent
of all ballots cast — including the absen
tee ballots — had been counted. Most of
the absentee ballots are from soldiers
who in the past have tended to support
the right.
Peres did not appear before Labor
supporters, and Netanyahu spoke only
briefly to his backers before his lead
became apparent.
Initial projections had Peres ahead by
a small margin, and the turnaround
prompted cheers, dancing and applause
at Likud Party headquarters, where sup
porters had openly wept earlier in the
night.
A victory for Netanyahu, a severe crit

ic of Peres' land-for-peace policies, would
almost certainly slow the current pace of
peacemaking with both the Palestinians
and Israel's Arab neighbors. The out
come of the vote was anxiously awaited
throughout Israel and in capitals around
the world.
The Clinton administration has ener
getically supported Peres' peace efforts,
but was careful to remain neutral in the
vote.
Much of Israel stayed up throughout
the night to find out who the country's
next prime minister would be.
Peres benefited from a high turnout in
the Arab community, where 97.5 percent
of the voters backed him, according to
Channel 1. The turnout was 77.1 per
cent, 7 percent higher than in the 1992
elections.
