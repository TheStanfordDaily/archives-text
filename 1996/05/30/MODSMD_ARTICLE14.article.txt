Federal government
should not subsidize
faculty kids' schooling
STANFORD EXISTS IN a
paradoxical financial state.
While the University is fund
ing the ever-growing campus and
curricula — for example, the addi
tion of the Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity program — it
simultaneously cuts ostensibly
extraneous administrative and
academic positions in an attempt
to streamline spending. With the
government no longer allowing
private universities to use federal
funding for faculty benefits, Stan
ford must once again examine its
budget and determine its financial
priorities.
On May 8, the federal Office of
Management and Budget deter
mined that the government will no
longer pay for tuition benefits
beginning in September 1999.
Currently, Stanford provides for
half the cost of Stanford's tuition
to the children of those who have
been employed at the University
for at least five years. Of that
money, Stanford provides about
two-thirds. The federal govern
ment supports the rest.
Providing such benefits to
employees is a vital aspect of
recruiting top administrators and
professors, which then allows
Stanford to attract academically
elite undergraduate and graduate
students. However, there is a fun
damental problem with using fed
eral funds for this purpose.
As a private university, Stan
ford has a tremendous amount of
freedom in determining how it
spends its money, and using Uni
versity funds — which come from
areas such as tuition and alumni
giving — to provide benefits to
employees is certainly within its
prerogative. However, asking tax
payers to support a privately

owned university s employment
perks is counterintuitive. It seems
illogical that someone with no
affiliation to Stanford should help
ensure its success as an institu
tion. One might argue that ensur
ing Stanford's success supports
higher education in general, but in
a competitive market one should
have the choice of supporting one
such institution over another.
When the policy was initially
proposed in February 1995, the
University unsuccessfully negoti
ated with the OMB to convince it
to allow private universities to use
public funds for employee benefits.
Now that the policy has gone into
effect, the University is planning
to lobby the federal government
while also examining the options
regarding the current benefits
plan.
While it is easy to recognize the
constraints this places on the Uni
versity, the policy issued by the
OMB should be honored by Stan
ford's administration. Lobbying
the government not only seems a
fruitless effort — that time and
energy could be spent on rethink
ing Stanford's budget in light of
the policy change — but is also
theoretically incorrect. Stanford
should accept this and work with
in the University — not with the
federal government — to cover its
benefits costs.
University President Gerhard
Casper has already taken the ini
tiative to support funding for
graduate research through his
proposed Graduate Fellows pro
gram, for which he is soliciting
funds from alumni to provide
research grants. Perhaps a similar
program could help Stanford
maintain its benefits program and
attract top faculty.
In order to cut the budget, the
University has had to prioritize its
programs and additions. The
removal of federal funding from its
benefits program — though just —
will put a strain on University
resources. Stanford must examine
ways it can solicit funds outside
the federal government.
