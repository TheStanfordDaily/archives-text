## Lessons of the fifth grade 
### 
MY FIFTH-GRADE English teach
er felt it was his duty to teach not
only nouns and verbs, but the
cruel realities of the world as well. Mr.
Moran was a fat, weathered old man with
a charisma that only fat, weathered old
men have. His somewhat unfortunate
surname had toughened him to the trials
of elementary-school teaching. Mr. Moran
was too deliciously close to Mr. Moron for
fifth graders' wits (second to only our
principal, Mr. Burger, for comic poten
tial). Perhaps scarred by the years of
relentless puns, he considered it his
solemn duty to instill us with the terrors
that lurked beyond the sandbox.
We were already nervous little fifth
graders preparing to make the leap to sixth
grade — not just nnother grade, but the
beginning of middle school. We'd bo bussed
out of our neighborhood across town to the
ominously named Pitts Middle School. It
was called that to honor some educator
named Samuel Pitts. In actuality, it was a
disgrace to his legacy, a veritable factory
for ugly, mean-spirited youths. We'd all
heard the stories: Kids there smoked
cigarettes, held daily fights behind the
school, stuffed sixth graders into lockers.
But we still had some time before
entering this hormonal hell and Mr.
Moran was going to toughen us up. He
wasn't like a drill sergeant, just a bearer
of bad omens. He constantly alluded to
horrible realities that we were on the
brink of exposure to. Sure tests were bad,

but next year we'd have pop quizzes. Sure
participles were tough, but next year
we'd face gerunds.
His omens weren't confined to school
life. He told us about the outside world
too. His most haunting lesson was about
the auto industry. This was the early '80s,
when "Buy American" was a religion,
Bruce Springsteen wrote the hymns and
Honda offered temptation. But Mr. Moran
would have none of it. The American auto
makers had brought it on themselves, he
claimed. They'd let quality slide, stopped
innovating and, worst of all, practiced
"planned obsolescence" — they'd literally
design cars to fall apart after seven years
so that drivers would have to buy another.
The treachery of this system rocked
my" little fifth-grade world. How could
you build something and plan for it to fall
apart? Did they sabotage one crucial part,
or just make everything a little weak?
There's a distinct difference between
accepting that a car won't run forever
and crafting an Achilles heel for it. Either
way, did they think we wouldn't know?
Was this a secret, or just one of those
scrupulously avoided facts of life?
Many years later, in high school, the
planned obsolescence plan caught up
with me. One night I was driving in my
1979 Chevrolet Caprice with Hilary
Sheehan when its fated components
came due. Hilary was my girlfriend, or we
were "going out" as it was known at the
time. The relationship was predictably

pretty chaste. Hilary, as you may have
guessed, was a Catholic girl, and I was
whatever I was at that time, something
like a eunuch for the stability of the het
erosexual order. But ours was a nice
arrangement. Hilary was nice to be close
to, and in the high school world of cou
pling, "going out" was the best way for us
to be close.
Hilary and I were looking for a party
that night. By a "party" I mean the rural
Colorado practice of kids huddling
around a keg out on the prairie. But that
night the cops had found the keg or some
thing and there was no party to be found.
So Hilary and I wound up driving around,
out on the prairie — until the lights went
out. All of my Chevrolet's electrical sys
tems failed. No headlights, no radio.
Steering, braking, accelerating: all took
on their own life, not reckless but defi
nitely not under my control.
The car was like an alien vessel and we
were both scared. But we were miles from
town and there was nothing to do but go
with it. So we just kind of calmed and
rode in silence — one of the nicest experi
ences of my life. The hum of the engine,
the darkness and the stars. And us, she
and I, in it. Whistling through the air and
sailing over the dirt for a while.
