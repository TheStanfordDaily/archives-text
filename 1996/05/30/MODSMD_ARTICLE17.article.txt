Daily editorial on Mem Chu revealed anti-religion bias

Though not surprising, it, is
particularly disappointing that when
The Daily's editorial board should at
last address an issue of some weight, it
should do so with astonishing ignorance.
The headline on Wednesday's editorial,
"Church functions," promised a piece that
would raise important questions about said
functions. All it managed to deliver, though,
was a juvenile understanding of such (unc
tions and an uneasiness with regard to the
recent appointment of Rabbi Karlin-Neu
mann as associate dean of the church.
"It seems silly to belabor the point" that
Memorial Church is "a Christian house of
worship," the editorial says, pointing to the
Christian iconography about the building.
It seems at least as silly for me to point out
to The Daily that church buildings are not
synonymous with churches, but apparently
it must be done. Worship has taken place
and will continue to take place outside
appointed houses of worship. This is not
news. Meanwhile, church buildings man

age to serve as bingo halls without crises of
identity. Memorial Church has been a con
cert hall even to those a cappella groups
which are distinctly non-Christian. North
Point Press, a small literary publishing
house, used to operate out of an old church
building near Berkeley; they published no
liturgical material. I know of a church
where a curtain is drawn back from a cru
cifix afler Saturday's Jewish services, and
then replaced after Sunday's Episcopalian.
Memorial Church is a Christian house of
worship, The Daily writes, and "There is
no reason for anyone to pretend other
wise." Yes, there is no reason to pretend
otherwise, but there is every reason to
make it otherwise, and the appointment of
Rabbi Karlin-Neumann begins to do so.
That The Daily apparently thinks such
a progressive move is precluded by archi
tecture is symptomatic not just of general
ignorance of theology and religious prac
tice, but of an unargued distaste for reli
gion. As long as Memorial Church is a pre

dominantly Christian institution, The
Daily can bash its exclusivity and thereby
religion's whole place on the Stanford cam
pus; once Memorial Church takes a step
towards diversifying itself to serve more of
the campus community, there is less
ground on which its detractors can stand.
The appointment of one rabbi does not put
Memorial Church instantly in touch with
all Stanford students of all faiths. But
there is such a thing as progress, and call
ing this appointment an act of "tokenism"
not only demeans the efforts of Memorial
Church to make that progress, but, worse,
it demeans (even negates) Rabbi Karlin-
Neumann and her capacity to serve the
Stanford community.
The headline "Rabbi fills associate dean
post at church" is not "counterintuitive,"
and The Daily's assertion that it is betrays
only that its editorial board imagines the
boundaries between religious groups to be
near as rigid as they were in old Germany.
Its claim of desiring to "spark a wide-rang

ing discussion of religion at Stanford" is
grossly misstated; what it seems to want is
wide-ranging consensus that religion at
Stanford can never leave the Middle Ages,
and that this attempt to, this transgression
against tradition ought to be regarded with
the same reactionary skepticism that has
earned many manifestations of religion the
tarnished image The Daily seems to hold of
it. The monolithic notion of religion by
which these editors seem to feel they are
threatened (all the more because they do
not understand it) indeed conceals some
horrific oppressions, and its history
deserves reproach. But how the leadership
of a Jewish woman in a Christian church
exacerbates these or any problems is utter
ly beyond me; and people who hold the
high-school-caliber notion that the solution
is to throw out the whole damn institution
can do social reform the favor of steering
clear.
