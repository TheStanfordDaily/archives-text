# Students respond to hotel manager's letter
## 
### 
We want to respond to the letter written
by the general manager at the Stanford
Park Hotel, which appeared in the May 3
issue of The Daily, and to clarify why stu
dents at Stanford are supporting the boy
cott at the Stanford Park Hotel.
Stanford students arc supporting the
boycott at the Stanford Park I lotel out of
solidarity with the workers who are fight
ing for a union at the Ijafayette Park and
Monterey Plaza hotels. All three of these
hotels are operated by the Redwood City
based Western Ixxlging Group. The work
ers began to organize at the hotels in Mon
terey and Ijafayette, fed up with the lack of
respect and dignity, the racism they
encountered on the job and the poverty
wages they were receiving. The company
retaliated by firing several union support

ers and creating a climate of fear and
intimidation in the hotels. A boycott was
launched over a year ago against all of the
hotels in this chain, including the Stanford
Park I lotel, because they are closely linked.
Though the manager's article claims
that "the hotel is independently owned, not
part of a chain", the evidence suggests oth
erwise: All six hotels under boycott are
operated by Western I /xlging Group; the
hotels shiire marketing and outreach
through brochures and other literature
listing all six hotels, a joint web page and
other advertising; all the hotels are linked
to a South Hay man named Ellis Alden,
who is a part ial or principal owner of the
six Western Lodging Group hotels. Alden is
also president of Western Ixxlging Group.
Stanford students will continue to
support this boycott until the labor dis
pute is resolved, despite the shell game
Western Lodging Group is playing. We
encourage all members of the University
community, including departments, par

ents, faculty and staff, to not patronize
the Stanford Park Hotel or any other
Western Lodging Group Hotel.
