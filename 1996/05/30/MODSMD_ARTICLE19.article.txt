# Daily coverage missed bigger story at Mela '96
## 
### 
As participants in and audience mem
bers of Mela '96 we were surprised to read
of "disturbances and batteiy at Mela '96,"
as reported in Tuesday's Daily. Many of
the others who attended were also sur
prised that there was any type of major
problem at the show. However, from The
Daily's coverage of the event one would
suspect that a gang fight erupted. Both the

disturbances and batteiy were insignificant
parts of an elaborate show.
The participants spent many long hours
creating and perfecting their performances,
only to be overshadowed by sensationalistic
coverage that perfunctorily described what
was in the program.
The lack of concern with the show itself
is demonstrated by the article's inaccura
cy. It was Sanskriti co-chairs Jay Mandal
and Janki Bhuva that announced that
Sanskriti had received an honorable men
tion for the Saturn award, not the emcees.
We feel that Mela is a community build
ing event and for The Daily to almost
exclusively focus on the unfortunate inci
dent detracts from the purpose of Mela.
Mela is an event where we can learn, expe
rience and enjoy our culture and share it
with the Stanford community.
