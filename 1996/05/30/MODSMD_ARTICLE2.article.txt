## ... is where you'd already be if you lived in the ritzy Kingscote Gardens 
### Tracy Jan Contributing writer 
Students who are not satisfied with Draw
results or who are just seeking a quieter place
to live have another option often unknown to
them. Hidden in a grove of trees behind the
Faculty Club and next to Roble Hall lies
Kingscote Gardens, with its ivy-covered, Eng
lish-style apartments.
The four-story house is conveniently locat
ed right in the center of campus, even though
most students have never seen or heard of it.
"Kingscote is a sanctuary away from Stan

ford. Yet, it's right in the middle of campus,"
said junior Jennifer Hill.
According to Suzan Nichols, manager of the
property, Kingscote was built in the 1920s for
visiting scholars and their families by friends of
Jane Stanford.
The house is mysterious because Kingscote,
the only privately owned apartment building
on campus, is not located on any University
map. "Everyone thinks this place is supposed
to be a secret. It's odd that just because we're
not owned by the University, we're not on the
map. I have to give extensive directions to most
people and they still get lost. It's as if we don't

exist," Nichols said.
"Kingscote hits always been set up like apart
ments," Nichols said. Originally intended for
short-term stays, the house was run like a resi
dential hotel in the early days, complete with
furnished units and maid and linen service.
Today, t he house has been converted into .36
apartments for students, faculty, staff and oth
ers affiliated with Stanford. The majority of
apartments are studios, with a living room,
bathroom and kitchen. Residents now must
provide their own furniture. The price, includ-
ing utilities, ranges from $475 to
$1,275 per month.
"I like the privacy, large rooms
and big, beautiful croquet lawns,"
said junior Analivia Suchman.
For senior Julianne Galich, per
sonal space, freedom and indepen
dence were the main reasons she
chose to live at Kingscote this year.
"It is more expensive than the
dorms, but here you are not tied to
a meal plan. You can cook for your
self and eat whenever you want to,"
Galich said.
"The drawback is that it's real
ly quiet. I sometimes feel as if I'm
stepping on eggshells,'' said
Galich, who signed a contract to
limit noise after S) p.m. "There are
many different types of people liv
ing here, but it's anti-social be
cause you just don't cross paths,"
she said.
However, Galich said Kingscote
provided a good transition back into
university life after returning from
a year abroad in Spain.
"One of our many legacies is that

it's very quiet around here. We used
to have a fairly bad reputation as
not being a very comfortable place
to live," Nichols said. "It's a lot bet
ter now, but we still try to maintain
that quiet and conservative atmos
phere."
The differences in age and
lifestyle among the residents damp
en the social atmosphere, Nichols
said. Loud parties are prohibited
because the old walls are very thin,
with minimal insulation. "It is a
matter of respect and considera
tion. There are people here who
work 9 to 5 and must get their rest,"
Nichols said.
There is not a lot of interaction
among Kingscote residents. "We
are not a very social house. People
are in class or work all day. We are
not a dorm. We don't have a social
director," Nichols said.
Most of the residents come into
the house knowing its reputation,
so noise is not usually a problem,
Nichols said. Some people, such as
couples and graduate students,
specifically seek that type of envi
ronment.
The problem, according to
Nichols, is the availability of the in
creasingly popular apartments.

The tenant with the longest term
has been living at Kingscote since
1959. "Only half of the apartments
turn over every year. There are
usually 20 or less for rent, so it is
first-come, first-serve," Nichols
said of the application process. The
house is usually filled by April.
Nichols said she no longer needs to
advertise due to the large word-of
mouth factor.
"I've been here for three years
and love it here. You cannot beat
the location. The grounds are
beautiful and well-maintained.
This is a nice, comfortable place to
live," Nichols said. "I feel very safe
here with the police and fire de
partments right down the street.
We have all the benefits of living in
a small town with our own post of
fice and bookstore," she said.
For security purposes, the front
doors are locked at nights and
weekends. Tenants are asked to
meet visitors at the door, Nichols
said. "It is not respectable to yell or
throw things up at the windows,"
she said.
The lease for Kingscote Gardens
will be up in March 1997. "I hope
the University keeps it residential
and lets me stay," Nichols said.
