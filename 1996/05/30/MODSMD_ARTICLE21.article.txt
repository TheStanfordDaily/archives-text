"Fuck school, fuck school, fuck my school."
— The Replacements
WILL ALL THE students of Stan
ford University please stand up.
Burn the palm trees and drain the
lake. The end has begun.
This is not a test; do not attempt to
study. Do not contact your parents for
moral support or a frozen yogurt allowance.
1 )o not attempt to do a problem set or write
a well-researched paper.
Do not seek out the machines in Sweet
Hall, Tresidder Union or your dormitoiy's
"computer cluster." The machines will not
help you. These areas will be searched and
the humans within summarily deleted.
Do not attempt to think. You are all
idiots.
Will the person who stopped talking to
me because I didn't "draw" with her please
step forward. You are a victim of dramatic
irony. You have become what you despise.
Do not seek the advice of your "RA." He
or she is being tried for crimes against
humanity and self-awareness. He or she will

be found guilty as charged.
Will all the sophomores who have
become complete wrecks please step for
ward. Stanford took care of you last year,
but now everything has gone wrong. You
have no friends and nobody cares. You saw
your roommate at a party last weekend.
Sophomores, please convene in the Roble
Dining Hall. This is not a drill. Have some
pasta. It will only get worse.
Do not adjust your Macintosh. "Friends"
will not be showing tonight.
Will all the members of sororities please
meet at the Rodin Sculpture Garden. Line
up by chest-size and file through the Gates
of Hell. Your respective fraternity date
rapists will meet you within.
Do not contact the Bridge Peer Counsel
ing Center. Nobody has a soul at Stanford.
Yeah, right. L.vactly.
Will all the students who attended the
Sigma Chi "Cowabunga" party or the
Twain "Wing-Wang" please make them
selves known. You will be quarantined in
the Coffee House, or "Co Ho," as you call it.
Do not leave. Do not speak to each other;

you have nothing to say. Do not attempt to
have meaningless sex with someone you
don't know. Drink pitchers of pear cider and
smoke someone else's cigarettes until you
vomit. Lie there on the dirty floor, cursing
yourself and your existence.
Do not adjust your radio. KOME is dead.
A good song is playing. The song says:
"Good night to the rock 'n' roll era."
Will all my friends who vanished from
Stanford without a sound please take a step
forward. This school and the people here
drove you clear to Montana, Nevada, Mas
sachusetts. Anywhere is better than here.
Stanford has classified you as "crazy" or
"bitter" or "weird." They said you "lost it,"
but you're the only ones who didn't. I would
like to apologize for not following you.
Will the young lady who told me the fol
lowing please step forward: "You're the
worst kind of person. Because you want peo
ple to think these things about you, but
you're not genuinely like that." Your only
crime is that you're grossly mistaken. I am
genuinely like this. I am not the worst kind
of person. Rather, I am surrounded by the

worst kind of people.
Do not seek levels of irony that don't
exist. Do not attempt to turn my sarcasm
against me. I mean everything I've said.
Will all the seniors please step forward.
It's been a long time since Orientation, kids,
but nothing has changed. Put on silly hats
and dresses and report to a ceremony to be
held in a little over two weeks. I sentence
you to a life as ineffective and incognizant as
it has been so far. If it were a book, no one
would read it.
Will all the freshmen and juniors please
come forth. I sentence you to be sophomores
at Stanford and, worse yet, seniors. You will
not escape this fate.
Do not contact the Office of the Bursar.
They have taken your parents' money and
called you assholes. They were right.
Will the core staff of The Stanford Daily
please gather in the Storke Publications
Building. Do not attempt to be creative or
critical. You are ready to be journalists now.
You are ready to reinforce a status quo of
mediocrity in America, as you have done
here.

Will the stafT of The Stanford Review
please meet in the same place. Introduce
yourselves to your allies from The Daily.
You have done more for their cause than
anyone. You have supported the main
stream by ensuring that the opposition is
far more repulsive.
Do not go to the Quad. It is being reno
vated. It will never be finished. It is unsafe.
It will never be safe for intelligence.
Will my friend who asked me the follow
ing please come forward: "Where do Stan
ford people come from?" I don't know, Bud.
I don't know. Probably the same place
they're going.
Will the students of Stanford University
please stand up. Do not seek the wacky wit
ticisms and insidious insights of Daily
columnist Josh Gohlke. They are only
meant to hurt you. Do not attempt to
befriend him or identify with him in any
way. Do not laugh with him.
He is laughing at you.
