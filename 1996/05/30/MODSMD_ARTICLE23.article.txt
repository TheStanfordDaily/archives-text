## Scientists develop gene regulation technique New system allows use of antibiotic to control protein production by genes 
### Yvette Delahoussaye Contributing writer 
Scientists at the Medical Center have developed a new
system for inserting specific genes into the DNA of cells and
then controlling the amount of protein these genes produce
by using varying amounts of tetracycline, a common antibi
otic. This technique has broad applications for gene therapy
and for studying development and cell signaling in organ
isms.
"This is one of the first all-in-one systems for controlling
gene regulation," said Garry Nolan, assistant professor of
molecular pharmacology.
The new system, known as the SIN-RetroTet vector, is
detailed in Tuesday's issue of the Proceedings of the Na
tional Academy of Science.
"We basically have a system that we can use to repro
ducibly and reversibly turn genes on and ofT at a certain
point, either in the development of an organism or in the
cycle of a cell," said I lelen Blau, professor of molecular phar
macology.
The method involves taking the desired gene, which is a
portion of DNA that a protein is made from, and inserting it
into a retrovirus. A ret rovirus is a virus that inserts its ge

netic material into the DNA of the host and uses its host's
cell machinery to replicate itself.
The retrovirus is modified such that the desired gene is
regulated by the amount of the antibiotic tetracycline that
reaches the cell. It is also constructed such that the viral
genes turn themselves off once the virus is integrated into
the target cells, thus eliminating potential side-effects from
viral infection.
Once the gene is integrated into the target cell, its protein
output can be manipulated by varying the amounts of tetra
cycline that the cells receive.
"We can put different amounts of tetracycline into the
drinking water of mice that have the regulatable genes in
their cells and see a very good dose response — that is, the
protein levels rise and fall with the levels of tetracycline in
the cells," said Blau.
Previous methods of regulating gene expression were te
dious, time-consuming and limited only to certain cell types.
They also required several months to set up.
"Now we can integrate the gene and look at the expres
sion within two weeks. We can also look at whole popula
tions of thousands of cells, rather than just a handful of suc
cessfully integrated colonies," said Blau.
"We have some collaborators who are now using this sys

tem to look at the expression of genes that can supprt
tumorgrowth. Tumor suppresser genes, if expressed at hi]
levels in tumors, could potentially halt the growth," said A
dreas Hofmann, a postdoctoral fellow in Blau's lab and t
lead author of the paper. "This system will make possil
studies in cell signaling and development that were pre
ously not possible."
This system also allows for study of gene products th
could be toxic if continuously expressed at high levels, i
cording to Blau.
"Scientists are starting to use biology to understand bi<
ogy," said Nolan. "We can use tools that nature has devi
oped and refashion them in our own design. For examp
viruses have learned how to get into cells without being n
ticed, and now we've gutted them and shaped them to he
our understanding of how cells and viruses function."
"Development, cell growth and signaling all happen
quickly in the body. This method will allow scientists
turn on genes in certain time frames," Nolan said.
"We can ask, 'What wiil happen if I throw a monkc
wrench in the works right now?' and see what happer
Throwing a wrench at the beginning of a cellular proct
does not tell us what we need to know. This system giv
us control over our experiments," he said.
