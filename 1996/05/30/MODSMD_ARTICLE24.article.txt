### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
One Stanford athlete saw her
season come to an unspectacular

finish, and two others
extended theirs until to
morrow as the 1996
NCAA Track and Field
Outdoor Championships
got under way yesterday
afternoon at Hayward
Field in Eugene, Ore.
Three of the Cardi
nal's nine NCAA quali
fiers took part in the

day's events, led by sophomore
Monal Chokshi, who shaved
nearly 10 seconds off her career
best time in qualifying for the
final of the women's 3,000 me
ters.
Chokshi, a native of Bridge
water, N.J., ran an astonishing
9:18.14, third-best in her heat
and barely a minute off the pace
set by top qualifier Milena Glu
sack of Oregon (9:17.10). Chok
shi's previous best was a
9:27.86, which she ran in a four
way meet against Air Force, UC-
Irvine and Wisconsin on March
30. Meanwhile, freshman Mary
Cobb ran a 9:29.34 to finish

sixth in her heat and
earn the 12th and final
qualifying spot in to
morrow's 7:25 p.m.
final.
Cheering on Chokshi
and Cobb on Friday will
be senior Sue Demars,
who started things off
for the Cardinal by
competing in the first
field event of the day,

the women's discus. Demars, a
senior from Walker, Minn., had
notched an NCAA provisional
qualifying mark of 169 feet, 10
inches at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships on May 19,
but she couldn't duplicate that
performance yesterday, throw
ing 157-4 to finishlBth in the na
tion. Anna Soderberg of North
ern Arizona took first with a
throw of 195-3.
Three more Cardinal athletes
will compete in heats tomorrow
in hopes of qualifying for Satur

day night's finals. Senior Dena
Dey will run in the women's
1,500 meters, redshirt sopho
more Jason Lunn will run the
1,500 and sophomore

Sarna Renfro will com
pete in the 3,000.
Tennis: Ania Bleszyns
ki and Ryan Wolters
may not have seen their
dreams of a singles title
unfold at last week's
NCAA championships,
but the two did bring
home some good news

nonetheless.
Bleszynski, a sophomore, and
Wolters, a freshman, will have to
scrap their summer plans after
being selected to the inaugural
U.S. Tennis Association Ail-
American Summer Team last
Sunday. This newly-created
elite training program for top
American collegiate tennis play
ers will be administered by the
USTA and the Intercollegiate
Tennis Association.
In all, six men and six women
were named to the All-American
Summer Team, which will trav
el to USTA Player Development
Headquarters in Key Biscayne,

Fla., for a five-day
training session in
June. After the train
ing session, the players
will compete as ama
teurs at USTA satellite
events before meeting
for a joint training
camp in Princeton,
N.J., Aug. 12-14. That
camp will be followed
by the ITA National

Summer Collegiate Champi
onships, also at Princeton, with
the men's and women's singles
and doubles winners earning
wild cards into the U.S. Open
Qualifying Tournament.
Other notable selections to
the team included Pacific 10
Conference rivals Cecil Mamiit
and Adam Peterson of USC and
Eric Taino of UCLA, as well as
Florida senior Jill Craybas, who
ousted Bleszynski from the
NCAA singles tournament in a
semifinal match.
