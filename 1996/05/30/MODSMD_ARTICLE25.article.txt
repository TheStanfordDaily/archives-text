# Golf comes out blazing at NCAAs
## Men place third after one round; Woods shoots 69 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Battling to continue its Cin
derella postseason run, the 15th
ranked Stanford men's golf team
delivered a sparkling first-round
performance yesterday after
noon to find itself in the third
place at the NCAA champi
onships.
On the unfamiliar links of the
Honors Course in Chattanooga,
Tenn., the West Coast displayed
a surprising dominance, snatch
ing four of the top Five spots,
with Florida, the East's lone con
tender, in fourth place. No. 2 Ari
zona State established itself as
the team to beat, roaring out to
take the lead with the only
under-par score of the day at
286. No. 3 Nevada-Las Vegas fin
ished the day in second at 291,
with Stanford trailing by a single
stroke.
"First of all, I'm just happy to
be here," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "As a team, I thought
our mental attitude was great.
We played pretty solid golf today.
We only had two bad holes out of
90."
The Cardinal relied heavily on
solid play by its young guns,
sophomore Tiger Woods and
freshman Joel Kribel, whose
scores were good for second and
19th, respectively.
Thrilling the huge galleries
that turned out to see golfs
newest sensation, Woods had his
game kicking in all gears, firing a
3-under-par 69 and trailing
leader Pat Perez of ASU by only
one stroke.
"Overall, I thought I hit the
ball pretty solidly. I made some
pressure tee shots down the
stretch, and made some long
putts," he said.
Even fortune seemed to be
smiling on Woods. After an er
rant shot on the 11th hole, it ap
peared that he might be assessed
a two-stroke lost-ball penalty.
After a short search, however, a
fan located it.
"I'd say that this was a perfect
start," Woods said. "I know I'm
close to the lead as an individual
and there are three more rounds
to go where anything can hap
pen.

Freshman Joel Kribel concentrates on a putt during the NCAA West Regional two weeks ago. Yesterday,
Kribel shot a 1-over-par 73 to finish tied for 19th after one round of play at the NCAA Championships in
Chattanooga, Tenn.
"What makes it better is that
today was our afternoon round,
and it can be hard to go low because
of the condition of the greens by
this time. Tomorrow, I'll feel very
positive going off early."
As easy as Woods may have
made it seem, the course gave con
niptions to most. Senior captain
Jerry Chang found how quickly
the course could turn on one's
game. Two under and vying for
the lead after 14, Chang hit a wall
on the 15th, seeing his score bal
loon with a triple-bogey there and
a bogey on the 18th. He eventually
finished the day in a tie for 30th.
"This golf course is very de
manding," Chang said. "I'd call it
relentless. This course is a real
test of golf."
Even Woods afforded the
course a healthy amount of re
spect.
"The course? It's hard," he

said. "You re stressed all the way
around. There are no breather
holes.
"Some of the shorter holes are
some of tin l more demanding
holes, especially considering the
undulation of the greens. It's a
really demanding course."
Junior Conrad Ray and senior
David Garcia rounded out the
Cardinal effort, finishing the day
in 58th and 108 th place, respec
tively. Hay contributed a solid 76
to the team effort, shootingeven
par through the front nine. Gar
cia however, proved to be anoth
er casualty of the course, unable
to recover from a crippling
quadruple-bogey on No. 7.
"This place will do that to a lot
people," Chang said. "These are
the top 30 teams in the nation
and we're seeing scores out here
that we haven't seen all year
long.
"Overall though, we have to be
pretty happy knowing where we
are. I hope we can stay strong
