# Golf comes out blazing at NCAAs
## Men place third after one round; Woods shoots 69 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
Battling to continue its Cin
derella postseason run, the 15th
ranked Stanford men's golf team
delivered a sparkling first-round
performance yesterday after
noon to find itself in the third
place at the NCAA champi
onships.
On the unfamiliar links of the
Honors Course in Chattanooga,
Tenn., the West Coast displayed
a surprising dominance, snatch
ing four of the top Five spots,
with Florida, the East's lone con
tender, in fourth place. No. 2 Ari
zona State established itself as
the team to beat, roaring out to
take the lead with the only
under-par score of the day at
286. No. 3 Nevada-Las Vegas fin
ished the day in second at 291,
with Stanford trailing by a single
stroke.
"First of all, I'm just happy to
be here," said head coach Wally
Goodwin. "As a team, I thought
our mental attitude was great.
We played pretty solid golf today.
We only had two bad holes out of
90."
The Cardinal relied heavily on
solid play by its young guns,
sophomore Tiger Woods and
freshman Joel Kribel, whose
scores were good for second and
19th, respectively.
Thrilling the huge galleries
that turned out to see golfs
newest sensation, Woods had his
game kicking in all gears, firing a
3-under-par 69 and trailing
leader Pat Perez of ASU by only
one stroke.
"Overall, I thought I hit the
ball pretty solidly. I made some
pressure tee shots down the
stretch, and made some long
putts," he said.
Even fortune seemed to be
smiling on Woods. After an er
rant shot on the 11th hole, it ap
peared that he might be assessed
a two-stroke lost-ball penalty.
After a short search, however, a
fan located it.
"I'd say that this was a perfect
start," Woods said. "I know I'm
close to the lead as an individual
and there are three more rounds
to go where anything can hap
pen.
