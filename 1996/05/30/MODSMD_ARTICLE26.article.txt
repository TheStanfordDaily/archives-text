# Stanford water-skiing makes a splash
## Squad quietly earning a name for itself in just its second year of existence 
### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
New sports at Stanford have a
knack for moving quickly up the food
chain of collegiate athletics. Softball,
elevated from club status just three
years ago, is developing into one of
the strongest programs in the Pacif
ic* 10. Women's water polo, in its first
year as a varsity sport, soared to a
fifth-place finish at collegiate nation
als this season.
What next? Water-skiing?
Well, it may not be the stuff of
Wheaties boxes or even the Stanford
Sports Hall of Fame, but the largely
unknown Stanford water-ski team is
quietly making a name for itself in
the Western Region of the National
Collegiate Water-ski Association. In
just its second year of existence, the
team has worked its way into the top
10 in the region, and for the first
time sent a skier to the National Col
legiate All-Star Water-ski Tourna
ment in Arizona May 18-19.
Never heard of 'em, you say ?
Part of the problem might be
that they're never around. The
team travels far and wide to com
pete in tournaments held through
out California, Washington and
Arizona in the fall and spring, rour
nament format normally consists of
three events — slalom, trick and
jump — with tournament teams
consisting of five men and five
women. The points earned in each
event are totaled to determine the
winner.
What makes the team's success
all the more impressive is the severe
handicap under which it competes.
The Stanford skiers — not yet recog
nized as a club sport by the Universi
ty — must often compete against
varsity teams with skiers on full
scholarship.
"There are teams like Arizona
State and Sacramento State that
have skiers on scholarship — Ari
zona State has, I think, 18 skiers on
scholarship," said team president
Chad Hagle. "It's difficult for us to
compete against teams like that.
Nonetheless, Stanford has con

tinued to make headway among
teams in the Western Region. This
year, the men have placed as high as
10th in a tournament, while the
women have placed fourth.
Indeed, the team has a come a
long way since senior Adrienne Os
born started the team single-hand
edly a few years back.
"We started out with two or three
people about three years ago who
would go out and try to find a way to
water-ski at all costs," Hagle said.
"Now we're up to a team of 33 mem
bers, and we are taking full-tourna
ment teams to the tournaments this
spring. We're really starting to get a
strong core of tournament skiers who
can really have an impact on West

Region tournament water-skiing."
One of those skiers is team cap
tain Erin Thompson, who represent
ed the Cardinal in Phoenix, Ariz., at
All-Stars, a national competition. To
qualify, Thompson had to average
among the top five skiers in the; re
gion; her top two trick passes in the
regular tournament season (includ
ing an attempted flip) averaged 830
points, good for fourth.
In Phoenix, Thompson placed
14th while her team, the Western
Region, finished first. Osborn also
earned a spot on the squad by tally
ing four balls at 34 mph, 28 feet oft,
but was relegated to the alternate
spot on a technicality.
Not all skiers can perform at such

a high level of competition. While
there is a developing core of strong
tournament skiers, many skiers join
the team just for fun.
"The water-ski team is really fun
and laid-back," Thompson said,
"and you don't have to be good to
join, so everyone should join if they
want to."
With another successful year
under its belt, the team will now
focus its attention on earning more
recognition around campus.
"We're going to see if we can take
measures to incorporate ourselves
as a club sport next year or the year
after. We just want to get some
recognition from within the school,"
I lagle said.
