# Winners of the Sports Stupidity Awards '96
## 
### 
For the last three weeks I
have tried to be a conscien
tious sports columnist. I
have tried to analyze some of the
most controversial and pressing
sports issues of the year in a
thoughtful, accurate and, at
times, a humorous way.
Today, however, I plan to
forge an in-depth examination of
sports stupidity, as I offer up my
first round of post-season
awards, recognizing those mo
ments in sports that make Todd
Bozeman look like a genius. In a

year that saw the highs of Cal
Ripken's record- breaking game
and Magic Johnson's return to
the NBA, we, as a sports commu
nity, have also been forced to
wade through a mire of person
alities, incidents and innova
tions that have insulted our col
lective intelligence.
The awards I offer today are
by no means comprehensive —
they are simply a compilation of
the most offensive and inane oc
currences that fans have had to
deal with this year. I am a firm
believer in learning from the
past. Thus, I hope some execu
tive, coach or broadcaster out
there will read my column and
realize the error of his ways. As
for you, the reader, I hope you
will laugh at least once and
won't write me asking why
"Todd's Columns" did not hold a
place on my list of asininity. So
here goes...

Most Annoying Announc
er Award (MAA): This award
was possibly the most contested
of any of this year's races. All
year long, audiences have had to
put up with a wide range of an
noying, and often brainless,
sports commentary. A 1 McGuire
made a strong run at the title
when he tried to announce a
game on ABC as he fought off
laryngitis. Pat O' Brien chimed
in with a series of horrific studio
shows for CBS's "Road to the
Final Four." And most recently,
NBC's Jim Gray threw his hat in
the ring with his questioning of
an Orlando Magic executive —
perhaps the most ridiculous in
terview I have seen this year.
However, after all is said and
done, the winner has to be
NBC's Bill Walton. Walton, who
was one of the most dominant
college basketball centers ever,
shows us night in and night out
that all he did at UCLA was play
basketball. With such comments
as, "It's almost impossible to win
if your opponent outscores you
in every quarter," and "It's real
ly hard to appreciate just how
tall Detlef Schrempf really is,"
Walton emerged as the MAA
front-runner early in the NBA
season.
What cinches the win for the
academically-challenged giant is
that he actually knows basket
ball. He won championships
both in college and the NBA. He
played against the likes of
Abdul-Jabbar and Chamberlain
— the guy has to have a great
deal of insight into the game of
basketball.
The problem is that the
knowledge he has in his brain
dissipates before it leaves his
mouth, and all the audience is
left with is a stream of irrele
