# Winners of the Sports Stupidity Awards '96
## 
### 
For the last three weeks I
have tried to be a conscien
tious sports columnist. I
have tried to analyze some of the
most controversial and pressing
sports issues of the year in a
thoughtful, accurate and, at
times, a humorous way.
Today, however, I plan to
forge an in-depth examination of
sports stupidity, as I offer up my
first round of post-season
awards, recognizing those mo
ments in sports that make Todd
Bozeman look like a genius. In a

year that saw the highs of Cal
Ripken's record- breaking game
and Magic Johnson's return to
the NBA, we, as a sports commu
nity, have also been forced to
wade through a mire of person
alities, incidents and innova
tions that have insulted our col
lective intelligence.
The awards I offer today are
by no means comprehensive —
they are simply a compilation of
the most offensive and inane oc
currences that fans have had to
deal with this year. I am a firm
believer in learning from the
past. Thus, I hope some execu
tive, coach or broadcaster out
there will read my column and
realize the error of his ways. As
for you, the reader, I hope you
will laugh at least once and
won't write me asking why
"Todd's Columns" did not hold a
place on my list of asininity. So
here goes...

Most Annoying Announc
er Award (MAA): This award
was possibly the most contested
of any of this year's races. All
year long, audiences have had to
put up with a wide range of an
noying, and often brainless,
sports commentary. A 1 McGuire
made a strong run at the title
when he tried to announce a
game on ABC as he fought off
laryngitis. Pat O' Brien chimed
in with a series of horrific studio
shows for CBS's "Road to the
Final Four." And most recently,
NBC's Jim Gray threw his hat in
the ring with his questioning of
an Orlando Magic executive —
perhaps the most ridiculous in
terview I have seen this year.
However, after all is said and
done, the winner has to be
NBC's Bill Walton. Walton, who
was one of the most dominant
college basketball centers ever,
shows us night in and night out
that all he did at UCLA was play
basketball. With such comments
as, "It's almost impossible to win
if your opponent outscores you
in every quarter," and "It's real
ly hard to appreciate just how
tall Detlef Schrempf really is,"
Walton emerged as the MAA
front-runner early in the NBA
season.
What cinches the win for the
academically-challenged giant is
that he actually knows basket
ball. He won championships
both in college and the NBA. He
played against the likes of
Abdul-Jabbar and Chamberlain
— the guy has to have a great
deal of insight into the game of
basketball.
The problem is that the
knowledge he has in his brain
dissipates before it leaves his
mouth, and all the audience is
left with is a stream of irrele


Todd
Bernstein
vant, annoying commentary from
one of the best centers of all time.
Upon learning of his MAA award,
an exuberant Walton was heard to
speak: "I am honored to receive
such a prestigious award — you
know what they say, 'Sometimes it
just rains cats and dogs.' "
Most Ridiculous Line Spo
ken by a Sportscaster Award
(MRLSBAS): At first, the awards
committee thought Walton would
make it a clean sweep for '96, but it
was another Pac-10 veteran that
took the cake. George Raveling,
whom I laud for his consistent
praise of Pac-10 basketball, takes
this year's MRLSBAS, for a line he
somehow concocted during the
second Stanford-Cal meeting this
year. Raveling could barely con
tain himself as he watched Shareef
Abdur-Rahim dominate our
beloved Cardinal. His excitement
finally crescendoed with "If we

would have had Abdur-Rahim in
Vietnam, we would have been
home two years sooner!"
I know I probably don't have to
point out the ludicrousness of mix
ing basketball with Vietnam refer
ences, but I feel it is a must to
point out why this line excels
above all others. In addition to his
absurdity, Raveling forgot one im
portant factor — Abdur-Rahim
would have gone back to school
and skipped the draft.
A jubilant Raveling, upon hear
ing of the award, was heard to say,
"I can't believe this. If I had gotten
this award when I had coached at
USC, I would have been fired two
years sooner."
Most Asinine Sports Tech
nology (MAST): You thought it
was bad when we first saw the
"helmet-cam." You thought it
couldn't get any worse when we
had to watch the "Deion-cam."
Well, the crew over at Fox Sports
has managed to create the most ir
ritating and unnecessary televi
sion technology of all time.
I sneak of this vear's MAST re

cipient, "Fox Trax," which was in
troduced to sports audiences dur
ing this year's NHL All-Star game.
The innovation highlights the
hockey puck with a hlue light that
follows the puck's every move. To
add some Hare to the telecast, a red
"flame" ignites behind the puck on
hard slap shots.
Yes, it is true that a true hockey
fan doesn't need help in finding
the puck on hockey telecasts, but
for the sake of argument, let's say
Fox Trax has a point. The brain
trusts at Fox can't seem to keep
the blue light on the puck, and
when the puck goes into a corner,
Fox Trax creates the illusion that
the puck is actually sitting on
some fat guy's lap in the third row.
Fox people, if you are going to
continue to torture us with this
"Fox Crap," do it right, or don't do it
at all. Upon receiving the award on
behalf of Fox, some executive made
an acceptance speech. No one knew
who he was, though, because a
bright red light was shone on the
man's face throughout the evening.
And finally . . .

Stupidest Sports Column
(SSC): Before you get excited, I
can't win this one because friends
and family of the judges are not el
igible to win any awards. Anyway,
this year's race was a landslide,
and surprisingly enough it was not
won by Glenn Dickey or Ray
Ratto. No, this year's SSC goes to
an outsider — an opinions writer.
While I swore I would not legit
imize his column by making any
reference to it, I feel it is a must to
single out James G. Wheaton for
his hilarious, yet chilling piece on
why the Department of Athletics
should be dropped.
I could spend hours writing on
why Wheaton's column was stu
pid, but if you read it, you know I
don't have to. The column was
nothing more than a waste of
space, and I feel that we are all
dumber having read it.
Well, that's it for my 1996
Sports Stupidity Awards. He sure
to watch for next year's install
ment. Until then, enjoy the sum
mer and remember . . . let's be
careful out there.

in with a series of horrific studio
shows for CBS's "Road to the
Final Four." And most recently,
NBC's Jim Gray threw his hat in
the ring with his questioning of
an Orlando Magic executive —
perhaps the most ridiculous in
terview I have seen this year.
However, after all is said and
done, the winner has to be
NBC's Bill Walton. Walton, who
was one of the most dominant
college basketball centers ever,
shows us night in and night out
that all he did at UCLA was play
basketball. With such comments
as, "It's almost impossible to win
if your opponent outscores you
in every quarter," and "It's real
ly hard to appreciate just how
tall Detlef Schrempf really is,"
Walton emerged as the MAA
front-runner early in the NBA
season.
What cinches the win for the
academically-challenged giant is
that he actually knows basket
ball. He won championships
both in college and the NBA. He
played against the likes of
Abdul-Jabbar and Chamberlain
— the guy has to have a great
deal of insight into the game of
basketball.
The problem is that the
knowledge he has in his brain
dissipates before it leaves his
mouth, and all the audience is
left with is a stream of irrele

vant, annoying commentary from
one of the best centers of all time.
Upon learning of his MAA award,
an exuberant Walton was heard to
speak: "I am honored to receive
such a prestigious award — you
know what they say, 'Sometimes it
just rains cats and dogs.' "
Most Ridiculous Line Spo
ken by a Sportscaster Award
(MRLSBAS): At first, the awards
committee thought Walton would
make it a clean sweep for '96, but it
was another Pac-10 veteran that
took the cake. George Raveling,
whom I laud for his consistent
praise of Pac-10 basketball, takes
this year's MRLSBAS, for a line he
somehow concocted during the
second Stanford-Cal meeting this
year. Raveling could barely con
tain himself as he watched Shareef
Abdur-Rahim dominate our
beloved Cardinal. His excitement
finally crescendoed with "If we

would have had Abdur-Rahim in
Vietnam, we would have been
home two years sooner!"
I know I probably don't have to
point out the ludicrousness of mix
ing basketball with Vietnam refer
ences, but I feel it is a must to
point out why this line excels
above all others. In addition to his
absurdity, Raveling forgot one im
portant factor — Abdur-Rahim
would have gone back to school
and skipped the draft.
A jubilant Raveling, upon hear
ing of the award, was heard to say,
"I can't believe this. If I had gotten
this award when I had coached at
USC, I would have been fired two
years sooner."
Most Asinine Sports Tech
nology (MAST): You thought it
was bad when we first saw the
"helmet-cam." You thought it
couldn't get any worse when we
had to watch the "Deion-cam."
Well, the crew over at Fox Sports
has managed to create the most ir
ritating and unnecessary televi
sion technology of all time.
I sneak of this vear's MAST re

cipient, "Fox Trax," which was in
troduced to sports audiences dur
ing this year's NHL All-Star game.
The innovation highlights the
hockey puck with a hlue light that
follows the puck's every move. To
add some Hare to the telecast, a red
"flame" ignites behind the puck on
hard slap shots.
Yes, it is true that a true hockey
fan doesn't need help in finding
the puck on hockey telecasts, but
for the sake of argument, let's say
Fox Trax has a point. The brain
trusts at Fox can't seem to keep
the blue light on the puck, and
when the puck goes into a corner,
Fox Trax creates the illusion that
the puck is actually sitting on
some fat guy's lap in the third row.
Fox people, if you are going to
continue to torture us with this
"Fox Crap," do it right, or don't do it
at all. Upon receiving the award on
behalf of Fox, some executive made
an acceptance speech. No one knew
who he was, though, because a
bright red light was shone on the
man's face throughout the evening.
And finally . . .

Stupidest Sports Column
(SSC): Before you get excited, I
can't win this one because friends
and family of the judges are not el
igible to win any awards. Anyway,
this year's race was a landslide,
and surprisingly enough it was not
won by Glenn Dickey or Ray
Ratto. No, this year's SSC goes to
an outsider — an opinions writer.
While I swore I would not legit
imize his column by making any
reference to it, I feel it is a must to
single out James G. Wheaton for
his hilarious, yet chilling piece on
why the Department of Athletics
should be dropped.
I could spend hours writing on
why Wheaton's column was stu
pid, but if you read it, you know I
don't have to. The column was
nothing more than a waste of
space, and I feel that we are all
dumber having read it.
Well, that's it for my 1996
Sports Stupidity Awards. He sure
to watch for next year's install
ment. Until then, enjoy the sum
mer and remember . . . let's be
careful out there.
