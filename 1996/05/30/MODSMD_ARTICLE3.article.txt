# On the block, two programs eye extension
## Senate to consider one-year reprieve 
### Joanna Dickler Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate will vote
today on whether to grant exten
sions of degree-granting author
ity to the programs in Science,
Technology and Society and
East Asian Studies, both of
which are slated to stop granting
undergraduate degrees at the
end of next year.
In addition, a recommenda
tion to give degree-granting au
thority to the newly created De
partment of Engineering-Eco
nomic Systems and Operations
Research should cement the de
partment's status at today's
meeting.

The senate's Committee on
Undergraduate Studies has rec
ommended that East Asian
Studies and STS be allowed to
continue granting degrees until
1998. University administrators
and faculty decided earlier this
year that both undergraduate
majors would end in 1997.
The committee's recommen
dation also stipulates that no
student be able to declare a
major in East Asian Studies or
STS after the end of this quar
ter.
In effect, the one-year exten
sions, which would allow degrees
to be conferred in the programs
until Aug. 31, 1998, would pro
vide more time for discussion of
the programs' viability.
Regarding the committee's
recommendations for the two
endangered programs, Universi
ty Registrar Printup said, "I
think the much more controver
sial motion would have been to
close down both programs. I
would be surprised if somebody
objected to a more full discussion
of these issues.
"With East Asian Studies, it
was definitely the program itself
that wanted more time," Print
up said. "With STS, I think [the
committee's recommendation]
was more a result of all the Stan
ford and national publicity
about it and the recognition that
there are lots of students who
think this is an important pro
gram."
Acting STS Chair Robert
McGinn explained that the first
purpose of an extension would be
"to assure the people who are

currently declared as STS ma
jors that they will be able to
graduate on time by Aug. 31,
1998."
The second purpose, he said,
is to "give time, particularly for
Humanities and Sciences, to de
cide whether it wishes to accept
the STS program into the Hu
manities and Sciences school."
Though STS is currently
housed in the School of Engi
neering, it offers both a bachelor
of arts and a bachelor of science
and employs faculty from both
the Engineering and Humani
ties and Sciences Schools, in ad
dition to providing courses in
several disciplines.
While losing degree-granting
authority is not the death knell
of a program per se, McGinn
said, "the program as a program
would cease to exist." But, he
added, students would still be
able to complete honors or minor
in STS; they would just receive
their degree in something else.
History Prof. Peter Duus, di
rector of East Asian Studies,
said he views a potential exten
sion as an opportunity for "a sec
ond hearing."

"I think that the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies made
a very good and considerate deci
sion, and I hope that given time
for further reflection the deans
will see [the program] fills a
niche and serves a purpose,"
Duus said.
The committee has recom
mended that reconsideration of
East Asian Studies finish by the
end of fall quarter 1996. As far
as STS is concerned, Assoc.
Dean of the School of Engineer
ing John Bravman said he is not
sure when Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven will make a decision,
but predicts it will also be in the
fall.
The decision to let Engineer
ing-Economic Systems and Op
erations Research grant the
graduate degrees of master of
science, engineer and doctor of
philosophy should be a "no
brainer," said Printup, who
serves as an ex officio member
of the Committee on Graduate
Studies, which is making the
recommendation. The senate's
vote is required to allow new de
partments to give out degrees.
