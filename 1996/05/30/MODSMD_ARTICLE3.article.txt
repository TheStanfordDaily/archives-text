today on whether to grant exten
sions of degree-granting author
ity to the programs in Science,
Technology and Society and
East Asian Studies, both of
which are slated to stop granting
undergraduate degrees at the
end of next year.
In addition, a recommenda
tion to give degree-granting au
thority to the newly created De
partment of Engineering-Eco
nomic Systems and Operations
Research should cement the de
partment's status at today's
meeting.

The senate's Committee on
Undergraduate Studies has rec

Studies and STS be allowed to
continue granting degrees until
1998. University administrators
and faculty decided earlier this
year that both undergraduate
majors would end in 1997.
The committee's recommen
dation also stipulates that no
student be able to declare a
major in East Asian Studies or
STS after the end of this quar
ter.
In effect, the one-year exten
sions, which would allow degrees
to be conferred in the programs
