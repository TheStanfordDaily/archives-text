I made it to Sto
ryville— "a tradition
al ja// club" — up in
San Francisco last
week to see Roy I lar
grove, the renowned
trumpeter who ranks
highly with other

"young jazz. lions" of today (Christian
Mcßridc, Antonion Hart, Charlie Hunter).
The club — filled with a mix of older ja//
buffs still wearing beatnik attire, young mu
sicians carrying their horns on their backs,
bar hoppers just looking lor another place to
drink, important people yapping on their cell
phones while ordering New Orleans' style
catfish, insider types exchanging laughs and
handshakes with the performer — evoked a
scene which seemed almost uncanny in its
combination of authenticity and imitation.
That is, the experience, both pleasant and
weird, made me think about my attraction to
this music.
At Storyville, there were primarily three

different types ot jazz listeners: people who
grew up with «i jazz scene and had followed
their musical heros from hack-alley joints to
the swank clubs to chichi jazz festivals, peo
ple who had no clue as to what jazz sounded
like and people who had grown up with iazz
bv listening to the radio, borrowing records
from the library or buying ( I s at lower.
1 he differences in these experiences seem
significant while iazz grew out of a social
listening experience, ia/z is not defined In its
socialncss today. It seems difficult tor young
listeners to feel a part of any scene whit h ja/z,
in all of its history, has always moved and
moved with. In other words, I might have
physically been in the presence of a talented,
captivating and younger ja/z artist, yet I m
not too sure 1 belonged there or fit in. In fact,
I feel more comfortable with listening to a
random KZSU jazz program than I do sitting
at a night club.
While at Storyville, two women seated
next to me and my boyfriend did not keep
quiet or still. During one of the standards
which Roy Hargrove and his quartet per
formed, one of the women called out, Play
that pussy bass!" Here was an example of a
dialogue which was struck between the mu
sicians and the audience. 1 May that pussy
bass!" would not have come out of my
mouth, not for reasons of puritanism, but for
reasons of uneasiness over the setting. Sto

ryville may be a traditional jazz night club...
but it doesn t seem a placc that i might lre
quent.
J or this reason, I am more content to wax
romantic over the re-issues of past jazz artists
This is not to undermine the contributions
that these young artists, or any jazz musician
for that matter who continues to perform the
live circuit. I guess the complaint is simply
that I can buv a (.1) tor less money and listen
to it whenever I please. Iwentv live dollars
spent on a new musical item — or even bet
ter yet. borrowing from either a friend or a li
brar\ these strike me as activities closer to
my realm of social possibility. Its hard to sec
live music it you're only going to stress about
how much inone\ you've blown in one night.
It seems like record labels — both big and
small are aware of the potential market of
at-home-only ja/z listeners. Luv N
Haight / Übiquity, based in San Francisco,
rereleases '50s through '70s jazz artists who
otherwise would either remain in obscurity
or become an unattributed sample in a hip
hop or rock song. Ivan boogaloo Joe [ones,

Haight's latest contribution to re-recogni
tion ot neglected, smaller artists. 1 his album,
which was first put out on Joka Records in
1975, is an excellent example of jazz guitar
that wades deeply in a blues and dirty funky
tradition.

From the much bigger label, Impulse
Records, comes a series of re- issues this year
with .1 list that includes bigger name artists
Lester Young, Jelly Roll Morton, 1 red die
Hubbard, Coleman Hawkins, James Moody,
Duke Ellington, Johnny Hartman, I lia

whom plav with formidable sidemen, like
Elvin Jones and Milt Hinton, to mention a
few. Impulse's decision to focus on these re
issues (this accounts for approximately 1/3
of their scheduled jazz releases) reflects
their understanding of the jazz listener
more willing to stay at home than go out to
a club.
Perhaps, my shortsightedness or roman
ticization of the impact of jazz on American
history causes me to wonder about my at
home listening position. I envy those who
can rattle off stories of when they heard any
of the above mentioned, or other, artists re\
olutionized music. Yet, I also believe that
jazz musicians revolutionized the way music
was heard situational!}' — that is, not only
out of the austere setting of the classical con
cert hall and into the dance hall, as with
Duke Ellington and his big band, but also
out of the jazz "club"and into the jam house,
as with the avant garde be-boppers playing
for and amongst themselves . . . and even
perhaps out of the jam house and into the
