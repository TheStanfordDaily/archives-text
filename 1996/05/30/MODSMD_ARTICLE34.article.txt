# Playwright Cherrie Moraga

### 
is familia , For the Chicano community,
she is sister, daughter and mother, Sister, listening with
compassion to tales of injustice and struggle. Daughter,
connecting the elders with the world of the gringos. Final
ly, she is mother, giving birth to the plays - when the com
munity takes center stage.

Moraga's new plav, "Watsonville: Some
Place Not Here," is a fictionalized account ot
the cannery strikes that absorbed that coastal
farm town in the mid-'SOs. The locus is on a
group ot Mexican women workers who seem
to have everything working against them,
from an unsympathetic union to a Senate Hill
(modeled after real life's Prop. 187) that
threatens to divide the workers between illegal
and legal immigrants and break the bone ot
the movement.
As part of her research, Moraga sat down
with and interviewed a number ot residents ot
Watsonville — women workers who told her
tales of political awakening and empower
ment. Some ol the words she heard most often
in those interviews were "I woke up. Moraga
was impressed.
1 let these people come into my soul and
things came out," said Moraga, who used then
stories as a point of departure. Although the
plav is fictional, the women's spirit ot struggle
did make then way into the play. The main
character, I ucha (Minerva Ciarcia), is a com
posite from various women Moraga inter
viewed. And many ol the issues and concerns
of the women were explored in the writing.
"I think for me, particularly writing about
('hicanoor Mexican communities here in (Cal
ifornia, 1 find these towns to be like archetv p
al situations in which all ot the issues that are
affecting Mexicans and Chicanos can be crys
tallized as a microcosm ol a town, Moraga
said.
In "Watsonville," these issues include soli
darity among workers, the opposition of an
unfriendly political climate and the sense of
displacement in a country where (Chicanos .ire
not entirely welcome.
Moraga's previous play, the wildly ac
claimed "Heroes and Saints," also contained a
social element, examining cancer poisoning of
migrant farm workers in the town of Mcfar
land (McLaughlin in the play). 1 ler project tor
Stanford last year, "Circle in the Dirt," was
about East Palo Alto residents being forced out
of their homes.
For the East Palo Alto project, Moraga met
with a number of residents of that communi
ty, and she viewed more than 40 hours of
videotaped interviews. The play was part of a
larger attempt to empower the East Palo Alto
community and give voice to a largely illiterate
population who in many cases couldn't speak
for itself.
In her playwriting class at Stanford, a cozy
affair where a group ot nine or so grads and
undergrads listen and learn in a workshop at
mosphere, Moraga talks about the function of
the artist.
She emphasizes how important it is to

bring center stage the heroes who perform
amazing deeds ot survival but never get a
chance to take a bow. She cites the women of
Watsonville as an example, workers who
"came crawling on their bellies, and became
liberated through the strike."
I hev organized, faced up to the uncaring
managers and found themselves speaking up
at city council meetings, according to Moraga.
"Watsonville" is Moraga's way to celebrate and
spotlight these acts of heroism and awakening.
"This plav gives these women the recogni
tion for the struggle tiiev had gone through
and the hard work they went through tor
years," said actor lesns Mendoza (who plays
luan, a former priest and strike organizer) in a
round table discussion of the play last week.
Mendoza thanked Moraga for telling the
"beautiful story of the spirit ot Watson.
1 )aughtcr of a factorv worker and a railroad
switchman at a Santa 1 e station, Moraga grew
up in a household where art was not a given.'
She was the first in her family history to go to
college and get an education. It is no coinci
dence, therefore, tli.it Moraga sees it as the job
of "us - the first generation to have access to
the writing of literature and the telling ot sto
nes —to make sure "oui people's stories get
told. In that sense, Moraga is historian and
journalist, documenting the histories ot the
(Tiicano and Mexican communities.
In "Watsonville," the boy )o)o (Peter
(iomez) carries around a notepad and records
the words of illiterate, elderly Dolores (Lee
(iarav Toney). In the process, he translates this
immigrant woman's culture into the Ameri
can one, and serves as a bridge between the
Mexican / Chicano and the dominant com
munity. Moraga does the same through her
plays.
Hut "Watsonville," like other powerful
strike stories (Zola's "Germinal" and Stein
beck's "Crapes of Wrath" come to mind), is in
terested in more than just social causes. "Wat
sonville" uses the strike as a point ofdeparture
to delve deep into the psychological, sexual
and religious life of the Mexican / Chicano
community.
"Being a poet, I 'm interested in very private
moments," said Moraga, who recently pub
lished a collection of poems and essays. "There
are moments in the plav that are very intimate,
moments of sexual and spiritual awakening
that tend to be very privatized. Hut what I try
to do is make them happen with collective re
verberation and collective response."
"Watsonville," which is a thematic sequel to
1992's "Heroes and Saints," continues Mora
ga's efforts to reveal the complexity of people's
lives while dealing with "multiplicity in is
sues."

"It's very difficult to do that in a dominant
culture that says that plays should be about
one thing, one issue, and the play should solve
that and it's over," said Moraga. "My plays al
ways have a kind of layering, and 'Watsonville'
is another effort to do that in a grander scale."
The scale of her vision means that her plays
present the Chicano community through a
fond yet often critical looking glass.
"Cherrie is looking at the skeletons in the
closet, and the darker side of living in this
country as experienced by Chicana women,"
said actress Alma Martinez, a graduate stu
dent in the Drama Department.
At a staged reading of Moraga's "Shadow
of a Man," which Martinez would go on to
act in, Martinez remembers thinking that
Moraga was saying things that she had never
heard before. As a Latino woman, Martinez
was impressed by Moraga's treatment of the
complexities of growing up in a Chicano en
vironment and getting caught between a
Mexican culture and a new country, the
United States.
"There is so much potential in the stories of
people of color, and gay and lesbian people,
and in the stories of all our diverging classes,"
said Moraga. "There is so much material and

so much drama, tragedy and incredible stories
of resistance, and passion."
But despite her impact in the Chicano
community, Moraga is still not satisfied. Like
any proud mother, she wants la familia to
move centerstage and see the plays performed
for mainstream audiences. Although many of
Moraga's plays have won awards and are
taught at universities, she, like many other
women of color, has yet to hit Broadway.
"Things in America have changed, but the
ater hasn't caught up with that," said Moraga.
"In my dream world, it would have that diver
sity."
But if the theater won't come into the com
munity, then maybe Moraga will just have to
bring the community to the theater.
