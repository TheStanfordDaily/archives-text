Writer Ed McClanahan is a self-de
scribed "man who came to ainner."
A dropout of the Stanford English Ph.D. program,, Mc-
Clanahan was a Stegner Fellow from 1962-64, and a
Merry Prankster for life. He stayed on at Stanford as
a visiting lecturer for nine years following his fel
lowship. In 1990 he returned to campus for Ken Kesey's
reunion tour. And now he's coming back to read from
his newly published collection of stories.

Originally from Kentucky, McClanahan
began his Stanford career as a "rebel without
a cause." Having seen the movie in 1955 in
San Francisco, McClanahan adopted the
"goatee, Levi's jacket and shades." Flunking
his masters orals due to too much time lis
tening to the jazz radio station, McClanahan
moved to Kentucky only to return to Stan
ford on a Stegner Fellowship for writing on
the strength of his manuscript "The Natural
Man."
After the Fellowship ended, McClanahan
was asked to stay on as a visiting lecturer, and
had the satisfaction of confronting the same
chair of the English department who had
asked him to drop out of the program sever
al years earlier. McClanahan claims he'll
never forget "when Mr. Stegner introduced
me as the young man who was going to be the
visiting lecturer. They say every dog has his
day, well, this was mine."
A verbose man with a strong southern ac
cent, McClanahan paints a vivid picture ot
Stanford in the '60s. "I was doing all that hip
pic stuff, living close to Ferry Lane. It was a
magical time, a great time." Even after friend
and fellow Prankster Ken Kesey "got busted
again and fled to Mexico," Stanford and Palo
Alto continued to be a source of inspiration
to the writer.
In fact, the University spawned a move
ment concurrent to the anti-war sentiment
brewing in the late 60s. McClanahan and
friends created the "Free University" or "The
Free-U." "The idea behind the Free-U was
that there was power in the possession of
knowledge. The faculty and student body
forgot that there was a community around
them that was totally deprived ol it because
they couldn't afford a Stanford education."
(Charging only $ 10 to enroll, McClanahan
began to teach classes to the community at
large, printing up a course catalog that taught
classes such as "How to Enjoy Psychedelics,"
"Revolution 201" and other "touchy-feely
courses." McClanahan himself taught these
courses wearing a floor-length hooded red
velvet robe.
As time progressed, the course catalog
turned into a magazine, "with the sole edito
rial policy that we didn't turn down anything
— everything that was submitted was pub
lished." Titled "The Free-You," the magazine
provided McClanahan with "an audience for
me to try out my voice in a lot of imaginative
nonfiction. I began to generate a voice for
myself." One piece, "Famous People I Have
Known," the source for a later novel of the
same title, was subsequently published in
"Esquire."
It is the atmosphere surrounding him,
McClanahan suggests, that provides him
with the ideas for his novels. As far as Stan
ford is concerned, "It was such a good time,
despite the war in Vietnam. People may have
showed up to oppose the war, but they stayed
because there was a good band playing."

McClanahan's "hippie" image and ideolo
gy was unique to California, however, and
often provoked violent reactions elsewhere.
When on vacation in his hometown in Ken
tucky, McClanahan remembers walking into
a liar in his "hippie finery. It wasn't such a
good idea." Of course, a fight ensued, and
McClanahan's hide was saved only because
he was recognized by a long-lost friend. Not
long after that encounter, his office in Palo
Alto was broken into by "three outrageous
little hippies." When McClanahan tracked
them down, they apologized: "We never
would have ripped you otl il we'd known you
were such a hip dude."
" That became my task," Mc("lanahan says,
"bridging the gap between the two sides."
The characters that form part of the bridge
that is "A Congress of Wonders" are an as
sembly ot the strange, the deformed and the
just plain stupid. McClanahan takes his
strange cast from real-life characters such as
the original Elvis impersonator from his
youth, and the man with two noses from his
hometown. The latter becomes a character in
"A Congress of Wonders."
The link between the three stories is their
common setting in the town of Needmore,
Kentucky during the Second World War and
the charlatan Cosmo Rexroat, IVS., M.S.,
"Pee Aitch Dee" whose bogus carnival does
provide entertainment, solace and support
for the freaks of Kentucky.
Rexroat provides humor as well. Mc-
Clanahan has mastered southern dialect and
his narrators are simultaneously erudite and
educated while provincial and lacking sell
awareness.
Carnival worker Wanda Pearl wakes up
the hermaphrodite in the carnival: "I wen .it
its full height, she towers over this malodor
ous apparition, and she can feel those up
turned mendicant eyes upon her face, be
seeching her for what she cannot bring her
self to give it, the merest touch of a human
hand.... My sweet Jesus Christ on a crutch,
Wanda Pearl says to herself as she mounts the
steps to the trailer. If I had some ham I'd fix it
ham and eggs, if I had any eggs."
McClanahan renames his "magical real
ism" techniques "coincidence." "Once, I
couldn't think of any name for a $2 prosti
tute, so I went down [in Kentucky] to ask the
boys." Their answer: a "flatback." Ihe term
immediately found its way into his fiction.
" The atmosphere is always busy with the
possibility of remarkable coincidence. If
you're open to it, attune to it, it II happen all
the time. And that's magic, that's mysteri
ous."
