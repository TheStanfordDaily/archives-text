( I is because I'm bald and 1 have no chin
I and when I sing I look absolutely and
I utterly awful."
Singer / songwriter Mark Fit/el is un
mistakably bitter. From his decade fronting
the American Music Club to his new solo
release, Eitzel's work has always been
marked with a certain melancholy border
ing on torment, always on the brink of giv
ing up.
"I think that's really what it comes down

to, he says, jokingly ex
plaining his unhappiness.
"I look terrible when 1
sing. I ve seen pictures and
it's not pretty. You know,
I'm busy thinking about
laundry and about my un
derwear riding up, you
know, stuff like that. And
I'm singing these songs,
and I see pictures and I'm
like, 'Oh my God, 112 look
like I in about to die.' So it's
because I'm balding and 1
have 110 chin. And I have a
potbelly now."
Months after a tour
opening for Everything
Hut the Girl (which
"stunk,'' he.says, "because
their crowd is a bunch of
molderingold yuppies and
I hated them all") and
weeks alter a solo headlin
ing tour (which also
"stunk"), Eit/el is back in
his hometown of San
Francisco and in a surpris
ingly good mood.
He tells me that this is
"like the 12th interview
today,' yet he remains lik
ablv chatty — frequently
apologizing to me for
"babbling," and occasion
ally cracking jokes that 1
don't quite get. He re

sponils with polite "I really don't give a
to questions relating his music to
anyone but himself, and he makes it clear
that he's enjoying the freedom to make
whatever kind of music he feels like mak -
ing.
"Without a full rock hand and without
the legacy of American Music ( lub, 1 basi
cally can do whatever I want," he says. "1
don't have to arrange it for pedal steel, elec
tric guitar, electric bass and drums. I can
arrange it for whatever kind of instrumen
tation I think the song needs, and I like
that."
With a moody ja/./ feel replacing the
American Music Club's more straightfor
ward rock approach, Eitzels first solo stu
dio album, *60 Watt Silver Lining," released

by Warner Bros. Records, explores softer
textures. For the first time in years, Fitzel's
songs of despair have found an appropri
ately desolate setting, stripped of any sort
of instrumental flashiness that might get in
the way of his feeling. Commercial suicide,
maybe, but compelling nonetheless.
"They're quieter," Eitxel says of the mu
sicians who played on his new album. "I
don't have a big, loud electric guitar to
compete with .... It's a lot simpler to sing

and play.
"I'm never going to make it on the post-
Nirvana / grunge / indie-rock / MTV / suc
cess-oriented / rock-and-roll stage. So this
is sort of an anti-indie-rock record in a way,
so 1 could just state the theme that I'm not
gonna rock out. And so I'm not gonna."
Originally from Walnut Creek, Calif.,
Hit7el describes his childhood as
that of an "army brat," growing up
in Taiwan and England before moving to
Ohio and finally to San Francisco. While he
began writing songs at the age of 14, he
never really planned to make a living as a
musician.
"I wanted to be an architect all through
high school, and I also wanted to be 1 larold

Pinter," he explains. "And neither of those
worked out very well because I was terrible
at mathematics and because I had to leave
England because I flunked out of high
school.
"Basically, 1 resisted writing songs forev
er because I thought it was beneath me," he
continues. "So here I am. Songwriter. Fail
ure."
Eitzel played briefly with a few bands in
Columbus, Ohio, and in San Francisco, be

fore finally form
ing the American
Music Club in
1983. Consisting
of I.it/el, guitarist
Vudi, bassist Dan
Pearson and a re
volving cast of
drummers and
pedal steel / key
board players, the
American Music
Club made seven
well-received al
bums, highlight
ed by Fit/el's
thoughtful lyrics
and expressive
delivery.
"What happens
to the rat that
stops running the
maze," Eitzel won
dered on 1993's
"Mercury." "The
doctors think it's
dumb when it's
just disappoint
ed. Fit/el's other
work investigated
this disappoint
ment with fasci
nating depth. The
minor hit "Wish
the World Away"
summed up
Fit/.el's tone ad

mirably: "I don't need anyone's love / I
couldn't afford it anvwav / With rriv penny's
worth of hope / It's not funny but it's a joke."
"Most of my good writing is done when
I'm at home with absolutely nothing else to
do," Fit/el says. "Whenever 1 come home
from tours, after a few months I start mak
ing friends again and start hanging out.
That's always good.
"When I'm on the road, I basically make
lists of titles of songs that 1 want to do, and
then 1 try to work out what the song is from
the title," he continues. "I never really do
anything good on the road. It's usually just
like, 'I'm so tired.' That's how they always
start. 'I'm so tired.' "
1 it/el's unique talent did not go unno
ticed: The group's "Everclear" album

'Basically, I resisted writing
songs forever because I
thought it was be neath me. So
here I am. Sonowriter. Failure.'

earned Eitzel the "best Songwriter" award
in the 1991 Rolling Stone Critics' Poll, ami
1993's "Mercury" turned up on Spin mag
azines best-of-the-year list. Yet such flat
tering press didn't translate to record sales,
and the American Music Club struggled
commercially.
"Critical acclaim is a chimera: It doesn't
really exist in the real world,' hit/el says.
"It's nice to get, and 1 really love it — you
know that I'm an egotistical prick. But it
doesn't really exist in the real world, i don't
know what it means exactly, because I've
gotten a lot of it, and nobody's ever bought
my records.
"With AMC, that's about the only kind
of success we ever had, and I don't want to
base my life on that kind of success," he
continues. "The worst thing you can call
me now is 'critics' darling.' It makes me
sick."
It was the American Music Club's failure
to break big that forced the group to break
up last year. The big hit that seemed right
around the corner never came, and ulti
mately the group ran out of money. "We
were broke," Eitzel says. "So that was it, re
ally. It was sort of time to say, 'OK, that's
enough of that.' "
Appropriately, the group's last single,
"Hello Amsterdam," laughably complains
that "they didn't even like us when we
played 'Dancing Queen,' " before lading
away with embittered chants of "Superstar
superstar superstar."
( I t was really hard not being in Ameri-
I can Music Club," Hitzel recalls. "I
I mean, I was in bed the whole month
of December and most of January, and I
was too depressed to leave the house, really.
I get like that sometimes."
Undoubtedly, miiih nt this tW-lini?

found its way onto Hit/.el's solo work. "60
Watt Silver l ining" is characteristically lonely
and bleak, with both the music and the words
evoking a smoky bar room atmosphere — an
I. it/.el trademark.
Within the slow, dragging verses of "Some
Bartenders I lave the Gift of Pardon," Hit/el
observes: "A bar has a longer history than a
country / What keeps the moon chained are
ridiculous acts of faith / And after a couple ol
drinks, visionary eyes .ill burn / Drunks seem
saint like in their disillusion.''
"Well, I'm a drunk," Eitzel says. "Basically
that's it. 1 like to drink. I like to hangout in
bars. I like people who hangout in bars. I like
the kind ol give and take, and 1 like the kind ol
noise.... I like when people are noisy."
l itzel once wrote that bars are places
where people "think they reach their high
est highs and highest lows," and "60 Watt
Silver I ining" has a stirring take on the
lows. "All his life was a gesture," Eitzel sings
on "Wild Sea." "A check paid and dirty dish
es / Listen to the sea wind, hear how it hiss
es I As it rolls over your ail your vain pettv
wishes / And your sweet passionate kisses.
But even at his worst, Eitzel remains
painfully aware, "There's always more ties
you can sever."
After completing "60 Watt Silver Hin
ing," Eitzel was unsure about how the
album would be received, mainly because it
seemed "too smooth-sounding."
"I was like, 'Wow, this sounds so smooth.
I'his sounds really nice.' And 1 was kind ol
afraid of it, because I didn't expect it to do
that," he says."I didn't realize that tins i.s
what it takes to make this kind of record.
While thoroughly pleasant and undeni
ably brilliant at times, the album is sure to
come as a shock to many fans. In a recent
story, BAM magazine sent out somethingol
a warning to its readers regarding the sur

prising "adult-contemporary" nature of the
songs.
"I'm not really worried about labels,'"
Fit/el says."I just like music that's exciting.
1 don't care who buys it or who listens to it.
ff you're going to like my music, you're

going to like it as a teen
as much as you're going
to like it as an adult.
You're going to get the
same thing that's in it
out of it.
"It can be called
adult contemporary if
you want," he contin
ues. "It can be called
miserable manic-de
pressive whining il you
want, i really don't give
a shit. I just do what I
do."
And this is just what
makes "60 Watt Silver
I in ing" unique: Hit/el
does what he does
rather than filtering it
through a rock band.
"I'm pleased with [the
record| in certain
ways," he says."It took
a lot less money to
make, and i'm happy
about that. And I'm
proud that I produced
it and arranged it and
came up with all the
parts myself. I had to
prove that I could do it,
and I think 1 proved it.
I don't think I made the
best record ol m\ life.
But I will one day."
Eil/el already has
three albums
planned tor the
near future. I le plans to
record a solo acoustic
album this summer tor
Matador Records, after
which he'll do an
album on "weird in
struments" that will
probabiv never be re
leased commercially.
Finally, in December or
January, he'll do anoth
er record for Warner
Bros.
Eitzel anticipates
the inevitable backlash
that awaits any per
former who ditches an
old cult band to launch
a solo career (see 1 rank
Black. 1 ou Reed, Paul

Westerberg, etc.). but he doesn't feel any
need to respond to the expectations of fans
or critics. "I haven't read any reviews," he
says. "I've intentionally avoided them
We'll see how many people hate [the new
record]. We'll see how many people say,

'Where's Vudi? Where's Danny?' If they do,
I'll say, 'Fuck off.'
"It sounds like I really love my music,'' he
later savs apologetically. "1 sound like a real
self- mportant creep, so I'm sorry. I guess ba
sically, what I'm trying to say is '1 don't care.'"
