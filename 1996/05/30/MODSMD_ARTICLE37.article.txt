## GRETA This Is Greta! 
### 
lust think, a cross between Metallica and
Green Day, what kind of sound would that
be? Answer: the music produced by Greta in
their new album "This Is Greta!"
But their style is a little more complex
than that. In "Some People," the group
sounds a little Nirvana-esque, complete with
brooding, angst-filled vocals and repetitive
usage of a couple notes to compose the
music.
In "Gal Cool," the chameleon-like Greta
take on the visage of the apathetic Nine
Inch Nails with guitarist Paul Plagens
crooning "You're so whatever to me," and
"To feel like an anomaly / Like me" in
"Anomaly." This attitude contradicts the
mood of other songs, such as "Silver Blue,'
a chipper song with spacy vocals and an up
beat pop feel.
What next? Death Metal? No, not quite.
There is more industrial rock fading into
synthesized vocals and intense instrumen
tals. But isn't that what industrial rock is
Green Day blended with Metallica? But
Greta don't quite fit into this category.
Just listening to the album, I wouldn't say
that the music and lyrics are pure crap, be
cause they're not. The music is decent and
the lyrics are kind of understandable. But
there's something that's missing from (Ireta.
Genius. Originality. Yes, that's it. It seems
that the band tries so hard to be different
that they only end up sounding like a bunch
of other bands. This isn't necessarily bad it
you like those other bands, but doesn't give
Greta much credit for cultivating their own
style. Greta's type of music — we've all
heard before especially in this age tit al
terna-rock where angry male and / or fe
male singers with electric guitars share their
angst with the world via the airwaves.
In short, "This Is (ireta!" is nothing to get
excited over.
