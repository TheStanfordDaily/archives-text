# MOLOKO
## 
### 
The Korova Milkbar was a milk-plus
mesto .... They had 110 license for selling
liquor, but there was no law yet against prod
ding some of the new veshches which they
used to put into the old moloko, so you could
peet it with vellocet or synthemesc or dren
crom or one or two other veshches which
would give you a nice quick horrorshow 15
minutes...
—"A Clockwork Orange"
I ike the prepubescent club grrrl sound of
Bjork, Portishead and Deee-lite, Moloko
continue the trend of trip-pop 011 their new
album "Do you like my tight sweater?" The
duo of Mark Brvdon and Roisin Murphy
picks and chooses from computerized music
candy of the last 15 years and rides a fine line
of tasteless imagination and kitsch-loving
fun.
With their paws in '80s dance pop, jungle,
techno, happy house and acid ja/z, Moloko
jump around from musical style with ques
tionable, impressive force. Roisin Murphy
registers deliberately cute vocals that float
between sultry and girlish. This occasionally
overpowers the bass of Mark Brvdon which
amusingly laps up the rhythms ol the musi
cal mixes throughout the album. Compared
to the impishness of Bjork, the ethereality in
Portishead or the kitten in Deee-lite,
Moloko'strip pop sound is imprecise enough
to conceal the group's lull kitsch potential.
Atrocious lyrics abound in "Do you like my
tight sweater?" and most clearly stem the
group's residual effects. With lyrics like "I am
the doughnut that you hold and I never sold
up in a pie" in"I can't help myself;" "Sniveling
little bunny bouncing up and down scummy
little creatures run them out of town," from
"Killa Bunnie" and "Brains like pickles she slip
she slide's [sic| she don't know why," in "Lotus
Laters," Moloko caters to a space cadet men
tality and tries to convince us that I lello-Kitty
and Tuxedo Sam are pop-culture heroes and
thai we should shop at Kids-R-Us.

Considering the associations which tin
word "moloko" conjures up ("milk" in tin
Russian lingo used by Alex from "A Clock
work Orange"), it is disappointing that tlii
trip-pop group did not produce somethinj
more twisted, more cultishly kitsch.
