## Everything I Long For 
### 
A Tribe Called Quest once lyrically insin
uated that record execs smoke crack, and the
fact that Canada's Hayden inspired a heated
bidding war based on the strength of
"Everything I Long For," his debut album,
certainly does nothing to undermine the as
sertion.
A pathetic, uninspired cliche of an
album, "Everything I Long For" is marked
by two extremes: at times Hayden tries des
perately (and unsuccessfully) to sound like
Beck, while at others he sounds uninten
tionally (and unfortunately) like Adam San
dler. It's true that lack of a technically good
voice can occasionally be endearing (Bob
Dylan, Stephen Malkmus), or even interest
ing (Tom Waits, Courtney Love), but in
Hayden's case, it's just annoying.
Equally annoying are Hayden's lyrics,
which reveal an idiotic fondness for string
ing together images and then over-com
menting on them ("Car crash-highway
tragedy," for example), using clumsy inver
sions solely for the sake of rhyme ("My par
ents house I'll stay for free/Until I'm at
least 43"), and employing incredibly dorky
symbolism ("The Stem" is roughly about a
rose that loses all its petals in the wind, for
pete's sake). Then there's the subject matter,
influenced largely by stereotypes of the so
called Generation X. "Why do I sleep in so

late? Hayden asks in Lounging, before
musing "I wish sleeping wasn't so great."
Sure, a lot of this is meant to be humor
ous; and sure, a lot of this is quick, otf the
cuff music, recorded on a four-track only a
few hours after it was written. Some of it
even works, such as the controlled frenzy ot
"In September," in which Hayden tackles
the demise of a long distance relationship
with wit and understatement.
But now that 10-fi music is precariously
close to infiltrating the mainstream (Guid
ed by Voices, Sebadoh, Pavement), it is im
portant to remember that there is a differ
ence between art and self-indulgence. Hay
den's half-baked folk rock is decidedly latter.
"Take your records away / I hate folk," he
ironically croaks halfway through the
heavy-handed histrionics of "You Were
Loved." By the album's conclusion, one
couldn't agree more.
