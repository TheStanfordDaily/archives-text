# URO winners are many splendored
## 175 students hit research jackpot

Dance performances, photogra
phy exhibits, short stories and ar
chitectural studies were among
the projects which won Under
graduate Research Opportunities
Major Grants this year.
The 1996 recipients met yester
day with their advisers and spon
sors in a reception to congratulate
each another and share their re
search endeavors.
"I'm very inspired by the imag
ination and the combination of
subjects, how people are pulling
together their interests," said
Lynn Mitchell, one of the URO
program's financial sponsors.
Mitchell plans to meet again
with some of the students she met
yesterday to hear about their re
search projects. "It's a payback to

me to come back here and . . . in
teract with and hear the ideas of
our future leaders," she said.
Of the 333 applicants for major
and minor grants this year, 175
students were selected as major
grant recipients to receive funding
for their research programs. Major
grants can amount to as much as
$2,500.
A number of students won
minor grants, which offer up to
$500. Only 66 proposals were de
nied funding.
"Stanford's really at the fore
front of involving undergraduates
in research projects so that they're
not just passive recipients of
knowledge, but active creators of
knowledge as well," said Kathy
Veit, assistant director for stew
ardship in the School of Humani
ties and Sciences. "I think it's a
wonderful opportunity for stu
dents to come up with a project of
their own, develop their ideas,
work . . . with a faculty member,
then go out and carry it out."
The research proposals of the
grant recipients — most of whom
hope to turn their research into
senior honors theses — cover a
wide range of disciplines and in
terests, from the humanities and
social sciences to the natural sci
ences and engineering.
Junior Baochi Nguyen, an Eng
lish major, said she plans to use
her grant to research the role of
Vietnamese women in Viet
namese society and to "dispel the
Western myth of Asian women
being meek and subservient."
Nguyen will be in Vietnam for
six weeks this summer. She plans
to turn her research, which will
mostly consist of interviews with
women in her family, into a collec

tion of short stories titled, "From
the Family to the World: Eight
Vietnamese Women and their
Short Stories."
"What I'll be conveying is how
these women are strong in their
different roles, whether some
thing respectable — lawyer, doc
tor — or a fisherman's wife,"
Nguyen said.
Marcos Diaz Gonzalez, a junior
studying architecture and urban
design, said he will use his grant to
do research in Madrid on an urban
designer named Arturo Soria Y
Mata, who invented the "linear
city."
"His work has never been
translated into English," Gonza
lez said. "I'm going to do research,
compare his work with the work of
other architects and planners . . .
and try to give him some credit for
ideas that have been taken or bor
rowed from him by many other
Utopian urban planners."
Junior Kevin Haninger said he
will be working on an interdiscipli
nary project on ethical decision
making and breast cancer.
I laninger said his grant will en

able him to stay on campus this
summer to do research and to in
terview breast cancer patients and
their doctors. His research will
look into the "styles of doctor-pa
tient relationships [that) facilitate
ethical decision making."
"I don't feel like there's enough
work done on the types of doctor
patient relationships that are most
ethical when women are undergo
ing treatment for metastatic
breast cancer," Haninger said.
URO Director Laura Selznick
said that while the program has
been growingevery year, the quali
ty of applicants has also been in
creasing.
"Students are developing a cul
ture of understanding what re
search is and learning how to ask
good questions," Selznick said.
"A lot of people think that edu
cation means learning the right an
swers, but I think what's special
about undergraduate education is
that sometimes the questions are
more important than the answers,
because it's the questions that de
fine where you look and what you'll
be able to find," she said.

Melvin Lane, a URO sponsor,
said "it's been a very satisfying ex
perience to talk to the students and
seeing their enthusiasm for what
they're doing. It's pleasing to us to
see what a small grant can do to
help them do these research pro
jects. "
Selznick told the recipients of a
comment that URO sponsor Peter
Bing, a Stanford alumnus, had said
to her: "1 have the easy job — I
wrote t he check. You have to spend
it." In the same way, Selznick said
she had the easy job of giving out
the grants. To the recipients, she
said, "You have the hard job of fol
lowing through and carrying out
the work you proposed."
The fruits of past research en
deavors were seen yesterday. Prof.
Robert McGinn, acting chair of the
STS program, attended the recep
tion with a stack of honors theses
to read. Many were the work of last
year's URO grant recipients.
"I think it's a fabulous opportu
nity for people to do a piece of orig
inal research as an intellectual cap
stone for their undergraduate edu
cation," McGinn said.
