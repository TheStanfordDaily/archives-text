## FISHBONE Chim Chim's Badass Revenge 
### 
Fishbone has produced such a wide vari
ety of songs that it's hard to know what ex
actly to expect from them. Their latest
album, "Chim Chim's Badass Revenge," con
tinues to add mystery to the group's style.
The songs on this album range from slow
funk to fast ska to angry punk. Even the vo
cals varv on the album, from soft group har
monies to harsh chants. It's almost as it each
song belongs in a category of its own.
One thing that is characteristic of Fish
bone is their sense of humor, which comes
through on this album as usual. Songs such
as "Bcergut" and "Alcoholic" humorously
describe the type of people that we all know
("My friend yousta be thin / He'd get all the
women / We'd go kick it at the bar / But his
drinkin' went too tar" from "Beergut").
Then there's off-color songs like "Monkey
Dick" which need no explanation.
Fishbone is also known for commenting
on racism, and the song "Rock Star" on this
album does exactly that. Over thrashy music,
the words "Color meant nothing to
me / Everything was equal as tar as I could
see / Ignorant to the racist music industry"
let the serious side of Fishbone come
through.
The music on this album is fairly experi
mental. You won't find your traditional
funk, ska or punk riffs here. The guitars
range from effect-filled funk sounds to ex
tremely raw punk sounds. Some of the songs
feature horns, but not your traditional horn
licks. Everything on this album has its own
unique flavor.
While the album is well done and indeed
original, one might say that it tries too hard
to avoid cliches. It's experimental attitude
will probably turn off a lot of listeners. But it
you give it a chance and really listen, you
might begin to appreciate what Fishbone has
attempted to do with this album. It exempli
fies what makes Fishbone such a non-main
stream success.
