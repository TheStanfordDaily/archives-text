# TALULAH GOSH
## Backwash 
### 
When a band uses its name in a song, the
message can vary. Whether the 1 )ogg Pound is
responding to the musical question "What's
my name, fool?" by crooning "Snoop Doggy
Do-o-o-o-og," or Wang Chung is suggesting
that "everybody have fun tonight / everybody
Wang Chung tonight," the result is often a Ivri
cal self-portrait which gives special insight
into how a band sees itself. While a band's en
tire oeuvrc produces its particular artistic
identity, these self-titled songs manufacture
identity in a more direct way.
It was with glee, then, that 1 discovered the
song "Talulah Cosh" on "Backwash" (in fact,
there are not one but two versions of it 011 the
album). Appropriately enough for this group
of friends from quiet Oxford, England, the
song is about a boring life and pop star
dreams. Well, even if, as in the song, their
dreams of celebrity never completely materi
alized in their short (1956-88) incarnation, at
least they managed to record some great pop
songs that have pleased listeners and influ
enced another wave of pop wonders, includ
ing such favorites as Tiger Trap and Comet
Gain.
After the band's break up in the late '80s,
most of the members went on to form the
aptly-named Heavenly, and in this new en
semble they continue their celebration of pop
piness in songs about the realities of a lite tilled
with dreams of cinema stars. Lacking the pol
ish they now achieve as the more experienced
Heavenly, though, Talulah Gosh showed some
rough edges then that .ire all the more charm
ing today.
Talulah Gosh are great: sounding sha-la-la
cheerful and singing lyrics like "get off of m\
case / or else I'm going to break your face," they
don't take themselves very seriously but still
manage to hang together like the best '60s girl
group / punk rock band there ever was. And
thanks to this reissue on k Records, a lot more
people now will have the opportunity to hear
their music. On this collection you can hear
every song Talulah Gosh ever released, with a
few live tracks thrown in, too. It's enough to get
you to start using the word "dreamy" more
often in everyday conversation.
