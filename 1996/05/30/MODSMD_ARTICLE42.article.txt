# CRUMB
## Romance is a Slow Dance 
### 
A month ago, I took a trip to the Fillmore in
San Francisco to see one of my favorite local
bands, Her Majesty the Baby. Also on the pro
gram that night was a little-known band called
Crumb, who pushed their new CD, "Romance
is a Slowdance" the entire night.
Truthfully, they were not very impressive.
Their lead singer, Robby Cronholm, had a very
limited melodic and rhythmic vocabulary,
forcing the band into the all-too-pervasive al
ternative stereotype of a pretentious whiner
backed by blurred guitar and crashing drums.
However, their guitarist, Mark Weinberg, dis
played impressive signs ot both charisma and

musical intelligence, suggesting a promising
future.
"Romance is a Slowdance" emphasizes the
startling difference between a live performance
and a studio album. Buoyed by strong inter
play between lead guitar and bass, the album
displays a redeeming pop lilt.
On the best tracks, such as "Kid Klone" and
"Shoegazer," Crumb simply execute a tradi
tional form, alternatively melodic and power
ful guitar with punchy rhythms, with success
ful results.
A few songs even step beyond. "Shards &
Tweeters' " enchanting introduction prepares
the listeners for a hypnotic and rewarding
song.
The album's best track, "Celebrity Judges,"
is nothing less than a great rocker. 1 land-claps
give the song a perfect cathartic element, pro
viding a physical release at iust the right mo
ment. That something so simple could work so
well is indeed remarkable.
However, the group's vocals are still prob
lematic, even on this studio album. Cronholm
often seems lost melodically, as if he is some
how singing the wrong song.
I have a feeling that this fault may stem from
a misguided desire to be "alternative" to match
todav's market. At the Fillmore concert, the
band performed Cutis N Roses classic '80s
rocker "It's So Easy" as a "special treat," and
one band member reminisced about his first
trip to the Fillmore to see none other than W ar
rant.
Many of today's "alternative" rockers grev\
up not on Neil Young and REM, but on Del
I.eppard and Bon lovi. The excesses ot the '80s,
however, are today quite out ot fashion, and
bands like (rumb seem to scramble to become
sufficiently "artsy." The album packaging fea
tures grungy hair, plenty of polyester and the
always obligatory lead-singer-holding-a
toothbrush photo.
My question is how does one go from seeing
Warrant at the Fillmore to naming a song
"Mrs. Yellowftlterfinger & Mr. Pious?" It
today's alternative world truly celebrated indi
vidualism, bands like Crumb wouldn't have to
conform.
Unfortunately for both them and us, such is
not the case.
