# JEAN-YVES THIBAUDET
## Themes and Variation 
### 
Cleverly coupled on one disc,
Brahms' "Paganini Variations"
and Schumann's "Symphonic
Etudes" reveal how great com
posers turn a simple line of
motif into a myriad of varia
tions. Asked why he chose such a
coupling, Thibaudet was quick
to point out the great liberty
Schumann took with his varia
tions, a liberty which, unfortu
nately, one fails to detect in his
playing.
Few pianists these days have
the daring to tackle Brahms'
"Paganini Variations" on stage.
Thibaudet's foray into this for
midable piece shows his solid
technique and his determina
tion to probe the deeper musi-

cality under the shield of virtuosity. On the
whole, he opts for moderate tempo and clear
articulation, bringing every note to the fore.
Thibaudet appears well-equipped to jump
technical hurdles everywhere in the piece,
only stumbling on the octave glissandi in
Var. 13 of Book One (Track 14). His playing,
though solid, is devoid of caprice and
humor, not to mention the utter absence of
tonal palette so crucial to making the piece
tick. On the contrary, Shura Cherkassky's
rendition on Nimbus is so full of juicy whims
and twists that one is captivated by the rich
music ideas, not the grueling difficulties, in
the score.
Similarly, Thibaudet s Schumann suffers
from lack of color and imagination, with
out which the search for the Eusebius and
Florestan sides of Schumann becomes a fu
tile journey. The entire piece degenerates
into a vastly monochromic picture under
Thibaudet's fingers, rather than a set of lit
tle jewels glittering with individual charm
and character. Thibaudet seems deter
mined to steer clear of adding his personal
touch to what he plays. The result is a ho
mogenized and at times vacuous interpre
tation so common among today's young pi
anists. When the cleanliness of execution
takes precedence over the projection of mu
sical ideas, these "Symphonic Etudes" liter
alb' become technical regimen and lose all
the musicality Schumann held so dear in his
writing.
Moreover, the placement of the five addi
tional variations (posthumously published
in 1873) is also problematic. Both Richter
and l'ollini place them between the fourth
and fifth variations, while others like Brendel
scatter them throughout the piece to achieve
musical integrity. Here Thibaudet lumps
them together after the regular set, ending
the t:i) with the ethereal Variation V, which
makes a poor ending considering Schumann
had meant to conclude the piece with a
grand and magnificent Finale marked "alle
gro brillante".
One needs to turn to Michelangeli's stun
ning account on Arkadia or Cherkassky's
spellbinding rendition on Nimbus to realize
the musical potential in the "Paganini Varia
tions." For sheer magic and lush tone,
Cherkassky's "Symphonic Etudes" on Lon
don remains unsurpassed. Thibaudet has yet
to come to terms with this Germanic reper
toire he had never before recorded.
