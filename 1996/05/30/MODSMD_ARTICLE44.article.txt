What made "I he Naked Cliin series so
screamingly funny was its great writing and
deadpan humor. I he /.ucker brothers, who
also created "Airplane' and "Top Secret
(and who, unfortunately, were not around
to save "Spy Hard ) had a knack tor lunacy,
blending great characters 'like the pre-trial
O.J. with cra/v situations to produce oll
the wall schtii k. After watching "T he Naked
(iun live times, I still catch the subtle
humor that I missed earlier because 1 was
laughing too hard.
I know, I m supposed to be reviewing

"Spy 112 lard and not
"The Naked (iun.
Its just that "Spy
I lard' was ten ihle,
and I really can't
write about it with
out comparing it to
the classic. When
the best part of this
movie is the open
ing song by
"Weird" AI
Yankovic, there's a
big problem.
Its not Leslie
Nielsen's fault. He
acts in the same
straight-laced way
he did in"The
Naked (iun," only
this time there are
few good gags to
surround him.
Granted, the movie
includes promising
parodies ol several
modern films
(" True 1 ies,' "Sister
Act" and "Pulp lic
tion" to name a
few), but it's just
not enough. T he
movie sets up all of
these potentially
hilarious parodies
and delivers noth
ing.
Nielsen is auto

maticalh assumed to make any scene amus
ing without the benefit of a decent script. In
one scene, I eslii s Dick Steele, secret agent
WD-40) and colleague, the beautiful
agent 3.14 (played by Nicollette Sheridan)
replay the scene from "Pulp Fiction" when
John Iravolta and Uma I hurman do the
twist in a restaurant dance contest. The only
thing different about the "Spy Hard" parody
of this scene is that Leslie Nielsen wears a
wig with a pom tail. 1 h is supposed to be
enough to make us break into laughter. I
don't think so.
Also note that the plot in this movie is to
talis insignificant. I here's .111 e\ il villain (ir
ritatingly played by Andy Griffith) who
wants to take over the world and the only
man who can stop him is our hero, Dick

Steele. 1 he plot is an excuse to string togeth
er a bunch of lame parodies and pointless
jokes. I or example, Dick Steele boards a bus
driven h\ Ra> Charles that goes out of con
trol (1 wonder what movie this i> from?).
R.iv grimaces and savs, "Next stop, Sunset
Boulevard. 1 think. I his weakly crafted ut
terance gets the film's long awaited mild
chuckle.
1 his happens over and over. I wanted to
laugh and 1 iust couldn't do it. Mercifully, the
movie ends our suffering after only 81 min
utes. Besides a few forced laughs and an oc
casional grin, this movie left me depressed.
Depressed because I thought of "Airplane"
and"The Naked (iun ' and how funny these
movies can really be w hen done right.
