# Mission Impossible
## 
### 
Tom Cruise is cool as hell.
His Ethan Hunt is slick, precise and ag
gressive, just like the film itself. "Mission Im
possible" lives up to the hype and delivers a
captivating whodunit action thriller in the
tradition of the popular 1970s television se
ries.
Director Brian De I'alma and co-producer
Cruise magnificently string together block
buster action scenes with a sharp wit and
well-timed humor that vaults this film above
the generic big budget action film.
Filmed on location in Prague and London
— lending a dank and dreary European aura
that enhances the movie's feel — the plot
centers around something called a NOC-list,
the catalog of all the United States' covert op
eratives in Eastern Europe. The initial mis

sion is to recover the list, which is allegedly to
be sold into the proverbial wrong hands.
However, a few explosions and encounters
with elevator shafts later, Hunt (Cruise) is the
only one of his team alive to ponder what
went wrong. He then embarks on a mission
of vengeance to find who betrayed him. Plot
complexities abound and audiences are
hard-pressed to discern the facts, but they all
come together by the movie's end.
The hi-tech gadgets and gizmos that have
become a staple of recent action flicks also get
much screen time, but they are a delight
nonetheless. From elaborate disguises to poi
son-discharging pens to multiple passports
to laptops (and the requisite computer hacks
to use them), "Mission Impossible" covers
no new ground, but the gadgets remain
amusing garnish for the rest of the film.
Tom Cruise, back after a one-year hiatus
(last seen as Lestat in "Interview With A
Vampire"), proves once again that a movie

can fly on his character alone. He is the
undisputed star; the supporting cast is no
table but somewhat invisible. Emmanuelle
Heart plays Cruise s sidekick in a quiet and
forgettable role. An odd bit of casting has Jon
Voight ("Midnight Cowboy") as the leader of
Cruise's team — he cannot, however, recreate
the magic he brought to a similar role in last
year's "Heat." Ving Rhames ( "Pulp Fiction,"
"Dave") and Jean Reno ("The Professional")
are adequate in their supporting roles as for
mer agents. It is Cruise, though, that ulti
mately makes this film work. He is blown
through a window by a surge of water, dan
gled two inches above the ground, exploded
across a tunnel aboard (literally) a train —
then cracks that winning smile while exuding
a certain panache all his own. Twenty million
dollars? This actor brings in close to 10 times
that much in domestic box office.
Believe the hype.
