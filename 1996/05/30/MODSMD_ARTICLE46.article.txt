## Horseman on the Roof 
### 
"The Horseman on the Roof" is not only a
period epic, but a French period epic — which
means that it comes with a certain pedigree.
The film is directed by Jean-Haul Rappe
neau of "Cyrano de Bergerac" fame. It fea
tures "Cyrano"'s star Gerard Depardieu in a
comic cameo and actress Juliette Binoche (of
"Blue") as its strong-willed heroine. And,
among other things, it has as many exquisite
costumes, elaborate sets, sword fights and art
fully arranged dead bodies as last year's 18th
century bodice-ripper "Queen Margot."

Although Juliette Binoche gets top billing,
she shows up onlv after a lengthy introduc
tion to our hero, a young Italian colonel
named Angelo (played by Olivier Martinez,
who looks like a Gallic Brad Pitt). The year
being 1832, Angelo belongs to a group of Ital
ian nationalists who are intent on liberating
their country from the Austrians, who took
over after Napoleon's defeat.
Angelo s presently on the run from some
Austrian spies when he enters the cholera
stricken town of Manosque. When the para
noid locals think that he's spreading the epi
demic and move to hang him, Angelo takes to
the rooftops. He literally drops in on Mar
quise Pauline de Theus (Binoche) through

her window. She gives him food and shelter,
and sends him on his way in the morning.
Fate reunites the two, though, when the
townspeople are forced by soldiers to evacu
ate. Together, Angelo and Pauline storm the
quarantine barricade and head east toward.*
Paulines home and the Italian border.
What follows is a beautifully filmed mon
tage of Angelo and Pauline s journey through
the mountains of Provence, made even more
moving by the two main characters' unwist
but undeniable attraction to one another. Al
though Angelo is bound only by civic duty t<
his fellow nationalists (and perhaps to hi;
martinet mother), Pauline is married to a no
bleman thrice her ai»e. And, as they cros:

empty valleys and traverse eerily silent forests,
the threat of cholera always travels with them.
The story, based on a 1950s novel by Jean
C iiono, is tairly conventional in plot and char
acter. With Angelo's military discipline and
Paulines wifely virtue, you know that these
two will never do more than give each other
smoldering glances. But what tills in for their
unconsummated passion is the glowing cine
matography. The camera is just as much in
love with panoramic vistas of windswept
mountains as it is with Martinez and
Binoche's faces — thus making "The Horse
man on the Roof" a romance of the highest
escapist form.
