Christy, Naomi, Kate, Claudia, Nadja,
Veronica, Carla, Cindy, Yasmin, Helena.
If these names sound like a random list
out of a "name your baby i>irl" book, then

don't go out of your way to see "catwalk."
You'll herniate a disk out of boredom.
If, however, you recognize these as the first
names of highly paid supermodel icons, if
you read "Vogue" and "Bazaar," if you talk
the talk, this movie will, perhaps, be slightly
more interesting. You'll understand who's
who and what's what, like an inside joke —

however, the fact remains that there is no
punchline.
"catwalk" is the long awaited documen
tary of the beautiful mega-model Christy
Turlington — a three-week trek behind the
scenes of the spring fashion collections in
Milan, Paris and New York.
Filmmaker Robert Leacock (" Truth or

Dare") follows Christy everywhere, which is
mostly in the car, in hotel rooms and back
stage. She's always coming or going, talkingon
the cell phone, putting on or taking off make
up and greeting everyone with European
cheek-kisses. All the while cameras are con
stantly clicking to catch a bit of her in print.
The film also follows Christy and her fel
low models out on stage,

strutting their stuff to the
awesome soundtrack by Mal
colm McLaren. I heard some
one complain afterward that
"catwalk" was too much like a
music video because of all the
dubbing, but 1 was grateful
for it. Besides providing a va
riety of techno, jazz, opera,
Indian chants and sym
phonies, the soundtrack gave
the viewer a break from hav
ing to listen to the models talk
— for they had nothing inter
esting to say.
The only amusing conver
sation was in New York where
designer Isaac Mizrahi stole
the show. I lis sarcastic humor
and amusing insights remind
ed me why he was a worth
while subject for a documen
tary (see "Unzipped").
Hut the models, for the
most part, are just pretty faces.
They run around a lot but it is
clear that they're just pawns in
a game in which the real play
ers are the designers, the pho
tographers, the fashion edi
tors and the documentary
artists.
Despite the fairly good
quality of the film and the vi
sual beauty of it all, I walked
away feeling like I'd experi
enced a huge void. If the inten
tion of the film was to make
the viewer realize the empti
ness of the fashion industry
(which, considering the ban
tering in the press release, I
don't think it was), then it did
its job.
In the wise words of
Christy's Italian driver,
"Everyone think about model,
everyone talk about model.
It's pretty stupid."
