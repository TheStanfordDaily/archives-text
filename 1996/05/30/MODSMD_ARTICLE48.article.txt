## Ari Biernoff An ode to a derelict museum 
### 
The guardian of art at Stanford has a
humble dwelling these days. Rising out
of the weeds and fencing like a rotting
colossus, the l.eland Stanford Junior Art
Museum waits to be discovered and named
by each new explorer. Its ruination is pic
ture-perfect, just like its neighbor, a hand
some elder built in 1900 for the chemistry
department. Construction continues furi
ously elsewhere on campus: tractors scoop
dirt for new graduate housing and con
struction workers stare at college kids near
the Quid. Meanwhile, the museum yellows
into its seventh off-limits year. It is a hybrid
of mystery and absurdity, a jaundiced mon
ument to the lower class position of art at a
technology-oriented research university.
For those of us leaving Stanford this year, it
is also a frustrating reminder that despite
expectations of closure, completion and a
well-crafted exit, our university lives — like
our university — are tentative and unfin
ished.
The abandoned museum is goofy and
threatening at once, lis mosaic panels turn
it into a bcjeweled spaceship, more campy

than exultant. Still, one of the panels pro
vides the best definition I've ever seen of
"Progress and Civilization" — a naked
man admiring a collection of Baroque fur
niture. The signs around the security fence
warn of the "earthquake hazard area," but
the threat here is more miasmic and elusive,
from every corner, you glimpse apoca
lypse. Near the delivery entrance by
Rodin's C iates of Hell, a bicycle can be seen
parked inside. Walking along Palm Drive at
night, you can marvel at the eerie fluores
cent light winking out of the front windows
like a bilious alligator's eye. The marble
statues on the front steps sit stiffly amidst
the debris of drop cloths, rolls of electrical
tape, a portable generator and chunks of ce
ment. Completing this flash-frozen scene, a
bronze cube by sculptor Arnaldo Po
modoro erupts from a planter buried in
slag and runaway grasses, and looking like a
cross between a virus-inflamed safe-de
posit box and a computer chip. The muse
um has turned into pure science fiction. I'm
amazed it hasn't already become the film set
for an instant cult classic, perhaps a nu

clear-age Rome-Carthage rematch or a me
teor shower survivor epic.
Of course this career of decay would be
fine if Stanford had no art collection, and
intended only that its landmarks provoke
surprise. But a museum storehouse that in
cludes Rodin sculptures, Van Gogh paint
ings and American Indian art needs to be
honored and enjoyed, and for this to hap
pen it must be visible. A child born when
the earthquake hit would now be seven
years old, eager for the astonishments of a
museum. At a time when an engineering
building, an economics building, a sports
center and two computer science buildings
have all risen almost instantaneously, the
museum has been left only with long-term
promises. Scale models, with miniature
trees and people, have appeared in the
Campus Report but work has ground to a
halt; the opening date, once projected for
fall 1996, will be years away. The pace and
selection of construction 011 campus speaks
about Stanford's priorities, and all the ex
planations about special endowments and
separate building funds cannot eradicate

the symbolic impact of this neglect. Stu
dents in the last six years, and probably for
the next two, will have had no contact with
Stanford's greatest artistic legacy. A muse
um's responsibility and pleasure is beckon
ing visitors in, luring them with visual
temptations, and sending them back out
wondering. For now, though, the museum
is a crypt, sealed and silent, the crudest end
short of the bulldozer. I'm tired of its ab
sence as a public place, and its presence as a
ghost.
We have lived with the museum as a
spooky relic, walked past it, maybe tried to
breach its chain-link breeches. In fact, the
area around the museum has become just
about everything besides a place to view art:
an impromptu picnic spot to devour green
chile chicken burritos, a memento inori for
too-big-for-its-britches Classical architec
ture, a spectral danger zone near the Nu
clear Weapons Lab-revival section of cam
pus. We leave Stanford with the museum
unseen and unfinished, ourselves unfin
ished and preparing for renovations that
might not gleam for years.
