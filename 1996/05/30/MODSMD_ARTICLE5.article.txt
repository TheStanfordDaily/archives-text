# For ASSU, this year was the property of the voters

Some might argue that the students who
voted in last month's ASSU election should run
away with first prize for the most tangible ac
complishment of the year: passing the ASSU's
new constitution.
Although ASSU senators often disagreed
whether a new constitution that would com
pletely restructure Stanford's student govern
ment actually would affect students, more than
three-quarters of the slim, sub-20 percent por
tion of the student body that voted sent the
message that it is time to wipe the ASSU slate
clean and start from scratch.

"The passage of 'Constitution '96' was an
expression of dissatisfaction with the old way of
doing business," said former undergraduate
senator and current graduate senator Steve
Russell.
Most students who voted probably had not
read the fine print of the ent ire document, Rus
sell noted, which raises questions about the pre
cise reasons why voters expressed such re
markable support for the new constitution.
However nebulous the actual impulse that
fueled the "Constitution '96" vote, "the simple
truth is that students just knew they didn't like
what was going on" in the ASSU, Russell said.
