# For ASSU, this year was the property of the voters
## 
### Elizabeth Murtaugh Staff writer 
Some might argue that the students who
voted in last month's ASSU election should run
away with first prize for the most tangible ac
complishment of the year: passing the ASSU's
new constitution.
Although ASSU senators often disagreed
whether a new constitution that would com
pletely restructure Stanford's student govern
ment actually would affect students, more than
three-quarters of the slim, sub-20 percent por
tion of the student body that voted sent the
message that it is time to wipe the ASSU slate
clean and start from scratch.

"The passage of 'Constitution '96' was an
expression of dissatisfaction with the old way of
doing business," said former undergraduate
senator and current graduate senator Steve
Russell.
Most students who voted probably had not
read the fine print of the ent ire document, Rus
sell noted, which raises questions about the pre
cise reasons why voters expressed such re
markable support for the new constitution.
However nebulous the actual impulse that
fueled the "Constitution '96" vote, "the simple
truth is that students just knew they didn't like
what was going on" in the ASSU, Russell said.
Ilegiudless of shape and size, a
governing body is only as good as its
constituents arc, other senators
said.
"Structure really isn't going to
change anything unless people who
are part of the new structure are out
there working for student inter
ests," said former ASSU Deputy
Senate Chair and current President
Bill Shen. "Students aren't going to
believe the ASSI' is bet ter because of
'Constitution '96'.. . . What really
matters is that we give students
what they want ."
If the predictions of ASSU consti
tutional enthusiasts are right, the
single president will exercise much
more responsive and responsible
leadership, legislat ion in the coming
years will fly with amazing grace and
speed through the senate and the
constitutional council will ensure
that everyone involved in the ASSI'
is following the same rules.
If the reservations of skeptics dis
appoint the hopes of optimists, the
effects of the ASSI "s new governing
document will not be noticed by the
students the government is tailored
to serve.
Time, notably next year, will tell.
Individual victories
Because a fair share of bills the
senate deliberated over this year
dealt with the senate itself, its collec
tive victories seem few, or at least far
between.
However, a handful of single
minded senators who asserted time
and energy to gain ground on a par
ticular issue ended up accomplish
ing several small but meaningful
tasks.
One of the year's most laudable
success stork;s wast he smooth, swift
implementation of the new constitu
tion, thank.- in large part to the ef
forts of an ASSU committee that

Marc Wais and Senior University
General Counsel Tom Fenner to dis
cuss the details of bridging the gap
between the old and new ASSU Con
stitutions.
Former graduate senator Jessica
Koran — who was chosen to serve as
the committee's moderating chair
because she had not been involved
with either side of "Constitution
'96" prior to its passing — urged dis
puting senators to put their differ
ences aside in order to carry out the
voters' clearly expressed desires for a
new system of government.
"We did what we had to do,"
Koran said. "What it all comes down
to for me is the voices of students. 1
really felt that students would be
hurt if the constitution was not put
into effect before the end of the
year."
In another small but significant
triumph, former and current gradu
ate senator Doug Natelson con
vinced the Faculty Senate to urge
the University to conduct a long
overdue re-evaluation of teaching
assistant training methods.
As a result, this summer, for the
first time since 1988, a subcommit
tee of the Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Academic Achievement and
Appraisal will carry out an inside
out review of the way TAs are ,
trained. A comprehensive report on
the issue is expected at the beginning
of spring quarter 1997.
Because TAs often have the
most direct contact with under
graduate students, many senators
heralded the success of Natelson's
resolution as a victory whose effects
will be palpable to students in years
to come.
Several senators also called Na
telson's accomplishment a sterling
example of how well the senate could
work if it put its collective mind to
getting things done rather than ar
guing about the best way to do them.
"I don't think I did anything par
ticularly difficult," Natelson said. "It
was not that hard. Ifyou talk to peo
ple intelligently and politely, you am
really get things done."

After nearly four years of waiting
for a much-needed addition to
Tresidder Union's eatery options,
Council of Presidents member Mike
Choo and students appointed by the
ASSU Nominations Commission
helped administrators finalize nego
tiations to include Polio's in Tresid
der's dining scene.
"In order for something to hap
pen, there has to be a lot of pressure
from students," Choo said. "What
made it all possible was the strong
student outcry, strong advocacy of
student leaders and a lot of support
from Marc Wais.... All forces came
together for change."
In a rare collaborative effort be
tween senators, an ASSU campus
safety report co-written by Shen and
former Senate Chair Alane Murdock
convinced Vice Provost and Dean for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds to
charge the University with the task
of installing 75 emergency phones
on campus within the next three
years. The first 19 of the strategical
ly placed phones will be installed this
summer.
"Campus safety is an issue that
all students agree on," Shen said,
adding that the entire Stanford com
munity will reap the benefits of a
safer campus.
Upon receiving the 40-page docu
ment, "it was hard for the adminis
tration to argue with such a compre
hensive report. We weren't just
making demands. We were backing
them up with real proposals for im
provement," he said.
Murdock stressed that the senate
should make more concerted efforts
to collaborate on projects since
"working together is so much more
productive than trying to get things
done alone. Just bouncing ideas off
each other is extremely helpful."
Murdock emphasized that the
senate, because its members are all
students intent on affecting positive
changes to student life on campus,
has a lot of potential to achieve more
collective goals than it did this year.
Addressing their concern that
most Stanford students are general

ly unaware of what the ASSU does,
two senators took on the task of
making students better informed
about ASSU issues and actions.
Former and current undergradu
ate senator Gil Serrano negotiated
with Stanford Cardinal Broadcast
ing Network to get the senate's bi
weekly meetings televised live. Sena
tors demonstrated support for Ser
rano's work by incorporating the live
telecasts into next year's operating
budget.
In addition to giving students a
relatively easy way to observe what
goes on in the senate, televised meet
ing will likely encourage senators "to
act more responsibly under the cam
era"
Similarly, a dorm-based town
hall informational program tailored
by former undergraduate senator
Christy Ilamon focused on giving
students a face-to-face chance to ask
their representatives questions
about student government.
Ilamon admitted that turnout for
the meetings was not as high as she
had hoped, but stressed that she
plans to encourage senators who will
serve next year to continue the pro
gram, beginning as early as Orienta
tion.
"If we make the ASSU more
known, students might feel more
compelled to call us and tell us about
the issues that are most important
to them," Ramon said.
Other senators agreed that mak
ing the ASSU seem more relevant
and accountable to students should
be high on the senate's list of priori
ties in the future, particularly next
year when the structural changes
students voted on will begin to take
root.
Fragmentation
One of the reasons why the tally
of the senate's successes is counted
on individual terms is that the limbs
worked better independent of the
body.
While mastering the messy art of
bickering, senators often made slop
py disagreements of what were, on a

fundamental level, common goals.
On one side were senators who
felt that keeping the ASSU fastened
securely to its rules was an essential
step to carrying out their bills and
resolutions.
On the other side were senators
who grew frustrated with the em
phasis on the rules and regulations
laid out in a constitution and a set of
bylaws that often contradicted each
other.
Calling the focus on its own gov
erning documents myopic, this
camp of senators emphasized that
getting jobs done to help students
was the most important thing to
focus on, regardless of how loose
such a style of legislating might
prove to be.
Calling this year's senate "frag
mented and polarized," Serrano said
the bickering "increased the chaos
and workload of people who wanted
to got things done. Basically, people
didn't trust each other enough to
work together on the same cause.
Everyone suspected that everyone
else had some sort of hidden agen
da."
Though some senators admitted
that fierce debate can be construc
tive, several pinpointed personal at
tacks as their main objections to
bickering gone overboard.
One of the most memorable, and
lengthy personal debates was Rus
sell's unsuccessful attempt to garner
a two-thirds vote to oust Murdock
from the senate chair.
"There was an unfortunate ten
dency for people not to respect one
another's opinions," Natelson said.
"People often had great difficulty be
lieving that two intelligent people
can have differing opinions on the
same issue. It was too bad that peo
ple couldn't agree to disagree with
out getting acrimonious."
Russell, who many senators ac
cused of instigating arguments that
made debates too bitter to be pro
ductive, said, "I think sometimes
people are too quick to criticize bick
ering. Arguments and disputes have
always been part of government and

will always be part of the most suc
cessful governments.
"Students will have a lot to worry
about when their representatives
stop arguing. When everyone
agrees, no one cares. A lot of the pas
sion and vehemence that flies in the
ASSU reflects how deeply senators
care about Stanford and about the
ASSU."
Consensus?
Although consensus often
seemed to be a dying parliamentary
art form on the senate floor this
year, the senate surprised itself a few
times by comingtogetherasachorus
singing the same song.
On two noteworthy occasions,
senators stepped forward and made
strong, vocal pronouncements
against faculty decisions that they
felt posed threats to the future of an
undergraduate interdisciplinary
program and to student representa
tion on University committees.
One unanimously passed ASSU
resolution gave the senate's formal
support of the efforts of 50 Science,
Technology and Society students
fighting to prevent a proposed elimi
nation of their major.
And in passionate response to the
Faculty Senate's decision to exclude
students from its Planning and Poli
cy Board, senate representatives
spoke out in compelling opposition
to the faculty's stinging slap in the
face of student representation.
"Student representation in the
governance of the University is one
of Stanford's greatest strengths,"
said Financial Manager John Hall,
who was instrumental in urging the
senate to join hands in favor of stu
dent voices.
"In addition to providing a fresh
perspective on the committees,"
Hall added, "student representa
tives gain a real appreciat ion for the
complexities of running a world
class university [and] gain a better
sense of citizenship in the University
— putting themselves in the presi
dent's shoes and trying to figure out
what's best for Stanford."
Some might argue that the students who
voted in last month's ASSU election should run
away with first prize for the most tangible ac

One of the reasons why the tally
of the senate's successes is counted
on individual terms is that the limbs
worked better independent of the
body.
While mastering the messy art of
bickering, senators often made slop
py disagreements of what were, on a

fundamental level, common goals.
On one side were senators who
felt that keeping the ASSU fastened
securely to its rules was an essential
step to carrying out their bills and
resolutions.
On the other side were senators
who grew frustrated with the em
phasis on the rules and regulations
laid out in a constitution and a set of
bylaws that often contradicted each
other.
Calling the focus on its own gov
erning documents myopic, this
camp of senators emphasized that
getting jobs done to help students
was the most important thing to
focus on, regardless of how loose
such a style of legislating might
prove to be.
Calling this year's senate "frag
mented and polarized," Serrano said
the bickering "increased the chaos
and workload of people who wanted
to got things done. Basically, people
didn't trust each other enough to
work together on the same cause.
Everyone suspected that everyone
else had some sort of hidden agen
da."
Though some senators admitted
that fierce debate can be construc
tive, several pinpointed personal at
tacks as their main objections to
bickering gone overboard.
One of the most memorable, and
lengthy personal debates was Rus
sell's unsuccessful attempt to garner
a two-thirds vote to oust Murdock
from the senate chair.
"There was an unfortunate ten
dency for people not to respect one
another's opinions," Natelson said.
"People often had great difficulty be
lieving that two intelligent people
can have differing opinions on the
same issue. It was too bad that peo
ple couldn't agree to disagree with
out getting acrimonious."
Russell, who many senators ac
cused of instigating arguments that
made debates too bitter to be pro
ductive, said, "I think sometimes
people are too quick to criticize bick
ering. Arguments and disputes have
always been part of government and

will always be part of the most suc
cessful governments.
"Students will have a lot to worry
about when their representatives
stop arguing. When everyone
agrees, no one cares. A lot of the pas
sion and vehemence that flies in the
ASSU reflects how deeply senators
care about Stanford and about the
ASSU."
Consensus?
Although consensus often
seemed to be a dying parliamentary
art form on the senate floor this
year, the senate surprised itself a few
times by comingtogetherasachorus
singing the same song.
On two noteworthy occasions,
senators stepped forward and made
strong, vocal pronouncements
against faculty decisions that they
felt posed threats to the future of an
undergraduate interdisciplinary
program and to student representa
tion on University committees.
One unanimously passed ASSU
resolution gave the senate's formal
support of the efforts of 50 Science,
Technology and Society students
fighting to prevent a proposed elimi
nation of their major.
And in passionate response to the
Faculty Senate's decision to exclude
students from its Planning and Poli
cy Board, senate representatives
spoke out in compelling opposition
to the faculty's stinging slap in the
face of student representation.
"Student representation in the
governance of the University is one
of Stanford's greatest strengths,"
said Financial Manager John Hall,
who was instrumental in urging the
senate to join hands in favor of stu
dent voices.
"In addition to providing a fresh
perspective on the committees,"
Hall added, "student representa
tives gain a real appreciat ion for the
complexities of running a world
class university [and] gain a better
sense of citizenship in the University
— putting themselves in the presi
dent's shoes and trying to figure out
what's best for Stanford."
Some might argue that the students who
voted in last month's ASSU election should run
away with first prize for the most tangible ac
complishment of the year: passing the ASSU's
new constitution.
Although ASSU senators often disagreed
whether a new constitution that would com
pletely restructure Stanford's student govern
ment actually would affect students, more than
three-quarters of the slim, sub-20 percent por
tion of the student body that voted sent the
message that it is time to wipe the ASSU slate
clean and start from scratch.

"The passage of 'Constitution '96' was an
expression of dissatisfaction with the old way of
doing business," said former undergraduate
senator and current graduate senator Steve
Russell.
Most students who voted probably had not
read the fine print of the ent ire document, Rus
sell noted, which raises questions about the pre
cise reasons why voters expressed such re
markable support for the new constitution.
However nebulous the actual impulse that
fueled the "Constitution '96" vote, "the simple
truth is that students just knew they didn't like
what was going on" in the ASSU, Russell said.
Ilegiudless of shape and size, a
governing body is only as good as its
constituents arc, other senators
said.
"Structure really isn't going to
change anything unless people who
are part of the new structure are out
there working for student inter
ests," said former ASSU Deputy
Senate Chair and current President
Bill Shen. "Students aren't going to
believe the ASSI' is bet ter because of
'Constitution '96'.. . . What really
matters is that we give students
what they want ."
If the predictions of ASSU consti
tutional enthusiasts are right, the
single president will exercise much
more responsive and responsible
leadership, legislat ion in the coming
years will fly with amazing grace and
speed through the senate and the
constitutional council will ensure
that everyone involved in the ASSI'
is following the same rules.
If the reservations of skeptics dis
appoint the hopes of optimists, the
effects of the ASSI "s new governing
document will not be noticed by the
students the government is tailored
to serve.
Time, notably next year, will tell.
Individual victories
Because a fair share of bills the
senate deliberated over this year
dealt with the senate itself, its collec
tive victories seem few, or at least far
between.
However, a handful of single
minded senators who asserted time
and energy to gain ground on a par
ticular issue ended up accomplish
ing several small but meaningful
tasks.
One of the year's most laudable
success stork;s wast he smooth, swift
implementation of the new constitu
tion, thank.- in large part to the ef
forts of an ASSU committee that

Marc Wais and Senior University
General Counsel Tom Fenner to dis
cuss the details of bridging the gap
between the old and new ASSU Con
stitutions.
Former graduate senator Jessica
Koran — who was chosen to serve as
the committee's moderating chair
because she had not been involved
with either side of "Constitution
'96" prior to its passing — urged dis
puting senators to put their differ
ences aside in order to carry out the
voters' clearly expressed desires for a
new system of government.
"We did what we had to do,"
Koran said. "What it all comes down
to for me is the voices of students. 1
really felt that students would be
hurt if the constitution was not put
into effect before the end of the
year."
In another small but significant
triumph, former and current gradu
ate senator Doug Natelson con
vinced the Faculty Senate to urge
the University to conduct a long
overdue re-evaluation of teaching
assistant training methods.
As a result, this summer, for the
first time since 1988, a subcommit
tee of the Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Academic Achievement and
Appraisal will carry out an inside
out review of the way TAs are ,
trained. A comprehensive report on
the issue is expected at the beginning
of spring quarter 1997.
Because TAs often have the
most direct contact with under
graduate students, many senators
heralded the success of Natelson's
resolution as a victory whose effects
will be palpable to students in years
to come.
Several senators also called Na
telson's accomplishment a sterling
example of how well the senate could
work if it put its collective mind to
getting things done rather than ar
guing about the best way to do them.
"I don't think I did anything par
ticularly difficult," Natelson said. "It
was not that hard. Ifyou talk to peo
ple intelligently and politely, you am
really get things done."

After nearly four years of waiting
for a much-needed addition to
Tresidder Union's eatery options,
Council of Presidents member Mike
Choo and students appointed by the
ASSU Nominations Commission
helped administrators finalize nego
tiations to include Polio's in Tresid
der's dining scene.
"In order for something to hap
pen, there has to be a lot of pressure
from students," Choo said. "What
made it all possible was the strong
student outcry, strong advocacy of
student leaders and a lot of support
from Marc Wais.... All forces came
together for change."
In a rare collaborative effort be
tween senators, an ASSU campus
safety report co-written by Shen and
former Senate Chair Alane Murdock
convinced Vice Provost and Dean for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds to
charge the University with the task
of installing 75 emergency phones
on campus within the next three
years. The first 19 of the strategical
ly placed phones will be installed this
summer.
"Campus safety is an issue that
all students agree on," Shen said,
adding that the entire Stanford com
munity will reap the benefits of a
safer campus.
Upon receiving the 40-page docu
ment, "it was hard for the adminis
tration to argue with such a compre
hensive report. We weren't just
making demands. We were backing
them up with real proposals for im
provement," he said.
Murdock stressed that the senate
should make more concerted efforts
to collaborate on projects since
"working together is so much more
productive than trying to get things
done alone. Just bouncing ideas off
each other is extremely helpful."
Murdock emphasized that the
senate, because its members are all
students intent on affecting positive
changes to student life on campus,
has a lot of potential to achieve more
collective goals than it did this year.
Addressing their concern that
most Stanford students are general

ly unaware of what the ASSU does,
two senators took on the task of
making students better informed
about ASSU issues and actions.
Former and current undergradu
ate senator Gil Serrano negotiated
with Stanford Cardinal Broadcast
ing Network to get the senate's bi
weekly meetings televised live. Sena
tors demonstrated support for Ser
rano's work by incorporating the live
telecasts into next year's operating
budget.
In addition to giving students a
relatively easy way to observe what
goes on in the senate, televised meet
ing will likely encourage senators "to
act more responsibly under the cam
era"
Similarly, a dorm-based town
hall informational program tailored
by former undergraduate senator
Christy Ilamon focused on giving
students a face-to-face chance to ask
their representatives questions
about student government.
Ilamon admitted that turnout for
the meetings was not as high as she
had hoped, but stressed that she
plans to encourage senators who will
serve next year to continue the pro
gram, beginning as early as Orienta
tion.
"If we make the ASSU more
known, students might feel more
compelled to call us and tell us about
the issues that are most important
to them," Ramon said.
Other senators agreed that mak
ing the ASSU seem more relevant
and accountable to students should
be high on the senate's list of priori
ties in the future, particularly next
year when the structural changes
students voted on will begin to take
root.
