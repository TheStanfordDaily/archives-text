Herbert Boswell Nanney, 77, who per
formed at roughly 5,000 weddings during
his 39 years as Memorial Church's organist,
died May 20 of heart disease.
"Herb was one of the best-liked people on
campus," said current University organist
Robert Bates. "I think it would be hard to
find anyone who didn't like Herb Nanney."
Nanney retired in 1985 from his position
at the helm of Memorial Church's organs.
He was also a professor in the Music De
partment, teaching music and organ class
es.
"His students all loved him," Bates said.
"He was very supportive."

Nanney earned his bachelor's degree in
music from Whittier College in 1940 and
played organ at Stanford briefly before leav
ing to serve in England and France during
World War 11. He continued his education
after the war, completing requirements for
an artist's diploma at the Curtis Institute of
Music in Philadelphia and a master's degree
at Stanford. He shares the name of the
church's Fisk-Nanney organ with the organ
maker, the late Charles Fisk.
Bates remembered Nanney for his sense
of humor, which he said became a part of
every performance Nanney gave.
"He genuinely liked people, and I think
that came across in his organ playing,"
