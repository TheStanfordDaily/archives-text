# Former organist dies at 77
## Nanney spent 39 years at the keys in Mem Chu 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Herbert Boswell Nanney, 77, who per
formed at roughly 5,000 weddings during
his 39 years as Memorial Church's organist,
died May 20 of heart disease.
"Herb was one of the best-liked people on
campus," said current University organist
Robert Bates. "I think it would be hard to
find anyone who didn't like Herb Nanney."
Nanney retired in 1985 from his position
at the helm of Memorial Church's organs.
He was also a professor in the Music De
partment, teaching music and organ class
es.
"His students all loved him," Bates said.
"He was very supportive."

Nanney earned his bachelor's degree in
music from Whittier College in 1940 and
played organ at Stanford briefly before leav
ing to serve in England and France during
World War 11. He continued his education
after the war, completing requirements for
an artist's diploma at the Curtis Institute of
Music in Philadelphia and a master's degree
at Stanford. He shares the name of the
church's Fisk-Nanney organ with the organ
maker, the late Charles Fisk.
Bates remembered Nanney for his sense
of humor, which he said became a part of
every performance Nanney gave.
"He genuinely liked people, and I think
that came across in his organ playing,"
Bates said. "There was a great
humor and a great deal of per
sonability coining out in his play
ing."
Bates said Nanney enjoyed
telling stories about his experi
ences performing, including one
about returning from a trip ex
hausted. Nanney claimed he fell
asleep during a wedding and
woke up while he was playing the
traditional wedding march.
"I don't know if it's true or
not, but that's the way he would
tell stories â€” in all seriousness,
and people didn't know whether
to believe him," Bates said.
Nanney is survived by his
wife, Jean, and son, Duncan of
San Jose, and by a sister, Cather
ine Biggers of Whittier. Services
are scheduled for 11 a.m. June 14
at First United Methodist
Church in Sunnyvale.
Donations in his memory may
be made to the American Guild of
Organists, 475 Riverside Drive,
Suite 1260. New York, NY
