## The 						Kids Can Wait With President Clintons blessing, computer companies are flooding public schools with free technology. Is this corporate philanthropy — or commerical philandering? 
### Colleen Krueger 
In 1981, Apple Computer founder Steve Jobs — already aware of his
company's primacy in the educational market — had what former
Apple Marketing Manager Phil Roybal called "the only purely origi
nal idea that 1 heard from him during the time he was with Apple."
In Jeffrey Young's biography of Jobs, Roybal recalls a seminal conver
sation between himself and Jobs at an annual sales conference in
Hawaii.
"Look, it's time to get computers into the schools," Jobs said,
according to Roybal. "We've got to do it now — the kids can't wait.
I ve been thinking about this. Why can't we just give away a comput
er to every school in the country? We'll get all sorts of good publicity
and a tax break, and we'll get our systems in front of hundreds of
thousands of kids."
Roybal remembers trying to tell Jobs that "the laws of donations
were such that a manufacturer could only take credit for the raw mate
rials involved."
Jobs response was terse and determined: " Then we'll change the
law."
He set about to do just that, pushing for a rewriting of U.S. rax
law to allow full-value deductions for technology donations. Jobs was
nt making a great deal of progress until he met California
Congressman Pete Stark on a cross-country plane trip and hyped his
plans to the lawmaker. Soon Stark was sponsoring legislation to grant
Apple and other computer companies new tax breaks for donating
personal computers to American schools, a bill dubbed "The Kids
Can't Wait."
But Jobs was stymied by public skepticism. Lawmakers, con
stituents, scholars and journalists came out against the measure —
some unsure about the virtues of computers in education and virtual
ly all suspicious of Apple's motives. U.S. Education Secretary Terrel
Bell called the push to bring computers into schools "almost a fad."
Cultural critics like Theodore Roszak went at high-tech companies
like Apple with white gloves decidedly off. "In an effort to prime the
pump for future sales of its product, the computer industry is cur
rently making its wares massively available to universities and entire
school systems at cut rate or free of charge, Roszak wrote in 1983.
"For the most part, schools. . .have responded with the promptness
and the gullibility of well-trained consumers to the commercial pres
sure of the computer industry."
Despite Jobs' personal lobbying efforts, the U.S. Congress defeat
ed his "The Kids Can't Wait bill and refused to grant Apple's $64 mil
lion tax credit. Critics across the country - in newspaper editorials and
PIA meetings — accused Apple of using children to sell computers to
parents, and donating machines for profitable tax credits. Apple
defended its plan as a symbiotic blend of educational philanthropy
and shrewd business sense; critics acknowledged only the latter.
Fast-forward little more than a decade to September of 1995.
President Bill Clinton, on a pre-campaign sweep through California,
announced the President's Educational lechnology Initiative, a plan
to place a computer linked to the Internet in every American class
room by the year 2000. Clinton pledged that by the end of the 1995-
96 school year, Inrcrnet-capable computers would be placed in 50,000
California classrooms. Department of Education officials estimated
the cost of the national initiative at about $10 billion, with $2 billion
of federal funds to "augment about four times as much" raised
through private means or through local communities (read "corporate
grants.") But a study conducted by McKinsey and Company — an
accounting firm for the National Infrastructure Advisory Council —
said "the cost of providing computers for all classrooms would range
from between $11 billion for a computer laboratory used by groups of
students to $47 billion for Clinton's program."
With the initiative, the President has made an unhesitating
endorsement of "public-private partnerships" in the classroom.

Indeed, Clinton effusively described corporate efforts to outfit class
rooms with technical gear as "high-tech barn-raising." The California
effort, for example, involves no federal moneys; the computer hard
ware, software, training and Internet access costs will be donated by
high-technology companies and others in the private sector.
Contributing companies include Apple Computer, the Hewlett-
Packard Corporation, the Oracle Corporation, IBM, Sun-
Microsystems and a host of other Silicon Valley heavyweights.
1 he Clinton plan calls for high-tech corporations to assume a role
in national education very similar to the one Steve Jobs tried to create
15 years ago. But this time, politicians, the public and the media have

been largely silent and, often, encouraging.
It is as if the Apple debate of the early 1980s
never took place. The inherent good of
"partnering" corporate interests with the
national educational agenda seems to have
been accepted as self-evident; indeed,
Clinton does not shy away from linking the
two in his popular rhetoric, but in fact
often emphasizes a vision of the private sec
tor as both an authoritative and an appro
priate voice in the American educational
system.
" I hese companies who compete vig
orously every day in the marketplace have
come together in the classroom," Clinton
proclaimed proudly in September, "Our
administration has brought these compa
nies together, we have set goals, bur they
are doing the rest." In the same speech, he
makes the robust claim that "children with
access to computers learn faster and learn
better," citing impressive statistics that

"prove" — among other things — that comptuer learning causes
standardized test scores to rise by 10 to 15 percent. These numbers
become more suspect, however, when one realizes that they were
taken from a 10-year study called "Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow" by
Apple Computer's Education division. Most educational scholars,
however, agree that comprehensive and definitive reserach on the
effectiveness of computer learning has not yet been completed, and
that, at any rate, the benefits of computer-aided education may be
such that traditional scoring methods like standardized tests cannor
accurately measure them.
Newspaper editorials, like this one from the Christian Science
Monitor, gush that "political backing, business participation. . .and
enthusiastic students, teachers and parents could yet combine to make
the president's goal reachable." The Department of Education did

hold a series of regional forums, inviting
hundreds of citizens to discuss the
President's plans. But, according to govern
ment reports documenting the meetings,
not one delegate questioned partnerships
between businesses and schools. (These

did hold a series of regional forums, inviting hundreds of citizens to
discuss the President s plans. But, according to government reports
documenting the meetings, not one delegate questioned partnerships

on word processing, one middle school technology coordinator admit
ted. Small cash grants for what one teacher termed "glue expenses" are
also missing from most grants. Apple claimed to have fully wired one
inner-city classroom for the Internet, but - when 1 visited — 1 saw that
only one of the grants' 20 or so computers is actually Internet capable.
I he teacher just shook his head when I asked about the discrepancy, say
ing that his school could not come up with a few hundred dollars for
coaxial cable and other basic connection materials.
1 here is nothing inherently wrong or unethical about corporate
grant programs to schools, just as there is nothing inherently right or
valuable about them. But there is something terribly wrong with the pos
sibility that corporate grant programs — "partners" in a national initia
tive — might be lowering the quality of students' education or con
tributing to social inequality between children in public schools with
their donations.
We must ask corporate grant programs which ally themselves with
Clinton's program to make three basic moral commitments. First, com
panies must try to make sure that their donation programs are benefit
ing — or not, at least, harming — education. This objective seems best
accomplished through the establishment of comprehensive grant pro
grams, like Oracle's. One teacher at an Oracle grant school went so far as
to say that, without the on-going technical support and relief substitute
teachers that the company provides, the equipment would "cause more
trouble than it's worth." Donating computer hardware is just the first
step toward impacting education in a positive way. If a company stops
there, its donation could very well have a negative impact on education
quality. leacher training, regular on-site support visits and cash grants
help ensure that students are not harmed by corporate information tech
nology donations.
At the same time, companies that wish to be "partners" with the
national educational system must ensure that their programs do not
exacerbate racial, ethnic and socio-economic divisions in society. They
must also avoid programs that arc essentially a means to market com
puters to parents. These latter two ethical objectives are — in many ways
— joined at the hip. Programs which target under-represented racial and
ethnic minorities and students from poor and working class families do
not typically spend a great deal of time or effort marketing their wares to
parents. On the other hand, insidious marketing messages and strategies
are often integral parts of programs which do not target under-privileged
groups.
c
V yliftord Stoll, author of the best-seller Silicon Snake Oil\ has said 011
several occasion that he feels like a voice in the wilderness with his cri
tique of the "Information Super Highway" and all of its rhetorical trap
pings. "I just ask questions," he says of his work, "questions that it seems
to me should have answers. I get worried when those of us buying into
this revolution, this Information Revolution, don't have those answers
and are so bothered by the questions." Indeed, Stoll is among very few
asking questions about the role of corporate grant programs in the
President's Educational Technology Initiative: "There's this culture of
computing that says we know what's best for everyone else. . .We're the
experts in everything," he said. "I find this offensive. What do Apple or
Microsoft know about teaching in a classroom? Tell me how Bill Gates
knows what schools and colleges need. Does he have teaching creden
tials? What is his insight into the needs of a classroom?
Certainly, given Stoll's stand on the detrimental effects of computers
in the classroom, it was something of a given that he would find (Clinton's
program objectionable. But his basic point is well taken: surrendering
even part of a government responsibility as fundamental and valuable as
public education to big corporations with private interests is a dangerous
proposition.
If we, as a nation, wish to proceed with the President's technology
plan, that procedure must be a very cautious one. The task of building
ethical, equitable public-private partnerships has always been difficult, to
say the least. But throw the tremendous burden of our children's educa
tion into the mix and the challenging work of striking a balance becomes
critical and treacherous. Any initiative that claims to merge the best
interests of children with the best interests of corporations should raise
eyebrows and suspicions. 1 hat coupling should prompt a red flag for
journalists, educators and concerned citizens. It is disturbing (and symp
tomatic of a larger problem: Americans' unquestioning fascination with

information technologies) that so very few have stepped forward with the
kind of basic, evaluative questions about this program that Stoll urges
Americans to ask about technology.
It may not be fair or realistic to expect big business to act in a way
that is not fundamentally sMf-interested. The scholastic market is large

and growing: in the 1993-94 school year
alone, American k-12 public schools spent an
estimated $2.43 billion 011 educational hard
ware and software. But we can ask and rea
sonably expect that companies participating
in Clintons federal program will adhere to
three basic ethical criteria:
1. their programs must help — or at least not
harm — a student's education;
2. their programs must not exacerbate soci
ety's racial and socio-economic divisions;
3. their programs must not overtly use the
classroom as an extension of the market
place, a venue for commercial computer
sales.
It is more than fair for 11s to demand
that companies participating in Clinton's
program meet these standards; to borrow

from the famous ruling on corporate philanthropy and education, A.P.
Smith v. Harlow, "it amounts to a solemn duty. For how could we accept
as policy a national educational program which does not?
Even if a corporate grant program tailors its program to meet the
above objectives, keep in mind that it still has still only met a very basic
set of ethical requirements. 'I'here is a larger, fundamental question, a
question lurking just below the surface in computer labs and classrooms
across the country: Do we want computers in the classroom? As one Bay
Area teacher confided, " There is so much money and effort and so many
freebies going out to promote computers in school," she said. "I'm so
tired of seeing the technology take center stage. Its strange to me that this
is what we think is appropriate in a child's education and. . .in public
schools."
Intuitions, political rhetoric and cyber-hypc about the dawning
"Information Age' do not give us real answers. We need more firm,
definitive research to guide our decisions. Instead of initiating a national
drive for "computers in the classroom, — analogous, as many politi

cians have suggested, to the Race to Space
of the 1960s — perhaps we should first
inaugurate a national effort to leant about
computers in the classroom. Apple

he can turn to for statistical data about
classroom technology in his speeches, as
he did last September.

make it easier for high-technology compa

Although his "The Kids Can't Wait" bill failed, Stark has remained an
enthusiastic proponent of partnerships between high-tech companies
and educational communities. During a visit to a San Francisco school
in 1982, Stark reportedly took it upon himself to demonstrate that any
one can use an Apple Computer to learn geography. I le asked an eager
student at the computer to type in "San Francisco" for a description of
the city. But, even after several attempts, the student could not spell "San
Francisco."
Even an ethical program of computer grants may not be the educa
tional panacea for which we are so desperately searching. As one teacher
at a very poor, local school put it: At some point, somebody has to say,
'The Emperor has no clothes. "

$11 billion for a computer laboratory used by groups of stu
dents to $47 billion for Clinton's program.
With the initiative, the President has made .111
unhesitating endorsement of "public-private partnerships
in the classroom. Indeed, Clinton effusively described cor
porate efforts to outfit classrooms with technical gear as
"high-tech barn-raising.' I he California effort, for example,
involves no federal moneys; the computer hardware, soft
ware, training and Internet access costs will be donated by
high-technology companies and others in the private sector.
Contributing companies include Apple Computer, the
Hewlett-Packard Corporation, the Oracle Corporation,
IBM, Sun-Microsvstems and a host of other Silicon \alley
heavyweights.
The Clinton plan calls for high-tech corporations to
assume a role in national education very similar to the one
Steve Jobs tried to create 15 years ago. But this time, politi
cians, the public and the media have been largely silent and,
often, encouraging. It is as if the Apple debate of the early
19X0S never took place. The inherent good of "partnering

corporate interests with the national educational agenda seems to
have been accepted as self-evident; indeed, Clinton does not shy away
from linking the two in his popular rhetoric, but in fact often empha
sizes a vision of the private sector as both an authoritative and .111
appropriate voice in the American educational system.
"These companies who compete vigorously every day in the
marketplace have come together in the classroom," Clinton pro
claimed proudly in September, "Our administration has brought
these companies together, we have set goals, but they are doing the
rest." In the same speech, he makes the robust claim that "children
with access to computers learn faster and learn better," citing impres
sive statistics that "prove" — among other things — that computer
learning causes standardized test scores to rise by 10 to 15 percent.
These numbers become more suspect, however, when one realizes
that they were taken from a 10-vear study called "Apple Classrooms of
Tomorrow" by Apple Computers Education division. Most educa
tional scholars, however, agree that comprehensive and definitive
reserach on the effectiveness of computer learning has not yet been
completed, and that, at any rate, the benefits of computer-aided edu
cation may be such that traditional scoring methods like standardized
tests cannor accurately measure them.
Newspaper editorials, like this one from the Christian Science
Monitor, gush that "political backing, business participation. . .and
enthusiastic students, teachers and parents could yet combine to
make the presidents goal reachable." The Department of Education
did hold a series of regional forums, inviting hundreds of citizens to
discuss the President s plans. But, according to government reports
documenting the meetings, not one delegate questioned partnerships

on word processing, one middle school technology coordinator admit
ted. Small cash grants for what one teacher termed "glue expenses" are
also missing from most grants. Apple claimed to have fully wired one
inner-city classroom for the Internet, but - when 1 visited — 1 saw that
only one of the grants' 20 or so computers is actually Internet capable.
I he teacher just shook his head when I asked about the discrepancy, say
ing that his school could not come up with a few hundred dollars for
coaxial cable and other basic connection materials.
1 here is nothing inherently wrong or unethical about corporate
grant programs to schools, just as there is nothing inherently right or
valuable about them. But there is something terribly wrong with the pos
sibility that corporate grant programs — "partners" in a national initia
tive — might be lowering the quality of students' education or con
tributing to social inequality between children in public schools with
their donations.
We must ask corporate grant programs which ally themselves with
Clinton's program to make three basic moral commitments. First, com
panies must try to make sure that their donation programs are benefit
ing — or not, at least, harming — education. This objective seems best
accomplished through the establishment of comprehensive grant pro
grams, like Oracle's. One teacher at an Oracle grant school went so far as
to say that, without the on-going technical support and relief substitute
teachers that the company provides, the equipment would "cause more
trouble than it's worth." Donating computer hardware is just the first
step toward impacting education in a positive way. If a company stops
there, its donation could very well have a negative impact on education
quality. leacher training, regular on-site support visits and cash grants
help ensure that students are not harmed by corporate information tech
nology donations.
At the same time, companies that wish to be "partners" with the
national educational system must ensure that their programs do not
exacerbate racial, ethnic and socio-economic divisions in society. They
must also avoid programs that arc essentially a means to market com
puters to parents. These latter two ethical objectives are — in many ways
— joined at the hip. Programs which target under-represented racial and
ethnic minorities and students from poor and working class families do
not typically spend a great deal of time or effort marketing their wares to
parents. On the other hand, insidious marketing messages and strategies
are often integral parts of programs which do not target under-privileged
groups.

V yliftord Stoll, author of the best-seller Silicon Snake Oil\ has said 011
several occasion that he feels like a voice in the wilderness with his cri
tique of the "Information Super Highway" and all of its rhetorical trap
pings. "I just ask questions," he says of his work, "questions that it seems
to me should have answers. I get worried when those of us buying into
this revolution, this Information Revolution, don't have those answers
and are so bothered by the questions." Indeed, Stoll is among very few
asking questions about the role of corporate grant programs in the
President's Educational Technology Initiative: "There's this culture of
computing that says we know what's best for everyone else. . .We're the
experts in everything," he said. "I find this offensive. What do Apple or
Microsoft know about teaching in a classroom? Tell me how Bill Gates
knows what schools and colleges need. Does he have teaching creden
tials? What is his insight into the needs of a classroom?
Certainly, given Stoll's stand on the detrimental effects of computers
in the classroom, it was something of a given that he would find (Clinton's
program objectionable. But his basic point is well taken: surrendering
even part of a government responsibility as fundamental and valuable as
public education to big corporations with private interests is a dangerous
proposition.
If we, as a nation, wish to proceed with the President's technology
plan, that procedure must be a very cautious one. The task of building
ethical, equitable public-private partnerships has always been difficult, to
say the least. But throw the tremendous burden of our children's educa
tion into the mix and the challenging work of striking a balance becomes
critical and treacherous. Any initiative that claims to merge the best
interests of children with the best interests of corporations should raise
eyebrows and suspicions. 1 hat coupling should prompt a red flag for
journalists, educators and concerned citizens. It is disturbing (and symp
tomatic of a larger problem: Americans' unquestioning fascination with

information technologies) that so very few have stepped forward with the
kind of basic, evaluative questions about this program that Stoll urges
Americans to ask about technology.
It may not be fair or realistic to expect big business to act in a way
that is not fundamentally sMf-interested. The scholastic market is large

and growing: in the 1993-94 school year
alone, American k-12 public schools spent an
estimated $2.43 billion 011 educational hard

sonably expect that companies participating
in Clintons federal program will adhere to
three basic ethical criteria:
1. their programs must help — or at least not
harm — a student's education;
2. their programs must not exacerbate soci

3. their programs must not overtly use the
classroom as an extension of the market

sales.

In 1981, Apple Computer founder Steve Jobs — already aware of his
company's primacy in the educational market — had what former
Apple Marketing Manager Phil Roybal called "the only purely origi
nal idea that 1 heard from him during the time he was with Apple."
In Jeffrey Young's biography of Jobs, Roybal recalls a seminal conver
sation between himself and Jobs at an annual sales conference in
Hawaii.
"Look, it's time to get computers into the schools," Jobs said,
according to Roybal. "We've got to do it now — the kids can't wait.
I ve been thinking about this. Why can't we just give away a comput
er to every school in the country? We'll get all sorts of good publicity
and a tax break, and we'll get our systems in front of hundreds of
thousands of kids."
Roybal remembers trying to tell Jobs that "the laws of donations
were such that a manufacturer could only take credit for the raw mate
rials involved."
Jobs response was terse and determined: " Then we'll change the
law."
He set about to do just that, pushing for a rewriting of U.S. rax
law to allow full-value deductions for technology donations. Jobs was
nt making a great deal of progress until he met California
Congressman Pete Stark on a cross-country plane trip and hyped his
plans to the lawmaker. Soon Stark was sponsoring legislation to grant
Apple and other computer companies new tax breaks for donating
personal computers to American schools, a bill dubbed "The Kids
Can't Wait."
But Jobs was stymied by public skepticism. Lawmakers, con
stituents, scholars and journalists came out against the measure —
some unsure about the virtues of computers in education and virtual
ly all suspicious of Apple's motives. U.S. Education Secretary Terrel
Bell called the push to bring computers into schools "almost a fad."
Cultural critics like Theodore Roszak went at high-tech companies
like Apple with white gloves decidedly off. "In an effort to prime the
pump for future sales of its product, the computer industry is cur
rently making its wares massively available to universities and entire
school systems at cut rate or free of charge, Roszak wrote in 1983.
"For the most part, schools. . .have responded with the promptness
and the gullibility of well-trained consumers to the commercial pres
sure of the computer industry."
Despite Jobs' personal lobbying efforts, the U.S. Congress defeat
ed his "The Kids Can't Wait bill and refused to grant Apple's $64 mil
lion tax credit. Critics across the country - in newspaper editorials and
PIA meetings — accused Apple of using children to sell computers to
parents, and donating machines for profitable tax credits. Apple
defended its plan as a symbiotic blend of educational philanthropy
and shrewd business sense; critics acknowledged only the latter.
Fast-forward little more than a decade to September of 1995.
President Bill Clinton, on a pre-campaign sweep through California,
announced the President's Educational lechnology Initiative, a plan
to place a computer linked to the Internet in every American class
room by the year 2000. Clinton pledged that by the end of the 1995-
96 school year, Inrcrnet-capable computers would be placed in 50,000
California classrooms. Department of Education officials estimated
the cost of the national initiative at about $10 billion, with $2 billion
of federal funds to "augment about four times as much" raised
through private means or through local communities (read "corporate
grants.") But a study conducted by McKinsey and Company — an
accounting firm for the National Infrastructure Advisory Council —
said "the cost of providing computers for all classrooms would range
from between $11 billion for a computer laboratory used by groups of
students to $47 billion for Clinton's program."
With the initiative, the President has made an unhesitating

Apple Marketing Manager Phil Roybal called "the only purely origi
nal idea that 1 heard from him during the time he was with Apple."
In Jeffrey Young's biography of Jobs, Roybal recalls a seminal conver
sation between himself and Jobs at an annual sales conference in
Hawaii.
"Look, it's time to get computers into the schools," Jobs said,
according to Roybal. "We've got to do it now — the kids can't wait.
I ve been thinking about this. Why can't we just give away a comput
er to every school in the country? We'll get all sorts of good publicity
and a tax break, and we'll get our systems in front of hundreds of
thousands of kids."
Roybal remembers trying to tell Jobs that "the laws of donations
were such that a manufacturer could only take credit for the raw mate
rials involved."
Jobs response was terse and determined: " Then we'll change the
law."
He set about to do just that, pushing for a rewriting of U.S. rax
law to allow full-value deductions for technology donations. Jobs was
nt making a great deal of progress until he met California
Congressman Pete Stark on a cross-country plane trip and hyped his
plans to the lawmaker. Soon Stark was sponsoring legislation to grant
Apple and other computer companies new tax breaks for donating
personal computers to American schools, a bill dubbed "The Kids
Can't Wait."
But Jobs was stymied by public skepticism. Lawmakers, con
stituents, scholars and journalists came out against the measure —
some unsure about the virtues of computers in education and virtual
ly all suspicious of Apple's motives. U.S. Education Secretary Terrel
Bell called the push to bring computers into schools "almost a fad."
Cultural critics like Theodore Roszak went at high-tech companies
like Apple with white gloves decidedly off. "In an effort to prime the
pump for future sales of its product, the computer industry is cur
rently making its wares massively available to universities and entire
school systems at cut rate or free of charge, Roszak wrote in 1983.
"For the most part, schools. . .have responded with the promptness
and the gullibility of well-trained consumers to the commercial pres
sure of the computer industry."
Despite Jobs' personal lobbying efforts, the U.S. Congress defeat
ed his "The Kids Can't Wait bill and refused to grant Apple's $64 mil
lion tax credit. Critics across the country - in newspaper editorials and
PIA meetings — accused Apple of using children to sell computers to
parents, and donating machines for profitable tax credits. Apple
defended its plan as a symbiotic blend of educational philanthropy
and shrewd business sense; critics acknowledged only the latter.
Fast-forward little more than a decade to September of 1995.
President Bill Clinton, on a pre-campaign sweep through California,
announced the President's Educational lechnology Initiative, a plan
to place a computer linked to the Internet in every American class
room by the year 2000. Clinton pledged that by the end of the 1995-
96 school year, Inrcrnet-capable computers would be placed in 50,000
California classrooms. Department of Education officials estimated
the cost of the national initiative at about $10 billion, with $2 billion
of federal funds to "augment about four times as much" raised
through private means or through local communities (read "corporate
grants.") But a study conducted by McKinsey and Company — an
accounting firm for the National Infrastructure Advisory Council —
said "the cost of providing computers for all classrooms would range
from between $11 billion for a computer laboratory used by groups of
students to $47 billion for Clinton's program."
With the initiative, the President has made an unhesitating
endorsement of "public-private partnerships" in the classroom.

Indeed, Clinton effusively described corporate efforts to outfit class
rooms with technical gear as "high-tech barn-raising." The California
effort, for example, involves no federal moneys; the computer hard
ware, software, training and Internet access costs will be donated by
high-technology companies and others in the private sector.
Contributing companies include Apple Computer, the Hewlett-
Packard Corporation, the Oracle Corporation, IBM, Sun-
Microsystems and a host of other Silicon Valley heavyweights.
1 he Clinton plan calls for high-tech corporations to assume a role
in national education very similar to the one Steve Jobs tried to create
15 years ago. But this time, politicians, the public and the media have

been largely silent and, often, encouraging.
It is as if the Apple debate of the early 1980s
never took place. The inherent good of
"partnering" corporate interests with the
national educational agenda seems to have
been accepted as self-evident; indeed,
Clinton does not shy away from linking the
two in his popular rhetoric, but in fact
often emphasizes a vision of the private sec
tor as both an authoritative and an appro
priate voice in the American educational
system.
" I hese companies who compete vig
orously every day in the marketplace have
come together in the classroom," Clinton
proclaimed proudly in September, "Our
administration has brought these compa
nies together, we have set goals, bur they
are doing the rest." In the same speech, he
makes the robust claim that "children with
access to computers learn faster and learn
better," citing impressive statistics that

"prove" — among other things — that comptuer learning causes
standardized test scores to rise by 10 to 15 percent. These numbers
become more suspect, however, when one realizes that they were
taken from a 10-year study called "Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow" by
Apple Computer's Education division. Most educational scholars,
however, agree that comprehensive and definitive reserach on the
effectiveness of computer learning has not yet been completed, and
that, at any rate, the benefits of computer-aided education may be
such that traditional scoring methods like standardized tests cannor
accurately measure them.
Newspaper editorials, like this one from the Christian Science
Monitor, gush that "political backing, business participation. . .and
enthusiastic students, teachers and parents could yet combine to make
the president's goal reachable." The Department of Education did

hold a series of regional forums, inviting
hundreds of citizens to discuss the
President's plans. But, according to govern

did hold a series of regional forums, inviting hundreds of citizens to
discuss the President s plans. But, according to government reports
documenting the meetings, not one delegate questioned partnerships

on word processing, one middle school technology coordinator admit
ted. Small cash grants for what one teacher termed "glue expenses" are
also missing from most grants. Apple claimed to have fully wired one
inner-city classroom for the Internet, but - when 1 visited — 1 saw that
only one of the grants' 20 or so computers is actually Internet capable.
I he teacher just shook his head when I asked about the discrepancy, say
ing that his school could not come up with a few hundred dollars for
coaxial cable and other basic connection materials.
1 here is nothing inherently wrong or unethical about corporate
grant programs to schools, just as there is nothing inherently right or
valuable about them. But there is something terribly wrong with the pos
sibility that corporate grant programs — "partners" in a national initia
tive — might be lowering the quality of students' education or con
tributing to social inequality between children in public schools with
their donations.
We must ask corporate grant programs which ally themselves with
Clinton's program to make three basic moral commitments. First, com
panies must try to make sure that their donation programs are benefit
ing — or not, at least, harming — education. This objective seems best
accomplished through the establishment of comprehensive grant pro
grams, like Oracle's. One teacher at an Oracle grant school went so far as
to say that, without the on-going technical support and relief substitute
teachers that the company provides, the equipment would "cause more
trouble than it's worth." Donating computer hardware is just the first
step toward impacting education in a positive way. If a company stops
there, its donation could very well have a negative impact on education
quality. leacher training, regular on-site support visits and cash grants
help ensure that students are not harmed by corporate information tech
nology donations.
At the same time, companies that wish to be "partners" with the
national educational system must ensure that their programs do not
exacerbate racial, ethnic and socio-economic divisions in society. They
must also avoid programs that arc essentially a means to market com
puters to parents. These latter two ethical objectives are — in many ways
— joined at the hip. Programs which target under-represented racial and
ethnic minorities and students from poor and working class families do
not typically spend a great deal of time or effort marketing their wares to
parents. On the other hand, insidious marketing messages and strategies
are often integral parts of programs which do not target under-privileged
groups.
c
V yliftord Stoll, author of the best-seller Silicon Snake Oil\ has said 011
several occasion that he feels like a voice in the wilderness with his cri
tique of the "Information Super Highway" and all of its rhetorical trap
pings. "I just ask questions," he says of his work, "questions that it seems
to me should have answers. I get worried when those of us buying into
this revolution, this Information Revolution, don't have those answers
and are so bothered by the questions." Indeed, Stoll is among very few
asking questions about the role of corporate grant programs in the
President's Educational Technology Initiative: "There's this culture of
computing that says we know what's best for everyone else. . .We're the
experts in everything," he said. "I find this offensive. What do Apple or
Microsoft know about teaching in a classroom? Tell me how Bill Gates
knows what schools and colleges need. Does he have teaching creden
tials? What is his insight into the needs of a classroom?
Certainly, given Stoll's stand on the detrimental effects of computers
in the classroom, it was something of a given that he would find (Clinton's
program objectionable. But his basic point is well taken: surrendering
even part of a government responsibility as fundamental and valuable as
public education to big corporations with private interests is a dangerous
proposition.
If we, as a nation, wish to proceed with the President's technology
plan, that procedure must be a very cautious one. The task of building
ethical, equitable public-private partnerships has always been difficult, to
say the least. But throw the tremendous burden of our children's educa
tion into the mix and the challenging work of striking a balance becomes
critical and treacherous. Any initiative that claims to merge the best
interests of children with the best interests of corporations should raise
eyebrows and suspicions. 1 hat coupling should prompt a red flag for
journalists, educators and concerned citizens. It is disturbing (and symp
tomatic of a larger problem: Americans' unquestioning fascination with

information technologies) that so very few have stepped forward with the
kind of basic, evaluative questions about this program that Stoll urges
Americans to ask about technology.
It may not be fair or realistic to expect big business to act in a way
that is not fundamentally sMf-interested. The scholastic market is large

and growing: in the 1993-94 school year
alone, American k-12 public schools spent an
estimated $2.43 billion 011 educational hard
ware and software. But we can ask and rea
sonably expect that companies participating
in Clintons federal program will adhere to
three basic ethical criteria:
1. their programs must help — or at least not
harm — a student's education;
2. their programs must not exacerbate soci
ety's racial and socio-economic divisions;
3. their programs must not overtly use the
classroom as an extension of the market
place, a venue for commercial computer
sales.
It is more than fair for 11s to demand
that companies participating in Clinton's
program meet these standards; to borrow

from the famous ruling on corporate philanthropy and education, A.P.
Smith v. Harlow, "it amounts to a solemn duty. For how could we accept
as policy a national educational program which does not?
Even if a corporate grant program tailors its program to meet the
above objectives, keep in mind that it still has still only met a very basic
set of ethical requirements. 'I'here is a larger, fundamental question, a
question lurking just below the surface in computer labs and classrooms
across the country: Do we want computers in the classroom? As one Bay
Area teacher confided, " There is so much money and effort and so many
freebies going out to promote computers in school," she said. "I'm so
tired of seeing the technology take center stage. Its strange to me that this
is what we think is appropriate in a child's education and. . .in public
schools."
Intuitions, political rhetoric and cyber-hypc about the dawning
"Information Age' do not give us real answers. We need more firm,
definitive research to guide our decisions. Instead of initiating a national
drive for "computers in the classroom, — analogous, as many politi

cians have suggested, to the Race to Space
of the 1960s — perhaps we should first
inaugurate a national effort to leant about
computers in the classroom. Apple

Although his "The Kids Can't Wait" bill failed, Stark has remained an
enthusiastic proponent of partnerships between high-tech companies
and educational communities. During a visit to a San Francisco school
in 1982, Stark reportedly took it upon himself to demonstrate that any
one can use an Apple Computer to learn geography. I le asked an eager
student at the computer to type in "San Francisco" for a description of
the city. But, even after several attempts, the student could not spell "San
Francisco."
Even an ethical program of computer grants may not be the educa
tional panacea for which we are so desperately searching. As one teacher
at a very poor, local school put it: At some point, somebody has to say,
'The Emperor has no clothes. "

in the classroom. Indeed, Clinton effusively described cor
porate efforts to outfit classrooms with technical gear as
"high-tech barn-raising.' I he California effort, for example,
involves no federal moneys; the computer hardware, soft
ware, training and Internet access costs will be donated by
high-technology companies and others in the private sector.
Contributing companies include Apple Computer, the
Hewlett-Packard Corporation, the Oracle Corporation,
IBM, Sun-Microsvstems and a host of other Silicon \alley
heavyweights.
The Clinton plan calls for high-tech corporations to
assume a role in national education very similar to the one
Steve Jobs tried to create 15 years ago. But this time, politi
cians, the public and the media have been largely silent and,
often, encouraging. It is as if the Apple debate of the early
19X0S never took place. The inherent good of "partnering

corporate interests with the national educational agenda seems to
have been accepted as self-evident; indeed, Clinton does not shy away
from linking the two in his popular rhetoric, but in fact often empha
sizes a vision of the private sector as both an authoritative and .111
appropriate voice in the American educational system.
"These companies who compete vigorously every day in the
marketplace have come together in the classroom," Clinton pro
claimed proudly in September, "Our administration has brought
these companies together, we have set goals, but they are doing the
rest." In the same speech, he makes the robust claim that "children
with access to computers learn faster and learn better," citing impres
sive statistics that "prove" — among other things — that computer
learning causes standardized test scores to rise by 10 to 15 percent.
These numbers become more suspect, however, when one realizes
that they were taken from a 10-vear study called "Apple Classrooms of
Tomorrow" by Apple Computers Education division. Most educa
tional scholars, however, agree that comprehensive and definitive
reserach on the effectiveness of computer learning has not yet been
completed, and that, at any rate, the benefits of computer-aided edu
cation may be such that traditional scoring methods like standardized
tests cannor accurately measure them.
Newspaper editorials, like this one from the Christian Science
Monitor, gush that "political backing, business participation. . .and
enthusiastic students, teachers and parents could yet combine to
make the presidents goal reachable." The Department of Education
did hold a series of regional forums, inviting hundreds of citizens to
discuss the President s plans. But, according to government reports
documenting the meetings, not one delegate questioned partnerships

on word processing, one middle school technology coordinator admit
ted. Small cash grants for what one teacher termed "glue expenses" are
also missing from most grants. Apple claimed to have fully wired one
inner-city classroom for the Internet, but - when 1 visited — 1 saw that
only one of the grants' 20 or so computers is actually Internet capable.
I he teacher just shook his head when I asked about the discrepancy, say
ing that his school could not come up with a few hundred dollars for
coaxial cable and other basic connection materials.
1 here is nothing inherently wrong or unethical about corporate
grant programs to schools, just as there is nothing inherently right or
valuable about them. But there is something terribly wrong with the pos
sibility that corporate grant programs — "partners" in a national initia
tive — might be lowering the quality of students' education or con
tributing to social inequality between children in public schools with
their donations.
We must ask corporate grant programs which ally themselves with
Clinton's program to make three basic moral commitments. First, com
panies must try to make sure that their donation programs are benefit
ing — or not, at least, harming — education. This objective seems best
accomplished through the establishment of comprehensive grant pro
grams, like Oracle's. One teacher at an Oracle grant school went so far as
to say that, without the on-going technical support and relief substitute
teachers that the company provides, the equipment would "cause more
trouble than it's worth." Donating computer hardware is just the first
step toward impacting education in a positive way. If a company stops
there, its donation could very well have a negative impact on education
quality. leacher training, regular on-site support visits and cash grants
help ensure that students are not harmed by corporate information tech
nology donations.
At the same time, companies that wish to be "partners" with the
national educational system must ensure that their programs do not
exacerbate racial, ethnic and socio-economic divisions in society. They
must also avoid programs that arc essentially a means to market com
puters to parents. These latter two ethical objectives are — in many ways
— joined at the hip. Programs which target under-represented racial and
ethnic minorities and students from poor and working class families do
not typically spend a great deal of time or effort marketing their wares to
parents. On the other hand, insidious marketing messages and strategies
are often integral parts of programs which do not target under-privileged
groups.
c
V yliftord Stoll, author of the best-seller Silicon Snake Oil\ has said 011
several occasion that he feels like a voice in the wilderness with his cri
tique of the "Information Super Highway" and all of its rhetorical trap
pings. "I just ask questions," he says of his work, "questions that it seems
to me should have answers. I get worried when those of us buying into
this revolution, this Information Revolution, don't have those answers
and are so bothered by the questions." Indeed, Stoll is among very few
asking questions about the role of corporate grant programs in the
President's Educational Technology Initiative: "There's this culture of
computing that says we know what's best for everyone else. . .We're the
experts in everything," he said. "I find this offensive. What do Apple or
Microsoft know about teaching in a classroom? Tell me how Bill Gates
knows what schools and colleges need. Does he have teaching creden
tials? What is his insight into the needs of a classroom?
Certainly, given Stoll's stand on the detrimental effects of computers
in the classroom, it was something of a given that he would find (Clinton's
program objectionable. But his basic point is well taken: surrendering
even part of a government responsibility as fundamental and valuable as
public education to big corporations with private interests is a dangerous
proposition.
If we, as a nation, wish to proceed with the President's technology
plan, that procedure must be a very cautious one. The task of building
ethical, equitable public-private partnerships has always been difficult, to
say the least. But throw the tremendous burden of our children's educa
tion into the mix and the challenging work of striking a balance becomes
critical and treacherous. Any initiative that claims to merge the best
interests of children with the best interests of corporations should raise
eyebrows and suspicions. 1 hat coupling should prompt a red flag for
journalists, educators and concerned citizens. It is disturbing (and symp
tomatic of a larger problem: Americans' unquestioning fascination with

information technologies) that so very few have stepped forward with the
kind of basic, evaluative questions about this program that Stoll urges
Americans to ask about technology.
It may not be fair or realistic to expect big business to act in a way
that is not fundamentally sMf-interested. The scholastic market is large

and growing: in the 1993-94 school year
alone, American k-12 public schools spent an
estimated $2.43 billion 011 educational hard
ware and software. But we can ask and rea
sonably expect that companies participating
in Clintons federal program will adhere to
three basic ethical criteria:
1. their programs must help — or at least not
harm — a student's education;
2. their programs must not exacerbate soci
ety's racial and socio-economic divisions;
3. their programs must not overtly use the
classroom as an extension of the market
place, a venue for commercial computer
sales.
It is more than fair for 11s to demand
that companies participating in Clinton's
program meet these standards; to borrow

COLLEGES NEED," ASKS

from the famous ruling on corporate philanthropy and education, A.P.
Smith v. Harlow, "it amounts to a solemn duty. For how could we accept
as policy a national educational program which does not?
Even if a corporate grant program tailors its program to meet the
above objectives, keep in mind that it still has still only met a very basic
set of ethical requirements. 'I'here is a larger, fundamental question, a
question lurking just below the surface in computer labs and classrooms
across the country: Do we want computers in the classroom? As one Bay
Area teacher confided, " There is so much money and effort and so many
freebies going out to promote computers in school," she said. "I'm so
tired of seeing the technology take center stage. Its strange to me that this
is what we think is appropriate in a child's education and. . .in public
schools."
Intuitions, political rhetoric and cyber-hypc about the dawning
"Information Age' do not give us real answers. We need more firm,
definitive research to guide our decisions. Instead of initiating a national
drive for "computers in the classroom, — analogous, as many politi

cians have suggested, to the Race to Space
of the 1960s — perhaps we should first
inaugurate a national effort to leant about
computers in the classroom. Apple

he can turn to for statistical data about
classroom technology in his speeches, as
he did last September.

with Apples Steve Jobs — wanted to
make it easier for high-technology compa
nies to donate equipment to schools?

Although his "The Kids Can't Wait" bill failed, Stark has remained an
enthusiastic proponent of partnerships between high-tech companies
and educational communities. During a visit to a San Francisco school
in 1982, Stark reportedly took it upon himself to demonstrate that any
one can use an Apple Computer to learn geography. I le asked an eager
student at the computer to type in "San Francisco" for a description of
the city. But, even after several attempts, the student could not spell "San
Francisco."
Even an ethical program of computer grants may not be the educa
tional panacea for which we are so desperately searching. As one teacher
at a very poor, local school put it: At some point, somebody has to say,
'The Emperor has no clothes. "
