## The
						Kids Can Wait With President Clintons blessing, computer companies are flooding public schools with free technology. Is this corporate philanthropy — or commerical philandering? 
### Colleen Krueger 
In 1981, Apple Computer founder Steve Jobs — already aware of his
company's primacy in the educational market — had what former
Apple Marketing Manager Phil Roybal called "the only purely origi
nal idea that 1 heard from him during the time he was with Apple."
In Jeffrey Young's biography of Jobs, Roybal recalls a seminal conver
sation between himself and Jobs at an annual sales conference in
Hawaii.
"Look, it's time to get computers into the schools," Jobs said,
according to Roybal. "We've got to do it now — the kids can't wait.
I ve been thinking about this. Why can't we just give away a comput
er to every school in the country? We'll get all sorts of good publicity
and a tax break, and we'll get our systems in front of hundreds of
thousands of kids."
Roybal remembers trying to tell Jobs that "the laws of donations
were such that a manufacturer could only take credit for the raw mate
rials involved."
Jobs response was terse and determined: " Then we'll change the
law."
He set about to do just that, pushing for a rewriting of U.S. rax
law to allow full-value deductions for technology donations. Jobs was
nt making a great deal of progress until he met California
Congressman Pete Stark on a cross-country plane trip and hyped his
plans to the lawmaker. Soon Stark was sponsoring legislation to grant
Apple and other computer companies new tax breaks for donating
personal computers to American schools, a bill dubbed "The Kids
Can't Wait."
But Jobs was stymied by public skepticism. Lawmakers, con
stituents, scholars and journalists came out against the measure —
some unsure about the virtues of computers in education and virtual
ly all suspicious of Apple's motives. U.S. Education Secretary Terrel
Bell called the push to bring computers into schools "almost a fad."
Cultural critics like Theodore Roszak went at high-tech companies
like Apple with white gloves decidedly off. "In an effort to prime the
pump for future sales of its product, the computer industry is cur
rently making its wares massively available to universities and entire
school systems at cut rate or free of charge, Roszak wrote in 1983.
"For the most part, schools. . .have responded with the promptness
and the gullibility of well-trained consumers to the commercial pres
sure of the computer industry."
Despite Jobs' personal lobbying efforts, the U.S. Congress defeat
ed his "The Kids Can't Wait bill and refused to grant Apple's $64 mil
lion tax credit. Critics across the country - in newspaper editorials and
PIA meetings — accused Apple of using children to sell computers to
parents, and donating machines for profitable tax credits. Apple
defended its plan as a symbiotic blend of educational philanthropy
and shrewd business sense; critics acknowledged only the latter.
Fast-forward little more than a decade to September of 1995.
President Bill Clinton, on a pre-campaign sweep through California,
announced the President's Educational lechnology Initiative, a plan
to place a computer linked to the Internet in every American class
room by the year 2000. Clinton pledged that by the end of the 1995-
96 school year, Inrcrnet-capable computers would be placed in 50,000
California classrooms. Department of Education officials estimated
the cost of the national initiative at about $10 billion, with $2 billion
of federal funds to "augment about four times as much" raised
through private means or through local communities (read "corporate
grants.") But a study conducted by McKinsey and Company — an
accounting firm for the National Infrastructure Advisory Council —
said "the cost of providing computers for all classrooms would range
from between $11 billion for a computer laboratory used by groups of
students to $47 billion for Clinton's program."
With the initiative, the President has made an unhesitating
endorsement of "public-private partnerships" in the classroom.

Indeed, Clinton effusively described corporate efforts to outfit class
rooms with technical gear as "high-tech barn-raising." The California
effort, for example, involves no federal moneys; the computer hard
ware, software, training and Internet access costs will be donated by
high-technology companies and others in the private sector.
Contributing companies include Apple Computer, the Hewlett-
Packard Corporation, the Oracle Corporation, IBM, Sun-
Microsystems and a host of other Silicon Valley heavyweights.
1 he Clinton plan calls for high-tech corporations to assume a role
in national education very similar to the one Steve Jobs tried to create
15 years ago. But this time, politicians, the public and the media have

been largely silent and, often, encouraging.
It is as if the Apple debate of the early 1980s
never took place. The inherent good of
"partnering" corporate interests with the
national educational agenda seems to have
been accepted as self-evident; indeed,
Clinton does not shy away from linking the
two in his popular rhetoric, but in fact
often emphasizes a vision of the private sec
tor as both an authoritative and an appro
priate voice in the American educational
system.
" I hese companies who compete vig
orously every day in the marketplace have
come together in the classroom," Clinton
proclaimed proudly in September, "Our
administration has brought these compa
nies together, we have set goals, bur they
are doing the rest." In the same speech, he
makes the robust claim that "children with
access to computers learn faster and learn
better," citing impressive statistics that

"prove" — among other things — that comptuer learning causes
standardized test scores to rise by 10 to 15 percent. These numbers
become more suspect, however, when one realizes that they were
taken from a 10-year study called "Apple Classrooms of Tomorrow" by
Apple Computer's Education division. Most educational scholars,
however, agree that comprehensive and definitive reserach on the
effectiveness of computer learning has not yet been completed, and
that, at any rate, the benefits of computer-aided education may be
such that traditional scoring methods like standardized tests cannor
accurately measure them.
Newspaper editorials, like this one from the Christian Science
Monitor, gush that "political backing, business participation. . .and
enthusiastic students, teachers and parents could yet combine to make
the president's goal reachable." The Department of Education did

hold a series of regional forums, inviting
hundreds of citizens to discuss the
President's plans. But, according to govern
ment reports documenting the meetings,
not one delegate questioned partnerships
between businesses and schools. (These
forums were, however, sponsored by a num
ber of high-technology companies, includ
ing Microsoft, IBM, U.S. WEST, Sprint,
Compaq, and, our old friend, Apple

Computer.) Likewise, recent studies on classroom technology and
such partnerships from both the Rand Institute and the National
Academy of Sciences utter not a single discouraging or wary word
about the marriage of corporate and educational interests in America.
Apple may have lost the battle in the mid-1980s, but it has won
the war. In the last decade, others have followed Apple's lead and part
nerships between high-tech companies and school communities are
quite common. Widespread public suspicion about the altruistic
