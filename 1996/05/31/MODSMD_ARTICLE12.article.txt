IHE ELECTION OF 1994 THE REPUBLICAN REVOLUTION

was a big surprise to me and to many Americans, including some
Republicans. But, as a historian, I ought not have been surprised,
lor in retrospect, the rejection of Big Government (Bill Clinton
has endorsed that, too), was not an aberration as many liberal
Democrats believed, but a return to a much earlier conception of
American politics. And when 1 say "earlier, 1 mean back to the
founding of the country in the late 1 Sth century.
After all, the genius of American politics, to use a good
19th-century term, has always been to fear concentrated central
power. I hat was the way America began — with a revolution th.it
overthrew London's controls and regulations imposed upon the
colonies. Indeed, the alternative government which Americans
designed during the revolution was the loose and impractical
Articles of ( onfederation. For some Americans that was much too
weak and so they came up with our present Constitution. But as
subsequent history soon revealed, national power was neither spec
ified nor often used. 1 he states were the primarv agencies of gov
ernment; the people tended their own affairs with only a mini
mum of restrictions from the central government. The whole pur
pose of the system was to let individuals and their families deter
mine their destinies. The only time during the whole 19th centu
ry that the federal government was needed in domestic affairs in a
large way was the threat from slaver) and Southern secession. The
Civil War and the emancipation of slaves constituted the first
instance of "Big Clovcrnment" since the founding of the Republic.
After the Civil War, for a while Northerners were willing to exer
cise national power over the former Confederate states. Within 10
years, however, Reconstruction was abandoned, largely on the
ground that such an imposition of military forces bv the federal
government on the southern states was not consonant with the
historic nature of the American union.
After Reconstruction no comparable instances of Big
(lovcrnment occurred until the opening of the 20th century, when
certain forces that had the same crisis impact as secession, aroused
public and political attention to the necessity to bolster federal
authority. Among those forces was the Depression of 1893, the first

major economic crisis since the United States became a major
industrial society. Unemployment, widespread social disruption,
and a new political parry (the Populists) coalesced to threaten the
status quo and to call upon the federal government to recognize
that the country had become an advanced industrial and urban
society that needed national attention. I he result wa s the so
called Progressive movement led by Republican Theodore
Roosevelt and Democrat Woodrow Wilson, who advanced solu
tions through an extension of federal authority, including regula
tions over railroads, banking (the Federal Reserve), labor unions,
and monotioring of drugs and purity of foods. By 1920, however,
the American people had lost interest in Big Government nad
turned once again to the states. It took another and bigger depres
sion for Americans to recognize that federal action might again be
required. 1 he Great Depression of the 1930s lasted for almost a
decade, despite the Big Government (New Deal) of Franklin
Roosevelt. Prosperity actually arrived only when Big Government
needed to fight a four-year global war and then an even longer
Cold War. Indeed, for a while during those 50 years or so, it
seemed as if the American people were steadily losing their ancient
fear of centralized power in Washington.
I hat turned out not to be true with the end of the Cold
War and the collapse of the Soviet Unon. Soon thereafter came the
1994 Republican upheaval in Congress. All bets on the persistence
or value of Big Government were off. The true meaning of the
Republican triumph in 1994 was that Americans had once again
returned to their fear of central power in Washington, a fear they
had worried about and which had shaped their political institu
tions from the beginning.
Consider those beginnings especially when we look at the
political institutions of other advanced democratic societies. From
the outset of the Republic, it was determined that the executive
and the legislature would be divided, indeed, divided so sharply
that without political parties — which did not exist at that time
— to link the president and Congress, deadlock was to be expectd.
No advanced industrial democracy in Europe has such a system.

siiice the executive is drawn from the majority party in parliament. Thus
in 1 uropean democracies there could not he any shutting down of gov
ernment because of disagreement between legislative and executive
authorities, as has happened several times in the United States. But that
American division of authority is precisely what we wanted in our i7S~
C onstitution and still want today. I hen. too. Americans created an
unrepresentative Senate that was given equal legislative authority with the
popularly elected I louse, as no other 1 uropean legislature permits. For
Americans, however, that equality in power certainly slows down legisla
tion and perhaps denies desirable legislation. It serves Americans well in
keeping down the efficiency of government.
From the beginning, in short, Americans have perceived the fed
eral government as a threat to their freedom, just as they first saw Britain's
empire as a danger to their personal and economic freedom. It was not
accidental, for example, th.it when Southern leaders on the eve of the
Civil War justified their secession to the North, they saw themselves as
following in the footsteps of their fathers who had fought the Revolution
against the central authority of King George.
Alwavs in America there has been a states rights defense at the
highest level of politics, first with the Democratic party until the days of
Woodrow Wilson, and then with the Republicans under the banner of
1 lerebert 1 foover. During the first years of the Depression Hoover denied
any fedeal aid to the unemployed on the ground that it would repudiate
Americans' sense of self-reliance upon which, lie asserted, the Republic
had been founded. I 100 vers anti-government message did not make an
impact upon Americans in the midst of the Depression. Yet once the
post-war prosperity began to spread across the country, Hoovers fear of
Washington's overweening domincnace came to be increasingly recognized.
Even in the days of an apparently triumphant federal authority
at the time of Lyndon Johnsons (Jreat Society and the Cold War, Senator
Barry Goldwater raised the flag of states rights. I lis message was success
full)' picked up a little later by Ronald Reagan, whose contention that the
federal government was the problem, not the solution, soon became pop
ular. And that popularity was no idle sentiment since most Americans
elected Regan president but gave the Democrats control of Congress.
During the so years since the end of the New Deal, only three
of the io presidents have enjoyed a Congress of the same party. I hat pat
tern provides a good measure of the American peoples belief that, even
during the days of" the Cold War, a limited federal government is essen

rial. It shows, too, tli.it Americans are cjnite- prepared to accept gridlock
.uul frustration — though nor without loud complaints — than to lose
their individual and entrepreneurial freedom because of controls and reg
ulations from .1 overly centralized government. The Fact is. however, that
the checks and balances system Americans created at the outset of their
historv remains today a major source of the deadlock that presently
bedevils so many voters.
It is also worth recognizing that our system of divided govern
ment helps to account for our looser social safety net than that provided
by the European democracies. We still lack a national health program, a
national family program for working mothers, the generous unemploy
ment benefits and vacations that Europeans take for granted. And, of
course, they pay much higher taxes than Americans will accept.
What might we conclude from this historical exercise? lor one
thing it suggests that, given the American concern with freedom, the
kind of social safety net that Europeans enjoy is not likely to take place
here. And the reason is that without some kind of crisis like the Cireat
I depression or a major war, Americans will neither want nor need to draw
upon the full panoply of federal power. For to do so would be to violate
their historical charcter as a people. And since no crisis situations seem in
the offing, I think the traditional division between Congress and
President, and between Senate and 1 louse will continue to bring dead
lock and popular discontent, as it certainly has over the last few decades.
One sign of Americans' deep acceptance of divided government even
today can be seen in a New York' Times poll last April. I he poll reported
that if the Republicans continued to hold majorties in both houses of
Congress, a majority of voters preferred that Bill Clinton be re-elected,
presumably to check the Congress! Only a little more than a third of
Americans thought that a Republican Congress deserved a Republican pres
ident! It seems not accidental that Clinton has been gingerly moving closer
to Republican programs and policies. In short, given where Americans have
been and now are, this year's election will probably follow the historical
political trend among voters — limit national power to preserve freedom.
Or to put the matter in the form of a concrete political prediction: the elec
tion will see the continuation of the Republican "revolution" in Congress,
but it will be controlled by the re-election of Bill Clinton.
