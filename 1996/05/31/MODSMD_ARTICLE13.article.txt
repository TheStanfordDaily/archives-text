## Paper Trail How a Women's Center protest went unseen 
### Jennifer Silva 
n April }0, 16 members of the Stanford community — includ
ing law students, graduates in psychology, undeclared frosh, sorority
members, athletes and more — gathered to raise student conscious
ness about the issues and status of women on campus. In particular,
the group had come together to put up 11 different flyers around cam
pus — flyers which provided some less than attractive facts about
Stanford's dedication to women, listed the needs and safety concerns
of women on campus and detailed the eftect of the defeat of the
Women's Collective's special fee in the ASSU election.
The flyers were placed on roads from living spaces all over cam
pus — including the Row, Governors Corner, and Kimball — lead
ing to the Women's Center. From there, a single trail was to lead up
the stairs of Tresidder Union and into a conference room where " lea
and More Cookies,' an open forum with University President
(ierhard ("asper, was to take place the next afternoon. It was there that

supporters of the women's communi
ty could explain to the president face
to face why they believed the
University is responsible for main
taining a stable, well-staffed, mobi
lized resource center for women. As
they traveled the campus late that
night, the group was thanked and
applauded for its efforts by students
who expressed surprise .11 some of the

statistics, but mostly were just pleased
tli.it they were taking a stand and making their collective voice heard.
On the morning of lea and C 'ookies, nearly all of the flyers on the
ground had been removed. Apparently a University policy exists stat
ing that flyers are not allowed 011 the ground on campus, nor are they
allowed 011 doors, windows, or other specified surfaces. Most startling
to the Women's Center (a term I use literally to describe the building
space, since the only Women's Center employee was out of the state)
was the revelation that a $4.6-an-hour fee had been levied against the
center to pay for the cost of groundskeeping crews' removal of the fly
ers.
Many women, including myself, were outraged that this little
known and rarely enforced policy was being applied. But whv should
anybody care that flyers were removed from White Plaza, especially in
light of the fact that a policy exists regarding appropriate flyering? The
only removed flyers were from the women's community and the queer
community, which implies a targeting of these groups by the
University. I he University's policy, when selectively enforced in cases
like these, has the potential effect of silencing students on certain
issues.
Few modes of rapid mass communication outside of flyering arc
available to students. Posting email messages to everybody.on.cam
pus@lists or maybe hanging one big poster on the White Plaza kiosk
that "everybody looks at" are among the impractical options.
Admittedly, the women's center could have included statistics tin
women's issues in the ASSU election ballot handbooks, which would
have reached the enormous percentage of student voters. Lining flyers
on the ground from Grove to Toyon to Governors Corner seemed a
plausible solution. The truth is, there is no effective way of reaching
the entire campus on short notice.
The response to the women's center flyer campaign illustrates that
even if you try to poster the campus, the University may charge you
for clean-up. That is, it you present a proper threat. As I was flyering
that night I saw old election flyers, Euro-Trash party flyers, and more.
For the record, were those groups asked for $46 an hour to remove
those posters? Of course not. Those posters were not removed. There
was no labor cost involved.

So whar was removed? The giant pink Q on the ground in honor
of the BGLAD celebration, as well as the flyers from the women's
community. Why? How come those little stars from the Hollywood
party got to stay long enough for most of you to understand this ref
erence? Why were the Housejacks a cappella posters allowed to stay?
Was it because they paid the $46 in advance? Was it because they fol
io weiH'p raced u re?" Or was it because they had a safer, less disruptive
message? Following the removal of the flyers on women's issues, a large
chalk ad for an a cappella Spring show remained in White Plaza for
an entire day. Flyers for both a party and a lay Sachs testing remained
around Braun Music Building for over a week. I hat some messages
remain untouched while others are swept up raises at least the suspi
cion of double standards.
For the record, these are the posters that went missing
from campus the day Casper met with students:
1. No Fee, No Funds
2. No Funds, No Phones
3. Percentage of tenured professors who are women: 15%
4. Does the University support the Women's Center?
5. Support the Women's Center
6. Number of people not welcomed at the Women's Center: 0
7. Number of housed sororities: 0
8. Nobody gets date raped at Stanford, right?
9. 1 low many times have you traveled home on a dark path?
10. Ways to fund the Women's Center: ASSU Fees, Bake Sale, etc.
n. Programs lost with the special fee:
CiWN, Herstory, Womenspeak, etc.
I he largest issue is not so much whar the posters said. Its that the
University is able to stop student activist efforts in our own commu
nity. I live on the Row and flyered there, and those posters were
removed by the next morning. Shouldn't we as students be able to
spread information in our own living spaces?
A few weeks after the incident, I was prompted to write a letter to
the Daily in which I included many of the ideas and sentiments
expressed here. The letter was never published, hut it was passed along
to several email lists and eventually 1 received back some words of
appreciation for my efforts, as well as some criticisms of my logic.
It was written out of anger and, because of that, was a bit rash in
its judgments of the University. However, after a couple of weeks of
paying careful attention to groundskeeping policy enforcement, I feel
I was mostly right. But I concede that I came to some unfounded
harsh conclusions.
In retrospect, I want to make clear that I do not think the
University is out to get any community on campus. What 1 do believe
is that the quick and punitive nature of the clean-up suggests that
there was more than a sign policy motivating it. It seems like a moot
point to argue the intentions, however, as the outcome is all that is
left. Shortly after 1 wrote the letter, advocates for the women's center
succeeded in having the $46 per hour groundskeeping fee dropped.
In the end, the flyers were never seen, the president was well
prepped for Tea and Cookies and has made a pledge to fund a pro
posal from the Women's Center, and very few people on campus
know anything ever happened. Regardless of why the flyers were
removed, the action was a distinctly unusual application of a little
known and rarely enforced policy. The lessons are still cause for atten
tion and concern. Whether or not there was a master plan to remove
the information on the flyers laid down that night — and I concede
there probably was not — the University is obviously capable of
choosing, at least on some level, what can be seen and read and what
can not.

women's issues in the ASSU election ballot handbooks, which would
have reached the enormous percentage of student voters. Lining flyers
on the ground from Grove to Toyon to Governors Corner seemed a
plausible solution. The truth is, there is no effective way of reaching
the entire campus on short notice.
The response to the women's center flyer campaign illustrates that
even if you try to poster the campus, the University may charge you
for clean-up. That is, it you present a proper threat. As I was flyering
that night I saw old election flyers, Euro-Trash party flyers, and more.
For the record, were those groups asked for $46 an hour to remove
those posters? Of course not. Those posters were not removed. There
was no labor cost involved.

So whar was removed? The giant pink Q on the ground in honor
of the BGLAD celebration, as well as the flyers from the women's
community. Why? How come those little stars from the Hollywood
party got to stay long enough for most of you to understand this ref
erence? Why were the Housejacks a cappella posters allowed to stay?
Was it because they paid the $46 in advance? Was it because they fol
io weiH'p raced u re?" Or was it because they had a safer, less disruptive
message? Following the removal of the flyers on women's issues, a large
chalk ad for an a cappella Spring show remained in White Plaza for
an entire day. Flyers for both a party and a lay Sachs testing remained
around Braun Music Building for over a week. I hat some messages
remain untouched while others are swept up raises at least the suspi
cion of double standards.
For the record, these are the posters that went missing
from campus the day Casper met with students:
1. No Fee, No Funds
2. No Funds, No Phones
3. Percentage of tenured professors who are women: 15%
4. Does the University support the Women's Center?
5. Support the Women's Center
6. Number of people not welcomed at the Women's Center: 0
7. Number of housed sororities: 0
8. Nobody gets date raped at Stanford, right?
9. 1 low many times have you traveled home on a dark path?
10. Ways to fund the Women's Center: ASSU Fees, Bake Sale, etc.
n. Programs lost with the special fee:
CiWN, Herstory, Womenspeak, etc.
I he largest issue is not so much whar the posters said. Its that the
University is able to stop student activist efforts in our own commu
nity. I live on the Row and flyered there, and those posters were
removed by the next morning. Shouldn't we as students be able to
spread information in our own living spaces?
A few weeks after the incident, I was prompted to write a letter to
the Daily in which I included many of the ideas and sentiments
expressed here. The letter was never published, hut it was passed along
to several email lists and eventually 1 received back some words of
appreciation for my efforts, as well as some criticisms of my logic.
It was written out of anger and, because of that, was a bit rash in
its judgments of the University. However, after a couple of weeks of
paying careful attention to groundskeeping policy enforcement, I feel
I was mostly right. But I concede that I came to some unfounded
harsh conclusions.
In retrospect, I want to make clear that I do not think the
University is out to get any community on campus. What 1 do believe
is that the quick and punitive nature of the clean-up suggests that
there was more than a sign policy motivating it. It seems like a moot
point to argue the intentions, however, as the outcome is all that is
left. Shortly after 1 wrote the letter, advocates for the women's center
succeeded in having the $46 per hour groundskeeping fee dropped.
In the end, the flyers were never seen, the president was well
prepped for Tea and Cookies and has made a pledge to fund a pro
posal from the Women's Center, and very few people on campus
know anything ever happened. Regardless of why the flyers were
removed, the action was a distinctly unusual application of a little
known and rarely enforced policy. The lessons are still cause for atten
tion and concern. Whether or not there was a master plan to remove
the information on the flyers laid down that night — and I concede
there probably was not — the University is obviously capable of
choosing, at least on some level, what can be seen and read and what
can not.
