# Writing Was Everything
## A
						conversation with Alfred Kazin

JL \Jfred Ka/in is best known as one of the distinguished group of New
York Jewish intellectuals of 1940s and '50s who defined American intel
lectual discourse and provided a critical vantage point on the culture for
years to come. I le is also part of a larger cultural phenomenon: he wrote
on the experience of a generation of American Jews who grew up the
children of immigrants in the slums of the Bronx and Brooklyn and
found their hooks and their professions at the nations free public edu
cational institutions. Senior editor Mia Sara Bruch spoke with Kazin
whose latest book, A l ifetime Burning in /-'ray Moment, was published
this year — earlier this spring, and gained a rare glimpse into an extra
ordinary time in the American intellectual and cultural landscape.
MB: One thing that / find fiki mating about eurrent intellectual life is the
presence and authority of black intellectuals — people like Henry l.ouis
dates, Cornel West, Stanley ('touch. How do you trace the transition front
the prominence of Jewish intellectuals of the '40s and 'SOs to the black intel
lectuals of the nineties':
AK: |ules l ieffer has a line that goes like this: he's chatting with some
one .it .1 partv and they ask, 'Why are so main people getting divorced
these davs?' and Jules s.ivs, "Because thev can now afford it. Once lews
were no longer in the ghetto or the shtetl, thev were .it large in America.
It's the same with blacks, although onlv .1 few have managed to get out
of the misery of poverty.
1 met Gates when 1 was teaching .it ( .ornell some vears ago. 1 he
man has amazing academic credentials: Cambridge, Harvard, Yale
and he's very sure if himself. And as far as 1 can tell, he spends most of
his time now writing articles for 7 lie New Yorker decrying the unfortu
nate anti-Semitism of some blacks. But 1 am not a public intellectual, 1
am a literary intellectual.
MB: What 's the difference?
AK: rhe politics have always meant much less to me than the literature.
I he title of my book about the period — Writing was Everything — says
it best. Because of my background, with my father in the Workmen's
Circle (a Jewish labor organization founded in New York in the earlv
20th century), I was a sort of mild socialist. But I never joined the
Communist party when everybody else did. I was never a Marxist, I was
a literary radical; I was interested in the modern literary movements. We
(the New York circle) came our of a background where it was very nat
ural to have ideas about politics. The black intellectuals — (Jates, West,
Crouch — Crouch is particularly important, 1 think....
MB: Why is that?
AK: He writes better, he thinks better, he has a wider culture. But the
black intellectuals come out of a different source. Because of the wide
spread dislike of blacks, which has never changed, and because of the
very condition of the black masses, it is absolutely central for a black
intellectual to be public. It is not necessary for Frilling or Kazin, with
their passion for literature, because the Jewish people have always been
public.
MB: lbey've always had some type of public voice.
AK: It's impossible to be a Jewish intellectual and be a pure aesthete. On
the other hand, it's not necessary for Jewish intellectuals to be public.
I,ook at my career. Look at 1 rillings, too. And the politics changed
Irving Howe and I are the only two of the well-known Jewish intellec
tuals who did not go right-wing.
MB: Why did it happen? Why did they go right-wing?
AK: I happened because they are by nature, many of them, not all of
them but many of them, they are political-minded. And because even
before the collapse of communism in Russia they had attained a little
status. It's all a question of status. 1 went to City College. It would never
have occurred to my parents to send me to Columbia. Also, I was a fair
ly indifferent student; I had never heard of Harvard or any of that. But
in the course of a few years I was teaching at Harvard. Sitting in my bed
room in my parents little apartment in Brownsville was about as far
away from Harvard as you can get. I he status changed: my parents
spoke Yiddish only and were miserably poor. At a certain point, the rad

icalism of the past became part of a lower social status. And although a
lot of intellectuals belonged to it, they were not, in my opinion, the best
intellectuals.
lake Trilling's career. Trillings father was a custom tailor. His moth
er was from Russia. But his son loved Victorian literature!
What you have to understand about the Jews is that coming out of
these rough, working-class backgrounds, there was this inevitable nat
ural social shift from memories of Russian persecution and the absence
of a Jewish state in Palestine. "Because they can now afford it!
[The New York group] had a common background in the world
public issues that came from organizations like the Workmen's Circle.
And the other thing is the fact that Jews, being what they are, are set on
education. I his is the background of the Jewish intellectuals.
MB: How would yon differentiate this history from that of the black public
intellectuals?
AK: I he black intellectuals are a di fie rent story. Black public intellectu
als were always concerned with the enormous anti-black feelings which
are still very strong in this country; no black can be happy. I he only
black public intellectual at the beginning of this century was WK.B.
Dußois, probably the greatest example of the public intellectual. That
legacv was taken up bv Richard Wright, who I consider the most hon
est of the black intellectuals because he was willing to acknowledge the

violence within the black familv. I he Communist
Part)' also became ver\ important in the writings of
the black intellectuals; if vou've read Ralph F.llison's
Invisible Man, you know that its very much about
the Communist Partv.
At that time, the Part) had groups called John
Reed clubs, after the American journalist who died
in Russia in 1920. 1 lis name was used by the
Communist Part) as propaganda to bring in writers
who eventually, the Communists thought, would
become good Communists. 1 lie John Reed clubs
were great tor a guy like Richard Wright because for
the first time he had a chance to show his writing to
people. I le eventually left the Communists because
they were so completely uncomfortable with any
kind of intellectual freedom. I hey became agitated

by him because they are essentially an authoritarian association.
MB: You talked about blacks not being "happy You don 't think that some
one, like, say, Henry l.ouis dates has come to terms with his black identity?
AK: The word "identity' makes me very nervous. I don't. One of mv
heroes is the former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. And
when someone asked him, "What do you think about the future of your
people?" And he said that lie didn't think that blacks could ever have a
just future in America. Gates has written about this — he comes from
West Virginia. What happens when he goes back there? Where they
don't know that he's a I farvard professor? Where they've never heard of
The New Yorker? You think he doesn't feel uneasy?
It's true that a name like Moses Finkelstein is not greeted as easily
as one like Lionel Trilling, even though both may be Russian Jews. But
unlike Jews, blacks will always feel uneasy. What could be worse than
slavery, for heavens sake? And remember something else. Most Jews and
blacks have one thing in common. They've both been oppressed. But
even now, blacks are still totally afraid.
MB: You talked about Henry Louis dates going back to his home in West
Virginia, where nobody knows who he is. Who, then is he trying to address
when he writes, if he's not writing for bLick people?
AK: Who reads The New Yorker: Blacks in the ghetto? Don't be funny.
You know who reads The New Yorker— people like you and me. Of
course it has a Jewish readership. A Jewish audience will always buy
books, which no other groups in America does. You know the saying
that we're the "people of the book? I say we're the people of the
magazine.
