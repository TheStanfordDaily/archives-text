### Mia Sara Bruch 
We're Right, They're Wrong: A Handbook for
Spirited Progressives
by James Carville
Random House, $10

How do you turn a backroom spin doctor
into a household name? Add an inclination
towards public profanity, a Cajun accent that
lies somewhere in between quaint and cloying,
and a starring role in an Academy Award-win
ning film, and — oh yes — get a president
elected, and for better or for worse, you've got
James Carville.
Its therefore altogether appropriate that
Carville's new book, We're Right, They're Wrong
is just as much about Carville as it is a
"Handbook for Spirited Progressives," which
the subtitle proclaims. The book's title (along
with the cover shot of Carville looking at the
reader and pointing determinedly) offers as
good an understanding of Carville as any
Beltway maven could provide. It's pure
Carville — insistent, cavalier — but backed up
with brains and the facts. Its the titular equiv
alent to "It's the economy, stupid."
The book begins with James Carville's per
sonal nightmare. While at a Republican barbe
cue, he is cornered by the G.O.P chorus line
— William Bennet, Phil Cramm, et. al. —
and is caught unprepared to deal with impre
cations against welfare, demands to abolish the
E.P.A., and other conservative jeremiads. And
then he wakes up. Carville wrote the book, he
tells us, to assist Democrats in dealing with
social-issue spin control when Republicans
show up at your next barbecue. This is political
discourse which thinks local.
There's something distinctly powerful
about the combination of barbecue and poli
tics — whether it's Texans For Bush lining up
to nosh at a rib roast with George
Jr., or books by Southern political consultants
using cookouts as a central metaphor. The sce
nario, though ham-handed, impresses the very
legitimate need to counter the vacuous and yet
vaguely convincing soundbites of Dittoheads
and Creationist neighbors who have taken over
your local school board. Carville rightly argues
that one of the Democratic Party's biggest
weaknesses is its inability to campaign effec
tively. Democrats, he says, "have been taking a
beating from Republicans every place we go,
from barbecues to Superbowl Parties to the
neighborhood bar....We've lost all our cam
paign instincts....We re a bunch of well-mean
ing weenies. We whine and anguish in public."
This sounded suspiciously like a description of
Bill Clinton. I kept reading anyway.
Inasmuch as Carville wants to create a new
campaign strategy for Democratic candidates,
he wants to create a new rhetorical strategy for
Democratic constituents, based on the tech
niques of campaign advertising and spin con
trol. For every Republican line about big gov

ernment or welfare mothers, Carville offers
response points — a pithy retort if you're going
for an argumentative swat and a second para
graph rife with facts and figures if you're going
in for the kill.
Carville offers a surprisingly strong philo
sophical background for a book which defines
itself as an anthology of sound bites. In the
introduction, we learn that after a birth in a
government hospital, a job in the military, and
an education at a state university, Carville firm
ly believes that government power can be used
to do amazing things, and his political faith in
the Democratic party is tied to this conviction.
One of his chapters, in fact, is a list of U.S. gov
ernment projects that have "worked" — such
as the Clean Witer Act and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency — to coun
teract Rush Limbaugh-esque rantings about
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
In substance, part of the books legibility
lies in its personability — Carville makes the
policy program of the New Democrats folksy a
la Ross Perot. Although the barnyard animal
metaphors aren't as profuse, Carville's prose is
peppered with colloquial endearments to his
leftv readers. When speaking of Al Core's
much-touted National Performance Review,
a.k.a. "Reinventing Government," Carville
does Berry Crocker one better: "The rule is,
taste the cake. If it's good, eat it. If not, get
another cake mix." The reader is also treated to
personal exegeses in the book's sidebars, rang
ing from a potato salad recipe to a list of
Carville's " Fop Five Ridiculous and Pathetic
Republicans.
These details, which range from charming
to tedious, are part of one of the larger qualities
of the book. Carville's passion as well as his per
sona come across dearly and persuasively, and
it's enough to remind even the most hardened
Reagan Democrat what they saw in the Dems
in the first place. In an age of politicos who
switch parties like they change personal assis
tants, it's refreshing — and compelling — to
see sincere concern fused with political savvy.
From the start, We're Right establishes itself
as useful. My personal favorite came in
Chapter One, when Carville gets to work by
supplying us with helpful facts to refute
Republican hagiographies of the Eighties. This
is no small matter: up until now, I had been
relying on "Bedtime for Bonzo" jokes and
vague vitriol about the Savings and Loan crisis.
The book is well organized and focuses on the
most fundamental and oft-contended issues
facing the U.S. government, such as economic
growth, welfare, and health care. Carville has
the perfect citations and statistics for his rapid
responses, as well as lucid analogies, often
involving small children, to melt the heart of
the guy distributing John Birch pamphlets at
the Fourth of July picnic. In fact, reading the
book is sometimes difficult precisely because it
makes you wish that Clinton would have said
it like this during his first term, instead of ram

bling chrough another press conference. Some
issues are noticeable by their absence — gay
rights in general and gays in the military in par
ticular are the most obvious omission. Spirited
progressives may need to resort to reminding
Republican barbecue guests about Candace
Gingrich.
The book's publication comes at a rather
ironic time; although still active in the political
consulting firm Carville and Begala, Carville,
like the other liberal minds who orchestrated
Clintons 1992 triumph, is now a relatively
minor advisory figure to the Clinton White
House. After a first term that's been docu
mented largely in terms of its vacillations and
retractions ranging from Lani Guinier to uni
versal health insurance, the War Room of
Campaign 96 will probably look much differ
ent. Clinton has increasingly relied on the
advice of consultant Dick Morris, who, like his
analog David Gergen, has built his career in
part by working for the GOP, and whose cam
paign style is reputed to be a bit more cut
throat; less Morning in America, perhaps more
Daisy Girl. Carville's book is both a call to arms
and an admission of defeat, an implicit
acknowledgement that progressive battles are
now being fought (in local terrain — town hall
meetings, school board elections, summer bar
beques — rather than the grand stage of
national politics.
In an age when politicians — and unfor
tunately, political discourse in general — seem
to be primarily defined by image control, this
is no small distinction. Although the micro
management of politics may now be self-evi
dent, what We're Right may reveal is that the
reduction of rigorous and extended discussion
into the neighborhood equivalent of talking
points at a press conference has now permeat
ed into the personal realm as well. However
necessary it may be to arm oneself in the lan
guage of soundbites rather than sustained
debate, I am more than a little ambivalent
about the further encroachments of the tech
niques of political consultants like Carville into
public and private life.
But Carville, with his description of the
rights well-rehearsed and well-funded argu
mentation and advertising techniques, makes a
compelling case for the left to adopt their own
quick response techniques. One just hopes it
won't degenerate into the liberal citizens ver
sion of Willie Horton. Although it won't pro
vide quick rebuttals to Gennifer Flowers jokes,
make sure you have Carville's book in hand
and the title in your head if you ever have a yen
to head over to a Stanford Republicans barbe
cue.

We're Right, They're Wrong: A Handbook for
Spirited Progressives
by James Carville
Random House, $10

How do you turn a backroom spin doctor
into a household name? Add an inclination
towards public profanity, a Cajun accent that
lies somewhere in between quaint and cloying,
and a starring role in an Academy Award-win
ning film, and — oh yes — get a president
elected, and for better or for worse, you've got
James Carville.
Its therefore altogether appropriate that
Carville's new book, We're Right, They're Wrong
is just as much about Carville as it is a
"Handbook for Spirited Progressives," which
the subtitle proclaims. The book's title (along
with the cover shot of Carville looking at the
reader and pointing determinedly) offers as
good an understanding of Carville as any
Beltway maven could provide. It's pure
Carville — insistent, cavalier — but backed up
with brains and the facts. Its the titular equiv
alent to "It's the economy, stupid."
The book begins with James Carville's per
sonal nightmare. While at a Republican barbe
cue, he is cornered by the G.O.P chorus line
— William Bennet, Phil Cramm, et. al. —
and is caught unprepared to deal with impre
cations against welfare, demands to abolish the
E.P.A., and other conservative jeremiads. And
then he wakes up. Carville wrote the book, he
tells us, to assist Democrats in dealing with
social-issue spin control when Republicans
show up at your next barbecue. This is political
discourse which thinks local.
There's something distinctly powerful
about the combination of barbecue and poli
tics — whether it's Texans For Bush lining up
to nosh at a rib roast with George
Jr., or books by Southern political consultants
using cookouts as a central metaphor. The sce
nario, though ham-handed, impresses the very
legitimate need to counter the vacuous and yet
vaguely convincing soundbites of Dittoheads
and Creationist neighbors who have taken over
your local school board. Carville rightly argues
that one of the Democratic Party's biggest
weaknesses is its inability to campaign effec
tively. Democrats, he says, "have been taking a
beating from Republicans every place we go,
from barbecues to Superbowl Parties to the
neighborhood bar....We've lost all our cam
paign instincts....We re a bunch of well-mean
ing weenies. We whine and anguish in public."
This sounded suspiciously like a description of
Bill Clinton. I kept reading anyway.
Inasmuch as Carville wants to create a new
campaign strategy for Democratic candidates,
he wants to create a new rhetorical strategy for
Democratic constituents, based on the tech
niques of campaign advertising and spin con
trol. For every Republican line about big gov

ernment or welfare mothers, Carville offers
response points — a pithy retort if you're going
for an argumentative swat and a second para
graph rife with facts and figures if you're going
in for the kill.
Carville offers a surprisingly strong philo
sophical background for a book which defines
itself as an anthology of sound bites. In the
introduction, we learn that after a birth in a
government hospital, a job in the military, and
an education at a state university, Carville firm
ly believes that government power can be used
to do amazing things, and his political faith in
the Democratic party is tied to this conviction.
One of his chapters, in fact, is a list of U.S. gov
ernment projects that have "worked" — such
as the Clean Witer Act and the Federal
Emergency Management Agency — to coun
teract Rush Limbaugh-esque rantings about
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
In substance, part of the books legibility
lies in its personability — Carville makes the
policy program of the New Democrats folksy a
la Ross Perot. Although the barnyard animal
metaphors aren't as profuse, Carville's prose is
peppered with colloquial endearments to his
leftv readers. When speaking of Al Core's
much-touted National Performance Review,
a.k.a. "Reinventing Government," Carville
does Berry Crocker one better: "The rule is,
taste the cake. If it's good, eat it. If not, get
another cake mix." The reader is also treated to
personal exegeses in the book's sidebars, rang
ing from a potato salad recipe to a list of
Carville's " Fop Five Ridiculous and Pathetic
Republicans.
These details, which range from charming
to tedious, are part of one of the larger qualities
of the book. Carville's passion as well as his per
sona come across dearly and persuasively, and
it's enough to remind even the most hardened
Reagan Democrat what they saw in the Dems
in the first place. In an age of politicos who
switch parties like they change personal assis
tants, it's refreshing — and compelling — to
see sincere concern fused with political savvy.
From the start, We're Right establishes itself
as useful. My personal favorite came in
Chapter One, when Carville gets to work by
supplying us with helpful facts to refute
Republican hagiographies of the Eighties. This
is no small matter: up until now, I had been
relying on "Bedtime for Bonzo" jokes and
vague vitriol about the Savings and Loan crisis.
The book is well organized and focuses on the
most fundamental and oft-contended issues
facing the U.S. government, such as economic
growth, welfare, and health care. Carville has
the perfect citations and statistics for his rapid
responses, as well as lucid analogies, often
involving small children, to melt the heart of
the guy distributing John Birch pamphlets at
the Fourth of July picnic. In fact, reading the
book is sometimes difficult precisely because it
makes you wish that Clinton would have said
it like this during his first term, instead of ram

bling chrough another press conference. Some
issues are noticeable by their absence — gay
rights in general and gays in the military in par
ticular are the most obvious omission. Spirited
progressives may need to resort to reminding
Republican barbecue guests about Candace
Gingrich.
The book's publication comes at a rather
ironic time; although still active in the political
consulting firm Carville and Begala, Carville,
like the other liberal minds who orchestrated
Clintons 1992 triumph, is now a relatively
minor advisory figure to the Clinton White
House. After a first term that's been docu
mented largely in terms of its vacillations and
retractions ranging from Lani Guinier to uni
versal health insurance, the War Room of
Campaign 96 will probably look much differ
ent. Clinton has increasingly relied on the
advice of consultant Dick Morris, who, like his
analog David Gergen, has built his career in
part by working for the GOP, and whose cam
paign style is reputed to be a bit more cut
throat; less Morning in America, perhaps more
Daisy Girl. Carville's book is both a call to arms
and an admission of defeat, an implicit
acknowledgement that progressive battles are
now being fought (in local terrain — town hall
meetings, school board elections, summer bar
beques — rather than the grand stage of
national politics.
In an age when politicians — and unfor
tunately, political discourse in general — seem
to be primarily defined by image control, this
is no small distinction. Although the micro
management of politics may now be self-evi
dent, what We're Right may reveal is that the
reduction of rigorous and extended discussion
into the neighborhood equivalent of talking
points at a press conference has now permeat
ed into the personal realm as well. However
necessary it may be to arm oneself in the lan
guage of soundbites rather than sustained
debate, I am more than a little ambivalent
about the further encroachments of the tech
niques of political consultants like Carville into
public and private life.
But Carville, with his description of the
rights well-rehearsed and well-funded argu
mentation and advertising techniques, makes a
compelling case for the left to adopt their own
quick response techniques. One just hopes it
won't degenerate into the liberal citizens ver
sion of Willie Horton. Although it won't pro
vide quick rebuttals to Gennifer Flowers jokes,
make sure you have Carville's book in hand
and the title in your head if you ever have a yen
to head over to a Stanford Republicans barbe
cue.
