## Boarding School Voodoo 
### Curtis Sittenfeld 
W
W hen Liza and i graduated from hoard
ing school, Mrs. Hilly gave us voodoo dolls.
They were red and puffy, sort of like ginger
bread men, with lucky and unlucky phrases
printed up and down the expanse of their bod
ies: all the possible wishes or anxieties a person
could have. I've never used mine — I'm not
crazy about those calling-up-the-spirits type
toys and 1 wont get near a Ouija board — but
my 9-year-old brother loves it. Whenever 1 go
home for vacations 1 find the doll in his room,
the white pins stuck into Find Gold or New
Puppy and then, on behalf of his fourth grade
enemy Lianna Gerowir/., the black pins in Hair
Loss or Mental Anguish. My mother thinks the
appropriateness of Mrs. Hillys gift was, at best,
questionable. But she thinks the same of Mrs.
Hilly herself. When she's being generous, she
calls Mrs. Hilly a character.
Mrs. Hillv was the chaplain of my board
ing school and my faculty advisor when 1 was a
junior and senior. My first and second years at
the school, I had a male math teacher for an
advisor. 1 think he was perplexed by me.
Probably he'd known students as weird and
restless as 1 was, but I doubt they'd been quite

so eager to offer up their weird
ness for inspection. (I don't know
why — maybe this is what private
school does to you — but it took
me a long time to grasp the fact
that there was any substantial dif
ference between a teacher and a
psychiatrist.) When 1 started fail
ing courses, my math teacher
advisor crammed lollipops and
inspirational postcards in my
mailbox: Garfield the cat clinging
to a tree branch, with a caption
that said "Hang in there!"
During the spring of my
sophomore year, when my
English class covered a unit on
journalism, we were all made to
write pieces for the school paper. 1

did an editorial on why daily chapel was a good
thing — probably 1 threw around words like
structure and spirituality, but all in all, I don't
think the sentiments expressed were especially
sincere — and after it was printed I got flak
from other students. But I got ten minutes of
flak, at most. Maybe three people said I was an
ass-kisser or a goody-goody or something
equally mild; certainly I'd gotten worse from
my own siblings. As chaplain, however, Mrs.
Hilly heard about the trouble, and she quickly
became my new best friend and staunchest
defender, persuading the faculty of the impor
tance of my newspaper article, warding oft
those three kids who hadn't really cared about
the article in the first place. Worst of all, she
developed the joking, humiliating habit of call
ing me Joanie, as in Joan of Arc. And all I'd
done was fulfill a homework assignment.
She invited Liza and me to dinner at her
house, where she was jolly, obese, and vulgar.
She made Thai food and showed us pho-

tographs of when shed been ordained, in the
seventies, among the first group of
Episcopalian women priests. In her downstairs
bathroom, there was a tiny cassette hidden in
the toilet paper that played "It's a Small World
After All as you unraveled it. She referred to a
bearded man whose picture was stuck to her
refrigerator as "my lover. When it somehow
came out that neither Liza nor I had ever
smoked marijuana, she shook her head and
muttered, "Such a shame, such a shame.' And
when we had raspberry sherbet for dessert, she
called it Vagina Pudding, repeatedly. I think
she liked the fact that she could shock me. In a
school full of hardened preppies, 1 was as bash
ful and unpoised as a baby lamb.
I didn't exactly appreciate the- attention
Mrs. Hilly gave me, but I knew I owed her for
it, and the next fall, when the dean put notices
in our mailbox, 1 requested her as my advisor.
(The politics of boarding school are weird, and
somehow, in making the request, 1 am pretty
sure it was 1 who was doing her a favor.) 1 don't
think 1 ever wanted her to be my advisor — 1
wanted someone frank and uncomplicated —
but during that time 1 was such a wimp that if
what 1 wanted and what 1 felt obligated to do

didn't correspond, I went with obligation. Also,
there was a story going around that when one
of her former advisees had applied to
Princeton, the admissions office had over
looked his C average and accepted him solely
on the basis of her lavish recommendation.
w
W hat I often wondered was how Mrs.
Hilly had selected me. Because undeniably,
inexplicably, 1 was her favorite. She'd spend
entire class periods discussing my personal fab
ulousness with her Religion and Ethics stu
dents. On Saturday afternoons, she drove me
to Boston to visit galleries or attend poetry
readings or to have lunch with her friends, all
of whom were in their fifties, as she was, or
older. One was a sculptor. One had AIDS; he
was the first person I ever saw wearing one of
those red awareness ribbons. One was a cellist
who asked me who my favorite classical musi-

cian was and when I said I didn't know of any
classical musicians, she said, "Sevina, Sevina,
Sevina,' which was Mrs. Hilly's first name, in a
despairing voice.
Mrs. Hilly seemed to trust my assessments
of other students; she listened to mv whining
as attentively as if I were telling some mar
velous story; when 1 flunked French 111 she
only said, "You'll pass it when you want to."
Her unswerving faith in me was both flattering
and disturbing: she was a grown woman, a
powerful member of our boarding school com
munity, and I, essentially, was a dork.
Besides, I always felt slightly uncomfort
able around her because 1 believed our alliance
was based on the false premise that 1 was some
heroic social activist. Even when I enjoyed her
company, I could never shake the sensation
that 1 was an impostor, and that eventually,
inevitably, 1 would disappoint her. I tried to
preserve the opinionated, flustered version of
myself that she'd first admired. When she said
the word masturbation, I covered my ears and
squealed on cue. (Actually, since I'd lost the
knack of blushing, squealing was the least I
could do.) I also could only be upset in an
amusing, specific way. I could say, "I get so
frustrated in math class, I think I'm

going to spontaneously combust. 1 I
couldn't say that tor much ot the
time 1 actually felt unhappy, really,
truly, not wittily or romantically
unhappy, or that I'd had trouble
sleeping since ninth grade. She was
childish about certain things, and
tor all I knew, she would have got
ten ott on having an insomniac
advisee. Maybe shed have said,
"Why not find a handsome boy
and go for a stroll in the moon
light?''
And 1 could only ask her for
favors by being elaborately apolo
getic. It I wanted a ride to town, for
example, I'd call and leave a ram
bling, ten-minute message on her
answering machine that started,

"Hi, Mrs. Hilly, 1 hope I'm not disturbing you
or whatever, but I just wanted to see — 1 mean,
only if this would be convenient — but maybe
you could take Liza and me to the grocery
store, and I d totally understand if you could
n't..." And maybe lor good measure Id con
clude with, "And I really liked that sweater you
were wearing today."
She'd come to get me, of course, pulling up
outside my dorm and honking. Then I'd dash
out to the car, and when I opened the passen
ger's door she'd be wearing red galoshes, or false
eyelashes, or a pin that said If you don't believe
in abortion, don't have one. She'd say, "I'm
always happy to give you a ride anywhere; you
know that.''
he was fond of vague, dramatic, all-encom
passing comments, which perhaps she'd discov-
