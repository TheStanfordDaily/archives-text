## Boarding School Voodoo 
### Curtis Sittenfeld 
W
W hen Liza and i graduated from hoard
ing school, Mrs. Hilly gave us voodoo dolls.
They were red and puffy, sort of like ginger
bread men, with lucky and unlucky phrases
printed up and down the expanse of their bod
ies: all the possible wishes or anxieties a person
could have. I've never used mine — I'm not
crazy about those calling-up-the-spirits type
toys and 1 wont get near a Ouija board — but
my 9-year-old brother loves it. Whenever 1 go
home for vacations 1 find the doll in his room,
the white pins stuck into Find Gold or New
Puppy and then, on behalf of his fourth grade
enemy Lianna Gerowir/., the black pins in Hair
Loss or Mental Anguish. My mother thinks the
appropriateness of Mrs. Hillys gift was, at best,
questionable. But she thinks the same of Mrs.
Hilly herself. When she's being generous, she
calls Mrs. Hilly a character.
Mrs. Hillv was the chaplain of my board
ing school and my faculty advisor when 1 was a
junior and senior. My first and second years at
the school, I had a male math teacher for an
advisor. 1 think he was perplexed by me.
Probably he'd known students as weird and
restless as 1 was, but I doubt they'd been quite

so eager to offer up their weird
ness for inspection. (I don't know
why — maybe this is what private
school does to you — but it took
me a long time to grasp the fact
that there was any substantial dif
ference between a teacher and a
psychiatrist.) When 1 started fail
ing courses, my math teacher
advisor crammed lollipops and
inspirational postcards in my
mailbox: Garfield the cat clinging
to a tree branch, with a caption
that said "Hang in there!"
During the spring of my
sophomore year, when my
English class covered a unit on
journalism, we were all made to
write pieces for the school paper. 1

did an editorial on why daily chapel was a good
thing — probably 1 threw around words like
structure and spirituality, but all in all, I don't
think the sentiments expressed were especially
sincere — and after it was printed I got flak
from other students. But I got ten minutes of
flak, at most. Maybe three people said I was an
ass-kisser or a goody-goody or something
equally mild; certainly I'd gotten worse from
my own siblings. As chaplain, however, Mrs.
Hilly heard about the trouble, and she quickly
became my new best friend and staunchest
defender, persuading the faculty of the impor
tance of my newspaper article, warding oft
those three kids who hadn't really cared about
the article in the first place. Worst of all, she
developed the joking, humiliating habit of call
ing me Joanie, as in Joan of Arc. And all I'd
done was fulfill a homework assignment.
She invited Liza and me to dinner at her
house, where she was jolly, obese, and vulgar.
She made Thai food and showed us pho-

tographs of when shed been ordained, in the
seventies, among the first group of
Episcopalian women priests. In her downstairs
bathroom, there was a tiny cassette hidden in
the toilet paper that played "It's a Small World
After All as you unraveled it. She referred to a
bearded man whose picture was stuck to her
refrigerator as "my lover. When it somehow
came out that neither Liza nor I had ever
smoked marijuana, she shook her head and
muttered, "Such a shame, such a shame.' And
when we had raspberry sherbet for dessert, she
called it Vagina Pudding, repeatedly. I think
she liked the fact that she could shock me. In a
school full of hardened preppies, 1 was as bash
ful and unpoised as a baby lamb.
I didn't exactly appreciate the- attention
Mrs. Hilly gave me, but I knew I owed her for
it, and the next fall, when the dean put notices
in our mailbox, 1 requested her as my advisor.
(The politics of boarding school are weird, and
somehow, in making the request, 1 am pretty
sure it was 1 who was doing her a favor.) 1 don't
think 1 ever wanted her to be my advisor — 1
wanted someone frank and uncomplicated —
but during that time 1 was such a wimp that if
what 1 wanted and what 1 felt obligated to do

didn't correspond, I went with obligation. Also,
there was a story going around that when one
of her former advisees had applied to
Princeton, the admissions office had over
looked his C average and accepted him solely
on the basis of her lavish recommendation.
w
W hat I often wondered was how Mrs.
Hilly had selected me. Because undeniably,
inexplicably, 1 was her favorite. She'd spend
entire class periods discussing my personal fab
ulousness with her Religion and Ethics stu
dents. On Saturday afternoons, she drove me
to Boston to visit galleries or attend poetry
readings or to have lunch with her friends, all
of whom were in their fifties, as she was, or
older. One was a sculptor. One had AIDS; he
was the first person I ever saw wearing one of
those red awareness ribbons. One was a cellist
who asked me who my favorite classical musi-

cian was and when I said I didn't know of any
classical musicians, she said, "Sevina, Sevina,
Sevina,' which was Mrs. Hilly's first name, in a
despairing voice.
Mrs. Hilly seemed to trust my assessments
of other students; she listened to mv whining
as attentively as if I were telling some mar
velous story; when 1 flunked French 111 she
only said, "You'll pass it when you want to."
Her unswerving faith in me was both flattering
and disturbing: she was a grown woman, a
powerful member of our boarding school com
munity, and I, essentially, was a dork.
Besides, I always felt slightly uncomfort
able around her because 1 believed our alliance
was based on the false premise that 1 was some
heroic social activist. Even when I enjoyed her
company, I could never shake the sensation
that 1 was an impostor, and that eventually,
inevitably, 1 would disappoint her. I tried to
preserve the opinionated, flustered version of
myself that she'd first admired. When she said
the word masturbation, I covered my ears and
squealed on cue. (Actually, since I'd lost the
knack of blushing, squealing was the least I
could do.) I also could only be upset in an
amusing, specific way. I could say, "I get so
frustrated in math class, I think I'm

going to spontaneously combust. 1 I
couldn't say that tor much ot the
time 1 actually felt unhappy, really,
truly, not wittily or romantically
unhappy, or that I'd had trouble
sleeping since ninth grade. She was
childish about certain things, and
tor all I knew, she would have got
ten ott on having an insomniac
advisee. Maybe shed have said,
"Why not find a handsome boy
and go for a stroll in the moon
light?''
And 1 could only ask her for
favors by being elaborately apolo
getic. It I wanted a ride to town, for
example, I'd call and leave a ram
bling, ten-minute message on her
answering machine that started,

"Hi, Mrs. Hilly, 1 hope I'm not disturbing you
or whatever, but I just wanted to see — 1 mean,
only if this would be convenient — but maybe
you could take Liza and me to the grocery
store, and I d totally understand if you could
n't..." And maybe lor good measure Id con
clude with, "And I really liked that sweater you
were wearing today."
She'd come to get me, of course, pulling up
outside my dorm and honking. Then I'd dash
out to the car, and when I opened the passen
ger's door she'd be wearing red galoshes, or false
eyelashes, or a pin that said If you don't believe
in abortion, don't have one. She'd say, "I'm
always happy to give you a ride anywhere; you
know that.''
he was fond of vague, dramatic, all-encom
passing comments, which perhaps she'd discov-

ered while preaching. At first, I believed them
wholeheartedly; later, 1 just found them irritat
ing. It, tor example, a lecturer came to our
boarding school to discuss affirmative action,
afterwards I might say, "Which side are you on,
Mrs. Hilly? And shed respond, "It's all
tremendous. Truly tremendous. There's a lot of
it there, and I'm sure you know what I'm refer
ring to. These comments were bad enough
when we were dealing with a topic that was
neutral. Hut sometimes I was seeking her advice
after all, she was my advisor — before act
ing in a given way, and then they were much
worse; in the end, they amounted to apathy on
her part. I'd say, "Do you think there's some
thing wrong with me? Do you think I II never
feel satisfied? And to that she might respond,
"Wait a while. In the end, its just remarkable.
And you sense that.
She had me covered on all sides. No mat
ter what I said, no matter how contradictory or
revelatory I thought I was, she always had the
perfect response: "I sensed that .ill along, of
course; I'm glad you finally felt comfortable
enough to bring it up."

She was fond of vague, dramatic,
ALL-ENCOMPASSING COMMENTS. AT FIRST,
I BELIEVED THEM WHOLEHEARTEDLY;
LATER, I JUST FOUND THEM IRRITATING.

It could have been tliar I expected too
much of her; it could have been that I was nar
cissistic and tiresome. But the reason I saved
my questions for her was that I thought she was
smart.
I think my parents worried that Mrs. I iillv
influenced me too strongly but bit their
tongues, suspecting, incorrectly, that if Id
known they disapproved I'd have followed her
that much more devoutly. Possibly they saw my
relationship with her as a minor adolescent
rebellion, a passing lapse of taste, like green
hair, or underage drinking. I hev only met her
two or three times, during Parents Weekends,
when she'd make purring, presumptuous com
ments about me. Maybe she'd lay her palm on
my father's arm and say, I let sense of right and
wrong has been so positively shaped by you.'
W
W hen college acceptances and rejections
came during the early spring of my senior year,
I finally became tired of nearly everything
about my life at boarding school. I'd been
turned down bv all the places I wanted to go.
On the one hand, in light of my grades, this
fact was unsurprising. On the other hand, I
believed I'd paid my dues, even if they weren't
academic. Furthermore, in the last four years,
I'd seen plenty of boarding school shitbags go
exactly where they wanted just because they
went to boarding school, and if the world was
going to be so unfair, I felt that at least it could
be unfair in my favor. 1 think that at boarding
school nothing is more important than where
you go to college — which 1 guess just shows
how warped boarding school is and how
removed from the rest of the decrepit world —

and so I believed I d tailed in some absolute,
Lusting way
Yet at the same time, my college rejections
were a kind of release. l or a long time I d hoped
for something, in the end I hadn't gotten it, and
now I could stop trying. I thought of how clov
ing and hopeful I d always been, how phony,
and I thought that I wouldn't be phony any
longer. So I was bitter, but also lightened.
I his was the time that Mrs. Hilly decided
I was gloomy. Just as she had once, with no real
basis, told everyone how brave I was, she now
told them that I was depressed. She jjnee came
to Liza's and my room at eight-thirty at night
and found me lying in bed, wearing my night
gown, with the lights of}. She pounced on my
lethargy like it was a piece of gold. "See! What
is this? A seventeen-year-old girl in bed at eight
o'clock? I wish you'd tell me what's wrong! I
was tempted to say to her, I've been telling you
for a year and a half, and now that you're final
ly willing to listen, 1 don't want to bore myself
by tel'ing you again. I also was tempted to say,
It's none of your damn business, and get out of
my room.
But I tried to maintain her idea of me.
After all, I was graduating soon and I knew it
would be stupid to fight at this late date. One
afternoon in May, I went to her classroom to
have her sign something for me; it must have
been some kind of permission slip. As I
stepped out of the room, 1 said, "By the way,
could you run me to town today? I want to buy
a birthday present for Sarah.
"Is that it? Mrs. 1 I illy asked, but not in an
accommodating tone; she sounded almost sar
castic.
"I guess, I said.
"You don't get it, do you? This is the only
time you come to see me now. Have you
noticed that? When you need something?
"What?" I was genuinely bewildered.
"You used to visit me all the time. And 1
felt comfortable coming to see you and Li/a in
your room. Would 1 feel comfortable now?"
She broke of} and shook her head. She was an
emotional person, sometimes crying openly
during her chapel sermons, and I was afraid she
was going to cry now. "You have no use for me
anymore. Is that it, no use? Is it something I've
done?"
I could think of no response. "What do—
I starred to say, but she cut me off.
"Go," she said. "You don't want to be here.
You want to leave. Go ahead. Look at you
standing there.
What I was supposed to do was cross the
room and sit by her and say in a baby voice, as
it I didn't understand, "Oh, come on, Mrs.
Ilillv. What is this? I mean, yikes, I'm so con
tused about everything now with college and
graduation, and also, please, please don't tell
anyone, but Alex West came to my dorm last
night and I'm psyched but also I'm nervous..."
I was supposed to be breathless and uncompre
hending, catering to her moods, trading my
youth and the company of my friends for her
attention. I thought, So my suspicions were
right. She had only ever liked me on her own
terms.
1 shrugged and said, "I'm sorry if I've done

something to upset you. As I was leaving the
room, in a final motion ot deference, 1 stuck
my head back in and said, "Should I leave the
door open or closed?
I think I must secretly love feeling grateful
towards other people. After graduation, 1 lost
my indifference and wrote Mrs. Hilly letters
full of my old drippy appreciation: I'm so sorry
about the end of the year, you have helped me so
much, 1 can never repay you. In fact, 1 had out
grown my unhappiness, or at least the hoarding
school strain of it. But, in my more lucid
moments, I realized Mrs. Hilly deserved little
credit, and 1 couldn't imagine why I was so
eager to give it to her.
The greatest lesson she taught me was that
the vast majority of what any person says to you
or does with you is linked only to what the per
son wants for herself. You, in the end, are a
minor figure in the drama of her life. And
maybe that's no revelation anyway; maybe it's
always been obvious, to other people.
