# THANK YOU!

### 
Its almost summer.
You've spent the last quarter sneezing,
wheezing and desperately looking for
someone in your freshman dorm
to go grab a frosty mint drink with.
You've passed on 80-degree afternoons
and even the occasional Pub Night to finish
an honors thesis
that wasn't very good anyway.
You're going home in two weeks and you
don't even have a job yet.
Well, this is for you.
I he editors of Jr. thank its readers for their
interest in and support of the magazine in its
first year.
We encourage any individuals interested in
writing, editing, graphics, art or layout to join
the staff next fall.
If you would like to help plan for the next
edition of Stanford's only student news
magazine, email us at jr@daily.stanford.edu,
or contact Mia Bruch at
mia@leland.stanford.edu.
You have nothing to lose but your money,
your health
and your reputation.
And tell a friend.
