## Did we learn to dance?

Writing the introduction to a piece is dif
ficult. The beginning paragraph must be cap
tivating, interesting, smooth to read, but above
all, developing a good introduction is a great
responsibility. The basic idea or flavor of a
piece must transpire through the words that
one uses. The reader must get a fore-taste of
what will follow and be placed in the correct
mind-set to understand and navigate through
the piece of writing. The same is true in music,
in which the overture to an opera, for instance,
sets the mood of the story that will unfold
when the curtain will rise and, more funda
mentally, habituates the spectators' ears to the
basic tonality of the musical score.
It is often the case that one remembers
more accurately the metaphor or the anec
dote outlined in an introduction, rather than
the subsequent details of the text, or the
tonality and rhythm of a piece of music,
rather than the melody which follows. In a
very similar way, this is what remains from
our education. We easily forget the details of
the formulas, models, quotes, dates, proofs,
arguments and descriptions which we learn
in the class-rooms. What remains deeply
ingrained in us, rather, are the approaches,
frameworks and methods of analysis inherent
in the disciplines we immersed ourselves in
for four years. It is the inductive or deductive
reasoning, the constructive or deconstructive
approach, the cynical or humble perspective,
and the abstract or factual vision, which we
carry away from our education. Like the basic
tonality of a piece of music or the image of an
introduction, these approaches have run
through our studies at a deep level and have
unconsciously formed our perception.
Judging the education Stanford has given
us in four years is therefore to reflect on the
basic structure inherent in its teaching; fun
damentally, have we been given the tools to
interact with the world around us? An ideal
education, like an introduction of introduc
tions, would indirectly and generally transmit
to us the ability to perceive, communicate
and understand our surroundings. Such
would be the essence of the liberal arts edu
cation whose goal is not to transmit specific
information but to form and sensitize the
student to an appreciation of life
T
JL he bell rings. I he first class we shall visit
on this ideal campus is that of corporal
expression in which the students learn to feel,
control and move their limbs to refine their
ability of perception. Perceiving and under
standing entails bringing the world to a tan
gible, intuitive reality, represented, in the
end, by our body. Small children, for
instance, when taught abstract notions such
as writing, learn to distinguish between a "d'
and a "b" by imagining that a "b is like a
man with a Â£ig folly. The teaching of chil
dren is full of these tricks that connect
abstract notions to an always more primary,

meaningful, intuitive and tangible reality, of
which the most basic is our body.
To perceive and become aware of feelings
such as love, anger, fright or surprise, we
make the same parallelism with physical
activities and positions. Anger, for instance,
can be the feeling of blood running through
our veins, but also the clenching of our fists,
mouths and eyes. Such tension is usually
associated with the expression of wrath and
thus enables us to understand the term
"anger, but also to feci angry. When we
imagine our hands growing so as to tighten
more forcefully and our eye-brows droping to
appear more fierce, we nurture the feeling of
anger. Similarly, when we imitate the gestures
we associate with love by moving gently,
opening our arms as it to embrace more deli
cately and smiling with naive happiness, we
feel our heart beat faster.
We therefore feel, but also see with our
bodies. We might appreciate a grandiose
mountain when we raise our heads to observe
its summit, feel infinitely little, yet open our
arms in admiration and widen our stance to
imitate the mountains aparent stability. I he
more our body is flexible, the more it will
perceive and the more acute its perception
will be. At the same time, through the class of
bodily expression, the students are made to
realize the limits of their perception and the
subjectivity of their depiction of their sur
roundings.
I he bell rings again as we now push the
door open to the music class. After learning
to perceive, music will teach expression and
communication. Fhe first part of the hour is
dedicated to listening to music. During this
time, the student realizes the potential music
has to evoke feelings, images, ideas, hopes
and states. Listening to music that moves in
its simplicity and harmonious perfection will
encourage the members of the class to strive
for beauty in communicating and describing
their perceptions. Furthermore, before
description can occur, the beauty of the
rhythm, color, tone and harmony of music
will serve as an example of life, like the arm
of an old grand-parent around the students
shoulders, providing a certain stability and
continuity - almost a morality.
Insisting on this personal influence of
music, the next hour concentrates on inter
pretation, which begins to introduce the stu
dents to creation. From a great silence, a stu
dent will stroke a string and a note will rise,
timidly at first, then with more color and
shape, until it will fill the room. The student
will listen to his or her creation, indulge in it,
see it grow, become proud of it, but also learn
to keep quiet when the maestro stands to
speak and to humbly sculpt the note a little
differently. Music will have taught the stu
dents the ability they have to give value,
importance and movement to their lives,
which remain, though, in eternal change like
the music they play.
The hour of interpretation will therefore
last until the music which the students play

will become the lite they lead, with the same
intensity they heard in their first section of
music appreciation. It is thus time to move on
to composition and creation of a personal
message of communication. Thanks to its light
wings of universality, this musical message will
cross all linguistic and geographical bound
aries to reach the ensemble of our surround
ings. All will be able to hear the notes of the
instruments and their harmony will reverber
ate in all modes of communication and expres
sion. What is a poem with no rhyme or tex
ture, a book with no cadence, crescendos or
color, and a modern building with no harmo
ny or rhythm? Music will therefore accompa
ny creation in all disciplines.
In the middle of all these tunes, the ring
ing of the bell is dissimulated, yet it is time to
move to the next classroom in which mathe
matics are taught. Appropriately last in the
day, math ensures that the dynamic between
bodily expression and music, perception and
expression, remains fluid and interactive.
There exists a fundamental curiosity in the
approach of mathematics, which, because of
its deductive nature, is never satisfied with an
assertion. I his questioning spirit, inherent in
the practice of math, will encourage its stu
dents to take nothing for granted. I hey will
not be surprised when the saying of a wise
man or a text of the past seem to negate an
accepted social dynamic. For instance, is our
popular ideal of freedom really an individual
istic concept oriented at self-consciousness
and is it so important? What about the peas
ant who will say that one is free only in the
life of the couple, or the old Einstein who,
reflecting on man-kind, smirked at the idea
that one is ever able to think on one's own, or
Taoism which sustains that one is only free
when one ceases to exist as an individual and
breathes at the same cadence as the wind
blowing in the trees? The student of mathe
matics will not be surprised. On the side of
bodily expression, math therefore encourages
to admire, ask and observe, without consid
ering the world to be the scene of ones per
sonal hopes and wishes. On the side of music,
math encourages creation, but always the
requestioning of values and meaning. Thanks
to the approach of math, perception and cre
ation are never fixed and need each other to
be fulfilled. It is dance, therefore, which may
be this ideal of education, in which move
ment and melodies intimately fuse.
Have we learned to dance at Stanford?
Have we learned to perceive, remember, under
stand, appreciate, admire, create, listen, respect,
communicate, accept, destroy, question, re
build and observe? If music does not rise from
the classrooms of all disciplines and if move
ment does not enliven the columns of the
quad, then four years will have gone by too
slowly. When will we be fit to receive from the
world around us and to give back to it?
