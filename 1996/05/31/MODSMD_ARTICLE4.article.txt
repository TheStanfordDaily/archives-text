X erhaps I m paranoid, but in recent months it seems that academia
has been taking it on the chin. Although the ivory tower has histori
cally served as target practice for political broadsides, of late the
attacks against it in the mainstream media have taken on a more shrill
and sweeping tone. And since most academics remain on the left side
of this country's political discourse, it is mainly liberal intellectuals
who have been sent scrambling by the latest round of thought-bash
ing.
112 irst there was the capture of Theodore Kaczynski in upstate
Montana and the revelation that the man who allegedly spent two
decades terrorizing academics throughout the United States was him
self a casualty of academic culture, a Harvard man, no less, who
slipped through the cracks of Berkeley's math department in the mid
'6os. Pundits fell over themselves at this delicious irony, and took the
opportunity to wonder whether the Unabomber's pathology repre
sented merely radical New Left politics taken to their logical extreme.
Rather than seek a deeper understanding of this troubled soul and its
unresolved demons, observers looking for political points wondered
what corrosive disease endemic to rarefied institutions like Harvard
and Berkeley could have produced such a distaste tor human life.
Similar questions, on a smaller scale, arose earlier this spring with
the publication of "Life and I error in Stalin's Russia 1934-1941," a
book by a young Harvard professor who put forth the unoriginal
claim that scholarly estimates of Stalinism's victims have been exag-

gerared. Admittedly, the
resurgence of the C 'ommunist
Parry in Russia has made
most Americans chary of any
attempt to diminish the hor
ror of Stalin's regime. But
while questions regarding the
books scholarship may he
legitimate, critics used it more
as an opportunity to discredit

RESTORING PUBLIC FAITH IN THE
VIABILITY AND RELEVANCE OF HONEST
SCHOLARSHIP IS A TASK FOR LIBERALS AND
CONSERVATIVES ALIKE

the whole enterprise of revisionist history. Writing in The New York
Times, Adam I lochschild, a founder of San Francisco's progressive
magazine Mother Jones, contended that "new interpretations" of his
tory can lead to a "sterile, artificial history that loses all connection
with human beings and events that never made their way into official
records."
But the crowning blow to the academy's considerable ego desend
ed this month, when a I physicist disclosed that an article chock
fill of jibberish academic jargon written for the journal Social Text was
actually a hoax, a mocking of trendy leftist scholarship which suppos
edly tries to deny the existence of objective realities. Conservatives
gloated that the fraudluent articles successful publication had exposed
the left as hopelessly lost in its arcane enterprise, out of touch with and
unable to influence the real world.
I laving spent the last four years learning and living in this culture,
I find that there's some merit in .ill of these critiques of academia. At
different points and to differing degrees, the academy is elitist, con
fining and increasingly ineffective in providing answers and guidance
to society's pressing problems, l ew scholars have currency to people
outside their department, let alone their university.
And yet this election-year attack on intellectuals is probably even
more dangerous than what scholars themselves are saving. At a time
when citizens are subject to torrents of television commericals and
political soundbites and subversive platitudes advertised as truth, the
role of critics and intellectuals, whose value lies precisely in their dis
tance from the mainstream, seems all the more urgent.
Acknowledging academia's many shortcomings while still restoring
public faith in the viability and relevance of honest scholarship is a
daunting and humbling task, to be sure. It is one for liberals and con
servatives alike.
