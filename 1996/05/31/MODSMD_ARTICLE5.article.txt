Mia Sara Bruch's articic on
"Stanfordiaspora" in your Winter 1996
issue omitted several salient facts regarding
Jewish life on campus. Most prominent
among these is the physical and symbolic
presence of a Christian church on the
Quad Mrs. Stanford's desire that the
church be "non-denominational and wel
coming to students of all religious back
grounds is evidence not of her anti-
Semitism, but rather of a kind of ingenu
ous ignorance of Jews, and the ways in
which we are different from Christians.
This not-always-ingenuous ignorance has
characterized the University's attitude
toward Jews throughout most of its exis
tence.
There surely was anti-Semitism here
for more than half our history. As recently
as i960, there existed hostility in some
quarters to the inclusion of Jews on the
faculty. While no official acknowledge
ment of undergraduate quotas has ever
been made, those intimately involved in
the admissions process in the mid-6os
readily admitted their existence. Jewish
high school students in l.os Angeles were
discouraged by their college counselors
from applying to Stanford 111 the 60s; it
was widely believed that Stanford would
not accept more than one Jew from any
one high school. As .1 student here during
that era, 1 saw no evidence to contradict
that belief.
The good news is how far the institu
tion has come, and how many efforts have
been made bv so many to make Jewish stu
dents feel welcome here. We still, however,
have a long way to go. Many of our East
Coast "competitors' have a kosher meal
option as part of their food service. A sig
nificant number have excellent Hillel facil
ities that include synagogues or at least
truly non-denominational chapels.
This University has done much;
it needs to do more.

BILL GATES
Among Jim Luhs complaints about Bill
Gates in the Winter 96 edition was that
Gates $6,000,000 contribution to
Stanford was small in proportion to Gates
wealth.
Recently 1 read a Charlotte, N.C.
newspaper article about Gates' contribu
tions to their library. Their article also
mentioned that Mr. Gates gave
$6,000,000 to the United Negro College
Fund. Knowing journalists desires for fair
ness, I felt sure Jim Luh would be interest
ed in this fact.
Sometimes I find myself tempted to
"bad-mouth" successful people, because
they are such interesting, easy targets and
are rarely defended. Maybe my defense of
Bill Gates (a man I have no connection
whatsoever with) will erase some of my
guilt for the times I have succumbed to
that temptation.
