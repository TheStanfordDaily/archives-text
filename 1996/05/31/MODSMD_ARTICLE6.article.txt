# Hannah Arendt to Gertrud and Karl Jaspers, Christmas 1964
## 
### 
"There is nothing special to report here. We are fine and are leading quite a peaceful existence. I here will he
more of a stir next week because a number of friends are coming. Tomorrow we are going to the wedding ot
Gerhard Casper (from Hamburg), who once visited you and whom you liked very much. 1 think 1 told you
about his stormy love affair, which one would hardly have expected from a stolid Hamburger. Now the nev.
couple is blissfully happy, and, as my mother used to say, wherever love falls, it makes a great crash, the
crash in this case is gargantuan. He has in the meantime become an assistant professor at Berkeley, and she is
finishing medical school here. I hey re having their wedding here because our friend Frau Beradt very kindK
volunteered to host the reception and because neither one of them has any other family here. Not that we are
really family, but we have been adopted, which is all great fun.
â€” from Hannah Arendt - Karl Jaspers, Correspondence, 1926-1969
