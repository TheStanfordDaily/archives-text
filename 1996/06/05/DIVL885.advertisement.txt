Before you head oft touring through
Tanzania, backpacking across
Budapest, or studying in Singapore,
make sure you realize the health risks
of the area. This week, Healthline
provides you with some travel tips for
your summer adventures. Of course,
not all of these tips are relevant for
every country, use the resources listed
at the bottom to find the information
relevant to your destination!
•Fill your prescriptions before you go.
Carry them in the original container
with the prescription.
•Check your health insurance to see if
you are covered while traveling abroad.
Many insurance companies provide
overseas health insurance for an added
fee.
•Bring your own condoms and sper

ing "lubricated with reservoir tip" with
your Russian-English dictionary. If you
don't use your supply, they make great
going away presents. STDs should be
a big worry for you if you are going to
be sexually active on the international
scale. Know your risk and use
protection.
•Carry a small card with your emer
gency information and what hospital
you would like to be taken to in an
emergency. One side should be in
English and the other in the country's
language.
•Items you may want to pack: a
small, portable first aid kit, bug spray,
and a water filter or purification tablets.
If you are concerned about unsterilized
medical equipment, you can purchase
a kit with sterilized syringes, catheters,
latex gloves, and other important med
ical items. (There is a danger of some
of these items being confused with
drug paraphernalia, so ask questions
regarding your destination before you
buy a kit.) Travel Medicine Inc. sells
