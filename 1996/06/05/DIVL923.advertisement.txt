TIPS FOR CLOSING
Departure Dates and Times All undergraduates except those granted pardons by the
housing office must leave town by high noon Thursday, June 13 Leave town, and don't
ever come back. You've lost your Stanford privileges.
Any student failing to vacate the residence by the deadline will be sealed in his/her room
before it is subsequently set aflame.
Hallways All hallways as well as common areas must be clear of all belongings at all
times, for your own safety). Your mother doesn't live here, and I sure as hell don't have
the time to pick up all the shit you just decide to leave around.
Goodwill: If you have any items, including your bikes, that you do not want to ship home
or store, you can sell them on an impromptu "black market," that will be set up by Goodwill
in Wilbur Parking Lot. Likewise, you may also purchase or trade for other items, including
firearms, illegal drug paraphernalia, and abandoned newborn infants, before you leave
for the summer.
Bikes Any bikes left behind at the end of the school year will be considered abandoned.
Those which remain will be removed and taken to the Campus Bike Shop where they will
be marked up for resale.
Lofts: Those are the things that allow you to loft your bed to a higher altitude. Hence the
name "Lofts."
Room Repairs If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Damage Bills If you have any damage bills pending, please take care of them before
you leave. Any bill not paid or arbited by the end of the week can result in uninvited guests
