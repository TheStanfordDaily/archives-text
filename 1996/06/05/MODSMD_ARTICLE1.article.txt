## Tversky dies from cancer 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
For 59 years, Psychology Prof.
Amos Tversky never lost a battle.
Three days after he died of metasta
tic melanoma, Tversky is being re
membered by family and friends as
a legend.
"We lost an intellectual giant,"
an emotional Psychology and Law
Prof. David Rosenhan told his ab
normal psychology class yesterday.
A public memorial service will be
held at Hills of Eternity in Colma
today at 3 p.m. A service at Stanford
will be held this fall.
The son of a veterinarian and an
Israeli parliament member, Tver
sky rose through the ranks of the Is
raeli army, seeing action in 1956,
1967 and 1973. He won Israel's
highest honor for personal bravery.

Since 1973, Tversky fought eco
nomic and psychological assump
tions, not wars.
Graduating from Hebrew Uni
versity in 1961, Tversky moved
temporarily to the United States to
earn his doctorate at the University
of Michigan. He returned to Hebrew
University before coming to Stan
ford in 1978.
Tversky's work at Stanford ex
tended far beyond the bounds of the
Psychology Department, where he
taught for 18 years. The impact of
his research in judgment and
human decision making was felt not
only among psychologists but also
among people ranging from econo
mists to players in the National Bas
ketball Association.
"Amos came as close to being the
