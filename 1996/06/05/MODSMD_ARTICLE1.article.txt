# 'We lost an intellectual giant'
## Tversky dies from cancer 
### Brian Singer Editorial staff 
For 59 years, Psychology Prof.
Amos Tversky never lost a battle.
Three days after he died of metasta
tic melanoma, Tversky is being re
membered by family and friends as
a legend.
"We lost an intellectual giant,"
an emotional Psychology and Law
Prof. David Rosenhan told his ab
normal psychology class yesterday.
A public memorial service will be
held at Hills of Eternity in Colma
today at 3 p.m. A service at Stanford
will be held this fall.
The son of a veterinarian and an
Israeli parliament member, Tver
sky rose through the ranks of the Is
raeli army, seeing action in 1956,
1967 and 1973. He won Israel's
highest honor for personal bravery.

Since 1973, Tversky fought eco
nomic and psychological assump
tions, not wars.
Graduating from Hebrew Uni
versity in 1961, Tversky moved
temporarily to the United States to
earn his doctorate at the University
of Michigan. He returned to Hebrew
University before coming to Stan
ford in 1978.
Tversky's work at Stanford ex
tended far beyond the bounds of the
Psychology Department, where he
taught for 18 years. The impact of
his research in judgment and
human decision making was felt not
only among psychologists but also
among people ranging from econo
mists to players in the National Bas
ketball Association.
"Amos came as close to being the


Tversky
ideal of a university faculty member
as any colleague I have known in my
almost four decades in higher edu
cation," University President Ger
hard Casper said yesterday.
Tversky originally studied "cog
nitive illusions," which are biasing
characteristics of human judgment.
11 is later work included books on
uncertainty, conflict resolution and
a forthcoming book on statistical
reasoning.
Elected to the American Acade
my of Arts and Sciences in 1980,
Tversky has since been awarded
honorary doctorates by the Univer
sity of Chicago, Yale University, the
State University of New York at
Buffalo and Sweden's University of
Goteberg.
In studies on rational choice,
Tversky found that the manner in
which choices are explained influ
ences their outcome. People are
more likely to prefer surgery when
the chances are explained in terms
of survival and not death.
A 1988 study released during the

NBA playoffs theorized that basket
ball players are more likely to miss a
shot after they score one, so hot
streaks occur randomly.
"Aside from [being] an extraordi
narily distinguished scientist and
contributing to psychology, eco
nomics and the University as a
whole, as a department member, he
was an incredibly valued colleague,"
said Psychology Prof. Ellen Mark
man, the department's chair.
At Stanford, Tversky served
on the Faculty Senate and for the
last three years chaired the Advi
sory Board of the Academic
Council. In 1993, he chaired the
search committee for dean of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
As chair of the Advisor}- Board,
Tversky recommended faculty ap
pointments and department re
structuring to Provost Condoleezza
Rice. Rice yesterday remembered
Tversky as an outstanding citizen
and scholar.
"I always thought of him as the
embodiment of the highest values of
the University," she said. "He had
high, uncompromising standards
and yet a warmth and sense of
humor that made him the easiest of

colleagues to be around. I will miss
him tremendously â€” and so will
Stanford."
Tversky won a five-year
Mac Arthur Foundation fellowship
in 1984 and has also received recog
nition from the American Psycho
logical Association and the Society
of Experimental Psychologists.
"His dedication to Stanford and
its institutions of faculty gover
nance was exemplary until the very
end," Casper said.
His academic work at Stanford
included research with both the
Center for International Security
and Arms Control and the Center
on Conflict and Negotiation at Stan
ford.
"Losses loom larger than gains,"
he said in 1988. "A trade-off that, on
objective grounds, both sides would
be happier having is extremely diffi
cult to negotiate."
Tversky is survived by his wife
Barbara, also a psychology profes
sor at Stanford, his sons Oren of San
Francisco and Tal of Stanford, his
daughter Dona of Stanford and his
sister Ruth Ariel of Jerusalem.
In lieu of flowers, the Tversky
family asks that contributions be
made to donors' favorite charities.
