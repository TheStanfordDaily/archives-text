# Israel's new leader talks with old rival

JERUSALEM (AP) - Aban
doning tough opposition talk for
the smoother sounds of gover
nance, Benjamin Netanyahu sat
down yesterday with the man he
defeated and professed to share
his views on many critical
issues.
In fact, after their first post
election meeting, the prime min
ister-elect said he was looking
forward to more sessions with
rival Shimon Peres, whom he
once described as "deluded."
Such talk fueled speculation
that Netanyahu would invite
Peres' defeated Labor Party into
his government — a move that
could keep hard-liners at bay and
allay the fears of Israel's Arab
negotiating partners, who worry
Netanyahu will renege on promis
es made by the Peres government.
Netanyahu's conciliatory tone
was matched by some Labor
leaders, who spoke of joining
Netanyahu in a national unity
coalition to assure the peace pro
cess advances.
After a three-hour meeting,

Netanyahu and Peres smiled and
shook hands, and Netanyahu
affectionately addressed the out
going prime minister as "Shi
mon" — in sharp contrast to the
personal attacks of the cam
paign.
"The main issues we discussed
were security," Netanyahu said,
adding that the two shared "a
broad consensus" on the issue.
Meetings with Peres, he
added, were "always interesting,
beneficial and fascinating."
Israel's Channel 2 TV, mean
while, reported that Labor and
Likud officials had been dis
cussing the possibility of a coali
tion.
It said Likud officials were
working on policy guidelines that
would be acceptable to Labor and
ease Arab concerns. These
include honoring existing
accords with the Palestinians
and an agreement with Lebanon
that would enable Israel to with
draw from the border strip it
occupies in southern Lebanon,
the report said.
