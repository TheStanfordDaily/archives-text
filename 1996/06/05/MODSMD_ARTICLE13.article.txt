# Government says Chrysler must recall 91,000 vehicles
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The govern
ment told Chrysler Corp. yesterday to
recall more than 91,000 Chryslers and
Dodges because of unsafe seat belts, then
went to court to enforce the order after
the company refused to go along.
Chrysler had told the National High
way Traffic Safety Administration
months ago that it would not comply with
any recall of the 1995 model cars. That
prompted the Justice Department to file
a federal civil lawsuit to force the compa
ny to notify owners and fix the Chrysler
Cirrus and Dodge Stratus cars for free.
This is the first time the government
has taken such action based on its own
safety tests, though the traffic safety
agency has taken manufacturers to court
on eight previous occasions for alleged
defects based on accidents and engineer
ing analysis. The government has lost
only one of those cases.
In January, the government deter

mined the cars' rear seat belt system was
not strong enough because a weld nut
anchoring the belt pulled out of the floor
of a 1995 Chrysler Cirrus during a rou
tine test. The same system is used in the
Dodge Stratus.
Chrysler lawyer Lewis Goldfarb said
the court battle has implications for all
automakers because the testing proce
dure wasn't clear on what the company
had to do to comply.
Chrysler officials also said in a state
ment that on the road, as opposed to a
government test, "there has not been a
single incident of rear seat belt anchor
failure, injury o' - complaint."
"We're taking a huge public relations
hit. This has to be real important to this
company," said Goldfarb in a telephone
interview from Auburn Hills, Mich.
The government requires a seat belt
system to sustain a 3,000-pound load for
10 seconds. In the government test, the

belt pulled out before the 3,000-pound
load was attained.
The agency and Chrysler are arguing
over the position of the government's
testing equipment. The government posi
tioned the equipment several inches far
ther away from the seat back than the
automaker did.
Government documents said Chrysler
duplicated the highway safety agency's
test and the belt still failed. However,
Chrysler said if the testing equipment is
placed closer to the seat, the anchor sys
tem works properly.
Agency officials say it is well known
that they can test the seat belt system
from several different positions if a regu
lation is not specific.
"Our safety standard ensures that
seat belts perform properly when used,
and provide users at least a minimum
level of protection," said agency head
Ricardo Martinez.
