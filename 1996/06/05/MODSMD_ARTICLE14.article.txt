## Destroyer's shot resulted from mechanical problem, officials say

HONOLULU (AP) - A mechanical
problem may be the reason a Japanese
destroyer, aiming at a target being
towed by a U.S. attack bomber, instead
shot the plane from the sky during war
games, a Japanese navy official said.
The two U.S. Navy aviators aboard
the aircraft ejected and were rescued by
the Japanese vessel Yuugiri, which had
shot them down with missiles fired from
its American-made weapons system.
Japan quickly apologized for the acci
dent in the Pacific Ocean, which hap
pened at 7:15 p.m. HST Monday (10:15
a.m. PDT yesterday) some 1,600 miles
west of Hawaii.
The pilot, Lt. Cmdr. William Royster
of Kansas City, Mo., and bombardier
navigator, Lt. Keith Douglas of Birm
ingham, Ala., were picked out of the

ocean by the Yuugiri minutes after their
A-6E Intruder hit the water, then
returned to their own ship, the aircraft
carrier USS Independence.
Royster was in good condition after
surgery for facial lacerations, while
Douglas was treated for superficial
abrasions and returned to duty, accord
ing to Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Alderson, a U.S.
Pacific Fleet spokesman.
"It's a unique and unfortunate acci
dent, but it's not a tragedy because we
recovered both crew members in good
condition," said Capt. Steve Clawson,
another Pacific Fleet spokesman.
The 450-foot Yuugiri, which carries a
crew of about 200, was using a 20 mm
Phalanx weapons system capable of fir
ing bursts of 3,000 rounds per minute,
said Tensuke Kobayashi, a Japanese

navy official.
Kobayashi said the accident may
have been caused by mechanical trouble
in the Phalanx weapons system, which
was made by General Dynamics in
Pomona, Calif. "Apparently the missiles
were launched when they weren't
meant to be," he said.
Cmdr. Keith Arteburn, another U.S.
Pacific Fleet spokesman, said he
couldn't confirm whether a mechanical
malfunction was at fault.
Royster's mother, Carolyn Royster,
said she heard about the accident from
her daughter-in-law, Carol Royster, in a
predawn call yesterday from her son's
home in Atsugi, Japan.
"You don't think these things are
going to happen," Mrs. Royster said
from her home in Kansas City, Mo.
