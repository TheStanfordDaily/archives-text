Rabbi Yosef Chitrik, armed with a carbine, escorts a group of religious Jewish
women students past an elderly Arab man yesterday as they tour a Jewish set
tlement in the heart of the town. Israeli Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu
said he had to study the previous government's agreement to redeploy Israeli
troops in Hebron before stating his position.
