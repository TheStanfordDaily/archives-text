# Tax break?
## Clinton proposes student credit 
### 
PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) - President Clinton,
in a election-year bidding war with Bob Dole over
tax breaks, proposed a $1,500-a-student tax credit
yesterday for the first two years of college, saying
to Americans: "Go to college, we'll pay the
tuition."
Clinton's proposal, to be financed by higher
taxes on corporations and a $16-per-passenger
departure fee for international flights, brought
immediate ridicule from his Republican rival.
"There he goes again," said Dole, borrowing
Ronald Reagan's 1980 put-down of then-President
Carter. "Who knows what taxes he'll increase if he
should be re-elected."
Campaigning in Chester, Va., Dole said Clinton
had promised a middle-class tax cut when he cam
paigned in 1992, only to increase taxes after tak
ing office. Dole, the presumptive GOP nominee, is
crafting his own economic plan, which is expected
to include a tax cut proposal.
Clinton unveiled his tax-credit plan in a com
mencement address at Princeton University,
whose $21,000-a-year tuition makes it one of the
most expensive colleges in the country. His pro
posal has no chance of being approved by the
GOP-led Congress in this presidential election
year.
The tax credit would cost $7.9 billion over six
years. Combined with an earlier Clinton proposal
to offer $10,000 tax deductions for college expens
es, the total price tag would be $42.9 billion,
according to the White House.
