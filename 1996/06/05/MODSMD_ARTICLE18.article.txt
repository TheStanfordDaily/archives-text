## Editor's Farewell 
### 
People have often
asked me what exactly I do as
editor in chief. And some
times, I wonder what to tell them.
As the saying goes, it can be lonely
at the top. Contrary to what some
people think, I do not regularly
write the words that appear in this
box. Even though I'm in charge of
the newspaper, I often don't write
any articles, take any photographs,
layout any of the pages or even
write those three cute words that
appear on the bottom of the front
page every day.
Essentially, my job is to listen to
criticism. With the vast amount of
outspoken people that live on cam
pus, there is no shortage of those
who are critical of what is printed in
The Daily. Although we receive
fewer letters to the editor than most
believe, it is rare to receive praise
rather than pan. This is not entire
ly unexpected; dissatisfied people
are much more likely to want to
make their views known than oth
ers.
In my role as editor, I am ulti
mately responsible for every word
that appears in the newspaper.
Throughout it all, I have tried to
respond to complaints. We have
printed numerous letters which
called into question editorial deci
sions, and I thank our readers who
have taken the time to bring these
mistakes to our attention. The
Daily is a learning process for all of
us — both as journalists and for
members of the community in
learning how to deal with journal
ists — and having an open dialogue
helps these ends.
Debates such as those that have
appeared on these pages are not just
tertiary here at Stanford, but an
integral part of a university's mis
sion. We are taught to look at an
issue from all sides and be critical of
others while at the same time
acknowledging diversity of opinion.
Which is why I was particularly
amazed last week when a member
of the Faculty Senate said the body
should consider excluding The
Daily from meetings because of an
editorial published in the May 20
issue.
It does not matter what this piece
was about or how harsh its criticism
may have been. The action reflects a
larger trend that seems to be recur

ring throughout this year: the loss
of student input in the University
bureaucracy.
Students at the Food Research
Institute and in the Science, Tech
nology and Society and East Asian
Studies programs were not warned
before their areas of studies were
cut, consolidated or eliminated. Stu
dents might also have been able to
serve as members of the Planning
and Policy Board, a committee
which is charged by the Faculty
Senate to look at the broader issues
of undergraduate and graduate edu
cation in the next few years.
But the faculty did not let stu
dents become involved in these deci
sions — at least, not until crucial
decisions had already been made.
And now, a member of the faculty
has said they should consider mov
ing their decision-making processes
even further into the dark. By
excluding The Daily's reporters
from the Faculty Senate, the only
source of information about what
happens there would be the Univer
sity's News Service, which func
tions as the public relations arm of
Stanford.
Those who are in charge of mak
ing decisions regarding how stu
dents are educated are becoming
increasingly cut off from the con
cerns of the students they are here
to educate. With tuition rising at
alarming rates, the University sim
ply cannot afford to ignore student
concerns. Today's students are
tomorrow's alumni; outreach to
current students should consist of
more than asking for a $19.96 check
at the end of their academic careers.
Members of the faculty and staff
must make sure to keep their ears
open to hear both praise and criti
cism. An impulse to shut off any dis
senting voice only shows incredibly
narrow vision. Many others on this
campus have proved they have the
conviction of their opinions to take
the inevitable criticism, whether in
classes, activities or in real-world
jobs. The faculty should do no less.
