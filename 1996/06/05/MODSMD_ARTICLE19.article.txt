Stanford Review provides sensible, conservative outlook

SETH GOLDSTEIN'S STAFF
notebook in last Friday's edition
of The Daily is more than a little
disturbing. Goldstein, a self-identified
conservative, took it upon himself to
level a slew of criticism at The Stan
ford Review, a publication which he
dismissed as "churlish" and "uncon
structive." He likened The Review to
Pat Buchanan in saying that it scared
potential adherents of conservatism
away from away from the ideology
because of the paper's "reactionary"
views. While I don't personally know
Goldstein and therefore won't question
the validity of his self-described conser
vatism, I would like to object to much
of what he claimed in his column.
First of all, Goldstein denounces The
Review as a breeding ground for shrill
ness and barbarity, but he fails to
expand this charge beyond the form of
mere generalizations. While in my
tenure as editor in chief for the paper
I've heard many people on campus take
similar stances as Goldstein's; hardly
any of them actually have anything spe

cific to offer in the way of constructive
criticism. Sweeping statements are easy
to generate, especially when facts are
not cited to back them up, and it seems
Goldstein has fallen into this trap.
Goldstein mocks The Review's news
articles as poor in journalistic quality
and as "blur[ring] the line between the
news and the op-ed pages." I'll admit
we're not going to win any Pulitzers for
our news stories, but The Daily isn't
going to either. And contrary to what
Goldstein implies, The Review has pub
lished more than a few informative and
investigative pieces that haven't been
seen elsewhere. Or do I need to remind
which paper it was that first uncovered
the situation surrounding the Office of
Student Activities' manipulation of The
Stanford Directory, that first brought
to light the Financial Aid Office's prac
tice of using racial discrimination in
determining financial aid awards and
that first published an examination of
the administration's emphasis on pub
lic relations (a full two months before
The Daily ran a very similar article)? Of

course, discussing specifics like these is
not as easy as producing sweeping
statements.
In regards to The Review's op-ed
pages, Goldstein is similarly vague. He
says our columnists "spew out mean
spirited garbage" and damage conser
vatism's credibility. And to what spe
cific examples, I ask, is Goldstein refer
ring? Could it be Mike Meyer's critique
of the Career Planning and Placement
Center? Julie Johnson's defense of the
Program in Science, Technology and
Society? Maybe it's Thorvin Ander
son's call to reform the Distribution
Requirement system? Or Alec Rawls'
analysis of the flat tax, perhaps? The
bottom line is that both the columns
and the editorials in The Review
address pertinent and pressing issues
concerning Stanford, and they do so in
a methodical and sensible manner.
Sure, we do publish light-hearted fea
tures like Smoke Signals, For the
Record, Meyer on Beer and Bruce Gib
ney's The Final Word, but these fea
tures are meant to entertain, not

unlike The Daily's Diversions. I would
suspect that most people on this cam
pus are clever enough to differentiate
between a serious piece and a humor
column.
While Goldstein's vague innuendoes
fall short of the mark in terms of hav
ing any apparent intellectual, construc
tive usefulness, he is absolutely correct
in one important aspect. This campus
hates The Review. Hundreds of copies
of our paper are destroyed every week,
staffers are routinely taunted as racists
and fascists by their peers, and some of
our writers even used to receive death
threats upon occasion. I suspect that
Goldstein's analysis confuses cause and
effect; conservatism is not hated
because of The Review, but rather The
Review is hated because it is conserva
tive. And in an open and non-judgmen
tal environment like Stanford, a reac
tionary and narrow doctrine like con
servatism simply cannot be tolerated.
