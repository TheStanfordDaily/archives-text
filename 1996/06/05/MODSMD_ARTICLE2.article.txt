## 
### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
The cost of parking on campus
will increase next fall when the
price of permits and metered park
ing rises.
The Office of Transportation
Programs has announced that "A"
parking permits will increase by
$20, to a total of $310 a year, and
that "C" and resident student per
mits will be raised by $ 10, bringing
them to $90 for the full year. Park
ing meters will be adjusted to
charge twice as much as they cur
rently do so that it will cost $1 to
park per hour. The meter increase
is the first since 1990 .
"We increase prices a little
every year to pay for the construc
tion and operation of transporta
tion programs," said Julia Fre
mon, manager of Transportation
Programs. "This price increase is
the same that we have had every

year for the last eight years."
Fremon said the increase in the
price of parking permits will help
ensure that visitors, as well as per
mit holders, share in the costs of
the parking system.
Beginning this fall, students,
faculty and staff can purchase
nine-month permits instead of
three separate quarterly permits.
The price for a nine-month permit
will be $235 for "A" lots, $70 for
"C" lots and residential lots and
$25 for "Z" lots. Parking lots differ
in proximity to central campus and
common workplaces.
"Z" permits are being reduced
from $40 to $30 annually, and
service vehicle permits will in
crease by $60, to a total of $540.
Motorcycle stickers will rise
from $15 to $20.
Currently, most "A" permit
holders are upperclassmen and
graduate students who live off
