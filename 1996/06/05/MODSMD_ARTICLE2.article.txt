# Cost of on-campus parking to increase
## 
### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
The cost of parking on campus
will increase next fall when the
price of permits and metered park
ing rises.
The Office of Transportation
Programs has announced that "A"
parking permits will increase by
$20, to a total of $310 a year, and
that "C" and resident student per
mits will be raised by $ 10, bringing
them to $90 for the full year. Park
ing meters will be adjusted to
charge twice as much as they cur
rently do so that it will cost $1 to
park per hour. The meter increase
is the first since 1990 .
"We increase prices a little
every year to pay for the construc
tion and operation of transporta
tion programs," said Julia Fre
mon, manager of Transportation
Programs. "This price increase is
the same that we have had every

year for the last eight years."
Fremon said the increase in the
price of parking permits will help
ensure that visitors, as well as per
mit holders, share in the costs of
the parking system.
Beginning this fall, students,
faculty and staff can purchase
nine-month permits instead of
three separate quarterly permits.
The price for a nine-month permit
will be $235 for "A" lots, $70 for
"C" lots and residential lots and
$25 for "Z" lots. Parking lots differ
in proximity to central campus and
common workplaces.
"Z" permits are being reduced
from $40 to $30 annually, and
service vehicle permits will in
crease by $60, to a total of $540.
Motorcycle stickers will rise
from $15 to $20.
Currently, most "A" permit
holders are upperclassmen and
graduate students who live off
campus. These students rely on "A"
permits so that they can find park
ing more quickly than they would in
"C" lots, which are generally farther
away from campus and more crowd
ed.
Postdoctoral student Pam Kato
said she used to spend up to 30 min
utes looking for a parking space in a
"C" lot, especially when it rained.
She said the price of the permit does
not bother her; rather, the availabil
ity of parking spaces is the problem.
"I couldn't afford 30 minutes to
look for parking everyday," Kato
said. Kato switched to an "A" park
ing permit for convenience.
Like Kato, senior William
Mitchell said he used to have a "C"
parking permit, but that "it was al
most impossible to find parking."
Mitchell said next fall's increase
in meter fares bothers him more

than the increase in the cost of "A"
permits. He said metered parking
takes space away from "A" lots.
Parking abuses also are a disadvan
tage to permit holders, he said.
"People park in metered spacing
without paying and then risk get
ting ticketed. In the meantime, per
mit holders have fewer places to
park," Mitchell said.
Senior George Perry said the rise
in permit prices is "ridiculous." Be
cause he lives off campus, Perry
must commute every day to class.
Finding a parking space is not al
ways easy.
"It's a daily competition," Perry
said.
Like Kato, Geriy Robinson, se
nior construction manager of Fa
cilities Project Management, said
he needs an "A" parking permit so
he can find parking spaces quickly.
Robinson said he has to go back
and forth across campus all day, so
he does not have time to look for
parking in each location. As for the
increase in the price of parking

permits, he said it is reasonable.
"It's not bad compared to park
ing in the city," Robinson said.
In an attempt to broaden public
transportation, Transportation
Programs has expanded the Mar
guerite shuttle to serve Menlo Park
starting in September. It will link
Stanford, downtown Menlo Park,
the Menlo Park train station,
Sharon Heights and the area
around Sand Hill Road near Inter
state 280.
Two new "Z" parking lots will
also be added to expand parking on
campus, one at the Stanford Stadi
um lot and the other at Quarry and
Arboretum Roads. "Z" lots current
ly exist on Stock Farm Road and
Campus Drive, and at the Track
House.
The Office of Transportation
Programs said applications for
1996-97 parking permits and other
transportation information will be
distributed to all employees
through interdepartmental mail
this summer.
