# University should form inter-faith religious center outside Mem Chu
## 
### 
Perhaps you should be thanked for
last Wednesday's rather misleading
editorial, "Church Functions." It
might provide the opportunity to
inform the Stanford Community of
the efforts by the Dean Gregg of
Memorial Church to provide support
for all religious perspectives on the
campus.
Memorial Church is only one small
part of the dean's staff responsibilities

on the Stanford campus. In fact, the
new associate deans are not associate
deans of Memorial Church, but of reli
gious life at Stanford. For the past 10
years the Dean has given direct sup
port to many different religious faiths
through the Stanford Associated Min
istries. The dean and his staff have
worked with many different Universi
ty departments such as Residential
Education, the Dean of Students
Office, the Women's Center, the Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community
Center, the Haas Center, the ethnic
centers and many more.
If the 1989 earthquake had not
happened, by this time we probably

would have an adequate Inter-Faith
Religious Center on campus to better
serve the entire religious community
on campus. This is another project
that the dean continues to pursue.
Memorial Church has sponsored
many inter-faith forums in the dorms
and in special campus venues, has
established a special inter-faith study
project with some of the full-time
campus ministry staff, and has sup
ported many different forums, confer
ences, special speakers and service
opportunities for people of all faiths.
The fact that Memorial Church is
Christian does not make it impossible
for the staff and adjunct Associated

Ministries from working with people
from all religious faiths. Adding a
Jewish rabbi to the staff in no way is a
token, but part of the total outreach
by Memorial Church to support all the
religious needs of the University com
munity.
The Daily could be most helpful by
giving strong support for the direction
of Memorial Church staff has taken,
and also advocating for the building of
an adequate Inter-Faith Religious
Center as soon as possible.
