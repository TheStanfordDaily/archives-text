## 1996 End of the Year Awards 
### 
SOMEHOW, I ENDED up with the
last column of the year. There's a
problem with that because I simply
can't write the mawkish crap that would
make for an "Oh, it's graduation / One
more year / You're now a member of this
school / Look how far you've come since
prom and orientation in just nine
months" column. So, inspired by Stan
ford Athletic Supporter Todd Bern
stein's Sports Awards, I've decided to
waste space and give a few awards of my
own.
Double Secret Probation Award:
It's hard to say exactly which Greek
organization the University likes least,
with three houses going down in the past
year and at least another two on proba
tion. I'll call it a seven-way tie, as the
University is pretty clearly on the
warpath. Runner-Up: any Indian Cul
tural Event. Someone please explain why
fights keep breaking out and cars get
tipped at these things. Can't we all just
get along?
Employee of the Month, Taco
Bell: Nick Thompson. Runner up: a
recent MTL graduate.
Most Likely to Ruin a Young
Man's Life: The Stanford Daily, which
addressed Mr. Abrams' delicate and con
fusing personal legal problems with the
subtlety of Andrew Dice Clay. Big head
lines, juicy title ("Place-kicker Abrams
Linked to Alleged Sexual Misconduct" —
for pictures of guys?). Runner-Up:

Chemical Engineering. Maybe the most
absurdly difficult major here.
The Colossal Waste of Student
Time and Professor Effort Award:
Math-Science-Engineering Core, slated
to arrive on campus next year. Some
poor professors are slaving over a course
that won't get the respect of Natural
Hazards. Second place: Writing and Crit
ical Thinking.
The Betcha We Get This at
Tresidder Instead of Juice Club
Award: Roy Rogers. Runner-up: CoPo
11.
The Look At This Budding Aca
demic Field Award: STS, for trying to
understand science in our progressively
more technological world. Runner up,
East Asian Studies, for studying the eco
nomic center of the next century.
The Cut That Department
Because Billets Are Inflexible
Award: See above.
Hey, Genius Award: Bill Walsh,
whose hyper-inflated reputation was
ruptured by Willingham. Honorary Men
tion: Prof. Emeritus Robert Cohn, who
said that Willingham was "a disastrous
choice" for a football coach, hired only
because he was black. Ooops.
Most Offensive Columnist Award:
Josh Gohlke's claims that we are all
imbeciles, and Drew Rapp's delightful
vignettes get points for arousing the
homophobes (oh la la). But the winner is
Bruce Gibney of The Review, whose

hatred for all those different from him
self is mind-boggling. Not only is Gibney
really, really, offensive, but he's funny as
hell. That combination of humor and
malice puts Gibney over the top.
Where'd That Monster Come
From Award: The Gates Building.
Jesus, that went up fast.
The Why Wasn't Gates A Fuzzy
Award: Given to the Language Corner.
It's only been seven years.
Eagerly Anticipated Stories of
1996-7: Stanford moves up to second in
U.S. News & World Report. The combi
nation of a language requirement and a
new language center doubles the foreign
language enrollment (but to somewhere
in the high teens). Casper implicated in
bizarre organized crime scheme to give
his arch-nemesis, Harvard President
Rudenstine, some time to "catch up with
his sleep, but with the fishes this time."
Daily columnist pummeled upon acci
dentally entering Arrillaga during varsi
ty athletes' free lift hours. Alicia Silver
stone matriculates. Stanford flies past
Colorado School of Mines to seize 232 nd
place in the Playboy rankings.
Congratulations, graduates, and
everyone else, go have a nice summer.

James is gunning for most offensive
columnist next year.
