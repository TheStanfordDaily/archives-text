## Baseball in Bakersfield: moving beyond Stanford 
### 
WHEN YOU REALLY consider it,
Municipal Stadium, home of minor
league baseball's San Jose Giants,
isn't much of a stadium at all. It seats only
about 3,000 people, most in the steep
amphitheater that encircles the infield of
the park's baseball field. Down the first- and
third-base lines totter rickety metal bleach
ers. Billboard advertisements carpet the
outfield walls, and a well-struck home run
to center field can serve as a free commercial
for Aquafina. It's a sleepy small-town ball
park in the Bay Area's largest city, a single-
A stadium in a place that wants nothing
more than to be big-league.
I've heard that minor league baseball is
great family entertainment, and apparently
others have too, because when I visited
Municipal Stadium last Friday evening, the
place was teeming with second-graders
wearing adjustable baseball caps and over
sized mitts. Tickets cost only $3 and the
crowds are cozy and well-behaved. Most
folks certainly didn't come for the baseball,
the caliber of which rarely rises above
amusing and sub-mediocre.
Along with a group of friends, however,
I had come for the baseball. Actually, we
went to see the visiting Bakersfield team's
starting pitcher, a first-year southpaw who
graduated from Stanford last spring. His

name is Dan, and he and I were roommates
in our freshman dormitory. Most of the rest
of our group lived there too, or had lived
with Dan during his sophomore or junior
years. He had left free tickets for us, which
was nice, since we don't all manage to do
much together these days. None of us had
seen Dan play since his final start at Stan
ford last spring, so the whole affair had one
of those end-of-senior-year kind of feels to
it, at once a wistful reminder of an old ritu
al and a passage into something new.
My memory blurs a little, but as I recall
Dan had already begun unpacking when I
opened the door of our room in Arroyo on
the first day of freshman year. He had a shy
and bookish look to him, and it took me a
while to learn that he played baseball, and
slightly longer to discover that he played it
well. For a few months, Dan tried to con
vince people that he had grown up in a back
country farm in Virginia, even though he
had been educated at a private school in
Washington, DC. He was reasonably con
servative in those days, and the notion of a
dark-skinned West Coast roommate must
have startled him a bit. But we soon found,
as most freshman roommates at Stanford
do, that our backgrounds and interests and
CI) collections were pretty compatible, and
a fine friendship grew from there.

Dan is a modest and thoughtful guy who
carries few airs and downplays his athletic
accomplishments. Even so, I followed his
progress as a pitcher with a mix of admira
tion and envy. There is something extraor
dinary about the ability to hurl a small
leather sphere within centimeters of a tar
get that sits 60 feet away, and to do it with
velocity and guile offers at least the
prospect of professional success. Dan was
always quietly confident about his talents,
and while I feverishly filled my course
schedules with unmanageable units and
fretted about double-majoring or obtaining
a summer internship, he breezed through
his classes, secure in the knowledge that a
major-league contract awaited at the end of
his junior season. To compound my insecu
rities, Dan completed his undergraduate
requirements in three years.
Even when an injury curtailed his last
season at Stanford, Dan's resolve and belief
in his future rarely wavered. Yet he took,
and still takes, an interest in my wanderings
at Stanford and ably conceals his skepticism
when we discuss my chimerical hopes to be
a writer. Late last year, he told his friends
that he was engaged to be married. The
news did not surprise me, but 1 wasn't pre
pared to deal with it. Dan has already
earned his degree and started a professional

career. But did he really grasp the meaning
of his decision? More accurately, did I? The
prospect of my freshman roommate's nup
tials came to symbolize — over the course of
the last six months — all the unfathomable
obligations and burdens of growing older
and growing up, the ones I preferred to set
aside until, at the earliest, the last of my
Stanford springs neared conclusion.
I had kept tabs on Dan's season this year
mainly through second-hand reports, and
none of us were quite sure what to expect
when we took our seats in the outfield
bleachers Friday evening. Things didn't
start well, as a hit and some shoddy defense
led to two runs for the Giants in the first.
But Dan settled down, and on at least a few
occasions he looked unsuited for such mid
dling opposition. Still, it wasn't his best,
and he made it through six full innings
before being relieved by another pitcher.
Amid this amateurish setting, Dan wore
his new professionalism well. When he
pitched at Stanford, he would sprint off the
field after a third out. On Friday, he
trudged back to the dugout at the end of an
inning, head down, muttering to himself.
We hooted and yelled out his new number,
"3-1!" He looked up, smiled wryly and
touched the bill of his cap, just like he did
freshman year.

Dan, like the rest of us with one eye on
life beyond graduation, has options and
anxieties. On Sunday he stopped by my
room and thanked me for coming to his
game. As we normally do, we talked a little
about his pitching, and agreed that he had
trouble retiring hitters on two-strike
counts. Baseball life in Bakersfield is slow
and as far as I can tell, slightly depressing.
Dan is worried about his mind wasting
away, and he visits the local library to give
it exercise. He is less than sure that he will
be playing bas ball two years from now.
Neither one of us aired to surmise what,
exactly, we would be doing instead.
We walked outside together. It was a
blinding, torrid afternoon. He said he didn't
plan to walk through Commencement next
Sunday, as his team will likely be playing on
the road. I nodded. "Well," he said, extend
ing his hand, "I suppose the next time I see
you will be in September."
I shook his hand and got into my car.
"Yeah, I'll see you then," I told him. His
marriage is on September 20, in Madison,
Wis., almost four years to the day since we
first met at Stanford. It is something to
look forward to, for both of us.

touched the bill of his cap, just like he did
freshman year.

Dan, like the rest of us with one eye on
life beyond graduation, has options and
anxieties. On Sunday he stopped by my
room and thanked me for coming to his
game. As we normally do, we talked a little
about his pitching, and agreed that he had
trouble retiring hitters on two-strike
counts. Baseball life in Bakersfield is slow
and as far as I can tell, slightly depressing.
Dan is worried about his mind wasting
away, and he visits the local library to give
it exercise. He is less than sure that he will
be playing bas ball two years from now.
Neither one of us aired to surmise what,
exactly, we would be doing instead.
We walked outside together. It was a
blinding, torrid afternoon. He said he didn't
plan to walk through Commencement next
Sunday, as his team will likely be playing on
the road. I nodded. "Well," he said, extend
ing his hand, "I suppose the next time I see
you will be in September."
I shook his hand and got into my car.
"Yeah, I'll see you then," I told him. His
marriage is on September 20, in Madison,
Wis., almost four years to the day since we
first met at Stanford. It is something to
look forward to, for both of us.
