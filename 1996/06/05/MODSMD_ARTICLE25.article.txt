Memorial Church serves to
facilitate religious dialogue
Last Wednesday's editorial about the
University's hiring of three new associate
deans of religious life (note: not associate
deans of Memorial Church) requires a
response. As I read it, the editorial contains
both confusions and complaints, some of
which I can begin to address.
Confusions can be cleared up, with a lit
tle work. Some of the problems stem from
established terminology, which needs to
change in the face of new realities. Rabbi
Patricia Karlin-Neumann has accepted a
post at Stanford as one of four University
chaplains. She is a Jewish leader and edu
cator proud of and committed to her reli
gion and its observances. As an associate
dean of religious life at Stanford she will
work in the University and with its stu
dents, staff and faculty as a rabbi, spiritual
resource and counselor. To understand her
as working at and for Memorial Church is
to misunderstand. As The Daily's editorial
acknowledges, some of this confusion
about the role of Karlin-Neumann as a
chaplain is the result of the paper's own
"counterintuitive headline" about her hold
ing a position "at church." Not only is
Rabbi Karlin-Neumann's religious defini
tion clear, there is no interest on my part
in "including Jewish interests in the
church" nor of seeking to "co-opt" Jews or
Judaism on campus. As an interfaith chap
laincy team, we are eager to engage in dia
logue across religious boundaries, and to
learn from each other — and we hope

increasingly to engage people at Stanford
who share that desire.
Perhaps it will remove another confu
sion to state explicitly that those of us who
work as religious professionals in the Uni
versity embrace our own distinctive faith
traditions enthusiastically, and are not
intent upon forsaking these in search of
some generic spirituality. Stanford has
been for many years a multi-faith commu
nity, even though the prominence of
Memorial Church may have made that less
evident than it is. The chaplaincy of the
University — its deans of religious life —
now begins to reflect that rich diversity,
and to prepare itself more fully to serve the
whole community, religious and non-reli
gious. If the appointment of Rabbi Karlin-
Neumann registers with some as
"tokenism," that is a cause for concern. We
are looking forward to a collaboration that
is full and vital, not merely symbolic. Time
will tell.
The writer of the editorial is confused
by my assertion that chaplains regularly
deal with faculty, staff and students who
are not of their own religion, or of a par
ticular group within their religion. What
can I say? That this does frequently
occur is a welcome (and not disturbing)
fact of life for chaplains on this and
many other campuses.
The concern about whether Memorial
Church will continue to be a Christian
house of worship is, I think, unnecessary.
As a University chapel meant from the
school's founding to hear the viewpoints of
nuiny religions and philosophies, Memorial
Church will probably never satisfy those
who want it to be only Christian, or only

Christian in a particular way. But retain its
distinctly Christian character it will. (To
clear up another confusion surrounding
the term "non-denominational": the Stan
fords, it should be noted, meant to build a
non-denominational Christian church —
hence its clear Christian shape and sym
bols — in a University not tied to any spe
cific Christian group, Protestant or
Catholic). They were more open than many
then (and now) to other religions and their
wisdom, but Memorial Church was an
architectural statement about their com
mitments to a religion whose teaching and
vision of reality they wished to have
squarely represented in the University's
intellectual life. The religious "climate" of
the era in which they made these decisions
is past, and the ways in which religious
ideas and values find their place in Univer
sity discourse constantly change. But this
private University was not founded on
non-religious or areligious assumptions.
The editorial seems to have several com
plaints. The fact that "the University sup
ports a blatantly Christum institution in
the first place" is one. As mentioned above,
this is a matter rooted in Stanford's insti
tutional history; it is also a present reality
attractive to and enjoyed by many. The
presence of the church as a building, like
the current use of Memorial Church by
several different Christian groups who reg
ularly congregate there, is not likely to
change. A second complaint, which seems
at odds with the first, is that the hiring of a
rabbi at Stanford threatens the character
of the church, which should be upheld. I
cannot see how this might happen. Reas
surance about this should not be necessary.

but I'm happy to give it. Another complaint
is directed at chagrin caused by some of the
decisions I and the University chaplains
have made and acted upon — to the
unhappiness of some Christians who "feel
put oil'by the liberal Protestant clergy who
run Memorial Church." True, it is not easy
"pleasing the Christian population on cam
pus" — but we try to take informed actions
which, by our lights, are faithful and
responsible. Not all agree with our judg
ments. So the conversations and debates
will go on. This is not bad.
I do share The Daily's view that there
is need for a wide-ranging discussion of
religion at Stanford, and that a reassess
ment of the structure and role of reli
gious institutions inside the University
would be helpful. Our new "crew" of
chaplains will be keen to join that con
versation, as I shall.

Housing options unequal
for men and women
In the midst of the conclusion of this
year's Draw, it is especially galling that
the University continues to ignore the
discrepancy between housing options
available to Greek-affiliated men and
those available to women. Although the
University technically provides equal
numbers of spaces in all residences to
men and women in order to establish the
narrowest legal compliance with Title
IX, there are unacceptable differences in

the kind of housing men and women
have the opportunity to live in at Stan
ford. While the majority of women's
housing spaces are in traditional dormi
tories, prime real estate on the Row,
complete with coveted two-room doubles
and private cooks, is set aside for frater
nity men.
Aside from year-to-year discrepancies
inherent in the Draw, women and men
do not have equal opportunities to draw
into equal types of housing. With the
exception of one fraternity, all of the
Greek houses are owned by the Universi
ty, which has an obligation under law to
ensure that it maintains those residences
in accordance with principles of equal
opportunity for both sexes. Other than
trotting out the weak rationale of "his
torical commitment," the University has
yet to justify its preferential treatment of
male Greek organizations. It is especially
disturbing that rather than seeking to
rectify this policy, it seems that the Uni
versity is intent on perpetuating it. The
Kappa Alpha fraternity was promised its
Lomita How house back if it managed to
scrounge enough recruits this year, and
the University is also considering provid
ing the Phi Psi fraternity — which, at
last count, had barely enough people to
fill a History Corner seminar room —
with its own cushy house. It is high time
for the University to be held accountable
to its rhetoric of equality and equal
opportunity, and change a discriminatory
policy which has such a profound effect
upon the quality of undergraduate life.
