Twenty Stanford students re
cently received the James W.
Lyons Awards for Service for
1995-96.
The students were nominated
by various faculty, staff and other
students and selected by a commit
tee including a number of mem
bers of the University staff. The
recipients were presented their
awards last night at a ceremony in
the Elliott Program Center.
"These students excel inside
;uid outside of the classroom and
have a passion for helping others,"
said Dean of Students Marc Wais.
"It's people like this that leave oth
ers confident and optimistic about
what people hold for the future."
Senior Lan Thanh Phan, who is
active in a number of projects and
founded the Asian Initiative for
Youth Minority Empowerment,
said she was honored to receive the
award.
"You do not really expect acco
lades or recognition because that's
the last thing on your mind," she
said. "You do public work because
you care or because you're angry
at the 'system' and you want to do
your damnedest to change it."
Another winner, graduate stu
dent Cheryl Irvin, helps students
in a San Mateo juvenile detention
center.
"I feel that [the award] not
only recognizes my efforts to as
sist others," she said, "but it ac
knowledges that helping others is
and should be vital, rather than
'add-on' aspects of our lives."
Gloria Rodriguez, a doctoral
student in education who has
been involved in a number of ac
tivities through El Centro Chi
cano, was surprised by the award.
"To be honest," she said,
"when I saw the return address
was from the Dean (of Students')
Office, I thought it might be some
sort of form letter asking for in
formation or maybe even a Uni
versity bill. So, when I opened it
to find out that I had been select
ed for this award, I was complete
ly and very pleasantly surprised."

While most of the students
were happy about getting the
award, a number of them ex
pressed concern about the lack of
action and sei*vice on the part of
other students.
Junior Rula Razek, who co
founded Womenspeak magazine
and worked on a number of other
projects involving the Women's
Center, said students should
place more of an emphasis on ser
vice.
"I think a lot of students race
through Stanford and don't ex
plore the ways that they can give
back to the community," Razek
said. "Activism is an incredible
educational opportunity and I'd
encourage everyone to get in
volved."
Phan noted that many Stan
ford students are good at com
plaining but fail to get involved in
changing the system.
"Anything that is not pre-pro
fessional is devalued at this insti
tution," Phan said. "It's really
disheartening at times but then I
always try to remember that it
doesn't really matter what the
Stanford masses think or are pro
grammed to think. What I do, I do
with a passion."
Irvin had some advice for stu
dents looking to get more in
volved.
"Get involved but do not 'ac
cessorize' community service by
doing it because it looks good on
a resume," Irvin said, "like a cer
tain pair of earrings or shoes
would look good with an outfit.
'Accessorized' activities can al
ways be taken off and disregard
ed once they no longer fit you or
match your attitude for the
day."
The other award winners were
juniors Yul Julius Kwon and
Evan Wagner; seniors Johnathon
Briggs, Una Lee, Aaron Lehman,
Elvira Prieto, Rich Stolz,
Charisse Domingo, Jonathan
Miller, Paul Kim, Lubia Sanchez
and David Walker; coterminal
student Bliss Temple; and gradu
ate students Christopher Kitts,
Tari Vickery and Mailee Eergu
son.
