## Scientists develop diabetes treatment New technique may allow some diabetics to do without regular insulin shots 
### Libusha Kelly Editorial staff 
A new treatment developed at the Medical
Tenter may one day free juvenile-onset dia
betics from needing regular insulin shots.
The technique, which involves transplant
ing fetal pancreatic: tissue into the upper
arm, will be tested on 10 patients this sum
mer.
"If the treatment works, it will not only
spare patients from the inconvenience of in
sulin injections, but also from the harmful ef
fects of sharp ups and downs in their blood
sugar levels," Donald Dafoe, associate profes
sor of surgery and senior researcher for the
project, said in a statement.
The new technique was presented Thurs
day at the American Society of Transplant
Surgeons' annual meeting in Dallas.
Juvenile-onset diabetes patients are un
able to produce enough insulin to regulate
the levels of glucose in the bloodstream due
to damaged cells in the pancreas. Without
treatment, high sugar levels can lead to nerve
and blood vessel damage, which in turn can
lead to heart disease and strokes. Current
treatments for diabetes include pancreas
transplants or regular shots of insulin to
keep the body functional.

These treatments are effective, but not al
ways convenient and without risk to pa
tients. Organ transplants are expensive and
painful, and large shots of insulin cause blood
sugar levels to fluctuate instead of being kept
fairly steady, as they are in a healthy body.
The new method will hopefully make
treatment safer and more convenient for pa
tients, said Asst. Surgery Prof. Edward Al
frey, a colleague of Dafoe.
"Right now we have whole organ (pan
creas) transplants to replace insulin, but this
is a big operation. Basically, the idea of using
fetal tissue is that it can proliferate, unlike
the adult pancreas," Alfrey said.
Initial research was done on rats. Re
searchers found that certain growth proteins
could persuade the fetal tissue to proliferate.
"People have tried to transplant fetal pan
creas for years," Gregg Adams, a surgical res
ident and head of one of the rat studies, said
in a statement. However, initial experiments
failed because the fetal tissue could not be
made to grow.
"Fetal pancreas does not have the right
growth factors to allow it to mature. So Dr.
Dafoe and I looked at various growth factors
to see if there is something we can add to the
soup to tickle the pancreas tissue to grow,"
Adams said.

Once the fetal tissue can be induced to
grow and flourish inside the patient's body, it
should provide a long-term and self-regulat
ing source of insulin. Another huge advan
tage is the simplicity of the procedure used to
implant the tissue.
"You can put it in the arm with a little tiny
incision and use IGF (a growth factor) to
make it proliferate and if there are problems,
it is easy to access the tissue," Alfrey said. "It
could even be done in the clinic as an outpa
tient procedure."
"It's like planting a row of seed corn in the
soil," Dafoe said in a statement.
However, there are drawbacks. The 10 ini
tial patients are diabetics who have already
had kidney transplants and are taking drugs
that suppress the immune system to prevent
their bodies from attacking or rejecting the
transplanted organs. Constant use of im
munosuppressants, which can be taken oral
ly, will be necessary in patients with fetal tis
sue implants for the same reason, Alfrey said.
Although it seems promising, it is difficult
to say how long it will be before the treatment
is widely available. "What works in animals
doesn't necessarily work in humans. The ap
peal of this is that it's a minor procedure so if
it doesn't work, it's not a big deal for the pa
tient," Alfrey said.
