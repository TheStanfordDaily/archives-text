William Rivers, a popular professor at Stan
ford for more than 30 years, died May 26 at his
sister's home in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 71.
Rivers served as a U.S. Marine from 1943 to
1946. He earned his bachelor's and master's
degrees from Louisiana State University, as
well as a doctorate in political science from
American University.
He joined Stanford's Department of Com
munication in 1962, retiring in 1988. However,
he returned to teach several classes soon after,
retiring completely in 1994.
Communication Prof. Henry Breitrose once
told The Daily, "Bill Rivers is out of his mind in
the nicest sort of way. All of us who teach here
try to work as hard as every student in a class,
but Bill is the only one I know that works as
hard as all the students put together."
Despite numerous bouts with illness over

'He always had students lined
up for his classes. He also
had former students all over
the country [keep in touch
with him] because they hated
the friendship to lapse.'

the past several decades, including kidney
problems and several strokes, Rivers contin
ued teaching, said Communication Prof.
Emeritus Marion Lewenstein.
"I don't think he ever fully gave up teach
ing," Lewenstein said.
"He always had students lined up for his

clashes. He also had former students all over
the country I keep in touch with himl because
they hated the friendship to lapse."
Lewenstein said Rivers went beyond teach
ing his students in his heyday. He was known
for playing poker with his graduate students
and had weekly volleyball games with his stu
dents as well.
"There was something very special about
his teaching methods and him as a person," she
said.
Over his career, Rivers wrote 29 books and
won numerous awards for his teaching and re
search. According to his sister, he continued
writing until about a month before his death.
Rivers is survived by his mother, Minnie
Rivers; a sister, Margaret Sharp; a brother,
Luke; two daughters and four grandchildren.
His wife, Sarah, died in 1983.
Arrangements for an on-campus memorial
service to be held during the summer are pend
ing.
