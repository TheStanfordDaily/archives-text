# Yield rate increases by 6 percent
## New early decision program contributed to jump, Montoya says 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
The new early decision program and in
creased involvement of faculty and alumni in
the admissions process have all contributed to
this year's increase in yield rate, according to
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions show that
and Financial Aid James Montoya.
Preliminary figures released by the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions show that the yield
rate, or percentage of accepted freshmen that
choose to enroll, has risen by almost 6 percent
from 55.1 t061.4 percent. A combination of fac-

tors, including a new technolo
gy system in the Financial Aids
Office and a strong Admit
Weekend, account for this in
crease.
"We had a particularly suc
cessful Admit Weekend. The
weather cooperated when we
could have had a rainy week
end," said Montoya.
To date, 1,601 freshmen

have enrolled. Despite the rise in freshman ap
plicants by 1,000, 300 fewer students were ad
mitted this year. Thirty-five percent were ad

mitted through the early decision program.
"This sent out an important message to the
students that did not apply through the early de
cision program. They would have not been to
tally disadvantaged by not applying early," said
Montoya. "There is more than one road to gain
ing admission to Stanford."
This was the first year Stanford allowed ap
plicants the option of early decision. Montoya
said the implementation of the new program
was particularly successful.
"I think it went over very well," said Mon-

toya. "ror the staff reading the
early decision file, it was particu
larly exciting and enjoyable know
ing that these students would defi
nitely enroll at the institution."
The gender ratio in the Class of
2000 is slightly unbalanced in favor
of men. The entering class is com
posed of 50.3 percent males and
49.7 percent females, as compared
to 53.6 percent women and 46.4
percent men in the Class of 1999.
The ethnic demographics have
not changed significantly. The
African-American segment of the
entering class remains at approxi
mately 8 percent. The Mexican-
American population dropped 3
percent to 9 percent, and Native
Americans make up almost 1 per
cent of the Class of 2000. The
Asian-American population seg
ment increased to 23 percent. In
ternational students comprise 5

percent of the class, and whites ac
count for the remaining 54 percent
of the entering class.

At the end of the
second year, we
are already
at 43.5 percent.'

The percentage of President's
Scholars that have chosen to at
tend has increased. Eighty-seven of
the 200 admits offered the scholar
ship have opted to attend Stanford
this year. This number represents
eight more than the number in the
Class of 1999. The President's
Scholars program was initiated
three years ago with the hope that
its yield rate would be around 40
percent at the end of its third year.
"At the end of the second .year,
wo are already at 43.5 percent,"

said Montoya.
year, the program yielded
38.5 percent, and it yielded 29.5 per
cent the year before that. I ,ast year's
significant increase has Ixxni attrib
uted to changes made in the finan
cial aid aspect of the scholarship.
Forty-nine states and 35 foreign
countries are represented in the
Class of 2000. None of the incom
ing freshmen are from Delaware.
Thirty of 600 applicants on the
waiting list have been offered ad
mission. They had until last
Wednesday to respond to Stan
ford's offer.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admissions anticipates that 150
transfer students will enroll fall
quarter. Twenty percent currently
attend community colleges. The
transfer students come from 35
states and 11 foreign countries.
The Class of 2000 is "an excep
tionally talented group of students.
I am particularly pleased at the in
crease in yield rate with the stu
dents with the strongest academic
credentials," said Montoya.
