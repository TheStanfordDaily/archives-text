The new early decision program and in
creased involvement of faculty and alumni in
the admissions process have all contributed to
this year's increase in yield rate, according to
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions show that
and Financial Aid James Montoya.
Preliminary figures released by the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions show that the yield
rate, or percentage of accepted freshmen that
choose to enroll, has risen by almost 6 percent
from 55.1 t061.4 percent. A combination of fac-

tors, including a new technolo
gy system in the Financial Aids
Office and a strong Admit
Weekend, account for this in
crease.
"We had a particularly suc
cessful Admit Weekend. The
weather cooperated when we
could have had a rainy week
end," said Montoya.
To date, 1,601 freshmen

have enrolled. Despite the rise in freshman ap
plicants by 1,000, 300 fewer students were ad
mitted this year. Thirty-five percent were ad

mitted through the early decision program.
"This sent out an important message to the
students that did not apply through the early de
cision program. They would have not been to
tally disadvantaged by not applying early," said
Montoya. "There is more than one road to gain
ing admission to Stanford."
This was the first year Stanford allowed ap
plicants the option of early decision. Montoya
said the implementation of the new program
was particularly successful.
"I think it went over very well," said Mon-
