# What's your zine?
## Students create alternative mags 
### Heather Knight Staff writer 
Chad Bennett uniquely solved
the daunting task of keeping in
touch with all his family and friends
from high school when he jirrived at
Stanford.
A sophomore transfer from
lowa, Bennett created a zine — a
small magazine made with just a
computer, Xerox machine and sta
pler — all about himself, called
"Poser."
"I was sick (if trying to write let
ters to all my family. It started as a
really self-indulgent type of thing,"
he said.
His circulation has grown since
then, reaching family, friends
around the country, their friends
and Bennett's friends at Stanford.
So, perhaps Bennett understotes
its success. "Yeah, it's been well re
ceived," he said.
One may question how story ti
tles like "A Day in the Life of Chad's
Bootie" and "Interview with a Mor
mon" — one of Bennett's several in
terviews with Stanford friends — go
over with mom and dad.
"At first I censored myself, and
now I have a hard time doing it. My
great-grandmother, who's 80,
writes 'When's the next issue of
Poser coming out?' " Bennett said.
Bennett, who is working on his
eighth issue of the zine, said he usu
ally gets inspired to create each
issue in one sitting.
"I do it all in one night. 1 make it
and then run to Kinkos," he said.
Whether Poser will circulate to
higher numbers of Stanford stu
dents is unclear. Bennett said he is
not sure that students have inter
ests in line with reading zines.
"A lot of people at Stanford are
very sort of science-v, and a lot of

people aren't into pop culture," he
said.
Coming from lowa with the
"cows and stuff," Bennett said he
thought, "I'm coming to California,
and it's going to be very strange."
I le expected a more liberal, alterna
tive atmosphere, but said he has
found Stanford to be fairly "conser
vative."
Though zines are generally
thought to be cool, anti-mainstream
publications, Bennett said this re
bellion was not part of his creating
Poser.
"I'm not one of those people who
do a zine to be underground. I sub
scribe to Spin, which is about as
cheesy as you can get," he said.
A self-confessed reader of People
magazine, Bennett, who is majoring
in English, said he hopes to write
professionally for a magazine some
day.
Another zine is in the works at
Stanford. Freshman Ajna Rivera,
who started her first zine "Wonder

pup" with her sister in high school,
is now making a yet-to-be-titled zine
with Stanford friends.
Unlike Bennett, Rivera created
her zines to make fun of main
stream magazines.
"We like to go through maga
zines and say how to make them bet
ter. It's totally just for fun — totally
ridiculous. It gets out my criticism
on the world, but it's mostly just
comedy," she said.
The new zine, which should be
ready for publication soon, is based
on Rivera's new band, "Full Moon
Manhood." The band has no real in
struments, and the zine uses a sar
castic tone to make fun of it.
"The magazine makes a lot of
jokes about [the band). The maga
zine explains what it's like to be a
band that doesn't play anywhere,"
she said.
Coming up with the stories for
the zine is the hardest part of pro
duction, Rivera said. Another
problem is inspiration at inoppor

tune times.
"The only time you want to do it
is during finals," she said.
Sometimes, this inspiration can
lead to strange creations.
"My favorite aspect is writing
things and reading them a week
later and saying, 'Oh, my God! I
wrote that?' " she said.
Rivera's first zine, Wonderpup,
has reached underground success in
her hometown of San Diego, but she
said not many Stanford students
know about it. Rivera agreed with
Bennett that Stanford students are
generally not interested in zines.
"They're not mainstream
enough for Stanford students and
usually they're expensive. Stanford
students probably mostly read
Rolling Stone, GQ, whatever," she
said.
Copies of Rivera's new zine can
be obtained by e-mailing ajna(c le
land, and copies of Bennett's zines
can be obtained by e-mailing mon-
