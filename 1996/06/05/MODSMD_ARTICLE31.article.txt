# A 						competitive edge
## New statistics show University offers one of highest faculty benefits package 
### David Stein Contributing write 
Stanford offers more competi
tive benefits packages to its full
time faculty members than most
private U.S. independent univer
sities, according to recently re
leased statistics.
Although the University does
not calculate total costs of its
packages because they are related
to varying faculty salaries, Stan
ford easily tops the national aver
age of $14,595, said Jim Franklin,
associate vice president for total
compensation. According to
Franklin's estimates, Stanford's
figure is more than $20,000.
Franklin stressed that this fig
ure, compiled by the American As
sociation of University Profes
sors, relates to all private univer
sities, including small schools not
comparable with Stanford. Never
theless, Franklin added, Stan
ford's packages are highly compet
itive with similar research institu
tions such as Harvard, Yale and
Johns I lopkins Universities.
In addition, Franklin said such
figures must be scrutinized care
fully because it is unlikely that
any two faculty members would
receive the same benefits package.
Benefits are calculated at 29.7
percent of the faculty member's
salary, Franklin said.
"If you were to take an assis
tant professor in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences and a full
professor in the Law School or
[ Medical 1 School with a much
higher salary, the two are not
going to have similar benefits,"
Franklin said.
Benefits packages are also de
termined by personal circum
stances, Franklin said. The num
ber of family members and chil
dren in college, along with partic
ular medical or dental plans, can
help set the amount each faculty
member will receive, Franklin
added.
Jennifer Summit, an assistant
professor of English who is com
pleting her first year at Stanford,
said her decision to come to the
University was not heavily deter
mined by the benefits package,
but mentioned that some of her

colleagues found that the incen
tives "usually make a difference."
However, Summit said certain
portions of the package, including
a housing benefit which helps fac
ulty members with mortgages, did
make the University's offer more
attractive.
According to the association,
the national aggregate figure of
$14,595 spent on benefits pack
ages can be split into separate cat
egories such as retirement, med
ical and dental insurance, tuition
grants and various workers' com
pensations. Stanford's figures are
larger than the national averages
in each of these cases.
Tuition grants — money set
aside for faculty members' chil
dren's education — is one area in
which Stanford does overwhelm
ingly better than national figures,
Franklin said. The national aver
age is $1,019, compared to Stan
ford's benefit of half of its current
tuition, nearly $10,000.
"From what I've seen in all the
Ivy League schools, we do much
better in tuition for children than
any of them," Franklin said.
However, this benefit may not
last long, as recent federal govern
ment policy changes could affect
the funds faculty children receive
for higher education, Franklin
said. The University administra
tion is currently examining ways
to mitigate this potential loss of
funds.
Franklin added that retire
ment costs, one of the largest por
tions of faculty benefits, currently
set at 10 percent of salary dollars,
should remain steady until 1997
when faculty contributions to this
fund will decrease.
Ernst Benjamin, director of re
search at the association, said he
does not foresee any significant
trends for faculty benefits in the
near future. He mentioned that
the costs of medical and dental in
surance may continue to rise, but
all other areas should remain sta
ble.
The association is a national
faculty organization concerned
with tenure issues and collective
bargaining. It publishes national
salary and benefit figures each
year in its journal, Academe.
