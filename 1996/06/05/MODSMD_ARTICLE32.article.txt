# 'A Renaissance man if there ever was one'
## Gibbons ends 12-year stint at Engineering School 
### Hugh Handeyside 
He has been called "imaginative
and entrepreneurial" by Graduate
School of Business Dean A.
Michael Spence, "a Renaissance
man if there ever was one" by re
tired head of Freshman English
Nancy Packer and "a phenomenal
dean and a special guy" by Ronald
Hanson, chair of the Mechanical
Engineering Department.
Clearly, the Stanford communi
ty will notice the absence of Dean of
the School of Engineering James
Gibbons.
As he prepares to retire from his
dean's post this month, there is lit
tle question that Gibbons' record is
tremendous. During his 12-year
tenure, the School of Engineering
has consistently gained repute, cul
minating in the National Research
Council's positive evaluation of
doctoral programs last September.
The Electrical Engineering,
Computer Science and Mechanical

Engineering Departments were all
ranked first nationwide, and seven
other departments in the Engi
neering School placed among the
top 10. The council's findings were
seconded by U.S. News & World
Report, which ranked the under
graduate engineering program as
the nation's best.
"The School of Engineering has
been in a mode of continuous im
provement since Fred Terman,"
remarked Gibbons, referring to the
electrical engineering professor,
dean and provost who was a men
tor to David Packard and William
Hewlett, founders of Hewlett-
Packard Co.
Gibbons has been on the Stan
ford faculty for 39 years. After his
retirement, he will move on to a
new posit ion as council to Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper for
industrial relations.
Gibbons said he didn't expect
Stanford to be competitive with
schools like MIT, whose focus is en

gineering, when he first took the
job as dean. "I wanted us to be the
best School of Engineering we
could be within the Stanford envi
ronment."
Gibbons' first priority as the
new dean in 1984 was to begin a
process of grassroots planning
which originated with the school's
faculty members. By assuming that
departments and faculty under
stood their own needs better than
he could, Gibbons worked exten
sively with the department chairs
to create specific goals for the fu
ture of the School of Engineering in
a process he termed "faculty-based
academic planning."
Hanson compared the ap
proach, which he called balanced
planning, to a team mentality that
can be rare among administrators.
"He wants the players to do some
planning, so they'll be behind
[him], but he still plays the team
captain," he said.
The approach has been highly

successful. With the faculty sup
porting the plans they helped to
formulate, Gibbons had little trou
ble in making improvements he felt
were necessary in the school. In
thinking about his most important
changes, he said bringing the Com
puter Science Department into the
School of Engineering and broad
ening its programs to include un
dergraduates made "an absolutely
major intellectual difference in the
school."
While the creation of 26 new en
dowed chairs for rewarding faculty
and raising funds for new buildings
were also important achievements
to Gibbons, he stressed that the
real insight into the needs of the
school comes from its teachers and
researchers.
"You have to represent the
faculty in a way that focuses at
tention on them, not you," he
said, adding that having been a
professor before becoming dean
was one of his greatest assets as

an administrator.
Gibbons said he believes in edu
cating students to become more
well-rounded people as well as ex
perts in their field. "He doesn't
have a narrow engineering-centric
view of how our students should be
educated," said Joseph Goodman,
chair of the Electrical Engineering
Department.
In trying to expose students in
the Engineering School to a wide
range of ideas, Gibbons relaxed the
unit requirements of the school to
allow students to pursue more per
sonal educational goals. He also es
tablished funding for music
lessons, studio art and writing in
science fiction for interested engi
neering students.
"I've always wanted to find a
way to help students develop
themselves as far as they can,"
Gibbons said. According to Han
son, this kind of development
breeds leadership in the workplace
and makes students more team

and project-oriented.
Gibbons takes his own advice:
He is an avid trombone player, he
has a knack for memorizing poetry
and he loves Shakespeare. One of
his favorite passages, he said, is
Brutus' lines from Julius Caesar.
He recited, "There is a tide in the
affairs of men, that taken in its
flood, leads on to fortune." Gib
bons, it seems, has already found
his fortune.
