# Students stage protest at post office
## 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
A small group of students Friday collected
complaints against the Stanford post office
during a protest in White Plaza.
Senior Relief Jones said the protest was
"about the poor service here at the post office,"
specifically late mail, damaged packages and
unfriendly service.
Carrying picket signs that read, "Where's
service with a smile?" and "We want our mail
now — not next year," Jones and sophomore
Danny Bramzon had passersby fill out official
complaint forms against the post office. By the
end of the lunch hour Friday they had used up
all 25 forms the post office gave them. Post of
fice officials said no more forms were avail
able.
Although only five people were involved in
organizing the protest, "we were spurred on by
many," Jones said.
But just as many people offered encourage
ment to post office workers as those who sup
ported the protest, said Acting Stanford Post

Office Station Manager Bill Owens.
"I've had a number of regular customers
who came in who are very upset," Owens said.
One professor offered to write a letter in sup
port of the post office and several other people
"are very angry about this," he said.
Jones said he hoped to see service improved
over his most recent experiences.
After receiving a compact disc he didn't
want in the mail from a mail-order music club,
Jones attempted to return the unopened pack
age without additional postage, he said. Postal
workers returned the package to his mailbox
several times, demanding more money before
it could be returned.
Eventually, Jones said, he picked up the
package and it had been opened — making it
necessary to add postage for the return.
"It's obvious someone there opened it and
wanted me to pay for return postage," Jones
said.
But Owens claimed Jones had opened the
package and then tried to have it returned for
free. "If you want to return it, you have to pay
for it,"he said.

The protest simply showed that Jones and
other students do not understand the work
ings or regulations of the post office, Owens
said.
"I think they're a bunch of kids who don't
know what's going on," he said.
Students involved, however, said they saw
outright protest as the only hope for improved
service.
"We don't see anything changing," Bram
zon said. Because of long-term problems, he
said, students launched the "spontaneous
grassroots" picket.
Jones said he sees the protest as just a first
step to turning around the Stanford post of
fice's negative image.
"Hopefully their supervisors will re-evalu
ate the system here and try to improve upon
it,"he said. "We just think this is a good first
step."
Any change will be welcome, he added.
"This problem has been going on for a long
time," Jones said. "Students have been very
unhappy with the service and it's time we made
our voices heard."
