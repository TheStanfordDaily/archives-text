The man police accused of being the Penin
sula serial rapist in January, Romel Reid, pled
not guilty to 23 indictments at his arraignment
Friday.
Stephen Elrick, Reid's lawyer, asked to post
pone the arraignment to a later date, saying he
was surprised at the speed of the grand jury in
dictments, which were issued Thursday. How
ever, Santa Clara Superior Court Judge Jack
Komar would not grant Elrick's request.
"I am not comfortable with the court dates,"

Elrick said. "1 have tc> have time to study the in
dictments, to go back and study the police re
ports and interview the victims."
Elrick said although he was not surprised
the grand jury returned the multiple indict
ments — 10 for sexual assault, eight for robbery
and three for assault with a deadly weapon —
he w;is upset that the jury announced the in
dictments without giving him a list of the vic
tims' names or addresses.
"A list of the victims should at least have
been made available to me," Elrick said. "I have
spent the last four months trying to get their
names and phone numbers — I need to inter

view them."
Each of the victims testified before the grand
jury-
Reid was arrested Jan. 15 in Sunnyvale after
a high-speed car chase through Menlo Park and
East Palo Alto. The 26-year-old East Palo Alto
resident pleaded not guilty in Eebruary to all
charges, and his bail was set at $10 million.
Police were led to Reid when one officer saw
a man who looked like the suspect in a white
van similar to the one described by the victims.
Police had been searching for .a serial rapist
since August, when the rapes which police be
lieved were connected becan.
