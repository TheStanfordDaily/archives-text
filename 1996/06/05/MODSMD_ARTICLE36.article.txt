### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
The Stanford cycling team re
turned from San Luis Obispo on
Sunday far ahead of the pack, rid
ing away with its second national
championship in two years.
Participating in the National
Collegiate Cycling Association's
1996 Road National Champi
onships, the team racked up 503
points, well ahead of second
place Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo,
which finished with 384 points
and third-place University of
Arizona, which counted 372
points.
Stanford's men's and women's
teams finished first overall out of
31 qualifying teams and individual
qualifiers from 35 additional
schools, said Stanford coach Art
Walker.
A club sport, the cycling team
has had about 40 members partic
ipate in one or more races this
year, Walker said. Four men and
four women qualified to partici
pate in the nationals after the
West Coast Conference Champi
onships in early May.
The national championships
consist of three events: a team
time trial, a road race and the cri
terium, a timed event of laps.
In the team time trial, the Stan
ford women, who have won three
consecutive national champi
onships in the past three years,
slipped into second place this year.
The University of Colorado
won, finishing the 12-mile race in
30:04, while Stanford crossed the
finish line in 30:39.
The Stanford men's team came
in fifth, after two years in second
place. The University of Arizona
won the event in just over 26 min
utes, and Stanford came in in just
under 27 minutes.
Walker attributed the slip in

the men's teams standings to ill
ness. Three members of the Stan
ford team were sick at the begin
ning of the weekend, joined by
their fourth colleague by the end of
the competition.
"Our team really considered it
self and was considered to be a fa
vorite," Walker said. "But three of
our guys picked this week to be
sick. I think in light of the situa
tion, we did well."
Still, both Stanford teams were
somewhat unhappy with the re
sults.
"They were disappointed,"
Walker said. "The women were
disappointed, too, but the Col
orado team really had a good ride."
Stanford senior Tracy Timms
finished second in the women's
road race, a 61-mile course. In
1992, Timms claimed the national
championship in the same race.
She followed Northwestern's
Christina deKraay, the overall
women's winner, to the finish
line.
Also in the women's road race,
graduate student Megan Troxell
placed sixth and medical student
Cathy Norbutas placed 15th.
In the men's race, senior An
drew Lewis placed highest for
Stanford, coming in seventh after
breaking away from the group in
an attempt to finish first in the 92-
mile race.
In the third and final lap of the
race, Lewis rode away from a 25-
man group, Walker said. He was
alone for 20 miles before the six
top finishes caught up.
"He made his move, and it
didn't pay off," Walker said. "It
was a really gutsy move. He won a
lot of fans, even among the offi
cials following the race."
Graduate student Peter Ar
initage finished the race in ninth
place, while graduate student
David Bailey came in 44th. Bailey

was sick and also got caught be
hind a huge crash, Walker said.
The criterium is a timed race,
lasting 90 minutes for men and 60
minutes for women. With a few
laps left around a short loop, offi
cials count the laps completed to
name the winner, Walker said.
In the women's criterium,
Timms placed third and Troxell
placed fifth. Norbutas came in
22nd, and senior Kelley Herndon
came in 27th.
Armitage placed 16th for the
Stanford men.
Omnium awards were given for
overall excellence. Timms won sec
ond place in the women's omnium,
and Troxell won fifth place. Ar
mitage placed eighth in the men's
criterium. The top five omnium
finishers are given All-American
distinction, Walker said.
Along with illness, heat also hit
the Stanford team hard. Weather
was in the high 80s all weekend,
Walker said.
Troxell said, "The weather
probably played a bigger factor
than in the past two years in terms
of how hard the races are."
The courses also included a
number of difficult hills and turns,
Walker said.
Both Armitage and Lewis were
among an "elite group of amateur
riders eligible to participate in the
Olympic trials," Walker said. In
stead of riding in the third week
end of those trials, the cyclists re
turned to California for the na
tional championships.
Another member of the Stan
ford team, graduate student Joan
Wilson, completed all of the
Olympic trials, finishing 12th on
the final day of the races in North
Carolina. Stanford alumna Nicole
Freedman placed fourth in the last
race of the trials and 10th overall.
The top five finishers are named to
the Olympic team.
