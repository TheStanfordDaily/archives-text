Dish stolen from Kappa Sigma
An unidentified suspect stole an 18-inch, digital
RCA satellite dish and accompanying receiver
from 535 Campus Drive, the Kappa Sigma frater
nity house, on May 29.
"Someone got on the roof and took the satellite
and then the receiver from the front room," said
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The time of theft is estimated to be between 4:30
a.m. and 5:30 a.m. There are no known suspects at
this time.
"However, if someone wants to do the civic duty
and give us some information we are always recep
tive," Niemeyer said.
Fighting occurs at baseball game
Five spectators were ejected from Sunken Dia
mond for fighting at the Stanford baseball game
against Cal State-Northridge on May 25.
Three were Stanford students, and the other
two were from Northridge, said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.

"Obviously, both sides had been consuming al
cohol," he said. Apparently, the groups had been
taunting each other throughout the game, which
eventually erupted into pushing and shoving, said
Niemeyer.
Stanford athletic security then broke up the
fight and called in the Stanford Police to eject them
from the stadium.
