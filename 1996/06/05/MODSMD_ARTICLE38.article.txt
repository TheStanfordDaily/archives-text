## 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Roy
Gutman spoke Monday night about his dis
covery of war crimes in Bosnia and the lack
of knowledge of these crimes in the United
States and other Western governments.
Gutman gave his presentation, titled
"War Crimes in Bosnia and U.S. Intelli
gence Policy: How much did the U.S.
know?" to a nearly full Kresge Auditorium
audience. The speech was sponsored by
Stanford Students Against Genocide
(SAGE), the Center for International Se
curity and Arms Control and the ASSU
Program Board.
Gutman was awarded the Pulitzer
Prize in 1993, when his reporting exposed
the existence of Serbian-run concentration
camps in Bosnia. Gutman's prize-winning

dispatches were printed in his 1993 book,
"A Witness to Genocide."
In his speech, Gutman focused on the
destruction of the Bosnian enclave of Sre
brenica. Srebrenica was captured by the
Bosnian Serbs between July 5 and 6, 1995.
Gutman returned to Bosnia in 1995 to in
vestigate alleged Serbian war crimes in
Srebrenica. In Srebrenica, Gutman discov
ered mass graves and was given informa
tion on war crimes by the Bosnian govern
ment.
Gutman said his investigation of these
war crimes led him to wonder how much
the United States had known about the
crimes and why the events at Srebrenica
had not been averted.
"What did we know, the United States
and the Western countries, about the
slaughter? This was the center of Europe.
This is the last years of the 20th century.

This is the end of the war, as it turned out
to be, the last months of the Bosnian war,"
Gutman said.
Gutman said he had assumed that the
United States had known about the events
in Srebrenica.
"The United States is the only remain
ing superpower ... we have one of the
world's most expensive and extensive in
telligence-gathering networks," Gutman
said.
However, when Gutman spoke with of
ficials in the United States government,
they did not acknowledge that they had
known about Srebrenica. Gutman spoke
on the dangers of this lack of knowledge in
regard to policy-making on Bosnia.
"If this is the quality of American infor
mation and American intelligence gather
ing then I think it says something very se
rious about American policy-making. That

is that American policy-makers seem to be
and certainly seem to have been in the case
of Srebrenica, in the dark much of the time.
They had to have been making decisions
and judgments based on a lack of informa
tion, rather than on relevant information."
When asked if the United States had
known of the capture of Srebrenica and
had let Serbians capture the enclave, Gut
man said he has been unable to prove that
this was a conscious decision on the part of
the United States.
"That is the way it looks, but no one can
prove it. Not yet," Gutman said.
Gutman also said the press has not fully
reported on the events which have oc
curred in Bosnia.
"As much as we in the press have re
ported, as much as we have uncovered, we
have really only scratched the surface of
the events. We only know a tiny fraction of

what we should know," Gutman said.
Following Gutman's speech, Fehim Fa
zlic, a survivor of the Manjaca concentra
tion camp, gave a short speech thanking
Gutman on behalf of the survivors, their
families and the Bosnian refugee commu
nity in the Bay Area.
"It gives me great honor to thank our
savior (Gutman], the man who, led by hu
manity and the ethics of a professional
journalist, came to the truth and told the
world about our fate. IGutman] was a true
savior for hundreds of us in Manjaca and
thousands of others in concentration
camps throughout Bosnia," Fazlic said.
The survivors presented Gutman with
two plaques, one of which read "End Con
centration Camps and Genocide." They
also thanked SAGE for its support on be
half of the Bosnian refugee community in
the Bay Area.
