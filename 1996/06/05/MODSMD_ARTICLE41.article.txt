# My summer vacation
## 
### 
I actually went to a summer day camp called
Happyland when I was 5 years old. I don't
remember much about it, but it did have one
of those big blue, above-ground pools and a few
of those giant wooden "shelters" with rows of
picnic benches and unused fireplaces at each
end. I was only 5 years old, but I remember hat
ing that smiley, happy place with as much pas
sion a guy who still ties his shoelaces in the dou
ble-loop, "bunny-style" could muster.
The summer that I was 8 years old, my par
ents sent me away for six weeks to Lakeland, the
overnight camp. I was the youngest kid in the
whole place and the water we had to swim in
was disgusting. Mind you, they didn't have a big
blue pool, they just had that grotesque, murky
lake (hence the name "Lakeland," which must
have been short for "Grotesque Murkv Lake
land").
Then I went to camp in Canada for a few
years — Camp Wahanowin (all those camps had
Native American — er, Native Canadian
names). The only thing I remember from those
places is the ability to carry canoes over my
head, how to properly line up at a flagpole and
the realization that every camp uses the exact
same songs by just changing around the lyrics,
And, somewhere around there 1 learned how to
tie my shoelaces with the single-loop method.
Well, 1 don't go to summer camp anymore. I
don't canoe much anymore. And I normally just
slip my shoes on without even undoing the laces.
Things are different now. Summers don't mean
summer camp and swimming and Little League
and lemonade anymore. Nowadays, summer

"vacation" means phone calls and photocopying
and working for peanuts. I suppose 1 still could
drink lots of lemonade, but it's just not as much
fun, and if 1 spilled I'd probably get myself into
a lot of trouble.
So whatever happened to the lazy days of
summer? Lawn chairs and poolsides and bug
bites are being pushed to the side to allow for
office chairs, cubicles and power suits. This sum
mer, most of us will slip on our loafers or flats
and head for an office where we are under
appreciated and underpaid. Why do we do this?
Why do we these things? If it isn't purely for the
money, I can only think of one very good reason:
to fill those horrible blank spots on our resumes.
"Experience begets experience," the song goes.
So instead of packing our bags for the beach,
we're off packing our resumes.
Hut let's be honest, how much does "legal
assistant" really mean on a resume? What does
experience as an "administrative assistant"
really do for you? If it were really for your
resume, you could fill that space with enough
active verbs to make it sound like you spent your
summer launching the space shuttle no matter
what the heck you were doing. So why all this
pressure on that resume.
Here's my theory: If you spent this summer
working on a project that you were dedicated to,
it would look better on a resume than virtually
anything else. If I were hiring Stanford kids, I'd
rather hire one who had a passion for a project
of sorts that she believed strongly in, rather
than someone who answered phones every sum
mer.

That's my hypothesis — take it or leave it.
I'm not saying that summer job.- art' not
worthwhile experiences. I guess I'm trying to
say is that if we don't stop and smell the lemon
ade. we might wake up one morning to find out
that someone else drank it while we were inside
ironing our khaki pants.
For me, this is my last summer "vacation"
ever. Some of you out there, you've already used
up your quota. Now none of us are about to run
ofT to Happyland or Camp Wahanowin for a
swim in the lake or a quick Color War. Howev
er, I hope that some of us can take a look back
from what is so pressing in our lives and really
ask ourselves if we need a little "vacation" from
the hustle and bustle. If we need one, let's take
it.
Forget the resume. Run off to the beach.
Sleep under the stars. Get some bug bites.
And let's all just remember that underneath
the pinstripes is someone who used to marvel at
the fact that people could tie shoes with just one
loop.

Hey kuls! That 's the last Diversions of the year!
So what now? Why don t you tell us — if you re
interested in bringing Diversions to life next fall,
call 5-2100 and ash for Beth!
