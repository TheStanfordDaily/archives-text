## Track team puts on solid performance in NCAA spotlight 
### Sam Wang Staff writer 
Stanford's program is not
recognized as a national power
house in track and field. But be
ginning with the hiring of Vin
Lananna as head coach four
years ago, the team has slowly
been accumulating talent in an
attempt to bring Stanford track
back to respectability. The fruits
of success are already being
borne, as evidenced by the solid
finishes of both the men's and
women's teams at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships last
month.
Last week, the Cardinal sent
nine representatives to show
case its program on a national
stage at the four-day NCAA
Championships in Eugene, Ore.
The nine Stanford athletes
put on solid performances, earn
ing seven Ail-American honors
among them.
One of the most dazzling Car
dinal performances came from
junior Monal Chokshi in the
3,000 meters, who saved the
best performance of her career
for the spotlight of the national
championships.
Coming into NCAAs, Chok
shi's personal best in the 3,000
was 9:27.86, a time she achieved
in late March in a four-way meet
against Air Force, UC-Irvine
and Wisconsin.
On the first night of qualify
ing heats, Chokshi blasted her
old record by almost 10 seconds
when she blazed to a time of
9:18.14, which put her comfort
ably in the final.
Chokshi then proved her
qualifying time was no fluke
when she came back two days
later in the final to run an al
most identical time of 9:18.95 to
finish in fourth place. Kathy
Butler of Wisconsin captured
the event with the time of
9:16.19.
Cardinal freshman Mary
Cobb also participated in the
final of the 3,000 after barely

sneaking in with the 12th and
final qualifying spot. But Cobb
just could not find the spark
which had led her to an out
standing freshman campaign
this year. She finished in 12th
place with a time 0f9:33.32.
"It was kind of disappoint
ing," she said. "At the beginning
of the season, when I looked to
the NCAAs, I felt I could have
done better than 12th. It was
just a bad day and it wasn't
there.
"But at the same time, I think
I learned a lot from this. I want
ed to make the NCAAs and be
All-American [both of which she
accomplished], so in no way do I
feel that I didn't accomplish any
thing this year."
All-American honors also
went to senior Dena Dey in the
1,500 and sophomore Sarna
Renfro in the 5,000.
Dey, who finished in second
place at Pac-lOs in the same
event and ran the second-fastest
time in nation this year
(4:16.30), finished seventh at
4:21.44. Meisha Marzell of
Georgetown sped to first place
with a time of 4:17.92.
Renfro ran 16:22.34 to cap
ture fifth place in the 5,000, al
most 17 seconds behind winner
Jennifer Rhines of Villanova.
Competing on Friday was
Stanford's two-man hammer
throwing crew of junior Justin
Strand and sophomore Adam
Connolly.
Strand and Connolly finished
12th and 15th, respectively,
with Strand's best effort travel
ing 210 feet-1 inch and Connol
ly's 204-6. Balazs Kiss of USC
dominated the field by unleash
ing the longest throw in the
world this year at 265-3, almost
forty feet further than his clos
est competitor. Kiss' first-place
finish represented his fourth
consecutive national champi
onship in the hammer.
