# Woods survives fourth-round scare
## Sophomore takes home NCAA individual title; team finishes in fourth 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
After a season spent being trashed by the cynics, a
gutsy Stanford men's golf team had the final word
last week, taking fourth place at the NCAA champi
onships in Chattanooga, Tenn.
Vastly underestimated throughout the season,
the 15th-ranked Cardinal charged out to the top of
the leader board and refused to go away, hanging on
to finish in fourth place with a four-round score of
1205. No. 2 Arizona State edged out No. 3 Nevada-
Las Vegas to claim the national title.
"To put it bluntly, we feel great," said senior cap
tain Jerry Chang. "No one outside of this team would
have dreamed that we would finish where we did.
They didn't give us much respect, didn't think we
were a quality team, and it feels really good to have
proved them wrong.
"We would have loved to win, but we're very
happy. This whole season, we've worked so hard and
it really paid off in the end."
Seeded a lowly 20th despite winning the West Re
gionals, Stanford looked tc repeat the success of last
year's Cardinal team — which finished as the NCAA
runner-up — and regain the respect which had been
begrudged it all season long.
In what has become a familiar scenario, the squad
reached the road to redemption primarily behind the
stellar play of Ail-American Tiger Woods, who added
the NCAA individual crown to his Pac-10 and West
Region titles. Woods won despite shooting an un
characteristic 80 in a rough final round and seeing
his nine-stroke lead whittled down to four.
"I'm really exhausted," said Woods. "I really had
to reach deep down to make it through the last day.
"I played the other rounds in preparation for the
last one."
For the first three days, Woods played on a com
pletely separate level from the rest of the field, re
ducing the terrors of the intimidating Honors
Course to mere inconveniences as he finished with a
pair of 69s and a course-record 67. The course exact
ed its revenge on Woods in the final round, however,
as it stung him for a triple-bogey on No. 9 and bogeys
on four of the next six holes.
"He was just so amazing those first three days,"
said head coach Wally Goodwin, "but you can only
maintain that level of play so long and the course
humbled him on the last day.
"The way he was able to keep it together after that
rough patch was a real testament to his maturity. To
survive in the face of that kind of difficulty, that's
the sign of a true champion."
As Woods suffered a rare lapse in his normally
dominant game, however, Chang brought his game
up a level, firing the low round of the day in a bril-

Tiger Woods shot an 80 on Saturday in the final round of the NCAA Championships, but his
four-round total was still good enough to outpace his closest competitor by four strokes.
