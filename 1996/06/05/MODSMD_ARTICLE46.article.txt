# Woods survives fourth-round scare
## Sophomore takes home NCAA individual title; team finishes in fourth 
### Brian Lee Staff writer 
After a season spent being trashed by the cynics, a
gutsy Stanford men's golf team had the final word
last week, taking fourth place at the NCAA champi
onships in Chattanooga, Tenn.
Vastly underestimated throughout the season,
the 15th-ranked Cardinal charged out to the top of
the leader board and refused to go away, hanging on
to finish in fourth place with a four-round score of
1205. No. 2 Arizona State edged out No. 3 Nevada-
Las Vegas to claim the national title.
"To put it bluntly, we feel great," said senior cap
tain Jerry Chang. "No one outside of this team would
have dreamed that we would finish where we did.
They didn't give us much respect, didn't think we
were a quality team, and it feels really good to have
proved them wrong.
"We would have loved to win, but we're very
happy. This whole season, we've worked so hard and
it really paid off in the end."
Seeded a lowly 20th despite winning the West Re
gionals, Stanford looked tc repeat the success of last
year's Cardinal team — which finished as the NCAA
runner-up — and regain the respect which had been
begrudged it all season long.
In what has become a familiar scenario, the squad
reached the road to redemption primarily behind the
stellar play of Ail-American Tiger Woods, who added
the NCAA individual crown to his Pac-10 and West
Region titles. Woods won despite shooting an un
characteristic 80 in a rough final round and seeing
his nine-stroke lead whittled down to four.
"I'm really exhausted," said Woods. "I really had
to reach deep down to make it through the last day.
"I played the other rounds in preparation for the
last one."
For the first three days, Woods played on a com
pletely separate level from the rest of the field, re
ducing the terrors of the intimidating Honors
Course to mere inconveniences as he finished with a
pair of 69s and a course-record 67. The course exact
ed its revenge on Woods in the final round, however,
as it stung him for a triple-bogey on No. 9 and bogeys
on four of the next six holes.
"He was just so amazing those first three days,"
said head coach Wally Goodwin, "but you can only
maintain that level of play so long and the course
humbled him on the last day.
"The way he was able to keep it together after that
rough patch was a real testament to his maturity. To
survive in the face of that kind of difficulty, that's
the sign of a true champion."
As Woods suffered a rare lapse in his normally
dominant game, however, Chang brought his game
up a level, firing the low round of the day in a bril-

four-round total was still good enough to outpace his closest competitor by four strokes.
liant recovery from what had been
a difficult tournament. After
back-to-back plus-80 scores,
Chang leapt nearly 30 places on
the final day to finish 45th over
all.
In simplest terms, the day was
his, with even his few errant shots
finding their way into fortunate
locations. The highlight was a
magnificent chip-in out of the
bunker on No. 14 for a birdie.
"It may very well have been the
best round of my life," Chang
said. "It was great to come out
here and finish things off strong.
"I also felt really good about
taking some of the pressure off
Tiger. We ask so much of him that
it was nice that he could have an
off-round and still have us finish
near the top as a team."
It was an emotional week for
Chang and fellow senior David
Garcia, as the pair witnessed the
close of their collegiate careers. In
a season of lasts for the duo, the
final 18 holes proved to be hardest
for both them and the team.
"It never changes, there's al
ways a time when I have to let my
players go," Goodwin said. "I've
gotten to see both guys come a
long way as golfers and as young
men. They've given so much of
themselves to the program, we're
going to miss them a lot.
"Jerry has provided us with
some really great leadership this
season. Always uplifting, always a
fighter, he did so much to prepare
the team to handle all these chal
lenges."
With the departure of such ex
perience, freshman Joel Kribel
and junior Conrad Ray will both
be expected to raise their games a
notch. Kribel, who finished 31st,
regained form after disappointing
second and third rounds to con
tribute a solid 74 to the team ef
fort on the final day.
"Joel really showed how far
along he's come this year by fin
ishing strong," Goodwin said. "He
could have packed it in and said
'Oh, the course if just too tough,'
but instead he bounced back."
For Ray, who finished 61st, the
week proved to be a bit trying, as
he found the rhythm which had
been so elusive at times this sea
son, but couldn't seem to trans
late it into low scores.
"The putts just weren't drop

ping for me," Ray said. "I felt like
I was hitting pretty well, but I
couldn't score quite as well as I
would have liked.
"It didn't help that the course
was so challenging, either. There
were just no easy holes to make up
strokes."
Ray's futility against the Hon
ors course was in no way the ex
ception. In the most important
tournament of the season, with
all the best collegiate golfers vying
for the biggest prize, it was the
course that proved to be the most
intimidating foe, playing the play
ers and leaving most weary and
defeated.

'We've spent a lot of
time preparing
ourselves mentally to
withstand whatever
is thrown at us. The
crowds, the press,
none of it fazed us.'

"This course was just way
above most of these players," Ray
said. "You really had to play it con
servatively, even defensively. The
intelligent approach was to try not
to go for anjlhing too risky and
end up making big numbers. Just
try to make par and wait for other
teams to make the big numbers."
A minefield of ball-swallowing
roughs, pencil-thin fairways and
rock-hard, undulating greens, the
course proved to be indiscrimi
nately unforgiving, even gaining
deep respect from medalist
Woods.
"This is by far the hardest
course I've ever played on in col
lege," he said.
And despite the eye-poppingly
high scores, the course may have
played to Stanford's favor.
"The trick is just to survive on
this course, to let the other teams
bleed more than you," Goodwin
said. "That's a lot like our ap
proach to the season. We've spent
a lot of time preparing ourselves
mentally to withstand whatever is
thrown at us.
"The crowds [an NCAA-record
14,692], the press, none of it fazed
us. I feel wonderful about how
mentally tough this team was."

said head coach Wally Goodwin, "but you can only
maintain that level of play so long and the course
humbled him on the last day.
"The way he was able to keep it together after that
rough patch was a real testament to his maturity. To
survive in the face of that kind of difficulty, that's
the sign of a true champion."
As Woods suffered a rare lapse in his normally
dominant game, however, Chang brought his game
up a level, firing the low round of the day in a bril-

Tiger Woods shot an 80 on Saturday in the final round of the NCAA Championships, but his
four-round total was still good enough to outpace his closest competitor by four strokes.
liant recovery from what had been
a difficult tournament. After
back-to-back plus-80 scores,
Chang leapt nearly 30 places on
the final day to finish 45th over
all.
In simplest terms, the day was
his, with even his few errant shots
finding their way into fortunate
locations. The highlight was a
magnificent chip-in out of the
bunker on No. 14 for a birdie.
"It may very well have been the
best round of my life," Chang
said. "It was great to come out
here and finish things off strong.
"I also felt really good about
taking some of the pressure off
Tiger. We ask so much of him that
it was nice that he could have an
off-round and still have us finish
near the top as a team."
It was an emotional week for
Chang and fellow senior David
Garcia, as the pair witnessed the
close of their collegiate careers. In
a season of lasts for the duo, the
final 18 holes proved to be hardest
for both them and the team.
"It never changes, there's al
ways a time when I have to let my
players go," Goodwin said. "I've
gotten to see both guys come a
long way as golfers and as young
men. They've given so much of
themselves to the program, we're
going to miss them a lot.
"Jerry has provided us with
some really great leadership this
season. Always uplifting, always a
fighter, he did so much to prepare
the team to handle all these chal
lenges."
With the departure of such ex
perience, freshman Joel Kribel
and junior Conrad Ray will both
be expected to raise their games a
notch. Kribel, who finished 31st,
regained form after disappointing
second and third rounds to con
tribute a solid 74 to the team ef
fort on the final day.
"Joel really showed how far
along he's come this year by fin
ishing strong," Goodwin said. "He
could have packed it in and said
'Oh, the course if just too tough,'
but instead he bounced back."
For Ray, who finished 61st, the
week proved to be a bit trying, as
he found the rhythm which had
been so elusive at times this sea
son, but couldn't seem to trans
late it into low scores.
"The putts just weren't drop

ping for me," Ray said. "I felt like
I was hitting pretty well, but I
couldn't score quite as well as I
would have liked.
"It didn't help that the course
was so challenging, either. There
were just no easy holes to make up
strokes."
Ray's futility against the Hon
ors course was in no way the ex
ception. In the most important
tournament of the season, with
all the best collegiate golfers vying
for the biggest prize, it was the
course that proved to be the most
intimidating foe, playing the play
ers and leaving most weary and
defeated.

'We've spent a lot of
time preparing
ourselves mentally to
withstand whatever
is thrown at us. The
crowds, the press,
none of it fazed us.'

"This course was just way
above most of these players," Ray
said. "You really had to play it con
servatively, even defensively. The
intelligent approach was to try not
to go for anjlhing too risky and
end up making big numbers. Just
try to make par and wait for other
teams to make the big numbers."
A minefield of ball-swallowing
roughs, pencil-thin fairways and
rock-hard, undulating greens, the
course proved to be indiscrimi
nately unforgiving, even gaining
deep respect from medalist
Woods.
"This is by far the hardest
course I've ever played on in col
lege," he said.
And despite the eye-poppingly
high scores, the course may have
played to Stanford's favor.
"The trick is just to survive on
this course, to let the other teams
bleed more than you," Goodwin
said. "That's a lot like our ap
proach to the season. We've spent
a lot of time preparing ourselves
mentally to withstand whatever is
thrown at us.
"The crowds [an NCAA-record
14,692], the press, none of it fazed
us. I feel wonderful about how
mentally tough this team was."
