# TOP 10 SPORTS STORIES OF THE YEAR
## Stanford athletics caps another successful year 
### Bobby Cuza Editorial staff 
1 Tyrone Willingham res
urrects Stanford foot
• ball. College football pundits
figured Stanford football for dead at
the start of the 1995 season. The leg
endary Bill Walsh was gone, and new
coach Tyrone Willingham had no
head coaching experience to his
name. One Bay Area writer predict
ed the Cardinal would finish dead
last in the Pac-10 — "and they might
not be that good."
Well, not only did Willingham
steer Stanford clear of the confer
ence cellar, he guided the Cardinal to
a 4-0-1 start (the school's best in 44
years), a fourth-place conference fin
ish and a berth in the Liberty Bowl.
For his efforts, Willingham was
named Pac-10 Coach of the Year.
2 Men's tennis upsets
UCLA to take home the
• national championship.
If there was one thing standing in
the way of the men's tennis team and
an NCAA title this year, it was
UCLA. Stanford was winless in
three regular-season meetings

against the Bruins and was a miser
able 0-10 against UCLA's top three
players. Meanwhile, the Bruins,
boasting three of the top 30 players
in the nation, cruised into NCAAs
with a 24-0 mark.
Thus, few gave the Cardinal a
chance when Stanford and UCLA
advanced to the final. But after drop
ping the doubles point, the Stanford
men stormed back to take the Nos. 3
through 6 singles matches, clinching
a 4-1 victory and a second-straight
national championship.
3 Interim head coach Amy
Tucker guides women's
• basketball to the Final
Four. Expectations for the Stanford
women's basketball team were un
usually subdued this year. With 10-
year head coach Tara VanDerveer on
a one-year leave of absence to coach
the Olympic team, assistant Amy
Tucker was asked to step in and take
the reigns of a program that had lost
three starters to graduation.
Thanks in large part to the lead
ership of Jamila Wideman and Kate
Starbird, Tucker had little trouble
fdling VanDerveer's shoes. She guid
ed her team to an undefeated Pac-10

record (the first undefeated confer
ence season since 1988), a 29-3 over
all mark and a thrilling run to the
Women's Final Four.
4 Tiger Woods breezes to
an NCAA title. Sophomore
• Tiger Woods has accom
plished so much in his young career
that his achievements are some
times taken for granted. But no one
should downplay the significance of
his performance last week at the
NCAA championships in Chat
tanooga, Tenn. Woods absolutely de
stroyed the tournament field, set
ting a new course record and estab
lishing a nine-stroke lead after three
rounds. Even an 8-over-par 80 on
the final day wasn't enough to deny
Woods the NCAA individual title.
5 Seniors lead women's
swimming to a fifth
• straight NCAA champi
onship.
NCAA titles are nothing new for
the women's swimming team, which
took home its fifth consecutive na
tional championship at Ann Arbor,
Mich., on March 21-23.
Led by the outstanding efforts of
seniors Lisa Jacob, Jane Skill man,
Jessica Tong and Maureen McLaren
as well as junior Claudia Franco, the
Cardinal women broke Stanford's
national championship drought by
running away from the field, finish
ing 81 points ahead of second-place
Southern Methodist.
6 Men's basketball knocks
off UCLA. The men's bas
• ketball team provided plenty
of thrills for Stanford fans this sea
son — the Cardinal beat Arizona
twice, routed Cal at home and nearly
knocked off top-ranked UMass in
the second round of the NCAA tour
nament — but nothing was quite as
spectacular as the men's electrifying
victory over UCLA on Feb. 10.
Before a vociferous home crowd
at Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal
snapped a 10-game losing streak
against UCLA by edging the defend
ing national champion Bruins, 67-
66.

-7 Baseball wins 18 straight
to set a new school
• record. Things weren't
looking up for the Stanford baseball
team after a three-game sweep at the
hands of USC in mid-April dropped
the team to 10-11 in Six-Pac play.
But things came together in a big
way for the Cardinal, which reeled
off 16 straight victories to close out
the regular season, helping the
squad earn a No. 2 seed in the NCAA
West Regional. The Cardinal picked
up right where it left off in the post
season, notching two more wins over
Cal-State Fullerton and Mississippi
State being ousted from the tourney
thanks to a pair of one-run losses to
Florida State and Cal State-North
ridge.
BBachrach and Ellis win
titles as men's gymnas
• tics hosts the NCAA
championships. Despite falling
short in its bid to repeat as national
champions, the Stanford men's
gymnastics team couldn't help but
be pleased with the results of the
NCAA Championships at Maples
Pavilion on April 25-27.
Not only did the Cardinal finish
third in the nation in a year that saw
it lose top gymnast Tim Daliymple
to injury, but it also boasted five All-
Americans. Junior lan Bachrach
took home an individual title in the
floor exercise with a season-high
score of 9.913, and junior Jamie Ellis
tied for top honors on the parallel
bars, scoring a 9.75 to match Blaine
Wilson of Ohio State.
9 Stanford gets the Axe
back. The 1995 Stanford
• football team turned in a
solid year, upsetting defending Pac
-10 champion Oregon on the road,
nearly upending USC in Los Angeles
and earning a trip the Liberty Bowl.
But this is Stanford football, where
there is only one true measuring
stick for success — Big Game.
Before 72,893 fans at Stanford
Stadium on Nov. 18, the Cardinal
capitalized on a controversial fourth
quarter fumble by Cal tight end
Tony Gonzalez to seal a 29-24 victo

ry over the Golden Bears and bring
the Axe home to Stanford.

women's volleyball team looked un
touchable for much of the year, clos
ing out the regular season by win
ning 23 straight matches (including
30 consecutive games) and establish

ing itself as the favorite for the
NCAA championship.
But after breezing to the national
semifinals, the women were tripped
up by fifth-ranked Texas, which had
beaten an iryuiy-depleted Cardinal
squad early in the season to account
for one of the team's only two losses.
A heartbreaking five-set loss to the
Longhorns left many to wonder
what could have been.

three starters to graduation.
Thanks in large part to the lead
ership of Jamila Wideman and Kate
Starbird, Tucker had little trouble
fdling VanDerveer's shoes. She guid
ed her team to an undefeated Pac-10

record (the first undefeated confer
ence season since 1988), a 29-3 over
all mark and a thrilling run to the
Women's Final Four.
4 Tiger Woods breezes to
an NCAA title. Sophomore
• Tiger Woods has accom
plished so much in his young career
that his achievements are some
times taken for granted. But no one
should downplay the significance of
his performance last week at the
NCAA championships in Chat
tanooga, Tenn. Woods absolutely de
stroyed the tournament field, set
ting a new course record and estab
lishing a nine-stroke lead after three
rounds. Even an 8-over-par 80 on
the final day wasn't enough to deny
Woods the NCAA individual title.

swimming to a fifth

onship.
NCAA titles are nothing new for
the women's swimming team, which
took home its fifth consecutive na
tional championship at Ann Arbor,
Mich., on March 21-23.
Led by the outstanding efforts of
seniors Lisa Jacob, Jane Skill man,
Jessica Tong and Maureen McLaren
as well as junior Claudia Franco, the
Cardinal women broke Stanford's
national championship drought by
running away from the field, finish
ing 81 points ahead of second-place
Southern Methodist.
6 Men's basketball knocks
off UCLA. The men's bas
• ketball team provided plenty
of thrills for Stanford fans this sea
son — the Cardinal beat Arizona
twice, routed Cal at home and nearly
knocked off top-ranked UMass in
the second round of the NCAA tour
nament — but nothing was quite as
spectacular as the men's electrifying
victory over UCLA on Feb. 10.
Before a vociferous home crowd
at Maples Pavilion, the Cardinal
snapped a 10-game losing streak
against UCLA by edging the defend
ing national champion Bruins, 67-
66.

-7 Baseball wins 18 straight
to set a new school
• record. Things weren't
looking up for the Stanford baseball
team after a three-game sweep at the
hands of USC in mid-April dropped
the team to 10-11 in Six-Pac play.
But things came together in a big
way for the Cardinal, which reeled
off 16 straight victories to close out
the regular season, helping the
squad earn a No. 2 seed in the NCAA
West Regional. The Cardinal picked
up right where it left off in the post
season, notching two more wins over
Cal-State Fullerton and Mississippi
State being ousted from the tourney
thanks to a pair of one-run losses to
Florida State and Cal State-North
ridge.
BBachrach and Ellis win
titles as men's gymnas
• tics hosts the NCAA
championships. Despite falling
short in its bid to repeat as national
champions, the Stanford men's
gymnastics team couldn't help but
be pleased with the results of the
NCAA Championships at Maples
Pavilion on April 25-27.
Not only did the Cardinal finish
third in the nation in a year that saw
it lose top gymnast Tim Daliymple
to injury, but it also boasted five All-
Americans. Junior lan Bachrach
took home an individual title in the
floor exercise with a season-high
score of 9.913, and junior Jamie Ellis
tied for top honors on the parallel
bars, scoring a 9.75 to match Blaine
Wilson of Ohio State.
9 Stanford gets the Axe
back. The 1995 Stanford
• football team turned in a
solid year, upsetting defending Pac
-10 champion Oregon on the road,
nearly upending USC in Los Angeles
and earning a trip the Liberty Bowl.
But this is Stanford football, where
there is only one true measuring
stick for success — Big Game.
Before 72,893 fans at Stanford
Stadium on Nov. 18, the Cardinal
capitalized on a controversial fourth
quarter fumble by Cal tight end
Tony Gonzalez to seal a 29-24 victo

ry over the Golden Bears and bring
the Axe home to Stanford.
-| Women's volleyball
I I stumbles in the Final
-L •Four. The Stanford
women's volleyball team looked un
touchable for much of the year, clos
ing out the regular season by win
ning 23 straight matches (including
30 consecutive games) and establish

ing itself as the favorite for the
NCAA championship.
But after breezing to the national
semifinals, the women were tripped
up by fifth-ranked Texas, which had
beaten an iryuiy-depleted Cardinal
squad early in the season to account
for one of the team's only two losses.
A heartbreaking five-set loss to the
Longhorns left many to wonder
what could have been.
