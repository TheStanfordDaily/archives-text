# Kris Atteberry: The voice of KZSU sports
## Popular student sports broadcaster spreads cheer far and wide 
### Allison Otto Staff writer 
To many Stanford sports fans, Kris At
teberry is simply a voice.
As the famed sports announcer of
KZSU, Atteberry has logged more than
800 hours on the air, broadcasting hun
dreds of Stanford games to attentive lis
teners across the country.
Atteberry, a senior majoring in Eng
lish, remains surprised by the number of
fans who go to such great lengths to listen
to his broadcasts.
During the baseball NCAA regionals
this year at Sunken Diamond, an older
fan approached Atteberry.
"He's like, 'You know, I have to park in
a garage in South San Francisco,' " Atte
berry said. "'lt's the only place in the
whole town I can get your broadcast, but
I park in this body shop and I listen to the
games.'"
The parents of Stanford athletes also
appreciate Kris' efforts.
"Jay Pecci's parents told me that they

were listening in a van. They were listen
ing to the regional broadcast last year and
the only way they could get us in was in
their car radio on top of this parking lot,"
Atteberry said. "And they were in there,
like five of them, listening to the game
and the cops came, because someone
called and reported suspicious activity.
They convinced him they weren't doing
anything wrong and [the cop] just kinda
wanted to know the score.
"It's kind of cool to know that you've
got people listening to you on the phone
from all over the country. The Petersons
[parents of sophomore pitcher Kyle Pe
terson] call up from Nebraska, you've got
the Sullivans [parents of junior pitcher
Brendan Sullivan] from Washington,
D.C. It's nice to know that the people that
you're broadcasting the games to appreci
ate that you're doing that. They're the
ones who listen to every game, because
it's their kids and they want to know."
Atteberry spent his own share of time
listening to sports broadcasts as a child
growing up in Bozeman, Mont.

"Montana State University is in Boze
man, and so I listened to the Bobcats, and
I was a huge fan," Atteberry said. "They
were my heroes, and the broadcast guy
was my hero. He would do their games on
the radio, and I'd listen to them all. I'd
listen and I'd shoot Nerf hoops and recre
ate what he was talking about. I still
think he's got one of the best voices I've
ever heard in radio. He's very good."
According to Atteberry's co-announc
er, sophomore David Flemming, two of
his partner's greatest assets are his
boundless vocabulary and his patented
phrases.
"He makes a lot of his games and plays
that he calls kind of epic-sounding,"
Flemming said. "He embellishes with big
words. He is huge into vocabulary. You
just know that he's an English major
when you listen to him.
"He completely has patented the
phrase 'three-ball corner pocket.' He
loved to say that for basketball. Every
three-point shot from the corner was
'three-ball corner pocket,' and I remem

her we'd always wait to see if he'd extend
the pool simile."
Although Atteberry loved broadcast
ing men's basketball games, one of his fa
vorite announcing moments occurred at
last year's baseball regionals.
"It was raining all week," Atteberry
said. "There was rain delays. Stanford
had to win like three straight. Eric Sees
pounded one off the wall in the bottom of
the last inning. It was pitch black out.
Everyone was going bananas. Or when
Kyle [Peterson] got the last out to go to
the World Series and all of a sudden it
just started raining."
Atteberry considers the act of trans
forming moments like these into words
that captivate his listeners to be the ulti
mate challenge and allure of radio broad
casting.
"I think I did a pretty decent job, and I
hoped people liked it," Atteberry said.
"And if it gets people excited about the
sports and gets them to go to a game, and
gets them to support the team, then I
think I did my job well."
