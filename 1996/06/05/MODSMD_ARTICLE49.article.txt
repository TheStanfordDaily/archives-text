# The 1995-96 awards for excellence in Cardinal athletics
## 
### 
THE TIME HAS finally come, and
as I try to choke back my tears, I
will close out my tenure as sports
editor with my post season awards for ex
cellence in Cardinal sports.
While I realize my awards from last
week failed to make an impact on those it
was addressed to (Walton still sucked in
the Sonics-Jazz telecast yesterday), I
hope that these awards will provide some
measure of satisfaction for the following
coaches and athletes:
Most Outstanding Team: The
women's swimming and diving team
roared back from its early-season under
dog position to demolish the entire field
at the NCAA championships. The Cardi
nal swimmers and divers, led by seniors
Jessica Tong, Maureen McLaren, Lisa
Jacob and Jane Skillman, ran away with
Stanford's fifth-consecutive title, "edg
ing out" SMU by the score of 478.2-397.
Runner-up: The men's tennis team,
which after losing to UCLA three times
this year, repeated as national champs,
after knocking off the Bruins in the fi
nals of the NCAA Championships. The
victory over the Bruins came on the heels
of an impressive comeback win in the
semi-finals over the hometown-favorite
University of Georgia.

Most Outstanding Athlete: No
Cardinal athlete enjoyed as much suc
cess as super-sophomore Tiger Woods.
Woods finished an impressive year by
winning the NCAA individual title last
weekend in Chattanooga, Tenn. The title
caps off an unbelievable run for Woods,
who won the Western Regional individ
ual title, as well. As of now, Woods plans
to remain an amateur and to return to
the Farm next year.
Most Valuable Player: (tie): The
MVP award fort his year is shared by two
of the most creative basketball players
Stanford has ever seen. Juniors Kate
Starbird and Brevin Knight led their re
spective teams to two of the finest Cardi
nal hoops finishes in recent memory, as
the women went 28-3 (18-0 in the Pac
-10) and the men ended their season at
20-9 (12-6 in the Pac-10). Starbird, who
was named Pac-10 Co-Player of the Year,
averaged 20.1 points-per-game. Knight,
who received honorable mention Ail-
American honors from The Associated
Press, UPI and Basketball Weekly, led
the Cardinal in scoring (15.5 ppg) and as
sists (7.3 apg).
Coach of the Year: Tyrone Willing
ham gets the nod for Coach of the Year
for turning around the Cardinal football

program. Willingham inherited a 3-7-1
(2-6 in the Pac-10) team, that lost its top
two quarterbacks and its top receiver.
Undaunted, Willingham calmly led Stan
ford to a 7-4-1 record (5-3 in the Pac-10)
and a berth in the Liberty Bowl.

Itunners-up: Both Richard Quick
(women's swimming and diving) and
Dick Gould (men's tennis) could stake
claims to the Coach of the Year Award.
Both coaches led an underrated power
house to national championships —
Quick's fifth-straight and Gould's sec
ond- straight title.
Rookie of the Year: In one of the
most heated races for a postseason
honor, tennis superstar Ryan Wolters
edged out runner Mary Cobb and golfer

Joel Kribel. While Cobb and Kribel en
joyed much success this season, Wolters
year-long performance stops nothing
short of spectacular. As only a freshman,
Wolters sky-rocketed in the collegiate
rankings until reaching the top spot in
January. As if the individual success was
not enough, Wolters won the NCAA title
clinching match against UCLA two
weeks ago in Athens, Ga. On a lighter
note, Wolters had the pleasure of taking
on Andre Agassi earlier this year. De
spite losing the match, Wolters out
classed Agassi, who tried to treat Wolters
like a baby. No doubt Cardinal tennis
fans can't wait until Wolters matures.
Andre, you big jerk.
Most Improved Player: Women's
basketball star, Vanessa Nygaard, made
the most impressive improvements of
any Cardinal athlete in 1995-1996. Ny
gaard, who was still recovering from a
knee injury two seasons ago, caught fire
this past year to help lift the Cardinal to
a second-straight Final Four Appear
ance. Statistically, Nygaard improve
ments were spectacular — she went from
8.8 minutes played per game in the '94-
'95 season to 31.6 minutes per game in
'95-'96. She did not waste that time, ei
ther, as she upped her scoring average

from 3.2 ppg. to 14.2 ppg., her rebound
margin from 2.2 rpg to 7.0 rpg. Addition
ally, she set a school record for most
three-pointers in a season with 75.
Well that's it for the postseason
awards. Congratulations to all the win
ners (I have no prizes for you). As noted
above, this column also marks the end of
my reign as sports editor.
During my reign at the Daily Sports
department, Stanford athletes brought
home two national team titles and multi
ple individual titles. I've been able to
write about winning, losing, sexual mis
conduct, the stupidity of Todd Bozeman,
ludicrous NCAA drug-testing proce
dures, the hypocrisy of my own profes
sion, the mendacity of Nike, the gra
ciousness of Kirby Puckett, the evilness
of the Dallas Cowboys and the class of the
Stanford Athletics Program as a whole.
It's been a full five months.
It is my sincere hope that at some
point during my tenure, I provided you
with some sports insight, some humor
and above all, conscientious material. In
case you missed my articles, or think I
failed in any respect, fear not — I shall
return.
I decided I wasn't quite ready for the
pro circuit after all.
