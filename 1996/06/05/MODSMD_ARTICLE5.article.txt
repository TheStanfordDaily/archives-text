# 'Our problems are your problems... today we all live in a global village'
## Former Polish president Walesa advocates unity 
### Burt Herman Editorial staff 
Though he was wearing a business suit
and standing behind a lectern, Nobel Peace
Laureate Lech Walesa addressed a standing
room-only crowd at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
in much the same manner he might have
talked to his former coworkers at the ship
yard in Gdansk, Poland.

"Since I'm not a diplomat, I'm very
straightforward," Walesa said through a
translator, going through his prepared re
marks in a half hour so he could spend the
majority of his time answering questions. "If
it turns out to be boring it will also be your
fault," he told the audience, which awarded
him standing ovations at both the beginning
and end of his speech on Friday.
Walesa, whom many consider as instru

mental in thawing the Cold War as Mikhail
Gorbachev and Vaclav Havel, called on the
United States to remember the developing
countries in Eastern Europe.
"Our problems are your problems," Wale
sa said. "Today we all live in a global village."
Through the opposition group Solidarity,
Walesa's open dissidence to the Communist
regime ultimately led to the formation of
democracy in Poland through a peaceful tran

sition of power. "Our revolution shot cham
pagne corks," Walesa said to the applause of
the audience.
Walesa served as the first democratically
elected president of Poland until losing in last
year's election to former Communist Alek
sander Kwasniewski.
Doing what seems typical of ex-presidents,
Walesa is currently on a speaking
tour of the United States to advo
cate for his country's cause and to
raise money for a foundation he has
formed to bolster the party system
in Poland. His appearance here was
sponsored by Stanford-in-Govern
ment, the Center for Russian and
East European Studies, the Insti
tute for International Studies and
the Hoover Institution.
It is this kind of advocacy that
Walesa hopes will lead to a more in
ternationalist future. "We need to
pull the Berlin Wall down once
again, but this time it will be the
Berlin Wall in people's minds," he
said.
Walesa frequently waxed comic
during his remarks, joking that his
translator was not properly inter
preting his remarks and telling the
audience to "graduate quickly and
come to do good business in
Poland."
The time has come for a new
Marshall Plan in Europe, Walesa
said. "Communism in America can
be imposed overnight, but it's very

hard to do it in reverse," he said,
calling for assistance from the
West. In the future, "there will not
be people dying because they were
shot, there will be people dying be
cause they are starving," he said.

'We need to pull the
Berlin Wall down once
again, but this time it
will be the Berlin Wall
in people's minds.'

"The situation can get hot in Eu
rope to such an extent the Ameri
cans will have to get involved,"
Walesa said.
Although the fate of the Polish
people in the past has been inti
mately tied with Russia, Walesa ex
pressed no fears about the potential
return of communism in the former
Soviet Union. Walesa said he favors
Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
but added that this month's elec
tion will be largely symbolic. "It
doesn't really matter how people

vote, it matters how the votes are
being counted." But he tempered
his remarks with a warning: "The
Russian bear can get agitated and
start a war."
At a press conference after his
speech, Walesa said the freedom he
has in his current role allows him to
do things that he couldn't do if he
were stili president, such as taking
his campaign for Western support
of Poland on the road.
"You didn't feel like going to
Warsaw," Walesa said. "So I am
coming to you."
Walesa's campaign seems to be
working. Just last week, he met
with Sen. Bob Dole in Chicago; on
Monday, Dole announced his inten
tion to author a bill before he retires
from office pledging support for
Eastern Europe's inclusion into
NATO.
Despite having won so many
awards that he said he would need a
crane to lift him if he were to wear
them all, Walesa has also not forgot
ten his humble origins as an electri
cian. He said he Ls not currently
planning to run for president again.
"I would like to go back to the ship
yard to work," Walesa said. "The
electric current got to know me;
there is no other place for me to rest."
