# Stanford and Marianne Stanley proved a perfect match
## 
### 
Leave it to me to write a final column
of the year about a Cal head coach.
Marianne Stanley heads the
women's basketball program in Berkeley
now, but her one-year stay at Stanford
highlighted a year in which new coaches
left an immediate imprint on the Farm.
One can safely assume that Stanley's
situation had no parallel in sports. For
over 20 years, she had been one of the
most recognizable faces in her sport, a
true ambassador of her game. She had run
out of fingers for her Final Four rings,
some of which stemmed from her days as
a player at Immaculata (Pa.) College, the
first women's basketball team to garner
mainstream attention.
Immediately after hanging up her
shoes, she grabbed a whistle and coached
Old Dominion to three national titles.
From there, she took on the challenge of
rebuilding a Penn team and learned that
rebuilding without athletic scholarships
was a daunting task, winning just 11
games in two years. So she set up shop at
USC for what she believed would be her
final stop.
She improved the Women of Troy in
each of her four years, turning USC from
a once-dominant squad that had fallen on
hard times to one poised to challenge for

the league title and a Final Four berth.
Then it happened.
Everybody has a general idea of what
"it" is, yet nobody seems to know the par
ticulars. Stanley wanted equal pay to that
of then-USC men's coach George Ravel
ing, now a CBS blabbermouth. Athletic di
rector Mike Garrett did not grant her
wish. It has been said that Garrett once
agreed with Stanley and then reneged,
but only Stanley, Garrett and a select few
really have any clue as to what happened.

In any event, Stanley slapped USC
with a discrimination suit (that remains
alive despite repeated setbacks), and Gar
rett slapped the Pac-10 Coach of the Year
with a pink slip. Women of Troy players
were furious.

But Cheryl Miller, now a TNT blabber
mouth and arguably the most famous
player in women's hoops history, stepped
in with her first coachingjob, temporarily
easing some of the players' hard feelings.
USC went on to win the Pac-10 title. And
Stanley disappeared.
She resurfaced as director of women's
basketball promotions at Stanford for a
while, and then moved into the furniture
business. No program would hire her.
Hardly anybody would grant an inter
view.
Now regardless of whether Stanley or
women's coaches in general deserve equal
pay, stop and think about the sacrifice
Stanley made. Defending a cause she felt
was just, Stanley was ceremoniously ru
ined, forced to scrounge for employment
and banished from the only life she had
known. Had she done anything to warrant
the universal blacklisting that ensued?
A happy ending to Stanley's saga
seemed as unlikely as Raveling blossom
ing into a competent broadcaster. But
when Stanford skipper Tara VanDerveer
was called upon to head the Senior Na
tional Team after the 1994-95 campaign,
associate coach Amy Tucker was promot
ed to interim head coach and two assis
tants, Julie Plank (recently hired to Jim

Foster's Vanderbilt staff) and Carolyn
Jenkins fled the scene. Stanford's once
vaunted staff now had one returning
member, and she had never served as a
head coach. That set the stage for Stan
ley's return to the bench.
Stanley was named co-head coach, and
since she had the experience as the woman
in charge, many outsiders felt she would
do the same at Stanford. While Tucker
knew the players, Stanley knew how to be
a head coach. Would there be conflict
among the two? Would Tucker feel
stepped on after her many years of service,
and would Stanley ruffle any feathers?
With an undeniably awkward situa
tion, Tucker and Stanley adjusted and
turned into a potent combination. As the
season approached, it became clear that
the buck stopped with Tuck. Stanley
stayed in the background.
But from the background, she concen
trated on her primary area of expertise —
defense. Like a master carpenter, Stanley
used her tools to build the Cardinal's stingi
est defense since the 19705, when women's
hoops was an afterthought at Stanford.
With Tucker and Stanley, the Cardinal re
turned to the Final Four, and the twosome
won some national coaching awards.

rap she had accumulated. She never ruf
fled a feather with administration and
never exhibited any tendencies of being
difficult to work with. She demonstrated
an undeniable reputation as a player's
coach. More than a couple times on the
road, former players came to chat and wish
her the best, and she greeted them with
warm embraces and long conversations.
Stanley and Stanford shared a symbi
otic relationship that was made more bit
tersweet by the knowledge that their time
together was brief. Stanford was grateful
for the stability that Stanley provided,
and Stanley felt indebted to the one school
that gave her a chance to get back into the
world she helped to mold.
The year that could have torn some
programs apart only served to make Stan
ford stronger. The players proved to a re
lentless media that they could in fact win
without VanDerveer. Tucker demonstrat
ed she could be in charge, taking over the
reins with remarkable ease, yet chose to
stay, as VanDerveer had hoped and ex
pected. Two new assistants with Stanford
basketball in their blood joined the ship,
and VanDerveer helped to resurrect the
career of her longtime friend. And Stanley
magically returned to good graces, where
she should have been all along.
