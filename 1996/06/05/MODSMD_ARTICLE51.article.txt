# Reflections upon a favorite rite of spring – sloshball
## 
### 
Every year, on Saturday mornings in
early May, my friends and I help
usher in the spring.
We roll out of bed around 10 a.m., al
though an unlucky few must wake even ear
lier to collect the material necessary for the
day's endeavor. Once these worthy individ
uals have returned from their mission, we
all lend a helping hand and carry the equip
ment down to the field of battle. The slosh
ball game begins shortly thereafter.
For those of you unfamiliar with slosh
ball, or Gusto, as we like to call it, allow me
to explain. It's essentially kickball, much
like the game we all played as children — we
even use one of those big red balls common
to elementary school playgrounds.
There is, however, a twist — one reflec
tive of our more mature age (if not of our
more mature demeanor). Runs are scored
not only every time a player crosses home
plate, but also eveiy time a player finishes a
can of beer.
Coolers filled with the most vile of brews
are soon placed around each bench; garbage
bags wait nearby to collect the "runs," dis
carded cans drained of their contents by
thirsty men. Bases, usually someone's shirt
or the cardboard boxes that the cans came in,
are placed strategically upon the grass. Fi
nally, the big red ball makes its appearance.

After the national anthem and the requi
site team shotguns, play gets underway.
And although each game is an adventure
unto itself, I have noticed a few trends over
the years.
In the early innings, it is difficult to score
by conventional means and players make up
for it on the sidelines. As the game progress
es, however, the athletic prowess of the indi
viduals involved, how should I put it, deteri
orates. The gradual loss of skill takes a
greater toll on the defense and it becomes
easier to put a run across the plate. This
doesn't mean that the rate at which the
garbage bags are being filled slows down,
just that the action on the field grows in in
tensity (and in hilarity).
Those adhering to the "strike early,
strike often" approach walk a fine line be
tween hero and goat. For example, Dee
Brown is well-known for working his way
through a half-rack in the first two innings
to give his team an early lead. Afterwards,
however, he remains in the game, sporting
the Keystone box as a helmet / trophy.
On the other hand, Dennis the Menace
often declares himself the designated
drinker and lingers on the sidelines while
his teammates labor in the field, giving him
more time to concentrate on his true
strength. While his strong efforts are appre

dated at first, his gangly frame can often be
found curled around a tree by the day's end.
Though the heaviest "hitters" tend to be
the largest players, it is not a rule without
exceptions. The Head and The Mo put much
larger players to shame with the vast
amounts they consume. And Atlas Mc-
Carthy has been unable to live up to the ex-

pectations created by his bulk, much to the
chagrin of his captain, Tyler O'Hara. Atlas is
still a youth, though, and he'll learn.
Despite the fact that 80 percent of all
runs end up in the garbage bag instead of
coming across home plate, there are still
those who concentrate on the game in the
field. However, by the third inning, no play
er worth his salt isn't at least a little bit un
certain on his feet, making for some enter

tain ing attempts at base running and de
fense. It isn't unusual to see a fly ball bounce
off the heads of three or four people before
it's finally caught. It becomes harder not to
spill your beer during a catch, resulting in an
error and giving the batter first base.
By the fifth inning, the gap between
those players who are merely drunk and
those who are completely sloshed has mani
fested itself. The merely drunk still make
the motions, while the sloshed simply make
a mockery.
I, myself, have been know to deviate from
the base path long enough to tackle the
right-fielder, as The Head can attest. Base
stealing takes on a whole new meaning,
when little Patrick Higgins starts ripping
the bases out from underneath runners.
The fun really begins, however, when the
first baseman attempts to bean his own
teammates with the ball.
All the action on the field pales in com
parison to what occurs off it. Less-than
scrupulous players will attempt to steal Kins
from the other team's bag while it is out in
the field. While devious behavior is oflen
honored and encouraged, deliberately de
structive behavior is not. For example, uri
nating on the other team's bag is almost
guaranteed to earn a beating.
These off-the-field antics always manage

to supersede the actual contest. I always
know that the game's nearing completion
when O'Hara starts screaming about Geor
gia or the Foo Fighters. I always know it's
over when he's on the ground, wrestling
with The Hirsute Armenian, my cousin
Dale or The DMA.
In the years we've been playing this
game, I don't think we've ever come close to
actually finishing the ninth inning. I was ac
tually surprised that our latest contest
reached the eighth. However, it was not
meant to be as Monkeyfingers Lorenzo
kicked the ball into a tree, where it impaled
itself on a branch.
Without a ball and running out of beer,
the longest game in my memory came to a
close. I can't say I was disappointed. Never
before had anyone actually counted the cans
— they just get tossed in the recycling bin —
and no one can ever remember the score of
the game after the fourth inning.
But that's all right. Gusto is the best
game we've ever played because there are no
losers. And while some might say there's no
winners either, we disagree. The way we see
it, if we're horsing around with good friends,
having fun in the sun, we're all winners.

The names have been changed to protect the
