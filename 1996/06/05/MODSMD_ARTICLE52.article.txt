# The Sonics can't break the Bulls barrier
## 
### 
I hate to say I told you so. Well,
actually, I kind of eryoy it, but
that's not the point. In mid-
February I said good-bye to all of
you, my faithful readers, and left
you with only one promise: to re
turn in June to give you a preview
of the NBA Finals and another
Bulls ring.
Well, here I am.
After a grueling and, might I
add, sorry display of professional
basketball, the Seattle Sonics,
"Super" excluded for numerous
reasons, narrowly escaped the
Western Conference Finals to earn
the right to play the Chicago Bulls
in the NBA Finals.
For the first time in years, the
seeds have held and the teams with
the best records in the league this
year will meet head-to-head in a
best-of-seven series, beginning
tonight in Chicago.
The Bulls and the Sonics split
the regular-season series, with
each team winning at home. In No
vember, Seattle eked out a five
point victory at Key Arena, 97-92.
The Sonics win was hardly an indi
cation of the current Bulls. The
biggest abnormality in that early
autumn contest was the absence of
Dennis Rodman, who sat out due to
injury. Substituting for the five
time rebounding champ was rookie
Dickey Simpkins, who hauled
down just four rebounds, a total
Rodman will surpass halfway
through tonight's first quarter.
Rodman's absence was not the
only aberration in the game. Bulls
guard and leading scorer Michael
Jordan connected on just 6 of 19 at
tempts from the field and Bulls
point-forward Scottie Pippen hit
just 2 of 11 free throws. The Bulls
shot a dismal 16.7 percent from be
hind the three-point line.
Still, Seattle needed heroic per
formances from its superstars, for
ward Shawn Kemp and guard Gaiy
Payton, who combined for 51
points on 69 percent shooting.
While Kemp and Payton are ca
pable of putting up those numbers,
I sincerely hope they realize that
Jordan and Pippen may step up
their games just a bit.
The game also came in the midst
of an extended road trip which saw
the Bulls win all but that game, all
of them without Rodman.
Perhaps a better indication of
the matchup between the two
squads came in January. With the
Bulls at full strength, Chicago

ripped the Sonics at the United
Center, 113-87. The Bulls were
anything but the cold-shooting
squad that the Sonics saw two
months earlier, hitting 59.5 per
cent of their attempts, including 60
percent from three-point range.
In addition, the Bulls defense al
lowed for just 35.6 percent shoot
ing by the Sonics.
Yet we all know that this is no
longer the regular season, as the
Orlando Magic taught us. The play
offs are another ball game, literally.
Thus, let us look to some playoff
stats to analyze the matchup.

There is the obvious: Jordan is
leading the league in scoring at 32.3
per game and Rodman tops the re
bounders with 13.3 per contest. Yet
where the Bulls excel are in the lit
tle things. The Bulls have out-re
bounded their opponents by 10
boards per game, while the Sonics
are dead even with theirs. Chicago
has created 38 more steals than its
opponents; Seattle has taken away
the ball two times less than theirs.
Most telling, however, may be
the turnover story. The Bulls have
given the ball away 100 times less
the Sonics in the three playoff se
ries leading up to the Finals.
Still, what is most significant is
how these two teams match up
against each other, not against
other teams. I'll take Jordan
against any player in the league.
Payton is the Defensive Player of
the Year, of course, but he's not tall
enough to contain Jordan in the
post. God help Hersey Hawkins if
they put him on Jordan, and re
serve guard Nate McMillan has all
the size to take on the NBA MVP,
but none of the skills.
The question is not how the Son
ics will stop him (because they
won't), but how effective Jordan
will be defensively. Despite the
publicity about Jordan hopelessly
chasing around opposing team's
point guards, Michael once again
made the NBA All-Defensive team.

And this is the NBA Finals. Watch
what the two-time Defensive Play
er of the Year will do.
The other backcourt matchup
will most likely feature Hawkins
and Bulls guard Ron Harper.
Hawkins is a threat from long
range, but has lacked the aggres
siveness to take the ball to the hoop.
Harper has already shut down two
players with similar games. Harper
frustrated the Knicks' John Starks
all series long and completely shut
down Orlando's Dennis Scott, who
was outscored considerably by Rod
man.
The small forward position will
pit All-NBA First Team member
Pippen versus Seattle's Detlef
Schrempf. After seeing Pippen, sec
ond behind Payton in Defensive
Player of the Year voting, frustrate
Anfernee Hardaway in games two,
three and four, something tells me
not to be too concerned with
Schrempf.
On the other side of the court,
Pippen is too quick for Schrempf,
and if the Sonic forward decides to
give Scottie a cushion, it will be a
long series for Seattle.
Perhaps the most intriguing
matchup is at the power forward
position, where Kemp and Rodman
will do battle. Kemp has been un
stoppable at times in the Western
Conference playoffs and has a defi
nite strength advantage over Rod
man. Yet Rodman proved against
Shaq, the biggest physical presence
in the league, that he can handle
being outsized. Plus, Rodman can
also take Kemp out of his game if
the Sonic All-Star is constantly
worried about keeping Rodman off
the boards.
For the first time in three years,
this series will not be dominated by
a center. The clash between Chica
go's Luc Longley and Seattle's
Earvin Johnson is hardly a block
buster. Both of the teams practice
the center-by-committee philoso
phy, and thus, the series will fea
ture a number of unconventional
big men. Of them, however, Long
ley is the most traditional and has
shown flashes of offensive produc
tivity in both the playoffs and
against Western Conference teams
with small centers. Against Seattle
in November, Longley went for 21
points and eight boards.
The Sonics at times will bring
out their small lineup, with Sam
Perkins at center, and the Bulls
would like nothing more than for

that to happen. Coach of the Year
Phil Jackson then responds with
Toni Kukoc and swings Rodman to
center. With this lineup, the Bulls
will put on their full court press,
force turnovers and get out into the
open court, where Jordan, Pippen
and Kukoc are at their best.
Speaking of Kukoc, the Bulls bench
has a decisive edge over the Seattle
reserves. Jackson, a master with
role players, has gotten consider
able contributions from anyone
from Bill Wennington to Jud
Buecheler to Randy Brown. The
Bulls bench is averaging nearly 30
points a game to Seattle's 23.9.
Jackson also has a considerable
edge over Seattle coach George
Karl, who thinks winning a first
round series is getting a monkey off
his back. Wait till the gorilla known
as Losing in the Finals hops on
George.
Watch for Seattle to look good
early in Game 1. The Bulls are
rusty after long layoffs, and nine
days is considerably longer than
even the All-Star break. Seattle, on
the other hand, will have the mo
mentum of a game-seven victory.
Jordan and the Bulls have the ex
perience to hang around early,
though, and the Finals jitters will
be a factor for the inexperienced
Sonics. The Bulls should take the
series opener.
The Bulls have lost a game at
home in the Finals against both the
Lakers in '91 and the Trailblazers
in '92. The Sonics may make a push
in Game 2, but Jackson should be
able + o coach his way through for a
win.
The Bulls have once again
proven themselves the best road
team in the league, and in their
three Finals appearances, the Bulls
have been more dangerous away
from Chicago, a crucial factor in the
new 2-3-2 series format. Against
the Lakers, the Bulls swept the
three games at the Forum to clinch
in Game 5. They won two of three
in Portland and won three times in
Phoenix in '93, twice to open the se
ries and once to end it.
More than anything, however,
the Bulls have Michael. In addition
to his points and defense and every
thing else, Jordan will not let the
Bulls lose. Besides, he won the All-
Star Game MVP and the regular
season MVP, so there is just one
trophy left.
Translation: Seattle, the game is
up. Bulls in 5.
