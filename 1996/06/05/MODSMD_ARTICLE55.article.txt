# BOWSER bow wow wow

### Story graphic by Mike Noren 
I open my interview with Bowser
singer I guitarist Andy Harp with a
question about his mustache. You
see, mustaches aren't very common in
punk rock, especially mustaches so pro
nounced and sculpted as 1 farp's.
"1 don't know,"he responds with a slight
laugh. "I know there was a guy in the Fall
with a mustache at one time, if you count
the l all as punk... But yeah, you don't see
many mustaches lately, I guess. Not in
music, at least. Maybe we'll revive them."
Harp's modest humor comes as a
pleasant surprise, considering his
group's relatively stoic and slightly
mean brand of rock. Along with
bassist / organ player Tim Quince and
drummer David Bradson, Portland's
Bowser specialize in running repetitive
grooves into the ground, enveloping them
in swirls of noise and distorted vocals. It
makes for a disorienting listen — with its
uneasy vibe more than compensating for
its lack of distinct melody. Harp reluctant
ly calls it "sort of trance-punk," but Bowser
defy labels.
"1 started playing guitar when I was like
14," Harp explains. "It would always seem
like the sounds I'd make by acciuent were
more interesting than the ones I'd do on
purpose."
About three years ago, Harp bought a
cheap four-track recorder and began mak
ing music by himself. His early tapes were
"really pretty bad," he says, but when he
started playing with friends, they became
more exciting. Harp formed multiple little
"bands," but it was the current Bowser line
up that finally clicked.

The group began writing songs and
playing small shows, self-releasing their
first single, the anthemic "Cracked," in
1993.1 )espite its generally positive reviews,
Harp seems slightly embarrassed ot the
track: "It seems sort of generic-sounding to
me now, like pretty straightforward and
Ramones-ish ... I think we've come to
gether a lot since then, and we can do a lot
of different things. So I guess it's always
weird to hear your first stuff again."
Still, "Cracked" hinted at good things to
come. Its entrancing organ part distin
guished it from other bitter punk rants, and
I larp's nasal delivery was enjoyably unique.
But it wasn't until earlier this year that the
track's promise was fully realized. Bowser's
debut album, "Meat Pie," showsa more ma
ture take on punk — one that allows
sounds to expand and contract for an in
triguing atmospheric hum.
"This record is mainly a product of just
playing together," Harp says. "We'd had
time to know how each other work and
what might sound good coming from each
person. But we intentionally didn't want it
to be too planned-out or rehearsed ... I
guess we figure things are freshest right off
the bat, and so that's how we'll make the
most exciting recording, to just go in and
throw out our ideas and see what happens.
"So |the record] is surprising in that
sense," he says."And still it's just us having
fun."
It's that last statement that comes as a
surprise. With barked, VON-LMO-in
spired lyrics like "Fluctuation / Regurgita
tion / Desecration / Elimination" and
"Throw it away/Throw it away / Go
away / Fuck you," Bowser's sound seems

more linked to bitter tension than to fun.
"Really, we like to have fun with the
lyrics," Harp says. "We're not really totally
serious about things very often ... A lot of
those lyrics would just make us laugh, and
so we'd put them in. But then when we get
more used to them and adjusted to them,
we maybe start taking them more seriously
and packing them with a little more feeling
or something.
"We don't usually hope that people take
our songs literally," he continues. "Really
it's just stuff we make up."
M IV/I eat Pie" is a stirring debut. Six
ly I teen tracks of expansive ex-
I perimental punk, the album is
an imposing listen. From the straight
ahead tirade of "Explanation" (which bears
a strange resemblance to Steve Miller's "Fly
l ike an F.agle") to the sarcastic dribble of
"Shitpile Shit pile," Bowser have found their
niche. But Harp makes it clear that he
doesn't plan to stay in that niche.
"I don't really think we really exist as a
'band' so much as just as a bunch of ideas,"
he says."I never want to develop a 'Bowser
sound' or anything consistent or expected
or usual. We all likelotsof different kinds of
music and so I think we'll always be inter
ested in playing different sorts of things...
I see no reason why the stuff we put out this
year or the stuff we put out next year should
have any impact on what we do two, three
or 10 years from now."
In fact, Harp plainly states that he
doesn't expect Bowser to stay together for
very long. "I figure when we start repeating
ourselves, we're wasting our time and we're
wasting everybody's time," he savs. "I don't

think we'd ever hesitate to [break up)."
Essentially, Harp just wants to maintain
his creative freedom. Harp's own favorite
groups (he hesitates to call them "influ
ences") area varied bunch, reflecting a mu
sical vision far more varied than even
Bowser's "Meat Pie" would suggest. From
the top of his head, Harp eagerly mentions
that he loves the 13-piece country-flavored
group Lambchop, the more techno/jun
gle stuff like Goldie, the Modern Lovers'
first album and Lou Reed.
It's this wide range of interest and will to
explore that ensures a healthy future for the
members of Bowser. A stubborn indepen
dence is at the center of their art, so much
so that the spoken-word conclusion to
"Meat Pie," while deeply sarcastic, still rings
true.
"We now leave you with a traditional
American song-poem," says Harp on the
album's unlisted 17th track. He proceeds to
recite an excerpt from Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow's "What the Heart of the Young
Man Said to the Psalmist."
"In the world's broad field of battle,
In the bivouac of Life,
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
Be a hero in the strife!
Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!
Let the Dead Past bury its dead!
Act — act in the glorious Present!
Heart within, and God o'er head!
Lives of great men all remind us
We can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
Footsteps on the sands of time."
