## Palatable Porn at the English Palace

Interested in porn?
Got a yen for whip
ping men?
You might want to
check out a web site
called "The English
Palace." The English
Palace, a site that be
longs to the contro
versial genre known as
"cyberporn," is a pri
marily S&M-oriented
attraction that, for a
fee, allows its mem-

hers to, ahem, interact with each other.
The strange thing about "The English
Palace" is that, unlike your run of the mill
"Feel free to download, Studboy" non-inter
active picture warehouses, it's not boring; and
unlike your blond spread-eagle-with-a-Bea
gle on a couch, it's done with a modicum of
taste. In short, not all porn is created equal.
The main attraction of the palace is a chat
room for "dominants" and "submissives"
that allows for exploration of personal fan

tasies, including some interesting variations
on "spanky spanky." The palace encourages
participation of both experienced and inex
perienced members — equal opportunity
S&M, if you will.
In addition to cyber-sex play, the palace
has a forum where people may post their
thoughts on issues traversing the sexual spec
trum — fishnet fetishism included. The site
also contains a catalogue of magazines (from
"Spit" to "Swallow"), personal ads (that range
from couples seeking twins to transvestite
Labradors) and erotic wear (Japanese clover
tit clamps were just on sale).
This chronicle of epicurean optionry may
hardly seem tasteful at first — some people
find Japanese clover tit clamps off-putting,
sale or no sale. However, the palace strives
within the confines of its salacious cyber
walls to impose a polite system of interaction.
This is achieved in part by the watchful eye
of the "Master Charles,"the chat room's
guardian who politely yet firmly enforces
palace etiquette. Included in his etiquette are
two pages devoted to rules for dominants and
submissives, espousing such tips as "Be sensi
tive. There's a verv fine line between a sensi

tive, caring dominant and a self-righteous,
insensitive overhearing clod."
Of course, no matter how proprietors the
protocol imposed on its proprietors, the palace
is dealing with subjects some find distasteful.
Some may even substitute "offensive" for dis
tasteful and still others object to pornography
in whatever form it, ahem, arises.
In fact, the issue of pornography is far
older than the Internet, yet humanity's an
cient vice was one of the first things to capi
talize on this new medium. The facility with
which porn producers stayed abreast of new
technology is shown amply through such ad
vertisements as "Give me a call on your
modem and I'll keep you ... cumming!"
Because of its controversial nature, mas
sive proliferation and the availability of porn
sites to underage users, there arc legal issues
that need to be addressed concerning
pornography on the Internet. However, my
purpose in showcasing the palace is to
demonstrate that not all of what we may term
web pornography involves the furtive down
loading ofdebbie.wet.jpg when no one else is
in the computer cluster.
For one thing, the palace is exclusive be

cause its members pay a fee, and no minors
are allowed. For another, members have re
course to an arbiter it' they have an uncom
fortable experience and members can he ex
pelled at any time. Palace players are also
anonymous, interacting under such names as
"Mistress Sapphire" and "Spankman." Such
an atmosphere creates a feeling of respect and
sanctions exploration in the enormously var
ied world of sexuality.
An S&M chat room may not immediately
come to mind as a good pilot for healthy sex
ual expression on the Internet, hut the palace
acknowledges that sexuality is a varied and
complicated topic that should he approached
with acceptance. The world's newest medium
may have other good resources for safe sexual
exploration that should not be automatically
discarded because they deal with sex.
People such as Master Charles have made a
laudable effort to build a forum for those with
specific sexual tastes in a secure environment.
Instead of wrinkling our noses, perhaps we
should be more sensitive. Don't forget,
"there's a very fine line between a sensitive,
caring dominant and a self-righteous, insen
sitive overbearing clod."
