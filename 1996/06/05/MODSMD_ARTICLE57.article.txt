# Richter's box set — low quality recording, high quality listen
## 
### William Hsieh 
If there is ever a box set of piano music
that makes me bang my head against the wall
for more superlatives than one can ever find,
this is it.
And if I could quote what Schumann e\
claimed upon hearing the young Brahms al
most 150 years ago, I would likewise pro
claim "Mats off, ladies and gentlemen, lor the
genius before our eyes' alter listening to this
1 ()-( 1) box set.
For decades, Sviatoslav Richter has
reigned supreme at the keyboard, \ftcr his
belated debut in the West, Richter has stead
fasth conquered audiences everywhere \\ ith
his colossal virtuosity, passionate tempera
mcnt and penetrating insight. Yet much to
the chagrin of piano-philes, he loathes
recording studios and refuses to flv (It's
been 20 years since America last heard him
in concert.) Instead, he enjoys long train
rides and prefers playing in tucked away vil
I ages across I mope, often announcing con
certs as well .is programs only days before
the performances. Not surprisingly, there is
an enormous market for pirate recordings
of Richter. At some point, these illegal
copies actually outnumbered the official
ones in circulation, prompting record com
panies like Philips to release materials never
before available in an attempt to collect due
royalties. BMC, in collaboration with the
Russian Melodia, is following suit in pre
senting this box set containing mostly live
recordings of Richter in his prime in the
1950s and '60s.
The sheer range of Richter's repertoire is
astounding, to say the least. The box set con
tains a mere fraction of his working reper
toire, yet we find in it a bulk of mainstream
works as well as lesser known gems, among
them Rimsky-Korsakov's and Clazunov's
piano concertos. Some of the work, such as
the Schumann "FantasiestUcke", the
Beethoven "Appassionata" Sonata, and the
Mussorgsky "Pictures at an Exhibition" have
become a decidedly Richter staple. Others

like the Miaskovsk\ "Sonata" and Chopin's
"Second (.oncerto" have onl\ enjoyed a fleet
ing spotlight in his long career. Yet whatever
piece he plays, it imparts an unmistakable
Richter persona that immediately sets him
apart from all other pianists. One only needs
to listen .1 leu bars into the pieces to tell who
is at the helm.
Indeed, one is immediately struck by the
intensity and concentration of Richter's in
terpretations. I ew pianists today are en
dowed with such a sense of locus and direc
tion, qualities necessary to weave seemingly
unrelated parts into a monolithic whole.
Richter's playing is marked by a relentless
forwardness that pulls the audience into
guessing what's coming next. I lis "Appas
sionata" is an air-tight drama seething with
white hot intensity and ending in a near-hys
terical coda. The Saint Saens "1 -ifth I'iano
(. oncerto" \ ibrates with exotic rhythms and
an irresistible drive. Most notable is his Mus
sorgsky "Pictures at an Inhibition", where
flights of fantasy and sarcasm take off along
with an outburst of demonic virtuosity.
A master of grand gesture, Richter is no
less exquisite in more introverted works.
Richter's Schumann is at once poetic and
whimsical, vividly capturing the I lorestan
the 1 usebius side of Schumann. The "Fan
tasies! ucke" evokes stories of tender lyricism
and stormy passion while the"! lumoresque"
pulsates with mischief and caprice. The
Franck "Fes Djinns" and "Preludes, Choral
and Fugue" glow with a religious aura, cap
ping a torrent of demonic energy waiting to
explode.
Unlike supreme colorists such as
1 lorowitz or Michelangeli who captivate and
amaze through their range of tonal palette,
Richter opts to engage his audience by his
unique vision and depth of insight in his in
terpretations. The Chopin "Second Concer
to" has a rare conviction and pristine sparkle
(especially in the Finale movement) that
bring out all the youthful charms of the

work. I here may he more romantic and
suave playings around, hut nothing rivals
Richter's fervor and self-assurance in this
piece. Richter possesses such a rare gilt ol
rhetoric that even listeners who don't agree
with his interpretations are swept away hv
the sheer force of Ins argument. Yet he re
mains acutely sympathetic to the idioms of
the composers. Under his hands, the Bartok
"15 Hungarian Peasant Songs becomes a
rural bazaar full ol country flair, so simplistic
are his phrasings.
Richter's Russian upbringing definitely
gives him an extra edge in interpreting
music of his homeland. Ihe two Rach
maninoff "Piano (Concertos are character
ized by ardent fervor and romantic sweep.
His Prokofiev "Sonata N0.7" is a monu
ment of intensity and persuasion towering
with those of Horowitz and Argerich as the
foremost renditions on records. Richter
weaves the ever-elusive Scriabin etudes into

an organic whole
while losing none
of the mysticism
and sensuality in
Sen ah ins music.
I veil the
T c h a ik o v sky
"(■rand Sonata",
which often sounds
disjointed in less
skilled hands, re
gains its splendor
and nobility under
Ri chter's com
mand.
If the musical
quality ofthe box set
is an unparalleled
triumph, the sonic
quality is a sheer fi
asco. The Soviet-era
recordings have long
been notorious for
the sterile, clanky
and even filtered
sound. Despite
BMG's rescue efforts
using state ofthe art
modern equipment,
the overall sound
quality still leaves
much to be desired.
It's sad that a coun
try boasting of the
best space scientists
had no competent
recording engineers
to do Richter justice.
Listening to Richter's

great playing through such medium is much
like gazing at Picasso's masterpiece on a piece
of toilet paper.
Last but not least, all the CD booklets in
the box set are refreshingly informative, of
fering not only pertinent background histo
ry of the repertoire but also intriguing ac
counts of Richter's personal opinions on fel
low pianists, including Argerich, Gould and
Horowitz.
Along with Philip s 22-CD set and Praga s
15-CD set, this collection marks the third
box set of Richter's recordings, a must tor
avid Richter fans and piano aficionados. l or
the less discerning or novice Richter collcc
tors, liis various recordings on Philips (Liszt s
C Concertos, the Beethoven Cello Sonatas with
Rostropovich,etc.) ,0111) C( Rachmaninoff's
Second Concerto, Schumann's Walds/enen
and 011 1 MI (Schumann's fantasy) are good
starters. At least they were not recorded bv
the Russian engineers.
