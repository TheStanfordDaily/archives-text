I lie Stanford Art Museum may be closed
indefinitely, but you can still be exposed
to fine art on campus. The Stanford Art
■y is holding the 1996 Masters of Fine
Arts Exhibition until June 16, featuring works
by Colin Beatty, Rebecca Hackemann, Diana
Kunce, Andi Nufer and Jim Vecchi. In addi
tion, Beatty, Kunce and Nufer have outdoor
installations located throughout campus.
skinning science
At first glance, parts of the gallery may look
like a natural history museum. The center
room is dominated by three sculptures of ani
mals — a bison and two large cats — in glass
cases. In another glass case is a row of skulls,
and on a wall, a series of sculptured beaks
evocative of a textbook illustration of

Darwin's finches. These works by Colin
Beattv dramatize the synthesis of science
and art into cultural expression.
Beattv, who has a background in /ool
ogy, draws inspiration from both natural
history dioramas and ecosystem con
structs within a laboratory setting. His
outdoor installation "l ish Blind" is par
ticularly influenced by limnology, the
study of freshwater ecosystems.
"A goal of mine in some aspects," says
Beatty, "is to make people look at the ele
ments or the structure of science in a dif
ferent way."
Beatty s metaphorical use of scientific
tools is evident in several of his works, in
cluding "The Blue Room." He describes
"The Hunt," in which a glass-encased
bison is forever frozen between the two

cats made out of wood and twine, as "skinning
science."
Another sculpture, "Science Cargo Ships,"
consists of three wooden boats navigating
across the floor of the gallery. Beatty says that
this work indicates his "mythical science just
embarking, just about to graduate, just about
to enter the world."
Beatty also has two outdoor installations
that further his representation of scientific
thinking: "Bird Catcher," located on the front
lawn of Cummings Art Building, and "Fish
Blind," located in Dohrmann Grove adjacent
to the gallery. A third, "Frog Fitter," will be
erected in the near future behind the Environ
mental Safety Facilities on Stockfarm Road; it
will remain available for viewing after the ex
hibition closes on June 16.
earth/body/sky
Andi Nufer's work, which incorporates
paintings, drawings and diverse objects, plays
with several levels that often give rise to cre
ation and inspiration.
Two layers she works with are the earth and
sky, such as in "Nut and Geb, 112 and me" —
which is not only a painting, but an entire
space. The title refers to the Egyptian myth of
Nut, the sky goddess, and her brother, Geb, the
earth god. The (wo were once in sexual union
hut are now separated; this is represented by
the sky god between them in the painting, and
the physical space in front of them.
The buttons on this floor space could he
representative of seeds, semen, tears, milk or
other fluids related to the earth and fertility.

The extension of the buttons, Nufer says, is
"evidence of this pictogram in physical space,
our space; in real time, not mythological
time."
Nufer says that a triple construct that fasci
nates her is the earth, the human or the body,
and a notion of god. "I'm especially interested
in god as goddess and earth as god," she adds.
In concert with her depiction of mytholog
ical ideas and childhood events is a sexuality
that comes with being close to the earth — a
divine / human sexuality.
Nufer's installation "om / phallus," located
in the wooded area between the Oval and the
Business School, embodies that idea. The in
stallation, which includes a life-sized bed
within a nest of branches, and a veil of curtains

upon which hundreds of buttons are sewn, has
many references to the body.
The title is derived from the Greek word
"omphalos," which means "navel." In this con
text, the first syllable becomes a cosmic word
— such as "Mother," suggests Nufer — and
the second and third similar to "phallus." To
gether, "om / phalus" means "navel of the uni
verse."
Entering the ring involves stepping be
tween two trees, passing through a door and
penetrating a curtain of fur. Our ability to
physically enter the installation is like stepping
into a different space, or onto a different level
of existence.
this space
The spaces that Diana Kunce's sewn fabric
structures occupy or form have distinctly fem
inist sentiment. "Storage," which covers one
wall, resembles hoopskirts twisted into shapes
behind plastic sheeting. "Belly," which consists
of a row of garments whose stomachs grow
progressively larger, curves around the instal
lation "Detach."
The latter two works occupy the back room
of the gallery; together, they convey a mood
suggestive of the body's lingering presence in a
space that can be both abstract and concrete.
"Detach" incorporates panels of fabric that
form a box. On the panels, charcoal drawings
overlaid with stitched words create a pattern
whose circularity is reflected in the different
ways one can interpret the sentences or ques
tions formed by the words. Depending on

which word you begin with, the text constant
ly redefines the idea of distance. At times, the
distance can also lead to a sense of personal
vulnerability.
A revolving light that illuminates the im
ages on the panels in "Detach" creates shad
ows that suggest absence and presence at dis
crete moments. I'he light emphasizes the dis
tance between images and words; it can both
span them, and divide them with darkness.
A background in art direction on films and
theatrical productions influences Kunce's
work; namely, her exploration of the historical
images of gender.
Kunce also has an installation, created in
collaboration with Nina Fussing and James
Page, located outside the (ireen Earth Sciences

Building. Entitled "Dialogue," it is <1 20 x 10
foot structure made out of'steel and white fab
ric, and contains a copper pendulum. The in
stallation also uses video projection that runs
weekday evenings from 8:30 to 10:00 p.m.
seeing-eye pieces
Viewing Rebecca Hackemann's photogra
phy involves a kind of visual perception that
may be different from what you're used to.
Objects may pop out at you, or be accompa
nied by unusual sounds. But whether they're
incorporated into books or stereoscopic
boxes, these combinations of photographs
and other materials create an intensely viscer
al experience.
Hackemann's three books, "The Ideal Sight
Restorer," "The Autopsy of an Historian" and
"The Incredible Hysteryofthe Artists," are not
your normal volumes. When you open them,
strains of music or a scream might slip out.
Other materials that are used to create inter
esting visual as well as tactile textures are
toothpicks, dental floss, cotton wool, hair, eye
lashes and the skin and eyeballs of animals.
Handling with gloves is advised.
At the same time, a sense of history is
evoked through the fine brittleness of the
books' pages and their images; which despite
their oddities, are constructed in a way that is
reminiscent of 19th-century medical text
books and 19505-style icons.
The photo-montages within these books,
often composed of biological bits and pieces,
are accompanied by short, satirical state-

ments. Especially in the case of "The Ideal
Sight Restorer," the text and the pictures play
with the idea of looking at things in startling
and often whimsical ways.
Hackemann also uses stereophotography
to create a different method of looking at
things. Her three stereoscopic boxes, "The
Decay of Lying," "Untitled" and"The Art Crit
ics" operate on the principle of two eyepieces
that give images a three-dimensional perspec
tive.
Within these boxes are scenes that can be
macabre yet humorous, such as strung-up
dolls' heads in"The Art Critics" that are
viewed in three-dimensions, courtesy of the
stereoscopic lens. These different ways of
viewing can add an edge to your sight.

hidden faces
Jim Vecchi's photographs, collective
ly entitled "Shadows of My Self," incorpo
rate layers of both form and color. Within
these layers emerge faces — from paint
ings, photographs, dolls and sculptures
— that all have an eerily human quality.
Technically, the distortions were
achieved through photographing images
through the glass of storefront windows.
The result is a swirl of elements that make
it ambiguous whether the viewer is look
ing within or looking without.
"We're always looking through these
layers of our concept uaJ ideas of the world
— what we've been taught, our language
that really separate ourselves from oth
ers," says Vecchi. "We're always veiling
ourselves to the world." At the same time,

Vccchi adds, "The world is always looking at us
through layers."
This method of looking can be taken from
another angle when applied to the self and be
yond.
The title "Shadows of My Self," says Vecchi,
"evokes aspects of all of us; myself in the sense
of a universal self, that we have all these differ
ent parts — male / female, young / old — that
we have repressed or kept hidden to our
selves." These selves become apparent through
the "human faces" peering through the layers
of meaning and colors in the photographs.
The concept of lifting these layers has per
sonal import for Vecchi, who feels that "We al
ways have these parts of ourselves that we have
veiled and covered up and don't acknowl
edge," and that when they are acknowledged
"we're healthier and more whole."
The haunting quality of these "human"
faces engage the viewer on an intellectual and
emotional level. Vecchi hopes that his pho
tographs will allow viewers to "click on some
thing about themselves."
By employing unusual methods of per
spective, by finding inspiration and achieving
realization, this exhibition may create differ
ent ways of looking at ourselves.

to enter the world."
Beatty also has two outdoor installations
that further his representation of scientific
thinking: "Bird Catcher," located on the front
lawn of Cummings Art Building, and "Fish
Blind," located in Dohrmann Grove adjacent
to the gallery. A third, "Frog Fitter," will be
erected in the near future behind the Environ
mental Safety Facilities on Stockfarm Road; it
will remain available for viewing after the ex
hibition closes on June 16.
earth/body/sky
Andi Nufer's work, which incorporates
paintings, drawings and diverse objects, plays
with several levels that often give rise to cre
ation and inspiration.
Two layers she works with are the earth and
sky, such as in "Nut and Geb, 112 and me" —
which is not only a painting, but an entire
space. The title refers to the Egyptian myth of
Nut, the sky goddess, and her brother, Geb, the
earth god. The (wo were once in sexual union
hut are now separated; this is represented by
the sky god between them in the painting, and
the physical space in front of them.
The buttons on this floor space could he
representative of seeds, semen, tears, milk or
other fluids related to the earth and fertility.

The extension of the buttons, Nufer says, is
"evidence of this pictogram in physical space,
our space; in real time, not mythological
time."
Nufer says that a triple construct that fasci
nates her is the earth, the human or the body,
and a notion of god. "I'm especially interested
in god as goddess and earth as god," she adds.
In concert with her depiction of mytholog
ical ideas and childhood events is a sexuality
that comes with being close to the earth — a
divine / human sexuality.
Nufer's installation "om / phallus," located
in the wooded area between the Oval and the
Business School, embodies that idea. The in
stallation, which includes a life-sized bed
within a nest of branches, and a veil of curtains

upon which hundreds of buttons are sewn, has
many references to the body.
The title is derived from the Greek word
"omphalos," which means "navel." In this con
text, the first syllable becomes a cosmic word
— such as "Mother," suggests Nufer — and
the second and third similar to "phallus." To
gether, "om / phalus" means "navel of the uni
verse."
Entering the ring involves stepping be
tween two trees, passing through a door and
penetrating a curtain of fur. Our ability to
physically enter the installation is like stepping
into a different space, or onto a different level
of existence.
this space
The spaces that Diana Kunce's sewn fabric
structures occupy or form have distinctly fem
inist sentiment. "Storage," which covers one
wall, resembles hoopskirts twisted into shapes
behind plastic sheeting. "Belly," which consists
of a row of garments whose stomachs grow
progressively larger, curves around the instal
lation "Detach."
The latter two works occupy the back room
of the gallery; together, they convey a mood
suggestive of the body's lingering presence in a
space that can be both abstract and concrete.
"Detach" incorporates panels of fabric that
form a box. On the panels, charcoal drawings
overlaid with stitched words create a pattern
whose circularity is reflected in the different
ways one can interpret the sentences or ques
tions formed by the words. Depending on

which word you begin with, the text constant
ly redefines the idea of distance. At times, the
distance can also lead to a sense of personal
vulnerability.
A revolving light that illuminates the im
ages on the panels in "Detach" creates shad
ows that suggest absence and presence at dis
crete moments. I'he light emphasizes the dis
tance between images and words; it can both
span them, and divide them with darkness.
A background in art direction on films and
theatrical productions influences Kunce's
work; namely, her exploration of the historical
images of gender.
Kunce also has an installation, created in
collaboration with Nina Fussing and James
Page, located outside the (ireen Earth Sciences

Building. Entitled "Dialogue," it is <1 20 x 10
foot structure made out of'steel and white fab
ric, and contains a copper pendulum. The in
stallation also uses video projection that runs
weekday evenings from 8:30 to 10:00 p.m.
seeing-eye pieces
Viewing Rebecca Hackemann's photogra
phy involves a kind of visual perception that
may be different from what you're used to.
Objects may pop out at you, or be accompa
nied by unusual sounds. But whether they're
incorporated into books or stereoscopic
boxes, these combinations of photographs
and other materials create an intensely viscer
al experience.
Hackemann's three books, "The Ideal Sight
Restorer," "The Autopsy of an Historian" and
"The Incredible Hysteryofthe Artists," are not
your normal volumes. When you open them,
strains of music or a scream might slip out.
Other materials that are used to create inter
esting visual as well as tactile textures are
toothpicks, dental floss, cotton wool, hair, eye
lashes and the skin and eyeballs of animals.
Handling with gloves is advised.
At the same time, a sense of history is
evoked through the fine brittleness of the
books' pages and their images; which despite
their oddities, are constructed in a way that is
reminiscent of 19th-century medical text
books and 19505-style icons.
The photo-montages within these books,
often composed of biological bits and pieces,
are accompanied by short, satirical state-

ments. Especially in the case of "The Ideal
Sight Restorer," the text and the pictures play
with the idea of looking at things in startling
and often whimsical ways.
Hackemann also uses stereophotography
to create a different method of looking at
things. Her three stereoscopic boxes, "The
Decay of Lying," "Untitled" and"The Art Crit
ics" operate on the principle of two eyepieces
that give images a three-dimensional perspec
tive.
Within these boxes are scenes that can be
macabre yet humorous, such as strung-up
dolls' heads in"The Art Critics" that are
viewed in three-dimensions, courtesy of the
stereoscopic lens. These different ways of
viewing can add an edge to your sight.

hidden faces
Jim Vecchi's photographs, collective
ly entitled "Shadows of My Self," incorpo
rate layers of both form and color. Within
these layers emerge faces — from paint
ings, photographs, dolls and sculptures
— that all have an eerily human quality.
Technically, the distortions were
achieved through photographing images
through the glass of storefront windows.
The result is a swirl of elements that make
it ambiguous whether the viewer is look
ing within or looking without.
"We're always looking through these
layers of our concept uaJ ideas of the world
— what we've been taught, our language
that really separate ourselves from oth
ers," says Vecchi. "We're always veiling
ourselves to the world." At the same time,

Vccchi adds, "The world is always looking at us
through layers."
This method of looking can be taken from
another angle when applied to the self and be
yond.
The title "Shadows of My Self," says Vecchi,
"evokes aspects of all of us; myself in the sense
of a universal self, that we have all these differ
ent parts — male / female, young / old — that
we have repressed or kept hidden to our
selves." These selves become apparent through
the "human faces" peering through the layers
of meaning and colors in the photographs.
The concept of lifting these layers has per
sonal import for Vecchi, who feels that "We al
ways have these parts of ourselves that we have
veiled and covered up and don't acknowl
edge," and that when they are acknowledged
"we're healthier and more whole."
The haunting quality of these "human"
faces engage the viewer on an intellectual and
emotional level. Vecchi hopes that his pho
tographs will allow viewers to "click on some
thing about themselves."
By employing unusual methods of per
spective, by finding inspiration and achieving
realization, this exhibition may create differ
ent ways of looking at ourselves.

I lie Stanford Art Museum may be closed
indefinitely, but you can still be exposed
to fine art on campus. The Stanford Art
■y is holding the 1996 Masters of Fine
Arts Exhibition until June 16, featuring works
by Colin Beatty, Rebecca Hackemann, Diana
Kunce, Andi Nufer and Jim Vecchi. In addi
tion, Beatty, Kunce and Nufer have outdoor
installations located throughout campus.
skinning science
At first glance, parts of the gallery may look
like a natural history museum. The center
room is dominated by three sculptures of ani
mals — a bison and two large cats — in glass
cases. In another glass case is a row of skulls,
and on a wall, a series of sculptured beaks
evocative of a textbook illustration of

Darwin's finches. These works by Colin
Beattv dramatize the synthesis of science
and art into cultural expression.
Beattv, who has a background in /ool
ogy, draws inspiration from both natural
history dioramas and ecosystem con
structs within a laboratory setting. His
outdoor installation "l ish Blind" is par
ticularly influenced by limnology, the
study of freshwater ecosystems.
"A goal of mine in some aspects," says
Beatty, "is to make people look at the ele
ments or the structure of science in a dif
ferent way."
Beatty s metaphorical use of scientific
tools is evident in several of his works, in
cluding "The Blue Room." He describes
"The Hunt," in which a glass-encased
bison is forever frozen between the two

cats made out of wood and twine, as "skinning
science."
Another sculpture, "Science Cargo Ships,"
consists of three wooden boats navigating
across the floor of the gallery. Beatty says that
this work indicates his "mythical science just
embarking, just about to graduate, just about
to enter the world."
Beatty also has two outdoor installations
that further his representation of scientific
thinking: "Bird Catcher," located on the front
lawn of Cummings Art Building, and "Fish
