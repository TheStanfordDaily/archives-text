### Story by Sam Park Graphic by Kristie Lü Stout 
Writer Commie McGovern is not
doing luncn in Hollywood
these days, but she doesn't care.
She's more to the side of the Faculty Club
than the Four Seasons, happier with the
cozy lingo of fiction writers ("craft/'
"epiphany") than screenwriters ("pitch/'
"turnarouna").

KM cGovern is a hyphenated writer in a
I VI wor where budding Chekhovs are
I lucky to claim a single title. She's writ
ten a play, three screenplays and is now con
centrating on a novel.
After some false starts (a pregnant Mc-
Govern had to cancel an interview a day he
fore giving birth), and a short interruption
three weeks later (her son Ethan, 11 pounds
and three weeks old, insisted on going on the
record about his mother), McGoverti found
time to talk about the Continuing Studies
class on screenwriting she's teaching this
summer.
"Screenplays are the most teachable genre
of all," said McGovern, speaking after putting
her son to sleep. "Scripts follow a very set for
mula that one can learn and adapt to almost
any genre one is interested in, like a thriller, a
romantic comedy or a kiddie movie," said
McGovern.
McGovern speaks with an untraceable ac
cent — like a British royal raised in Wiscon
sin. She fills her "o"s like large balloons, and
divides her syllables like continents, each re
ceiving its own body of water and very special
intonation.
To say that she talks like an actress might
hint at affectation, and McGovern is the least
likely candidate for the title. But at readings
of her short stories, in Creative Writing class
es or at the bookstore, a listener is sure to be
surprised by her comic timing and the way
the story is performed by her lips through
some magic trick.
In the late '80s, before McGovern started

focusing mainly on fiction, she worked as de
velopment director for Castle Rock (Rob
Reiner's company) in their East Coast
branch. Castle Rock was just starting out, and
it was McGovern's job to find material in New
York for potential films. That meant going to
see a lot of plays and reading a lot of books.
It also meant reading tons of screenplays,
which McGovern sees as the ideal way to
learn the trade. "By far and away that's the
best. Read any screenplay, produced or un
produced. That's how you learn," said Mc-
Govern, who has had two screenplays op
tioned by Castle Rock, Morgan Creek and in
dependent film companies.
Encouraged by her sister (the actress Eliz
abeth), McGovern wrote her first screenplay
two years out of college — a comedy about
high school misfits. "The Spelling Bee" was
optioned by actor Charles Haid, but Haid let
the option run out and the film didn't get
made. But according to McGovern, a "very
small" percentage ot optioned screenplays
actually get made. (This is a fact of life in 1 lol
lywood, where projects like "Interview with
the Vampire" can take nearly two decades to
get off the ground.)
Her second screenplay, commissioned by-
Castle Rock, was a contemporary version of
lane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" titled
"First Impressions." The project went into
"turnaround," which means that another
company could buy it from Castle Rock,
which chose not to produce it. McGovern
had no control over her screenplay's fate.
No surprise there. After all, screenwriters

usually have no say in the film's production
history, often watching their scripts get
rewritten by other writers.
"My experience wasn't so bad, but I saw
how other people were treated. Producers
often hire different writers to fix up the script
because they don't trust the original writer to
fix things up," said McGovern. "So many
hands go through it, and that dilutes the idea
and makes the final product worse."
Robert Alt man's 1992 film "The Player,"
based on screenwriter / director Michael
Tolkin's novel, is the ultimate satire on the
way screenwi iters are tossed around in Hol
lywood. McGovern remembers seeing the
film and thinking, "This is amazingly accu
rate."
"But it's also important to remember that
it's a business where you make a dispropor
tionate amount of money compared to writ
ers (in other fields]," said McGovern. "So this
is the price you pay, by losing some power
over the product and being surrounded by
people who are less respectful of craft.'"
Frustrated with the film business, McGov
ern used the money from selling her screen
plays to attend the MFA program in Creative
Writing at the University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor. There, she was able to concentrate on
fiction, eventually getting published in Red
hook, Seventeen and other magazines.
Though the switch from the more glam
orous world of film to the quieter world of
fiction may seem odd — it's usually the other
way around, a la Raymond Chandler,
William Faulkner and more recently, Paul

Rudnick — it makes perfect sense tor Mc
Govern.
"Mostly it had to do with my personality
being happier in an academic environment,
said McGovern. "My personality wasn't al
that suited for the world of Hollywood and 1
much prefer the world of fiction writing anc
the work itself."
The Jones Room, where the Stegners ham
out, is the Creative Writing headquarters
and it has been described by one journalist a>
"ugly as sin," and by one student as "kind,
sketchy." McGovern doesn't mind.
"1 much prefer a place where there's al
least a sense that people want to be togethei
and create a supportive community, a com
munity that is well-read and intelligent," sail
McGovern. "In Hollywood, there's less oi
that. It's gold that you're shooting for."
McGovern's stories focus on, in her owr
words, "contemporary women who art
losers." In one story, a young woman with <
bad job and no permanent home, house-sit*
for other people, accidentally stepping into.
love affair. In another, a highly intelligent
graduate student, frustrated by her inability
to do simple things, like bowling, become
obsessed by the activity and starts neglecting
her dissertation responsibilities.
What they have in common is McGov
em's ability to make the reader laugh anc
then break his or her heart. And very few
films out these days can make a claim foi
doing both. Hollywood may have lost .
screenwriter, but the world of fiction ha;
won a hip, '90s Shaharazad.
