Editor's note: This is the final
installment of the Real World se
ries. It is the true story of seven
freshmen picked to live in an all
frosh dorm, Junipero, and have
their lives challenged. Find out
what happens when the small
talk ends and people start get
ting real. The Real World, Stan
ford.

As the year winds down, the
Real World gang celebrates their
final week as freshmen. The past
nine months have been packed
with new experiences that come
with living in an all-frosh dorm
— Big Game spirit, San Francis

co scavenger hunts, dorm pro
gressives and Screw Your Room
mate dances. Some have been
good, some bad, but all have been
worthwhile.
"Everybody changes when
they come to college because it's
a new atmosphere with less
structure and more chances to
slack off — I'm definitely a big
ger slacker now," Grant Brown
said.
The supportive dorm atmos
phere helped students adjust to
being away from their families,
Chandra Christenson said. She
said she feels like she has
changed a great deal since com
ing to Stanford.
"I'm definitely a lot more lib
eral," said Chandra, who at
tended high school in Salt Lake
City. "At the beginning of the

saw people drinking. And I even

Six of the seven members of the Real World gang — from left to right, Joe, Kevin, Jean, Chandra,
Tasha and George — gather to reflect back one final time on the intense experiences they have all
shared over the last nine months during their freshman year.

swear now.
Jean De La Torre said she has
stayed the same over the year and
has found close friends who share
her interests.
"At the beginning of the year I
used to go out all the time," Jean
said. "I didn't drink coming into
college and I still don't. The differ
ence is that now I hang out with
people who don't drink. I don't
think I've changed fundamentally
since I've been here. ... I still
don't have a major."
Friendships often take a 180-
degree turn at some point during
the year. Roommates Kevin Chen
and Joe Freund, who had built a
strong friendship at the beginning
of the year, have since expanded
into separate circles of friends.
"At the beginning of the year,
the whole dorm hung out togeth

er," Kevin said. "Joe's a really
good guy, but we have different
circles of friends now. [Friend
ships] have a lot to do with your
sense of humor — my friends and
I laugh at the same things."
Jean and Kevin, who also once
had a close friendship at the start
of their freshman year, admitted
they have encountered some per
sonal differences.
"Things that you and your
friends find humorous, I just
wouldn't tolerate," Jean said to
Kevin. "It doesn't change the fact
that I still care about you as a per
son, but we're just more comfort
able around different kinds of peo
ple."
On some occasions, roommates
can end up as best friends, as did
Jean and her roommate.
"My roommate and I are still
very close, but we decided not to
room together again for the sake
of our friendship," Jean said.
Jean and Tasha Dwamena both
compared leaving their freshman

dorm to the end of high school.
"People say they're going to
visit everyone next year, but real
istically they won't," Tasha said.
But there's something to be
said about the friendships built
through residential education.
"I feel like every single person
I've spent time with this year has
been very important," Kevin said.
"You can learn from books and
movies . . . but people are the best
resource. I can't talk about my
grades this year, but I've learned
so much from the people in my
dorm."
Joe recalled fond memories
about his Junipero dormmates.
"I'll always remember the sec
ond [all-female] floor getting
pissed off by loud music and prop
erty damage that they usually
didn't do," he said.
Chandra also recollected many
dorm-bonding experiences.
"I remember the dorm scav
enger hunt in San Francisco —
our group went to Cal instead and

stole stuff," she said.
The year hasn't always been
fun and games, though. Some of
the Real World members attested
to learning the ropes the hard
way.
"First quarter was academical
ly a mock," Grant said. "I didn't
take some classes because I
thought I had bombed the tests.
So I went ahead and dropped the
classes without realizing that
there's this enormous curve . . .
college is tough, but everyone's in
the same boat"
George Holbert constantly
faced the familiar decision be
tween working and sleeping.
"I was always having to decide
whether to do a problem set or go
to sleep," George said. "It would
be like 2 or 3 in the morning, and I
would have to get up in a few
hours for crew practice."
Decisions that once seemed
right don't always appear that
way when looking back at them.
Joe admitted to one of his re

grets. "I wish I had gone to lecture
more, after figuring out that each
one costs about $67 — except writ
ing, which cost about $90," he
said.
Grant said he regrets having
had to take CIV.
"CIV is the biggest waste of
time; it just takes time away from
other classes," he said. "I used to
read the intros to the books so that
I'd have something to say in sec
tion, but you can basically make
up anything. They should have a
'slacker CIV' and an 'English
major CIV' and let us choose."
Kevin, on the other hand, said
he abides by a "no-regrets" motto.
Students shouldn't trust time but
live for today, he said.
"Everyone who comes to Stan
ford is pretty much a bad-ass —
they either have a talent, study
their ass off or have to win a na
tional spelling bee or something,"
Kevin said. "A lot of people are re
ally focused. Some people get up in
the morning and read their chem

book and go to bed at night read
ing their chem book. But fresh
men should enjoy themselves.
Live for the moment ... carpe
diem."
Now with her post-freshman
year expertise, Tasha offered ad
vice to incoming freshmen.
"Freshmen should be prepared
to be bombarded with all sorts of
people — people you thought
you'd like but hate, people you
thought you'd hate but like,"
Tasha said. "Expect to get that
first C and go into depression, or
that first A and go out and party.
Life is chaos."
The freshman experience is one
in million, she said.
"Living in a freshman dorm is
cool because everyone is going
through new experiences togeth
er, but at their own pace," Tasha
said. "Everyone is struggling and
supporting each other on the way.
We need to take adversity as it
comes. The whole point of college
is finding a balance."
