eople say you can tell what music
P style a band is by looking at the peo
ple who attend the concerts. If this is
the case, then by analyzing the people who
showed up lor the Possum Dixon concert at
Slim s last Saturday, you would probably say
the group's sound is a cross between I lootie
and the Blowfish, Nirvana and Iggy Pop.
The crowd was an eclectic mix of preppy,
grunge and punk. There were J. Crew
wanna-bes in their polished Rockfords,
rubbing elbows with spawns of Trent
Re/nor, who each sported a half-dozen
piercings per ear plus a nose and / or eye
brow ring for good measure.
Does this mean that ifyou take Nine Inch
Nails and smush them together with the
Rentals, Possum Dixon will emerge? No,
not quite. Their sound is one that is not
quite definable, or one that can be catego
rized by rattling off the names of other
bands as influences. As guitarist / key
boardist Robert O'Sullivan pointed out,
"We can't name the bands that have influ
enced us for fear of leaving off some other
band."
ossum Dixon has humble roots. Origi-
P rating from the Burbank / North Hol
lywood area of Los Angeles, the
group has been together for six years and
has released two full-length albums togeth
er. Lead vocalist / bassist Rob Zabrecky and
O'Sullivan have known each other since
they were two years old. Celso Chavez (gui
tar) and Byron Reynold (drums) came on

the scene when they jumped on stage dur
ing a concert by Zabrecky and O'Sullivan's
previous band. This isn't so strange — that
band actually invited people to get involved
on stage. "Possum Dixon just sort of
evolved from people who jammed with us.
Some didn't last, and those who did, well,
you're looking at them," said O'Sullivan.
Perhaps this random selection of band
members explains the stark difference in
personal style. Looking at each member
of Possum Dixon in turn, there doesn't
seem to be any superficial connections be
tween the individuals except for their love
of music and their intense dream of
"making it"in the music industry.
Zabrecky, with his intense stare, gaunt
face and slight build, casually lounged on
the recliner. Contrary to his relaxed posi
tion, there was a sense of tension about
him that was at odds with the celebratory
atmosphere in the room. Could it be that
he was annoyed at having to talk to a re
porter when all he wanted to do was to go
party with his friends? Maybe. In any case,
Zabrecky's garb consisted of a loose but
ton-down shirt, tousled hair and a calm,
sharp gaze. O'Sullivan, on the other hand,
favored a retro-look, complete with tor
toise shell glasses, a pinstripe shirt and
purpie hair. Reynolds and Chavez could
be succinctly described as "skater" and
"retro-skater"
Their personalities were also quite differ
ent, with Chavez and O'Sullivan as the out
going, talkative ones, and Reynolds and

Zabrecky both
slightly intro
verted. This
characteris
tic was very
frustrating in
Zabrecky, since
he writes the
lyrics. When
asked where he
finds the inspi
ration for the
songs, he an
swered vaguely,
"From experi
ences." But
what experi
ences? "Here
and there," he
continued.
Several
tracks on their
newest release,
"Star Maps" are
about relation
ships, and when
asked about
this, Zabrecky
again hazily an
swered, "Yes, I
suppose they're
about relation-

ships."
The other hand members were slightly
more helpful. O'Sullivan explained the logic
behind the recurring theme of stars and
space in several songs. "We're into astrology
and following the charts in the newspaper."
i le said this with a smile tugging at his lips
— so the truth factor of this tidbit is ques
tionable.
Regardless, since it is not O'Sullivan who
is writing the songs, but Zabreeky, O'Sulli
van's interpretation may or may not be cor
rect. Perhaps Zabrecky is another Paul
Westerberg, who refuses to discuss his lyrics
or motivations for writing, but wants listen
ers to interpret for themselves what the
lyrics mean.
Unlike the composition of the lyrics, the
instrumental are the result of group col
laboration. "Sometimes, Byron brings in a
piece or Robert does, and we work togeth
er to see what comes out of that," said
Chavez.
The group now works full time on their
music and no longer has to hold day jobs in
order to get by. "Nine-to-fivers just are not
our thing " said O'Sullivan. In fact, there are
a few songs that have this theme such as
"General Electric," where Zabrecky croons,
"The world doesn't know me by name / but
it knows me by number."
Under this somber mood, there is a
wacky sort of playfulness and camaraderie
the group shares. For example, there is this
one polyester shirt screened with a half
naked women in bright colors in front — a

sure remnant of the '70s — that each band
member takes turns wearing. "We gave it to
Celso to wear first, because his body shape is
the most like a woman's," shared O'Sullivan
jokingly. Indeed, ('have/ does fill out the
shirt quite well.
Are there any conflicts in the group then?
"No, never," answered Xabrecky with a
straight face. O'Sullivan clarified, "Of
course, there are conflicts. Whenever you're
in a group, conflicts are bound to arise. But
we usually work them out and go out to din
ner afterwards."
This cooperative attitude is also seen in
the way the group views success. Although
all agreed that they definitely want to "make
it, and be rich and famous, it is on their
own terms. "Money is always nice, but we
won't compromise our music for money.
We wouldn't be true to ourselves then," said
O'Sullivan.
This would make sense, because if the
group was only interested in money, they
would have finished up college and got
nine-to-five jobs with their lucrative com
puter science degrees.
But they stuck to what they've always
been interested in — music — and it's paid
off. "I've been playing the drums since I was
10 years old," said Reynolds, who is of
Japanese and Caucasian descent. "My par
ents were kind of disappointed in me, but
luckily my brother was a pre-med, and ful
filled most of their expectations for what
they wanted their son to be, so I can pretty
much do whatever I want."
Chavez, with his bachelor's degree from
UCLA in anthropology, had other career
options open. "I wrote my honors thesis on
tattoos and piercings and how this urban
phenomenon is analogous to native cul
tures. I was writing this at the time when
piercing and tattoos had not yet become
trendy," Chavez explained. But his love for
music dominated, and now Possum Dixon
is one of the top bands on the college circuit.
What are their future plans? Long term:
the group plans to stay together for some
time to come. Short term: "We'll continue
touring. Next, we'll be playing in Sacramen
to and then it's off to Seattle," said Reynolds.
A concert at Stanford perhaps? "Sure, we
would love to play Stanford, just give us the
time and date," offered Reynolds.
In the end, it does not matter that the
group does not match fashion-wise to each
other. They're not vying for a cover shot on
Vogue, after all. Their unique style has cap
tured the attention of BAM and several
other music magazines, ft has also sus
tained the interest of all types of music
lovers. Perhaps this portends a long music
lite for Possum Dixon. After all, if t hey lose
the support of the grunge crowd, there's al
ways the preps to fall back on. But for now.
Possum Dixon is satisfying everyone's mu
sical tastes.

eople say you can tell what music
P style a band is by looking at the peo
ple who attend the concerts. If this is
the case, then by analyzing the people who
showed up lor the Possum Dixon concert at
Slim s last Saturday, you would probably say
the group's sound is a cross between I lootie
and the Blowfish, Nirvana and Iggy Pop.
The crowd was an eclectic mix of preppy,
grunge and punk. There were J. Crew
wanna-bes in their polished Rockfords,
rubbing elbows with spawns of Trent
Re/nor, who each sported a half-dozen
piercings per ear plus a nose and / or eye
brow ring for good measure.
Does this mean that ifyou take Nine Inch
Nails and smush them together with the
Rentals, Possum Dixon will emerge? No,
not quite. Their sound is one that is not
quite definable, or one that can be catego
rized by rattling off the names of other
bands as influences. As guitarist / key
boardist Robert O'Sullivan pointed out,
"We can't name the bands that have influ
enced us for fear of leaving off some other
band."
ossum Dixon has humble roots. Origi-
P rating from the Burbank / North Hol
lywood area of Los Angeles, the
group has been together for six years and
has released two full-length albums togeth
er. Lead vocalist / bassist Rob Zabrecky and
O'Sullivan have known each other since
they were two years old. Celso Chavez (gui
tar) and Byron Reynold (drums) came on

the scene when they jumped on stage dur
ing a concert by Zabrecky and O'Sullivan's
previous band. This isn't so strange — that
band actually invited people to get involved
on stage. "Possum Dixon just sort of
evolved from people who jammed with us.
Some didn't last, and those who did, well,
you're looking at them," said O'Sullivan.
Perhaps this random selection of band
members explains the stark difference in
personal style. Looking at each member
of Possum Dixon in turn, there doesn't
seem to be any superficial connections be
tween the individuals except for their love
of music and their intense dream of
"making it"in the music industry.
Zabrecky, with his intense stare, gaunt
face and slight build, casually lounged on
the recliner. Contrary to his relaxed posi
tion, there was a sense of tension about
him that was at odds with the celebratory
atmosphere in the room. Could it be that
he was annoyed at having to talk to a re
porter when all he wanted to do was to go
party with his friends? Maybe. In any case,
Zabrecky's garb consisted of a loose but
ton-down shirt, tousled hair and a calm,
sharp gaze. O'Sullivan, on the other hand,
favored a retro-look, complete with tor
toise shell glasses, a pinstripe shirt and
purpie hair. Reynolds and Chavez could
be succinctly described as "skater" and
"retro-skater"
Their personalities were also quite differ
ent, with Chavez and O'Sullivan as the out
going, talkative ones, and Reynolds and

Zabrecky both
slightly intro
verted. This
characteris
tic was very
frustrating in
Zabrecky, since
he writes the
lyrics. When
asked where he
finds the inspi
ration for the
songs, he an
swered vaguely,
"From experi
ences." But
what experi
ences? "Here
and there," he
continued.
Several
tracks on their
newest release,
"Star Maps" are
about relation
ships, and when
asked about
this, Zabrecky
again hazily an
swered, "Yes, I
suppose they're
about relation-

ships."
The other hand members were slightly
more helpful. O'Sullivan explained the logic
behind the recurring theme of stars and
space in several songs. "We're into astrology
and following the charts in the newspaper."
i le said this with a smile tugging at his lips
— so the truth factor of this tidbit is ques
tionable.
Regardless, since it is not O'Sullivan who
is writing the songs, but Zabreeky, O'Sulli
van's interpretation may or may not be cor
rect. Perhaps Zabrecky is another Paul
Westerberg, who refuses to discuss his lyrics
or motivations for writing, but wants listen
ers to interpret for themselves what the
lyrics mean.
Unlike the composition of the lyrics, the
instrumental are the result of group col
laboration. "Sometimes, Byron brings in a
piece or Robert does, and we work togeth
er to see what comes out of that," said
Chavez.
The group now works full time on their
music and no longer has to hold day jobs in
order to get by. "Nine-to-fivers just are not
our thing " said O'Sullivan. In fact, there are
a few songs that have this theme such as
"General Electric," where Zabrecky croons,
"The world doesn't know me by name / but
it knows me by number."
Under this somber mood, there is a
wacky sort of playfulness and camaraderie
the group shares. For example, there is this
one polyester shirt screened with a half
naked women in bright colors in front — a

sure remnant of the '70s — that each band
member takes turns wearing. "We gave it to
Celso to wear first, because his body shape is
the most like a woman's," shared O'Sullivan
jokingly. Indeed, ('have/ does fill out the
shirt quite well.
Are there any conflicts in the group then?
"No, never," answered Xabrecky with a
straight face. O'Sullivan clarified, "Of
course, there are conflicts. Whenever you're
in a group, conflicts are bound to arise. But
we usually work them out and go out to din
ner afterwards."
This cooperative attitude is also seen in
the way the group views success. Although
all agreed that they definitely want to "make
it, and be rich and famous, it is on their
own terms. "Money is always nice, but we
won't compromise our music for money.
We wouldn't be true to ourselves then," said
O'Sullivan.
This would make sense, because if the
group was only interested in money, they
would have finished up college and got
nine-to-five jobs with their lucrative com
puter science degrees.
But they stuck to what they've always
been interested in — music — and it's paid
off. "I've been playing the drums since I was
10 years old," said Reynolds, who is of
Japanese and Caucasian descent. "My par
ents were kind of disappointed in me, but
luckily my brother was a pre-med, and ful
filled most of their expectations for what
they wanted their son to be, so I can pretty
much do whatever I want."
Chavez, with his bachelor's degree from
UCLA in anthropology, had other career
options open. "I wrote my honors thesis on
tattoos and piercings and how this urban
phenomenon is analogous to native cul
tures. I was writing this at the time when
piercing and tattoos had not yet become
trendy," Chavez explained. But his love for
music dominated, and now Possum Dixon
is one of the top bands on the college circuit.
What are their future plans? Long term:
the group plans to stay together for some
time to come. Short term: "We'll continue
touring. Next, we'll be playing in Sacramen
to and then it's off to Seattle," said Reynolds.
A concert at Stanford perhaps? "Sure, we
would love to play Stanford, just give us the
time and date," offered Reynolds.
In the end, it does not matter that the
group does not match fashion-wise to each
other. They're not vying for a cover shot on
Vogue, after all. Their unique style has cap
tured the attention of BAM and several
other music magazines, ft has also sus
tained the interest of all types of music
lovers. Perhaps this portends a long music
lite for Possum Dixon. After all, if t hey lose
the support of the grunge crowd, there's al
ways the preps to fall back on. But for now.
Possum Dixon is satisfying everyone's mu
sical tastes.
