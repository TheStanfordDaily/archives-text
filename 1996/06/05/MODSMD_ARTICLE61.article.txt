# StanfordÂ® eats: cheap
## (and close) 
### An Biernoff, Eric Hsu Ben Squire 
Every Friday night it happens. Hordes of
Stanford students, temporarily freed of the
blandeur of Food Service, percolate ott
campus and are struck by inexplicable amnesia,
abandoned by any decision-making discretion
they might once have possessed, in search of
"something different, but good" at any one of the
numerous, and unfortunately for us, dismal l'alo
Alto restaurants. Most return secretly disappoint
ed, but lie shamelessly to each other, preserving at
all costs the facade of the good life.
"Where'd you eat?"
"Jing-Jing's!"
"1 love Chinese!"
"Rad! Tell me next time you go! "
There are some excellent restaurants in the
greater Palo Alto area but they are not the ones
most students steer toward first. It's time to set the
record straight. We have some answers, and
Miyake's, Una Mas and Florentine Restaurant are
not on the list.
We spent an evening trawling the Palo Alto area
tor good, cheap, close food. I nacceptable trans
gressions included mealy fish, rice-clogged burri
tos without a speck of chile and noodles smothered
in salt. We allied in some of our favorite sources
and tested .1 lew new suggestions in the search of
the elusive, accessible, affordable, improbably deli
cious meal.
(Hir progressive dinner started at a Menlo Park
restaurant adorned by the Palo Alto Weekly read
ers poll .is the area's best Thai food. At Siam (iar
den, our meal came in reverse order, with a mango
and sticky rice dessert 1 S4 appearing first. Delec
table slices of fresh mango made an astringent and
iiik \ companion to a cake of gooey rice, sweetened
and graced with toasted coconut. A bowl oflemon
grass coconut chicken soup with prawns ($3.50)
didn't extend mucli beyond the tast v broth; it cried
out for increased lime, fresh lemongrass rather
than dried slices, and more than token appearances
by the parsley, mushrooms and prawns. Siam Gar
den's attempt at pad thai ($(->.95) brought the jury
out tor its verdict, and the news was not good. This
traditional noodle dish suffered doubly, drenched
in ketchup and lacking a sorely needed handful of
crispy bean sprouts. Fven the noodles arrived over
cooked.
Better informed Thai enthusiasts frequent Thai
City, located in a cavernous ballroom on El
Camino just south of Page Mill Road. Avoid their
equally disastrous pad thai, but you cannot lose
with green and red curries (chicken, seafood or
vegetable), any of the luminous eggplant dishes
and a dazzling version of the lemongrass chicken
soup, lovingly packed with chicken, fresh lemon
grass and galangal. Another respectable contender
is Bangkok C amine on I ytton Avenue in Palo Alto.
The soups there are tasty and filled with generous
portions of chicken, prawns and vegetables. Items
from the vegetarian menu are the real standouts.
The tofu with peanut sauce is excellent with large
pieces of tofu. The peanut sauce blends sweet and
spicy flavors with a distinct taste of ginger and is

thick enough to properly coat the tofu. Seating is
cozy, and friendly service makes Bangkok Cuisine a
more satisfying alternative to Siam Garden.
The trouble with Asian food around here is not
a dearth of restaurants, but coming by really su
perlative food at pocket change prices. While this
may not pose an obstacle to those who believe that
the worst Asian cuisine will always be better than
the best continental food, one of the hallmarks of
noodle houses, Mongolian take out, sushi bars,
Chinese bakeries, Vietnamese spring roll kitchens
and sundry other grimy, tacky Asian establish
ments is the security that, without regard to low
cost and inelegant presentation, your meal conn
with 7,000 years of unparalleled culinary histor \
behind it. Anyone can fork over a wad these days
for a dim sum feast, Korean barbecue or Chinese
banquet, but, by and large, the ethos of complex,
satisfying, yet inexpensive Asian food has gone tlu
wa\ of the rickshaw.
Nowhere is this more in evidence than Man
lord - sushi scene. Some purists are still lamentir
the fall of this art form after it emigrated across il
Pacific and was corrupted b\ the'eal-st\ le mov<
ment, of which the insipidly trendy Higashi West
constitutes the chief offender. Overlooking foi il
moment regional peculiarities, everyone should I
entitled to a box of 112 resh, reasonably priced sashimi
when the urge for something cool and
hits. As circumstances would have it, howvw
those of us on student budgets tend to be pushed
between a local Scylla and ("harvbdis: risk shellfT
poisoning for the lower-priced stuff, or shell out .1
tronomical sums to sit in a laquered, halogen-stud
eleel and naseautingly fashionable restaurant for
decent cut offish.
Due to the nature of the market, the best sushi 1
the immediate area is at best a compromise. \ftei
leaving the mock sushi at Miyake to the mobs o!
Santa Clara University students seeking exotic
thrills, and navigating past Judaiya on I ytton .tin!
Sushi ya farther down University, at the end of the
road I lakata offers decently priced sushi 111 a ci\ i
li/ed, non-obtrusive setting.
The selection of fish is adequate, with only one
of the two-piece servings nudging the S3 mark
(sweet shrimp costs $4). With conventional orders
like albacore, tuna, mackerel, yellow tail and
salmon, you get a good sized slab offish that is fresh
on all sides. A word of caution about the sauces ai
centing some hand rolls: to spice up the uninspired
flounder, the chef uses a citrus ponzu sauce that
succeeds only in tasting like chemicals. On the
other hand, the exceptional broiled eel is tied up
with a seaweed ribbon and decked out in a delicate
sweet sauce that makes for compositional harmo
ny. I he sushi chef is a large, congenial man holding
down the bar at the back of the restaurant, who
personally hands you your order as sushi was
meant to be treated.
Finding the right bowl of noodles requires a trip
to the Castro in Mountain View, where a profusion
of Asian restaurants can easily lead one astray.
