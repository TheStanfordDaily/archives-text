# Stanford® eats: cheap
## (and close) 
### An Biernoff, Eric Hsu Ben Squire 
Every Friday night it happens. Hordes of
Stanford students, temporarily freed of the
blandeur of Food Service, percolate ott
campus and are struck by inexplicable amnesia,
abandoned by any decision-making discretion
they might once have possessed, in search of
"something different, but good" at any one of the
numerous, and unfortunately for us, dismal l'alo
Alto restaurants. Most return secretly disappoint
ed, but lie shamelessly to each other, preserving at
all costs the facade of the good life.
"Where'd you eat?"
"Jing-Jing's!"
"1 love Chinese!"
"Rad! Tell me next time you go! "
There are some excellent restaurants in the
greater Palo Alto area but they are not the ones
most students steer toward first. It's time to set the
record straight. We have some answers, and
Miyake's, Una Mas and Florentine Restaurant are
not on the list.
We spent an evening trawling the Palo Alto area
tor good, cheap, close food. I nacceptable trans
gressions included mealy fish, rice-clogged burri
tos without a speck of chile and noodles smothered
in salt. We allied in some of our favorite sources
and tested .1 lew new suggestions in the search of
the elusive, accessible, affordable, improbably deli
cious meal.
(Hir progressive dinner started at a Menlo Park
restaurant adorned by the Palo Alto Weekly read
ers poll .is the area's best Thai food. At Siam (iar
den, our meal came in reverse order, with a mango
and sticky rice dessert 1 S4 appearing first. Delec
table slices of fresh mango made an astringent and
iiik \ companion to a cake of gooey rice, sweetened
and graced with toasted coconut. A bowl oflemon
grass coconut chicken soup with prawns ($3.50)
didn't extend mucli beyond the tast v broth; it cried
out for increased lime, fresh lemongrass rather
than dried slices, and more than token appearances
by the parsley, mushrooms and prawns. Siam Gar
den's attempt at pad thai ($(->.95) brought the jury
out tor its verdict, and the news was not good. This
traditional noodle dish suffered doubly, drenched
in ketchup and lacking a sorely needed handful of
crispy bean sprouts. Fven the noodles arrived over
cooked.
Better informed Thai enthusiasts frequent Thai
City, located in a cavernous ballroom on El
Camino just south of Page Mill Road. Avoid their
equally disastrous pad thai, but you cannot lose
with green and red curries (chicken, seafood or
vegetable), any of the luminous eggplant dishes
and a dazzling version of the lemongrass chicken
soup, lovingly packed with chicken, fresh lemon
grass and galangal. Another respectable contender
is Bangkok C amine on I ytton Avenue in Palo Alto.
The soups there are tasty and filled with generous
portions of chicken, prawns and vegetables. Items
from the vegetarian menu are the real standouts.
The tofu with peanut sauce is excellent with large
pieces of tofu. The peanut sauce blends sweet and
spicy flavors with a distinct taste of ginger and is

thick enough to properly coat the tofu. Seating is
cozy, and friendly service makes Bangkok Cuisine a
more satisfying alternative to Siam Garden.
The trouble with Asian food around here is not
a dearth of restaurants, but coming by really su
perlative food at pocket change prices. While this
may not pose an obstacle to those who believe that
the worst Asian cuisine will always be better than
the best continental food, one of the hallmarks of
noodle houses, Mongolian take out, sushi bars,
Chinese bakeries, Vietnamese spring roll kitchens
and sundry other grimy, tacky Asian establish
ments is the security that, without regard to low
cost and inelegant presentation, your meal conn
with 7,000 years of unparalleled culinary histor \
behind it. Anyone can fork over a wad these days
for a dim sum feast, Korean barbecue or Chinese
banquet, but, by and large, the ethos of complex,
satisfying, yet inexpensive Asian food has gone tlu
wa\ of the rickshaw.
Nowhere is this more in evidence than Man
lord - sushi scene. Some purists are still lamentir
the fall of this art form after it emigrated across il
Pacific and was corrupted b\ the'eal-st\ le mov<
ment, of which the insipidly trendy Higashi West
constitutes the chief offender. Overlooking foi il
moment regional peculiarities, everyone should I
entitled to a box of 112 resh, reasonably priced sashimi
when the urge for something cool and
hits. As circumstances would have it, howvw
those of us on student budgets tend to be pushed
between a local Scylla and ("harvbdis: risk shellfT
poisoning for the lower-priced stuff, or shell out .1
tronomical sums to sit in a laquered, halogen-stud
eleel and naseautingly fashionable restaurant for
decent cut offish.
Due to the nature of the market, the best sushi 1
the immediate area is at best a compromise. \ftei
leaving the mock sushi at Miyake to the mobs o!
Santa Clara University students seeking exotic
thrills, and navigating past Judaiya on I ytton .tin!
Sushi ya farther down University, at the end of the
road I lakata offers decently priced sushi 111 a ci\ i
li/ed, non-obtrusive setting.
The selection of fish is adequate, with only one
of the two-piece servings nudging the S3 mark
(sweet shrimp costs $4). With conventional orders
like albacore, tuna, mackerel, yellow tail and
salmon, you get a good sized slab offish that is fresh
on all sides. A word of caution about the sauces ai
centing some hand rolls: to spice up the uninspired
flounder, the chef uses a citrus ponzu sauce that
succeeds only in tasting like chemicals. On the
other hand, the exceptional broiled eel is tied up
with a seaweed ribbon and decked out in a delicate
sweet sauce that makes for compositional harmo
ny. I he sushi chef is a large, congenial man holding
down the bar at the back of the restaurant, who
personally hands you your order as sushi was
meant to be treated.
Finding the right bowl of noodles requires a trip
to the Castro in Mountain View, where a profusion
of Asian restaurants can easily lead one astray.
Forego the lung Kee Noodle House, a thinly veiled

low quality cafeteria, as well as the other fair but
unexceptional full service Chinese restaurants dot
ting both sides of the street. At the Alma end of Cas
tro is the closet-like Chef Wang's, that displays in
neon lights a man joyfully stretching strands of
noodles. Do not be fooled by this tasteless decor, by
the end of the meal you will relish its unpreten
tiousness. Good noodles hand-pulled in the store
are a rarity anywhere outside of Hong Kong. Com
bined with a plenitude of fresh vegetables, seafood
or dumplings depending on your taste, the giant $4
bowl is one of best and best-kept secrets in town.
Our crack team of burrito-eating mavens last
sought out the most succulent chicken, the
spiciest chile and the best bargains. For the
tastiest Mexican food around we escaped from
the confines of University Avenue to the near out
skirts of Mountain View. There, in a middle class
business / residential area among low rise apart -
ments and a gas station, we found Taqueria La
Bamba, the unpolished gem of Bay Area cuisine.
The floors are cement, the patio furniture spartan
and the food unsurpassed. This charming taque
ria features a small menu and large portions. The
vegetarian burrito ($4.30 - with rice, beans, salsa,
guacamole and sour cream) is excellent, filling
and superseded only by La Bamba's sensational
meat selections. The menu provides six choices of
meat with which to fill your tacos ($1.80) or bur
ritos ($3.80-$5.10) and we were thrilled to see
that ground beef was not among them. We sam
pled three meat-filled tacos. The first was carnitas
— pork shoulder boiled until the water had en
tirely evaporated and then fried until the edges
become crispy. This meat is crunchy to the bite
yet melts wonderfully in your mouth. And La
Bamba does it better than anywhere else. The
Chile Colorado is excellent; chunks of beef are
simmered in a mild yet flavorful red chile sauce.
The polio (chicken) is marinated and cooked
until it is moist, tender and shreds apart easily. In
designating Taqueria La Bamba as the best Latin
American food (the owners are actually Salvado
rian), it is only fair to mention the runner-up, lo
cated in the same building only two doors away.
Tucked away in the back of La Costena corner
market is a small burrito bar where you can have
your burrito or taco custom- built to your speci
fications. White rice? Brown rice? Mexican Rice?
Extra guacamole, no onions, medium hot salsa
— you tell them what and how much to put on.
It's a lot to think about when you're hungry. Had
we never tried the creations at Taqueria La Bamba
we would dub La Costena the "best" burrito
place; as it is, we still live out our divided loyalties
and eat at both.
But what happens when you get back to cam
pus and you're faced with two-day old croissants
at the CoHo and a marked-up "It's It" at Tresidder
Express (a.k.a. The Company Store)? Although
there is no consistent venue for exceptional food
on campus, there are several unlikely sources for a
satisfying meal. Popular legend catapults Xanadu
House to the top of residence hall dining. To the

credit of the rumor-mongers, Xanadu's fajitas day
features impressive quantities, all competently
prepared, of chicken, beef, onions and green pep
pers. Don your Sig Ep jersey, waltz into the dining
room and pile your plate high. For the price con
scious, it doesn't get any better. Terra House,
though, is the unquestionable winner in the Best
of Campus residence sweeps: on any given day
you could be surprised by an Ethiopian feast (in
cluding home-made injera), the spiciest rellenos
anywhere, pineapple glazed pork or wild rice
casserole. For everyone who has an aversion to the
Cowell Cluster, get over it. Outside the residences,
the choices are often painful: super-greasy vege
tarian quesadillas at Stanford's own seedy Coffee
House, charred burgers at the cursed barbecue
tent or (on a special occasion) edible but unin
spired pad thai at the Psychology Building Cafe,
served on styrofoam.
The snack bar in the School of Education sells
a variety of packaged foods, from Dannon yogurt
to bagel dogs. Although the choices are undistin
guished, the agreeable staff gives you free access to
the hot water machine, breadknife, microwave
and toaster oven, for those traditionalists still
brown-bagging it. The DNA Cafe at the Medical
School, true to advertising, really does serve the
best coffee on campus — served up in sienna
saucers by the garrulous counterman, Manfred.
But it also offers calzone, quiche, panini and other
light dishes; a spinach empanada ($4), billed as
spicy, tasted of garlic, pepper and cumin, but
begged for more judicious seasoning; a chicken
pasta salad ($3.75), though, came with moist pep
pery chunks of chicken and capers. To get to the
cafe, enter the Fairchild building and go down a
flight of stairs, pass the back side of a medical lab
and when the corridor opens into a lounge
plumed by skylight and decorated with generic
potted plants, you are where you should be.
Now, there's no excuse to drop any more
money on the second-rate or the suspicious;
restaurants like Thai City, Bangkok Cuisine,
Hakata, La Costena and Taqueria La Bamba com
pensate for Palo Alto's otherwise desperate budget
dining scene. And if we catch you at Miyake, you
won't hear the end of it.
