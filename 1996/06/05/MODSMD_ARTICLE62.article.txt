## THE 						DAVE MATTHEWS BAND Crash 
### 
Although couched in minimalist rhetoric,
perhaps even drenched in academic cacoph
ony and delirious postbellum rhetoric, I con
clude this: The Dave Matthews Band rocks.
Richly in the image of "Under the Table and
Dreaming" comes "Crash," an album that
continues a tradition of well-woven musical
arrangements and superb delivery. And of
course, it feels great to listen to.
While front man Dave Matthews does lit
tle to hamper the musical energy behind
him, some of the best moments on "Crash"
come in his absence. The eclectic instrumen
talists of the band, including Boyd Tinsley
(acoustic strings) and Leroi Moore (saxa
phones, flutes and whistles), convey a sense
of vibrant enjoyment in their expression. It's
an energy that hardly seems confined to the
studio environment.
Instead of applying pop formulas that em
phasize the vocalist as the main carrier of ex
position, the other players in the Dave
Matthews Band carry just as much energy.
"Say Goodbye," a ditty about a one-night
stand with a friend, opens with the fire of
syncopatic drums and crisp flute, an inter
lude that seems better displayed in Central
Park than on disc. And few things change at
Matthews' arrival, as a flurry of little solos
and quirky variations back up his vocals.
Matthews is no slouch as a lyricist, either.
As a South African expatriate, much of his
material is concerned with the human strug
gle. "Cry Freedom" shows off his elemental
yet moving approach: "How can I turn away /
Brother-Sister go dancing through my
head / Human as to human / The future is no

place / To place your better days." On "Trip
ping Billies," Matthews' less complicated ap
proach to life's confusion continues: "1 at,
drink and be merry / lor tomorrow we die."
Even though he has drawn numerous
comparisons to the likes of Sting and Bono,
singer Matthews belongs to an entirely differ
ent category. Bluesier and more improv-ori
ented, his style is better observed as a fraction
of a whole. "Crash" is best thought of as a
group thing, one that strays from the likes of
Alanis Morissette and Hootie and the Blow
fish. The Dave Matthews Band, although
equipped with a modus operandi that is pos
sibly confusing to literati in folk musical his

tonography and pop ethnomusicology, sim
ply jam.
