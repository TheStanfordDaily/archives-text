# FLOWCHART
## Multi-Personality Tabletop Vacation 
### 
Anyone who has hoard Flowchart's 21st
century-lounge stull careen and convulse
like Stereolab in remedial school should he
able to appreciate the appropriateness of the
title "New Kadiolab-Rip-Off." Flowchart are
indeed Stereolab wanna bes and more than
ever before they've taken their cleverly
ridiculous imitation to a higher level — to
some smattering of experimental indie-pop.
l he opening track sets the tone of "Multi
Personality Tabletop Vacation" with itsspacey,
woozy intro lifted straight from Stereolab's
"Space Age Bachelor Pad" 1 P. When the singer
delivers the first lines, simply a monotonous
"ba-ba" in a lazy, dizzy voice, she cuts to the
core of the repetition that never ceases in
Flowchart s work. "New Radiolab-Rip-Otf
maintains the mood as it cranks up the ener
gy, chugging away with "Lo-Boob Oscillator
rhythms and distorted howls in the back
ground. In the context ot the vibrant ditty, the
incomprehensible lyrics shine through not
because they are strange, but because they are
strange, evocative and nonsensical.
Equally "impressive" — if you consider
blatant imitation the sincerest form of flat
tery — is "Shun to Wonder," which starts out
with some light riffage before settling into a
groove reminiscent of a sedate version of
Sonic Youth's "The Diamond Sea." Of course,
the authentic instruments that this bunch of
New Jersey teenagers uses makes "Multi-Per
sonality Tabletop Vacation a little more than
what it seems to be: a misguided yet almost
worthwhile attempt to steal the identities of
bands' with their own style.
The final track, "Do Oscillators Have

Wings," closes the album appropriately, moving
ahead in many directions at once. Flowchart
may be at its creative best when the allure of its
eccentricities doesn't overwhelm the music but,
instead, amplifies its second-hand charm.
