# VON LMO
## Red Resistor 
### 
Anyone lucky enough to have seen the
guvs of VON LMO careen and convulse
about a concert stage like the deranged
spacemen they claim to he should be able to
appreciate the honesty in "Mass Destruc
tion," at the start of their latest album "Red
Resistor." The group are indeed destructive,
and more than ever before they've taken
their relentlessly linear assault and oddly
addictive energy to a higher level — to some
strange smattering of art, sci-fi, punk,
metal, experimentation and noise.
The opening track sets the tone til "Red
Resistor" with its edgy, angry guitar work.
When I.MO delivers the lines "Mass de
struction / Mass destruction / ass destruc
tion" repeatedly in a husky, warbly voice,
lie cuts to the emotional core in a poignant
and viscerally affecting way. "Flying
Saucer 88" maintains the mood as it
cranks up the energy even more, chugging
away with violent rhythms and disorient
ed howls in the background. In the context
of the vibrant ditty, the lyrics, "We need a
blueprint for a better universe," shine
through not just because they're strange,
but because they're strange, insightful and
socially conscious. Equally impressive is
the 31-minute "X + Z 0," which starts
out with some heavy, distorted riffage be
fore settling into a shapeless groove remi
niscent of Sonic Youth's "EVOL." Of
course, the expert musicianship of this
bunch makes "Red Resistor" more than
what it merely seems to he.
"Atomic Sound" closes "Red Resistor"
appropriately, moving ahead in many direc
tions at once. The LMO crew are at their
creative best on "Atomic Sound," where the
allure of their eccentricities doesn't over
whelm the music, but, instead, further am
plifies its subtleties and unique power.
