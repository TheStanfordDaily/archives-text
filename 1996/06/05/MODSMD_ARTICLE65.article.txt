## Mirth Control 
### 
What can one say about the Leland Stan
ford Junior University Marching Hand? lust
as recognizing the Band is an essential Stan
ford experience, understanding the band re
quires almost cult-like respect. Traditional
ly irreverent institutions live within a con
tradiction, and the LSJUMB seems to love it.
However, every four years the Band sac
rifices their visual impact to record an
album, attempting to prove that they can
play too. That time is upon us again, and
"Mirth Control" is the album. Whether it
proves they can play or not, however, is an
other issue.
Truthfully, the album is solidly uneven,
mostly on the basis of the material chosen.
Taking a somewhat eclectic approach, the
album is divided between '90s punk and
relatively obscure '70s rock. As a general
rule, the material from the '90s works, and
the material from the '70s does not.
No less than three songs by Green Day
are included, and they are all snappy, tune
ful, and vibrant, which is everything they
should be. Indeed, one of the Band's great
est accomplishments must be making "Wel
come to Paradise" sound like an actual col
lege sports song. Their version could easily
be the intro for a NBC Sports college foot
ball game, a remarkable feat considering
the material is Green Day.
Other contemporary songs work quite
well. "Steam" and "No Rain" both come
close to living up their potential. "The Ob
vious Child" proves that the drum section
has some impressive chops, and"Been
Caught Stealing" succeeds in preserving the
original's organic release.
The Offspring's "Come Out and Flay," is

probably the best track on the album, sug
gesting a remote kinship between pep and
punk bands. The songs works so well it al
most outdoes the original.
As for the tracks from the '70s, little good
is to be found. Doing "Radar Love" poorly,
however, might just be impossible, and
"Livin' in the USA" is also automatic. "Lu
cretia McEvil" and "Peace of Mind" are
both pleasant surprises, but it's downhill
from there.
"Limelight" proves that the Band should
never ever do anything by Rush again.
"What is Hip?" and "Hey Big Brother" are
both wastes of space, but the album's nadir
comes with the Eagles' "Life in the Fast
Lane." A tuneless, unlistenable mess, the
song literally seems to fall apart at numer
ous times. Luckily, "Come Out and Play" is
the next track, helping one to forget this
painful experience.
Elsewhere, the "Star-Spangled Banner"
has a quite graceful arragement, and "All
Right Now" makes the album a perfect
Stanford souvenir. "Bill Tell," however, has
such pitch problems that, for all of our
sakes, I hope that the ghost of Rossini has
never visited our campus.
Overall, however, energy and enthusi
asm carry the album. Its mistakes are easily
forgivable, and its successes are just that
much more admirable. A "secret" 69th
track is even included.
Oh that darned LSJUMB. They're nuts.
