# GLOWORM
## Glimmer 
### 
Although its entire catalog runs less than
half-an-hour long, Gloworm creates some
near-timeless melodies. Brimming with
nrpttv tunrs. "(Glimmer" combines an un

derground sensibility with the sing-song
nostalgia of vintage pop from the '50s.
A collection of all of the band's seven
inches and compilation tracks, the album
gives a complete retrospective ofGloworm's
work. The ditties bear a distinctive identity,
each marked by brisk, strummy guitars and
the wistful singing of Pam Berry (whose
other notable contribution to the indie
scene is the chickfactor fan/ine). The tone
never gets tired or trite, staying pleasant
and fresh all the way through. The numer
ous covers on the album best emphasize
Gloworm's gift of expression: Gloworm
takes songs as different as the Cure's tacky
"Friday I'm in 1 ove," the tab pop standard
"Downtown" and Velocity Girl's wonder
fully noisy "Crazy Town" and recasts each
one in a style that is the band's own.
The opening track "Travelogue" estab
lishes the right mood from the start. It's the
perfect sort of song for a wandering roman
tic, with Rerrv traipsing from Paris to Italy
and Amsterdam to London, from fling to
fling. "Useless" follows up "Travelogue" on
the home front and explores the what-ifs of
a more complicated relationship — "1 won
der if you feel the way I do," Berry sings in a
sweet, tentative monotone. She plays the
third wheel better yet on "One Million
Rainy Days," biting her tongue and biding
her time in daydreams as shimmering
music comes down in a drizzle. When she
croons, "One day soon you'll lose that girl
and that's the day I'll catch your eye," Berry
steps up by backing off.
