## PALACE MUSIC Arise Therefore 
### 
Palace singer / songwriter Will Oldham
has always found beauty in the grimiest cor

ners. See, for instance, the elegant tearjerk
er titled "You Have Cum in Your Hair and
Your Dick Is Hanging Out," and it becomes
obvious. But the Palace game is usually a
more subtle one, and the new album "Arise
Therefore" rivals their best work yet.
The beauty of "Arise Therefore" is in its
understatement. Most of the songs plod
along slowly with minimal instrumenta
tion, with Oldham's cracked vocals and
gorgeous lyrics wandering through sparse
rhythms and guitar parts. Steve Alhini's
studio presence, though not as apparent as
on last year's "Viva last Blues," gives the
record a deliberate intensity, offsetting
each note with the dead silence that sur
rounds ii.
Oldham's songwriting is as strong as
ever, and here it's placed within a context
that's appropriately stark. "Stablemate" be
gins the album and sets the tone: Oldham
wonders hopelessly, "How could one ever
think anything's permanent / How can you
sleep when I'm going away,'' while his mu
sical backdrop outpaces him ever so slight
ly. The song lurches for an eerie three and a
half minutes, finding a gripping emotional
effect in its entrancing and awkward repe
tition.
"Disorder," "No Gold Digger" and"The
Weaker Soldier" (with warbled backing vo
cals from brother Ned) work similar won
ders, but it's on the hypnotic, drum-ma
chine-enhanced "Kid of Harith" that Old
ham best reveals his mission. He sings: "It
isn't an urge, it is more like a duty / To
begin to explore again things of the world /
To resaturate skin with injections of beau
ty-"
Oldham succeeds remarkably. An un
settling, uncomplicated masterpiece,
"Arise Therefore" says more by doing less -
reveling in the sad glow, as Oldham sings,
of "a small soul, perhaps, but burning
brightly."
