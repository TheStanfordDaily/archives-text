"I saw something nasty in the woodshed,"
old Ada 1 )oom repeats while her family nods
and mouths the words with her. With her,
they repeat the companion piece to that
statement, "There's always been Starkadders
in Cold Comfort Farm." With that, old Aunt
Ada has kept a tight rein on the comings and
goings ot the I arm.
Lucky for us, there's nothing nasty about
this delightful diversion from our neighbors
across the Atlantic. "Cold Comfort Farm"
takes us into a fantasy world where an or
phaned and ambitious writer can pick and
choose eccentric relatives to live with, learn
from and tidy up — Mary Poppins style.
Kate Beckinsale's Flora Poste prances cav
alierly across the screen, radiating an ingenue
quality that captivates not only the villagers
and distant relatives at the farm, but the au
dience as well. She is at the heart of this fairy
tale set in the in the picturesque Fng
lish countryside. "Robert Poste's child" has
the air ol the savior, who has come at the re
quest of her distant aunt, who feels that she
must atone lor the wrongs done against
Flora's father. We never know what those
wrongs were, but it doesn't matter as Flora
engages on a massive scheme ot events that
sets family members free, (amily members
who have long been imprisoned under the
iron fist ot old Aunt Ada.
The other characters who round out (»ld
Comfort Farm exemplify the dirtiest and
grimiest ofFnglish country folk, a stark con
trast i(> ihc gentry Hawk-Monitors who live
on the other side of town. Flora becomes a
matchmaker to her cousin Flfine and Dick
Hawk-Monitor. Although obvious class dif
ferences are glossed over, the film still works
when it allows the audience to follow Floras
goal to liberate the Starkadder family and in
ject much-needed life into their stale lives.
So much is this beckinsale's vehicle that it
might be easy to neglect the others, but that
would not do them justice. For instance, Sir
lan McKellen's Amos Starkadder is a refresh
ing ball of evangelist fire, who preaches to the
aptly named Church of the Quivering
Brethren. Flora's cousins Seth and Rueben
are also good accompaniments to this Pyg
malion comedy. The sexual tension between

Rutus Sewell's Seth and Flora is naturally de-
Hated when he finds his destiny with an im
peccably timed visit from an influential
American. The other son, Reuben, becomes
smitten with Flora, only to find love where he
least expected it. A cameo by "Absolutely
Fabulous" star Joanna Lumleyas Flora's Lon
don friend Mrs. Smiling brings the class and

acerbity of the city to the screen.
By the end, freedom is sweet. It is savored
and played out in full glory, with lots of food,
feasting and frolicking. Though you'll want
to prolong the ending, you, like the rest of
Cold Comfort Farm, will realize it's time to
move on once the fun's been had.
