# The 						Arrival
## 
### 
"The Arrival" is not a horrible movie.
At times, it appears as though it might he,
hut in reality, it's just a pathetically hland at
tempt at filmmaking.
It's so mediocre, in fact, that you can't re
ally muster up enough sentiment about to
declare it a really bad film. All you can do is
shake your head and marvel at the fact that
films like this ever get made.
"The Arrival" centers around the recently
re-popularized theme of extraterrestrial life.
Never one to leave a trend unexploited, Char
lie Sheen stars as Zane Zaminski, a hyper
paranoid scientist who tries to expose a
cover-up when he is fired for discovering ev
idence for extraterrestrial life. The (suppos
edly) exciting climax rests on the fact that
said cover-up is not merely a government-in

duced one, but rather a grand scheme or
chestrated by the indomitable aliens, who
have come to punish us for taking such bad
care of our planet.
Yes, folks, that's right, "The Arrival" is
hyper-trendy to the point of being environ
mentally conscious.
Lest we become preoccupied with the
fact that this plot is totally ludicrous, the
(so-called) screenwriter has thrown in
some inconsequential subplots to distract
us.
There's the random UCLA professor
doing research on global warming, the cute
kid-next-door sidekick and, just for good
measure, Zane's troubled but salvageable
love life.
So in terms of sheer quantity, "The Ar
rival" has plenty to offer. After all, who would
willingly forgo two hours of Charlie Sheen's
bug-eyed, husky-voiced "acting?" Further

more, there are countless (let me repeat,
countless) scenes of Sheen running through
the streets of Mexico shirtless, for those of
you who have no problem holding down re
cently-ingested food.
But in terms of quality, "The Arrival" is so
absolutely void of merit that it can't even be
considered horribly bad. It's just there, two
hours of little moving pictures and pretty
scenery.
Even for those people who are seriously
interested in the extraterrestrial life /sci
ence fiction genre, the movie isn't worth see
ing. In fact, whether or not you enjoy this
movie doesn't depend on whether you be
lieve in the possibility of otherworldly life.
"The Arrival" doesn't require a suspension
of belief.
It requires a suspension of taste.
