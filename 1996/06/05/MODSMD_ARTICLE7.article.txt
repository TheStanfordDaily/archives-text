# Wrestling coach fends off attacker
## 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
Despite being blindfolded,
bound and gagged, Stanford assis
tant wrestling coach Jay Jackson
put his wrestling skills to use to
fight off a gun-wielding attacker in
his Palo Alto apartment early Fri
day morning.
Police identified the alleged at
tacker as 31-year-old Gustavo Esla
va. Eslava had apparently been
stalking Jackson, a 1995 alumnus,
for several months, sending him
strange mail and asking for rides.
Eslava's interest in Jackson began
three years ago when he observed
Jackson showering in Encina Hall
after wrestling practice.
The incident has raised concerns
over University locker room securi
ty and the accessibility of its com
munity showers.
Eslava began cultivating a casu
al friendship with Jackson earlier
this year by claiming to live in the
same apartment complex as Jack
son. Eslava, calling himself "Tony,"
received rides from Jackson back to
the apartment complex.
"I had given him four or five
rides; he seemed like a good guy,"
Jackson said.
Eslava claimed Thursday that
he was sick and locked out of his
apartment and asked to spend the
night at Jackson's. Jackson agreed
and was awakened in the middle of
the night by Eslava, who was hold
ing a .22-caliber revolver.
Eslava tied Jackson down, bind
ing both his arms and legs, blind
folding him and at one poi nt gagging
him with a washcloth. Eslava ini
tially asked Jackson about the loca
tion of his credit cards and later said
to Jackson that he liked his shorts
and wanted him to remove them,
Jackson said.
Through the three-hour vigil,
Jackson was able to undo his hands
and attack Eslava, who was at this
point lying next to him on the lied.
Jackson said he managed to wedge
Eslava's head "between a chair and
my bed and then [II undid the blind
fold."
Using wrestling maneuvers,
Jackson gained the upper hand, de
spite beingstill bound at the feet. He
wrapped the phone cord around the
neck of the assailant and used his
free hand to call 911.
Police arrested Eslava for suspi
cion of armed robbery, burglary and
false imprisonment. He currently
remains in jail. A {xtlice visit to Esla
va's apartment off of El Camino
Real in Palo Alto revealed several
pictures of Stanford wrestlers, in
cluding a photo of Jackson.
Additionally, police discovered
rubber gloves and various articles of
clothing that Eslava removed
through the course of the night at
Jackson's apartment. Jackson said

all of his underwear is now missing.
"For the last three months, I
have been getting strange mail,"
Jackson said. "He sent me books
like 'How to Have an Orgasm,' and
'The Men's Health Book.' It was
sent through Double Day Book
Club." Eslava later admitted send
ing the mail.
Apparently, Eslava had noticed
Jackson several years ago in the
open showers in Encina. "While I
was tied up, he asked me if I remem
bered him from three years ago
when he showered at the same time
with the wrestling team," Jackson
said. Jackson had no recollection of
having seen Eslava there.
According to other members of
the wrestling team, being watched
while showering is a frequent and
uncomfortable problem.
"It happens all the time that at
Arrillaga, and even worse at Encina,
gay guys will come in and watch us
shower," said senior co-captain Tod
Surmon. "They will walk by every
10 seconds, or sometimes they are in
the shower with us, or they fondle
themselves."
"For some reason, some of
[these] perverts focus on the
wrestling team. I think that
[wrestling] is something that per
verse gay sexuality might focus on,"
he said. "It upsets me and I wish
that there is something I could do.
Unfortunately, if the person goes to
Stanford, they have every right to

stand there and stroke themselves
as I shower. It's all a fact â€” it's not
stories I made up."
The current policy restricts use
of Stanford facilities to Stanford
students, but the showers are open
and not monitored The wrestling
moved out of Encina 2 1/2
years ago to Arrillaga, which is less
accessible but not completely inac
cessible to the public.
Surmon recalled an incident last
week in which he approached a man
standing by the showers to ask him
for Stanford identification. The
man ran away before Surmon got a
chance to speak.
According to Surmon, head
coach Chris Horpel is aware of the
problem and has himself ap
proached men for identification.
Senior Associate Athletic Direc
tor Cheryl Levick commented on
the situation. "We do have ID re
quirements for use of our facilities
like the pool, the weight rooms and
the lockers, but our athletic build
ings are open du ring the same hours
as all of the other buildings. You can
get into the shower areas by walking
into the building."
"We've had no prior indication of
any problem of thus nature. We need
to get more information and move
forward accordingly," she said. "It
sounds like based on this informa
tion, we need to reevaluate our secu
rity policy regarding the shower and
investigate these concerns."
