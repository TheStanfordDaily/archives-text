## Someone Else's America 
### 
No wonder this movie was exhibited in
the 1995 (Cannes Film Festival.
"Someone Else's America" is a movie
about the American dream. However, it is
not about those of us who are already on the
sacred ladder, simultaneously fighting and
attempting to climb without losing our foot
ing. This film is about those who dare to
dream of the opportunity to attempt and
fight, it is about the people on the outside
looking in.
Sometimes it's painful to look into a mir
ror and see what you really are. A mirror
shows you exactly what you are, not what
you would like to believe yourself to be.
Someone Else's America" holds a mirror up
to the face of America and shows her that she
has two faces: one for her children and one
for the others.
"Someone Else's America" is about the
unfulfilled hopes of immigrant families that

come to the I nited States, seeking and vet
never finding. It is about their desires and
their struggles and their ultimate survival
(or demise) as thex wait for America to de
liver her promise.
We see America as distant and beautiful,
clean and pure. I hen we see the immigrant
men who made it stay that way. Paid less than
minimum wage, they do the dirty work and
cannot even get visas.
Yet the film does not portray their bitter
ness. I he men take comfort in themselves, in
their unity and laughter, in their shared
memories of home. Together they recreate
the familiar domains that they left behind.
Ihe constant yearning for familiarity
against a new and sometimes hostile back
ground is indeed a theme in this film il
lustrated perfectly by two highly different
families, one from Montenegro and the
other from Spain.
The men in both families are friends.
I hey have come to America to make their
lives better. However, what they imagined
America to be and what they actually en
countered upon arrival are two complete
ly different things. The beautiful country.

seeming so welcoming from the other
side (if the water, is lull ot disappoint
ments — and in America, the only way to
keep one's sanity is through friendship
and family.
Strong interpersonal hinds is what moves
the movie along and keeps the sadness at bay.
Not intended to he a tear jerker, the film
combats the characters' sad reality with fan
ciful imagery, beautiful i inematography and
tender, poignant (if at times slow moving)
scenes.
The struggle between old world tradition
versus the new world drive and desire to
begin anew are constantly at work. For ex
ample, upon coming to America, a blind
Spanish matriarch realizes that she hates it
and misses home. She begs her son con
stantly to lake her back, where she can be
with her stone table, her well and the smell
of the air in her country — even the fleas
that bite. However, if she attempts the trip
home, she would not survive it. Not wanti
ng to risk such a journey, her son simulates
a return to their homeland. The scene is
both moving and humorous as he seats his
mother into two rickety airplane seats and

makes her believe thev are on a plane for
home. I le even digs a two foot well to recre
ate the familiar for her. Her joy is evident
and, happy to return "home," she dies
peacefully in her son's arms.
I he scenes with the son from Montene
gro well represent the unspoken American
society. The son lies to his family and cheats
customers tor profit — all in order to join
the "survival of the fittest" rat race our coun
try has come to represent. His actions can ei
ther lead you to anger and denial — or they
can persuade you to take another look at
yourself.
This movie can really get you depressed if
you let it. Or it can get you indignant and
angry. The key to it is to look for the subtle
humor that saturates the film. There are also
scenes of friendship, happiness, music and
love — scenes necessary to drive the film's
inherent sadness away.
"Someone Else's America" is well filmed,
directed and acted, but you definitely have to
be in their right frame of mind to see it. Oth
erwise, you may insist that this mirror on
America is distorted.
