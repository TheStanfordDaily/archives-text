# Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud
## 
### 
I very once in a while, a film comes along
thai is so understated and so realistic, that its
s< ith suggestive ending leaves you breathless.
SlelU and Monsieur Arnaud" is such a film.
I mmanuelle Heart plays Nelly, a 20-
something Parisian hounded by debts.
When Monsieur Arnaud (Michel Serrault)
oilers to pay her rent, no strings attached,
Nelly is naturally reticent, though she sees it
as an opportunity to leave her lazy, unem
ployed husband.
\rnaud offers her a job typing up his
memoirs, and Nelly and M. Arnaud grow
closer through the daily contact. It soon be
comes apparent that M. Arnaud s feelings
lor Nelly are more than just friendship,
though she is dating his editor Vincent
(lean-1 lughes Anglade).
I he film's strength is its subtlety, as well
as its cast. Heart ("Manon of the Spring,"
Mission Impossible" and the teen classic
Date with an Angel") gives a flawless per
formance. I)ressed in dowdy long skirts, she
exudes a radiant beauty that is impossible to
ignore. She can do more with a look, or with
a twist of her Mick Jagger lips than most ac
tresses can do with an entire monologue.
Serrault, ("Diabolique" — the original,
l.es Cages Aux Folles") as well, is excellent
in the film as a retired judge / businessman
with a sordid past and estranged wife and
children. His love for Nelly is frustratingly
forbidden hv his advanced age, and the rage
he expresses in rare moments is unrequited
love to a "T."
lean-Hughes Anglade turns in a typically
adept performance. Emerging as a grand
giant in important French cinema, Anglade
is the typical Parisian, yet he delivers his
lines with striking originality.
Director Claude Sautct ("Un Coeur en
1 liver") has all the basics down, but the film

lacks a vibrance that could have given it
more poignancy. Paris is under-utilized
(due to budget constraints?), and because
the film is so dialogue driven, some scenery
might have moved it along.
The camera tends to love Beart, and so

will you, if you let yourself get swept away by
the sensitive, confused young woman who is
obstinate yet insecure.
What is truly moving about this picture
is its basis in reality. Everyone who has ex
perienced unrequited love (and this means

everyone) will recognize the seething frus
trations masked in everyday speech. The
univcrsalization of the world's oldest theme
is satisfying and worth seeing, even with the
subtitles.
