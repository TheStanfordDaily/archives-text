# SHS program achieves goal of $50 million in budget cuts

### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Stanford Health Services' Operations Improve
ment program — now in its seventh year — has
reached its target of $50 million in budget cuts for
1996-97, the largest single-year reduction in the pro
gram's history.
The budget reduction stems from cost cuts in a va
riety of areas, including standardization of products,
improved information systems and changes in sched
uling and billing. Assoc. SHS Director Terry Long
and Terry Anderson, manager of financial analysis,
managed the process.
"The main difference is that this is the first year
we've had three different types of groups working on
cost reduction and revenue enhancement," said Ma
linda Mitchell, SHS vice president and chief operat
ing officer."I think people were able to be much more
creative and really look at changing the way they did
things, given these three different approaches this
year."
One of the three groups worked on improving in
stitution-wide procedures, while another focused on
improving clinical services by changing physician
practice patterns and the utilization of tests and sup
plies.
Departmental staff and physicians worked in
"micro" teams on specific productivity and costs
within more traditional department budgets. As of
last Tuesday's final tally, the budget cuts came to
$52.5 million.
Cutting the budget included the elimination of 71
hospital positions, but the majority of these elimina
tions came through vacancies and re-positioning, ac
cording to Mitchell. Only 17 employees were laid off,
three of whom acted voluntarily.
"In particular, the [Operations Improvement!
process took a grander overview of the entire
process of how we take care of patients and man
age them through the Stanford Health Systems,"
said Raymond Gaeta, assistant professor of anes
thesia and medical director of the Pain Manage
ment Center. Gaeta added that the process looked
at "ways to improve the institution . . . (based on]
how it affected patient care, not solely on a cost

cutting basis."
In addition to the traditional departmental teams,
this year the program also established seven inter
disciplinary "macro" teams that dealt with broader
issues such as improving billing systems and stan
dardizing supplies throughout the institution.
"The macro process was one example of just how
well the hospital culture has grown together, because
... on the standardization team, we were actually
making cuts in other peoples' budgets," said Lou
Saksen, associate hospital director for environmen
tal and support services.
One example of product standardization is in the
frequent changes of intravenous sets, which are dis
carded and newly attached each time a patient moves
from the emergency department to the nursing unit
to the operating room. The budget-cutting process,
Saksen said, explored the possibility of an intra
venous set that could be used across different envi
ronments.
"I think the thing that makes Stanford successful
is that the process here is really driven by the clinical
and operational management, and not the financial
management," said Anderson. "The physicians were
very active in participating, which, given the fact that
they're also seeing patients, attests to how much
time they're willing to commit to this," he said.
Technology became an important theme through
many of the processes, according to Gaeta.
"Rather than thinking technology was going to be
a Band-Aid, we decided that we wanted to under
stand the processes by which patients move through
the system and let technology help in that regard,"
Gaeta said.
For instance, Gaeta said keeping medical records
on line will allow clinics access to patient information
from anywhere. Another new system, "enterprise
scheduling," will facilitate and coordinate multiple
visits for patients, Gaeta said.
Mitchell said SHS will he investing in information
systems applications that will provide for increased
use of computers in tasks now done manually.
"The real kudos goes to the management," said
Anderson, adding that the ent ire process was "a plea
sure to be involved with, and [we] really built up a
team."
