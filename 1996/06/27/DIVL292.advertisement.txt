Hey! Are you a writer of: news, opinions,
reviews, features, sports, science, or profiles?
Do you like to shoot photos, layout and edit arti
cles, or draw graphics? If the answer is yes, or
even maybe, come to an orientation session at
noon this Friday in the Weekly offices. Or just
call Joanna at 725-2100, ext. 501.
You won't regret it.
