## 
### Kristie Smith Staff writer 
With words of remembrance for Psycholo
gy Prof. Ainos Tversky from University Pres
ident Gerhard Casper, with words of grati
tude for Faculty Senate Chair Gail Mahood
from Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood, and
with words of optimism for undergraduate
advising from Vice Provost of Undergraduate
Education Ram6n Saldfvar, the 28th Faculty
Senate came to a close on June 13.
Giving the senate an update on undergrad
uate advising issues, Saldfvar — who chairs
the advising task force — announced a new
advising policy for the University that clari
fies the roles of faculty and students in the ad
vising system.
Advising students is a regular responsibil
ity for faculty, and they should l>e available
accordingly, he said. However, the student
also has the responsibility to seek help, to be
"proactive," he added.
The task force has targeted Approaching
Stanford, the magazine freshmen receive be
fore arriving on campus, as the vehicle for a
more comprehensive advising system, Saldi
var said. The new version of Approaching
Stanford helps to clarify each participant's
role in advising, including the professional and
voluntary stafT, the faculty and the students.
"To have [an advising tool] that works, you
have to continually update it," Saldivar said.
The University has also established a sum
mer advising hotline and a World Wide Web
page to help students with any questions they
might have regarding scheduling, according
to Saldivar.
Saldfvar said he also plans to create a pilot
program of advising teams in the dorms as
well as initiate an advising program for ma
jors in the fall that parallels the more exten
sive majors fair held in the spring.
In the fall, the University will begin com
pensating the head advising associates for
their work. These students oversee and coor
dinate the jxvr advising programs in dorms
for the incoming students.
"By compensating these students, I think
we will recotmize the important nature of the

work they do," Saldfvar said.
According to Saldfvar, there will also l>e a
series of pilot grants available to various de
partments throughout the University next
year to help improve advising to juniors and
seniors.
Advising is not simply leading a student
through the first and second years, Saldfvar
pointed out.
"Departments must continue to advise
even after a student has declared," he said.
In other senate business, Biological Sci
ences Prof. Pat Jones initiated a discussion
relating to the Planning and Policy Board's
recommendations on faculty retirement gli
des and emeriti status.
The bill, which passed unanimously, rec
ommends that the provost, in consultation
with the Committee on Faculty and Staff
Benefits, "undertake an examination of
emeriti arrangements across the University
to determine whether the provision of [re
sources] would ease the transition to retire
ment and compare favorably in cost with the
Faculty Retirement Incentive Program."
Philosophy Prof. Michael Bratman said an
examination of emeriti arrangements is a
good idea. The review will help to minimize
the inequalities across the University regard
ing emeriti privileges, he said.
The bill also recommends that the
provost and the committee review the effect
of the current retirement programs on the
increasing average retirement age, assess
the cost-effectiveness of the Faculty Itetire
ment Incentive Program as well as its effects
on the quality of teaching and research, and
explore alternatives to retirement. Such al
ternatives include part-time appointments,
phased retirement or restructuring appoint
ments.
According to History Prof. George Fred rick
son, the bill "meets a need" and is "a very im
portant initiative." I Ie added that it allows pro
fessors to accept emeritus status but still keep
some services offered to active professors.
In addition, the faculty laughed aloud at
Osgood's sentimental yet comical "Ode to a
Fighting 'Gale,' " which paid tribute to Ma
hood's tenure as chair this year.
