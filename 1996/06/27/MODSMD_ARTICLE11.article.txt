# Evers picked to serve on state commission

Hoover Institution Ile
search Fellow Bill Evers was appointed last
week by California Gov. Pete Wilson to serve
on a newly formed commission regarding ed
ucation.
The Commission for the Establishment of
Academic Content and Performance Stan
dards, on which Evers will serve, is composed
of 21 members and was formed as the result
of a bill passed by the state legislature. The
goal of the commission, Evers said, is to de
sign academic standards in core curriculum
for kindergarten through 12th grades.
Although he has a long history with Stan
ford and is a research fellow in domestic jxdi
cy, Evers said he believes it was his role as an
active parent, not a Stanford alumnus, that
earned him the appointment on the commit
tee.
"When you're a parent, you learn more

about [education] than the average taxpayer
or the average citizen," he said.
What Evers has learned, he has not neces
sarily liked. In fact, he has admittedly been a
strong critic of Palo Alto schools. In 1995, he
participated in a protest criticizing recom
mendations to teach mathematics in a less
structured manner. Evers said he also recent
ly testified in front of the Palo Alto Unified
School District Board regarding the materials
used in reading instruction.
Evers said he believes one of the largest
problems with the California school system is
the susceptibility to passing trends.
"The danger in all sorts of education re
form Ls that fads seem to sweep the field," he
said. "I don't want to come back in 10 years
and say 'Boy, we were sure caught up in this
fad.' "
Evers earned his bachelor's degree from
Stanford in 1972, his master's degree in 1978,
and his doctorate in 1987, all in political sci
ence.
