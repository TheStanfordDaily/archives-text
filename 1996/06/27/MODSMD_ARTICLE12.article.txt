# Trustees elect Bass as chair
## 
### Michael Harville 
At its most recent meet
ing, Stanford's Hoard of
Trustees elected a new
chair and a new board
member, but refrained
from taking any decisive
action regarding the con
troversial proposed merger
between Stanford Health
Services and the UC-San
Francisco Medical Center.
Robert M. Bass, a mem-

her of the hoard since 1989, will become its
22nd chair in the fall, succeeding John Krei
denrich. Freidenrich, who has served as
chair since 1992, will remain a hoard mem
ber. Bass has chaired the board's Land and
Buildings Committee, which guided the re
cent boom in campus construction, for the
last four years, and his hard work in this
post has greatly impressed his colleagues.

"Bob has been n fine member of the
board for seven years. He is well-known in
many parts of the Stanford community, lie
has done a lot for communities outside of
Stanford, and we are very pleased that he
would serve the school in this manner,"
Freidenrich said. "All of the new buildings
that have sprung up on campus in the last
few years have been approved and coordi
nated by his [Land and Buildings] commit
tee, and his leadership in this process has
been outstanding."
Bass earned his undergraduate degree
from Yale University in 1971, and he re
ceived his MBA from Stanford in 1974.
Aside from his tenure as a trustee, he has
served the University as director of the
Stanford Management Company, as a mem
ber of the Business School Advisory Council
and as director of the Graduate School of
Business Trust.


Bass
He also serves us a trustee for
many other organizations, in
cluding the Rockefeller Universi
ty, the Anion Carter Museum of
Art in Fort Worth, Texas, the
Cook-Fort Worth Medical Center
and the U.S. Capitol Preserva
tion Commission Advisory
Board.
Outside the University, Bass
is perhaps best known as a mem
ber of Fort Worth's wealthy
"Bass brothers" clan. During the
1980s, the four sons of Texas oil
man I'erry Bass made a number
of adroit investments in real es
tate and stocks that increased
their fortune from the millions
into t he billions of dollars. Robert
Bass, considered the wealthiest
of t he hrot hers, was estimated by
Forbes in 1091 to have a net
worth of $ 1.() billion.
The Bass family is well known

for its philanthropy: between
them, the brothers have, among
other things, funded the restora
tion of downtown Fort Worth,
paid for the entirety of the Bios
phere II project in the Arizona
desert, and made sizable contri
butions to many universities.
Robert Bass and his wife, Anne,
made a $25 million gift to Stan
ford in 1992 near the close of its
centennial campaign. At the
same time, they endowed five
professorships in the School of
Humanities and Sciences and
funded four fellowships in the
Business School.
In addition to electing a new
chair, the trustees elected Victor
Arias Jr. as their newest mem
ber. Like Bass, Arias is a Texan
with close ties to the Business
School; he graduated from the
University of Texas at El Paso in
1981, received his MBA from
Stanford in 1982, and presently
is the executive vice-president
and national marketing director
of Faison-Stone Las Colinas,

Inc., of Irving, Texas.
Arias is also president of the
Business School's National
Alumni Association Board, a
member oft lie Stanford Business
School Advisory Council and the
co-founder and president of the
National Society of Hispanic
MB As.
Of the other matters to be ad
dressed by the trustees, the most
widely anticipated was a review
of issues and progress related to
the proposed merger between the
medical centers of Stanford and
UCSF.
Just as the UC Regents have
recently slowed the UCSF side of
the negotiations, the Stanford
trustees do not appear anxious to
hurry the process forward. Frei
donrich characterized the
board's treatment of the pro
posed merger as "a broad discus
sion held behind closed doors,"
and declined to comment on any
of the specifics of these discus
sions.
According to Freidenrich, the

only action taken by the board was
to appoint an ad hoc committee
for dealing with matters related to
the proposed merger between now
a id the next board meeting,
which is not until October.
"If something comes up that
needs to be approved by the
board, but wc do not want to call
a full board meeting, the ad hoc
committee will stand in place of
the full board on that matter,"
Freidenrich explained.
The committee is not involved
in any negotiations regarding the
merger, and the full hoard would
need to approve any final merger
proposal.
When asked about the motiva
tions for the merger, Freidenrich
cited the need to reduce costs to
remain competitive in the rapidly
changing health marketplace.
"The people paying the hills
are demanding this," he said,
"and we would like to be able to
become a low-cost provider."
He also referred to the desire
to eliminate duplications of ox

pensive facilities and equipment
at the two sites, and to the bene
fit of combining some of the com
plementary strengths of the two
institutions.
In regard to the great concern
over potential job losses that a
merger could cause, Freidenrich
indicated that Stanford's posi
tion on this is well reflected by
the UC Regents' recent public
statement that at least 95 per
cent of all current positions at
UCSF would be retained in the
event of a merger.
"We would hope that any staff
reduction at Stanford could be
achieved through various forms
of attrition," he added, "but all of
that is way down the road at this
point."
Also of note was the approval
of next year's University budget.
"The board was very pleased
with the budget," Freidenrich
said, "and people were generally
very complimentary of Provost
Rice and her staff for the work
they put into it."
