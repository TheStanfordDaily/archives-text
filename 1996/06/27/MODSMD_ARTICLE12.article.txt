### Michael Harville 
At its most recent meet
ing, Stanford's Hoard of
Trustees elected a new
chair and a new board
member, but refrained
from taking any decisive
action regarding the con
troversial proposed merger
between Stanford Health
Services and the UC-San
Francisco Medical Center.
Robert M. Bass, a mem-

her of the hoard since 1989, will become its
22nd chair in the fall, succeeding John Krei
denrich. Freidenrich, who has served as
chair since 1992, will remain a hoard mem
ber. Bass has chaired the board's Land and
Buildings Committee, which guided the re
cent boom in campus construction, for the
last four years, and his hard work in this
post has greatly impressed his colleagues.

"Bob has been n fine member of the
board for seven years. He is well-known in
many parts of the Stanford community, lie
has done a lot for communities outside of
Stanford, and we are very pleased that he
would serve the school in this manner,"
Freidenrich said. "All of the new buildings
that have sprung up on campus in the last
few years have been approved and coordi
nated by his [Land and Buildings] commit
tee, and his leadership in this process has
been outstanding."
Bass earned his undergraduate degree
from Yale University in 1971, and he re
ceived his MBA from Stanford in 1974.
Aside from his tenure as a trustee, he has
served the University as director of the
Stanford Management Company, as a mem
ber of the Business School Advisory Council
and as director of the Graduate School of
Business Trust.
