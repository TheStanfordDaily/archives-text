nity. However, we find it difficult
to move beyond the day-to-day
duties of keeping the facility
open. . . .Overall efforts at coordi
nation and networking between
groups nre wenk and necessarily
short-sighted due to the annual
life cycle of the center."
According to Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds,
"Women have differing needs
that must be met. The Women's
Center has been very good at sup
porting itself with a staff that
changes, but. . .they do need
year-round, continued support. It
was not possible to do everything
that was requested, but we're
very happy to do some of the
things the Women's Center has
asked for."
How much the University will
provide in monetary terms has
not yet been determined.
Edmonds also said that it is
University President Gerhard
Casper's goal "to set a positive
lone between what goes on inside
and out of the classroom," and
that funding for the center is an
example of the creation of this
kind of harmony. The academic
programs the proposal suggested
were a strong point in the deci
sion to I'll 11 d I lie center, according
to Edmonds.
The funding will also assist in
making the Graduate Women's
Network stronger, Edmonds said.
Since graduate students are even
more isolated within depart
ments than are undergraduates,
the Graduate Women's Network,
which had 300 members this
year, helps to connect graduate
women with faculty mentors and
fellow graduate students.
While the general Women's
Center coordinator has been
funded by the University, until
now the Graduate Women's Net
work coordinator has been paid
on an ad hoc basis, receiving con
tributions from individual
schools who have agreed to fund
the position on a year-to-year
basis. Beginning next year, the
Graduate Women's Network co
ordinator will also be given a
salary by the University.
Natici Howe, the administra
tive advisor to the Women's Cen
ter explained the benefits of fund
ing this position.
"Basically, in the current con
figuration, there is a new gradu
ate coordinator every year, and
only for 10 months. We need to
stabilize the program and have an
ongoing life from year to year.
The administration has now rec
ognized the need for continued,
administrative support."
The funding is good news for
all parties. Hula Razek, a student
volunteer at the center and a for
mer summer intern, says about
working with the University on
this project, "The administration
is very supportive. I think it was

There is a red fire truck house
on the Stanford campus that, like
a fire, demands the attention of
(ho Stanford community. The
Women's Center, its primary res
ident since 1991 and a source of
stimulating dialogue about the
experiences of gentler and the na
ture of feminism, has consistent
ly been troubled by a lack of Uni
versity support, especially finan
cially. Now, however, the center
has reason to celebrate. Twenty
five years after the establishment
of a women's collective, the Uni
versity has decided to fund their
center permanently.
Active but inefficient
Until this year, the Women's
Center has had to rely on the
ASSU special fee for funding.
Two out of the past three years,
the center has not received this
special fee, but has been given a
minimal amount of support Irom
I lie University and from individ
ual departments at Stanford. The
problems in the efficacy of the
center have stemmed from t he in
stability of funding in I he past.
The funds that have been allo
cated to the center in the past
have gone mainly toward the
maintenance oft lie building itself
and the upkeep of programming.
The one-year position oft he coor
dinator has been supported by the
immense volunteer work of Stan
lord students who devote their
time and care to the center.
Because of the length and na
ture of the coordinator position,
the center has been run each year
by a person who is new to campus.
The summer intern trains the co
ordinator who arrives in the fall.
This detracts considerably from
time that could be spent increas
ing outreach done by the center.
Many of the women on campus do
not know very much about the
enter or about its programming
each quarter, since running the
center involves so much internal
maintenance.
Administrative support
This fall, the center will for the
first time receive additional fund
ing from the administration. This
will translate into support for
regular staff, student interns and
the Graduate Women's Network.
The funding will provide the cen
ter with some stability and the op
portunity to increase its outreach
and take advantage of its poten
tial benefit to the academic com
munity.
The center approached the ad
ministration this past spring with
a proposal for "permanent and
adequate funding" from the Uni
versity. The 1990 Women's Cen
ter Funding Proposal says the fol
lowing about the efficiency of the
center as a public facility: "As nn
information and referral center,
the Women's Center provides a

ing had boon done. They've been
really receptive from the start."
Why does Stanford need n
Women's Center?
The establishment of a com
munity center at Stanford is often
considered in terms of student re
tention. In other words, Stanford
is concerned with how it can best
welcome incoming students, meet
the needs of those students, and
encourage them to remain within
the campus community. This
way, the academic potential of all
students can be realized. The
community center provides sup
port and helps resolve problems
which could be obstacles to the
students' happiness and success,
such as discrimination, feelings of
loneliness, depression/a nx iety
and generally substandard
health
According to Women's Center
coordinator Marya llowell, "l'eo

ple started to realize that women
were having problems with as
sertiveness, had eating disorders,
and had generally lost a lot of self
esteem by the end of their college
years. This was not only at Stan
ford, but all around the United
States. Many campuses began to
set up safe places for women."
In order to determine the size
and scope of these potentially
damaging factors to Stanford
women, Cowell Student Health
Services conducted a Stanford
Students Health Needs Assess
ment in 1993. The overall results
of this study concluded that a
great deal of attention was needed
in the area of women's health.
As far as general health was
concerned, the study found that
"males self-report better health
status than women." The study
also assessed the psychological
well-being of the students, which
has a great effect on ncademic
performance. The report reads:

"The findings also highlight that
women are experiencing greater
psychological distress than men.
The data show that more under
graduate women have either neg

'Women have differing need hat must be met. The
Women's Center has been v / good at supporting itself

things the Women's Center s asked for.'

ntive or mixed feelings about
their academic performance.
More women feel anxious, over
whelmed by things to do, tired
without apparent reason, lonely,
depressed, and at least occasion

ally that life is not worth living."
Also stated in the report is the
fact that "significantly more
than the expected number of
both undergraduate (58%) and

graduate (60%) women report ad
ditional stress at Stanford be
cause of their gender" and that
this is "in contrast to 1 in 8 of the
men," suggesting a clear gender
disparity.

The Women's Center at Stan
ford, then, can play an integral
and necessary role in the lives of
Stanford women. According to
Razek, "Women have certain
needs, and there are a lot of subtle
and overt ways that women get
discriminated against and need
support. The Women's Center
provides not only support in a
general sense, but also network
ing with fellow students and fac
ulty, information, and referrals
for help and support from other
places."
Back to the beginning
When Stanford first opened in
1891, women constituted 25 per
cent of the entering class. The
number of women increased
steadily until 1899, when 40 per
cent of the student body was fe
male. Jane Stanford became un
easy, afraid of the possibility that
the school she had named after
her son would become a women's

college. With the policy that be
came known as the "500 Rule,"
she limited the total number of
women enrolled at Stanford to
500.
This practice was repealed in
19112, when University President
Ray Lyman Wilbur implemented
a new policy allowing women to
comprise up to 40 percent of the
student population. This quota,
too, was defeated, and in 1972,
the revised admissions policy re
quired, in the name of Title IX,
that students be selected based on
the applicant pool of each year
and not on a predetermined
mandatory ratio.
Also in the 19705, the Center
for Research on Women, which
later became the Institute for Re
search on Women and Gender,
was established. The Feminist
Studies Department was created
in 1980, and the gender studies
distribution requirement became
mandatory in 1990.

Today, the number of women
on the Stanford campus is rough
ly half the total student popula
tion, and overt discrimination
has been eliminated in legisla
tion. The network of women's or
ganizations at Stanford is a
strong support system for the
ever-unique experiences of being
female.
The start of a support
network
In the early 19705, a group of
Stanford women decided to meet
regularly, and this group evolved
into what is now known as the
Stanford Women's Collective.
They eventually gained a meeting
space in the Toyon Eating Clubs.
In the mid-80s, the University
funded a half-time position for a
graduate student to coordinate
the Women's Center and to assist
the student groups with advising
and programming.
The Women's Collective
moved in the fall of 1991 to its
present local ion in I lie Fire Truck
House behind Tresidder Union.
In addition to housing the
Women's Center Collective, the
Women's Center could house var
ious other groups: Cap and Gown,
the Inter-Sorority Council, the
National Women's Political Cau
cus, Stanford Pro-Choice Al
liance, the Society of Women En
gineers, Women Defending Our
selves and Ye Olde Safer Sex
Shoppe.
The Stanford Women's
Center, 199(5-7
There will be many changes
accompanying next year's
Women's Center, but much will
remain the same. It will still
house nearly 50 women's groups
and serve as a support center
where students can make con
tacts and friends. The center will
still have its unique library and a
computer cluster, as well as a
comfortable study lounge and
meeting space. Educational,
health and social programs such
as Herstory and the Women's
Leadership Conference will still
be organized and presented. Ref
erence publications such as the
annual A Woman's Guide to
Stanford and creative quarterlies
like Womenspeak, Americas and
Latinas and the Asian American
Women's Journal will continue
to be circulated.
But improvement is on the
horizon. Howell said the center
has a new goal for next year, given
this funding.
"One of the things we want to
do is make sure that every single
person on campus knows about
the center and knows about its
programming," Howell said,
adding that outreach will be a
major component of the changes.
This summer's intern, Katy
Chow, will not only be concentrat
ing on maintaining the center and
its future programming, but also
on creating a brochure of women's

resources on campus nnd formu
lating n Big Sister/Little Sister
progrnm for incoming women.
Direct ncndemic programming
will accompany the funding as
well. The center will be offering
"an ongoing working group and
final presentation forum for
women from different disciplines
writing their honors theses," ac-

cording to the proposal. For grad
uate students writing disserta
tions, there will be a dissertation
support group in which doctoral
candidates can come together to
"share techniques and strategies
for research, writing and presen
tation of work."
In addition to these academic
opportunities, the SURE Escort
Service is moving into the center
next. year. Women will he ahle to
study until late at night in the
center and always get a safe ride
home. Edmonds has also worked
to bring blue-light phones (a com
mon safety feature) to campus, as
well as self-defense classes that
are open to both sexes. The move
toward funding and administra
tive involvement will not only
benefit the academics of women,
but it will also improve the overall
safety of the Stanford campus for
students.
With improvements in out
reach, the center will be much
more accessible to the student
body next year.
"There are a lot of really differ
ent people at the Women's Cen
ter," Howell said. "Sometimes,
it's hard for people to get over the
stigma of walking in the door. But
once they do, they always want to
get involved. I'd call the Women's
Center a mixture of a support
group as well as a place to talk
about issues of gender and life,
and a place just to be."
A newly funded Women's Cen
ter will open its doors next fall,
welcoming all those able to get
over the stigma.

There is a red fire truck house
on the Stanford campus that, like
a fire, demands the attention of
(ho Stanford community. The
Women's Center, its primary res
ident since 1991 and a source of
stimulating dialogue about the
experiences of gentler and the na
ture of feminism, has consistent
ly been troubled by a lack of Uni
versity support, especially finan
cially. Now, however, the center
has reason to celebrate. Twenty
five years after the establishment
of a women's collective, the Uni
versity has decided to fund their
center permanently.
Active but inefficient
Until this year, the Women's
Center has had to rely on the
ASSU special fee for funding.
Two out of the past three years,
the center has not received this
special fee, but has been given a
minimal amount of support Irom
I lie University and from individ
ual departments at Stanford. The
problems in the efficacy of the
center have stemmed from t he in
stability of funding in I he past.
The funds that have been allo
cated to the center in the past
have gone mainly toward the
maintenance oft lie building itself
and the upkeep of programming.
The one-year position oft he coor
dinator has been supported by the
immense volunteer work of Stan
lord students who devote their
time and care to the center.
Because of the length and na
ture of the coordinator position,
the center has been run each year
by a person who is new to campus.
The summer intern trains the co
ordinator who arrives in the fall.
This detracts considerably from
time that could be spent increas
ing outreach done by the center.
Many of the women on campus do
not know very much about the
enter or about its programming
each quarter, since running the
center involves so much internal
maintenance.
Administrative support
This fall, the center will for the
first time receive additional fund
ing from the administration. This
will translate into support for
regular staff, student interns and
the Graduate Women's Network.
The funding will provide the cen
ter with some stability and the op
portunity to increase its outreach
and take advantage of its poten
tial benefit to the academic com
munity.
The center approached the ad
ministration this past spring with
a proposal for "permanent and
adequate funding" from the Uni
versity. The 1990 Women's Cen
ter Funding Proposal says the fol
lowing about the efficiency of the
center as a public facility: "As nn
information and referral center,
the Women's Center provides a

ing had boon done. They've been
really receptive from the start."
Why does Stanford need n
Women's Center?
The establishment of a com
munity center at Stanford is often
considered in terms of student re
tention. In other words, Stanford
is concerned with how it can best
welcome incoming students, meet
the needs of those students, and
encourage them to remain within
the campus community. This
way, the academic potential of all
students can be realized. The
community center provides sup
port and helps resolve problems
which could be obstacles to the
students' happiness and success,
such as discrimination, feelings of
loneliness, depression/a nx iety
and generally substandard
health
According to Women's Center
coordinator Marya llowell, "l'eo

ple started to realize that women
were having problems with as
sertiveness, had eating disorders,
and had generally lost a lot of self
esteem by the end of their college
years. This was not only at Stan
ford, but all around the United
States. Many campuses began to
set up safe places for women."
In order to determine the size
and scope of these potentially
damaging factors to Stanford
women, Cowell Student Health
Services conducted a Stanford
Students Health Needs Assess
ment in 1993. The overall results
of this study concluded that a
great deal of attention was needed
in the area of women's health.
As far as general health was
concerned, the study found that
"males self-report better health
status than women." The study
also assessed the psychological
well-being of the students, which
has a great effect on ncademic
performance. The report reads:

"The findings also highlight that
women are experiencing greater
psychological distress than men.
The data show that more under
graduate women have either neg

'Women have differing need hat must be met. The
Women's Center has been v / good at supporting itself
with a staff that changes, bu they do need year-round,
continued support. It was nc 'ossible to do everything that
was requested, but we're ve happy to do some of the
things the Women's Center s asked for.'

ntive or mixed feelings about
their academic performance.
More women feel anxious, over
whelmed by things to do, tired
without apparent reason, lonely,
depressed, and at least occasion

ally that life is not worth living."
Also stated in the report is the
fact that "significantly more
than the expected number of
both undergraduate (58%) and

graduate (60%) women report ad
ditional stress at Stanford be
cause of their gender" and that
this is "in contrast to 1 in 8 of the
men," suggesting a clear gender
disparity.

The Women's Center at Stan
ford, then, can play an integral
and necessary role in the lives of
Stanford women. According to
Razek, "Women have certain
needs, and there are a lot of subtle
and overt ways that women get
discriminated against and need
support. The Women's Center
provides not only support in a
general sense, but also network
ing with fellow students and fac
ulty, information, and referrals
for help and support from other
places."
Back to the beginning
When Stanford first opened in
1891, women constituted 25 per
cent of the entering class. The
number of women increased
steadily until 1899, when 40 per
cent of the student body was fe
male. Jane Stanford became un
easy, afraid of the possibility that
the school she had named after
her son would become a women's

college. With the policy that be
came known as the "500 Rule,"
she limited the total number of
women enrolled at Stanford to
500.
This practice was repealed in
19112, when University President
Ray Lyman Wilbur implemented
a new policy allowing women to
comprise up to 40 percent of the
student population. This quota,
too, was defeated, and in 1972,
the revised admissions policy re
quired, in the name of Title IX,
that students be selected based on
the applicant pool of each year
and not on a predetermined
mandatory ratio.
Also in the 19705, the Center
for Research on Women, which
later became the Institute for Re
search on Women and Gender,
was established. The Feminist
Studies Department was created
in 1980, and the gender studies
distribution requirement became
mandatory in 1990.

Today, the number of women
on the Stanford campus is rough
ly half the total student popula
tion, and overt discrimination
has been eliminated in legisla
tion. The network of women's or
ganizations at Stanford is a
strong support system for the
ever-unique experiences of being
female.
The start of a support
network
In the early 19705, a group of
Stanford women decided to meet
regularly, and this group evolved
into what is now known as the
Stanford Women's Collective.
They eventually gained a meeting
space in the Toyon Eating Clubs.
In the mid-80s, the University
funded a half-time position for a
graduate student to coordinate
the Women's Center and to assist
the student groups with advising
and programming.
The Women's Collective
moved in the fall of 1991 to its
present local ion in I lie Fire Truck
House behind Tresidder Union.
In addition to housing the
Women's Center Collective, the
Women's Center could house var
ious other groups: Cap and Gown,
the Inter-Sorority Council, the
National Women's Political Cau
cus, Stanford Pro-Choice Al
liance, the Society of Women En
gineers, Women Defending Our
selves and Ye Olde Safer Sex
Shoppe.
The Stanford Women's
Center, 199(5-7
There will be many changes
accompanying next year's
Women's Center, but much will
remain the same. It will still
house nearly 50 women's groups
and serve as a support center
where students can make con
tacts and friends. The center will
still have its unique library and a
computer cluster, as well as a
comfortable study lounge and
meeting space. Educational,
health and social programs such
as Herstory and the Women's
Leadership Conference will still
be organized and presented. Ref
erence publications such as the
annual A Woman's Guide to
Stanford and creative quarterlies
like Womenspeak, Americas and
Latinas and the Asian American
Women's Journal will continue
to be circulated.
But improvement is on the
horizon. Howell said the center
has a new goal for next year, given
this funding.
"One of the things we want to
do is make sure that every single
person on campus knows about
the center and knows about its
programming," Howell said,
adding that outreach will be a
major component of the changes.
This summer's intern, Katy
Chow, will not only be concentrat
ing on maintaining the center and
its future programming, but also
on creating a brochure of women's

resources on campus nnd formu
lating n Big Sister/Little Sister
progrnm for incoming women.
Direct ncndemic programming
will accompany the funding as
well. The center will be offering
"an ongoing working group and
final presentation forum for
women from different disciplines
writing their honors theses," ac-

cording to the proposal. For grad
uate students writing disserta
tions, there will be a dissertation
support group in which doctoral
candidates can come together to
"share techniques and strategies
for research, writing and presen
tation of work."
In addition to these academic
opportunities, the SURE Escort
Service is moving into the center
next. year. Women will he ahle to
study until late at night in the
center and always get a safe ride
home. Edmonds has also worked
to bring blue-light phones (a com
mon safety feature) to campus, as
well as self-defense classes that
are open to both sexes. The move
toward funding and administra
tive involvement will not only
benefit the academics of women,
but it will also improve the overall
safety of the Stanford campus for
students.
With improvements in out
reach, the center will be much
more accessible to the student
body next year.
"There are a lot of really differ
ent people at the Women's Cen
ter," Howell said. "Sometimes,
it's hard for people to get over the
stigma of walking in the door. But
once they do, they always want to
get involved. I'd call the Women's
Center a mixture of a support
group as well as a place to talk
about issues of gender and life,
and a place just to be."
A newly funded Women's Cen
ter will open its doors next fall,
welcoming all those able to get
over the stigma.

nity. However, we find it difficult
to move beyond the day-to-day
duties of keeping the facility
open. . . .Overall efforts at coordi
nation and networking between
groups nre wenk and necessarily
short-sighted due to the annual
life cycle of the center."
According to Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds,
"Women have differing needs
that must be met. The Women's
Center has been very good at sup
porting itself with a staff that
changes, but. . .they do need
year-round, continued support. It
was not possible to do everything
that was requested, but we're
very happy to do some of the
things the Women's Center has
asked for."
How much the University will
provide in monetary terms has
not yet been determined.
Edmonds also said that it is
University President Gerhard
Casper's goal "to set a positive
lone between what goes on inside
and out of the classroom," and
that funding for the center is an
example of the creation of this
kind of harmony. The academic
programs the proposal suggested
were a strong point in the deci
sion to I'll 11 d I lie center, according
to Edmonds.
The funding will also assist in
making the Graduate Women's
Network stronger, Edmonds said.
Since graduate students are even
more isolated within depart
ments than are undergraduates,
the Graduate Women's Network,
which had 300 members this
year, helps to connect graduate
women with faculty mentors and
fellow graduate students.
While the general Women's
Center coordinator has been
funded by the University, until
now the Graduate Women's Net
work coordinator has been paid
on an ad hoc basis, receiving con
tributions from individual
schools who have agreed to fund
the position on a year-to-year
basis. Beginning next year, the
Graduate Women's Network co
ordinator will also be given a
salary by the University.
Natici Howe, the administra
tive advisor to the Women's Cen
ter explained the benefits of fund
ing this position.
"Basically, in the current con
figuration, there is a new gradu
ate coordinator every year, and
only for 10 months. We need to
stabilize the program and have an
ongoing life from year to year.
The administration has now rec
ognized the need for continued,
administrative support."
The funding is good news for
all parties. Hula Razek, a student
volunteer at the center and a for
mer summer intern, says about
working with the University on
this project, "The administration

considered in terms of student re
tention. In other words, Stanford
is concerned with how it can best
welcome incoming students, meet
the needs of those students, and
encourage them to remain within
the campus community. This
way, the academic potential of all
students can be realized. The
community center provides sup
port and helps resolve problems
which could be obstacles to the
students' happiness and success,
such as discrimination, feelings of
loneliness, depression/a nx iety
and generally substandard
health
According to Women's Center
coordinator Marya llowell, "l'eo

ple started to realize that women
were having problems with as
sertiveness, had eating disorders,
and had generally lost a lot of self
esteem by the end of their college
years. This was not only at Stan
ford, but all around the United
States. Many campuses began to
set up safe places for women."
In order to determine the size
and scope of these potentially
damaging factors to Stanford
women, Cowell Student Health
Services conducted a Stanford
Students Health Needs Assess
ment in 1993. The overall results
of this study concluded that a
great deal of attention was needed
in the area of women's health.
As far as general health was
concerned, the study found that
"males self-report better health
status than women." The study
also assessed the psychological
well-being of the students, which
has a great effect on ncademic
performance. The report reads:

"The findings also highlight that
women are experiencing greater
psychological distress than men.
The data show that more under
graduate women have either neg

Women's Center has been v / good at supporting itself

ntive or mixed feelings about
their academic performance.
More women feel anxious, over
whelmed by things to do, tired
without apparent reason, lonely,
depressed, and at least occasion

ally that life is not worth living."
Also stated in the report is the
fact that "significantly more
than the expected number of
both undergraduate (58%) and

graduate (60%) women report ad
ditional stress at Stanford be
cause of their gender" and that
this is "in contrast to 1 in 8 of the
men," suggesting a clear gender
disparity.

The Women's Center at Stan
ford, then, can play an integral
and necessary role in the lives of
Stanford women. According to
Razek, "Women have certain
needs, and there are a lot of subtle
and overt ways that women get
discriminated against and need
support. The Women's Center
provides not only support in a
general sense, but also network
ing with fellow students and fac
ulty, information, and referrals
for help and support from other
places."
Back to the beginning
When Stanford first opened in
1891, women constituted 25 per
cent of the entering class. The
number of women increased
steadily until 1899, when 40 per
cent of the student body was fe
male. Jane Stanford became un
easy, afraid of the possibility that
the school she had named after
her son would become a women's

college. With the policy that be
came known as the "500 Rule,"
she limited the total number of
women enrolled at Stanford to
500.
This practice was repealed in
19112, when University President
Ray Lyman Wilbur implemented
a new policy allowing women to
comprise up to 40 percent of the
student population. This quota,
too, was defeated, and in 1972,
the revised admissions policy re
quired, in the name of Title IX,
that students be selected based on
the applicant pool of each year
and not on a predetermined
mandatory ratio.
Also in the 19705, the Center
for Research on Women, which
later became the Institute for Re
search on Women and Gender,
was established. The Feminist
Studies Department was created
in 1980, and the gender studies
distribution requirement became
mandatory in 1990.

Today, the number of women
on the Stanford campus is rough
ly half the total student popula
tion, and overt discrimination
has been eliminated in legisla
tion. The network of women's or
ganizations at Stanford is a
strong support system for the
ever-unique experiences of being
female.
The start of a support
network
In the early 19705, a group of
Stanford women decided to meet
regularly, and this group evolved
into what is now known as the
Stanford Women's Collective.
They eventually gained a meeting
space in the Toyon Eating Clubs.
In the mid-80s, the University
funded a half-time position for a
graduate student to coordinate
the Women's Center and to assist
the student groups with advising
and programming.
The Women's Collective
moved in the fall of 1991 to its
present local ion in I lie Fire Truck
House behind Tresidder Union.
In addition to housing the
Women's Center Collective, the
Women's Center could house var
ious other groups: Cap and Gown,
the Inter-Sorority Council, the
National Women's Political Cau
cus, Stanford Pro-Choice Al
liance, the Society of Women En
gineers, Women Defending Our
selves and Ye Olde Safer Sex
Shoppe.
The Stanford Women's
Center, 199(5-7
There will be many changes
accompanying next year's
Women's Center, but much will
remain the same. It will still
house nearly 50 women's groups
and serve as a support center
where students can make con
tacts and friends. The center will
still have its unique library and a
computer cluster, as well as a
comfortable study lounge and
meeting space. Educational,
health and social programs such
as Herstory and the Women's
Leadership Conference will still
be organized and presented. Ref
erence publications such as the
annual A Woman's Guide to
Stanford and creative quarterlies
like Womenspeak, Americas and
Latinas and the Asian American
Women's Journal will continue
to be circulated.
But improvement is on the
horizon. Howell said the center
has a new goal for next year, given
this funding.
"One of the things we want to
do is make sure that every single
person on campus knows about
the center and knows about its
programming," Howell said,
adding that outreach will be a
major component of the changes.
This summer's intern, Katy
Chow, will not only be concentrat
ing on maintaining the center and
its future programming, but also
on creating a brochure of women's

resources on campus nnd formu
lating n Big Sister/Little Sister
progrnm for incoming women.
Direct ncndemic programming
will accompany the funding as
well. The center will be offering
"an ongoing working group and
final presentation forum for
women from different disciplines
writing their honors theses," ac-

cording to the proposal. For grad
uate students writing disserta
tions, there will be a dissertation
support group in which doctoral
candidates can come together to
"share techniques and strategies
for research, writing and presen
tation of work."
In addition to these academic
opportunities, the SURE Escort
Service is moving into the center
next. year. Women will he ahle to
study until late at night in the
center and always get a safe ride
home. Edmonds has also worked
to bring blue-light phones (a com
mon safety feature) to campus, as
well as self-defense classes that
are open to both sexes. The move
toward funding and administra
tive involvement will not only
benefit the academics of women,
but it will also improve the overall
safety of the Stanford campus for
students.
With improvements in out
reach, the center will be much
more accessible to the student
body next year.
"There are a lot of really differ
ent people at the Women's Cen
ter," Howell said. "Sometimes,
it's hard for people to get over the
stigma of walking in the door. But
once they do, they always want to
get involved. I'd call the Women's
Center a mixture of a support
group as well as a place to talk
about issues of gender and life,
and a place just to be."
A newly funded Women's Cen
ter will open its doors next fall,
welcoming all those able to get
over the stigma.
