What starts out a.s an unusually stressful day for FIJI lab-rat
Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) turns into a wild adventure
on San Francisco's famous prison-island, Alcatraz. A group of
decorated Marines turned mercenaries, led by General llum
inr>l (10(1 Harris), threatens to unleash a devastating chemical
attack on San Francisco from its headquarters on Alcatraz.
Anyone who got goosebumps reading I lot Zone or watching t he
film "Outbreak" will be positively writhing at the possibilities
suggested by the chemicals in this film.
Cioodspeed is a chemical weapons specialist, a "Chemical
Superfreak" who advises the FBI and later accompanies the
Navv SKALS t hat attempt to diffuse the terrorist plan. At first,
Goodspeed seems to enjoy playing the role of an FBI field
agent, commandeering a banana-yellow Ferrari to chase ex
convict John Mason (Sean Connery) in a stolen Hummer. As
t hey race down Russian Hill, both Goodspeed and Mason relish
the adrenaline rush, quipping cops-and-robbers cliches. Good
speed is soon in over his head, but his witty humor in the face
of mental and physical trials endears him to the audience.
I 'alike t he majority of recent act ion blockbuster films, "The
Hock" has some wonderful acting to accompany its terrorists
and special agent s. Sean Connery is charming as always, noble
even as an ex-con. His character John Mason is a British spy
who has been forcibly "forgotten" for .'lO years because he
knows too much about American act ivit ies. He is also the only
in.hi believed to have escaped from Alcatraz alive.
I',(I I larris, in his role as superpat riot turned extort ionist, is
I aut as a t rip wire and as warped by t lie military as t hose boys
at the Citadel. Cage combines the antics that launched his
early career in films like "Raising Arizona" with the experi
enced performance of a mature actor exhibited in "Leaving Las
Vegas." Goodspeed's character is insistently humanized by his
obvious inexperience and fear, bringing heroism back to realm
i if t he everyday man; a Jean Valjean, if you will.
The only complaint of this reviewer is in regards to some of
t he violence, which at times seemed unnecessarily graphic and
prolific. This is definitely not a film for young children. Those
who can stomach the military violence will be breathless, on
t he edge of their seats a.s chemical weapons encroach upon the
City by the Bay, and tickled by a well-written and humorous
script.
