# Welcome to the Dollhouse
## 
### 
The daily experiences of 11-
yenr-old Dawn Wiener (Heather
Matnrazzo), better known at
Benjamin Franklin Junior High
as Wienerdog and Dogface, are
tragic. Her mother (Angela
Pietropinto) grossly favors
Dawn's bubbly younger sister,
Missy (Dnria Kalinina), who
prances perfectly around Dawn
in her pink tutu. Vindictive
cheerleaders target her daily in

the cafeteria, and classmate
Brandon (Brendan Sexton Jr.)
makes chilling after-school rape
appointments with Dawn.
A victim of her oversized eye
glasses, braces and the large
turquoise plastic-balled rubber
bands that hold her hair far too
tightly, Dawn is awkward and
lonely. Italphy (Dimitri lervoli
no) is her only friend and fellow
Special People Club member.
But her infatuation with her
older brother's "friend," who
comes to the Wiener's house to
copy homework and steal
money, taints her single friend
ship with Ralphy. To add insult
to injury, her parents tear down

her clubhouse for their tacky
Hawaiian anniversary party.
Dawn's need for affection
leads her to a deserted lot, desig
nated by Brandon as the after
noon appointment spot. Dawn's
ready acceptance of surrender
coupled with curiosity creates a
rising tension. She and Brandon
kiss, and without anything close
to an understanding of what
would be involved, she stands
vulnerable, ready to be raped.
Brandon's own insecurities and
innocence save her, and the
scene ends in a bittersweet
twist.
One would like to think that
writer/director Todd Solondz ex

aggerates Dawn's encounters.
The fact that he is not exagger
ating them is what intensifies
the film. While the discomfort is
unrelenting, no one in the audi
ence left, and I didn't once look
at my watch.
"Welcome to the Dollhouse"
is about the horrors of being un
popular in junior high. We can
all relate. Solondz liberally uses
profanity and malicious charac
ters to stretch his portrait to the
point of severity. Have things al
ways been so bad? How ironic
that, like the movie "Kids," this
"R" rated movie is not (suppos
edly) accessible to the age group
it depicts. And if this is the case,

then it is no wonder we sit un
easily in the theater, laughing at
jokes that are only too real and
prevalent, flinching at the same
tragedies that make us smirk.
Solondz's film is a catalyst to a
much-needed discourse on ado
lescence, covered over with a
humor so black it is hard to
make out what you are laughing
at, if you are indeed laughing.
