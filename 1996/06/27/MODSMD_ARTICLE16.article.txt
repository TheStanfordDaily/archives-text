# The 						Cable Guy
## 
### 
All good things come to an end. Unfortu
nately, this is something that Jim Carrey and
the production companies do not seem to real
ize.
I'll admit that Carrey's first few movies
were excellent and fresh. There was "Ace Ven
tura: I'et Detective," a quirky, funny movie.
Then came "The Mask," a decent film with
great action and special effects; and "Dumb
and Dumber," which was dumb and, well,
<lumber, but still bad some character and zest.
Hut with "The Cable Guy," Carrey is playing
wit h firo. This is one movie that could do seri
ous damage to his reputation. Why?
Stupid Idiotic. Mindless. Tackv. Pointless.
These are just some of the adjectives that come

to mind when I think about the movie. Consid
ering that it is written around Carrey and
whatever his personality and built-in special
effects could bring, it is not surprising that the
movie lacks a good, strong plot. Or, actually,
that the screenplay has any plot at all.
Storyline? There's a young professional
named Steven, who's havinga "period of sepa
ration" from his girlfriend, Robin. She kicks
him out after he proposes to her, and hence,
Steven needs to have his cable hooked up in his
new apartment. So, he waits and waits and
waits, and finally his cable guy shows up. Of
course, Carrey as the cable guy, is obnoxious
and unruly from the start.
Ilut Carrey isn't just any normal cable guy
It seems that his dysfunctionality is the result
of being raised by television instead of a moth
er, who ignored him to dally wit h men. So, Car
rey is constantly looking for loveand affection.
Originally, he tells Steven that his name is

Chip Douglas, but as you will later find out,
that is just one of his many aliases. He be
comes fixated by the idea of a friendship with
Steven, and begins to pursue that idea relent
lessly.
When rejected by Steven, Chip turns rene
gade and starts meddling in Steven's life, so
that at one point, even Robin and his family
turn against him. But there is a quasi-happy
ending, with Carrey redeeming himself in
some symbolic way that I don't understand
and Robin and Steven being reunited. (Warn
ing: The ending is one that allows for a "The
Cable Guy II." So, beware!)
If you have the desire to spend seven bucks
on mindless gibberish, then "The Cable Guy"
will definitely do. If not, then wait for the
video. Even then, the value of renting it is
questionable.
