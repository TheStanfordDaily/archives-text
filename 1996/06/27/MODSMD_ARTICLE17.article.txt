## MILLENCOLIN Life on a Plate 
### 
Punk ruck is dead. Willi the
(ireenday-ification of America
and (In* over-commercialization
(read: sellout) of prototypical
punk bands such as the recently
reunited Sex Pistols, any re
maining integrity in the modern
punk scene has been under
mined. In an effort to appeal to
the American teenage public,
modern bands have adopted the
musical style of the Kamones
and the Pistols while for the
most part ignoring their anti-es
tablishment, "fuck you" atti
tude.
While it is true that the punk
aesthetic has been sanitized and
generally softened, present-day
bands such as Mad Religion, The
Queers and Kugazi still make
great music.
Kilter Millencolin A group of
four Swedish ragamuffins re
cently signed to the rising Epi
taph label (of Offspring fame),
Millencolin follow closely in
their labebnates' footsteps. They
combine the speed and musical
precision of Penny wise with the
Meatlesque harmonies of Mad Re
ligion and an obsession with the
vulgar typical of NOFX. The re
sult is a wonderfully enjoyable
potpourri.
Although their mastery oft he
English language is not quite
complete, Millencolin are at
their best when singing about
eating ("The Story of My Life"),
Star Trek ("Vulcan Ears"), and
women who don't embrace the
waif look ("Killercrush"). It is
the latter song that most recalls
NOFX with the chorus, "It's
you, you're overweight and love

ly / yes, it's t rue. A pig in walk
ing .shoes / Vou drool every time
we kiss, I must say yon rule / I'm
falling in love with you."
Yet Millencolin have their
share of tw en tyso me tiling
angst, too, as evidenced by lines
such as, "I'm twenty-one, feel
ing down" ("Bullion") and"I
think I'm stuck forever" ("Re
play"). Thankfully, they avoid
self-pity and never seem to lose
t heir sense of humor, especially
in the few ska songs on the
allium ("Move Your Car," "Air
head," "Vulcan ftars" and"The
Story of My Life"). These four
tracks are especially catchy,
even including n trombone line

in "Airhead."
Overall, the 13 sours on "Life
on a Plate" are a memorable col
lection of pithy witticisms, sim
ple but melodic guitar lines and
glowingvocal harmonies. Millen
colin leave the listener wanting
more of their excellent poppy
punk rock, hoping they won't be
come an overplayed staple on
Live-105, and wondering what
the hell they mean when they
sing "Pillowpridc and shumway
lies isn't what you expected / a
solid demon crawls in you, at
least that's what they're say
ing."
