# SQUIRREL NUT
## ZIPPERS Hot 
### 
The Squirrel Nut Zippers are
a band as much out of time as
they are out of place. Literally
dozens of skinny white kids with
loud clangy guitars dominate the
Chapel Hill, N.C., music scene,
which includes indie-rock lumi
naries as Superchunk, Polvo,
Archers of Loaf, Tinsel and Cap
size 7. In contrast, there's nary a
distorted guitar or neurotic ado
lescent sentiment to be found on
the Zippers' second album,
"Hot." As on their first album,
"The Inevitable Squirrel Nut
Zippers," the seven-piece ensem
ble from Chapel Hill play Roar
ing 20s-era jazz-swing, employ
ing such m.•;( i n incuts as the Nnx
ophone, cornet, mandolin, banjo,
clarinet, ukulele, piano and
string bass, among other things.
The Zippers are, of course,
meticulously faithful to their mu
sical roofs and excellent musi
cians to boot (most of the tracks
on "Hot" were recorded live, using
only one or t wo microphones). Hut
the truly remarkable thing about
the Zippers is that they play with
such giddy, enthusiastic energy
("Got My Own Thing Now" and
"Prince Nez") that you want to
jump up from your seat and do the
Charleston, if only you knew how.
They aren't without a sly sense of
humor, either; "Hell" makes pur
gatory sound like a Halloween
party, full as i( is of quaint, melo
dramatic, and morbidly funny ru
minations on the afterlife: "This
is a place where eternally. . .fire is
applied (o the body. . . . teeth are
extruded and bones arc

ground / And made into cakes
which are pnssed around." Few
bands paying tribute to extinct
musical genres are able to muster
this combination of energy and
authenticity and still be surpris
ingly accessible to the unfamiliar
ear.
There isn't a bad track to be
found here: from the dreamy "Twi
light" to t he posit ively swinging in
strumental "Memphis Exorcism,"
the horns wail, the drums bash
merrily away, and the guitars and
related instruments are content to
strum jauntily in the background.
As Jim Malt bus crows on the open
ing track, "Used to walk along with
the rest. . . . now got something all
my own. .. . broke away somehow.
. . . now I'm swingin' it, got my own
thing now." The Squirrel Nut Zip
pers got their own thing, and
they're doing it damn well. Chock
full of nutty goodness.
