ABC's "World News
Tonight" reported on the major
issues of the day: the Russian
election, Whitewater, Valujet. It
is also contained one particular
ly interesting story, a feature on
public tours of the Pentagon.
The "news peg" — that's jour
nalist-ese for the aspect of a
story which makes it timely — of
the story was that the Pentagon
had hosted its two millionth vis
itor (or 10 millionth, or some
thing) that day. But ABC's cor
respondent wasn't terribly in
terested in that fact, or, for that
matter, many of the o(her i nt er
esting tidbits about the tour. I le
only mentioned in passing that
the Pentagon is the world's
largest office building. He never
pointed out that it's I lie only de
fense minis!ry in t he world open
for public visits The one aspect
he (bund to be truly remarkable
and what a majority of the
segment was devoted to docu
menting and analyzing was
that the servicemen who act as
guides walk backward fort he du
ration of the tour.
1 was in the ABC newsroom in
New York as the story aired.
"Can you believe that?" t he re
searchers I was sitting with
asked one another incredulous
ly. "Those people actually walk
backward!"
But the real kicker came as
the correspondent ended his
piece: The gazillionth visitor
didn't have to take a walking
tour, we were informed with a
can-you-believe-it air. The lucky
little tyke was escorted through
the building on, of all things, a
golf cart.
"What a great piece," the
folks in New York said.
Backward - wa Iking tour
guides. Coif carts aplenty. Can
you tell that the secretary of de
fense is a Stanford professor?
Obviously Bill Perry is working
hard to make the Pentagon into

his own version of Stanford-in-
Washington.
Such a breakthrough in my
understanding of the back
ground for Perry's policies has
caused me (<> radically reevalu
ate my understanding of bow
things work in the Pentagon, In
retrospect., the organization fa
mous for its $.'lOO toilet seats
seems well suited to pay for de
preciation on (lie University's
yaebt. "Don't ask, don't tell,
don't pursue" makes a lot of
sense when one thinks of bow
rarely anyone outside (lie
LCiBCC likes to think about or
discuss issues concerning Stan
ford's non-heterosexual popula
tion.
My breakthrough has also
helped me to understand much
of Washington, in fact. As Stan
ford is known for its insidious
shorthand (a Daily columnist
once pointed out that we've cre
ated the word "Chu" as an ab
breviated version of "Church,"
which itself is only one syllable),
it, now makes perfect sense that
Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, a man who went to
Stanford Law and served as
pres i don t of our Hoard of
Trustees, has had bis live-sylla
ble name truncated to the sim
ple, one-syllable "Chris." For
much the same reason, I'd as
sume, his position is referred to
within governmental and diplo
matic circles as simply "Sec-
State." And, as you'll recall, in

April SecStnte Chris discussed
the environment in a speech at
Mem And.
Once you start to think about
it, there are innumerable ways in
which the Stanford-associated
folks in our nation's capital can
work to make Washington seem
just a tad more Farm-like, and as
many ways to bring a Stanford
perspective to national issues.
The public's perception of
Congress, for example, is at an
all-time low. More than at any
other time in the country's histo
ry, people have little or no faith in
the legislative branch's ability to
get things done and to do its busi
ness fairly and honestly. Our
alumni in the Senate and the

House should consider taking a
page from the ASSU: Perhaps ac
countability — and therefore
popularity — can bo improved if
senators and representatives are
required to wear sweatshirts pro
claiming that they are U.S. Con
gressmen, silly.
Need money to build new in
frastructure? ('all Hill Hewlett
and the Packard Foundation.
Having problems with the na
tion's transportation systems?
.lust expand the Marguerite
routes.
Now that I've let the cat out of
the bag, Farm-affiliated national
leaders can unabashedly go
ahead with their plans to make
the country like Stanford. The

Supreme Court (with its comple
ment of four Stnnford-educated
justices) can grant states tho
right to decide in individual ref
erenda whether to serve grapes
within their borders. Tiger sala
manders everywhere can
breathe sighs of relief.
Of course, if our influential
alumni really wanted to show
t heir t rue ('ordinal colors, they'd
cut off all research funds to UC-
Berkeley. Hut that might be
going a bit too far.
Nah. Go ahead, give 'em the ax.
