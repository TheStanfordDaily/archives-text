## Fix end-of-school rush 
### 
YOU'VE .JUST FINISHED
your last final, a brutal elec
triral engineering exam;
you've spent t he last week staying
up late cramming for all of your
other tests and writing your term
papers. Now you're done with the
school year, and you want to say
good-bye to your friends, take this
one to the airport, have dinner
with that one, maybe go see a
movie with the whole gang.
Problem: You have exactly 17.f)
hours to pack all of your belong
ings and vacate your dorm. What,
you've been evicted?! Well, if you
live on-campus at Stanford, you
have. 1 localise at Stanford, non-se
niors are given until high noon to
get out of town before the big, had
janitors start throwing them out.
I lad a tough finals week? Too bad.
Really want to see your friend be
fore she graduates? Sorry. It's
time to get started; you haven't
even |>ul your ('l)'.s back in (heir
jewel boxes.
OK. Perhaps I am overdrama
ti/.ing the situation. Not every
body has the bad fortune to be
stuck with an afternoon exam on
the last day of finals, and if stu
dents planned ahead a little bet ter
both in their classes and their

packing, they wouldn't have to do
everything at the last second. Hut
who is going to take t imr off from
lab or from writing their term
paper to fold t heir winter clothes?
Kicking students out of their
housing less than 24 hours after
the last day of finals is simply un
acceptable. It produces an unnec
essary rush ;it precisely the wrong
time. Most students end up stay
ing up the whole night, frantically
stuffing books into boxes, clothes
into suit cases, and anything else
wherever it. fits. True, this is the
stuff of which memories are made,
but so is being under enemy fire.
Of course, I do not mean to com
pare the mild annoyance of having
to pack all night with the ghastly
suffering of war. I merely wish to
point out that here we have a per
fect example of one of those bu
reaucratic policies which make
st intents fee! soalienated from the
University administration. Sure
ly, "they" — the nameless bureau
crats who constitute the basic
image of the administration for
students — surely they realize
that we just finished our finals,
that the end of the year is hectic
enough without having to pack at
warp speed. Of course, most stu

dents have no idea who makes
these policies and why it is so im
portant that their rooms he
cleared before the? sun hits the
middle of the sky, so they just
chalk it up as another sij;n of I 'Di
versity indifference to I heir plight.
Stanford is normally so good at
taking care of everything so that
students can concentrate on their
studies. The same Housing and
Dining Services that gives you the
hoot right after finals probably
also provides you with decent 112 ur
niture, in-room connections,
washers and dryers, clean hall
ways and bathrooms, something
resembling food, and sometimes
even cable TV. Stanford students
have no good reason to pillory the
whole housing system; we just
take for granted all oft he everyday
amenities that "they" provide (not
that we don't pay handsomely for
the services). Hut this is a no
brainer. All students, not just
graduating seniors , should he al
lowed to stay in their dorms for at
least two full days after the last
day of finals.
