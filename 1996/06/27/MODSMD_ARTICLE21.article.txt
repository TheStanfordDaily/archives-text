Memorial Church's functions vital to Stanford

Dear Friends at the Daily. Your edito
rial on the recent appointment of a
rabbi as associate dean of (he chapel
struck me as both emotionally agitated and
intellectually unfocused. The questions at
issue seem to be these: why should Stan
ford have religious professionals on the
payroll in the first place, and if so, why
should one of those people be a rabbi?
One of our major i-asks in life is to come to
grips with two facts: that our own little ego is
not the biggest thing out there and yet, at
the same time, our humanity somehow con

tains the seeds of something of absolutely in
finite worth. There is something about this
struggle towards consciousness that fuels
human achievement. Most intellectually gift
ed people are passionately committed to find
ing beauty, order, and moaning in the world.
If they can't find it, t hey make it . This force
makes some of us artist s, some of us scien
tists, some of us philosophers. Religious pro
fessionals of the kind selected to serve at
Stanford are experienced in helping both in
dividuals and groups frame their quests for
meaning in productive ways.

At this level, it matters very little
whether the person who comes to your
dorm to help talk things out after a friend
has committed suicide is a Protestant pas
tor or a Reform rabbi. Relatively few un
dergraduates are engaged in sufficiently
detailed doctrinal struggles with t heir faith
of origin that they must seek counsel from
someone of exactly the same sect. Obvious
ly, however, the appointment of a rabbi
sends a message of inclusion to Stanford's
Jewish community. Your editorial perhaps
indicates resentment t hat conservative

Protestant Christianity has no representa
tive at Mem Chu. I think that there is a
good reason for this: Stanford as an insti
tution of higher learning is committed to
applying reason to the solution of human
problems, and Biblical literalists are un
likely to contribute to this endeavor. Rab
bis, on the other hand, have two millennia
of collective experience to bring to bear on
t he sacred task of applying reason to
human ethical dilemmas.
