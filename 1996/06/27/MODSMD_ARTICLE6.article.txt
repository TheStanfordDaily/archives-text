created its own version of the
now-traditional Wacky Walk as it
celebrated Stanford's 105tli Com
mencement. While a flert of l?ig
Wheels (below left) raced around
the track, others brought in vol
leyball nets and wading pools. An
other group handed out ice cream,
and a lemonade stand waited for
thirsty graduates as nearby,
model rockets were sent off into
space.
A number of students eschewed
the traditional plain black mor
tarboard for headwear such as

antlers (below right) and som
breros. Others chose to decorate
their mortarboards with every
thing from a solar-powered wind
mill to a large balloon reading
"Mom" with a down arrow, point
ing toward the student in ques
tion.
Students seemed happy to greet
University President Gerhard
Casper, who fielded volleyballs
and hugs from students as he
walked into the stadium (above
right). Casper bid an "especially
affectionate welcome" and "a
pensive farewell" to the members
of the Class of '96, his "former fel

low freshmen" who entered Stan
ford with him in the fall of 1992.
Graduates were sent off with
words from keynote speaker Mae
Jemison, class of '77, who advised
students not to he afraid of failing
or of new opportunities (above
left). Jemison, (In' first black fe
male astronaut in space, also has
experience as a Dartmouth Col
lege environmental studies pro
fessor and as the director of the
Jemison Institute for Advancing
