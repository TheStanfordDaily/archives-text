## Town & Country fire forces 3 businesses to close 
### Kristie Smith Staff writer 
Three businesses in the Town &
Country Village have been cloned
down for an undetermined amount
of time duo to a fire (hat broke out
last week, according to Tabor Food
Services President Peter Tabor
mid Juice Club sjMikesman Ed Col
lar.
The tragedy began last Wednes
day night as a two-alarm fire broke
out in Ilobee's liestaurant. Ac
cording to Taber, whose company
owns Ilobee's, fire investigators
have determined that the fire was
accidental, resulting from the
spontaneous combustion of oil and
rags in the kitchen.
"There was just the right com
bination of ingredients in the right
amounts," Taber said. A busted
gas pipe and some old structural
wood in Town & Country con
tributed to the spread of the fire,
he added.
The fire quickly spread from I lie
restaurant's kitchen to tho roofs of
several nearby businesses, draw
ing firelighters 112 rom as far away as
Menlo Park and Los Altos to com
bat t he flames.
Fortunately, a fireproofdoor be
t ween t he I Inbee's kitchen and t he
dining area kept the flames from
spreading. However, the smoke
damage was extensive throughout
Town & Country, and many busi
nesses surrounding Ilobee's had
lire damage to their roofs.
To date, three businesses still
remain closed as a result of the fire:
Garner's Pro Bike Shop, Ilobee's
Restaurant and Juice Club. Ac
cording to Frank McCann, a repre
sentative for Town & Country, the
Peninsula Pox Office, World Sav
ings and Petaluma's Restaurant
are already back in business after
closing for a short period of time
because of the fire.
Juice Club will quickly rebuild
its store, according to a Juice Club
Inc. spokesman. Since the fire
swept only through the storage
area of Juice ('lub, there was a lim
ited amount of damage.

"We are grateful that no one
was hurt," Juice Club. CEO Kirk
Perron said in a press release.
"Now, we're focusing on getting
this store up and running again."
In order to help serve Palo Alto
customers, Juice Club Inc., which
operates both Juice Club and
Jamba Juice, will heavily staff both

the Cupertino .Juice Club and the
new Jamba Juice in Foster City.
As for Ilobee's Restaurant,
whose fire damage was the most
extensive, the decision to rebuild
the restaurant in its current loca
t ion or to relocate to another, larg
er area has not been mack', Taber
said.

"We'd like to relocate to the va
cant Town & Country Pharmacy
location," Taber said. The new site
would not only double the restau
rant's space but would also allow
Ilobee's to expand its dining area
to include meeting rooms that
could accommodate 20-25 people.
"These meeting spaces would be

good, especially for groups from
Stanford," he said.
"We want to come out better, to
come out ahead in this ordeal,"
Taber added.
Representatives from Hobee's
will be meeting with Town &
Country officials to discuss their
options this week, he said.
