Stanford students will have the
opportunity to formalize their in
terest in dance through either a
minor or a major next fall as the
Stanford Dance Division gets set
to move out of the Athletics De
partment and into the Drama De
partment in the School of I luman
ities and Sciences.
"This is a change that repre
sents simultaneously the matura
tion of the field of dance as a legit
imate academic discipline and the
solidifying of the place of the arts
in American higher education,"
said .Janice Ross, co-chair of the
dance program and director of the
graduate dance program.
According to Ross, the move
from the Athletics Department to

the Drama Department parallels a
shift in the dance program at
Stanford over the years as a form
of exercise to a form of art. In the
early days of the University,
dance at Stanford was mostly a
recreational form of exercise for
women. However, since the turn
of the century, dance at Stanford
has changed into a performing
art.
In the last decade, the Stan
ford Dance Division has added
faculty members of substantial
backgrounds and national repu
tations as dance artists. These
renowned artists include Richard
Powers, a vintage dunce teacher
and choreographer; Robert
Moses, a dancer and a choreogra
pher with ODC/SF and Twyla
Tharp and Kristine Elliot, a lead
ing dancer with the American

Ballet Company.
According to Ross, Drama De
partment Chair Charles Lyons in
vited the dance program to join his
department earlier this year be
cause he thought that the two disci
plines could greatly benefit one an
other.
The move will provide drama
students with an opportunity to
develop their acting skills by tak
ing dance classes, Powers said.
"Drama students taking dance
classes will expand their sense of
body movement and physical pres
ence on stage," he added.
Ross also Raid (he move is im
portant both conceptually and ad
ministratively.
"Conceptually it means that
dance at Stanford is now framed as
an art form and a humanities dis
cipline rather than as a recreation

al activity," she said. "Administra
tively it means that the colleagues
of the dance faculty and students
are now Igrouped with] the other
arts faculty and students, all of
whom are already in the School of
Humanities and Sciences."
Ross added that the conditions
within dance, drama and athletics
have all shifted in recent years to
the point where everyone who was
concerned found this move to be a
good solution.
In the past, students could not
major in dance, as the program
was a division of the Athletics De
partment. The University does
not offer any undergraduate
major in athletics. With this move,
however, the dance program will
have the status of an academic
component of campus life.
"It has been decades since a

student could major in dance at
Stanford," Ross said. "The result
has been that we have literally
hundreds of students enrolled
each year in our classes simply be
cause they feel it is a vital part of
their lives and experience at Stan
ford."
lioss stated that the program
will undoubtedly change because it
will now be framed as an arts disci
pline. New courses, such as Period
Movement, which Powers will
teach, will stress those aspects of
dance outside of recreational em
phasis.
The dance? minor, which will be
offered in Ihe (all, will total 31 units,
requiring throe lecture classes, one
production class and two perfor
mance classes, a.s well as 15 units of
studio work. Plans for a dance major
are also being worked out.
