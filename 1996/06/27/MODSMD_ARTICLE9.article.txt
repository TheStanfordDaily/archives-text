# Bon Appetit workers vote to organize union
## 
### Chad Bennett Editorial staff 
A 74 to 51 vote in a National Labor Rela
tions Hoard election on June 10 successfully
capped a four-month unionization effort hy
f(»o<l service workers for Hon Appetit, which
controls campus eateries in Tresidder Union
and the Graduate School of Business.
According to Carlos Hernandez, an orga
nizer for local 715, Service Employees Inter
national Union, the formation of a union will
empower Bon Appetit workers to seek im
proved benefits and working conditions.
"Now workers know that they have the
same power as the boss to negotiate. They
know they can change their lives," Hernan
dez said.
The election, which hinged on the votes of
student workers — who make up roughly half
of Bon Appetit's employees — was closer than
exjx'cted, according to 1 lernandez. The most
ly part-time student employees were not orig
inally included in the unionization process,
but Hon Appetit insisted that they be includ
ed in any negotiations.
"The company made a really smart move

trying to include tho students, because they
really don't caro about these jobs. For them
it's just some extra money, but for the full
time workers it's how they survive," said I ler
nandez, who claimed that the closeness of the
vote was "because Bon Appetit did a good job
of lying to a lot of student workers."
Mary Clark, district manager for Bon Ap
petit, disagreed. "The student support was
based on the students speaking to just a few of
the Coffee I louse people. It w;is based on stu
dents not voting for themselves but for the
full-time people," she said.
"I'd say the actual staff is split. There are
as many regular staff who voted no as there
are who voted yes," Clark added.
During the week leading up to the vote,
student workers were deluged with letters,
phonecallsand even visits from parties repre
senting l>oth sides of the issue. Documents
that The Daily obtained earlier this month in
clude pleas from management not to end
"The Hon Appetit Magic" and petitions with
student workers' hand written signatures in
support of the union.
Hernandez characterized the attitude of
student employees as supportive of the full

time workers. "But when Bon Appetit started
telling them the workers didn't want tho
union, a lot of students got confused," Her
nandez said.
Karine Choi, a junior who has been em
ployed at the Coffee House for nearly a year,
was one of the student workers swamped
with conflicting information. "I understand
the full-time workers' needs, but I didn't
want to Ik? forced to join a union where I
didn't know what kind of role I would play in
it," said Choi, who decided not to vote either
way.
According to Choi, "as a student employee
I didn't know how a union would benefit me.
For the most part, it seemed the union was
geared toward the full-time employees."
1 lernandez, who claimed lion Appetit in
cluded students in the vote as an attempt to
stalwart the union, didn't know if students
and other part-time workers would 1k» re
quired to join the union. He noted that in a
similar situation at San Francisco State Uni
versity, Hon Appetit opted to include only
workers who worked 20 hours or more.
Clark denied using students as a means to
oppose the union but did hint that Bon Ap

petit would not ask to have students included
in tho union.
"My put fooling is tlmt there aro a lot of
people out there who don't want to be in a
union," Clark said, adding that Hon Appet.it
would fight for student jobs. "I can't see stu
dents paying union dues, but 1 don't know.
Anythingenn happen in negotiations."
Hernandez, who hopes that Hon Appetit
will "negotiate in good faith," said a negotia
tion team made up of workers will be elected
next Friday, and a first proposal will soon fol
low.
Clark claimed she is wary of what she
branded the union organizers' "kind of slan
der and rhetoric" in the negotiation process
and is afraid that the promises union organiz
ers made concerning complex issues such as
wages and health care cannot be kept.
"Thirty percent wage increases? I don't
think so. We don't have that kind of profit
margin," Clark said.
"I don't think people were told that side of
the story, so 1 think they're going to have to
experience it. I've known these people for
seven years. It breaks my heart, really," she
added.
