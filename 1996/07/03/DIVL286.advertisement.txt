Dating? Nah.
Getting a suntan?
Puh-lease. Movies?
Over-air-conditioned.
You know what you
really want. You want
to write for The
Weekly. It's scintillat
ing. It's fun. It pays
you something. It
gets you published,
and it gets you into
that whole writer
community thing. It
teaches you about
life, and leads, and
AP style. OK. You're
convinced. So call
Chad or Jeremy at
725-2100.
We're waiting for you.
