# Mike takes on the Dream Team
## 
### David Wolitz Editorial staff 
Stanford basketball coach Mike
Montgomery flew off to Detroit
earlier this week to begin coaching
the Under 22 USA National Bas
ketball Team. After only a couple of
days of practice, his team will face
the USA Olympic Team, popularly
known as the Dream Team, this
Saturday on national television.
Selected as the head coach ear
lier this year, Montgomery held
trials two weeks ago in Colorado to
determine the team's roster. Six
teen players were selected, includ
ing two Stanford stars: point
guard Brevin Knight and center
Tim Young. Montgomery said
that the roster must be cut down
to 12 players after next week, but
that Knight's place is virtually as
sured due to his strong perfor
mance at the trials. Young will
have to battle some of the premier
centers in college basketball, in

eluding Tim Duncan of Wake For
est, in order to secure a spot on the
team.
After their practices

and games in Detroit,
Montgomery's team will
regroup at Stanford on Au
gust 10 to begin eight days
of two-a-day practices in
preparation for the Pan-
American games in Puerto
Rico. The practices will
take place in Maples Pavil
ion and are open to the
public.
Munteomerv noted that

one of his biggest challenges as the
head coach is to overcome the pos
sibility of an "All-Star mentality"
among the players, all of whom are
stars on their own teams. With a
team composed of college stand
outs, there is the danger of having
"a lot of chiefs and not very many
Indians," Montgomery said.
He hopes to foster the same dis
ciplined team mentality on Team

USA for which his Stanford teams
are noted.
"Somebody has to be the 12th
man," he pointed out,

"even if he's a starter and
regularly scores above 20
points on his college team."
Although Team USA will
not field stars like Marcus
Camby and Allen Iverson
due to their decisions to be
come professionals, Mont
gomery feels that the
Under 22 Men's Champi
onships will attract more
attention in America than

in previous years. Saturday's na
tionally televised game against the
Dream Team will be a big boost to
ward that end, though Mont
gomery has no illusions about his
team's chances.
"If we come within 40 points [of
the Dream Team], we've done a
hell of a job," he said.
The game will air on NBC at 1
p.m. PST.
