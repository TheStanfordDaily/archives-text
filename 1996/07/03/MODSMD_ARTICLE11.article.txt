# VanDerveer Team Poised for Gold in Atlanta games
## Group finishes nine months of exhibition play undefeated; expectations remain high 
### David Wolitz Editorial staff 
Stanford women's bas
ketball coach Tara Van-
Derveer, who will lead the
American women's basket
ball team into the
Olympics, has her sights
set on the gold as her team
finishes a two-week train
ing camp at the U.S.
Olympic Training Center
in Colorado Springs. Team
USA has gone undefeated
in all 51 of its games over

the last nine months, and expecta
tions are high heading into the
Olympics.
Team members, along with
coach VanDerveer, will be spend
ing the next two weeks polishing
their games and taking in some
sun at the Disney Institute in
Florida. They will then take on the
highly touted Italian Olympic
team at Market Square Arena in
Indianapolis on July 13 in what
will be their final game before the
Olympics.
According to VanDerveer,
Team USA has been "practicing
very hard in Colorado, scrimmag
ing a group of men from the Air
Force Academy." The team is in
good spirits as it heads to Florida,
she said, and is "full of enthusi
asm."
Asked why the American public
should expect anything less than
gold given the team's undefeated
record. VanDerveer lautrhed and

said, "If you were at the games..
referring to the close games her
team has played against China,

Canada, and Australia.
"Maybe we've created a lit
tle of a monster for our
selves," she admitted, but
"the players have accepted
the challenge."
Team USA's toughest
competition will likely
come from traditional
powerhouses Canada,
Italy and Brazil, though
VanDerveer worries about
the newly constituted

Ukrainian national team, as well
as the "mysterious" Russian team.
There are rumors, she said, that
Russia has not sent their real team
to international competition.
Brazil is the defending world
champion.
Reflecting on the difference be
tween coaching the Olympic team
and coaching the Stanford Cardi
nal, VanDerveer joked, "Well, I
don't have to worry about eligibili
ty or finals here." In a more serious
tone, she added, "The thing that's
really different is the level of com
mitment to basketball. This is a
step higher. Basketball is their life,
their career. They don't have bas
ketball and studying. It's just bas
ketball."
Summing up the mood of the
team, which includes former Stan
ford star Jennifer Azzi, Van-
Derveer said, "All in all, we're ex
cited but at this point a little bit
tired, too."
