## STEALING BEAUTY 
### 
For those cinephiles who desire
the technical perfection of great
movie direction, "Stealing Beauty"
strives to impress. From the initial
aerial shots to the wandering
panoramic views, director Bernardo
Bertolucci ("The Last Emperor")
lyrically depicts the mysterious qual
ities of romance and lust latent in the
hills of Tuscany, Italy.
The daughter of Aerosmith lead
singer Steven Tyler, Liv Tyler is
Bertolucci's peculiar choice for the
leading female role. The motivation
for the narrative progression of this
film is the nubile quality of Tyler's
character, Lucy. Considering that
Tyler's screen debut was in the
music video for "Crying" (with co
star Alicia Silverstone), freshman
acting ability is a concern.
Lucy, a 19-year-old American

girl, visits a small artist colony in
Tuscany where her recently-de
ceased mother once frolicked as a
poet and model. Under the guise of
posing for her portrait, Lucy whips
the small community into a strange
sexual froth. The other characters
quickly learn that Lucy is a virgin.
Her untapped sexuality mesmerizes
the males and inspires sweltering di
alogue among the women. While
Lucy searches for the perfect pas
sionate encounter, the peripheral
characters become intriguing illus
trations of the absurd.
Not surprisingly, Jeremy Irons
("Reversal of Fortune") delivers the
most poignant performance in the
film. As Alex, a terminally ill play
wright, Irons exudes the tragic aura
of a person released from inhibition
by the proximity of death. Due to ex
cellent writing by Bertolucci and
screenwriter Susan Minot, the blos
soming friendship between Lucy
and Alex explores the frantic need
for human fulfillment in the face of

mortality. Both the content and de
livery of Irons' lines bolster the ele
gance of this fdm.
Bertolucci blatantly experiments
with the artifice of film in "Stealing
Beauty." The movie contains many
wonderful attempts to establish a
link between motion photography
and the classical art tradition indige
nous to Italian culture. The director
makes no attempt to deny the fact
that as an artist and voyeur, he him
self is stealing the beauty of both
Tyler and the Tuscan hillside.
Ultimately, "Stealing Beauty"
succeeds on the level of aesthetic
artistry, a delight submerged in the
deluge of typical summer-genre en
tertainment. Those who enjoy the
beauty inherent in an innovative di
rectorial style should allow Tyler a
chance to draw them in. If she does,
the movie is sensuously superb. But
even if she does not, this film is visu
ally engaging as well as highly origi
nal.
