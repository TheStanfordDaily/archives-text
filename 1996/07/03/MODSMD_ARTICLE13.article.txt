Recently, I had a friend create
a list of movies classified as "sur
real, disturbing, and dreamy."
The motivation lay in my desire
to build a repertoire of Deli
catessen/Twin Peaks-type films
to fill my lethargic summer
nights with upsetting, stressful
psycho-drama. I suggest watch
ing them one after the other.
Baby Snakes
Watch Zappa proselytes drool

with twisted glee and shameless
sots ambushed by visual candy
and Zappa-isms in this three-hour
rock-u-mentary, "Baby Snakes."
Created in 1979 and re-released
in the mid-80s on video, "Baby
Snakes" unabashedly displays
"people who are not into normal
stuff." Zappa's merciless satire on
the music scene combines with in
credible clay animation by Bruce
Bickford to master a nonstop bar
rage of aberrant off-and onstage
behavior and psychedelic clay
morphing. This movie presages

early MTV music video art, inani
ty and genius.
Simple Men
"Simple Men" is wounding.
Along with its strangely-hued,
arty cinematography and some
times two-dimensional acting, it is
filled with philosophical interrup
tions in otherwise inconsequential
conversation and pregnant si
lences. Directed by Hal Hartley in
1993, this story follows two broth
ers looking for their criminal fa
ther.
The two brothers begin with
few clues. There is Bill, a profes
sional (and heartbroken) criminal

whose girlfriend duped him in
their last scam, and Dennis, the
younger, confused but pensive col
lege kid. En route to Long Island,
they learn from one lascivious
Catholic school girl and the local
schizophrenic where to go: San
gaponek. During a late night of
dancing and romancing, political
waxing, smoking dope and drink
ing to the music of Sonic Youth,
they learn about love, themselves
and the location of their father.
Heavenly Creatures
A truly upsetting movie from
1994, "Heavenly Creatures" fol
lows the story of two 14-year-old

girls living in New Zealand who
murder one of the girls' mother.
Pauline Parker, the quiet, intelli
gent New Zealander, becomes en
amored of new student Juliet
Hulme, the snotty, precocious
English transplant whose acute
intelligence and sophistication of
fends everyone.
Director Peter Jackson re-fash
ions this true-story murder of
1954 using a sickening combina
tion of "Cops"-style TVjournalism
and surreal clay and computer an
imation. Relentlessly suspenseful,
Jackson's film unfolds the quasi
erotic relationship of these two
playmates as they become en
grossed in their imaginary world.
