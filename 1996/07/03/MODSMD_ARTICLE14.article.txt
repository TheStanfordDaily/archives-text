# SANTIAGO RODRIGUEZ
## Piano in Hollywood 
### 
Pianist Santiago Rodriguez
has made several fine recordings
for the Elan label, mostly of the
works of Rachmaninoff and
Latin American composers. This
album comes as a surprise as Ro

driguez, a serious pianist, conde
scends to play piano concertos
from Hollywood movie sound
tracks from the '40s and '50s. Yet
the result is never less than satis
fying.
Despite the album's cheesy
cover, all the pieces, ranging from
Gershwin to Rozsa, are tastefully
interpreted and finely chiseled.
This is precisely the kind of reper
toire that few musicians take seri
ously enough to perform careful
ly-
Richard Addinsell's "Warsaw

Concerto," by far the most
renowned piece in the set, sheds all
its triteness under Rodriguez's
fingers. The melodic lines are al
ways well-sustained without ex
cess sentimentality. Rodriguez
adds arpeggiated figures to buff up
some of the solo passages, which
could otherwise be outweighed by
the orchestra.
Miklos Rozsa's "Spellbound
Concerto" is perhaps the most mu
sically crafted of all. It's un
abashedly romantic, with big,
sweeping melodies and dramatic

orchestrations. Again, Rodriguez
plays with grand but not pompous
gesture, bringing the piece into
full bloom.
The Fairfax Symphony, led by
William Hudson, offers compli
mentary accompaniment without
stealing the spotlight from Ro
driguez. Symphony and soloist
conscientiously achieve a balance
that doesn't hamper the flow of
the music.
Stanley Myers' "Cavatina," the
only solo piano piece on the pro
gram, is tossed off with an endear

ing simplicity. Rodriguez's tone
shines through the haunting
melody with a sense of longing and
nostalgia.
For serious classical music
lovers who snub "pop" classical
music, this album proves that non
traditional works can be immense
ly entertaining and satisfying if
done with impeccable taste and
care. This is a highly enjoyable disc
for the general public and piano
aficionados alike.
