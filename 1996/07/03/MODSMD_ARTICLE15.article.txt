## Exploded Drawing 
### 
If you've ever wondered what
guitars would say if they could
speak, Polvo might have an answer
for you. Guitarists Ash Bowie and
Dave Brylawski have an intuitive,
unique sense of melody and pro
duce an astounding palette of
sounds. Their guitars don't just
speak, they carry on entire conver
sations with each other.
On early releases, Polvo sound
ed mostly like a more melodic de
rivation of Sonic Youth, but they
soon developed an odd twang in
their strings that seems to be the
result of Middle Eastern and
Japanese musical influences.

I he guitars on rolvo s latest
album, "Exploded Drawing," are
the sonic equivalent of Silly Putty
— elastic and stringy while rigid
and choppy. Their song structures
are twisted in much the same fash
ion, marked by unexpected turns.
Anything can happen at any time,
and it usually does.
At 16 tracks and nearly 60 min
utes, "Exploded Drawing" is an ex
tremely ambitious release, and for
the most part its ambition is real
ized. From the loping, epic first
track, "Fast Canoe," the album
moves through a myriad of guitar
textures and tones; the twilight
cowboy jangle on "Light of the
Moon" gives way to the intense
but loony drives of "Crumbling
Down" and "Snowstorm in lowa,"
as well as the shuffling chimes of
"In This Life" and "Taste of Your
Mind."
There is a lot of filler to wade

through as well. A few short in
strumental sprinkled throughout
the album don't serve much pur
pose other than to provide down
time between tracks, but at least
they're not too intrusive. And the
grinding 12-minute closer, "When
Will You Die For The Last Time In
My Dreams," is twice as long as it
needs to be, but it still manages to
be mildly entertaining.
"Exploded Drawing" is exactly
the deconstructed guitar noodling
that you'd expect from the title. It
may seem unnecessarily messy
and complicated, but the parts fit
together perfectly like the pieces of
a jigsaw puzzle. If you're tired of
mediocre alt-rock-radio pabulum
and want something different, but
you still love the sound of guitars,
pick up "Exploded Drawing." Your
ears will thank you for it.
