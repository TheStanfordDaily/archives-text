# A 						slightly yuppie joint where the gumbo ain't got spice

Cafe de Orleans is the self-pro
claimed authentic Cajun hot spot
located at 1029 El Camino Real in
Menlo Park. It's a far cry from the
banks of the Bogne Chitto River,
the setting for the quaint menu
blurb which tells l'histoire of the
late Mama Green and speaks of
the Cajun lovin' she sprinkled on
everything she touched.
The setting of the restaurant is
pleasant. The walls are subtly lit
by a clever track-lighting system,
which is nice, but tres yuppie, mon
ami.

My friend and I were quickly
seated among the sparse Monday
night crowd. Our bread looked ex
citing and unconventional. It
proved bland, however, though it
appeared to have flecks of hot
chilies and spices. Indeed, the old
adage "appearances can be deceiv
ing" seemed to be the trend of the
evening.
The menu provides a copious
choice of Cajun staples and delica
cies, but the anticipation exceeded
the flavor of this expensive dinner.
We started off with the fried okra
touted as "a tasty surprise." The
appetizer arrived, pellets of okra

breaded in cornmeal (not quite
warm enough) on a bed of wilted
chicory with a sauce that resem
bled that Denny's staple, ranch
dressing.
Next was the salad de cafe, the
highlight of my meal. Made of
mixed greens, caramelized red
onions, garlic sautded mush
rooms, tomatoes and goat cheese
in a light vinaigrette, it was the
perfect mix of textures and tastes.
The problem was that it wasn't a
Cajun, lovin'-sprinkled, down
south salad. It was a perfect yup
pie concoction.
Our tardy entries were disap

pointing. The "Stroller," a taster
of "authentic Etoufee, Jambalaya,
File Gumbo and lied Beans and
Rice" did not live up to the hype.
The gumbo was not hearty
enough, and the kitchen skimped
on the crab and shrimp, filling in
with a less delicate sausage. The
jambalaya wasn't fresh. The beans
and rice were the best part of this
sampler, but not worth the pricey
tab. The "CdO" pasta was recom
mended as a shining example of
the restaurant's secret spices, and
although I am a curious eater, this
was one secret I was not interested
in knowing. Our entire meal was

not spicy at all.
For dessert we shared Bananas
Foster, not flambed as it should
have been, but a banana and ice
cream soup. The coffee was ab
solutely perfect, confirming my
view that perhaps they should
have created a yuppie kitchen
rather than an unsuccessful au
thentic Cajun house.
The meal was terribly disap
pointing. However, there are spe
cials on Sunday, Monday and
Tuesday, and music on the week
ends if you are still curious about
dining where "Mardi Gras never
ends."
