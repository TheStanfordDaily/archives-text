# Tyner, Coleman will bring sweet sounds to Stanford

### Seeta Gangadharan 
Summer finds Stanford differ
ent and unfamiliar â€” the transient
population of conference attendees
and camp participants, the sta
tionary resident summer or grad
uate students, and, of course, the
Stanford Jazz Workshop.
Founded in 1972 by Music Prof.
Jim Nadel, the Stanford Jazz
Workshop has established a world
wide reputation for its premier
summer jazz programs. It offers an
intensive, personally tailored jazz
course for advanced adult players
and young musicians. The faculty
over the years has come to include
jazz legends like Ray Brown and
Kenny Barron. This year legendary
pianist Mycoy Tyner, trumpeter
Clark Terry, alto saxophonist
Steve Coleman and a host of others
will be part of the experience.
As a nart of the Stanford Jazz

Workshop is the Stanford Jazz
Festival, a program which lasts
from July 5 to August 10 in which
over 30 concerts will be performed
on or around Stanford campus.
Among the highlights will be
Tyner and Terry.
Tyner will teach the adult and
advanced student instrumental
ists. Nadel commented, "We have
people who have been waiting 25
years to see Mycoy [TynerJ teach."
The public will have the opportu
nity to hear Tyner play on August
7 at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Also at Stanford this summer is
Terry, the trumpeter from Duke
Ellington's band. Like Tyner,
Terry will be offering workshops
for adult and advanced instru
mentalists. He will perform on Au
gust 5 in Dinkelspiel.
Other performers, such as fa
mous bassist Rufus Reid, will also
headline the jazz festival.

During those 30 ticketed per
formances there will be free per
formances almost every day on
campus by workshop participants.
Coleman, world famous alto saxo
phonist and workshop instructor,
will be leading free performances
in the Bay Area.
At Stanford, free performances
will take place at Tresidder Union.
From July 21 through August 10,
masters students and faculty will
be giving frequent (and free!) jams
at the Coffee House from 10 till
closing, following ticketed perfor
mances. In addition, advanced stu
dents will showcase their talents at
noontime concerts every Wednes
day and Friday from July 17 until
July 31, and then Monday through
Friday from August 5 until August
9 at the Coffee House.
The workshop also features stu
dent "happy hour performances"
behind the Coffee House from 4

p.m. to 6 p.m Monday through Fri
day in the last two weeks in July
and the last week in August.
In the Bay Area, Coleman will
be hosting a series of free concerts,
lectures, demonstrations and clin
ics in a community project that
brings jazz, hip hop, dance, an
cient afro-Cuban rhythms and rap
to disadvantaged neighborhoods.
Coleman explained, "[the] idea
is to work for community people by
working directly with them in the
community. The approach is to
play creative street music.. . and
show the links between this and
the music that we play."
The Stanford Jazz Workshop,
with its renowned reputation in
the musical world, would garner
as much attention by Stanford
students and the general public
alike. But attendance at these per
formances has been sporadic.
Nadel said, "Most students stum

ble upon the musical activities of
the workshop by accident. . .
there's so much going on at Stan
ford, it's easy to blink and miss
something."
Despite the accidental tourism
which afflicts the Stanford popu
lation, public reception is not as
much a concern as is the opportu
nity to perform publicly.
"No intelligent concert promot
er with a profit motive" would
plan concerts the way the Stan
ford Jazz Workshop does, Nadel
said. "You just wouldn't put 21
nights of consecutive jazz at a uni
versity campus during the sum
mer. But there is really an educa
tional focus here."
Students have the opportunity
to perform publicly and simulta
neously listen to famous jazz
artists. Both experiences are often
rare and hard to come by for aspir
ing musicians.
