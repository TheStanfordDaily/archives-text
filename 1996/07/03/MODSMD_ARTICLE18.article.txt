## Column Grace Wang Give TV its justice 
### 
ONE OF THE best shows
on television is "Law &
Order." Old episodes air
on A&E every night at 8 p.m.,
and I try to catch it every time
it's on — with a double-dip on
Wednesday when regular season
episodes are also on NBC. I guess
you could say I'm a fan. I started
watching accidentally. My televi
sion tastes usually run toward
sitcoms, Thursday night must
see-TV and all those other shows
that draw the big dorm lounge
crowds.
I don't watch — well, I didn't
watch dramas and certainly not
crime dramas telling the stories
of Irish-American and Italian-
American police detectives on
the tough streets of New York
City. I wasn't interested in ideal
istic prosecutors determined to
see justice done, whatever the
terms. But when I finally did get
a glimpse of the combination of
the two one late Friday night
(A&E shows reruns at midnight
every night, too —not that I get
to watch a lot of the late-night
episodes), I was hooked.
The concept for "Law &
Order" is pretty simple. The
opening dialogue frames the
show clearly. "In the criminal
justice system, the people are
represented by two groups, the
police...and the district attor
ney's office.. .These are their sto
ries," booms the voice-over. The
first half of the show is commit
ted to police work, the second to
the prosecution of those respon
sible for the crime. Most of the
cases are murders and I, in my
infinite credulity, find the detec
tive work and the legal cases fas
cinating.
A lot of things about the show
appeal to me — the name, for
one. "Law & Order" — the title
has a certain majestic, upper
case, big-thick-Russian-book ca
dence to it, like "Crime & Pun
ishment" or "War & Peace." The
show also exhibits slices of life
that I know nothing about (and
probably shouldn't be learning
about from a TV show, but oh
well).
Hard-nosed, recovering alco
holic police detectives who don't
mind being a little menacing to
get some information on a homi
cide? The police officers in the
sleepy suburb where I grew up
were more of an aesthetic patrol
than anything else ("We're
sorry, ma'am, but we've been
getting complaints about that
unsightly, inoperable car that
you have sitting in your front
yard"). Metropolitan New York
City streets? See sleepy suburb
above.
As fascinating as the police

detective work is, what is even
more interesting is the actual
prosecution of the criminals.
Most police crime shows end
when the suspect is caught. In
"Law & Order," the show is only
half through at that point. And
while the police detective work
may he impressive, the work
done by the district attorney's
office is truly cool. With their
quick thinking, crafty legal ma
neuvering and, most important
ly, their constant commitment
to justice, these calmly intense
figures are riveting on the
screen. They almost make a gal
want to become a lawyer. The
stories are almost never cut and
dry. Happy endings aren't the
norm (Hello, the show usually
starts off with that ultimate
mood killer, the murder). No
body's perfect, including the
good guys. I always turn off the
TV thinking our system may be
flawed, but it is the best one
around.
The producers and writers of
the show try to make it as true to
life as possible, often adapting
current events into the story
line. A recent episode I watched
combined two of this past year's
most sensational stories from
Harvard — Gina Grant, the
admit who killed her mom as a
young girl, and the student who
killed her roommate. While the
story of a girl who kills her room
mate is set at an exclusive, pri
vate university, it didn't exactly
start me looking over my shoul
der or anything.
I wonder how the show skew
ers or affects my perceptions of
reality. On the show, crime is an
ever-present element, as are
criminals. I'm living in East Palo
Alto for the summer. Do I think
more about East Palo Alto's high
murder rate from a few years
back? Do I double-check my
locks before I sit down to watch?
Am I jumpier when I hear shouts
outside?
Well, no. In fact, watching the
show makes me breathe a little
easier. No random crimes are
committed, and no lone single
women are attacked and mur
dered in their studios by com
plete strangers. Perhaps that is
the show's one flaw, that some
demands of reality are compro
mised by the demands of drama.
Still, each episode of "Law &
Order" does gives me plenty to
think about — police brutality,
the meaning of justice, fair trials
— at least until the next one
comes on.

Grace Wang, a communication
major, would like to be on the
show someday.
