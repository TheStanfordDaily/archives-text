## David Wolitz Are Jews Asian American? 
### 
Freshman year in okada,
one of my favorite games at
dinner was to try to convince
people that I, David Wolitz, was re
ally Asian American. I can't say that
I was ever all that successful, and
though most of my dormmates hu
mored me, some took real offense at
my attempt to jump inside the Asian
bandwagon. After all, I am a decid
edly "white"-looking Jewish guy
from Texas.
My argument was relatively sim
ple. First, I would point out that the
Jewish homeland, Israel, is in Asia
â€” a cheap shot, but undeniable
nonetheless. This usually elicited a
response .along the lines of, "But
that's not really Asia," to which I
would simply retort, "So where ex
actly is the 'real' Asia?" This got a
wide variety of answers; China,
Korea, and Japan always made it,
but it seemed that Asia always pe
tered out somewhere between the
Himalayas and the Indus. India was
a big question mark, but nothing
further west than Pakistan ever
made the cut. After a little bit of
prodding, it became clear that no
body had any principled way of
drawing a line between the "real"
Asia and the "technical" Asia.
I then challenged anyone to give
me a significant characteristic that
binds, say, Indian, Cambodian, and
Japanese Americans, but excludes
Jewish Americans. Let's see. Em
phasis on education? Jews have
that. Strong family ties? Check.
Honor thy mother and father? Yes.
Immigrant experience? Got that,
too. Faced discrimination when
they first arrived here? Yep. Have
been relatively successful economi
cally? Ditto. Occupy a dispropor
tionate percentage of elite educa
tional institutions relative to their
numbers in the general population?
Uh-huh. Heck, we even both love

Chinese food! By the time I finished
my shpiel, I had myself so convinced
that I would call for the immediate
integration of the Jewish Student
Association into the Asian Ameri
can Students Association.
But nobody would buy it. When
push came to shove, the reason was
simple: I didn't look "Asian." And
truth be told, I don't. According to
the American system of racial iden
tification, I am easily distinguish
able from a "real" Asian-American,
but practically indistinguishable
from a non-Jewish white guy. So, in
the end, what separates me from the
elusive Asian American label is my
skin color and facial features. Don't
get me wrong; I don't think this is a
trivial thing. The fact is that Asian-
Americans of all different national
origins have faced similar experi
ences in this country because they
"looked the same" to white (and
black) people.
The very fact that white Ameri
cans treated and continue to treat
all Asian Americans in a similar way
produced and continues to produce
solidarity between different nation
al origin groups that would other
wise have little or nothing to do with
each other. The American reduction
of everything to race means that
Cambodian and Japanese Ameri
cans are thrown together under the
term "Asian," and that French and
Jewish Americans are lumped to
gether under the even vaguer
"white." That this classification by
race is utterly senseless does not
stop it from having profound conse
quences, so I am certainly under
stand why 1 could not unilaterally
declare myself Asian American. The
fact is that, simply because of the
way I look, I can pass as white to an
extent that "real" Asian-Americans
cannot.
So, in the end, what does the

term Asian American really denote?
Let's face it, it is a racial term, and by
that, I mean it picks out a certain
group of people based on the way
they look. And how much of an im
provement is it over "Oriental"?
Well, the sad truth is that any label
used to describe a group of people
who face widespread prejudice will
eventually come to have a derogato
ry meaning. One need only trace the
lineage from Negro to African
American to see that. Even the word
"Jew" retains the tinge of conde
scension.
Hopefully, prejudice against
Asian Americans will wane to the
extent that the term "Asian Ameri
can" will never take on the deroga
tory status of "Oriental," but people
should not kid themselves into be
lieving that Asian American refers
to some organic ethnic unit. It refers
to a group of people that look alike
and have thus faced similar, though
by no means the same, experiences
in this country. The same goes, by
varying degrees, for the terms Na
tive American, African American,
Latino, and the ever-popular
"white." These are not ethnic desig
nations, as the University adminis
tration and the so-called ethnic cen
ters would like to think; these are
very crude racial designators, no dif
ferent in meaning (though quite dif
ferent in connotation) from Red,
Black, Brown, Yellow, and White.
No matter how much we might
want to fudge the issue, it's still
about physical appearance, and that
is precisely why so many people
have a hard time deciding whether
Indian Americans count as Asian
Americans; if Indian Americans
looked more Chinese, do you think
people would hesitate?
