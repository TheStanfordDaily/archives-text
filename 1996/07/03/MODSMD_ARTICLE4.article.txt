## Make a run for Borders 
### Liz Chien 
Is that the old Varsity Theater?
Well, yes and no. It is now the old
Varsity Theater, but it is no longer
closed, nor is it showing movies.
Instead, it is open and housing the
newest, hippest store on the lower
end of University Avenue — Bor
ders Books and Music.
Instead of destroying the Varsi
ty Theater, Borders restored it to
its original glory. The theater was
forced to close in 1994 due to safe
ty hazards. The Varsity Theater
was limping on its old structural
limbs and in need of renovation.
When Borders decided to make
the theater its new home in Palo
Alto, the company made sure that
the building was retrofitted and
completely safe.
Borders has returned the an
cient theater to its community.
"The courtyard and lobby are
exactly the same as in the 1940'5,"
said Jef Friedel, Borders' commu
nity relations coordinator. "Peo
ple would come and ask about the
new gold trim and engraving on
the columns, but it was all a part of
the original theater . . . people
seemed to have forgotten that
they were there."
The restoration was overseen
by the Palo Alto Historical Society.
"We didn't turn a stone without
talking to them," admitted
Friedel. In fact, one of the condi
tions for Borders to move into the
Varsity Theater was that if Bor
ders were to occupy the location, it
would have to restore the building
along its original lines.
This care has generated a posi
tive response from natives of Palo
Alto and visitors alike. Instead of
taking business away from local
merchants, Borders has energized
business on the lower end of Uni
versity Avenue, Friedel said.
Before Borders opened, "the
traffic lights would start blinking
yellow sometime around ten
o'clock," Friedel said. Now, people

are crowding and bustling about
that end of the street, whether
they are browsing in stores or en
joying a cup of espresso.
"Borders brings in a lot more
people into this bookstore and has
really done a lot for business at
this side of University," said Lee
Masullo, owner of Megabooks.
This general satisfaction can also
be attributed to Borders' eclectic
collection of books and music and
the quaint cafe that sits in front of
the store.

One of the reasons Borders de
cided to open a branch in Palo Alto
was the dedication of people here
to books and the arts.
"This is a reading community
with a high income and education
level. We usually do very well in
those type of places," Friedel said.
Borders was conceived by
brothers Tom and Louis, who
wanted to start a bookstore de
voted to readers who take their
time looking at the literary selec
tions.

chain bookstore recently opened in the space formerly occupied
by the Varsity Theater.
