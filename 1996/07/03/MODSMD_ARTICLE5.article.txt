Computer security officials are warning anyone
who has logged into a machine "on subnets 10 or 6"
in the Durand building between noon on June 19
and 6 p.m. on June 27 that their e-mail accounts
and passwords may have been captured by an un
known hacker.
Stephen Hansen, computer security officer in
Sweet Hall, posted an advisory this week over e-mail.
He warned that anyone who has used the system in
Durand should "change [their] passwords immedi
ately! If you're not sure, change them anyway."
Many users may have noticed the advisory upon
opening their e-mail accounts this week. "I tried to

distribute it as widespread as possible," Hansen
said of the advisory.
On June 19, an intruder broke into the network
and installed various "trojan horse programs" and a
"network sniffer." Until they were detected last Fri
day, these programs collected a user's first 4,096 key
strokes which were then off-loaded from the Durand
system. As a result, the intruder was able to gather
an unknown number of accounts and passwords.
Anyone who suspects that their accounts were
broken into should contact their systems adminis
trators.
