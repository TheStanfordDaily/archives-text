# Med Center may pull out of merger
## Casper threatens to end negotiations 
### Jeremy Desmon Editorial staff 
In a recent letter to UC Presi
dent Richard Atkinson, Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper said
that if a satisfactory agreement
concerning the proposed Stanford
Medical Center and UC-San Fran
cisco merger were not reached by
the middle of this month, Stan
ford was "fully prepared" to pull
out of the negotiations.
The merger — which would
join both UC-San Francisco's and
Stanford Medical Center's hospi
tals and clinics into a single, non
profit enterprise — was officially
announced last November but has
been under discussion for more
than a year. Casper's letter, sent
last week, emphasized the impor
tance of resolving the issue as
quickly as possible.
"We at Stanford have post
poned very important recruit
ments and capital investments
pending the outcome of the merg
er discussions," Casper wrote.
"We cannot delay much further on
these matters."

In recent months, the UC
Board of Regents has raised con
cerns over whether or not the non
profit corporation that would gov
ern the new organization should
be private or state run. Casper's
letter makes it clear that if the
new organization is not a private
corporation, Stanford will not
continue negotiations.
"Rather than enter into a
quasi-state entity, Stanford would
end the negotiations and remain
separate," Casper wrote.
Casper emphasized that "acad
emic and management leaders
[must be] included at the top of
[the organization's] governance
structure. My feelings on this
point are strong . . . because the
flexibility of a private organiza
tion is fundamental to success in
the current marketplace."
Casper said a mid-July agree
ment is essential to keep the dis
cussions alive. "After traveling so
far," he wrote, "I am disheartened
by the prospect of turning back.
However, if it is in Stanford's best
interest, I am fully prepared to do
so."
