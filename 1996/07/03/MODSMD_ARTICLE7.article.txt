# CS professor granted Japanese tech award

### Jeremy Desmon Editorial staff 
Computer Science Professor
Emeritus Donald Knuth last
week was named one of three re
cipients of Japan's prestigious
Kyoto Prize. Knuth, 58, will re
ceive the award in the category of
Advanced Technology.

The award,
given by the In
amori Founda
tion and consid
ered Japan's
equivalent of the
Pulitzer Prize,
carries with it a
cash prize of 50
million yen —
approximately
$460,000.

Knuth s lifetime achieve
ments include "The Art of Com
puter Programming," a three
volume work that has helped pop
ularize computer programming
as a science. According to the In
amori Foundation, the work is
considered by computer pro
grammers to he both the "Bible
and Encyclopedia of Computer
Science."
Vaughan Pratt, a professor of
computer science at Stanford,
was one of Knuth's students in
the early 19705. "|His books]
have helped to define the area of
the analysis of algorithms and to

make people feel that it really was
a subject," Pratt said.
The pre-eminent computer
scientist's work has ranged from
theory to implementation. Knuth
developed breakthrough applica
tions in the area of computer
typesetting with programs such
as TeX. TeX is currently the pre
eminent publishing system for
mathematics.
"There really isn't any system
that comes close to touching it
these days," Pratt said.
Knuth, whom Byte Magazine
recently honored as one of the
"20 Most Important People" who
have had the greatest impact on
microcomputing, will receive the
award during ceremonies to be
held November 9-12 in Kyoto,
Japan. Along with the cash prize,
Knuth will receive a diploma and
a commemorative gold Kyoto
Prize medal from the Inamori
Foundation.
This year's awards are the
first time that all three awards
were given to Americans since
the creation of the Kyoto Prize in
1984. The other award winners
this year include Mario Renato
Kapecchi, world-renowned mole
cular geneticist and a professor at
the University of Utah in Salt
Lake City, and Willard Van
Orman Quine, philosopher and
professor emeritus at Harvard
University.
