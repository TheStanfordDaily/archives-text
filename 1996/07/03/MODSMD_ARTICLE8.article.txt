## Live-in counselors call the Bridge their home 
### Chad Bennett Editorial staff 
When recent graduate Emily
Dossett tells her friends that this
summer she is living at the Bridge,
Stanford's peer counseling center,
she is most commonly met with dis
belief. "People are always floored
when I tell them about it," said Dos
sett, one of five Stanford peer coun
selors calling the Bridge home this
summer.
In exchange for free housing, the
five students — who moved in grad
uation weekend — man the phone
lines from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. every
night.
According to live-in counselor
l/)ren Mell, the Bridge is not as odd
a residence as one may think. "It's a
really peaceful place," he said. "A lot
of people like to just come here and
hang out."
Besides serenity and free hous
ing, Mell and his fellow counselors
listed several reasons for living at
the Bridge.
"During the summer it's much
more quiet," said Maitraya Patel, a
junior, notingthatduringthe school
year, calls to the Bridge are more
frequent.
"There's more responsibility
during the year; now we're more
just groundskeepers," said Patel.
Joy Chen, a senior, agreed. "I'm
going to be a live-in next year, so I
thought it would be a good experi
ence to be here during the summer
and ease into it," she said.
According to Dossett, another
reason to live at the Bridge Ls com
mitment to volunteer work. Al
though Dossett joked that the typi
cal inhabitant of the Bridge is simply
"poor, a freeloader and pre-med,"
she sees an interest in service as the
true common point of live-in coun

selors.
According to Mell, however, ser
vice isn't the only thing counselors
have in common. "Most people here
are nice," said Mell. "I haven't met
too many assholes at the Bridge."
Minor disad vantages
Despite the abundance of "nice"
people, life at the Bridge is not with
out its disadvantages. Late-night
calls are answered by the counselor
on duty, who is most likely asleep.
"So if you want to call, think real
ly hard — 'How bad is my prob
lem?"' Dossett joked.
In addition, while accommoda
tions at the Bridge — which include
three bedrooms, a kitchen, and

cable TV — are generally good, the
showers leave a little to be desired.
"It's kind of like summer camp,"
said Dossett.
"Yeah, there's a hose out back,"
Mell added, jokingly.
Another disadvantage to living at
the Bridge is ghosts, or what Dossett
terms "Bridge folklore."
"Supposedly the Bridge was a
professor's house," said Dossett.
"He gave it to the University, and
there's a ghost story connected to
it."
According to Dossett, the "ghost
story" involves the suicide of the
professor's son, whose ghost now
haunts the Bridge. "No one's ever
seen a ghost, but it does sort of enter

your mind when you're walking up
the back stairway at 2 a.m.," said
Dossett.
Outreach biggest goal
According to the live-ins, howev
er, a more realistic worry is the mis
perception of the Bridge as a "gra
nola-hippie-touchy-feely-talk-to-
me" kind of place.
"There may be a stigma with
using the Bridge," said Mell, "[butl
you can be a regular person and just
want to talk to someone who has no
vested interest."
"The Bridge is set up for people in
the Stanford community or [those]
just connected to Stanford," added
Mell. "It's for [when] they have

problems they want to talk about,
which maybe they can't talk about
with their friends."
"I think a misperception is that
the only skill counselors at the
Bridge have is to repeat what you're
saying," Mell added. "You know,
'Oh, so you're saying ..then you
say exactly what the caller just
said."
Junior Tracy Jan and the other
counselors were quick to point out,
however, that this technique, while
not the only skill they possess, is ef
fective.
"When I was in peer counseling
class, I was kind of weirded out by
the technique. But after seeing it
used, it really does work," said Jan.
Patel agreed. "The training is for
a one-time conversation with a
stranger — someone you don't
know anything about.... We're ba
sically just a sounding board so peo
pie can hear their own voices. That
helps a lot."
"The Bridge is more crisis inter
vention and information referral.
We're not set up for advice or ongo
ing counseling," Jan added.
According to Chen, the counsel
ing services offered by the Bridge
are underused, especially consider
ing the high pressure atmosphere i n
which Stanford students exist.
"At Stanford there's a lot of pres
sure to just be the best. It's hard. A
lot of people are unwilling to admit
that they can't," said Chen, who
sees outreach as the Bridge's biggest
goal.
"In society in general, mental
health is not something that's talked
about," she added. "When you say
mental health you think, 'Oh, schiz
ophrenic, or depression,' and it's
something we shy away from.... It
makes it hard to get the Bridge out
in the Stanford community."
