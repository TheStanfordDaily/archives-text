## On to the Olympics 
### David Wolitz Editorial staff 
Stanford gymnasts are headed
to the Olympics again after the
dramatic and sometimes heart
wrenching Olympic Trials last
weekend in Boston's Fleet Center.
Saturday saw the completion of
the unusually mistake-riddled
men's trials. Over half of the top
seven competitors, those that get
to go to the Olympics, fell during
their routines at least once. Stan
ford's Jair Lynch, who finished in
sixth place, fell twice off of the hor
izontal bar, but recovered each
time to salvage his Olympic
dreams. Coached by Stanford
coach Sadao Hamada, Lynch fin
ished with a combined score of
222.598, good enough to earn him
a trip to Atlanta.
Josh Stein, who graduated from
Stanford in 1994, just missed the
Olympic team by .584 points, fin
ishing eighth out of the field. He,
too, fell off of the horizontal bar,
but rallied to stay in seventh place.
However, after slipping off of the
pommel horse late in the competi
tion, his hopes were dashed.
The women's trials provided

equal amounts of drama, though a
much happier ending for two fu
ture Stanford students. Do
minique Dawes and Amy Chow,
who will both be freshman at Stan
ford this fall, finished fourth and
sixth place, respectively, meaning
they will spend their pre-freshman
year summer competing in the
Olympic Games in Atlanta. Dawes
turned in a characteristically solid
performance and never lost her
spot near the top of the field.
Chow's trip to Atlanta seemed
assured as she started her last ro
tation on the balance beam, but
then the unexpected happened. On
one of a series of backward flips,
her foot slipped, sending her head
slamming into the beam. A tense
moment followed as she struggled
to regain her composure and re
start her routine in the required
10 seconds. Breathing deeply,
Chow hopped back onto the beam
and completed her routine perfect
ly, nailing her three roughest
moves and insuring her spot on
the Olympic team. Had she not
completed her routine, she would
have lost her position in the top
seven and her place on the
Olympic team.
