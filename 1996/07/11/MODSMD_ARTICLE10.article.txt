# Doctors refuse to let sleeping dogs lie
## Ongoing studies at the Stanford University Sleep Disorders Research Center give scientists clues to the cause of chronic sleepiness in humans

Imagine falling asleep at the sight of a
delicious pizza. While most people ex
perience loss of control over their bod
ies only in nightmares, it is a serious hand
icap for about one out of every 2,000
American, European and Japanese people
who suffer from a disorder called nar
colepsy.
Narcolepsy is a sleeping disorder that af
fects the rapid-eye-movement (REM) phas
es of sleep. Normally, REM takes place in
about 20 to 22 percent of nighttime sleep
and alternates with non-REM phases. A
characteristic for REM-sleep is a high cen
tral nervous activity combined with a loss of
control over body muscles.
In order to understand the disease and
to find relief against daytime sleepiness,
sudden loss of muscle control (cataplexy)
and other symptoms, researchers at Stan
ford Medici Center study a population of
narcoleptic Dobermans. A colony of nar
coleptic Dobermans was first bred some 20
years ago by William Dement, director of

the Stanford University Sleep Disorders
Research Center.
Results of recent studies published over
the last two years have led to the discovery
of neurotransmitters that are involved in
triggering cataplectic attacks and to a new
hypothesis of a connection between the im
mune system and the regulation of a certain
form of sleep.
Emmanuel Mignot, director of the nar
colepsy center, pointed out that "the fre
quency of narcolepsy in the [human| popu
lation is similar to that of multiple sclero
sis." Like many scientific research groups,
however, the Basic Research Center for
Narcolepsy, a division sleep center in the
School of Medicine, suffers from funding
difficulties.
Until recently, the impact of narcolepsy
has been underestimated. According to an
article in The New York Times last month,
women were not diagnosed with the dis
ease until they started to work outside the
home.

A type of sleep
In narcoleptic individuals, the loss of con
trol over body muscles seems to be triggered
very easily, and REM-like traits occur dur
ing the daytime, especially after emotional
stimuli. In addition to occasional attacks of
cataplexy, patients are generally more tired
than unaffected people.
On his World Wide Web page, Mignot
states, "Our goal is to unravel the cause of
narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by
sleepiness and abnormal REM sleep. Our
research is facilitated by the existence of a
canine model of the disorder." This "canine
model" is the colony of narcoleptic Dober
mans, which is used for studies in the nar
colepsy center.
"The narcoleptic dogs are generally more
tired than healthy dogs and you can quickly
distinguish them just by observing their be
havior" said Jeff Shelton, a researcher at
the center who conducts most of the studies
on the dogs.
It is challenging to breed dogs who react

with cataplectic attacks to excitement
"Two people have to hold the male dogs din
ing breeding. They have to be held during
their cataplectic attacks until they wake up
and can continue," Shelton said.
Artificial insemination is also used tc
generate offspring, but that is also rathei
difficult. "We use material from othei
colonies for the insemination to prevent toe
much inbreeding," Mignot said.
Physiological differences
Recent publications from the sleep cen
ter have described the identification of the
main physiological differences between nar
coleptic and normal dogs. Researchers
found that the concentration of the neuro
transmitter acetylcholine in a certain pari
of the brain increased by 50 percent aftei
four cataplectic attacks. The attacks were
triggered by exciting the dogs with food. In
normal dogs, food did not increase the re
lease of this neurotransmitter.
In addition, affected dogs seemed to have
an increased number of acetylcholine-recep
tors and are therefore more sensitive to a
given dose of the neurotransmitter. A syn
thetic drug called carbachol that is similar
to acetylcholine was injected into two differ
ent areas of the brain of healthy and nar
coleptic dogs. In narcoleptic dogs, the degree
of cataplexy increased with the dose of the
drug, whereas healthy dogs only had minor
reactions to the highest dose. In fact, low
doses of carbachol injected into one part of
the brain even caused wakefulness in con
trol dogs. Such a reaction is thought to be
the normal effect of emotional excitation.
A similar system of injections into freely
moving narcoleptic dogs is also used to
study compounds that can suppress cata
plexy. The goal of these studies is to find a
very specific drug that can be used to treat
narcolepsy in humans.
"Currently we are testing a drug against
narcolepsy that is already released for hu
mans in France," said Shelton, who started
to work in the facility in his senior year as an
undergraduate. "Here in the United States,
the regulations are much more strict, and
we have to conduct all the testing again .The
drug [modafmil] was actually bought from a
French company for the research."
Genetic differences
The basis for narcolepsy is still uncer
tain. In Dobermans as well as in Labradors,
narcolepsy is determined by a single reces
sive gene called "canarc-1." This gene has
not been isolated yet in dogs or in humans.
According to Mignot, "The main project
right now is the isolation and the exact loca
tion" of the responsible gene in dogs, "which
should locate at an equivalent site in the
human genome."
However, in humans the possession of a
specific gene is not sufficient to develop the
disease. "Only 10 to 20 percent of monozy
gotic twins are concordant for narcolepsy
and in addition to the genetic predisposi
tion, environmental stimuli are probably
also required to trigger the illness," Mignot
said. This means that if one twin of a set of
identical twins has narcolepsy, the sibling
has it in only 20 percent of the cases.
In humans as well as in dogs, the expres
sion of narcolepsy has been linked to the
presence of specific variances of genes, or al-
