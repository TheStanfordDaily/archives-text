# Doctors refuse to let sleeping dogs lie
## Ongoing studies at the Stanford University Sleep Disorders Research Center give scientists clues to the cause of chronic sleepiness in humans 
### Catharina Casper-Lindley 
Imagine falling asleep at the sight of a
delicious pizza. While most people ex
perience loss of control over their bod
ies only in nightmares, it is a serious hand
icap for about one out of every 2,000
American, European and Japanese people
who suffer from a disorder called nar
colepsy.
Narcolepsy is a sleeping disorder that af
fects the rapid-eye-movement (REM) phas
es of sleep. Normally, REM takes place in
about 20 to 22 percent of nighttime sleep
and alternates with non-REM phases. A
characteristic for REM-sleep is a high cen
tral nervous activity combined with a loss of
control over body muscles.
In order to understand the disease and
to find relief against daytime sleepiness,
sudden loss of muscle control (cataplexy)
and other symptoms, researchers at Stan
ford Medici Center study a population of
narcoleptic Dobermans. A colony of nar
coleptic Dobermans was first bred some 20
years ago by William Dement, director of

the Stanford University Sleep Disorders
Research Center.
Results of recent studies published over
the last two years have led to the discovery
of neurotransmitters that are involved in
triggering cataplectic attacks and to a new
hypothesis of a connection between the im
mune system and the regulation of a certain
form of sleep.
Emmanuel Mignot, director of the nar
colepsy center, pointed out that "the fre
quency of narcolepsy in the [human| popu
lation is similar to that of multiple sclero
sis." Like many scientific research groups,
however, the Basic Research Center for
Narcolepsy, a division sleep center in the
School of Medicine, suffers from funding
difficulties.
Until recently, the impact of narcolepsy
has been underestimated. According to an
article in The New York Times last month,
women were not diagnosed with the dis
ease until they started to work outside the
home.

A type of sleep
In narcoleptic individuals, the loss of con
trol over body muscles seems to be triggered
very easily, and REM-like traits occur dur
ing the daytime, especially after emotional
stimuli. In addition to occasional attacks of
cataplexy, patients are generally more tired
than unaffected people.
On his World Wide Web page, Mignot
states, "Our goal is to unravel the cause of
narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by
sleepiness and abnormal REM sleep. Our
research is facilitated by the existence of a
canine model of the disorder." This "canine
model" is the colony of narcoleptic Dober
mans, which is used for studies in the nar
colepsy center.
"The narcoleptic dogs are generally more
tired than healthy dogs and you can quickly
distinguish them just by observing their be
havior" said Jeff Shelton, a researcher at
the center who conducts most of the studies
on the dogs.
It is challenging to breed dogs who react

with cataplectic attacks to excitement
"Two people have to hold the male dogs din
ing breeding. They have to be held during
their cataplectic attacks until they wake up
and can continue," Shelton said.
Artificial insemination is also used tc
generate offspring, but that is also rathei
difficult. "We use material from othei
colonies for the insemination to prevent toe
much inbreeding," Mignot said.
Physiological differences
Recent publications from the sleep cen
ter have described the identification of the
main physiological differences between nar
coleptic and normal dogs. Researchers
found that the concentration of the neuro
transmitter acetylcholine in a certain pari
of the brain increased by 50 percent aftei
four cataplectic attacks. The attacks were
triggered by exciting the dogs with food. In
normal dogs, food did not increase the re
lease of this neurotransmitter.
In addition, affected dogs seemed to have
an increased number of acetylcholine-recep
tors and are therefore more sensitive to a
given dose of the neurotransmitter. A syn
thetic drug called carbachol that is similar
to acetylcholine was injected into two differ
ent areas of the brain of healthy and nar
coleptic dogs. In narcoleptic dogs, the degree
of cataplexy increased with the dose of the
drug, whereas healthy dogs only had minor
reactions to the highest dose. In fact, low
doses of carbachol injected into one part of
the brain even caused wakefulness in con
trol dogs. Such a reaction is thought to be
the normal effect of emotional excitation.
A similar system of injections into freely
moving narcoleptic dogs is also used to
study compounds that can suppress cata
plexy. The goal of these studies is to find a
very specific drug that can be used to treat
narcolepsy in humans.
"Currently we are testing a drug against
narcolepsy that is already released for hu
mans in France," said Shelton, who started
to work in the facility in his senior year as an
undergraduate. "Here in the United States,
the regulations are much more strict, and
we have to conduct all the testing again .The
drug [modafmil] was actually bought from a
French company for the research."
Genetic differences
The basis for narcolepsy is still uncer
tain. In Dobermans as well as in Labradors,
narcolepsy is determined by a single reces
sive gene called "canarc-1." This gene has
not been isolated yet in dogs or in humans.
According to Mignot, "The main project
right now is the isolation and the exact loca
tion" of the responsible gene in dogs, "which
should locate at an equivalent site in the
human genome."
However, in humans the possession of a
specific gene is not sufficient to develop the
disease. "Only 10 to 20 percent of monozy
gotic twins are concordant for narcolepsy
and in addition to the genetic predisposi
tion, environmental stimuli are probably
also required to trigger the illness," Mignot
said. This means that if one twin of a set of
identical twins has narcolepsy, the sibling
has it in only 20 percent of the cases.
In humans as well as in dogs, the expres
sion of narcolepsy has been linked to the
presence of specific variances of genes, or al-

leles, that are involved in the immune sys
tem. Alleles differ among individuals, and
various populations have different fre
quencies of specific alleles. In humans, an
allele of a gene that codes for pivotal pro
teins in the immune system (MCH) is
linked to the manifestation of narcolepsy.
"In 90 to 95 percent of Caucasians and in
all African Americans, narcolepsy is associ
ated with a certain allele of this gene,"
Mignot said. In the normal populations, this
gene only occurs in 8 to 35 percent of people.
By comparing different populations, re
searchers had previously eliminated the as
sociation with a different allele that is asso
ciated with narcolepsy only in Asian and
Caucasian populations, but had a poor cor
relation in African Americans.
The kind of gene that is linked to nar
colepsy in dogs is different from the linked
gene in humans. In dogs, "canarc-1" is
linked to a gene that is similar to a human
gene involved in the immune system called
"S(i." The linking of MCH and Sfi-like genes
to narcolepsy in humans and dogs respec
tively suggests that the immune system is
somehow involved in the triggering of nar
colepsy. However, not much more is known
at present.
"Usually, a link to the immune system
suggests that an auto-immune reaction is in
volved in the disease," Mignot said. An auto
immune disease would cause damage in the
affected parts of the brain but "we have not
found any damage in brains of narcoleptic
individuals," he added.
Suffering from a cold at the time of the in
terview, Mignot remarked, "You see, I am
much more tired than usual." This is in
agreement with a current hypothesis that
the immune system and sleep regulation
may be connected through yet unidentified
pathways. When the immune system is more
active than usual, as when someone is sick,
sleepiness may be triggered more easily. The
center will conduct more experiments to clar

ify the relationship between the im

mune system arid narcolep
sy-

"We started experiments to transplant
bone marrow from homozygous [narcolep
tic! dogs into heterozygous (normal] dogs,"
Mignot said.
White blood cells, an integral part of the
immune system, are synthesized in the bone
marrow. "The transplants have to be done
after the dogs are five months old. But the
problem is that the symptoms often develop
before the fifth month of age, and the exper
iments will be very difficult."
If genetic changes in the immune system
are responsible for the expression of nar
colepsy, the symptoms will occur in the het
erozygous dogs after the transplantation.
Such a result would reveal a very novel find

ing that the immune
system extends its ef
fect into the brain and
influences neuro
transmitters.
"Previously it was
thought that the
brain is isolated from
the immune system,"
Mignot explained,
and the Finding of ef
fects of the immune
system on the brain
would be "a major
breakthrough."

A type of sleep
In narcoleptic individuals, the loss of con
trol over body muscles seems to be triggered
very easily, and REM-like traits occur dur
ing the daytime, especially after emotional
stimuli. In addition to occasional attacks of
cataplexy, patients are generally more tired
than unaffected people.
On his World Wide Web page, Mignot
states, "Our goal is to unravel the cause of
narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by
sleepiness and abnormal REM sleep. Our
research is facilitated by the existence of a
canine model of the disorder." This "canine
model" is the colony of narcoleptic Dober
mans, which is used for studies in the nar
colepsy center.
"The narcoleptic dogs are generally more
tired than healthy dogs and you can quickly
distinguish them just by observing their be
havior" said Jeff Shelton, a researcher at
the center who conducts most of the studies
on the dogs.
It is challenging to breed dogs who react

with cataplectic attacks to excitement
"Two people have to hold the male dogs din
ing breeding. They have to be held during
their cataplectic attacks until they wake up
and can continue," Shelton said.
Artificial insemination is also used tc
generate offspring, but that is also rathei
difficult. "We use material from othei
colonies for the insemination to prevent toe
much inbreeding," Mignot said.
Physiological differences
Recent publications from the sleep cen
ter have described the identification of the
main physiological differences between nar
coleptic and normal dogs. Researchers
found that the concentration of the neuro
transmitter acetylcholine in a certain pari
of the brain increased by 50 percent aftei
four cataplectic attacks. The attacks were
triggered by exciting the dogs with food. In
normal dogs, food did not increase the re
lease of this neurotransmitter.
In addition, affected dogs seemed to have
an increased number of acetylcholine-recep
tors and are therefore more sensitive to a
given dose of the neurotransmitter. A syn
thetic drug called carbachol that is similar
to acetylcholine was injected into two differ
ent areas of the brain of healthy and nar
coleptic dogs. In narcoleptic dogs, the degree
of cataplexy increased with the dose of the
drug, whereas healthy dogs only had minor
reactions to the highest dose. In fact, low
doses of carbachol injected into one part of
the brain even caused wakefulness in con
trol dogs. Such a reaction is thought to be
the normal effect of emotional excitation.
A similar system of injections into freely
moving narcoleptic dogs is also used to
study compounds that can suppress cata
plexy. The goal of these studies is to find a
very specific drug that can be used to treat
narcolepsy in humans.
"Currently we are testing a drug against
narcolepsy that is already released for hu
mans in France," said Shelton, who started
to work in the facility in his senior year as an
undergraduate. "Here in the United States,
the regulations are much more strict, and
we have to conduct all the testing again .The
drug [modafmil] was actually bought from a
French company for the research."
Genetic differences
The basis for narcolepsy is still uncer
tain. In Dobermans as well as in Labradors,
narcolepsy is determined by a single reces
sive gene called "canarc-1." This gene has
not been isolated yet in dogs or in humans.
According to Mignot, "The main project
right now is the isolation and the exact loca
tion" of the responsible gene in dogs, "which
should locate at an equivalent site in the
human genome."
However, in humans the possession of a
specific gene is not sufficient to develop the
disease. "Only 10 to 20 percent of monozy
gotic twins are concordant for narcolepsy
and in addition to the genetic predisposi
tion, environmental stimuli are probably
also required to trigger the illness," Mignot
said. This means that if one twin of a set of
identical twins has narcolepsy, the sibling
has it in only 20 percent of the cases.
In humans as well as in dogs, the expres
sion of narcolepsy has been linked to the
presence of specific variances of genes, or al-

leles, that are involved in the immune sys
tem. Alleles differ among individuals, and
various populations have different fre
quencies of specific alleles. In humans, an
allele of a gene that codes for pivotal pro
teins in the immune system (MCH) is
linked to the manifestation of narcolepsy.
"In 90 to 95 percent of Caucasians and in
all African Americans, narcolepsy is associ
ated with a certain allele of this gene,"
Mignot said. In the normal populations, this
gene only occurs in 8 to 35 percent of people.
By comparing different populations, re
searchers had previously eliminated the as
sociation with a different allele that is asso
ciated with narcolepsy only in Asian and
Caucasian populations, but had a poor cor
relation in African Americans.
The kind of gene that is linked to nar
colepsy in dogs is different from the linked
gene in humans. In dogs, "canarc-1" is
linked to a gene that is similar to a human
gene involved in the immune system called
"S(i." The linking of MCH and Sfi-like genes
to narcolepsy in humans and dogs respec
tively suggests that the immune system is
somehow involved in the triggering of nar
colepsy. However, not much more is known
at present.
"Usually, a link to the immune system
suggests that an auto-immune reaction is in
volved in the disease," Mignot said. An auto
immune disease would cause damage in the
affected parts of the brain but "we have not
found any damage in brains of narcoleptic
individuals," he added.
Suffering from a cold at the time of the in
terview, Mignot remarked, "You see, I am
much more tired than usual." This is in
agreement with a current hypothesis that
the immune system and sleep regulation
may be connected through yet unidentified
pathways. When the immune system is more
active than usual, as when someone is sick,
sleepiness may be triggered more easily. The
center will conduct more experiments to clar

ify the relationship between the im

mune system arid narcolep

"We started experiments to transplant
bone marrow from homozygous [narcolep
tic! dogs into heterozygous (normal] dogs,"
Mignot said.
White blood cells, an integral part of the
immune system, are synthesized in the bone
marrow. "The transplants have to be done
after the dogs are five months old. But the
problem is that the symptoms often develop
before the fifth month of age, and the exper
iments will be very difficult."
If genetic changes in the immune system
are responsible for the expression of nar
colepsy, the symptoms will occur in the het
erozygous dogs after the transplantation.
Such a result would reveal a very novel find

ing that the immune
system extends its ef
fect into the brain and
influences neuro
transmitters.
"Previously it was
thought that the
brain is isolated from
the immune system,"
Mignot explained,
and the Finding of ef
fects of the immune
system on the brain
would be "a major
breakthrough."

Emotionally stimulated by the food in front of it, this narcoleptic Doberman experiences an attack of
cataplexy, the sudden loss of muscle control. Muscle tone and eye movement — as measured by the
electromyogram (EMG) and the electrooculargram (EOG), respectively — decrease sharply as the at
tack begins.
Imagine falling asleep at the sight of a
delicious pizza. While most people ex
perience loss of control over their bod
ies only in nightmares, it is a serious hand
icap for about one out of every 2,000
American, European and Japanese people
who suffer from a disorder called nar
colepsy.
Narcolepsy is a sleeping disorder that af
fects the rapid-eye-movement (REM) phas
es of sleep. Normally, REM takes place in
about 20 to 22 percent of nighttime sleep
and alternates with non-REM phases. A
characteristic for REM-sleep is a high cen
tral nervous activity combined with a loss of
control over body muscles.
In order to understand the disease and
to find relief against daytime sleepiness,
sudden loss of muscle control (cataplexy)
and other symptoms, researchers at Stan
ford Medici Center study a population of
narcoleptic Dobermans. A colony of nar
coleptic Dobermans was first bred some 20
years ago by William Dement, director of

the Stanford University Sleep Disorders
Research Center.
Results of recent studies published over
the last two years have led to the discovery
of neurotransmitters that are involved in
triggering cataplectic attacks and to a new
hypothesis of a connection between the im
mune system and the regulation of a certain
form of sleep.
Emmanuel Mignot, director of the nar
colepsy center, pointed out that "the fre
quency of narcolepsy in the [human| popu
lation is similar to that of multiple sclero
sis." Like many scientific research groups,
however, the Basic Research Center for
Narcolepsy, a division sleep center in the
School of Medicine, suffers from funding
difficulties.
Until recently, the impact of narcolepsy
has been underestimated. According to an
article in The New York Times last month,
women were not diagnosed with the dis
ease until they started to work outside the
home.
