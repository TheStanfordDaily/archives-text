## METALLICA Load 
### 
It's not good to fix something
that isn't broken. In the 80s, Coca
cola replaced "classic" Coke with
New Coke, and any bloke could
have sniffed out this marketing
failure.
Likewise, the new Metallica
album "Load" features a new logo,
new haircuts, new clothes, and
more importantly, a new sound.
Hopefully for Metallica fans every
where, this is a cheap marketing
ploy designed to make fans appre
ciate the clean, electrifying sound
of "classic" Metallica.
Gone are the riveting,
blitzkrieg Metallica dirges of yes
teryear. The deathly bass drums,
changing time signatures, 10-
minute anthems and enchanting
hooks and riffs are all but missing
on the new album. More impor
tantly, Kirk Hammet's signature
guitar solos, like the sonorous
"Orion" on "Master of Puppets,"

and Jason Newsted's en
trancing bass lines cease
to exist here.
Instead, what we get is
an album filled with glitz
and glam. Unlike the
timeless Metallica lyrics of
"One" and "Sanitarium,"
the lyrics on "Load" are
meaningless and impo
tent. "Mama Said," a
slow, sensitive song dedi
cated to mothers, is a piti
ful teaijerker. Meanwhile,
songs like "2 X 4" and
"Ain't My Bitch" are full
of sonic intensity, but
their eagerness to prove
that they haven't lost
their edge makes these
two songs seem insincere
and ostentatious.
Metallica's strong suit
was never James Het
field's voice. But on their
"black" album, his deli
cate, sonorous touch on
"Nothing Else Matters"
and"The Unforgiven"
made his vocals a welcome
part of Metallica's musical
repertoire. Unfortunate-

ly, on "Load," Hetfield reverts
back to his old ways as his menac
ing growl floods the album, evok
ing painful images of Brian John
son's (of AC/DC) awful, ear-pierc
ing shrill.
Nevertheless, Metallica de
serves credit where credit is due.
"Wasting My Hate" is vintage
Metallica as the drums, guitars
and vocals combine to produce a
terrorizing, earth-shaking jam.
Meanwhile, "Until it Sleeps" is a
haunting but catchy song, making
it a favorite on radio station play
lists.
In a rock genre filled with
clich6-ridden poseurs like Green
Day and Bush, it is important to
come up with something original
and invigorating. But Metallica's
new look, new feel, new logo and
new sound are nothing more than
change for the sake of change. No
body can pull off Metallica like
Metallica can. For now, "Load" is
an acceptable pacifier of our thirst
for Metallica, and in the meantime
fans will be waiting anxiously for
the return of "classic" Metallica.
