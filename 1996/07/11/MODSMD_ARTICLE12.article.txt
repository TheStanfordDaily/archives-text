# ANTON KUERTI
## Russian Piano Musk 
### 
The most prominent Canadian
pianist after Glenn Gould, Anton
Kuerti has proven himself to be
quite at ease with Viennese and
Germanic classics, having record
ed a substantial amount of
Beethoven and Schubert. This
disc shows that Kuerti is equally at
home with the Russian com
posers.
The Tchaikovsky "Grand
Sonata" in G is a problematic work
fraught with structural flaws.
Traditionally designated as a re
quired piece for the Tchaikovsky
Piano Competition, the work has
few champions beside Sviatoslav
Richter.

Kuerti tackles the enormous
sonata with grace and aplomb,
seeking to accentuate its lyrical
side and subdue its more clanky
and bombastic side. Kuerti's un
hurried tempo effectively eschews
the pomposity of the piece without
reducing its grandeur. The fluidity
in the last movement is especially
remarkable, outwitting even
Richter's authoritative account.
Kuerti's Scriabin, however,
falls short of the blinding intensi
ty and elusive mysticism that is
the essence of Scriabin's music.
The "Fourth Sonata" is delivered
with poise but perhaps too leisure
ly. This reduces the drastic con
trast between the mystic opening
and the heaven-storming coda in
octaves, marked "prestissimo
volando" in the music. The "Pre
ludes" and "Etudes" fare much
better in Kuerti's hands, filled as
they are with nuanced tonal
phrasings.
Perhaps the most curious items

on the disc are the Liadov pieces
and Glazunov's charming "Grand
Concert Waltz." The selection of
various Liadov pieces reflects a
highly Chopinesque influence,
both in harmonic language and
structural outlay. Kuerti's Vien
nese hunch comes to the fore in
the Glazunov, where he shapes the
elegant waltz with grace and
bravura.
For a truly volcanic and unbeat
able rendition of the Scriahin
"Fourth," one has to turn to Igor
Zhukov on the Melodia label. As
for the Tchaikovsky "Sonata,"
Richter's recording on the BMG
label remains a formidable bench
mark with which others are in
evitably measured. Kuerti certain
ly deserves credit for reviving
some of the neglected gems in the
Russian repertoire as well as sam
pling a varied program that is en
joyable throughout.
