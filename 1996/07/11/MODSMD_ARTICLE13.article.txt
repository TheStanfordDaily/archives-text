# EVERYTHING BUT THE GIRL
## Amplified Heart

Riding on the hit "Missing,"
Everything but the Girl is going
up, up, up. Their album "Ampli
fied Heart" successfully blends
folk, R&B, jazz, funk and alter
native rock.
Comprised of Tracey Thorn
and Ben Watt, the band has a
sound that carries traces of
Sade, Tracy Chapman and Na
talie Merchant. Thorn's voice
subtly mimics the fluctuations
of Merchant's, and the same
lulling, melodic lyrics can be de
tected.
Thorn and Watt write from
the heart. The lyrics are intense

ly sad, but in place of the trendy
white female angst that is so
prevalent among female alterna
tive singers, Thorn and Watt
write about romantic frustra

tion.
In "Walking to You," Watt
writes, "In everything that I do,
am I just walking to you? I just
don't know what to do." There is

plenty of loss, distress and latent
anger toward love and loved
ones, as heard in "Missing,"
where Thorn sings, "You've dis
appeared somewhere like outer
space, you've found some better
place, and I miss you — like the
deserts miss the rain. Could you
be dead?"
Their sound embraces the
smoothness of the acoustic gui
tar, but on a few tracks, there is
a definite disco influence com
plete with synthesized drums
and otherworldly sounds. These
variations make Everything but
the Girl riveting; you don't know
what to expect next.
Thorn and Watt have com
posed an album that is strong,
expressive and provocative in its
lyrics, yet relaxing and mellow
in its tone and sound. "Ampli
fied Heart" is definitely worth
the listen!
