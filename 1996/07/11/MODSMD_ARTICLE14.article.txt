## The 						Nutty Professor 
### 
It's about time Eddie Murphy
emerged from his movie slump.
"The Nutty Professor" features
a Murphy whose raw humor is
never-ending. As always, he takes
subjects that are mundane (like
bodily functions) and taboo (like
sexual relations) and elicits their
comedic elements. It definitely
seems that Murphy is back and up
to his old tricks again ... or is he?
"The Nutty Professor" is Mur
phy's first remake. It was inspired
by Jerry Lewis's same-named hi
larious Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde
comedy. Only now it has a twist.
Sherman Clump (Murphy), our
"nutty professor," is a brilliant sci
entist doing breakthrough re
search. He is warm and intelligent.

He has a big heart. The only prob
lem is that the rest of him is also
big.
Sherman Clump is a fat man,
and his fat constantly gets in the
way and causes trouble. There is
an amusing scene in which his big
booty bumps a lever which frees all
the laboratory gerbils. The cam
pus is in a panic as it finds gerbils
everywhere (and I do mean every
where!).
After Clump meets the beauti
ful new professor Ms. Purty
(played wonderfully by Jada Pin
kett), the crux of t he movie begins
to be revealed as he tries valiantly
to lose weight.
While watching Murphy tell more
yo-mama-so-fat jokes than ever in a
comedy club scene iind playing the
multiple characters of a fat family at
the dinner table (this is a must-see),
one cannot help but wonder: Is fat
being used as a vehicle, just another
way for Murphy to show off?
Looking at these scenes from

our own perspective, we can im
mediately see that the world re
gards fat people as a source of en
tertainment. However, Murphy
skillfully turns the tables on us

and allows us to see the world
through Sherman Clump's eyes.
Ah ha! There does seem to be a
purpose to this film.
We follow him through quickie

fad diets, exercise tapes, self-affir
mations and desperation binges in
scenes which are comedic as well
as poignant.
His personality yo-yos back and
forth as he goes from fat to thin
thanks to his miracle potion. His
internal conflict surfaces in his
search for his true identity. All the
while, even though Clump is
caught between a rock and a fat
place, he still finds ways to make
us laugh.
Along with laughing at Sher
man Clump's antics comes this re
alization: Somewhere along the
way, we switched from laughing at
a fat man to just laughing with
Sherman Clump, a man.
Could it be that Murphy has
made a movie with a conscience?
See it for yourself. Laugh while
you decide.
