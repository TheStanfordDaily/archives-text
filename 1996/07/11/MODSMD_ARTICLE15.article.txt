# Independence Day
## 
### 
Once a summer I feel a child
hood excitement assemble with
in me for an entire day. I pur
chase tickets in advance, over
the phone, to ensure attendance.
I even arrive early to the theater.
For me, these movie-going
anomalies signal opening day for
a large-budget Hollywood pro
duction that I always believe will
hold wonders comparable to
those of the legendary "Star
Wars." This year, "Indepen
dence Day" alerted my seasonal
alarm. Once again, much of my
ado arose over nothing.

"independence Day," written,
produced and directed by Roland
Emmerich and Dean Devlin
("Stargate"), emulates an Orson
Welles-style "War of the
Worlds." Unlike the original
radio broadcast, which required
only sound effects to manipulate
and convince the listener, this
mock alien invasion relies heavi
ly on computer-animated special
effects.
"Independence Day" once
again defeats the Hollywood
proposition that money spent on
computer wizardry yields a good
film. This trend in executive
delusions has proven that it re
quires George Lucas-like pro
duction to unlock the power of
special effects. Bullet-proof visu
al effects merely disguise paper
thin plots and shield mediocre

productions from box-office fail
ure.
The narrative of "Indepen
dence Day" tracks several con
verging characters who witness
alien space destroyers hovering
above major metropolises. With
the burden of world salvation
falling upon the all-powerful
United States, the aliens commit
the unfortunate faux pas of in
vading between July 2 and July
4.
In Washington, the president,
played by Bill Pullman ("While
You Were Sleeping"), wrestles
with alien diplomacy, almost
costing the earth its indepen
dence. If this movie asserts any
kind of message, it is one that es
pouses the United States' funda
mental need for better bureau
cratic protocol when dealing

with extraterrestrial offensives.
Expectantly, Jeff Goldblum
("Jurassic Park") and Will
Smith ("Bad Boys") comprise
the respective brain and brawn
of the human retaliation. The
interplay between Capt. Steve
Hiller, U.S. Air Force (Smith)
and M.I.T. genius David (Gold
blum) adds levity to the numer
ous incidents which deflate any
willing suspensions of disbelief.
Watch how the alien foes,
with insurmountable technolog
ical supremacy, deal with an
Apple Powerbook and a cellular
phone. Afterwards, you'll hope
that we're not alone in the uni
verse; you'll beg for the exis
tence of something more intelli
gent.
