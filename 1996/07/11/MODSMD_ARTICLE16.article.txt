WHAT MAKES A classic?
The first defining feature
of a classic text is that it is
about something important. De
spite what some might say, there
are good reasons to think that cer
tain texts concern issues that are
more central and of greater im
portance to human life. For exam
ple, the early Greek classic "The
Republic of Plato" is an audacious
attempt to design a society from
the ground up. Given that human
beings are creatures who must, by
their very nature, live in some
kind of society and that there are
many different kinds of society,
both actual and possible, from
which to choose, a systematic con
sideration of what if any form of
society is ideal and exactly how it
should be structured is a very im
portant issue for human beings.
Moreover, this is and will remain
an important issue as long as
there are human beings.
Another example of this first
feature of a classic can be found in
the early Chinese text "The Men
cius." Like Plato, Mencius be
lieved that human beings are by
nature social creatures and that
the societies they develop can
only operate effectively through
cooperation, people accepting and

being guided by certain norms of
behavior. But unlike Plato, Men
cius believed such cooperation
can only come about if people de
velop a shared capacity for com
passion and concern.
This led Mencius to develop a
remarkable and widely influen
tial theory about the character of
human nature. He argued that
among our most distinctive fea
tures is our innate capacity for
compassion. Our tendency to feel
compassion for the suffering of
other people and creatures shows
that altruistic desires are at least
part of our nature. Moreover, he
claimed that if we become aware
of such feelings and focus our at
tention and efforts upon them, we
can strengthen them and develop
into the distinctive kind of crea
tures we are; creatures who
thrive and find our deepest satis
faction in a harmonious and
flourishing society.
The second feature of a classic
text is that it presents important
issues in beautiful, moving and
memorable ways. Plato's allegory
of the cave, with its ascent from
the realm of shadowy illusion to
brilliant reality, or his story of the
ring of Gyges, which renders its
wearer invisible, impervious to

detection and thus apparently
free of ethical constraint, present
important ideas in ways that in
spire, seduce and haunt us into
further reflection.
Plato could have expressed
these very same ideas in a series
of bland propositions. Had he
done so they would have been at
best footnotes in some other au
thor's masterpiece. He did not,
and later thinkers (including us)
are the ones providing the foot
notes. Similarly, "The Mencius"
is replete with powerful, stimu
lating and perplexing images
which have proven to be an inex
haustible source for the Confu
cian tradition. He tells of the
Farmer of Song, who was so anx
ious about the growth of his
sprouting grain that he went and
pulled at the young plants, killing
them and bringing disaster upon
himself and his family.
Mencius warns us not to be like
this foolish farmer when we work
to cultivate our character. We
cannot force the growth of our
moral "sprouts," e.g. our innate
tendency to feel compassion,
without damaging them. Nor can
we neglect them. We must be pa
tient and determined farmers,
continually applying effort in a

slow but steady process of devel
opment. Morality, like all forms
of wisdom, does not come easily or
quickly, with some isolated flash
of effort.
Such stimulating and inviting
images explain why "The Men
cius" has inspired a vast, rich and
profoundly interesting tradition
of interpretation which has lasted
for more than 2,000 years and
which remains vital in the pre
sent day. Only works that contain
such wonderfully crafted multi
faceted images woven together
into a comprehensive vision, in
spire, challenge and call us to en
gage them.
The final feature a classic must
have is complexity. Because they
deal with difficult issues in care
ful, nuanced and comprehensive
ways, classics are complex. As a
consequence, they are not easy to
read; they are "heavy," not
"light," reading. Classics require
careful and repeated study and
repay such efforts with deeper
and more comprehensive under
standing. Not all of this under
standing will be extracted from
the text in a direct fashion, by
simply drawing forth the infor
mation within. There is no need
for a classic to teach in such a di-

rect manner,
though they
often do. We
might disagree
with almost every
positive proposal

i — — i jr — —
a classic makes and still learn a
great deal from it.
One may well reject Plato's pro
posals about how a state should be
organized; one might even find
many of them offensive. Mencius'
claims about human nature may
strike one as mistaken, incomplete
or potentially dangerous. But, if
one comes to such conclusions
honestly, by carefully thinking
through and responding to their
views and crafting one's own an
swers to these complex and vexing
issues, one will have come to a
much more profound understand
ing of both self and society. One
will have encountered important
problems presented in beautiful,
moving and memorable ways that
capture the complex texture of
human life. In the process, one
likely will have gained a good sense
of what it is to engage and learn
from a classic text.
