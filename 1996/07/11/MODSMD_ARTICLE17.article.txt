## Stanford needs better privacy regulations

Jesse Oxfeld

IT WAS RIGHT there on the
front page of The New York
Times. As I walked home from
the newsstand late one Tuesday
night at the height of the FBI files
scandal, I was engrossed in an arti
cle about that most recent contro
versy to plague the Clinton White
House. The story reported that
files had been obtained on many
more Bush administration figures
than previously believed; among
them were such figures as former
National Security Advisor Brent
Scowcroft and former CIA Direc
tor Robert Gates. On the story's
final front-page line came the one
name that really caught my eye.
Apparently, the White House had
obtained files on one Condoleezza
Rice, formerly the security coun
cil's Russia expert and now Stan
ford's provost.
Rice told me that she is not wor
ried about the contents of her file,
but said "it makes me somewhat
queasy to know that unauthorized
people may have read a file that I,
myself, have not seen." Simply,
she's bothered that the informa
tion was not adequately controlled
by the feds. "One gives informa
tion to the FBI on the assumption
that it will only be used for securi

ty clearance," she said.
The incident got me thinking
about the possibility that a similar
event could occur at Stanford.
After all, just as the FBI compiles
all sorts of personal and private in
formation on individuals seeking
access to the White House — as
was Condi during the Bush admin
istration — so does Stanford be
come the custodian of vast
amounts of information about its
students.
Think about it for a moment.
Somewhere in the University's
computers are records, obviously,
of our grades and student ID num
bers, and of real-world identifiers
like social security numbers, ad
dresses and phone numbers. In
order to enroll for a quarter, the
University requires that we have
health insurance — and if you opt
not to enroll in Cowell's program,
you must provide the name of your
own insurer and your policy num
ber. The Financial Aid Office
knows just how much money you
and your parents make and exact
ly what your assets are. The Bur
sar's Office knows how indebted
each of us is, and Communications
Services knows whom we call,
when we call them and even from

where the call was placed.
As more and more operations
within the University become com
puterized, there is, inherently,
more and more information about
us and our habits saved on comput
er disks. The ASSU could — and
under a strict constructionist read
ing of its constitution, is probably
required to — make available the
records of who refunded which spe
cial fees to anyone who asks.
"Claim to be an environmentalist,
Oxfeld? Well then, why did you re
fund your SEAS special fee?"
(Note: I did not refund my SEAS
special fee; the second-to-last thing
I need is Nick Thompson after me.)
Furthermore, Residential Comput
ing, which conducts on-line elec
tions for the ASSU, knows whether
I voted for the Shen-Thompson
ticket, and even whether I voted at
all. (Note: I did vote for Shen-
Thompson; the last thing I need is
both Bill and Nick after me.)
Particularly Orwellian warn
ings should be sounded as use of
the new Stanford Card expands
into more areas. Right now, the
University knows when you enter
and leave the library, when you
enter and leave the weightrooms
(or so I'm told; I don't venture to

Arillaga often enough to know if
you must swipe a card to get in ...
OK, I don't go there ever) and, if
you use the debit-account feature
of the card, when you buy your
CoHo coffee and how many cups
you buy as well as when you do
your laundry (at least in Wilbur
and Stern, so far).
Of course, none of that infor
mation is particularly interesting,
but consider the consequences if
and when Stanford ID cards are
used to gain entry to buildings all
around campus. Your parents still
think of you as the same shy kid
you were in high school? "Well,
Mrs. Smith, University records
show that little Johnny entered
Roble, his girlfriend's dorm, at
11:30 p.m. and didn't leave until
9:00 the next morning."
The University does have a pol
icy on information privacy, titled
"Principles of Privacy in the Uni
versity" and available from the
general counsel's office. It clearly
defines and carefully limits when
and how information gathered by
the University can be shared with
outsiders. It also states that indi
viduals should be made aware of
what kinds of information about
them are on file. What it does not

sufficiently do,
however, is speci
fy the guidelines
for the sharing of
information with
in the University.

Can Residential Education know
whether I call 900 numbers in de
ciding whether I'd make a good
resident assistant? Can a profes
sor know how much time I actual
ly spend in the library?
The Federal Privacy Act of
1974 prevents one government
agency from giving personal infor
mation to another without the in
dividual's consent, except "for a
use which is compatible with the
purposes for which the informa
tion was originally collected." As
Stanford moves into an age when
troves of private facts and figures
are stored in its computer records,
the University must implement a
policy that, like the U.S. govern
ment's rule, clearly outlines ac
ceptable transfers of information
within its agencies.
