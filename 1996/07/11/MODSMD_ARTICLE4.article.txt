## Dancing the traditional tango 
### Victoria Foster Contributing writer 
Since its origin six years ago,
Stanford Tango Week has drawn
international attention for its
techniques in teaching the tradi
tional tango dance form.
Such attention included a visit
from the Argentinian ambassador
to the United States this past
Tuesday, during Tango Week's
celebration of Argentina's inde
pendence day. The ambassador
told dance instructor Richard
Powers that he came expecting to
see the usual "roses in the teeth"
American tango style, but instead
was very impressed to see a floor
filled with people doing authentic
Argentinian tango with great skill.

Powers, who is best known on
campus for his social dance class
es, conceived the idea of Tango
Week six years ago.
"The tango week evolved,"
Powers recalled. "I'm a dance his
torian, and before I joined the fac
ulty at Stanford, I was brought in
to organize a series of historic
dance weeks. For the third of
these, I chose to specialize on tra
ditional tango. I included Argen
tinian tango."
The dance week soon came to be
known as Tango Week. "The par
ticipants wanted to repeat that the
following year, and I wanted to
focus on the living traditional
tango. [The program] quickly
came to focus on Argentinian
tango alone without the other

forms," Powers added.
Powers said he looks for in
structors who are respected for
their dancing and effective in
teaching large classes. "It's diffi
cult if they can dance but not ex
plain."
One instructor, George Guinn,
said he enjoys working with begin
ners — "brand new raw material,"
who have not yet developed bad
habits. He added that he considers
them "more challenging" to teach.
"I can mold them," he said with
a smile, adding that the main prob
lems his students encounter have
to do with the subtle motor skills
required by the dance.
"What you see is not what you
have to do," Guinn said. "People
don't understand the micro-motor
movements. You have to analyze
layer by layer what happens in the
shoulders, knees, toes. Every move
has to be spontaneously organized."
Another instructor, Susan Bab
cock, added that her approach also
emphasizes "posture and lead-fol
low dynamics, particularly the dy
namic interdependence between
the couple."
Babcock added that Tango
Week has been skillfully struc
tured by Powers. She said she is
excited about the "nice mix of
teachers." Some teach basics and
fundamentals while others, partic
ularly those from Argentina, teach
the "flavor of the dance" through a
variety of steps.
The tango itself has an interest
ing history. Tango was used by Ar
gentinian men to court women,
since there used to be 100 men to
every one heavily-chaperoned

woman in the country. Argentin
ian men devised the dance and
practiced among themselves to be
come perfect courtesans. Their
goal was to make it easy for the
women, so that when the men led,
the women could relax, knowing
that in their role they could do no
wrong.
Every instructor in Tango
Week uses a different style and
focus to teach the mental attitude
behind the dance. Daniel Trenner
refers to it as "taking a lady for a
walk," encouraging the dancers to
focus on their relationship rather
than on the complexity of the
physical movements.
Babcock said this is the first
program of its kind in the United
States. "[Powers] has done a lot for

tango in this country. By having
this event, he brings national and
international attention to the
dance. He teaches well and knows
how to invite people in. He de
serves credit and thanks for being
the guy behind the scenes."
The Tango Week program at
tracts people from all parts of the
United States, as well as France,
Canada, Mexico and Argentina.
"I'm hoping a to find an opportu
nity to grab the microphone and give
[Richard Powers] recognition for his
forward thinking," Babcock added.

Tango classes will run from 9 a.m.
to 5 p. m in the Roble Dance Studio
this week and next week. There are
currently 135 students and 13 in
structors participating.
