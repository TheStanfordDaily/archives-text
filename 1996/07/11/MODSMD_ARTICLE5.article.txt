## Rodin Sculpture Garden contributor passes away 
### Michael Harville 
B. Gerald Cantor, a wealthy fi
nancier and the man who gave
Stanford its beloved Rodin Sculp
ture Garden, died from a long ill
ness on July 3 in Los Angeles. He
was 79 years old.
Cantor was born and raised in
New York, where he studied law
and finance in the 19305. After
serving in the army in the South
Pacific during World War 11, he re
turned to New York to found the
securities firm B. G. Cantor and
Company. Soon thereafter, he
abandoned this enterprise and
joined partner John Fitzgerald to
form Cantor, Fitzgerald, and Com
pany.
As his firm grew, Cantor earned
a reputation in financial circles as
a shrewd investor and executive.
The firm was reorganized as Can
tor Fitzgerald L.P. in 1992, and it
is currently one of the largest in
stitutional brokers of government
securities in the United States.
Cantor and his wife, Iris, are
perhaps better known as art collec
tors and patrons, and particularly
for their tremendous interest in
the works of the 19th century
French sculptor Auguste Rodin.
Cantor bought his first Rodin
sculpture, "Hand of God," in 1947,
and went on to amass, by his own
estimate, roughly 600 Rodin
pieces.
Rather than horde the world's
largest private Rodin collection,
however, the Cantors chose to
share their passion for the artist
by donating the majority of their
holdings to a number of museums,
including the Stanford Art Muse
um, the New York Metropolitan
Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Mu
seum and the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art.
Despite their lack of a formal
connection to Stanford, the Can
tors' generosity toward its Art Mu
seum has been extraordinary. The
museum's director, Thomas Selig
man, noted in an interview that
the Cantors have donated nearly
200 Rodin sculptures and draw
ings to the museum, including
"The Gates of Hell," "The
Burghers of Calais," and"The
Three Shades."
The museum's Rodin collection
is now the second largest in the

world, behind the Musee Auguste
Rodin in Paris. The Cantors have
also donated several sculptures by
Rodin contemporaries such as
Jacob Ebstein and A. Jules Dalou.
"After Jane Stanford," Selig
man said, "the Cantors are the
most significant benefactors the
museum has ever had. Mr. Cantor
was an intense believer in the
power of art, and he was passionate
about Rodin. He was extremely
supportive, personally, in helping

art scholars and museums do their
work."
The Cantors provided much fi
nancial support for scholars in the
Art Department and particularly
for research on Rodin. It was Can
tor's friendship with Stanford Art
Prof, and Rodin scholar Albert
Elsen that initially persuaded him
to make donations to the Universi
ty. Elsen died in early 1995.
The B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden, which opened
in 1985, is one of Stanford's most
popular attractions for students,
staff and tourists. The site of
many weddings, classes and pic
nics, the garden was the only por
tion of the Stanford Art Museum
to remain accessible to the public
after the 1989 Loma Prieta Earth
quake.
In 1994, the Cantors provided
the lead gift of $ 10 million in a $31
million fund-raising campaign to
help pay for both renovation of the
museum and the addition of a new
wing to the building.
John Freidenrich, chair of

Stanford's Board of Trustees,
worked with Cantor in helping to
plan this project. "He was very in
terested in helping to reopen the
museum, and he spent time on
helping to select the design and on

meeting with the architects," Frei
denrich said. "It's safe to say that
we couldn't have done it without
him."
When construction is complet
ed, most likely in the fall of 1998,

the entire art museum complex,
consisting of the current museum
building, the new wing, and the
sculpture garden, will be renamed
the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Cen
ter for the Visual Arts.
