# Cantor's legacy to continue through museum project
## 
### Michael Harville 
Although B. Gerald Cantor
passed away last week, his pas
sion for art will continue to be
expressed at Stanford through a
museum that bears his name.
He and his wife's $10 million do
nation in 1994 is the lead gift in
a $31 million renovation and ex
pansion project of the Stanford
Art Museum.
When finished, the new com
plex, which includes the current
art museum building, the Rodin
Sculpture Garden, and a new
wing to be built behind the mu
seum, will be christened the Iris
and B. Gerald Cantor Center for
the Visual Arts.
Construction began last Oc
tober on the museum, which
has been closed since the 1989
Loma Prieta Earthquake due to
heavy damage.
According to Museum Direc
tor Thomas Seligman, the new
complex will emphasize teach
ing and research. To that end,
the 40,000-square-foot new
wing will include a 100-seat
"special programs" room that
can be used for the presentation
of lectures and films, for class
es, and even for live musical or
dance performances. The old
museum lacked any such facili
ty.
In addition, a small "flexible
exhibition" room, dedicated to
showing works that are made
available with little advance
notice, will be created inside
the original museum building.
Typically, art exhibits are
planned years ahead of time,
Seligman explained, but this
new room should better enable
the museum to provide expo
sure for new artists or new
works from within the Univer
sity community.

The room would also be use
ful for presenting exhibitions
which are relevant to current
events at Stanford, he added.

scribed, shares some basic ele
ments with the old building, but
is of a completely contemporary
style. "It takes the profile of the
old building in that it is of the
same height (two stories) and
has similar lines, and it is a con
crete structure like the old
building, so it will relate in
color," Seligman said.
The new wing features a full
length glass wall overlooking a
courtyard between it and the old
building. On the ground floor, a
cafe will open out onto the
Rodin garden, and it will offer
outdoor seating during warm
weather.
The ground floor will also
house a bookstore, a "special ex
hibitions" gallery and the "spe
cial programs" room. The sec
ond floor will contain contempo
rary art galleries and some of
fices. The basement will hold a
conservation area for the
restoration of art works, as well
as a storage area for large,
works.
The original art museum
building, formerly known as the
Leland Stanford Junior Muse
um, contains twin rotundas
constructed of unreinforced
brick that were damaged nearly
beyond repair in the Loma Pri
eta Earthquake. Much of the
project's renovation expenses
will be put toward reinforce
ment of these structures.
In addition, climate control
will be added to both the old
building and the new wing. This
will enable the new center to at
tract gifts and touring exhibi
tions of sensitive or delicate
works that the old museum
could not accommodate.
When the Cantor Center
opens, admission will remain
free, except possibly for certain
special traveling exhibitions.
