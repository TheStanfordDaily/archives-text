Berkeley chancellor resigns
Chang-Lin Tien, chancellor of UC-
Berkeley, said Tuesday that he is resign
ing from his post after a six-year run.
Tien, the first Asian American to head a
major U.S. university, said that he will
step down by June 30 of next year. An out
spoken critic of the Board of Regents deci
sion to end affirmative action programs
last summer, Tien is the third chancellor
of the nine UC-campus system to an
nounce plans to leave before the contro
versial decision goes into effect.
Bob Sanders, a spokesman for UC-

Berkeley, downplayed any connection.
"Despite some disagreement, Chancellor
Tien has maintained a good rapport with
the regents," Sanders said. "He considers
Gov. Wilson and other board members to
be good friends."
The Board of Regents will spend the
next year searching for a qualified candi
date to replace the outgoing Tien. But
Chancellor Tien's will be a hard act to fol
low.
"Despite terrible budgetary times, in
creasing tuition and the retirement of over
a quarter of the active faculty, he was able
to keep the quality of the faculty and the

entire institution high," Sanders said.

Merger still in limbo
As University President Gerhard
Casper's mid-July deadline for the Uni
versity of California Regents to make an
"agreement in principle" to the proposed
Stanford-UCSF hospital merger grows
near, it appears the merger is in danger of
falling through.
According to Stanford spokeswoman
Judy Frabotta, the Board of Regents will
meet July 19, but not to vote on the agree
ment.

"They're really voting on and consider
ing just the governance of the proposed
corporation," Frabotta said.
The regents' hesitance may mean the
end of merger negotiations. Casper
wrote in a June 24 letter to UC Presi
dent Richard Atkinson that he was "dis
heartened" by the prospect of ending
talks.
Frabotta said that Stanford officials
will meet the Monday following the re
gents' meeting and will wait to comment
on the merger until after the July 19
meeting.
