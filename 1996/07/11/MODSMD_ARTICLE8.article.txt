## S.J. team looks like Stanford 
### Wai Fung Kwok Contributing writer 
Starting this fall, Stanford bas
ketball fans will be able to see some of
the University's former female stars
compete against other women's bas
ketball greats in a new professional
team just down the road. The San
Jose team, which is still nameless, is
one of the eight teams comprising
the American Basketball lieague, a
new professional women's basket
ball league.
The ex-Stanford players the San
Jose team will feature include Jen
nifer Azzi, Val Whiting, Anita Ka
plan and Sonja Henning.
Azzi, a member of the 1996 U.S.
Olympic Team, and Whiting, a two
time Ail-American, were the two pre
mier players assigned to San Jose
based on competitive balance and re
gional popularity. San Jose chose
Kaplan and Henning as its first two
picks in a draft held at San Jose
Arena on June 19.
The new league, which will fea
ture eleven members of the 1996
U.S. Olympic women's basketball
team as well as numerous former
All Americans, will begin play in
mid-October.
Not the women's NBA
According to Christine Forter,
general manager of the San Jose
team, fans shouldn't expect any
thunderous alley-hoop dunks when
watching ABL games. And while

some wonder whether basketball
can generate excitement without
high-flying above-the-rim play,
Forter is enthusiastic about the
ABI/s prospects.
The ABL is not the women's
NBA Forter said. It is basketball
based on strong teamwork and solid
fundamentals, just as the game was
meant to be when invented more
than a century ago.
"The all-time legendary coach
John Wooden once said, 'Ifyou wait
♦o watch how basketball should be
played, then watch women's basket
ball,' " Forter said.
Happy playing at home
The players are equally enthusi
astic. "I am very excited about the
opportunity to play in the ABL. As a
23-year-old, I by no means feel that I
should be retired from the sport I
love and have dedicated so much of
my time to," Kaplan said.
These four former Stanford stars
are by no means newcomers to pro
fessional basketball. They all have
had experience playing in foreign
countries — Azzi, Kaplan, and Hen
ning played in Sweden, while Whit
ing has played in Brazil.
But playing in the United States,
especially near their alma mater, will
be a special experience for the play
ers.
"For someone who played over
seas and did not have an enjoyable
experience, the chance to play at
home is a great relief," Kaplan said.

"Playing in San Jose just makes the
whole situation that much more per
fect because I love the area and am
very excited to play with the people
on my team."
However, the competition in the
ABL will be just as fierce, if not more
so, than in foreign professional
leagues. The ABL Ls comprised of for
mer elite college players, including
many All-Americans and U.S.
Olympic Team members.
For the players, the league means
an opportunity to take their games to
the next level. "I think [college and
the ABL] are two different levels of
basketball. Playing at Stanford was a
pretty high level of play. But obvi
ously, this league will be a lot more
competitive," Kaplan said.
For Kaplan, the only slight regret
in playing for this league Ls the in
evitability of competition against
some of her old Stanford teammates.
Other former Stanford players
drafted by ABL teams are Olympian
Katy Steding (Portland), Christy
Iledgpeth and Kate Paye (Seattle),
Molly Goodenbour (Richmond) and
Rachel Hemmer (Atlanta).
For love of the game
Many of these women are putting
their other career plans aside for the
opportunity to play in this league.
Henning, who graduated from law
school and Ls currently working for a
law firm, will put her legal career on
hold for the upcoming season.
Whiting is deferring her accep

tance to UCSF medical school for
two years. She said she is not certain
whether playing professional bas
ketball will be her career. "It's hard
for me to tell right now. 11 depends on
how I feel about my game. If I take
my game to a level I'm satisfied with,

I'll retire."
Kaplan had the same response. "I
will take it one year at a time. I will
see how well I do and how well the
league does," she said.
