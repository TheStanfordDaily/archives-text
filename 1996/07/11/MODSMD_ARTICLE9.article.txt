# Esther in Atlanta: Let the Games begin!
## 
### Esther Pan 
Here I am in Atlanta, exhaust
ed from a horrible freezing
cramped night of sleep on the reg
ulation army cot in a cell-like
music room of the Martin Luther
King, Jr. Middle School, my home
for the next three weeks. The
school is located in the not-prime
real-estate West End section of
the city.
Waiting for the bus to get here
— as the only non-black person
on the steamy street, the sidewalk
littered with trash and paper
cups, the air blaring with loud
music — it was just a little nerve
wracking. When I asked the bus
driver how to get here, he asked,
"Why you wanna go theah fouh?"
Not a good sign. The shabby hous
es along the way — with boarded
windows, peeling paint, and arid
yellow grass — were not encour
aging, either, although the four
men playing dice outside were
very nice when they pointed me to
the door.
There's a housing shortage in
Atlanta, so we volunteers get
shafted into cots in curtained
cells (which look just like voting
booths) lined up on the hardwood
floor of a gym (for men), or on the
tiled floor of the music room (for
women). 1 got here early and so
snagged a single practice room off
of the main room — it's about
eight feet by six feet, black indus
trial-tile floor and white painted

cement-block walls. The resem
blance to prison is not accidental;
I need some African wall hang
ings.
Last night I had no bedding (I
vaguely remember being told that
a long few weeks ago) and so spent
the night huddled into fetal posi
tion, neck cramping from lying on
a brick-hard pile of T-shirts, cov
ered with a long shirt and the
three regulation Olympic jerseys
I got with my uniform yesterday.
I didn't bring warm clothes with
me, expecting Atlanta to be very
hot, which it is, but it gets cold
here at night and I was freezing.
Not a fun experience. Today I
made it to Macy's on Peachtree
Street, just down the street from
such tourist landmarks as Hard
Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood,
and picked up a blanket, sheet
and pillow for $32.81 ten minutes
before closing. Hooray for Fourth
of July sales; with the prices in
this city, these Games are going to
cost (not just) me a mint.
But on to the city.
Downtown Atlanta is high
rises and wide boulevards, with
parks and many trees lending
welcome green shade in between.
This is the biggest city in the
South, with almost three million
people in the 20-county metro
area, and it is undisputedly the
most cosmopolitan and sophisti
cated. The famed southern accent
is much less pronounced here
than in more rural areas of Geor

gia (for example, Dalton, where
residents' jaws hit their chests
with every syllable); in fact, one
woman I met, a transplant from
Ohio, claimed that most of the
people in this city are not origi
nally from Atlanta. The economic
boom in recent years, the interna
tional recognition garnered by
the Carter Center for Peace and
Habitat for Humanity, the five
colleges (Morehouse, Spelman,
Clark Atlanta University, Geor
gia Tech, and Emory) in town and
the presence of corporations like
CNN and Coca-Cola world head
quarters insure that this is no
hick town.
Facts about Atlanta and the
Centennial Olympics
Temperature: It's hot here.
Real hot. Damn hot. Africa hot.
Average temperature is 88 de
grees Fahrenheit, but with the
heat index (humidity) it's closer
to 107, and feels like a steamy,
sticky oven. The cement burns
your shoes if you don't find shade
or air conditioning fast enough —
apparently a significant con
tributing factor to making At
lanta the mall capital of the
world.
Athletes: 10,003, from 197
countries. The United Nations
only recognizes 175 countries,
but 197 are coming to the
Olympics. Hello, Burkina Faso.
Security Personnel: 22,000.

Reportedly . . . since I can't get
into the Olympic Village, and nei
ther could GOD without proper
credentials, which include com
puterized bar codes and laser
handprint-identification.
There's a cop or soldier on every
corner of the Village, and one in
between those two. But, hey,
someone's got to guard the ath
letes.
There is certainly a very evi
dent police and National Guard
presence everywhere else in the
city, from the MARTA (public rail
system) stations to parking
garages. There were four bomb
threats in the Olympic Village
last week, of which two were
crank calls and one was a test.
Staff and Volunteers: 99,000.
Imagine doing anything for that
many people, much less outfitting
them — the uniform distribution
center is an enormous ware
house. They process you through
very efficiently, both here and for
credentials (where they have indi
vidual photo-identification sta
tions and can print up your badge,
complete with picture, bar code,
and access information, in less
than a minute).
What you get as a volunteer:
Three regulation blue-ring-on
white-background jerseys; two
khaki pants or skorts (SKO
RTS?!?!); three pairs of buff socks;
one green-and-blue Swatch; one
straw hat that is spray-painted
greeny-brownish and stiffer than

a board; one belt bag (read: fanny
pack) of the same attractive color;
one pair of specially-for-the-
Olympics-not-for-resale Reebok
sneakers; one MART A pass, good
on all public transportation for
the duration of the Games; one of
ficial map of sites and venues; one
magic all-you-can-drink Coke
pass, good in any Coke machine in
any venue . . . and yes, a partridge
in a pear tree.
Pretty neat loot, but the
process was a pain. The blue-and
brown color scheme makes you
question the designers' color
blindness — the color of the rings
indicates what the person does.
For example, medical people wear
red rings. The skort is pretty
heinous; interestingly enough,
they were running out of the
smaller sizes, but had plenty of
34+ on hand to offer. They tried
to bribe me to take a bigger size by
offering me an extra pair of skorts
— it was hard, but I had to de
cline.
Press People: 15,000. There's
a huge International Broadcast
ing Center in the Georgia World
Congress Center right in the mid
dle of everything. The print jour
nalists and photographers are in a
huge building downtown, where
Sports Illustrated alone takes up
a whole floor. Apparently press
credentials have been impossible
to come by, especially for photog
raphers; only the selected pool
photographers get access, and
everyone else has to use their pic
tures.
Visitors: Two million. There are a
ton here already — I don't want to
think about what it'll be like in two
weeks. Apparently there's been an
Olympic Getaway special popular
among Atlantans: leave the city dur
ing the Games, register your house
for rental (although not as many
have been picked up as expected)

and fly anywhere in the country for
$200. Fighting the sweating crowds
swarming through the not-yet
opened Olympic Park this boiling af
ternoon, one begins to understand
why residents sick of the hype and
commercialism of the Games would
cut out while they still could.
But hey, we're here — it's gonna
be a good time.
