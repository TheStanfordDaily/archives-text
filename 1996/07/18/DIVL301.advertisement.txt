You Won't Find
Chinese Food Like
This Back Home!
It's because Ming's serves a
refined Chinese cuisine that's
a favorite in Asia, but still
relatively unknown in
America outside the San
Francisco Bay Area.
That's nothing new!
We've been trendsetters
ever since we came to
Palo Alto in 1956 For
instance, the Chinese
Chicken Salad that's so
popular everywhere was our
brainchild And our signature
Ming's Beef has become a
generic dish at many Chinese
restaurants
In 1986, Ming's was the first
to serve Dim Sum outside of
San Francisco Chinatown
Dim sums are appetizer-like
dumplings or rolls pushed
around the dining room on
carts. The Dim Sum chef
Ming's hired from Hong
Kong, Vincent Lee, is so
good that people are now
coming from San
Francisco just to enjoy his
delectable delicacies.
Ming's classics and refined
"Asian imports" are some of
the best finds here in the Bay
Area... and tastier than
anything you'll find back
home!
