# GOOD EATS

Finally, falafel!
One of the more depressing
cultural voids of the immediate
Stanford area is the lack of good
falafel. Five months ago, this void
was filled when the Persian
restaurant Best Bite opened in
Mountain View.
Best Bite is a small, family-run
restaurant that looks like a1960s
plastic-culture coffee diner con
verted into a hookah den. In this
comfortable environment, we
were quickly and pleasantly
served lavash and butter by pro
prietor Soussan herself.
Next was the vegetable platter,
which consisted of dolmeh
(stuffed grape leaves), cabbage
stuffed with fresh vegetables and
herbs, kashk-o-bademjan (egg
plant, whey, roasted garlic and
onion), ba ba ghonoosh (egg
plant, tahini, garlic and onion),
hummus (chickpea, tahini, olive
oil, garlic, paprika) and Persian
feta with walnuts. This platter di
verged from my previous experi
ences with similar Middle East
ern and Mediterranean cuisine.

The hummus was more chalky
than oily, which gave it a taste
that was refreshingly true to the

peas. The ba ba ghonoosh was
also very good, as were the grape
leaves filled with warm salty rice.

But the real treat was the kashk
o-bademjan. I consider myself a
ba ba ghonoosh fanatic, but this

was unique, a pile of mashed egg
plant and onion with whey, tahini
and delicately roasted garlic lay

ered on top.
The ingredients were not
blended together but left in divine
separate layers, allowing the in
gredients to melt together at their
own pace. I recommend the vegi
platter just for the chance to sam
ple this succulent eggplant dish.
I have only two complaints.
The first is the proportions: the
vegi platter is overpriced for the
amount of food. I recommend vis
iting Best Bite for lunch, when
prices are cheaper. My second
complaint lies with the olives. I
expected the tangy taste of Greek
style olives and was disappointed
with bland pizza-style canned
black olives.
Time to get to the point: the
falafel is incredible. When you
order it, Soussan asks how spicy
you would like it. Accompanied by
lettuce, tomatoes, hummus, tahi
ni and thinly sliced pickles, the
fried balls of chick pea, cumin and

parsley are light, not drowned in
grease. Wrapped in lavash, the
subtle taste of the contents fills
the pallet without a bready pita
taste.
I highly recommend Best Bite
for the fantastic falafel, the kashk
o-bademjan and the pleasant din
ing experience of eating at a small
restaurant where the owners have
a passion for food expressed in de
licious works of culinary art.
