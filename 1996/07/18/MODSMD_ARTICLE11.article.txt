# MA SAISON PRÉFÉRÉÉ
## (My Favorite Season) 
### 
In this French film, director
Andre Techine provides a disturb
ing and profoundly realistic exam
ination of the tensions that erupt
when family members are forced
to communicate and confront the
essence of their private lives. Most
people are at ease with the knowl
edge that their siblings and par
ents are safe, healthy and a rea
sonable distance away. "My Fa
vorite Season" examines there

suits when this distance is re
moved and ill health threatens:
when life is in a state of collapse.
The illness of 76-year-old
Berthe (Marthe Villalonga), the
strange and misunderstood charac
ter of her son Antoine (Daniel Au
teuil) and the silent marital failure
of her daughter Emilie (Catherine
Deneuve) are the factors that bring
these three characters together
with conflict and compassion. They
must face the changes that accom
pany their predicaments and sup
port each other when instinct
would steer them away.
Berthe sees the negative effects
of the modern world on her children.
She constantly allots them an over
abundant share of guilt for being
busy with their careers and for plac
ing her in a nursing home. In return

their love for her is tangled in feel
ings of family obligation, guilt and
frustrated resentment. Emilie and
Antoine were extremely close in
childhood, but their adult relation
ship has suffered a separation im
posed by Emilie. Antoine's belliger
ent behavior and attachment to his
sister clashes with her wisdom and
level-headed independence, al
though Antoine is better able to per
ceive the truth in many situations.
The tension between brother
and sister is not as simple as it
seems. An ambiguous sexual
chemistry is alluded to through
out the film. Emilie's recent sepa
ration from her attractive, unfeel
ing husband and isolation from
her children are exacerbated by
the fact that Antoine's disruptions
are largely responsible for the

demise of her life at home.
"My Favorite Season" is by no
means an action movie in the con
ventional sense of the word, but it
is an "active" fdm that plays upon
countless feelings, shifting the
emotional states of its characters
and its audience with exhausting
yet subtle speed.
The inevitability of death con
stantly underlies the fdm, begin
ning with Berthe's first stroke. The
final scene forces all the characters
to sit crowded together amongst
their differences. As they endure
the post-funeral meal around a tiny
garden table, their proximity does
not ameliorate the relentless dis
tance between them. One can't
help but envy Berthe's escape.
