# Stanford athletes hope to eash in on gold Rush at 1996 Olympic games
## 
### Kristie Smith Staff writer 
In its rich athletic tradition, the
Cardinal has enjoyed a long history
of both NCAA championships and
()lympic achievement I laving just
received the prestigious Sears Di
rectors' Cup for the second year in a
row, Stanford can boast of one of
the most comprehensive and suc
cessful athletic departments in the
country.
Throughout the world, Stanford
athletes have traveled with their
competitive spirit aimed toward
victory, and they have succeeded in
capturing several titles along the
way. This competitive spirit will
continue tomorrow and throughout
the next two weeks as 39 Stanford
aflliated athletes— including Stan
ford alumni, coaches, current stu
dents and incoming freshmen — vie
for gold at the 1996 Centennial
Olympic Games in Atlanta, Geor
gia.
Stanford has been represented
consistently by several athletes in
previous Olympic competitions.
Thirty-eight members of the Cardi
nal family competed in the 1992
Olympics in Barcelona, and 41 ath
letes took part in the 1988 (James in
Seoul, South Korea.
In its history of Olympic compe
tition, the Cardinal has captured
more than 90 medals since Sam
Bellah, a Stanford alumnus, tied for
sixth place in the 1908 pole vault
competition.
In fact, Stanford's most recent
Olympic history places the Univer
sity in competition with entire
countries in terms of the medal
rankings. If Stanford athletes were
considered a country at the 1992
Games in Barcelona, the Cardinal
would have placed 13th in the world
with its 19 medals, and ninth in the
world with its 10 golds.
While this overall picture is im
pressive, the sport-by-sport break
down is even more overwhelming.
Baseball
Five Stanford baseball players
and one Stanford coach have com
peted for the United States in two
Olympic baseball competitions.
The Cardinal's most successful
showing in baseball occurred at the
1988 Games in Seoul. Head coach
Mark Marquess, who led Stanford
to back-to-back College World Se
ries titles in '87 and '88, catcher
Doug Robbins and third base
man/designated hitter Ed Sprague
captured the gold medal for the
U.S. baseball team that year.
Pitcher Willie Adams, outfielder
Jeffrey Hammonds and pitcher
Rich Helling also competed success
fully at the '92 CJames in Barcelona,
leading the U.S. team to a fourth
place finish.
The Cardinal Olympic baseball
tradition will continue this year as
recent graduate A.J. Hinch com
petes on the U.S. Olympic team.
Hinch is expected to be the starting
catcher for the team in Atlanta.
Beach Volleyball
Two Stanford alumnae, Barbra
Fontana-Harris and Nancy Reno,
will compete for the U.S. team in

the two-player Beach Volleyball
competition in Atlanta. Reno, along
with Holly McPeak, is ranked sec
ond going into the competition.
This is the first year that beach vol
leyball is an Olympic medal event.
Fencing
One Stanford alumnus will be
competing for the '96 team in At
lanta. Stanford's current women's
head coach, Sherry Posthumus,
was named manager for the team,
and Stanford men's head coach
Zoran Tulum was named an assis
tant coach.
Field Hockey
Although no Stanford-afTliated
athletes will be competing in
Olympic competition this year in
field hockey, two Stanford alumnae
have competed in three previous
Olympiads.
Sheryl Johnson, who is the cur
rent head coach of the Stanford
field hockey program, was one of
those two players. She competed in
both the '80 and '84 Games, captur
ing a bronze medal in Los Angeles.
She was also the co-captain of the
'88 U.S. team.
Gymnastics
Alumnus Jair Lynch, incoming
freshman Amy Chow and sopho

man Ross captured gold medals in
both 400-meter freestyle and 1500-
meter freestyle and diver Clarence
Pinkston captured the gold medal
in high diving and the silver in

springboard diving at the Antwerp
Olympics, Stanford men's swim
ming and diving has continued to
carve out a tradition of excellence in
Olympic competition.
More than 30 Cardinal men
swimmers and divers, including
one coach, have appeared in 12
Olympiads. Together they have
brought home 39 medals, including
22 gold, 10 silver and seven bronze.
Stanford alumnus Pablo

Olympic competition. Not only did
Morales help Stanford to capture
three consecutive NCAA Champi
onships while at the collegiate level,
but he also won five medals in two
Olympic Games — one gold and
two silver in Los Angeles and two
golds in Barcelona.
Women's swimming and diving
has paralleled the success of its
male counterpart in Olympic com
petition. Diver Marjorie Gestring
Bowman initiated the women's
achievement when she captured
the gold medal in springboard div
ing at the 1936 Games in Berlin.
Since then, Cardinal women
swimmers and divers have cap
tured 19 gold, 11 silver and three
bronze medals in Olympic competi

individuals have been associated
with women's swimming and div

most successful women athletes in
Olympic competition. Together
they have won nine medals in two
Olympic games — six golds, two sil
vers and one bronze.
In the coaching capacity, the
Cardinal has been equally success
ful. Both Richard Quick, the cur
rent head coach of women's swim
ming and diving, and Skip Kenney,
the current head coach of men's
swimming and diving, were named
head coaches of the 1996 United
States Olympic swimming team.
Both coaches have taken the
Cardinal to the top ranks of colle
giate swimming and diving compe
tition. They have coached their re
spective teams to six national titles
each.
The long line of swimming and
diving excellence will continue this
year as eight athletes, including
Stanford alumni, current students
and incoming freshman, vie for the
gold in Atlanta.
Track and Field
Forty-four Stanford individuals
have competed in 18 Olympiads
since 1908. In total, Stanford has
brought home 17 medals, including
seven golds. \
Bob Mathias, one of the Cardi
nal's track and field standouts in
this long Olympic tradition, won
back-to-back Olympic decathlon
medals, setting a new world record
at the '52 Games.
Continuing in Stanford's
Olympic track and field history,
six Stanford alumni will compete
in the '96 Games in Atlanta over
the next two weeks.
Volleyball
Four Stanford alumni will com
pete in Atlanta for the U.S. Olympic

volleyball team. Fred Sturm, a for

ford women's team (1978-1985)
and men's team (1986-1990), was
named the head coach of this year's
men's team.

Water Polo
Stanford has enjoyed a solid tra
dition of water polo success. It is
the only team in the nation to have
two undefeated seasons (1981 and
1986).
Since 1924, twenty-three Stan
ford-affliliated players and coaches
have competed in 13 Olympiads,
with the '81 team contributing
three Olympians and the '86 team
contributing two.
Continuing in this tradition,
three Stanford alumni will compete
for the U.S. Water Polo Team in At
lanta.
Women's Basketball
In women's basketball, two Car
dinal athletes have participated in
Olympic competition. Both Katy
Steding and Jennifer Azzi, alum
nae of Stanford women's basket
ball, were alternates on the '92
Olympic team. Both were named to
this year's roster, Azzi as a starter
and Steding as a reserve.
In addition, head coach Tara
VanDerveer, who has led the Cardi
nal to two NCAA championships
and four appearances in the Final
Four, was named the head coach of
the 1996 U.S. Olympic Women's
Basketball Team, which finished

Morales has been one of the Cardi
nal's most successful athletes in
Olympic competition. Not only did

three consecutive NCAA Champi
onships while at the collegiate level,
but he also won five medals in two
Olympic Games — one gold and
two silver in Los Angeles and two
golds in Barcelona.
Women's swimming and diving

male counterpart in Olympic com
petition. Diver Marjorie Gestring
Bowman initiated the women's
achievement when she captured
the gold medal in springboard div
ing at the 1936 Games in Berlin.
Since then, Cardinal women
swimmers and divers have cap

rent head coach of women's swim
ming and diving, and Skip Kenney,
the current head coach of men's
swimming and diving, were named
head coaches of the 1996 United
States Olympic swimming team.
Both coaches have taken the
Cardinal to the top ranks of colle
giate swimming and diving compe
tition. They have coached their re
spective teams to six national titles
each.
The long line of swimming and
diving excellence will continue this
year as eight athletes, including
Stanford alumni, current students
and incoming freshman, vie for the
gold in Atlanta.
Track and Field
Forty-four Stanford individuals
have competed in 18 Olympiads
since 1908. In total, Stanford has
brought home 17 medals, including
seven golds. \
Bob Mathias, one of the Cardi
nal's track and field standouts in
this long Olympic tradition, won
back-to-back Olympic decathlon
medals, setting a new world record
at the '52 Games.
Continuing in Stanford's
Olympic track and field history,
six Stanford alumni will compete
in the '96 Games in Atlanta over
the next two weeks.
Volleyball
Four Stanford alumni will com
pete in Atlanta for the U.S. Olympic

volleyball team. Fred Sturm, a for
mer head coach of both the Stan
ford women's team (1978-1985)
and men's team (1986-1990), was
named the head coach of this year's
men's team.

Water Polo
Stanford has enjoyed a solid tra
dition of water polo success. It is
the only team in the nation to have
two undefeated seasons (1981 and
1986).
Since 1924, twenty-three Stan
ford-affliliated players and coaches
have competed in 13 Olympiads,
with the '81 team contributing
three Olympians and the '86 team
contributing two.
Continuing in this tradition,
three Stanford alumni will compete
for the U.S. Water Polo Team in At
lanta.

ball, were alternates on the '92
Olympic team. Both were named to
this year's roster, Azzi as a starter
and Steding as a reserve.

Coach Tara VanDerveer
In its rich athletic tradition, the
Cardinal has enjoyed a long history
of both NCAA championships and
()lympic achievement I laving just
received the prestigious Sears Di
rectors' Cup for the second year in a
row, Stanford can boast of one of
the most comprehensive and suc
cessful athletic departments in the
country.
Throughout the world, Stanford
athletes have traveled with their
competitive spirit aimed toward
victory, and they have succeeded in
capturing several titles along the
way. This competitive spirit will
continue tomorrow and throughout
the next two weeks as 39 Stanford
aflliated athletes— including Stan
ford alumni, coaches, current stu
dents and incoming freshmen — vie
for gold at the 1996 Centennial
Olympic Games in Atlanta, Geor
gia.
Stanford has been represented
consistently by several athletes in
previous Olympic competitions.
Thirty-eight members of the Cardi
nal family competed in the 1992
Olympics in Barcelona, and 41 ath
letes took part in the 1988 (James in
Seoul, South Korea.
In its history of Olympic compe
tition, the Cardinal has captured
more than 90 medals since Sam
Bellah, a Stanford alumnus, tied for
sixth place in the 1908 pole vault
competition.
In fact, Stanford's most recent
Olympic history places the Univer
sity in competition with entire
countries in terms of the medal
rankings. If Stanford athletes were
considered a country at the 1992
Games in Barcelona, the Cardinal
would have placed 13th in the world
with its 19 medals, and ninth in the
world with its 10 golds.
While this overall picture is im
pressive, the sport-by-sport break
down is even more overwhelming.
Baseball
Five Stanford baseball players
and one Stanford coach have com
peted for the United States in two
Olympic baseball competitions.
The Cardinal's most successful
showing in baseball occurred at the
1988 Games in Seoul. Head coach
Mark Marquess, who led Stanford
to back-to-back College World Se
ries titles in '87 and '88, catcher
Doug Robbins and third base
man/designated hitter Ed Sprague
captured the gold medal for the
U.S. baseball team that year.
Pitcher Willie Adams, outfielder
Jeffrey Hammonds and pitcher
Rich Helling also competed success
fully at the '92 CJames in Barcelona,
leading the U.S. team to a fourth
place finish.
The Cardinal Olympic baseball
tradition will continue this year as
recent graduate A.J. Hinch com
petes on the U.S. Olympic team.
Hinch is expected to be the starting
catcher for the team in Atlanta.
Beach Volleyball
Two Stanford alumnae, Barbra
Fontana-Harris and Nancy Reno,
will compete for the U.S. team in

the two-player Beach Volleyball
competition in Atlanta. Reno, along
with Holly McPeak, is ranked sec
ond going into the competition.
This is the first year that beach vol
leyball is an Olympic medal event.
Fencing
One Stanford alumnus will be
competing for the '96 team in At
lanta. Stanford's current women's
head coach, Sherry Posthumus,
was named manager for the team,
and Stanford men's head coach

tant coach.
Field Hockey
Although no Stanford-afTliated
athletes will be competing in
Olympic competition this year in
field hockey, two Stanford alumnae
have competed in three previous
Olympiads.
Sheryl Johnson, who is the cur
rent head coach of the Stanford
field hockey program, was one of
those two players. She competed in
both the '80 and '84 Games, captur
ing a bronze medal in Los Angeles.
She was also the co-captain of the
'88 U.S. team.
Gymnastics
Alumnus Jair Lynch, incoming
freshman Amy Chow and sopho

in high diving and the silver in

springboard diving at the Antwerp
Olympics, Stanford men's swim
