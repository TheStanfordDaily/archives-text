# Olympics '96
## Former Olympians reminisce about the Games 
### Michael Harville 
Over the next two weeks, while
a small army of about 50 Stanford
students and alumni compete in
the XXVI Olympiad in Atlanta, a
much larger group of former Stan
ford Olympians will be watching
them and reminiscing.
Stanford has been represented
at every summer Olympics since
1908, with more than 500 individ
uals helping the University to gar
ner more medals than all but 21
nations. Six of the people who con
tributed to this impressive legacy
took the time to share their
Olympic experiences from seven
different decades with The Week
ly.
Harlow Rothert ('2B, '32
Games)
Harlow Rothert, who graduated
with degrees in economics in 1930
and law in 1937, was making
Olympic memories before the
grandparents of most current
Stanford undergraduates were
born. Rothert competed in the shot
put in the Amsterdam (1928) and
Los Angeles (1932) Olympiads,
winning the silver medal in 1932.
Since these games took place be
fore the dawn of commercial air
lines, travel logistics played a
prominent role in Rothert's
Olympic experience.
"The Stanford track team took
the train to a big meet at the New
York Athletic Club in May of 1928,
and from there some of us went on
to the intercollegiate champi
onships at Boston in early June,
and then to the Olympic qualifying
meet in mid-June," Rothert ex
plained. "I never had a chance to
get back to Stanford to take my
final exams, and I had to take in
completes in all of my courses."
Having made the Olympic
team, his travels were not over yet.
"Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur was
head of the Olympic team in 1928, "
Rothert recalled, "and he took the
entire team in one big ship to Am
sterdam. We steered up one of the
canals in Denmark, parked at a
dock in the city, and that was our
hotel for the duration of the
Olympics."
Rothert's Olympic success was
complemented by a spectacular
athletic career at Stanford. He
won the intercollegiate shot put
championship three years in a
row, helping the track team win
the overall championship twice.
He was point guard and captain of
the basketball team, and was se
lected for the national All-Ameri
can team. He also played fullback
and halfback for the football team,
and was selected as a second-team
Ail-American by a committee that
included Knute Rockne and Pop
Warner.
After receiving his law degree in
1937, Rothert worked for a local
firm until World War 11, when he
served in the marine corps. After
ward, he started his own firm with
two other Stanford graduates,
practicing law until his retirement
in 1993.
A Menlo Park resident, Rothert

remains physically active at 88
years of age. This spring, he was
one of the oldest people in the na
tion to participate in the Olympic
torch relay, carrying it through
part of San Jose.
Hob Mathias ('4B, '52 Games)
Another man with rather dis
tant Olympic memories is two
time decathlon champion Bob
Mathias. Mathias first won the

event in London
in 1948, just after
graduating from
high school in Tu
lare, California,
at age 17. He de
scribed this suc
cess as almost ac
cidental.
"My high school
coach, Virgil
Jackson, came up
to me one day and
said, 'I just heard
about a track
meet called the
Pasadena Games
where they have
some event called
the decathlon,
and I thought
you might want
to enter it.' The
meet was just a
week after my
high school grad
uation, so I fig
ured I might as
well do it. Be
cause of World
War 11, we hadn't
had the Olympics
since 1936, when
I was four years
old, and I really
didn't know what
the decathlon
was. Anyway, I
was fortunate
enough to win it.
"Not long after
that, my coach
told me about an
other meet in
Bloomington,
Ind., where they
had another de
cathlon. I went
mostly because I
had never been
outside of Califor
nia before, and I
ended up winning
again. The meet
happened to be
the Olympic qual
ifying meet, and
the next thing I
knew I was on my
way to London,

where I won again. So in three
months, I went from not knowing
what a decathlon was to being its
Olympic champion."
Mathias entered Stanford in
1949 and graduated with a degree
in education, with a minor in
speech and drama, in 1953. In the
summer of 1952, Stanford track
coaches spent every day with him
alone at Angel Field preparing him
for another Olympics. He again
qualified for the decathlon and
went on to win the gold in Helsin

ki, Norway.
After graduating, Mathias
served in the marine corps and
then spent four years in the mo
tion picture business. He made
several movies, including "The
Bob Mathias Story," and appeared
in a television show called "The
Troubleshooters." He later served
four terms as a U.S. Congressman
from California's 18th District,
until 1974. He was also appointed
head of the U.S. Olympic training

center, and he ran the Bob Math
ias Boys and Girls Camp in the
Sierra Nevada for many years.
Today he is "semi-retired."
Bill Toomey ('6B Games)
Stanford is fortunate to count
not one but two Olympic de
cathlon champions among its
alumni. In 1968, Bill Toomey, who
received a master's degree in edu
cation from Stanford in 1964, set
an Olympic decathlon record on

the way to winning the gold medal
in Mexico City. He had just missed
making the Olympic team in 1964,
and he credits his Stanford educa
tion as one of the most important
factors in helping him to rebound
from this disappointment and
achieve his dream.
"The decathlon is an event that
is held over several days, that can
involve adverse weather condi
tions and that requires a wide vari
ety of athletic skills and prepara-

tion. You have to be your own psy
chologist, your own doctor, your
own motivator. It's an event that
really requires introspection, and I
learned that it's the mind that cre
ates the energy. Formal education
is typically not viewed as a tool for
athletic competition, but I think
my classes at Stanford were proba
bly the single most effective
weapon I had in my arsenal."
Toomey cites a class taught by
Prof. Dwight Allen, former head of
the Education Department, as one
of the turning points in his life.
"It helped me come to view my
training as an organizational pur
suit of excellence, almost like
starting and running a small busi
ness," he said. "You have to inves
tigate what you hope to get out of
it, find out what you need to get
started, learn to organize your
time, monitor your activity, and so
on."
Toomey summarized, "If I

hadn't gone to Stanford, I proba
bly would have done okay [in ath
letics], but not nearly as well as I
did."
Toomey spent several years as a
teacher at Santa Barbara City Col
lege, has spent much time raising
money for the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee and is currently the vice
president of marketing for Natur
al Alternatives International, a
nutritional supplement company.

Hencken and Bruner ('72, '76,
['80] Games)
In the recent past, an increas
ingly larger portion of Stanford's
Olympic success has come in the
water, not on the track. In the
19705, two of the swimmers most
responsible for this success were
John Hencken and Mike Bruner.
At Munich in 1972, just before
entering Stanford, Hencken
placed third and first in the 100-
meter and 200-meter breaststroke
events, respectively, setting the
world record in the latter race. He
took off spring quarter in 1976 to
train for the Olympics in Montre
al, where he won the 100-meter
breaststroke, placed second in the
200-meter breaststroke, and
helped the medley relay team set a
world record. That quarter off
pushed his graduation date back to
1977, when he received a degree in



Harlow Rothert in his competitive days as a shot putter, left, and now
outside his Menlo Park home. Rothert, a silver medalist in the 1932
Olympic Games in Los Angeles, also played as a fullback and was
basketball captain at Stanford.
