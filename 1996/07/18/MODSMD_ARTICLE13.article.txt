# Olympics '96
## Former Olympians reminisce about the Games 
### Michael Harville 
Over the next two weeks, while
a small army of about 50 Stanford
students and alumni compete in
the XXVI Olympiad in Atlanta, a
much larger group of former Stan
ford Olympians will be watching
them and reminiscing.
Stanford has been represented
at every summer Olympics since
1908, with more than 500 individ
uals helping the University to gar
ner more medals than all but 21
nations. Six of the people who con
tributed to this impressive legacy
took the time to share their
Olympic experiences from seven
different decades with The Week
ly.
Harlow Rothert ('2B, '32
Games)
Harlow Rothert, who graduated
with degrees in economics in 1930
and law in 1937, was making
Olympic memories before the
grandparents of most current
Stanford undergraduates were
born. Rothert competed in the shot
put in the Amsterdam (1928) and
Los Angeles (1932) Olympiads,
winning the silver medal in 1932.
Since these games took place be
fore the dawn of commercial air
lines, travel logistics played a
prominent role in Rothert's
Olympic experience.
"The Stanford track team took
the train to a big meet at the New
York Athletic Club in May of 1928,
and from there some of us went on
to the intercollegiate champi
onships at Boston in early June,
and then to the Olympic qualifying
meet in mid-June," Rothert ex
plained. "I never had a chance to
get back to Stanford to take my
final exams, and I had to take in
completes in all of my courses."
Having made the Olympic
team, his travels were not over yet.
"Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur was
head of the Olympic team in 1928, "
Rothert recalled, "and he took the
entire team in one big ship to Am
sterdam. We steered up one of the
canals in Denmark, parked at a
dock in the city, and that was our
hotel for the duration of the
Olympics."
Rothert's Olympic success was
complemented by a spectacular
athletic career at Stanford. He
won the intercollegiate shot put
championship three years in a
row, helping the track team win
the overall championship twice.
He was point guard and captain of
the basketball team, and was se
lected for the national All-Ameri
can team. He also played fullback
and halfback for the football team,
and was selected as a second-team
Ail-American by a committee that
included Knute Rockne and Pop
Warner.
After receiving his law degree in
1937, Rothert worked for a local
firm until World War 11, when he
served in the marine corps. After
ward, he started his own firm with
two other Stanford graduates,
practicing law until his retirement
in 1993.
A Menlo Park resident, Rothert

remains physically active at 88
years of age. This spring, he was
one of the oldest people in the na
tion to participate in the Olympic
torch relay, carrying it through
part of San Jose.
Hob Mathias ('4B, '52 Games)
Another man with rather dis
tant Olympic memories is two
time decathlon champion Bob
Mathias. Mathias first won the

event in London
in 1948, just after
graduating from
high school in Tu
lare, California,
at age 17. He de
scribed this suc
cess as almost ac
cidental.
"My high school
coach, Virgil
Jackson, came up
to me one day and
said, 'I just heard
about a track
meet called the
Pasadena Games
where they have
some event called
the decathlon,
and I thought
you might want
to enter it.' The
meet was just a
week after my
high school grad
uation, so I fig
ured I might as
well do it. Be
cause of World
War 11, we hadn't
had the Olympics
since 1936, when
I was four years
old, and I really
didn't know what
the decathlon
was. Anyway, I
was fortunate
enough to win it.
"Not long after
that, my coach
told me about an
other meet in
Bloomington,
Ind., where they
had another de
cathlon. I went
mostly because I
had never been
outside of Califor
nia before, and I
ended up winning
again. The meet
happened to be
the Olympic qual
ifying meet, and
the next thing I
knew I was on my
way to London,

where I won again. So in three
months, I went from not knowing
what a decathlon was to being its
Olympic champion."
Mathias entered Stanford in
1949 and graduated with a degree
in education, with a minor in
speech and drama, in 1953. In the
summer of 1952, Stanford track
coaches spent every day with him
alone at Angel Field preparing him
for another Olympics. He again
qualified for the decathlon and
went on to win the gold in Helsin

ki, Norway.
After graduating, Mathias
served in the marine corps and
then spent four years in the mo
tion picture business. He made
several movies, including "The
Bob Mathias Story," and appeared
in a television show called "The
Troubleshooters." He later served
four terms as a U.S. Congressman
from California's 18th District,
until 1974. He was also appointed
head of the U.S. Olympic training

center, and he ran the Bob Math
ias Boys and Girls Camp in the
Sierra Nevada for many years.
Today he is "semi-retired."
Bill Toomey ('6B Games)
Stanford is fortunate to count
not one but two Olympic de
cathlon champions among its
alumni. In 1968, Bill Toomey, who
received a master's degree in edu
cation from Stanford in 1964, set
an Olympic decathlon record on

the way to winning the gold medal
in Mexico City. He had just missed
making the Olympic team in 1964,
and he credits his Stanford educa
tion as one of the most important
factors in helping him to rebound
from this disappointment and
achieve his dream.
"The decathlon is an event that
is held over several days, that can
involve adverse weather condi
tions and that requires a wide vari
ety of athletic skills and prepara-

tion. You have to be your own psy
chologist, your own doctor, your
own motivator. It's an event that
really requires introspection, and I
learned that it's the mind that cre
ates the energy. Formal education
is typically not viewed as a tool for
athletic competition, but I think
my classes at Stanford were proba
bly the single most effective
weapon I had in my arsenal."
Toomey cites a class taught by
Prof. Dwight Allen, former head of
the Education Department, as one
of the turning points in his life.
"It helped me come to view my
training as an organizational pur
suit of excellence, almost like
starting and running a small busi
ness," he said. "You have to inves
tigate what you hope to get out of
it, find out what you need to get
started, learn to organize your
time, monitor your activity, and so
on."
Toomey summarized, "If I

hadn't gone to Stanford, I proba
bly would have done okay [in ath
letics], but not nearly as well as I
did."
Toomey spent several years as a
teacher at Santa Barbara City Col
lege, has spent much time raising
money for the U.S. Olympic Com
mittee and is currently the vice
president of marketing for Natur
al Alternatives International, a
nutritional supplement company.

Hencken and Bruner ('72, '76,
['80] Games)
In the recent past, an increas
ingly larger portion of Stanford's
Olympic success has come in the
water, not on the track. In the
19705, two of the swimmers most
responsible for this success were
John Hencken and Mike Bruner.
At Munich in 1972, just before
entering Stanford, Hencken
placed third and first in the 100-
meter and 200-meter breaststroke
events, respectively, setting the
world record in the latter race. He
took off spring quarter in 1976 to
train for the Olympics in Montre
al, where he won the 100-meter
breaststroke, placed second in the
200-meter breaststroke, and
helped the medley relay team set a
world record. That quarter off
pushed his graduation date back to
1977, when he received a degree in



Harlow Rothert in his competitive days as a shot putter, left, and now
outside his Menlo Park home. Rothert, a silver medalist in the 1932
Olympic Games in Los Angeles, also played as a fullback and was
basketball captain at Stanford.
engineering product design.
"I had always wanted to go to
Stanford, and swimming was my
road there. I tried to be more the
student [than the athlete] while I
was there, and I didn't put as
much effort into swimming as I
could have," Hencken said. "I still
did well [in swimming] — I won
most of the time — but I put the
focus on academics because I
knew my education would be
what would carry me through my
life."
Hencken has gone on to have a
successful and diverse career in
electronics design, eventually
moving toward the computer in
dustry. He is now a client-server
computer software consultant, in
addition to being an assistant pas
tor in a local church.
Hencken made the Olympic
team in the 100-meter and 200-
meter breaststroke events again
in 1980, but missed his chance at
more medals when the American
team boycotted the Moscow
games. "I was definitely disap
pointed," recalled Hencken,
"since I was on track to become
one of the only swimmers in re
cent history to win medals in
three Olympics. But I felt worse
for the 'kids' — I call them kids be
cause I was one of the older swim
mers at the time — who maybe
had not been to an Olympics be
fore."
One of those more deeply disap
pointed "kids," in a relative sense,
was Mike Bruner. He had graduat
ed from Stanford with a degree in
art and design in 1979, married his
longtime girlfriend and moved
with his wife to Arizona to train
with his old coach.
"My wife had cashed in her sav
ings bonds and was working 55
hours a week to support us while I

trained," Bruner explained. "In
February [1980], when Carter
raised the possibility of not going
to the Olympics, I could barely
even train for a couple weeks. I had
to ask myself, 'Why am I doing
this?' and I learned that in the real
world the rules can change, and
that you have to keep setting your
own goals."
Bruner recovered from this
blow to qualify for the 1980 team
in three events, achieving the high
point total among all participants
in both the indoor nationals and
the qualifying meet.
Fortunately, Bruner already
had some Olympic medals in his
trophy case. In 1976 at Montreal,
in the midst of a two-year break
from Stanford, Bruner won the
gold in the 200-meter butterfly
and the 200-meter freestyle relay,
setting world records in both
events. His performance was a
great surprise to most sports ob
servers.
"Anyone who made any projec
tions on the 200-meter butterfly
had me fighting it out for third
place, behind the other two Amer
icans. But I remember when I got

on the bus with all the other
Olympic athletes to go to training
camp, and I was able to look
through the Olympic program. By
the end of the ride, maybe about
20 minutes, I had determined
from the program that the 200-
meter butterfly was going to be the
very first event to award medals.
When I got off that bus, as far as I
was concerned, I was going to win.
"The race itself — I dove in the
water, and I don't remember any
thing else that happened, I don't
remember any pain. I had never
experienced anything like that,"
Bruner said. "Later, when I saw
Jim McKay [on ABC] talking
about me as 'the first American
gold medal winner,' it was just like
I had envisioned it. The whole
thing was very special."
Bruner currently lives in the
Bay Area and administrates land
development projects for Sobrato
Development Companies.
Jenna Johnson ('B4 Games)
In the 1980s, Stanford women
began to assert a higher profile at
the Olympics, particularly in the

water. In 1984, future Stanford
student Jenna Johnson, at age 16,
won gold medals in Los Angeles in
the 400-meter freestyle relay and
the 400-meter medley relay, and
she a won a silver in the 100-meter
butterfly.
"I was so young then that I was
mostly in awe of everyone around
me," Johnson said. She once asked
Mary Lou Retton to stand up so
she could find out just how short
she was, and she recalls stepping
onto an elevator with Edwin
Moses at the Olympic dormitory
and being "amazed that I was on
the same Olympic team as these
people."
The opening ceremonies were
also particularly memorable. "The
American team sort of got into
trouble for not staying in line and
for taking pictures of the crowd
while we marched around the sta
dium. We had been told not to do
this, but I smuggled my camera in
like most other people. It was real
ly neat to have such a great crowd
of Americans supporting us."
Johnson did not participate in
the Olympics while at Stanford,
but her swimming still had a pro

found impact on her Stanford ex
perience.
"I was always sort of a shy per
son. But during my freshman year
at Stanford, people were always
coming up to me and saying,
'Ohhhh, you're the swimmer,' and
it became a sort of conversation
piece. It made me really open up,
and no one ever believed that I was
this shy person."
She also remembers the diffi
culties of juggling athletics and
classes. "Swim team practice
took up to five to six hours per
day, and I got into this routine of
sleeping from about midnight to
5:30 a.m. I seemed to be able to
handle less sleep okay, but it was
always a problem to find enough
hours in the day to do my school
work."
Johnson graduated from Stan
ford in 1990 with a degree in com
munication. She dabbled in broad
casting a bit, but like most recent
Stanford graduates, is still trying
to figure out what she wants to do
with her life. Currently, she is
coaching the University of Ten
nessee women's swim team while
attending classes there.
