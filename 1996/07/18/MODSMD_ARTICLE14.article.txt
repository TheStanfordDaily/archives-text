# Athletes put bodies to the test for the Olympics

One of the reasons the human
race has been so successful in terms
of survival on this planet is adapt
ability. The human body has the ca
pacity to respond to a changing envi
ronment.
In a similar way, the successful
athlete must adapt his or her body to
high strength and high endurance
activities. He or she must out-com
pete the many other athletes by run
ning the fastest or jumping the far
thest or lifting the heaviest object.
Pressures to be the best even lead
some to use performance-enhancing
drugs, such as steroids.
The athletes assembled for the
XXVI Olympiad are by far the fittest
and most highly trained people in the
world. In the case of college athletes,
"once the season hits, we're doing
something normally six days a
week," said Mark Wateska, head
strength coach for Stanford varsity
athletics. "The NCAA makes us take
one day off a week, so we'll take Mon
days off."
Presumably, the Olympic Com

mittee doesn't have such a require
ment. Wateska explained that this
does not mean athletes work out
eight hours a day. The gains in
strength are "directly proportional
to the... intensity used in the train
ing session," he said, pointing out
that although the athletes might lift
for an hour a day,"it is an all-out ef
fort, after which their bodies are
shot. They couldn't take any more."
In fact, athletes can over-train, in
which case their strength decreases
instead of increases, and they predis
pose themselves to certain types of
injuries such as tendinitis or pulled
muscles. More training wouldn't
necessarily result in greater gains,
because the body needs time to re
cover.
"The body can only take so much.
There's a fine line between doing too
much and doing the right amount,"
Wateska said.
Although these facts may suggest
that there is a limit to the bounds of
human conditioning, both Wateska
and Todd Toriscelli, the head athlet
ic trainer at Stanford, stated that no
one reaches his or her maximum po

tential. In fact, the more fit a body
gets, the harder it is to make gains in
strength and endurance.
When those gains are achieved,
however, it can make a difference be
tween being a champion and coming
in second.
Pressure to be the best
The competition of the Olympic
games puts pressure on every athlete
to perform as well as his or her ge
netic make-up will allow. As a result,
some athletes have attempted to de
crease the amount of time needed to
reach their potential or to even su
persede their genetic limitations by
using anabolic steroids and other
performance-enhancing drugs in
training and competition.
Toriscelli said drugs, such as the
steroid testosterone, primarily func
tion in"the development of strength,
in tissue repair, aggressiveness — all
the things that would benefit an ath
lete."
Describing the "tremendous" ef
fects that steroids can have, Toriscel
li said steroids could turn a 6'2" 200-

pound weight lifter who can press
300 pounds into a behemoth 230-
pounder who can press up to 400
pounds. "[lt] puts you in a totally dif
ferent category," he added.
Research into how steroids work
to improve performance is inconclu
sive. The best information is not in
the scientific data banks, but in the
athletes that have used them for
years.
Some of the problems with scien
tific studies is that the level of
steroids used in laboratory experi
ments aren't comparable to the
much higher levels athletes actually
use. Additionally, it is difficult to do
double-blind studies — needed to ex
clude bias during experimentation
— because subjects can tell easily
when they've received the experi
mental drug in question versus a
control (placebo).
The most cohesive assessment of
the available research comes from an
article by medical researchers Daniel
Smith and Paul Perry in the Annals
of Pharmacotherapy, in which the
authors state that there are several
theories about how steroids work to

improve the size and strength of an
individual. These include modifying
the effects of stress on the body,
stimulation of protein synthesis, in
creased red blood cell production and
an increase in motivation with a de
crease in fatigue.
Anabolic steroids modify the ef
fects of stress on the body in the fol
lowing way. The stress of athletic
training causes steroid hormones to
be produced by the adrenal cortex in
the brain. These naturally-produced
steroids cause a negative nitrogen
balance in the body. In order to coun
teract this negative balance, the ni
trogen stores of the body are tapped.
A person working out must consume
large amounts of protein to maintain
a positive nitrogen balance.
Anabolic steroids bind to the
same cellular receptor in muscles as
the steroid hormones and interfere
with the action of those naturally oc
curring substances. This may re
verse the negative nitrogen balance,
provided there is adequate protein
intake, resulting in higher perfor-
