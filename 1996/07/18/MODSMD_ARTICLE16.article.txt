# Commercial Olympics?

### Esther Pan 
Just what are the modern
Olympics anyway?
The world's largest gathering
of the premiere athletes in the
world, a breeding ground for
knee-jerk nationalism and jingo
istic patriotism or one big, ugly
commercial sponsor-fest?
Answer: All of the above.
The 1996 Centennial Olympics
will be the largest peacetime
event ever. Ten thousand ath
letes, 100,000 volunteers, 2 mil
lion visitors and 4.3 billion view
ers at home (two-thirds of the
world population) make these
Games more than a sporting
event — they're a global happen
ing.
These aren't just schlumps
coming. The average Olympic
athlete has spent eight to 13
years of hard training to get to
this point. That's half a lifetime
of missed sleepovers, six a.m.
workouts and no ski trips. They
didn't get that muscle tone from
watching "Friends" and "Sein
feld" on Thursday nights; when
the announcer talks about in
credible dedication and tremen
dous sacrifice, it's not just a
cliche. It's true.
Which makes it disturbing

when the Games become more,
and less, than what they once
were. More commercial, more
TV-friendly, more crowded with
professional prima donnas. Less
friendly, less idealistic, less full
of awe, less accepting of failure.
Ask Dan O'Brian — he can be
the world champion decathlete
as many times as he wants, but if
he doesn't win a gold medal in
these Olympics he'll always be
the guy who no-heighted in '92.
A current Nike series of ad
vertisements in the MARTA sta
tions underlines this point. Fea
turing grainy, close-up black and
white photos of Nike-sponsored
athletes like Sheryl Swoopes and
Monica Seles, the mini-bill
boards proclaim in bold red let
ters such slogans as "I didn't
come to trade pins," "Pageantry
is a distraction" and "You don't
win silver — you lose gold."
There's a nice message for the
kids at home: Forget about in
ternational understanding, ex
panded global awareness or the
enormous accomplishment of
just getting here — if you don't
win, you might as well stay
home.
America's obsession with
winning, with being the unques
tioned, dominant, in-your-face

best, leads to the "Dream Team"
phenomenon, illustrated by
Grant Hill saying, "We're not
like the others — we didn't come
here to mix with them," to ex
plain why the zillionaire basket
ball players, used to a posher
lifestyle, are staying in a luxury
hotel instead of the Olympic Vil
lage. We don't just win, we rub
the victory in your face.
That these spoiled superstars
are taking away media attention
from African runners, Pakistani
field hockey players or American
rowers, archers, weight lifters
and equestrians is an insult to
the latters' grueling, thankless
training, far out of the spotlight,
and the tremendous obstacles
which truly amateur athletes
must conquer to reach the
Olympics. We hear enough
about Andre Agassi and
Shaquille O'Neal during the reg
ular, media-saturated sports
year; in these short two weeks,
tell us about Tinker Juarez, Mia
Hamm and Becky Dyroen-
Lancer. Mountain bikers, soccer
players and synchronized swim
mers don't have the option of
multi-million dollar professional
careers; they can't afford to be
arrogant jerks. This should be
their time to shine.
