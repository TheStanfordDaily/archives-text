# Talisman brings its cultural a cappella to Olympic Games
## 
### Chad Bennett Editorial staff 
When Joseph Pigato founded
Talisman — a Stanford a cappel
la singing group — six years ago,
he had no idea they would some
day wind up performing for ath
letes, fans and diplomats at a
venue as prestigious as the
Olympic Games.

"If you would have told me
back then that Talisman would
have been going to the Olympic
Games — that's crazy," said Pi
gato, who directed and sang in
the group for three years and
has served the group in a public

relations-type role since gradu
ating.
Talisman's 18 members — in
cluding two conga players — will
present their hour-long perfor
mance at a couple different
venues within the Olympic vil
lage, as well as at several smaller
shows in the area.
According to Pigato, "The
Olympics are the thrust of the

whole thing — the rest has just
been Filling out a tour."
Pigato originally formed Tal
isman because he wanted to sing
music that was both more cul
tural and more substantive than
the typical college a cappella. "I

wanted to have a group that
could carry a concert on its own,
without jumping up and down
and singing skits," Pigato said.
Three albums and several
high-profile performances later,
Talisman found themselves per
forming their distinct style of
cultural music at a banquet held
at the house of University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper. Two
guests who saw that perfor
mance were Helen Bing, who,
along with her husband, Peter,
is one of Stanford's most gener
ous supporters; and Sandy
Smith, an Atlanta lawyer with
connections to the Olympic en
tertainment committee.
"It was Helen and Sandy who
kind of started the push towards
the Olympics," Pigato said. "The
Bings have definitely been help
ful."
Talisman's trek to Atlanta
has been funded largely by pri
vate donations such as those
from the Bings. Several alumni
are also providing housing for
the group members during their
Olympic stay, which Pigato
notes will not bear much sem
blance to a vacation.
"We're really going to be
whisked around quite a bit," Pi
gato said. "It won't be like per
form, have a couple days off and
mess around."
"We definitely need to take
things up a level, and that's
what we're planning to do."
