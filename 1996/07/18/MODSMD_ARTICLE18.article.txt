# Bravin hopes to foil Olympic competition
## 
### Esther Pan 
This Olympic year offers some
of the best hopes ever for an
American medal in fencing: The
U.S. Women's Foil Team is cur
rently ranked second in the world.
Look for Felicia Zimmerman, a
19-year-old phenom and 1995
World Junior Champion, Suzie
Paxton and especially Ann Marsh
(No. 1 in the United States, No. 8
in the world) to make a strong run
for medals in both team and indi
vidual events.
In sabre, Peter Westbrook, one
of the few African-American
fencers, is attending his sixth
Olympics. Dominant is hardly the
word for him; he has been nation
al champion in his weapon 16
times in the last 20 years.
In men's foil, Stanford's own
Nick Bravin will try to stage a
huge upset and place in the top
ranks. A two-time Olympian,
three-time NCAA champion and
four-time national champion, the
1993 graduate took a year off
from Columbia Law School to
make a last effort for Olympic
glory.
Also in foil is Cliff Bayer, a fe
rociously intense 18-year-old
headed to the University of Penn
sylvania in the fall who could sur
prise the world; he upset Bravin in
1994 to become the youngest U.S.
national champion ever.
Reflecting its chivalric origins,
fencing as a sport is strongest in
Europe. France (where the inter
national governing body, the Fed
eration Internationale d'Escrime,
or PTE, is located), Germany,
Italy, Hungary and Russia are
perennial powers. These coun
tries have prestigious fencing
training centers, internationally
renowned coaches, and lots of
money dedicated to the sport
In contrast, American fencing

is still mainly the province of ex
patriate coaches teaching middle
class suburban kids whose par
ents can afford to cough up $2,000
for all the required equipment:
mask, glove, shoes, lame vest,
body cord, chest protector, jacket,
knickers and weapon are the basic
requirements.
There are three weapons in the
sport, each with a different target
area. Foil, the lightest weapon,
was the traditional practice
weapon for duels. The target area
is the torso from waist to shoul
ders, hit with the point of the
blade — places that would be fatal
to hit.
For epee, the traditional duel
ing weapon, the target is the en
tire body; a kill can be made any
where from head to toe. Sabre, the
last (and some say most exciting)
weapon, was the traditional caval
ry fighting weapon; the target
area is anywhere from the waist
up, and any hit with the flat or
point of the blade counts as a
touch. Sabre fencers are fun to
watch: loud, emotional and in
tensely dramatic, their playacting
at bad calls provides some of the
best entertainment in competi
tions.
Men fence all three weapons;
women will fence foil and, for the
first time, epee in these Olympics.
The fencing competition will
take place from July 20-25. If the
past is any indication, all Ameri
can viewers will see of fencing is a
two-minute compilation clip, set
to Beatles music, of the entire
event — after it's over. If an
American does well, his or her
bout might make it onto to the
networks, but don't hold your
breath.
Mainstream America may not
be ready for intensive fencing cov
erage, but hey — Bulgarian televi
sion is broadcasting live.
