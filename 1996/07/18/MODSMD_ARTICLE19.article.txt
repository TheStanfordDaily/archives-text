## Washington Diary James G. Wheaton Stanford students: apathetic or just placid? 
### 
IN THE SUMMER, Washing
ton, D.C., becomes a big old
two-month-long Faces in the
Community program — students
from all over the United States
come to make Xerox copies and
pad their resumes.
Often, these hordes of interns
have characteristics of their
school written all over them.
Owen from Princeton gets drunk
a lot and argues politics with
everyone. Kevin from Ohio State
is a decent, corn-fed, clean-cut
jock. Brian from MIT is an ee
major who's also pre-AA.
So what am I (or we?) from
Stanford?
The question first came up
when I was talking to a few stu
dents about their schools. Dave
had all the typical southern gear,
including an Auburn tie, a plenti
ful supply of Jack Daniels and
Confederate flag playing cards.
He was telling us about football
games.
"Well, the tie is for Game
Day."

"And the whiskey's for drink
ing on Game Day?"
"No, that's a sipping whiskey,
not a drinking whiskey. No, on
Game Day, I get my date to carry
a flask of drinking whiskey in her
dress. They never check ladies for
drinks."
For the uninitiated: Game Day
is apparently the name of a
southern ritual where everyone
brings a date, a tie and a good
drinking whiskey to a football
game. And I thought we had too
much jock culture at Stanford.
"Those cards are pretty wild,"
I said, feigning innocence, point
ing towards the orange flag with
the blue cross. To reveal my bias,
Confederate flags rank right be
hind big fat swastikas in my Yan
kee mind.
"I still don't understand why
these northern blacks get so
upset about these things," he
replied.
I resisted the easy answer,
that that slavery thing might
have something to do with it.

Ted didn't — he went kind of
crazy. I was quickly surrounded
by a war on American race rela
tions, with Dave (Duke Jr., it
seems) insisting that there's no
more damn prejudice, and south
ern blacks know that, since they
don't get upset at all about Con
federate flags. Ted, an intern
from Northwestern, took the
standard liberal line, which I
need not elaborate in a Palo Alto
newspaper.
And I kept pretty quiet. It
wasn't worth it.
Fast Forward: On the bus to
Georgetown, where I and many
of these culprits live, a Harvard
and a Yale student were dis
cussing how awful and terrible
the Washington Times is, a less
than-bold proposition (the Wash
ington Times is the Stanford Re
view for grown-ups). Some Newt
worshipping intern in an icky
blue suit took umbrage, claiming
that the Times is a bastion of
good journalism, holding against
the terrible forces of liberalism

that control the mainstream
media.
So there are three indignant
Ivy Leaguers yelling at each
other about a sort of silly topic —
even people like Rush Limbaugh
don't always take the Washing
ton Times at its word.
But man, they argued well.
And they were passionate.
About this little insignificant
thing that had nothing to do with
them. Folks at Stanford get fierce
when statues are garnished with
black paint, CCRI and Prop 187
are on the march and when grapes
appear. But those are largely com
munity issues. We all know stu
dents whose families work on the
farms, or who might get turned
away from an ER if the harshest
187 possible became law.
On other issues, for most of us
I think it's live and let live. It's not
intelligence or knowledge — we
have those in spades. But some
how, all of the Res Ed program
ming and the CIV training worked
— most of us aren't compelled to

tenaciously argue
stupid points.
We'll let dumb
points lie. We'll
relent in an argu
ment without

changing our own beliefs. Maybe
we won't even enter an argument
if it seems unpleasant.
But perhaps we let offensive
statements lie too much. Perhaps
we have too much critical dis
tance from the frenzy, and thus
don't contribute. Whatever it is, I
and most of the Stanford folks I
know just don't seem to have the
killer attitude that the Beltway
needs. I'm not sure if it's placidity
or apathy. But I know 1 don't have
that vitriol, that conviction, that
whatever, that D.C. requires.
Lost it playing Frisbee or some
thing.

James Wheaton is interning at
the White House this summer,
where he will answer Socks' mail
and arrange trysts for the presi
dent.
