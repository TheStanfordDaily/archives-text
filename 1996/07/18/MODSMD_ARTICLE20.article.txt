# My Two Cents
## E. Garry Grundy III The
						search for spirit at a Godless university 
### 
I PROBABLY WON'T go to Big
Game this year. This will be
my third year at Stanford and
still I have been unable to muster
the desire to paint my face cardi
nal red and belt out ad hominen
comments such as "We got in" to
those poor students across the
Bay. "C'mon, Garry," my friends
say persuasively, "you've just got

to get into the school spirit!"
Spirit?
What exactly do you peopU
mean by this word spirit? If then
is anything Stanford is in need of
it is a spirit, but not the type that
endorses face painting and in
creases T-shirt sales at the Book
store.
Stanford University is in neec

of a religious spirit.
Not until I came to Stanford
was I ever hesitant to admit I was
a theist, let alone a Christian. Of
all God's people on this campus,
Christians have received the worst
lot, often being typecast as closed
minded, condescending bigots.
Getting away from Stanford,
one is able to see the stark contrast
between the real world and this
fairy tale devoid of religion. Dur
ing my two quarters in Europe, I
felt the genuine warmth of a reli
gious spiritual community— one
where I was not ashamed to pray
before a meal or make the sign of
the cross. Here, I feel no shame,
only a bit of awkwardness. One
cannot help but feel a bit uncom
fortable when signs saying "Are
Christians Racist?" clothe the
campus. How is one supposed to
feel?
Certainly not welcome!
In the classrooms, professing
some profound sense of divine
spiritualism leaves you open to at
tack. Simply citing God as the enti
ty responsible for establishing the
rules to this game of life merits
only a titter from the class, maybe
even a smirk from your section
leader. In fact, Stanford's spirit
seems more aroused by the adages
of Friedrich Nietzsche than by
those of Jesus Christ. Those
courageous enough to break the

mold risk being called Bible-beat -
ers, homophobes, racists, or nar
row-minded fools; many Chris
tians refrain from uttering a single
word in section, only to ventilate
their frustration in a forum more
receptive to the Christian spirit.
Even in the dorm setting, reli
gious activities are often short
changed. I can never forget the
Christmas tree controversy that
took place in my freshman dorm. I
naively assumed that we would all
be in the Christmas spirit and
throw up a tree. I could not have
been more incorrect. "I'm offend
ed at the very idea of having a
Christmas tree in the dorm," cried
out one of my doormmates. "I feel
put upon with this whole idea of
Christmas." This was all news to
me. How can anyone find fault
with a symbol that is indicative of
giving and love?
Our hyper-intellectualism, cou
pled with our arrogance, permits
us to rationalize God out of the
equation; we assume that we can
create new postulates to adjust old
theorems, thus creating a new
ground floor. I must admit, I find
this most bizarre at an institution
devoted to the pursuit of truths.
I am even more perplexed by
Stanford's lack of tolerance for
spirituality. At the root of this
spiritlessness is our nondenomi
national nature; religious spiritu-

alism is placed in
a very precarious
situation. Often I
attend Universi
ty Public Wor
ship, the regular

Sunday morning service in Memo
rial Church. A few weeks ago, I in
vited a group of young people —
all from different faiths — to wor
ship with me. All of them found
the service to be most unusual,
one going so far as to characterize
it as "weird."
Seeking to welcome rather
than alienate, our religious dispo
sition often ends up alienating
those it assumes are already wel
come. By no means am I submit
ting an exclusionary religious
agenda. I really don't identify my
self with the radical Christian
right-wing. However, I do want to
suggest that the watered-down,
Mcßeligion we have at Stanford is
unacceptable.
In this environment, the "it's
all good" attitude dilutes the po
tency of strong spiritual commu
nity. We should not be afraid to
say: It's not all good! It's not even
mostly good! It's bad ...
.. . much like the religion at
Stanford!
