Asian-American identity

In (perhaps over-defensive) an
ticipation of indignant re
sponses to David Wolitz's col
umn of July 3 ("Are Jews Asian
American?"), I want to congratu
late David on a point well made.
Racial identity is both personal
and political, and the political
component typically knows noth
ing of the personal. That is, no
matter how I understand my own
race and ethnicity, other people
and society in general
(mis-) understand my ethnic iden
tity from my race. It's taken me
many years of exploration and re
flection to work out my own
Asian-Americanness (with hy
phen); it would take anyone a sin

gle glance to work out my Asian
Americanness (without hyphen).
I also support David in his criti
cism of the administration's and
the ethnic centers' treatment of
race and ethnicity. I would throw
in all the movies, TV shows and
magazine and newspaper articles
that claim to say anything about
The Asian-American Experience.
By calling themselves Asian-
American Something, they claim
to include me. They seldom do.
What they do accomplish is the
further separation of my political
from my personal identity.
