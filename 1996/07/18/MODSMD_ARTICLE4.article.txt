## 229 people die as plane explodes after takeoff 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - A TWA jet
liner with 229 people aboard ex
ploded in a fireball shortly after
taking off for Paris and plunged
into the waters off Long Island on
Wednesday night. There was no
sign of survivors.
The 747 jet, Flight 800, was
bound for Charles de Gaulle Air
port from Kennedy Airport when
it went into the Atlantic Ocean 20
miles off Moriches Inlet at about
8:45 p.m. The site off the south
shore of the island is about 40
miles east of New York City.
"It was a big orange fireball. ..
you saw nothing but flames," said
eyewitness Eileen Daly. "My ini
tial reaction was what is it?... Oh
my God, it's an airplane!"

Hours after the crash, wreck
age and fuel on the water could be
seen burning. Helicopters dotted
the scene, with some repeatedly
going up and down searching for
bodies with infrared equipment,
while others hovered overhead
trying to illuminate the pitch
black water. A temporary morgue
was set up on shore.
"We are not finding any sur
vivors," said Steve Sapp of the U.S.
Coast Guard. "We are locating lots
of bodies out there."
There were 212 passengers and
17 crew members on the flight, ac
cording to Mike Kelly, a TWA vice
president. He said the plane had
arrived from Athens, Greece, and
had been on the ground about

three hours before its scheduled 8
p.m. takeoff for Paris. Some of the
passengers were from an earlier
canceled flight to Rome.
TWA's Kelly noted the FAA had
been placed on an increased level
of security because of the
Olympics, which begin Friday in
Atlanta, but said there had been
no specific threats against TWA or
the flight.
"We already had one of the
highest levels of security you can
have, but that hasn't changed in
the last few weeks," he said.
Asked about the possibility of a
bomb, Federal Aviation Adminis
tration spokesman Eliot Brenner
said "we can't discuss security is
sues." He said the FAA had no in

formation on whether there was a
distress call.
Vic Fehner, who was fishing on
the bay, said "it started off like a
little ball, like a flare."
"It came down for a few seconds
and all of a sudden burst into
flames, a big ball of flame, and it
just started to rotate around,"
Fehner said.
Jason Fontana, a cook at John
Scott's Raw Bar in Westhampton
Beach, said "it looked like a big
fireball with pieces coming off of it.
You heard two big explosions, like
two big firecrackers going off, just
before sunset."
Coast Guard Lt. Comm. James
McPherson said every available
aircraft and boat had been sent to

the scene, including nine cutters,
two helicopters and two planes.
Crews were also using infrared
night vision goggles to help them
spot bodies, McPherson said. With
a water temperature of 68 degrees
and an air temperature of 73, he
estimated that survival would only
be possible for 12 hours.
"Our primary effort right now
is to look for survivors â€” we'll
worry about the wreckage later,"
said Lt. Kevin Dunn on a cutter at
the scene. He said there were no
divers in the water.
"The reality of what's occurred
is settling in for the people out
there," said Mayor Rudolph Giu
liani. "They're carrying bodies
back to shore."
