# No loitering?
## No more lying on University Ave. 
### Elisabeth Traugott 
A controversial ban on sitting
or lying on Univerity Avenue side
walks which has been 112 ercely chal
lenged by the homeless and their
advocates will be put to a vote at
the Palo Alto City Council meeting
Monday night.
The ban reflects the city gover
nment's concern with the growing
problem of panhandling and loi
tering in the University Avenue
shopping area.
After receiving numerous com
plaints from downtown shoppers
and merchants, the council re
quested that City Attorney Ariel
Calonne design an ordinance
which would make it illegal to ob
struct sidewalks between 7 a.m.
and 11 p.m., the hours of heavy
pedestrian traffic.
All violations would be penal
ized with a fine.
Police Chief Chris Durkin said
at a public hearing at the July 8
council meeting that people sitting
or lying on the sidewalk "impede
the normal flow of pedestrian traf
fic and put people at risk."
But the law is seen by many res
idents as a disingenuous attempt
by city officials to solve the prob

lem of homelessness in Palo Alto
by launching a smoke and mirrors
campaign to promote greater
pedestrian safety.
Lisa Giraud, a homeowner and
40-year resident of Palo Alto, was
one of those who felt that there
were deeper issues at stake. She
told the council at the meeting that
the law "focuses on a particular
class of people" and hinges on the
fact that the poor "have the fur
ther bad luck of living in a place
which makes them particularly
conspicuous."
Giraud's sentiments were
echoed by — among others —
members of the Stanford Home
lessness Action Coalition (SHAC),
a student activist group that
works with the homeless. SHAC
members see the ordinance as a
way to root out undesirables with
out challenging their first am
mendment rights.
According to student-member
Monty Black, SHAC is attempting
to work with the American Civil
Liberties Union in order to put
legal pi assure on the city council.
"We want to let them know that
even if they do pass the law, they
will be taken to court and chal
lenged," said Black, noting the

high cost of the legal process.
"Lawyers are being asked to
choreograph a dance through a
minefield of consitutional law,"
said Joe Baldwin, a Palo Alto resi
dent and member of the board of
the Urban Ministry, a local charity
which provides food and shelter
for the city's burgeoning homeless
population.
But city councilman Gary Fazz
ino claims that neither the council
nor the police force "sees this as a
homeless issue."
Over 30 residents, many of
them homeless, spoke at the meet
ing, and the majority of them in
terpreted the law as a political
ploy.
John Eden, a homeless man,
said the law was really "about
making Palo Alto a nicer and pret
tier city" which in his mind
"cheapened the democratic
process."
Council members will vote on
the ordinance at their July 22
meeting. They have already unan
imously passed two sibling ordi
nances, one which prohibits open
containers in the vicinity of liquor
stores and the other a ban on the
distribution of leaflets or other so
licitation in public parking lots.

Peaceful tree-lined sidewalks along University Avenue in Palo Alto could become contested ground
if a proposed ordinance passes.
