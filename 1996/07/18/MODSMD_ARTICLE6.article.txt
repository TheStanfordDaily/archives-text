# Sand Hill stirs debate
## 
### Anne Ruimy 
The recent release of the Envi
ronmental Impact Report Draft for
the Sand Hill Road Project has once
again stirred debate about the envi
ronmental impacts of the $342 mil
lion project.
The size of the project — which
will widen Sand Hill Road, result in
cheaper rental housing for Stanford
staff, allow for the creation of senior
housing units and bring about a siz
able increase to the Stanford Shop
ping Center — has made it the center
of environmental debate for at least
the last five years. According to Peter
Drekmeier, director of the Palo Alto
based Bay Area Action (BAA) envi
ronmental group, one of the biggest
problems is water run-off.
"Development brings imperme
able surfaces, which increase run
off, which then goes directly through
storm drains into the San Francis
quito creek," he said.
According to Drekmeier, the
water going through storm drains
into the creek could be loaded with
heavy metals and oils, and — in the
case of heavy rains — the mere
amount of it could be problematic,
resulting in floods.
BAA proposes an alternative to
the Sand Hill Road project: ecologi
cal restoration. The native plant
species of the grasslands on Stan
ford's west edge have been replaced
by more exotic species of plants and
trees — such as the eucalyptus —
which makes the area less natural
than it seems. BAA proposes to re
turn the site to its original state, pos
sibly including a nature interpretive
center.
Recreational use of the area is not
without negative environmental im
pact, "but it is a trade-off," Drek
meier said. "It is important that peo

ple are familiar with the area, so that
they know that it is a special place,
and want to protect it."
According to Stanford alumna
Elaine Hill, the project will interrupt
what she calls "a beautiful view."
"I wish I had a camera," Hill said,
describing the beautiful view of the
grassland on the west edge of the
Stanford campus which will be de
veloped when the project begins in
mid-1997. In its place will be 47.8
acres of apartment houses alongside
a path that Hill walks every day to
and from her Menlo Park home.
"Stanford owns all the free land
in the area Why do they have to
build on the last open space close to
campus?" Hill asked.
Shirley Harris, who works at the
Bechtel International Center, has
concerns about the project as well. "I
would like to have assurance that
staff with low-income would benefit
from it. There really isn't any inex
pensive housing for staff in the
area."
Harris enjoys the grassland, too,
but also understands the need for
low-income housing. "There's a
sense of open space. It reminds me of
home [in Minnesota] ... but if this
project is really about providing af
fordable housing for low income
staff at Stanford, I would totally sup
port it. I may even be able to get my
family here."
"Overall," Drekmeier said,
"Stanford University is getting bet
ter at involving the public about en
vironmental Issues.... But I per
sonally can't see what business in
terest, development and a shopping
center have to do with higher educa
tion."
Public hearings regarding the en
vironmental impact report are being
held later this month both in Menlo
Park and in Palo Alto.
