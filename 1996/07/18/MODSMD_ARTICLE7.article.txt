## Summer is singing with sounds of Mozart 
### William Hsieh Contributing writer 
As the second of the three Mid
summer Mozart Festival concerts
in Frost Amphitheater, Saturday
night's program had a last
minute change. Not only was the
order of the program reshuffled,
but the delectable Mozart "Sym
phony No. 28" was dropped.
Salieri's "Concerto for Flute,
Oboe and Orchestra" in C was
first on the program, featuring
flutist Maria Tamburrino and
oboist Roger Wiesmeyer. Though

the soloists tried to project enthu
siasm into the audience, the or
chestral response was lukewarm.
Written by Wiesmeyer, the caden
za for the first movement was
stylistically scored but gave the
flute a more prominent role. The
"Allegretto" finale involved a
spontaneous interplay between
the soloists, creating a sense of
frolic and excitement.
Haydn's infamous "Symphony
No. 94," dubbed "Surprise," was
next. The violin section was con
stantly out of tune in downward
scale passages in D major. The

playing was cautious, with a nar
row range of dynamics and a con-

spicuous lack of
humor in the
piece.
Despite his
marked attempt
to engage the or
chestra, conduc
tor George Cleve
did not seem to
get the sonority
he wanted. In
the end, "The Fi-

nale" had rhythmic drive, but the
overall conception was still con

servative.
After the intermission, things
turned around. Miraculously, the
orchestra sprang to life and re
sponded in earnest to Mozart's
grace and lyricism. Cleve set an
appropriately brisk tempo in the
orchestral introduction. Pianist
Jean Philippe Collard's solo entry
was immediately arresting, with
fine gradations of tonal colors.
The scale passages shone with
jeu perle, and the rippling arpeg
gios were a source of constant de
light. In the andante movement,
Collard conveyed a sense of sim

pie melancholy that was breath
takingly beautiful. Occasionally,
he allowed his left hand to domi
nate, but his playing was always
exquisite down to the last bar.
This was definitely the highlight
of the concert program.
For the next and final concert
of the series in Frost on July 20,
the program will feature
Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony,
Weber's "Konzerstuck" with solo
pianist Melvyn Tan and the ever
popular "1812 Overture," which
will be supplemented by a laser
show.
