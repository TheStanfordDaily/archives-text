# BECK Odelay
## 
### 
Admittedly, Beck's debut
album, "Mellow Gold," was over
hyped and amateurish, so it's un
derstandable if you're sick of lis
tening to it. But you've gotta
admit that you were blown away
the first time you heard "Loser."
Here was this skinny white kid
with an acoustic guitar and a drum
loop spouting fractured pop-culture
brilliance like some post-apocalyp
tic idiot-savant street musician. If
that image wasn't enough to grab
your attention, Beck's melding of
folk, blues, hip-hop and rock was as
catchy as it was revolutionary.
Unfortunately, beyond "Loser,"
"Mellow Gold" didn't have much

to offer. Still, it contained an amaz
ing range of styles, from downbeat,
droney folk tracks ("Steal My Body
Home") to freaky distorted stomps
("Sweet Sunshine") and some sub
"Loser" imitations ("Beercan")
that hinted at Beck's large musical
vocabulary. Who could have possi
bly guessed what Beck could come
up with, given a major-label pro
duction budget and some time in
an actual studio?
One need no longer guess.
"Odelay" is here, a fiercely confi
dent tour de force that blends
country-western, disco soul, party
rap, Dylan folk and sludgy rock
into a cohesive whole. Simple yet
effective riffs, kiekin' drum tracks
and Beck's laid-back stream-of
consciousness lyricism ("Karaoke
weekend at the suicide shack. . ..
Community service and I'm still
the mack" is my fave couplet) are
like nothing you've ever heard.
Even on the first listen, they

stick to your ears like taffy: the
blunt acoustic riffs and overdriven
harmonica wail of "Hotwax," the
broken-carousel melody that kicks
off "The New Pollution," the
country-blues yodel of "Lord Only
Knows" and "Sissyneck," the
creepy junkyard percussion jam
" Derelict" and the fuzzed-out rush
of "Minus."
Scratching the surface of "Ode
lay" reveals a veritable encyclope
dia of pop-music history that is the
cornerstone of Beck's genius, and
the reason music critics love him
so. But that shouldn't matter to
you. The bottom line for is that
"Odelay" is one of those albums
you wonder how you could ever do
without. So let Beck be your guide
on your summer freedom cruise;
stick it in your car stereo and hit
the boulevard.
