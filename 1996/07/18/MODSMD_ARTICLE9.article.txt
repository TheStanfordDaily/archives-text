# CHER It's A Man's World
## 
### 
If ever there was an album de
serving the review "shit sand
wich," it is not Spinal Tap's
"Shark Sandwich" but Cher's new
opus, "It's a Man's World." As she
meanders through the endless 49
1/2 minutes of this album, the lis
tener soon comes to the joyous re
alization that, while it may be a
man's world, at least it's not
Cher's world.
The opening line of "Angels
Running," in which Cher sings, "I
heard enough," sets the tone for
the rest of the album. One quickly
notices that Cher is, to put it kind
ly, not cut out for the music busi
ness. While her voice is tolerable,
the songs she chooses to force her
audience to endure are guaranteed
to drive the most iron-willed lis
tener to violent fits of nausea.
With horrific lyrics like "love is
a gunman/no mercy has he" ("The
Gunman") and"I was either
standin' in your shadow or block
ingyour light" ("Not Enough Love
in the World"), one wonders what
worse terrors might have been un
leashed had Cher actually written

her own songs.
"Love is a Gunman" is without
a doubt the album's worst song, a
trite little ditty about the perils of
love, using (surprise!) the lone
gunman metaphor. From the first
line ("When I enter a room, I will
only sit facing the door/it's love
I'm looking for") to the last ("This
time his sights are fixed on me"),
this song is unbearable.
The one track on the album
with the potential for listenability
is Cher's rendition of the funk
classic "It's a Man's Man's Man's
World." Unfortunately, though,
she mauls James Brown's origi
nal, accentuating the strings and
making it into a soft pop cheese
fest. The listener can be thankful
that Cher has chosen to omit the
otherwise omnipresent drum ma
chine for this song; however, she is
backed by a group of hysterically
ooh-ing backup singers.
One wonders if the godfather of
soul would not prefer another
term in jail to listening to Cher's
interpretation of his song.
The artwork on the album,
while aesthetically a step up from
the music, remains atrocious. It
features four photos of the artist
in different poses, with different
costumes and hairstyles (wigs),
maintaining the same coldly neu
tral expression. The photos are
gratuitously artsy and the holo
gram on the CD itself onlv adds to

the overall sense of inflated self
image.
Put quite simply, Cher's new
album embodies all that is foul, de
spicable and ridiculous about con
temporary soft pop. Debbie Gib
son at her worst was not this bad.

Cher's new album is not as tempting as the CD cover would suggest.
