# Vote on ban postponed
## City attorney to revise proposed ordinance banning sitting or lying on University Ave. 
### Elisabeth Traugott 
The vote on Palo Alto's ban on
sitting or lying on University Av
enue sidewalks has been post
poned indefinitely to give City At
torney Ariel Calonne more time to
revise the law.
A spokeswoman at the city at
torney's office said that the ordi
nance has not been put on the agen
da for any of the meetings prior to
the city council's August recess.
This means that the issue will not
be decided upon until mid-Septem
ber of this year at the earliest.
Calonne said that the council
has asked him to review the law to
try to make exceptions for special
circumstances such as parades
and street performances. While

the council is still interested in
making the sidewalks safer, it is
"not interested in banning street
performers."
The Palo Alto ordinance has
been modeled on the Seattle law
which effectively bans sitting or
lying on sidewalks in an entire
downtown area. Calonne said that
the law that he is crafting will be
less drastic in scope, as "it is only
dealing with a few blocks of one
street."
There continues to be heated
debate over the issue of the rights
of homeless people. This week the
Stanford Housing Action Coali
tion will meet with the local chap
ter of the ACLU to discuss strate
gy for when and if the ordinance is
passed.
