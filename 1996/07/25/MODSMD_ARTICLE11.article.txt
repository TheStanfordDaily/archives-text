## Gymnasts seize gold 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) - There she
was, the worrier.
Just a few months ago, Kerri
Strug's own coaches wondered if
she could muster the confidence
and gusto to go for broke when it
was needed most.
Strug didn't ease those doubts
when her first try to seal Ameri
ca's first team gold in Olympic
women's gymnastics ended with a
thud. That snap she felt in her left
ankle wouldn't help either.
But off she went anyway on her
second try. Down the runway,
over the vault, onto the mat and
into Olympic lore.
Strug kept both feet — her good
one and the one with two torn lig
aments — on the mat long enough
Tuesday to secure the title. At the
same time, she created a new
image for herself that will last for
ever.
"I hope everyone realizes it
took a lot of guts to do the second
vault because I didn't know what
was wrong with my foot," an emo
tionally drained Strug said.
She does not, she said, feel like
a hero. "Everyone else had put so
much time and sacrifice into it. I
couldn't give up."
But she may have to give up on
her dream of competing in the all
around. Team physician Dan Can
said her ankle has only a 50-50
chance of being ready for Thurs
day's all-around finals.
Strug said this morning she

would undergo therapy on her left
ankle and the condition of her in
jury would be updated hourly.
"It's really too early to tell, last
night there was a lot of swelling
and everything happened so fast,"
Strug said on NBC's "Today"
show. "They're just going to see
how far it can come."
The all-around is important to
Strug because she missed it in
Barcelona. She was only 14, the
youngest member of the 1992 U.S.
squad, when she was bumped
from the all-around by teammate
and then-training partner Kim
Zmeskal.
The 4-foot-9 1/2, 80-pound
Strug carried that feeling with her
the last four years, even while
bouncing between gyms and final
ly back to Houston and coach Bela
Karolyi.
Karolyi took her back despite
his concerns about her mental
toughness. She impressed him by
winning the American Cup in
March, her first international
title, but the competition wasn't
completely world class and he ad
mitted then she still had to prove
herself.
Not any more. Now, her second
vault will be one of the defining
events of these games. And it joins
Mary Lou Retton's vault to win
the all-around gold in 1984 as the
two most significant moments in
U.S. gymnastics history.
The Americans would have won

the title and ended Russia's nearly
50-year hold on gold even without
Strug's heroics. But that wasn't
clear at the time.
The United States went into
the final apparatus with a com
fortable lead, then became con
cerned after 14-year-old Do
minique Moceanu landed on her
backside on both her vault tries,
earning a best of only 9.2.
Because each team's lowest

score per event is tossed out, any
thing more than that from Strug
would have been a relief. Instead,
she caused concern with a 9.162
on her first try.
Strug's second vault ended the
Russians' brief hopes. They
wound up in second for the first
time since 1948, the year before
the Soviet Union's powerhouse
began streaking to gold in the next
10 Olympics it entered.

Romai ia, which won in '84
when the Pussians stayed home,
took this year's bronze.
After Karolyi carried Strug
back into the arena for the awards
ceremony, Moceanu and Shannon
Miller helped her up two steps on
the platform.
"We didn't want to march out
without Kerri," team captain
Amanda Borden said. "She gave it
everything she had."
