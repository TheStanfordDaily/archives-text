ATLANTA (AP) — Stanford
alum Janet Evans, the biggest star
without a medal so far, was swim
ming today in the preliminaries of
the 800 freestyle for a last shot at
U.S. Olympic history.
Two days after her stunning fail
ure to qualify in the 400 freestyle,
Evans faced a tough field in the 800
freestyle preliminaries including
15-year-old teammate Brooke Ben
nett and 1992 silver medalist Hay
ley Lewis of Australia.
Evans needs a victory in Thurs
day's final to tie Bonnie Blair's
record of most Olympic golds by an
American woman with five.
For the surprising U.S. swim
mers, Tuesday night's medal haul
was the best yet — three gold
medals, one silver and one bronze.
That brought the four-day total to
17 — seven gold, eight silver and
two bronze.
No other country has more than

two golds, and Germany is second in
total swimming medals with eight.
"I think for underdogs we have
quite a big bite," Van Dyken said.
"People weren't expecting a lot
out of us and we were expecting a
lot out of ourselves. I just think that
our team has a lot of heart and we
pulled it together at the right time,"
she said.
Van Dyken fought off the strong
challenge of China's Liu Limin to
win the 100 fly in 59.13 seconds,
just one-hundredth of a second in
front of Liu.
Another Stanford graduate, Jeff
Rouse of Fredericksburg, Va., the
world's best backstroker, dominat
ed his 100-meter race to win his
first individual gold after years of
helping the United States in the re
lays.
Rouse won in 54.10, just 24-hun
dredths of a second off his world
record. Rodolfo Falcon, in 54.98,

and Neisser Bent, in 55.02, gave
Cuba its first two Olympic swim
ming medals ever. Tripp Schwenk
of Sarasota, Fla., faded to fifth.
The Americans capped the night
by winning the 400 freestyle relay,
which was the 100 th gold medal for
the U.S. men in Olympic swimming
history.
