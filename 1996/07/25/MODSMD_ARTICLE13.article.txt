They had waited a lifetime for
this.
On the afternoon of July 19,
the best and most select athletes
in the world left the pool, the field,
the gym and the weight room
early to assemble and prepare.
They put on the uniforms of their
countries — wool blazers, Pana

ma hats, brightly colored mu'u
mu'us, striped African cloth,
South Asian gauze, tinkling Indi
an silver jewelry — and got ready
to walk in front of the world. They
were bussed close to the area —
near, not to — and gathered in At
lanta Fulton County Stadium, ha
bitual home of the Braves and just
next door to the Olympic stadium
that was the focus of all of their
concentration that night. As the

$636-a-ticket crowd gathered, as
journalists and international visi
tors and star-spangled-banner
tie-wearing tourists fought the
thronging masses on the over
crowded MARTA trains, as the ex
citement and anticipation built to
an electric breaking point, the
athletes milled in the other stadi
um.
They listened to the entertain
ment provided, tried to mingle
and make small talk, but all
thoughts wore on the event next
door. They saw the fireworks,

heard the roars, the gasps, the
cheers. They waited. Finally, the
moment came. They lined up,
each behind their own flagbearer,
a fellow athlete and a blue-coated
volunteer holding the proud name
of their country. They waited
their turn to march, to walk up
the steep ramp and into the light
and the welcome havoc.

The American delegation, the
biggest and most anxious by far,
had to wait the longest. They lis
tened to the names of all 196 other
countries, many of which were not
nations at the last Olympics:
Slovenia, Ukraine, Kazahkstan,
Palestine, Lithuania. Heart-glad
dening entries like post-apartheid
South Africa, welcomed back to

the community of nations. North
and South Korea, China and Tai
wan: wary, but all present. Arabs
and Israelis, Serbs and Croats, In
dians, Pakistanis, Norwegians
and Nigerians, all together for one
night.
And finally, at the long end of
the night, after eight hours and
many lifetimes of waiting, it was

their turn. The Americans heard
the name of their country an
nounced, heard the earth-shaking
roar, felt the manifest adulation
and support of their countrymen;
and the mass of them, milling
hundreds of blue and red,
thronged up the ramp in rushing
waves, into the noise, into the
light.
