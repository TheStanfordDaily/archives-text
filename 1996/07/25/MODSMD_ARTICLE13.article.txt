They had waited a lifetime for
this.
On the afternoon of July 19,
the best and most select athletes
in the world left the pool, the field,
the gym and the weight room
early to assemble and prepare.
They put on the uniforms of their
countries — wool blazers, Pana

ma hats, brightly colored mu'u
mu'us, striped African cloth,
South Asian gauze, tinkling Indi
an silver jewelry — and got ready
to walk in front of the world. They
were bussed close to the area —
near, not to — and gathered in At
lanta Fulton County Stadium, ha
bitual home of the Braves and just
next door to the Olympic stadium
that was the focus of all of their
concentration that night. As the

$636-a-ticket crowd gathered, as
journalists and international visi
tors and star-spangled-banner
tie-wearing tourists fought the
thronging masses on the over
crowded MARTA trains, as the ex
citement and anticipation built to
an electric breaking point, the
athletes milled in the other stadi
um.
