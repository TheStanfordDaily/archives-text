# Nick's disappointment
## 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
Monday, July 22, 1996, was
not Nick Bravin's day. The
three-time NCAA and national
champion in men's foil, AII
- and 1994 Stanford
grad opened and closed his sec
ond Olympic chapter in exactly
the same way as he did his first:
with a loss.
In Barcelona in 1992, Bravin
was a 20-year-old Stanford
sophomore who ended up finish
ing 32nd out of a pool of 64. In
Atlanta, he would be four years
wiser, with more international
competition experience and the
homecourt advantage.
"The idea," said Christine
Collins, coordinator of the fencing
event, "is to advance a round with
each Olympics." He had taken a
year of leave from Columbia Law
School to pursue the dream:
These Olympics, this year, were
supposed to be different.
They weren't. Bravin, ranked
35th, faced Adam Krzesinski of
Poland in his first bout. He ap
peared both focused and relaxed.
Peter Cox, Olympic sabreman
and teammate of Bravin's, said,
"Nick's been here before. He
feels good about this." This was
in contrast to his noticeably jit
tery American teammates, who
were all eliminated in the first
round.
Bravin opened his bout (first
to 15 touches wins) by jumping

out to a quick 2-0 lead with flash
ing lunges that showcased his in
credible quickness. Krzesinski,
about half a head taller and
maybe 25 pounds heavier than
Bravin ("It's like David and Go
liath out there," murmured Cox)
seemed bewildered by the speed
of the attacks, and was slow to
respond. At one point Bravin,
using his hit-and-run strategy,
led 11-6.
But Krzesinski was not to be
an easy win. He fought back,
using flicks (whipping the blade
so that just the tip stings the op
ponent and scores a touch), pa
tience and some fancy footwork
of his own to even the score and
pull ahead, 13-11.
Throughout the bout, Bravin
would take deep breaths and
short walks down the strip; he
screamed after victorious points
and pumped his arms and talked
to himself after losing ones.
Stanford coach Zoran Tulum,
watching from the sidelines,
would yell advice: "Nick, use
your legs! Think!"
As the score climbed — 12-10,
12-11, 13-11 — Bravin made two
fast lunges that hit off-target — no
touch and no points. When the
score tied at 14-14, all the specta
tors crossed their fingers and held
their collective breath; then
Krzesinski made a parry-riposte
that set off the red light, sent him
into the next round and ended
Nick Bravin's second Olympic
dream.
