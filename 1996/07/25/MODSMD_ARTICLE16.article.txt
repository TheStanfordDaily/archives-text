# MEDICAL MARRIAGE: THE STANFORD/UCSF MERGER RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT "ACADEMIC MEDICINE"
## 
### Elisabeth Traugott 
UC-San Francisco, one of a
dwindling number of partnerless
hospitals on the shrinking dance
floor of academic medicine, took
the first step last week in formal
ly accepting Stanford's invitation
to tango. It remains to be seen,
however, whether the two highly
ranked institutions will be able to
synchronize their agendas in
order to outpace their competi
tors.
Despite protests from a vocal
minority of its members, the UC
Board of Regents last Friday ap
proved the administrative struc
ture of the nonprofit corporation
which would result from the
merger of the two schools. The 14-
4 vote is seen by many to be the
first tangible step in the forma
tion of a West Coast medical behe
moth, but there are still those
who Question whether a consoli

dation of resources is the appro
priate action to take in the face of
increased competition for refer
rals from health maintenance or
ganizations coupled with the high
cost of educating medical stu
dents.
The new board — whose 17
members have yet to be appointed
— will include three UC regents,
three Stanford trustees, the chan
cellor of the University of Califor
nia and the University President
Gerhard Casper. In addition, both
the CEO and the CFO of the new
corporation will be members, as
well as the dean of UCSF Medical
School, the dean of the Stanford
School of Medicine, one faculty
member from each school and
three outside directors. These last
three will not be affiliated in any
way with either medical school,
but "will be in the business of

health care exper
tise," according to
Terry Shepard, di
rector of Universi
ty communica
tions.

j Tougher times
According to
Shepard, the deci
sion to make the
board private was
necessitated by the
fact that "times are
getting tighter" in
the corridors and
classrooms of the
country's great
teaching hospitals.
The desired out
come of the merg
er, which has been
under discussion
since last Novem
ber, is threefold: to
j run the schools
r more efficiently, to
■ cut costs while at
t tracting a better
I market share by
• pooling resources
for high-expendi

ture items such as capital equip
ment and top administrator
salaries, and to recruit a broader
patient base comprised of those
who require very specialized,
high-end care.
While these goals seem driven
by an underlying motive to cut the
fat from hospital budgets, offi
cials at both institutions are quick
to point out that the financial
health of their schools is not in
question. But opponents of the
merger claim that what is being
passed off as an appeal for the im
provement of the quality of pa
tient care is a thinlv-disguised ini
tiative to promote "bottom-line"

buyer-oriented market.

considerat ions.
Spvros Andreopoulos, director
emeritus of communication for
Stanford Medical School, has spo
ken repeatedly against the plan,
which he finds to be "an extrava
gant response" to an inevitable
economic trend, and questions
whether significant profit mar
gins are realistically attainable in
academic medicine.
"It is increasingly clear that
mergers cannot be relied upon to
resolve the funding challenges of
medical schools. Their problem is
the surplus of physicians, over
specialization and public reluc
tance to pay for education and
medical innovation," Andreopou
los said in a future op-ed piece to
The Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion, parts of which were pub
lished in the San Francisco Exam
iner.
Andreopoulos, although he is
not formally involved in the nego
tiations, said, "It is unclear what
added value the mergers would
bring to the bargaining table"
with insurance companies.
Pleasing insurance companies
The common denominator at
UCSF and Stanford is the slippery
foothold they both have in what
has become an increasingly
buyer-oriented market. Wanda
Jones, the president of the New
Century Health Care Institute in
San Francisco, said there has
been a shift in power from the
providers of care who had the

upper hand in the economic reces
sion of the 1980s, "to the original
buyers of health care plans." Or
ganizations like Hewlett Packard
that represent a huge client base
for insurance companies are will
ing to shave their costs to attract
premiums.
Unless Congress is willing to
pass legislation that will force in
surance companies to absorb the
costs of training doctors, HMOs
and their counterparts are not
willing to foot the bill. Many
agreed that it is an investment
that has no immediate financial
benefit for their otherwise
healthy consumers.
But those who favor the merg
er claim that they are only follow
ing the trend in medicine which is
forcing hospitals to join the band
wagon or lose clout in a system
which is slowly whittling away at
the tradition of academic medi
cine.
It is a tradition with the long
term goal of turning out good doc
tors, with the added short-term
expense of training those doctors
in clinics that treat seriously ill
patients who have few resources.
Judy Frabotta, a Stanford
Medical Center spokeswoman,
said she is concerned about the
way that hospitals are increasing
ly beingjudged not by the quality
of care that they provide, but by
how much money can be saved.
"We need to find a way to save the
best institutions and not just col
lapse them into a common denom
inator," she said.
Recent figures show that 37
percent of Stanford's patients and
42 percent of those seen at UCSF
rely on some form of government
aid. In today's market, character
ized by looming government cut
backs in MediCal and Medicaid,
insurance companies have little
room left over to absorb the cost
of teaching medical students. In
this, the two schools are agreed.
Public or private?
The difference between UCSF
and Stanford lies in their respec
tive sources of revenue for their
operating budgets. Stanford is a
private hospital which has no
legal obligation to disclose its
transactions to the public. The
UCSF medical school is a public
institution supported in part by
taxpayers' money.
At their Friday meeting, most
UC regents concurred with the
position of the Stanford trustees
that a hospital with a public
board, accountable to the so
called "sunshine" laws which re
quire all board meetings to be
public and all board transactions
to be made into public records, is
not viable.
UC regent William Bagley, the
author of the 1970 Open Meetings
Act, a law that requires the board
meetings of all public institutions
to be open to the public, supports

the merger and the formation of a
private corporate board.
"I am in full accord with the
precept to this merger that these
'Freedom of Information' acts
should not apply to what in fact is

and will be a separate business en
terprise. Any governance struc
ture which does not avoid the ap
plication of these acts would not
work and would be counter-pro
ductive, in any business atmos
phere," he wrote in a memo to his

colleagues on the board of re
gents.
But there are those who object
in principle to a public institution
relinquishing its control over tax
payer resources to a private cor

poration. As UC Regent Frank
' lark commented, "I think the
L niversity of California is a pub
lic trust and I don't think we have
the authority to do this." Clark
voted ag .inst the governance
structure.

His concerns were echoed by
union officials who fear that em
ployees of UCSF hospitals, who
are unionized, will find their labor
contracts reneged. These con
tracts tend to include generous
health benefits and retirement
plans.
Karen MacLeod, president of
the UCSF University Profession
al and Technical Employees, rep
resents one of a coalition of
unions fighting the merger.
"We believe something has to
be done. We understand there is a
change in health care, but we do
not believe the way to survive at
UCSF is to give away assets to a
private corporation," she said.
The most pressing issue for
representatives of UCSF employ
ees, however, is job security.
Shepard pointed to an assurance
made by the regents that 95 per

cent of employees would keep
their jobs.
But Carl Bloice, a spokesper
son for the California Nurses As
sociation, is not optimistic. "We
have a vague pledge that on the
day the sale is made only 5 percent
will lose their jobs." What cannot
be predicted, according to Bloice,
is "what happens six months after
that."
Bloice said he is also disap
pointed by the way the merger sit
uation has been dealt with pub
licly. "The whole thing has been
shrouded in secrecy from day one,
and it still is," he claims. "It is a
matter for the people to decide, or
their representatives."
National trend
The move from rivalry to re
gionalization is not unique to the

Bay Area. Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston has merged
with Brigham and Women's Hos
pital, and the Medical College of
Pennsylvania has joined forces
with Hahnemann Medical School.
In addition, there are currently
plans underway to merge the Uni
versity of Minnesota Hospital
with the Fairview Hospital and
Health Care Services located in
Minneapolis, but the deal has
been stalled along the way be
cause of labor-related issues,
among other reasons.
It is still too soon to tell how
most of these alliances will fare,
but preliminary evidence from the
earliest one, the Massachusetts
General merger, has been mixed.
Andreopoulos said he believes
that after the first three years,
"charges at the hospitals remain
high, and there is little progress
in eliminating overlapping ser
vices."
Although officials from both
Stanford and UCSF medical cen
ters predict at least some profit at
the end of their fiscal calendars,
they said they are trying to be
proactive in the face of the certain
financial losses both schools
would face if they continue to
compete for similar market
shares.
"It makes sense that two simi
lar academic institutions should
share resources rather than com
pete with each other," said Carlos
Esquivel, a professor of surgery
and director of the liver trans
plant program at Stanford.
Esquivel, who said he views
"cost-containment" as the key
issue facing his institution, has
voiced a common concern among
administrators.
A strong argument has been
made by both Stanford and UCSF
that a merger would allow for
greater technological innovation
in research. But opponents say a
small percentage of what hospi
tals do is truly groundbreaking.
Organ transplants and open
heart surgeries, while they are
miraculous, are no longer un
heard of.
To be sure, if there are new
cures to be found and new tech
niques to be performed, they are
likely to be invented at either
Stanford or UCSF. Both are
world-class teaching hospitals
and their medical schools are con
sidered to be in the top 10 nation
wide, according to U.S. News and
World Report.
UCSF is the leading center for
AIDS research, which it conducts in
part at San Francisco General Hos
pital, a county-run facility. And
Stanford is known for its trans
plant program as well as for its re
search in the treatment of cancer.
What the regents decided on
Friday was that the competition is
so fierce, the mission of the teach
ing hospitals so critical, that hos
pital management must conceal
itself in closed-door sessions, if

only to stay afloat. As Bagley said,
"the governance structure must
be one which can operate in a
competitive environment, not in a
competitor's paradise."
The real winners?
"Initially, the patients will not
see a whole lot of difference. This
is an administrative change," said
Jones. She disputed claims that
patients may even be inconve
nienced by lengthy commutes to
whichever hospital houses the
specialist for their condition, cit-

ing the fact that Stanford's radius
of care already includes locations
as far away as Nevada.
But hospital employees, espe
cially those who do not directly
provide patient care, may find
themselves on tenuous footing
when they negotiate their new
contracts.
According to a recent editorial in
The New England Journal of Medi
cine, "With their huge salaries and
handsome perquisites, the biggest
winners are the corporate execu
tives of the huge (and still expand
ing) for-profit HMOs and hospital
systems. Other winners include
stockholders, lawyers who broker
consolidations, and health care
consultants."
According to Bagley, the UC re
gents will meet again in Septem
ber to consider the issue of "fair
ness." At that time, they will be
presented with an independent fi
nancial analysis which will out
line the predicted results of a
merger with a private hospital.
As Frabotta said, it is coming
down to the "survival of the
cheapest or survival of the best,
and we want to be the best." It
now remains for the administra
tors at UCSF and Stanford to fig
ure out how to be the best more
cheaply than before while con
vincing those affected that the
merger will be the best course of
action for them, and for the fu
ture of academic medicine.

Andreopoulos, although he is

bring to the bargaining table"
with insurance companies.
Pleasing insurance companies
The common denominator at
UCSF and Stanford is the slippery
foothold they both have in what
has become an increasingly
buyer-oriented market. Wanda
Jones, the president of the New
Century Health Care Institute in
San Francisco, said there has
been a shift in power from the
providers of care who had the

upper hand in the economic reces
sion of the 1980s, "to the original
buyers of health care plans." Or
ganizations like Hewlett Packard
that represent a huge client base
for insurance companies are will
ing to shave their costs to attract
premiums.
Unless Congress is willing to
pass legislation that will force in
surance companies to absorb the
costs of training doctors, HMOs
and their counterparts are not
willing to foot the bill. Many
agreed that it is an investment
that has no immediate financial
benefit for their otherwise
healthy consumers.
But those who favor the merg
er claim that they are only follow
ing the trend in medicine which is
forcing hospitals to join the band
wagon or lose clout in a system
which is slowly whittling away at
the tradition of academic medi
cine.
It is a tradition with the long
term goal of turning out good doc
tors, with the added short-term
expense of training those doctors
in clinics that treat seriously ill
patients who have few resources.
Judy Frabotta, a Stanford
Medical Center spokeswoman,
said she is concerned about the
way that hospitals are increasing
ly beingjudged not by the quality
of care that they provide, but by
how much money can be saved.
"We need to find a way to save the
best institutions and not just col
lapse them into a common denom
inator," she said.
Recent figures show that 37
percent of Stanford's patients and
42 percent of those seen at UCSF
rely on some form of government
aid. In today's market, character
ized by looming government cut
backs in MediCal and Medicaid,
insurance companies have little
room left over to absorb the cost
of teaching medical students. In
this, the two schools are agreed.
Public or private?
The difference between UCSF
and Stanford lies in their respec
tive sources of revenue for their
operating budgets. Stanford is a
private hospital which has no
legal obligation to disclose its
transactions to the public. The
UCSF medical school is a public
institution supported in part by
taxpayers' money.
At their Friday meeting, most
UC regents concurred with the
position of the Stanford trustees
that a hospital with a public
board, accountable to the so
called "sunshine" laws which re
quire all board meetings to be
public and all board transactions
to be made into public records, is
not viable.
UC regent William Bagley, the
author of the 1970 Open Meetings
Act, a law that requires the board
meetings of all public institutions
to be open to the public, supports

the merger and the formation of a
private corporate board.
"I am in full accord with the
precept to this merger that these
'Freedom of Information' acts
should not apply to what in fact is

and will be a separate business en
terprise. Any governance struc
ture which does not avoid the ap
plication of these acts would not
work and would be counter-pro
ductive, in any business atmos
phere," he wrote in a memo to his

colleagues on the board of re
gents.
But there are those who object
in principle to a public institution
relinquishing its control over tax
payer resources to a private cor

poration. As UC Regent Frank
' lark commented, "I think the
L niversity of California is a pub
lic trust and I don't think we have
the authority to do this." Clark
voted ag .inst the governance
structure.

His concerns were echoed by
union officials who fear that em
ployees of UCSF hospitals, who
are unionized, will find their labor
contracts reneged. These con
tracts tend to include generous
health benefits and retirement
plans.
Karen MacLeod, president of
the UCSF University Profession
al and Technical Employees, rep
resents one of a coalition of
unions fighting the merger.
"We believe something has to
be done. We understand there is a
change in health care, but we do
not believe the way to survive at
UCSF is to give away assets to a
private corporation," she said.
The most pressing issue for
representatives of UCSF employ
ees, however, is job security.
Shepard pointed to an assurance
made by the regents that 95 per

cent of employees would keep
their jobs.
But Carl Bloice, a spokesper
son for the California Nurses As
sociation, is not optimistic. "We
have a vague pledge that on the
day the sale is made only 5 percent
will lose their jobs." What cannot
be predicted, according to Bloice,
is "what happens six months after
that."
Bloice said he is also disap
pointed by the way the merger sit
uation has been dealt with pub
licly. "The whole thing has been
shrouded in secrecy from day one,
and it still is," he claims. "It is a
matter for the people to decide, or
their representatives."
National trend
The move from rivalry to re
gionalization is not unique to the

Bay Area. Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston has merged
with Brigham and Women's Hos
pital, and the Medical College of
Pennsylvania has joined forces
with Hahnemann Medical School.
In addition, there are currently
plans underway to merge the Uni
versity of Minnesota Hospital
with the Fairview Hospital and
Health Care Services located in
Minneapolis, but the deal has
been stalled along the way be
cause of labor-related issues,
among other reasons.
It is still too soon to tell how
most of these alliances will fare,
but preliminary evidence from the
earliest one, the Massachusetts
General merger, has been mixed.
Andreopoulos said he believes
that after the first three years,
"charges at the hospitals remain
high, and there is little progress
in eliminating overlapping ser
vices."
Although officials from both
Stanford and UCSF medical cen
ters predict at least some profit at
the end of their fiscal calendars,
they said they are trying to be
proactive in the face of the certain
financial losses both schools
would face if they continue to
compete for similar market
shares.
"It makes sense that two simi
lar academic institutions should
share resources rather than com
pete with each other," said Carlos
Esquivel, a professor of surgery
and director of the liver trans
plant program at Stanford.
Esquivel, who said he views
"cost-containment" as the key
issue facing his institution, has
voiced a common concern among
administrators.
A strong argument has been
made by both Stanford and UCSF
that a merger would allow for
greater technological innovation
in research. But opponents say a
small percentage of what hospi
tals do is truly groundbreaking.
Organ transplants and open
heart surgeries, while they are
miraculous, are no longer un
heard of.
To be sure, if there are new
cures to be found and new tech
niques to be performed, they are
likely to be invented at either
Stanford or UCSF. Both are
world-class teaching hospitals
and their medical schools are con
sidered to be in the top 10 nation
wide, according to U.S. News and
World Report.
UCSF is the leading center for
AIDS research, which it conducts in
part at San Francisco General Hos
pital, a county-run facility. And
Stanford is known for its trans
plant program as well as for its re
search in the treatment of cancer.
What the regents decided on
Friday was that the competition is
so fierce, the mission of the teach
ing hospitals so critical, that hos
pital management must conceal
itself in closed-door sessions, if

only to stay afloat. As Bagley said,
"the governance structure must
be one which can operate in a
competitive environment, not in a
competitor's paradise."
The real winners?
"Initially, the patients will not
see a whole lot of difference. This
is an administrative change," said
Jones. She disputed claims that
patients may even be inconve
nienced by lengthy commutes to
whichever hospital houses the
specialist for their condition, cit-

ing the fact that Stanford's radius
of care already includes locations
as far away as Nevada.
But hospital employees, espe
cially those who do not directly
provide patient care, may find
themselves on tenuous footing
when they negotiate their new
contracts.
According to a recent editorial in
The New England Journal of Medi
cine, "With their huge salaries and
handsome perquisites, the biggest
winners are the corporate execu
tives of the huge (and still expand
ing) for-profit HMOs and hospital
systems. Other winners include
stockholders, lawyers who broker
consolidations, and health care
consultants."
According to Bagley, the UC re
gents will meet again in Septem
ber to consider the issue of "fair
ness." At that time, they will be
presented with an independent fi
nancial analysis which will out
line the predicted results of a
merger with a private hospital.
As Frabotta said, it is coming
down to the "survival of the
cheapest or survival of the best,
and we want to be the best." It
now remains for the administra
tors at UCSF and Stanford to fig
ure out how to be the best more
cheaply than before while con
vincing those affected that the
merger will be the best course of
action for them, and for the fu
ture of academic medicine.

ter's liver transplant program, examines patient

hospitals, "the quality of care should not be jea
pordized, but it should be at a lower cost."

UC-San Francisco, one of a
dwindling number of partnerless
hospitals on the shrinking dance
floor of academic medicine, took
the first step last week in formal
ly accepting Stanford's invitation
to tango. It remains to be seen,
however, whether the two highly
ranked institutions will be able to
synchronize their agendas in
order to outpace their competi
tors.
Despite protests from a vocal
minority of its members, the UC
Board of Regents last Friday ap
proved the administrative struc
ture of the nonprofit corporation
which would result from the
merger of the two schools. The 14-
4 vote is seen by many to be the
first tangible step in the forma
tion of a West Coast medical behe
moth, but there are still those
who Question whether a consoli

dation of resources is the appro
priate action to take in the face of
increased competition for refer
rals from health maintenance or
ganizations coupled with the high
cost of educating medical stu
dents.
The new board — whose 17
members have yet to be appointed
— will include three UC regents,
three Stanford trustees, the chan
cellor of the University of Califor
nia and the University President
Gerhard Casper. In addition, both
the CEO and the CFO of the new
corporation will be members, as
well as the dean of UCSF Medical
School, the dean of the Stanford
School of Medicine, one faculty
member from each school and
three outside directors. These last
three will not be affiliated in any
way with either medical school,
but "will be in the business of

health care exper
tise," according to

medical innovation," Andreopou

iner.
Andreopoulos, although he is
not formally involved in the nego
tiations, said, "It is unclear what
added value the mergers would
bring to the bargaining table"
with insurance companies.
Pleasing insurance companies
The common denominator at
UCSF and Stanford is the slippery
foothold they both have in what
has become an increasingly
buyer-oriented market. Wanda
Jones, the president of the New
Century Health Care Institute in
San Francisco, said there has
been a shift in power from the
providers of care who had the

upper hand in the economic reces
sion of the 1980s, "to the original
buyers of health care plans." Or
ganizations like Hewlett Packard
that represent a huge client base
for insurance companies are will
ing to shave their costs to attract
premiums.
Unless Congress is willing to
pass legislation that will force in
surance companies to absorb the
costs of training doctors, HMOs
and their counterparts are not
willing to foot the bill. Many
agreed that it is an investment
that has no immediate financial
benefit for their otherwise
healthy consumers.
But those who favor the merg
er claim that they are only follow
ing the trend in medicine which is
forcing hospitals to join the band
wagon or lose clout in a system
which is slowly whittling away at
the tradition of academic medi
cine.
It is a tradition with the long
term goal of turning out good doc
tors, with the added short-term
expense of training those doctors
in clinics that treat seriously ill
patients who have few resources.
Judy Frabotta, a Stanford
Medical Center spokeswoman,
said she is concerned about the
way that hospitals are increasing
ly beingjudged not by the quality
of care that they provide, but by
how much money can be saved.
"We need to find a way to save the
best institutions and not just col
lapse them into a common denom
inator," she said.
Recent figures show that 37
percent of Stanford's patients and
42 percent of those seen at UCSF
rely on some form of government
aid. In today's market, character
ized by looming government cut
backs in MediCal and Medicaid,
insurance companies have little
room left over to absorb the cost
of teaching medical students. In
this, the two schools are agreed.
Public or private?
The difference between UCSF
and Stanford lies in their respec
tive sources of revenue for their
operating budgets. Stanford is a
private hospital which has no
legal obligation to disclose its
transactions to the public. The
UCSF medical school is a public
institution supported in part by
taxpayers' money.
At their Friday meeting, most
UC regents concurred with the
position of the Stanford trustees
that a hospital with a public
board, accountable to the so
called "sunshine" laws which re
quire all board meetings to be
public and all board transactions
to be made into public records, is
not viable.
UC regent William Bagley, the
author of the 1970 Open Meetings
Act, a law that requires the board
meetings of all public institutions
to be open to the public, supports

the merger and the formation of a
private corporate board.
"I am in full accord with the
precept to this merger that these
'Freedom of Information' acts
should not apply to what in fact is

and will be a separate business en
terprise. Any governance struc
ture which does not avoid the ap
plication of these acts would not
work and would be counter-pro
ductive, in any business atmos
phere," he wrote in a memo to his

colleagues on the board of re
gents.
But there are those who object
in principle to a public institution
relinquishing its control over tax
payer resources to a private cor

poration. As UC Regent Frank
' lark commented, "I think the
L niversity of California is a pub
lic trust and I don't think we have
the authority to do this." Clark
voted ag .inst the governance
structure.

His concerns were echoed by
union officials who fear that em
ployees of UCSF hospitals, who
are unionized, will find their labor
contracts reneged. These con
tracts tend to include generous
health benefits and retirement
plans.
Karen MacLeod, president of
the UCSF University Profession
al and Technical Employees, rep
resents one of a coalition of
unions fighting the merger.
"We believe something has to
be done. We understand there is a
change in health care, but we do
not believe the way to survive at
UCSF is to give away assets to a
private corporation," she said.
The most pressing issue for
representatives of UCSF employ
ees, however, is job security.
Shepard pointed to an assurance
made by the regents that 95 per

cent of employees would keep
their jobs.
But Carl Bloice, a spokesper
son for the California Nurses As
sociation, is not optimistic. "We
have a vague pledge that on the
day the sale is made only 5 percent
will lose their jobs." What cannot
be predicted, according to Bloice,
is "what happens six months after
that."
Bloice said he is also disap
pointed by the way the merger sit
uation has been dealt with pub
licly. "The whole thing has been
shrouded in secrecy from day one,
and it still is," he claims. "It is a
matter for the people to decide, or
their representatives."
National trend
The move from rivalry to re
gionalization is not unique to the

Bay Area. Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston has merged
with Brigham and Women's Hos
pital, and the Medical College of
Pennsylvania has joined forces
with Hahnemann Medical School.
In addition, there are currently
plans underway to merge the Uni
versity of Minnesota Hospital
with the Fairview Hospital and
Health Care Services located in
Minneapolis, but the deal has
been stalled along the way be
cause of labor-related issues,
among other reasons.
It is still too soon to tell how
most of these alliances will fare,
but preliminary evidence from the
earliest one, the Massachusetts
General merger, has been mixed.
Andreopoulos said he believes
that after the first three years,
"charges at the hospitals remain
high, and there is little progress
in eliminating overlapping ser
vices."
Although officials from both
Stanford and UCSF medical cen
ters predict at least some profit at
the end of their fiscal calendars,
they said they are trying to be
proactive in the face of the certain
financial losses both schools
would face if they continue to
compete for similar market
shares.
"It makes sense that two simi
lar academic institutions should
share resources rather than com
pete with each other," said Carlos
Esquivel, a professor of surgery
and director of the liver trans
plant program at Stanford.
Esquivel, who said he views
"cost-containment" as the key
issue facing his institution, has
voiced a common concern among
administrators.
A strong argument has been
made by both Stanford and UCSF
that a merger would allow for
greater technological innovation
in research. But opponents say a
small percentage of what hospi
tals do is truly groundbreaking.
Organ transplants and open
heart surgeries, while they are
miraculous, are no longer un
heard of.
To be sure, if there are new
cures to be found and new tech
niques to be performed, they are
likely to be invented at either
Stanford or UCSF. Both are
world-class teaching hospitals
and their medical schools are con
sidered to be in the top 10 nation
wide, according to U.S. News and
World Report.
UCSF is the leading center for
AIDS research, which it conducts in
part at San Francisco General Hos
pital, a county-run facility. And
Stanford is known for its trans
plant program as well as for its re
search in the treatment of cancer.
What the regents decided on
Friday was that the competition is
so fierce, the mission of the teach
ing hospitals so critical, that hos
pital management must conceal
itself in closed-door sessions, if

only to stay afloat. As Bagley said,
"the governance structure must
be one which can operate in a
competitive environment, not in a
competitor's paradise."
The real winners?
"Initially, the patients will not
see a whole lot of difference. This
is an administrative change," said
Jones. She disputed claims that
patients may even be inconve
nienced by lengthy commutes to
whichever hospital houses the
specialist for their condition, cit-

ing the fact that Stanford's radius
of care already includes locations
as far away as Nevada.
But hospital employees, espe
cially those who do not directly
provide patient care, may find
themselves on tenuous footing
when they negotiate their new
contracts.
According to a recent editorial in
The New England Journal of Medi
cine, "With their huge salaries and
handsome perquisites, the biggest
winners are the corporate execu
tives of the huge (and still expand
ing) for-profit HMOs and hospital
systems. Other winners include
stockholders, lawyers who broker
consolidations, and health care
consultants."
According to Bagley, the UC re
gents will meet again in Septem
ber to consider the issue of "fair
ness." At that time, they will be
presented with an independent fi
nancial analysis which will out
line the predicted results of a
merger with a private hospital.
As Frabotta said, it is coming
down to the "survival of the
cheapest or survival of the best,
and we want to be the best." It
now remains for the administra
tors at UCSF and Stanford to fig
ure out how to be the best more
cheaply than before while con
vincing those affected that the
merger will be the best course of
action for them, and for the fu
ture of academic medicine.
