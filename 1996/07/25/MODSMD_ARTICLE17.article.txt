## "Body Language" speaks at Stanford's Art Gallery 
### Jen Graves Editorial staff 
Starting this week, the Stan
ford University Art Gallery is
full of bodies.
The members of this tiny one
room community include a man
gled metal face created by Melvin
Eugene Edwards, Jr. in 1993 en
titled "For Richard Wright" and
the stone image of an ancient
Egyptian woman dated 2480
B.C. The exhibition "Body
Language: The Human Form in
Art" will remain in the gallery
until next April, when these and
other pieces will find a final rest
ing place at the renovated Stan
ford Museum, opening in 1998.
While the museum staff
guides the museum proper out of
its long hibernation, this exhibi
tion serves as a display for what
is yet to come.
"The show has something to
represent all the different areas
of the University's collection,"
said Patience Young, the muse
um's curator of education.
Although museum publicity is
the main goal of the gallery exhi
bition, the show is much more in
teresting than just that. While
the "human body was obvious,"
according to Young, as a common
thread to link the greatest num
ber of Stanford's pieces together,
the interpretation of that body is
where things get complicated.
The gallery serves as a
menagerie for the gathering of
these diverse objects. Just as the
contents of a menagerie reflect
the character of its owner, so the
human race is the proud owner
of these telling pieces.
Upon entrance to the gallery,
the spectator encounters a life
size man leaning his hairy hand
against the wall. A walk around

to the front of him brings the
chilling realization that he is one
of t he sculptures. "Slab Man," or
"David," born in 1976, is easy to
miss; he is easy to mistake for an
other spectator.
Duane Hanson, "David's" cre
ator, writes the following: "Peo
ple enjoy seeing a reflection of
their society. The human form is
so close to all of us and we don't
really get a chance to analyze it
. . . because of taboos and staring
at people."
While the viewer can always
stare at a piece of art, some of
these pieces stare back. Rodin's
1903 wall sculpture "The Tem
pest" glares out at the gallery,
her face and neck stretching
away from the wall in a pose rem
iniscent of desperate escape.
"Self-Portrait with Small
Statue," from 1911, paints
Henry Varnum Poor's looming
Nordic face in relation to a tiny
gesturing figurine. Poor's face is
threateningly large; he appears
the way a father would to a child
about to be reprimanded.
Adjacent to Poor's piece is the
1870 painting by Vicente Villasi
neor entitled "Portrait of a Mex
ican Girl." The subject looks
frightened and grimaces in
Poor's direction as if he has hurt
her. These two figures are from
the same basic time period, but
they have immense cultural dif
ferences. Their placement in the
gallery seems to spotlight their
respective gender and cultural
perspectives, bringing timeless
disputes to the fore.
The more symbolic represen
tations of the human body do not
stare mimetically into the gallery
but stand as uncanny mirrors for
each viewer to contend with. In
an exhibition of the "human
body," one can hardly help but

consider one's own body and
its expressions.
Richard Stankiewicz's
"Urchin" stands almost in
the center of the gallery, a
steel and "found metal" con
struction that does not ap
pear as a "human body" in the
traditional sense, but be
comes one when we recognize
our similarities to it. The de
jected piece of brown rusted
metal is close to the actual
size of a man's chest, with
strange protrusions and
holes.
If one were to stand behind
"Urchin" and face the way it
does, straight ahead is a white
marble statue in a glass case
entitled "Ideal Head," made
anonymously in the United
States in 1916. The smooth
perfection of this untouch
able head sits in contrast to
"Urchin." If the missing head
of "Urchin" were to be re
placed with this piece, the re
sult would be a truly strange
mix, a cross-historical human
body whose parts would com
pliment each other by sheer
contrast.
The exhibition as a whole
is like this new "Urchin." And
while the pieces converse
silently with each other, they
implicitly involve the human
viewer. Although each piece
could stand on its own, this
particular configuration of
works produces a fascinating
effect.
The number of living peo
ple visiting the gallery can be
added to the number of other
"people" here; one never feels
alone. As the gallery atten
dant remarked about
"David": "I have to live with
him for nine months!"
