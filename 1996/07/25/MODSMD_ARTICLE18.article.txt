Stud: Architectures of Mas
culinity, Edited by Joel
Sanders (1996)
Princeton Architectural Press

The exploration of gender para
digms has, until recently, found its
main focus in the deconstruction
of a patriarchy that limits and ex
cludes women. With the work of
Michel Foucault and other cultur
al theorists, the necessary corol
lary to the investigation into femi
ninity is beginning to be realized:
the assessment and deconstruc
tion of masculinity.
"Stud: Architectures of Mas
culinity" takes a fascinating look
into the daily spaces of our lives
with respect to the construction of
a "normative heterosexual mas
culinity": the bathroom, the gym,
the bachelor apartment, the aver
age suburban American home.
Not only is "Stud" a stimulat
ing read, it is eye candy for the art

scholar. Edited by architect Joel
Sanders, contemporary cultural
theorists such as Diana Fuss,
George Chauncey and Lee Edel
man contribute essays, while the
work of such visual artists as
Robert Gober, Vito Acconci and
Andrea Zittel is exhibited in excel
lent glossy reproductions through
out this 311-page book.
A basic premise of "Stud" is
that overtly innocuous spaces we
interact in and with every day are
packed with cultural and histori
cal information. Sanders says,
"Ordinary conventions that we
take to be natural, objective, in
evitable and transparent are actu
ally cultural mythology."
Perhaps the most powerful
myth of all, according to the schol
arship of Sanders and others, is
the myth of "nature." The essen
tialist theory of gender construc
tion claims that men and women
each have a distinct role deter
mined by natural, unalterable
qualities. Cross-cultural defini
tions of "nature," however, are
quite variant.

Likewise, gender roles are not
the same across cultures and time
periods, and the structures and
spaces built around and by a cul
ture reflect it. As Chauncey writes,
"Space has no natural character...
no intrinsic status as public or pri
vate. As Michel de Certeau has ar
gued, it is always invested with
meaning by its users as well as its
creators..."
This collection of essays investi
gates such topics as Rock Hudson's
character Brad Allen in the 1959
film "Pillow Talk," Playboy's pent
house apartment, the construction
of Sigmund Freud's office and
study, the conflicted publicity of
the men's urinal and queer appro
priation of public urban space.
While the topics seem broad,
the theoretical underbelly of the
book is well-argued and coherent.
The book successfully exposes ar
chitecture as a mainstay of cul
ture with, as Sanders suggests,
"ostensibly innocent conventions
which, really unseen, actively
and sometimes coercively shape
social ideology."
