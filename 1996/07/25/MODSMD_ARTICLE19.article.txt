## GOOD EATS 
### 
The brightest new spot on
Emerson is Beppo, one of Palo
Alto's most decorated eateries.
After entering through Beppo's
quiet door, we were taken into the
colorful innards of the place. The
entire restaurant is decked out in
multi-colored Christmas lights,
and there are enough Sophia
Ix>ren photographs to satisfy the
most neurotic of obsessions.
Beppo is a fountain of kitsch. And
the men's room ...
Moving on. We were seated up
stairs and our waitress told us that
Beppo is a Southern Italian fami
ly-style restaurant, which means
that each dish serves three to five
people — definitely a refreshing
change from American diningcon
ventions.
Beppo has the basics down pat:
large soda sizes with refills and ex
cellent bread (a salty, buttery fo
caccia).
First we ordered the fried cala
mari, garlic bread and bruschetta.
The calamari is exceptionally
fresh and flavorful. The garlic
bread fails to live up to its spicy
name. Topped with plentiful
tomatoes, onions and various
other spices and oils, the bruschet

ta was the best third of this three
part appetizer sampling.
The caesar salad is fresh (no
limp lettuce!), and the mixture of
cheeses, oils and tasty croutons
made it a pleasure to eat.
The pepperoni and margherita
pizzas arrived, and to my dismay, I

had not read the fine print: Pep
peroni pizza includes pepperonci
ni, which mixes the strong spices
of the pepper and the pepperoni.
The margherita pizza, on the
other hand, is light and interest
ing, with large tomatoes, fresh
mozzarella and basil. The pizza

crust is very thin and crispy.
The best main course was the
spaghetti with meatballs. A sur
prisingly sweet and salty twist on
the traditional dish, it is absolute
ly excellent. The massive meat
balls are spicy, not dull, and the
noodles are perfectly cooked.
The runner-up was the chicken
cacciatore over mashed potatoes.
The chicken breasts have lots of
tender meat, with a marvelous
zingy peppered sauce, and the
mashed potatoes are thick with
mushrooms, tomatoes and the
perfect amount of garlic.
The chicken parmigiana could
have been less bready. The riga
toni with white beans, sausage,
onions, broccoli and tomatoes
looked promising, but the noodles
are molto al dente.
The desserts are smaller. The
raspberry cheesecake is light yet
creamy, the perfect synergy of
cake and cheese. The bread pud
ding is steaming and huge with a
chocolate sauce running through
it. The rum in the tiramisu over

shadows the mocha. The chocolate
cannoli is nothing special, without
that super-sweetness that makes
cannoli sinful.
Overall, I recommend Beppo.
The vibrant atmosphere can be
overwhelming at times and the
music is too loud, but most of the
food is far above average. A friend
put it well when he said this:
"Beppo is to Italian food what
Miyake's is to Japanese food."
