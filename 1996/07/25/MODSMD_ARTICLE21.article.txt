# COURAGE UNDER FIRE
## 
### 
Could you make the call under
pressure? Could you make the
right decision in a life-or-death sit
uation? Could you hold the pieces
together if everything were
threatening to crumble? Can you
have courage . . . even if you're
under fire?
Edward Zwick directs the new
military-based "Courage Under
Fire," which asks these questions
and gives interesting treatment to
classic issues of honor, duty, truth
and guilt.
"Courage" takes place during
the U.S. military involvement in
the Iraqi-Kuwaiti struggle and
Operation Desert Storm. From

the beginning, two stories are
woven together based on the two
main characters, played by Denzel
Washington and Meg Ryan.
Washington is an army colonel
who fires an accidental shot at an
other U.S. vehicle, commonly
known as a "friendly fire." Believ
ing the tank to be property of the
enemy, he gives the order, and a
U.S. tank led by one of his friends
is destroyed.
In a chance for him to redeem
himself, he is given a report to
complete. Because of its popular
nature, importance and expected
ease of completion, it will help him
get back into the Army's good
graces. The report is more compli
cated than it seems, and this is
where Ryan enters the picture.
Congress wants to give a medal
of honor to a certain helicopter
pilot who saved the lives of fellow
soldiers and countrymen in the
line of duty. The female pilot
(Ryan), who died while saving
lives, is to receive the award
posthumously. She will be the first
woman to receive such an award.
Washington must investigate the
events surrounding her death be
fore the award can be given.
What seems like a routine in
vestigation turns out to be a jour
ney into subjectivity. Here we see
the devastating effects of war, and
we witness what it actually means
to have courage under fire — no
easy feat.
Through "Citizen Kane"-like
flashback narratives, we see three
conflicting accounts of the event.
Like Washington, we must search
for the truth. As the plot twists
and turns, it becomes difficult to
remember just what the truth is.
In "Courage Under Fire," the
action is captivating, and the com
pelling story is enhanced by good
acting. See this movie, and pay at
tention.
