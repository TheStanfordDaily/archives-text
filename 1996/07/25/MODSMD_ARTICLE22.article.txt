## Undisputed Attitude

BEWARE! Do not drive under
the influence of Slayer's newest
album, "Undisputed Attitude," or
you will drive fast and you will be
come addicted to punk rock.
Slayer, the masters of death
metal, have done it again by
putting forth an album filled with
pulverizing riffs, bone-crushing
beats and violent vocals. But
rather than putting together a col
lection of classic metal jams, Slay
er's new album spews froth with
what the world needs the most —
punk rock covers done with atti
tude.
Slayer steers clear of plunging
into the Green Day-infested punk
waters of today by doing covers of
Minor Threat, Suicidal Tenden
cies, Verbal Abuse and TSOL —
the major players of the early '80s
punk movement.
Slayer does justice to the origi
nal punk masters, keeping the fe
rocity and in-your-face attitude.
Even though most of the covers
are tastefully done in abbreviated
but potent one-to-two minute
bursts, Slayer's homogenized
sound makes it difficult to figure
out where one song ends and the
next begins.
Nevertheless, Slayer also man
ages to pack in three new tracks.
The gem of the three is "Gemini,"
which is characterized by vocalist
Tom Araya's sweet invocations of
death and balanced by intriguing,
tempo-shifting passages. "Gemi
ni" is almost a reflection of Metal
lica's tributes to death and the
technical grace found in that
band's second album, "Ride the
Lightning."
Never mind the warning of the

September/October 1995 issue of
Catholic Parent, which condemns
the band. Real punk rock and good
metal music is hard to come by.
Slayer's new album is worth get
ting — at any cost.
