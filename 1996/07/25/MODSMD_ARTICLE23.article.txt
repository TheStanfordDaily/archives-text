# BRUJERIA
## Raza Odiada 
### 
Death metal: What can one say
about it? Often brutal, sometimes
offensive, frequently dismissed.
One thing can be said for sure: If
death metal has redeeming value,
it lies in its sense of humor and its
ability to laugh at itself.
Now imagine a Mexican death
metal group consisting of seven
self-proclaimed warlocks with
communist tendencies writing
songs about racism, the destruc
tive power of drugs, the evils of
capitalism and human sacrifice.
This is Brujeria (Spanish for
"witchery"), and if they don't have
the humor issue down pat, no one
does.
"Raza Odiada" ("Hated Race")
begins promisingly, with the song
"Pito Wilson," a vicious criticism
of California's governor (in which
Brujeria replaces Wilson's first
name with a common obscenity).
Jello Biafra has a cameo appear
ance in the intro as Pete Wilson,
giving an anti-immigrant speech
just before being shot by a group of
angry Mexicans.
Lyrics like "Pito Wilson — the
king of racists" and "Pito Wilson is
full of hate/He is trying to fuck our
race" reassure the listener that
while Brujeria may be blunt, they
don't cringe from political contro
versy. The humor becomes evi
dent when one contrasts this song
with a satiric track like "Sesos Hu

manos (Sacrificio IV)," in which
lead growler Juan Brujo rumbles,
"You are weak mortals — I am a
powerful warlock/Lucifer the king
sent me to eat/a soup of human
bones."
The opposition between serious
social commentary and ridiculous
devil worship exists throughout
the album. Punctuating nearly
every phrase with profanity, Bru
jeria criticizes cocaine use ("Colas
de Rata"), lauds Emilio Zapata
and the Chiapas uprising ("Rev
olucion") and praises Satan
("Padre Nuestro"). This makes for
an interesting album. One is alter
nately amused by Brujeria's de
monic posturing and impressed by
the strength of their commitment
to communism and nationalism.
To be frank, the music itself
sucks. While they know the formu
la for death metal (harsh guitar
lines plus rumbling double bass
pedal mixed with unintelligible vo
cals), they don't pull it off very
well. Juan Brujo's lyrics often
seem randomly interjected, not
matching the rhythm of guitar or
bass, and the formulaic drummer
appears to be in a world of his own.
Musical incompetence is just what
one would expect from Brujeria.
In the end, it is their sense of
humor which saves them, making
"Raza Odiada" a marvelously
abrasive and truly funny album.
