# Aquarius: Music of the Zodiac
## 
### 
With astrology gaining converts
all over the world, EMI is riding
right on the waves with a recently
launched campaign to market a set
of 12 CD's titled "Music of the Zodi
ac." This series aims to illustrate, by
way of classical music, the charac
teristics of each zodiac sign. Digging
from its vast vault of old and often
out-of-print recordings, EMI recy
cles the orchestral recordings from
the '60s and '70s and scatters them
over a dozen CD's.

Despite their commercial gim
micks and fancy packaging, the
recordings prove to be a mixed bag.
"Aquarius," which contains music
from Enescu's "Romanian Rhap
sody No. 1" to Hoist's "The Planet,"
is generally played lethargically and
conservatively, having no punch
whatsoever. The serene and beauti
ful Adagietto movement from
Mahler's "Fifth Symphony" sags
too much and sounds more like a
dirge. Likewise, the "Uranus"
movement of "The Planets" is slug
gish, lacking the sense of mysticism
that usually permeates the piece.
The rest of the CD runs much in the
same vein. Perhaps the only re
deeming pieces are Andre Previn's
Enescu and Sir Barbirolli's
Tchaikovsky, where traces of verve
and bounciness can still be heard.
On the brighter side, the featured
selections avoid hackneyed war
horses and often delight audiences
with movements from little-known
orchestral repertoire.
Clearly, the "Zodiac" series is for
either novice classical music listen
ers or people who aire more about
the glamour and the intrigues of the
zodiac than fine music. Coupled
with posh design and a low price,
these CD's could well be sales boost
ers, but a parallel musical success is
more dubious.
