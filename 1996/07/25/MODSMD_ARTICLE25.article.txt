KMFDM. What does it mean?
Kill Mother Fuckin' Depeche
Mode, perhaps? If it does, then
this industrial band might as well
rename their band KMFNIN, be
cause they're poised to take over
Nine Inch Nails' title as the num
ber one industrial band in the
world.
Unlike NIN, KMFDM is not a
one-man band. True, frontman
Sascha Konietzko is the master
mind behind the new album, but
he has plenty of help from a cast of
talented characters. Chris Connel
ly, Bill Rieflin (Ministry), and F.M.

Einheit (Einsturzende Neubaut
en) guest star in this effort, and an
impressive seven vocalists share
the crooning chores.
The result? A work which sur
passes any of Trent Reznor's
worn-out, nihilistic-happy al
bums. "Inane" is a wonderfully
silly effort driven by machine gun
beats. It is an engaging reflection
of what KMFDM stands for —
what they believe in and what they
preach.
Meanwhile, "Dogma" is a no
frills social commentary narrated
by a rigid Nicole Blackman and
backed by a frigid musical waste
land, compliments of Konietzko.
"Power" is a wonderful piece,
embodying the thrills of Magic
Mountain and the soft edges of
Disneyland. Konietzko's gritty,
distorted vocals rally with Cheryl
Wilson's beautiful chorus, creat
ing an exciting, spontaneous vol
ley of engaging sounds.
Of course, no CD would be com
plete without a bonus hidden
track. Hut rather than spoil all the
fun, you'll have to trust me and
know that the hidden track and
the album in general are somc
thingyou wouldn't want to miss.
