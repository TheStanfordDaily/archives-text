# Concert Review: Dishwalla has a lethal combination of looks and smarts
## 
### 
Looks matter. And the Santa
Barbara-spawned Dishwalla has
got them. Showing enough charis
ma and raw energy to charm a
grandmother, Dishwalla gave a
stunning performance last Thurs
day at the Fillmore, opening for
the Goo Goo Dolls.
On tour to promote their debut
album. "Pet Your Friends," Dish
walla members J.R. Richards (vo
cals, keyboard), Scot Alexander
(bass), Rodney Browning (guitars)
and George Pendergast (drums)
are also hard-working and intelli
gent. This is illustrated by their in
sightful, concerned lyrics and
seemingly political approach to the
album.
Example? In "Pretty Babie. " a
ditty about exploitation of chil
dren. Richards sings, "Everything
about the world is sex. . . . It's a
message of popular culture, telling
all our children how to do it right."
However, Pendergast explains
right away that Dishwalla is not
trying to be political; they are sim
ply questioning the influences
around us.
"These are things that every
one should think about, whatever
their beliefs may be." This attitude
is also evident in Dishwalla's hit
single, "Counting Blue Cars," in
which Richards writes, "Tell me
all your thoughts on God. ... I'd
really like to meet her." The lyrics
are intended to question authority
and the legitimacy of "facts" that
adults tell children.

Richards has explained, "It
must be so confusing to children to
always refer to God as a male Cau
casian. I figured, why not refer to
God as a woman. We're such a
male-driven society, but being a
man doesn't mean having to op
press women or immerse yourself
in everything that's masculine."
Good point.
In addition to their good looks
and smarts, Dishwalla distin
guishes itself with a unique musi

cal style. This is the result of the
band members' diverse musical
backgrounds. In his teens,
Richards was heavily into New
Wave music. Pendergast was a
metalhead, Browning was a loyal
fan of Duran Duran and Alexander
was into old school funk. But for
general purposes, Dishwalla can
be categorized as alternative rock.
However, it has a distinctive
sound that is grounded into its
gritty guitar riffs that are just

coursing with electricity. This is
not to say that the whole album is
one rock-infused zany ride. The
mellower songs are mesmerizing
in their latent intensity, such as
"Haze," where the debilitating ef
fects of alcoholism are revealed.
Dishwalla was born three years
ago in the beach town that bred
Toad the Wet Sprocket and Ugly
Kid Joe. Richards met Pendergast
in a music store when they were in
their teens. Browning, who has

been using Richards' home as a
recording studio, came into the
fold next, with Alexander, who had
been playing with Pendergast in
another band, completing the
quartet.
Though the band is still in its
toddler stage, Dishwalla's growth
has been spectacular. Shortly after
being signed by A&M Records,
Dishwalla was included in the "If I
Were A Carpenter" album. After
seeing a story on the making of a
Carpenters tribute record, Dishwal
la quickly recorded their version of
"Close To You" and sent it off to
producer Matt Wallace (Paul West
erberg, The Replacements).
No luck. The Cranberries had al
ready recorded their version of the
same song. But Wallace was so im
pressed with Dishwalla that he
slowed production of the album to
include Dishwalla's rendition of
"It's Going To Take Some Time."
With this project under their belts,
the quartet began work on "Pet
Your Friends."
Taking their name from the In
dian word for a pack of entrepre
neurial nomads who warp the lives
of native villagers by introducing
them to satellite dishes and pirat
ed cable, Dishwalla shows itself to
be both politically concerned,
physically appealing and musically
talented. With these characteris
tics, Dishwalla can go no where
but up, up, up.
