## Column David Wolitz A 						monumental debate 
### 
For almost half a year, a stat
ue has remained a light
ning rod of controversy in
San Francisco. Known as the Pio
neer Monument, the massive
hunk of granite and bronze
quickly polarized the city when it
was moved to a prominent spot in
front of City Hall and the New
Main Library.
Cast 100 years ago to com
memorate the pioneers and
founders of California, the monu
ment has ignited a firestorm of
protest and counter-protest. As a
collection of scenes and personal
ities from the state's post-
Columbian history, the statue
has little to offer aesthetically,
but this debate has little to do
with artistic merit. What has peo
ple all roiled up is the northeast
ern corner of the monument,
which depicts a Spanish friar
pointing one hand down to a
supine Indian and one hand up to
heaven while a vaquero raises his
arms in triumph nearby.
Everybody agrees that the
statue is supposed to represent
the conversion of the Native
American population by early
Catholic missionaries and the
conquest of the land by the Span
ish. People disagree passionately,
however, about how that event
ought to be remembered today.
Many Native Americans see the
statue as appallingly offensive,
arguing, in the words of one ac
tivist, that it symbolizes "the hu
miliation, degradation, genocide
and sorrow inflicted upon this
country's indigenous people by a
foreign invader, through reli
gious persecution and ethnic
prejudice." Hoping to mitigate
such complaints, the city's arts
commission decided to add a
plaque with the following inscrip
tion: "With their efforts over in
1834, the missionaries left be
hind about 56,000 converts —
and 150,000 dead."
The archbishop of the Catholic
diocese of San Francisco immedi
ately dashed off a letter to Mayor
Brown protesting the inscription
and its implication that the mis
sionaries intended to kill hun
dreds of thousands of people.
After debating various proposals,
the arts commission decided to
change the plaque to read, "As a
result of colonial occupation, half
of the Native American popula
tion perished during this time."
That pleased the Church, but the
new wording failed to satisfy the
Spanish general-consul, who has
come forward with objections
against the phrase "colonial occu
pation." The result: an on-going
international controversy and an
empty plaque.
It is truly astonishing that

there is even a debate about this
issue in 1996. Why is it so diffi
cult for Americans to recognize
that our country was "won" by
the expulsion, slaughter and con
quest of the indigenous inhabi
tants? And why does the Catholic
Church still pretend that its mis
sionaries brought enlightenment
and eternal life instead of en
slavement and desecration?
Why? Because of something
called legitimacy. Both the Unit
ed States government and the
Catholic Church, in their differ
ent ways, remain powerful insti
tutions that crave legitimacy
from their own constituencies
and from outside sources, and
one sure path toward illegitimacy
is a history of genocidal slaugh
ter. To admit that the original oc
cupants of this land were forcibly
converted, expelled and other
wise robbed of their land and her
itage is to give up the myth of the
bright New World; it is to accept
that we live today on the blood of
the Native Americans, and it is to
accept that America was borne of
original sin. We don't want to be
lieve that about ourselves, and we
certainly don't want others to see
us that way.
Likewise, today's Catholic
Church, heavily Latino in San
Francisco, stands to lose a good
deal of community support if the
truth about its early missionary
activity is widely exposed. Hear
ing that California's coastal Indi
ans were used as slave labor in
the Catholic missions between
1770 and 1800 is unlikely to lead
to a wave of new conversions. Nor
does it increase confidence in the
moral rectitude of the clergy.
Simply put, both the United
States and the Catholic Church
are naturally slow to recognize
the injustices perpetrated in their
names because they do not want
to bear the burden of history. And
while non-Catholics can do very
little to affect the Church's posi
tion, every American citizen can
make sure that attempts to white
wash our history are thwarted.
It is thus imperative that the
Pioneer Monument controversy
not be allowed to end with some
compromise plaque. The sculp
ture's celebration of Indian de
feat makes it unfit as a civic mon
ument. It is a period piece and
• lght to be housed in a history
museum where its message can
be explained by more than a one
line inscription. Perhaps when
the statue was first erected,
Americans saw themselves as the
rightful conquerors of the land
and the Indians as defeated hea
then, but surely this is not the at
titude we want to impart to our
children.
