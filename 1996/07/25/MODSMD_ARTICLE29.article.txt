Religion and its place at Stanford

I disagree with the ideas Garry
Grundy put forth on last
week's Opinions page. In fact,
I disagree with one word in par
ticular: "weird." Weird means
strange. But, as in Garry's case,
it usually has a much more spe
cific connotation: It is a eu
phemism for "intolerable." For
instance, when you're gossiping
about that nerd in class that al
ways talks to herself, you say,
"God, she's so weird!" This
doesn't mean simply that she's
different, it means something in
side you finds her behavior intol
erable.
Garry uses this word to de
scribe Stanford's non-denomina
tional nature. This is because the
essence of what he's proposing is
intolerance. To remove this non
denominational spirit is to either
choose one religion or none at all,
and Garry obviously won't take
the latter. We cannot give free
rein to Christian beliefs because
Christians are an over-represent
ed (two-thirds of the world is
non-Christian) majority on this
campus. Christianity is not in
herently bad, but Garry's hege
mony of unquestioning Chris
tianity leads inevitably to reli
gious fundamentalism, which is.
He concludes by saying, "the
'it's all good' attitude dilutes the
potency of a strong spiritual com
munity." I agree. That's why it's
good.

I must confess that I found my
self initially in sympathy with
the sentiments expressed by
E. Garry Grundy 111 in his July
18 Opinions page piece ("The
search for spirit at a Godless uni
versity"). As an atheist who grew
up in a (more or less) Jewish fam
ily, I have had some experience
with the awkwardness and dis
comfort caused by the close prox
imity of widely divergent views
that he describes.
However, my empathy for the
author was considerably reduced
by the apparently inadvertent
irony in which his article was
steeped. Grundy decries the
typecasting of Christians "as
closed-minded, condescending
bigots," but in the next sentence
claims that those who do not
share his belief in a supreme
deity are living in a "fairy tale."
He later asserts that it is only
"[o]ur hyper-intellectualism
[and]. . . our arrogance [that
permit]... us to rationalize God
out of the equation," traits
which he cannot believe exist "at
an institution devoted to the
pursuit of truth." In doing so, he
blithely dismisses anyone who
disagrees with such statements
as being hopelessly in denial, un
able to face up to the "real
world" that open-minded truth
seekers like him inhabit.
But if Grundy's clumsy insen
sitivity were limited to atheists, I
could almost retain some sympa
thy for him: My experiences

growing up among theists have
led me to conclude that such dis
regard for the (at times) strongly
held lack-of-belief of others is
often rooted in ignorance, an ex
periential blind spot resulting
from a lack of contact with those
who do not believe in a god or
gods. However, Grundy also
seems curiously divorced from
any sort of recognition that oth
ers might hold "religious" views
that differ from his. He is puzzled
when his dormmates object to his
desire to erect a Christmas tree,
wondering, "How can anyone find
fault with a symbol that is indica
tive of giving and love?" It seems
to have escaped Grundy that
those of different faiths (Islam,
Buddhism, Judaism, IPUism,
etc.), having had such symbols
shoved in their faces from
Thanksgiving onwards, might fail
to see the "love" in them. Or even
that his fellow Christians, sick of
seeing an object that now stands
more for American consumerism
than anything that could rightful
ly be described as "spiritual,"
might desire a less public but
more meaningful display of faith.
Grundy admits to being "per
plexed by Stanford's lack of toler
ance for spirituality." I suggest
that if his article is a fair indica
tion of what he means by either
"tolerance" or "spirituality," he
has no further to look for a cause
than his own words.
