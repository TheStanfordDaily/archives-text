## Stanford alumnus one of fated TWA passengers 
### Joanna Dickler Editorial staff 
The tragedy of TWA flight
800 hit close to home for some

members of the
Stanford com
munity as it be
came clear last
week that one of
the confirmed
passengers was
Cyril Grivet, a
senior research |
technician from |
France who
worked on the
Stanford campus.

Grivet, who received two mas
ter's degrees from Stanford, one
in mathematics and one in sta
tistics, as well as a doctoral de
gree in applied earth sciences,
had worked at the Carnegie In
stitution of Washington for nine
years. Co-workers recalled him
as being a brilliant asset in the
plant biology lab where he
worked, someone with an exten
sive base of skills in math, com
puters and science who could
build scientific equipment from
scratch.
"It's going to be extremely
difficult to replace him, both as a
technician and as a person," said

Winslow Briggs, director emeri
tus of the department of plant
biology at the Carnegie Institu
tion.
Greg Colello, a post-doctoral
student who worked in the same
lab as Grivet, described him as
"somewhat complex, unusual in
some ways." Colello was the first
person from the lab to receive
the news of Grivet's death.
On Thursday morning, "I was
just sitting here, just working,
early in the morning about 10,"
Colello said. He had heard the
news of the crash, "but I had of
course said to myself, "Thank
God I didn't know anybody on
that flight.' "
Darwin Patnode, a former
employee of the Graduate School
of Business who had played ten
nis with Grivet every weekend
for more than 13 years, was
Grivet's ride to the airport on
Wednesday morning.
"I was watching TV [that
night] and I saw the news an
nouncement. I thought, 'Could
that be his connection?' "
Patnode searched through
possible connection numbers for
Grivet's flight and became "90
percent sure that that was his
connection. ... I called TWA
and of course they were no help

at all."
Patnode de
scribed Grivet as
a man who had
interests rang
ing from swim
ming and sailing
to Shakespeare.
"He was a
wonderful, in
telligent, Re
naissance soul,"
Patnode said.
Xena Brenna,
the executor of
Grivet's will and
a longtime
friend, said
Grivet "was ab
solutely devoted
to trying to find
truth and love as
best he knew."
She added that
"there is a great
deal about him
that is not nec-

essarily know
able."
Another close friend, Carol
Prevost, said Grivet "was on the
quiet side and very sensitive,
soft and gentle, kind of a poet at
heart."
"He was very committed,
loyal and honest to a fault. Even

if you asked him 'how are you,'
he would pause. He would really
tell you how he was," Prevost
said.
She noted that ironically,
Grivet had been apprehensive
about turning 50 at the end of
the year. "That is kind of sad in a
way," Prevost said.

Grivet had been on his way to
visit his family in their Brittany
vacation home. He is survived by
his mother Therese, his brother
Jean-Philippe and his sister
Frangoise.
A memorial service is tenta
tively scheduled for Aug. 25 at
the Carnegie Institution.
