# Pollo's only one of few changes at Tresidder this fall
## Despite temporary closure of Juice Club, negotiations still on for popular business to occupy space in student union

Stanford students, fac
ulty and staff should have
some exciting new addi
tions awaiting them in the
fall at Tresidder Union, ac
cording to Dean of Stu-

dents Marc Wais.
Polio's, a fast-food restaurant chain,
has officially declared that it will operate a
branch in Tresidder beginning sometime
between Sept. 15 and 25."The lease has
been signed . . . [and] we're making tangi
ble progress," Wais said.
Another business that may be ready for
Tresidder in the fall is a campus Juice
Club. According to Wais, Stanford is "ac
tively pursuing and negotiating for Juice
Club to occupy an open space in Tresid
der."
Juice Club, a smoothie bar located in
Town & Country Village that is frequently
patronized by Stanford affiliates, was just
recently closed as the result of a two-alarm
fire that broke out in Hobee's Restau
rant's kitchen five weeks ago. According to

Wais, his understanding is that the tempo
rary closing of Juice Club will not affect
the negotiations for the Tresidder loca
tion.
"We're actively pursuing a Juice Club
location and if we're successful, great,"
Wais said.
He added that if the negotiations with
Juice Club did not work out for the
school's best interest, Stanford would
"bear the burden to bring in the very best
juice vendor."
According to Wais, the target date for
the opening of a juice bar in Tresidder is
Feb. 1, 1997. Under ideal circumstances,
the Tresidder Advisory Board, which is
comprised of students, faculty and staff,
wants a juice vendor in Tresidder by then,
he said.
He cautioned that while Stanford would
consider juice businesses' offers to open in
a vacant space in Tresidder, the Universi
ty would also "cast a very wide net [of its
own] to find the best fit for students, fac
ulty and staff and their unique needs."
A complete redesign of the first floor is
also planned for completion by August or
early September, he added.
Wais said new lighting installations and

a fresh seating design should provide stu
dents with more "mobile, flexible, com
fortable seating" and "lighting for study
ing." The renovations should also "be
ready by the first day of classes," he added.
The changes reflect how Tresidder has be
come more of a study area for students and
a meeting area for group projects rather
than strictly a dining facility.
Businesses within Tresidder may also
be relocating to other areas in the building
over the coming months.
According to Wais, Stanford Hair
styling's lease for its current location will
expire Aug. 31. "It has not been picked up
after [then]," he said. But "we are negoti
ating with the barber shop to relocate
them in a new space on the first floor of
Tresidder." The barber shop can stay in
Tresidder beyond Aug. 31 if there is a new
space for them, he added.
Much of the work on these leases has
been accomplished by the Stanford Man
agement Company, which was responsible
for negotiating the Polio's lease, Wais said.
The Stanford Management Company,
along with the advisory board, makes rec
ommendations to Wais, who then formally
accepts or rejects them.

Speculation has arisen recently that the
relationship between Wais and the Stan
ford Management Company, specifically
Stanford Shopping Center Manager David
Longbine, is strained due to the slow pace
the company assumed in negotiating pos
sible changes to Tresidder. However, Wais
said he was "not at liberty to speak" about
the situation, insisting that he was pleased
with the Stanford Management Company
and that they have been "helpful."
One piece of ongoing news over the past
few years has been the University's out
standing promise of a Tresidder Taco Bell.
After a series of student protests over a
campus Taco Bell because of PepsiCo's in
volvement in Myanmar (the Southeast
Asian country formerly known as Burma),
however, a Taco Bell franchise at Tresid
der became increasingly controversial.
The announcement of the Polio's deal
last spring seemed to appease the people
who felt a fast-food option in Tresidder
was long overdue.
"What we're really trying to do Iwith
these changes] is make Tresidder more of
a campus hub of activity that students,
faculty and staff will gravitate to," Wais
said.
