# Sexual harassment charges face Kenney
## 
### Chad Bennett Editorial staff 
Skip Kenney, the head coach of
men's swimming at Stanford and
the coach of the U.S. Olympic
men's swim team, was named as a
defendant in a sexual harassment
suit filed last week in Santa Clara
County Superior Court.
The civil suit, which was filed
July 17 on behalf of former Uni
versity employee Margery B. Tate,
seeks undisclosed punitive dam
ages and names as defendants
Stanford University and two Stan
ford officials responsible for over
seeing sexual harassment claims.
"As far as everything we know,
it's a non-case," said Director of
University Communications Terry
Shepard, who noted that Tate had
never worked for or with Kenney.
"The timing is rather suspect,
coming as it does when the coach is
in the limelight," added Shepard.
"Anytime people resort to that
kind of tactic it undermines their
credibility."
However, William Warhurst,
Tate's attorney, told the San Jose
Mercury News that they filed the
suit last week in order to avoid

having it voided by the statute of
limitations and because efforts in
the past had failed to settle the
case out of court.
Tate, a 1972 graduate of Stan
ford, met Kenney in 1994 while
swimming recreationally at a pool
on campus.
The 52-year-old Kenney has
coached six national championship
teams during his career at Stanford.
