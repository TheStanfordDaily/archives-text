## All Stanford gymnasts medal 
### David Wolitz Editorial staff 
Stanford gymnasts took the
Olympics by storm this week as
all three University-affiliated
competitors — incoming fresh
man Amy Chow, transfer sopho
more Dominique Dawes and re
cent graduate -Jair Lynch —
earned individual medals.
Sunday night was Chow's
time to shine. Unable to compete
in the individual all-arounds be
cause of coaching decisions,
Chow made the best of her op
portunity on the uneven bars.
Performing her signature move,
the "Chow 2," the San Jose na
tive scored a near-perfect 9.837,
good enough for the silver
medal. Only Svetlana Chorkina
of Russia could best that score,

winning the gold by only .13
points. Dominique Dawes, who
was accepted to Stanford as a
transfer student, turned in a
strong performance of her own
on the bars, scoring a 9.80, only
to be knocked out of medal con
tention by her teammate Chow
and China's Bi Wenjing.
Not to be outdone by her fu
ture schoolmate, Dawes came
back strong the next day, win
ning a bronze medal in the floor
exercises with a score of 9.837.
Dawes' stunning performance
won the appreciation of the At
lanta crowd, and for a short
time, it looked as if her score
might have netted her the gold.
But Simona Amanar of Romania
quickly ended such speculation
by scoring a 9.850, and Lilia
Podkopayeva of Ukraine took

the gold with a virtually flawless
routine, earning a 9.887 from
the judges.
Lynch clinches silver
Also on Monday, Lynch (class
of '93) came up just .012 points
short of the gold medal in the
parallel bars, taking home the
silver instead. Coming into his
last routine, Lynch had to top
Ukrainian gymnast Rustam
Sharipov's score of 9.837. Nail
ing his landing after what ap
peared to be a perfect routine,
Lynch clapped his hands togeth
er and pumped his fist in obvi
ous expectation of a higher
score. He was visibly shocked
when his score of 9.825 showed
up on the scoreboard, and many
in the stands also questioned the
judges' scoring. Still, Lynch be-

came the first African-
American to medal in an
individual gymnastics
event as he closed out a
superb showing by Stan
ford gymnasts.
Are they still coming?
In related news, the fu
ture of Amy Chow and Do
minique Dawes at Stan
ford next fall is now in
doubt after the two agreed
to participate in a year
long professional tour
along with all of the other
U.S. women's gymnastics
team members. Chow has
given up her scholarship,
and it is unclear whether
she and Dawes intend to
resume their education at
Stanford after the tour.
