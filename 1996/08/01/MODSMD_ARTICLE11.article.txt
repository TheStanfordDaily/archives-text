# Lambert's star rises
## 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
Mike Lambert is confident.
It's not the 6-foot-6-inch
height, the muscled arms or the
shoulders broad enough to hang
your clothes on. It's not the fact
that, after one year's leave from
Stanford, Lambert is starting on
the U.S. men's volleyball team in
the Olympics. It's not even that
he's had an excellent tourna
ment, averaging 20 kills a match
and figuring among the team
leaders in blocks and digs. Mike
Lambert is just psyched about
being here.
Meeting for the first time after
the United States' narrow 16-14
loss to Cuba, he was neither de
pressed nor discouraged, but
pumped.
"The loss doesn't hurt us so
much because we have two match
es left in pool play. We want the
top seed in our pool" to advance to
the semifinal round, Lambert
said. He is earnest and direct
when he talks and pauses so as not
to speak too fast. About the single
elimination later rounds, he said,
"I want to come home with some
kind of medal — any kind."
Lambert would seem to be on
the medal track. After stopping
out for a year from Stanford, the
Hawaii native joined the U.S. Na
tional Team in July 1995. He lived
in La Jolla with other members of
the team in a house with a pool
table and the video game Pole Po
sition. They didn't have much
time to play, though: The grueling
training schedule included four
hours of gym training and two
hours of weight training every
day, not to mention two hours of
plyometrics twice a week.
" It was definitely a test of your
physical abilities," said Lambert,
adding that some days "you come
home just completely worked."
The demanding schedule, with
"no distractions like at school,"
was "awesome because your en
tire focus is on volleyball, and
you're there with the best players

in the world." Lambert, at 22 the
youngest player on the team,
shared court time with Olympic
veterans like Jeff Stork and Bob
Ctvrtlik and college opponents
Lloy Ball and Jeff Nygaard.
"It's great," he said with a
smile. "It's like our own Dream
Team."
It wasn't always this easy for
Lambert to focus so exclusively
on volleyball. Saying that he "def
initely" felt burned out at times
— "some days it felt like a job" —
Lambert cited the '95 World Cup
tournament as a low point. He
had to play 11 matches in 14 days,
was bothered by a shoulder injury
and felt like he wasn't improving
or learning anything new. Frus
trated, he went home to Hawaii
for three weeks over the holidays
and "surfed, saw my friends, did
rehab and recharged." In January
he came back mentally and physi
cally renewed.
Lambert's stunning debut at
these Games surprised everyone,
including himself. "There's no
way I expected to be starting in
these Olympics," he explained. "I
always knew I had it in me to be a
quality, international-level vol
leyball player who could con
tribute significantly to the team. I
just thought it would take more
time." He had expected to gradu
ate first, train for two or three
years full-time, and then compete
in the Olympics. However, he sur
passed his expectations to the
point that he started every match
the United States played in this
Olympics.
In some ways, Lambert is still
in awe; his eyes light up like a lit
tle kid's when it comes to the
Olympics. "It's incredible. Awe
some. It's everything I've always
dreamt about times 10." The
Opening Ceremonies: "1 can't re
ally describe it in words — I had
an epiphany, walking in — I was
thinking of when I was a little kid,
watching it on TV, saying, 'Those
are the best athletes in the world!'
and then you go from being a
spectator to being there, and

you're amazed at what you've
been able to do."
In the fall, Lambert will return
to Stanford to finish his final 45
units. "I'm looking forward to it,"
he says. "It'll be fun — it'll be a lot
different" to return to the Stan
ford volleyball team. The interna
tional level of play is so high, he
explained, that the players are
just expected to match it. "It's a
lot harder to perform at that level
when you have to be the source of
it for your teammates."
After college Lambert will
probably play with the U.S. Na
tional Team, in a professional
league overseas or on the beach.
"That's another ambition of
mine, to be a good beach player."
But his eyes are on the Olympic
prize. "Come 2000, I'm willing to
come back, take another year and
train for the Olympics again."

He will have to do so if he
wants a medal. Although Lam
bert stated confidently that
"there's no doubt in any of our
minds that a gold medal is very
possible," it was not to be for the
United States. The anticipated
match against Brazil turned into
a rout. As Lambert put it, "We got
schooled." Brazil beat the United
States in three straight games.
Two days later, the United States
"didn't play at a very high level"
against Bulgaria, missing serves
and making costly hitting errors,

losing 15-12 in the fifth game.
The United States finished
fifth in their pool and failed to ad
vance to the semifinals; only five
more points in the narrow losses
to Cuba and Bulgaria, and the
U.S. team would have finished
first in their pool. After starting
the game, Lambert was taken out.
His shoulder injury, a rotator cuff
impingement that hurts when
moved and "changes the way I
swing," recurred and "affected
my performance and my focus."
But, he added, "I don't want to
make that the scapegoat — to tell
the truth, we just didn't play well
when we needed to." And so, a de
jected Lambert added, "The
Olympics are over."
