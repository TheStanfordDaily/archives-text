# Making a big splash
## 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
Among Stanford's most consis
tently successful sports is men's
water polo. With recent NCAA titles
in 1993 and 1994, the Stanford
water polo program cemented its
claim to excellence with three play
ers on the 1996 U.S. Olympic team:
Rick McNair, '91; Wolf Wigo, '95
and Jeremy Laster, '97. McNair and
Laster found time in their busy
Olympic schedule to sit down and
talk about their experiences.
Air McNair
Since graduating with a degree
in economics in 1991, Rick McNair
has led a picture-perfect life of water
polo success. Not only was he
among the first males ever to ap
pear in the Sport Illustrated Swim
suit Issue (in 1994 — look for him
also in the "Naked Power, Naked

Grace" special edition of Life); the
seven-year national team veteran
can add a professional season in
Italy and a gold medal in the 1995
Pan Am Games to his long resume.
McNair, a two-meter defender who
received the Biff Hoffman Award
for Best Senior Athlete in his final
year at Stanford (an award that
Wigo also won), is 27 years old and
has been playing water polo for 12
years. In a sport where players

reach top strength in their mid-20s,
McNair is in his prime; on the U.S.
team the players' ages range from
22 to 36.
After he graduated from Stan
ford, McNair went abroad to water
polo powerhouse Italy to play pro
fessionally. "I was willing to play
with anyone," he said. "I was just
looking for any team that would
take me." He ended up playing for
seven months on a team based near
Milan. Life wasn't too bad: "As a
foreigner, you get a car — a little
Fiat — and an apartment," plus
practices twice a day and games
every week. Water polo was "all I
did," said McNair with a small
smile.
The hard training paid off when
he returned and earned a spot on
the U.S. National Team, one he has
held ever since. The team trained
together full time from October
1995 at the U.S. water polo training
center in Los Angeles. All the play-

ers lived in Long
Beach and did their
swimming and weight
training programs to
gether. The 20 invited
to the training camp
were narrowed to the
13 the team brought
to Atlanta.
Life in the Olympic
Village, according to
McNair, is pretty sim
ilar to life at the train
ing center. "We walk
from the house to the
dining room to the
pool; we eat and hang
out and do nothing"
between matches.
Apparently the nar-

row focus that such a schedule de
mands was still not enough for the
United States; after making it to the
quarterfinals, the Americans lost to
Spain, which advanced to the gold
medal game against Croatia. Fortu
nately for McNair, his happiness
doesn't depend on water polo alone.
He enters Stanford's Graduate
School of Business in the fall.

Jeremy Laster
Jeremy Laster has red hair and a
goatee. While he avoids being the
blond Adonis model of a California
water polo player, Laster has
achieved the heights of excellence in
his sport: two-time NCAA Champi
on, MVP of the 1994 NCAA Tour
nament and four-year member of
the national team. Laster's national
team commitment made his time at
Stanford particularly challenging.
Tournaments year-round meant fi
nals taken in Argentina, papers
written on planes, exams fed-exed
back to campus on disk. The strain
was not just academic; one reason
Laster "didn't have a great college
season in the fall of'9s" was that he
was coming directly from a grueling
national team international tour.
The conflict between student and
athlete, between Stanford and the
national team, grew until Laster de
cided to "avoid the whole shuttle

thing" after 1995 and take the next
year off to train full-time for the
Olympics.
Laster said that the difference in
level of play between collegiate and
international water polo ("Here
guys give you a perfect pass every
time") also made the transition
back to Stanford difficult. "It's a bit
frustrating to go back down to the
collegiate level, where you're ex
pected to do everything: offense, de
fense, and be a team leader. On the
national team, it's much more spe
cialized; everybody does just one
thing, instead of a little of every
thing. You can concentrate on doing
one thing well."
Laster's position is left-handed
driver, one thing he does very well
indeed. But he's not ranking one ex
perience above the other. "It wasn't
like Stanford or the national team
was better; both were major compo
nents of a successful career in water
polo, and I've been glad for the op
portunity to do both."
Laster doesn't see himself play
ing, as McNair did, overseas. "I have
no real desire to go to some foreign

country where I don't know the lan
guage and just sit around by my
self." Instead, he plans to return to
the Farm in the fall, enjoy the nov
elty of "being just a student" and
graduate with a degree in econom
ics. After that, it's almost definitely
more water polo, more national
team and another Olympics or two.
One last, burning question from
the fans: Just what is it that goes on
under the water?
"A lot of grabbing," said Laster,
"suit, leg, arm — guys trying to get
or take back the advantage. There's
a lot of kicking, tugging, pulling,
checking, getting elbowed in the
face. You'll see a lot of guys have
scars on their faces, near the eyes."
Some teams are worse than oth
ers. "The Ukrainians and Hungari
ans are hacks — it's the bigger,
slower teams that are a lot more
physical." So is it that anything the
refs don't see goes? "Basically," said
Laster, grinning. He could be speak
ing about his own life when he says
of the U.S. team, "We're playing
well right now, so it's getting excit
ing."
