## earner to Stanford 
### Jodi Michaels 
This Saturday, the San Francis
co Jewish Film Festival will come to
Palo Alto for the first time ever,
naming as its venue Stanford's own
Cubberley Auditorium. At the age of
16, the festival is the oldest, largest
and most prestigious forum in the
world for independent Jewish Film.
It involves over 49 films and videos
from 12 countries, a dozen of which
will be shown at Stanford.
A universal festival for peace
This year's festival is dedicated to
the people of all faiths who strive for
peaceful coexistence in the Middle
East. Several of the films highlight
this theme, including "Voices From
Gaza: By God's Will," a look at a
family living in Gaza. The films hold
something for till people; they exam
ine, often with humor, young love,
the struggle for identity, gay cul
ture, survival and family. Even films
with religious content convey mes
sages for non-believers.
The festival will make you think,
enlighten you Jind most of all enter
tain you. Ifyou're up for some inde
pendent cinema this week you're

lucky to be at Stanford.
Young directors, classic films
The festiv;il both begins and ends
with young, hip films. The opener is
"Saint Clara," one of the few Israeli
feature films in history to enjoy U.S.
distribution. With a hard guitar
rock soundtrack, the film follows
seventh-grader Clara's witch-like
premonitional powers in a futuristic
industrial town in Israel. Angry
"revolutionary" youngsters and ec
centric adults observe and are im
pacted as the heart of the young girl
overpowers her mind.
The closing feature is "Dogs: The
Rise and Fall of an All-Girl Bookie
Joint," directed by Eve Annenberg.
"Dogs" is "a very low budget film
out of New York" said Sam Ball,
I J alo Alto coordinator of the festival.
II Ls a wacky screwball comedy about
women and their ambitions in the
big city.
Yet another film created by a
young writer/director is "Echo
Soup," a short directed by Stan
ford's own Daniel Baer, a master's
student in documentary film. The
film profiles three musicians: a Tai
wanese-San Franciscan rapper, a

straight drummer in a gay rock
band and an African-American

Klezmer musician.
Dealing with the theme
of cultural borrowing, each
musician plays "music
which defies expectations of
who they are," Baer said.
Many issues echo in Baer's
soup: What is authentic?
And does one have to fully
embrace a culture or can one
pick and choose from the
array of offerings?
The festival shows an
other face
Not all the films in the
festival are so tied into cur
rent culture, however. Sev
eral deal with history and its
effects on the present, docu

menting lives from earlier in the
century, including the time of the
Shoah (a Hebrew word for the Holo
caust).
"When I Was Fourteen: A Sur
vivor Remembers" is a film docu
menting Bay area resident Gloria
Lyon's miracle survival. Lyon lived
through seven concentration camps
during the Holocaust, remaining

ilent about her story until the mid
970s. The film travels from 1990s

San Francisco to Auschwitz in the
19405.
Another film depicts the Holo
caust from two very different view
points. "Oskar and Jack," a docu
mentary from the German director
Frauke Sandig, tells the story of
identical twins separated shortly
after their birth in 1933.
Oskar spends his childhood in

Germany with a Catholic mother,
while Jack spends his in Trinidad

with his Jewish father.
While Oskar is in the Hitler
youth, Jack swims in the
ocean with his black
friends. Jack pioneers in Is
rael while Oskar lives
under the roof of his Nazi
stepfather even after the
war.
The two finally meet as
early twentysoinethings,
only to argue about politics
and part for another 20
years. As old men they
come together and, instead
of uncovering more differ
ences, they learn of their
many similarities. Their
story is fascinating and con
fronts issues of culture,
identity and brotherhood.

Tickcts to the film festival can be
purchased through the ticket office
in Tresidder, by calling Bass, or
over email (ordcrs@tickets.stan
ford.edu). They are $7 in advance
and $4.50 for seniors; an all-movie
pass costs $65. For directions and
information, call 723-1210 through
Aug. 8.
