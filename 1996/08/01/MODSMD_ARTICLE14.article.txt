# TRACY BONHAM
## The Burdens of Being Upright
### 
With "Jagged Little Pill" stil
occupying space on Billboard's
Top 10, it seems premature foi
record companies to be scurrying
in search of "the next Alanis,'
but it's never too early for knock
offs to start popping up on the
music scene.
As much as Tracy Bonhair
isn't interested in being labelec
another angry fern alt
singer/songwriter, she does ap
pear to have that "next Alanis'
tag wrapped up with her over
played single "Mother Mother'
dominating radio airwaves.

Actually, "Mother Mother" 's
gimmick is quite a catchy one:
sashaying acoustic guitar into
jerky grunge-stomp into a ca
cophony of squealing distortion,
upon which Bonham screams
"I'm losing my mind, every
thing's fine!"
This song's angst and irony
are tailored for maximum Gen-X
appeal, so naturally it has found
its home at modern-rock radio
stations everywhere. Her second
single, "The One," is more
straightforwardjangly rock that,
while nothing special, would still
make entertaining filler on a Liz
Phair or Aimee Mann album.
On the whole, Bonham's full
length debut is a turgid bit of
fluff which mostly goes in one
ear and out the other. "Navy
Bean" is an exception as a Breed
ers-ish slab of New-Wavy power
pop.

Unfortunately,
most of the songs
drag relentlessly
on, just tuneful
enough to grab
some attention
but not quite
compelling
enough to cap
ture the rest of
your interest. It's
a shame, since
Tracy Bonham
has a certain lik
able sound, the
kind of perky
postpunk pop
that made the
Pixies (and later
Frank Black) so
cool. But she
doesn't quite cap
italize on her
songwriterly
chord changes
and bursts of cool

noise. Her cheesy quasi-liberat
ed-girl lyrics don't help her caust
either, as when she steals the
"bend over, Casanova" rhyme
from PJ Harvey, or the useless
"Cellophane is thicker than it
seems, put it on and don't asl<
what it means."
Yeah, it doesn't mean any
thing, so don't bother asking. A
disappointing end product from
usually good influences.
