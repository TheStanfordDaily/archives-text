# ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA
## Summer Evening 
### 
The Orpheus Chamber Orches
tra is a unique ensemble of 22 mu
sicians that performs without a
conductor. With no fixed concert
master or principal flutist as such,
each member rotates within the
orchestra to share the spotlight.
After two decades of conductor
less existence, this ensemble has
developed a formidable rapport
that dispels any doubts about its
ability to deliver top-flight perfor
mances rivaling those of formally
conducted orchestras. Indeed, the
new album "Summer Evening" is
a living testament to the excep
tional quality of this group.
Zoltan Kodaly's "Hungarian
Rondo" is a short work based on
gypsy themes, its scoring rich and
concise. The Orpheus ensemble
vividly captures the caprice and vi
vacity that is the essence of gypsy

with a sharp and res
olute style. The orches
tra plays with such a
tight sense of synchro
nization that one seems
to hear an enlarged
string quartet at work
instead of an orchestra
with individual players.
Similarly, in Koda
ly's "Summer Evening"
the Orpheus ensemble
delivers a singularly
beautiful and cohesive
performance. There is
an uncanny balance be
tween ease and tension
that results from the
combination of finely
chiseled details which
suggest sultry evening
air under a starlit sky.
By far the most ar
resting piece on the

program is Josef Suk's
"Serenade for String Orchestra."
It is a work strongly colored and
influenced by its predecessor in
this genre, Dvorak. Like Dvorak's
"Serenade," the Suk's is full of
Czech tenderness and nostalgia.
After considering the work's in
genuity and beauty, it is surpris
ing that Suk's "Serenade" is rarely
heard in the contemporary concert
hall. The Orpheus ensemble ex
hibits a cornucopia of tone color
and rich nuances in its vigorous
rendition of this much neglected
piece, doing it full justice as it de
serves. Lovers of big, sweeping
melodies will especially savor this
richly scored "Serenade."
The Orpheus Chamber Or
chestra's excellent execution of
innovative repertoire makes
"Summer Evening" a superb con
tender for string orchestra music .
