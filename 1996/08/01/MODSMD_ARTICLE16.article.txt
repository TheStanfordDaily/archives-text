# JOE'S
## APARTMENT 
### 
I can see the storyboard at MTV
studios for "Joe's Apartment" —
"Um, like, kind of like 'Cricket in
Times Square' meets 'Gulliver's
Travels' meets a stoned Disney,
starring Keanu Reeves and Drew
Barrymore look-alikes ... a re
volting (in all senses) pubescent
romance where cockroaches con
trol the cosmology of New York
City, from love to land grants.
Dig?"
Based on an MTV mini-produc
tion, "Joe's Apartment" is the
story of a wealthy, reform-minded
New York senator with designs to
build a maximum security prison
on a lot in the East Village. His
only obstacles? His public-service

minded daughter,
the last guy living
on the lot (Joe) and
a battalion of ten
thousand cock
roaches.
While Daddy-0
plots to force people
off the land by hir
ing two East Village
thugs, good-na
tured Jenny waxes
lyrical to build a gar
den/park in the
same piece of land.
The sight of two
kids who are build
ing a model-size
crack house out of
syringes found in
the squalid lot in
spires Jenny to ac
tion.
Joe, the last per
son living in the
only apartment left
standing on this
East Village block,
meets the cockroach

army living in his apartment.
They like his dirty habits and
promise to serve as his ally. Joe,
who after striking this cannot hold
a job (the cockroaches follow him
everywhere), finally gets two aus
picious offers, one as drummer in a
rock band and the other as an em
ployee of P.I. Smith, the largest
urinal cake manufacturers
throughout the entire city. Both
offers lead him fortuitously to
Jenny.
Putting up posters for his new
band, Shit, Joe runs into and falls
in love with Jenny, who is also
putting up signs (for her park pro
ject). She comments that her pro
ject would benefit greatly from
something he has: shit. Enamored
of her, Joe invites her to his first
performance with Shit and then
runs off to collect hot dung from
animals citywide for fertilizer.
From here on, "Joe's Apart
ment" becomes a question of how

to succeed on THE BIG DATE (or
score). Screw-ups and fights with
Jenny and the cockroaches leave
Joe a lonely guy, but by divine in
tervention of the cockroaches
Jenny gets her garden . . . and,
well, Joe gets to hoe it.
This movie appeals to the
young white teenage male in sill of
us — there's sexual obsession (a
hot blond chick), scatological
humor and maybe even some
black subjugation (those dirty,
garbage-loving cockroaches sing
mostly funk and gospel). There's
also "alternative" music (Moby,
Guru, Greenday), subtle refer
ences to drug use (Joe reads Bur
roughs . . . ) and transgression
against the Establishment as the
hero and heroine take back the
land from Mr. White-haired Sena
tor.
