# LONE STAR
## 
### 
"Lone Star," written, directed
and edited by John Sayles ("The Se
cret of Roan Inish"), triumphs be
cause of its "Citizen Kane'Mike par
allel construction. Like Orson
Welles, Sayles employs a wonderful
flashback technique which simulta
neously allows two eras of charac
ters to form one coherent narrative.
Superb screenwriting in this
film intermingles its peculiar char
acters with a rhythmic flow of infor
mation. The poet ic manipulation of
time, a fundamental tool of filmic
artistry, exposes the viewer to es
sential dialogue in a precise visual
organization.
In "Lone Star," a Texas county
sheriff named Sam Deeds (played
methodically by Chris Cooper) pen
sively explores the mystery of a 40-
year-old skeleton unearthed in the
desert. By interviewing Rio Coun
ty's ethnically diverse elders, Sam
reassembles the iniquitous history
of a Texas border town. Deeds' duty
is compounded by evidence which
implicates his father, former Rio
County Sheriff Buddy Deeds
(Matthew McConaughey).
Buddy Deeds enters the narra
tive through folk tale accounts of
Rio County in the 19505. For the
flashbacks, Sayles pans the camera
without cutting, which makes time
appear to swim seamlessly between
past and present. While characters
recall their versions of Buddy's
stiff-armed justice, Sayles is able to
depict events that, like recorded his
tory, are open to subjective inter
pretation.
Sayles manipulates mood with
strategic shifts that carry emotion
between the two eras. Continuous
transitions between these time pe
riods color our perception of the
events.
The peripheral characters in

"Lone Star" lend "Fargo"-like oddi
ty to the subplots. Intricate revela
tions of the past hold various coun
ty members in webs of significance.
The Texan style of "Lone Star" is
enhanced by outstanding acting.
Kris Kristofferson plays the malev
olent Sheriff Charlie Wade, one of
the best corrupt lawmen in recent
film history. Kristofferson exudes
the frightening internal ugliness of
an unscrupulous man bestowed
with too much authority.
Sayles' inclusion of the subtle de
tails of Kristofferson's character re
flects the inherent racial tension
historically found in Texas. Repre
sentative of an increasingly hetero
geneous American culture, "Lone
Star" affronts standard concep
tions of American history. Recorded
history favors those who control
and construct it. The power of
"Lone Star" stems from a unique
subtext that alleges distortion ex
ists within any group's history.
