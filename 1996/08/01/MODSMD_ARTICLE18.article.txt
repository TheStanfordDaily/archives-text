## Column Nick Thompson Who are our heroes? 
### 
I'VE DONE TWO really
painful, challenging, and so
cially unacceptable things
this summer: bathed myself in
crushed garlic in an attempt to
make an organic mosquito repel
lent (yes, I was living alone) and
read Allan Bloom.
Bloom's surprising bestseller,
"The Closing of the American
Mind," came out about eight
years ago — when I was old
enough to buy any book that
looked like it might be aimed at
criticizing humanity, but too
young to actually want to read it
— and had been sitting on my
bookshelf ever since.
The tome begins with a trea
tise about the death of the soul of
college students. Not surprising
ly for a book written by a churl
ish, conservative professor from
the University of Chicago, the
first 10 pages of my copy are cov
ered with expletives, scrawl and
various condemnations of Bloom,
his motives and the tradition he
comes from. Eventually, howev
er, I began to realize that, hidden
among the Stanford Review-like
analysis of the multicultural cur
riculum, Bloom's book is full of
gems, insightful analyses and
honest attempts to understand
our generation.
One section struck me hard:
Bloom's analysis of college stu
dents and heroes. To Bloom, col
lege students have no heroes.
And he's right. We have scattered
role models, people we want to
look like, people we find funny

but no one we really feel repre
sents our images of idealism.
There are no writers we all read
on our own free will, there are no
political figures we truly respect,
there aren't even any rhetori
cians who speak to and about our
needs and ambitions. As Bloom
writes, "I we] have powerful im
ages of what a perfect body looks
like and pursue it incessantly.
Deprived of literary guidance,
I we] do not have any image of the
perfect soul, and hence do not
long to have one."
Bloom's right. We idolize
Michael Jordan, Olympic athletes
or whoever's emaciated frame ap
pears on the cover of Mademoi
selle. These figures represent
physical perfection, and we spend
countless hours trying to puff our
muscles, pop our zits and girdle
our guts until we look and jump
like these idols. We don't have fig
ures whose souls we want to cap
ture and make our own.
Bloom offers to solve this
problem by prescribing a good
spanking with Plato's "Republic"
and submersion in a pile of The
seus or Romulus. I would try
something else: renouncing pop
culture and searching within our
current society for figures repre
senting, in one sense or another,
any idealism we might still have.
We don't have what Bloom
calls "literary guidance" not be
cause there is a deliberate ploy to
deny us intellectual growth.
Rather, there is a deliberate plan
to force consumption and finan

cial growth upon us — even if it
comes at the expense of other
kinds of growth. Everyday, we are
subjected to ads on television, in
newspapers, on the Internet, on
billboards, etc., asking us to drink
certain kinds of sugar water, buy
shoes or spend our money on
other worthless products.
Michael Jordan is promoted as a
hero because by worshipping him,
we will buy basketball tickets,
watch him on TV (along with
more ads), buy his shoes and
spend money trying to be like him.
This promotion of heroism is not a
malicious plan; it is a natural off
shoot of the free market, greed

and our own susceptibility to ac
cept what is thrust in our faces.
To take another example, con
sider music. The musicians that
get signed to major record labels
or who get serious airplay have
nothing challenging to say and
represent nothing that anyone
with any ambition would ever
hope to be. They fit nicely into
specified images and what they
say can be processed in sound
bites. Artists like Ani Difranco or
anyone else with a serious mes
sage don't have a chance. If Bob
Dylan tried to make it in today's
music industry, he'd just be piss
ing against a brick wall — trying

to make it without flash, sex ap
peal, Ticketmaster or a sponsor
ship from Pepsi, the choice of a
new generation.
Our lack of heroes isn't a prob
lem in and of itself — in fact, blind
idolatry is undoubtedly a bad
thing. What is a problem is our
lack of idealism and our lack of
ambition to break out of the
molds that have been made for us.

If Nick Thompson had to make a
list of heroes today, it would in
clude Rod Coronado, Bob Moses,
John Coltrane, Ani Difranco, Ed
ward Abbey and Aung San Sun
Kyi.
