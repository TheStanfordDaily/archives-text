Monument needs no explanation

David wolitz's piece
on the Pioneer Monument
caught my oye. I had a few
things to say.
First, in condemning the men
tality behind the statue of the tri
umphant priest and subjugated
Native, Wolitz makes evident an
underlying bias. It is prevalent in
universities: the belief that the
United SUites' origins were excep
tionally violent and unjust.
Not so. Every New World state
and quite a few Old World ones
had a similar beginning, namely,
the destruction of aboriginal cul
tures. Even the traditional soci
eties of Taiwan and Japan were
founded by emigrants who exter
minated their nomadic predeces
sors.
As for our history being

"whitewashed," that is hardly a
risk. For better or worse, we are
the most self-questioning of
major countries. We periodically
endure wracking debates over
textbooks and museum exhibits.
Nor is our nation's present-day
treatment of surviving aborigines
worse than what goes on in
Brazil, say, or Australia.
The above is not meant to ex
cuse what happened; it is meant
to add some perspective.
Wolitz goes on to say that the
monument's "celebration of Indi
an defeat" makes it "unfit as a
civic monument" and that it is a
"period piece." Therefore, it
should be consigned to a history
museum where its message "can
be explained [read: debunked] by
more than an one-line inscrip

tion." He and his allies are so in
secure about their left-wing mes
sage that it has to be "explained"
(read: hammered home) at
length.
Every monument is a period
piece by definition and reflects its
own era. I suppose the Statue of
Liberty should be melted down
because Miss Liberty is a white
woman and the statue doesn't
warn of the exploitation and op
pression that awaited all those
gullible immigrants.
Let the visitors to the Pioneer
Monument, most of whom al
ready consider the Indians' plight
a tragedy, think for themselves.
They don't need some insulting,
bullying "explanation."
