# My two cents
## Jesse Oxfeld Brought to you by sponsorship and the Olympics 
### 
THERE IS LITTLE to be writ
ton about the commercializa
tion and hype surrounding
this summer's Olympic Games that
has not already been penned by writ
ers who get paid more than I do. Still,
I'm a cocky Stanford student, and
I'm convinced my insights deserve to
be published.
I also just returned from a week
end trip to Atlanta.
After all, despite my non-interest
in examples of athletic ability, de
spite my distaste for huge crowds
and summer heat, despite my fear of
the South, when I received an invita
tion to the Games I couldn't help but
think that I might never have the
chance again and shouldn't pass up
such an offer.
So I committed a horrible breach
of journalistic ethics and accepted
free tickets to two nights of Dream
Team basketball from a person I for
merly covered. Three days later, a
certain former COP member and I
found ourselves aboard a Continen
tal airliner en route to Atlanta.
Upon arrival, the scene in the air
port certainly seemed to support the
commercialism-gone-mad warnings

sounded about the Atlanta Games. In
the 50-foot walk through the termi
nal to the maze of baggage conveyors
was assembled a collection of blue
chip corporate logos worthy of a con
servative mutual fund's prospectus.
Greeters waved signs beckoning the
guests — all of whom were, of course,
bona fide Very Important Persons —
of AT&T, IBM, Visa, NBC, Reebok
and, of course, Coca-Cola.
Our basketball tickets were cour
tesy of the NBA, and we'd been told
that they could be picked up at the
league's hospitality center in the
Ritz-Carlton. No problem getting to
the hotel, located as it is smack-dab
in the middle of downtown. Getting
in was another story. We had to pass
the muster of an NBC intern (don't
you just hate those too-big-for-their
britches college kids working at net
work TV summer jobs?) and be is
sued bright yellow NBC Sports pass
es to enter the building. Apparently,
control of entrance and egress to At
lanta's top hotel had been entirely
ceded to the television corporation.
As we wandered through Centen
nial Olympic Park, we discovered
areas closed off to all but those who

were guests of the Games' sponsors.
As we silt in our prime Georgia Dome
seats that first night, it became clear
that only those with corporate con
nections held even a long shot of get
ting into lower tier seats at this
Olympic event — unless they were
A-list celebrities, like our section
mate Spike Lee.
Was this, I wondered, an
Olympics accessible only to the fa
mous or connected? Could I have
gotten in if a friend of a friend wasn't
an NBA bigwig? Have the Olympics
become a private attraction, put on
as entertainment for the sponsors'
guests?
At first glance, it does appear that
the Games have become nothing
more than another big business. The
head honcho of the group producing
the Games holds a title more appro
priate for a corporate flow chart than
an athletic contest: The Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games'
Billy Payne is known as a CEO. His
group doles out sponsorships to any
company with enough cash. Watch
ing TV commercials in Atlanta, I dis
covered that truly every aspect of the
Games had an official sponsor. Ad

vertising alongside the really big
names like Coca-Cola and IBM was
MART A, the official spectator trans
portation system, and Nationsßank,
the official bank. BMWs with in
signias proclaiming their official
Olympic status prowled the streets
of Atlanta, and Crystal Spring sold
the official bottled water.
Yet as my cynicism reached its
peak and I found myself muttering
nearly incessantly about the ACOG
fascists, I glanced around the Geor
gia Dome's interior and noticed that
it lacked any obvious signs of spon
sorship. In fact, while an average
NBA arena features revolving court
side ads for any product imaginable,
the Dream Team trounced Argenti
na surrounded only by the "Atlanta
1996" logo.
As commercialized as the Games
as-spectacle have become, the
Games-as-sport remained relatively
unaffected. As I spent more of my
weekend wandering Atlanta, I also
realized that the unconnected were
not entirely shut out. NBC may have
taken over the Ritz, but I ran into a
family who showed up at the Westin
— across the street from the Ritz —

the night of Opening Ceremonies
and got a room for the weekend. A
stroll down Peach tree Street showed
that scalpers had plentiful supplies
of tickets to most every event avail
able at, and sometimes below, face
value. How they made a profit I don't
know, but the point is that despite all
of the money changing hands be
tween acronymed organizations, the
Olympics were not only for the privi
leged.
The most egalitarian aspect of the
Atlanta Olympic experience was
Centennial Olympic Park, filled as it
was with throngs of visitors simply
enjoying themselves. The park pro
vided a place where Coca-Cola execu
tives and road-tripping students,
people with tickets and without,
tourists and Atlantans, could simply
enjoy the Olympic spirit — a rare
commodity in that it as yet has no of
ficial sponsor. And even a bombing
can't change that.

Jesse Oxfeld, a Daily editor, is spend
ing his summer in New York work
ing for ABC News, which is not the
official network news of the Olympic
Games.
