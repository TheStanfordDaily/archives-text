## Minority doctors serve more of underprivileged 
### Elisabeth Traugott Contributing writer 
Research done in part by Asst.
Health Research and Policy Prof.
Laurence Baker suggests that if
opportunities for minority stu
dents to attend medical school are
jeopardized, access to health care
for the poor, the uninsured and
ethnic minorities may be put at
risk.
The study, published in the
most recent issue of Inquiry, a so
cial science periodical, suggests
that minority physicians serve a
larger proportion of minority and
underprivileged patients than
their non-minority counterparts.
The findings bolster the argu
ment for affirmative action pro
grams in medical school admis
sions programs which have been
questioned in recent months by the
University of California, as well as
by some public universities in the
South.
Stanford's School of Medicine
has an aggressive affirmative ac

tion program and admits a higher
than-average number of minority
students each year, according to
Fernando Mendoza, associate dean
of student affairs at the Medical
School and assistant professor of
pediatrics. The Medical School has
been running an early matricula
tion program for minority stu
dents for the past 10 years to en
courage minorities to enter acade
mic medicine, he added.
Nationally, only 2 percent of
academic doctors are from minori
ty groups, he said.
At the time the program was im
plemented, only 20 percent of mi
nority medical students at Stan
ford did research, as compared to
65 percent of their non-minority
counterparts. Ten years later, "we
have leveled the table in that
arena," said Mendoza, pointing to
the fact that 65 percent of minority
students now do research as well.
Mendoza said the goal of pro
grams like Stanford's is "not only
to give people the opportunity to
fulfill their potential, but also to re

ceive those people back into the
communities" from where they
came.
A key component of Baker's re
search was the discovery that
"racial factors are a much stronger
predictor of service than economic
background," according to Baker.
There is only a marginal difference
in likelihood to treat underserved
groups when comparing those
from the lowest and highest eco
nomic classes (13.1 percent of
physicians from the lower class
serve the uninsured, as compared
to 10.3 percent of those from upper
class backgrounds).
Baker offered a few explana
tions as to why minorities end up
treating underserved members of
the community in the current
health care arena where few people
are able to choose their primary
care physicians.
There is a possibility that jobs in
public clinics and emergency
rooms are easier to find, that they
are the "easiest access points" for
new doctors, Baker said.
He commented that there may
also be an element of familiarity at
work, "a coincidence of physicians
locating in places they are most
comfortable in."
But the study concluded that
the most likely explanation is that
there Ls an underlying "strength of
commitment" to help those who
traditionally have little access to
adequate health care, and who
tend to seek it at a later stage of
their illnesses.
This claim Ls backed by physi
cians' responses to questions about
why they chose their field. Those
who report that it is "very impor
tant" to treat those who have little
access to care, treat on average
31.7 percent poor patients and 20
percent uninsured. Those physi
cians who say that income poten
tial is "very important" draw only

10.3 percent of their patients, on
average, from the uninsured popu
lation.
The research was conducted be
tween 1987 and 1991 in a survey of
6,000 doctors under 40 years old
with two to nine years of practical
experience. The sample was
weighted by over-selecting minori
ty physicians to balance the under
representation that is characteris
tic of the medical profession.
Five years ago, only 9 percent of
first-year medical students were
from minority groups. According
to the literature cited by the study,
this statistic has risen to 12 per
cent for the most recent entering
class, but still does not reflect the
fact that 20 percent of all Ameri
cans are African-American, Mexi
can-American, Native American or
Puerto Rican.
The goal of the study was to un
earth the "underlying stories," the
reasons young doctors choose cer
tain clinical situations, Baker said.
More specifically, the study asked
young doctors if they felt they had
a "calling" to treat underserved
groups, or whether they took jobs
in these demographic areas be
cause they couldn't find anything
else.
As Baker said, the study tried to
approach the issue of what hap

pens as careers progress, whether
inexperienced doctors "stick with
their choices" or move on to more
lucrative specialties after a few
years.
They were trying to discern a
trend typified by the "Joel Fleis
chmans of the world," Baker said,
referring to the fictional physician
on the popular television show
"Northern Exposure." These are
doctors who trade in loans for ser
vice in areas of low socioeconomic
status, Baker said.
Building on past research which
suggests that the first several
years of a young doctor's career are
relatively unsettled, the investiga
tors concluded "that serving the
underserved is not simply a matter
of'paying one's dues' prior to mov
ing into more remunerative or less
stressful practices."
The study found that young
black doctors surveyed said 46 per
cent of their patients were black,
while white doctors on average said
only 17 percent of those they treat
ed were black.
Hispanic doctors were three
times as likely as white doctors to
treat Hispanics and had the high
est percentage of uninsured pa
tients, at 17 percent.
