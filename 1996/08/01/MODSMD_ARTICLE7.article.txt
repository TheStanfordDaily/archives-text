# Researchers look to genetics to battle autoimmune disorders

Genetic vaccinations for autoimmune disorders
such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and
juvenile diabetes may be available in as little as 10
years from now if the results of a recent study per
formed on rodents at Stanford can be replicated in
human subjects.
In this month's issue of Nature Medicine maga
zine, Lawrence Steinman, a professor of neurology in
the School of Medicine, published results of research
conducted on laboratory mice in which the autoim
mune response — when the body reacts against itself
— is switched off using a vaccine for autoimmune en
cephalomyelitis, the mouse version of MS.
The technique, known as "genetic vaccination,"
uses genetic code from a disease as a means to build
immunity in the body of the animal into which it is in
jected.
Over the past few years, researchers have discov
ered that animals could be immunized against dis
eases such as influenza by injecting them with the
DNA from the virus, but Steinman's lab was the first

to show how a disease could be suppressed using the
technique.
Steinman and his collaborators paralyzed labora
tory mice by giving them a disease which is similar to
the human version of multiple sclerosis.
They then cloned the gene that encodes the T-ceLI
receptor for the rodent disease, which had been pin
pointed in previous research, and used it to make a
vaccine, dubbed "naked DNA."
Although the injection that reverses the disease is
called a vaccine, it is not the type of "booster shot"
that we normally think of, Steinman said. Rather, it
is a vaccine which elicits a "suppressive response" in
a disease that is already in progress, as opposed to a
"stimulatory response" to prevent a disease from oc
curring.
Researchers don't know exactly why these vacci
nations are so effective, but they are working on dis
covering the answers.
Steinman uses cautious optimism to describe his
project, and stressed that "this will not help people
with any of these diseases in the near future. Maybe
a decade from now we will have suppressive vaccina
tions, but certainly not for at least 10-20 years."
