Stanford Magazine wins prize
Stanford Magazine, the University's
alumni magazine, was named the 1996
Robert Sibley Magazine of the Year in a con
test sponsored by the Council for Advance
ment and Support of Education and judged
by editors from Newsweek.
The magazine, which publishes bi-month
ly, was selected as the best among a field of
more than 100 university-published entries.
Judging was based on the submission of two
issues, and criteria included both design and
editorial content.
"I think they look for a magazine that
has an independent stance and is willing to
be regarded by the alumni as a place they
can go to get an independent eye on the ac
tion of the University. You know, a place
you can trust," said senior editor Raymond
Hardie, who served as acting editor for the
December issue, one of the two submitted
forjudging.
The award — which includes a $2,000
prize — was presented last month at a dinner
held at the San Francisco Hilton, where the

magazine was praised for "its rich, interest
ing writing" and several judges noted that
they "thought it in a class by itself "
Stanford Magazine last won the award
four years ago.
"We're proud to get it," Hardie said. "We
beat everyone else — Harvard, Yale, the
whole bunch of them."

FRI graduate garners award
Were (pronounced wear-ay) Omano, a re
cent Ph.D. graduate of the Food Research In
stitute, became the third Stanford student in
four years to be awarded the "Outstanding
Dissertation" award from the American Agri
cultural Economics Association.
Omano's dissertation challenged prevail
ing economic thought in the 300,000 person
Siaya district of Kenya. Food Research Prof.
Jeffrey Williams, Omano's principal advisor,
said the Kenyan native noticed that many ex
perts just "had it all wrong."
"The Agricultural Extension people rec

ommended that the farmers grow cotton in
stead of maize," Williams said. The recom
mendation stated that cotton could be traded
as a cash crop at the market. "Were noticed,
however, that their modeling used prices at
the local market town some 15-20 miles away.
They would have to carry the cotton all the
way to market, and carry corn all the way
back."
Williams quipped, "It turns out that in the
local dialect, 'to be crazy' and 'to go to mar
ket' have the same root word."
Omano, who received a Rockefeller Foun
dation fellowship to attend the Food Re
search Institute, is currently giving back to
his native country by teaching at Ejerton
University in Kenya as an assistant profes
sor.
Omano's dissertation, titled "Smallholder
Agriculture Under Market Reform: The Case
of Southern Siaya District, Kenya," was
Stanford's entry into the AAEA competition.
"This is it," Williams said. "This is the big
award in agricultural economics."
