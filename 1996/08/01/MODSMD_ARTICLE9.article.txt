Eight actors from the Stanford Summer
Theater group, in call-and-response fash
ion, enunciate the tongue twister that one
of the graduate student directors, Thomas
Freeland, voices out to them.
"Zooooooooooo! Zoooooooooo!"
In the dim light of the Memorial Audito
rium stage, the actors can be seen working
their hips around like loose screws. "It's all
about releasing tension in the voice which
would otherwise restrict expressiveness,"
revealed Freeland. "Work with your
chords and your body, and you'll be
warmed up and ready to perform. These
basic beginnings are essential."
Warm-up is not the only challenge that
the Stanford Summer Theater group is
confronting this summer. Revitalized after
a year of dormancy, the group functions on
a modest budget, cast and resources as well
as a limited amount of time. Eight thou
sand dollars, plus the cooperation of the
Drama Department for costumes and
other technical support, are the lifeline of
the group.
Six weeks for two productions, "Much
Ado About Nothing" and "Henry V,"
translates into about two weeks of re
hearsal time for each. A cast of 13 and
eight, respectively, includes both regular
and summer session students with varying
degrees of formal training or, more impor
tantly, rehearsal availability.
The two drama graduate student direc
tors, Freeland and Jac Royce, lead the
group and teach acting classes through the
summer, but without full enrollment by
the actors.
In short, Stanford Summer Theater is

the chance for students to concentrate on
performance and to pursue their interest
in drama, even if the resources are modest.
"We are forced to reinvent summer theater
within certain parameters," said Royce.
"This is great," Kristen Meinhold, who

played Margaret in "Much Ado," said of the
program. "I've worked with Jac and Tom
throughout the year, and this summer is
an opportunity to do something I really
love doing."
Yet summer theater has not always exist
ed in this capacity at Stanford. Nor is it like
ly to remain as underfed in the future. July
and August productions of the past suggest
that summer theater at Stanford experi
ences a cycle which is rather organic. Partic
ipation in and reception of theatrical produc
tions — whether summer or not — waxes
mid wanes as students' and the public's free
time and monetary situation fluctuates.

Thus, on the one hand, this summer's
reappearance of theater does not mark the
definitive recuperation of Stanford drama
from a censurable past. A happening sum
mer theater reveals just as much of the
Drama Department as a dormant one. On
the other hand, as the last 30 years of sum
mer theater demonstrate, the variability of
institutional, private and / or independent
support and motivation demands clarifica
tion.
An inconsistent history
"In the 19605, people were throwing
money at the arts, things were splashy, and
summer theater was a creative laborato
ry," said Ronald Davies, chair of the Drama
Department. Summer theater was the
renowned Stanford Repertory Theater and
was eager, lissome and rich enough to
carve a niche for actors from undergradu
ate, graduate and even professional levels.
"Several hundreds of thousands of dol
lars," according to Davies, "were available
to organize workshops, teach classes and
put on productions."
Yet this fact proved more the exception
than the rule, since throughout the 19705,
summer theater became more difficult to
sustain. "Modern summer theater" did not
emerge until later that decade.
No longer receiving the generous fund
ingof the previous decade, summer theater
of this period was borne out of the pockets
of avid students, mostly on the graduate
level. In an era when fellowship money was
made available for summer activities, sum
mer theater at Stanford had the financial
backing necessary to organize and form a
thriving theater company.
In 1979, a core of graduate students
took the cue from a dynamic year of drama
and proposed a flurry of theatrical activity

to summer session administrators. Re
cruiting from the pool of Stanford hangers
on and summer session heads, the group
planned and performed a series of large
and small productions under the name
Drama at Twelve.
In the first year of its three-year stint,
Drama at Twelve boasted a series of latter
week lunch time performances at the
Nitery and one midnight Friday perfor
mance in Little Theater with regular audi
ence followings. According to Royce, these
performances developed into a successful
summer theater with a strong professional
bent.
In the following two summers, the
group stuck to the same performance for
mat and added union actors to their list of
players. However, the theater also suffered
adversity — smaller pockets and succes
sion of leadership made coordination and
production significantly more difficult.
In 1981, the University deemed drama
fellowship money unavailable for summer
activities, thereby rendering summer the
ater at a disadvantage. None of the stu
dents saw fit to attempt to support them
selves and a theater company, and thus,
summer theater turned into a worthless
venture.
The price of performance
In the mire of low funding, nominal
leadership on the part of both the faculty
and students, and sluggish summer atten
dance, summer theater lay dormant dur
ingthe mid-1980s. Not until the late 1980s
did summer theater reappear in a capacity
similar to that of the previous decade. This
time, however, summer session adminis
trators took the initiative to resuscitate ac
tivity, providing the bulk of the budget and
making summer theater part of the cur
riculum.
In 1988, three graduate students hired
to teach several acting classes during the
summer aimed for the more ambitious goal
of recreating the success of the late 19705,
once again combining Nitery and Little
Theater productions. Popularity among
students and the public encouraged its re
turn the following year, when two faculty
stepped in to help lead and professionalize
the group.
It was determined, however, that sum
mer theater complicated things more than
it clarified and inspired. Faculty were too
expensive and sometimes had academic
obligations that conflicted with their abili
ty to produce, publish and research.
"Furthermore," as Davies explained,

"when doing plays is curricular, conflict
arises between paying and non-paying stu
dents." In the late 1980s, paying students
who brought in much-needed revenue for
the group's operating costs were not neces
sarily contributing sufficiently in either
numbers or talent. Outsiders or the non
paying students provided a logistical head
ache. While their participation was wel
come, their freeloading was not.
Summer theater found itself bound by a
numbers game and a bottom-line philoso
phy on one side, and a commitment to nur
turing actors without summer session in
volvement on the other.

(Summer theater founb

moofoement on
the other.

The early 1990s saw the abolition of fac
ulty involvement and a weakening sum
mer activity. In 1990, an undergraduate
alumna established Harvest Theater at the
same time that the department's graduate
students were leading their summer the
ater courses.
The following year, Harvest Theater re
ceived underwriting from the University
while Drama Department students and ad

ministrators decided to be inactive. Sus
taining the project was problematic until
1992, when Stanford Summer Theater
closed its doors.
In 1993, the momentum of academic
year drama activities — led by Prof. Winter
Mead — carried Summer Theater through
a successful season. Inside Out was a group
comprised primarily of undergraduates
and graduates who had participated in
Mead's intensive two-quarter acting class
and extra-curricular theater group, Red
Hoop Players.
With intense resolve during the acade
mic year and the fortune of private dona
tions, Inside Out found itself well-pre
pared for the summer. An already estab
lished cast, a selection of plays to perform,
two directors (both Mead and an under
graduate student), and most importantly,
a house in which almost all of the cast
would live from June until August, enabled
the group to delve into a serious summer of
acting without being tied to the numbers
game.
Due to its wide reception and recogni
tion, Inside Out built upon its successes
and turned into Outside In the following
year. However, private donations and ac
tors' pocket change had decreased consid
erably. It was discontinued in 1995, during
which time there was no summer theater
at all.
Back in costume
This year's revitalization of summer
theater hints at hope for the future. The
University's decision to fund theatrical ed
ucation and production this year hints at
plans to expand the project in years to
come.
The spotted history of summer theater,
however, may stand in the way. From one
crest to another, things are always unpre
dictable, and if summer theater is to serve
the purpose of intense theatrical education
and successful performance and produc
tion, actors will have to rely either on their
own intense, independent capabilities and
financial resources, or on the inspiration of
graduate student directors and the fortu
itous appearance of faculty or professionals.

Outdoor performances of "Henry V" will
take place next Thursday through Sunday
and again the following week on the
evenings of Aug. 15-18. All performances
are at 6 p.m. in the courtyard between
Memorial Auditorium and the Ralph Lan
dau Economics Building. Admission is
free.

Six weeks for two productions, "Much
Ado About Nothing" and "Henry V,"
translates into about two weeks of re
hearsal time for each. A cast of 13 and
eight, respectively, includes both regular
and summer session students with varying
degrees of formal training or, more impor
tantly, rehearsal availability.
The two drama graduate student direc
tors, Freeland and Jac Royce, lead the
group and teach acting classes through the
summer, but without full enrollment by
the actors.
In short, Stanford Summer Theater is

the chance for students to concentrate on
performance and to pursue their interest
in drama, even if the resources are modest.
"We are forced to reinvent summer theater
within certain parameters," said Royce.
"This is great," Kristen Meinhold, who

played Margaret in "Much Ado," said of the
program. "I've worked with Jac and Tom
throughout the year, and this summer is
an opportunity to do something I really
love doing."
Yet summer theater has not always exist
ed in this capacity at Stanford. Nor is it like
ly to remain as underfed in the future. July
and August productions of the past suggest
that summer theater at Stanford experi
ences a cycle which is rather organic. Partic
ipation in and reception of theatrical produc
tions — whether summer or not — waxes
mid wanes as students' and the public's free
time and monetary situation fluctuates.

Thus, on the one hand, this summer's
reappearance of theater does not mark the
definitive recuperation of Stanford drama
from a censurable past. A happening sum
mer theater reveals just as much of the
Drama Department as a dormant one. On
the other hand, as the last 30 years of sum
mer theater demonstrate, the variability of
institutional, private and / or independent
support and motivation demands clarifica
tion.
An inconsistent history
"In the 19605, people were throwing
money at the arts, things were splashy, and
summer theater was a creative laborato
ry," said Ronald Davies, chair of the Drama
Department. Summer theater was the
renowned Stanford Repertory Theater and
was eager, lissome and rich enough to
carve a niche for actors from undergradu
ate, graduate and even professional levels.
"Several hundreds of thousands of dol
lars," according to Davies, "were available
to organize workshops, teach classes and
put on productions."
Yet this fact proved more the exception
than the rule, since throughout the 19705,
summer theater became more difficult to
sustain. "Modern summer theater" did not
emerge until later that decade.
No longer receiving the generous fund
ingof the previous decade, summer theater
of this period was borne out of the pockets
of avid students, mostly on the graduate
level. In an era when fellowship money was
made available for summer activities, sum
mer theater at Stanford had the financial
backing necessary to organize and form a
thriving theater company.
In 1979, a core of graduate students
took the cue from a dynamic year of drama
and proposed a flurry of theatrical activity

to summer session administrators. Re
cruiting from the pool of Stanford hangers
on and summer session heads, the group
planned and performed a series of large
and small productions under the name
Drama at Twelve.
In the first year of its three-year stint,
Drama at Twelve boasted a series of latter
week lunch time performances at the
Nitery and one midnight Friday perfor
mance in Little Theater with regular audi
ence followings. According to Royce, these
performances developed into a successful
summer theater with a strong professional
bent.
In the following two summers, the
group stuck to the same performance for
mat and added union actors to their list of
players. However, the theater also suffered
adversity — smaller pockets and succes
sion of leadership made coordination and
production significantly more difficult.
In 1981, the University deemed drama
fellowship money unavailable for summer
activities, thereby rendering summer the
ater at a disadvantage. None of the stu
dents saw fit to attempt to support them
selves and a theater company, and thus,
summer theater turned into a worthless
venture.
The price of performance
In the mire of low funding, nominal
leadership on the part of both the faculty
and students, and sluggish summer atten
dance, summer theater lay dormant dur
ingthe mid-1980s. Not until the late 1980s
did summer theater reappear in a capacity
similar to that of the previous decade. This
time, however, summer session adminis
trators took the initiative to resuscitate ac
tivity, providing the bulk of the budget and
making summer theater part of the cur
riculum.
In 1988, three graduate students hired
to teach several acting classes during the
summer aimed for the more ambitious goal
of recreating the success of the late 19705,
once again combining Nitery and Little
Theater productions. Popularity among
students and the public encouraged its re
turn the following year, when two faculty
stepped in to help lead and professionalize
the group.
It was determined, however, that sum
mer theater complicated things more than
it clarified and inspired. Faculty were too
expensive and sometimes had academic
obligations that conflicted with their abili
ty to produce, publish and research.
"Furthermore," as Davies explained,

"when doing plays is curricular, conflict
arises between paying and non-paying stu
dents." In the late 1980s, paying students
who brought in much-needed revenue for
the group's operating costs were not neces
sarily contributing sufficiently in either
numbers or talent. Outsiders or the non
paying students provided a logistical head
ache. While their participation was wel
come, their freeloading was not.
Summer theater found itself bound by a
numbers game and a bottom-line philoso
phy on one side, and a commitment to nur
turing actors without summer session in
volvement on the other.

The early 1990s saw the abolition of fac
ulty involvement and a weakening sum
mer activity. In 1990, an undergraduate
alumna established Harvest Theater at the
same time that the department's graduate
students were leading their summer the
ater courses.
The following year, Harvest Theater re
ceived underwriting from the University
while Drama Department students and ad

ministrators decided to be inactive. Sus
taining the project was problematic until
1992, when Stanford Summer Theater
closed its doors.
In 1993, the momentum of academic
year drama activities — led by Prof. Winter
Mead — carried Summer Theater through
a successful season. Inside Out was a group
comprised primarily of undergraduates
and graduates who had participated in
Mead's intensive two-quarter acting class
and extra-curricular theater group, Red
Hoop Players.
With intense resolve during the acade
mic year and the fortune of private dona
tions, Inside Out found itself well-pre
pared for the summer. An already estab
lished cast, a selection of plays to perform,
two directors (both Mead and an under
graduate student), and most importantly,
a house in which almost all of the cast
would live from June until August, enabled
the group to delve into a serious summer of
acting without being tied to the numbers
game.
Due to its wide reception and recogni
tion, Inside Out built upon its successes
and turned into Outside In the following
year. However, private donations and ac
tors' pocket change had decreased consid
erably. It was discontinued in 1995, during
which time there was no summer theater
at all.
Back in costume
This year's revitalization of summer
theater hints at hope for the future. The
University's decision to fund theatrical ed
ucation and production this year hints at
plans to expand the project in years to
come.
The spotted history of summer theater,
however, may stand in the way. From one
crest to another, things are always unpre
dictable, and if summer theater is to serve
the purpose of intense theatrical education
and successful performance and produc
tion, actors will have to rely either on their
own intense, independent capabilities and
financial resources, or on the inspiration of
graduate student directors and the fortu
itous appearance of faculty or professionals.

Outdoor performances of "Henry V" will
take place next Thursday through Sunday
and again the following week on the
evenings of Aug. 15-18. All performances
are at 6 p.m. in the courtyard between
Memorial Auditorium and the Ralph Lan
dau Economics Building. Admission is
free.

Eight actors from the Stanford Summer
Theater group, in call-and-response fash
ion, enunciate the tongue twister that one
of the graduate student directors, Thomas
Freeland, voices out to them.
"Zooooooooooo! Zoooooooooo!"
In the dim light of the Memorial Audito
rium stage, the actors can be seen working
their hips around like loose screws. "It's all
about releasing tension in the voice which
would otherwise restrict expressiveness,"
revealed Freeland. "Work with your
chords and your body, and you'll be
warmed up and ready to perform. These
basic beginnings are essential."
Warm-up is not the only challenge that
the Stanford Summer Theater group is
confronting this summer. Revitalized after
a year of dormancy, the group functions on
a modest budget, cast and resources as well
as a limited amount of time. Eight thou
sand dollars, plus the cooperation of the
Drama Department for costumes and
other technical support, are the lifeline of
the group.
