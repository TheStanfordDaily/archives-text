## Can't see the forest for the Screaming Trees 
### Seeta Gangadharan 
Suggestive of Twin Peaks' talk
ing logs, owls, white and black
lodges.. .ofNorthwesterners'char
acteristic withdrawal into and syn
chronicity with the woodlands, the
name Screaming Trees occupies a
Pacific Northwest creepiness. At
least that's what I guessed prior to
my interview with the band by that
name. Boy, was I wrong.
Composed of Mark Lanegan (vo
cals), Gary Lee Conner (guitar), Van
Conner (bass) and Barrett Martin
(drums), Screaming Trees isn't as
contrived as I had thought. Accord
ing to Conner, "The name came,
like, mostly from a guitar effects
pedal called the screaming trees that
Van has. A bunch of other bands had
the same name that we did so we
had to, to put it lightly, get rid of
them. There was one group that had
an album, two-guy techno things...
mostly 12-inches. But they broke up
after a while. We sold more records
than them."
Not exactly the dark and spooky
backwoods response I had imag
ined. The part about an effects pedal
having that name was cool, but "we
sold more records than them" hint
ed at lameness. In fact, the ensuing
conversation with Conner led me to
believe that in addition to being "not
contrived" (which is good), Scream
ing Trees were also not that com
pelling (bad).
A group of four men who've seen
10 years of moderate notoriety as a
"Seattle band," Screaming Trees is
coming this summer to the Bay Area

with the Lollapalooza concert series.
If association with the concert heist
were not enough of a turn-off, this
group's general top-40 alterna-rock
puff-playing is enough to convince
you of their insignificance on the
music scene.
Snippets of my conversation
with Conner:
S: Is Lollapolooza a sausage metal
fest?
C: Yeah. It's definitely a little weird.
They are definitely all men. Usually
they definitely, like, you know, have
girl bands, guy bands ... rap, you
know. They did have Wu Tang Clan
on for a while, but this year is all guy
rock. We can't help it because we're
till guys and we're a rock band. We'd
definitely like to see a little more di
versity in the lineup. . .there'smore
leaning towards Metallica It's great
for us since we're playing in front of
way more people than we ever have
before, and they're, like, diggin' us.
So, we can't complain.
S: Audience — are these a bunch of
rich alternative kids hanging out
getting dirty?
C: Pretty heavily under 20. Which is
weird because a lot of the bands are
older, like Soundgarden, us, the Ra
mones, Metallica.... it's probably
like everyone's real old.
S: Is that strange?
C: We're used to it by now. I think
that it's weird over the years — like

our crowd sort of, like, got younger.
It used to be that people who were
into us were our age, in their early
20s. But now, it's more like people
are 14 to 18, maybe 20 years old. I
don't know, you get used to it,
though. You don't really think of
those people as the same way if you
were a normal adult and not in a
band.
S: More generally... you guys came
about mostly within the context of
grunge and that's died down by
now. What effect did that have?
C: Yeah, I don't know. We'd been
doing the same thing for years, and
then suddenly a lot of other bands
who were doing similar things that
we were doing, like Nirvana, sud
denly got huge. You know, that kind
of helped us out because we sold
more records than we ever sold be
fore. We're a rock band, but we do
pop songs too. You know, that's,
like, always been our thing. So now,
even though that's died down, we're
still doing our own thing. And fortu
nately, rock is really big, and even if
the, like, whole whatever Seattle
thing is like gonna die down, rock is
here to stay or whatever. We're basi
cally just like a rock band.
S: Have you sold out?
C: We always try to make the best
records we can with the resources
we have. When we were at SST
[Records] we hardly had any money
to do it. Now that we're on Epic we
have a lot more money to do it; we

can make a better sounding album
than we did on $3,000, which was
about how much SSP gave us,
which isn'ta lotof money. If we have
sold out, I'd like to know where the
money is.
S: Does it bother you and your band
that certain things happen in the
media which carry musicians away
from what's important?
C: Sometimes it's irritating, be
cause certain things detract from
what's important in music, you
know. The coolest thing about the
Seattle thing — all these Seattle
bands being really big — is a lot of
them were great and really good.

Nirvana was and always will be one
of my favorite bands since when I
first saw them in 1988 before any
one knew who they were. And the
same thing with Mudhoney, who
never really got that big, in 1989...
. In the underground they were re
ally good. Alice in Chains,
Soundgarden, whatever. ... I
think it's really great that they
have been realiy successful. But on
the other hand, a lot of the hype
that goes on detracts from music
stuff.
To me the really important thing
is trying to write good songs and put
them on a record — what I still enjoy
doing. I like playing live, but the
main thing for me is writin' songs.
