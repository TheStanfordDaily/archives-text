# HIS NAME IS ALIVE
## Stars on ESP 
### 
On their first two albums, His
Name Is Alive (HNIA) were less
interested in writing songs than
they were with simply making
weird sounds. Frontman/gui

tarist/mad scientist Warren De
fever combined sparse, near-am
bient Gothic soundscapes,
spooky echoing chimes, and sud
den bursts of percussion-like
guitar static on "Livonia" and
"Home Is In You Head," both of
which conjured up images of a
midnight convention of angels in
an abandoned industrial ware
house.
After making more out of less,
HNIA released their third album

"Mouth By Mouth," replete with
more fully realized pop-type
songs, but they were even weird

cooed lyrics about cornfields,
lemon oceans, eating dirt, Van

crashed and subsided over
sound-beds of repeatedly echo

drums make regular appear

songs in the traditional sense.
The production weirdness is

mostly gone, replaced by a bevy
of musical styles and influences;
there's some dub, some country
folk, some '50s-style pop and
even some "surfy" moments.
The overall mood of the album is
very sunny, laid-back and clas
sic-sounding, but there's still a
measure of the old HNIA in the
music (notably "Movie" and
"The Sand That Holds The
Lakes In Place"). "Country
