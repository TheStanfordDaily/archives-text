London Records seems eager to jump onto
the Olympics bandwagon in this new release
featuring works of Michael Torke, a
renowned American composer widely fea
tured in the 1996 Olympic Games. The heroic
"Javelin," the first track on the CD, is a prod
uct born of the festive occasion. The rest of
the disc is simply culled from Torke's earlier
compositions.
For listeners wary of atonal, dissonant and
avant-garde trends in contemporary music,
Torke's work can sound surprisingly melodic.
Die-hard modernists would definitely have a
field day denigrating his music as passd,
anachronistic or even cliche. But one can hard
ly deny his ingenuity in fusing the classical and
popular influences into a highly tasteful genre.
All the pieces on this disc prioritize "listenabil
ity" over thematization, formal structure or
harmonic novelties.

Torke's determination to make his
music "sound good" certainly makes it
easier on the audience, who no longer has
to squirm, cringe, or suffer through the
endless cacophony found in modern
works. Yet Torke seems to have only a
few tricks up his sleeve. After a while, all
the pieces somehow start to sound the
same.
Granted, "Javelin" has its moments of
grandeur. For example, "Run" is not de
void of fluidity. And yes, the orchestral
scoring is idiomatically executed to fur
ther promote a sense of ease and spon
taneity. But overall, the same ploys and
devices are recycled over and over again.
With the musical orientation decided
ly more commercial than anything else,
seasoned listeners would probably know
better than buy this CD for a full $15.99
at Tower Records. But for people who
enjoy trying out "different" stuff or who
simply want to be bathed in the glory of
the Olympics, this CD might have some
thing else to offer.
