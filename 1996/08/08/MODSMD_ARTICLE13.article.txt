# LOLLAPALOOZA '96
## 
### Sam Bloomberg-Rissman George Borg 
After waiting for too many
fuckin' hours in the hot sun we
were finally admitted to what Ls
supposedly the best festival of the
summer. A lot of time and sunburn
could have been saved if the pro
moters had canceled every band ex
cept Me tallica and Soundgarden.
Since our driver got us there late,
the first thing we saw were the
Shaolin Monks. These Buddhists
from the heart of China put on a
spectacular show demonstrating
the power of the mind over matter
For example, one of the monks fo
cused a mystical earth energy on his
throat, and then proved how his it
could be made invincible to the
points of spears. With his neck
pressed against the tips of two
spears and a cement, block placed on
his back, a second monk pounded
him on the back with :i sledgeham
mer. He came out without a
scratch.
Following the monks came the
Bay Area punk band Itancid. Fran
tically scurrying and hopping
around the stage, they managed to
put on a decent but forgettable set.
The musical highlight of their
thankfully short set was their very
ska-ish version of their radio hit
"Time Bomb," on which they were
accompanied by the talented New
York City All-Star Ska Band. Nev
ertheless, they were still the best of
a bad lot.

The next performance was a dis
appointing set from the Ramones.
Over-hyped and under-talented,
they put on a very boring show. The
only thing their Ix)llapalooza per
formance proved was that they
should have quit 10 years ago on a
good note.
While the Ramones were dron
ing away on the main stage, Sponge
was putting together a mediocre set
on the second stage. It became im

mediately obvious that the show
was not going to be the greatest
since they had to open the set with
two women in skimpy outfits shak
ing around on stage to get the
crowd's attention. We need not say
more.
Since the second stage was so
boring, we wandered back to the
main stage. There we saw yet an
other band that had to resort to
kitschy stage antics to get people to

listen to them. If the Ramones won
the prize for dullest stage show,
Devo should have gotten the '80s
award. They wore retro Ghost
buster-like plastic yellow uniforms,
which they later tore off to reveal
black outfits with short shorts and
red kneepads. The only musical
highlight was when Devo played
"Whip it."
After this desert of mediocrity,
we reached an oasis of talent. With

a receptive audience, Soundgarden
presented an hour of truly kick-ass
music. Rather than disguise medi
ocrity with stage antics, they let
their music do the talking. Chris
Cornell displayed his musical
prowess in an elegant solo perfor
mance of "Black Hole Sun." Their
powerful renditions of "Out
shined" and "Jesus Christ Pose"
gave ample proof that the band is
still hard.
Following Soundgarden's mini
malist performance, the audience
was met with the extreme opposite.
Metallica, the final performer of the
night, left the crowd waiting until
sundown. They built excitement
and teased the crowd by coming on
stage and then leaving. It was evi
dent from the crowd's reaction that
this trick functioned beautifully.
James Hetfield played on the
crowd's energy by leading chants of
"We don't give a shit!" which the
crowd emphatically shouted. In
fact, it was characteristic of Metalli
ca's performance to emphasize
pleasing the crowd over musical vir
tuosity. The real driving force of
their show was the pure energy that
rippled through the crowd.
Metallica also had the most elab
orate stage show of the entire festi
val. The show had elaborate py
rotechnical displays, especially
when the band performed "One,"
which started off with a five-minute
war scene, replete with machine
gun sound effects, explosions and
fireworks.
