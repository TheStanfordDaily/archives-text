# TRAINSPOTTING
## 
### 
Don't believe the hype. It may
not be the fault of the film itself,
but the disappointment that ac
companies a mediocre cinematic
experience is always greater when
the PR is fabulous and overdone.
"Trainspotting," the much
talked-about second film from di
rector Danny Boyle, aspires to be
the hippest drug flick of the '90s:
a slick version of "Drugstore Cow
boy" and "Kids," an updated

"Clockwork Orange."
The film begins with the voice
over (throwback to "Clockwork")
of main character Renton, played
by Ewan McGregor, as he ex
pounds on his philosophical deci
sion to "choose heroin" over life.
The dirty injections begin almost
immediately, as does the attrac
tive but typical trippy camera
work.
The characters get high and lie
down with their eyes closed. The
drug component of the film is flat,
and the characters are equally dif
ficult to comprehend. The de
tached view of heroin use makes it

even easier for the healthy yuppie
viewer to see the characters as
anything but identifiable and fa
miliar. Kenton and his friends are
the Other, easy to laugh at and
easy to abandon.
Renton decides to get clean,
and the result is a 10-minute hal
lucination scene. His dense
friend, Spud, appears manacled
above the doorway of the enlarged
bedroom, and a baby crawls on
the ceiling until it is directly
above him with its head turned
around backwards. The scene lies
somewhere between horror and
humor, but like the rest of the

film is not to be taken seriously.
The homicidal bar-rat, Begbie,
inspires fear but is left undevel
oped. Spud is a lovable smack
fiend but remains a stereotype.
Tommy is Kenton's honest friend
whose failing love life spins him
into heroin addiction, and at his
funeral we find that he actually
died from germs in his kitten's
feces.
"Trainspotting" is so busy try
ing to make a name for itself in
the archives of counterculture
film that it forgets the powerful
and complex components of the
films it uses as influences. "Drug

store" carried itself on its gritty
details and dialogue, while
"Clockwork" was a wacky experi
ment in psychosis. This most re
cent attempt at examining side
line culture is not a frank look at
heroin use, but a palatable review
of stereotypes, easy for the aver
age hip viewer to stomach, digest
and dispose of.
Everyone can breathe easier
knowing that this is only on film,
but nothing is left to the imagina
tion, and there is little to think
about when the film is over.
