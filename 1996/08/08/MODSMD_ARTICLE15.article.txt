						TIME TO KILL

### 
Despite the unnerving presence
of a few too many Confederate flags,
"A Time To Kill" is an excellent
film.
The plot is simple: Two drunken
men rape a young girl and attempt
to kill her. Only she is black, and
they are white, in the southern
state of Mississippi, and she is
found barely alive.
Her battered, bloodied 10-year
old body symbolizes a racist hate
crime that raises questions of jus
tice and brings old fears and preju
dices to a head. This crime keeps the
small Mississippi county on tenter
hooks.
The town is divided along race
lines. Klansmen and other whites
seek the death penalty for Carl Lee,
the girl's father (played by Samuel
L. Jackson), who dared to kill a
white man. The NAACP, blacks

and others are seeking freedom and
exoneration for Carl Lee because he
did what many felt they would do in
the same situation.
If the plot isn't enough of an at

traction, then perhaps the motley
crew of stars in "A Time To Kill"
will help. Samuel L. Jackson ("Pulp
Fiction"), Sandra Bullock
("Speed") and Kevin Spacey ("The

Usual Suspects")
combine skills to
make the film
worth seeing.
Thrown in for
good measure is
the father-son
combination of
Kiefer and Donald
Sutherland. The
two are on oppos
ing sides, with the
senior Sutherland
playing a drunken
but justice-loving
ex-lawyer and his
son playing a
"God-fearing
Klansman."
The acting is even
too believable at
times. The dia
logue is realistic

and the thread of a forbidden ro
mance that flows between married
lawyer Jake (Matthew Mc-
Conaughey) and law student Helen
Roark (Bullock) is enough to keep a
straying eye interested. The action
scenes are brutal yet captivating,
the plot twists clever and the court
room views compelling.
"A Time To Kill" is a film that
asks many questions about guilt
and responsibility. Was it Carl Lee's
responsibility as a loving father to
take justice into his own hands and
kill the boys who hurt his daughter,
or were his actions inspired by guilt
for failing to protect her? Does the
responsibility lie instead with his
lawyer, Jake, who knew his inten
tions and did nothing to stop him?
The film confronts the viewer
with similar questions: What would
one do in a similar situation? It also
questions whether justice will ar
rive, what form it will take and —
most importantly — what color it
will be.
