White sauce with dried tart cherries over
portobello mushrooms
This dish would be ideal as a sophisticated vegetarian entree that is
both filling and snazzy. I created the succulent white sauce hoping to
fully celebrate the rich textured flavors of the portobello mushroom.
The key ingredients to this special white sauce are the dried tart cher
ries (I use dried pitted tart Montmorency cherries from Trader Joe's),
rosemary and scallions. Allow an hour for cooking and preparation.
Ingredients:
1/4 pint milk 1 cup finely sliced button mushrooms
3 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
1/4 pint heavy cream
4 tbsp. flour portobello mushrooms
dry white wine 2 tbsp. dried tart cherries
3 scallions black pepper
fresh rosemary buttered olive oil
1 1/2 cup mix of asiago, parmesan and romano cheeses

Directions:
Sauted the whole caps of four portobello mushrooms in butter with
a splash of olive oil, coarsely ground black pepper and garlic on high
heat until the mushrooms absorb all the liquid. Then pour in 1/4 cup of
the wine, add a few sprigs of fresh rosemary and turn down the heat.
Turn the heat all the way off when the mushrooms are tender.
For the sauce:
In a separate pan, fmely chop the tender green parts of the scallions and
sauted in olive oil with more black pepper and fresh rosemary. Add the tart
cherries, then add the sliced button mushrooms. Stir and cook until the
mushrooms are tender but not falling apart, and the cherries bloat.
Add the cream to the sautee, gradually stir in the flour and add the
milk. You may want to gently whisk the mixture to make sure there
are no globs of flour.
Simmer the sauce for a few minutes while stirring, then add the white
wine to taste, add the grated cheeses and stir constantly on low heat until
the cheeses melt smoothly. Add the juice from the portobello mushrooms.
Slice the portobello mushrooms into half-inch thick moustaches
and drench with white sauce. Add Italian parsley as garnish. Serve im
mediately.
