## Column David Wolitz Sand Hill project: We can afford to pass 
### 
FOR WEEKS I'VE been read
ing about the debate over
Stanford's controversial
plan for the Sand Hill Road Corri
dor, and I had found myself rela
tively unmoved by both sides. Now
I feel I cannot support the propos
al.
This is a classic developer v.
conservationist battle, with the
University playing the role of de
veloper and various community
activists, mostly from Menlo Park,
resisting the planned changes that
would affect their daily environ
ment. Basically, the university
wants to enlarge the Stanford
Shopping Center, build a massive
new apartment complex, establish
a posh home for seniors (senior cit
izens, that is) and extend Sand Hill
Road to connect with El Camino.
The Draft Environmental Impact
Report came out a couple of weeks
ago, and its validity is now being
debated before the Palo Alto Plan
ning Commission.
Yesterday, I went out on my
bike and rode along the Sand Hill

Road, stopping periodically to
look at the Environmental Impact
Report that details how the corri
dor would change if the current
plans were realized. For those
worried that the new develop
ments would make Sand Hill Road
a less hospitable place for pedes
trian and bicycle traffic, I can only
say this: It couldn't get any worse
than it already is. The status quo
is a horribly narrow bike lane pre
cariously separated from the road
by a nasty raised strip of concrete.
Needless to say, there are no side
walks. One can see that it is a
country road carrying many more
cars that it was originally intend
ed to serve. And given the ridicu
lous dead-end that it comes to in
the shopping center parking lot,

widening and extending Sand Hill
Road to El Camino makes perfect
sense.
But it is not the amelioration of
biking and jogging conditions that
has Stanford managers chomping
at the bit. For the skeptic who
asks, "What's in it for Stanford?"
there are almost an embarrass
ment of choices. The shopping
center expansion, the Stanford
West Apartments and the Stan
ford West Senior Housing projects
will all be big money makers for
the University. (One might add
that the increased traffic they
generate will more than fill up the
widened road.) Stanford man
agers are shrewdly taking advan
tage of a red-hot real estate mar
ket and a boom in upscale shop
ping to boost University revenues.
And as students who have a very
real stake in the financial
strength of the institution, we
should be naturally sympathetic
to what appears to be a winning
business proposition.
But as members of the commu-

nity, as residents of Stanford, Palo
Alto and Menlo Park, we have an
equally strong interest in main
taining the character of the area.
And there is no question that the
proposals substantially alter the
nature of the Sand Hill Road corri
dor in very real ways.
The biggest loss both environ
mentally and aesthetically is the
open meadow, the last untouched
site between San Francisquito
Creek and Sand Hill Road. Now, to
be honest, calling the site a mead
ow is stretching it a bit; it's no
place for picnics. But it is one of
the campus' secret gems, a place to
bike around or walk through on
your way to Menlo Park. More im
portantly, it is one of the last
places on campus from which you

have a relatively unobstructed
view of all of the surrounding
foothills. For an idea of how differ
ent the 47.8 acre site would look
post-construction, take a look at
the already built Oak Creek Apart
ments further up Sand Hill Road:
a very pleasant complex, to be
sure, but hardly an addition to
Stanford's natural appeal.
This is ultimately what the de-

bate is about: What kind of west
campus do we want? Do we want a
densely populated yet still auto
dependent area serving as a prima
ry link between Highway 280 and
El Camino, or do we want to main
tain an outdated yet still quite
pleasant country-like road with
fields on both sides? As Bob Dole
might say, it's a question of char
acter.
While most of the corridor
would change from semi-rural to
developed suburban status, the
construction of four-story parking
garages on both sides of the shop
ping center would make the
planned Sand Hill-El Camino in
tersection nothing less than an
urban bottleneck.
To be sure, this is not the end of

the world; in fact, the economic
benefits for Stanford and Palo Alto
are considerable. But one has to
wonder, given the rather rosy eco
nomic conditions of the area,
whether this isn't one of those pro
jects we can afford to pass up for
quality-of-life reasons. I don't
mean to be blase about the area's
economic good fortune; one need
only step into East Palo Alto to see

that poverty is a fact of life for tens
of thousands of area residents. But
not even Stanford's community
relations spokespeople tout the
plan as a munificent anti-poverty
program. Stanford and Palo Alto
will make more money and a few
more retail jobs will open up, but
Stanford and Palo Alto would do
just fine without the new develop
ments. The project would simply
create a bonus boost in revenues to
a handful of already wealthy insti
tutions.
In the end, what is most trou
bling about the whole develop
ment process is a lack of Stanford
student involvement. Undoubted
ly, the rather suspicious fact that
the Draft EIR came out over the
summer, when most of the affect-

Ed students are gone, has much to
do with student silence. But that is
no excuse.
This is, after all, our campus,
and we ought to take an active in
terest in how the powers-that-be
administer it. Take a ride or walk
around the Sand Hill Road corri
dor, take a peak at the EIR avail
able in all Palo Alto libraries, see
what is to become of our west cam-

pus. It is on issues like these that
the character and ultimately the
whole environment of our Univer
sity is determined. An ambitious
but still fledging Stanford "sold
out" its eastern flank 40 years ago
in a bold move to create a high
technology industrial park. The
results were ultimately a boon to
the University's quality and the
creation of a prosperous Silicon
Valley. Today, must a confident
and established Stanford sell out
its western flank for a much less
promising venture that threatens
to erase the last vestiges of under
developed land in this super-devel
oped Valley?

ments. The project would simply
create a bonus boost in revenues to
a handful of already wealthy insti
tutions.
In the end, what is most trou
bling about the whole develop
ment process is a lack of Stanford
student involvement. Undoubted
ly, the rather suspicious fact that
the Draft EIR came out over the
summer, when most of the affect-

Ed students are gone, has much to
do with student silence. But that is
no excuse.
This is, after all, our campus,
and we ought to take an active in
terest in how the powers-that-be
administer it. Take a ride or walk
around the Sand Hill Road corri
dor, take a peak at the EIR avail
able in all Palo Alto libraries, see
what is to become of our west cam-

pus. It is on issues like these that
the character and ultimately the
whole environment of our Univer
sity is determined. An ambitious
but still fledging Stanford "sold
out" its eastern flank 40 years ago
in a bold move to create a high
technology industrial park. The
results were ultimately a boon to
the University's quality and the
creation of a prosperous Silicon
Valley. Today, must a confident
and established Stanford sell out
its western flank for a much less
promising venture that threatens
to erase the last vestiges of under
developed land in this super-devel
oped Valley?
