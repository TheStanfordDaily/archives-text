## SFCU and Law School offer reduced-rate loans 
### Elisabeth Traugott Contributing writer 
A new loan program for Stanford law stu
dents that will offer as much as a 7 percent
reduction in guarantee fees over the nation
al average has been announced by its
cosponsors, Stanford Federal Credit Union
and Stanford Law School. Under the new
plan, loans of up to $15,000 annually will be
available immediately for both incoming
and continuing students.
The Stanford Law School Loan Program
is based on evidence which suggests that
Stanford law students have a far lower rate
of default on their loans than students at
other institutions. When all national law
schools are taken into account, one in 10 law
students is likely to default on a loan. At
Stanford only 0.7 percent of students, or
less than one in 100, fail to repay the money
they borrowed.
Law students have had a limited choice of
lending institutions when deciding how to
finance their education. According to Frank
Brucato, associate dean of administration at
the Law School, until now "current and past
students have been borrowing from two pri
vate sources for unsubsidized loans: Law
Loans and Law Access," which are both
loan-financing agencies.
These companies, because they deal with
students from almost every law school in the
country, charge high guarantee fees to de
flect the costs they incur when someone is
unable to pay them back. These fees can run
as high as 10 to 12 percent and penalize
those students who will eventually pay off
their loans, as this money is taken up front,
directly out of the check the student re
ceives.
The new initiative will reward Stanford
law students for their excellent credit histo
ries by only charging them a 4 percent guar

antee fee, which represents an immediate
and significant savings.
"For example, if someone were to borrow
$10,000, then they would save $700 on the
guarantee fees, at a time when they need the
money the most," Brucato said in describing
how the plan would look on paper.
It was originally planned that the Law
School would guarantee the loans in the
hopes of attracting large national banks, but
this plan was withdrawn after University of
ficials balked at the idea, Brucato said.
Warren Marshall, the president and CEO
of the credit union, is pleased about the "co
operative program" his institution will be
implementing in partnership with the Law
School. The credit union beat back stiff com
petition from commercial banks such as
Citibank, many of which are now interested
in the deal and may be offering similar pro
grams in the next few years.
For Marshall, it is a "win-win" scenario,
because he is keeping money circulating
within the larger Stanford community. He
said the program is possible because "we
have our eye on the Stanford community as
opposed to the national law school student
body."
The loans, which Marshall considers very
low risk because of the excellent default rate
of Stanford law students, will be made with
"Stanford community money, generated by
people who belong to the credit union." A
benefit will be passed along to credit union
members as their money will be invested lo
cally and safely.
Marshall said that under the program,
students will be given 12 years to pay off
their loans, but will be able to extend their
payback period to 20 years if necessary. He
gave the example of a $15,000 loan, which, if
amortized over a 20-year period, would
translate to payments of $132 per
month. The interest rate will be
slightly lower than the national
average — 3 percent while stu
dents are still in school — and will
be raised to 3.5 percent after grad
uation.
Marshall reported that over
200 students have called to re
quest applications since the plan
was announced last month.
John Ydirra, a business devel
opment associate at the credit
union, said the loans will be ad
ministered and dispersed from the
Tresidder Union branch, which is
close to the Law School. Student
loan applications will be sent first

to the Law School, where they will
be routed for approval and then
sent to the credit union. They will
then be assessed for "credit wor
thiness," Ydirra said.
Similar programs have not yet
been instituted for Stanford med
ical students or students at the
Graduate School of Business, al
though officials say that there is
growing interest.
For the 1995-96 academic year,
law school tuition was $22,350.
The average cost of room and
board was $9,000, and books were
an additional $1,100 if new. Fees
are expected to rise this year.
At least 75 percent of law stu
dents at Stanford receive some
form of financial assistance, either
in the form of fellowships or loans,
or both.
