### Jeremy Desmon Editorial staff 
Ed Zschau, Stanford alumnus and former
assistant professor at the Graduate School of
Business, was formally selected Monday as
the running mate for Reform Party presi
dential candidate Richard Lamm, who seeks
the Reform Party nomination against bil
lionaire Ross Perot.
Zschau, 56, a former Republican con
gressman in the 14th District, said he under
stands that he and Lamm are fighting an up
hill battle against Perot for the party nomi
nation in Long Beach on Aug. 18.
"If we can win against Ross Perot with all
the money he has put into promoting him
self, we certainly will have some momentum
going into the fall," Zschau said in a tele
phone interview yesterday.
"And," Zschau added, "it will be one of the
most dramatic political stories you'll see."
and Zschau are definitely the un
derdogs, as they are challenging Perot in the
party which Perot himself founded and fi
nanced after his unsuccessful run for the
presidency as an independent in 1992.
In a time of growing disaffection with the
two major parties, Republican Zschau and
Democrat Lamm form a unique ticket.
"There is a growing population looking for
fiscal conservatism, but who are moderate
in regards to social issues," Zschau said,
adding that he and Lamm are trying to
bring a "new agenda for the future of the
country."
"That's indicative of what the Reform
Party is all about," said Richard Verney, na
tional coordinator of the Reform Party. "It's
for people not happy with the choices of just
Republican or Democrat."

Zschau, a Los Altos resident, received his
master's degree, MBA and doctorate all from
Stanford in thel96os. After receiving his de
grees, Zschau served as assistant professor
in the Business School until 1969 and re
mained a lecturer in business policy until
1981. Along the way, he founded and became
CEO of System Industries, Inc., a Silicon
Valley computer products company.
In 1982, Zschau was elected to the first of
two terms in the U.S. House of Representa
tives, occupying the seat now taken by Rep.
Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto. While on Capitol
Hill, he was selected as "Rookie of the Year"
by the Washington Monthly in 1984.
Dick Daley, spokesman for Lamm's presi
dential campaign, said, "[Zschau] constantly
proved himself to be one of the brightest con
gressman on the Hill."
Zschau stepped out of the 1986 race to
run against then-Sen. Alan Cranston, losing
the election by less than 115,000 votes out of
the 7.1 million cast. He then dropped out of
the political spotlight, becoming a senior lec
turer of business administration at Harvard
University and working as general manager
of IBM's Storage Systems Division.
"When | Lamm] asked if I would accept his
offer, I was surprised," Zschau said. "Any
one would be surprised. Then I got to think
ing that this is a unique time in American
history. .. and that we could possibly change
the political landscape."
Until the nomination is announced,
Zschau and Lamm are on the campaign trail.
"We're doing what anyone would do: going
out, meeting the people and getting our mes
sage out any way that we can," Zschau said.
"No matter what happens," he added,
"this will certainly be an interesting couple
of weeks for me."
