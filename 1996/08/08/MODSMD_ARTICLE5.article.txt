# Physician argues against categorizing sexuality

A discussion of what's "natural" occu
pied the stage yesterday afternoon as Dr.
Lawrence Goldyn delivered a lecture titled
"Homosexuality and Modern Medicine: A
Century of Dis-ease" to a group of physi
cian assistant and nurse practitioner stu
dents at the Medical Center.
Goldyn, an AIDS physician in San Fran
cisco, argued that medicine has misper
ceived homosexuality by viewing it biologi
cally rather than culturally.
"An educated person needs basic biology
and basic anthropology," he said, adding
that doctors have the biological education
but lack background in anthropology,
which can sometimes lead to a biological in
terpretation of phenomena where a social
science perspective is more appropriate.
He argued that sexuality is determined
more by culture than by biology. "Human
sexuality is laden with consciousness and
symbols: fantasy, longing, wish, love," he
said.
Goldyn detailed the formation of med
ical attitudes toward homosexuals from
their antecedents in the Middle Ages
through modern times. He said when the
scientific approach to such problems over
took the religious one, the view of homo
sexuality as pathological remained. "These

(early medical) attitudes assumed the per
nicious nature of homosexuality," he said.
The oft-raised question of whether ho
mosexuality is "natural," he said, is irrele
vant because most human behavior is un
natural. He pointed to examples such as
croquet, ballet, tongue-piercing and foot
ball. "Twenty-two men running back and
forth on a field in these ridiculous outfits,
while teenagers jump up and down and
scream their heads off. Is this natural?" he
asked.
According to Goldyn, strict categoriza
tion of human sexuality is impossible due
to its complex nature. "I came to this with a
point of view that homosexuality was 'nat
ural,' " Goldyn said, adding that he now be
lieves such rigid definitions to be invalid.
He said that what an individual actually
does — his or her behavior — is more im
portant than how that person defines their
orientation.
Goldyn pointed to a study in which both
homosexuals and heterosexuals under
went a battery of personality tests. The re
sults were then interpreted by a group of
psychologists and psychiatrists, who were
unable to determine the sexual orientation
of the subjects. "Homosexuals are not iden
tifiable as a sub-population by personality
