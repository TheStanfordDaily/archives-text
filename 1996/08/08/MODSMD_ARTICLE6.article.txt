## Stanford awarded $200K grant NSF money to help design science courses for non-techies

The National Science Foundation recently award
ed Stanford a $200,000 grant to help design and offer
integrated science-math-engineering courses to non
science majors.
The grant came at a conference organized by the
National Science Foundation (NSF), the National
Research Council and the National Academy of Sci
ences (NAS), where recommendations were given to
teach science in a more approachable way, especially
to non-science majors.
"Science is often taught on display," said Ellen
Woods, assistant dean of undergraduate studies. "In
these new classes, students will be more involved,"
she said.
"The core classes will be taken by freshmen or
sophomores, and they extend over the entire school
year," said Biology Prof. Virginia Walbot, who serves
as a member of the design committee for the SME
classes. "They will learn the tools they can use in
later classes."
According to Walbot, each track will have a differ
ent main topic which students will study by applying
tools from math, natural sciences and engineering.
The classes are among the new general education re
quirements, or GERs, that will replace the old distri
bution requirement (DR) system.
"In the core classes, for weeks at a time the same
material will be taught, but from different angles,"
she said. "In traditional science classes students are
learning too many facts by memorizing. Here (in the
new classes) they will learn to evaluate and analyze,"
she added.
Jonathan Eisen, a member of the design commit
tee for the SME classes, said, "We did not want to
plan the entire classes, so we sent out a request for

proposals to the faculty members."
"Even people from the Medical School who never
dealt with non-science majors before are excited
about these classes and participate in teaching
them," he added.
"The faculty is having a blast," said Math Prof.
Brad Osgood, although "for some it is an add-on to
their previous teaching load." Osgood has spear
headed efforts over the past two years to restruc
ture the way science and engineering courses are
taught.
"NSF wanted to see that the University stands be
hind it and that it is not just an effort of some indi
vidual people. We got a lot of backing from the ad
ministration and the provost has acknowledged the
need for this program," Osgood said.
Because of the nationwide attention that this pro
ject draws, the documentation and evaluation during
and after the new classes is very important, according
to Osgood.
"I want to use the NSF money to hire a scientific
coordinator who will be a linkage to students and
help with the evaluation. Someone needs to write all
these things down. For the evaluation we will put to
gether a national advisory board including people
from Harvard and industry," Osgood said.
Curiously, these classes, which are intended to at
tract non-science majors, are most anticipated by sci
entists. "Non-science majors would rather avoid sci
ence altogether," Wood said.
Maybe this will change in a class where "the main
point is to catch people's interest," Osgood said.
In addition to the government, industry is very in
terested in this new approach. Hewlett Packard
Corp. has already given financial support, and a sub
stantial contribution will probably be donated from a
private source.
