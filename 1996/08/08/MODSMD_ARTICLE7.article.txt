Transplant patient dies
A 17-year-old teenager died last Thursday morning at
Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital after hours of
fighting lung infection following multiple heart and lung
transplant operations.
A few days before his death, John Sterling Luster had
become the first patient to receive two heart transplants
in one day at Stanford Medical Center.
There was some optimism about the teenager's
chance of recovery following the second operation as
Luster's condition steadily improved. However, any
hope was quickly erased as the boy's lungs became in
fected.
The 17-year-old underwent an eight-hour heart
transplant surgery lasting from late July 26 to the next
morning. However, Luster's lungs could not tolerate the
blood pressure being pumped by his new heart. His new
heart also began to weaken after his lungs started failing
and doctors put him on full life support.
In less than an hour, the heart and lungs of a 33-year
old man became available. Surgeons immediately re
moved the new heart and began a heart-lung transplant.
Luster was still in critical condition after the second
operation, but his condition began to improve. Six hours
after the operation, he was taken off the life support sys
tem. A hospital spokeswoman said last Wednesday after
noon that Luster was getting stronger.
After the two surgeries, the surgeons left a four-inch

wide incision in the boy's chest open for three days due
to swelling caused by the two operations. Doctors or
dered Luster's intensive care unit doors to be kept tight
ly closed at all times, knowing that the main threat to the
boy was bacteria.
Luster died on the morning of Aug. 1 after battling the
lung infection.

Housing lawsuit settled
Former Stanford basketball player Darren Allaway
and Tracy Pruitt, a former Stanford football player, have
agreed on a settlement in a housing discrimination law
suit in which the two students — both black — were al
legedly refused rental by the owners of an East Palo Alto
apartment because of their skin color.
The lawsuit originated in August 1994 when Allaway
and Pruitt — roommates seeking to move off campus —
were told over the telephone that apartments they had
seen advertised were available. When they visited the
rental site, however, they were told the apartments were
not available.
According to Winter Dellenbach of Midpeninsula Citi
zens for Fair Housing (MCFH) in Palo Alto, the students
became suspicious of racial motives and decided to contact
MCFH.
"Tracy Pruitt's girlfriend's mother had a complaint
about 15 years ago in this area and came to this office,"

Dellenbach said. "When Tracy told the girlfriend what
was going on, she knew where to go."
MCFH then conducted an investigation using both
black and white investigators. "It was interesting working
on this because we had our investigators going over there,
at times almost crossing paths with Darren and Tracy,"
Dellenbach said.
According to Dellenbach, at one point the apartment
manager was approached by a white investigator as All
away was walking away. The investigator was told by the
manager that she had had "negative experiences with col
oreds in the past."
Allaway, 23, and Pruitt, 22, were referred by MCFH to
local fair housing attorney D. Scott Chang, and a com
plaint was filed in federal court.
The terms of the settlement include an undisclosed
amount of monetary damages for Allaway and Pruitt and
a promise by the defendants to comply with all fair hous
ing laws, to take a fair housing training course, and to
keep and maintain rental records for compliance monitor
ing purposes for three years.
Dellenbach noted that MCFH "gets quite a few calls
from Stanford students" dealing with various housing
discrimination problems. "We get calls about race, gender,
non-married couples, faculty with children, everything,"
Dellenbach said.
"I'm incredibly happy that Tracy and Darren knew
who to come to," she added.
