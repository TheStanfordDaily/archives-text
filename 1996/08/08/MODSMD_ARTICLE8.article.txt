## Do you take this Church... Stanford's landmark is a 'wedding factory' 
### Elisabeth Traugott Contributing writer 
mily Post would have
€ I been proud. Every lily
stood brightly at atten
tion with its accompanying sprig
of baby's breath, the ushers were
clean-shaven and smartly attired
in black-tie, strains of Bach were
heard floating toward the highest
rafters of the church and the
brides looked radiant in white.
This is a typical Saturday at
Memorial Church, one of the Uni
versity's most beautiful and rec
ognized landmarks and the site of
an average of five weddings every
Saturday throughout the sum
mer.
"It is a sort of nondenomina
tional space. It serves as a com
mon ground space for couples
from different faiths and reli
gions," said Betsy Koester, the
wedding coordinator for the
church, as she described the build
ing's importance to the larger
Stanford community.
Koester has helped to organize

over 1,200 weddings during her
tenure as coordinator, a position
she has held since 1984. In her el
ement, she exudes the confidence
and organizational skills of a pro
fessional who in one day supervis
es anywhere from four to six of the
biggest days in anyone's life. It is a
job that requires diplomacy and
tact, as well as the ability to keep
different families and their re
spective ceremonies on a tight
schedule.
"Please clear the way. I'm
about to bring the bride through,"
she will ask of the errant
rollerblader and the gawking
tourist as a courtesy to the bridal
party. Within minutes, she whisks
a party of giggles, taffeta and tulle
up the front steps of the church as
the ushers rush around to the side
entrance to take their places up
front.
For Koester, herself a Stanford
graduate, it is a happy job, one she
thought she was well prepared for
when she read the dean of the
chapel's advertisement in 1984.
"They wished to have someone

who had a background in theolo
gy, and I had gone to seminary and
had worked for a long time in
Christian education, so I never
knew what it was like to have my
weekends free."
In order to be married in
Memorial Church, you must be a
current student, an alumnus, a
faculty or staff member at Stan
ford, or the son or daughter of any

of the above. There is a three
month waiting list, although "the
needs of the couple in terms of
booking a reception are about one
year in advance, especially for
summer weddings," according to
Koester.
Although she was unwilling to
name names, Koester did say that
the church has seen the blessing
of the marriages of well-know
sports personalities and of top ex
ecutives of Silicon Valley compa
nies. Anyone who plans to be mar
ried there must attend three one
hour sessions of premarital coun
seling offered by licensed mar
riage and family counselors.
Koester said that one of the
most interesting ceremonies ever
held in the church was a Tongan
wedding at which 500 guests, in
cluding the Prince of Tonga, were
in attendance, and Tapa cloths
were draped on the floor.
Since Memorial Church is non
denominational as decreed by its
benefactor, Jane Stanford, any
one who is eligible and wants to be
married in a religious ceremony
can do so, for a price. It costs
$1,000 to rent the church, or $700
if the bride or groom is a current
student. Over the years there
have been interfaith, Catholic,
Protestant and Islamic weddings,
to name a few. Civil ceremonies
are not allowed.
The natural accompaniment to
any wedding ceremony is music,
and at Memorial Church most opt
to have the magnificent chords "of
Stanford's famous organs sere
nade the guests and steady the
bride's pace as she proceeds down
the aisle.
Robert Bates, the university
organist, has made a tape of the

most common wedding anthems
which he gives to prospective cou
ples when they reserve the
church. He then recommends
soloists for vocal pieces and other
musicians, such as trumpet play
ers to embellish the Fisk-Nanney
or Murray Harris organs, which
he plays at most every ceremony.
The proverbial "our song" or
other special requests, if they
aren't classical in nature, are not
permitted in an attempt to pre
serve "a cathedral environment."
"We are not a parish church, so
we try to maintain tradition,"
Bates said.
When the Loma Prieta Earth
quake struck in 1989, Koester had
to make over 200 phone calls to
cancel reservations for the coming
year. Memorial Church ended up
being closed for three years due to
extensive damage to the structure
and the mosaics. Over $10 million
was donated in private funds to re
store the church, which was re
opened in 1992.
When asked whether in her
1,200-wedding career anyone had
ever been left waiting at the altar,
Koester claimed that it had never
once happened in Memorial
Church. It is a situation that is
common in the season finales of
sitcoms, but according to Koester
"is an urban myth — that has
never happened to us." She did
say that a groom once canceled his
wedding the week before.
And she is occasionally called
upon to steady the nerves of anx
ious brides or their mothers. "You
hope you are a calming influence,
that your experience gives some
comfort and assurance to people
that haven't had this experience
before."
