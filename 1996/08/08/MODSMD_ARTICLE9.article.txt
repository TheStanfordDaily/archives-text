# Martian expedition
## Stanford researchers help lead the research to determine whether life ever existed on Mars

M MkMorking in collaboration with NASA scientists,
UmmM Stanford researchers have discovered evi-
Jm mm dence that suggests microscopic life existed
on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago.
Studying the minerals on the surface of the tiny fis
sures in a Martian meteorite, scientists at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, Texas, found fossil-like struc
tures. In addition, the Stanford researchers uncovered
organic compounds that hint there was biological activ
ity early in the histoiy of Mars.
These organic molecules contained a mineral called
magnatite. The molecules are similar in their chemistry,
structure and shape to bacteria-produced particles
found on Earth; the oval and teardrop shapes resemble
mineral masses found in ancient bacteria sites in south
ern Italy.
The rock is the oldest of 12 Martian meteorites that
fell on Antarctica. Called the Allan Hills 84001, the me
teorite was discovered by the Viking Mars team in the
Allan Hills ice field. Research indicates that it formed
from molten rock more than 4.5 billion years ago. Scien
tists say it was blown into space when an asteroid struck
Mars about 15 million years ago, and it fell to Earth ap
proximately 13,000

years ago.
A laser technique called Microprobe Two-step Laser
Microscopy developed by Stanford Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare permitted the detection of polycyclic aro
matic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organic molecules that
suggest the earlier presence of microbiotic activity.
Along with Zare, Stanford researchers Simon Clemett,
Xavier Chillier and Claude Maechlin were involved with
the project, which will publish its findings in the Aug. 16
issue of the journal Science.
There are only "lines of evidence," however, that sug
gest primitive life, said JSC planetary scientist David
McKay. Taken individually, they do not provide conclu
sive information, the researchers said yesterday in a
press conference in Washington, D.C.
But McKay said that because the meteorite contained
calcium carbonate near the point of the fossil-like struc
tures and the mineralogy and chemistry of the meteorite
are compatible with biological origins, the evidence
pointed toward biological activity. "Collectively, because
they all occur within a small volume, this is evidence for
early life on Mars," McKay said.

ology at UCLA, said he had a feeling of "skep
tical fascination," and this evidence needed to
be treated as only a preliminary analysis.
JSC planetary scientist Everett Gibson
said when the fossil-like segmented struc
tures caught his attention, a chill went
through him. "I asked myself, 'Is this for
real?' " Gibson said.
"Just because there is organic matter
doesn't necessarily mean that it came from a
microbiotic origin," Schopf said. "PAHs can
come from interstellar origins, interplanetary
carbon gains and other non-biological
sources. We currently have no evidence of
their composition; we see no cell wall and no
evidence of cell division."
Also under question were the tempera
tures at which the PAHs formed. Previous ev
idence had suggested that the meteorite had
formed at temperatures of 450 degrees Cel
sius. Gibson argued that there is also strong
evidence that the isotopes form at 60 to 80 de
grees Celsius.
He added that the mineral composition in
the rock would be more homogenized if it had
formed at a higher temperature. He also
maintained that gregite, one of the minerals
found in the meteorite, would disintegrate at
temperatures higher than 250 degrees Cel
sius.
JSC planetary scientist Kathie Thomas-
Keprta said it was true the PAHs could be ex
plained by complicated inorganic processes,
but "the simple explanation is that they have
been produced by microorganisms," she said.
She added that this meteor was the cleanest

sample from Mars available for study. "It's
the best we have," she said.
"These are the first organic molecules we
believe you can attribute to Mars," Zare said.
"But finding organic molecules does not mean
they come from living things.... Rather, we
believe there was some biogenic activity on
Mars."
Finding organic clues
Chillier, a postdoctoral student from Stan
ford who worked on the project, said that it
was important to prove that the rock had not
been contaminated during its time on Earth.
Using the mass spectrometer, the instrument
used to carry out the laser microscopy, the
Stanford researchers were able to make pre
cise analyses of the mineral content of the me
teorite. They were looking to prove that the
minerals were part of the rock originally and
that they weren't from a source on Earth.
"We had especially high resolution and
were able to prove that the concentration of
PAHs increased, not decreased, as we moved
toward the center. This is not typical for a ter
restrial sample — it is too simple. I believe it is
extraterrestrial," Chillier said.
Graduate student Seb Gillete also worked
on the project under Zare. He explained the
process this way: "The mass spectrometer
heats the meteorite rapidly, sucking mole
cules off the surface until there is a cloud of
molecules. A second laser ionizes the mole
cules of a specific wavelength, and those PAHs
fly down a tube where we can measure their
speed and their weight."

Chillier said that although some PAHs are
not from microbiotic origin, those found in the
Martian rock appear to be of biological origin.
"There was more iron on these PAHs, and it
corresponds exactly to the spot where we
found the fossils," Chillier said.
Additional research will be done at Stan
ford, where Chillier said they are looking for
amino acids in the sample, which would be a
much more definitive sign of life. "If the bio
logical activity is similar to Earth's, then
amino acids are the most important mole
cules," Chillier said.
Where do we go from here?
The thought that primitive life existed on
Mars has raised hopes of increased space re
search. NASA administrator Daniel Goldin
said the evidence "will definitely open more
scientific discussion," but he added that re
search should be driven by scientific opportu
nities.
"We're planning to take the time to inves
tigate and validate this discovery. This is a
world-wide mission and we will need world
space leadership," Goldin said at the press
conference.
He mentioned the Origins Program, which
discusses the possibility that life is not unique
to Earth. The program seeks to directly detect
oxygen on other planets.

"We are skeptical but thrilled and
humbled by the prospect that life ex

isted on Mars," Goldin said.
An upcoming NASA
Pathfinder mission to Mars in

November will not
be altered be
cause of this a

new evidence. In addition, Vice President A 1
Gore is planning to call a space summit in No
vember.
Goldin said one possible future landing site
is already being considered and that it
"couldn't be better" for research on primitive
life.
"It looks like it is at the mouth of a runoff
channel, with rocks and samples in the bed. It
may be an ancient lake bed. We will have a
micro rover, or have a simple chemical rover,
to search for the potential of early life. Once
we have better pictures, there will be potential
evidence for microbiotic life and geological
mapping."
He also added that a human expedition to
Mars has not been ruled out.
Zare added, however, that "science and
technology need to work together. It's very

important that this country keep its
sense of exploration. There are

new worlds to explore, and

nations that lose their
sense of exploration

are doomed to
failure."

How microprobe two-step laser microscopy works to detect organic compunds:
Step 1: The pulsed infrared laser heats a tiny sample of meteorite, the size of the period at the
end of this sentence. Molecules vaporize from the surface and spread in a plume within the
vacuum chamber.
Step 2: The second laser, a pulsed ultraviolet laser, ionizes some of the molecules in the
plume. For this experiment, the UV laser was tuned to ionize only a family of molecules called
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. Other molecules are unaffected.
Step 3: lonization gives the particles a positive charge: They flow in an electric field toward a
detector, which can distinguish different types of PAHs from one another by their speed of
travel — heavy PAHs travel more slowly than light ones.

conference.
He mentioned the Origins Program, which

oxygen on other planets.

Goldin said one possible future landing site
is already being considered and that it
"couldn't be better" for research on primitive
life.
"It looks like it is at the mouth of a runoff
channel, with rocks and samples in the bed. It
may be an ancient lake bed. We will have a
micro rover, or have a simple chemical rover,
to search for the potential of early life. Once
we have better pictures, there will be potential
evidence for microbiotic life and geological
mapping."
He also added that a human expedition to
Mars has not been ruled out.
Zare added, however, that "science and
technology need to work together. It's very

important that this country keep its
sense of exploration. There are

new worlds to explore, and

nations that lose their
sense of exploration

are doomed to
failure."

How microprobe two-step laser microscopy works to detect organic compunds:
Step 1: The pulsed infrared laser heats a tiny sample of meteorite, the size of the period at the
end of this sentence. Molecules vaporize from the surface and spread in a plume within the
vacuum chamber.
Step 2: The second laser, a pulsed ultraviolet laser, ionizes some of the molecules in the
plume. For this experiment, the UV laser was tuned to ionize only a family of molecules called
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. Other molecules are unaffected.
Step 3: lonization gives the particles a positive charge: They flow in an electric field toward a
detector, which can distinguish different types of PAHs from one another by their speed of
travel — heavy PAHs travel more slowly than light ones.

M MkMorking in collaboration with NASA scientists,
UmmM Stanford researchers have discovered evi-
Jm mm dence that suggests microscopic life existed
on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago.
Studying the minerals on the surface of the tiny fis
sures in a Martian meteorite, scientists at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, Texas, found fossil-like struc
tures. In addition, the Stanford researchers uncovered
organic compounds that hint there was biological activ
ity early in the histoiy of Mars.
These organic molecules contained a mineral called
magnatite. The molecules are similar in their chemistry,
structure and shape to bacteria-produced particles
found on Earth; the oval and teardrop shapes resemble
mineral masses found in ancient bacteria sites in south
ern Italy.
The rock is the oldest of 12 Martian meteorites that
fell on Antarctica. Called the Allan Hills 84001, the me
teorite was discovered by the Viking Mars team in the
Allan Hills ice field. Research indicates that it formed
from molten rock more than 4.5 billion years ago. Scien
tists say it was blown into space when an asteroid struck
Mars about 15 million years ago, and it fell to Earth ap
proximately 13,000

years ago.
A laser technique called Microprobe Two-step Laser
Microscopy developed by Stanford Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare permitted the detection of polycyclic aro
matic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organic molecules that
suggest the earlier presence of microbiotic activity.
Along with Zare, Stanford researchers Simon Clemett,
Xavier Chillier and Claude Maechlin were involved with
the project, which will publish its findings in the Aug. 16
issue of the journal Science.
There are only "lines of evidence," however, that sug
gest primitive life, said JSC planetary scientist David
McKay. Taken individually, they do not provide conclu
sive information, the researchers said yesterday in a
press conference in Washington, D.C.
But McKay said that because the meteorite contained
calcium carbonate near the point of the fossil-like struc
tures and the mineralogy and chemistry of the meteorite
are compatible with biological origins, the evidence
pointed toward biological activity. "Collectively, because
they all occur within a small volume, this is evidence for
early life on Mars," McKay said.
Gathering consensus

simple lifeforms may have existed on the red planet.

ology at UCLA, said he had a feeling of "skep
tical fascination," and this evidence needed to
be treated as only a preliminary analysis.
JSC planetary scientist Everett Gibson
said when the fossil-like segmented struc
tures caught his attention, a chill went
through him. "I asked myself, 'Is this for
real?' " Gibson said.
"Just because there is organic matter
doesn't necessarily mean that it came from a
microbiotic origin," Schopf said. "PAHs can
come from interstellar origins, interplanetary
carbon gains and other non-biological
sources. We currently have no evidence of
their composition; we see no cell wall and no
evidence of cell division."
Also under question were the tempera
tures at which the PAHs formed. Previous ev
idence had suggested that the meteorite had
formed at temperatures of 450 degrees Cel
sius. Gibson argued that there is also strong
evidence that the isotopes form at 60 to 80 de
grees Celsius.
He added that the mineral composition in
the rock would be more homogenized if it had
formed at a higher temperature. He also
maintained that gregite, one of the minerals
found in the meteorite, would disintegrate at
temperatures higher than 250 degrees Cel
sius.
JSC planetary scientist Kathie Thomas-
Keprta said it was true the PAHs could be ex
plained by complicated inorganic processes,
but "the simple explanation is that they have
been produced by microorganisms," she said.
She added that this meteor was the cleanest

sample from Mars available for study. "It's
the best we have," she said.
"These are the first organic molecules we
believe you can attribute to Mars," Zare said.
"But finding organic molecules does not mean
they come from living things.... Rather, we
believe there was some biogenic activity on
Mars."
Finding organic clues
Chillier, a postdoctoral student from Stan
ford who worked on the project, said that it
was important to prove that the rock had not
been contaminated during its time on Earth.
Using the mass spectrometer, the instrument
used to carry out the laser microscopy, the
Stanford researchers were able to make pre
cise analyses of the mineral content of the me
teorite. They were looking to prove that the
minerals were part of the rock originally and
that they weren't from a source on Earth.
"We had especially high resolution and
were able to prove that the concentration of
PAHs increased, not decreased, as we moved
toward the center. This is not typical for a ter
restrial sample — it is too simple. I believe it is
extraterrestrial," Chillier said.
Graduate student Seb Gillete also worked
on the project under Zare. He explained the
process this way: "The mass spectrometer
heats the meteorite rapidly, sucking mole
cules off the surface until there is a cloud of
molecules. A second laser ionizes the mole
cules of a specific wavelength, and those PAHs
fly down a tube where we can measure their
speed and their weight."

Chillier said that although some PAHs are
not from microbiotic origin, those found in the
Martian rock appear to be of biological origin.
"There was more iron on these PAHs, and it
corresponds exactly to the spot where we
found the fossils," Chillier said.
Additional research will be done at Stan
ford, where Chillier said they are looking for
amino acids in the sample, which would be a
much more definitive sign of life. "If the bio
logical activity is similar to Earth's, then
amino acids are the most important mole
cules," Chillier said.
Where do we go from here?
The thought that primitive life existed on
Mars has raised hopes of increased space re
search. NASA administrator Daniel Goldin
said the evidence "will definitely open more
scientific discussion," but he added that re
search should be driven by scientific opportu
nities.
"We're planning to take the time to inves
tigate and validate this discovery. This is a
world-wide mission and we will need world
space leadership," Goldin said at the press
conference.
He mentioned the Origins Program, which
discusses the possibility that life is not unique
to Earth. The program seeks to directly detect
oxygen on other planets.

"We are skeptical but thrilled and
humbled by the prospect that life ex

isted on Mars," Goldin said.
An upcoming NASA
Pathfinder mission to Mars in

November will not
be altered be
cause of this a

new evidence. In addition, Vice President A 1
Gore is planning to call a space summit in No
vember.
Goldin said one possible future landing site
is already being considered and that it
"couldn't be better" for research on primitive
life.
"It looks like it is at the mouth of a runoff
channel, with rocks and samples in the bed. It
may be an ancient lake bed. We will have a
micro rover, or have a simple chemical rover,
to search for the potential of early life. Once
we have better pictures, there will be potential
evidence for microbiotic life and geological
mapping."
He also added that a human expedition to
Mars has not been ruled out.

technology need to work together. It's very

important that this country keep its
sense of exploration. There are

nations that lose their
