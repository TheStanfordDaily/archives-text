UmmM Stanford researchers have discovered evi-
Jm mm dence that suggests microscopic life existed
on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago.
Studying the minerals on the surface of the tiny fis
sures in a Martian meteorite, scientists at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, Texas, found fossil-like struc
tures. In addition, the Stanford researchers uncovered
organic compounds that hint there was biological activ
ity early in the histoiy of Mars.
These organic molecules contained a mineral called
magnatite. The molecules are similar in their chemistry,
structure and shape to bacteria-produced particles
found on Earth; the oval and teardrop shapes resemble
mineral masses found in ancient bacteria sites in south
ern Italy.
The rock is the oldest of 12 Martian meteorites that
fell on Antarctica. Called the Allan Hills 84001, the me
teorite was discovered by the Viking Mars team in the
Allan Hills ice field. Research indicates that it formed
from molten rock more than 4.5 billion years ago. Scien
tists say it was blown into space when an asteroid struck
Mars about 15 million years ago, and it fell to Earth ap
proximately 13,000

years ago.
A laser technique called Microprobe Two-step Laser
Microscopy developed by Stanford Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare permitted the detection of polycyclic aro
matic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organic molecules that
suggest the earlier presence of microbiotic activity.
Along with Zare, Stanford researchers Simon Clemett,
Xavier Chillier and Claude Maechlin were involved with
the project, which will publish its findings in the Aug. 16
issue of the journal Science.
There are only "lines of evidence," however, that sug
gest primitive life, said JSC planetary scientist David
McKay. Taken individually, they do not provide conclu
sive information, the researchers said yesterday in a
press conference in Washington, D.C.
But McKay said that because the meteorite contained
calcium carbonate near the point of the fossil-like struc
tures and the mineralogy and chemistry of the meteorite
are compatible with biological origins, the evidence
pointed toward biological activity. "Collectively, because
they all occur within a small volume, this is evidence for
early life on Mars," McKay said.

At 4.5 billion years old, the meteorite Allan Hills 84001 is thought to
have once been part of Mars and to contain evidence that ancient,
simple lifeforms may have existed on the red planet.
