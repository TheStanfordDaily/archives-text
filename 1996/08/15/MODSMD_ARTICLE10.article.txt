# MARC WAIS:
## Reflections on his freshman year as Stanford's new dean of students 
### Michael Harville 
In the heart of the summer, while
the attention of most Stanford
students is diverted from cam
pus life, one might think that dean
of students Marc Wais, after nearly
11 eventful months on his new job,
might finally be able to relax. Hut
one trip to Wais' new home, the res
ident fellow quarters at Junipero
House in Wilbur Hall, will quickly
dispel any such notion.
Boxes, furniture and appliances
are piled everywhere inside the
small house and its patio. Amid the
debris, two blonde tornadoes
named Ashleigh, 4, and Jennifer, 2,
whirl with energy far beyond the
imagination of the special-effects
wizards of "Twister." Outside the
wooden picket fence surrounding
the quarters, dorms full of teens on
campus for cheerleading, soccer
and other summer camps blast
their stereos, ogle each other, and
(mistakenly) steal Wais' Sunday
paper.
Wais and his wife, Sue, do not
normally live in such disarray. The
reason for (he mess is that they
have just finished packing all of
their belongings and moving them
to Junipero over the weekend. The
RF quarters are significantly
smaller than their previous resi
dence, so the struggle to cram

everything in, while keeping an eye
on their daughters and missing
most of the (Mympics, has made the
moving experience rather unpleas
ant.
"Actually, it's been hell," Wai.«
clarified.
But his smile belies his true atti
tude toward his new home: eager
anticipation.
"I'm excited about living in an
all-freshmen hall, and I'm excited
about impacting (the students] in a
positive way," Wais said. His family
shares his enthusiasm. He added,
"I keep telling my (wo daughters
that they're going to have 9-1 big
brothers and sisters soon, and they
can't wait!"
Wais explains that, although
Sue often jokes that his main moti
vation for moving to Wilbur is his
love of cafeteria food, he is in large
part just trying to do his job better.
"As dean of students, I've tried
to Ik* visible, to go to ;ls many stu
dent activities as possible, and to be
very approachable and accessible.
Really, I'm trying, at the bottom
line, to be helpful to students. I'm
hoping to improve on this by be
coming a resident fellow, which
should give mea better sense of stu
dent happenings and of t he pulse of
camDus life."

No more "us versus them"
Since last September, when he
filled the vacancy left by former
dean of students Michael Jackson,
Wais has already sensed, and often
quickened, the pulse of campus life
in a wide variety of contexts. Such
involvement goes with the territory
of his job.
His responsibilities as dean of
students include oversight of the
four ethnic community centers (El
Centro Chicano, the Black Com
munity Services Center, the Asian
American Activities Center and the
American Indian Program) and the
other four community centers (the
Women's Center, the Bechtel In
ternational Center, the Disability
Resource Center and the Lesbian,
Gay, and Bisexual Community
Center). His authority also extends
over the Office of Student Activi
ties, which deals with all fraterni
ties and sororities, provides admin
istrative support for the ASSU, and
aids nearly 500 other student orga
nizations and activities.
The development of Tresidder
Memorial Union falls under his
purview, as does New Student Ori
entation. The judicial affairs officer
(who handles I lonor Code and Fun
damental Standard violations), the
multicultural educator, and the

meeting services coordinator also
report to him.
In reflecting on his performance
during his first year on the job,
Wais emphasizes his efforts to im
prove student perception of his of
fice.
" I th ink we've done a lot to break
down the 'us versus them,' or the
'students versus the University,'
mentality that some people have,"
Wais explained. "We're trying to
put a face on Stanford, so that stu
dents can identify with the Univer
sity administration as people in
stead of as some monolithic institu
tion. We would like to demonstrate
t hat the University cares about stu
dents both in and out of the class
room.
"Stanford provides a world-class
education, and we want the overall
Stanford experience to match that.
We want to do whatever we can to
support student activities and pro
grams, and we hope to be recog
nized as a problem solver that stu
dents can come to."
Wais has taken a number of ac
tions toward achieving all of this.
He has required all areas under
him, such as the various communi
ty centers and the New Student
Orientation office, to develop "stu
dent satisfaction surveys," some of
which were implemented last
spring. In addition, he initiated the
production of an annual, compre
hensive dean of students report
which will explain, according to
Wais, "who we are and what we
do." The first report is due to circu
late this September.
Working with students
Last fall, Daily reporter Kyle
Graham asked Wais why he didn't
have office hours for students.
"I thought students would just
know that I'm always here for them
and that they can drop in any time,
but Kyle pointed out that some peo
ple might be apprehensive about
coming to me without an appoint
ment. So I established permanent
office hours for students, every
Monday from 4 to 5 p.m. and
Wednesday from 12 to 1 p.m."
But Wais does not simply wait
for students to come to him. "I've
made a very concerted effort to
meet with as many student groups
as possible," he explains.
One manner by which he has
done this is to host student groups
at his home in the evening. "We had
a night for all of the ethnic commu

nity centers, another for the vari
ous media organizations and om
for all of Greek life. We also had t In
ASSU come over one evening, ant
we've hosted all of the other com
muni ty centers."
His meetings with these variou:
groups have greatly helped Wais t<

recognize many student problem.'
and to begin to address them. Foi
instance, in response to studenl
complaints about the lack of fooc
alternatives on campus, Wais ha*
worked hard on a plan "to reconfig
ure Tresidder Union and make it
more of a hub of campus life."
"Among other things," Waif
said, "we're going to fund a major
upgrade of the Bon Appetit facili
ties at Tresidder, Polio's restau
rant will be coming in, and we're
going to bring in a juice club."
When he met with the ASSU

Senate last October, concerns were
voiced about the slowness and the
lack of student involvement in the
judicial affairs system. In response,
Wais' office has already made a
number of changes to the system,
and he will release a report with
further recommendations this fall.
"Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard cases have been adjudi
cated in a much more timely fash
ion this last year than in the recent
past — and we have the data to back
that up. I think we're well on the
way to providing a more fair and
open judgment process as well."
Wais also took the time last Jan
uary to meet with the Working
Group on Lesbian, Gay, and Bisex
ual Student Needs to allow them to
respond to a report produced by his
office just before his tenure began.
Troy Gilbert, an adviser to the Les
bian, Gay, and Bisexual Communi
ty Center (LGBCC), praised Wais'
efforts in addressing issues raised
by the group.
"Marc has been very supportive
of the gay community and very sen
sitive to its needs," said Gilbert.
"He has done a lot in helping the
LGBCC to secure additional re
sources and funding for next year."
Wais has exhibited similar sup
port for other campus communi
ties. He has worked to increase of
ferings of women's self-defense
classes, and he has helped to pro
vide funds for additional staffing
and programming at the Women's
Center. He has increased staff at
the Disability Resource Center and
is working to obtain more space for
the center. He has also tried to help
the Bechtel International Center

deal with the increasingly complex
guidelines dealt to them by the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
Wais is further pleased to report
that, during the past year, "all of
the ethnic community centers have
thrived in promoting and providing
activities, especially in terms of
their recruitment and retention of
student interest." He added,
"There has been a significant in
crease in these groups' connection
to the academe, through programs
like Partners in Academic Excel
lence, the Chicano Fellowship Pro
gram, and the new Native Ameri
can Graduate Research Day."
Another major focus for the
dean of students has been graduate
student life. "A stated goal for the
entire branch of the University ad
ministration under the vice
provost for student affairs IMary
Edmonds] is to work more closely
with graduate students," Wais
said. "I've been meetingoneon one,
once per quarter, with representa
tives from all schools who work pri
marily with graduate students, just
to discuss issues affecting graduate
students."
"We have been talking about
ways to better enable graduate stu
dents from different disciplines to
interact with each other, both so
cially and academically, and for
ways to better engage them in Uni
versity life," Wais explained.
Specifically, Wais is considering or
ganizing an on-campus mixer for
all graduate students, and he is at
tempting to provide a forum in
which graduate students can pre
sent their research to a broader au

dience than just their own depart
ment.
Baptism by fire
While Wais' first year at Stan
ford has brought many positive
changes, it has not been without its
unpleasant moments. On his
eighth day on the job, he and Resi
dential Education Director Jane
Camarillo made the controversial
decision to evict the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity from its campus
house.
"I was thrown into the fire
early," recalls Wais, "but the case
for eviction was very compelling,
primarily because of poor manage
ment of the fraternity from both a
fiscal and a behavioral standpoint.
However, we're hoping tr work
with the fraternity to get them back
into good standing and possibly
back into their house." Wais hopes
that the incident "can become a
positive thing for the fraternity, by
helping them begin to turn things
around and have a fresh start."
Mark Lippert, who had just be
come president of the fraternity
when the eviction took place, con
curred with Wais.
"It was pretty clear that we had
violated our probation," Lippert
said. "Marc tried to be really fair, he
tried to take a long, hard look at the
situation, and he gave us a chance
to respond. It was really a case of
himbeingdealtabad hand, of walk
ing into mess, and he did what was
appropriate."
In February, Wais was forced to
deal with a shooting incident that
occurred at a sorority-sponsored

party at Tresidder. All of the people
involved in the shooting were unaf
filiated with Stanford. New party
planning guidelines, to be articulat
ed this fall, are a direct result of the
incident, Wais noted.
Campus life was severely dis
turbed again in April, when racist
graffiti was found on the Asian
American Activities Center. Wais
wrote an editorial to The Daily, ex
claiming his outrage at the act and
his commitment to eradicate such
behavior. He also increased securi
ty around the center.
Despite these incidents, Wais
has been thrilled by his experience
at Stanford so far. He fondly recalls
last year's new student orientation,
when he was impressed by the a
cappella performance at Memorial
Auditorium, was moved by the
"Faces of Community" program,
and watched the band jump into
the pool at MuFuUnSun. He also
enjoyed attending Big Game and
Gaieties, the Commencement cere
mony, and many other major cam
pus events.
"It all highlights the tremen
dous talent, diversity, creativity
and energy of the student body," he
explained. He sees the same quali
ties in his interactions with stu
dents on the job. "In my meetings
with student leaders, I've been
struck by how bright and impas
sioned they are about their organi
zations, and by their commitment
to helping others both here and off
campus."

More than a job
"The quality
of the staff that I
work with is
amazing, and it
is reassuring to
know that I have
good people
working around
me and in relat
ed offices," said
Wais. "I'm also
lucky that Vice
Provost Mary
Edmonds and I
have been very
much philosoph
ically in synch,
and that extends
all the way up to
President
Casper. The
president has
been very sup
portive of what
we've done in
Student Affairs,
and I'm very ap
preciative of
this."
"When I go to
work," Wais
added, "I don't
look at it as a job,
but as a day of
fun activities."
Wais' enthu
siasm for his
work is apparent
to his family as
well. His wife
Sue, who pur
sued a career
similar to her
husband's until
devoting full
time to care of
their children,
noted that "he is

certainly very busy, but he's defi
nitely happier in this job than in
any of his previous ones."
Before coming to Stanford, Wais
was assistant vice provost for Stu
dent Affairs at the University of
Maryland at Baltimore. The school
is primarily a graduate institution,
and Wais commented that "one of
the reasons I wanted to come to

'We're trying to put a
face on Stanford, so
that students can iden
tify with the University
administration as peo
ple instead of as some
monolithic institution.'

Stanford was because of residential
flavor, and its nice blend of under
graduate and graduate students."
Wais was also dean of students
at his alma mater, Fairleigh Dickin
son University in New Jersey,
where, as an undergraduate, he
had been a resident assistant and
editor in chief of the school newspa
per. In addition, he has held posi
tions at George Washington Uni
versity, the University of Miami
and Harvard, where he met his wife
and earned a doctorate in adminis
trative planning and social policy.
