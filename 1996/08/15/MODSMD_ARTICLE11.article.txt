## Frost Amphitheater heats up with KFOG 
### Liz Chien Staff writer 
Along with the anticipated
summer break comes a real dearth
of activities on campus. However,
this weekend, campus will be filled
with fun, laughter and most im
portantly, lots of MUSIC! On Au
gust 17, the first annual KFOG
summer picnic will be coming to
Frost Amphitheater.
The outdoor concert will show
case the Brian Setzer Orchestra,
Linda Perry, the Samples and Box
Set. Originally named KFOG's
Cheap Concert, the $ 10 per person
ticket price is sure to guarantee
that everyone will have a raucous,
entertaining time, and still have
enough dinero left over for an ice
cream cone afterwards.
In conjunction with the Stan
ford Concert Network, the KFOG
Summer Picnic is a festival type
event featuring live music and a
picnic area where people can
"walk away from the music and
have a conversation in a fun at
mosphere," said Jude Heller,
KFOG's Director of Marketing.
"We wanted to do an event for our
South Bay listeners that promotes
meeting new people," explained
Heller.

Hearing from listeners that en
tertainment was becoming very
expensive, KFOG decided to put
on an event that would fulfill their
listeners' requests while con
tributing to the community. More
than providing live music for
South Bay music lovers, this non
profit event also raises money for
Challenge for Charity, a Stanford
organization that benefits the
Northern California Special
Olympics. "We have an employee
at KFOG who competes in the
Special Olympics, so we know that
it is definitely a charity worth sup
porting," said Heller.
The concert will start at ap
proximately 5 p.m. with Box Set,
one of the Bay Area's most popu
lar unsigned bands. This alterna
tive folk duo will assuredly delight
many with their acoustic guitar
based rhythmic sounds. The so
phisticated layout of the concert is
illustrated by the short intermis
sion periods between the bands.
"All equipment is set up front to
back, so the Samples' gear will be
behind Box Set's. This way, the
show will run right on schedule,"
said Heller. Platinum-record sell
ing artist Linda Perry, formerly of
the 4 Non Blondes, will perform
right after the Samples, and the

headlining band, The Brian Setzer
Orchestra is slated last.
The Brian Setzer Orchestra is a
seventeen piece big band complete
with five saxophones, piano, bass
guitar, drums and Brian Setzer
himself on electric guitar. Former
ly of the Stray Cats, a three piece
band, Setzer took the big band
concept and made it into modern
rock music. Heller comments that
the Brian Setzer Orchestra "is un
doubtedly the coolest thing that
has happened to big band music.
Every show in the Bay Area has
been sold out."
The station decided that Frost
Amphitheater would be the ideal
venue for the first ever KFOG
Summer Picnic due to the seating
capacity and the casual atmos
phere. "It's all grass," Heller
added. "We wanted to start small
and build. Even though Frost has
a 9,000 seating capacity, there are
only 7,000 tickets being offered,
because we want people to be com
fortable and enjoy the show."
This is the first joint event of
KFOG and the Stanford Concert
Network and is sure to entertain
many, while contributing to chari
ty. Gates open at 3:30 p.m. and set
changes will be no more than a
half-hour.
