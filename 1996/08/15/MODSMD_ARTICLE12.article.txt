# BOOTH AND THE BAD ANGEL
## 
### 
The press release for the self
titled release of Booth and the
Bad Angel reads like a an adver
tisement for the Psychic Friends
Network. "Tim (Booth, lead
singer of James) was told by a
clairvoyant that his career would
leap creatively skyward if he col
laborated with 'a man with the
name of an angel,"' it reads.
Judging the album by this, and
its ridiculous looking cover, any
numskull could figure out that
dialing I-800-BOOTH AND
THE BAD ANGEL was the same
as dialing 1-800-GET GYPED.
But the caveat — "Don't judge
a book by its cover" — rang
through my head, and I decided
to give the album a try. Fortu
nately, this album, a collabora
tion effort by Booth and 50 year

old Angelo Badalementi, who
scored the TV series "Twin
Peaks" and "Wild at Heart," was
well worth my time. It is one of
Booth's best efforts of his career.
The contrasting musical
styles of lead singer Booth and
the keyboardist, Badalementi,
make for a perfect combination.
Booth is the unmitigated happy
go-lucky camper, while Badala
menti is known for his musically
dark nature.
The result of this amalgama
tion is a musical metamorphosis
for the normally peppy, upbeat
Booth. For instance, on "The
Dance of Bad Angels," Badala
menti's dark, desolate musical
landscape is a perfect entry point
for Booth's new found talent —
soft, brooding vocals.
One of the best things about
the album is Booth's control and
discipline. Paced by Badalamen
ti's sparse, yet provocative beats,
Booth refrains from bursting
forth with his usual earth-shat

tering choruses on "Butterfly's
Dream," a pensive meditation on
love.
Nevertheless, traces of James
are still apparent on the album.
For example, on "Heart" ener
getic, driving guitars and drums
propel Booth's airy, charming
vocals.
This album offers musical
highs with its soft pop songs
packed with hooks and charming
melodies. The result of a hokey
clairvoyant's prophesy to couple
Booth with the bad angel,
Badalamenti has definitely
turned a new leaf in Booth's ca
reer.
