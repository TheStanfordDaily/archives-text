# PRIMITIVE RADIO GODS
## Rocket 
### 
The Primitive Radio Gods are a
classic example of the one-hit
wonder. For a while now, the Gods
have been coasting on the success
of the single "Standing Outside A
Broken Phone Booth With Money
In My Hand," a moody, wistful,
U2-ish tune set to a sublimely
groovy drum track, sparse New
Age synth tones, some piano
noodling, and the really clever use
of a 8.8. King sample.

There's also the unlikely suc
cess story of Chris O'Connor, for
mer air traffic controller and the
sole member of Primitive Radio
Gods, who wrote "Standing Out
side A Broken Phone Booth" two
years ago but couldn't find anyone
interested in it at the time. So the
future MTV and radio hit lan
guished in O'Connor's closet until
this year, when he sent out demo
tapes on a whim and, incredibly
enough, got signed to Columbia
Records.
Beyond that, the usual warning
signs of one-hit wonderdom begin
to rear their ugly heads: No fol
low-up single has yet to be re
leased, and record stores are
slashing the price of "Rocket", the

Primitive Radio Gods' first full
length album. Think about it: why
would stores want to put "Rocket"
on sale unless they wanted to get
rid of their copies while "Stand
ing..." was still popular?
Actually listening to the rest of
"Rocket" betrays the ugly truth
that the Primitive Radio Gods, for
the most part, sound like a 90's
version of Duran Duran: mid-80's
post-new-wave glam-synth-rock
filtered through a post-punk gui
tar mentality. It's what Nine Inch
Nails might have become if Trent
Reznor liked Poison. It's what
Motley Crue would be doing if
they bought a drum machine.
What an awful thought.
Outside of "Standing Outside A

Broken Phone Booth", the Gods
try to "rock out" and muster up
some sort of bad-ass swagger with
cocksucker guitar riffage and un
forgivably stupid lyrics. Between
O'Connor's soulless vocals and
the sterile everything-played-on
a-synthesizer production, it's
hard to find anything on "Rocket"
that doesn't suck. "Women"
works a pretty good dance-glam
vibe, but tracks like "Motherfuck
er," "Who Say" and "Are You
Happy" should have stayed in
O'Connor's closet. The Primitive
Radio Gods completely fail to de
liver the cool transcendence that
their single promised.
