# Mr. T: A local punk band with experience
## 
### Patrick Enright 
Over the past ten years, the San
Francisco Bay Area has been home
to hundreds of punk bands, the
most successful of which, like Jaw
breaker and the all-too-frequently
mentioned Green Day, have drawn
national attention to the Bay Area
punk scene. One band which has
been here playing shows since the
very beginning is The Mr. T Expe
rience.
Formed in the mid-80s as a reac
tion to an extremely political punk
movement, The Mr. T Experience
has always been"the oddball
band," according to lead guitarist,
singer and songwriter Dr. Frank.
In order to distinguish themselves
from "bands where all the songs
were about Reagan and
Nicaragua," the band began writ
ing melodic and catchy pop tunes
about love and breakups.
In the process of "trying to irri
tate people [in the serious punk
scene] by playing pop songs," The
Mr. T Experience became a Bay
Area staple, find soon signed with
Lookout! Records, the most well
known local record company.
After releasing their first

album, "Everyone's Entitled To
Their Own Opinion," the band con
tinued playing shows around the
Bay Area, including appearances
on KZSU's Wednesday Night Live,
and managed to record five other
albums. In the past decade, they
have toured the U.S. several times,
visited Europe and gone on a recent
tour ofJapan.
They have gone through many
personnel changes between
"Everyone's Entitled" and their
most recent release, but the theme
of disfunctional relationships stuck
with them. Citing country music
and show tunes as lyrical influ
ences, Dr. Frank explains that "the
songs that always hit me the hard
est are the ones about love gone
awry "
One of Dr. Frank's favorite
quotes best sums up The Mr. T Ex
perience's perspective: "Love Ls like
oxygen/you get too much, you get
too high/not enough and you're
gonna die."
While Dr. Frank has been the
backbone of The Mr. T Experience
for ten years, Joel (bass and vocals)
and Jym (drums) joined the band
very recently, in 1994. Joel, the
youngest member by almost ten

years, grew up listening to The Mr.
T Experience and names them as
his greatest musical influence. Jym
is, as Dr. Frank describes, "a more
solid rock 'n' roll drummer [than
previous drummers). That makes a
di (Terence."
Although they have recorded a
total of six full-length albums and
several EPs, The Mr. T Experi
ence's recent LP "Love Is Dead" is
perhaps the best of the bunch.
"'Love Is Dead' came out like the
others should have," Dr. Frank
says. On earlier albums there was
"no time and no money to correct
mistakes." The result is an amaz
ing 36-minute, 16-song trip
through a world of infatuation,
heartache and twisted relation
ships.
Perhaps the most distinctive
feature of The Mr. T Experience's
music is their self-deprecating and
peculiar sense of humor, conspicu
ous in songs like "I Ixive You, But
You're Standing On My Foot,"
"I'm Like Yeah, But She's All No,"
and "Even Hitler Had A Girl
friend." As Dr. Frank proclaims, "if
The Mr. T Experience is your fa
vorite band, it's because you have a
perverse streak."

It is this approach that has
earned them a prime spot in the
Bay Area music scene. Now that
the fifteen minutes of fame Green
Day brought to the Bay Area are
fading, is it time to light a candle in
memory of local punk rock? "You
could make a case that the party's
over," Dr. Erank says. However,
the sudden popularity of punk

music has made it easier to be a
punk band than it ever has been."
Although the Mr. T Experience
has a solid local fanbase, the crowds
they draw are not mainstream, and
their view of life is unique. The Mr.
T Experience will remain a signifi
cant musical force in the Bay Area
when dozens of other bands have
come and gone.
