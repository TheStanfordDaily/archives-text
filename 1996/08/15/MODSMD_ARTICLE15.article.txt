# EMMA
## 
### 
Although "Emma" doesn't
have the same laugh-a-minute
comic pace as "Clueless" — the
recent retelling of the Jane
Austen classic — this adaptation
is a subtle romantic comedy that
keeps you amused and enter
tained. Writer and first-time di
rector Douglas McCarthy re
veals the same flair for satire
that helped him co-write Woody
Allen's hilarious "Bullets Over
Broadway," making this latest
installment in the slew of
Austen adaptations a welcome
addition.
Strangely enough the title
character — one of the most fa
mous heroines in British litera
ture — is played by American ac
tress Gwyneth Paltrow. Emma
is a rather selfish, manipulative,
"clueless" young lady, who lives
with a rich, doting father and en

tertains herself with misguided
attempts to make everyone as
happy and informed as herself.
Like Alicia Silverstone, Pal
trow manages the somewhat dif
ficult task of making Emma lik
able enough that you actually
care about her matchmaking
mishaps, moral and intellectual
development and quest for love.
Despite a number of strangely
elaborate hair-do's — which con
vince you that Emma really
must have had nothing much to
do — Paltrow pulls off a pretty
good performance.
Don't be turned off by the
first few minutes of the film,
which feature a huge spinning
earth and a cheesy family tree
like graph of the characters that
rather condescendingly suggests
that you won't be able to keep
track of the fairly simple plot. It
gets better.
Paltrow is aided by excellent
supporting performances. It
took a couple minutes to get
used to seeing Toni Colette

(Muriel of "Muriel's Wedding")
dressed in Victorian garb, but
she is believable and charming
as Emma's malleable friend
Harriet. Sophie Thompson, in
her role as a talkative spinster
who yells random words at her
deaf mother, and Juliet Steven
son as a conceited heiress who
prefaces her self-praise with "Of
course I wouldn't say this about
myself, but my friends say . .
provide some of the film's best
comic moments.
Particularly enjoyable are the
party scenes, where the whole
cast assembles to exchange witty
(or amusingly stupid) dialogue,
and where even the dancing fur
thers the plot, rather than sim
ply serving as the dead interlude
it often is in period films.
"Emma" isn't as clever as
"Sense and Sensibility" or as ro
mantic as "Persuasion" and it
unfortunately upholds the re
cent inexplicable trend of bad
hair for male leads in Austen cin
ema adaptations. It also, howev

er, continues the trend of quali
ty, entertaining Austen films.
