# KINGPIN
## 
### 
Athletics lend themselves well
to comedies. Movies like "Major
League" and "Happy Gilmore"
successfully spoof sports. Their
humor arises from oddball ath
letes who violate the understood
behavioral boundaries imposed by
the rules and codes of the activity.
I am fairly certain that bowling is
not a sport, but "Kingpin" is cer
tainly unconventional, original
and comical.
I once heard that bowling was
initially considered an elite, high
brow activity. To me, however,

bowling is Fred Flinstone's fa
vorite pastime, a time to sub
merge oneself in beer and act
trashy. I think that "Kingpin's"
creative team, the Farrelly Broth
ers (the same family responsible
for "Dumb and Dumber") agree
with my perception of the sport.
"Kingpin" stars Woody Harrel
son ("White Men Can't Jump") as
Roy Munson, the 1979 lowa state
bowling champion. As the tragic
hero of the movie, Roy's life
changes after an unfortunate
gambling accident. In a scene
reminiscent of "The Hustler,"
Roy becomes a bowler with a
handicap. The movie catapults
forward and reveals that Roy
deals with his modified life like

Nicolas Cage in "Leaving Las
Vegas."
Roy's woes are due primarily to
the sleazy super-bowler Ernie
McKracken or "Big Ern" played
by Bill Murray ("Groundhog
Day"). The dialogue for the entire
movie has a vintage Murray, late
70's "Saturday Night Live" feel
which, although despicably taste
less, goes perfectly with the bowl
ing theme. Big Ern dominates the
comedy; he is so detestable that
his character is a mocking execra
tion of the PC establishment.
Anyone with a twisted taste for
the offensive will notice Murray's
gift for manipulating social taboos
with humorous vulgarity.
Seventeen vears later, Roy

Munson's chance for salvation ap
pears in the form of an Amish
man named Ishmail, played by
Randy Quaid ("Vacation"). Ish
mail's single vice in a life devoted
to simplicity is bowling. After
noticing the talented Amish
bowler in the local lanes, Roy
takes on a role comically similar to
Paul Newman's character in"The
Color of Money." The freshly
formed manager-pupil duo em
bark on a conquest aimed at the
Bowler's Championship in Reno.
"Kingpin" melds absurd, inde
cent, and slapstick elements into
an always amusing movie with
pockets of absolute hilarity.
