## Under 22 team practicing at Maples 
### David Wolitz Editorial staff 
In preparation for the World
Championship Qualifying Tourna
ment in Puerto Rico later this
month, Mike Montgomery brought
his USA Men's Under 22 Team to
Stanford this week for 10 days of
intense practice.
The Stanford men's basketball
coach and the rest of the team, in
cluding Cardinal stars Brevin
Knight and Tim Young, will fly to

San Juan next Wednesday and will
face their first opponent, Panama,
on August 22.
The four-day tournament will
determine which three countries
from the Western Hemisphere are
allowed to compete in the 1997
Men's 22 and Under World Cham
pionship to be held in Melbourne,
Australia.
The American team got some
early publicity when it took on the
U.S. Olympic Team, popularly
known as the Dream Team, in

front of a national television audi
ence last month. Sparked by point
guard Knight, the Under 22 Team
gave the NBA stars a scare by
jumping out to a 17-point half
time lead. They ended up losing
that game by six points, but not
before proving that they were no
slouches. "They (the Dream
Team] probably thought they
could roll over us," Montgomery
said, "but we gave them a compet
itive situation. We did what we
were supposed to do; we prepared
them for the Olympics."
Although the game against the
Dream Team was actually a late
addition to the Under 22 Team's
schedule, Montgomery thinks it
"gave the team a jump-start" and
helped boost team morale.
Stanford center Young agreed.
"We were all excited about playing
the Dream Team. You see these
guys on TV, and it makes them
seem unreal, but they're all really
cool guys in person," he said. Still,
he wishes that college players had
a shot at playing in the Olympics.
"We made our point with the first
Dream Team," he said, though he
added that he can also "under
stand why USA Basketball wants
us to win the gold every time."
After playing the Dream Team
on July 5, the Under 22 Team play
ers did not play or practice togeth
er again until last Sunday when
they regrouped at Maples Pavilion.
"This week's practices are for the
real competition," Montgomery
said. Added Young, "These prac
tices are intense. Two-a-days take
a lot out of you, but we're able to

have a good time anyway."
While Montgomery and Young
are optimistic about the team's
chances in Puerto Rico, they are
not taking anything for granted.
"Puerto Rico will play tough on
their home court," cautioned
Montgomery. "Brazil and Argenti
na are also always good," he added.
Asked how this team would
have done in the Olympics, Mont
gomery smiled and said, "These
guys could compete. Whether
they'd win or not is another ques
tion. The rest of the world is catch

ingup to us."
For those who want to check
out the Under 22 Team for them
selves, two remaining practices
will be free and open to the public.
Both will be scrimmages against
Northern California Pro-Am
teams. This afternoon's scrim
mage against Sacramento Pro-Am
players will start at 4:30 p.m., and
Saturday's scrimmage against
San Francisco's Pro-Am team will
begin at 6:30 p.m. All practices and
scrimmages will take place at
Maples Pavilion.
