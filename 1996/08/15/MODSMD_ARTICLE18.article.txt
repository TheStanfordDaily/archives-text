# Tennis stadium gets face-lift thanks to Taube
## 
### David Wolitz Editorial staff 
Thanks primarily to the
largesse of philanthropist Ted
Taube, Stanford's tennis facilities
are undergoing extensive improve
ments, including the addition of

-2,500 permanent seats and the
construction of a new indoor
court.
Stanford men' tennis head
coach Dick Gould said he was "ex
cited about the new stadium," and
stressed that the improvements
"have ramifications for the entire

community. We'll be able to host
not just more tennis matches but
other events as well."
In addition to the 2,500 new
permanent seats, space will also be
provided in the newly renamed
Taube Family Tennis Stadium for
the erection of temporary bleach

ers with a seating capacity of
2,000. "The primary purpose of
the work," Gould said, "is to allow
additional seating and to be able to
finish matches indoors when the
weather goes bad."
The construction projects do
not come cheaply: The price-tag
for this phase of improvements to
tals $5.2 million, $2.5 million of
which was donated by Taube, a de
veloper and philanthropist who
became famous for founding the
now-defunct United States Foot
ball League. Taube, who earned
both his bachelor's and master's
degrees at Stanford, is currently
the CEO of the Woodmont Compa
nies, a $1 billion commercial real
estate firm based in Belmont, and
president of the Koret Founda
tion, a Jewish-sponsored charita
ble trust based in San Francisco.
Taube has remained active in
University circles since his under
graduate days, currently sittingon
the Hoover Institution's Board of
Overseers and on the Advisory
Board for Jewish Studies at Stan
ford.
His friendship with Gould and
his love for the game of tennis
prompted him to foot the bill for
almost half of the stadium pro
jects. Taube reportedly wanted
Stanford to have the largest out
door tennis venue in Northern
California, and he will get his wish.

Gould — who raised the addi
tional construction funds in small
er amounts from other private
donors— is confident that the im
proved stadium will allow Stan
ford to play host to ever more pres
tigious tournament, noting vague
ly that "negotiations are now
being conducted to bring a major
women's tour event to Stanford
for July of next year."
The improvements constitute
the second phase of a stadium re
development that began in 1989.
Work on the stadium is slated to
end by Feb. 1, and Gould added
that future construction will not
affect traffic flow along Campus
Drive.
