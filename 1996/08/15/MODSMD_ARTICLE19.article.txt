## Column David Wolitz Hard Rock absurdity 
### 
IS IT JUST me, or does every
body have a Hard Rock Cafe T
shirt? San Francisco. Singa
pore. London. Every city with any
claim to world-class status must
have its Hard Hock Cafe, and
every Hard Rock Cafe must have
its apparel store where T-shirts,
baseball caps and buttons are
hocked to the hoi polloi for $15 to
$25.
The shirts are so popular that
they have spawned a whole indus
try of Hard Rock rip-offs: counter
feit T's, parodies (Hard Knock
Cafe — Baghdad), and even coun
terfeit parodies.
Hard Rock T-shirts are not the
first articles of clothing to enjoy
almost universal recognition, but
they are perhaps the best repre
sentatives of the gaping empti
ness that lies at the core of the
emerging worldwide ethos of pop
ular culture.
Why do people buy these
shirts? Remember, Hard Rock
Cafe is basically a glorified ham
burger joint. The food is standard
American fare, nothing special
unless you haven't seen a french
fry in six months. The prices,
while not altogether exorbitant,
are definitely on the high side, and
the portions are nothing to write
home about.
To top it all off, the two distin
guishing features of a Hard Rock
Cafe contradict all traditional de
mands of taste and restaurant
ambiance: rock music so loud that
normal conversation is difficult
and garish rock-and-roll memora

bilia masquerading as interior
decoration.
But it is pointless to look inside
the restaurant for a clue to its
worldwide appeal; its popularity
has nothing to do with what goes
on in the kitchen. That is what
makes it such a fascinating and ul
timately frightening phenome
non: It is an internationally recog
nized cultural icon devoid of any
distinguishing, much less distin
guished, substance.
It is not as if the Hard Rock
Cafe gained its fame from its food
or even its association with any
one place. Like McDonald's, its
menu is identical all over the
world, the Caesar salad tastes the
same in Las Vegas as it does in
Osaka, and the same Eric Clapton
guitars grace the walls of the
Berlin and San Francisco restau
rants.
Yet for millions of people, the
I lard Rock Cafe is on the itinerary
wherever they may happen to be
touring. Even if they live in places
with Hard Rocks of their own,
tourists will line up to buy T
shirts outside of the New York
store.
And here we encounter the
height of the absurdity that is
Hard Rock Cafe: most people who
wear the T-shirts never even sit
down to have a meal there; they
simply walk into the apparel stores
to look at and purchase Hard Rock
buttons, caps and sweatshirts.
What in the world compels these
people to buy memorabilia from a
restaurant in which they have

never even eaten?
In an oh-so-trendy philosophy
seminar I took last spring, we
spent much of our time trying to
figure out what exactly the term
postmodernism means with re
spect to cultural trends. We talked
a lot about signs and simulations.
And to make a long story short,
one of the basic themes of the
course was that, in the postmod
ern age, the signifier (i.e., the
word or the symbol) has lost touch
with the signified (i.e., that which
the word or symbol was meant to
represent). I thought most of this
so-called semiology was just slop
py philosophy of language, but I
now see what it is getting at.
Think of a Hard Rock Cafe T
shirt as the signifier, and then ask
yourself what it signifies. What is
the message of a Hard Rock Cafe

T-shirt? Here we have the ulti
mate dissociation between reality
and the signifiers which are sup
posed to represent it. One would
expect that the words would point
to some place or thing that the
wearer holds in high regard, but
we know that's not the case. More
likely than not, the wearer of a
Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt has never
even entered the restaurant.
Think of how many steps away
from the kitchen one must take to
get to $300 leather logo jackets.
Better yet, trv it the other way

around. What connection does the
jacket have with the actual food
produced in the kitchen? What
Gertrude Stein originally said
about Oakland applies equally to
the Hard Rock Cafe phenomenon:
There's no there there.
Or, perhaps one must say, the
only there there is a brilliant mar
keting scheme. And all of us are
the suckers.
