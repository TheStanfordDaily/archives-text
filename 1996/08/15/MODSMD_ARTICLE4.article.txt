## Packard's legacy: What does future hold? 
### Elisabeth Traugott Contributing writer 
David Packard, who died on
March 26 of this year, lived a life
that was inextricably bound to
Stanford, his alma mater. But his
death may symbolize the end of an
era for multimillion dollar
Packard donations as his vast per
sonal fortune is turned over to his
family-run foundation.
The Packards expressed their
devotion to the University —

where Packard met both his wife
Lucile Salter Packard and his fu
ture business partner William
Hewlett — by donating immense
sums of money for capital pro
grams and the support of brilliant
young scholars. Together with
Hewlett, they contributed more
than $300 million over the course
of their lifetimes.
Vice President for Develop
ment John Ford described the
gratitude Stanford feels for
Packard and Hewlett, who togeth-

er founded the
computer giant
Hewlett-
Packard (the
order of the
names was de
cided by the
toss of a coin),
considered to be
the company
which gave life
to Silicon Val
ley.
"I think that
it is hard to
imagine anyone
coming along
who will really
replace Dave
Packard and
Bill Hewlett in
terms of their
impact of the
community and
certainly on
this Universi
ty," Ford said.
"It really is a
rare individual
who has a sense
of responsibili
ty that they
need to give
back to the com
munity they
came from."
The Packards
gave Stanford
the Lucile
Salter Packard
Children's Hos
pital. They
modernized the

School of Medicine's prenatal and
pediatric laboratories. Before
Packard died, he and Hewlett
promised a new engineering quad,
which will be funded by his estate.
The two men started a program
which will give scientists the
unique opportunity to do research
in their particular areas of interest
with unrestricted funds.
As many have expressed,
Packard's life and work have left
an indelible imprint on the Uni
versity which may be impossible to
duplicate, both in terms of the
closeness of his ties and the gen
erosity that he bestowed. The
bond is visible not only in the
names of buildings and on shiny
gold plaques, but in the mission of
the University itself as a forerun
ner of technological innovation
and quality education.
A transition period
At the time of his death,
Packard owned 9 percent of the
Hewlett-Packard Corporation. He
left these shares, worth around
$4.36 billion, to The David and Lu
cile Packard Foundation, which he
founded with his wife in 1964.
Combined with the foundation's
existing assets of $2.3 billion, the
bequest will catapult the founda
tion — whose causes include ma
rine biology, the arts and child
welfare — to the top of the philan
thropic ladder. Its assets of be
tween $6.5 and $7 billion, depend
ing on the stock market, will rank
it alongside the Ford Foundation
and the VV.K. Kellogg Foundation.
According to Cole Wilbur, the
foundation's executive director, it
will take about 18 months for the
stock to be fully transferred. In
that time, the board of trustees
will undergo a period of reassess
ment and transition to plan and
strategize donations using their
newfound assets. Among the
board's members are the four
Packard children: David Packard
Jr. (director of the Stanford The
ater and a Stanford alum), Nancy
Packard Burnett, Susan Packard

Orr (president of the foundation,
also a Stanford alum and now wife
of Stanford's Dean of Earth Sci
ences Franklin M. Orr.), and Julie
Packard.
It is not yet clear how these
changes may affect Stanford, if at
all. However, most of the $300 mil
lion granted by the Packards to
the University was from the fami
ly's personal fortune. Wilbur said
only a little over $11 million came
directly from the foundation.
While he couldn't comment
specifically on how Stanford may
fit in to the foundation's revised
picture, Wilbur was able to say
that the relationship between the
two institutions is solid and deeply
rooted.
"We have regular contact with
the development office, the
provost and the president, and
with a number of different people
throughout the University that we
have worked with in the past," he
said, citing scientists, archeolo

gists and Medical School faculty
and staff.
And while he conceded that
Packard's personal relationship
with Stanford has come to an end,
Wilbur said he doesn't "believe the
foundation's relationship with
Stanford will change at all,"
adding, "We admire the people and
the good works that are going on
[at Stanford |."
Humble origins
Horn in 1912 in Pueblo, Colo.,
Packard was a member of the
Class of '34. While an undergradu
ate, his athleticism landed him
places on the football, track, and
basketball teams. He shared with
his friend and classmate Bill
Hewlett a love of the outdoors and
a fascination for electrical engi
neering.

The Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital, above, was made pos
sible by a $70 million grant by the Packard Foundation. The hospital
was named after Packard's late wife, who passed away in 1987.
