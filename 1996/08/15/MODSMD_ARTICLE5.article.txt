# Campus unaffected by weekend outage

The lights burned brightly on
the Stanford campus Saturday
night, even while neighboring Palo
Alto languished in darkness during
a major power outage lasting close
to seven hours.
"The outage didn't affect the
campus at all," said Steve
Briscombe, power systems manag
er in Stanford's utilities division.
Not many realized that the Uni
versity has its own power genera
tor, Briscombe explained. The gas
fed turbine supplies electricity to
the campus as well as the Medical
School.
Stanford Hospital, on the other
hand, receives its power from the
Palo Alto's city-run Utilities De
partment, since it lies within the
boundaries of the city. At 3:55 p.m.
on Saturday afternoon, Palo Alto's
29,000 electricity customers, in
cluding Stanford Hospital, lost
their power, said City Utilities Di
rector Ed Mrizek.
For more than two hours, the
hospital was running on its reserve
power supplied by Stanford Uni
versity's generator. Mrizek said
electricity was restored to the hos
pital at 6:10 p.m., although other
Palo Alto customers remained in
the dark until nearly midnight.
Palo Alto buys its power from
several out-of-state companies
such as Bonneville Power Adminis
tration in ()regon, the state where
Saturday's outage began. Pacific
Gas & Electric, the company that
supplies electricity to most of Palo
Alto's neighboring cities, acts as
the highway providing power lines
that deliver electricity to the city,
Mrizek said. So when PG&E h;is a
problem, Palo Alto has a problem.
()n Saturelay, major stretches of
PG&E's highway were knocked
out across nine western U.S. states

from Washington to Texas. PG&E
spokesman David Bicha said an
emergency Department of Energy
meeting in Oregon Monday deter
mined that the outage was trig
geri>d when a sagging 500,000-volt
Oregon transmission line touched
a tree and short-circuited the sys
tem.
Some PG&E customers, howev
er, were not affected. Students in
Stanford residences, which lie out
side Palo Alto's city boundaries and
beyond the jurisdiction of the Uni
versity's generator, are PG&E cus
tomers. Their power remained un
affected.
"The first I knew of the blackout
was when I left my dorm on Saturday
evening to go out for dinner in Palo
Alto," Paloma resident Nicole Shen
said. As she hiked along Universi
ty Avenue, the usually lively down
town streets wore pitch black and
most of the restaurants closed up.
Residents of Escondido Village
were also unaware of the outage.
The first that student Mariko
Hayashibara knew of the problem
was when she left her residence
around 5 p.m.
"It was really weird,"
Hayashibara said, "Police were
standing around at intersections
(directing traffic)."
PG&E customers in the neigh
boring cities of Los Altos, Menlo
Park and Mountain View were af
fected only sporadically by the out
age. Restaurants and stores re
mained open in these areas, pick
ing up much of Palo Alto's lost
business. According to Bicha, the
outages were scattered because t he
system is designed to spread the
load when supply is down.
At lunch time Monday another
outage crippled downtown busi
nesses for up to 45 minutes. Mrizek
said Monday's outage was unrelat
ed to Saturday's problems
