# Taylor helps shape key financial plan for Republican party
## Economics prof. advises Dole 
### Kristie Smith writer 
Stanford Economics Prof. John
Taylor has emerged as one of the
leading economic strategists for
Bob Dole this election year.
Taylor, a moderate conservative
who is frequently consulted by
business leaders and lawmakers
for his economic expertise, has
worked with a team of other eco
nomic advisers on Dole's recent
campaign proposal to provide 90

million Americans with a sweeping 15 percent
across-the-board tax cut, if elected.
The plan has taken center stage at this week's Re
publican National Convention in San Diego and i.s
expected to be the centerpiece of Dole's strategy
against President Clinton in this year's election.
Taylor's involvement with the plan is often
cited by Republican politicians and advocates of
the proposal to add credibility to the plan in the
face of criticism that taxes can not be cut while also
balancing the budget. Considering Taylor's repu
tation, it is no wonder why his work on the plan is
important.
Educated at both Stanford and Princeton, Taylor
specializes in macroeconomics, which is the study of
the nation's economy. He has directed Stanford's
Center for Economic Policy Research for two years
and has taught at the University since 1984. During
his career, Taylor has built a solid reputation for
himself at Stanford and throughout the nation as a
leading macroeconomist.
Modest in characterizing his involvement with
Dole, Taylor said, "I've been characterized as the
'main point person' lately in the news [but] I
wouldn't say that I was that. I like to characterize
myself as a 'Dole adviser to the economy.' "
Accordingto David Starrett, chair ofthe Econom
ics Department at Stanford, Taylor is one of the na
tion's top introductory economics instructors.
Taylor has been teaching elementary economics
for about 10 years and his Economics 1 class during
fall quarter brings in more than 300 students.
The course explores the functioning of a modern
market economy, including the determination of na
tional income and its distribution, composition of

output, thegrowth of the economy, inflation and un
employment.
"He gets rave ratings from his students. He uses
real-world examples so people see economic policy
does matter," said Starrett in an Associated Press in
terview. "He brings it out in front and engages stu
dents' thinking about [economics]."
In fact, in one of his more famous real-world ex
amples, Taylor has been known to lecture in a 'Cali
fornia Raisin' costume to illustrate supply and de
mand. "I wanted to bring humor and informality to
economics in the context of agricultural supply and
demand," he said.
1 )ole ;dso gives Taylor rave reviews for his skills as
an instructor as well as for his dedication in working
on the new economic plan.
"John Taylor is ... a great economist [and] well
respected," said Dole during a speech in Chicago last
Monday. "His students give him great credit for
teaching them real economics, real-world problems,
talking about the real world and real people."

According to Taylor, it took about three months
to wrap up the plan and he was involved with Dole
that entire time.
"I was with Dole in Chicago when he announced
t he plan and I've been working closely with him over
the past 10 days," Taylor said in an interview on
campus late last week. Taylor is now back with Dole
in San Diego for the convention.
The final version of the plan is good, said Taylor.
The purpose is to raise the economic growth rate and
help middle America, and "it's got the ingredients to
do that," he said.
It is just the "principles of elementary economics
at a national level," Taylor added.
