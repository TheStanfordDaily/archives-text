## Bulldozers take over Governor's Corner parking lot 
### Mignon Fogarty 
As fall quarter grows near, bulldozers in
Governor's Corner are revving up to build
new graduate student housing. The new fa
cilities, which will be located in the space
formerly occupied by the Governor's Cor
ner parking lot, will provide apartment
style housing for over 200 graduate stu
dents.
According to Housing and Dining Ser
vices, only 50 percent of graduate students
who want to live on campus are able to get an
assignment. With the vacancy rate in Palo
Alto at only 1 percent, the search for housing
places a huge strain on graduate students
Nearly all undergraduates who want to live
on campus are assigned housing.
Said Jeffrey Tumlin, program manager of
transportation progress, "This particular
housing project has been part of the Univer
sity plan for the last two years. The Universi
ty has a long-term goal of meeting all student
housing demand, both for academic reasons

as well as transportation reasons. Students
who live on campus don't need to drive a car
or commute to class, saving us lots of money
and land on commuter parking spaces.
"For these reasons, the University is hop
ing to build a lot more housing for faculty
and staff as part of the Sand Hill Road pro
jects currently being reviewed by the City of
Palo Alto," he added.
Though undergraduates slated to move
into Governor's Corner this fall have ex
pressed concern over the state of their for
mer parking lot, Tumlin said the Universi
ty's plans to replace the lost spaces are on
schedule.
"We're building enough new spaces be
tween the old parking lot and the driving
range to replace every lost parking space, as
well as expanding the Roble parking lot," he
added. "The new lot replaces all those lost by
the housing project and it will be completed
before students move in this fall."
The new residence is scheduled to be com
pleted in September 1998.
