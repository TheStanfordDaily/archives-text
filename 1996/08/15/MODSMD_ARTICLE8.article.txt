# Term papers invade the Web
## On-line services increase access to previously written essays 
### Mignon Fogarty 
In keeping with the spirit of the
Web and a free market economy, a
new pool of free term papers is now
available, set up by people with a
renegade attitude who see them
selves as advocates for beleaguered
students.
Term papers have always been
available for sale, but the accessibili
ty of the Web has allowed existing
vendors to expand their services and
increased the speed with which a
customer can receive papers.
According to Susan Hirt, an in
structor in the Classics Depart
ment, accessing term papers over
the Web is obvious plagiarism. "The
term papers available on the Web
are a blatant violation of the letter
and spirit of the Honor Code," Hirt
said. "I am a firm believer in the
Honor Code, and although instruc
tors must take reasonable steps to
discourage violations, it is up to the
students to avoid temptation from
outside the University," she added.
While the quality and cost of term
papers varies, providers uniformly
deny that they intend their services
to be used for educational miscon
duct. Terry Hofkins of TermPa
pers.on.Line pointed out that the
services offered by his company dif
fer little from study aids such as Cliff
Notes, proofreading services and
test files made available by many
professors.
"People are using our papers as a
source of background information,

and when referenced in the bibliog
raphy as we suggest, they're the
same as any other resource,"
Hofkins said.
"Typically we get a call from a
student who has received an assign
ment and wants to know if we have
something similar. When they get
the paper, they add to it and re-write
it to fit their class better." Hofkins
refuses to sell completed papers to
students he believes are obviously
trying to work around the system.
Instead he'll try to sell them "a 90
percent completed one, forcing them
to finish it themselves."
Hirt could not imagine what
essay assignment would benefit
from the use of a previously written
paper. "The essays that I assign ask
students to interpret texts using the
skills we have studied in class. I want
them to present their own ideas.
There is no need to look elsewhere,
and in fact it defeats the purpose of
the exercise if they use someone
else's ideas," Hirt said.
With respect to students using
term papers as templates for their
own papers, Hirt said, "The best way
to improve writing skills is to prac
tice. If a student is really concerned
about improving their writing skills,
then surely the professor who as
signed the paper should be the first
resource for help. If the professor is
unwilling, Stanford has writing tu
tors who can critique papers in any
subject."
The School Sucks Web page of
fers similar services, with a radically

different flavor. The term papers on
this page are as free as the irreverent
attitude, donated by other students
and posted without the quality con
trol measures provided by the fee
for-service vendors.
Kenny Sahr, a student at Miami
International University, is the cre
ator School Sucks. Sahr has worked
as both a writer and an internation
al news correspondent.
Candice Tong, a Stanford junior
who has checked out the School
Sucks site, said she "wouldn't ever
use the page. I would be much more
likely to ask my professor for exam
ples of their assignment or exams,
rather than looking at papers from
some random source. The quality of
the papers seemed low, and also
there weren't very many of them."
Sahr conceded, however, that
"the more papers we get from people
the better this Web page is going to
be. It's definitely by students and for
students."
He also noted his adamant belief
that students should never have to
pay for term papers. "Any profit I
make will always come from adver
tisers," he said.
Aside from profit, one motivating
force behind setting up a these Web
pages is equality in accessibility.
Hofkins and Sahr pointed out that
in the past students only had access
to test files and old term papers if
they had a large group of friends or
were part of the Greek system. Ac
cording to Sahr, "students
shouldn't need to join a fraternity to

have access to this kind of informa
tion. I want everyone to be able to get
term papers, from the frat guys to
the propeller heads."
William Lee, president of the
Stanford chapter of Lambda Phi Ep
silon said his fraternity does have a
test file, but doesn't have a large col
lection of term papers. Lee expected
more Stanford students to be inter
ested in the peripheral services of
fered by these sites than the actual
term papers.
"I noticed TermPapers.on.Line
has a CD-ROM with 150 SAT prac
tice tests. If they had something like
that for the MCAT, I'd definitely
purchase it," said Lee. Hofkins is
currently attempting to compile a

CD-ROM of just such exams
through the freedom of information
act.
With respect to plagiarism, both
Hofkins and Sahr agreed that any
one who tries to pass off someone
else's term paper as their own was
just plain foolish.
"With School Sucks everyone has
equal access, and that includes pro
fessors. Chances are, most profes
sors have seen any paper that is re
motely related to a topic they would
assign," Sahr pointed out.
Hofkins added, "The fact is that
the people who sit in the front, ask
questions, take notes and study and
work hard will be a lot better ofT in
the long run than those who goof olf
