# Medical School professor furthers research on adrenaline-like drugs

Adrenaline-like drugs are often prescribed to re
duce blood pressure, but they can also cause oppos
ing effects in the body. A recent discovery at the
School of Medicine, however, may eliminate these
antagonistic effects and lead to a significant im
provement of these drugs.
Researchers in Medical School Prof. Brian Ko
bilka's lab found that only one out of the three dif
ferent subtypes of the so-called «2-adrenergic re
ceptors (a2*AR) — the protein to which adrena
line-like drugs bind — mediates the desired effect
of lowering blood pressure. This discovery was
published in last week's issue of Science magazine.
«2"ARs are located throughout the entire body
and, among other functions, regulate the cardio
vascular system. According to the article in Sci
ence, "ct2-ARs located in the brain stem . . . pro
duce a long lasting drop in systemic blood pressure.
.. . Paradoxically, stimulation of on arter
ial smooth muscle cells increases blood pressure by
increasing vascular resistance."
"The end result," Kobilka said in a press release,
"is that the effects tend to cancel each other out,
lessening the benefit of the medication."
Kobilka and his co-workers have found that
only the subtype causes the decrease in
blood pressure after stimulation. The subtype
°2B"AR causes the adverse effect by narrowing the
veins. The third subtype, «2C> is not involved in

the regulation of blood pressure altogether.
To study the different «2"AR subtypes, the
group raised mice without the functional gene for
the «on-AR or the «2r-AR subtypes.
"Tnis knockout technique is pretty standard,"
said Kobilka. "You transfer a copy of the gene
which is interrupted by a marker into" certain cells
in the embryo. Some offspring of two of these mice
will miss the targeted receptor.
The mice missing showed a larger de
crease in blood pressure in response to an adrena
line-like drug. Animals missing 02Q-AR were sim
ilar to normal mice in that regard. This observa
tion leaves as the active receptor for drugs
that lower bloc*! pressure, whereas causes
the adverse effect.
So far, drugs activated all three receptors,
which are 50 to 60 percent similar, according to Ko
bilka. Now, drugs can be specifically targeted to
ward «2C"AR. A much smaller drug dose will suf
fice to lower blood pressure and accompanying
problems can be reduced.
"Using mice as a model for humans is not an
ideal situation," he added. "There are some differ
ences. But it is a long way from the test-tube to
drugs," and mice are good for initial developments.
Although helping to make the discovery, Kobil
ka's lab will not work on the development of the
new drugs themselves. "The information is out
there now for everybody," said Kobilka, and com
panies will work on the development of new drugs.
