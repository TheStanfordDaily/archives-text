## Woods cruises at Amateur; will he go pro? 
### David Wolitz Editorial staff with AP wire reports 
One down and five to go. Tiger
Woods overpowered the Witch Hol
low course at Pumpkin Ridge yes
terday and dismissed J.D. Manning
3 and 2 to win his first-round match
in the U.S. Amateur Championship.
A deadly driver that consistent
ly split fairways 320 yards out
made up for a shaky putter early in
the match as Woods came hack
from 1-down after six holes to win
the next three holes.
The match ended on the 16th
green when Manning missed an 8-
foot birdie putt that could have
kept it going.
Woods plays Jerry Courville,
37, a longtime amateur with the
kind of experience that could
prove troublesome, in Thursday's
second round.
Manning, a senior at Colorado
State, didn't have that kind of ex

perience, but he did stick with the
20-year-old Stanford student
longer than expected.
40-foot chip
The key shot was a 40-foot chip
in from the back fringe on No. 8
that put Woods 1-up and rattled
Manning enough to lead to a bogey
on the next hole.
"That was really the turning
point of the match," Woods said
about the intentionally bladed
wedge down the slope from the
back fringe.
"With the speed it was going, it
would probably have gone off the
green," he said.
Instead it hit the stick and
dropped in for a birdie.
"It took the wind out of my
sails," Manning said. "I think I
lost my tempo for a couple of
holes."
And as much as that chip
turned the momentum of the

match, the next hole told the
broader story.
Woods hit his tee shot 325
yards on No. 9 and was about 80
yards past Manning.
"We played different golf cours
es," Manning said. "On No. 9, I'm
hitting 2-iron in and he's hitting 7,
8 or 9."
"If someone plays well and
starts making putts they can give
him a run for his money," Man
ning said when asked it anyone
could beat Woods. "It won't be a
Cakewalk."
Woods knows that as well, say
ing that "anyone of the 64 people"
who qualified for match play can
beat him. After yesterday's play,
there were 32 players left. And
Woods needs to win five
more victories for his unprece
dented third U.S. Amateur title.
Will he go pro?
If Woods does indeed win this

tournament again, there is grow
ing speculation that he will forego
his final two years of college eligi
bility and turn pro immediately.
Rumors to that effect have been
circulating across the country for
the past couple of weeks.
Woods, however, appears con
tent at Stanford, where he has
made a couple of close friends and
has expressed enthusiasm about
his academic classes. But the sheer
amount of money he stands to gai
by becoming a professional has
many wondering why he has not
done so already. Among those
awaiting Woods' final decision on
the matter is Nike CEO Phil
Knight, who makes no secret of his
desire to sign Woods to a lucrative
endorsement deal.
Woods appeared to lay the con
troversy to rest on Tuesday by
telling a reporter, "Yes, I will be
there" when asked about his possi
ble attendance at an amateur
event in November. However, his

father's statement that Woods al
ways likes to challenge the best
was interpreted by many to mean
that he will turn pro if he success
fully defends his U.S. Amateur
title this week.
