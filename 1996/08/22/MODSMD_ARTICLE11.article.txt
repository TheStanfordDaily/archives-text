# Stanford football hopes to build on last year's success
## DESPITE QUARTERBACK QUESTION, WILLINGHAM SAYS TEAM IS GEARING UP TO EXCEED HIGH EXPECTATIONS 
### JEN GRAVES 
Give Stanford football head
coach Tyrone Willingham a
challenge, and he will rise to
it.
At least that's what the evi
dence shows. Taking over the team
last year after a disappointing 3-7-
1 season, Willingham had to deal
with some very high expectations.
And he delivered.
The final record of the 1995
Cardinal football team came in at
7-4-1. Stanford fans breathed a
collective sigh of relief as their
team was transformed into a win
ner. A near-upset over the highly
touted USC Trojans and an invita
tion to the Liberty Bowl convinced
all doubters that WillinghamV
early successes were no flukes.
Despite the turnaround success
of last season, Willingham said he
intends to take his team to new
heights this year. "We definitely
left ourselves room to improve," he
said. "Each year takes on a differ
ent personality — you start fresh.
That's where we'll be."
So while it is tempting to revel
in last year's success, the team has
its eyes set on this year as its goal
and task.
Returning to the Farm for the
1996 season will be 14 starters, in
cluding seven on defense, six on of -
fense, one kicker and 35 lettermen.
While the team is losing such
prizes as quarterback Mark But
terfield, cornerback Kwame Ellis
and kicker Eric Abrams, the new
stars look to shine just as brightly.
Popping the question . ..
again
As far as the starting quarter
back is concerned, once again a
question mark stands in the place
of a name.
Despite the importance of the
position, Willingham is not con

cerned that he has yet to choose
the starter. "I'm very patient
about I the quarterback) decision,"
he said. "We don't have to have
that until Sept. 7, and we will find
the young man that gives our foot
ball team the chance to win and be
successful."
In the running this year are
Chad Hutchinson and Tim Carey,
both of whom are lacking in expe
rience hut are replete with skills.
Hutchinson, a sophomore from
Southern California, doubles his
athletic involvement as Stanford
baseball's number-two starting
pitcher. His fast ball has been
clocked at 94 mph.and in the June
1995 Major League draft, he was
selected by the Atlanta Braves in
the first round (26th pick overall).
Instead of answering the lucra
tive call to play pro ball, Hutchin
son opted to stay at Stanford to
play both baseball and football.
He red-shirted in football last
year, and his potential in this
sport lies in wait. ll' his high
school statistics are indicative of
hi. talents, Cardinal fans have
good reason to look forward to his
play. As a senior at Torrey Pines
High School in San Diego, he com
pleted 85 of 183 passes for 1,441
yards and eight touchdowns.
Standing 6 feet 5 inches and
weighing in at 230 pounds, he has
the strength, agility and skill to
fill the shoes of Butterfield, but he
does have competition.
That competition is Carey, a se
nior also from Southern Califor
nia, who became Stanford's hack
up quarterback last year after
vying for the starting spot with
Butterfield. Carey is equally inex
perienced in collegiate play (al
though he flashed in for one series
of downs during last year's Ore
iron came) hut can easilv hold his

own in any quarterback compari
son. Out of high school, he was
rated the fourth-best prep quar
terback prospect in the nation by
Super Prep and Blue Chip Report.
And it is no wonder. His accom
plishments as a high school senior
eclipse even Hutchinson's. Com
pleting2l7 0f335 passes for 3,397
yards, he tossed 35 touchdowns
and only nine interceptions. At 6
feet 4 inches and 195 pounds,
Carey is touted as a strong passer
with the ability to throw into zone
coverage. In his personal hall of
fame, he can count among his
honors the relationship of his
great une'e, Dick Van Dyke.
Whatever happens, Willing
ham insists that it is not the quar
terback alone that defines a foot
ball team. "The quarterback is a
critical part of any system," he
said, "but our leadership must
come from our entire team. Every
young man must be a leader.
You've heard the saying that the
chain is only as strong as its weak
est link? Well, we think our chain
is pretty strong."
On offense
The running backs of the 1996
Cardinal figure to be the strength
of the team. With the top four
rushers returning, the team can
only hope to turn in as big a suc
cess as last year: 1,819 yards rush
ing, the ninth-highest single-sea
son total in school history. Junior
Anthony Bookman and senior
Mike Mitchell at running back
create a potent combination with
senior fullbacks Adam Salina and
Greg Cornelia.
Bookman has led the Cardinal
in rushing for the past two sea
sons with a total of 1,449 yards.
That distance puts him in the po
sition of 11th all-time at Stanford
and only 94 yards short of the top
10. Mitchell's credits include 593
yards last year and six rushing
touchdowns. At Big Game,
Mitchell proved himself with 26
carries, 138 yards and two touch
downs.
The big fullbacks Salina and
Cornelia will be called upon to play
a diverse range of roles in the
Stanford offense. Running, pass
ing and blocking, these two will
have to do it all. While Salina is
considered the better blocker of
the two, Cornelia seems to have a
nose for the goal line, leading the
team in touchdowns last year with
nine (five rushing, four receiving).
Like all running backs, Stan
ford's rely on the strength of their
offensive line. According to Will
ingham, "[the offensive line) is an
area of concern. When you lose
guys of the caliber of left tackle
Jeff Buckey (First-Team All-Pac
-10 in 1995), center T.J. Gaynor
(three-year starter) and left guard
Ryan Waters, it's very difficult to
replace not only their talent and
experience, but the other intangi

bles they bring to the team."
The leaders of the line this year
will be seniors Brad Badger at
right guard and Nathan Parks,
who will move from right to left
tackle. Badger, who said the of
fense is "balancing out better," is
the most experienced player on
Stanford's offense, having started
in 22 of the Cardinal's last 23
games.
1 he remainder of the offensive
line, like so many positions on this
team, has yet to be determined,
but the veterans are taking a "let
the cards fall where they may" at
titude. "There's such a high
turnover rate," said Badger, "and

it's hard to fill those shoes. You've
got lots of question marks, but a
couple years ago, I was one of
those question marks."
The passing and kicking
game
One of the Cardinal's bright
spots and one of Stanford's all
time great receivers is senior
flanker Brain Manning. This will
be his final year, and he is on the
verge of breaking into the team's
top 10 list of all-time career recep
tions. So far, he has racked up 103
receptions for 1,897 yards. Senior
Marlon Evans and junior Damon
Dunn, two of the nation's top

kickoff return specialists, will
fight for the starting wide receiv
er position.
Greg Clark, who transferred to
the Farm last year and produced
23 receptions for 260 yards and
two touchdowns in his first sea
son here, will headline the Cardi
nal's trio of tight ends with se
niors Tommy Hanson and Derek
Hubbard.
In the kicking department,
someone will need to step up and
fill the big shoes left by the gradu
ation of Stanford's all-time lead
ing scorer, place-kicker Eric
Abrams. Competing for his posi
tion will be sophomore Patrick

Shinnefield, who red-shirted his
freshman year, and junior Kevin
Miller, the Cardinal's starting
punter in 1995. Miller's average
of 37.4 yards per punt last season
will most likely land him the posi
tion given that Shinnefield has
only limited playing experience at
the college level.
In defense of the Cardinal
Stanford has also lost a few
good men in the department of
defense. "The losses on the defen
sive line are substantial," said
Willingham. "The three players
we lost from last year — Jason
White, John Hebert and David

Carder — brought more to the
team than just their play on the
field." This year's leading line
men include fifth-year senior
tackle Pete Swanson and junior
ends Carl Hansen and Kailee
Wong.
While he began last season as a
back-up, Hansen replaced the in
jured Jason White as left defen
sive end in the third game, and by
the time White had recuperated,
Hansen had shown his colors and
remained in the starting lineup as
right defensive end. He ended the
season ranked fourth in the Pac
-10 in quarterback sacks with
eight.
Swanson stands as Stanford's
most experienced lineman. A se
nior, he has recorded 61 career
tackles, nine quarterback sacks
and 14 tackles-for-loss. At 6 feet 6
inches and 300 pounds, he is a
force with which to be reckoned.
Wong also has the advantage of
experience on his side. He has
played intermittently in the start
ing lineup since his freshman sea
son in 1994.
At nose tackle, junior Anthony
Willis, senior Evan Wagner and
sophomore Desmond Cook will
fight it out for the starting spot,
and at defensive end will be senior
and two-year letterman Bryan
Werner.
As far as linebackers are con
cerned, junior Chris Draft, who
also plays baseball, will head a
three-man rotation at the two in
side linebacker spots which in
cludes juniors Jon Ritchie and
Jon Haskins.
The outside linebacker lineup
returns seniors Nicodemus Watts
and Brian Batson, who has start
ed 19 games in this position over
the last three years. Watts has
proven himself as a special teams
player, but his improvements on
the outside line may make him a
big player on the Cardinal defense
this year.
Senior Leroy Pruitt returns
for his third season at corner
back, but a replacement for
Kwame Ellis at the other corner
position will be necessary for a
powerful Stanford defense. The
contenders include junior Corey
Hill and senior Alistair White. At
free and strong safety, respective
ly, seniors Josh Madsen and Eliel
Swinton come back from a solid
season. Madsen and Pruitt tied
for second in the Pac-10 with four
interceptions each.
Balance and discipline
Willingham began his coaching
career at Stanford with a promise
to balance the playing style of his
team. He came to a team on which
the offense was much stronger
than the defense and passing and
running were also unequal. In
1993, the Cardinal passed for
3,709 yards and rushed for only
700, and in 1994, Stanford passed

for 3,358 and rushed for 1,531.
Willingham put his stress on the
run and the consistency of the of
fense, and the entire team has
benefited.
Both Badger and Manning
commented that the team is "bal
ancing out better," and that will
be a major factor in determining
the future of the Cardinal's suc
cess. The replacement of losses
plays a key role in the new chem
istry of the team, but Willingham
accepts the challenge as one of
the many things that distin
guishes collegiate football from
the NFL.
How does Willingham intend
to carry out his plans? Discipline.
Pruitt said, "From the very first
meeting, we could tell I Willing
ham] was all business. This is a
disciplined team," he said. "You
come to a workout at seven in the
morning and meet him just com
ing back from a workout."
The road ahead
The first game will be played at
home on Sept. 7 against the Uni
versity of Utah. Stanford beat the
Utes last year 27-20 in the second
game of the season, but this year
Willingham said Stanford will be
a little "behind the eight-ball."
Unlike Stanford, this will be
Utah's second game, but it will be
a good challenge for the team, ac
cording to Willingham.
Next, Stanford will remain at
home while the Spartans of San
Jose State visit on Sept. 14. Wis
consin's Camp Randall Stadium
rounds out the pre-conference
games, and both Stanford and
Wisconsin will be looking to win
this year on Sept. 21 after last
year's tie (24-24).
On Oct. 5, Stanford will be at
the University of Washington to
avenge last year's game, which
Stanford lost at home, 38-28. The
next two games will be against the
University of Oregon at home
(Oct. 12) and Oregon State Uni
versity at Parker Stadium the fol-

' I'm very patient about
[the quarterback] deci
sion. We don't have to
have that until Sept. 7,
and we will find the
young man that gives
our football team the
chance to win and be
successful.'

At home, Stanford will be pur
suing Arizona State University
on Oct. 26, after a 28-30 loss last
year. The eighth game will be
played at the Rose Bowl on Nov. 2,
against the Bruins of UCLA,
where Stanford will also have a
1995 loss to rise above.
At home on Nov. 9, Stanford
will challenge the winners of last
year's Rose Bowl, with a record of
9-2-1, the USC Trojans. SaidWill
ingham, "You have to go through
the Trojans to be a winner."
The last non-California game
of the season is at home on Nov.
16, when Stanford plays Wash
ington State University, which
suffered a 24-36 loss last year to
the Cardinal.
Finally, there will be the game
everyone watches, and, according
to Willingham, "the only rivalry
that you spend two weeks of lun
cheons at beforehand," Big
Game. Stanford has the Axe and
plans to keep it. Needless to say,
the Bears will be out for blood on
Nov. 23 at Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley.
According to Willingham,
"Each week, each game, our
stakes get higher."
What is the goal of the 1996
Stanford Cardinal? "Our goal is
to improve on last year and, as al
ways, to play a twelfth game,"
said Willingham. "Of course, wo
want to change the location."

Give Stanford football head
coach Tyrone Willingham a
challenge, and he will rise to
it.
At least that's what the evi
dence shows. Taking over the team
last year after a disappointing 3-7-
1 season, Willingham had to deal
with some very high expectations.
And he delivered.
The final record of the 1995
Cardinal football team came in at
7-4-1. Stanford fans breathed a
collective sigh of relief as their
team was transformed into a win
ner. A near-upset over the highly
touted USC Trojans and an invita
tion to the Liberty Bowl convinced
all doubters that WillinghamV
early successes were no flukes.
Despite the turnaround success
of last season, Willingham said he
intends to take his team to new
heights this year. "We definitely
left ourselves room to improve," he
said. "Each year takes on a differ
ent personality — you start fresh.
That's where we'll be."
So while it is tempting to revel
in last year's success, the team has
its eyes set on this year as its goal
and task.
Returning to the Farm for the
1996 season will be 14 starters, in
cluding seven on defense, six on of -
fense, one kicker and 35 lettermen.
While the team is losing such
prizes as quarterback Mark But
terfield, cornerback Kwame Ellis
and kicker Eric Abrams, the new
stars look to shine just as brightly.
Popping the question . ..
again
As far as the starting quarter
back is concerned, once again a
question mark stands in the place
of a name.
Despite the importance of the
position, Willingham is not con

cerned that he has yet to choose
the starter. "I'm very patient
about I the quarterback) decision,"
he said. "We don't have to have
that until Sept. 7, and we will find
the young man that gives our foot
ball team the chance to win and be
successful."
In the running this year are
Chad Hutchinson and Tim Carey,
both of whom are lacking in expe
rience hut are replete with skills.
Hutchinson, a sophomore from
Southern California, doubles his
athletic involvement as Stanford
baseball's number-two starting
pitcher. His fast ball has been
clocked at 94 mph.and in the June
1995 Major League draft, he was
selected by the Atlanta Braves in
the first round (26th pick overall).
Instead of answering the lucra
tive call to play pro ball, Hutchin
son opted to stay at Stanford to
play both baseball and football.
He red-shirted in football last
year, and his potential in this
sport lies in wait. ll' his high
school statistics are indicative of
hi. talents, Cardinal fans have
good reason to look forward to his
play. As a senior at Torrey Pines
High School in San Diego, he com
pleted 85 of 183 passes for 1,441
yards and eight touchdowns.
Standing 6 feet 5 inches and
weighing in at 230 pounds, he has
the strength, agility and skill to
fill the shoes of Butterfield, but he
does have competition.
That competition is Carey, a se
nior also from Southern Califor
nia, who became Stanford's hack
up quarterback last year after
vying for the starting spot with
Butterfield. Carey is equally inex
perienced in collegiate play (al
though he flashed in for one series
of downs during last year's Ore
iron came) hut can easilv hold his

own in any quarterback compari
son. Out of high school, he was
rated the fourth-best prep quar
terback prospect in the nation by
Super Prep and Blue Chip Report.
And it is no wonder. His accom
plishments as a high school senior
eclipse even Hutchinson's. Com
pleting2l7 0f335 passes for 3,397
yards, he tossed 35 touchdowns
and only nine interceptions. At 6
feet 4 inches and 195 pounds,
Carey is touted as a strong passer
with the ability to throw into zone
coverage. In his personal hall of
fame, he can count among his
honors the relationship of his
great une'e, Dick Van Dyke.
Whatever happens, Willing
ham insists that it is not the quar
terback alone that defines a foot
ball team. "The quarterback is a
critical part of any system," he
said, "but our leadership must
come from our entire team. Every
young man must be a leader.
You've heard the saying that the
chain is only as strong as its weak
est link? Well, we think our chain
is pretty strong."
On offense
The running backs of the 1996
Cardinal figure to be the strength
of the team. With the top four
rushers returning, the team can
only hope to turn in as big a suc
cess as last year: 1,819 yards rush
ing, the ninth-highest single-sea
son total in school history. Junior
Anthony Bookman and senior
Mike Mitchell at running back
create a potent combination with
senior fullbacks Adam Salina and
Greg Cornelia.
Bookman has led the Cardinal
in rushing for the past two sea
sons with a total of 1,449 yards.
That distance puts him in the po
sition of 11th all-time at Stanford
and only 94 yards short of the top
10. Mitchell's credits include 593
yards last year and six rushing
touchdowns. At Big Game,
Mitchell proved himself with 26
carries, 138 yards and two touch
downs.
The big fullbacks Salina and
Cornelia will be called upon to play
a diverse range of roles in the
Stanford offense. Running, pass
ing and blocking, these two will
have to do it all. While Salina is
considered the better blocker of
the two, Cornelia seems to have a
nose for the goal line, leading the
team in touchdowns last year with
nine (five rushing, four receiving).
Like all running backs, Stan
ford's rely on the strength of their
offensive line. According to Will
ingham, "[the offensive line) is an
area of concern. When you lose
guys of the caliber of left tackle
Jeff Buckey (First-Team All-Pac
-10 in 1995), center T.J. Gaynor
(three-year starter) and left guard
Ryan Waters, it's very difficult to
replace not only their talent and
experience, but the other intangi

bles they bring to the team."
The leaders of the line this year
will be seniors Brad Badger at
right guard and Nathan Parks,
who will move from right to left
tackle. Badger, who said the of
fense is "balancing out better," is
the most experienced player on
Stanford's offense, having started
in 22 of the Cardinal's last 23
games.
1 he remainder of the offensive
line, like so many positions on this
team, has yet to be determined,
but the veterans are taking a "let
the cards fall where they may" at
titude. "There's such a high
turnover rate," said Badger, "and

it's hard to fill those shoes. You've
got lots of question marks, but a
couple years ago, I was one of
those question marks."
The passing and kicking
game
One of the Cardinal's bright
spots and one of Stanford's all
time great receivers is senior
flanker Brain Manning. This will
be his final year, and he is on the
verge of breaking into the team's
top 10 list of all-time career recep
tions. So far, he has racked up 103
receptions for 1,897 yards. Senior
Marlon Evans and junior Damon
Dunn, two of the nation's top

kickoff return specialists, will
fight for the starting wide receiv
er position.
Greg Clark, who transferred to
the Farm last year and produced
23 receptions for 260 yards and
two touchdowns in his first sea
son here, will headline the Cardi
nal's trio of tight ends with se
niors Tommy Hanson and Derek
Hubbard.
In the kicking department,
someone will need to step up and
fill the big shoes left by the gradu
ation of Stanford's all-time lead
ing scorer, place-kicker Eric
Abrams. Competing for his posi
tion will be sophomore Patrick

Shinnefield, who red-shirted his
freshman year, and junior Kevin
Miller, the Cardinal's starting
punter in 1995. Miller's average
of 37.4 yards per punt last season
will most likely land him the posi
tion given that Shinnefield has
only limited playing experience at
the college level.
In defense of the Cardinal
Stanford has also lost a few
good men in the department of
defense. "The losses on the defen
sive line are substantial," said
Willingham. "The three players
we lost from last year — Jason
White, John Hebert and David

Carder — brought more to the
team than just their play on the
field." This year's leading line
men include fifth-year senior
tackle Pete Swanson and junior
ends Carl Hansen and Kailee
Wong.
While he began last season as a
back-up, Hansen replaced the in
jured Jason White as left defen
sive end in the third game, and by
the time White had recuperated,
Hansen had shown his colors and
remained in the starting lineup as
right defensive end. He ended the
season ranked fourth in the Pac
-10 in quarterback sacks with
eight.
Swanson stands as Stanford's
most experienced lineman. A se
nior, he has recorded 61 career
tackles, nine quarterback sacks
and 14 tackles-for-loss. At 6 feet 6
inches and 300 pounds, he is a
force with which to be reckoned.
Wong also has the advantage of
experience on his side. He has
played intermittently in the start
ing lineup since his freshman sea
son in 1994.
At nose tackle, junior Anthony
Willis, senior Evan Wagner and
sophomore Desmond Cook will
fight it out for the starting spot,
and at defensive end will be senior
and two-year letterman Bryan
Werner.
As far as linebackers are con
cerned, junior Chris Draft, who
also plays baseball, will head a
three-man rotation at the two in
side linebacker spots which in
cludes juniors Jon Ritchie and
Jon Haskins.
The outside linebacker lineup
returns seniors Nicodemus Watts
and Brian Batson, who has start
ed 19 games in this position over
the last three years. Watts has
proven himself as a special teams
player, but his improvements on
the outside line may make him a
big player on the Cardinal defense
this year.
Senior Leroy Pruitt returns
for his third season at corner
back, but a replacement for
Kwame Ellis at the other corner
position will be necessary for a
powerful Stanford defense. The
contenders include junior Corey
Hill and senior Alistair White. At
free and strong safety, respective
ly, seniors Josh Madsen and Eliel
Swinton come back from a solid
season. Madsen and Pruitt tied
for second in the Pac-10 with four
interceptions each.
Balance and discipline
Willingham began his coaching
career at Stanford with a promise
to balance the playing style of his
team. He came to a team on which
the offense was much stronger
than the defense and passing and
running were also unequal. In
1993, the Cardinal passed for
3,709 yards and rushed for only
700, and in 1994, Stanford passed

for 3,358 and rushed for 1,531.
Willingham put his stress on the
run and the consistency of the of
fense, and the entire team has
benefited.
Both Badger and Manning
commented that the team is "bal
ancing out better," and that will
be a major factor in determining
the future of the Cardinal's suc
cess. The replacement of losses
plays a key role in the new chem
istry of the team, but Willingham
accepts the challenge as one of
the many things that distin
guishes collegiate football from
the NFL.
How does Willingham intend
to carry out his plans? Discipline.
Pruitt said, "From the very first
meeting, we could tell I Willing
ham] was all business. This is a
disciplined team," he said. "You
come to a workout at seven in the
morning and meet him just com
ing back from a workout."
The road ahead
The first game will be played at
home on Sept. 7 against the Uni
versity of Utah. Stanford beat the
Utes last year 27-20 in the second
game of the season, but this year
Willingham said Stanford will be
a little "behind the eight-ball."
Unlike Stanford, this will be
Utah's second game, but it will be
a good challenge for the team, ac
cording to Willingham.
Next, Stanford will remain at
home while the Spartans of San
Jose State visit on Sept. 14. Wis
consin's Camp Randall Stadium
rounds out the pre-conference
games, and both Stanford and
Wisconsin will be looking to win
this year on Sept. 21 after last
year's tie (24-24).
On Oct. 5, Stanford will be at
the University of Washington to
avenge last year's game, which
Stanford lost at home, 38-28. The
next two games will be against the
University of Oregon at home
(Oct. 12) and Oregon State Uni
versity at Parker Stadium the fol-

' I'm very patient about
[the quarterback] deci
sion. We don't have to
have that until Sept. 7,
and we will find the
young man that gives
our football team the
chance to win and be
successful.'

At home, Stanford will be pur
suing Arizona State University
on Oct. 26, after a 28-30 loss last
year. The eighth game will be
played at the Rose Bowl on Nov. 2,
against the Bruins of UCLA,
where Stanford will also have a
1995 loss to rise above.
At home on Nov. 9, Stanford
will challenge the winners of last
year's Rose Bowl, with a record of
9-2-1, the USC Trojans. SaidWill
ingham, "You have to go through
the Trojans to be a winner."
The last non-California game
of the season is at home on Nov.
16, when Stanford plays Wash

suffered a 24-36 loss last year to
the Cardinal.
Finally, there will be the game
everyone watches, and, according
to Willingham, "the only rivalry
that you spend two weeks of lun
cheons at beforehand," Big
Game. Stanford has the Axe and
plans to keep it. Needless to say,
the Bears will be out for blood on
Nov. 23 at Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley.
According to Willingham,
"Each week, each game, our
stakes get higher."
What is the goal of the 1996
Stanford Cardinal? "Our goal is
to improve on last year and, as al
ways, to play a twelfth game,"
said Willingham. "Of course, wo
want to change the location."

Give Stanford football head
coach Tyrone Willingham a
challenge, and he will rise to
it.
At least that's what the evi
dence shows. Taking over the team
last year after a disappointing 3-7-
1 season, Willingham had to deal
with some very high expectations.
And he delivered.
The final record of the 1995
Cardinal football team came in at
7-4-1. Stanford fans breathed a
collective sigh of relief as their
team was transformed into a win
ner. A near-upset over the highly
touted USC Trojans and an invita
tion to the Liberty Bowl convinced
all doubters that WillinghamV
early successes were no flukes.
Despite the turnaround success
of last season, Willingham said he
intends to take his team to new
heights this year. "We definitely
left ourselves room to improve," he
said. "Each year takes on a differ
ent personality — you start fresh.
That's where we'll be."
So while it is tempting to revel
in last year's success, the team has
its eyes set on this year as its goal
and task.
Returning to the Farm for the
1996 season will be 14 starters, in
cluding seven on defense, six on of -
fense, one kicker and 35 lettermen.
While the team is losing such
prizes as quarterback Mark But
terfield, cornerback Kwame Ellis
and kicker Eric Abrams, the new
stars look to shine just as brightly.
Popping the question . ..
again
As far as the starting quarter
back is concerned, once again a
question mark stands in the place
of a name.
Despite the importance of the
position, Willingham is not con

cerned that he has yet to choose
the starter. "I'm very patient
about I the quarterback) decision,"
he said. "We don't have to have
that until Sept. 7, and we will find
the young man that gives our foot
ball team the chance to win and be
successful."
In the running this year are
Chad Hutchinson and Tim Carey,
both of whom are lacking in expe
rience hut are replete with skills.
Hutchinson, a sophomore from
Southern California, doubles his
athletic involvement as Stanford
baseball's number-two starting
pitcher. His fast ball has been
clocked at 94 mph.and in the June
1995 Major League draft, he was
selected by the Atlanta Braves in
the first round (26th pick overall).
Instead of answering the lucra
tive call to play pro ball, Hutchin
son opted to stay at Stanford to
play both baseball and football.
He red-shirted in football last
year, and his potential in this
sport lies in wait. ll' his high
school statistics are indicative of
hi. talents, Cardinal fans have
good reason to look forward to his
play. As a senior at Torrey Pines
High School in San Diego, he com
pleted 85 of 183 passes for 1,441
yards and eight touchdowns.
Standing 6 feet 5 inches and
weighing in at 230 pounds, he has
the strength, agility and skill to
fill the shoes of Butterfield, but he
does have competition.
That competition is Carey, a se
nior also from Southern Califor
nia, who became Stanford's hack
up quarterback last year after
vying for the starting spot with
Butterfield. Carey is equally inex
perienced in collegiate play (al
though he flashed in for one series
of downs during last year's Ore
iron came) hut can easilv hold his

own in any quarterback compari
son. Out of high school, he was
rated the fourth-best prep quar
terback prospect in the nation by
Super Prep and Blue Chip Report.
And it is no wonder. His accom
plishments as a high school senior
eclipse even Hutchinson's. Com
pleting2l7 0f335 passes for 3,397
yards, he tossed 35 touchdowns
and only nine interceptions. At 6
feet 4 inches and 195 pounds,
Carey is touted as a strong passer
with the ability to throw into zone
coverage. In his personal hall of
fame, he can count among his
honors the relationship of his
great une'e, Dick Van Dyke.
Whatever happens, Willing
ham insists that it is not the quar
terback alone that defines a foot
ball team. "The quarterback is a
critical part of any system," he
said, "but our leadership must
come from our entire team. Every
young man must be a leader.
You've heard the saying that the
chain is only as strong as its weak
est link? Well, we think our chain
is pretty strong."
On offense
The running backs of the 1996
Cardinal figure to be the strength
of the team. With the top four
rushers returning, the team can
only hope to turn in as big a suc
cess as last year: 1,819 yards rush
ing, the ninth-highest single-sea
son total in school history. Junior
Anthony Bookman and senior
Mike Mitchell at running back
create a potent combination with
senior fullbacks Adam Salina and
Greg Cornelia.
Bookman has led the Cardinal
in rushing for the past two sea
sons with a total of 1,449 yards.
That distance puts him in the po
sition of 11th all-time at Stanford
and only 94 yards short of the top
10. Mitchell's credits include 593
yards last year and six rushing
touchdowns. At Big Game,
Mitchell proved himself with 26
carries, 138 yards and two touch
downs.
The big fullbacks Salina and
Cornelia will be called upon to play
a diverse range of roles in the
Stanford offense. Running, pass
ing and blocking, these two will
have to do it all. While Salina is
considered the better blocker of
the two, Cornelia seems to have a
nose for the goal line, leading the
team in touchdowns last year with
nine (five rushing, four receiving).
Like all running backs, Stan
ford's rely on the strength of their
offensive line. According to Will
ingham, "[the offensive line) is an
area of concern. When you lose
guys of the caliber of left tackle
Jeff Buckey (First-Team All-Pac
-10 in 1995), center T.J. Gaynor
(three-year starter) and left guard
Ryan Waters, it's very difficult to
replace not only their talent and
experience, but the other intangi

bles they bring to the team."
The leaders of the line this year
will be seniors Brad Badger at
right guard and Nathan Parks,
who will move from right to left
tackle. Badger, who said the of
fense is "balancing out better," is
the most experienced player on
Stanford's offense, having started
in 22 of the Cardinal's last 23
games.
1 he remainder of the offensive
line, like so many positions on this
team, has yet to be determined,
but the veterans are taking a "let
the cards fall where they may" at
titude. "There's such a high
turnover rate," said Badger, "and

it's hard to fill those shoes. You've
got lots of question marks, but a
couple years ago, I was one of
those question marks."
The passing and kicking
game
One of the Cardinal's bright
spots and one of Stanford's all
time great receivers is senior
flanker Brain Manning. This will
be his final year, and he is on the
verge of breaking into the team's
top 10 list of all-time career recep
tions. So far, he has racked up 103
receptions for 1,897 yards. Senior
Marlon Evans and junior Damon
Dunn, two of the nation's top

kickoff return specialists, will
fight for the starting wide receiv
er position.
Greg Clark, who transferred to
the Farm last year and produced
23 receptions for 260 yards and
two touchdowns in his first sea
son here, will headline the Cardi
nal's trio of tight ends with se
niors Tommy Hanson and Derek
Hubbard.
In the kicking department,
someone will need to step up and
fill the big shoes left by the gradu
ation of Stanford's all-time lead
ing scorer, place-kicker Eric
Abrams. Competing for his posi
tion will be sophomore Patrick

Shinnefield, who red-shirted his
freshman year, and junior Kevin
Miller, the Cardinal's starting
punter in 1995. Miller's average
of 37.4 yards per punt last season
will most likely land him the posi
tion given that Shinnefield has
only limited playing experience at
the college level.
In defense of the Cardinal
Stanford has also lost a few
good men in the department of
defense. "The losses on the defen
sive line are substantial," said
Willingham. "The three players
we lost from last year — Jason
White, John Hebert and David

Carder — brought more to the
team than just their play on the
field." This year's leading line
men include fifth-year senior
tackle Pete Swanson and junior
ends Carl Hansen and Kailee
Wong.
While he began last season as a
back-up, Hansen replaced the in
jured Jason White as left defen
sive end in the third game, and by
the time White had recuperated,
Hansen had shown his colors and
remained in the starting lineup as
right defensive end. He ended the
season ranked fourth in the Pac
-10 in quarterback sacks with
eight.
Swanson stands as Stanford's
most experienced lineman. A se
nior, he has recorded 61 career
tackles, nine quarterback sacks
and 14 tackles-for-loss. At 6 feet 6
inches and 300 pounds, he is a
force with which to be reckoned.
Wong also has the advantage of
experience on his side. He has
played intermittently in the start
ing lineup since his freshman sea
son in 1994.
At nose tackle, junior Anthony
Willis, senior Evan Wagner and
sophomore Desmond Cook will
fight it out for the starting spot,
and at defensive end will be senior
and two-year letterman Bryan
Werner.
As far as linebackers are con
cerned, junior Chris Draft, who
also plays baseball, will head a
three-man rotation at the two in
side linebacker spots which in
cludes juniors Jon Ritchie and
Jon Haskins.
The outside linebacker lineup
returns seniors Nicodemus Watts
and Brian Batson, who has start
ed 19 games in this position over
the last three years. Watts has
proven himself as a special teams
player, but his improvements on
the outside line may make him a
big player on the Cardinal defense
this year.
Senior Leroy Pruitt returns
for his third season at corner
back, but a replacement for
Kwame Ellis at the other corner
position will be necessary for a
powerful Stanford defense. The
contenders include junior Corey
Hill and senior Alistair White. At
free and strong safety, respective
ly, seniors Josh Madsen and Eliel
Swinton come back from a solid
season. Madsen and Pruitt tied
for second in the Pac-10 with four
interceptions each.
Balance and discipline
Willingham began his coaching
career at Stanford with a promise
to balance the playing style of his
team. He came to a team on which
the offense was much stronger
than the defense and passing and
running were also unequal. In
1993, the Cardinal passed for
3,709 yards and rushed for only
700, and in 1994, Stanford passed

for 3,358 and rushed for 1,531.
Willingham put his stress on the
run and the consistency of the of
fense, and the entire team has
benefited.
Both Badger and Manning
commented that the team is "bal
ancing out better," and that will
be a major factor in determining
the future of the Cardinal's suc
cess. The replacement of losses
plays a key role in the new chem
istry of the team, but Willingham
accepts the challenge as one of
the many things that distin
guishes collegiate football from
the NFL.
How does Willingham intend
to carry out his plans? Discipline.
Pruitt said, "From the very first
meeting, we could tell I Willing
ham] was all business. This is a
disciplined team," he said. "You
come to a workout at seven in the
morning and meet him just com
ing back from a workout."
The road ahead
The first game will be played at
home on Sept. 7 against the Uni
versity of Utah. Stanford beat the
Utes last year 27-20 in the second
game of the season, but this year
Willingham said Stanford will be
a little "behind the eight-ball."
Unlike Stanford, this will be
Utah's second game, but it will be
a good challenge for the team, ac
cording to Willingham.
Next, Stanford will remain at
home while the Spartans of San
Jose State visit on Sept. 14. Wis
consin's Camp Randall Stadium
rounds out the pre-conference
games, and both Stanford and
Wisconsin will be looking to win
this year on Sept. 21 after last
year's tie (24-24).
On Oct. 5, Stanford will be at
the University of Washington to
avenge last year's game, which
Stanford lost at home, 38-28. The
next two games will be against the
University of Oregon at home
(Oct. 12) and Oregon State Uni
versity at Parker Stadium the fol-

' I'm very patient about
[the quarterback] deci
sion. We don't have to
have that until Sept. 7,
and we will find the
young man that gives
our football team the
chance to win and be
successful.'

lowing week.
At home, Stanford will be pur
suing Arizona State University
on Oct. 26, after a 28-30 loss last
year. The eighth game will be
played at the Rose Bowl on Nov. 2,
against the Bruins of UCLA,
where Stanford will also have a
1995 loss to rise above.
At home on Nov. 9, Stanford
will challenge the winners of last
year's Rose Bowl, with a record of
9-2-1, the USC Trojans. SaidWill
ingham, "You have to go through
the Trojans to be a winner."
The last non-California game
of the season is at home on Nov.
16, when Stanford plays Wash
ington State University, which
suffered a 24-36 loss last year to
the Cardinal.
Finally, there will be the game
everyone watches, and, according
to Willingham, "the only rivalry
that you spend two weeks of lun
cheons at beforehand," Big
Game. Stanford has the Axe and
plans to keep it. Needless to say,
the Bears will be out for blood on
Nov. 23 at Memorial Stadium in
Berkeley.
According to Willingham,
"Each week, each game, our
stakes get higher."
What is the goal of the 1996
Stanford Cardinal? "Our goal is
to improve on last year and, as al
ways, to play a twelfth game,"
said Willingham. "Of course, wo
want to change the location."
