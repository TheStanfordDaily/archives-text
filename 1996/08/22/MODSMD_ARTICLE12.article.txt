## AC/DC sends Shoreline on a Highway to Hell 
### Lewis Lin Editorial staff 
Enshrouded by a thick cloud of
marijuana smoke and goaded on by
excited, fist pumping fans, hard
rock's most notorious quintet of
sin, AC/DC, invaded sleepy ol'
Shoreline Amphitheater last
Thursday. Led by the human
spasm, guitarist Angus Young, and
the world's scratchiest voice box,
vocalist Brian Johnson, AC/DC
treated hard core fans to a tantaliz
ing display of pure rock.
The opening riff was unmistak
able; Young calmly and carefully
rattled away one of the most fa
mous riffs in rock history, "Thun

derstruck." He was back with his
antics, convulsing across the stage
with his patented duck walk in his
trademark schoolboy uniform.
Casting a brief glance at the video
monitors, everyone knew that
Young was a man possessed by his
guitar, and he drilled off his ax
work expressly to those who loved
it the most.
While Young's incredible guitar
work and onstage antics left the
crowd gasping for more, Johnson
was gasping for air. As always,
Johnson's raspy shrill cut in at the
most inopportune times, usually
obscuring an astonishing instru
mental passage. Luckily, the clash
ing guitars and drums succeeded in

drowning Johnson's voice.
Alas, any AC/DC product —
album, concert, or otherwise —
would not be complete without sex
ual innuendos. Songs like "The
Jack" and "Cover You in Oil" pro
vided the hormone-laden lyrics.
But it was their performance of
"Whole Lotta Rosie," when a ex
plicit, 50-foot inflatable doll graced
the stage, that sent the crowd into a
frenzy. In addition, on "Your Bo
geyman," Young gave a strip show
(and showed a little skin, too) that
put Demi Moore's million-dollar
act to shame.
But the props didn't end with
the inflatable doll. Flanked by four
massive cranes, each carrying a

dozen pulsating lights, AC/DC put
together an incredibly visually
stimulatingshow sans frivolous py
rotechnics. Also, at the onset, a
wrecking ball crashed down on a
paper building to reveal their stage,
and a replica of the Liberty Bell air
lifted Johnson above the stage.
Young and Johnson were the
centerpieces of the show. Sadly
enough, the drummer, Phil Rudd,
and the backing guitarists, Mal
colm Young and Cliff Williams,
were the second-string quarter
backs, even to the band's amazing
props. Admittedly, they did an ex
cellent job of backing Angus
Young's bone-chilling fret work.
And as backing vocalists, they gave

a much needed respite to Johnson's
out-of-breath exhortations. But on
the whole, they were listless, lack
luster performers, spending much
of their time clustered around the
drummer.
Originally, Young's conserva
tive outfit served as a paradox to
the heavy hitting rock music
AC/DC has perfected. But with a
career spanning three decades, it
seems as if the costume has been
transformed to a more meaningful
symbol; no matter how old you are,
where you are from, or when you
saw them, in 1977 or 1996, AC/DC
can still serve up that fifth grade
boyhood excitement — all without
promt: to Chuck E. Cheese.
