# WESTON
## Got Beat Up 
### 
Is Weston a reaction against
gooey bubble gum pop music or a
'90s definition of it? Perhaps a little
of both? With their sophomore
album, "Got Beat Up," Weston
shows that they are no longer the
sole heroes of bouncy teeny-boppers;
they have matured into a sound that
is a smooth mixture of pop and punk.
Just imagine that they are Green
Day on speed.
While their sound may have be
come more fine-tuned, Weston's
lyrics remain very adolescent-based.
It seems that high school was proba
bly the best period of their lives, as
evidenced by song titles such as
"Teenage Love Affair" and "Varsity
Sweater."
Instead of decreasing their musi
cal intensity, this type of open hon
esty and reminiscence only brings

out Weston's boyish charm, as when
they sing, "Your summer dresses
bore me .. .just like everything you
d 0.... I could wait around forev
er.... But I won't wait long for you."
Their peppy-poppy music also
covers serious themes. It seems that
the insecurities of adolescence
plagued the members of Weston as
much as any other teenager, as
heard on "No Fund Of Superstar"
with the lyric "I know I'll never be
the number one that ... everybody
wants to talk t0.... I know I'll al
ways be the fat kid on the bus."
The group's playful angst cou
pled with their complicated guitar
riffs make Weston very palatable
and will get you dancing in no time,
whether it be foot-tapping or pogo.
If anything, they are a refreshing
change from the over-saturated
radio play of pseudo-suicidal white
female alterna-rockers who grunt
and growl about the unfairness of
life. Some advice: Do as Weston
does and DEAL!
