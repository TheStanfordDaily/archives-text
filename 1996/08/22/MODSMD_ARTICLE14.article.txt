"Wisdom's Maw"
by Todd Brendan Fahey
Although the quality of con
temporary novels has been on a
rapid downward spiral for quite
some time, it is still an unpleas
ant surprise to come across a
work like Todd Brendan
Fahey's "Wisdom's Maw."
Touted by promoters as "the
most controversial American
novel of this decade," it is a dis
jointed, confusing and generally
horrible attempt at "historical"
fiction.
Fahey begins with the thesis
that the CIA intentionally re
leased LSD, its new "repro
gramming tool," to the Ameri
can youth of the '60s, in order to
prevent a growing collegiate re
bellion from occurring. While
this premise seems at best im
probable and at worst ridicu
lously paranoid, a good writer
could write an interesting novel

from the most inauspicious of
beginnings. One quickly real
izes that Fahey is not a good
writer.
"Wisdom's Maw" tells the
story of Franklin Moore, a bril
liant writer and Stanford
dropout who now earns his liv
ing receiving injections of vari
ous psychedelics as a research
subject. Because of his astound
ing tolerance, the CIA latches
on to him, introduces him to
LSD and makes him into a
prophet for Bay Area young peo
ple.
This obvious Timothy
Leary/Ken Kesey reference is
only the beginning of Fahey's
continuous and irritating name
dropping. Throughout the
novel's never-ending 222 pages,
he haphazardly throws in as
many historical figures as possi
ble, tying in Neal Cassady, Jack
Kerouac, Hunter S. Thompson,
Aldous Huxley and Justice Earl
Warren.
Furthermore, Fahey confus
es things dramatically by throw
ing in a CIA plan to blackmail

high ranking government offi
cials and a CIA/Mafia collabora
tion to assassinate President
Kennedy (Remember the grassy
knoll? That was the mob). The
narrative seems not only ram
bling but also very contrived.
The above flaws could be for
given if this book was actually in
teresting to read. Unfortunately,
Fahey's style is heavy-handed,
uninspired and excessively melo
dramatic. When describing the
death of an alcoholic Jack Ker
ouac, Fahey writes the following:
"He rested his head on the lip of
the cool ceramic toilet, then
went to vomit. The bowl filled
with the blood and the tissue and
the life of Jack Kerouac." What
more can be said?
The short author biography
proudly points out that Fahey
decided to publish "Wisdom's
Maw" himself, after five years
of rejections by numerous pub
lishers. His prose conspicuously
demonstrates that he was not
the wiser (pun definitely in
tended) of the two. Clearly, the
publishers had the right idea.
