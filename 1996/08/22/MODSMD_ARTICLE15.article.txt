Tofu Splendide
I invented Tofu Splendide with the cooking of my mother and grandfa
ther in mind combined with a passionate love for pungent flavors. Here is
a light and easy summer recipe that promotes mental, physical and spiri
tual well-being. This dish, while rich in protein and healthful ingredients,
is not for the gastronomical wimp. Furthermore, it is guaranteed to chase
till bad spirits away!
Ingredients: One box extra-firm tofu, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar
ginger, fresh garlic (go to Gilroy if you can!), scallions, olive oil
Directions: First, preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Chop the ginger very
finely until you have gathered about 2 tablespoons. In the same manner,
dice about 4 or 5 large cloves of garlic (I use a lot, but some may not be as
garlic-crazy). Chop two sprigs of scallions, discarding the white root and
the very tips of the green section.
Next, make a marinade using about a 11/2 to one ration of soy sauce to
vinegar. Add the garlic, scallions and ginger. Set aside.
Cut the brick of tofu into rectangles (about two by one inches). Lightly
coat each slab with olive oil and place on a baking sheet. Bake for about 35
minutes, flipping once with a spatula. You may need to bake the tofu for a
bit less or a bit more time, but you can determine that by checking to make
sure the tofu is light brown and crunchy in texture.
lie move the tofu and pour the marinade on top. Serve in a plate with
high sides (but not in a bowl). Serve immediately.
I like this dish alone as an appetizer or light meal, but it would be quite
good with rice and sauteed spinach as well. As I warned, this meal is only
for true garlic and ginger lovers, but it is guaranteed to clear the head and
refresh the spirit.
