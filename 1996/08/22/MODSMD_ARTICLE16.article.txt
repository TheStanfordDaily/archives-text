## BASQUIAT 
### 
"Basquiat" is the moving story
of an African-American artist
whose success in the white New
York art world provides both ela
tion and disdain. Elation because
Basquiat wants nothing more
than to be recognized and praised
by the art world. Disdain because
his fair-weather colleagues, en
thusiasts and critics fixate upon
his blackness without pause.
Throughout the film, we see
Basquiat discussing his dreams of
artistic glory with his girlfriend
and asking her whether she'd pre
fer to live a lush life in Oahu, Maui
or Kuaui. We witness the realiza
tion of these dreams when a draw
ing by. said "ghetto" artist on the
back of a cigarette carton sells for
-$5000. The film finishes, though,
with a strung-out Basquiat ques
tioning his allies, condemning the

art world and threatening to move
to Maui and quit painting.
Julian Schnabel, writer/director
and once-upon-a-time art circle
friend of Basquiat (anyone remem
ber Schnabel's cheesy broken dish
es?) does a decent job of projecting
into the mind of the artist. Schnabel
uses voice layovers for an imaginary
call to a suicide hotline and clips
from "Frogland," an old Russian
black-and-white film about a frog
that is eaten by a white bird, to man
ifest Basquiat's inner turmoil.
Where Schnabel fails is in his
periodic injections of surf video. On
more than one occasion Basquiat's
eyes linger in the blue sky, where
he sees a young male riding the big
waves —■ an egregious metaphor
which outdoes itself and the
Hawaiian dream theme.
As a biographical exploration
into the life of one of America's
renowned black artists, however,
"Basquiat" pushes the envelope.
Jean-Michel Basquiat, from his in
ception in the art community, ap

peared as an experiment. A kind
of, "Hey, look! It's a black man in
the New York art world!" attitude
accompanied his rising popularity.
As Schnabel aptly captures in a
scene between Basquiat and a tele
vision interviewer (Christopher
Walken), the interrogation into
his authenticity as a black artist
never subsided.
While Schnabel makes this con
flict evident and depicts the fleet
ing support of the white-washed
artistic community as ludicrous
and reprehensible, he is as guilty
as the rest of turning art into the
drama of individuals. Our memo
ry, as viewers, first recalls not the
images of a Basquiat painting, but
the story of the artist's life, or
worse still, Schnabel's star-stud
ded version of the artist's life. Do
we do the same for Van Gogh and
think of Robert Altman's "Vincent
and Theo" before we remember
the sunflowers? Arguably no.

Schnabel's "Basquiat" stares blankly as Bowie's Warhol does what
ever it is that Warhol does.
