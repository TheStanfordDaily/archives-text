# CHAIN REACTION
## 
### 
Despite all evidence to the con
trary, there are those who continue
to argue that Keanu Reeves does, in
fact, possess even an iota of acting
ability.
"Chain Reaction" proves, once
and for all, that those few dissenters
are dead wrong.
Ironically, Reeves' total incompe
tence as an actor does have its merit;
our disbelief at his sheer lack of tal
ent helps us overlook (however
briefly) the fact that "Chain Reac
tion" is a very, very bad movie in and
of itself. Yes, as if Reeves' perfor
mance isn't horrid enough, an idiotic
script, an impossibly hole-ridden plot
and a cliched premise all work to
gether to send "Chain Reaction"
straight to the top of the "Worst
Movies of the Summer" list, for
which there is some pretty intense

competition this year.
In terms of plot, what little of one
"Chain Reaction" has is simply bor
rowed from other action movies. It's
kind of like "Speed" meets "The
Fugitive." (Surprise! It's from the di
rector who brought you both!)
Reeves plays a University of Chicago
scientist (really, I swear) who stum
bles onto a huge conspiracy and is
falsely accused of murder and espi
onage.
Now, he and his beautiful side
kick (the appropriately bewildered
Rachel Weisz) must clear their re
spective names, apprehend the bad
dies, and save the world, all before
the credits roll! A formidable task...
can they do it? Does anyone care?
The movie has a chase scene, of
course, in which Reeves is almost
functional. That Ls, he's functional
until he has to utter his clutch line.
While on a fire rescue boat in the
middle of frozen-over Michi
gan, with cops and bad guys abound
ing, Weisz does what we'd all like to

do and asks Reeves, "What are you
doing?" Reeves turns to her, contorts
his face and yells back, "The best I
ran!" At this point, the entire theater
crumbled ink) laughter. Babe, if this
is the best you can do, you need to se
riously rethink what it is you're
doing.
Morgan Freeman turns in the
requisite sketchy CIA operative por
trayal, leaving us to wonder: Is he a
good guy or a bad guy? (That de
pends on your opinion of the CIA.)
His is a quality performance, as al
ways, but it seems out of place in this
tragically idiotic film.
It isn't hard to figure out the end
ing to "Chain Reaction," but I'll give
you a hint anyway. Reeves saves the
day and gets the girl. Oops, I gave it
away. Now I guess there's no point
to going to see "Chain Reaction."
But then again, unless you're a die
hard Keanu-o-phile or a complete
masochist, there wasn't one anyway.
