# KANSAS CITY
## 
### 
Robert Alt man's filmmaking ca
reer has been speckled with great
ness. Unfortunately, "Kansas
City" is no such speckle. Out of re
spect for the man who made the
daring and truly neurotic "Short
Cuts" for an audience whose atten
tion span wouldn't span anything,
I'll be kind. "Kansas City" isn't
bad, it's just not what I'd hoped for.
Miranda Richardson, Jennifer
Jason Leigh and Harry Belafonte
team up to stud this cast with
stars, but something is missing.
That something is the perplexing
way Altman films seem to demand

more of the viewer than they give;
they are cerebral cud. These films
always ask more questions than
they are willing to answer.
"Kansas City" takes place dur
ing the Depression in a black-and
white world of gangsters and fast
land nasal) talking Blondie
(Leigh). A waif with a cause,
Blondie tracks down the doped-up
wife of local politician Henry Stil
ton. Enter Richardson as the lau
danum-loving Mrs. Stilton.
Blondie needs Mr. Stilton to save
her condemned and captured hus
band, whose robberies have cost
head gangster Seldom Seen
(Harry Belafonte) his reputation.
How will she get Mr. Stilton on
her side? By turning his wife into
ransom.

Pleasantly reminiscent of "The
Player," the film opens with a 10-
minute shot of mixing voices and
billiard ball plotting taken to its
limit. Just at the point where you
want to say, "Who are these peo
ple and what are they really
doing?" the film proper begins.
This tactic is high in enticement
value.
The rest of the film twists and
tu»-ns around Blondie's past,
leaving Mrs. Stilton largely un
touched until the finale, when
her behavior reveals a little of
the horrific complacency of
"Short Cuts" and the Altman
that-was. To its credit, the film's
ending is ambiguous and under
stated. I can safely tell you that
Mr. and Mrs. Stilton ride off into

the sunset, literally.
The most exciting footage in
the entire film involves neither
plot nor dialogue. Seldom Seen
owns the popular jazz enclave
named The Hey Hey Club,
where the tunes are rambling,
ranting and raving, and women
in sequins dance with their eyes
closed. The way this music feels
is the way the film should have
looked. Unfortunately, Alt
man's "Kansas City" does not
sustain the power its ending
asks for. While the acting is im
peccable and the just-post-flap
per scenery quaint, the two
hour film is neither a challenge
nor pure entertainment. To
whomever has hidden the real
Robert Altman: I and many oth

ers anxiously await his return.
