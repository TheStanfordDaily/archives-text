## Column K. Maghsoudi Beyond self-experience 
### 
Long, long ago in sixth
grade, when I was wonder
ing what to compose for an
English class assignment, my fa
ther told me the story of one of his
own English students back in
Iran. The student wrote at length
in a dull, uninspired manner, de
picting the sights and sounds at a
beach. My father reproached him:
"But you've never even been to a
beach. Why don't you try to write
about something you've actually
experienced?" I got the hint.
Rather than continue debating
how best to conjure up the plea
sures of playing in the snow, the
waves of spicy BBQ smoke coming
from outside our muggy
Louisiana home suggested to me
that I would be much better at de
scribing the wonderful Avery Is
land process of Tobasco sauce
production. Tobasco sauce I
knew; snow, I'd never seen.
Perhaps back then the futile
efforts to improve my English de
manded this hard-line, tight-fist
ed and quite limited approach to
personal expression. But I fear
that today we are too often en
couraged to speak and act only in
accordance with our direct per
sonal experiences. As our studies,
jobs and, thus, our experiences
become increasingly specialized,
there appears to be little room for
those who refuse to stick to their
old guns (experience) and instead
become vicarious general practi
tioners (dreamers).
Only 2,500 years ago Diogenes
declared, "I am not an Athenian
or a Greek, but a citizen of the
world." Today I find myself
pompously yelping with just as
much conviction, but less than
half as much import, that I am
not permanently soldered to the
file cabinet that begins with my
birth certificate and ends with my
coupon for tomorrow's Super-
Shuttle toSFO, cataloguing in be
tween what constitutes my life's
defining moments.
Even to those of us who have
not completed CIV (hey, I'm a
transfer), it should come as no
surprise that human beings are
not bound by the ridiculously nar
row limitations of their birth and
personal experiences, that
sources of knowledge other than
those directly obtained in our own
past are readily available and
equally valid, that there are won
ders out there yet to be imagined
or discovered.
In fact, we would all be ab
solutely paralyzed if we had to
rely only on our own experiences.
Culture is what we call the
process by which the empirical
knowledge gained by past genera
tions is passed on so that the new

generation need not learn every
thing all over again. Every edu
cated child is the fortunate recipi
ent of the accumulated knowledge
of all previous generations. Just
try to imagine how much poorer
our world would be without the
knowledge and guidance handed
down by our ancestors. As Isaac
Newton put it, "We stand on the
shoulders of giants."
At the same time, does it seem
fair to demand that someone pos
sess a world of knowledge outside
of his or her individual experi
ence?
In this campaign year, we see
politicians being held responsible
for explaining clearly (presum
ably understanding as well)
everything from the analytical
grasp of economic subtleties to
the coherent applications of self
defined moral principles.
What if Bob Dole really doesn't
know if tobacco smoking is addic
tive and Bill Clinton honestly
can't account for the FBI files
found in the White House? Are
they to be condemned for lacking
omniscience? Is it fair to expect
them to competently address
questions to which even the "spe
cialists" don't have answers?
It seems that, in this sense, we
ask for more than anyone could
possibly deliver. Dole is not a
neuro-scientist, and not even the
craziest conspiracy theorists have
Clinton personally fetching the
FBI files. These are issues for
which both candidates must rely
on outside sources, so it seems fu
tile to demand that they "tell the
truth" or "come clean."
There must be some middle
ground between relying only on
personal experience and accept
ing all that outside sources, even
the most venerable, tell us. No
body ought to live within the
bounds of an "I'll believe it only
when I see it" attitude; on the
other hand, you need not go
around mouthing off on subjects
about which you know nothing
from personal experience.
I thus present a modest pro
posal to the two presidential con
tenders: You can keep giving us
conventional speeches saturated
with platitudes and generalities
like "growth, prosperity, morali
ty, right and wrong, etc.," but, at
the very least, give us a warning
when you want to say something
substantive. Gibberish about eco
nomics, morals and even life on
Mars might have its place in a
campaign, but just tell us when
you want to talk about something
you actually know about.
