# My two cents
## Jesse Oxfeld Stanford's corporate double talk 
### 
WHEN I GLANCED at the
cover of Newsweek two
weeks ago and saw an
oversized Dilbert (avec Dogbert,
bien sur) looking back at me, I an
ticipated a fun, light story about the
new cartoon wave sweeping the na
tion. The news magazine, I as
sumed, was simply devoting its
cover on a slow week to the near
sighted, necktied nebbish who is
quickly assuming the funny pages'
top spot.
What I found inside the maga
zine, however, was far from light.
Dilbert was merely a steppingstone
to an article on the trials and travails
of modern America's white-collar
workers. (Of course, If I'd read the
cover's headline, "Work Is I loll: Why
Dilbert Is No Joke," I'd have been
tipped off.) To those of us who realize
that we will, in all likelihood, some
day enter corporate life, Newsweek's
insistence that Dilbert's world isn't
so different from the real one is
downright depressing. But the even
more depressing fact, if only because
it relates to my here-and-now, was
contained in a short sidebar to the
article which listed popular eu
phemisms for layoffs.
Amid real gems from genuine
corporate behemoths (it's a "force
management program" at AT&T
and the "elimination of employ
ment security policy" at Pacßell)
was an entry into the corporate-ob
fuscation race from the only entity
on the list not a Fortune 500 com
pany. Alongside giants like General
Motors and Proctor & Gamble was
our very own Stanford University,
which a few years back came up
with the term "repositioning" to de
scribe its budget-balancing staff re
ductions.
Generally, when Stanford shows
up in the national media, its men
tion gives me a certain amount of
pride. In this case, however, I was
embarrassed. This new lexicon for
layoffs, not terribly out of place in

the corporate world, is an example
of doublespeak at its worst. The
term "downsizing" (which now
sounds refreshingly straightfor
ward ) and its more creative descen
dants were created specifically to
put a pretty face on an ugly fact:
that hard-working, often long-serv
ing employees can, and do, get fired.
It is neither surprising nor par
ticularly upsetting that consumer
products corporations engage in
such verbal sleight-of-hand
(sleight-of-mouth?). After all, for
such a company to be successful, it
is necessary that the public at large
maintain a favorable impression of
it. That's why companies advertise,
and that's why they engage in pub
lic relations. But for a university to
be circumspect about its actions is
entirely inappropriate.
If nothing else, universities
should be places where truth is
sought and new ideas tested. The
tenure system, unique to academia,
is predicated upon the idea that fac
ulty members should be free to say
and write what they believe with
out fearing that their positions
would be jeopardized by so doing.
While the maintenance of the
tenure system indicates that uni
versities remain committed to lofty
ideals of free speech and thought,
Stanford's Orwellian doublespeak
about its business practices raises
doubts about the depth of that com
mitment.
I do not question that during a
time of shrinking budgets, Stanford
and other educational institutions
must engage in increasingly corpo
rate practices to make ends meet. If
it was truly necessary, and if it
spared some cuts to academic areas,
it was appropriate for Stanford to
engage in layoffs. What I do ques
tion is at what point the corporati
zation of Stanford begins to affect
the basic character of the Universi
ty. Precisely because Stanford is a
university it must not be in the

business of positively spinning its
business decisions. If the Universi
ty is to be respected as a beacon of
truth, it must in all its operations
call a spade a spade. When it fires
people, it must say so.
Once we accept that universities
can engage in such kinds of manip
ulative public relations, we run the
risk that the flow of information es
sential to education might be im
peded. Take, for example, a recent
case at the University of Wisconsin.
Like many other universities (in
cluding Stanford) looking for new
sources of revenue, Wisconsin's
athletics department negotiated a
deal with a shoe corporation — but
their deal had an unusual clause.
Under the original version of the
five-year, $7.9 million agreement,
Wisconsin's administration agreed
that it would not "disparage"
Reebok, and that it would "prompt
ly take all reasonable steps neces
sary to address any remark by any
university employee ... that dis
parages Reebok."
Clearly, in the Wisconsin case,
the university's move into the cor
porate world went a step too far.
But it took a massive protest by stu
dents and professors before the ad
ministration and Reebok agreed to
remove the non-disparagement
clause, as it's come to be called,
from the final contract.
Obviously, the Stanford situa
tion has not degenerated (one
would hope) to the point where a
Wisconsin-type contract would ever
be tolerated. But it does appear that
the University's doublespeak is
trickling into academic areas. After
all, even in the post-Mahood grad
ing era, no student at Stanford
"fails." A class is simply "not
passed."
