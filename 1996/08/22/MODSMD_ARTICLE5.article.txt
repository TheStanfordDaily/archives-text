## Burrito battle Pollo's predicted to force competition 
### Vicky Anning 
Bon Appetit, the food ser
vices provider at Tresidder
Union, may face some stiff com
petition this fall as the race
commences to open the new
Polio's restaurant before stu
dents return in September.
The Mexican fast-food restau
rant chain is rushing to open its
doors to the Stanford communi
ty by Sept. 25. The space where
Baywash Cleaners, Cardinal Col
lection and ASSU lecture Notes
once stood has already been gut
ted in order to make way for the
new restaurant.
"We are working really hard
to meet the deadline," said
Leonie Batkin, lands manager
at Stanford Management Com
pany, which leases space at
Tresidder. "If [Polio's] cannot
open in time for the fall, we will
have them operating out of a
tent."
According to Ray Klein, pres
ident and founder of the Polio
Key restaurant chain, the Stan
ford premises will be designed
to seat around 100 customers,
with additional patio seating
outside. "There will also be a
separate room where students
can relax and watch TV," Klein
said.
Klein has also requested a
beer and wine license for the
new premises. He plans to offer
a selection of Mexican beers and
four draft beers to rival the Cof
fee House's selection.
Rey Hernandez, general
manager of Bon Appetit, which
oversees the Coffee House
the only premises on campus li
censed to sell alcohol — conced
ed that the new competition will
affect his sales. "Polio's is the
new game in town," he said,
"and we think people will be
heading in that direction."
However, Polio's will not be
able to duplicate the history and
atmosphere of the Coffee

House, Hernandez said. The
Coffee House has traditionally
been a student hangout, serving
beer, burritos and other snacks
to as many as 1,200 people each
day during its busiest time in
May.
La.st year, the Coffee House's
opening hours were extended to
2 a.m. each weekday and until
midnight from Friday to Sunday.
Polio's opening hours this year
will be from 9 a.m. until 11 p.m.
during the week, with an exten
sion until 1 a.m. on Fridays.
Hernandez, who is also in
charge of the Tresidder cafete
ria, sandwich bar and fast-food
counter, caters for up tc 3,000
people a day during the school
year.
According to Hernandez,
there has been a steady decline
in demand for evening dinner
over the last few years. Because
of this decline and the arrival of
the new competition, he is not
planning to offer dinner this
year. "The pie is not that big,
and there are only so many
pieces in it,"he said.
The reaction among Stan
ford students and staff to
Polio's arrival so far has been
generally positive: "I love
Polio's," said junior Dana Fox.
"It's cheap. You can get a good
meal there for $2."
Fox said she would like to see
the restaurant stay open as late
as possible to discourage stu
dents from drinkingand driving
off campus. "The union should
be more of a social place," she
said.
The retail manager at
Tresidder's cafeteria, Richard
Calbow, agreed that competi
tion is healthy. "Competition is
always good for the customer,"
he said. "And I know that we
can compete on taste as well as
price."
The race is on at Tresidder
Union, and, as Hernandez said,
"May the best burrito win."
