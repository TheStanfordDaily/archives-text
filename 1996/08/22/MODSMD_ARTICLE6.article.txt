# Gunman disrupts MCATs

### Emily Richmond 
A masked gunman burst into
an MCAT examination in San
Francisco on Saturday, startling
test-takers and proctors and set
ting off a bizarre chain of events
which resulted in minor injuries
and the would-be robber's appre
hension.
The incident occurred at the
Nob Hill Masonic Center shortly
after the start of the afternoon
session of the six-hour exam. In
spector Michael Maloney of the
San Francisco Police Depart
ment's Robbery Division said the
young man, whose age and identi
ty have not yet been confirmed,
entered the test room armed with
a pellet gun and wearing a ski
mask.
The suspect demanded a copy
of the exam from one of the proc
tors, who then handed the suspect
a writing sample instead, Maloney
said. The gunman left the room
briefly, then re-entered the audi
torium and threw the writing
sample on the floor.
The gunman told the proctor
that he wanted the physical sci
ences section of the exam, not the
writing sample. The proctor §aid
the sections were put away, and
pointed to a taped box under her
desk.
Maloney said the would-be rob
ber attempted to open the box,
laying his gun down on the proc
tor's desk as he tried to get a bet
ter grip.
According to Maloney, the
proctor "saw an opportunity to
reduce harm," picked up the gun
and moved away from the desk.
The robber charged toward the
proctor and struck her several
times, attempting to wrest the
gun from her. Several students
left their seats and attempted to
restrain the suspect.
In an attempt to help, a Mason
ic Center custodian entered the
room, and, seeing the proctor
with the gun, mistook her as the
threat and struck her over the
head with a metal folding chair.
Police said she was not seriously
injured.
The police, having received nu
merous cellular phone calls from
students inside the auditorium,
arrived moments later, said one
student witness who asked not to
be identified.
"The whole thing was over so
quickly, and suddenly the room
was full of police, and they took
the guy away. He was still wear
ing the ski mask," the student
said.
Once in custody, the suspect
declined to reveal his name but
told police that he was from Pun
jab, in northern India. Pending
age verification, the suspect is
being held at the Youth Guidance
Center in San Francisco.
Fred Virgilio, the center's di
rector, expressed skepticism that
the young man is a minor.
"We still don't know who this
kid is," said Virgilio. "He said he
had a friend who took the exam in

the morning and did poorly, and
he was trying to invalidate the
exam. . . . We haven't yet asked
the court to order a dental exami
nation [to make a more definite
age identification]," he added.
The unknown suspect's true
age and motivation have thus far
eluded the police.
"He appears to be over 18, but
when I talked to him, I'm not
sure," Maloney said. "He said he
met a girl on the street and she
asked him to disrupt the test, but
he only knew her first name and it
wasn't found on the test roster."
The suspect also claimed to be a
high-school dropout, which trou
bled Maloney, who noted the sus
pect's extensive language skills
and British accent.
"He can't hide his articulation.
His vocabulary doesn't match his
claimed experiences," Maloney
said.
Two similar incidents involving
stolen MCAT exams have attract
ed international intention. In
1994, a man attempted to bolt
from a UCLA test site with an
exam but was caught. In London
last year, a man stole a test andes

caped and is still being sought.
The possibility of the three inci
dents being related is being ex
plored, Maloney said.
Maloney expressed doubt that
the suspect was acting impulsively
for a stranger he met on the street.
"If he's part of an organized sys
tem, he has a good reason to lie and
not be discovered," Maloney said.
The district attorney's office is
planning to file charges, including
four counts of armed robbery, two
counts of attempted robbery, one
count of battery and two counts of
brandishing a weapon.
Of the 156 students registered
for the exam, five elected to leave
before the afternoon session was
continued. MCAT officials plan to
contact each student individually
and offer them a re-test, refund or
cancellation of their scores, said
Patricia Green, spokeswoman for
the Association of American Med
ical Colleges, which oversees the
MCATs. Green said she did not
know if only the afternoon session
would be re-offered or if students
would be allowed to combine
morning and afternoon scores
from separate days.
