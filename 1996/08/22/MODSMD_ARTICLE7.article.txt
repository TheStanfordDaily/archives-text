# Stress level already high for pre-meds
##

The stress level in the Ma
sonic Center was higher than
the Golden Gate Bridge on Sat
urday, and that was before the
masked gunman even entered
the room.
Competing with premedical
students across the country,
the individuals taking the
MCAT had spent months, and
in some cases years, preparing
for one exam.
At the more competitive
schools, a person's MCAT score
and grade point average are
often combined by admissions
officers and funneled through a
computer program. Students
whose combined numbers fall
below the school's median
range are not sent a second,
more complete evaluation,
which includes recommenda
tions and a personal statement.
The process culminates in an
invitation for an interview.
Larry Chu, a third-year med
ical student at Stanford, said he
has personal concerns about
premedical students and the
exam. Chu is a member of the
School of Medicine admissions
team and the author of the
Medical Student Survival
Guide.
Chu said students from
across the country have con
tacted him at his Weh site, Med-
World, expressing their anxi
ety.
"[The students] over-em
phasize their MCAT scores,"
Chu said. "It's a high stress sit
uation, and the students think

their score governs their
chances of getting into medical
school."
Chu acknowledged that
Stanford uses a computer pro
gram to screen some students
out but insisted that a strong
GPA can sometimes compen
sate for a low MCAT score, mov
ing a student onto the next level
of the process.
"In my opinion, the MCAT
score becomes almost the least
important part of your applica
tion at this point. It's impor
tant, yes, but it doesn't out
weigh other aspects," said Chu.
The admissions process at
Stanford's Medical School is
one of the most selective in the
country, said Judy Cownell, as
sistant director of Medical
School admissions. For the
1995-96 academic year, Stan
ford accepted less than 3.5 per
cent of its applicants. Harvard,
whose medical school was
ranked number one by U.S.
News & World Report last year,
accepted 5.6 percent for the
same year.
The competition for the top
medical programs shows no
sign of abating, said Ruby
Mason, apre-profession adviser
at the Undergraduate Advising
Center.
"Across the country, the
field of health care is being
overwhelmed with applicants,
and that might mean more
over-anxious students, but it
also means more students "who
are genuinely committed to a
medical profession," Mason
said.
