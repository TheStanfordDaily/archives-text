## Researchers cope with life after 'life on Mars'

doesn't have to imagine anymore
what it would be like to discover
life on another planet. Two weeks
ago the story broke that his lab,
along with collaborators at the
Johnson Space Center, had detect
ed molecules suggestive of biologi
cal origin on a rock from Mars.
Since that day, Zarc has been won
dering if there is life after life on
Mars.
"My whole life has been con
sumed by this," Zare said. "Of
course I thought the results would
be of interest to the public, but I
had no idea it would cause such a
fervor," he added.
Zare's lab used a technique
called two-step laser microscopy,
which he developed, to detect or
ganic molecules in the rock that
suecested there mav have been

previous microbiotic activity on
the planet.
The excitement over the pota
to-sized rock that came to the Zare
lab under secret code names like
Goofy, Mickey and Minnie has
generated over 1.3 million hits a
day on the Mars life material Web
site, according to Don Savage at
NASA. Savage also indicated that
the story got about 1,000 televi
sion news stories each day for five
days.
According to Zare, "We knew
about these results six months
ago, but we needed to keep it a se
cret. It wasn't published yet, and
we wanted time to confirm our re
sults without worrying about com
petitors."
"I swear I wasn't the one who
leaked the story to the press, but I
did learn that I would make a very
bad spy," Zare continued. "I run
an open lab, and it was hard not to

tell people, because the fun thing
about science is sharing your ex
citing results. You learn from
sharing, and get new perspectives
about what to do next. I didn't like
not being able to tell anyone," he
said.
Simon Clemett, a graduate stu
dent who worked with Zare on the
Mars rock project, said the lab's
findings were leaked much sooner
than expected. "We were in the
process of preparing our response,
and we'd been writing the paper
for six months, so we did have time
to think about it. But I don't think
we were psychologically prepared
for the amount of attention we
have received," Clemett said.
According to Clemett, "After
the story was leaked we had to go
to Washington immediately. I
barely had time to pack. We
stepped off the plane and CNN
was already there with a huge
camera in our faces. At that point
we thought we still couldn't talk
about it, so we asked the reporter
to leave us alone and he got really
mad."
"Finally we had the news con
ference. The people setting it up
thought the excitement had died
down and there wouldn't be very
many people there. But when we
got to the room it was wall to wall
cameras. It was only supposed to
last 20 minutes, but we ended up
answering questions for over two
and a half hours," Clemett said.
In addition to generating media
interest and capturing the imagi
nation of millions around the
world, the announcement has
brought the attention of fringe el
ements to the Zare lab. "I spoke
with a man who saw rocks falling
from a UFO and wanted to bring
them into our lab for analysis.
We've been getting calls like this
all week," Zare said.
Liz Edlund, Zare's secretary,
has found her job description ex
panding. Not only has Edlund
taken on the role of ad hoc publicist
for Zare, but she has also found
herself acting as a counselor for

some of the more troubled callers.
Zare complemented Edlund on her
quick thinking when she "surfed
the Web to find an alien abduction
support group while talking with a
distraught caller."
Much of the negative corre
spondence the lab has received

comes Irom those who believe the
entire report is a NASA hoax to get
more federal money. Clemett, who
did most of the actual lab work,
takes particular offense at these
critics.
"This is my thesis work,"
Clemett said. "I have no doubt
that NASA will milk the publicity
for all it's worth, but I spent the
last two years of my life cranking
on this project. Mapping the loca
tion of these molecules on the rock
was incredibly tedious. Further
more, much of the work had to be
done in the middle of the night,
when no one else was around. If
someone slammed a door or shook
the floor when they walked by it
would throw the sample out of
alignment and I'd have to start all
over. I am certainly not part of a
NASA conspiracy," Clemett con
cluded.
"It's amazing how this story po
larizes people. It's obviously af
fecting people profoundly on both
sides of the issue," Zare said.
According to Edlund, "The Sci
ence paper didn't come out on the

West coast until Friday [Aug. 16].
Most people had formed an opin
ion by then based solely on what
they had heard from the media.
They hadn't even seen the data
yet. It concerns me that people
only seem interested in the sensa
tional side of the story and don't
seem to care about the science or
what's really been discovered."
Zare agreed. "We don't really
know if there is life on Mars. What
we have is the first, tentative evi
dence that there could have been,
but anything is possible. Nobody
seems to hear that part."
"People ask me if I think there
is life on Mars, and my answer is
that I don't know. Lately I've been
wondering if there is intelligent
life anywhere on our planet,"
joked Zare.
Clemett said the experience has
been "exhilarating and depressing
at the same time. You're in the lab
playing with a piece of Mars; it's
pretty amazing if you think about
it. Hut after two years it becomes
routine and you just don't think
about it after awhile. The tech
nique we developed allows us to
examine extremely small samples.
The work we've done on the Mars
rock isn't nearly the most techno
logically challenging thing we've
done. The Mars rock was like a
boulder compared to what we were
used to working with."
Clemett realizes the implica
tions of their results are controver
sial, but he "doesn't like being
under this kind of scrutiny. There
are three features of the Mars rock
that suggest it contained primitive
life. If the rock was from Earth,
any one of these features would be
enough to convince most scien
tists. Hut I suppose extraordinary
claims require extraordinary evi
dence."
Clemett concluded, "The dan
gerous thing about getting big re
sults is that it can undermine
what you do in the future."
Zare concurred. "What could
we possibly do for an encore?" he
said.
