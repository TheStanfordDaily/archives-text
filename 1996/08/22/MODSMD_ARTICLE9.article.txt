# Student Evan Chen loses battle with leukemia
## 
### Elisabeth Traugott Contributing writer 
Stanford student Evan Chen died on July
28 at his Walnut Creek home after a long
bout with leukemia and complications from
his bone marrow transplant last October.
Chen, 20, who would have been a junior this
year, died in his sleep with close friends and
family by his side.
He will be remembered for his many con
tributions to Stanford life, including his
place on the varsity fencing squad, which he
walked onto his freshman year. He was also
a member of the Lambda Phi Epsilon fra
ternity and had an interest in both engi
neering and biology. He planned to someday
become a doctor.
He will also be remembered by many sim
ply as a friend. Yul Julius Kwon, his best
friend, led efforts to find a bone marrow
donor for Chen which resulted in an inter
nntional search. Over 1,000 people volun

teered to have their blood typed at Stanford
alone, most of whom were of Asian descent,
as people of similar ethnicity are more likely
to have matching marrow types.
With help from the Asian American
Donor Program, a donor from Taiwan was
eventually found for Chen. In the process
more than 20 other cancer victims were
matched with potential volunteers.
"It was easy for me to get involved. ... To
feel a sense of urgency was natural," said
Kwon.
In May of 1995, Chen, who had been feel
ing unusually tired, made a routine visit to
Cowell Health Center, where a series of
blood tests revealed he had been stricken
with a rare form of cancer, biphenotypic
leukemia. He was immediately hospitalized.
In the ensuing weeks, efforts to combat
the disease with chemotherapy were eventu
ally successful, and doctors felt Chen was
strong enough to endure a transplant. Rone
marrow from the Taiwanese donor was har

vested in July 1995 and was transplanted
into Chen's body in early October of the same
year.
Chen then suffered two major setbacks
in the late autumn of 1995, both of which
were fought off by experimental drugs. In
both cases he developed graft v. host dis
ease, or "GVH," in which the body rejects
the donated marrow. Roth his liver and his
digestive system were affected.
Throughout spring quarter, Chen im
proved steadily. He was able to go to movies
and his medication was reduced, although
he had trouble gaining weight. His condi
tion suddenly worsened in July when he de
veloped an infection which led to "a cascad
ing effect where all kinds of complications
came up," Kwon said.
Doctors told Kwon his friend's death was
ultimately due to the fact that the marrow
was not a perfect match.
Kwon said he will mostly miss the images
he had of Chen before he got sick. Kwon and

Chen had been friends
since junior high school
and were roommates at
Stanford.
"I am really proud of my
friend in those last few
days. I will always be grate-

ful for the time I spent with him. He never
pave up even knowing there was no hope."
Chen is survived by his parents and his
sister, Emily, who is also a Stanford stu
dent.
A memorial service to honor Evan Chen
will be held in Memorial Church on Sept. 26
at 1 p.m. and will be followed by a reception.
In lieu of flowers, the Chen family has re
quested that contributions be sent to Evan's
memorial fund. Checks made payable to
Stanford University should be sent to the Of
fice of Development, Gift Processing, 301
Encina Hall, Stanford, CA 94305-6076. They
ask that contributors specify that funds are
for the Evan Chen Memorial Fund.
