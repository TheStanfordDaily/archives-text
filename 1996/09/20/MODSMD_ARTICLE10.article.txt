# Our Gentleman Called Montoya
## Tête-à-tête with the Dean of Undergraduate Admissions 
### 
I ames Montoya's professional life has been spent in private institu
nons. Before becoming dean of undergraduate admission and financial
aids at Stanford in 1991, Dean Montoya had served as dean of admis
sions at both Vassar and Occidental Colleges. Yet in light of the polit
ical assault on affirmative action and increasing governmental hostili
ty to financial support of higher education, Montoya's role has neces
sarily become more public. One week after the November election,
Editor in Chief Mia Sara Bruch met with Dean Montoya to talk about
social change, social conflict and college admissions.
This month, California voted to ban state-sponsored affirmative action.
Does Stanford receive state funding that wouldforce us to comply with the
new law?
No. In fact, because we receive federal funding we are required to
have an affirmative action program. We will not feel the impact even
with California's financial aid program because that funding goes
directly to students and not the institution. And yet students and fam
ilies outside the Stanford community will not necessarily make the dis
tinctions that we make on campus. Students are no longer in a posi
tion where they can assume that all schools have affirmative action
programs. So we will have to make a special effort to help people
understand the difference between a public university and a private
university. I think it's fair to say that this is one moment in our educa
tional history when we are very happy to be a private university, where
we can have an admissions program that we think produces the acad
emic community which will benefit best from our resources.
Stanford is now in a unique position; a private institution in technical vio-
Lition of public law.
It's important to remember that we are not violating the law
because we are a private institution, and the law only pertains to state
institutions. It allows us as a private university to set our own course,
and that is something which is very important to me as an educator.
And it's clear that the role we play is even more important as a result of
the California Civil Rights Initiative. We are playing an important role
as a premier institution, not only in the state but in the country, in
articulating to the public why we continue to do what we do and hop
ing that will have a positive impact on public policy in the future.
What is your larger vision for charting a vision of college admissions in the
face of a increasingly hostility in the political sphere to your policies?
That brings up the issue of financial aid and funding. Federal and
state funding constitute less that 20 percent of our financial aid. If we
ever face not being able to accept federal funds for financial aid as a
result of our affirmative action policies or our policies toward immi
grants, we are in a position to continue to fund financial aid. But now
that we have a Democratic president for at least the next four years, I'm
very optimistic. I think the president recognizes that as a nation we
need to continue to make special efforts to include individuals who
have not been included in the past. At a time when it would have been
very easy for Clinton to stand back on issues related to race and gen
der, he chose not to.
The passage ofProposition 2 op reflected the failure of the left to answer one
ofthe more responsible criticisms of affirmative action, namely that it offers
privileges even to the most advantaged members of certain demographic
groups while denying them to even the most disadvantaged of others. How
does Stanford account for socioeconomic disadvantages in admissions?
What Stanford has done particularly well, I believe, is to look at
each applicant as an individual. The son or daughter of a migrant farm
worker is viewed differendy than the son or daughter of the dean of
admissions at Stanford — or, as I was viewed, as the son of a barber

and a housekeeper. Class is a factor in that one cannot evaluate the
experience and the challenges a student has faced in becoming an
applicant to a prestigious university without looking at the total pic
ture — including socioeconomic background. Our application
requests such information as an applicant's parents education, occu
pation, high school, the area a student lives in — and that information
is very telling.
Most people are surprised to know that affirmative action pro
grams, even though they are designated for Mexican Americans,
Native Americans and African Americans, do not limit our ability to
recognize diversity. Our criteria for admissions speak directly to our
recognition of students who come from backgrounds where they have
faced hardship — for example, if they are recent immigrants to this
country, or if they are the first in their family to attend college. Having
only three groups designated as affirmative action groups does not
limit our opportunity to recognize different types of diversity.
I think alumni are often surprised to find out that as we have
become more diverse ethnically, we have, based on traditional stan
dards such as grades and SAT scores, become more competitive —
much more so then when many of them were enrolled in the '50s, the
'60s or even the '70s, when I was an undergraduate here. Standards
across all ethnic lines are tougher.
How can the University justify offering preferential treatment to children
of alumni — who often come from the highest social tiers of the applicant
pool—preferential admission?
That policy comes from a recognition that we depend very heav
ily on alumni support in order to maintain the quality of education at
the University. In order for me to assist in maintaining need-blind
admissions over the next few generations, I need to make certain that
we depend more on our financial aid endowment than on our operat
ing budget (or on federal support, for that matter). About 50 percent
of Stanford's financial aid budget comes from the operating budget,
and significandy less comes from endowment. I compare our situation
to Princeton's, where 97 percent of the financial aid budget comes
from the endowment. Being a steward of need-blind admissions
requires that we move forward in trying to raise funds. For me, it's a
question of balance; in a given year, the percentage of Stanford legacies
enrolled in a given class ranges from 11 to 14 percent at most. Financial
aid is, of course,'only one small part of the University's budget, but
there are other groups within the University who depend on the sup
port of alumni.
This summer, The New York Times published a story titled "Scholarships
for the Rich," which sounded a death knell of sorts for need-blind admis
sions. Is Stanford's commitment to need-blind admissions financially sus
tainable as tuition costs continue to rise and federal support for aid is cut?
I think the article does reflect what is taking place at some colleges.
The New York Times mentioned Princeton and Harvard as two insti
tutions which have the resources to resist this trend. Well, Stanford is
included in that group. However, it does mean that if we invest now
in terms of building our endowment then we will be in a better posi
tion to preserve need-blind aid. Financial aid allows us to bring in the
very best students to the University, and I feel incredibly fortunate to
be able to read applications and not have to worry about where fund
ing is going to come from. As we look at issues of diversity, it is impor
tant that we look at affirmative action programs. But it is just as impor
tant that we look at the issue of financing the education of outstand
ing students whose families do not have the resources to send them
here.

across all ethnic lines are tougher.
How can the University justify offering preferential treatment to children
of alumni — who often come from the highest social tiers of the applicant
pool—preferential admission?
That policy comes from a recognition that we depend very heav
ily on alumni support in order to maintain the quality of education at
the University. In order for me to assist in maintaining need-blind
admissions over the next few generations, I need to make certain that
we depend more on our financial aid endowment than on our operat
ing budget (or on federal support, for that matter). About 50 percent
of Stanford's financial aid budget comes from the operating budget,
and significandy less comes from endowment. I compare our situation
to Princeton's, where 97 percent of the financial aid budget comes
from the endowment. Being a steward of need-blind admissions
requires that we move forward in trying to raise funds. For me, it's a
question of balance; in a given year, the percentage of Stanford legacies
enrolled in a given class ranges from 11 to 14 percent at most. Financial
aid is, of course,'only one small part of the University's budget, but
there are other groups within the University who depend on the sup
port of alumni.
This summer, The New York Times published a story titled "Scholarships
for the Rich," which sounded a death knell of sorts for need-blind admis
sions. Is Stanford's commitment to need-blind admissions financially sus
tainable as tuition costs continue to rise and federal support for aid is cut?
I think the article does reflect what is taking place at some colleges.
The New York Times mentioned Princeton and Harvard as two insti
tutions which have the resources to resist this trend. Well, Stanford is
included in that group. However, it does mean that if we invest now
in terms of building our endowment then we will be in a better posi
tion to preserve need-blind aid. Financial aid allows us to bring in the
very best students to the University, and I feel incredibly fortunate to
be able to read applications and not have to worry about where fund
ing is going to come from. As we look at issues of diversity, it is impor
tant that we look at affirmative action programs. But it is just as impor
tant that we look at the issue of financing the education of outstand
ing students whose families do not have the resources to send them
here.
