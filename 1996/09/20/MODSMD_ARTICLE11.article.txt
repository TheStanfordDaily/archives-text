## HOUSING 
### Mia Sara Bruch 
It's not something many undergraduates think about.
Its the status quo, which lends it a sort of established credibility. Perhaps, during your first week at
Stanford, you wandered over with the rest of your dorm to the Deke Jell-O party and started to won
der. Or perhaps you went through sorority rush your freshman year and wondered why you had to
hike out to Escondido Elementary School while your male dormmates just trundled over to SAE and
Kappa Sig. It's a fundamental principle of the Greek system at Stanford — sororities are not housed.

T
JL his would not pose a problem for the University if, as at many
other schools, housed fraternities resided in private buildings
owned by the chapter. But they don't. Stanford provides University
housing — and in the case of Sigma Chi, which owns its own
house, University land — to the fraternities. Lisa Rubin, a member
of Chi Omega and president of the Intersorority Council, explains:
"If the University wasn't financially supporting the fraternity hous
es, both in terms of supplying them with land and facilities and
providing money for improvements, then there wouldn't be an
argument. A house equals financial support on the part of the
University. Over the last two summers, the University has com
pletely remodeled the Delta Kappa Epsilon and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon houses at its own expense. These houses are getting new
furniture, new carpeting, new everything. They have to maintain
certain standards in order to keep the house. But the University is
not offering these benefits to women of any group. Men have many
more options." Under the current housing scheme, the University
is sponsoring a fundamental inequity.
This arrangement creates both legal as well as ethical dilemmas
for the University. Stanford provides an equal number of men's and
women's beds in all undergraduate residences to ensure the barest
legal compliance with Title IX. Enacted in 1972 as part of the
Federal Education Amendments, Title IX prohibits gender dis
crimination in any program offered by an institution of higher edu
cation that receives federal binding. Nonetheless, Stanford's present
housing system appears to violate Tide IX because men's groups,
albeit a limited number, are offered exclusive housing while

women's groups are unilaterally denied a housing option. Adam
Gopin, vice president of the Interfraternity Council and a member
of Kappa Sigma, says,"The University has treated the women's
groups as if they're of no consequence. They don't have anything —
even meeting space — to call their own."
Sororities aside, the system also creates a larger inequity in
housing opportunities between undergraduate women and men.
Although the total number of residential beds on campus are equal
for men and women, the total number of Row housing spaces for
men far exceed those for women because of housed fraternities,
even counting all-female Roth House. (The Row is defined by
Housing and Dining Services to include the Mayfield houses, the
Lomita Houses and Co well Cluster.) Female undergraduates have
long suspected that their Draw numbers have to be better than
those of men for equivalent housing. And in the case of Row hous
ing, this seems to be correct. Over the past six years, about
one-third of undergraduate men have been able to live on the Row,
compared to only 20 percent of undergraduate women. Women
and men do not have equal access to the same type of housing. And
the type of housing in question happens to be one of the most cov
eted on campus. Although many righdy point out that the popu
larity of Row housing has fluctuated over time at Stanford, it pre
sents numerous objective advantages for students. Housing on the
Row often means the luxuries of personal space in a two-room
double and a private cook and always means open access to the
kitchen, a significant perquisite to food service refugees. As Rubin
puts it, "How you draw determines how you eat."
Beyond the question of legality, the current housing system is

clearly unfair to a significant portion of the undergraduate popula
tion. It seems astonishing that the University has not addressed an
inequality so enmeshed in the fabric of student life — even the rel
atively recent report from the Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities, issued in 1984, never mentions the possibility that the
policy of not housing sororities might constitute discrimination. In
contrast to its efficient eviction of self-defense classes for women
from campus in 1993 based on a Title IX complaint, the University
seems to have been either oblivious or apathetic to an inequality
which is staring it in the face.
But there is a growing sense among administrators and stu
dents alike that the system must be modified. Housing is one of the
primary items on the agenda of the Greek Task Force, formed by
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds last
spring to conduct a sweeping review of Greek life at the University.
And many students feel that the current systems inequality can be
tolerated no longer. A sorority member who wished to remain
anonymous attests, "Last year, there was a group of women in the
Greek system who wanted to file a Tide IX suit, myself among
them. The University administration — at the very least the Dean
of Students Office and the Office of Student Activities — was well
aware of this. A campus administrator told us 'Wait until the Greek
Task Force releases it recommendations because there's no need to
be adversarial with the administration if they are going to recom
mend housing.' I take that in good faith, and I'm willing to wait.
But let's say the report does get released and there's no recommen
dation for sorority housing. Then I will guarantee you that a group
of women will file a suit."
I low did Stanford end up with a system which seems so clear
ly unfair, and in some respects, profoundly illogical? An examina
tion of the problems of the current housing arrangement is com
plicated by a long history of relationships — formal and informal
— which have defined the role of Greek organizations at the
University.
Mens and women's Greek letter organizations have been affil
iated with Stanford since the University's first years, and there have
been up to 34 groups on campus at different times in the

University's history. Many of them built houses for their members,
some of which are still standing today in the form of Bechtel
International Center (Zeta Psi) Muwekma-tah-ruk (Chi Omega)
and Storey (Delta Gamma).
Up until World War 11, sororities housed a large proportion of
upperclass women. But with the abolition of the so called "500
Rule," which limited the number of undergraduate women at
Stanford to 500, competition for bids became increasingly severe
and the sorority system began to turn ugly. Many a Stanford stu
dent is familiar with tales of the suicides of unhappy women who
did not receive an invitation to join a sorority, with sites of the act
ranging from Hoover Tower to Lake Lagunita. Though there are no
records of any suicides, by 1943 it had become apparent to both stu
dents and administrators that the system was operating in an
unhealthy manner, and after several attempts to revise the Rush
process, the Board ofTrustees voted to ban sororities from the cam
pus in 1944. Fraternities were not included in the discussion which
led to the ban, in pan because they were largely inactive at the time
due to the service of men in the war. Nanci Howe, director of the
Office of Student Activities, points out, "That's when the inequity
in the system began."
Until the mid-19705, sororities remained banned from the
University. With the advent of Tide DC, University administrators
acknowledged the need to permit sororities to organize on campus
in order to comply with both federal law as well as Stanford's own
anti-discrimination clause. There was no discussion at the time of
housing sororities; James Lyons, former dean of students, recalls,
"When the University made the decision to allow the sororities to
return to campus, the administrators did not want to increase fra
ternal housing of any kind. And we thought that since we had
all-women's housing available to students, we were not discrimi
nating." Since their re-establishment in the 1970s and '80s, the
University's policy has been that sororities are not eligible for hous
ing-
Equally riddled with historical nuance, the University's rela
tionship with fraternities is complicated by a set of amorphous
agreements and understandings regarding housing. In the 19505,
the University became increasingly concerned about the safety of
Stanford fraternity houses, some of which dated from the late

19th century. The structural problems of many of the houses were either
too expensive for the fraternity to bear or rendered the house unsafe for
occupancy. Beginning in the 1950s and continuing through the 19705,
Stanford pursued a fund-raising drive to build new undergraduate hous
ing for men. The University solicited, and received, donations from fra
ternity alumni to build new houses in return for a preference for the
groups for occupancy of those houses. This drive resulted in the con
struction of the Cowell Cluster and the Knoll Cluster, where Phi Delta
Theta, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Theta Delta Chi are
currendy housed.
The University's sponsorship of housing for exclusive organizations
has long proved troubling for administrators. In 1984, a task force con
vened to review Greek life at Stanford expressed its support of the
so-called "fraternal privilege" — a Greek organizations right to choose
its own members on entirely subjective criteria — but recommended
that housing not be extended to such groups. Lyons chose not to follow

the recommendation of the
task force. He explains, "I'm
not sure it was a decision that
could have been made with
out great cost to the
University. Fraternities have
historically been the source of
alumni who are very, very
active in alumni associations
and such. They were the
University's supporters. To
have banned fraternities
(from housing) would have
been politically difficult to
do. We didn't want to disen
franchise earlier members."
Instead, Lyons implemented
what is now known as the
"Grandfadier Clause": only

the 12 fraternities who were housed at the time that the clause was enact
ed could continue to receive housing from the University. As Lyons puts
it, "Although the University did not want to expand housing for Greek
organizations, it had made a historical commitment to earlier genera
tions of members to preserve housing for their organization so long as
it was viable." Currendy, should a grandfadiered fraternity lose its hous
ing, it is eligible to petition for a house if members are able to recruit the
necessary numbers to fill it. This policy poses all sorts of problems for
the University; fraternal organizations which are not included in the
clause are not eligible for housing no matter how successful they are,
and sororities are barred altogether.
It is clear that the current housing arrangement is, at the very least,
unfair to many people. It is also clear that housing is a privilege enjoyed
by those groups who have it and desired by those who do not. Given
the complicated thicket of historical relationships which govern the exis
tence of fraternities and sororities at Stanford, what options exist for the
University to provide a fair and equitable housing system for under
graduates?
It seems that the most obvious solution to ensure equity would be
to offer housing for sororities. But this would address only one of the

systems current problems: the feet that fraternities are housed and soror
ities are not. Even if Stanford offered sororities the opportunity to be
housed, it is unclear how many would take advantage of the opportu
nity. Some Greek women may prefer not to be housed; in fact, thats
precisely why many felt comfortable joining a sorority in the first place.
Offering sororities the option of being housed might correct discrimi
nation in one form, but would not necessarily correct the larger
inequities in women's access to Row housing.
And while such a plan would remedy the gross inequalities of the
current system, it would exacerbate others. The housing of Greek orga
nizations presents larger challenges to the University's ethic of equal
opportunity. In making the case for sorority housing, Rubin claims,
"There are special privileges given out based on academic and other cri
teria in housing already. A student who has studied a certain number of
quarters of Italian is bestowed the privilege of having a priority to get in
to Casa Italiana. It's the same case with Lantana, the community service

focus house, and the French
house." But gaining priority
for the Draw in such houses
is based on a clearly articu
lated system of objective cri
teria, in contrast to the sub
jective criteria employed by
fraternities and sororities.
Even the ethnic theme hous
es, which assign some prior
ities based on membership
in a demographic group,
allot them using clearly stat
ed criteria and limit the
number of residents who
can gain a priority by their
race. And more importandy,
even if a student does not
gain a priority at a theme or

focus house by baking bread, taking French or providing proof of
demographic affiliation, these houses are still open to everyone in the
Draw. No one can draw into Kappa Sigma.
An expansion of housing for Greek organizations, male or female,
would inevitably mean the removal of a residence from the University
housing Draw. The University has not been known for its delicacy in
negotiating issues of housing; in 1994, 675 Lomita Drive, one of the
most popular houses on campus, was taken out of the Draw and given
to the newly regenerated Theta Delta Chi fraternity. Howe remembers,
"I heard a lot of resentment from undergrads after 675 was taken out of
the Draw." In an environment of limited housing resources, housing
sororities could provide a solution which proves to be untenable: one
which remedies outstanding legal grievances but which is unfair to
non-Greek students. Howe comments, "I am supportive of sororities
having a housing option, but it has to be done within the context of the
larger community. We're not solving a fairness issue if we create prob
lems for other students."
This poses the question of whether the University should offer any
housing to Greek groups — being fair to everyone by housing no one.
Such a system would solve any question of legal trouble and would
assign all campus housing on an equal basis but would entail a signifi
cant, and to some an unacceptable, transformation of the University

landscape. Fraternities add to the range of housing options for some
students, however limited in number and gender. They have also been
a pan of the University since its inception. To no longer provide them
with housing, even while maintaining support of their existence as
unhoused organizations, would be considered by many to be an abro
gation of the historical commitment the University has made to housed
fraternities on campus.
Many argue that the University cannot legally take away fraterni
ties' housing because of the financial investment the groups made in
constructing new houses in the 1960s and 19705. But the precise terms
of these relationships between the University and the fraternities vary
from group to group and "have yet to be fully determined," according
to Senior University General Counsel Tom Fenner. Lyons points out
that whatever the nature of the relationships might be, they do not
mean that a fraternity has an absolute right to on-campus housing:
"Some fraternities occasionally say that they raised the money for their
houses. They did raise some, but the University really paid most of the
cost for those houses. There are some alums who think that those hous
es exist because they contributed money. I looked at relevant docu
ments from the time and I met with people who were involved in fund
raising back then, and they say that they were very careful not to
promise anything (like fraternal housing in perpetuity) that we couldn't
deliver. They anticipated the inevitable rises and falls in the demand for
fraternal housing."
But Lyons also emphasizes that the University's policies should not
be solely based on legal constraints. "The trust issue at this University
is what's important," he said. "Let me assure you that the legality of this
would not drive us. We would ask what is right, what's right educa
tionally." Howe says, "As a private University we have an important
ongoing relationship with our alumni. The alumni are an important
constituency, even though they aren't current students." Keith Light, a
Sigma Chi alumnus who now serves as an adviser to the fraternity,
affirms, "I don't think it's as easy as people think. I don't believe because
some fraternities helped finance the construction of a number of cam
pus residences that there is a promise for all time that those houses, or
a share of Stanford housing, will be allocated to Greek groups. I do
think, however, that it would be a mistake for Stanford leaders to dis
miss without discussion the historical relationships between Greek
organizations and the University." Though the reasons for the
University's deference to fraternities probably include considerations of
donations from fraternity alumni, it is also a matter of principle which
comes from the long history these groups have had at the University.
Indeed, it was partially out of concern for the complexity and weight of
this history that the 1984 task forces recommendation to eliminate
University-sponsored Greek housing was not pursued.
T
JL he University is caught in the pincers of circumstance. The current
system is unfair to women in general and sororities in particular. But to
rectify its current inequalities by creating housing for sororities limits
housing for non-Greeks. And eliminating housing for fraternities alto
gether will most likely cause an enormous amount of bitterness and
backlash. Without obvious answers, is there a way out?
An assessment of this issue requires a determination of why hous
ing is important for Greek groups. Housing offers some clear social and
organizational advantages to fraternities and sororities. Although a few
of the sororities have cubicles in the Women's Center, such space is

cramped and limited in supply. Lija Huston, a member of Kappa
Kappa Gamma, characterizes attempting to run an unhoused sorority
without storage space or facilities as "an organizational nightmare."
Rubin says, "There are certain aspects of running an organization that
make it easier when you have a facility. That's not necessarily an issue of
living together; it's a matter of having a space where you can keep
belongings. I've heard of sorority members keeping historical materials
for rituals and initiation in

the trunks of their cars or
in their residences. But an
organization also has a lot
to gain by having all of its
members in the same
place. It perpetuates the
organization, it keeps peo
ple more involved. If you

A HOUSING OPTION, BUT IT HAS TO BE
DONE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE
LARGER COMMUNITY.'

have people living next to you who are involved in the same organiza
tion, you are more likely to go to a meeting or social function."
The lack of space for student organizations pinpoints a gaping hole
in Stanford's student services. The problem is not Limited to sororities;
Derek Yarbrough, president of the unhoused Sigma Phi Epsilon frater
nity, details the organizational difficulties of using the current facilities
available to students. "We usually use Tresidder for our meetings, but
we have to reserve it a quarter ahead of time," he said. "We can only get
the latest times because even though it is technically a student union,
administrative groups and recruiters have first priority. We can only use
Tresidder once a week, so if we have another meeting for something
specific, we have to hold it elsewhere. We used to have storage in the
Toyon eating clubs, but it was given over to SCBN." Bob Simoni, pro
fessor of biological sciences and chair of the Greek Task Force, agrees.
"There's little space available for unhoused groups. Tresidder is closely
controlled and mosdy unavailable, and the result is that many groups
must find space off-campus for meetings."
It seems that many of the organizational benefits of a house could
be fulfilled by offering

individuals have proposed the idea of a "Greek lodge," a building or
series of rooms where groups could have storage and meeting space, and
more importantly, have an stable place where community can be estab
lished and nurtured. This arrangement would preserve the University's
commitment to providing facilities for Greek organizations while
mending the inequalities of the current system.
Yet there are other assets to housing aside from access to facilities.
Housing for fraternities provides members with a housing experience
which is simply not possible in the Draw — the chance to live with a
group of friends larger than a Draw group in the same place for all three
years of their upper-class housing. Gopin explains, "There's no other
way to guarantee living with your friends for three yean because the
Draw is so capricious. And even if you do, you can only live with seven



of them. I feel like I'm living with 50 of my closest friends. And that
continuity is important in other ways too — it gives me another bond
to the school."
But these needs and advantages are not necessarily a case for Greek
housing. Light argues that the advantages of the fraternal experience are
not contingent upon having housing. "In my experience, unhoused
groups can enjoy many of the beneficial aspects of fraternal life as
housed groups. There are advantages to both situations." And the social
advantages offered by housing to fraternities do not answer the question
of why exclusive housing is reserved for these groups, since many non-
Greek groups, as well as individuals, would benefit from long-term
housing with a large group of peers. Rather, it raises the question of why
the undergraduate housing experience at Stanford is so fragmented.
Why is membership in a housed fraternity the only way that students
can live in the same place with friends for three years? Light sees this as
part of the larger problem which confronts the University. "Stanford
used to have returning resident priorities, which allowed students to be
part of a dorm or house community for a longer term. They were able
to experience a more stable group identity and connection. What I
needed as an undergrad here was not good food or a great location, but
a place I could feel 'at home.' In such an important window of time —
the undergraduate experience — the opportunity to establish a home
widi a group of fellow students, Greek or non-Greek, is vital." It is quite
likely that Stanford's relatively low alumni donor rate is in part due to a
lack of opportunity to develop solid connections to the school, which is
related to the transitory nature of housing on campus.
Such arguments suggest other options for the University. Stanford
could disperse fraternity housing to places other than the Row to miti
gate disparities in housing, or offer a floor of a dorm rather than an
entire house to a sorority. Light insists, "If fraternities are what they pro
claim to be, then where members actually live shouldn't be the biggest
issue. If living together is central to the experience, then perhaps groups
should be portable. Theoretically, a fraternity (or sorority or theme
house) ought to be able to function in a dorm as easily as in a Row
house." Certainly, some residential environments are preferable to other
depending on the nature of the living group, but an attempt should be
made to determine what the legitimate needs of different groups are.
And a case can be made for the re-instatement of returning resident pri
ority, which was ended in the early 19905, as well as offering four-year
residence options to provide undergraduates with experiences that they
can currently only have via membership in a housed fraternity.
A
thorough discussion of how the University can create a housing
system which is fair while ensuring a variety of choices for undergradu
ates must also tackle a more fundamental issue facing the Stanford
community. It remains unclear why fraternities, or any organization
with exclusive membership, should be subsidized by University-spon
sored housing. The primary social and organizational justifications
offered by Greek members for housing do not in themselves present a
compelling case for providing housing for these groups. Social benefits
do not explain why Greek organizations more than any other group of
students should have those benefits. Organizational advantages can be
provided for in ways which do not compromise the University's com
mitment to equal opportunity. It remains unclear, aside from the lega
cy of the past, why Greek groups should be entitled to exclusive hous
ing. The benefits of fraternal or sororal membership are clear for those
involved, but what they offer the campus community as a whole and
what role they play in the University's vision of an ideal housing system
is far more murky. Because housing plays such a central role in under
graduate life at Stanford, it does not seem consonant with the policy of
fair plav to have an individual's organizational membership, particular
ly when that membership is based upon subjective criteria, determine
his or her housing options, whether they are male or female. To claim
the privilege of exclusive housing, fraternities of sororities have a heft)'
burden of proof to show why they deserve it. And that has not been
articulated.
The burden of proof has not been fulfilled — but that doesn't mean
it can't be. The failure of Greek organizations to clarify their role in the
Stanford community is not unique; the thicket of questions surround
ing the issue of Greek housing reveals larger problems in the allotment
of housing in general. While the case for housing Greek groups is par

ticularly problematic because membership in these groups based upon
subjective selectivity, this lack of criteria for housing is not limited to fra
ternities and sororities. The University's vision for what theme resi
dences are supposed to be is notoriously unclear, and the terms of gain
ing and losing a house are vague for everyone. This year, Yost House
became the popular culture focus house without any apparent student
consensus or visible broad-based support. The ethnic theme houses,
which were enormously popular when first created, are now some of the
least popular student residences (with the exception of
Muwekma-tah-ruk, which just happens to be a Row house). Indeed,
part of the reason there has been no clear articulation of why Greek
groups are entitled to housing is because the University has not required
it. For Greek groups as well as undergraduates in general, the
University's policies can seem inconsistent and often bewildering.
Simoni, the biology professor leading the Greek Task Force, says, "It's
not just a matter of Greek housing. The University needs to set up a set
of criteria by which group of applicants for a house can be judged."
Sigma Chi alumnus Light affirms this point, "There ought to be a
broad-based attempt to address fundamental questions of what would
make Stanford's residential system the best it can be — socially and edu
cationally."
Although the University must incorporate concerns of both legali
ty, structural fairness and adherence to its own purported principles in
determining its housing policies, a community as intricate as that of
Stanford must also incorporate the needs of its constituents and a recog
nition of its history as well. This, Light points out, necessitates an accep
tance of a certain degree of flexibility. "People in an environment like
this have to develop a tolerance for ambiguity. Complicated issues rarely
have black and white solutions. In a fight for equity, the unhappy result
may be that options would be decreased rather than increased. I believe
a thoughtful community discussion would help assess students' and stu
dent groups' needs and wishes with respect to housing and would also
help clarify Stanford's educational mission within residences. The result
could be a plan that is considered fair and widely acceptable." A policy
which is appropriate for the needs of a diverse student body requires an
acknowledgment of historical and contemporary complexity in the face
of solutions which are temptingly simple, and a commitment to creat
ing a larger vision of the purpose of housing at Stanford. As former
Dean of Students Lyons says, "Greek organizations must show them
selves individually and collectively as adding to the Stanford University
educational environment. That could mean many things. But it defi
nitely means that we need to assess what that environment is supposed
to be."

It's not something many undergraduates think about.
Its the status quo, which lends it a sort of established credibility. Perhaps, during your first week at
Stanford, you wandered over with the rest of your dorm to the Deke Jell-O party and started to won
der. Or perhaps you went through sorority rush your freshman year and wondered why you had to
hike out to Escondido Elementary School while your male dormmates just trundled over to SAE and
Kappa Sig. It's a fundamental principle of the Greek system at Stanford — sororities are not housed.

T
JL his would not pose a problem for the University if, as at many
other schools, housed fraternities resided in private buildings
owned by the chapter. But they don't. Stanford provides University
housing — and in the case of Sigma Chi, which owns its own
house, University land — to the fraternities. Lisa Rubin, a member
of Chi Omega and president of the Intersorority Council, explains:
"If the University wasn't financially supporting the fraternity hous
es, both in terms of supplying them with land and facilities and
providing money for improvements, then there wouldn't be an
argument. A house equals financial support on the part of the
University. Over the last two summers, the University has com
pletely remodeled the Delta Kappa Epsilon and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon houses at its own expense. These houses are getting new
furniture, new carpeting, new everything. They have to maintain
certain standards in order to keep the house. But the University is
not offering these benefits to women of any group. Men have many
more options." Under the current housing scheme, the University
is sponsoring a fundamental inequity.
This arrangement creates both legal as well as ethical dilemmas
for the University. Stanford provides an equal number of men's and
women's beds in all undergraduate residences to ensure the barest
legal compliance with Title IX. Enacted in 1972 as part of the
Federal Education Amendments, Title IX prohibits gender dis
crimination in any program offered by an institution of higher edu
cation that receives federal binding. Nonetheless, Stanford's present
housing system appears to violate Tide IX because men's groups,
albeit a limited number, are offered exclusive housing while

women's groups are unilaterally denied a housing option. Adam
Gopin, vice president of the Interfraternity Council and a member
of Kappa Sigma, says,"The University has treated the women's
groups as if they're of no consequence. They don't have anything —
even meeting space — to call their own."
Sororities aside, the system also creates a larger inequity in
housing opportunities between undergraduate women and men.
Although the total number of residential beds on campus are equal
for men and women, the total number of Row housing spaces for
men far exceed those for women because of housed fraternities,
even counting all-female Roth House. (The Row is defined by
Housing and Dining Services to include the Mayfield houses, the
Lomita Houses and Co well Cluster.) Female undergraduates have
long suspected that their Draw numbers have to be better than
those of men for equivalent housing. And in the case of Row hous
ing, this seems to be correct. Over the past six years, about
one-third of undergraduate men have been able to live on the Row,
compared to only 20 percent of undergraduate women. Women
and men do not have equal access to the same type of housing. And
the type of housing in question happens to be one of the most cov
eted on campus. Although many righdy point out that the popu
larity of Row housing has fluctuated over time at Stanford, it pre
sents numerous objective advantages for students. Housing on the
Row often means the luxuries of personal space in a two-room
double and a private cook and always means open access to the
kitchen, a significant perquisite to food service refugees. As Rubin
puts it, "How you draw determines how you eat."
Beyond the question of legality, the current housing system is

clearly unfair to a significant portion of the undergraduate popula
tion. It seems astonishing that the University has not addressed an
inequality so enmeshed in the fabric of student life — even the rel
atively recent report from the Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities, issued in 1984, never mentions the possibility that the
policy of not housing sororities might constitute discrimination. In
contrast to its efficient eviction of self-defense classes for women
from campus in 1993 based on a Title IX complaint, the University
seems to have been either oblivious or apathetic to an inequality
which is staring it in the face.
But there is a growing sense among administrators and stu
dents alike that the system must be modified. Housing is one of the
primary items on the agenda of the Greek Task Force, formed by
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds last
spring to conduct a sweeping review of Greek life at the University.
And many students feel that the current systems inequality can be
tolerated no longer. A sorority member who wished to remain
anonymous attests, "Last year, there was a group of women in the
Greek system who wanted to file a Tide IX suit, myself among
them. The University administration — at the very least the Dean
of Students Office and the Office of Student Activities — was well
aware of this. A campus administrator told us 'Wait until the Greek
Task Force releases it recommendations because there's no need to
be adversarial with the administration if they are going to recom
mend housing.' I take that in good faith, and I'm willing to wait.
But let's say the report does get released and there's no recommen
dation for sorority housing. Then I will guarantee you that a group
of women will file a suit."
I low did Stanford end up with a system which seems so clear
ly unfair, and in some respects, profoundly illogical? An examina
tion of the problems of the current housing arrangement is com
plicated by a long history of relationships — formal and informal
— which have defined the role of Greek organizations at the
University.
Mens and women's Greek letter organizations have been affil
iated with Stanford since the University's first years, and there have
been up to 34 groups on campus at different times in the

University's history. Many of them built houses for their members,
some of which are still standing today in the form of Bechtel
International Center (Zeta Psi) Muwekma-tah-ruk (Chi Omega)
and Storey (Delta Gamma).
Up until World War 11, sororities housed a large proportion of
upperclass women. But with the abolition of the so called "500
Rule," which limited the number of undergraduate women at
Stanford to 500, competition for bids became increasingly severe
and the sorority system began to turn ugly. Many a Stanford stu
dent is familiar with tales of the suicides of unhappy women who
did not receive an invitation to join a sorority, with sites of the act
ranging from Hoover Tower to Lake Lagunita. Though there are no
records of any suicides, by 1943 it had become apparent to both stu
dents and administrators that the system was operating in an
unhealthy manner, and after several attempts to revise the Rush
process, the Board ofTrustees voted to ban sororities from the cam
pus in 1944. Fraternities were not included in the discussion which
led to the ban, in pan because they were largely inactive at the time
due to the service of men in the war. Nanci Howe, director of the
Office of Student Activities, points out, "That's when the inequity
in the system began."
Until the mid-19705, sororities remained banned from the
University. With the advent of Tide DC, University administrators
acknowledged the need to permit sororities to organize on campus
in order to comply with both federal law as well as Stanford's own
anti-discrimination clause. There was no discussion at the time of
housing sororities; James Lyons, former dean of students, recalls,
"When the University made the decision to allow the sororities to
return to campus, the administrators did not want to increase fra
ternal housing of any kind. And we thought that since we had
all-women's housing available to students, we were not discrimi
nating." Since their re-establishment in the 1970s and '80s, the
University's policy has been that sororities are not eligible for hous
ing-
Equally riddled with historical nuance, the University's rela
tionship with fraternities is complicated by a set of amorphous
agreements and understandings regarding housing. In the 19505,
the University became increasingly concerned about the safety of
Stanford fraternity houses, some of which dated from the late

19th century. The structural problems of many of the houses were either
too expensive for the fraternity to bear or rendered the house unsafe for
occupancy. Beginning in the 1950s and continuing through the 19705,
Stanford pursued a fund-raising drive to build new undergraduate hous
ing for men. The University solicited, and received, donations from fra
ternity alumni to build new houses in return for a preference for the
groups for occupancy of those houses. This drive resulted in the con
struction of the Cowell Cluster and the Knoll Cluster, where Phi Delta
Theta, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Theta Delta Chi are
currendy housed.
The University's sponsorship of housing for exclusive organizations
has long proved troubling for administrators. In 1984, a task force con
vened to review Greek life at Stanford expressed its support of the
so-called "fraternal privilege" — a Greek organizations right to choose
its own members on entirely subjective criteria — but recommended
that housing not be extended to such groups. Lyons chose not to follow

the recommendation of the
task force. He explains, "I'm
not sure it was a decision that
could have been made with
out great cost to the
University. Fraternities have
historically been the source of
alumni who are very, very
active in alumni associations
and such. They were the
University's supporters. To
have banned fraternities
(from housing) would have
been politically difficult to
do. We didn't want to disen
franchise earlier members."
Instead, Lyons implemented
what is now known as the
"Grandfadier Clause": only

the 12 fraternities who were housed at the time that the clause was enact
ed could continue to receive housing from the University. As Lyons puts
it, "Although the University did not want to expand housing for Greek
organizations, it had made a historical commitment to earlier genera
tions of members to preserve housing for their organization so long as
it was viable." Currendy, should a grandfadiered fraternity lose its hous
ing, it is eligible to petition for a house if members are able to recruit the
necessary numbers to fill it. This policy poses all sorts of problems for
the University; fraternal organizations which are not included in the
clause are not eligible for housing no matter how successful they are,
and sororities are barred altogether.
It is clear that the current housing arrangement is, at the very least,
unfair to many people. It is also clear that housing is a privilege enjoyed
by those groups who have it and desired by those who do not. Given
the complicated thicket of historical relationships which govern the exis
tence of fraternities and sororities at Stanford, what options exist for the
University to provide a fair and equitable housing system for under
graduates?
It seems that the most obvious solution to ensure equity would be
to offer housing for sororities. But this would address only one of the

systems current problems: the feet that fraternities are housed and soror
ities are not. Even if Stanford offered sororities the opportunity to be
housed, it is unclear how many would take advantage of the opportu
nity. Some Greek women may prefer not to be housed; in fact, thats
precisely why many felt comfortable joining a sorority in the first place.
Offering sororities the option of being housed might correct discrimi
nation in one form, but would not necessarily correct the larger
inequities in women's access to Row housing.
And while such a plan would remedy the gross inequalities of the
current system, it would exacerbate others. The housing of Greek orga
nizations presents larger challenges to the University's ethic of equal
opportunity. In making the case for sorority housing, Rubin claims,
"There are special privileges given out based on academic and other cri
teria in housing already. A student who has studied a certain number of
quarters of Italian is bestowed the privilege of having a priority to get in
to Casa Italiana. It's the same case with Lantana, the community service

focus house, and the French
house." But gaining priority
for the Draw in such houses
is based on a clearly articu
lated system of objective cri
teria, in contrast to the sub
jective criteria employed by
fraternities and sororities.
Even the ethnic theme hous
es, which assign some prior
ities based on membership
in a demographic group,
allot them using clearly stat
ed criteria and limit the
number of residents who
can gain a priority by their
race. And more importandy,
even if a student does not
gain a priority at a theme or

focus house by baking bread, taking French or providing proof of
demographic affiliation, these houses are still open to everyone in the
Draw. No one can draw into Kappa Sigma.
An expansion of housing for Greek organizations, male or female,
would inevitably mean the removal of a residence from the University
housing Draw. The University has not been known for its delicacy in
negotiating issues of housing; in 1994, 675 Lomita Drive, one of the
most popular houses on campus, was taken out of the Draw and given
to the newly regenerated Theta Delta Chi fraternity. Howe remembers,
"I heard a lot of resentment from undergrads after 675 was taken out of
the Draw." In an environment of limited housing resources, housing
sororities could provide a solution which proves to be untenable: one
which remedies outstanding legal grievances but which is unfair to
non-Greek students. Howe comments, "I am supportive of sororities
having a housing option, but it has to be done within the context of the
larger community. We're not solving a fairness issue if we create prob
lems for other students."
This poses the question of whether the University should offer any
housing to Greek groups — being fair to everyone by housing no one.
Such a system would solve any question of legal trouble and would
assign all campus housing on an equal basis but would entail a signifi
cant, and to some an unacceptable, transformation of the University

landscape. Fraternities add to the range of housing options for some
students, however limited in number and gender. They have also been
a pan of the University since its inception. To no longer provide them
with housing, even while maintaining support of their existence as
unhoused organizations, would be considered by many to be an abro
gation of the historical commitment the University has made to housed
fraternities on campus.
Many argue that the University cannot legally take away fraterni
ties' housing because of the financial investment the groups made in
constructing new houses in the 1960s and 19705. But the precise terms
of these relationships between the University and the fraternities vary
from group to group and "have yet to be fully determined," according
to Senior University General Counsel Tom Fenner. Lyons points out
that whatever the nature of the relationships might be, they do not
mean that a fraternity has an absolute right to on-campus housing:
"Some fraternities occasionally say that they raised the money for their
houses. They did raise some, but the University really paid most of the
cost for those houses. There are some alums who think that those hous
es exist because they contributed money. I looked at relevant docu
ments from the time and I met with people who were involved in fund
raising back then, and they say that they were very careful not to
promise anything (like fraternal housing in perpetuity) that we couldn't
deliver. They anticipated the inevitable rises and falls in the demand for
fraternal housing."
But Lyons also emphasizes that the University's policies should not
be solely based on legal constraints. "The trust issue at this University
is what's important," he said. "Let me assure you that the legality of this
would not drive us. We would ask what is right, what's right educa
tionally." Howe says, "As a private University we have an important
ongoing relationship with our alumni. The alumni are an important
constituency, even though they aren't current students." Keith Light, a
Sigma Chi alumnus who now serves as an adviser to the fraternity,
affirms, "I don't think it's as easy as people think. I don't believe because
some fraternities helped finance the construction of a number of cam
pus residences that there is a promise for all time that those houses, or
a share of Stanford housing, will be allocated to Greek groups. I do
think, however, that it would be a mistake for Stanford leaders to dis
miss without discussion the historical relationships between Greek
organizations and the University." Though the reasons for the
University's deference to fraternities probably include considerations of
donations from fraternity alumni, it is also a matter of principle which
comes from the long history these groups have had at the University.
Indeed, it was partially out of concern for the complexity and weight of
this history that the 1984 task forces recommendation to eliminate
University-sponsored Greek housing was not pursued.
T
JL he University is caught in the pincers of circumstance. The current
system is unfair to women in general and sororities in particular. But to
rectify its current inequalities by creating housing for sororities limits
housing for non-Greeks. And eliminating housing for fraternities alto
gether will most likely cause an enormous amount of bitterness and
backlash. Without obvious answers, is there a way out?
An assessment of this issue requires a determination of why hous
ing is important for Greek groups. Housing offers some clear social and
organizational advantages to fraternities and sororities. Although a few
of the sororities have cubicles in the Women's Center, such space is

cramped and limited in supply. Lija Huston, a member of Kappa
Kappa Gamma, characterizes attempting to run an unhoused sorority
without storage space or facilities as "an organizational nightmare."
Rubin says, "There are certain aspects of running an organization that
make it easier when you have a facility. That's not necessarily an issue of
living together; it's a matter of having a space where you can keep
belongings. I've heard of sorority members keeping historical materials
for rituals and initiation in

the trunks of their cars or
in their residences. But an
organization also has a lot
to gain by having all of its
members in the same
place. It perpetuates the
organization, it keeps peo
ple more involved. If you

A HOUSING OPTION, BUT IT HAS TO BE
DONE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE
LARGER COMMUNITY.'

have people living next to you who are involved in the same organiza
tion, you are more likely to go to a meeting or social function."
The lack of space for student organizations pinpoints a gaping hole
in Stanford's student services. The problem is not Limited to sororities;
Derek Yarbrough, president of the unhoused Sigma Phi Epsilon frater
nity, details the organizational difficulties of using the current facilities
available to students. "We usually use Tresidder for our meetings, but
we have to reserve it a quarter ahead of time," he said. "We can only get
the latest times because even though it is technically a student union,
administrative groups and recruiters have first priority. We can only use
Tresidder once a week, so if we have another meeting for something
specific, we have to hold it elsewhere. We used to have storage in the
Toyon eating clubs, but it was given over to SCBN." Bob Simoni, pro
fessor of biological sciences and chair of the Greek Task Force, agrees.
"There's little space available for unhoused groups. Tresidder is closely
controlled and mosdy unavailable, and the result is that many groups
must find space off-campus for meetings."
It seems that many of the organizational benefits of a house could
be fulfilled by offering

individuals have proposed the idea of a "Greek lodge," a building or
series of rooms where groups could have storage and meeting space, and
more importantly, have an stable place where community can be estab
lished and nurtured. This arrangement would preserve the University's
commitment to providing facilities for Greek organizations while
mending the inequalities of the current system.
Yet there are other assets to housing aside from access to facilities.
Housing for fraternities provides members with a housing experience
which is simply not possible in the Draw — the chance to live with a
group of friends larger than a Draw group in the same place for all three
years of their upper-class housing. Gopin explains, "There's no other
way to guarantee living with your friends for three yean because the
Draw is so capricious. And even if you do, you can only live with seven



of them. I feel like I'm living with 50 of my closest friends. And that
continuity is important in other ways too — it gives me another bond
to the school."
But these needs and advantages are not necessarily a case for Greek
housing. Light argues that the advantages of the fraternal experience are
not contingent upon having housing. "In my experience, unhoused
groups can enjoy many of the beneficial aspects of fraternal life as
housed groups. There are advantages to both situations." And the social
advantages offered by housing to fraternities do not answer the question
of why exclusive housing is reserved for these groups, since many non-
Greek groups, as well as individuals, would benefit from long-term
housing with a large group of peers. Rather, it raises the question of why
the undergraduate housing experience at Stanford is so fragmented.
Why is membership in a housed fraternity the only way that students
can live in the same place with friends for three years? Light sees this as
part of the larger problem which confronts the University. "Stanford
used to have returning resident priorities, which allowed students to be
part of a dorm or house community for a longer term. They were able
to experience a more stable group identity and connection. What I
needed as an undergrad here was not good food or a great location, but
a place I could feel 'at home.' In such an important window of time —
the undergraduate experience — the opportunity to establish a home
widi a group of fellow students, Greek or non-Greek, is vital." It is quite
likely that Stanford's relatively low alumni donor rate is in part due to a
lack of opportunity to develop solid connections to the school, which is
related to the transitory nature of housing on campus.
Such arguments suggest other options for the University. Stanford
could disperse fraternity housing to places other than the Row to miti
gate disparities in housing, or offer a floor of a dorm rather than an
entire house to a sorority. Light insists, "If fraternities are what they pro
claim to be, then where members actually live shouldn't be the biggest
issue. If living together is central to the experience, then perhaps groups
should be portable. Theoretically, a fraternity (or sorority or theme
house) ought to be able to function in a dorm as easily as in a Row
house." Certainly, some residential environments are preferable to other
depending on the nature of the living group, but an attempt should be
made to determine what the legitimate needs of different groups are.
And a case can be made for the re-instatement of returning resident pri
ority, which was ended in the early 19905, as well as offering four-year
residence options to provide undergraduates with experiences that they
can currently only have via membership in a housed fraternity.
A
thorough discussion of how the University can create a housing
system which is fair while ensuring a variety of choices for undergradu
ates must also tackle a more fundamental issue facing the Stanford
community. It remains unclear why fraternities, or any organization
with exclusive membership, should be subsidized by University-spon
sored housing. The primary social and organizational justifications
offered by Greek members for housing do not in themselves present a
compelling case for providing housing for these groups. Social benefits
do not explain why Greek organizations more than any other group of
students should have those benefits. Organizational advantages can be
provided for in ways which do not compromise the University's com
mitment to equal opportunity. It remains unclear, aside from the lega
cy of the past, why Greek groups should be entitled to exclusive hous
ing. The benefits of fraternal or sororal membership are clear for those
involved, but what they offer the campus community as a whole and
what role they play in the University's vision of an ideal housing system
is far more murky. Because housing plays such a central role in under
graduate life at Stanford, it does not seem consonant with the policy of
fair plav to have an individual's organizational membership, particular
ly when that membership is based upon subjective criteria, determine
his or her housing options, whether they are male or female. To claim
the privilege of exclusive housing, fraternities of sororities have a heft)'
burden of proof to show why they deserve it. And that has not been
articulated.
The burden of proof has not been fulfilled — but that doesn't mean
it can't be. The failure of Greek organizations to clarify their role in the
Stanford community is not unique; the thicket of questions surround
ing the issue of Greek housing reveals larger problems in the allotment
of housing in general. While the case for housing Greek groups is par

ticularly problematic because membership in these groups based upon
subjective selectivity, this lack of criteria for housing is not limited to fra
ternities and sororities. The University's vision for what theme resi
dences are supposed to be is notoriously unclear, and the terms of gain
ing and losing a house are vague for everyone. This year, Yost House
became the popular culture focus house without any apparent student
consensus or visible broad-based support. The ethnic theme houses,
which were enormously popular when first created, are now some of the
least popular student residences (with the exception of
Muwekma-tah-ruk, which just happens to be a Row house). Indeed,
part of the reason there has been no clear articulation of why Greek
groups are entitled to housing is because the University has not required
it. For Greek groups as well as undergraduates in general, the
University's policies can seem inconsistent and often bewildering.
Simoni, the biology professor leading the Greek Task Force, says, "It's
not just a matter of Greek housing. The University needs to set up a set
of criteria by which group of applicants for a house can be judged."
Sigma Chi alumnus Light affirms this point, "There ought to be a
broad-based attempt to address fundamental questions of what would
make Stanford's residential system the best it can be — socially and edu
cationally."
Although the University must incorporate concerns of both legali
ty, structural fairness and adherence to its own purported principles in
determining its housing policies, a community as intricate as that of
Stanford must also incorporate the needs of its constituents and a recog
nition of its history as well. This, Light points out, necessitates an accep
tance of a certain degree of flexibility. "People in an environment like
this have to develop a tolerance for ambiguity. Complicated issues rarely
have black and white solutions. In a fight for equity, the unhappy result
may be that options would be decreased rather than increased. I believe
a thoughtful community discussion would help assess students' and stu
dent groups' needs and wishes with respect to housing and would also
help clarify Stanford's educational mission within residences. The result
could be a plan that is considered fair and widely acceptable." A policy
which is appropriate for the needs of a diverse student body requires an
acknowledgment of historical and contemporary complexity in the face
of solutions which are temptingly simple, and a commitment to creat
ing a larger vision of the purpose of housing at Stanford. As former
Dean of Students Lyons says, "Greek organizations must show them
selves individually and collectively as adding to the Stanford University
educational environment. That could mean many things. But it defi
nitely means that we need to assess what that environment is supposed
to be."

It's not something many undergraduates think about.
Its the status quo, which lends it a sort of established credibility. Perhaps, during your first week at
Stanford, you wandered over with the rest of your dorm to the Deke Jell-O party and started to won
der. Or perhaps you went through sorority rush your freshman year and wondered why you had to
hike out to Escondido Elementary School while your male dormmates just trundled over to SAE and
Kappa Sig. It's a fundamental principle of the Greek system at Stanford — sororities are not housed.

T
JL his would not pose a problem for the University if, as at many
other schools, housed fraternities resided in private buildings
owned by the chapter. But they don't. Stanford provides University
housing — and in the case of Sigma Chi, which owns its own
house, University land — to the fraternities. Lisa Rubin, a member
of Chi Omega and president of the Intersorority Council, explains:
"If the University wasn't financially supporting the fraternity hous
es, both in terms of supplying them with land and facilities and
providing money for improvements, then there wouldn't be an
argument. A house equals financial support on the part of the
University. Over the last two summers, the University has com
pletely remodeled the Delta Kappa Epsilon and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon houses at its own expense. These houses are getting new
furniture, new carpeting, new everything. They have to maintain
certain standards in order to keep the house. But the University is
not offering these benefits to women of any group. Men have many
more options." Under the current housing scheme, the University
is sponsoring a fundamental inequity.
This arrangement creates both legal as well as ethical dilemmas
for the University. Stanford provides an equal number of men's and
women's beds in all undergraduate residences to ensure the barest
legal compliance with Title IX. Enacted in 1972 as part of the
Federal Education Amendments, Title IX prohibits gender dis
crimination in any program offered by an institution of higher edu
cation that receives federal binding. Nonetheless, Stanford's present
housing system appears to violate Tide IX because men's groups,
albeit a limited number, are offered exclusive housing while

women's groups are unilaterally denied a housing option. Adam
Gopin, vice president of the Interfraternity Council and a member
of Kappa Sigma, says,"The University has treated the women's
groups as if they're of no consequence. They don't have anything —
even meeting space — to call their own."
Sororities aside, the system also creates a larger inequity in
housing opportunities between undergraduate women and men.
Although the total number of residential beds on campus are equal
for men and women, the total number of Row housing spaces for
men far exceed those for women because of housed fraternities,
even counting all-female Roth House. (The Row is defined by
Housing and Dining Services to include the Mayfield houses, the
Lomita Houses and Co well Cluster.) Female undergraduates have
long suspected that their Draw numbers have to be better than
those of men for equivalent housing. And in the case of Row hous
ing, this seems to be correct. Over the past six years, about
one-third of undergraduate men have been able to live on the Row,
compared to only 20 percent of undergraduate women. Women
and men do not have equal access to the same type of housing. And
the type of housing in question happens to be one of the most cov
eted on campus. Although many righdy point out that the popu
larity of Row housing has fluctuated over time at Stanford, it pre
sents numerous objective advantages for students. Housing on the
Row often means the luxuries of personal space in a two-room
double and a private cook and always means open access to the
kitchen, a significant perquisite to food service refugees. As Rubin
puts it, "How you draw determines how you eat."
Beyond the question of legality, the current housing system is

clearly unfair to a significant portion of the undergraduate popula
tion. It seems astonishing that the University has not addressed an
inequality so enmeshed in the fabric of student life — even the rel
atively recent report from the Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities, issued in 1984, never mentions the possibility that the
policy of not housing sororities might constitute discrimination. In
contrast to its efficient eviction of self-defense classes for women
from campus in 1993 based on a Title IX complaint, the University
seems to have been either oblivious or apathetic to an inequality
which is staring it in the face.
But there is a growing sense among administrators and stu
dents alike that the system must be modified. Housing is one of the
primary items on the agenda of the Greek Task Force, formed by
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds last
spring to conduct a sweeping review of Greek life at the University.
And many students feel that the current systems inequality can be
tolerated no longer. A sorority member who wished to remain
anonymous attests, "Last year, there was a group of women in the
Greek system who wanted to file a Tide IX suit, myself among
them. The University administration — at the very least the Dean
of Students Office and the Office of Student Activities — was well
aware of this. A campus administrator told us 'Wait until the Greek
Task Force releases it recommendations because there's no need to
be adversarial with the administration if they are going to recom
mend housing.' I take that in good faith, and I'm willing to wait.
But let's say the report does get released and there's no recommen
dation for sorority housing. Then I will guarantee you that a group
of women will file a suit."
I low did Stanford end up with a system which seems so clear
ly unfair, and in some respects, profoundly illogical? An examina
tion of the problems of the current housing arrangement is com
plicated by a long history of relationships — formal and informal
— which have defined the role of Greek organizations at the
University.
Mens and women's Greek letter organizations have been affil
iated with Stanford since the University's first years, and there have
been up to 34 groups on campus at different times in the

University's history. Many of them built houses for their members,
some of which are still standing today in the form of Bechtel
International Center (Zeta Psi) Muwekma-tah-ruk (Chi Omega)
and Storey (Delta Gamma).
Up until World War 11, sororities housed a large proportion of
upperclass women. But with the abolition of the so called "500
Rule," which limited the number of undergraduate women at
Stanford to 500, competition for bids became increasingly severe
and the sorority system began to turn ugly. Many a Stanford stu
dent is familiar with tales of the suicides of unhappy women who
did not receive an invitation to join a sorority, with sites of the act
ranging from Hoover Tower to Lake Lagunita. Though there are no
records of any suicides, by 1943 it had become apparent to both stu
dents and administrators that the system was operating in an
unhealthy manner, and after several attempts to revise the Rush
process, the Board ofTrustees voted to ban sororities from the cam
pus in 1944. Fraternities were not included in the discussion which
led to the ban, in pan because they were largely inactive at the time
due to the service of men in the war. Nanci Howe, director of the
Office of Student Activities, points out, "That's when the inequity
in the system began."
Until the mid-19705, sororities remained banned from the
University. With the advent of Tide DC, University administrators
acknowledged the need to permit sororities to organize on campus
in order to comply with both federal law as well as Stanford's own
anti-discrimination clause. There was no discussion at the time of
housing sororities; James Lyons, former dean of students, recalls,
"When the University made the decision to allow the sororities to
return to campus, the administrators did not want to increase fra
ternal housing of any kind. And we thought that since we had
all-women's housing available to students, we were not discrimi
nating." Since their re-establishment in the 1970s and '80s, the
University's policy has been that sororities are not eligible for hous
ing-
Equally riddled with historical nuance, the University's rela
tionship with fraternities is complicated by a set of amorphous
agreements and understandings regarding housing. In the 19505,
the University became increasingly concerned about the safety of
Stanford fraternity houses, some of which dated from the late

19th century. The structural problems of many of the houses were either
too expensive for the fraternity to bear or rendered the house unsafe for
occupancy. Beginning in the 1950s and continuing through the 19705,
Stanford pursued a fund-raising drive to build new undergraduate hous
ing for men. The University solicited, and received, donations from fra
ternity alumni to build new houses in return for a preference for the
groups for occupancy of those houses. This drive resulted in the con
struction of the Cowell Cluster and the Knoll Cluster, where Phi Delta
Theta, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Theta Delta Chi are
currendy housed.
The University's sponsorship of housing for exclusive organizations
has long proved troubling for administrators. In 1984, a task force con
vened to review Greek life at Stanford expressed its support of the
so-called "fraternal privilege" — a Greek organizations right to choose
its own members on entirely subjective criteria — but recommended
that housing not be extended to such groups. Lyons chose not to follow

the recommendation of the
task force. He explains, "I'm
not sure it was a decision that
could have been made with
out great cost to the
University. Fraternities have
historically been the source of
alumni who are very, very
active in alumni associations
and such. They were the
University's supporters. To
have banned fraternities
(from housing) would have
been politically difficult to
do. We didn't want to disen
franchise earlier members."
Instead, Lyons implemented
what is now known as the
"Grandfadier Clause": only

the 12 fraternities who were housed at the time that the clause was enact
ed could continue to receive housing from the University. As Lyons puts
it, "Although the University did not want to expand housing for Greek
organizations, it had made a historical commitment to earlier genera
tions of members to preserve housing for their organization so long as
it was viable." Currendy, should a grandfadiered fraternity lose its hous
ing, it is eligible to petition for a house if members are able to recruit the
necessary numbers to fill it. This policy poses all sorts of problems for
the University; fraternal organizations which are not included in the
clause are not eligible for housing no matter how successful they are,
and sororities are barred altogether.
It is clear that the current housing arrangement is, at the very least,
unfair to many people. It is also clear that housing is a privilege enjoyed
by those groups who have it and desired by those who do not. Given
the complicated thicket of historical relationships which govern the exis
tence of fraternities and sororities at Stanford, what options exist for the
University to provide a fair and equitable housing system for under
graduates?
It seems that the most obvious solution to ensure equity would be
to offer housing for sororities. But this would address only one of the

systems current problems: the feet that fraternities are housed and soror
ities are not. Even if Stanford offered sororities the opportunity to be
housed, it is unclear how many would take advantage of the opportu
nity. Some Greek women may prefer not to be housed; in fact, thats
precisely why many felt comfortable joining a sorority in the first place.
Offering sororities the option of being housed might correct discrimi
nation in one form, but would not necessarily correct the larger
inequities in women's access to Row housing.
And while such a plan would remedy the gross inequalities of the
current system, it would exacerbate others. The housing of Greek orga
nizations presents larger challenges to the University's ethic of equal
opportunity. In making the case for sorority housing, Rubin claims,
"There are special privileges given out based on academic and other cri
teria in housing already. A student who has studied a certain number of
quarters of Italian is bestowed the privilege of having a priority to get in
to Casa Italiana. It's the same case with Lantana, the community service

focus house, and the French
house." But gaining priority
for the Draw in such houses
is based on a clearly articu
lated system of objective cri
teria, in contrast to the sub
jective criteria employed by
fraternities and sororities.
Even the ethnic theme hous
es, which assign some prior
ities based on membership
in a demographic group,
allot them using clearly stat
ed criteria and limit the
number of residents who
can gain a priority by their
race. And more importandy,
even if a student does not
gain a priority at a theme or

focus house by baking bread, taking French or providing proof of
demographic affiliation, these houses are still open to everyone in the
Draw. No one can draw into Kappa Sigma.
An expansion of housing for Greek organizations, male or female,
would inevitably mean the removal of a residence from the University
housing Draw. The University has not been known for its delicacy in
negotiating issues of housing; in 1994, 675 Lomita Drive, one of the
most popular houses on campus, was taken out of the Draw and given
to the newly regenerated Theta Delta Chi fraternity. Howe remembers,
"I heard a lot of resentment from undergrads after 675 was taken out of
the Draw." In an environment of limited housing resources, housing
sororities could provide a solution which proves to be untenable: one
which remedies outstanding legal grievances but which is unfair to
non-Greek students. Howe comments, "I am supportive of sororities
having a housing option, but it has to be done within the context of the
larger community. We're not solving a fairness issue if we create prob
lems for other students."
This poses the question of whether the University should offer any
housing to Greek groups — being fair to everyone by housing no one.
Such a system would solve any question of legal trouble and would
assign all campus housing on an equal basis but would entail a signifi
cant, and to some an unacceptable, transformation of the University

landscape. Fraternities add to the range of housing options for some
students, however limited in number and gender. They have also been
a pan of the University since its inception. To no longer provide them
with housing, even while maintaining support of their existence as
unhoused organizations, would be considered by many to be an abro
gation of the historical commitment the University has made to housed
fraternities on campus.
Many argue that the University cannot legally take away fraterni
ties' housing because of the financial investment the groups made in
constructing new houses in the 1960s and 19705. But the precise terms
of these relationships between the University and the fraternities vary
from group to group and "have yet to be fully determined," according
to Senior University General Counsel Tom Fenner. Lyons points out
that whatever the nature of the relationships might be, they do not
mean that a fraternity has an absolute right to on-campus housing:
"Some fraternities occasionally say that they raised the money for their
houses. They did raise some, but the University really paid most of the
cost for those houses. There are some alums who think that those hous
es exist because they contributed money. I looked at relevant docu
ments from the time and I met with people who were involved in fund
raising back then, and they say that they were very careful not to
promise anything (like fraternal housing in perpetuity) that we couldn't
deliver. They anticipated the inevitable rises and falls in the demand for
fraternal housing."
But Lyons also emphasizes that the University's policies should not
be solely based on legal constraints. "The trust issue at this University
is what's important," he said. "Let me assure you that the legality of this
would not drive us. We would ask what is right, what's right educa
tionally." Howe says, "As a private University we have an important
ongoing relationship with our alumni. The alumni are an important
constituency, even though they aren't current students." Keith Light, a
Sigma Chi alumnus who now serves as an adviser to the fraternity,
affirms, "I don't think it's as easy as people think. I don't believe because
some fraternities helped finance the construction of a number of cam
pus residences that there is a promise for all time that those houses, or
a share of Stanford housing, will be allocated to Greek groups. I do
think, however, that it would be a mistake for Stanford leaders to dis
miss without discussion the historical relationships between Greek
organizations and the University." Though the reasons for the
University's deference to fraternities probably include considerations of
donations from fraternity alumni, it is also a matter of principle which
comes from the long history these groups have had at the University.
Indeed, it was partially out of concern for the complexity and weight of
this history that the 1984 task forces recommendation to eliminate
University-sponsored Greek housing was not pursued.
T
JL he University is caught in the pincers of circumstance. The current
system is unfair to women in general and sororities in particular. But to
rectify its current inequalities by creating housing for sororities limits
housing for non-Greeks. And eliminating housing for fraternities alto
gether will most likely cause an enormous amount of bitterness and
backlash. Without obvious answers, is there a way out?
An assessment of this issue requires a determination of why hous
ing is important for Greek groups. Housing offers some clear social and
organizational advantages to fraternities and sororities. Although a few
of the sororities have cubicles in the Women's Center, such space is

cramped and limited in supply. Lija Huston, a member of Kappa
Kappa Gamma, characterizes attempting to run an unhoused sorority
without storage space or facilities as "an organizational nightmare."
Rubin says, "There are certain aspects of running an organization that
make it easier when you have a facility. That's not necessarily an issue of
living together; it's a matter of having a space where you can keep
belongings. I've heard of sorority members keeping historical materials
for rituals and initiation in

the trunks of their cars or
in their residences. But an
organization also has a lot
to gain by having all of its
members in the same
place. It perpetuates the
organization, it keeps peo
ple more involved. If you

A HOUSING OPTION, BUT IT HAS TO BE
DONE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE
LARGER COMMUNITY.'

have people living next to you who are involved in the same organiza
tion, you are more likely to go to a meeting or social function."
The lack of space for student organizations pinpoints a gaping hole
in Stanford's student services. The problem is not Limited to sororities;
Derek Yarbrough, president of the unhoused Sigma Phi Epsilon frater
nity, details the organizational difficulties of using the current facilities
available to students. "We usually use Tresidder for our meetings, but
we have to reserve it a quarter ahead of time," he said. "We can only get
the latest times because even though it is technically a student union,
administrative groups and recruiters have first priority. We can only use
Tresidder once a week, so if we have another meeting for something
specific, we have to hold it elsewhere. We used to have storage in the
Toyon eating clubs, but it was given over to SCBN." Bob Simoni, pro
fessor of biological sciences and chair of the Greek Task Force, agrees.
"There's little space available for unhoused groups. Tresidder is closely
controlled and mosdy unavailable, and the result is that many groups
must find space off-campus for meetings."
It seems that many of the organizational benefits of a house could
be fulfilled by offering

individuals have proposed the idea of a "Greek lodge," a building or
series of rooms where groups could have storage and meeting space, and
more importantly, have an stable place where community can be estab
lished and nurtured. This arrangement would preserve the University's
commitment to providing facilities for Greek organizations while
mending the inequalities of the current system.
Yet there are other assets to housing aside from access to facilities.
Housing for fraternities provides members with a housing experience
which is simply not possible in the Draw — the chance to live with a
group of friends larger than a Draw group in the same place for all three
years of their upper-class housing. Gopin explains, "There's no other
way to guarantee living with your friends for three yean because the
Draw is so capricious. And even if you do, you can only live with seven



of them. I feel like I'm living with 50 of my closest friends. And that
continuity is important in other ways too — it gives me another bond
to the school."
But these needs and advantages are not necessarily a case for Greek
housing. Light argues that the advantages of the fraternal experience are
not contingent upon having housing. "In my experience, unhoused
groups can enjoy many of the beneficial aspects of fraternal life as
housed groups. There are advantages to both situations." And the social
advantages offered by housing to fraternities do not answer the question
of why exclusive housing is reserved for these groups, since many non-
Greek groups, as well as individuals, would benefit from long-term
housing with a large group of peers. Rather, it raises the question of why
the undergraduate housing experience at Stanford is so fragmented.
Why is membership in a housed fraternity the only way that students
can live in the same place with friends for three years? Light sees this as
part of the larger problem which confronts the University. "Stanford
used to have returning resident priorities, which allowed students to be
part of a dorm or house community for a longer term. They were able
to experience a more stable group identity and connection. What I
needed as an undergrad here was not good food or a great location, but
a place I could feel 'at home.' In such an important window of time —
the undergraduate experience — the opportunity to establish a home
widi a group of fellow students, Greek or non-Greek, is vital." It is quite
likely that Stanford's relatively low alumni donor rate is in part due to a
lack of opportunity to develop solid connections to the school, which is
related to the transitory nature of housing on campus.
Such arguments suggest other options for the University. Stanford
could disperse fraternity housing to places other than the Row to miti
gate disparities in housing, or offer a floor of a dorm rather than an
entire house to a sorority. Light insists, "If fraternities are what they pro
claim to be, then where members actually live shouldn't be the biggest
issue. If living together is central to the experience, then perhaps groups
should be portable. Theoretically, a fraternity (or sorority or theme
house) ought to be able to function in a dorm as easily as in a Row
house." Certainly, some residential environments are preferable to other
depending on the nature of the living group, but an attempt should be
made to determine what the legitimate needs of different groups are.
And a case can be made for the re-instatement of returning resident pri
ority, which was ended in the early 19905, as well as offering four-year
residence options to provide undergraduates with experiences that they
can currently only have via membership in a housed fraternity.
A
thorough discussion of how the University can create a housing
system which is fair while ensuring a variety of choices for undergradu
ates must also tackle a more fundamental issue facing the Stanford
community. It remains unclear why fraternities, or any organization
with exclusive membership, should be subsidized by University-spon
sored housing. The primary social and organizational justifications
offered by Greek members for housing do not in themselves present a
compelling case for providing housing for these groups. Social benefits
do not explain why Greek organizations more than any other group of
students should have those benefits. Organizational advantages can be
provided for in ways which do not compromise the University's com
mitment to equal opportunity. It remains unclear, aside from the lega
cy of the past, why Greek groups should be entitled to exclusive hous
ing. The benefits of fraternal or sororal membership are clear for those
involved, but what they offer the campus community as a whole and
what role they play in the University's vision of an ideal housing system
is far more murky. Because housing plays such a central role in under
graduate life at Stanford, it does not seem consonant with the policy of
fair plav to have an individual's organizational membership, particular
ly when that membership is based upon subjective criteria, determine
his or her housing options, whether they are male or female. To claim
the privilege of exclusive housing, fraternities of sororities have a heft)'
burden of proof to show why they deserve it. And that has not been
articulated.
The burden of proof has not been fulfilled — but that doesn't mean
it can't be. The failure of Greek organizations to clarify their role in the
Stanford community is not unique; the thicket of questions surround
ing the issue of Greek housing reveals larger problems in the allotment
of housing in general. While the case for housing Greek groups is par

ticularly problematic because membership in these groups based upon
subjective selectivity, this lack of criteria for housing is not limited to fra
ternities and sororities. The University's vision for what theme resi
dences are supposed to be is notoriously unclear, and the terms of gain
ing and losing a house are vague for everyone. This year, Yost House
became the popular culture focus house without any apparent student
consensus or visible broad-based support. The ethnic theme houses,
which were enormously popular when first created, are now some of the
least popular student residences (with the exception of
Muwekma-tah-ruk, which just happens to be a Row house). Indeed,
part of the reason there has been no clear articulation of why Greek
groups are entitled to housing is because the University has not required
it. For Greek groups as well as undergraduates in general, the
University's policies can seem inconsistent and often bewildering.
Simoni, the biology professor leading the Greek Task Force, says, "It's
not just a matter of Greek housing. The University needs to set up a set
of criteria by which group of applicants for a house can be judged."
Sigma Chi alumnus Light affirms this point, "There ought to be a
broad-based attempt to address fundamental questions of what would
make Stanford's residential system the best it can be — socially and edu
cationally."
Although the University must incorporate concerns of both legali
ty, structural fairness and adherence to its own purported principles in
determining its housing policies, a community as intricate as that of
Stanford must also incorporate the needs of its constituents and a recog
nition of its history as well. This, Light points out, necessitates an accep
tance of a certain degree of flexibility. "People in an environment like
this have to develop a tolerance for ambiguity. Complicated issues rarely
have black and white solutions. In a fight for equity, the unhappy result
may be that options would be decreased rather than increased. I believe
a thoughtful community discussion would help assess students' and stu
dent groups' needs and wishes with respect to housing and would also
help clarify Stanford's educational mission within residences. The result
could be a plan that is considered fair and widely acceptable." A policy
which is appropriate for the needs of a diverse student body requires an
acknowledgment of historical and contemporary complexity in the face
of solutions which are temptingly simple, and a commitment to creat
ing a larger vision of the purpose of housing at Stanford. As former
Dean of Students Lyons says, "Greek organizations must show them
selves individually and collectively as adding to the Stanford University
educational environment. That could mean many things. But it defi
nitely means that we need to assess what that environment is supposed
to be."

It's not something many undergraduates think about.
Its the status quo, which lends it a sort of established credibility. Perhaps, during your first week at
Stanford, you wandered over with the rest of your dorm to the Deke Jell-O party and started to won
der. Or perhaps you went through sorority rush your freshman year and wondered why you had to
hike out to Escondido Elementary School while your male dormmates just trundled over to SAE and
Kappa Sig. It's a fundamental principle of the Greek system at Stanford — sororities are not housed.

T
JL his would not pose a problem for the University if, as at many
other schools, housed fraternities resided in private buildings
owned by the chapter. But they don't. Stanford provides University
housing — and in the case of Sigma Chi, which owns its own
house, University land — to the fraternities. Lisa Rubin, a member
of Chi Omega and president of the Intersorority Council, explains:
"If the University wasn't financially supporting the fraternity hous
es, both in terms of supplying them with land and facilities and
providing money for improvements, then there wouldn't be an
argument. A house equals financial support on the part of the
University. Over the last two summers, the University has com
pletely remodeled the Delta Kappa Epsilon and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon houses at its own expense. These houses are getting new
furniture, new carpeting, new everything. They have to maintain
certain standards in order to keep the house. But the University is
not offering these benefits to women of any group. Men have many
more options." Under the current housing scheme, the University
is sponsoring a fundamental inequity.
This arrangement creates both legal as well as ethical dilemmas
for the University. Stanford provides an equal number of men's and
women's beds in all undergraduate residences to ensure the barest
legal compliance with Title IX. Enacted in 1972 as part of the
Federal Education Amendments, Title IX prohibits gender dis
crimination in any program offered by an institution of higher edu
cation that receives federal binding. Nonetheless, Stanford's present
housing system appears to violate Tide IX because men's groups,
albeit a limited number, are offered exclusive housing while

women's groups are unilaterally denied a housing option. Adam
Gopin, vice president of the Interfraternity Council and a member
of Kappa Sigma, says,"The University has treated the women's
groups as if they're of no consequence. They don't have anything —
even meeting space — to call their own."
Sororities aside, the system also creates a larger inequity in
housing opportunities between undergraduate women and men.
Although the total number of residential beds on campus are equal
for men and women, the total number of Row housing spaces for
men far exceed those for women because of housed fraternities,
even counting all-female Roth House. (The Row is defined by
Housing and Dining Services to include the Mayfield houses, the
Lomita Houses and Co well Cluster.) Female undergraduates have
long suspected that their Draw numbers have to be better than
those of men for equivalent housing. And in the case of Row hous
ing, this seems to be correct. Over the past six years, about
one-third of undergraduate men have been able to live on the Row,
compared to only 20 percent of undergraduate women. Women
and men do not have equal access to the same type of housing. And
the type of housing in question happens to be one of the most cov
eted on campus. Although many righdy point out that the popu
larity of Row housing has fluctuated over time at Stanford, it pre
sents numerous objective advantages for students. Housing on the
Row often means the luxuries of personal space in a two-room
double and a private cook and always means open access to the
kitchen, a significant perquisite to food service refugees. As Rubin
puts it, "How you draw determines how you eat."
Beyond the question of legality, the current housing system is

clearly unfair to a significant portion of the undergraduate popula
tion. It seems astonishing that the University has not addressed an
inequality so enmeshed in the fabric of student life — even the rel
atively recent report from the Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities, issued in 1984, never mentions the possibility that the
policy of not housing sororities might constitute discrimination. In
contrast to its efficient eviction of self-defense classes for women
from campus in 1993 based on a Title IX complaint, the University
seems to have been either oblivious or apathetic to an inequality
which is staring it in the face.
But there is a growing sense among administrators and stu
dents alike that the system must be modified. Housing is one of the
primary items on the agenda of the Greek Task Force, formed by
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds last
spring to conduct a sweeping review of Greek life at the University.
And many students feel that the current systems inequality can be
tolerated no longer. A sorority member who wished to remain
anonymous attests, "Last year, there was a group of women in the
Greek system who wanted to file a Tide IX suit, myself among
them. The University administration — at the very least the Dean
of Students Office and the Office of Student Activities — was well
aware of this. A campus administrator told us 'Wait until the Greek
Task Force releases it recommendations because there's no need to
be adversarial with the administration if they are going to recom
mend housing.' I take that in good faith, and I'm willing to wait.
But let's say the report does get released and there's no recommen
dation for sorority housing. Then I will guarantee you that a group
of women will file a suit."
I low did Stanford end up with a system which seems so clear
ly unfair, and in some respects, profoundly illogical? An examina
tion of the problems of the current housing arrangement is com
plicated by a long history of relationships — formal and informal
— which have defined the role of Greek organizations at the
University.
Mens and women's Greek letter organizations have been affil
iated with Stanford since the University's first years, and there have
been up to 34 groups on campus at different times in the

University's history. Many of them built houses for their members,
some of which are still standing today in the form of Bechtel
International Center (Zeta Psi) Muwekma-tah-ruk (Chi Omega)
and Storey (Delta Gamma).
Up until World War 11, sororities housed a large proportion of
upperclass women. But with the abolition of the so called "500
Rule," which limited the number of undergraduate women at
Stanford to 500, competition for bids became increasingly severe
and the sorority system began to turn ugly. Many a Stanford stu
dent is familiar with tales of the suicides of unhappy women who
did not receive an invitation to join a sorority, with sites of the act
ranging from Hoover Tower to Lake Lagunita. Though there are no
records of any suicides, by 1943 it had become apparent to both stu
dents and administrators that the system was operating in an
unhealthy manner, and after several attempts to revise the Rush
process, the Board ofTrustees voted to ban sororities from the cam
pus in 1944. Fraternities were not included in the discussion which
led to the ban, in pan because they were largely inactive at the time
due to the service of men in the war. Nanci Howe, director of the
Office of Student Activities, points out, "That's when the inequity
in the system began."
Until the mid-19705, sororities remained banned from the
University. With the advent of Tide DC, University administrators
acknowledged the need to permit sororities to organize on campus
in order to comply with both federal law as well as Stanford's own
anti-discrimination clause. There was no discussion at the time of
housing sororities; James Lyons, former dean of students, recalls,
"When the University made the decision to allow the sororities to
return to campus, the administrators did not want to increase fra
ternal housing of any kind. And we thought that since we had
all-women's housing available to students, we were not discrimi
nating." Since their re-establishment in the 1970s and '80s, the
University's policy has been that sororities are not eligible for hous
ing-
Equally riddled with historical nuance, the University's rela
tionship with fraternities is complicated by a set of amorphous
agreements and understandings regarding housing. In the 19505,
the University became increasingly concerned about the safety of
Stanford fraternity houses, some of which dated from the late

19th century. The structural problems of many of the houses were either
too expensive for the fraternity to bear or rendered the house unsafe for
occupancy. Beginning in the 1950s and continuing through the 19705,
Stanford pursued a fund-raising drive to build new undergraduate hous
ing for men. The University solicited, and received, donations from fra
ternity alumni to build new houses in return for a preference for the
groups for occupancy of those houses. This drive resulted in the con
struction of the Cowell Cluster and the Knoll Cluster, where Phi Delta
Theta, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Theta Delta Chi are
currendy housed.
The University's sponsorship of housing for exclusive organizations
has long proved troubling for administrators. In 1984, a task force con
vened to review Greek life at Stanford expressed its support of the
so-called "fraternal privilege" — a Greek organizations right to choose
its own members on entirely subjective criteria — but recommended
that housing not be extended to such groups. Lyons chose not to follow

the recommendation of the
task force. He explains, "I'm
not sure it was a decision that
could have been made with
out great cost to the
University. Fraternities have
historically been the source of
alumni who are very, very
active in alumni associations
and such. They were the
University's supporters. To
have banned fraternities
(from housing) would have
been politically difficult to
do. We didn't want to disen
franchise earlier members."
Instead, Lyons implemented
what is now known as the
"Grandfadier Clause": only

the 12 fraternities who were housed at the time that the clause was enact
ed could continue to receive housing from the University. As Lyons puts
it, "Although the University did not want to expand housing for Greek
organizations, it had made a historical commitment to earlier genera
tions of members to preserve housing for their organization so long as
it was viable." Currendy, should a grandfadiered fraternity lose its hous
ing, it is eligible to petition for a house if members are able to recruit the
necessary numbers to fill it. This policy poses all sorts of problems for
the University; fraternal organizations which are not included in the
clause are not eligible for housing no matter how successful they are,
and sororities are barred altogether.
It is clear that the current housing arrangement is, at the very least,
unfair to many people. It is also clear that housing is a privilege enjoyed
by those groups who have it and desired by those who do not. Given
the complicated thicket of historical relationships which govern the exis
tence of fraternities and sororities at Stanford, what options exist for the
University to provide a fair and equitable housing system for under
graduates?
It seems that the most obvious solution to ensure equity would be
to offer housing for sororities. But this would address only one of the

systems current problems: the feet that fraternities are housed and soror
ities are not. Even if Stanford offered sororities the opportunity to be
housed, it is unclear how many would take advantage of the opportu
nity. Some Greek women may prefer not to be housed; in fact, thats
precisely why many felt comfortable joining a sorority in the first place.
Offering sororities the option of being housed might correct discrimi
nation in one form, but would not necessarily correct the larger
inequities in women's access to Row housing.
And while such a plan would remedy the gross inequalities of the
current system, it would exacerbate others. The housing of Greek orga
nizations presents larger challenges to the University's ethic of equal
opportunity. In making the case for sorority housing, Rubin claims,
"There are special privileges given out based on academic and other cri
teria in housing already. A student who has studied a certain number of
quarters of Italian is bestowed the privilege of having a priority to get in
to Casa Italiana. It's the same case with Lantana, the community service

focus house, and the French
house." But gaining priority
for the Draw in such houses
is based on a clearly articu
lated system of objective cri
teria, in contrast to the sub
jective criteria employed by
fraternities and sororities.
Even the ethnic theme hous
es, which assign some prior
ities based on membership
in a demographic group,
allot them using clearly stat
ed criteria and limit the
number of residents who
can gain a priority by their
race. And more importandy,
even if a student does not
gain a priority at a theme or

focus house by baking bread, taking French or providing proof of
demographic affiliation, these houses are still open to everyone in the
Draw. No one can draw into Kappa Sigma.
An expansion of housing for Greek organizations, male or female,
would inevitably mean the removal of a residence from the University
housing Draw. The University has not been known for its delicacy in
negotiating issues of housing; in 1994, 675 Lomita Drive, one of the
most popular houses on campus, was taken out of the Draw and given
to the newly regenerated Theta Delta Chi fraternity. Howe remembers,
"I heard a lot of resentment from undergrads after 675 was taken out of
the Draw." In an environment of limited housing resources, housing
sororities could provide a solution which proves to be untenable: one
which remedies outstanding legal grievances but which is unfair to
non-Greek students. Howe comments, "I am supportive of sororities
having a housing option, but it has to be done within the context of the
larger community. We're not solving a fairness issue if we create prob
lems for other students."
This poses the question of whether the University should offer any
housing to Greek groups — being fair to everyone by housing no one.
Such a system would solve any question of legal trouble and would
assign all campus housing on an equal basis but would entail a signifi
cant, and to some an unacceptable, transformation of the University

landscape. Fraternities add to the range of housing options for some
students, however limited in number and gender. They have also been
a pan of the University since its inception. To no longer provide them
with housing, even while maintaining support of their existence as
unhoused organizations, would be considered by many to be an abro
gation of the historical commitment the University has made to housed
fraternities on campus.
Many argue that the University cannot legally take away fraterni
ties' housing because of the financial investment the groups made in
constructing new houses in the 1960s and 19705. But the precise terms
of these relationships between the University and the fraternities vary
from group to group and "have yet to be fully determined," according
to Senior University General Counsel Tom Fenner. Lyons points out
that whatever the nature of the relationships might be, they do not
mean that a fraternity has an absolute right to on-campus housing:
"Some fraternities occasionally say that they raised the money for their
houses. They did raise some, but the University really paid most of the
cost for those houses. There are some alums who think that those hous
es exist because they contributed money. I looked at relevant docu
ments from the time and I met with people who were involved in fund
raising back then, and they say that they were very careful not to
promise anything (like fraternal housing in perpetuity) that we couldn't
deliver. They anticipated the inevitable rises and falls in the demand for
fraternal housing."
But Lyons also emphasizes that the University's policies should not
be solely based on legal constraints. "The trust issue at this University
is what's important," he said. "Let me assure you that the legality of this
would not drive us. We would ask what is right, what's right educa
tionally." Howe says, "As a private University we have an important
ongoing relationship with our alumni. The alumni are an important
constituency, even though they aren't current students." Keith Light, a
Sigma Chi alumnus who now serves as an adviser to the fraternity,
affirms, "I don't think it's as easy as people think. I don't believe because
some fraternities helped finance the construction of a number of cam
pus residences that there is a promise for all time that those houses, or
a share of Stanford housing, will be allocated to Greek groups. I do
think, however, that it would be a mistake for Stanford leaders to dis
miss without discussion the historical relationships between Greek
organizations and the University." Though the reasons for the
University's deference to fraternities probably include considerations of
donations from fraternity alumni, it is also a matter of principle which
comes from the long history these groups have had at the University.
Indeed, it was partially out of concern for the complexity and weight of
this history that the 1984 task forces recommendation to eliminate
University-sponsored Greek housing was not pursued.
T
JL he University is caught in the pincers of circumstance. The current
system is unfair to women in general and sororities in particular. But to
rectify its current inequalities by creating housing for sororities limits
housing for non-Greeks. And eliminating housing for fraternities alto
gether will most likely cause an enormous amount of bitterness and
backlash. Without obvious answers, is there a way out?
An assessment of this issue requires a determination of why hous
ing is important for Greek groups. Housing offers some clear social and
organizational advantages to fraternities and sororities. Although a few
of the sororities have cubicles in the Women's Center, such space is

cramped and limited in supply. Lija Huston, a member of Kappa
Kappa Gamma, characterizes attempting to run an unhoused sorority
without storage space or facilities as "an organizational nightmare."
Rubin says, "There are certain aspects of running an organization that
make it easier when you have a facility. That's not necessarily an issue of
living together; it's a matter of having a space where you can keep
belongings. I've heard of sorority members keeping historical materials
for rituals and initiation in

the trunks of their cars or
in their residences. But an
organization also has a lot
to gain by having all of its
members in the same
place. It perpetuates the
organization, it keeps peo
ple more involved. If you

A HOUSING OPTION, BUT IT HAS TO BE
DONE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE
LARGER COMMUNITY.'

have people living next to you who are involved in the same organiza
tion, you are more likely to go to a meeting or social function."
The lack of space for student organizations pinpoints a gaping hole
in Stanford's student services. The problem is not Limited to sororities;
Derek Yarbrough, president of the unhoused Sigma Phi Epsilon frater
nity, details the organizational difficulties of using the current facilities
available to students. "We usually use Tresidder for our meetings, but
we have to reserve it a quarter ahead of time," he said. "We can only get
the latest times because even though it is technically a student union,
administrative groups and recruiters have first priority. We can only use
Tresidder once a week, so if we have another meeting for something
specific, we have to hold it elsewhere. We used to have storage in the
Toyon eating clubs, but it was given over to SCBN." Bob Simoni, pro
fessor of biological sciences and chair of the Greek Task Force, agrees.
"There's little space available for unhoused groups. Tresidder is closely
controlled and mosdy unavailable, and the result is that many groups
must find space off-campus for meetings."
It seems that many of the organizational benefits of a house could
be fulfilled by offering

individuals have proposed the idea of a "Greek lodge," a building or
series of rooms where groups could have storage and meeting space, and
more importantly, have an stable place where community can be estab
lished and nurtured. This arrangement would preserve the University's
commitment to providing facilities for Greek organizations while
mending the inequalities of the current system.
Yet there are other assets to housing aside from access to facilities.
Housing for fraternities provides members with a housing experience
which is simply not possible in the Draw — the chance to live with a
group of friends larger than a Draw group in the same place for all three
years of their upper-class housing. Gopin explains, "There's no other
way to guarantee living with your friends for three yean because the
Draw is so capricious. And even if you do, you can only live with seven



of them. I feel like I'm living with 50 of my closest friends. And that
continuity is important in other ways too — it gives me another bond
to the school."
But these needs and advantages are not necessarily a case for Greek
housing. Light argues that the advantages of the fraternal experience are
not contingent upon having housing. "In my experience, unhoused
groups can enjoy many of the beneficial aspects of fraternal life as
housed groups. There are advantages to both situations." And the social
advantages offered by housing to fraternities do not answer the question
of why exclusive housing is reserved for these groups, since many non-
Greek groups, as well as individuals, would benefit from long-term
housing with a large group of peers. Rather, it raises the question of why
the undergraduate housing experience at Stanford is so fragmented.
Why is membership in a housed fraternity the only way that students
can live in the same place with friends for three years? Light sees this as
part of the larger problem which confronts the University. "Stanford
used to have returning resident priorities, which allowed students to be
part of a dorm or house community for a longer term. They were able
to experience a more stable group identity and connection. What I
needed as an undergrad here was not good food or a great location, but
a place I could feel 'at home.' In such an important window of time —
the undergraduate experience — the opportunity to establish a home
widi a group of fellow students, Greek or non-Greek, is vital." It is quite
likely that Stanford's relatively low alumni donor rate is in part due to a
lack of opportunity to develop solid connections to the school, which is
related to the transitory nature of housing on campus.
Such arguments suggest other options for the University. Stanford
could disperse fraternity housing to places other than the Row to miti
gate disparities in housing, or offer a floor of a dorm rather than an
entire house to a sorority. Light insists, "If fraternities are what they pro
claim to be, then where members actually live shouldn't be the biggest
issue. If living together is central to the experience, then perhaps groups
should be portable. Theoretically, a fraternity (or sorority or theme
house) ought to be able to function in a dorm as easily as in a Row
house." Certainly, some residential environments are preferable to other
depending on the nature of the living group, but an attempt should be
made to determine what the legitimate needs of different groups are.
And a case can be made for the re-instatement of returning resident pri
ority, which was ended in the early 19905, as well as offering four-year
residence options to provide undergraduates with experiences that they
can currently only have via membership in a housed fraternity.
A
thorough discussion of how the University can create a housing
system which is fair while ensuring a variety of choices for undergradu
ates must also tackle a more fundamental issue facing the Stanford
community. It remains unclear why fraternities, or any organization
with exclusive membership, should be subsidized by University-spon
sored housing. The primary social and organizational justifications
offered by Greek members for housing do not in themselves present a
compelling case for providing housing for these groups. Social benefits
do not explain why Greek organizations more than any other group of
students should have those benefits. Organizational advantages can be
provided for in ways which do not compromise the University's com
mitment to equal opportunity. It remains unclear, aside from the lega
cy of the past, why Greek groups should be entitled to exclusive hous
ing. The benefits of fraternal or sororal membership are clear for those
involved, but what they offer the campus community as a whole and
what role they play in the University's vision of an ideal housing system
is far more murky. Because housing plays such a central role in under
graduate life at Stanford, it does not seem consonant with the policy of
fair plav to have an individual's organizational membership, particular
ly when that membership is based upon subjective criteria, determine
his or her housing options, whether they are male or female. To claim
the privilege of exclusive housing, fraternities of sororities have a heft)'
burden of proof to show why they deserve it. And that has not been
articulated.
The burden of proof has not been fulfilled — but that doesn't mean
it can't be. The failure of Greek organizations to clarify their role in the
Stanford community is not unique; the thicket of questions surround
ing the issue of Greek housing reveals larger problems in the allotment
of housing in general. While the case for housing Greek groups is par

ticularly problematic because membership in these groups based upon
subjective selectivity, this lack of criteria for housing is not limited to fra
ternities and sororities. The University's vision for what theme resi
dences are supposed to be is notoriously unclear, and the terms of gain
ing and losing a house are vague for everyone. This year, Yost House
became the popular culture focus house without any apparent student
consensus or visible broad-based support. The ethnic theme houses,
which were enormously popular when first created, are now some of the
least popular student residences (with the exception of
Muwekma-tah-ruk, which just happens to be a Row house). Indeed,
part of the reason there has been no clear articulation of why Greek
groups are entitled to housing is because the University has not required
it. For Greek groups as well as undergraduates in general, the
University's policies can seem inconsistent and often bewildering.
Simoni, the biology professor leading the Greek Task Force, says, "It's
not just a matter of Greek housing. The University needs to set up a set
of criteria by which group of applicants for a house can be judged."
Sigma Chi alumnus Light affirms this point, "There ought to be a
broad-based attempt to address fundamental questions of what would
make Stanford's residential system the best it can be — socially and edu
cationally."
Although the University must incorporate concerns of both legali
ty, structural fairness and adherence to its own purported principles in
determining its housing policies, a community as intricate as that of
Stanford must also incorporate the needs of its constituents and a recog
nition of its history as well. This, Light points out, necessitates an accep
tance of a certain degree of flexibility. "People in an environment like
this have to develop a tolerance for ambiguity. Complicated issues rarely
have black and white solutions. In a fight for equity, the unhappy result
may be that options would be decreased rather than increased. I believe
a thoughtful community discussion would help assess students' and stu
dent groups' needs and wishes with respect to housing and would also
help clarify Stanford's educational mission within residences. The result
could be a plan that is considered fair and widely acceptable." A policy
which is appropriate for the needs of a diverse student body requires an
acknowledgment of historical and contemporary complexity in the face
of solutions which are temptingly simple, and a commitment to creat
ing a larger vision of the purpose of housing at Stanford. As former
Dean of Students Lyons says, "Greek organizations must show them
selves individually and collectively as adding to the Stanford University
educational environment. That could mean many things. But it defi
nitely means that we need to assess what that environment is supposed
to be."

It's not something many undergraduates think about.
Its the status quo, which lends it a sort of established credibility. Perhaps, during your first week at
Stanford, you wandered over with the rest of your dorm to the Deke Jell-O party and started to won
der. Or perhaps you went through sorority rush your freshman year and wondered why you had to
hike out to Escondido Elementary School while your male dormmates just trundled over to SAE and
Kappa Sig. It's a fundamental principle of the Greek system at Stanford — sororities are not housed.

T
JL his would not pose a problem for the University if, as at many
other schools, housed fraternities resided in private buildings
owned by the chapter. But they don't. Stanford provides University
housing — and in the case of Sigma Chi, which owns its own
house, University land — to the fraternities. Lisa Rubin, a member
of Chi Omega and president of the Intersorority Council, explains:
"If the University wasn't financially supporting the fraternity hous
es, both in terms of supplying them with land and facilities and
providing money for improvements, then there wouldn't be an
argument. A house equals financial support on the part of the
University. Over the last two summers, the University has com
pletely remodeled the Delta Kappa Epsilon and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon houses at its own expense. These houses are getting new
furniture, new carpeting, new everything. They have to maintain
certain standards in order to keep the house. But the University is
not offering these benefits to women of any group. Men have many
more options." Under the current housing scheme, the University
is sponsoring a fundamental inequity.
This arrangement creates both legal as well as ethical dilemmas
for the University. Stanford provides an equal number of men's and
women's beds in all undergraduate residences to ensure the barest
legal compliance with Title IX. Enacted in 1972 as part of the
Federal Education Amendments, Title IX prohibits gender dis
crimination in any program offered by an institution of higher edu
cation that receives federal binding. Nonetheless, Stanford's present
housing system appears to violate Tide IX because men's groups,
albeit a limited number, are offered exclusive housing while

women's groups are unilaterally denied a housing option. Adam
Gopin, vice president of the Interfraternity Council and a member
of Kappa Sigma, says,"The University has treated the women's
groups as if they're of no consequence. They don't have anything —
even meeting space — to call their own."
Sororities aside, the system also creates a larger inequity in
housing opportunities between undergraduate women and men.
Although the total number of residential beds on campus are equal
for men and women, the total number of Row housing spaces for
men far exceed those for women because of housed fraternities,
even counting all-female Roth House. (The Row is defined by
Housing and Dining Services to include the Mayfield houses, the
Lomita Houses and Co well Cluster.) Female undergraduates have
long suspected that their Draw numbers have to be better than
those of men for equivalent housing. And in the case of Row hous
ing, this seems to be correct. Over the past six years, about
one-third of undergraduate men have been able to live on the Row,
compared to only 20 percent of undergraduate women. Women
and men do not have equal access to the same type of housing. And
the type of housing in question happens to be one of the most cov
eted on campus. Although many righdy point out that the popu
larity of Row housing has fluctuated over time at Stanford, it pre
sents numerous objective advantages for students. Housing on the
Row often means the luxuries of personal space in a two-room
double and a private cook and always means open access to the
kitchen, a significant perquisite to food service refugees. As Rubin
puts it, "How you draw determines how you eat."
Beyond the question of legality, the current housing system is

clearly unfair to a significant portion of the undergraduate popula
tion. It seems astonishing that the University has not addressed an
inequality so enmeshed in the fabric of student life — even the rel
atively recent report from the Task Force on Fraternities and
Sororities, issued in 1984, never mentions the possibility that the
policy of not housing sororities might constitute discrimination. In
contrast to its efficient eviction of self-defense classes for women
from campus in 1993 based on a Title IX complaint, the University
seems to have been either oblivious or apathetic to an inequality
which is staring it in the face.
But there is a growing sense among administrators and stu
dents alike that the system must be modified. Housing is one of the
primary items on the agenda of the Greek Task Force, formed by
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds last
spring to conduct a sweeping review of Greek life at the University.
And many students feel that the current systems inequality can be
tolerated no longer. A sorority member who wished to remain
anonymous attests, "Last year, there was a group of women in the
Greek system who wanted to file a Tide IX suit, myself among
them. The University administration — at the very least the Dean
of Students Office and the Office of Student Activities — was well
aware of this. A campus administrator told us 'Wait until the Greek
Task Force releases it recommendations because there's no need to
be adversarial with the administration if they are going to recom
mend housing.' I take that in good faith, and I'm willing to wait.
But let's say the report does get released and there's no recommen
dation for sorority housing. Then I will guarantee you that a group
of women will file a suit."
I low did Stanford end up with a system which seems so clear
ly unfair, and in some respects, profoundly illogical? An examina
tion of the problems of the current housing arrangement is com
plicated by a long history of relationships — formal and informal
— which have defined the role of Greek organizations at the
University.
Mens and women's Greek letter organizations have been affil
iated with Stanford since the University's first years, and there have
been up to 34 groups on campus at different times in the

University's history. Many of them built houses for their members,
some of which are still standing today in the form of Bechtel
International Center (Zeta Psi) Muwekma-tah-ruk (Chi Omega)
and Storey (Delta Gamma).
Up until World War 11, sororities housed a large proportion of
upperclass women. But with the abolition of the so called "500
Rule," which limited the number of undergraduate women at
Stanford to 500, competition for bids became increasingly severe
and the sorority system began to turn ugly. Many a Stanford stu
dent is familiar with tales of the suicides of unhappy women who
did not receive an invitation to join a sorority, with sites of the act
ranging from Hoover Tower to Lake Lagunita. Though there are no
records of any suicides, by 1943 it had become apparent to both stu
dents and administrators that the system was operating in an
unhealthy manner, and after several attempts to revise the Rush
process, the Board ofTrustees voted to ban sororities from the cam
pus in 1944. Fraternities were not included in the discussion which
led to the ban, in pan because they were largely inactive at the time
due to the service of men in the war. Nanci Howe, director of the
Office of Student Activities, points out, "That's when the inequity
in the system began."
Until the mid-19705, sororities remained banned from the
University. With the advent of Tide DC, University administrators
acknowledged the need to permit sororities to organize on campus
in order to comply with both federal law as well as Stanford's own
anti-discrimination clause. There was no discussion at the time of
housing sororities; James Lyons, former dean of students, recalls,
"When the University made the decision to allow the sororities to
return to campus, the administrators did not want to increase fra
ternal housing of any kind. And we thought that since we had
all-women's housing available to students, we were not discrimi
nating." Since their re-establishment in the 1970s and '80s, the
University's policy has been that sororities are not eligible for hous
ing-
Equally riddled with historical nuance, the University's rela
tionship with fraternities is complicated by a set of amorphous
agreements and understandings regarding housing. In the 19505,
the University became increasingly concerned about the safety of
Stanford fraternity houses, some of which dated from the late

19th century. The structural problems of many of the houses were either
too expensive for the fraternity to bear or rendered the house unsafe for
occupancy. Beginning in the 1950s and continuing through the 19705,
Stanford pursued a fund-raising drive to build new undergraduate hous
ing for men. The University solicited, and received, donations from fra
ternity alumni to build new houses in return for a preference for the
groups for occupancy of those houses. This drive resulted in the con
struction of the Cowell Cluster and the Knoll Cluster, where Phi Delta
Theta, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Theta Delta Chi are
currendy housed.
The University's sponsorship of housing for exclusive organizations
has long proved troubling for administrators. In 1984, a task force con
vened to review Greek life at Stanford expressed its support of the
so-called "fraternal privilege" — a Greek organizations right to choose
its own members on entirely subjective criteria — but recommended
that housing not be extended to such groups. Lyons chose not to follow

the recommendation of the
task force. He explains, "I'm
not sure it was a decision that
could have been made with
out great cost to the
University. Fraternities have
historically been the source of
alumni who are very, very
active in alumni associations
and such. They were the
University's supporters. To
have banned fraternities
(from housing) would have
been politically difficult to
do. We didn't want to disen
franchise earlier members."
Instead, Lyons implemented
what is now known as the
"Grandfadier Clause": only

the 12 fraternities who were housed at the time that the clause was enact
ed could continue to receive housing from the University. As Lyons puts
it, "Although the University did not want to expand housing for Greek
organizations, it had made a historical commitment to earlier genera
tions of members to preserve housing for their organization so long as
it was viable." Currendy, should a grandfadiered fraternity lose its hous
ing, it is eligible to petition for a house if members are able to recruit the
necessary numbers to fill it. This policy poses all sorts of problems for
the University; fraternal organizations which are not included in the
clause are not eligible for housing no matter how successful they are,
and sororities are barred altogether.
It is clear that the current housing arrangement is, at the very least,
unfair to many people. It is also clear that housing is a privilege enjoyed
by those groups who have it and desired by those who do not. Given
the complicated thicket of historical relationships which govern the exis
tence of fraternities and sororities at Stanford, what options exist for the
University to provide a fair and equitable housing system for under
graduates?
It seems that the most obvious solution to ensure equity would be
to offer housing for sororities. But this would address only one of the

systems current problems: the feet that fraternities are housed and soror
ities are not. Even if Stanford offered sororities the opportunity to be
housed, it is unclear how many would take advantage of the opportu
nity. Some Greek women may prefer not to be housed; in fact, thats
precisely why many felt comfortable joining a sorority in the first place.
Offering sororities the option of being housed might correct discrimi
nation in one form, but would not necessarily correct the larger
inequities in women's access to Row housing.
And while such a plan would remedy the gross inequalities of the
current system, it would exacerbate others. The housing of Greek orga
nizations presents larger challenges to the University's ethic of equal
opportunity. In making the case for sorority housing, Rubin claims,
"There are special privileges given out based on academic and other cri
teria in housing already. A student who has studied a certain number of
quarters of Italian is bestowed the privilege of having a priority to get in
to Casa Italiana. It's the same case with Lantana, the community service

focus house, and the French
house." But gaining priority
for the Draw in such houses
is based on a clearly articu
lated system of objective cri
teria, in contrast to the sub
jective criteria employed by
fraternities and sororities.
Even the ethnic theme hous
es, which assign some prior
ities based on membership
in a demographic group,
allot them using clearly stat
ed criteria and limit the
number of residents who
can gain a priority by their
race. And more importandy,
even if a student does not
gain a priority at a theme or

focus house by baking bread, taking French or providing proof of
demographic affiliation, these houses are still open to everyone in the
Draw. No one can draw into Kappa Sigma.
An expansion of housing for Greek organizations, male or female,
would inevitably mean the removal of a residence from the University
housing Draw. The University has not been known for its delicacy in
negotiating issues of housing; in 1994, 675 Lomita Drive, one of the
most popular houses on campus, was taken out of the Draw and given
to the newly regenerated Theta Delta Chi fraternity. Howe remembers,
"I heard a lot of resentment from undergrads after 675 was taken out of
the Draw." In an environment of limited housing resources, housing
sororities could provide a solution which proves to be untenable: one
which remedies outstanding legal grievances but which is unfair to
non-Greek students. Howe comments, "I am supportive of sororities
having a housing option, but it has to be done within the context of the
larger community. We're not solving a fairness issue if we create prob
lems for other students."
This poses the question of whether the University should offer any
housing to Greek groups — being fair to everyone by housing no one.
Such a system would solve any question of legal trouble and would
assign all campus housing on an equal basis but would entail a signifi
cant, and to some an unacceptable, transformation of the University

landscape. Fraternities add to the range of housing options for some
students, however limited in number and gender. They have also been
a pan of the University since its inception. To no longer provide them
with housing, even while maintaining support of their existence as
unhoused organizations, would be considered by many to be an abro
gation of the historical commitment the University has made to housed
fraternities on campus.
Many argue that the University cannot legally take away fraterni
ties' housing because of the financial investment the groups made in
constructing new houses in the 1960s and 19705. But the precise terms
of these relationships between the University and the fraternities vary
from group to group and "have yet to be fully determined," according
to Senior University General Counsel Tom Fenner. Lyons points out
that whatever the nature of the relationships might be, they do not
mean that a fraternity has an absolute right to on-campus housing:
"Some fraternities occasionally say that they raised the money for their
houses. They did raise some, but the University really paid most of the
cost for those houses. There are some alums who think that those hous
es exist because they contributed money. I looked at relevant docu
ments from the time and I met with people who were involved in fund
raising back then, and they say that they were very careful not to
promise anything (like fraternal housing in perpetuity) that we couldn't
deliver. They anticipated the inevitable rises and falls in the demand for
fraternal housing."
But Lyons also emphasizes that the University's policies should not
be solely based on legal constraints. "The trust issue at this University
is what's important," he said. "Let me assure you that the legality of this
would not drive us. We would ask what is right, what's right educa
tionally." Howe says, "As a private University we have an important
ongoing relationship with our alumni. The alumni are an important
constituency, even though they aren't current students." Keith Light, a
Sigma Chi alumnus who now serves as an adviser to the fraternity,
affirms, "I don't think it's as easy as people think. I don't believe because
some fraternities helped finance the construction of a number of cam
pus residences that there is a promise for all time that those houses, or
a share of Stanford housing, will be allocated to Greek groups. I do
think, however, that it would be a mistake for Stanford leaders to dis
miss without discussion the historical relationships between Greek
organizations and the University." Though the reasons for the
University's deference to fraternities probably include considerations of
donations from fraternity alumni, it is also a matter of principle which
comes from the long history these groups have had at the University.
Indeed, it was partially out of concern for the complexity and weight of
this history that the 1984 task forces recommendation to eliminate
University-sponsored Greek housing was not pursued.
T
JL he University is caught in the pincers of circumstance. The current
system is unfair to women in general and sororities in particular. But to
rectify its current inequalities by creating housing for sororities limits
housing for non-Greeks. And eliminating housing for fraternities alto
gether will most likely cause an enormous amount of bitterness and
backlash. Without obvious answers, is there a way out?
An assessment of this issue requires a determination of why hous
ing is important for Greek groups. Housing offers some clear social and
organizational advantages to fraternities and sororities. Although a few
of the sororities have cubicles in the Women's Center, such space is

cramped and limited in supply. Lija Huston, a member of Kappa
Kappa Gamma, characterizes attempting to run an unhoused sorority
without storage space or facilities as "an organizational nightmare."
Rubin says, "There are certain aspects of running an organization that

The lack of space for student organizations pinpoints a gaping hole
in Stanford's student services. The problem is not Limited to sororities;
Derek Yarbrough, president of the unhoused Sigma Phi Epsilon frater

available to students. "We usually use Tresidder for our meetings, but
we have to reserve it a quarter ahead of time," he said. "We can only get

series of rooms where groups could have storage and meeting space, and
more importantly, have an stable place where community can be estab
lished and nurtured. This arrangement would preserve the University's
commitment to providing facilities for Greek organizations while
mending the inequalities of the current system.
Yet there are other assets to housing aside from access to facilities.
Housing for fraternities provides members with a housing experience
which is simply not possible in the Draw — the chance to live with a
group of friends larger than a Draw group in the same place for all three
years of their upper-class housing. Gopin explains, "There's no other
way to guarantee living with your friends for three yean because the
Draw is so capricious. And even if you do, you can only live with seven



of them. I feel like I'm living with 50 of my closest friends. And that
continuity is important in other ways too — it gives me another bond
to the school."
But these needs and advantages are not necessarily a case for Greek
housing. Light argues that the advantages of the fraternal experience are
not contingent upon having housing. "In my experience, unhoused
groups can enjoy many of the beneficial aspects of fraternal life as
housed groups. There are advantages to both situations." And the social
advantages offered by housing to fraternities do not answer the question
of why exclusive housing is reserved for these groups, since many non-
Greek groups, as well as individuals, would benefit from long-term
housing with a large group of peers. Rather, it raises the question of why
the undergraduate housing experience at Stanford is so fragmented.
Why is membership in a housed fraternity the only way that students
can live in the same place with friends for three years? Light sees this as
part of the larger problem which confronts the University. "Stanford
used to have returning resident priorities, which allowed students to be
part of a dorm or house community for a longer term. They were able
to experience a more stable group identity and connection. What I
needed as an undergrad here was not good food or a great location, but
a place I could feel 'at home.' In such an important window of time —
the undergraduate experience — the opportunity to establish a home
widi a group of fellow students, Greek or non-Greek, is vital." It is quite
likely that Stanford's relatively low alumni donor rate is in part due to a
lack of opportunity to develop solid connections to the school, which is
related to the transitory nature of housing on campus.
Such arguments suggest other options for the University. Stanford
could disperse fraternity housing to places other than the Row to miti
gate disparities in housing, or offer a floor of a dorm rather than an
entire house to a sorority. Light insists, "If fraternities are what they pro
claim to be, then where members actually live shouldn't be the biggest
issue. If living together is central to the experience, then perhaps groups
should be portable. Theoretically, a fraternity (or sorority or theme
house) ought to be able to function in a dorm as easily as in a Row
house." Certainly, some residential environments are preferable to other
depending on the nature of the living group, but an attempt should be
made to determine what the legitimate needs of different groups are.
And a case can be made for the re-instatement of returning resident pri
ority, which was ended in the early 19905, as well as offering four-year
residence options to provide undergraduates with experiences that they
can currently only have via membership in a housed fraternity.
A
thorough discussion of how the University can create a housing
system which is fair while ensuring a variety of choices for undergradu
ates must also tackle a more fundamental issue facing the Stanford
community. It remains unclear why fraternities, or any organization
with exclusive membership, should be subsidized by University-spon
sored housing. The primary social and organizational justifications
offered by Greek members for housing do not in themselves present a
compelling case for providing housing for these groups. Social benefits
do not explain why Greek organizations more than any other group of
students should have those benefits. Organizational advantages can be
provided for in ways which do not compromise the University's com
mitment to equal opportunity. It remains unclear, aside from the lega
cy of the past, why Greek groups should be entitled to exclusive hous
ing. The benefits of fraternal or sororal membership are clear for those
involved, but what they offer the campus community as a whole and
what role they play in the University's vision of an ideal housing system
is far more murky. Because housing plays such a central role in under
graduate life at Stanford, it does not seem consonant with the policy of
fair plav to have an individual's organizational membership, particular
ly when that membership is based upon subjective criteria, determine
his or her housing options, whether they are male or female. To claim
the privilege of exclusive housing, fraternities of sororities have a heft)'
burden of proof to show why they deserve it. And that has not been
articulated.
The burden of proof has not been fulfilled — but that doesn't mean
it can't be. The failure of Greek organizations to clarify their role in the
Stanford community is not unique; the thicket of questions surround
ing the issue of Greek housing reveals larger problems in the allotment
of housing in general. While the case for housing Greek groups is par

ticularly problematic because membership in these groups based upon
subjective selectivity, this lack of criteria for housing is not limited to fra
ternities and sororities. The University's vision for what theme resi
dences are supposed to be is notoriously unclear, and the terms of gain
ing and losing a house are vague for everyone. This year, Yost House
became the popular culture focus house without any apparent student
consensus or visible broad-based support. The ethnic theme houses,
which were enormously popular when first created, are now some of the
least popular student residences (with the exception of
Muwekma-tah-ruk, which just happens to be a Row house). Indeed,
part of the reason there has been no clear articulation of why Greek
groups are entitled to housing is because the University has not required
it. For Greek groups as well as undergraduates in general, the
University's policies can seem inconsistent and often bewildering.
Simoni, the biology professor leading the Greek Task Force, says, "It's
not just a matter of Greek housing. The University needs to set up a set
of criteria by which group of applicants for a house can be judged."
Sigma Chi alumnus Light affirms this point, "There ought to be a
broad-based attempt to address fundamental questions of what would
make Stanford's residential system the best it can be — socially and edu
cationally."
Although the University must incorporate concerns of both legali
ty, structural fairness and adherence to its own purported principles in
determining its housing policies, a community as intricate as that of
Stanford must also incorporate the needs of its constituents and a recog
nition of its history as well. This, Light points out, necessitates an accep
tance of a certain degree of flexibility. "People in an environment like
this have to develop a tolerance for ambiguity. Complicated issues rarely
have black and white solutions. In a fight for equity, the unhappy result
may be that options would be decreased rather than increased. I believe
a thoughtful community discussion would help assess students' and stu
dent groups' needs and wishes with respect to housing and would also
help clarify Stanford's educational mission within residences. The result
could be a plan that is considered fair and widely acceptable." A policy
which is appropriate for the needs of a diverse student body requires an
acknowledgment of historical and contemporary complexity in the face
of solutions which are temptingly simple, and a commitment to creat
ing a larger vision of the purpose of housing at Stanford. As former
Dean of Students Lyons says, "Greek organizations must show them
selves individually and collectively as adding to the Stanford University
educational environment. That could mean many things. But it defi
nitely means that we need to assess what that environment is supposed
to be."
