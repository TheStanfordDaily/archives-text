## HOUSING 
### Mia Sara Bruch 
It's not something many undergraduates think about.
Its the status quo, which lends it a sort of established credibility. Perhaps, during your first week at
Stanford, you wandered over with the rest of your dorm to the Deke Jell-O party and started to won
der. Or perhaps you went through sorority rush your freshman year and wondered why you had to
hike out to Escondido Elementary School while your male dormmates just trundled over to SAE and
Kappa Sig. It's a fundamental principle of the Greek system at Stanford — sororities are not housed.

T
JL his would not pose a problem for the University if, as at many
other schools, housed fraternities resided in private buildings
owned by the chapter. But they don't. Stanford provides University
housing — and in the case of Sigma Chi, which owns its own
house, University land — to the fraternities. Lisa Rubin, a member
of Chi Omega and president of the Intersorority Council, explains:
"If the University wasn't financially supporting the fraternity hous
es, both in terms of supplying them with land and facilities and
providing money for improvements, then there wouldn't be an
argument. A house equals financial support on the part of the
University. Over the last two summers, the University has com
pletely remodeled the Delta Kappa Epsilon and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon houses at its own expense. These houses are getting new
furniture, new carpeting, new everything. They have to maintain
certain standards in order to keep the house. But the University is
not offering these benefits to women of any group. Men have many
more options." Under the current housing scheme, the University
is sponsoring a fundamental inequity.
This arrangement creates both legal as well as ethical dilemmas
for the University. Stanford provides an equal number of men's and
women's beds in all undergraduate residences to ensure the barest
legal compliance with Title IX. Enacted in 1972 as part of the
Federal Education Amendments, Title IX prohibits gender dis
crimination in any program offered by an institution of higher edu
cation that receives federal binding. Nonetheless, Stanford's present
housing system appears to violate Tide IX because men's groups,
albeit a limited number, are offered exclusive housing while

women's groups are unilaterally denied a housing option. Adam
Gopin, vice president of the Interfraternity Council and a member
of Kappa Sigma, says,"The University has treated the women's
groups as if they're of no consequence. They don't have anything —
even meeting space — to call their own."
Sororities aside, the system also creates a larger inequity in
housing opportunities between undergraduate women and men.
Although the total number of residential beds on campus are equal
for men and women, the total number of Row housing spaces for
men far exceed those for women because of housed fraternities,
even counting all-female Roth House. (The Row is defined by
Housing and Dining Services to include the Mayfield houses, the
Lomita Houses and Co well Cluster.) Female undergraduates have
long suspected that their Draw numbers have to be better than
those of men for equivalent housing. And in the case of Row hous
ing, this seems to be correct. Over the past six years, about
one-third of undergraduate men have been able to live on the Row,
compared to only 20 percent of undergraduate women. Women
and men do not have equal access to the same type of housing. And
the type of housing in question happens to be one of the most cov
eted on campus. Although many righdy point out that the popu
larity of Row housing has fluctuated over time at Stanford, it pre
sents numerous objective advantages for students. Housing on the
Row often means the luxuries of personal space in a two-room
double and a private cook and always means open access to the
kitchen, a significant perquisite to food service refugees. As Rubin
puts it, "How you draw determines how you eat."
Beyond the question of legality, the current housing system is
