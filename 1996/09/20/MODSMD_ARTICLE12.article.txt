## Shakin' Our Digitalia 
### Kristie Lü Stout 
jßefore I hit Stanford, I thought Devo was high tech.
The red-capped, stiff-jointed grandpappy of modern synth-pop
represented all that was "high tech" to my pre-Stanfordite self. Devo's
oddly monotone reproduction of the Rolling Stones' "(I Can't Get No)
Satisfaction" confirmed my suspicions of technology ... that it was
indeed a cold, flat imitator of the Real with a nanosecond shelf life in
the aisles of pop celebrity. Technology — like Devo — was soulless,
derivative and easily replaced by the Next Big Fad® to hit the market.
After several years of collegiate rearing at a strongly tech-oriented
university, I've seen the high turnover rate of digital tools — again con
firming my high tech = Devo equation. However, my Stanford-bred
experiences in the local computer cluster have not only confirmed my
postulate, but have also exposed the prophetic prowess of the has-been
pop sensation. When Devo uttered their strangely syncopated "(I Can't
Get No) Satisfaction," they were not merely fashioning a parody of
Mick et al. They were singing the anthem of the Stanford Digerati.
Stanford U. — the mecca of high technology and low dropout
rates — is the breeding ground of the new Digerati, a generation of
digitally addicted brothahs and sistahs who — despite their dozen daily
logins — just (can't get no) satisfaction. The Digerati is a breed of stu
dents who have tossed out frisbee throwing in the Oval for floppy
swapping with the RCC; a class of Net-linked '90s hipsters who inces
santly tune in, turn on but somehow manage to never drop out
(despite the umpteen number of hours spent online) — all done in a
valiant effort to reach some sort of networked nirvana.
Up towards 10 times a day, the Stanford Digerati shake their net
thang, constandy logging on in hopes of finding that discounted Zip
drive on a bulletin board, nabbing that Web design job for Silicon
Graphics, or finding a love note in their electronic mailbox complete
with a hyper-salivating ASCII character
I drool for you, schnookums! :)
For the Stanford Digerati member who cannot bear to digitally
woo that special someone in the public forum of the local computer
cluster, the undergrad pad with an in-room connection becomes as
coveted as a spacious single equipped with futon, jacuzzi and ceiling
mirror.
Every member of the Stanford community is, whether their

Luddite sensibilities like it or not, a member
of the addicted Digerati. Whether or not a
I student is a well-established netizen, techno
phobic newbie or proto-Unabomber, all
Stanford students hand in word-processed
essays to professors they've only approached
via e-mail. They've tossed the mechanical
typewriter and instead have opted to install
the "Vintage Typewriter" font into their
Microsoft Word software. They have
shunned the midnight serenade for an e
mailed message of sweet nothings and an

ASCII long stemmed rose. Indeed, a Stanfordite without e-mail is a
Disney flick without marketing potential. Bad pop culture metaphors
aside, a digital-free student at this university is a non-entity.
In a university that grants universal Internet access and souped-up
Power PCs in every residence hall, the Stanford Digerati have been
bred to not only fiendishly feed from the cult of technology, but to
demand increasingly better performances from their digital providers.
For the temporarily inert Stanford student, the kinetic puzzle progam,
Tetris, may have provided an adequate diversion four years ago. But
today's inert pupil demands much more from a digital procrastination
device. Today's temporarily brain-dead undergraduate has tossed the
2-D shower of puzzle pieces to wield the infinitely superior procrasti
natory powers of the computer cluster's copy of "Marathon II," a gore
dense digital shooting range where, using a subjective point of view, the
player manipulates weaponry in a virtual 3-D space to destroy an alien
civilization that's attempting to take over the world. I admit that even
my pacifist tendencies have given way to the shoot-em-up visceral
thrills of "Marathon" — not that I'm a violence junkie or anything. An

occasional alien carcass is all I need to make it to the next hour of class.
Though Stanford is presumably a secular institution of higher
learning, its students, faculty and staff collectively worship the totem of
digital being. We collectively kow-tow before the colossal William G.
Gates memorial building. We collectively throw our hands up into the
sky praising the generosity of the Hewlett-Packard team. We collec
tively throw a knowing glance at the Yahoo! offices in Mountain View
to acknowledge the little Stanfordites that could and did indeed make
it on the digital homestead. These digital demi-gods are heralded in
hopes of receiving some of their sweet philanthropic nectar: an engi
neering quad here, a new department building there. Who knows?
Perhaps a greater display of digi-reverence could garner one of them
Cybersmith cafes in Tresidder.
And how we need yet another computer lair to satiate our digital
fixes and World Wide Web wanderlust! The Stanford Digerati can't get
no satisfaction until there's more bandwidth, more memory, more dots
per inch, more digital thrills and spills to quiet the addiction ...
And then we complain for more.
