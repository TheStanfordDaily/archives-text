il golden spire dominates the skyline of St. Petersburg. It rises
smoothly from the Peter and Paul Cathedral constructed by Peter the
Great in 1703 as he built St. Petersburg out of the swamps of the Neva
River. Tsar Peter hoped that St. Petersburg would siphon the ideals,
architecture and technology of the West to feudal Russia.
But inside the magnificent cathedral, the iconostasis is cracking
and bits of old electrical wire run behind golden images of the
Orthodox Trinity. This cathedral houses the graves of the entire line of
Russian autocrats who ruled after Peter, but only a few tourists visit to
click their automatic-flash cameras. The post-Communist city of St.
Petersburg lacks the money to maintain the fortress from which the
modern city was conceived.
I have been studying, living and touring in Russia for more than
two months. For me, the spire of the Peter and Paul Cathedral is a
microcosm of Russian architecture — exteriors are facades; they are
some autocrat s dream of how life should be. Real Russian life is hid
den — Peter's failures are tucked away behind lavish palaces; cycles of
poverty, inequity and abuse frequent the box-shaped apartments built
by Stalin and his Communist successors.
P
X eter the Great decided that Russia should join forces with the
enlightened West. He loved boating and working in shipyards; perhaps
his shipping adventures in Finland convinced him to create a port city
at Petersburg to the modernized West. Peterhof is a product of his
dream; it is his summer palace on the Gulf of Finland. The rooms of
the palace feature replicas of lacquer screens from the Orient; gaudy,
golden, David-like figures line the outdoor fountains. Many of the
buildings in St. Petersburg are built in this style; they imitate all that is
foreign — Italy, Greece, France, China, Japan.
But get close to the buildings of St. Petes and the view is different.
Here and there, even a tourist can find traces of Peters failure to mold
Russia into a miniature Versailles. The exterior walls of pink, green and
yellow plaster chip easily. The roofs of large, luxurious government
buildings are made of tin — hardly an appropriate material to keep out
the oppressive wind and cold. A few minutes of biting cold dispels any
visions of gondolas on Venetian canals. The rooms of Peterhof have an
eclectic tastelessness; Chinese wallpaper hangs above Turkish divans
and French bedspreads. As for Petersburg in the 19905, the Hermitage
Museum displays da Vincis, Monets, Rembrandts and relics from
Imperial Russia, but cannot pay its curators or its heating bills.
Flistory has made it clear that this cold, gusty swamp could not be
transformed into a Versailles or Venice. The government of a Russia in
transition, in its efforts to curtail spending, does not allocate money for
the preservation of Peters vision.
T
X first noticed the oppressive apartment housing on my trip from the
Sheremetyevo II airport. The tall, tall apartments with box windows
are everywhere; they obstruct any view of the horizon. Stalin and his
successors built these apartments to accommodate the mass migration
from the country to the city which has plagued Moscow throughout
this century. They presented these apartment complexes as examples of
"true" socialism where individuals lived in equally-sized quarters and
owned no land.
What I do not see, I cannot know. The steel and wooden doors to
the apartments function as excellent barricades. They preserve illusions
of Moscow as a model city, a city where everyone is equal. Without a
look inside these apartments, I can only see matching windows and
floor plans boasting equal square footage for all residents.
Invited by a social worker, I enter one of these apartments, home
to a family with two children. The family's quarters are dirty, the par
ents rarely have enough food to feed themselves, let alone their two
children. The television is cracked; the shelves are empty. The father

has dark, unwashed, uncut hair and watches the cracked TV all day. A
large, but friendly Rottweiler sleeps in the girl's room and invariably
soils the floor.
The image I took away could describe a poor family in any city —
but this is Moscow, the worlds first attempt to create a Communist
Utopia. Here, the outside deliberately hides the inside. Next door, a
peek into the apartment reveals pink inlayed wallpaper and plush car
pets, a harsh contrast to the home of the family next door. This is a
metaphor for the reality behind the face of Russia's Utopia; contrary to
the Soviets public face, inequities in access to health care, income and
housing existed long before the collapse of communism and the eco
nomic chaos Russia has faced in the past decade.
The practice of Utopian self-delusion continues even now.
Moscow Mayor Lushkov perpetuates the illusion as he sends the
homeless of Moscow on trains into the countryside, as he tries to build
an exterior for his city that will attract foreign investment and garner
political support for his re-election.

T
JL he public cemeteries I have seen in Russia sharply contrast the
somber whiteness of Arlington Cemetery, our national burying
ground. I find myself drawn repeatedly to Moscow's Novodevichy
Cemetery where Chekhov, Prokofiev, Khrushchev, Stalin's wife and a
number of famous doctors, engineers, war heroes and revolutionaries
are buried. The gravestones here are of all kinds, shaped into busts,
swans, churches, uneven slabs and classical figures. A bar of music marks

the grave of Prokofiev.
Khrushchev's grave
stone is a mix of black
and white geometrical
shapes, which reflect
the dark and bright
sides of his character. I
enjoy sitting on the
benches at these fairy
tale graves ites, removed

from the tall apartment buildings and the noise of street traffic. The
cemetery is an exception in Moscow — it reflects the personal tastes
and choices of Russian individuals as they buried their loved ones.
I would like to return to Monplaiser, a boathouse that Pfcter the
Great attached to his summer palace at Pcterhof. He spent several
months of each year looking out from here onto the cold, gusty waters
of the Gulf of Finland. At this boathouse, I can imagine that Peter was
content. He constructed the boathouse to meet his individual needs as
a sailor; its architecture avoids propaganda. I fell in love with this build-
