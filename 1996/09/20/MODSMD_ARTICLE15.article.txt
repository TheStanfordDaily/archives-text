## Femme Fatale Undone Bizet's opera is back 
### Benjamin N. Lawrance 
T
_L here is something truly liberating about the character of Bizet s
Carmen, something that woos even the most reticent of first-time lis
teners. It might be said that she is the first of the modern liberators of
women. Carmen, the heroine, throws off the shackles of masculine
affection and attention, seizing her own destiny and sexuality. But then
she drives headlong to destruction, pulling others down with her. One
might wonder what sort of liberation that might represent. But the
meaning of the story is far more complicated; there is much more at
stake in Bizet's opera. And it is this complexity and the intuitive fram
ing in the masculine setting of the Spanish town, Seville, that makes
"Carmen" the worlds most popular opera.
Carmen is a liar, a temptress, a siren, a femme fatale. She draws her
lovers into her lair of deceit and illusion, but she maintains her freedom
and dignity throughout. She is mischievous, rambunctious, cunning

and demonic, yet all the while both puissant
and beyond reproach. Carmen warns and
seduces simultaneously. She walks her lovers
through a minefield, while knowing only too
well that she has but to let go and they're lost.
She is neither the culprit nor the victim. She
combines the both roles and creates a refresh
ing and dynamic personality that overcomes
any obstacle.
The beautiful Carmen works in a Seville cig
arette factory. She is arrested after a fight with a
fellow worker and assigned to the custody of
the handsome new corporal, Don Jos£.
Though his childhood sweetheart, Micaela, has
just arrived, he is bewitched by Carmen and
allows her to escape. He himself is placed under
arrest. At the tavern of Lilas Pastia, the glam
orous toreador Escamillo enters with his
entourage and sets his sights on Carmen.
Although attracted, she decides to wait for Josd,
who is due for release. When he arrives, he
becomes involved in a fight with an officer.
Because of this he is persuaded to desert from
the army and join Carmen and her smuggler
friends in the mountains. Carmen soon grows
tired of Jos£ and when Escamillo arrives, she
agrees to attend his forthcoming bullfight.
Though Micaela pleads with Jos£ to return

home to his mother, he spurns her and follows Carmen and her new
lover to Seville. There they meet and as the crowd rises to applaud
Escamillo, Jos£ half-crazed with love, stabs Carmen to death.
The love affair between Carmen and Jos<* is torrid and desperate.
From the very beginning just as jealously weakens Jos£ inconsistency
distances Carmen. Carmen is proud of the freedom that enthralls her
and her onlookers; she is aware of its power but revels in her lack of self
control. This is the mystery of Carmen and this is why she is not the
headstrong and generic siren of Wedekind s Lulu or Wildes Salome. She
is manifesdy fulfilling her desires for love and affection while fatally
wounding those in her path. She has needs and makes them known.
Though pathos endears her to the audience, her excesses only horrify.
As the scandal unfolds every onlooker can feel the pain she feels for want
of tenderness. And yet they cannot but condemn her for her callousness.
Why must she destroy the men who cross her path? Is she striking
a blow against masculinity? Or is it that she cannot achieve her dream
without destruction? She answers this question when she sings of love
and men. The direction of her journey remains a mystery to herself and
the audience. There is no deliberate malicious intent infused in her
desires. She is a martyr to her passions and recalls earlier tragedy and tor
ment. She has no ax to grind and harbours no grievances. She pours
forth her experiences with all the compassion and intensity of someone

in counseling.
Yet despite her sincerity, Carmen brings Josd (who is wrought from
a calm and homely cloth) down with her. How can this possibly be?
Surely her bewitching nature has delivered one too many blows? A
handsome village lad, beholden to his mother, ought not to deserve
such a fate. But Josd is for more complicit in his entanglement. Though
he is towed along by love and lust, he engineers his own downfall. This
is the entrancing twist in play, on which the opera is based.
Steadfasdy but surely he becomes a tragic anti-hero. Jos£ is no longer
someone we pity, but metamorphoses into a man whose violence and
deceit engenders disgust and shame. Carmen realizes this. She tries to
free first him and then herself from the web she has unwittingly woven.
But by then she is the pursued and the vehemence of the pursuit pre
sent no escape.
Where does Escamillo fit into all this? It is hard to see room for
another lead in such an overwhelming exegesis of love and betrayal. But
in fact, besides the immensely stage-pleasing arias, Escamillo serves a
neutralizing and dissipating function as a catalyst for Carmen's and
Josh's transformations. He enables Carmen seriously to entertain a life
of stability, far remove from the wooing and pursuing of her former life.
Though she does not become a saint, nor lay any claims to a spiritual
or moral rebirth, the audience knows that there is a new motivation in
her relationship with Escamillo. Moreover, is slowly but surely
demonized in comparison to him. Escamillo represents the startling and
heroic masculine ideal, above and beyond affectations of intimacy and
involvement. The recent San Francisco Opera production interwove
these ideas with startling alacrity. Escamillo strutted the stage with all
the enthusiasm and confidence of an Elvis, and escaped from the almost
stooge-like caricature of generic productions.
The story of Carmen is as much a batde of passions as it is a search
for self-fulfillment. Perhaps it can also be said that both result in failure;
Carmen spurns Jos£ and he returns to destroy them both. Their earlier
passionate embraces are rekindled, but as menacing displays of hatred
and anger. There is no hope for either, as the audience knows from the
outset, but the commotion and excitement of the opera glistens with
the perspicacity that allows the depth of its intrigue to vividly unfold.
