'P
X owers and Prospects," Noam Chomsky s new book, has a num
ber of flaws, not least among them, its inaccessibility to those unfamil
iar with Chomsky. It is not a book for those who have read no
Chomsky, which is lamentable since he is so important to read. For
those involved in the field of linguistics, Chomsky ranks among the
dozen most influential thinkers of our century. Four decades after the
revolution in linguistics which followed the 1957 publication of a ver
sion of Chomsky's doctoral dissertation, his contribution to linguistics
compares favorably with the contributions of Einstein to physics.
Chomsky is also a profoundly important figure for the contempo
rary American left. As part of his professional project of questioning
whether such high ideals as democracy and human rights are the true
motives behind U.S. actions overseas, Chomsky has produced some of
the best documented and most damning critiques of American foreign
policy to be found in print. And as pan of a corollary project to explain
why critiques like his are not more prevalent, Chomsky has construct
ed what is known as the "Propaganda Model" of the American press.
The "Propaganda Model" explains how and why the American media
is subservient to the wealthy and privileged sectors of our society
despite our country's much-touted freedom of the press. It is arguably
the most important concept for any critic of American politics to mas
ter.
"Powers and Prospects" presents Chomsky's latest thoughts on
both language and politics. However, aside from being updated to deal
with developments through 1995, some of the book's chapters don't
cover much new ground for Chomsky. The book's third chapter
addresses the responsibility of intellectuals in a free society (and their
shameful failure to live up to that duty in America), the fourth chap
ter is on Chomsky's political vision of a better society, and the seventh
and eighth chapters discuss Western support for Indonesia and its ruth
less and genocidal occupation of the nation of East Timor. But much
of what Chomsky's thoughts on intellectuals and on his political vision
can be found in"The Chomsky Reader," and his reflections on
Indonesia and East Timor are essentially those found in
"Manufacturing Consent."
Similar criticism can also be leveled against the book's first two
chapters, which relate Chomsky's latest thinking in the philosophy of
language. In these chapters, Chomsky considers the implications of a
"naturalistic" approach to the study of language, an approach which

America can close its own markets,
BUT IT IS ABLE TO USE MILITARY FORCE
TO KEEP OPEN THE MARKETS OF
THE THIRD WORLD.

takes language, like quarks
or DNA, to be an object
of the world without the
privilege of any special sta
tus when it is studied. For
anyone not interested in
linguistics or the philoso
phy of language, these
chapters will seem esoteric

at the very least. But anyone who does study language would be better
off simply reading Chomsky's 1995 article in the journal, Mind. Whole
sentences were lifted verbatim from the Mind article to supply "Powers
and Prospects." Chomsky's attempts to make his linguistic thinking
more accessible in "Powers and Prospects" than it was in Mind only
serve to water down his argumentation. They also obscure the place
that Chomsky's arguments holds in his ongoing disagreements with
such prominent philosophers of language as W.V. Quine. Not that
Chomsky gives the reader means of discovering the contrast with the
Mind article; there is no note in "Powers and Prospects" referring the
reader to Mind.

"Powers and Prospects" does have its strong points; the books fifth
and sixth chapters are decryptions of the rhetoric surrounding recent
developments in American politics and the Middle East peace process,
respectively, and are the book's most valuable contributions. In the fifth
chapter, Chomsky questions America's alleged commitment to free
trade," "free markets"and "democracy." Chomsky points out that
American industry has never supported "free trade;" it has never
opened itself to competition from the rest of the world. For example,
during the Reagan years, "The free trade enthusiasts and fiscal conser
vatives imposed more protectionist measures that all post-War admin
istrations combined, virtually doubling import restrictions. America
can close its own markets, but it is able to use military force to keep
open the markets of the Third World. Ihe results are predictable: The
1992 U.N. Development Report estimates that protectionist and finan
cial measures of the rich countries deprived South America of
US$ Vi trillion a year, about 12 times the total 'aid.' " So much for "free
trade."
Chomsky also analyzes Americas alleged devotion to "free mar
kets," this time in the context of the policies enacted by the 104 th
Congress. Backed by a flood of statistics, Chomsky argues that despite
the rhetoric, the public massively opposed and the Clinton adminis
tration actually supported the principles of the Gingrich "revolution."
With its deep slices into desperately needed assistance for the poor and
its massive subsidies of the corporate rich, in particular the arms indus
try, "The general principles are clear and explicit: Free markets are fine
for the Third World and its growing counterpart at home [the
American poor]. Mothers with dependent children can be sternly lec
tured on the need for self-reliance, but not dependent executives and
investors, please. For them, the welfare state must flourish." So much
for "free markets."
And the evidence is even less favorable when it comes to "democ
racy," which Chomsky says is, "according to the canon, the principle
that guides and inspires the political leadership above any other."
Chomsky summarizes his arguments about whether or not democracy
is a concern of the American elite: "To evaluate the theory, we natural
ly turn to the place where policy-makers had a relatively free hand: 'our
little region over here,' [Latin America], rich in resources and potential
and one of the world's worst horror chambers." Citing Bush and
Clinton's violent reactions to attempts at citizen government in Haiti
and Nicaragua, Chomsky illustrates "the depth of the fear and hatred
of democracy in elite circles."
What makes Chomsky so invigorating is his ability to peel
through layers of rhetoric and to express the truth in honest, straight
forward terms. Perhaps the best demonstration of Chomsky's skill is
the book's sixth chapter. Here Chomsky discusses the Middle East
peace process, so lauded by the American national media. Chomsky
reveals how cruel a peace it is.
Take, for example, the expansion of Israeli setdements in the West
Bank, which continued even after the 1993 signing of the Declaration
of Principles. Israel has continued to construct bypass roads which con
nect Israel setdements in the West Bank with Jerusalem and Western
Israel; these roads have the effect of dividing Palestinian settlements
from one another. Chomsky quotes Meron Benvenisti, head of the
West Bank Data Base Project, who describes this as pan of a plan to
"cut the Arab areas into boxes, making [encircled camps] out of the
West Bank." Furthermore, in the year after the accord, Chomsky says,
"Government funding for settlements in the territories increased by 70
percent" and"the Jewish population in the West Bank increased by 10
percent." These facts, in addition to such Israeli demands as control
over the West Bank water supply, render "discussion of autonomy vir
tually meaningless."
But Israeli actions go beyond violating Palestinian autonomy.
According to Human Rights Watch, "The number of Palestinians tor
tured or severely treated while under interrogation during the intifada
is in the tens of thousands" â€” this out of an adult population of less
than 750,000. And Chomsky reminds us that these human rights abus
es are not merely an internal Israeli matter. Despite a U.S. policy which
