While searching for pictures about how housing
used-to be at Stanford (the cover graphic is based on
a series of photos of fraternity housing from the 1909
Stanford Quad yearbook) we dredged up this ditty
from the front page of a 70-year-old Stanford Daily,
just in time for your post-Big Game revelries.
It's got to be a collectors' item by now.
Monday, October 25, 1926
"Copies of the new 'Trojan Horse' song will go on
sale at the Stanford Bookstore this morning at a nick
el apiece. They will be pocket-size and printed on
heavey durable paper. Written to the tune of "On the
Mall," made familiar to Stanford students by the
Stanford band during the last two years, the new
publication is expected to fill the long-felt need for a
good song fitted for the U.S.C. game.
"Music for the song, originally composed by E.F.
Goldman, New York band leader, was arranged by
E.R. Flint, '01, composer of the 'Stanford Forever'
march introduced by the band last year. The words
are the work of J.M. Willits, '25. The new song will
be first tried at the U.S.C. rally and will be used at
the came at Los Aneeles."
