"Slowness"
By Milan Kundera
Harper Collins, $21.00

C
expatriate author Milan Kundera begins his newest novel on
a journey with his wife Vera. "Slowness" opens with speed; the author
and his wife travel toward a destination for romance, a converted
French chateau: "I am driving and in the rear view mirror I notice a car
behind me ... the whole car emits waves of impatience. The driver is
watching for the chance to pass me; he is watching for the moment the
way a hawk watches a sparrow." The driver pushes Kundera to move
faster but the author resists the temptation to speed. Kundera's voice
carefully controls the story, and the driver is swept into a lingering nar
rative of nostalgic and philosophical contemplation.
As the title indicates, Kundera constructs a series of intersecting
stories and vignettes which reflect on the ideal of slowness and the vice
of speed in world where, Kundera laments, "where has the pleasure of
slowness disappeared." The locus of Kundera's novel is found in his
examination of pleasure. He explores the Epicurean notion of hedo
nism: pleasure as the absence of suffering rather than the fulfillment of
desire. Yet in "Slowness," what is most appealing is not pleasure itself
but the conquest of pleasures, the slow manipulation of sexual desires
as a means to wield power and control.
"Slowness" falls into a moody lament for an 18th-century artistic
and literary aesthetic: the artful play of the epistolary novel as in "Les
Liasons Dangereuses," the restrained passions of Crebillon, the artifice
of seduction and the advent of libertinism. Kunderas nostalgic turn to
the past seems to be a stale postmodern cliche, but by the novels end
Kundera defies convention.
The chateau to which the author and his wife are headed is the
nexus of the various interloping stories in the novel. Kundera imagines
this chateau as the one in the 18th-century novella by Vincent Denon,
"Point de Lendemain." The novella divulges a story of clandestine
intrigue and artful seduction between a Madame de T and a young
Chevalier one evening in Madame de Ts chateau. Madame de T
invites the young chevalier home with her after an evening at the the
ater. The Chevalier spends a passionate night with the Madame, only
to learn from her real lover, the Marquis, that he was a decoy to divert
the attention of Monsieur de T from the Marquis. Kundera renders
Denon's story in a slow trance-like rhythm which flows throughout the
novel. The restrained passion of the encounter coupled with the unspo
ken rules of illicit romance is a pas de deux choreographed by Madame
de T to a gracefully slow rhythm: "an excursion in three stages."
The romantic play shadows the black humor of Kunderas mod
ern day characters. Kundera poses two French political and intel
lectual figures, Berck and Duberques, each competing for the public
spodight of abrupt news flashes. He describes the two with a biting sar
casm which echoes throughout the narrative. Duberques kisses an
AIDS patient in front of television cameras, and Berck counters with a
photo opportunity in Africa among starving children. Duberques orga
nizes a candlelight vigil, and Berck retorts by traveling to an Asian
country in the midst of revolt but mistakenly arrives instead at a peace
ful Himalayan village. Pontevin, the self-proclaimed intellectual, dubs
the men "dancers" â€” performers who seek not to change die world
but to artfully capture the public stage, to be seen and to be known:
"That's what makes for the terrifying modernity of this character! He's
showing off not for you or for me but for the whole world. And what
is the whole world? An infinity without faces!"
These ideas converge at the chateau amid an international ento
mological conference. Victor, an aspiring protege of Pontevin, attends
along with Berck and a dissident Czech entomologist. The conference's
crass melange of modern characters underlies Kundera's disdain for the
modern interaction of a society wrapped up in the speed of forgetting.
The conference opens with the Czech delivering a spontaneous, dra
matic speech about his years under an oppressive regime. Tears pour
forth as he professes his euphoria to be surrounded once again by his
fellow entomologists. The crowd explodes into applause and the Czech

forgets to deliver his academic paper.
Kundera describes the dissident intellectual in a sarcastic light.
This assessment is particularly interesting in light of Kundera's own
identity as a dissident through his early writings and participation in
the Prague Spring. The Czech entomologist lays no real claim to great
ness; he became a dissident out of cowardice rather than bravery, by an
accident of fate rather than by a seizure of a historical moment. He has
stepped into a "random Planetary Historic News Event." The Czech's
moment of glory rapidly turns to humiliation in the hands of Berck,
who mocks the entomologist. In the speedy machinations of public
conduct, the moment of glory and the moment of humiliation fade
quickly before the public cameras. "Contemporary history is told like
a huge concert where they present all of Beethoven's 138 opuses, one
after the other, but actually play just the first eight bars of each."
Kundera notes that "there is a secret bond between slowness and
memory." As contemporary mediums speed the transmission of histo
ry, historical events are quickly forgotten. Speed here represents the
antithesis of pleasure. The idealized encounter between the Madame
and the Chevalier is in sharp contrast to the desperate sexual desires of
the modern intellectuals. At the conference Victor seeks respite from
Berck's antagonism in the arms of a vapid young woman, Julie, look
ing for quick romance. Victor looks to Julie as a conquest and a means
to overcome his own humiliation. Walking in the open air with her,
Victor proves himself a false libertine, thinking only of "the hole of her
ass." A carnivalesque scene ensues. Victor attempts to have public sex
with Julie by the pool. They are spotted by the Czech, who attempts to
prove his physical superiority by doing handstands. A love quarrel
between the shunned Immaculata, faithful admirer of Berck, and her
cameraman ends in a pathetic drama of impotence, a failed suicide
attempt and a poolside brawl.
The story accelerates into the absurd. Victor fails to have sex with
Julie and can only imagine the oratory he will deliver his friends: "I

fucked for you boys, your
cocks were all there with me in
that gorgeous orgy, I was your
proxy ... your deputy fucker,
your cock for hire, your plural
cock!" The angry venom of the
"plural cock" is more fuel for
critics of the misogyny some
have found in Kundera's previ
ous work. The novel is littered
with vacant women, waiting
to be filled by anxious men. In

In 'slowness,' what is most
APPEALING IS NOT PLEASURE ITSELF,
BUT THE CONQUEST OF PLEASURES,
THE SLOW MANIPULATION
OF SEXUAL DESIRES AS A MEANS
TO WIELD POWER AND CONTROL.

"Slowness" the power of desire is the property of men.
The novel falters at first; as a character in his own novel, Kunderas
voice initially is heavy and awkward as 1.2 weaves together his philo
sophical aphorisms with the narratives of his characters. But soon he
draws the reader into the tantalizing exchange of his exaggerated fig
ures. "Slowness" does not hold up to "The Unbearable Lightness of
Being" and"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting." However,
Kundera delivers an apt and scathing critique of the mass media and
its public personalities. Avoiding apocalyptic visions of the end of his
tory, Kundera writes a fresh satire of contemporary public life.

de T to a gracefully slow rhythm: "an excursion in three stages."
The romantic play shadows the black humor of Kunderas mod
ern day characters. Kundera poses two French political and intel
lectual figures, Berck and Duberques, each competing for the public
spodight of abrupt news flashes. He describes the two with a biting sar
casm which echoes throughout the narrative. Duberques kisses an
AIDS patient in front of television cameras, and Berck counters with a
photo opportunity in Africa among starving children. Duberques orga
nizes a candlelight vigil, and Berck retorts by traveling to an Asian
country in the midst of revolt but mistakenly arrives instead at a peace
ful Himalayan village. Pontevin, the self-proclaimed intellectual, dubs
the men "dancers" â€” performers who seek not to change die world
but to artfully capture the public stage, to be seen and to be known:
"That's what makes for the terrifying modernity of this character! He's
showing off not for you or for me but for the whole world. And what
is the whole world? An infinity without faces!"
These ideas converge at the chateau amid an international ento
mological conference. Victor, an aspiring protege of Pontevin, attends
along with Berck and a dissident Czech entomologist. The conference's
crass melange of modern characters underlies Kundera's disdain for the
modern interaction of a society wrapped up in the speed of forgetting.
The conference opens with the Czech delivering a spontaneous, dra
matic speech about his years under an oppressive regime. Tears pour
forth as he professes his euphoria to be surrounded once again by his
fellow entomologists. The crowd explodes into applause and the Czech

forgets to deliver his academic paper.
Kundera describes the dissident intellectual in a sarcastic light.
This assessment is particularly interesting in light of Kundera's own
identity as a dissident through his early writings and participation in
the Prague Spring. The Czech entomologist lays no real claim to great
ness; he became a dissident out of cowardice rather than bravery, by an
accident of fate rather than by a seizure of a historical moment. He has
stepped into a "random Planetary Historic News Event." The Czech's
moment of glory rapidly turns to humiliation in the hands of Berck,
who mocks the entomologist. In the speedy machinations of public
conduct, the moment of glory and the moment of humiliation fade
quickly before the public cameras. "Contemporary history is told like
a huge concert where they present all of Beethoven's 138 opuses, one
after the other, but actually play just the first eight bars of each."
Kundera notes that "there is a secret bond between slowness and
memory." As contemporary mediums speed the transmission of histo
ry, historical events are quickly forgotten. Speed here represents the
antithesis of pleasure. The idealized encounter between the Madame
and the Chevalier is in sharp contrast to the desperate sexual desires of
the modern intellectuals. At the conference Victor seeks respite from
Berck's antagonism in the arms of a vapid young woman, Julie, look
ing for quick romance. Victor looks to Julie as a conquest and a means
to overcome his own humiliation. Walking in the open air with her,
Victor proves himself a false libertine, thinking only of "the hole of her
ass." A carnivalesque scene ensues. Victor attempts to have public sex
with Julie by the pool. They are spotted by the Czech, who attempts to
prove his physical superiority by doing handstands. A love quarrel
between the shunned Immaculata, faithful admirer of Berck, and her
cameraman ends in a pathetic drama of impotence, a failed suicide
attempt and a poolside brawl.
The story accelerates into the absurd. Victor fails to have sex with
Julie and can only imagine the oratory he will deliver his friends: "I

fucked for you boys, your
cocks were all there with me in
that gorgeous orgy, I was your
proxy ... your deputy fucker,
your cock for hire, your plural
cock!" The angry venom of the
"plural cock" is more fuel for
critics of the misogyny some
have found in Kundera's previ
ous work. The novel is littered
with vacant women, waiting
to be filled by anxious men. In

In 'slowness,' what is most
APPEALING IS NOT PLEASURE ITSELF,
BUT THE CONQUEST OF PLEASURES,
THE SLOW MANIPULATION
OF SEXUAL DESIRES AS A MEANS
TO WIELD POWER AND CONTROL.

"Slowness" the power of desire is the property of men.
The novel falters at first; as a character in his own novel, Kunderas
voice initially is heavy and awkward as 1.2 weaves together his philo
sophical aphorisms with the narratives of his characters. But soon he
draws the reader into the tantalizing exchange of his exaggerated fig
ures. "Slowness" does not hold up to "The Unbearable Lightness of
Being" and"The Book of Laughter and Forgetting." However,
Kundera delivers an apt and scathing critique of the mass media and
its public personalities. Avoiding apocalyptic visions of the end of his
tory, Kundera writes a fresh satire of contemporary public life.
