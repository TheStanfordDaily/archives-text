"T.S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'
By Anthony Julius
Cambridge University Press, $18.95

In one of his most well-known essays, "Tradition and the Individual
Talent," T.S. Eliot writes, "Honest criticism and sensitive appreciation
is directed not upon the poet but upon the poetry." There is a certain
irony in the fact that almost 80 years after the first publication of this
essay we find Eliot's statement recreated in the context of a forceful cri
tique of his own work. In his recently published book, "T.S. Eliot,
Anti-Semitism and Literary Form," author Anthony Julius confronts
the issue of Eliot's anti-Semitism, but he is careful to direct his critical
attention at the writings as opposed to the man.
"I do not ask the biographical question: What made Eliot an anti-
Semite," Julius explains, "Instead, I ask: Of what was Eliot's anti-
Semitism made, and what did Eliot make out of anti-Semitism?" In
the larger sense, what Eliot "made" was a vast body of work, both poet
ry and prose, which has established him as one of the most influential
writers in the Western literary tradition. In his book, Julius turns to
this body of work with both "honest criticism" and "sensitive appreci
| ation," and he seeks to prove that anti-Semitism was not merely a trope
which appeared now and then in a poem or an essay, but rather, ..
part of the material out of which [Eliot] created poetry." Julius writes,
"Of the many different kinds of anti-Semite, Eliot was the rarest kind:
One who was able to place his anti-Semitism at the service of his art."
Julius's book moves dirough well know poems like "Gerontion,"
"Sweeney Among the Nightingales" and"The Waste Land" and
encompasses lesser-known poems and unpublished fragments such as
"Dirge," as well as prose works such as "After Strange Gods."
While the book is intelligent, well-researched and engaging, it does
not, in the final consideration, overdy tell us much that we do not
already know. Julius's book is most valuable not because it offers a rev
olutionary analysis of Eliot, nor because it uncovers something hereto
fore unnoticed in the poems and essays, but because it is highly evoca
tive of some of the most pressing issues in the contemporary academ
ic world — issues such as the nature of the existing literary canon and
the place of religious, racial or gender concerns in the realm of literary
criticism.
Critical reviews quoted on the jacket of Julius's book claim that the
book is "mold-breaking" (Frederick Raphael, The Weekly Standard),
"long overdue" (The New York Times) and "refreshing" (Peter

Ackroyd, The Times). Julius's
work is praised for its candor,
its willingness to say what has
not before been said. Behind
the praise, one can detect a col
lective sigh of relief as though,
in publishing his study, Julius
has at last spoken aloud a dirty
secret that has long been
ignored or only whispered. Yet
one is forced to wonder: If this
exposition of Eliot's anti-
Semitism is really as "long over
due" as the critics claim, then
why has no one ventured to
write about it before?
The reason cannot possi
bly be that no one noticed.
Lines like "the Jew squats on
the window-sill, the owner/
Spawned in some estaminet in

Antwerp . .("Gerontion") or "The rats are underneath the piles. /
The Jew is underneath the lot ..("Burbank with a Baedeker:
Bleistein with a Cigar") are impossible to misconstrue. By relying on
collective racial stereotypes, Eliot denies the possibility of individuality,
and the Jew in each poem is even further reduced and humiliated by

the repeated use of demeaning and animalistic imagery. While refer
ences such as these are relatively rare in the context of the entire body
of Eliots work, they are, nonetheless, overt in their prejudice and their
scorn. The prevailing critical refusal to address these issues can be char
acterized as racism, or cowardice, or mere denial, but it cannot be
excused as ignorance. Julius, therefore, is significant not so much for
what he says (for as shown, Eliot's anti-Semitism is apparent to even
the most casual reader) but because he dares to say it at all. By raising
his voice, Julius breaks the silence that has defined the academic com
munity's reaction to Eliot's anti-Semitism for the past 70 years. He
paves the way for other voices, other discussions and, perhaps even
more importandy, he opens a space for criticism of the very forces that
for so long have allowed Eliot's prejudice to slide by unacknowledged.
Julius rebels against a well-established tendency within the acade
mic community to deify the figure of the artist. He writes, "In discus
sions of the supposed anti-Semitism of certain of his poems, Eliot has
been the beneficiary of a complex bundle of ideas about poetic truth."
Julius refers, here, to the strong desire on the part of the reader to
believe that great art conveys some sort of transcendent meaning. So
great is this desire that readers of poetry have long been willing to dis
miss or blatandy ignore flaws in the work of art, both structural incon
sistencies and moral or ethical shortcomings, in the service of main
taining the vision of continuity, purity and artistic genius. Julius under
stands that an artist who has been raised to the canonical primacy of
someone likeT.S. Eliot is the main "beneficiary" of these tendencies as
he or she is endowed by the admirers' worship with an immunity to
wrongdoing. Julius quotes Karl Shapiro's comment diat Eliot, himself,
was "untouchable," that he was "Modern Literature incarnate." To
admit, in light of exaltation such as this, that one of our most influen
tial and revered poets was also an anti-Semite is to shake the pedestal
upon which he has been placed. It is both shocking and embarrassing,
and it opens the way for closer moral scrutiny of other hallowed,
canonical writers. For if we acknowledge Eliot as an anti-Semite, so
might we also extend our vision to the anti-Semitism of Shakespeare
and Chaucer or, similarly, the racism of Kipling and Conrad, the
misogyny of Hemingway and Faulkner or the elitism of Woolf and
Wordsworth. On a textual level, however, Julius is more concerned
with a close reading of Eliot's poetry than a radical overhaul of the
Western canon. It is beyond the level of the text that Julius's book as a
physical, published artifact makes its statement of defiance. As noted
above, Julius speaks when no one else has spoken and this fact, more
than any other, renders the publication of his study an act of courage
and an impetus for debate.
In a similar fashion, questions surrounding the efficacy of person
ally charged criticism also begin on a limited textual basis and then
expand their implications beyond the perimeters of this one book.
Julius writes in the books introduction, "We know, of course, that we
should practice a certain 'ideological' restraint when reading, but there
is a difference between reading a text that challenges the worth of one's
ideas and one that challenges the worth of one's person." Julius follows
this declaration with an anti-Semitic passage from "Burbank with a
Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar" and then goes on to say, " 'Burbank'
so resonates with anti-Semitic scorn that if my hypothetical Jewish
reader persisted with such a poem he would, I suggest, feel compelled
to answer back in a spirit of remonstrative exegesis. He would read the
poem adversarially. I am that reader, and what follows comprises my
adversarial reading of Eliot's anti-Semitic poetry and prose."
Undeniably, certain parts of Eliot's work are a hostile affront which
deliberately seek to challenge the worth of the Jewish "person."
Accepting this as fact, Julius's remarks imply that for the Jewish reader
of Eliot's writings, an "ideological restraint" is impossible. Julius, him
self, is one such Jewish reader and what he proposes in this introduc
tion is an "adversarial" reading of Eliot's anu-Semitic poetry and prose
— a reading which he later describes as informed by personal "out
rage." This motivating sense of adversarial outrage not only excludes
the possibility of "ideological restraint," but aggressively positions itself
as its direct antithesis. The reader, encountering this sentiment in the
book's introductory chapter, prepares him or herself for a "remonstra
tive" critique, some sort of reactionary, personally motivated response.

What the reader finds, however, is that throughout the book, Julius
struggles to maintain just the sort of "ideological restraint" that he has
already declared to be an impossibility.
Decidedly offensive anti-Semitic passages are explained with jour
nalistic detachment. An uneasy tension evolves between the adversar
ial outrage that we are led to expect and the familiar academic distance
that we actually find in Julius's treatment of the texts* In a moment of
self-disclosure, Julius explains:
It was then and it still is difficult to write about
Eliot's anti-Semitic poetry. One risks distorting the
work, even defaming the man. When Jewish, one
risks even more. One puts in jeopardy one's creden
tials as a critic. One can seem a philistine. The parti
san of one's people, one ceases, it could be said, to
represent the unprejudiced reader ... less a critic
than a vigilante ...
Julius is determined to be taken seriously as a critic and, as such, strug
gles to present himself in the traditionally accepted role of the "unprej
udiced reader." The difficulty of this, however is that Julius has already
told us that for Jewish readers like himself, ideological restraint is
impossible. He is driven, on some level at least, by a self-declared
adversarial sense of outrage and such a motivation is inherently biased
or prejudiced. Julius is angry, and his anger only adds to the difficulty
of his critical position:
Anger can inform and even improve aesthetic judg
ment. It is true, however, that such judgments are
especially difficult to get right, as assessments of
Eliot's work by certain Jewish critics have demon
strated. These assessments have an embattled, even
querulous tone.
By asserting, in the opening statement of this passage, the value
and validity of anger in the realm of aesthetic judgment, Julius is posi
tioning himself in opposition to one of the central tenets of the con
servative literary tradition — the belief in objective, "unprejudiced"
criticism and "ideological restraint." At the same time, while he auspi
ciously rejects traditional criticism, he continues to attempt to work
within its boundaries by assuming, in his writing, the role of the
detached critic.
Julius backs away from a polemical stance. In the passage quoted
above, Julius claims that assessments based on anger are "especially dif
ficult to get right." The)' have the tendency, he claims, to sound
"embatded" or "querulous." Thus, his initial, confident affirmation of
anger is set against this final denouncement and dismissal. It is evident
that Julius fears that by openly voicing his own outrage, he, himself,
will sound "embatded" and "querulous," that he will sacrifice the
integrity of his critical stance, or that he will somehow fail the test of
competency as a critic and invalidate his own argument. The irony is,
that by attempting to balance the traditional role of the detached crit
ic with the nontraditional idea of power in personal anger, Julius effec
tively negates any critical potency he might gain from either position
taken in isolation. It seems that Julius may, in fact, be in a no-win sit
uation. His attempt at compromise is the force that ultimately jeopar
dizes his critical position by creating a tension in his work which can
not be resolved, a tension which leaves his argument open to attack by
conventional and unconventional critics alike.
T
X he ramifications of this position and this tension extend beyond
the internal conflict of this one book. Julius shares the concerns of
feminist, Marxist and ethnic theoreticians who, in the past several
decades, have attempted to bring to the study of an and literature a
new perspective deeply rooted in personal and / or historical and cul
tural concerns. This position is direcdy opposed to the traditionally
held notions of depersonalized, unbiased critical distance and hence
produces the conflict which we find both in Julius and in the acade
mic community at large. Julius defines his objective at the beginning
of chapter three as proving "that the study of the anti-Semitism of
'Sweeney Among the Nightingales' is the proper concern of literary

criticism." I would argue that this is the underlying objective of the
entire book. Julius seeks to prove that the study of any and all anti-
Semitic occurrences in the body of Eliot's work is appropriate and
important material for a scholarly critique. The tensions and short

comings discussed in detail
above suggest, however, that
Julius is not successful in
achieving his goal. The reader
comes away from the book
with an uneasy sense of a crit
ical stance that doesn't quite
work. But this is not to belitde
Julius's achievement. His
attempt at a critical synthesis,

the bringing together of two extremes, may, in the context of these
perspectives, be destined to fail, but the underlying sense of mediation,
of candid appraisal and compromise, seems perceptively well suited to
an honest reading of Eliot's work.
Eliot's poems are, in many ways, an insult to the Jewish people,
and while in any setting this sort of disrespect and disdain is repre
hensible, the growing trend toward racial sensitivity and political cor
rectness in the academic world makes it even more difficult to justify
the continued blind adoration and canonization of the poems. At the
same time, there is much about the poems that is as beautiful and
meaningful and universally compelling as anything that has been writ
ten. Julius understands both sides of the issue. He neither condemns
Eliot nor absolves him; he does not demand the dissolution of the tra
ditional prejudicial cannon or the establishment of a new criticism
more sensitive to personal or cultural interpretations, but neither does
he completely affirm the existing order. In terms of creating an unas
sailable critical standpoint, this ambivalent stance leaves Julius's argu
ment somewhat vulnerable; it is, nonetheless, a bold and honest view
point which is both morally conscious and true to the poetry. Julius
offers to the literary community an alternate way of looking at texts

which is problematic, but also
provocative. The most com
pelling value of Julius's "T.S.
Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and
Literary Form" is that it raises
questions, provokes debate
and discussion where before
there was only silence. For
while we cannot afford to dis
miss Eliot's work solely on the
basis of its anti-Semitism, nor
can we afford to remain silent
to the intolerance. Julius
declares that "to ignore art's

power to offend means failing to take it seriouslv." Eliot's poetry is
both brilliant and offensive, and Julius understands that to deny either
aspect is to offer a reductive and demeaning analysis which is anti
thetical to the complex nature of great an.
