eaders, old and new: Arcade welcomes you to our
second year as Stanford's quarterly magazine of politics and
culture — different guise, same publication. The impor
tance of brand names in the magazine business is exceeded
only by that of the household cleaning products industry.
So changing our nom deplume entailed a certain amount of
risk. In the spirit of Prince, we've allowed ourselves an
explanatory "magazine formerly known as Jr." on our cover
so as not to confuse our readership from our first year.
Why the change? Too many readers were asking me a
question I couldn't answer, namely: Why is it called Jr.? Add
tnat to the diminutive quality of the name and you've got a
case for change.
And the corollary question. Why Arcade? We mean
arcade literally, rather tnan as a reference to glowing hall
ways of electrical games and artificial entertainment. The
sandstone arcade of the Quad, with its columns and arches,
is the leitmotif of Stanford's architecture. And Arcade also
connotes the semi-mythical Arcadia, shorthand for the pas
toral paradise of ancient Greece, an image which — regard
less of its accuracy — is so often associated with our
University.
But our mission remains the same. You'll still find our
commitment to incorporating Stanford's faculty into the

student press, with English
Prof. Sharon Holland's essay
on cultural studies and
racial metaphor, along with
Pulitzer Prize-winning
author Dale Maharidges

We usually underestimate
THE ABILITY OF IDEAS TO TRANSFORM
THE WAY WE THINK AND LIVE.

take on what race relations in California are about to
become. We still offer the only print outlet at Stanford for
in-depth coverage of issues which deserve — and demand
— more than passing editorial attention. Check out our
cover story on Greek housing at Stanford and find out the
Rill story on why the University has ignored what appears to
be a major violation of its own principles of equality and
fairness. In the midst of a national discussion fraught with
hyperbole on all sides, get Dean of Undergraduate
Aamission James Montoyas scoop on the facts behind affir
mative action. And our readers will still be able to sample
the best critical and creative work in the literary arts at
Stanford, with new poetry by W. S. Di Piero and book
reviews on the most pressing intellectual debates of our day.
Arcade does not profess to change the world, or even
Stanford, with these writings. But I believe that we usually
underestimate the ability of ideas to transform the way we
think and live. Arcade offers something otherwise unheard
of at Stanford — a non partisan forum for sustained critical
inquiry into the issues wnich shape our lives at Stanford and
beyond. In an era of an impoverished public sphere —
within our University and our country — this is a radical
idea.
