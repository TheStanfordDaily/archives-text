# Downsizing Gerhard
## 
### 
Obviously Gerhard Casper isn't investing that hefty presidential salary
into some new wheels â€” Gerhard has forsaken his national roots in
the country that builds some of the world s best cars for what looks like
a mid-'7os Chevy (burgundy).

One wonders how he ever got Regina on a date with that jalopy. In
another gesture of allegiance with the country he now calls home,
Gerhard was also spotted snagging an all-American cold Budweiser at
the senior reception earlier this month.
