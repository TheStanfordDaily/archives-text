Q
vjometime between now and the 2000 presidential election, whites
are expected to fall below half the total California population — the
first white society on Earth to turn "minority majority.'' California is a
multicultural frontier. In five decides, the United States will be half
nonwhite. And other white nations, from France to Australia, are
becoming browner.
California hasn't exactly embraced this change. Ever since the 1992
Los Angeles unrest, the state's whites have erupted in an electoral
counter-riot. While whites are now 52.5 percent of the population, they
remain more than 80 percent of the voters. Many itch to put non
whites in their place; they've voted for prisons, harsher punishment for
criminals and the anti-immigrant Proposition 187. And this fall, they
also ended state-run affirmative action by approving Proposition 209.
This white riot would be just a California problem if not for the
fact that the whites who give these measures winning margins — about
4 million voters in a state of 32 million — are shaping a larger backlash
as the nation becomes polyracial.
During his first term, President Clinton initiated the federalization
of Proposition 187 by signing the immigration legislation recendy
passed by Congress. Early this election year, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-
Texas, declared Proposition 187, "The tidal wave that has washed up on
the shores of the Capitol" and Newt Gingrich has been eager to feder
alize it to prevent what he termed just before the Republican
Convention as "the decay of core parts of our civilization."
All this is coded language for the arrival of too many brown
skinned people and it is tied to other hot-button issues: crime, welfare
reform and affirmative action (which affects a host of racial and ethnic
groups in California).
The backlash will certainly extend beyond this election as the
nation becomes more nonwhite. This is the third or fourth time in his
tory that Californian xenophobia has directed national policy. The first
wave in the 1870s led to the exclusion of Chinese immigrants; later, the
Japanese were targeted. If not for agitation by California whites, the
state long ago would have been white minority and the United States
would be a lot less than the nearly three-fourths white that it is now.
In previous eras, California was successful in keeping out non
whites. Now, however, change is unstoppable. Even if the borders were
completely sealed to new immigration, the U.S. Census estimates that
as a result of birth patterns, four out of 10 Americans would be non
white in 2050.
In this new racial landscape, blacks are but a piece of the equation.
In California, there are 9 million Latinos, 3 million Asians, 2 million
blacks and an aggregate number of whites. Nationwide, the census says
that Latinos will surpass blacks in 2010; by 2050 Latinos and Asians will
outnumber blacks two to one.
Whites, of course, are responsible for much of this change. It
began when slaves were brought from Africa and Chinese laborers were
induced to Gold Rush California. For conservatives who fret about the
loss of "American" culture, their support of the Vietnam War and their
ongoing struggle to oust Fidel Castro, among other military adven
tures, brought other immigrants to America. And now, in the so-called
computer age, Latinos are virtually invited guest workers to do labor
citizens shun.
Are there too many immigrants coming? Maybe. Or maybe not.
That is not the real issue. The Mexican maid making beds in San
Diego is not responsible for AI & I laying off 40,000 workers or the
fact that 1 percent of American households control 42 percent of the
wealth.
Yet it's the Mexican maid that many whites dread as they look
toward the inevitable statistical turning point. They fear losing jobs and
culture. There's a boot kicking Americans in the head, and instead of
looking down for the source — at low-wage minority workers they
should look up. Regardless of race, everyone outside the privileged 1
percent is in the same boat. Conservatives who decry cultural change
ignore one of the real villains: unbridled multinational capitalism that

has no allegiance to the nation's citizens or its culture.
California can be the proving ground where America learns how
to function as a new society— a true mix of all cultures. Or California
driven division, a grand mutation of the wedge issue politics of the past
three decades, will scorch the rest of the nation with actual and
metaphorical fire beyond the wildest imagination of Nathanael West.
In California, unlike the rest of the nation, class and race are inter
twined. Back East, whites don't like living near blacks. Detroit is a
prime example, a "chocolate core surrounded by vanilla," said one
study. The opposite occurs in California. In plotting 1,551 major census
tracts, I found that concentrations of whites form vanilla drops sur
rounded by vast ethnic or transitional communities, mountain wilder
ness, or the ocean. These islands contain walled and gated neighbor
hoods, which exploded in number during the 1980s as the state became
browner. This demographic layout may be the future pattern in other
regions of the country as whites fall in numbers.
Yet even the whitest of the wealthy islands have 8 percent to 10 per
cent minority populations, largely Asian and Latino; a very few are
black. California doesn't represent traditional white flight, for there are
too few whites for a complete flight. Rather, this development is class
based. If they can afford to live behind the walls, different ethnicities

about so-called "reverse discrimination" than whites.
Nothing is simplistic in California's polyracial society. While
whites are driving the backlash, it's not stricdy a matter of whites vs.
nonwhites. For example, half of Asians and blacks voted for 187,
according to a Los Angeles Times poll. There is no rainbow. There are
instead many factionalizad hatreds — between blacks and Koreans,
Mexicans and Central Americans, and so on.
Even my liberal white friends mutter about the threat of a grow
ing minority population. When Proposition 187 passed, some liberals
clearly favored it, because two out of three voters were for it. I inter
viewed both liberals and conservatives who were pro-187, and individ
uals in both groups employed illegal immigrant nannies. Even Gov.
Pete Wilson, the white riot's cheerleader, once hired an undocumented
maid.
It's common to hear in California that the state could become like
Bosnia. More accurately, what is evolving is a Brazilian model, a first
world society inside the third world, with light skin being a prized but
not necessatry attribute.
Californians know subconsciously that their state is at the outer
limit of European conquest. This is obvious because it's where many
nonwhite immigrants have landed. Almost 8 million residents — a
quarter of the state — were born overseas, most in nonwhite nations,
according to the U.S. Census.
Californians have attempted to keep them out before. In the
1870s, when the transcontinental railroad was complete and Chinese
labor was no longer needed, Chinese immigrants were attacked. In
1871, the Los Angeles Chinatown was looted and 19 Chinese were
lynched. For two days starting July 23, 1877, several thousand whites
torched Chinese laundries in San Francisco and burned docks where
Chinese immigrants landed.
In 1876, California Rep. William A. Piper warned that many more
of the 450 million Chinese were coming. "The alarm excited by this
invasion is widespread, and the aid of Congress is invoked to put a stop
to this influx of semi-barbarians now threatening to outnumber the
