## The 						Coming of the White Minority The 						Future of race relations in California 
### Dale Maharidge 
Q
vjometime between now and the 2000 presidential election, whites
are expected to fall below half the total California population — the
first white society on Earth to turn "minority majority.'' California is a
multicultural frontier. In five decides, the United States will be half
nonwhite. And other white nations, from France to Australia, are
becoming browner.
California hasn't exactly embraced this change. Ever since the 1992
Los Angeles unrest, the state's whites have erupted in an electoral
counter-riot. While whites are now 52.5 percent of the population, they
remain more than 80 percent of the voters. Many itch to put non
whites in their place; they've voted for prisons, harsher punishment for
criminals and the anti-immigrant Proposition 187. And this fall, they
also ended state-run affirmative action by approving Proposition 209.
This white riot would be just a California problem if not for the
fact that the whites who give these measures winning margins — about
4 million voters in a state of 32 million — are shaping a larger backlash
as the nation becomes polyracial.
During his first term, President Clinton initiated the federalization
of Proposition 187 by signing the immigration legislation recendy
passed by Congress. Early this election year, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-
Texas, declared Proposition 187, "The tidal wave that has washed up on
the shores of the Capitol" and Newt Gingrich has been eager to feder
alize it to prevent what he termed just before the Republican
Convention as "the decay of core parts of our civilization."
All this is coded language for the arrival of too many brown
skinned people and it is tied to other hot-button issues: crime, welfare
reform and affirmative action (which affects a host of racial and ethnic
groups in California).
The backlash will certainly extend beyond this election as the
nation becomes more nonwhite. This is the third or fourth time in his
tory that Californian xenophobia has directed national policy. The first
wave in the 1870s led to the exclusion of Chinese immigrants; later, the
Japanese were targeted. If not for agitation by California whites, the
state long ago would have been white minority and the United States
would be a lot less than the nearly three-fourths white that it is now.
In previous eras, California was successful in keeping out non
whites. Now, however, change is unstoppable. Even if the borders were
completely sealed to new immigration, the U.S. Census estimates that
as a result of birth patterns, four out of 10 Americans would be non
white in 2050.
In this new racial landscape, blacks are but a piece of the equation.
In California, there are 9 million Latinos, 3 million Asians, 2 million
blacks and an aggregate number of whites. Nationwide, the census says
that Latinos will surpass blacks in 2010; by 2050 Latinos and Asians will
outnumber blacks two to one.
Whites, of course, are responsible for much of this change. It
began when slaves were brought from Africa and Chinese laborers were
induced to Gold Rush California. For conservatives who fret about the
loss of "American" culture, their support of the Vietnam War and their
ongoing struggle to oust Fidel Castro, among other military adven
tures, brought other immigrants to America. And now, in the so-called
computer age, Latinos are virtually invited guest workers to do labor
citizens shun.
Are there too many immigrants coming? Maybe. Or maybe not.
That is not the real issue. The Mexican maid making beds in San
Diego is not responsible for AI & I laying off 40,000 workers or the
fact that 1 percent of American households control 42 percent of the
wealth.
Yet it's the Mexican maid that many whites dread as they look
toward the inevitable statistical turning point. They fear losing jobs and
culture. There's a boot kicking Americans in the head, and instead of
looking down for the source — at low-wage minority workers they
should look up. Regardless of race, everyone outside the privileged 1
percent is in the same boat. Conservatives who decry cultural change
ignore one of the real villains: unbridled multinational capitalism that

has no allegiance to the nation's citizens or its culture.
California can be the proving ground where America learns how
to function as a new society— a true mix of all cultures. Or California
driven division, a grand mutation of the wedge issue politics of the past
three decades, will scorch the rest of the nation with actual and
metaphorical fire beyond the wildest imagination of Nathanael West.
In California, unlike the rest of the nation, class and race are inter
twined. Back East, whites don't like living near blacks. Detroit is a
prime example, a "chocolate core surrounded by vanilla," said one
study. The opposite occurs in California. In plotting 1,551 major census
tracts, I found that concentrations of whites form vanilla drops sur
rounded by vast ethnic or transitional communities, mountain wilder
ness, or the ocean. These islands contain walled and gated neighbor
hoods, which exploded in number during the 1980s as the state became
browner. This demographic layout may be the future pattern in other
regions of the country as whites fall in numbers.
Yet even the whitest of the wealthy islands have 8 percent to 10 per
cent minority populations, largely Asian and Latino; a very few are
black. California doesn't represent traditional white flight, for there are
too few whites for a complete flight. Rather, this development is class
based. If they can afford to live behind the walls, different ethnicities

about so-called "reverse discrimination" than whites.
Nothing is simplistic in California's polyracial society. While
whites are driving the backlash, it's not stricdy a matter of whites vs.
nonwhites. For example, half of Asians and blacks voted for 187,
according to a Los Angeles Times poll. There is no rainbow. There are
instead many factionalizad hatreds — between blacks and Koreans,
Mexicans and Central Americans, and so on.
Even my liberal white friends mutter about the threat of a grow
ing minority population. When Proposition 187 passed, some liberals
clearly favored it, because two out of three voters were for it. I inter
viewed both liberals and conservatives who were pro-187, and individ
uals in both groups employed illegal immigrant nannies. Even Gov.
Pete Wilson, the white riot's cheerleader, once hired an undocumented
maid.
It's common to hear in California that the state could become like
Bosnia. More accurately, what is evolving is a Brazilian model, a first
world society inside the third world, with light skin being a prized but
not necessatry attribute.
Californians know subconsciously that their state is at the outer
limit of European conquest. This is obvious because it's where many
nonwhite immigrants have landed. Almost 8 million residents — a
quarter of the state — were born overseas, most in nonwhite nations,
according to the U.S. Census.
Californians have attempted to keep them out before. In the
1870s, when the transcontinental railroad was complete and Chinese
labor was no longer needed, Chinese immigrants were attacked. In
1871, the Los Angeles Chinatown was looted and 19 Chinese were
lynched. For two days starting July 23, 1877, several thousand whites
torched Chinese laundries in San Francisco and burned docks where
Chinese immigrants landed.
In 1876, California Rep. William A. Piper warned that many more
of the 450 million Chinese were coming. "The alarm excited by this
invasion is widespread, and the aid of Congress is invoked to put a stop
to this influx of semi-barbarians now threatening to outnumber the
white population of the Pacific Coast," said Piper. In 1882, Congress
gave in to California's pressure and passed the Chinese Exclusion Act.
It was not until 1965 that Asians were allowed true equal immigration
status.
Today, of course, politicians can't use Piper's language. Instead,
Newt Gingrich talks about a "true cultural challenge" as he calls for
English-only legislation. But the message is the same, even though,
most of the focus today is directed at Latinos. When Gingrich talks
about America losing its culture, he parrots myth. In 15 years of report
ing in California, talking with many hundreds of people of all races, I
was never confronted with a society that is splintering but one that is
striving to be whole. Many immigrants speak Spanish or Asian tongues
and are indeed quite different, but their children's English is fine and
they are "assimilating" just like immigrants have always done. For good
or ill, they have the same materialistic wants of fourth-generation
Americans. The only revolution desired by most is a personal and eco
nomic one: owning BMWs and living in suburbs. White Americans
have nothing to fear from them. The America that is emerging is not
that much different than the one we now know — it just has a browner
face.
T
-L he country is now entering the most fragile period in the history
of its race relations. A problem, of course, is that the racial transforma
tion is happening concurrent with the hardening of class divisions.
Much of my research has been conducted in South East Los
Angeles, a sprawling community of nearly 400,000, most of whom are
new Latino immigrants. The annual per capita income is less than
$6,500, compared with $30,000 in one wealthy Orange County city to
the south. Many in the area work to find hope and hope to find work,
resorting to selling coconuts and oranges on street corners.
I think of what would have happened if my paternal grandparents
— who came from the Ukraine after the turn of the century — were
to arrive today. Then there were jobs in coal mines and steel mills
which provided their ticket to the middle class. It's the lack of jobs —
nothing else — that makes this new wave of immigrants different from
them. If the Eastern Europeans found no jobs other than selling apples,
the history of their adaptation would have been far different.
Industry is exploiting this racial transformation. It represents the
classic desires of business. "There's always a pool of ready and willing
workers," said Robert Wilberg, a union organizer in Orange County.
With a porous border, organizing workers to raise wages and benefits
as the Europeans did early this century is much more difficult, he said.
But it's possible, he believes, with relentless organizing, here and across
the border. He sees little hope in white business leaders becoming
enlightened. Of Orange County's walled neighborhoods, he said, "It's
the last bastion of whites. They believe they can close the world out.
They think it won't influence them."
Integral to organizing will be how the Democrats engage the new
racial dynamic. Before Proposition 187 passed, Jack Kemp and William
Bennett issued a warning that Republicans were making a repeat of the
mistake they made at the turn of the century, when the party attacked
immigrants and pushed several generations of Irish and Italians to the
Democrats.
Latinos are one-third of the population but just 8 percent to 10
percent of the California electorate. Democrats have long ignored
organizing Latinos, a community that studies show responds not to
slick mailers and television, but door-to-door work. With some effort,
Latino turnout could be doubled, a voting block that along with tra
ditional white liberals and blacks could turn California — and the
nation — away from the politics of division.
"The country has been East-West oriented," said Antonio
Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Education Project which
works to register Latinos. "But the new reality is a North-South reali
ty," he said, speaking of the of the haves vs. the have-nots. For too long,
Gonzalez says, California Democrats were "driven by the old guard
coalition oflabor, blacks and liberals. They're still living in the past in
determining what the Latino vote is about."
Meanwhile, whites are afraid and retreating behind walls. In the
exclusive canyon neighborhoods of West Ixjs Angeles, I saw new walls

going up, as well as layers being added to existing walls. I had been in
El Salvador during the civil war, in the hills above the capital. As Joan
Didion noted about those rich hill dwellers, as fear of domestic unrest
rose, the Salvadoran elite added layers to their walls.
This isn't much different. The walls wont work. Whites have to be
shown that alienating nonwhites is incredibly stupid. One California
study shows that in 2003, only 15 percent of those entering the work
force will be white males. If nonwhites aren't working, who will pay the
taxes? Inclusion must not be sold as a nice liberal idea, but in terms of
self-interest.
California Assemblywoman Martha Escutia, a Democrat who rep

resents the sprawling
immigrant area of South
East Los Angeles,
believes this argument is
the key. "You've got to
realize that the only way
whites will come into the
picture is if they see an
economic self-interest
with blacks and Latinos

If the eastern europeans

and Chinese working together," said Escutia. "The security of the
country is at risk if you do not train a viable segment of the labor pool."
And in contrast to the Rights English-only call, Escutia notes the
nation should encourage bi- and tri-lingualism in the primary grades,
to prepare children to compete in a global economy. Someone who
speaks fluent Spanish, Japanese and English and knows a skill will
never lack for a job.
As for affirmative action, white California voters who voted in
favor of Proposition 209 should reconsider their choice. At several
University of California campuses, whites have been given de facto
affirmative action over Asian students. As whites continue to shrink in
numbers across the United States, they will need affirmative action —
which really means inclusion — as much as any group.
The key word is, in fact, inclusion. In a society where no group

the economic future is

fear. Living in California, it is easy to forget just how much does work.
Let's not blow it. Think about what Germany or France — roughly 6
percent nonwhite — would be like if it they were even 10 percent
minority.
The continuation of wedge issue politics is dangerous. The answer
lies in all of us, no matter our race or party affiliation. We can choose
to elect mean-spirited politicians; we can retreat behind walls like cow
ards; we can blame others; we can choose to wallow in hate instead of
engaging in positive action.
Or we can go forward.

outnumber blacks two to one.
Whites, of course, are responsible for much of this change. It
began when slaves were brought from Africa and Chinese laborers were
induced to Gold Rush California. For conservatives who fret about the
loss of "American" culture, their support of the Vietnam War and their
ongoing struggle to oust Fidel Castro, among other military adven
tures, brought other immigrants to America. And now, in the so-called
computer age, Latinos are virtually invited guest workers to do labor
citizens shun.
Are there too many immigrants coming? Maybe. Or maybe not.
That is not the real issue. The Mexican maid making beds in San
Diego is not responsible for AI & I laying off 40,000 workers or the
fact that 1 percent of American households control 42 percent of the
wealth.
Yet it's the Mexican maid that many whites dread as they look
toward the inevitable statistical turning point. They fear losing jobs and
culture. There's a boot kicking Americans in the head, and instead of
looking down for the source — at low-wage minority workers they
should look up. Regardless of race, everyone outside the privileged 1
percent is in the same boat. Conservatives who decry cultural change
ignore one of the real villains: unbridled multinational capitalism that

has no allegiance to the nation's citizens or its culture.
California can be the proving ground where America learns how
to function as a new society— a true mix of all cultures. Or California
driven division, a grand mutation of the wedge issue politics of the past
three decades, will scorch the rest of the nation with actual and
metaphorical fire beyond the wildest imagination of Nathanael West.
In California, unlike the rest of the nation, class and race are inter
twined. Back East, whites don't like living near blacks. Detroit is a
prime example, a "chocolate core surrounded by vanilla," said one
study. The opposite occurs in California. In plotting 1,551 major census
tracts, I found that concentrations of whites form vanilla drops sur
rounded by vast ethnic or transitional communities, mountain wilder
ness, or the ocean. These islands contain walled and gated neighbor
hoods, which exploded in number during the 1980s as the state became
browner. This demographic layout may be the future pattern in other
regions of the country as whites fall in numbers.
Yet even the whitest of the wealthy islands have 8 percent to 10 per
cent minority populations, largely Asian and Latino; a very few are
black. California doesn't represent traditional white flight, for there are
too few whites for a complete flight. Rather, this development is class
based. If they can afford to live behind the walls, different ethnicities

about so-called "reverse discrimination" than whites.
Nothing is simplistic in California's polyracial society. While
whites are driving the backlash, it's not stricdy a matter of whites vs.
nonwhites. For example, half of Asians and blacks voted for 187,
according to a Los Angeles Times poll. There is no rainbow. There are
instead many factionalizad hatreds — between blacks and Koreans,
Mexicans and Central Americans, and so on.
Even my liberal white friends mutter about the threat of a grow
ing minority population. When Proposition 187 passed, some liberals
clearly favored it, because two out of three voters were for it. I inter
viewed both liberals and conservatives who were pro-187, and individ
uals in both groups employed illegal immigrant nannies. Even Gov.
Pete Wilson, the white riot's cheerleader, once hired an undocumented
maid.
It's common to hear in California that the state could become like
Bosnia. More accurately, what is evolving is a Brazilian model, a first
world society inside the third world, with light skin being a prized but
not necessatry attribute.
Californians know subconsciously that their state is at the outer
limit of European conquest. This is obvious because it's where many
nonwhite immigrants have landed. Almost 8 million residents — a
quarter of the state — were born overseas, most in nonwhite nations,
according to the U.S. Census.
Californians have attempted to keep them out before. In the
1870s, when the transcontinental railroad was complete and Chinese
labor was no longer needed, Chinese immigrants were attacked. In
1871, the Los Angeles Chinatown was looted and 19 Chinese were
lynched. For two days starting July 23, 1877, several thousand whites
torched Chinese laundries in San Francisco and burned docks where
Chinese immigrants landed.
In 1876, California Rep. William A. Piper warned that many more
of the 450 million Chinese were coming. "The alarm excited by this
invasion is widespread, and the aid of Congress is invoked to put a stop
to this influx of semi-barbarians now threatening to outnumber the
white population of the Pacific Coast," said Piper. In 1882, Congress
gave in to California's pressure and passed the Chinese Exclusion Act.
It was not until 1965 that Asians were allowed true equal immigration
status.
Today, of course, politicians can't use Piper's language. Instead,
Newt Gingrich talks about a "true cultural challenge" as he calls for
English-only legislation. But the message is the same, even though,
most of the focus today is directed at Latinos. When Gingrich talks
about America losing its culture, he parrots myth. In 15 years of report
ing in California, talking with many hundreds of people of all races, I
was never confronted with a society that is splintering but one that is
striving to be whole. Many immigrants speak Spanish or Asian tongues
and are indeed quite different, but their children's English is fine and
they are "assimilating" just like immigrants have always done. For good
or ill, they have the same materialistic wants of fourth-generation
Americans. The only revolution desired by most is a personal and eco
nomic one: owning BMWs and living in suburbs. White Americans
have nothing to fear from them. The America that is emerging is not
that much different than the one we now know — it just has a browner
face.
T
-L he country is now entering the most fragile period in the history
of its race relations. A problem, of course, is that the racial transforma
tion is happening concurrent with the hardening of class divisions.
Much of my research has been conducted in South East Los
Angeles, a sprawling community of nearly 400,000, most of whom are
new Latino immigrants. The annual per capita income is less than
$6,500, compared with $30,000 in one wealthy Orange County city to
the south. Many in the area work to find hope and hope to find work,
resorting to selling coconuts and oranges on street corners.
I think of what would have happened if my paternal grandparents
— who came from the Ukraine after the turn of the century — were
to arrive today. Then there were jobs in coal mines and steel mills
which provided their ticket to the middle class. It's the lack of jobs —
nothing else — that makes this new wave of immigrants different from
them. If the Eastern Europeans found no jobs other than selling apples,
the history of their adaptation would have been far different.
Industry is exploiting this racial transformation. It represents the
classic desires of business. "There's always a pool of ready and willing
workers," said Robert Wilberg, a union organizer in Orange County.
With a porous border, organizing workers to raise wages and benefits
as the Europeans did early this century is much more difficult, he said.
But it's possible, he believes, with relentless organizing, here and across
the border. He sees little hope in white business leaders becoming
enlightened. Of Orange County's walled neighborhoods, he said, "It's
the last bastion of whites. They believe they can close the world out.
They think it won't influence them."
Integral to organizing will be how the Democrats engage the new
racial dynamic. Before Proposition 187 passed, Jack Kemp and William
Bennett issued a warning that Republicans were making a repeat of the
mistake they made at the turn of the century, when the party attacked
immigrants and pushed several generations of Irish and Italians to the
Democrats.
Latinos are one-third of the population but just 8 percent to 10
percent of the California electorate. Democrats have long ignored
organizing Latinos, a community that studies show responds not to
slick mailers and television, but door-to-door work. With some effort,
Latino turnout could be doubled, a voting block that along with tra
ditional white liberals and blacks could turn California — and the
nation — away from the politics of division.
"The country has been East-West oriented," said Antonio
Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Education Project which
works to register Latinos. "But the new reality is a North-South reali
ty," he said, speaking of the of the haves vs. the have-nots. For too long,
Gonzalez says, California Democrats were "driven by the old guard
coalition oflabor, blacks and liberals. They're still living in the past in
determining what the Latino vote is about."
Meanwhile, whites are afraid and retreating behind walls. In the
exclusive canyon neighborhoods of West Ixjs Angeles, I saw new walls

going up, as well as layers being added to existing walls. I had been in
El Salvador during the civil war, in the hills above the capital. As Joan
Didion noted about those rich hill dwellers, as fear of domestic unrest
rose, the Salvadoran elite added layers to their walls.
This isn't much different. The walls wont work. Whites have to be
shown that alienating nonwhites is incredibly stupid. One California
study shows that in 2003, only 15 percent of those entering the work
force will be white males. If nonwhites aren't working, who will pay the
taxes? Inclusion must not be sold as a nice liberal idea, but in terms of
self-interest.
California Assemblywoman Martha Escutia, a Democrat who rep

resents the sprawling
immigrant area of South
East Los Angeles,
believes this argument is
the key. "You've got to
realize that the only way
whites will come into the
picture is if they see an
economic self-interest
with blacks and Latinos

If the eastern europeans

and Chinese working together," said Escutia. "The security of the
country is at risk if you do not train a viable segment of the labor pool."
And in contrast to the Rights English-only call, Escutia notes the
nation should encourage bi- and tri-lingualism in the primary grades,
to prepare children to compete in a global economy. Someone who
speaks fluent Spanish, Japanese and English and knows a skill will
never lack for a job.
As for affirmative action, white California voters who voted in
favor of Proposition 209 should reconsider their choice. At several
University of California campuses, whites have been given de facto
affirmative action over Asian students. As whites continue to shrink in
numbers across the United States, they will need affirmative action —
which really means inclusion — as much as any group.
The key word is, in fact, inclusion. In a society where no group

comprises more than
four out of 10 residents,
the economic future is
tied to all races working
toward a common goal.

fear. Living in California, it is easy to forget just how much does work.
Let's not blow it. Think about what Germany or France — roughly 6
percent nonwhite — would be like if it they were even 10 percent
minority.
The continuation of wedge issue politics is dangerous. The answer
lies in all of us, no matter our race or party affiliation. We can choose
to elect mean-spirited politicians; we can retreat behind walls like cow
ards; we can blame others; we can choose to wallow in hate instead of
engaging in positive action.
Or we can go forward.

Q
vjometime between now and the 2000 presidential election, whites
are expected to fall below half the total California population — the
first white society on Earth to turn "minority majority.'' California is a
multicultural frontier. In five decides, the United States will be half
nonwhite. And other white nations, from France to Australia, are
becoming browner.
California hasn't exactly embraced this change. Ever since the 1992
Los Angeles unrest, the state's whites have erupted in an electoral
counter-riot. While whites are now 52.5 percent of the population, they
remain more than 80 percent of the voters. Many itch to put non
whites in their place; they've voted for prisons, harsher punishment for
criminals and the anti-immigrant Proposition 187. And this fall, they
also ended state-run affirmative action by approving Proposition 209.
This white riot would be just a California problem if not for the
fact that the whites who give these measures winning margins — about
4 million voters in a state of 32 million — are shaping a larger backlash
as the nation becomes polyracial.
During his first term, President Clinton initiated the federalization
of Proposition 187 by signing the immigration legislation recendy
passed by Congress. Early this election year, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-
Texas, declared Proposition 187, "The tidal wave that has washed up on
the shores of the Capitol" and Newt Gingrich has been eager to feder
alize it to prevent what he termed just before the Republican
Convention as "the decay of core parts of our civilization."
All this is coded language for the arrival of too many brown
skinned people and it is tied to other hot-button issues: crime, welfare
reform and affirmative action (which affects a host of racial and ethnic
groups in California).
The backlash will certainly extend beyond this election as the
nation becomes more nonwhite. This is the third or fourth time in his
tory that Californian xenophobia has directed national policy. The first
wave in the 1870s led to the exclusion of Chinese immigrants; later, the
Japanese were targeted. If not for agitation by California whites, the
state long ago would have been white minority and the United States
would be a lot less than the nearly three-fourths white that it is now.
In previous eras, California was successful in keeping out non
whites. Now, however, change is unstoppable. Even if the borders were
completely sealed to new immigration, the U.S. Census estimates that
as a result of birth patterns, four out of 10 Americans would be non
white in 2050.
In this new racial landscape, blacks are but a piece of the equation.
In California, there are 9 million Latinos, 3 million Asians, 2 million
blacks and an aggregate number of whites. Nationwide, the census says
that Latinos will surpass blacks in 2010; by 2050 Latinos and Asians will
outnumber blacks two to one.
Whites, of course, are responsible for much of this change. It

about so-called "reverse discrimination" than whites.
Nothing is simplistic in California's polyracial society. While
whites are driving the backlash, it's not stricdy a matter of whites vs.
nonwhites. For example, half of Asians and blacks voted for 187,
according to a Los Angeles Times poll. There is no rainbow. There are
instead many factionalizad hatreds — between blacks and Koreans,
Mexicans and Central Americans, and so on.
Even my liberal white friends mutter about the threat of a grow
ing minority population. When Proposition 187 passed, some liberals
clearly favored it, because two out of three voters were for it. I inter
viewed both liberals and conservatives who were pro-187, and individ
uals in both groups employed illegal immigrant nannies. Even Gov.
Pete Wilson, the white riot's cheerleader, once hired an undocumented
maid.
It's common to hear in California that the state could become like
Bosnia. More accurately, what is evolving is a Brazilian model, a first
world society inside the third world, with light skin being a prized but
not necessatry attribute.
Californians know subconsciously that their state is at the outer
limit of European conquest. This is obvious because it's where many
nonwhite immigrants have landed. Almost 8 million residents — a
quarter of the state — were born overseas, most in nonwhite nations,
according to the U.S. Census.
Californians have attempted to keep them out before. In the
1870s, when the transcontinental railroad was complete and Chinese
labor was no longer needed, Chinese immigrants were attacked. In
1871, the Los Angeles Chinatown was looted and 19 Chinese were
lynched. For two days starting July 23, 1877, several thousand whites
torched Chinese laundries in San Francisco and burned docks where
Chinese immigrants landed.
In 1876, California Rep. William A. Piper warned that many more
of the 450 million Chinese were coming. "The alarm excited by this
invasion is widespread, and the aid of Congress is invoked to put a stop
to this influx of semi-barbarians now threatening to outnumber the
white population of the Pacific Coast," said Piper. In 1882, Congress
gave in to California's pressure and passed the Chinese Exclusion Act.
It was not until 1965 that Asians were allowed true equal immigration
status.
Today, of course, politicians can't use Piper's language. Instead,
Newt Gingrich talks about a "true cultural challenge" as he calls for
English-only legislation. But the message is the same, even though,
most of the focus today is directed at Latinos. When Gingrich talks
about America losing its culture, he parrots myth. In 15 years of report
ing in California, talking with many hundreds of people of all races, I
was never confronted with a society that is splintering but one that is
striving to be whole. Many immigrants speak Spanish or Asian tongues
and are indeed quite different, but their children's English is fine and
they are "assimilating" just like immigrants have always done. For good
or ill, they have the same materialistic wants of fourth-generation
Americans. The only revolution desired by most is a personal and eco
nomic one: owning BMWs and living in suburbs. White Americans
have nothing to fear from them. The America that is emerging is not
that much different than the one we now know — it just has a browner
face.
T
-L he country is now entering the most fragile period in the history
of its race relations. A problem, of course, is that the racial transforma
tion is happening concurrent with the hardening of class divisions.
Much of my research has been conducted in South East Los
Angeles, a sprawling community of nearly 400,000, most of whom are
new Latino immigrants. The annual per capita income is less than
$6,500, compared with $30,000 in one wealthy Orange County city to
the south. Many in the area work to find hope and hope to find work,
resorting to selling coconuts and oranges on street corners.
I think of what would have happened if my paternal grandparents
— who came from the Ukraine after the turn of the century — were
to arrive today. Then there were jobs in coal mines and steel mills
which provided their ticket to the middle class. It's the lack of jobs —
nothing else — that makes this new wave of immigrants different from
them. If the Eastern Europeans found no jobs other than selling apples,
the history of their adaptation would have been far different.
Industry is exploiting this racial transformation. It represents the
classic desires of business. "There's always a pool of ready and willing
workers," said Robert Wilberg, a union organizer in Orange County.
With a porous border, organizing workers to raise wages and benefits
as the Europeans did early this century is much more difficult, he said.
But it's possible, he believes, with relentless organizing, here and across
the border. He sees little hope in white business leaders becoming
enlightened. Of Orange County's walled neighborhoods, he said, "It's
the last bastion of whites. They believe they can close the world out.
They think it won't influence them."
Integral to organizing will be how the Democrats engage the new
racial dynamic. Before Proposition 187 passed, Jack Kemp and William
Bennett issued a warning that Republicans were making a repeat of the
mistake they made at the turn of the century, when the party attacked
immigrants and pushed several generations of Irish and Italians to the
Democrats.
Latinos are one-third of the population but just 8 percent to 10
percent of the California electorate. Democrats have long ignored
organizing Latinos, a community that studies show responds not to
slick mailers and television, but door-to-door work. With some effort,
Latino turnout could be doubled, a voting block that along with tra
ditional white liberals and blacks could turn California — and the
nation — away from the politics of division.
"The country has been East-West oriented," said Antonio
Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Education Project which
works to register Latinos. "But the new reality is a North-South reali
ty," he said, speaking of the of the haves vs. the have-nots. For too long,
Gonzalez says, California Democrats were "driven by the old guard
coalition oflabor, blacks and liberals. They're still living in the past in
determining what the Latino vote is about."
Meanwhile, whites are afraid and retreating behind walls. In the
exclusive canyon neighborhoods of West Ixjs Angeles, I saw new walls

going up, as well as layers being added to existing walls. I had been in
El Salvador during the civil war, in the hills above the capital. As Joan
Didion noted about those rich hill dwellers, as fear of domestic unrest
rose, the Salvadoran elite added layers to their walls.
This isn't much different. The walls wont work. Whites have to be
shown that alienating nonwhites is incredibly stupid. One California
study shows that in 2003, only 15 percent of those entering the work
force will be white males. If nonwhites aren't working, who will pay the
taxes? Inclusion must not be sold as a nice liberal idea, but in terms of
self-interest.
California Assemblywoman Martha Escutia, a Democrat who rep

resents the sprawling
immigrant area of South
East Los Angeles,
believes this argument is
the key. "You've got to
realize that the only way
whites will come into the
picture is if they see an
economic self-interest

and Chinese working together," said Escutia. "The security of the
country is at risk if you do not train a viable segment of the labor pool."
And in contrast to the Rights English-only call, Escutia notes the
nation should encourage bi- and tri-lingualism in the primary grades,
to prepare children to compete in a global economy. Someone who
speaks fluent Spanish, Japanese and English and knows a skill will
never lack for a job.
As for affirmative action, white California voters who voted in
favor of Proposition 209 should reconsider their choice. At several
University of California campuses, whites have been given de facto
affirmative action over Asian students. As whites continue to shrink in
numbers across the United States, they will need affirmative action —
which really means inclusion — as much as any group.
The key word is, in fact, inclusion. In a society where no group

comprises more than
four out of 10 residents,
the economic future is
tied to all races working
toward a common goal.

fear. Living in California, it is easy to forget just how much does work.
Let's not blow it. Think about what Germany or France — roughly 6
percent nonwhite — would be like if it they were even 10 percent
minority.
The continuation of wedge issue politics is dangerous. The answer
lies in all of us, no matter our race or party affiliation. We can choose
to elect mean-spirited politicians; we can retreat behind walls like cow
ards; we can blame others; we can choose to wallow in hate instead of
engaging in positive action.
Or we can go forward.
