# Life as Metaphor

I will never grow old. My hands will never be discolored with the spots of
age. I will never have varicose veins. ... I will never because I exist in this
moment. In this moment there is no room for old age. I am not protected,
remember? Old is for people who are protected. The unprotected have to
die young.
— Bill T. Jones, "Last Night on Earth"
In the "Cultural Studies" anthology, the editors define the field as
"an interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary and sometimes counter-discipli
nary field that operates in the tension between its tendencies to embrace
both a broad, anthropological and more narrowly humanistic concep
tion of culture." They later add that "the politics of the analysis and the
politics of the intellectual work are inseparable." From the outset, the
authors recognize the revolutionary capabilities of any cultural studies
project. As a scholar and a teacher, I find cultural studies to be an appro
priate niche — one that both addresses my eclectic interests and satis
fies my entrenched belief that all intellectual inquiry is deeply political
and highly subjective.
Many years of teaching in a college classroom have demonstrated
the validity of the latter statement. I know from the expression of sur
prise on my students' faces when I walk into a classroom that many of
them do not expect their instructor to be black and female. This reac-

tionary moment dictates the
class dynamics for the remainder
of the quarter and colors all of
our interactions. Their surprise is
significant because it indicates to
me that they have most likely
purchased the books and
perused the tentative syllabus
with an image of their instructor

already packaged to go along with the course materials. Their surprise
tells me that they will not be reading as color-blind consumers of fic
tion; they will be reading the text and they will be reading me. For those
surprised students, I am a new entity, a fiction of sorts, that they will
have to engage and understand at the same time that they are exploring
the literature in question. Like the works of an before them, I am in
abstract — and I become realized in that moment between textual
interpretations.
These moments in the classroom are bittersweet — they provide a
mirror of the sad history of discrimination in this country and they also
indicate the extent to which women and people of color are devalued
in this culture. The devaluing is not so much deliberate, as it is neces
sary. In order to survive in this culture, I was schooled in the life of my
white counterparts — I spent the majority of my time in the places they
frequented and the institutions they owned. Knowing whiteness proved
invaluable to me — white people had a place in my emotional and
intellectual development and ultimately in the shape of my humanity.
I am hard-pressed to discern what place I have in the imaginations of
my white students and colleagues; however, the fact that my appearance
in the classroom is cause for surprise indicates to me that they still do
not see me, and when there is a moment of recognition, I materialize as
an impediment to an already well-formulated vision. I am literally, a
metaphor — figurative language, only — existing on the fringes of the
minds of my students and our national imagination.
This rather subjective and intimate appraisal of my own subjectiv
ity leads me to perform, by way of example, a reading of the importance
of metaphor in the contemporary landscape. I will take my example
from the campus debate between Dinesh D'Souza and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson on affirmative action. On at least two occasions during the
debate, D'Souza referred to Jackson's frequent use of metaphor as some
what meaningless, especially in the face of the orgy of statistical evi
dence that D'Souza managed to conjure. As someone who's built a
career examining metaphor and spent a lifetime living it, I was some
what shocked — first Nietzsche tells us that God is dead and then
D'Souza lets us have it with the Derridaean second death of metaphor.
While I was in some agreement with D'Souza on the effectiveness of
Jackson's rebuttals, I was not at all convinced that Jackson should have
abandoned the frequent references to the past and the use of figurative

language. I was also intrigued by D Souzas casual use of the black stu
dent as a figure (much like Freud's early female) who is always lacking
— in study skills, in cultural cohesiveness, etc., etc.
The black figure has constandy been the metaphorical scapegoat
for all that has gone wrong with a civilized society. In trying to work my
way out of the anger inspired by such consistent abuse, I began to think
about Tupac Shakur and the aftermath of his death. During the week
when it became clear that Tupac was going to die, I witnessed various
outcries from across the country in the media and in print — most of
America said good riddance, and many commented on Shakur s sever
al opportunities to leave his "thug life" and his decision to remain where
he had always been. I then began to think about how many of us are
given opportunities to change, especially through access to education,
but decide to remain where we are — mired in a present that is satisfy
ing and potentially lucrative. I also began to think about the irony of
the solidification of the negative black image in the public mind at the
same time as a solidification of the call to "reverse" all forms of dis
crimination.
In order to drive this point home, I'd like to use a parallel allegory of
sorts and perform a reversal of roles. Say there is a certain son whose
father and grandfather before him have been in the same business —
it's run by the family, and it stays in the family. This son has no qualms
about what he'll be doing when he grows up — he'll continue the fam
ily industry, of course. Now say that son takes over the company reigns
and during his watch a few bad things happen — things which result
in the demise of other families, but ultimately are considered necessary
to the normal flow of business. On the news these bodies look like casu
alties, on the market they are the invisible statistics of corporate down
sizing. This son continues to conduct business aware of the casualties
but immune to their suffering — it is the norm. This is the way that
business is always conducted; there is no need to change.
Now, who is this son? It could be Tupac or it could be John
Kennedy Jr. Yet we find Tupac with the gun in his hand so much more
menacing to society than the figure of the Fortune 500 CEO with the
pen and the power to kill. We can't hide from the forces that psychical
ly reinforce our ability to see some players as inherendy bad and others
as structurally benign. We have a past built upon this kind of under
standing of ways of being together in the world. But we can begin to
truly "reverse" our collective ways of seeing. The laws of physics say that
what makes gravity work is its equal and opposite pull — it's all about
balance. I know that every time I walk into a classroom and confront
the surprise of my students, I am participating in this balancing act, in
this reversal. If we want to ameliorate a problem which is centuries old,
wouldn't we have to give it its equal and opposite space to secure a rem
edy? Is 30 years really enough time to heal the wounds of centuries? Do
we have hearts which are deep enough and wide enough to envision the
lives of our grandchildren's children? When do metaphors slip from
their residence in the figurative and become realized in the literal?
In a world where die past does not matter, where metaphor has no
place, we can hardly differentiate between good and evil, between right
and wrong — we can hardly begin to solve the political problem of our
collective humanity. And we constandy barter our humanity for a
chance to climb Jacob's ladder every second; we worry, worry, worry
about those ahead of us and those behind us who wish to take our
place. I have realized that D'Souza and Jackson were having two very
different conversations about "race;" I have realized that the rest of us
do the same — we fail to see what is always before us. We have little
room for an integrated imagination — we continue to rehearse the
same scripts with the same players. Thirty years of civil rights legislation
has proved that we can change the law, but we cannot so readily change
the mind or the imaginative matrix from which each person gleans an
interpretive strategy that helps them negotiate this world of ours. We
need more revolutionary intellectual endeavors that can discover the
loopholes and radically alter the relationship between the mind and the
metaphors that hold it in place.
