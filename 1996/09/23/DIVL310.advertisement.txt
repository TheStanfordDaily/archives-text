Your homework
just got easier.
A| Tough homework problems are no match for the new
release of Mathematica 3.0. Use it as easily as a calculator,
but tackle computations only Mathematica can handle You can

even solve problems directly from your textbooks and assign
ments. Mathematical new
buttons and palettes provide
quick point-and-click access to
thousands of functions, formu
las, and mathematical symbols.
Whether your courses are
in engineering, calculus, statistics
finance, chemistry, physics, biology, psychology, or any other
field of study where calculation is required, Mathematica for Students is
well suited for your needs. Less sophisticated
technical software programs only offer limited, stripped-down student versions, but
Mathematica for Students gives you exactly the same power and functionality as
our professional version, preferred at leading corporations, universities, and
government organizations worldwide. Visit your local campus bookstore or call
Wolfram Research at: 1 -800-943-9626 (US (onoda).
