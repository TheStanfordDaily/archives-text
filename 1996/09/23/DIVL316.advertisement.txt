$200,000 REWARD
$200,000 to be split among the legislators who sponsor the following
bill (or something similar) once it is signed into law. The $200,000
will be paid in any way that is legal (donated to a charity, paid to a
national committee, etc.) at the legislator's request.
CASH AWARDS FOR ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE BILL
To encourage academic excellence, each public high school in the
U.S. will be allocated $200,000 in cash prizes to be awarded to the
top 10 seniors, juniors, and possibly sophomores each year. Students
would take a national exam like the SAT, and the top scorers would
share the $200,000 and have their names engraved in a permanent
series of plaques at the school. Top scorers might also be interviewed
by local media.
The cost would be approximately $3.2 billion a year. If the program
were restricted to "disadvantaged areas," the cost would be much
lower and could be viewed as "motivated welfare."
The idea is to glorify academic excellence and motivate kids to study.
