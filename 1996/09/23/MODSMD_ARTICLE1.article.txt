## Wells Fargo offers new payment plan 
### Tienlon Ho 
Lines at Old Union may soon
become shorter now that Wells
Fargo and Stanford have imple
mented a free banking service
called Bill-Pay.
Begun earlier this month, Bill-
Pay allows users to transfer funds
from a Wells Fargo account to the
University using an automatic
teller machine, a telephone or the
World Wide Web. Anyone with a
combination Stanford / ATM card
can utilize this service for free to
pay any bills collected by the Bur
sar's Office — phone bills, tuition
bills, Stanford Card Plan pay
ments — without ever signing a
check or buying a stamp.
Bursar Jon Erickson said he
expects the new program to be
popular among students and staff.
According to Erickson, about
10,000 Stanford cards linked to
Wells Fargo have been issued
since the program's initiation last
fall. Information about the new
payment program will be mailed
along with the October phone bill.
Erickson was asked to test out
the new payment program and
found both the ATM and phone
methods to be considerably more
convenient than conventional
check-writing.
"But the online option, that is
slick," he said. "It really is neat — an
easy, efficient way to get everything
done from practically anywhere."
