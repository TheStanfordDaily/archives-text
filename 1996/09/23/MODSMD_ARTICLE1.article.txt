## Wells Fargo offers new payment plan 
### Tienlon Ho 
Lines at Old Union may soon
become shorter now that Wells
Fargo and Stanford have imple
mented a free banking service
called Bill-Pay.
Begun earlier this month, Bill-
Pay allows users to transfer funds
from a Wells Fargo account to the
University using an automatic
teller machine, a telephone or the
World Wide Web. Anyone with a
combination Stanford / ATM card
can utilize this service for free to
pay any bills collected by the Bur
sar's Office — phone bills, tuition
bills, Stanford Card Plan pay
ments — without ever signing a
check or buying a stamp.
Bursar Jon Erickson said he
expects the new program to be
popular among students and staff.
According to Erickson, about
10,000 Stanford cards linked to
Wells Fargo have been issued
since the program's initiation last
fall. Information about the new
payment program will be mailed
along with the October phone bill.
Erickson was asked to test out
the new payment program and
found both the ATM and phone
methods to be considerably more
convenient than conventional
check-writing.
"But the online option, that is
slick," he said. "It really is neat — an
easy, efficient way to get everything
done from practically anywhere."
Erickson said he has been using
an online service to pay his electric
and Pacific Bell bills with a click of
his mouse. He added that Bill-Pay
is a major part of the Bursar's Of
fice strategy to combat the hectic
atmosphere which accompanies
the weeks around tuition payment

deadlines.
AmiraYousef, assistant branch
manager of Wells Fargo, men
tioned a second bill payment op
tion called Online Banking, which
handles account balance and
transfer along with direct pay
ment with participating compa
nies off campus — from utilities to
loan payments. Unlike Bill-Pay,
Online Banking carries a $5
monthly surcharge.
The Bursar's Office is examin

ing other technologies designed to
simplify bill-paying for students.
In the next six months, students
will see loans automatically credit
ed to their accounts. In addition,
Erickson said financial aid status
and account balance information
will soon be available through the
Internet.
Anyone interested in joining
the Bill-Pay program can register
by calling Wells Fargo at 1-800-
642-BANK.
