Perot protests exclusion from debates
WASHINGTON (AP) — By excluding him from the presiden
tial debates, Ross Perot said yesterday that Bob Dole has "poi
soned the attitude" of millions of independent voters.
But analysts also said that the absence of the Texas indepen
dent from the two debates would give Dole a chance to make up
his double-digit deficit in the polls by going head-to-head with
President Clinton.
Reform Party nominee Perot said he would file a lawsuit today to
force his way into the debates, now scheduled for Oct. 6 and Oct. 16.
