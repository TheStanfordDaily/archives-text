# Yeltsin surgery likely to be delayed
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Boris Yeltsin is pushing
for his bypass surgery to be performed soon,
but his chief surgeon said yesterday the proce
dure is too risky to rush find perhaps could be
canceled.
Yeltsin had said the surgery would take
place at the end of September. However, Dr.
Rinat Akchurin said it may not be per
formed until mid- to late November,
depending on results of heart tests to be
done this week.
Asked whether the surgery might be can
celed, Akchurin told the Russian NTV net
work's Itogi show: "It's possible, but we
would have to create (lifestyle changes) for the
patient which he himself would not tolerate."
The intrigue surrounding Yeltsin's condi
tion was ratcheted up Saturday by Pavel
Voshchanov, a journalist and former Yeltsin
top aide who told Associated Press Television
that the 65-year-old president has problems
with his back, and with the hearing and blood

vessels in his brain.
Voshchanov, Yeltsin's press secretary from
July 1991 until he resigned in February 1992,
also said the president has liver and kidney
trouble that has been exacerbated by his
drinking, contradicting statements from one
of Yeltsin's physicians.
His disclosures followed Akchurin's sug
gestion that aides covered up a Yeltsin heart
attack in the closing days of the summer pres
idential campaign.
Voshchanov said Yeltsin has "a problem
with blood vessels in the brain, which causes
one to suspect the development of atheroscle
rosis," fatty deposits that clog the arteries and
can lead to a stroke.
"And his spine is ill as well," Voshchanov
said. "He has very strong headaches, and he
has inflammation of the middle ear and can
barely hear out of that ear."
Voshchanov claimed Yeltsin also has prob
lems with his liver and kidneys, "one of which

almost refuses to function." He did not elabo
rate, but related the problems to Yeltsin's
drinking.
Dr. Sergei Mironov, the Kremlin's chief
physician, denied last week that Yeltsin has
major liver or kidney problems, but acknowl
edged other problems he said may complicate
surgery. He did not identify them.
Yeltsin has been hospitalized since Sept. 13
for what aides said then would be a couple of
days of pre-surgery tests.
The Kremlin has said nothing about
Yeltsin's bouts of unusual behavior and hospi
tal stays in recent years. His disappearance
before the second round of presidential voting
July 3 was explained variously as exhaustion
and a cold.
Hut Akchurin told ABC News on Friday
that Yeltsin had a heart attack this summer.
Akchurin said yesterday that it actually was
an attack of stenocardia that did not damage
the heart.
