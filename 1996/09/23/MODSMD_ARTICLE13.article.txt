## The 						Stanford Daily Editor's Welcome 
### 
An Independent Newspaper
Published Since 1892

I was a nervous, naive freshman
when I first walked through
The Daily's doors three years
ago. Like most newcomers to
Stanford, I was trying to adjust to
my new status as a little fish in a
big pond. I felt way out cf my
league — how could I, an average
girl from Portland, Ore., compete
with Olympic athletes and mathe
matical geniuses?
My first impressions of The
Daily were no different. I stood in
awe of all the old editor-type peo
ple. My first day on the job I
learned that the editor in chief,
some short guy named Rajiv, was
going to work at The Washington
Post after graduation. The Wash
ington Post — as in the almost
mythical paper that broke Water
gate and has won more Pulitzers
than many people can count.
Not only did The Daily's staff
amaze me, but so did the actual
paper. For starters, it was pub
lished five days a week. My high
school paper came out once a
month, and that's if we were
lucky. And lots of people, includ
ing parents and alumni from
around the country, read The
Daily. In high school, my mom
sometimes sent a copy of my paper
to my grandma in Tigard (as in
Oregon).
So, what do my ramblings
about freshman year have to do
with The Daily today and my role
as editor in chief?
Hold on, I'm getting to that.
Let's compare Beth-three
years-ago to Beth today. I'm no
longer that nervous freshman
who isn't sure if she has what it
takes to work for The Daily.
And, in many ways, my naivete
about The Daily has also disap
peared. As a bright-eyed fresh
man, I thought The Daily could do
no wrong, and I innocently
assumed that everyone shared my
high regard of the publication.
I've seen differently over the
years. I've seen the stupid errors
that accidentally get into the
paper — the misspelled names,
the inaccurate quotes. I've also
seen the Stanford community's
reaction to The Daily. I've had stu
dents tell me they never read the
paper. "It's just not interesting.
Who cares about the ASSU?" is a

common rephrase. I've had ethnic
center leaders, Greek leaders and
leaders of every imaginable com
munity, complain about unfair
coverage. "You only write stories
when something bad happens,"
they say "Why don't you cover the
good stuff, too?"
And the chorus goes on. Grad
students want more stories about
issues affecting them, professors
criticize an editorial about one of
their colleagues for being too
"harsh" and someone is always
offended by Diversions.
But just when I feel ready to
scream, just when I feel like I'll
punch the next person who dares
to criticize the product I've put
blood, sweat and tears into, I
remember one thing: The Daily is
here to serve the Stanford com
munity and therefore must be
responsive to the needs and inter
ests of that community. And the
only way to fulfill this role is to
engage in a dialogue with those
community members.
So, that's my goal this volume:
to make The Daily an inclusive
and responsive organization. I
want to publish stories about
issues that readers really care
about. I want our staff to reflect
Stanford's diversity — its myriad
of colors and interests and opin
ions.
As the old adage goes, actions
speak louder than words. To
accomplish this goal, I plan to visit
with members of different ethnic
communities and other interested
groups. I plan to hold office hours
every Friday from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m.
I am also available by phone, e
mail and fax. Or else, just corner
me in class, when I actually make
it.
And if all goes as planned, you
will see yourself in The Daily.
