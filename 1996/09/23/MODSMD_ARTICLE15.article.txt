## Nick Thompson Service learning means real education 
### 
AT STANFORD,
I've spat out a
heap of indif
ference curves and
graphs, analyzed wid
gets and wackos and
even read Ayn Rand.
I've also held a fair
number of picket
signs, climbed trees in

protest and spent time crafting strate
gies for trying to dent brutal dictator
ships in small Southeast Asian coun
tries.
I've learned a decent amount from all
of these activities. But I've learned the
most, and Stanford has served me best,
when I've been able to combine the two
and synergisticaUy fuse what re normal
ly considered extracurricular with the
curricular. c *
There's a critical distinction
between gaining knowledge and getting
an education. Anyone can gain knowl
edge anywhere. All you have to do is go
to a lecture, pick up a random textbook
or watch "Jeopardy!" Getting an educa
tion is a much more profound and
holistic type of learning. It means look
ing at the world, your life, your pas
sions and then learning to analyze
what you see. Stanford's administra
tors understand this in their rhetoric
and have created some programs to
that end — like residential education.
But the University hasn't looked close
ly enough at its options and has missed
what is perhaps the perfect opportuni

ty: service-learning.
Service-learning is academic work
done with a professor and University
resources that consists of reflecting,
researching and analyzing work that
you do that is of service to the commu
nity. It doesn't mean sending out e-mail
or burning a Pepsi and getting credit for
graduation from your antics. It means
classes like CE 100 — course work to
help understand and alleviate local
housing shortages. It means research
that I did last year to understand the
legal issues behind the construction of
telescopes on Mount Graham — San
Carlos Apache sacred land and endan
gered species habitat. It means using
Stanford's resources to help research
and analyze issues that aren't static,
that 4r' v e you,and that you want to
understand.
I've been trying to do this since my
freshman year, and this opportunity
exists at Stanford. Unfortunately, it is
hidden in a small tablet buried under
the Haas Center for Public Service,
through no fault of the dedicated people
at Haas. There are almost no resources
dedicated to supporting service-learn
ing programs. If you want to do it you
must figure out the logistics, Find a pro
fessor who is willing to sponsor you for
free and shuffle through interminable
bureaucracy. More likely than not your
grades won't get entered until a
prospective employer demands to know
what the letters L, I and N on your
transcript stand for.

Ideally Stanford would take a num
ber of simple steps to open up service
learning opportunities. The first step
would be to create a public service
minor and provide a space in the Bul
letin for all of the courses that incorpo
rate public service and a space that
describes exactly how interested stu
dents can pursue the options. A second
step would be to reduce teaching
requirements for faculty who sponsor
individuals interested in service-learn
ing. If faculty members take students
under their wings and serve as mentors,
they should be rewarded. Third, Stan
ford should develop a protocol for deal
ing with community organizations to
assure that they benefit from working
with us. A final step would be to help
provide the resources to create a
database of service-learning opportuni
ties.
Stanford is a wonderful school if you
are on the pre-professional track — if
you want to go to grad school or hop
right into the money-making world.
Stanford is a mediocre school if you
want to spend your life working in pub
lic service. We need to change that and
we can. It will take just a minimal
expenditure of resources and Universi
ty-wide dedication to help bring serious
and critical extracurricular activities
that benefit the community into the
curriculum.
