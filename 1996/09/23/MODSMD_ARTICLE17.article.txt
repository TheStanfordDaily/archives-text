## Offense stagnant in road opener Cardinal drive shut down 14-0 against Badgers in Madison 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
MADISON, Wis. — While Madison may be
the most livable city in America, it's not the eas
iest place for offenses to flourish.
The Stanford football squad put together an
impressive defensive performance, but a stingy
Wisconsin defense held the Cardinal (1-2) to just
211 total yards as the Badgers (3-0) posted a 14-
0 shutout to finish their nonconference sched
ule without a loss.
"What has got to happen is that we have got
to have total team play," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "Good defense and
bad offense gives us what we got today, which is
a loss."
The Badgers iced the win in the fourth quar
ter with a 1-yard quarterback sneak by sopho
more Mike Samuel. The score capped off a nine
play, 55-yard drive that took close to 5 minutes
off the clock. Much of the damage was done by
true freshman Ron Dayne who rumbled for 54
yards on eight carries on the drive.
The Stanford offense could not get within
striking distance all game, as the most success
ful Cardinal drive stalled at the Badger 38-yard
line. Led by linebacker Pete Monty's 13 tackles
and rush end Tarek Saleh's three sacks, the
Wisconsin defense gave quarterback Chad
Hutchinson fits all afternoon, holding Hutchin
son to just 18-of-35 passing for 161 yards. The
Badgers also limited the Stanford rushing at
tack to just 50 yards.
"A lot of the pressure they got is due to the
fact that they have a lot of quickness coming off
the edges," said Willingham of the Badger de
fense, which sacked Hutchinson five times.
"But also, some of our problems involve our
youth, our inexperience up front."
The Cardinal did not help its own cause ei
ther, coughing up the ball four times on two
fumbles and two interceptions. Stanford re
ceivers also dropped a total of eight Hutchinson
passes, including a stretch of four consecutive
drops in the second quarter.
"I really think we just killed ourselves out
there," Hutchinson said. "It was frustrating.
We got ourselves in the hole, and we'd have to
make a big play, but our offense is designed to
chip away bit by bit. They did a good job stopping
our run game, and when they knew we had to
pass, they brought the house on the pass rush."
Stanford continued to struggle on third
down. Coming in with a dismal 29 percent con
version rate, the Cardinal converted on three
out of 16 third downs bringing its percentage
down to a frigid 24 percent. Stanford was also 0-

for-2 on fourth down.
"We just didn't make plays," Willingham
said. "We had some opportunities in our run
game and in our pass game. When we [don't]
make plays, that changes the whole complexion
of the offense. Then when we made a play, we'd
give it back to them on a fumble."
On the other side of the ball, the Cardinal de
fense put together its second straight impres
sive performance. The Cardinal came into the
game looking to penetrate the biggest offensive
line in the country and a backfield which fea
tures three talented tailbacks.
After averaging more than 300 rushing yards
in its first two games, Wisconsin could only
muster 101 yards on the ground, much of it com
ing late in the game by Dayne, who found the
holes in a weary Stanford defense. With the of
fense struggling, Stanford was forced to keep its
defense on the field for more than 34 minutes.

'What has got to happen is
that we have got to have total
team play. Good defense and
bad offense gives us what we
got today, which is a loss.'

"Our defense did an outstanding job in this
football game," said Willingham. "Our defense
provided us with opportunities to win the game.
Some of the things which we wanted to accom
plish, like stopping their run game, I think we
accomplished."
"We stopped the run and that's what we
wanted to come in and do," senior free safety
Josh Madsen said. "We forced them to pass. As a
defense, I felt we played sufficient to put some
points on the board. Each of the defensive posi
tions played pretty well."
In the absence of its running game, the Bad
gers had to go to the air attack. Wide receiver
Donald Hayes hauled in seven Samuel passes
for 90 yards, and Tony Simmons caught four
passes for 80 yards as well.
"We felt that their strength was in running
the football," said Willingham. "Samuel is an
unknown quantity right now, and I think he has
proven himself very well. But coming into this
ball game, we felt if we stopped their run game,
it would give us the best opportunity to win the
game."

Samuel finished the game 21-of-30 for a ca
reer-high 236 yards passing. In a second-quar
ter touchdown drive, Samuel completed five
passes in as many attempts, including a 22-yard
touchdown pass to Hayes.
Senior strong safety Eliel Swinton led the de
fensive charge, recording an interception, two
passes broken up, two tackles for losses and 14
tackles overall.
Despite the effort, the defense was still not
looking to blame the offense for its second loss of
the season.
"If the offense isn't clicking, maybe the de
fense could have scored a touchdown," junior
defensive end Kailee Wong said. "We could have
made some more plays."
The Stanford defense also registered two
sacks, one by junior inside linebacker Chris
Draft and one by sophomore free safety Tim
Smith, intercepted three Samuel passes and re
covered a fumble.

striking distance all game, as the most success
ful Cardinal drive stalled at the Badger 38-yard
line. Led by linebacker Pete Monty's 13 tackles
and rush end Tarek Saleh's three sacks, the
Wisconsin defense gave quarterback Chad
Hutchinson fits all afternoon, holding Hutchin
son to just 18-of-35 passing for 161 yards. The
Badgers also limited the Stanford rushing at
tack to just 50 yards.
"A lot of the pressure they got is due to the
fact that they have a lot of quickness coming off
the edges," said Willingham of the Badger de
fense, which sacked Hutchinson five times.
"But also, some of our problems involve our
youth, our inexperience up front."
The Cardinal did not help its own cause ei
ther, coughing up the ball four times on two
fumbles and two interceptions. Stanford re
ceivers also dropped a total of eight Hutchinson
passes, including a stretch of four consecutive
drops in the second quarter.
"I really think we just killed ourselves out
there," Hutchinson said. "It was frustrating.
We got ourselves in the hole, and we'd have to
make a big play, but our offense is designed to
chip away bit by bit. They did a good job stopping
our run game, and when they knew we had to
pass, they brought the house on the pass rush."
Stanford continued to struggle on third
down. Coming in with a dismal 29 percent con
version rate, the Cardinal converted on three
out of 16 third downs bringing its percentage
down to a frigid 24 percent. Stanford was also 0-

for-2 on fourth down.
"We just didn't make plays," Willingham
said. "We had some opportunities in our run
game and in our pass game. When we [don't]
make plays, that changes the whole complexion
of the offense. Then when we made a play, we'd
give it back to them on a fumble."
On the other side of the ball, the Cardinal de
fense put together its second straight impres
sive performance. The Cardinal came into the
game looking to penetrate the biggest offensive
line in the country and a backfield which fea
tures three talented tailbacks.
After averaging more than 300 rushing yards
in its first two games, Wisconsin could only
muster 101 yards on the ground, much of it com
ing late in the game by Dayne, who found the
holes in a weary Stanford defense. With the of
fense struggling, Stanford was forced to keep its
defense on the field for more than 34 minutes.

'What has got to happen is
that we have got to have total
team play. Good defense and
bad offense gives us what we
got today, which is a loss.'
— Tyrone Willingham

"Our defense did an outstanding job in this
football game," said Willingham. "Our defense
provided us with opportunities to win the game.
Some of the things which we wanted to accom
plish, like stopping their run game, I think we
accomplished."
"We stopped the run and that's what we
wanted to come in and do," senior free safety
Josh Madsen said. "We forced them to pass. As a
defense, I felt we played sufficient to put some
points on the board. Each of the defensive posi
tions played pretty well."
In the absence of its running game, the Bad
gers had to go to the air attack. Wide receiver
Donald Hayes hauled in seven Samuel passes
for 90 yards, and Tony Simmons caught four
passes for 80 yards as well.
"We felt that their strength was in running
the football," said Willingham. "Samuel is an
unknown quantity right now, and I think he has
proven himself very well. But coming into this
ball game, we felt if we stopped their run game,
it would give us the best opportunity to win the
game."

Samuel finished the game 21-of-30 for a ca
reer-high 236 yards passing. In a second-quar
ter touchdown drive, Samuel completed five
passes in as many attempts, including a 22-yard
touchdown pass to Hayes.
Senior strong safety Eliel Swinton led the de
fensive charge, recording an interception, two
passes broken up, two tackles for losses and 14
tackles overall.
Despite the effort, the defense was still not
looking to blame the offense for its second loss of
the season.
"If the offense isn't clicking, maybe the de
fense could have scored a touchdown," junior
defensive end Kailee Wong said. "We could have
made some more plays."
The Stanford defense also registered two
sacks, one by junior inside linebacker Chris
Draft and one by sophomore free safety Tim
Smith, intercepted three Samuel passes and re
covered a fumble.
