Stanford water polo took to the pool and snagged a 7-2 victory
from the Pepperdine Waves in the team's home opener at deGuerre
pool last Friday. The fifth-ranked Cardinal (4-2) mounted a slight
lead early in the game to take a 3-1 advantage at the half. Stanford
heated up in the fourth period with four goals to Pepperdine's one
for the 7-2 final.
"We started out kind of slow," said junior Jeremiah Ilobison.
"We expected to come out against them really hard from the very
beginning." .
The Cardinal overcame the adversity of a slow start to claim the
second victory over Pepperdine (2-3) this season in as many tries.
Stanford first downed the Waves 10-6 at the Irvine Tournament on
Sept. 14, before dropping a game and the tournament to Irvine.
This season marks several changes for the Cardinal squad. The
team is substituting more, and several freshmen are getting large
amounts of playing time. The different players adds balance to the
team as was evident in the scoring.
Stanford spread the points evenly in Friday's game as senior
Brian Wallin, senior Daniel Lehoczky and sophomore David Hay
each tossed in two for the Card. Freshman Jonathan Skaalen also
added one more in the effort.
"Both [Skaalen and Joy] have been playing really well, Robison
said. "They're our freshmen, and they are playing really well for us.
We're subbing a lot of people which hasn't been the case in past
years. We really only have two stars, and everyone else is pretty
even."
