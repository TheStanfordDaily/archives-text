### Gilbert Lopez 
Punctuating the decisive victories
they garnered at the Nevada Invitational,
the men's and women's cross country
teams easily beat the competition at the
Aztec Invitational in San Diego on Satur
day.
In the men's 5-mile race, the Cardinal
captured the top four spots, and all run
ners finished in the top 20.
Senior David Dyer followed up his
winning performance at the Nevada In
vitational with another first-place time
of 24 minutes, 58 seconds. Junior Jon
Weldon came in two seconds behind Dyer
with a time of 25 minutes, and senior
Jason Perscheid took third coming in at
25:09.
The team avenged a 12-point loss to
Fresno State in last year's Invitational
with the top five Cardinal finishers com
bining for 17 points. They easily beat out
Cal Poly-Pomona, which garnered second
with 74 points.
Head coach Vin Lananna holds high
expectations for a men's team which has
become vastly more competitive nation
ally since his arrival four year;- ago. I he
team has gone from virtual mediocrity to
a fifth-place finish in the NCAA last
year.
"I am very optimistic [about the future
of the men's teaml," Lananna said "The
fact is we have a good combination of expe
rience and a good combination of youth.
There is a lot of enthusiasm and desire.
These factors should add up to a good
year."
In the women's 5,000-meter race, the
Cardinal team took six of the top 10 spots
en route to 26 points, a comfortable 55
points ahead of second-place Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo.

Junior Kortney Dunscombe improved
upon her third-place finish at the Nevada
Invitational, leading the women with a
time of 17:44 and a first-place triumph.
Freshman Sally Glynn followed in at
17:54 to take third, and junior Sara
Moore came in fifth place with a time of
18:10.
Lananna is highly optimistic about the

All of our returning seniors
have been to three consec
utive NCAA championships.
Our women will be a top
team nationally this year.'
— Vin Lananna

competitiveness of the women's team this
year after their ninth-place finish in NCAA
competition last year.
"I think the [women's] team is full of
talent," Lananna said. "All of our return
ing seniors have been to three consecutive
NCAA championships. That has been not
only an experience, but a positive experi
ence as in they have done well at them. Our
women will be a top team nationally this
year."
The teams have the next weekend off,
and their next meet falls on Oct. 5, when
they will host the Stanford Invitational.
The Cardinal will run in four collegiate
races with more than 1,000 other run
ners, preceded by high school competi
tions of more than 2,500 competitors at
11:10 a.m. The team will be defending all
four of its first-place finishes from last
year's meet.
