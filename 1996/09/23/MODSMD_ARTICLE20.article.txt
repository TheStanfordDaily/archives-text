# Santa Clara sneaks past soccer
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
The No. 16 Stanford women's soccer team, coming
off a 1-0 win over USF on Thursday, dropped a heart
breaker to No. 3 Santa Clara yesterday on Maloney
Field, leading 1-0 at halflime, the Cardinal gave up two
goals in the first 10 minutes of the second half and was
unable to answer the Bronco charge.
The loss was particularly disappointing because
many Stanford players were looking to avenge last sea
son's loss to Santa Clara in the NCAA tournament. In
that game, a quadruple-overtime contest, Santa Clara's
Mikka Hansen ended the Cardinal's season with a sud
den-death goal in the 139 th minute.
"All of us had that game in the back of our heads,"
said junior midfielder Elie Foster "Obviously we wetv
focusing on the game, but this is a very important game
for us."
Indeed, the rivalry has grown more intense every

year The Broncos now hold a 9-5-2 edge over Stanford
and have beaten the Card three times in a row.
At t he outset of the game, Santa Clara appeared to l>e
in control, keeping the ball in Stanford's half of the field
for most of the first 8 minutes, but the Broncos failed to
convert on a number of excellent scoring opportunities
during those initial minutes. On one, sophomore goal
keeper Erin Bryla misplaved a pass in her own goal box
and was fortunate that her intercepted ball clanged off
the left crossbar and was cleared bv senior defender
Suzie Hoots
After surviving the Broncos' initial charge, the Car
dinal appeared to settle down and put together a strong
counterattack The strategy paid off. and with 9 min
utes, 39 seconds elapsed in the first half, senior forward
Emily Hurt beat Santa Clara goalie Christina Sanchez
to give the Cardinal a 1-0 lead.
Burt's goal came off a free kick taken by Natalie Kim
The freshman defender centered
the ball high, and both teams bat
tled for it. Stanford sophomore
Charmaine Le Blanc finally came
up with it and played a slow bounc
ing ball into the middle of the 18-
yard box. With the ball sitting high
in the air, Burt and Sanchez each
charged, but Burt edged out the
Bronco goalie and pushed the ball
into the cage.
"Our defenders looked asleep on
that play," said Santa Clara coach
Jerry Smith. "Everyone but (Burt)
was watching the ball instead of
going after it. That was a great goal,
and it showed that Stanford was
more alert out there."
The game remained 1-0 until
halftime, but in the early stages of
the second half, Santa Clara came
out, according to Smith, "with some
extra fire." The Broncos, who have
only lost once this season, a 1-0 last
minute defeat to No. 1 North Car
olina, knotted the score 5 minutes
into the half.
Bryla made a diving punch in an
attempt to clear a well-placed Santa

Clara corner kick, but the ball went
straight to the waiting foot of Bron
co freshman forward Whitney Hol
lis. Hollis took the ball out of mid-air
and unleashed a hard, well-placed
volley past the outstretched arm of
Bryla.
Shortly after that goal, the Car
dinal attacked again, and Burt,
charging down the left side of the
field, collided with the goalie. Burt
injured her shoulder and was un
able to return for the remainder of
the game. Her exact status is uncer
tain at this point, but her absence in
the game left a gaping hole in the
Cardinal offense.
Less than 3 minutes later, Santa
Clara scored its second goal off an
other corner kick. This time Mandy
Clemens' diving header gave the
Broncos a 2-1 lead.
"Any game has its ebbs and
flows," said Stanford coach Steve
Swanson. "At the beginning of the
second half they came out very
strong. We're going to have to get
better at defending off of re-starts.
You really have to be organized in
those situations, and it cost us."
Bryla also noted the lack of fire in
the second half. "We may not have
come out as strong as we could
have," said Bryla. "Any drop in in

tensity can really hurt you, and that
might have happened. We needed a
much stronger second half to win
that game."
The Cardinal had one good
chance to tie the score at 2-2 when
sophomore Christy Stoflel snuck
past the last line of Bronco defense
and had a one-on-one with the goalie
near the edge of the box. However,
StofFel was being heavily pursued
from behind and was unable to get
the ball past Sanchez.
After the game Swanson, who is
in his first year as Stanford's coach,
sensed the fierceness of the rivalry.
"You can just feel that this isn't just
another game," said Swanson. "It's a
good, special rivalry. I think it is real
ly what college sports is all about. I'm
glad just to have taken part in that
kind of game.
"Now there are two ways we can
take a loss like this one. We can get
down and be disappointed, or we can
use it as springboard to improve. I
know this team is capable of much,
much more. I really believe we're
going to get better and better."
Burt said she expects the team
to take the second approach. "We
were really hoping to win this
game," she said. "The loss will just
motivate us to work harder."
