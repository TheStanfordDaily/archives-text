### Brian Auld Staff writer 
The No. 16 Stanford women's soccer team, coming
off a 1-0 win over USF on Thursday, dropped a heart
breaker to No. 3 Santa Clara yesterday on Maloney
Field, leading 1-0 at halflime, the Cardinal gave up two
goals in the first 10 minutes of the second half and was
unable to answer the Bronco charge.
The loss was particularly disappointing because
many Stanford players were looking to avenge last sea
son's loss to Santa Clara in the NCAA tournament. In
that game, a quadruple-overtime contest, Santa Clara's
Mikka Hansen ended the Cardinal's season with a sud
den-death goal in the 139 th minute.
"All of us had that game in the back of our heads,"
said junior midfielder Elie Foster "Obviously we wetv
focusing on the game, but this is a very important game
for us."
Indeed, the rivalry has grown more intense every

year The Broncos now hold a 9-5-2 edge over Stanford
and have beaten the Card three times in a row.
At t he outset of the game, Santa Clara appeared to l>e
in control, keeping the ball in Stanford's half of the field
for most of the first 8 minutes, but the Broncos failed to
convert on a number of excellent scoring opportunities
during those initial minutes. On one, sophomore goal
keeper Erin Bryla misplaved a pass in her own goal box
and was fortunate that her intercepted ball clanged off
the left crossbar and was cleared bv senior defender
Suzie Hoots
After surviving the Broncos' initial charge, the Car
dinal appeared to settle down and put together a strong
counterattack The strategy paid off. and with 9 min
utes, 39 seconds elapsed in the first half, senior forward
Emily Hurt beat Santa Clara goalie Christina Sanchez
to give the Cardinal a 1-0 lead.
Burt's goal came off a free kick taken by Natalie Kim
