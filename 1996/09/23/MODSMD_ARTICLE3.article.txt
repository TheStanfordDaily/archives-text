# ASSU fees significantly lower
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
Although tuition costs continue to rise, one item
on students' University bills is noticeably lower this
quarter — the ASSU special fee.
This year undergraduates will be charged an aver
age of $29 per quarter; graduates will pay an average
of $21 per quarter. Both groups paid $34 on average
each quarter during the 1995-96 academic year.
ASSU fees, charges assessed by the University on
behalf of the student government, are determined by
a general election each spring. The student body
votes to approve individual funding requests from
student organizations.
The 1995 Common Sense Fee Reform allows
groups to specify from which population — under
graduate, graduate or both — they wish to seek fund
ing based upon which population they serve. Groups
specify the amount of the request subject to approval

by the ASSU.
The total amount approved is divided among that
population. This is the first time in years that the fee
has shown such a significant drop between quarters.
According to ASSU Financial Manager John Hall,
fees are significantly lower because "several of the
larger fees that had passed in previous years failed to
receive the same number of votes this year. The
largest of these was KZSU."
KZSU, Stanford's radio station, was denied its
special fee for the first time in its history.
"In [fiscal year] '96, the KZSU fee was $116,180,
or $9.08 per person. KZSU received 9 percent of the
fees distributed in 1995-96. This will not be collected
in 1996-97," Hall said.
KZSU was one of 11 groups to lose their bids for
special-fee funding. Students rejected requests that
would had increased their annual assessments by
s26.7B per person.
All 11 groups that lost funding
applied to both populations.
Another action affecting fee
rates this year was The Daily's de
cision not to apply for its special
fee, which reduced charges by a
few dollars per person.
According to the ASSU Consti
tution, to win funding a group's
request must meet two voting re
quirements: It must receive a ma

jority of the votes cast, and that
majority must total 15 percent of
those eligible to vote.
Only two of the 11 groups failed
to win a majority; the others suf
fered from a low graduate turnout
— 13.2 percent.
Based on the votes cast, 10 of
the 11 groups denied funding
would have received money if
they had solicited funding from
only the undergraduate popula
tion.
"Common Sense lowered vot
ing requirements for groups that
requested fees from undergradu
ates only and may have made it

easier for those groups to pass,
given that undergraduates tend to
vote in favor of fees more often,"
Hall said. No group requesting
funds from undergraduates only
was denied funding.
Last spring's results may lead
groups in search of money to the
more amiable undergraduate vot
ers.
That may mean significantly
higher fees for some students as
the funding burden, formerly dis
tributed equally among the stu
dent population, shifts wholly
onto the shoulders of Stanford's
6,500 undergraduates.
