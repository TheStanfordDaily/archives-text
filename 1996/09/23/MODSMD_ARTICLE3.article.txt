Although tuition costs continue to rise, one item
on students' University bills is noticeably lower this
quarter — the ASSU special fee.
This year undergraduates will be charged an aver
age of $29 per quarter; graduates will pay an average
of $21 per quarter. Both groups paid $34 on average
each quarter during the 1995-96 academic year.
ASSU fees, charges assessed by the University on
behalf of the student government, are determined by
a general election each spring. The student body
votes to approve individual funding requests from
student organizations.
The 1995 Common Sense Fee Reform allows
groups to specify from which population — under
graduate, graduate or both — they wish to seek fund

specify the amount of the request subject to approval

by the ASSU.
The total amount approved is divided among that
population. This is the first time in years that the fee
has shown such a significant drop between quarters.
According to ASSU Financial Manager John Hall,
fees are significantly lower because "several of the
larger fees that had passed in previous years failed to
receive the same number of votes this year. The
largest of these was KZSU."
KZSU, Stanford's radio station, was denied its
special fee for the first time in its history.
"In [fiscal year] '96, the KZSU fee was $116,180,
or $9.08 per person. KZSU received 9 percent of the
fees distributed in 1995-96. This will not be collected
in 1996-97," Hall said.
KZSU was one of 11 groups to lose their bids for
special-fee funding. Students rejected requests that
would had increased their annual assessments by
