# New faces on the Farm
## Staff join Comm Dept., Hillel and News Service 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
First-year students won't be the
only new faces upperclassmen and
faculty will see on campus this fall.
Among the prominent recent ar
rivals to the Farm are William F.
Woo, former editor of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, who will be teaching
classes in the Communication De
partment; Deborah Sloss-Kelman,
the new interim executive director
of Hillel; and Alan Acosta, who was
appointed director of Stanford
News Service earlier this month.
William Woo
Woo, who is at Stanford for the
1996-97 academic year under the
Lorry I. Lokey Visiting Professor
ship, said he was thrilled at the op
portunity to teach students about
journalism, especially as the media
industry goes through dramatic
changes.
"I've been involved with some of
the most spectacular events in jour
nalism," said Woo reflecting on a
34-year career at the St. Ixmis Post-
Dispatch. "I very much welcome
the opportunity to give back to the
students."
Woo will begin his professorship

with a seminar on news media man
agement this quarter, followed by a
news reporting class winter quarter
and a course on public opinion in
the spring.
Woo said there are new issues to
deal with in the newsroom. In addi
tion to the lessons on how to run a
newsroom, topics from ethnic di
versity to sexual harassment will be
brought up in class, introducing
students to problems an editor or
manager may encounter while run
ning a news organization.
"I want to develop a course in
newsroom management in this new
environment," said Woo. "Newspa
pers face an enormously difficult
time. Circulation, public trust and
esteem in the media is going down..
.. How we handle these issues is
just as important as learning how to
run a newsroom."
Deborah Sloss-Kelman
Another new arrival to campus
is Deborah Sloss-Kelman, who will
fill the Stanford Hillel's executive
director post, held for the last 21
years by Rabbi Ari Cartun.
As interim executive director,
Sloss-Kelman will be responsible
for overseeing Stanford's Jewish
community organization, one of the
largest student groups on campus.
Sloss-Kelman, who graduated
from Stanford in 1978 with a de
gree in human biology, said she is

excited and ex
hausted by the op
portunity.
"I started in
the position of ex
ecutive director
just before the
Jewish high holi
days of Rosh
Hashanah and
Yom Kippur," said
Sloss-Kelman, ex-

plaining her busy schedule.
Even though her position is tem
porary and she had little time to set
tle in, Sloss-Kelman said she was
confident of making a positive im
pact at Stanford Hillel.
Sloss-Kelman praised students'
efforts, saying "the students make
my job worthwhile."
"We have a small office, only

about four full
time staff mem
bers," she said.
"The only way we
can do what we do
is because of the
students. Our
events are orga
nized and run by
the students, and
we help to make
them happen."

Prior to arriving at Stanford,
Sloss-Kelman was a planning and
allocations associate for the Jewish
Community Federation in San
Francisco. Her family's involve
ment with Stanford extends to the
University's founding: Her great
grandfather, Leon Sloss, was
among the first Stanford trustees.
Alan Acosta
Alan Acosta may not be fresh to
the Farm, but since arriving at
Stanford in March, he has risen
quickly from editor of Stanford
Today magazine to director of Stan
ford News Service.
"I was very pleased to have been
appointed director of News Ser
vice," Acosta said. "Certainly, I am
qualified to do the job ... [and] I

think the confidence is well put.
The duties of running News Service
are much like those of running
Stanford Today, only now I have a
broader range of responsibilities."
Acosta fills the post vacated by
Douglas Foster, who left to become
the director of planning and admin
istration for UC-Berkeley's School
of Journalism after two years head
ing News Service.
Acosta spent seven years as a

deputy city editor
at the Los Angeles
Times prior to
joining News Ser
vice.
He received a
bachelor's from
UC-Santa Cruz
and a master's
from the Colum
bia University
School of Journal
ism.

In addition to continuing the
"terrific job" of his predecessor,
Acosta said he hopes to set new
goals and improvements for News
Service.
"We are looking at priorities and
initiatives," said Acosta. "We are
still in the assessment phase."
