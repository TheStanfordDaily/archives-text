# New faces on the Farm
## Staff join Comm Dept., Hillel and News Service 
### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
First-year students won't be the
only new faces upperclassmen and
faculty will see on campus this fall.
Among the prominent recent ar
rivals to the Farm are William F.
Woo, former editor of the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, who will be teaching
classes in the Communication De
partment; Deborah Sloss-Kelman,
the new interim executive director
of Hillel; and Alan Acosta, who was
appointed director of Stanford
News Service earlier this month.
William Woo
Woo, who is at Stanford for the
1996-97 academic year under the
Lorry I. Lokey Visiting Professor
ship, said he was thrilled at the op
portunity to teach students about
journalism, especially as the media
industry goes through dramatic
changes.
"I've been involved with some of
the most spectacular events in jour
nalism," said Woo reflecting on a
34-year career at the St. Ixmis Post-
Dispatch. "I very much welcome
the opportunity to give back to the
students."
Woo will begin his professorship

with a seminar on news media man
agement this quarter, followed by a
news reporting class winter quarter
and a course on public opinion in
the spring.
Woo said there are new issues to
deal with in the newsroom. In addi
tion to the lessons on how to run a
newsroom, topics from ethnic di
versity to sexual harassment will be
brought up in class, introducing
students to problems an editor or
manager may encounter while run
ning a news organization.
"I want to develop a course in
newsroom management in this new
environment," said Woo. "Newspa
pers face an enormously difficult
time. Circulation, public trust and
esteem in the media is going down..
.. How we handle these issues is
just as important as learning how to
run a newsroom."
Deborah Sloss-Kelman
Another new arrival to campus
is Deborah Sloss-Kelman, who will
fill the Stanford Hillel's executive
director post, held for the last 21
years by Rabbi Ari Cartun.
As interim executive director,
Sloss-Kelman will be responsible
