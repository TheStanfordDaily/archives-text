## Affected students must pick up new bill

FINANCIAL AID GLITCH

Numerous setbacks and a new computer system at
the Financial Aids Office have delayed the processing of
financial aid packages for upperclassmen and graduate
students this quarter.
When the Bursar's Office printed the fall quarter
bills on Aug. 24, many award notices had not yet been
calculated. Since no scholarships, grants, or any other
credits had been put into the computer system by the
Financial Aids Office, these bills only showed basic
charges.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aids James Montoya said the problems are part of the
transition period into a new system, which should run
more smoothly next quarter. Eventually, the financial
aid award process should see improved efficiency.
The problem
At the time the bills were sent out to the students,
both the Financial Aids Office and the Bursar's Office
were fully aware that many of them were incomplete.
According to Director of Student Awards Cynthia
Rife, she and Bursar Jon Erickson had discussed delay
ing the bills and the possibility of including an insert ex
plaining the situation. In the end, the bills were sent out
as printed due to the additional work that an insert
would create for the Bursar's Office.
According to Rife, the Financial Aids Office has

• What happened: Because of staffing and com
puter changes at the Financial Aids Crffice, many
students have received bills that do not show what
aid they have been awarded
• What to do: Correct bills will be available at the
"No bill" table in Tresidder Union tomorrow from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m.
• Questions: Students should call the Financial
Aids Office at 723-3058

processed an additional 300 student aid packages since
the incorrect bills were sent out in late August. The Fi
nancial Aids Office has credited the accounts appropri
ately, and students can pick up the correct bills in the
"No bill" line tomorrow in Tresidder Union, said Rife.
Some of the 300 award notices have been mailed out
to students at their permanent addresses However, as
of last week, the Financial Aids Office has temporarily
stopped mailing packages to students' homes because
everyone is returning to campus. Students with no
award notice should go to the Financial Aids Office to
pick it up.
Because loan eligibility is also determined by the fi
nancial aid package, a number of students were unable
to apply for loans because they did
not know what kind or how much
money they qualified to borrow.
These students can defer the por
tion of the bill that the loan or loans
will cover.
The Bursar's Office expects that
there may be some late payments
due to the Financial Aids Office
delay.
"If [the students] applied in a
timely manner to the Financial Aids
Office, we will not penalize them. If
the student applied late, we're not
going to be so sympathetic," said Er
ickson. "But this is not going to be a
black-and-white issue. We're going
to have to work on these on a case
bv-case basis."
Most of the packages belonging to
students who submitted all of their
application documents on time have

been processed, said Rife. As of last
week, 84 percent of all completed ap
plications had been processed. Many
of the incomplete applications in
volve documents that were submit
ted late by the applicant.
The cause
In the past few months, the Fi
nancial Aids Office has experienced
many changes which have hindered
its processing efficiency.
"During the last calendar year,
we started implementing a new
[computer] system that requires us
to do things very differently than in
the past," said Rife. "The new sys
tem is much more complicated. It
requires much more support from
the office.
"But it is much more flexible and
potentially offers us a lot of possibil
ities to make the [financial aid]
process easier for students," she
added.
The new system will automate fi
nancial aid packaging and feature a

tracking system that can tell stu
dents whether they are missing any
documents in their files. The Finan
cial Aids Office was unable to use
the tracking system this quarter be
cause they could not start it up on
time, according to Rife.
This summer's renovation to the
office added to the delay. The office
had to move on three separate occa
sions and shut down for two days.
However, the new layout ensures
more privacy for students coming
in, said Montoya.
"Ultimately, the changes that we
have made have really been focused
on better serving the students," said
Montoya
A turnover in staff during the
summer months also contributed to
the backup and demanded that the
office take time to train new em
ployees.
"Financial aid really requires a
great deal of training. The process is
complicated, as most applicants
know," said Rife. "As is true with

any organization, it's always a stres
sor to take time out to train new peo
ple."
To add to the frustration of the
training, a staff member was called
out to jury duty a couple of weeks
ago, Rife said.
"I just can't imagine that in any
given year, we're going to face the
same number of significant
changes," said Montoya.
Numerous complaints have also
been made about the Financial Aids
Office's newly installed voice-mail
system, according to Erickson.
Even after callers have navigated
the entire phone tree, the system
will disconnect them if no one in the
office is available to answer the call.
As a result, many frustrated par
ents have called the Bursar's Office
instead. "We liave taken a good num
ber of calls from parents who have
been irate and screaming at my staff
wanting information," said Erickson.
"They have a very good reason to
complain," said Montoya. "We're

still working out the bugs."
The solution
While Montoya admitted that
the Financial Aids Office "underes
timated the complexity and chal
lenge" of implementing a new com
puter system, he remained opti
mistic. He emphasized that this
backup was an aberration.
"There is no one I know, includ
ing those who are experts in intro
ducing new [computer] systems,
that would have anticipated the
challenges that we faced," he said.
"Of course, my hope is that the in
vestment that we've made will put
us well ahead of the other colleges
and universities in being better able
to serve our students. But the real
test will be what were able to do this
coming year.
"Ultimately, the bottom line is,
we regret that we were not able to
serve students in the way in which
we feel they should be served," said
Montoya.
