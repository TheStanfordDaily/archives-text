# 'In order to make the right choices, you have to search widely...'
## President advises freshmen about importance of choices

University President Gerhard
Casper braved the blazing sun to
urge students to make the most of
their opportunities at Stanford as
part of the 106 th Opening Convo
cation Friday.
"Stanford's history stretches
back more than 100 previous en
tering classes and more than 100
years," Casper said. "By compari
son with other universities, 100
years does not seems long. Some
European universities date al
most to the beginning of the mil
lennium while Stanford was
founded towards its end. I submit
that what we lack in antiquity, we
more than make up for in the in
tensity of commitment and tradi
tion."
Stanford's president focused
his remarks on making choices.

The Class of
2000, Casper
pointed out, had
already made im
portant choices
that placed them
in college and at
Stanford —
choices that du
plicated those
made by stu-

dents in each preceding class.
Once at Stanford, however, those
paths diverge.
"There are so many things to
consider about the subject of
making choices at a university
that I cannot even scratch the
surface," the president said. "The
main conundrum you face is this:
In order to make the right choic
es, you have to search widely,
while keeping in mind that
measured by the quality and in
tensity of your experiences and

the sense of balance in your lives
— less may be more."
He told the Class of 2000 that
it is impossible to explore all of
the opportunities provided at
Stanford. A student's mission is
to make use of all opportunities
he or she can.
This tradition of opportunity,
according to Casper, is the result
of the generosity of many.
Stanford "has greatly benefit
ed from deliberate commitment,
handed down from one genera
tion of faculty, one generation of
students and one generation of
alumni to the next," Casper said.
"One day,"he continued,
"Stanford will therefore call on
you, too, to make another choice,
to display the same sense of moral
obligation that others have on
vour behalf in order to enable the


Casper
University to do the work of edu
cation and research for future
generations."
After Casper spoke, Mary Ed
monds, vice provost and dean for
student affairs, extended her
more personal thoughts.
She recalled sending her own
daughter to college and assured
parents that Stanford has systems
in place to protect their children's
physical and mental health.
To students, she was stern, re
minding them that they were re
sponsible for their own actions
and were expected to abide by the
University's regulations.
She told freshmen to keep in
close contact with their parents,
reminding them of the sacrifices
their parents had made while
raising them.
