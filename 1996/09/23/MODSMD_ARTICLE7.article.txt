## High school senior dreams of Stanford 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
Editor's note: The
following article is the
first in an occasional
series following the
college application
process of an "average "
hi eh school senior liv-

ing in Silver Spring, Md. Katie Nelson, 17, will
apply to Stanford this fall and hopes to become
a member of the Class of2ool.

Like many students on campus at this time
of year, Katie Nelson is spending a lot of time
thinking about Stanford and the various ways
the school might affect her life. Unlike the stu
dents here, however, Nelson is not enrolled in
the University and, in fact, has not even ap
plied.
A senior at Richard Montgomery High
School in Rockville, Md., Nelson only recently
decided that Stanford is her first choice. She
will spend the months between now and April,
when regular admissions decisions are mailed,
studying for SATs, taking a full course load,
gathering teacher recommendations, debat
ing with her parents, comparing notes with

her friends, sending off applica
tions and, of course, agonizing.
Despite the stress of the applica
tion process, Nelson is excited
about her future. "There are so
many opportunities to choose," she
said. She is especially excited about
the prospect of escaping high
school, the last two years of which
have been shaped by her participa
tion in International Baccalaure
ate, an honors program which Nel
son perceives to place greater em
phasis on getting good grades and
high standardized test scores than
on learning.
Montgomery High School,
which is public, has approximately
1,600 students, Nelson said, and
100 from the junior class are invited
to spend their junior and senior
years taking special, more challeng
ing IB classes. Outside of 18, the
percent of students who go on to
college is unclear, Nelson said. In
side 18, it is 99 percent.
"Seven out of 100 went to Stan
ford last year," Nelson said. "Acou

pie went to Swarthmore, a couple to
Duke, a lot to Cornell. A lot of peo
ple go to the University of Maryland
for a free ride."
In addition to setting students
on a direct path to college, IB offers
several other advantages, said Nel
son. "We get the good teachers; we
get the special books. A lot of IB
classes are not open to regular hon
ors kids." This sense of exclusion
contributes to the resentment
many students feel for their IB
peers, said Nelson.
Perhaps in part because of the
separation from other students,
IB students can experience a sense
of personal satisfaction and a
sense of community. "We make
fun of ourselves," Nelson said.
"We're such nerds. We kind of
take pride in it."
Yet IB also has several disadvan
tages, most notable among them
being pressure which manifests it
self in widespread cheating.
"Everyone in IB is super-moti
vated; everyone wants straight As.
Not a test goes by that half the class
doesn't cheat," said Nelson.
"I'm fluent in French, and
there's a cheating ring around me
in French class. [A student! gets the

answer from someone who gets it
from someone who gets it from
someone who gets it from me. I'm
not super-anal, but it really gets to
me.... History is another free-for
all where everyone cheats."
Nelson said she does not think
students are to blame for the preva
lence of cheating in the IB program.
"It's the teacher's fault and the
school's fault for giving the stu
dents tests that are too hard. I know
they're trying, and it's way above
their ability level."
Much of Nelson's interest in
Stanford stems from a wish to
leave behind this academic intensi
ty without sacrificing academic ex
cellence. "I don't want to go to New
England because I think it would
be a continuation of 18. Stanford is
comparable to the Ivies. It's up
there in caliber, but it's a little
more laid-back. When my friend
Sarah visited Stanford, she said
there were a lot of people walking
around in flowered skirts and
Birkenstocks."
Even before Nelson had visited
the campus for herself, this image
became symbolic of the sort of easy
going environment she is seeking,
and when she visited the Farm in

August, she was not disappointed.
"I thought it was absolutely beauti
ful. I kind of fell in love with it," Nel
son said. "Everyone I talked to was
so intelligent and so interesting."
The other schools Nelson is con
sidering are Northwestern Univer
sity in Evanston, 111., Macalester
College in St. Paul, Minn., and
Davidson College in Davidson, N.C.
She has selected these schools by
visiting them with her parents.
"I've been there and said, 'This
feels good,' or 'No, this doesn't feel
OK.' " Among the schools which
didn't feel OX were Oberlin in
Oberlin, Ohio, because she had "a
horrible tour guide" and Grinnell
College in Grinnell, lowa, because
"you have to drive for an hour to get
to McDonald's." Nelson is not a Mc-
Donald's fanatic, she explained, but
she felt the distance was represen
tative of Grinnell's general isola
tion.
Now that Nelson has decided
which schools she finds appealing,
what remains to be seen is which
places will reciprocate her interest.
While the numbers are against her
— last year, Stanford accepted only
19 percent of its freshman appli
cants — Nelson has a strong record.

Her GPA is 3.97, meaning that
she has received all As, except for
one Bin English junior year. The
first time she took the SATs, her
combined score was 1.350, with 680
in the verbal section and 670 in the
math section.
Of course, as every high school
valedictorian rejected from Har
vard knows, grades and test scores
are only some of the factors which
determine whether a given appli
cant is accepted or denied admis
sion, and Nelson's extracurricular
activities also will be relevant as she
applies to schools.
Currently, she plays varsity
lacrosse and is a member or the var
sity swim team. She is a lifeguard
and swimming instructor at the
local YMCA, working 40 hours per
week during the summer and 20
hours per week during the school
year.
Additionally, she is a member of
the National Honor Society, a
member of the student government
and a member of Odyssey of the
Mind, an organization which spon
sors intellectual competitions at
school, county, state and world lev
els. According to Nelson, a recent
competition involved "building

some structure out of balsa wood
that you can roll billiard balls at and
it won't break."
Nelson said she does most of
these activities because she enjoys
them rather than because she feels
a need to enhance her high school
transcript. Being a lifeguard is her
favorite activity because "I love
everyone else on the staff, and I re
ally like teaching," she said.
The National Honor Society, on
the other hand, "is possibly for col
leges, but I think that's the purpose
of it, so you can put it on an applica
tion. A lot of people do, like, 30 ac
tivities and never go to anything."
Now in the third week of her se
nior year, Nelson is concentrating
on actually participating in the ac
tivities she has committed to, main
taining her grade-point average and
retaining a balanced perspective
about next year. "I'm hesitant to
make anything my first choice," she
said. "I'm hesitant to make Stan
ford my dream and set myself up for
a downfall. (Butl if I get in, most
likely I'm going to go."

Next time: Financial aid, Nelson's
parents and college counseling at
Montgomery High School.

Now in the third week of her se

about next year. "I'm hesitant to

likely I'm going to go."

Editor's note: The
following article is the
first in an occasional
series following the
college application
process of an "average "
hi eh school senior liv-

ing in Silver Spring, Md. Katie Nelson, 17, will
apply to Stanford this fall and hopes to become
a member of the Class of2ool.

Like many students on campus at this time
of year, Katie Nelson is spending a lot of time
thinking about Stanford and the various ways
the school might affect her life. Unlike the stu
dents here, however, Nelson is not enrolled in
the University and, in fact, has not even ap
plied.
A senior at Richard Montgomery High
School in Rockville, Md., Nelson only recently
decided that Stanford is her first choice. She
will spend the months between now and April,
when regular admissions decisions are mailed,
studying for SATs, taking a full course load,
gathering teacher recommendations, debat
ing with her parents, comparing notes with

her friends, sending off applica
tions and, of course, agonizing.
Despite the stress of the applica
tion process, Nelson is excited
about her future. "There are so
many opportunities to choose," she
said. She is especially excited about
the prospect of escaping high
school, the last two years of which
have been shaped by her participa
tion in International Baccalaure
ate, an honors program which Nel
son perceives to place greater em
phasis on getting good grades and
high standardized test scores than
on learning.
Montgomery High School,
which is public, has approximately
1,600 students, Nelson said, and
100 from the junior class are invited
to spend their junior and senior
years taking special, more challeng
ing IB classes. Outside of 18, the
percent of students who go on to
college is unclear, Nelson said. In
side 18, it is 99 percent.
"Seven out of 100 went to Stan
ford last year," Nelson said. "Acou

pie went to Swarthmore, a couple to
Duke, a lot to Cornell. A lot of peo
ple go to the University of Maryland
for a free ride."
In addition to setting students
on a direct path to college, IB offers
several other advantages, said Nel
son. "We get the good teachers; we
get the special books. A lot of IB
classes are not open to regular hon
ors kids." This sense of exclusion
contributes to the resentment
many students feel for their IB
peers, said Nelson.
Perhaps in part because of the
separation from other students,
IB students can experience a sense
of personal satisfaction and a
sense of community. "We make
fun of ourselves," Nelson said.
"We're such nerds. We kind of
take pride in it."
Yet IB also has several disadvan
tages, most notable among them
being pressure which manifests it
self in widespread cheating.
"Everyone in IB is super-moti
vated; everyone wants straight As.
Not a test goes by that half the class
doesn't cheat," said Nelson.
"I'm fluent in French, and
there's a cheating ring around me
in French class. [A student! gets the

answer from someone who gets it
from someone who gets it from
someone who gets it from me. I'm
not super-anal, but it really gets to
me.... History is another free-for
all where everyone cheats."
Nelson said she does not think
students are to blame for the preva
lence of cheating in the IB program.
"It's the teacher's fault and the
school's fault for giving the stu
dents tests that are too hard. I know
they're trying, and it's way above
their ability level."
Much of Nelson's interest in
Stanford stems from a wish to
leave behind this academic intensi
ty without sacrificing academic ex
cellence. "I don't want to go to New
England because I think it would
be a continuation of 18. Stanford is
comparable to the Ivies. It's up
there in caliber, but it's a little
more laid-back. When my friend
Sarah visited Stanford, she said
there were a lot of people walking
around in flowered skirts and
Birkenstocks."
Even before Nelson had visited
the campus for herself, this image
became symbolic of the sort of easy
going environment she is seeking,
and when she visited the Farm in

August, she was not disappointed.
"I thought it was absolutely beauti
ful. I kind of fell in love with it," Nel
son said. "Everyone I talked to was
so intelligent and so interesting."
The other schools Nelson is con
sidering are Northwestern Univer
sity in Evanston, 111., Macalester
College in St. Paul, Minn., and
Davidson College in Davidson, N.C.
She has selected these schools by
visiting them with her parents.
"I've been there and said, 'This
feels good,' or 'No, this doesn't feel
OK.' " Among the schools which
didn't feel OX were Oberlin in
Oberlin, Ohio, because she had "a
horrible tour guide" and Grinnell
College in Grinnell, lowa, because
"you have to drive for an hour to get
to McDonald's." Nelson is not a Mc-
Donald's fanatic, she explained, but
she felt the distance was represen
tative of Grinnell's general isola
tion.
Now that Nelson has decided
which schools she finds appealing,
what remains to be seen is which
places will reciprocate her interest.
While the numbers are against her
— last year, Stanford accepted only
19 percent of its freshman appli
cants — Nelson has a strong record.

Her GPA is 3.97, meaning that
she has received all As, except for
one Bin English junior year. The
first time she took the SATs, her
combined score was 1.350, with 680
in the verbal section and 670 in the
math section.
Of course, as every high school
valedictorian rejected from Har
vard knows, grades and test scores
are only some of the factors which
determine whether a given appli
cant is accepted or denied admis
sion, and Nelson's extracurricular
activities also will be relevant as she
applies to schools.
Currently, she plays varsity
lacrosse and is a member or the var
sity swim team. She is a lifeguard
and swimming instructor at the
local YMCA, working 40 hours per
week during the summer and 20
hours per week during the school
year.
Additionally, she is a member of
the National Honor Society, a
member of the student government
and a member of Odyssey of the
Mind, an organization which spon
sors intellectual competitions at
school, county, state and world lev
els. According to Nelson, a recent
competition involved "building

some structure out of balsa wood
that you can roll billiard balls at and
it won't break."
Nelson said she does most of
these activities because she enjoys
them rather than because she feels
a need to enhance her high school
transcript. Being a lifeguard is her
favorite activity because "I love
everyone else on the staff, and I re
ally like teaching," she said.
The National Honor Society, on
the other hand, "is possibly for col
leges, but I think that's the purpose
of it, so you can put it on an applica
tion. A lot of people do, like, 30 ac
tivities and never go to anything."
Now in the third week of her se
nior year, Nelson is concentrating
on actually participating in the ac
tivities she has committed to, main
taining her grade-point average and
retaining a balanced perspective
about next year. "I'm hesitant to
make anything my first choice," she
said. "I'm hesitant to make Stan
ford my dream and set myself up for
a downfall. (Butl if I get in, most
likely I'm going to go."

parents and college counseling at
