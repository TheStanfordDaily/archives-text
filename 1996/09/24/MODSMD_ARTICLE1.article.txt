# Another delay?
## Unions join fight against merger 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
The proposed merger between
Stanford Health Services and the
UC-San Francisco Medical Center
may have hit a snag as a result of a
labor board decision upholding
union complaints.
The California Public Employee
Relations Board has filed a com
plaint against the UC Board of Re
gents charging that the board failed
to give the four unions that repre
sent UCSF employees adequate in
formation for bargaining purposes.
According to Libby Sayre, presi
dent of the University Professional
and Technical Employees union, the
decision may represent a severe set
back to the process.
But UC sources minimized the
importance of the action.
"It's not uncommon for the
board to issue a complaint," said
Terry Lightfoot, a spokesperson at
the UC President's Office. He noted
that the complaint still has to go
through several steps before it ac
quires the force of law.
These steps include a decision
from an administrative law judge,

which Lightfoot said the University
of California could appeal to Superi
or Court if the complaint is upheld.
He noted that the final decision
to merge has not been made, but
that if and when it is, "that's a deci
sion that's made by the board of
trustees, and it's not subject to ap
proval by any union." Therefore the
unions were not entitled to the in
formation and bargaining rights
they claimed, he added.
Both Lightfoot and Judy Frabot
ta, a spokeswoman for SHS, said
their respective sides had given the
public and the unions adequate in
formation.
Lightfoot said UC is proceeding
as planned with the merger while
the complaint is pending. At the mo
ment, he said, the matter is being re
viewed by a third-party agency,
which will report to the trustees on
Oct. 17.
"I believe it's [UC President
Richard Atkinson's] hope that the
merger will Ik? finalized by the end of
the year," Lightfoot said.
However, if UC and Stanford do
proceed as planned, Sayre said, the
final decision from the judge — if in
favor of the union — could require
the universities to undo any progress
they may make in the interim.
"All in all, [UCSF and SHS] are in
not-too-good shape," Sayre said.
Frabotta declined to comment on

the labor board decision but said
that, overall, Stanford remains "op
timistic" about the merger
prospects.
The merger has been presented
as a way to increase the competitive
ness and efficiency of the area's two
largest academic medical facilities.
Both sides have stressed the finan
cial benefits of consolidation, as well
as the increased cooperation in clini
cal matters.
Union opposition, Sayre said, is
based both on concern for the wel
fare of hospital employees and a de
sire for the UCSF Medical Center to
remain a public institution.
Regarding the employees, Light
foot said UC hopes to be able to offer
95 percent of affected employees po
sitions with the combined entity,
with pay and benefits at "market
level." He declined to say what that
meant in relation to their current
status.
Sayre dismissed this as a "com
pletely hollow assurance." She
noted that since there has been no
bargaining or agreement with the
union on the matter, there is no
guarantee of how long the rehired
employees will retain their jobs or
what kind of pay and benefits they
will receive.

She Haiti "unless we can have
some negotiation and an enforceable
agreement," the union will regard
any assurances from UC as mean
ingless.
Such negotiations would also
have to include a discussion of the
status of the combined entity as a
public or private institution, Sayre
said. The plan approved by the UC
Regents in July would create a pri
vate corporation, temporarily called
NEWCO, with a 17-member board
including six regents and three
Stanford trustees
Stanford President Gerhard
Casper made it clear in June that
Stanford would only go through
with the merger if the combined
medical center were entirely private,
and that what he called a "quasi
state entity" was unacceptable.
The involved unions have made it
equally clear that a completely pri
vate NEWCO is unacceptable to
them.
"Our real first commitment is to
keep [UCSF Medical Center] pub
lic," Sayre said. The concern is that a
private medical center would be un
accountable to the public and might
put issues of financial health over
service.
Sayre called efforts at privatizing

the medical center a doomed at
tempt to "make the marketplace
provide what the marketplace would
not logically provide, which in low
cost, high-quality health care."
Sayre said her union's plans also
include suing in Superior Court to
have financial information on UCSF
and SHS disclosed; a decision is ex
pected on Thursday, Sayre said.
The unions are not alone in their
concern about whether the merger
will amount to a privatization. Lt.
Gov. Gray Davis is a member of the
UC Board of Regents, and he has
several times raised concerns about
how the public interest will fare if
the merger goes ahead.
Stevan Allen, a spokesman in
Davis' office, said that while Davis
"has not ruled [the merger] out as a
potentially positive transaction," he
was concerned as an elected public
official that "the taxpayers are pro
tected."
Allen said Davis proposed an
amendment to the merger in July
that would have guaranteed the
University of California a 50 percent
stake in NEWCO. The measure was
defeated and the University of Cali
fornia's maximum stake under the
current proposal would be 30 per
cent.
