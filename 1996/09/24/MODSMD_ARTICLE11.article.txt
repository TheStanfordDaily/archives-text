Fed may raise rates
WASHINGTON (AP) - On the eve of a piv
otal meeting of the Federal Reserve, many
economists believe the central bank will launch a
pre-emptive strike against inflation by raising
interest rates today for the first time in nearly
two years.
The central bank is split between one camp
that has argued for no change in policy this close
to the November elections and another group
worried that sizzling economic growth and unem
ployment at a seven-year low demands a tighten
ing of credit conditions to ward off higher infla
tion.
Some inflation hawks have been urging a dra
matic half-point hike in Fed interest rates.
Some economists said the central bank may
decide on today to split the difference between
those wanting no change and those arguing for a
half-point rate hike.
An increase in the funds rate would trigger an

immediate hike in commercial banks' prime lend
ing rate.
Tiger has tour by the tail
ENDICOTT, N Y. (AP) — Tiger Woods' aver
age paycheck •.! his first four pro tournaments
ranks 17th on the PGA Tour.
No one has ever entered the game with as
much acclaim and under as much pressure as
Woods. Quite simply, the 20-year-old was expect
ed to be the best ever.
To respond to that pressure by making all four
cuts and by finishing 11th, fifth and third the last
three weeks is remarkable.
The $58,000 third-place check from last week's
B.C. Open gave Woods $140,000 and moved him
into 128 th place on the money list.
By moving into the top 150 he is eligible for as
many sponsor exemptions as he wants for next
year, ensuring he will play in as many tourna
ments he wants.
