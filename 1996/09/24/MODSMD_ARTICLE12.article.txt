# Perot files suit to join debates
## Candidate dismisses committee's claim that he cannot win 
### 
WASHINGTON <AP) - Ross
Perot sued the bipartisan commis
sion that voted to keep him out of
the presidential debates, arguing
yesterday that excluding him
would deepen public cynicism and
cause his campaign "incalculable
damage."
Shifting strategy, Perot also was
negotiating to buy network TV
time to air three 30-second com
mercials denouncing the Commis
sion on Presidential Debates.
"Where's Ross?" asks an announc
er in one. In another, the announc
er asks, "What are they afraid of?"
Both the private debate com
mission and the Federal Election
Commission were named as defen
dants in Perot's suit, which insists
that he be included in the debates
or the forums cancelled. The
debate commission has prevailed
twice before, when sued by third
party candidates in 1988 and 1992.
Perot's suit, filed in U.S. Dis

trict Court, faults the debate com
mission's finding that he and run
ning mate Pat Choate have no real
istic chance of being elected.
"Declaring the election essen
tially over for all candidates but
two before a single debate takes
place will only deepen the nation's
cynicism about government," it
states.
The suit contends that the com
mission, in recommending debates
limited to President Clinton and
GOP candidate Bob Dole, violated
federal election law and certain
constitutional rights of Perot and
Choate.
Presidential debates are sched
uled for Oct. (i in Hartford, Conn.,
and Oct. 16 in San Diego. A vice
presidential face-off is set for Oct. 9
in St. Petersburg, Fla.
The lawsuit contends that the
commission violated Federal Elec
tion Commission rules requiring
"objective criteria" for determining

whom to include in debates. It
faults the FEC for failing to
enforce its rules.
Perot's lawsuit argues the
debate commission used a mostly
subjective standard in inviting only
those it deemed to have a "realistic
chance" of winning.
Perot meets objective tests such
as assembling a national organiza
tion, being on the ballot in all 50
states and receiving nearly $30 mil
lion in federal campaign funds, the
suit said.
"The Democratic and Republi
can parties should not be permitted
to consolidate their monopoly on
the political process by closing off
the presidential debates," the suit
states.
Furthermore, it says, Perot and
Choate have been illegally barred
from the debates, "thereby causing
incalculable damage to their cam
paigns."
There was a chance the court

would combine the lawsuit with
one already filed by John Ilagelin,
presidential nominee of the Natu
ral Law Party. A hearing in that
case was scheduled for tomorrow.
Clinton had urged that Perot be
included in the debates and Dole
had pushed for his exclusion.
Russell Verney, Reform Party
national coordinator, told
reporters that Clinton and Dole
were equally to blame for the shu
out. While the Clinton campaign
publicly said Perot should be
included, it privately negotiated to
keep him out, Verney said.
"It's one more example of the
fear the two major parties have
toward creation of a third party,"
Verney said at a news conference
on the courthouse steps.
Joe Lockhart, Clinton campaign
spokesman, disputed Verney's
account. "We pushed very hard to
have Mr. Perot included in the
debate." he said.
