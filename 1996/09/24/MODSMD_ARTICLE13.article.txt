too fragile right now to withstand
heart surgery, a top American car

day to offer his opinion. The Com
munists demanded Yeltsin step
down if he can't govern.
Television newscasts led with
the arrival of heart specialist Dr.
Michael Deßakey, who will join in
examinations tomorrow that could

operation.
The top Russian surgeons who

While declaring "I'm always

reportedly is pressing doctors to
operate.
"The operation most probably
won't take place this month, but
the final decision will be made by
doctors at tomorrow's consulta
tion," Yeltsin press spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
