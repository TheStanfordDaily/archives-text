University neglects its
returning students by
providing few services

Yeah, square dancing at
MuFuUnSun seems a little
silly. And who even read the
novel for the dorm book-discussion
anyway? But for all you freshmen
who may be orientationed-out,
savor these waning hours while
your first days on campus actually
seem to matter to someone. Next
year, you'll be lucky to get a "hey,
there" from your drawmate.
The official move-in day for
upperclassmen was Sunday, but
you wouldn't know it by looking at
the University's treatment of its
older students. Basic services like
checking students into their new
rooms, offering meals, allowing
them to pick up their storage items
and having some form of organized
entertainment available were lim
ited, leaving a distinct impression
of neglect on the part of the Uni
versity.
Move-in day for freshmen was
Friday, and the newcomers had the
option of arriving any time
between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Resident
assistants greeted them enthusias
tically, gave them their keys,
helped lug their baggage to their
rooms (or suckered an Orientation
volunteer into doing it), helped
move furniture, lofted beds and
basically tried to make freshmen
feel more than welcome to the
... Farm.
' Upperclassmen, on the other
hand, returned Sunday only to find
they could check in to their new
rooms during a narrow window of
time in the afternoon. Dorm offices
across campus were only open
from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., five hours
less than was available for fresh
man check-in. As many Stanford
students from around the country
and even the world know, finding a
plane arrival time that fits perfect
ly into these few hours is difficult.
Exit keys and room keys, then,

were obviously harder to come by
for upperclassmen than their
younger counterparts.
If the upperclassmen could
eventually get into their rooms,
they then had to find a ride to a
restaurant off-campus or brave the
lines at the on-campus eateries for
both lunch and dinner. While
freshmen received a temporary
meal pass, starting with lunch on
their arrival day, upperclassmen's
meal plans did not start until yes
terday
Unpacking was also a difficult
task for upperclassmen since
Wilbur storage was only open for
two hours Sunday morning. Even
if students did make it to storage
by noon, they still could not get
their room keys for an hour, leav
ing them with the task of self-stor
ing their storage boxes in the
meantime. Bikes, the main mode of
transportation for many Stanford
students, could not be retrieved
from Stern storage until late yes
terday afternoon. Again, since
older students could not eat in
their dorms, they had to eat else
where but had no bikes to get
there.
Entertainment was also a prob
lem for upperclassmen. When
Sigma Chi put up a banner adver
tising a party over the weekend,
Orientation organizers complained
that this interrupted freshman Ori
entation. So, unless upperclassmen
wanted to karaoke along with the
Class of 2000, there was little orga
nized on-campus fun to be had.
Obviously, freshman Orientation
is important. It is crucial to make
sure new students feel comfortable
in their new home during the days
before classes begin.
But basic services should be
available for Stanford's older stu
dents as well. This doesn't mean a
repeat of freshman Orientation,
complete with "More Sex in the
'90s" or "Faces in the Community,
the Sequel."
It merely means the University
needs to recognize that upperclass
men also must feel welcome upon
their return to school.
