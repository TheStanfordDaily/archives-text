## Elliott Brown Confessions of a Banana Berry addict

u TT There were
\l\l you when
Y ▼ the Chal
lenger exploded?"
"What were you
doing when you found
out about the JFK
assassination?"
Every now and then
some sort of tragedy

transpires which has such a profound
effect on a group of people that any
member of that group can tell you
where they were when it happened.
This summer a tragedy of this magni
tude struck Stanford on June 19 at
10:30 p.m. If you don't know what I'm
talking about, maybe you should take a
second to ask yourself where you were
when Juice Club burned.
I was lounging in my luxurious sum
mer accommodations on the corner of
Emerson Street and Embarcadero Road
— only 652 steps from Juice Club's
pearly gates. I heard the fire engines
but thought nothing of it. The next
morning when I cruised into the Town
and Country parking lot for my daily
constitutional, I encountered a group of
mourning joggers wearing black and
bearing flowers. I looked past them and
witnessed the charred storefront, the
twisted skeleton that had been Juice
Club.
I know many of you did not spend the
summer in the immediate vicinity and
may be experiencing deep depression
coupled with physical withdrawal symp

toms.
For several days I was incapacitated
with grief. I sat in my room crying,
dreaming about what could have been,
and writing poems ("I drank Juice Club
in the AM / I drank Juice Club in the
PM / Nev'r again will I enjoy Juiceßoost
TM").
There are certainly different ways of
dealing with the loss of a smoothie
place. I initially vowed not to drink juice
in any form. But when scurvy
inevitably set in, my doctor, my thera
pist and I decided it was time for me to
start seeing some new smoothies. I
donned my finest sweatsuit and hit the
mean streets of Palo Alto in search of
the real deal.
Not knowing where to start, I chose
the apparent progenitor of all smooth
ies, The Original Smoothie Company.
Instead of being greeted by a long line,
folksy music and a band of peppy, fresh
faced Paly High kids, I encountered
myself, Shaggy from Scooby Doo behind
the counter and the musical stylings of
Jon Secada. Despite its complex menu
of "Juicers" and "Energizers," I
couldn't seem to find any smoothies
there. They didn't even have wheat
grass.
I was ready to give up, but my body
was screaming for some delicious
scrambled juice and Juice Central was
only a block away.
My Juice Central experience was
interesting. The same initials, similar
logo, wheatgrass, located next to a busy

restaurant, partially zitty kids behind
the counter and, uh, Howard Stern on
the radio. The product was refreshing,
but not the high-grade stuff I was
accustomed to.
Yes, Juice Central was OK, but like
the famous song says, "You take the
good, you take the bad, you take 'em
both and now you have impetus to try
another smoothie." Or something like
that.
With this thought in mind, I hopped
in the car and headed to Jam'n Juice.
While its atmosphere and stubbley
employees leave something to be
desired, the smoothies are fairly savory.
Don't get me wrong Juiceheads, I could
never give Jam'n Juice the illustrious
four Pi Phi rating, but I wouldn't turn
down one of their Tropical Tay Tays.
My smoothie crusade had given me
hope, but the thought of quitting lin
gered in my mind.
I've heard of people using the nico
tine patch to quit smoking, so I thought
maybe the Juice Patch would be a good
way to drop that nasty smoothie habit. 1
hoped to find 12-step programs and an
emotional support group but discovered
only step aerobicists discussing arch
supports. Oh well. I guess you just have
to grimace, order and pray for the safe
return of Juice Club.

Elliott Drown, a senior majoring in
urban studies, wishes he was still pick
ing Banana Berry out of his teeth. Luck
ily, Juice Club reopens in November.
