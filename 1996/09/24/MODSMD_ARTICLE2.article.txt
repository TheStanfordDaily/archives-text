# OBSTACLE TO MERGER
## 
### 
• What happened: The Public
Employment Relations Board
has filed a complaint against
the UC Regents, saying they
should provide the unions rep
resenting UCSF employees
with details of how a merger be
tween UCSF Medical Center
and Stanford Health Services
will work.
• What it could mean: Poten
tially, the courts could order the
merger stopped until the unions
are admitted to the process. UC
officials claim they have no
obligation to inform or bargain
with the unions regarding the
merger.
