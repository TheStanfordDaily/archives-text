Workers unionized
On June 10, employees of Bon Appetit, which runs
the Coffee House and other Tresidder Union eater

Rodin donor died
B. Gerald Cantor, a wealthy financier and philan
thropist, died July 3 in Los Angeles. He gave Stanford
its Rodin Sculpture Garden, the largest collection of
works by sculptor Auguste Rodin outside of Paris. He

vation to the Stanford Art Museum, which remains
closed seven years after the Loma Prieta Earth
quake.
Sand Hill report released
An environmental impact report on the Universi
ty's proposed Sand Hill Road Project was released.
The $342 million project would widen Sand Hill Road

available, build new senior housing units and expand
the Stanford Shopping Center. The project has been
highly controversial because of environmental issues.

Swimming coach charged

while swimming recreationally at a campus pool.
Prof, led Mars research
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare and other re
searchers were in the spotlight this summer after
they announced the discovery of evidence suggest
ing microscopic life existed on Mars more than 3.6
billion years ago. Researchers uncovered organic
compounds and fossil-like structures on a small
piece of a Martian meteorite. The announcement
has been met by much excitement and much skep
ticism.
Chen succumbed to leukemia
Stanford undergraduate Evan Chen, 20, died July
28 after a long battle with leukemia and complica
tions from a bone marrow transplant performed last
October.
Chen's struggles motivated his friend, Yul Kwon,
to organize a massive bone marrow registration drive
in spring 1995, one of the largest such drives ever.
Chen eventually was matched to a donor from Tai
wan but suffered complications after the transplant.
A memorial service is scheduled for 3 p.m. Thursday
in Memorial Church, followed by a reception in the
Kimball Hall lounge.
