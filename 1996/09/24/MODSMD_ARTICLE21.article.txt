## Volleyball rebounds in desert Cardinal earns two conference wins from 'Zonas 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
Character is often created through
adversity. The Stanford women's vol
leyball team rebounded from last
Tuesday's loss to Pacific by making a
clean sweep through the state of Ari
zona and defeating two Pacific 10
Conference opponents, extending its
nearly two-year-long conference win
ning streak.
The second-ranked Cardinal (9-1,
2-0 Pac-10) opened up the conference
season in Tucson on Friday, where
Stanford overcame a rough start and
beat the Wildcats 9-15, 15-13, 15-10,
15-9. Sunday's contest against Ari
zona State was only slightly easier,
16-14, 15-10, 15-2.
The Cardinal entered the contest 7-
1 after its only loss of the year at UOP,
where excellent serving by the Tigers
and Stanford's struggle to pass the
ball resulted in a surprising three
games to one victory for the under
dogs from Stockton.
At the beginning of the Arizona
match, it appeared the Cardinal had
not dug itself out of the rut. Stanford
started the first game sluggishly, and
eventually lost 15-9.
Stanford rebounded in game two,
squeezing out a 15-13 victory to keep
the squad from falling behind two
games to zero for the second consecu

tive match. The Cardinal women then
finished the Wildcats off 15-10 and 15-
9 to open the 1996 Pac-10 campaign
on the right foot.
"We definitely have a strong of
fense," said junior outside hitter Deb
bie Lambert. "As long as we serve and
pass well, we will be fine."
Indeed, the high-octane one-two
punch of junior Kristin Folkl and
freshman Kerri Walsh has helped
make the Cardinal an awesome offen
sive force. Folkl led the Stanford
squad with 20 kills, and Walsh added
11 more.
However, the Cardinal arsenal in
cludes a variety of powerful weapons
in addition to the two outside hitters,
including senior middle blocker
Eileen Murfee, who contributed with
15 kills against the Wildcats. Junior
co-captain Lisa Sharpley led the squad
with 46 assists and 14 digs.
The addition of Walsh has helped
Folkl dominate most of Stanford's op
ponents.
"Since (Walsh] is such a big hitter,
they can't really cheat over to me,"
Folkl said. "If they do, Kerri is likely
to really put it to them. Actually, even
if they don't, she still will probably put
it to them."
The Stanford team then traveled to
Arizona State two days later, taking
on the Sun Devils in Tempe. The Car
dinal began the match slowly once

again, but eventually battled back
from game point to win the opening
game 16-14.
From there, the Cardinal took care
of business, winning the next game
15-10 before destroying Arizona State
15-2 in the final frame. Folkl once
again paced the team with 19 kills and
five blocks. Walsh also performed
well, recording 14 kills to go along
with her four blocks. Sharpley added
42 assists, and junior middle blocker
Barbara Ifejika and freshman outside
hitter Jaimi Gregory each had eight
digs.
The Cardinal will once again hope
to dominate the conference and re
main a marked target for its Pac-10
opponents. However, if the Stanford
squad continues its habit of falling be
hind early in its matches, the road to
the conference title will be a longer
one.
"I think the team is a little tenta
tive," Lambert said. "We seem scared
to lose, and we need to be more ag
gressive."
The Cardinal squad has practiced
more intensely this season, but at
times the team seems not to turn it up
on game day.
"We seem very dead," Folkl said.
"We figure [the opponents] should
just hand the match to us since we
worked so hard for it during the week.
We can't afford to do that."
