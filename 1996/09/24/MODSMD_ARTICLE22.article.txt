The Olympics: the stage
where the world's finest
athletes compete for the
pride of their country and the
glory of winning a gold medal.
The Summer Games of At
lanta provided American ath
letes the same opportunities

for honor and glory as other
Olym-pics, but the Centennial
Games were markedly differ
ent from its predecessors.
More countries and athletes
competed in the XXVIth
Olympiad than ever before.
These Games were called "the
largest peacetime gathering in
history" (and rightly so) and
sported more participants
than the 1984 Los Angeles and
1992 Barcelona Games com
bined.
However, the most colossal
difference between the 1996
Olympics and its ancestors had
little to do with the number of
athletes, countries or specta
tors. It was the emergence of
women's athletics to a world
stage like none ever before ex
perienced.
Title IX was passed more
than a decade ago, and Stan
ford has always been at the top
in women's sports. But the
rest of the world did not seem
ready to accept women in the
role of the dominating sports
figure until these Olympic
Games.
But in just 16 days the U.S.
women in Atlanta stole the
spotlight from their male
counterparts (i.e. the Dream
Team) and racked up an im
pressive number of medals
(mostly gold) both individually
and in team sports. In a few
fatal Swoopes the "little girl"
image that has dominated the
opinions of most Olympic
couch potatoes for years was
wiped away.
Even the women's gymnas
tics team, which by most phys
ical standards conforms to the
"little girl" image (Dominique
Moceanu — 4-foot-6, age 14 —
enough said), pulled off a
tremendous team effort to
claim gold and stand higher
upon the medal platform (bum
ankle and all) than any other
gymnastics team in American
history. The men's team won a
team gold in 1984, but that
was in a Games that was not
fully attended.
Like gymnastics, other
team sports soared to popular

ity in Atlanta and far out
reached any expectations of
the fans or the athletes.
Women's softhall, soccer and
basketball teams all won gold
for the United States, and
women's volleyball, although
the Americans were upset in
the early rounds, proved to be
one of the most popular sports
of the Olympics.
Team sports and women's
successes went hand in hand at
the '96 Games. The U.S. soft
ball team played every game in
front of sellout crowds at Gold
en Park in Columbus, Ga., and
attracted such attention that
Olympic planners hopefully
made a mental note to place
the softball venue in Sydney in
a stadium that seats more than
8,500 spectators.
Softball finally got its due at
these Olympic Games in its
first appearance as a medal
sport. Dot Richardson and Lisa
Fernandez became household
names, and many people made
the startling discovery that
softball is more than a weekly
"beer blast" with their co
workers. For example, how
many Olympic spectators
knew that prior to the
Olympics the U.S. softball
team had a 10-year interna
tional record of 110-1?
Women's soccer also shat
tered expectations in Atlanta
— not to mention a few
eardrums. Sanford Stadium in
Athens, Ga., was packed for
every game, and the noise level
was high enough to cause se
vere earaches for the specta
tors.
The fans at Sanford Stadi
um haven't had a champi
onship to scream about since
1980 when Herschel Walker
led the Dawgs to the NCAA
title. So when the world's most
popular sport, "football," took
to the field the people went
crazy. No one even cared about
the disappearance of the
hedges when they were re
placed by the U.S. women's
soccer team and a team gold
medal.
Women's basketball added
one more team gold medal to
the tally on the final day of
Olympic competition, and al
though I completely agree with
the notion that the women
were the "true dream team,"
that comparison has already
been made by many eloquent
journalists.
But here's food for thought.
The women won their gold
medal match by 24 points, the
men by 27. The women didn't
complain about room service,
the men did. The women
trained harder for the
Olympics. The men's team is
thrown together at the end of
