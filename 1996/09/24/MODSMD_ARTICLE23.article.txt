### Vanessa Arrington Editorial staff 
After a weekend of wins at the St. Mary's
Tournament in Moraga, Calif., the men's soc
cer team's confidence is skyrocketing along
with its record, now 4-1-2.
The Cardinal team, which hasn't been de
feated since its season opener, is continuing to
prove that hard work does pay off.
"We're working hard and coming together
as a team, and we seem to be getting results,"

said senior midfielder Erik Morrison.
These results include a 1-0 win against Ver
mont on Sunday and a crushing 5-0 win over
Texas Christian last Friday.
"We were looking at these teams as two
teams we should beat, and we won them both
in different styles," Morrison said. "Against
Texas Christian, we came out and pounced
them — we started real quick and never let
them get into the game. Vermont was a pretty
physical team and it was a hot day but we kept
working hard and we got the results in over

time.
The winning goal in the Vermont game
came 3 minutes, 18 seconds into the second
overtime frame from sophomore midfielder A.
J. Sauer, who was assisted by sophomore for
ward Adam Siegman. Senior Rvan Craig kept
the Catamounts at bay, making four saves in
the lengthy shutout.
This game was the fourth to go into over
time this season for the Cardinal Morrison
said the fitness level of the team members is es
pecially high, allowing them to persevere when
they do find themselves competing in over
time.
"Vermont was a tough team to plav," coach
Bobby Clark said. "What impressed me was
the way our team handled the physical chal
lenge without losing the discipline. That was
what won us the game."
The team fared even better against Texas
Christian, preventing the Horned Frogs from
scoring while racking up five goals of its own
TCU could muster just three shots on goal to
the Cardinal's 23. Sophomore goalkeeper Jon
Bruck registered a lone save in the shutout
Sophomore newcomer Jamie Clark led the
way, making the first goal unassisted in the
38th minute. But the Cardinal piled on four
goals after the break.
Freshman Brandon Garringer scored two
goals 13 seconds apart in the 56th minute, with
assists from sophomore midfielder Aaron Jones
and Sauer. Jamie Clark scored Stanford's
fourth goal, assisted by Garringer at 66:40 and
sophomore midfielder T.K. Inbody scored unas
sisted with just under 16 minutes to play.
Unfortunately, Garringer also separated
his shoulder, which will put him out of com
mission for a couple of weeks, coach Clark said.
Garringer's injury was in addition to two oth
ers — key junior midfielder Shan Gaw dam
aged his knee and sophomore midfielder Dan
Traylor suffered a stress fracture in his leg.
"You know you're going to have injuries, so
everyone has to be ready to play," coach Clark
said. "We had great team performances this
weekend, so many players came off the bench
and played the roles. The whole squad is now
contributing."

Inbody, have returned from in
juries with good timing to fill the
holes left by the newly injured
players.
Despite the setbacks of these
injuries, the coach and team mem
bers expect that they can step up
and meet all the upcoming chal
lenges.
"We have some pretty lofty
goals," Morrison said. "But we can
get there by concentrating on one
game at a time. We're confident
that if we stay focused we can ac
complish some things this year."
Sophomore forward Adam Sieg
man agrees. "We're very optimistic,
things are really looking bright,"
Siegman said. "I think we can real
ly give it a run for the champi
onship.
"The team's goal has got to be
to get an NCAA berth, which we
haven't had for a good four or five
years. But things are really turn
ing around — the team is so much
more close and together this year.
I know we'll continue to get better
with every game."
