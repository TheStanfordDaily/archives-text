# Hockey downs UOP for perfect NorPac record
## 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
Stanford field hockey improved
to 3-1 (2-0 in the Northern Pacific
Conference) with a conference vic
tory over Pacific (0-3,0-2 NorPac)
last Saturday. The Cardinal de
fense shut out the Tigers as the of
fense posted two first-half goals
for the 2-0 final.
Stanford's defense was impen
etrable throughout the game,
mostly because the offense kept
the ball on UOP's end of the field.
The Tigers only managed four
shots on goal and none in the first
half.
"We played a really intense
game," senior tri-captain Baochi
Nguyen said. "The last couple of
games have been really good be
cause of the intensity level. We're
a really talented team, and when
we're intense we're on, we com
municate [better]."
According to Nguyen, better
communication leads to sharper
passing and better shots at the

goal, and team statistics support
her theory. Stanford tallied an im
pressive 12 shots in the first half.
The Cardinal also spread out
the shooting with only two players
taking more than one shot in the
half. All in all, 10 different Stan
ford players took a swing at the
goal with two connecting for a
score.
Sophomore Jordvn Kramer
struck first with a long shot from
just inside the 25-yard line
Nguyen said that Kramer's abili
ties from beyond the 16-yard
mark make her an exceptionally
powerful threat to other teams.
"[Kramer's] goal was really fun
to watch," Nguyen said. "Most
players don't look to shoot (from
that distance]; she has a really
powerful and precise shot. It went
in with a boom."
That score gave the Cardinal a
1-0 lend and judging from Stan
ford's defense, would have been
enough to secure the game. The

Stanford posted a conference win over UOP last weekend.
Tigers managed just four shots in
the game, all of which came in the
second half. UOP's Kim Garrland
got two shots off in the final half,
and teammates Karey Knowles
and Jen Clanton added one each.
"I thought they played really
well," Stanford coach Sheryl
Johnson said of her team. "We've
played well all through the season
with just the one loss to Cal."
The Cardinal avenged that loss
quickly in a 1-0 overtime win on
Sept. 7. By defeating the Tigers,
Stanford, the defending NorPac
Conference champions, main
tains a perfect conference record
at 2-0.
The Card hopes to repeat as
conference champs this year, and
the team's ability to adjust and
play together will be key in taking
the squad to the title. Against
UOP, Stanford was delayed by
traffic and forced to cut the usual
warm-up time almost in half.
"I think we had a very cohesive
game," said junior Paige Mader.
"We actually had to scramble dur

ing warm-ups, but the captains
pulled everyone together really
well."
Indeed the Cardinal was barely
fazed by the delay in its pre-game
routine. Kramer got the squad on
the board early and shortly after
was followed by a goal from
Nguyen. Nguyen intercepted a de
flected shot by sophomore Carey
Cloyd and placed it into the goal for
the final score of the match.
"We definitely dominated,"
Mader said. "We didn't get as many
shots as we wanted, but we had two
very good scores."
Together Mader and Cloyd form
one of the Card's biggest threats.
The duo has been exceptional in
providing Stanford with scoring
opportunities throughout the sea
son.
"Right now I think [Mader and
Cloyd] are playing really well to
gether on the right side," Johnson
said. "[They are] setting up a lot of
our goals."
Cloyd "is the fastest player on
our team, and it's really great to
work with her," Mader said. "It's
easy to get the ball up (the field)
with her. She has a great cross shot,
and if I can get it to her she'll [set up
a great shot]."
