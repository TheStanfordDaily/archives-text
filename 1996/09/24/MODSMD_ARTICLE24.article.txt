### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
Stanford field hockey improved
to 3-1 (2-0 in the Northern Pacific
Conference) with a conference vic
tory over Pacific (0-3,0-2 NorPac)
last Saturday. The Cardinal de
fense shut out the Tigers as the of
fense posted two first-half goals
for the 2-0 final.
Stanford's defense was impen
etrable throughout the game,
mostly because the offense kept
the ball on UOP's end of the field.
The Tigers only managed four
shots on goal and none in the first
half.
"We played a really intense
game," senior tri-captain Baochi
Nguyen said. "The last couple of
games have been really good be
cause of the intensity level. We're
a really talented team, and when
we're intense we're on, we com
municate [better]."
According to Nguyen, better
communication leads to sharper
passing and better shots at the

goal, and team statistics support
her theory. Stanford tallied an im
pressive 12 shots in the first half.
The Cardinal also spread out
the shooting with only two players
taking more than one shot in the
half. All in all, 10 different Stan
ford players took a swing at the
goal with two connecting for a
score.
Sophomore Jordvn Kramer
struck first with a long shot from
just inside the 25-yard line
Nguyen said that Kramer's abili
ties from beyond the 16-yard
mark make her an exceptionally
powerful threat to other teams.
"[Kramer's] goal was really fun
to watch," Nguyen said. "Most
players don't look to shoot (from
that distance]; she has a really
powerful and precise shot. It went
in with a boom."
That score gave the Cardinal a
1-0 lend and judging from Stan
ford's defense, would have been
enough to secure the game. The
