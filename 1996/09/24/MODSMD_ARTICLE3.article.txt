# In-room Ethernet fees increase again
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
The fee charged by Residential
Computing for an in-room Ether
net connection has been raised
for the second consecutive year.
The fee jumped to $45 this
year compared to $30 last year
and $10 the year before. Also,
students counting on using
modems in several dorms are
being forced to get in-room con
nections due to new restrictions
on modem dial-in access.
Residential Computing Direc
tor Jeff Merriman said the fee in
crease is necessary to offset the
department's loss on budget re
quests denied by the Provost's
Office.
"We had put in a request for
funding in the 1996-97 budget to
increase the number of resident
computer coordinators and in
crease support, due to the rising
number of in-room connections,"
Merriman said. "It was turned
down, and the Provost's Office
recommended that we increase

the fee" to make up the differ
ence.
Merriman said five more
RCCs have already started work
and a handful more would be
placed in graduate residences, es
pecially Escondido Village, be
fore the end of the year. He added
that the fee increase also will pay
for extra necessary support of
the aging computer network.
"You have to realize we are
very underfunded," he said. "We
have substandard in-room con
nections in a number of places,
and we need $1.2 million to up
grade them that we don't have.
We're sorely underfunded."
Zakiyyah Langford, the RCC
in Casa Zapata, said the reasons
for the increase have been ex
plained to her and she is passing
on the information to the resi
dents.
"The outcome is unfortu
nate," Langford said. "Many
people may not be able to afford
computers at Stanford with all
these fees."
Langford added that most stu
dents have taken the fee increase
in stride.
"People are kind of used to
Stanford raising fees," she said.
Jason Wong, an RCC in Flo
rence Moore Hall, also said he has
not heard any complaints about
the fee increase.
"I think [the fee increase J is
valid," said Wong. "You look at
the Res Comp budget, and it is re
ally tight. They're doing what
they can with the money that
they have. This is the only real
way to get more money. They
don't charge students in any
other way."
Merriman said that while
there has not yet been much
negative feedback on the fee in
creases, he has received a num
ber of complaints about the new
restrictions to modem users. As
of Sept. 16, users in residences
with the latest "port-per-pil

low" Ethernet connections art
not allowed to use the dial-ir
number.
The residences with these con
nections include Stern, Mir
rielees, Escondido Village
Crothers Memorial and a number
of Row houses. "Port-per-pillow'
is the term used to describe resi
dences which have enough in
room connections for each resi
dent, as opposed to residence*
which only have one connection
per room.
The restrictions were put in
place in order to allow students in
residences without the newer
connections or without any con
nections easier access to the dial
in resources.
"I've had a few students prett>
upset about that," said Langford
"They bought modems over the
summer and have all this equip
ment they can't use. Then thej
have to pay $100 or more for an
Ethernet card and the activation
fee.
"I wish there would have been
some way to forewarn the stu
dents." she said.
