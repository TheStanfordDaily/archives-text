# In-room Ethernet fees increase again

### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
The fee charged by Residential
Computing for an in-room Ether
net connection has been raised
for the second consecutive year.
The fee jumped to $45 this
year compared to $30 last year
and $10 the year before. Also,
students counting on using
modems in several dorms are
being forced to get in-room con

on modem dial-in access.
Residential Computing Direc

department's loss on budget re

funding in the 1996-97 budget to
increase the number of resident
computer coordinators and in
crease support, due to the rising
number of in-room connections,"
Merriman said. "It was turned
down, and the Provost's Office
recommended that we increase

the fee" to make up the differ

Merriman said five more
RCCs have already started work
and a handful more would be
placed in graduate residences, es
pecially Escondido Village, be
fore the end of the year. He added
that the fee increase also will pay
for extra necessary support of
the aging computer network.
"You have to realize we are
very underfunded," he said. "We
have substandard in-room con
nections in a number of places,
and we need $1.2 million to up
grade them that we don't have.
We're sorely underfunded."
Zakiyyah Langford, the RCC
in Casa Zapata, said the reasons
for the increase have been ex
plained to her and she is passing
on the information to the resi
dents.
"The outcome is unfortu
nate," Langford said. "Many
people may not be able to afford
