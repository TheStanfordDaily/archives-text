## Maqazine Honors Stanford Women 
### Mignon Fogarty Contributing writer 
While women's magazines have long been criti
cized for providing young girls with inadequate role
models and unrealistic physical expectations, a con
test run by Glamour magazine aims to honor college
women for outstanding accomplishments.
Two Stanford seniors grace this year's list of the
Top 10 College Women chosen by Glamour maga
zine. Selena Saunders and Curtis Sittenfeld were
both awarded $ 1,000 and a trip to New York City for
their academic and career-related accomplish
ments. The winners were selected from a pool of
more than 1,000 applicants from around the coun
try.
The contest, which began 39 years ago as a list of
the best- dressed college women, has become a step
ping stone to success for more recent awardees.
Past winners include news anchors Nancy Glass
and Sheila Stainback, and journalists Annette
Grant (The New York Times) and Christine Russell
(The Washington Post).
Saunders, a Los Angeles native, is an interna
tional relations whose long-term goal is to
found a socially responsible money management
firm. Saunders spent last summer as an intern in

the investment banking industry
in New York.
Describing the weekend with
Glamour, Saunders said, "Glam
our did a great job of bringing in
accomplished women from fields
the winners were interested in.
After our tour of the stock ex
change, it was fabulous to meet
the highest-ranking woman at
Merrill Lynch."
Sittenfeld is originally from
Cincinnati and transferred to
Stanford last year from Vassar
College. Sittenfeld's goal is to work
as a writer. To this end she is ma
joring in English, as well as work
ing for various publications. Last
summer, Sittenfeld interned at
Might, a San Francisco-based mag
azine. She is currently the editor of
Intermission, The Stanford Daily's
arts and entertainment section.
Both winners were originally
unaware of the Glamour contest.
Saunders was in Colombia when
her mother saw last year's issue,

featuring the Top 10 College
Women.
"My mom called me in Colom
bia and said I just had to enter this
contest," said Saunders. "I was
initially very hesitant, for one rea
son because I was 7,000 miles
away. But she went ahead and
wrote in for the application forms
anyway."
Sittenfeld had entered and won
magazine contests before. In fact,
the first of her many writing
awards was from Seventeen mag
azine when she was only 16 years
old. "One of my friends ordered an
application for me," Sittenfeld
said. "I decided to apply because I
knew I wouldn't be earning
money as an intern at Might this
summer." Sittenfeld has also in
terned at The New Yorker and
The Atlantic Monthly, neither of
which was a paid position.
Sittenfeld and Saunders have
both received a lot of attention
since Glamour hit newsstands
across the nation in mid-Septem
ber. Saunders was in Brazil doing
research for her thesis, but re
turned to find numerous mes
sages on her answering machine

from many well-wishers, includ
ing long lost high school friends
and past elementary school teach
ers.
Sittenfeld said her little sister,
who is a high school student in
Cincinnati, "thinks I'm cheesy. In
Cincinnati, the magazine came
out with a sticker on it that said
'Cincinnati's Own Curtis Sitten
feld.' My sister thinks that's pret
ty weird, and actually so do I. I
went to boarding school, so it's
been seven years since I lived at
home."
Both winners have received
Stanford Undergraduate Re
search Opportunity grants, which
have given them the chance to
pursue some of their unique inter
ests. Saunders was awarded URO
funds to study economic develop
ment and race relations in Colom
bia, Guatemala and Ecuador. The
URO grant has given Sittenfeld
the freedom to work on 10 short
stories she is writing about female
adolescents.
Saunders' and Sittenfeld's
weekend in New York featured
an array of activities, including
briefing Glamour editors on the

most important issues facing col
lege women today, sightseeing
trips to the Museum of Modern
Art and a Broadway play, and
lunch with many accomplished
professional women. Both
women also took advantage of
the optional makeover at an up
scale New York salon.
Sittenfeld noted that for most
of the weekend the group of win
ners were in contrived situations.
She had begun to feel that "some
of the other winners seemed to
take themselves kind of serious
ly." Both Sittenfeld and Saunders
agreed, however, that on their sec
ond night in the hotel, a time
when no activities had been
planned for them, the women re
ally opened up to each other.
"We were comparing notes
about how we had answered all
the questions from the people at
Glamour (for the interviews that
appeared in the magazine), and
everybody began behaving much
more naturally," Sittenfeld said.
Saunders agreed. "I can defi
nitely see that the basis for long
term friendships were formed by
the end of the weekend."
