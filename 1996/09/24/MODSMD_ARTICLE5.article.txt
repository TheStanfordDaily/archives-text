# Women's Center receives $50K

In an important step for the women's com
munity on campus, the University has agreed to
give an additional $50,000 to the Women's Cen
ter this year. The money will give the center a
permanent base to increase its stafr and out
reach programs.
The new staffing will consist of a part-time
graduate coordinator and five student interns,
according to Vice Provost and Dean for Student
Affairs Mary Edmonds.
The funding was increased in response to a
proposal last spring that emerged from a
promise University President Gerhard Casper
gave a student delegation at his "Tea and More
Cookies" open meeting. Before this year, the
center received only about $22,000 a year in
University funding.
Despite the fact that women make up more
than 50 percent of undergraduates and a signif
icant portion of the graduate student body, the
Women's Collective, a student umbrella organi
zation which funds approximately 50 women
centered groups, had its $19,000 special-fee re
quest rejected in the ASSU election last spring.
The center has historically depended on
year-to-year funding from the ASSU rather
than from a steady source, such as the adminis
tration. The administration has funded other
community centers in years past.
"I think the loss of the fee was the straw that
broke the camel's back," said Nanci Howe, di
rector of the Office of Student Activities. "With
out the ASSU support, the students became
aware of the inadequacies of the financial sup
port for the center."
In addition to providing a larger staff at the
center, the additional funding will also pay for a
part-time coordinator for the Graduate
Women's Network, a group committed to acad
emically supporting graduate women.
The network will also receive permanent
funding from the University. In the past, the
program was funded on an ad hoc basis each
year by different schools, said sophomore Cathy
Rion, a student volunteer at the center and one
of the authors of the proposal.

With additional funding, the center will be
able to host more annual events. The center
plans to start a big sister / little sister program,
which will match each incoming female fresh
man with an upperclass woman.
The center will also develop a faculty brown
bag lunch series which will bring in different fe
male faculty and staff to discuss their profes
sional and personal experiences, a senior honors
thesis forum, and a sophomore support group,

among other programs.
"The main focus of the center this year if
going to be just establishing the center as a re
source center for women," Women's Center Co
ordinator Anne-Marie Nunez said, "anc
through that, by making it more established, w(
hope to develop programs related to women's is
sues."
