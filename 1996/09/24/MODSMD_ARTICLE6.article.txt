# Scholarly works enter superhighway

As part of a continuing effort to explore new
avenues of academic publishing, Stanford Uni
versity Press and the Stanford University Li
braries have teamed up to publish scholarly books
on the Internet.
The project has three main goals: to provide
easy, inexpensive access to scholarly informat ion;
to present the material in an academic environ
ment; and to study the economics of academic
electronic publishing.
The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which has
given longtime support to research libraries, has
awarded a $500,000 grant to fund the project.
"We have a major interest in electronic pub
lishing," said Mellon Foundation Secretary
Richard Ekman. "In the 19905, we noticed that
the operating costs for research libraries were

growing at a very rapid rate. We decided the foun
dation should support experiments in which dif
ferent types of scholarly information were made
available electronically."
Both Ekman and Stanford University Press
Director Norris Pope have a vested interested in
the economic dimensions of this latest endeavor.
"Library budgets are often under financial
pressure," said Pope. "That can threaten the dis
semination (of information) in book form in
smaller academic fields."
The books scheduled for electronic publishing
will focus on Latin American studies. The vol
umes will have a widespread audience via the
World Wide Web, allowing those who subscribe to
browse, download and copy material at will.
"This could have a very profound impact on
the field," Pope said. "At the very least, this pro
ject will make knowledge available to people who
don't have easy access."

Eventually, the project team hopes the Web
site will have enough subscriptions to become
self-sustaining. Then new books can be added,
and the site can become one of "evolving knowl
edge," said Senior Librarian Victoria Reich, a pro
ject team member who helped write the proposal.
The site will be established within the next year,
she added.
This project is not the first electronic publish
ing endeavor for the University libraries. Their
High Wire Press division — which connects schol
ars and readers through the Web — helped estab
lish one of the first full-text Internet versions of a
science journal. It is now working on producing
an online version of Science magazine.
"This project is an opportunity for the Stan
ford University Press and libraries to work to
gether to see if we can expand what we've learned
about how people use journal literature online,"
said Reich.
