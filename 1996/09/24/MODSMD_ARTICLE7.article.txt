# University to stop poisoning squirrels
## 60-day reprieve for arboretum squirrels 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
Afler months of internal discus
sion, Stanford has announced it
will stop poisoning ground squir
rels living in the arboretum.
For a number of years, the Uni
versity has been poisoning the
squirrels living in the area on ei
ther side of Palm Drive to preserve
oak and eucalyptus trees, Director
of Facilities Operations Chris
ChristofTerson said.
Afler six months of discussion,
the Facilities Department last
week decided to place a 60-day
moratorium on poisoning the
squirrels, he said.
The moratorium will continue
until the grounds division of the
Facilities Department can come
up with substantial evidence that
the arboretum-area trees are actu
ally being harmed, ChristofTerson
said.
Although poisoning ground
squirrels is a common practice by
large institutions to control the an
imal population, Christofferson
said, "There's a balance between

doing the right thing environmen
tally [for the squirrels] and pre
serving the heritage trees."
Forty bait stations, which are
similar to a plastic buckets, were
buried underground. Bait laced
with poison would lure the rodent
to one of two tubes attached to the
sides of the trap, according to
Michael Fox. the special projects
manager in Facilities Department.
The poison causes internal
bleeding and two days of intense
pain when ingested by the squir
rels, said Andy Freedman, a Palo
Alto resident and environmental
activist. In a letter to University
President Gerhard Casper, he
wrote: "The Sierra Club has
deemed this as the most hideous
and cruelest manner in which an
animal is put to death."
According to Freedman, biology
experts report that poisoning
ground squirrels actually increas
es their population because when
there are fewer squirrels, there is
more food, leaving the remaining
rodents to repopulate in higher
numbers.
Christofferson said the Facili
ties Department is exploring al

ternatives, which may be more
labor-intensive but more hu
mane. The fact that the Universi
ty removed the traps completely,
rather than just removing the poi
son from the traps, shows a com
mitment to find another solution,
he said.
