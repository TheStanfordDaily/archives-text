Laser 3-D imaging
The 3-D technology uses laser beams to vibrate ions. Depending on
the type of vibration, ions can glow either red, green or blue. These ions
can be arranged in a way so 3-D images can be created.
The cube glass is bombarded with electronically
charged particles called ions.
Laser
beam
The ion begins
to vibrate once
the two laser
beams strike it.
The vibrations
cause the ion
to glow red,
green or blue.
