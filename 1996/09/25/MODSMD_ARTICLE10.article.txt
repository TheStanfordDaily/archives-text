# Fed declines to raise rates
## 'Strong economy' given credit for Reserve's decision 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal
Reserve, split over raising interest
rates, opted yesterday to do nothing six
weeks before voters go to the polls.
President Clinton said the decision
"shows we have got a strong economy
with no inflation."
The central bank's decision followed
nearly five hours of closed-door internal
debate by the Federal Open Market
Committee, the group of Fed board
members and regional bank presidents
who meet eight times a year to set inter
est rates.
In advance of yesterday's meeting, the
last before the Nov. 5 election, a number
of economists had predicted the central
bank would launch a pre-emptive strike
against inflation by nudging interest
rates higher. It would have been the first
increase in Fed rates in 19 months.
While some private economists wor
ried that the central bank's inaction
threatened rising prices down the road,

President Clinton welcomed the deci
sion as a confirmation of his campaign
claims about the U.S. economy.
"It shows we have got a strong econ
omy with no inflation. I am glad about
that," Clinton told reporters during a
campaign stop in Freehold, N.J.
GOP nominee Bob Dole complained
that interest rates under Bill Clinton
are still "higher in every category." His
running mate, Jack Kemp, had pledged
before yesterday's meeting to "bang on
the Fed" if it raised rates.
The reaction in financial markets was
mixed. The stock market initially shot
up by 50 points, but those gains were
quickly whittled away by profit-taking.
The Dow Jones industrial average
ended the day down 20.71 at 5,874.03.
But the bond market, always worried
about the future course of inflation and
interest rates, rallied with strong
demand pushing the yield on the bench
mark 30-year Treasury down to 6.99

percent.
An unprecedented leak last week
showed that eight of the Fed's 12
regional banks were pushing for an
increase in interest rates. The Fed has
reportedly asked the FBI for help in
investigating the source of the leak.
Some economists viewed the leak as
an effort by inflation hawks at the
regional banks to influence the Fed's
debate.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan "probably really resented
that leak and it may have made him dig
in his heels about any change in policy,"
said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at
Merrill Lynch in New York.
Analysts said the Fed apparently
decided in the end that the situation
was still too murky to alter monetary
policy. The Fed has kept the money sup
ply on hold since Jan. 31, when it made
the last of three rate cuts engineered tc
boost growth.
