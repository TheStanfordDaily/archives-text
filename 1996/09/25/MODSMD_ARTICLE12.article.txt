ASSU President Shen
addresses students'
concerns over safety

CAMPUS SAFETY MAY be an
issue about which Stanford
students rarely feel the need
to think, but the Farm is far from
immune from the full array of crim
inal activity. It is therefore comfort
ing to know that ASSU President
Bill Shen has made campus safety a
top priority; even better, he can
already point to two concrete
accomplishments that tangibly
increase safety on campus.
As returning students have prob
ably noticed, 19 blue emergency
phones were installed around cam
pus over the summer. What every
one may not know is that these
phones are only the first in a plan to
blanket the campus with 75 blue
light towers. These phones will
serve both the causes of crime pre
vention and rapid police response to
ongoing situations.
How the phones came to be is a
story that students ought to know
because it is a lesson in how student
government can work. A problem in
student life was recognized; the
ASSU produced a report detailing
both the problem and viable solu
tions, and the Provost's Office
quickly came up with the money to
have the solution implemented.
Shen and former Senate Chair
Elaine Murdoch deserve particular
credit as the authors of the ASSU
campus safety report and fighters
for the implementation of its recom
mendations. Too often, ASSU sug
gestions are forgotten as soon as
they are passed, and with the huge
turnover endemic to student gov
ernment there is little institutional
memory to carry forward reforms
started in the past year. That is why
speedy implementation of reforms
is so crucial and why Shen ought to
stick to his post-election promise of
last spring to pursue only
"winnable battles" as ASSU presi
dent.

Campus safety is most definitely
a win-win issue; everybody who
lives or works on campus benefits
from safety improvements. Faculty,
staff and administration should be
just as concerned about the issue as
dorm residents, and the quick
response of the Provost's Office to
the ASSU report along with the
positive cooperation of Stanford law
enforcement officials prove that a
campus-wide consensus exists to
propel safety improvements.
It is therefore encouraging to see
that Shen followed up on his safety
rhetoric and took the prudent step
of promoting bike registration dur
ing Orientation week. Bicycle theft
is the most common crime on cam
pus; 545 bikes were snatched just
last year. And while registration
alone cannot stop thieves from
stealing bikes, it can go a long way
toward making the recovery of
stolen bikes possible. The ASSU's
"bike for a buck" registration cam
paign offered 500 students subsi
dized bike registration on a first
come, first-serve basis, making bike
registration both cheaper and more
attractive.
Lest anyone think that these
measures are mere political gim
micks, Stanford Police Special Ser
vices Manager Dan Smith praised
Shen for both the blue emergency
phones and the bike registration
campaign. "Registering your bike is
the only way we'll be able to help
you out if your bike is stolen,"
Smith said. "We are happy to have
such good cooperation with an
ASSU president who wants to make
Stanford an even safer place."
The student body, as well as fac
ulty and staff, will be well served if
Shen continues to promote campus
security throughout his term. The
cooperation is there from campus
police, and Vice Provost and Dean
for Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
has long been an advocate for cam
pus safety. Shen ought to take
advantage of these fortuitous cir
cumstances to push through long
overdue improvements in outdoor
lighting and earthquake prepara
tion.
