## Rudolph Delson Progressives, vote your consciences 
### 
IF YOU ARE a liber
al, the worst thing
you can do in
November is vote for
Clinton, and the worst
imaginable outcome is
that he win because of
your support or lose in
spite of it.
No leftist can be

pleased with the course the Clinton
presidency has taken. Clinton made
somewhat progressive noises during the
1992 campaign, but his genuine loyal
ties are revealed by his economic poli
cies which have accelerated the trends
that have made income distribution
more unequal in 1996 than at any other
time since 1945. Of course Clinton
learned from Reagan that working
against the disenfranchised is not
enough in itself; Clinton has invested
enormous energy in supporting corpo
rations and the wealthy. He has won
support for NAFTA, GATT and $150
billion annually in corporate welfare.
Sadly, Clinton's finest moments have
been when he has been able to stand in
contrast to the monstrously pro-corpo
rate House Republicans. Clinton looked
great fretting over the absurd dilemma
of choosing between school lunches and
a quickly balanced budget. But he has
accepted much of the Republican agen
da: free trade as the clear solution to
Chinese human rights violations; police
and prisons as a just solution to crime;
the welfare reform bill as a tender solu

tion to poverty; the Salvage Rider as a
good solution to the so-called problem
of too many ancient forests.
But what are you to do if you believe
that a second Clinton term will contin
ue to take your country in this insensi
ble, inhumane direction? You want to
vote your conscience. But not to vote for
Clinton is to risk a Dole presidency. And
surely Clinton, the moderate Republi
can, is better than Dole, the conserva
tive Republican.
Fearful compromising of this sort
has led to today's political scene in
which there is no major candidate
whom liberals can vote for in good con
science.
But imagine that you vote for Clin
ton and he wins. He and the Democrats
will gleefully reflect that, so long as
they stay to the left of the Republicans
on a few issues (e.g., abortion rights),
they can move as far to the right on
other issues as they like. And the fur
ther to the right they move on issues
like free trade and labor law, the more
corporate money they will receive to
fund future campaigns.
Or, imagine that you vote for Clinton
and he loses. Again, he and the
Democrats will believe that the left is
safely in the fold, and the right-ward
drift will continue.
But you could vote for a candidate
who represents your ideals. For exam
ple, the Green Party has nominated
Ralph Nader and Wynona LaDuke, a
sound liberal platform (see http://www.

greens.org/california/). If Clinton wins
but you vote Green, Clinton and the
Democrats will understand that their
drift to the right is costing them the
left; the first step in ending the Demo
cratic wooing of the right will have been
made.
And if you vote for a third party and
Clinton loses? Seeing Dole's sneering
smile atop the newspaper on Nov. 6,
you might feel responsible for subject
ing the nation to four years of an
unbearable administration.
But within weeks you will be heart
ened. The Democrats, recognizing that
they lost the election because they lost
the left, will return to your ideals: a just
tax structure, strong environmental
protections, an expanded safety net,
decreased military expenditures, social
programs over prisons and so on.
Registering your dissent with a vote
cannot replace day-by-day progressive
activism, but voting your conscience is a
simple way to begin forcing the politi
cians who have stopped representing
your views to return to a liberal agenda.
It is a way to ebb the flow of political
discourse off to what once would have
been considered an unimaginably
vicious right. Voting your conscience is
a necessary part of ensuring that one
day there will be a candidate who both
represents your views and stands a
chance of winning.
