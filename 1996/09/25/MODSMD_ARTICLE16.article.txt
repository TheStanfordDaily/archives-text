Q:lIow does Silly Putty work?
A Silly Putty is some pretty
leat stuff. It seems like it can
do almost anything — it stretch
es, it bounces, and it can even
copy comics! What more could
you possibly want from a toy you
get out of a little plastic egg?
I mean, sure, the Barney
decoder ring can prevent the bad
kids from intercepting your secret
messages, but afterwards, can you
copy comics and stretch them out
so that Garfield looks like a 5-foot
tall ostrich? I didn't think so.
The really cool thing about
Silly Putty, though, is its mal
leability. Sometimes it's easy to
mold and smoosh around, and
sometimes it isn't.
A piece of clay, for instance,
has nothing on good old Silly
Putty. Sure, you can mold both
clay and Silly Putty into almost
any shape your heart desires —
both substances will mush
around in your hands.
However, when it comes time
to start throwing your creation
against the wall — and I know
you will — well then, your little
clay figurine doesn't stand a
chance. It'll just smash into the
wall and drop to the ground, kind
of like those birds that haven't
quite figured out that windows
are not special bird-doors.
Your Silly Putty, on the other
hand, will have a better chance.
Silly Putty bounces, and yet,
unlike other bouncy things, it can
also be molded. Just try molding a
racquetball into a miniature of
Godzilla. It's not going to happen.
At this point, you must be ask
ing, "So what is it that makes
Silly Putty so silly?"
Silly Putty belongs to a special
type of substance known as dila
tants. Dilatants are viscoelastic
non-Newtonian fluids. Generally,
what this means is that Silly
Pifcty is weird stuff.
.The key word in the descrip
tion is viscoelastic. This means
that Silly Putty and its ilk exhibit
both viscous as well as elastic
properties.
The viscous properties of Silly
Putty allow it to be molded and
shaped. In general, viscosity is a
measure of the internal resis
tance to movement. Fluids with
high viscosity, like honey, flow
slowly, while low-viscosity fluids
spill all over the place.
The elastic properties of Silly
Putty, on the other hand, give it
its bouncy properties. Elastic sub
stances will generally return to
their original shape when they
get deformed, giving them that
familiar springy quality.
So how come Silly Putty can do
both of these things?
The answer lies in the molecu
lar structure of Silly Putty. Elas
tic substances generally are made
up of polymers. Polymers are
extremely long molecules, sort of
resembling strings.

In an elastic substance, these
polymers are cross-linked, mean
ing that they are attached to each
other. When you stretch out an
elastic substance, like a rubber
band, the polymers stretch out
but retain their crosslinks. When
you let go, the substance snaps
back to its original shape.
In a fluid, however, molecules
are not held together as tightly,
so they can slip over each other
and flow.
In a dilatant, the molecules are
long polymers that can generally
slip over each other and flow like
a liquid. However, when you
apply a rapid force to the dilatant,
the polymers get tangled and
snag on to each other, causing it
to act like an elastic substance.
The key ingredients in com
mercial Silly Putty are boric acid
and silicone oil. (I'd insert an
Anna-Nicole Smith joke here, but
I felt it would be too unnatural.
Oops, too late.)
The problem with Silly Putty,
though, is that three bucks is way
too much to pay for a half ounce
of the stuff. And unless you want
to buy at least 100 pounds of it
from Dow Corning, you'll be
putty-less for life.
The good news is that I can tell
you how to make your very own
Silly Putty-like substance. This
fake Silly Putty won't copy
comics like the real stuff, but it
does all the other cool things.
What you need is a little bit of
borax and some white glue. Mix
the glue with an equal amount of
water and then add a small
amount of the borax dissolved in
water. After you mix that up real
ly well, you'll have your very own
Silly Putty.
Just keep it away from the 5-
foot-tall ostrich trying to get in
the window.
