# Campus pursues energy efficiency
## 
### Ellie Behrstock Editorial staff 
Using the latest lighting and heating tech
nology, campus buildings are currently
undergoing renovations to increase their
energy efficiency.
The Energy Retrofit Program, adminis
tered by the Energy Management Group of
the Utilities Division, updates lighting and
heating systems in campus buildings. In the
last fiscal year, there have been about 25
energy retrofit projects, including residential,
athletics and academic buildings, said Scott
Gould, the program's manager.
"Changes are being made to the efficiency
of the lighting systems and to the control sys
tems for heating and ventilation," said
Robert Reid, manager of the Energy Manage
ment Group.
Stanford has a central computerized con
trol system for heating and ventilation. "We
are using the power of computers to optimize
the operations of the buildings. By tightening
temperature controls, less excess heat and
cooling are produced which can produce obvi
ous savings," Reid said.
For lighting systems, one of the simplest
ways to save energy without compromising
light quality is to replace old fixtures with
newer, more efficient technology.
Saving money
"For the last fiscal year, we documented
3.5 million kilowatt hours in electrical sav
ings," Gould said. At 8 cents per kilowatt
hour, these reductions in energy use amount
to savings of $280,000.
Even though there is investment involved
in making these changes, by switching over to
energy-efficient technologies, the University
expects to save money in the long run.
Approximately $1.2 million was spent in
the last fiscal year on energy retrofit projects,
said Gould. It is expected that the investment
in a new project will be returned within five
years.
"These are all projects that will last 15 to
20 years, so they should pay back about four
times in their lifetime," Gould said.
Residential areas
Within the housing division, renovations
have been made in both indoor and outdoor
lighting.
"The goal is to provide the highest quality
heating, cooling and lighting systems while
being as energy-efficient as technology will
allow us," said David Frost, the energy man
agement coordinator for Housing and Dining
Services.
As part of this summer's Capital Improve
ment Plan, lighting systems in Kairos, La Mai
son Frangaise and the Delta Kappa Epsilon
house have been updated. During the non
peak use hours of 1 a.m. to 8 a.m., timers will
reduce the amount of light in hallways and
other common areas by one-third, said Frost.
In addition, occupancy sensors have been
installed in the laundry rooms, lounges and
kitchens of these houses, ensuring that lights
do not remain on when a room is not in use.
Houses undergoing improvements projects
in the future will also have timers and occu
pancy sensors installed as part of general ren
ovations, Frost said.
Stern Hall, Florence Moore Hall, the
Suites and Sterling Quad have all switched
over to compact florescent lighting systems in
their common areas. The compact fluorescent
provide about 30 percent more light while
using only 50 percent to 60 percent of the
energy of the previous incandescent and mer
cury vapor lighting systems, said Frost.
In Governor's Corner, mercury vapor out
door lights have been replaced with high

pressure sodium lamps that should produce
10 percent to 30 percent more light while
using less energy. Whereas mercury vapor
lights tend to dim with extended use, Frost
estimated that the new sodium lights will
maintain their level of brightness for five or
six years.
"Here we're saving money and providing
better services. It's a win-win situation," said
Frost.
Athletics facilities
Maples Pavilion used to have 92 fixtures
each using 468 watts of electricity at all hours
of the day, said Frost.
The facility now has an electronically bal
lasted compact fluorescent system that oper
ates on three different levels of brightness.
There is a basic level of light available when
the facility is used for general use. "We can
then power up to a higher level of light for
varsity practice and then increase the light
even more for gametime to have high-quality
light for cameras," said Frost.
These changes mean that Maples now uses
55 percent less energy than it did prior to the
renovations, he said.
The deGuerre pool heating system now
uses 10 percent to 20 percent less energy due
to a smarter computer system installed this
summer. The new computer is able to regu
late the steam levels used to heat the pool
more precisely. By saving 5 percent to 20 per
cent in the cost of steam heat each month,
Frost estimates that the new technology will
pay for itself within a year of installation.
Given an adequate solar load, 41 solar
panels heat water for deGuerre locker rooms
showers and sinks during the peak sunlight
hours of 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The solar panels
have recently been repaired after being inop
erational since 1991.
At Roble Gym's basketball court, energy-sav
ing compact fluorescents have been installed.
Rather than staying on all day, the lights only go
on when three infrared sensors detect motion.
Frost estimated that these changes have
reduced Roble's enercv load bv 60 percent.
