'Students have the potential to
greatly reduce their energy con
sumption," said David Frost, the
energy management coordinator
for Housing and Dining Services.
We're not trying to promote sacri
fice; we're trying to get people to
use energy in a more intelligent
way."
He suggested the following tips:
• Turn off all lights when you
leave your room, the bathroom or
your dorm's kitchenette.
• Compact fluorescents are the
most energy-efficient bulbs avail
able. Use them for your desk lights
and bedside lamps. While compact
fluorescents are more expensive
than halogens or incandescent
bulbs, they last about 10,000 hours.
One bulb should last throughout
your entire Stanford career.
Halogens are not permitted in
dorm rooms because they are a seri
ous fire hazard.
• If you have a new computer or
are about to buy one, look for the
energy saver option on your control
panel. You can set the controls so
that if you don't touch your mouse
or keyboard for 15 minutes, your
computer's energy use will drop to
zero.
• Use kitchenette refrigerators in
your dorm's kitchenette instead of
a private fridge.
• If you have a printer, turn it on
only when you are printing.
