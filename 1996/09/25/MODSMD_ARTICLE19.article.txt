# 3-D imaging device invented

Video imaging in three dimensions has always had
drawbacks — whether it required the viewer to wear
a pair of paper glasses or it could only be seen from
one angle
But a new technology' developed by a Stanford
graduate student solves many of those problems,
offering a practical machine that may pave the way
for more widespread use of 3-D imaging.
Elizabeth Downing, who is completing her doctor
al thesis in mechanical engineering, has designed
technology that she says "allows you to draw 3-D
images in real spatial coordinates.
"The objects that you draw can be viewed from any
angle," she said. "There's no glasses. There's no head
gear. There are no restrictions on the angle."
No one else has been able to create a device that
allows for so much freedom. "It is the only technology
right now that offers unobstructed viewing by multi
ple people simultaneously with none of these other
limitations," Downing said.
Downing originally had the idea for her video dis
play in 1988 but only now has found the funding to
create a usable model.
Her design utilizes a cube of fluorescent glass that
displays 3-D images created by lasers, scanners and
other equipment.
Numerous groups will be able to make use of the
new technology . Downing said. It could be used in
medical imaging, air traffic control and scientific and
military visualizations, among other applications.
"It will be useful for things like CAT scans and
ultrasounds, where doctors have very sophisticated
machines but are still looking at limagesl in two
dimensional form," she said.
Downing initially began work on her concept —
which she said just came to her one day - while work
ing in Santa (Mara The company she was working for,
SMC, gave her money to develop a prototype, but the
first attempt "failed miserably," she said.

Eventually, Downing was able to tie in her experi
mentation with work for her doctoral thesis. While
she was working on her master's degree, also from
Stanford, she proposed the idea to a professor hut was
unable to secure funding.
After finishing her first Stanford degree, she took
at job at the Stanford Linear Accelerator ('enter \n hile
taking classes for her doctorate. "I submitted propos
als to several different organizations and finally got
one funded by the Navy," Downing said.
Downing received $350,000, more than half of
which she said went to overhead costs. With that
money, however, she was able to make up for her first
failure.
Downing first set up a machine in Materials Sci
ence Engineering Prof. Robert Feigelson's lab in the
McCullough Building. Using that machine, she was
able to determine which materials would work.
She explained that she tried working with both
crystals and glasses, eventually finding that glasses —
such as the fluorescent kind finally settled on —
would be more successful.
The machine did work using crystal, but "I wanted
to work in glasses instead," Downing said.
When glass had been tested and the machine had
been built, Downing set to work optimizing the mate
rials involved. Hut the problem of size remained.
The machine, using huge lasers, sat on a 4-foot-by
8-foot optical table — too big to be practical.
Downing contacted a Laser diode company, SDL,
which had surplus diodes made in sizes that could not
be sold commercially. Using those, she said, the oper
ation could fit on a table only 1 foot square.
"At this point, it became practical." she said.
Downing then developed the technology further
until she was able to create reds, blues and greens
within her glass cube
The project has now moved into its marketing
phase. Downing helped create a company to develop
the technology further, 3-D Technology laboratories.
She has been in contact with several individuals and
companies interested in the machine.
