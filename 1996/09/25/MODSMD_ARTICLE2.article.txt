## KZSU raising $25,000 to make up for special-fee loss 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
After losing its $94,252 special-fee re
quest last spring, KZSU is struggling to
fmd ways to remain on the air.
The campus radio station was one of 11
student groups that lost its special fee last
year when it applied to both the graduate
and undergraduate populations. KZSU's
special-fee request — which was the third
largest on the ballot — failed to acquire the
necessary 15 percent of the student body's
"yes" votes, missing the minimum by only
80 ballots.
This year marks the first time in the
station's history that it has lost this fund
ing.
Because KZSU is a non-commercial

radio station, it cannot raise money
through advertisements. In the past, the
station has relied primarily on special-fee
money for survival.
Last spring, station managers success
fully petitioned the ASSU to use their re
serve fund of $21,500 to operate this year.
This fund has accumulated over time as
part of the ASSU's refund buffer policy.
In addition to this money, managers
plan to raise $25,000 through underwrit
ing and gifts from local businesses and in
dividuals this year, station personnel said.
Underwriters receive on-air acknowledg
ment. Unlike actually selling ad time, how
ever, selling underwriting is permitted for
non-commercial stations.
KZSU has created an underwriting de
partment, which is headed by radio an

nouncer Christine Doherty. Everyone
working at the station works on a volun
teer basis, with the exception of one paid
part time engineer.
Fund-raising already has paid off.
"We were able to raise approximately
$4,000 this summer," said senior Sean
Kennedy, KZSU's general manager. "We
are currently ahead of our goal."
The station also has cut its budget sig
nificantly. "Once we learned that we had
lost the special fee, we cut the budget dras
tically," Kennedy said.
The station's "bare-bones budget"was
achieved by making cuts big and small,
from eliminating $10,000 from the news
department to saving $500 by converting
from voice mail systems to answer
ing machines.
The struggle for funding, howev
er, has not reduced KZSU's ser
vices, according to Program Direc
tor Mike Howes. KZSU continues
to broadcast 24 hours a day, seven
days a week.
"Although we have not cut any
services, we have had to cut back
and concentrate on just paying our
bills," Howes said. "The overhead
involved (with running KZSU) is
monstrous."
Rather than cutting services to
the Stanford campus, KZSU in
tends to increase its visibility to stu
dent, Kennedy added.

"If we expand, we have a better
chance of having student support,"
said Kennedy. As part of this expan
sion, KZSU plans to put on a con
cert series and broadcast from
White Plaza this year.
The radio station also hopes to
become more connected to other
student groups. "KZSU can broad
cast events on campus," Kennedy
said. "This is a resource which can
be used by student groups."
KZSU intends to remain opera
tional this year.
"I am uncertain as to our
chances of survival this year," said
Howes. "I would say its 50-50 at
this point."
Kennedy said he is optimistic.
"Getting the special fee is always
a worry," Kenntxly said. "It is ill
ways looming, but its not dragging
us down. We're still KZSU."
