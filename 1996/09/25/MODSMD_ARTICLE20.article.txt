## Stanford football seeks bowl berth in fierce Pac-10 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
In the wake of its biggest victory in recent years,
the Pacific 10 Conference prepares to officially open
league action, and the conference looks a whole lot
more competitive thanks to Arizona State. Last
weekend's upset shutout of Nebraska not only makes
the Sun Devils look good in their run for the roses but
gives the entire conference a much-needed boost of
confidence after years of a bad reputation. Expect a
lot of shuffling throughout the season between teams
4-8, making the seemingly unimportant contests cru
cial for bowl consideration.
Here's a look at each squad, in predicted order of
finish.
1. Arizona State
There was no doubt about the Sun Devil offense
coming into this season. With senior Jake Plummer,
ASU's all-time leading pat.-er, calling the plays and
senior wideout Keith Poole catching the passes, the
only question for the Sun Devils was its defense.
ASU (3-0 overall, 1-0 Pac-10) quickly answered
that question with a 19-0 shutout over Nebraska last
Saturday, arguably the most explosive offense in the
nation. In fact, the Sun Devils are currently No. 1 in
the conference in total defense, yielding just 240
yards per game. After giving up 42 points in its open
er to Washington, ASU has allowed just seven total
points in its last two games.
Defensive end Derrick Rogers has spent the non
conference schedule making a name for himself, lead
ing the league in tackles for loss and ranking second
in quarterback sacks.
Rogers and the Sun Devils, undefeated after three
games for the first time since 1982, also have sched
uling in their favor. ASU has already disposed of
Washington in a last-second thriller, and its two
toughest remaining opponents, USC and Oregon,
both have to venture to the desert. After replacing the
goalposts, Sun Devil Stadium will be a hostile envi
ronment.
2. USC
After ASU's shocker in Tempe, the Trojans, pre
season favorites to return to the Rose Bowl, sudden
ly find themselves heavy underdogs to the Sun Dev
ils. The Trojans (3-1, 1-0) have been impressive at
times this season, but have yet to be impressive when
it counts. Quarterback Brad Otton and company
posted 55 points against Illinois and 46 against Ore
gon State but could muster only seven against a qual
ity opponent, Penn State. The Trojans rank only
sixth in the conference in scoring but should improve

when their delinquent backfield gets back into action.
Replacing Keyshawn Johnson as Otton's favorite
target has been Chris Miller, who leads the confer
ence in receiving yardage with 96 yards per game.
John Robinson's defense has been solid, giving up
just 13.3 points per game. Defensive end Darrell Rus
sell is the man at the Coliseum, second in the Pac-10
in quaterback sacks and second in tackles for loss.
Scheduling may be the downfall for USC in its run
for the roses. The aforementioned meeting in Tempe
leads the way and a late-season rendezvous with
UCLA, as past evidence shows, is by no means a gim
mie.
3. Washington
Suddenly, a last-second loss to the sixth-ranked
Sun Devils in Tempe doesn't look so bad. Add an im
pressive performance at home against Arizona last
weekend, and the Huskies look like they are in good
shape for at least making some noise in the Rose Bowl
race. Washington (2-1,1-1) is virtually unbeatable at
home, winning 35 of its last 40 at Husky Stadium,
and its toughest road game is against USC, a game
late enough in the season to have Rose Bowl implica
tions.
The Huskies have been relying heavily on their
ground game, and Corey Dillon (81.0 yards per game)
and Rashaan Sheehee (78.3 yards per game) have
been up to the challenge, ranking fourth and fifth in
the conference in rushing, respectively.
John Fiala leads the defense and is second in the
league in tackles, followed closely by linebacker Ink
Aleaga, who is tied for eighth.
In order to pull of a top-three finish in the confer
ence, Washington needs to solve its quarterback con
troversy. After last week's 311-yard, three-touch
down performance and a nearly miraculous come
back against ASU, the Huskies need to put Brock
Huard on the field and let him run the offense.
4. UCLA
With a new head coach and the graduation of its
top running back, many counted the Bruins out. But
with an impressive showing early against then-No. 2
Tennessee, UCLA may be better than many thought.
The Bruins offense looks solid, replacing Karim
Abdul-Jabbar with two dangerous runners in Skip
Hicks (4.9 yards per carry) and Durell Price (5.9
yards per carry). Both the running and passing game
are averaging over 200 yards a game. The defense has
been holding as well, ranking sixth in the nation in
rushing defense at just 57 yards per game.
The Bruins most likely will play the role of spoiler
somewhere in the conference race. Home games
against Arizona State and, as always, against USC

are possible upset bids.
5. Stanford
With five first-time starters on offense, three of
them on the line, it is not difficult to see why the
Cardinal offense has struggled. Averaging just
11.7 points per game after a shutout at Wisconsin,
Stanford (1-2) is dead last in the conference in
scoring.
But the Cardinal defense is alive and well, at the
top of the league in points allowed, only 11 per
game. Stanford puts three of its defenders in the
top eight in tackles, junior inside linebackers Chris
Draft (third) and Jon Haskins (fourth) and senior
strong safety Eliel Swinton (eighth). Despite the
offense's woes, Stanford held the Badgers, who
had previously averaged 300.5 yards per game
rushing and boasted the country's biggest offen

sive line, to just 101 yards on the ground.
Both staff and players believe it is just a matter
of time before redshirt freshman Chad Hutchinson
and the offense find their rhythm and begin to put
points on the board. Gettingjunior Jon Ritchie and
seni r Greg Cornelia back from injury at the full
back position will help rejuvenate a running game
that features two of the league's best runners in ju
nior Anthony Bookman and senior Mike Mitchell
If the Cardinal rediscovers its ground attack and
Hutchinson and the passing game jell at the right
time, big things could be in store for the Cardinal.
