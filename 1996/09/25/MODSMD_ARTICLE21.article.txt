# Go speed racer!
## Cycling takes second at Track Nationals 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
The Stanford cycling team raced to a sec
ond-place finish at the Collegiate Track Na
tionals Sept. 5-8. The annual event took place
in Seattle over a four-day period, and in that
time the Cardinal racked up a total of 762
points to place just 7.5 points behind Washing
ton.
The No. 2 position that the team landed was
an expected finish; however, the closeness of
the point differential between the Card and the
usually dominating Huskies was a surprising
success.
Stanford's overall total was almost 100
points better than third-place Marian College,
and from that position the point levels rapidly
deteriorated. Air Force placed fourth but only
tallied 245 points in the team omnium.
Coach Art Walker said the vast difference in
the point totals from third place down resulted
mostly from the lack of members in a team's

lineup. Certain team competitions, such as the
Italian pursuit and the men's and women's
Olympic sprint require a minimum number of
cyclists.
Stanford's ability to field a full team in each
event led to a greater accumulation of points
throughout the competition and was a big
boost for the Cardinal score.
An even bigger jolt to the squad's success
was the performance of the women's team, and
more specifically graduate student Megan
Troxell. Troxell won both the women's individ
ual pursuit and the women's 14x4 points race.
She finished the individual competition fourth
with 60 points, just four behind winner
Heather Thompson of Las Pasitas.
Washington's Laura and Jennie Heed fin
ished second and third with point totals of 63
and 61 respectively to help carry the Huskies
to the national title.
Troxell is fairly new to track competition.
She began training for the track competition in
July 1995 and placed third in last year's indi

vidual pursuit after just two months training.
"[Troxelll was really psyched about [placing
third in 1995] and made it one of her goals to do
what was necessary to win the individual pur
suit [this year]," Walker said. "She adjusted
her workouts and had the discipline that was
required to carry out [her goals]."
The victory was made even sweeter by the
fact that Troxell bumped the two-time defend
ing champ Laura Reed in that event. According
to Walker, Troxell won this year's pursuit in
typical "Megan style."
Troxell's habit is to maintain an even pace
throughout the race and then turn on the af
terburners in the end. This method often gives
the appearance that Troxell makes an incredi
ble comeback at the end of the race and per
haps adds to her likability.
Walker said everyone, including some of
Reed's own teammates, seemed to be pulling
for Troxell in the final heat of the competition.
In the first round Troxell had
saved a little energy and finished
0.8 seconds behind Reed.
Troxell "didn't beat [Reedl in
the first ride but kept it close to save
it for the second ride," Walker said.
"She put the scare in (Reed] and
knew that she could ride faster."
Walker also said Troxell
changed her wardrobe for the final
race and donned a new rubber suit
for the final. Whatever the trick, it
worked and Troxell crossed the
finish line 1.8 seconds ahead of
Reed for first place.
On the men's side, graduate
student Peter Armitage was the
surprise success for the Cardinal.
Walker said Armitage is one of the
top amateur road racers in the

country. Armitage cut his summer
road racing season short in order
to compete in the track champi
onships, but the dynamics be
tween road and track racing are so
different that Walker did not ex
pect such a performance from Ar
mitage.
Armitage "just rode great, sur
prisingly well," Walker said. "Track
discipline is so different from the
road, and he got here just in time to
have one workout (before the com
petition]. He was our best cyclist.
He really raged in the Points Race."
Armitage raged all the way to a
seventh-place finish. Graduate
student David Bailey tied for third
and graduate student Takeshi Doi
placed 10th. These three also
topped the final point count. Doi
finished eighth with 62, and Ar
mitage and Bailey were ninth and
10th with 60 and 59 points, re
spectively.
