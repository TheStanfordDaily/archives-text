# What if Stanford overtook the NFL
## 
### 
OK, you're back on the
Farm for another year of
stimulating schoolwork,
extracurricular activities, nation
al championship-caliber sports

and, of course, my hilarious and
always insightful sports
columns.
And, unless you're a fresh
man, you will also have to get
used to yet another year of ever
changing University guidelines;
ever-present, unfinished con
struction and the always-frus
trating University administra
tive decisions that just don't
make any sense.
What many of you are un
aware of, though, is that Stan
ford will make history next year
by becoming the first University
administration to take over a na
tional sports league — the Na
tional Football League. That's
right, Paul Tagliabue and Co. are
stepping aside to let Stanford
"clean up" the NFL. Here's some
of what you'll see in '97.
Headed by the Office of Stu
dent Affairs, the 1997 season will
mark a return to the No Fun
League policies of a few years ago.
The new policies will come com
plete with penalties for any cele
brations; only this time, however,
according to the L T niversity's new
party-planning guidelines, there
will be five different levels of cele
brations, each earning its own
punishment, that must be recog
nized by the referees.
The Office of Student Affairs
will also mandate that all teams
must use the no-huddle offense
because 11 guys hanging out to
gether could be considered a fra
ternity — and we all know how
much Stanford loves fraternities.
Next season will also ring in
the new era of the no-time-limit
instant replay. Humor has it that
the same people who promised us
Taco Bell in Tresidder Union, ID
cards that can be used to order
pizza and cable TV l west campus
only) are heading up the instant
replav committee Their philoso

phy: We 11 look at the same thing
over and over again, even if it
takes more than two years.
The University administra
tion will also force every team in
the league to wear crimson-col
ored uniforms — just one more
way to make everyone think that
they're from Harvard.
There will be many changes to
the NFL stadiums in 1997 as
well. First off, all stadiums will be
designed to seat 80,000 people,
but in line with University con
struction initiatives, there will
only be 23 parking spaces per sta
dium. And in stadiums which are
located within 6,000 miles of any
tiger salamanders, there will only
be room for 11 spaces.
Secondly, SUNet will install
television sets at concession
stands, but only those on the east
sides of the stadiums. For some
reason SUNet and the University
feel that the league would be
served best by equipping only half
of the stadium with television
sets. I mean, who cares if the west
side of campus — 1 mean stadium
— doesn't get basic sen-ices?
Also, in accordance with this
year's brilliant residential com
puting scheme, there will bo no
pay phones in or around the sta
dium. Instead, fans will need to
purchase $100 cellular phones if
they want to make any calls. But
before they can call, a stadium
cellular consultant must first ac
tivate each person's phone indi
vidually, for a fee of $45.
Concession stands around the
league will see changes next year,
too, thanks to University Dining
Sen-ices. Hot dogs will be a mere
$13, while drinks will average a
measly $10. In a neat dining-ser
vice twist, those who choose not
to spend all of their money on
food will have to buy cases of
Snapple and Diet Coke before
they leave the stadium. Other
wise, each person will be robbed
by Dining Service managers
upon exiting the park
And, of course, in am effort to
make the league completely dry,
no beer will be sened in any of
the stadiums. Anybody, especial
ly minors, caught dnnking at any
NFL function will be immediate
ly removed from the stadium and
subsequently shot.
Additionally, as all University
ofTices seem to operate, conces
sion stands will be closed during
