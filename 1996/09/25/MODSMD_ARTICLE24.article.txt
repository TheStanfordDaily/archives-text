# Study finds more graduates get jobs
##

Contrary to the downsizing image of the
19905, more entry-level positions are becoming
available nationwide and many are paying bet
ter than in the past, a national study has found.
Furthermore, figures from the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center show that recent
Stanford graduates have fared even better than
most graduates nationally.
Seventy-eight percent of the career place
ment offices surveyed by the National Associa
tion of Colleges and Employers reported an in
crease in college graduate hiring in 1996 com
pared to 1995, 19 percent reported no change
and only 3 percent reported a decrease in hiring.
The survey also stated that engineering,
computer science and computer-related majors
fared quite well in receiving high starting
salaries.

Nationally, chemical engineers were the
highest paid, with an average starting salary of
$41,443, a 3.9 percent increase from last year.
In comparison, a graduating senior in Stan
ford's Chemical Engineering Department
earned an average starting salary of $44,500, ac
cording to the CPPC. Other engineering and
computer science degrees come in close behind.
While downsizing may plague the nation,
Stanford students have less to worry about than
most.
"A lot of employers may be hiring fewer peo
ple, but they may be focusing on two or three
schools instead of 20 or 30. And Stanford is one
of those," said Heather McCausland, program
coordinator for recruiting at the CPPC.
Stanford computer science and engineering
majors also are in high demand because of Stan
ford's location in Silicon Valley.
However, these high salaries should come as
no surprise, according to Lucky Gutierrez, stu-

dent affairs specialist at the CPPC. Stanford's
starting salaries are typically higher than the
national average, he said.
All of these positive figures may be attributed
to the nationwide increase in the number of re
cruiters who interview students or post job no
tices on campuses. This year, 68 percent of the
schools reported that more recruiters had visit
ed their campuses than in 1995, while only 17
percent reported that fewer had come.
At Stanford, this year may be just as busy for
recruiters, if not busier. The on-campus inter
view rooms offered by the CPPC for this fall
filled up in June. In years past, they have only
been booked a month or so in advance, McCaus
land said.
"I think there's going to be a lot more job of
fers," she added.
CPPC'sjob fair, slated for Oct. 11, has already
filled up. Twenty-five percent of the employers
requesting space had to be turned away.
