### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
Signing a pledge for money to
establish a full-time professorship
of Korean studies, University
President Gerhard Casper said
last night the funds would broad
en scholarship in that area.
Joungwon Kim of the Korea
Foundation and Jae-Hyun Hyun,
chair of the Tong Yang Group and
president of the Korea Stanford
Alumni Association, joined Casper
at the Hoover House last night to
seal the $3 million endowment in
ceremony.
The Korea Foundation, the
Tong Yang Group and the Korea
Stanford Alumni Association each
pledged $1 million to the Universi
ty. Using the endowment, Stan
ford officials also plan to recruit a
social scientist who focuses on Ko
rean contemporary policy issues.
The Korean studies chair will
expand Stanford's Asian curricu
lum, which is presently strongest
in Japanese and Chinese studies.
While the efforts of the Korean
Studies Committee formed in
1987 have led to visiting Korean
scholars, the committee's long
term goal was to get a permanent
professorship.
Pointing to the historical
events since World War 11, Casper
said, "Korea has received more at
tention than any other country for
many reasons."
After noting the rapid pace of
change in South Korea since the
Korean War, he said he wondered
what opportunities and problems
the uncertain relationship be

tween North and South Korea
would bring.
"The Korean studies program
will give students the opportunity
to be closely involved in the in
creasing interaction with the
Asia / Pacific Area," Casper said.
According to Hyun, other de
veloping countries are eager to
learn from South Korea's unique

experience in progressing from
being the war-torn country it was
in the 1950s to having more than a
$10,000 per capita income today.
"The Korean studies program
goes beyond Korea to the Pacific
Rim," Hyun said. "All the coun
tries in Asia are interdependent.
By studying Korea, [knowledge]
can be adapted and modified to

other countries. Students will
have the opportunity to learn
about the Pacific Rim. an area
which is becoming one great mar
ket."

fered an optimistic view of the pro
gram at the University.
"With the brains and energy [of
the students] under the leadership
of Casper," he said, "the Korean
studies program will develop a
strong and bright future here."
According to Kim, the Korea
Foundation establishes cultural ex

change abroad to increase under
standing. "Although Korea has
5,000 years of history, our culture
hasn't been promoted enough," he
said.
In view of the University's
"unique vantage point to the Pacif
ic Rim," Ilyun added, "there is no
place more appropriate to have a
Korean studies program than Stan
ford."
The University will also seek an
additional $2 million in funds to
support other related Korean pro
grams.
