# Pollo's construction begins in Tresidder
## Tentative opening date is Nov. 9 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Construction on Folio's restaurant has
begun in Tresidder Union, University offi
cials confirmed yesterday.
Leonie Batkin, a representative of Stan
ford Management Company which over
sees Tresidder, confirmed that the restau
rant chain received its construction permit
last Friday and started building on the
same day. When plans for the eaten/ were
originally announced last spring, Dean of
Students Marc Wais said it would be open
for business by the start of this quarter.
Polio's is now targeting a tentative
opening date of Nov. 9, Wais said yester
day.
"Folio's should have a 45-day build-out
and then a three- to six-day period for them
to actually get the business operations
going," Wais explained. Delays have been
attributed to a slow permit-approval

process on the part of Santa Clara County,
which has jurisdiction over Stanford prop
erty. Although Folio's received a permit to
demolish its site, it was not until last Fri
day that it received the permit to start con
struction, he said
The restaurant will be located on the
first floor of Tresidder in a space previous
ly occupied by Baywash Cleaners, the Car
dinal Collection and ASSU Lecture Notes.
In its completed form, Folio's should ac
commodate about 100 customers and have
additional outdoor seating.
Josh Klein, a project manager for
Polio's, said the initial work on the site has
gone according to plan, although Stanford
Management Company may have some
"different ideas" concerning construction.
Klein would not elaborate on these possible
changes.
After Polio's opens in November, a for-
mal grand openingcelebration is
planned, Wais said. He added
that there will be a period of a
few days between opening day
and the celebration for Polio's to
work out any problems it may
encounter. This event marks
the first time that Polio's will be
running an operation on a col
lege campus.
In addition, Wais said Stan
ford Hairstyling, a University
fixture for nearly 70 years, is
expected to sign a lease today
to relocate its operation to an
other position on the first floor
of Tresidder. The hairstylist
will orient its business more
toward student needs, Wais
said.
Occupying the barber shop's
current position will hopefully
be a Juice Club-type establish
ment, Wais said. Ten businesses
have submitted proposals to
move into Tresidder; four will
be given the opportunity to
offer proposals to the Universi
ty during a meeting planned for
Oct. 2.

"We're hoping to sign a lease
by the end of October," ex
plained Wais, who added that
"quality, presentation and
price" are the three main factors
contributing to the University's

final decision.
The new and improved
Tresidder should become "a hub
of campus activity," he said.
Several changes have already
been made to Tresidder over the

summer. New lighting and seat
ing arrangements have been
added to Tresidder's main cafe
teria on the first floor. Wais has
said that the University also
plans to install new carpeting.
