# Financial aid glitch keeps students from paying
## Lines move quickly, students defer bills 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
Students breezed through the lines at
Tresidder Union this week to pay their au
tumn quarter bills. The usual controlled
chaos and celebrated mile-long loan-dis
bursement line were absent from the quar
terly gathering of eager checkbook-holding
students.
Problems with a new computer system in
the Financial Aids Office prevented many
students from applying for their loans on
time. Therefore, according to Bursar Jon Er
ickson, many students simply couldn't pay
their bills because their loan checks weren't
ready.
Students working at collection and distri
bution tables said the scene was vastly differ
ent from most quarters.
"There have been extremely few people,"
said junior Derek Norman, a Bursar's Office

employee working the "No
bill" line. "It's kind of sur
prising."
Senior Tony Homan, a
loan collections assistant in
the Tresidder loan dis
bursement section, agreed.
"It's been very slow," he
said. "You could call the
lines nonexistent."

Erickson said most students are choosing
to defer payments.
"There has been a significantly higher
number of deferments because loans are not
available," Erickson said "That m itself is a
minor extra burden for us at this point. It
takes longer to process a deferment than just
a regular payment."
Students who defer their loans will have
to go to the Bursar's Office later this quarter
