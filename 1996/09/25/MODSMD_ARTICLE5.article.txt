# Financial aid glitch keeps students from paying
## Lines move quickly, students defer bills 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
Students breezed through the lines at
Tresidder Union this week to pay their au
tumn quarter bills. The usual controlled
chaos and celebrated mile-long loan-dis
bursement line were absent from the quar
terly gathering of eager checkbook-holding
students.
Problems with a new computer system in
the Financial Aids Office prevented many
students from applying for their loans on
time. Therefore, according to Bursar Jon Er
ickson, many students simply couldn't pay
their bills because their loan checks weren't
ready.
Students working at collection and distri
bution tables said the scene was vastly differ
ent from most quarters.
"There have been extremely few people,"
said junior Derek Norman, a Bursar's Office

employee working the "No
bill" line. "It's kind of sur
prising."
Senior Tony Homan, a
loan collections assistant in
the Tresidder loan dis
bursement section, agreed.
"It's been very slow," he
said. "You could call the
lines nonexistent."

Erickson said most students are choosing
to defer payments.
"There has been a significantly higher
number of deferments because loans are not
available," Erickson said "That m itself is a
minor extra burden for us at this point. It
takes longer to process a deferment than just
a regular payment."
Students who defer their loans will have
to go to the Bursar's Office later this quarter

to pick up their loan checks once
they have arrived and pay the re
maining balance on their bills.
"It's just a hassle. I wish the sys
tem would run a bit more smoothly
so I can concentrate on other
things," said junior Robert Lucero
while he filled out a deferment loan
application. "But I think it'll be re
solved eventually."
Erickson expects an increase in
the Bursar's Office work load this
quarter as students pick up their
loans and pay off their bills.
He said he hopes that loans come
early in the quarter because of
"cash-flow issues" for the Universi
ty.
"It's not going to break the Uni
versity," said Erickson. "But there
is some lost revenue."
Although there were no lines

Tresidder, there have been many at
the Financial Aids Office. The office
was very crowded on Monday.
"The lines were down the hall
way," said junior Melinda Johnson,
a student having problems with her
late financial aid package.
According to Director of Stu
dent Awards Cynthia Rife, the lines
were filled with students who had a
lot of routine questions that had
nothing to do with the office's delay.
"I don't think it seems like a ter
ribly abnormal year," Rife said.
"There were more students than
usual asking about the status of
their packages and deferments. But
it was not as bad as I had feared that
it might be."
Rife credited students for mak
ing the process work.
"People seemed to be very un
derstanding," she said. "Things are
going much better than we have
dreamed largely because the stu
dents are understanding, patient
and calm."
