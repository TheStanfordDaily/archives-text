# Stanford leads list of best workplaces
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
Long noted as one of the na
tion's leading universities, Stan
ford is gaining a reputation of
another sort — as a leading place
to work.
An October special issue of
Working Mother magazine
ranks Stanford among the 100
best companies for working
mothers. The University is the
first institution of higher learn
ing to be recognized in the annu
al survey.
Stanford was invited to apply
for recognition after the maga
zine's survey coordinator heard
Kathleen Sullivan, director of
Stanford's Work Life family ser
vices center, deliver a speech in
San Francisco on the Universi
ty's family programs. This year
is the first time the University
has applied.
Stanford, elected from more
than 500 applicants, joined such
companies as IBM and Xerox be
cause of its high number of se
nior female employees and its
numerous family friendly pro
grams.
"Stanford has an unusual
number of women in its top ad
ministrative positions," Sullivan
said.
Working Mother noted that
the provost, chief financial offi
cer, two of the three University
vice presidents and 56 percent of
all professors are women.
The maerazine also commend-

Ed Stanford for its programs al
lowing employees to work flexi
ble schedules, its practice of
matching employee contribu
tions to savings plans and its
full-time staff devoted to family
needs.
"Most impressive this year
was its establishment of a Work-
Life Center," the article said.
Some of the services offered are
child- and elder-care referral and
counseling on choosing and im
plementing flexible work op
tions.
The Work Life Center is a re
birth of the Child and Family
Services Department within the
Office of Personnel Manage
ment.
The center coordinates Uni
versity programs and services
designed to alleviate tensions be
tween employees' professional
and personal lives.
"We would like to be a first
stop for people in meeting some
of the needs that can add pres
sure and stress in the busy lives
that we all experience," Sullivan
said.
The center also provides in
formation and workshops on
voter registration, passport re
newal, money management and
other general interest topics. It
maintains a large library of ma
terials on balancing work, stud
ies and personal life.
The Work Life Center's tele
phone number is 723-2660. Sul
livan can be contacted by e-mail
