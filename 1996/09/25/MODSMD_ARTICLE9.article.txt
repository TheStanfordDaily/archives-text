Nuclear arms treaty signed
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The Unit
ed States and the world's major nuclear
powers overrode the objections of India
yesterday and signed a treaty to end all
testing and development of nuclear
weapons.
President Clinton signed the treaty
with the same pen President John F.
Kennedy used to sign the 1963 Limited
Test Ban Treaty. After a 10-minute
address to the General Assembly, Clinton
went to New Jersey to campaign for re
election.
India, one of the countries that must
sign the treaty for it to become law,
refused to endorse the pact because it does
not require nuclear powers to scrap
weapons.
Nevertheless, supporters believe the
treaty as signed will make it difficult for
any country to conduct nuclear test explo
sions in defiance of international opinion.
The 1963 treaty prohibited nuclear test

explosions in the atmosphere, in space and
underwater but permitted them under
ground. The 1974 Threshold Test Ban
Treaty set a size limit on underground test
explosions, but the new treaty bans all test
explosions, including underground blasts.
By signing the treaty, Clinton promised
to create a "better, safer world," one that
"will help to prevent the nuclear powers
from developing more advanced and more
dangerous weapons.
Is a kiss just a kiss?
LEXINGTON, N.C. (AP) - A 6-year
old boy who kissed a girl on the cheek was
suspended last week on the grounds of sex
ual harassment.
Jackie Prevette said the school overre
acted to an innocent peck on the cheek by
banishing her son, Johnathan, to a room
apart from his classmates. Johnathan said
that the girl asked him to kiss her and that
he was expressing friendship, according to
his mother.
