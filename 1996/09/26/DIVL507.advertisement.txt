All registered students are eligible to apply for a whole or partial refund of
funding to student organizations. Groups receiving funding from the ASSU
fee are provided with a list of the ID numbers of all students who request a
refund from them, and are allowed to deny their serv ices to those students.
This policy is known to be enforced by ASSU Legal Counseling, which
will deny service, and by the ASSU Speakers Bureau, which will charge an
entrance fee to students who requested a refund. Other groups are consider
ing enforcing this right.
Refund requests may be made at any time. However, the> will onh affect
the current quarter if submitted before the third Friday of the quarter. Once
a request has been submitted, it will continue to be applied for the remain
der of the academic year. To alter your fee refund request, simply till out
the refund form again before the deadline.
Please also be aware that by taking a refund, you are indicating that you do
not wish to support that group and its activities, and that in fairness to other
students who do support the group, you should not take advantage of its
services.
Deadline to request a refund of your Autumn quarter fee:
Friday, October 11 at 5:00 PM.
To request your refund, you will need to use a computer on the Stanford
network. Using a World Wide Web browser (e.g. Netscape or lynx), open:
httn://assu.stanford.edu/
and select "Fee Refund." Valid Spring quarter refund requests will be
credited to your University Bill or mailed to your address listed with Axess.
