political awareness on campus and in East Palo Alto. SIG has existed for close to 35 years, and is housed on
the first floor of the Haas Center for Community Service. With a total of 11 different committees. SIG provide 1
a variety of services to the Stanford community. There are three main focuses:
1. CAMPUS POLITICAL AWARENESS AND EDUCATION
This segment of SIG is dedicated to bringing prominent policy related speakers to campus, organizing political
debates, producing newsletters on current issues, running voter registration drives, sponsoring small, informal
workshops with policy experts, and assisting with the Public Policy 50 class.
2. INTERNSHIP RESOURCES/FELLOWSHIPS
SIG maintains a database of internship information from government offices and agencies in Washington. DC.
Sacramento, and throughout all 50 states. Updated by the resources committees annually, our files serve as the
largest policy-related internship resource on campus. Because most internships are unpaid, SIG also offers a
Washington. DC. Sacramento, and International fellowship program in which students apply for highly
substantive internships that we have set up and are given a stipend by SIG. The fellowships committees handle
the entire solicitation and student application process.
3. COMMUNITY SERVICE IN EAST PALO ALTO
SIG has a special program for Hast Palo Alto schools that promotes leadership, civic responsibility, and politica
awareness by assisting with student council elections and projects and bringing local politicians into the school*
to meet with students. Since this is an election year, we are hoping to run a mock presidential election for the
schools as well.
If you have any questions, please contact the SIG Office at 3 4151 or Lind\ Eichenbaum at lindylouif leland
