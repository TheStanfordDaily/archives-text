Ahh, classifieds. Frivolous and vapid? Yes. Some
thing to read while you eat your oatmeal, pretend to lis
ten to your Chinese Lit. professor or ponder your exis
tential pain? Yes as well. And they don't require the ef
fort of reading, say, a real article about real things that
have actually happened and might even affect you. So
take advantage of this new section in Intermission —
tell your friends and enemies what you really think
without having to face the consequences, ponder other
people's inside jokes and grapple with the seamy un
derbelly of a campus where it only seems like nothing
happens.
To drop off your very own free classified, come by
The Daily (Storke Publications Building, across from
Terman) and leave a slip of paper in the cardboard box
on the shelf in front of your face when you walk in the
Intermission cubicle. And don't even think of stealing
our CDs — you're being watched, Bub.
