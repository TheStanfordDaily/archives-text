# Terman Fellows named
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
Six young faculty members in
science and engineering were
named 1996-97 Frederick E. Ter
man Fellows this week.
As part of the award, the recip
ients will receive unrestricted
funds of up to $100,000 annually
for the next three years.
Those awarded include Asst.
Computer Science Prof. Mary
Baker, Asst. Dermatology Prof.
G. Scott Herron, Asst. Neurology
Prof. Thomas Rando, Asst. Math
Prof. Ben Andrews, Asst. Physics
Prof. Mark Kasevich and Asst. Bi
ology Prof. Michael Simon.
According to Assoc. Provost
Ann Fletcher, the selections were
made by the deans of the respec
tive schools and were based on
nominations from department
chairs.
The School of Humanities and
Sciences and the School of Engi
neering make selections every
year for the honor, while the
School of Earth Sciences and the
School of Medicine participate in
the program on a rotating basis.
Rebecca Smith, associate di
rector in the Office of Develop
ment, said the fellowship is ear
marked for junior faculty mem
bers who are "promising scien
tists and engineers."
The Terman Fellows Program
began in spring 1994 with a $25
million contribution from
William Hewlett and the late
David Packard. Stanford alumni
and pioneers of the computer in
dustry, Hewlett and Packard
have a long history of supporting
the University and its faculty.
Smith said the Terman Fel
lows Program is now in an estab-
lished and "steady state." Recipi
ents of the first set of awards cur
rently are receiving their last year
of funding.
Baker attributed some of the
recognition her work has re
ceived to its "timely" value. She
researches wireless computing
methods and said her goal is to
allow Internet users to enjoy
continuous connectivity by
"switching] between net
works."
The award will give the stu
dents in Baker's research group
an opportunity to travel to con
ferences. Some of the funds may
also go toward acquiring addi
tional equipment.
She said winning a Terman
Fellowship is satisfying because

it comes with "no strings at
tached."
"Money is a big help, but the
honor is more important," Her
ron said. He said he regards the
Terman Fellowship as an indica
tion that his work may "be help
ful to those dealing with human
disease."
His award will directly support
research on CD34 (human prog
enitor cell antigen). According to
Herron, CD34 may be involved in
the trafficking of vascular cells
between the skin and the bone
marrow.
Rando said he intends to use
his award to continue laboratory
work. His research focuses on
"basic mechanisms of cell degen
eration in muscular dystro
phies."
Because no treatments for
these disorders currently exist,
Rando's studies may have signifi
cant long-term implications. He

stressed the novelty of his ap
proach, which examines the rela
tionship between gene expression
and disease expression in hopes of
developing therapeutic solutions.
Andrews is regarded as a lead
ing researcher in curvature flow
with a specialty in differential
equations, differential geometry
and convexity theory.
A leading experimental atomic
physicist, Kasevich is described
by his peers as an emerging world
leader in the field.
Molecular neurobiologist
Simon is working on research
that attempts to explain how an
individual cell decides what type
of cell it will become.
Simon's laboratory is current
ly examining the cells in the eye of
the fruit fly. The information
gathered in his experiments may
in the future contribute to an un
derstanding of similar processes
in more complex organisms.
