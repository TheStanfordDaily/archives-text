RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP)
Yasser Arafat's security forces and Israeli
soldiers exchanged gunfire yesterday as
riots erupted in Jerusalem and the West
Bank â€” the worst clashes since the 1987-
93 revolt against Israeli occupation.
The exchanges of fire broke out during
stone-throwing protests by thousands of
Palestinians who were angered by
Israel's decision to open an archaeological
tunnel near Jerusalem's A 1 Aqsa Mosque
compound, one of Islam's holiest sites.
Four Palestinians, including two
policemen, were killed in the firelight
with Israeli troops south of the
Bank town of Ramallah, hospital officials
said. More than 350 Palestinian
protesters were injured in Ramallah and
in another protest in Bethlehem, includ
ing more them 30 by gunfire. Nine Israeli
soldiers were wounded in the two clashes,
the army said.

In Bethlehem, about 500 Palestinians
hurled firebombs and stones at Israeli
troops guarding Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish
holy site where the biblical matriarch is
believed to be buried.
At some point, Palestinian police, tak
ing cover behind bushes and trees near
the tomb, opened fire on the Israeli
troops yarding the tomb.
Soldiers fired tear gas and live bullet.-
after protesters burned down trees and a
wooden road divider outside the tomb at
the entrance to the city. Although Bethle
hem is under Palestinian rule, the tomb
has remained under Israel control.
The sound of gunshots from the fight
ing in Bethlehem could bo heard in down
town Jerusalem, five miles away.
Palestinian demonstrators said they
took to the streets with the encourage
ment of their leaders. "The Palestinian
Authority is giving us the green light to

demonstrate and throw stones and
return to the uprising," said Mohammed
Kafkay.
The clashes were reminiscent of the
six-year Palestinian uprising against
Israeli occupation that ended with the
1993 signing of a breakthrough peace
agreement. Nearly 2,000 Palestinians
were killed by Israelis during the revolt.
However, a new uprising would likely
be much more bloody since about 30,000
armed Palestinian police have been
deployed in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip as part of the peace accords.
Palestinian witnesses said in the
Ramallah clashes, junior Palestinian
policemen defied orders by their com
manding officers not to shoot at Israeli
soldiers.
Israeli Prime Minister Renjamin
Netanyahu yesterday accused Palestini
an leaders of incitinir oassions.
