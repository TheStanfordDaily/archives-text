## Tresidder's potential 
### 
Stanford Management
Company must not make
promises it cannot keep
IMAGINE A REAL student
union. Think of a place that
does more than offer office
space and meeting rooms but actu
ally entices students with good
food, a collegial atmosphere and
affordable shopping for everyday
goods. It's not difficult to do; most
universities of Stanford's size have
exactly such a place.
Tresidder Union is supposed to
be our student union, and on
paper it looks like a good one. The
ASSU and the Office of Student
Affairs are located there. The Cof
fee House dishes out falafels and
other trendy foods; there's a con
venience store, a cafeteria and
even a game room. And yet,
Tresidder lacks that certain buzz
that young ambitious people cre
ate wherever they congregate.
Much of the unattractive char
acter of Tresidder can be traced to
two factors beyond the control of
University administrators and
students, namely campus geogra
phy and poor architecture. The
sheer scale of Stanford's campus
makes one central locus of student
activity difficult to achieve.
Moreover, Tresidder suffers
from a less than notable architec
tural blueprint. Built during the
era when functionalism was the
buzzword in institutional architec
ture, Tresidder mirrors the ultra
rational corporate ethos of post-
IVar American organizations: no
ornamentation (a waste of money),
fnultiple entrances (pedestrian
flow) and removable walls (flexibil
ity of space). While this style
undoubtedly has its technical
advantages and makes perfect
$ense for an IBM or DMV office
building, it is completely unsuit
able to a student center.
! Alas, Tresidder is all we have,
&nd University administrators

and student groups have an obli
gation to make the best of it. If
Tresidder's managers only took
advantage of the building's built
in flexibility, Stanford students
could enjoy the kind of student
union that their peers take for
granted.
It is therefore especially unfor
tunate that recent attempts to
improve Tresidder's attractive
ness have been handled so poorly
by the Stanford Management
Company.
Recognizing that Tresidder
could use a shot in the arm, the
Stanford Management Company
tried to lure Taco Bell into the
union three years ago. As negotia
tions with Taco Bell dragged on,
students were let down time and
again as "opening day"was contin
ually pushed back. In the end, the
Stanford Management Company
decided to deal with the local Mex
ican restaurant chain, Polio's,
instead.
The Polio's idea seemed like a
winner: good, cheap food, late
hours and room for 100 cus
tomers, all by the first day of fall
quarter 1996. Again, promises
were made to students, and again
students came back to school with
no Mexican restaurant in sight.
This time, delays in the construc
tion permit-approval process were
to blame.
Stanford Management Company
cannot be faulted for what appears
to be an unusually slow response by
county officials, but it should be
taken to task for promising results
that it simply cannot deliver. If all
of the necessary steps have yet to be
taken to secure an enterprise's
opening, students should not be
told that everything is ready.
The opening of Polio's this quar
ter would be a clear sign to students
that the administration is dedicat
ed to making the best of Tresidder.
While Tresidder has some inherent
problems, a little innovative think
ing, some administrative support
and student initiative could surely
overcome the unpromising physi
cal premises.
