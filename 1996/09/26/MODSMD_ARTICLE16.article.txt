## Mary Edmonds Simple actions can keep Stanford safe 
### 
WELCOME
CLASS of 2000,
transfer stu
dents, and graduate and
professional students.
Welcome back all return
ing students. The energy
and vitality that you
bring to the campus was
absent this summer. I

hope you all had a pro
ductive summer and are ready to meet the
challenges of a new year.
Each year students ask the question,
"What does the vice provost and dean for
student affairs do?" Let me explain it this
way. I am responsible for much of the out
of-classroom support services, facilities
and activities that promote a safe, healthy
and comfortable living / learning environ
ment so that students can excel in their
academic, personal and professional pur
suits.
Some of those services include: Residen
tial Education, residential computing,
housing facilities, maintenance, housing
assignments, Dining Services, student
activities and organizations, the ethnic
centers, Bechtel International Center, the
Women's Center, the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center, the Disabili
ty Resource Center, judicial affairs, Tresid
der Union, Orientation, primaiy medical
care, Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices, Health Promotion Services, the Haas

Center for Public Service, registration and
enrollment, career planning and place
ment, undergraduate admissions and
undergraduate and graduate financial aid.
At the beginning of each academic year,
I believe that it is prudent to remind every
body of the many ways to keep healthy and
safe. The following are some of the mea
sures you can take and the services that
are offered to ensure your safety and the
safety of others:
• A self-defense non-credit class is offered
for men and women through the Ofiice of
Student Activities.
• The SURE Escort Service is available in
the evenings for those who do not wish to
walk alone at night. This year it will be
operating out of the Women's Center.
• Blue light towers were installed over the
summer in various locations around the
campus. Know where they are and how to
operate them should you need to do so.
• Party planning guidelines, available in
the Office of Student Activities, have been
established to ensure that parties are safe.
Those wishing to have a party must be
aware of the rules, attend a meeting and
conduct the event according to the guide
lines. Use the buddy system whenever
appropriate.
• While we don't know when disaster, espe
cially an earthquake, will strike, we must
prepare for the inevitable. Please take seri
ously the disaster plans that are in place.
It's a good idea to attend the workshops

that are planned in your dorms or Row
houses so that you will know what to do in
case of a disaster or emergency. For those
of you who live off campus, I would suggest
finding out what the plans are for the city
in which you reside.
• Propping open outside doors and negli
gence in locking room doors are invitations
for someone to enter and do harm.
• Locking bikes on ramps for the disabled
and leaving them in corridors and
entrances is a sign of disrespect for a spe
cial population here at Stanford so please
refrain from doing those things.
• Bike riders must obey the California vehi
cle codes. Stop signs mean just that — stop
before proceeding. Every year there are
several bike / pedestrian and bike / car
accidents on campus, some being very seri
ous. Observe the bike lanes and ride at an
acceptable speed. Your safety as well as
those of others are at risk when you go at
fast speeds.
I have belabored the topic of safety
because I care about your safety and want
to ensure that your stay on the Farm is a
pleasant one. Stanford is considered a safe
campus, and it can remain that way if we all
play our part in making it so. The above is
meant as a reminder of the many ways we
— faculty, students and staff — can all
demonstrate that we care about each other.
