Thompson neglected Stanford's service-learning venues

MONDAY'S DAILY CARRIED a
front page story covering Presi
dent Gerhard Casper's Convoca
tion speech to entering students on
"choices" and Nick Thompson's "View
point" column on service-learning, two
very different commentaries on living
and learning at Stanford. Casper called
on new students to be thoughtfully
focused as they made choices from the
rich! array of opportunities offered at the
University. Thompson criticized the
University for offering "almost no
resources dedicated to supporting ser- <
vice-learning programs," a "choice" he

made repeatedly during his years as a
student.
While I very much welcome Thomp
son's advocacy for service-learning and
his call on us to make it more visible and
available to Stanford students, I want to
point out that due to the dedication of
numerous faculty and staff there are in
fact many service-learning "choices" in
the curriculum. Some 60 courses, in
fact, with several new courses "under
construction" by faculty members who
gave up a weekend earlier this month to
# consider how they might include service
learning in their instruction. Many

other faculty regularly sponsor and
supervise service-related directed read
ing and community-based research pro
jects through their departments and
through the Haas Center's Public Ser
vice Scholars Program.
These choices can certainly be made
more visible to students through the
Stanford Bulletin and other means, as
advocated by Thompson. Faculty mem
bers who support students' service
learning have asked for and deserve
institutional support. But, the effort
extended by the Haas Center over many
years and by Stanford faculty, has been

significant and, based on increasing fac
ulty interest, is likely to expand.
President Casper's Convocation talk
rightly points out students' responsibili
ty to choose thoughtfully. For those stu
dents, like Thompson, who wish to
express a strong service commitment
and carry out serious intellectual
inquiry, service-learning solves one of
these "choice" challenges. In service
learning, academic study informs stu
dents' service while service illuminates
their studies.
