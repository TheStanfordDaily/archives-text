# Liberals must vote for Clinton if they want to see more social change
## 
### 
Rudolph Delson's column yesterday
urging liberals to help defeat Bill Clinton
in November should delight Republicans
but dismay those who favor fair and com
passionate government. Delson asserts
thqt if Clinton loses, the Democrats will
"recognize that they lost the election
because they lost the left."
On the contrary, like everyone else,
Democrats will assume, correctly, that
Clinton lost because more people favored
Bob Dole's right-wing agenda than Clin
ton's slightly left-of-center policies.

George McGovern, the Democratic nomi
nee in 1972, was an impeccable liberal
whom Delson would undoubtedly have
supported, but after he lost every state in
the union except Massachusetts to
Richard Nixon, the Democrats learned a
lesson and moved to the center.
In a country of 250 million people who
represent a diversity of religious beliefs,
economic interests and ethnic back
grounds, a candidate needs to be a com
promiser in order to win. Unfortunately,
the true left is still a minority in this
country, and we have to make do with the
best choice we have.
Considering the alternatives, Clinton is
the only reasonable choice this November.
There is certain to be a vacancy on the
Supreme Court during the next four
years, so a Dole victory would assure that

a majority of the Court would be made up
of anti-choice ideologues like Anton Scalia
and Clarence Thomas for years to come.
The gap between the rich and the poor
would widen still further as the Republi
cans enact tax breaks for the very rich
and cut funding for programs that benefit
children, the poor and the disabled. The
protections we have now for clean air and
water would be drastically weakened and
health and safety regulations gutted as
Dole and the Congress repay their corpo
rate backers. Talk of a balanced budget
would be forgotten as the Republicans
push through an even more inflated mili
tary budget, including a Star Wars pro
gram that won't work, would violate the
ABM Treaty and eventually cost some
$60 billion.
Clinton, for all his flaws, has defended

affirmative action and women's reproduc
tive rights. He has cut the budget deficit by
half, reducing the chance of inflation, and
he has supported labor's concerns over the
opposition of Congress. He recently signed
a comprehensive test ban treaty, which
now faces Republican opposition in the
Senate. Dole even opposes an international
ban on chemical weapons, which all other
major nations have approved.
Dole's allegiance is to the far right on
social issues and to the rich and powerful
on economic issues. The best option liber
als have this fall is to follow Jesse Jack
son's advice and re-elect Clinton and a
Democratic Congress, then push them
hard to adopt the progressive legislation
we favor.
