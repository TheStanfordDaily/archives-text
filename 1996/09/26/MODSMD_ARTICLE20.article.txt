## Water polo plans to splash on Long Beach, Pacific 
### Rustan Eklund 
Coming off a fifth-place finish in the UC-
Irvine Tournament, the young Stanford
water polo team looks to maintain its rank
ing while continuing to improve as it battles
eighth-ranked Long Beach State tomorrow
and sixth-ranked Pacific on Sunday.
As the head coach of the No. 5 Stanford
squad, Dante Dettamanti hopes to see his
players hold the line against teams that are
ranked lower than Stanford in the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation.
"Pacific barely lost to No. 1 UCLA, so
they're a legitimate team," Dettamanti
said. "And Long Beach is a team we should
beat."
Last year the 49ers pulled an 11-10 sur
prise upset in MPSF play. Dettamanti
looks forward to tomorrow's 3 p.m. game at
deGuerre Pool as an opportunity to avenge
last season's loss.
"We kind of owe Long Beach — they beat
us for the first time in 10 years last season
in a league game that counted toward our
seeding," Dettamanti said.
With the return of injured sophomore
forward David Hay and senior holeman
Bryce Matthews this weekend, Dettamanti
is confident that the overall play of the
team will be improved. In their absence last
week, the team relied heavily on the play of
senior holeman Wallin to pull them
through tough tournament competition.

Now, these players can provide Wallin with
some help.
The fact that the squad is so young poses
special difficulties for Dettamanti. Despite
the great talent on the team, he thinks it
still needs to work on getting practice tinn
in tournament competition.
"We have only a few experienced players;
the rest are all rookies," Dettamanti said.
"It depends on how much they are willing to
improve. Hopefully we can peak at the end
of the season. . . . We need guys playing to
gether as a team. So the return of David and
Bryee will make a big difference."
With key contributors returning from
the sideline, senior Tyrone Miller said the
club must improve its performance against
lesser squads.
"We need to come out strong against
Long Beach," Miller said. "We haven't been
playing as well as we should be against the
weaker teams."
Hay shared Miller's sentiments. "Long
Beach should be an easy win if we play
well," he said.
While Long Beach may not be much of a
threat in the near future, Dettamanti
thinks the game against UOP on Sunday
will be a different story as the Stanford
squad travels to Stockton.
"Our hardest game of the next two or
three weeks is Sunday against UOP," Det
tamanti said.

Earlier this month at the UC-
Irvine Tournament, UOP came
within one point of an upset, los
ing to California in sudden-death
overtime. Stanford went on to de
feat an exhausted Tiger squad 7-3
later in the tournament.
"They have an excellent coun
terattack and have always been
tough in their pool," Dettamanti
said. "And with players like
Olympic swimmer Brad Schu
macher they have great speed.
They are a really good team."
The players' thoughts on the
Tigers reflected Dettamanti's.
"Pacific is a big game, and we
need to win to hold our ranking,"
Hay said. "If we play well, we can
beat anyone — but we're going to
have to step it up."
