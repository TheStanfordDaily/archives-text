# Soccer hopes to continue win streak
## Clark's squad eager to confront the Matadors at Maloney 
### Dan Geyser 
For the Stanford men's soccer team, this
year has been anything but "business as
usual." Under the guidance of new head
coach Bobby Clark, the Card looks to better
its impressive start of 4-1-2 when it takes on
Cal State-Northridge tomorrow at Maloney
Field.
Coming off strong wins in a weekend tour
nament at St. Mary's, the Stanford squad is
carrying new, well-deserved confidence into
tomorrow's 4 p.m. matchup, which also rep
resents its first home game since classes
"We're on a team high, but we need to
infrirrtttfn our focus in order to win this
game," junior midfielder Jeff Szekeres said.
"We're just taking it one game at a time."
This new discipline has paid off — the
team has not lost since its season opener and
has already scored more goals than it did all

of last year, a testament to the developing
team chemistry and Clark's skilled leader
ship.
"He has really turned the team around,"
Szekeres said of Clark.
The Cal State-Northridge game repre
sents an important step in creating a new soc
cer tradition at Stanford. The team hopes to
build its sport around community participa
tion and involvement, key aspects of a suc
cessful program.
"Our first step in creating an atmosphere
is being a good team," sophomore goalkeeper
Jon Bruck said.
The Card's winning start should bring the
attention and recognition that tho squad is
looking for. Along with generating respect,
the team's current record has also put its
members in a good position at this point in
the season — even though they have yet to
play a conference game — for a wild-card bid
into the NCAA tournament.

The team hopes to combine its current in
tensity with support from the student body
to continue its winning streak through to
morrow and into the rest of the season. An
NCAA berth, unthinkable during last year's
5-12-2 debacle, seems well within reach with
the team's present level of play and improve
ment; it would be the perfect reward for the
new work ethic and performance displayed so
far this season.
"This year's all about creating a tradi
tion," Bruck said.
The game tomorrow also marks the re
turn of senior midfielder Steve Kirschbaum,
a key playmaker who has been injured the
past few weeks. His recovery comes at an op
portune time, as his presence will be needed
to fill the void left by injuries to junior Shan
Gaw, sophomore Dan Traylor and, most re
cently, to freshman Brandon Garringer, who
separated his shoulder at the Gaels' tourna
ment.
