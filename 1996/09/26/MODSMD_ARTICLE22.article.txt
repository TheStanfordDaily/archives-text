# Out of the Woods
## Without Tiger, golfers work twice as hard 
### Vanessa Arrington Editorial staff 
Despite the men's golf team's
loss of Stanford student-turned
pro-athlete Tiger Woods, coach
Wally Goodwin is confident that
his team will still be strong this
year, although its members may
have to work twice as hard to com
pensate for Woods' absence.
The men's squad will have a
chance to begin proving itself this
weekend as it opens its 1996-97
season at the Missouri Bluffs In
tercollegiate tournament in St.
Charles, Mo., just outside St.
Louis.
"Each of the four guys who are
back will have to pick it up a shot a
round in order for us to play in the
top 10 or 15 teams in the country,"
Goodwin said. "And when you're
already at a high level, averaging
73 (shots a round), it's difficult to
shoot 72."
Lone senior Conrad Ray, who
will be playing the No. 2 position,
will help lead his team to this goal.
"We all played quite a bit this sum
mer, and we just need to take it up
a notch," Ray said. "If we put all
our individual best games forward
we will be right on course this
weekend.
"This year should be fun, be
cause a lot of people are writing us
off since Tiger is gone. But I think
we can definitely prove our
selves."
Sophomore Joel Kribel, who
played No. 2 behind Woods last
year, will fill the top slot this sea
son. Kribel had a busy summer,
advancing to the semifinals of the
1996 National Amateur where he
lost to Woods. He also won the
1996 Pacific Northwest Amateur
and the 1996 Western Amateur.
Kribel, a native of Pleasanton,
Calif, is ranked sixth by Rolex
Collegiate Golf in the 1996-97 pre
season rankings.
Filling the next three slots for
the Stanford squad are juniors Eri
Crum and Jake Poe and sopho
more Scott Wang, respectively.
In addition to losing Woods, the
Cardinal team needs to fill the
holes left behind by graduates

Jerry Chang and Darren
Dragovich. Four freshman re
cruits, along with the returning
team members, will attempt to ac
complish this feat.
"We have a really good class of
freshmen coming in — they've all
won junior tournaments around
the country," Goodwin said. "But
they are freshmen, and they
haven't learned the mental tricks
you need in golf," which he referred
to as being a "very mental sport."
Though the men's team will
begin its challenge this weekend,
golf is practically a year-long
sport, with the final champi
onships occurring at the end of
May. This gives the team the time
it needs to learn and then polish
its skills.
"In the winter, by the middle of
March, we'll really know what we
can do," Goodwin said. "But until
we've seen everyone and played in
different circumstances, it's hard
to say."
This weekend's two-day tour
nament will give the players a
good picture of what their compe
tition is made of, as a total of 15
schools will be at the St. Charles
course. Stanford will be the only
Pac-10 competitor at the tourna
ment, which is dominated by Mid
west schools.
"We'll just finish and see how
we do," Goodwin said. "In golf,
you don't play against somebody,
you play with people. You're try
ing to beat them, but beat them
when they're playing their best, so
you root each other on.
"We'll just try to evaluate the
teams we play with, so as the year
goes along we can evaluate who it
is we have to beat to go to the na
tionals," he said.
After the Missouri tourna
ment, Stanford will be attending
the Golf Week-Ping in Chicago, a
tournament reserved for the na
tion's top 18 teams. The Chicago
golf course will also host the
NCAAs in May, giving an advan
tage to those invited next week
end.
According to Goodwin, the top
contenders at the Chicago tourna
ment will be Florida along with

the perennial powerhouses Ari
zona State, Oklahoma State and
Texas.
"We have a really competitive
schedule, a year-long schedule,
but I hope the guys have a good
time," Goodwin said.
"I think we're all reallv excit-

Ed to get out there and play," Ray
said. "At the end of last year we
had really matured, but now we
are pretty young. We need to get
as many tournaments under our
belts as we can and just play
every tournament one step at a
time."
