# It's time to follow The Bootleg's lead
## 
### 
It's another beginning of the
school year. Freshmen are frol
icking to their First fraternity
parties, sophomores are trying to
accept that they are no longer frosh
while still attending events like Mu-
FuUnSun, juniors are either ad
justing to life overseas or cursing
their friends who left them behind
at the Farm, and seniors are getting

drunk at senior pub nights, pre
tending they're not worried about
where they'll be this time next year.
What could possibly be missing
in this wonderful hoopla of a Stan
ford fall?
Can we say FOOTBALL
GAMES and some school spirit?
The two opening games of the
season registered pitiful atten
dance figures. Granted, the only
people around were Stanford alum
ni, graduate students and those
couldn't-even-leave-Stanford-for
a-summer undergraduates, but
still, it was embarrassing. (OK, so I
wasn't at the very first game either,
but I wanted to be, really.)
Then the freshmen came for
Orientation, bursting with energy
and ready to sport their Cardinal
colors, only to find that there was
no weekend football game. Finally,
all the upperclassmen returned,
and still, there was no game.
So it was bad scheduling on the
part of whoever. But rather than
whine any more over what has
passed, it's time to focus on the fu
ture, and what we, as Stanford stu
dents. can do to help what seems to
be a dying football program.
Now 1 must be honest here: I am
not what you would call a die-hard
football fan. I don't er\joy watching
football on TV, and I certainly don't
know the intricacies of the game (in
fact, it's purported that I once
asked whether Stanford was going
to make it to the Super Bowl).
Regardless, I do enjoy going to
Stanford football games and ac
knowledge the importance of these
contests in leading students to
cross their "class" boundaries and
unify as a school. Attending football
games, in addition to going to other
sports events (which I'm sure I'll
hype at some point this volume),
are some of the best ways to show
your school spirit and have fun
while getting the California tan
your East Coast friends will talk
about when you go home for
Thanksgiving.
The Bootleg
Changing gears, what I really
want to do is give kudos to a couple
of guys who possess exactly what
the typical Stanfordite lacks —
complete and utter devotion to
Stanford football and a willingness
to continuously display their spirit
for their alma mater, even if it's a
thankless and lonely job.
Jim Rutter and Lars Ahlstrom
are editor in chief and publisher, re

spectively, of The Bootleg, a
newsletter that calls itself the
"unauthorized authority on Cardi
nal football." The Bootleg, which
has an editorial mission to "pro
mote hard-nosed, pioneering cover
age with aggressive editorial con
tent," is produced weekly during
the football season and is designed
to "encourage maniacal, near dan
gerous support" of Stanford foot
ball.
Rutter and Ahlstrom have very
different backgrounds and'pur
suits, but their mutual
football, as well as their uftiq ie
brand of humor, tie them together.
Rutter, who is the vice president
and director of venture bankiiig at
Imperial Bank in Menlo Park,
comes from a local, very footi}al]-
oriented family. His dad,-who
serves as "the conscience" of-The
Bootleg to keep them from getting
overzealous, is a serious foetball
buff whose historical archivfeitf of
Stanford football paraphernalia
have provided the basis for.""The
Bootleg's research and
edge articles.
During my interview with! 'The
Bootleg boys (who were slaving
away on the week's newsletter as
we spoke), I saw a picture th^t)at
tested to the level of hard-corebess
of Rutter's relations — someone in
his family (which has four genera
tions of Stanford alumni, on]b of
whom was a member of Stanford's
first class) had dressed little 2-
month-old Rutter up in Stanford
football clothes and taken a picture
of him with a framed newspaper ar
ticle on the Cardinal squad.
In contrast, Ahlstrom, the chief
financial officer of Women's Appar
el Company in San Francisco, is a
native Swede who didn't even know
what American football was whun
he was growing up.
Though they both attended
Stanford. Ahlstrom (Class of '82)
and Rutter ('B6), didn't meet until
1993 at a Stanford football game in
Tucson, Ariz., where Ahlstrom was
sitting right in front of Rutter in the
stands. It didn 't take long until thqv
were both thinking, "Wow, this
guy's a fanatic," and then started
talking.
That following spring, they put
together the first edition of the
newsletter, which was sent to about
20 friends. Now, almost two years
later, the circulation is close to
1,000, though they estimate that
about 3,000 people read The Boot
leg each week.
These guys are so dedicated to
The Bootleg that during football
season they have no lives. On topof
their full-time jobs, they spefid
about 50 hours a week producing
the newsletter that is aptly de
scribed as "a blend of satire, sar
casm and excessive exuberance"
with content that is "irreverent and
flippant."
"Nothing else, whether it be
money or power or sex, could drive
you to stay up all night every night"
like The Bootleg has done, Rutter
said.
Right before The Bootleg went
full force in the fall of 1994, Rutter
took a 12-day vacation with his
then-girlfriend to Belize. When he
came back. The Bootleg took so
much of his time that he neverj^en


Vanessa
Arrington
dated her again.
Fortunately, Rutter and
Ahlstrom have occasional helpers,
usually in the form of interns, who
lessen the work load. But additional
help is always needed, and their ulti
mate goal is to have The Bootleg
taken over by some similarly gung
ho students who want to keep the
tradition going.
In addition to their sheer dedica
tion, Rutter and Ahlstrom have
smarts about the game (unlike yours
truly) as well as fact-based insights
into the inner workings of the team
arid its players. So whether you are
trtily interested in Stanford football,
enjoy witty writing or just want to
support these guys, you should be
come a Bootleg subscriber. Their
goals are pure, and they're even of

fering a discount for freshmen.
And the options don't end there.
The Bootleg staff has created vari
ous articles of Bootgear, including
but not limited to Boot Toots, whis
tles made of cedar wood that add
wonderful noise to the lyrical tunes
of the Stanford band, and Bootbrew,
a premium pilsner with a yummy
taste I can attest to.
So let us prove Ahlstrom, who
called Stanford Stadium the "center
of human apathy," wrong — buy
your Boot Toot (purchasable for $5
at The Bootleg tailgater in lot 3) and
come to the game to toot our team to
a successful season (or at least a fun
one). Even if you don't like football,
you probably like Stanford, and our
school deserves some enthusiasm.
