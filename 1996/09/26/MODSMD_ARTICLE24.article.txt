# Supporting students goal for new priest
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
He loves chocolate, music and
in-line skating. He is 32 years old
and loves the sunny weather here.
But despite all the diversions, the
Rev. John Paul Forte's main am
bition is to serve as a support for
the Stanford community.
New to the Farm, Forte is one
of two priests who lead Stanford's
Catholic ministry, which was ac
quired by the Western Dominican
Province last year.
"I'm looking forward to being a
real presence on campus, for the
Catholic community but also for
any student needing support,"
Forte said.
Forte takes the place of the
Rev. Armando Ibanez, who is in
Hollywood for the next two years,
working as a chaplain for a group
of Dominican nuns while attend
ing film school.
Before arriving on campus,

Forte worked with young adults
in a large parish in San Francis
co. He said he feels his youth en
ables him to appreciate and un
derstand the issues facing young
people and to help them "grapple
with what it means to be young
and Catholic."
"It's nice just to be a part of a
believing community, of people
with a lot of bents and slants,"
Forte said. "Our role is to create
an environment where that can
happen."
Forte, who grew up in Los An
geles, began to consider priest
hood at the age of 21 and moved to
the Bay Area in 1985. He studied
at the Graduate Theological
Union in Berkeley and was or
dained at St. Mary's College in
Moraga, Calif., in 1993.
Stanford students "are learn
ing so many things and specialis
ing in so many areas, but there's a
real need to integrate their educa
tion," he added. "There are some

questions our education doesn't
answer for us — like matters of
the heart."
According to Forte, the role of
the Catholic community is to offer
hospitality.
"My role is to facilitate the
learning process... to help people
form themselves and to help them
use their education to make a dif
ference — socially, politically,
spiritually, personally," Forte
said. "Knowledge helps us to
broaden our horizons, but wis
dom is the practical application of
what we know."
Forte said one of his most ex
citing experiences upon first com
ing to Stanford was listening to
the choir at Memorial Church.
"The choir does a whole inter
esting montage of different music.
... For me, that's really what
'Catholic' is — a celebration of di
versity."
Forte also said he wants people
to know that he is accessible.

"It's important that this be a
place where people can come
speak about things, in an intellec
tual sense, a personal sense or a
spiritual sense."
