# Nobel laureate wins prize for innovation, work with lasers
## 
### Tienlon Ho 
Best known as a co-inventor of the
laser, Nobel Laureate and Physics
Prof. Emeritus Arthur L. Schawlow
recently won the Ronald H. Brown
American Innovator Award.
Schawlow — who is recognized
by the scientific community along
with his brother-in-law, Charles
Townes, as the inventor of the laser
and an innovator in laser spec
troscopy — said he is "of course,
honored to receive the award.
"It's always good to have recog
nition," he said. "And this one is dif
ferent. It honors the actual inven
tion and not just the physics re
search."
The award, only in its second
year, recognizes the contributions
of American inventors and will be
presented by the U.S. Department
of Commerce in October.
One of seven scientists honored
this year, Schawlow joins three
Intel researchers, who contributed
to the development of the micro
processor, and other inventors.
Schawlow had an opportunity to
meet his colleagues in Akron, Ohio,
when the four were inducted into
the National Inventors Hall of
Fame.

In addition to
his recent awards,
Schawlow holds
the U.S. National
Medal of Science
and honorary de
grees in six coun
tries. To col
leagues here at
Stanford,
Schawlow's nu-

merous awards are not a surprise.
Applied Physics Prof. Steve
Chu described Schawlow as "one
of the most popular physicists
around. Besides his great sense of
humor, he has the essential quali
ty of a great scientist which lets
him see things differently from
others and guides him to where he
should be to find a break
through."
Chu mentioned a paper
Schawlow published jointly with
physicist Ted Hansch in 1975,
which briefly proposed the possibil
ity of cooling atoms with laser light.
Twenty years later, Chu and his re
searchers are focusing on this area
and have proven this theory a reali
ty.
"He has explored so many
things over the years which have
now become major areas of re-

search," Chu said. He added that
science is not a completely indepen
dent process, as scientists pick up
on colleagues' ideas, often sublimi
nally, and are able to develop them
further.
Chu recalled an early demon
stration of the laser, in which
Schawlow rigged up a blue Mickey
Mouse balloon inside a clear balloon
and shot both with a laser in the
shape of a sci-fi ray gun. To the
amazement of even scientists, the
light punctured only the colored
balloon.
Schawlow's demonstration par
alleled the principle used in retinal
laser surgery today. Although those
who would eventually be credited
as the developers of laser surgery
probably were not in the room that
day, Schawlow's demonstration
foreshadowed the possible applica
tions of the laser.
The famed scientist himself said
that "science is cumulative. Inven
tions are continually built upon."
Schawlow's 1981 Nobel Prize
winning work, the laser is a tool
now used in industry, medicine, sci
entific research, computer technol
ogy and countless areas of daily life.
Other applications remain to be dis
covered.
