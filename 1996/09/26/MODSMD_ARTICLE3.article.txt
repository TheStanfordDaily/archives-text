Reversing their decision

searching for a tenured
professors to head the pro
gram.

said the Economics, Sociology and Political
Science Departments have each formed a
separate committee to gather applications
for an STS program director. The professor
would be based in the School of Humanities
and Sciences.
"Each department will bring forth to the
Humanities and Sciences office a list of
names, ranked in order of preference,"
Haber said. "The office will then convene a
committee to decide among the candidates."
The three departments must turn their

nominations in to the School of Humanities
and Sciences by Nov. 1, and the selection
process will begin immediately thereafter.
"My expectation is that we will have an ap
pointment sometime this (academic] year,"
Haber said.
Last April, University officials decided
not to seek renewal of the program's degree
granting authority, stating that the low
number of senior faculty willing to work in
STS was not sufficient for thegrowingnum
ber of STS majors. Officials in the School of
Engineering — where STS had been based
for the past several years — also appealed to
the other schools for faculty support to help
sustain the interdisciplinary program.
Since last June, students have not been
allowed to declare STS as a major because
of the uncertainty regarding the pro
gram's future. Asst. Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Judith Cain said once the
University decides on an STS program di
rector, "students will most likely be able to


Haber
declare STS again."
Although the University has
given the School of Humanities
and Sciences a full-time billet for a
tenured professor, the STS pro
gram will gain only a half-time di
rector. The program head must
also allot half of his or her time to
the department that made the ap
pointment.
Cain said it is possible the direc
tor will be hired to run the STS pro
gram for five years, adding that
most appointees are chosen for a
specific period of time.
"The person appointed is going
to be a major scholar in a specific
field," Haber said. "At the same
time, the person should have the
vision and administrative abilities
to direct a program as important as
STS."
He added that the University
has always recognized the impor
tance of STS and that student
protest was not a factor in its deci
sion to keep the program. After the
announcement to phase out the
STS major was made, students or
ganized a group, "Save STS," to

protest the decision.
Michael Putnam, ASSU direc
tor of special projects and a senior
in STS, disagreed with Haber. "I
think the faculty search in Hu
manities and Sciences is a direct re
sult of students bringing up the
issue as something important to
them," he said. "It speaks well for
the University administration that
they responded so favorably."
Sophomore STS major Tony
Engel said this step is a positive one
for both STS and other interdisci
plinary programs, which combine
different majors to create a unique
academic focus.
He added, however, that he
would still like to see changes in
Stanford's treatment of interdisci
plinary'education. "Stanford's pol
icy is that program directors have
to be housed in a home depart
ment," Engel said. "It would be
nice to see someone particularly
dedicated to STS."
Putnam also said he hopes
Stanford recognizes the impor
tance of interdisciplinary pro
grams.
He added that he is currently
trying to form a panel discussion
consisting of such administrators
as Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldivar, Psy

chology Prof. Russell Fernald and
Assoc. Dean of the School of Engi
neering and Materials Science and
Engineering Prof. John Bravman
to discuss issues like faculty teach
ing loads and faculty incentives.
Haher said he believes it is im
possible to compare STS with
other interdisciplinary programs.
"Other programs don't have the
kind of leadership problems that
STS does," he said. "Stanford has
many East Asian."
The Sociology Department
began its search for qualified can
didates to head STS last week. So
ciology Prof. John Meyer said that
due to lack of time, his department
is using a word-of-mouth method
to search for applicants.
"Normally, departments search
for candidates by advertising heav
ily, first by writing letters to an
nounce the job opening," Meyer
said. "But because we have to turn
in names by the beginning of No
vember, we're collecting names
from people in the department."
Meyer added that each depart
ment is searching for candidates
with strengths specific to its own
qualifications. "We're not looking
on an interdisciplinary basis. That
will come from the dean's office,"
he said.
