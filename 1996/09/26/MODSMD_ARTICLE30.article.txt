## 'Yankees' Triumph Jerry Lewis finds the role of his lifetime as Satan 
### 
"Damn Yankees," a revival of the 1956 Tony Award-winner for
Best Musical, marks Jerry Lewis' theatrical debut. Audiences will be
delighted by this rebirth of a skilled performer.
The show, adapted to Lewis' unique stage presence, is the per
fect vehicle for the latest transformation. Lewis plavs Applegate, the
wisecracking devil who offers a middle-aged man the chance for
immortality on the baseball diamond in exchange for his soul.
Real-estate salesman Joe Hardy (John Michael Mate), the would-be
Hall of l amer, accepts the offer after negotiating an escape clause
in the contract. I le suddenly finds himself trying to lead the worst
team in baseball to the pennant while avoiding the advances of Lola
(Valerie Wright), the devil's saucy sidekick, and the wizardry of
Mephisto himself.
Lewis' Satan, complete with a 15-minute, show-stopping, im
promptu stand-up routine in the middle of the second act, domi
nates the show. His rapport with audiences, long ago perfected on
the stages of the Sands I lotel in Las Vegas, is astounding.
Wright turns in an incredibly seductive performance as the
temptress Lola while Hate's flat Joe Hardy performs its designed
function — a main character not allowed to upstage the star.
Rob Marshall's Tony-nominated choreography, however,
seems confused and poorly adapted to the Golden Gate's stage.
Many dancers were visibly uncomfortable, rarely using the space
efficiently.
"Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, M 0.," the first act's second en
semble number, exemplifies the general disorganization of the
large group songs. Several cast members were obvious victims of
poorly timed blocking.
New York producers must be admonished for bringing large
touring productions out of Broadway without regard for each local
venue's independent flair and each theater's unique design. They
should learn from Lewis' example — simple, subtle reinventions
each time the curtain rises.
