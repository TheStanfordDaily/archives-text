# ‘Party’ Time
## It's their party, but you can come if you want to 
### 
Why had no one thought of this setup before? It's perfect lor
a play. Put a group of friends 011 the stage, each with his own
c| li irks, and have them play a game of "truth or dare."
It's a raw deal for the playwright: The structure's taken care
of, the frame begs for the single setting, and the game itself, given
to frankness and revelations, can be a handy way to reveal the
characters' dreams, desires and aspirations.
Hut in the case of "Party," the game framework proves as
much an asset as a liability.
"Party," David Dillon's raunchy comedy, gathers lor a party
six friends and a newcomer, all gay men ranging from their teens
to their 40s. They play "fact or fantasy" (their version of "truth or
dare, where you don't get to choose and the cards decide).
As each player picks up a card, he has to either answer a tough
question (usually involving sex) or perform someone's fantasy
(usually involving nudity or, in one case, whipped cream).
We learn gradually about these characters as the game pro
gresses. There's Andy (Kay Barnhart), a fresh-faced teenager;

Brian (Kcllnm Lewis), a promiscuous Broadway chorus boy;
lames (Gregory O'Neill), a fan of leather and rough sex; Philip
(John Wolfe), a happy-go-lucky kind of guy, and finally Ray
(Ross Martineau), a cynical, sharp-witted priest who delivers
most of the play's punch lines.
Hut these are supporting figures, names and faces keeping the
mood light at the party. The real characters of the play are Kevin
(Michael (iaffney) and Peter (Doug Rodgers), housemates and
the party's hosts. In their relationship, the "fact or fantasy" setup
really pays off. With each new card turned, their relationship
steps to a new level.
But although the game does allow the characters to take turns
at the spotlight, it forces them to move past any moments of
poignancy or depth, jumping straight into the next fantasy or
the dare. The game, at least in Dillon's mind, must go on, at the
sacrifice of any real drama.
It's intriguing that Dillon deliberately avoids poignancy at
every turn, driving the action towards a punch line rather than

exploring a moment and its implications. During a romantic
scene, for instance, he keeps the other characters looking on in a
state of joke-alert, focusing the mood on the humor of the situ
ation.
"Party" is not and never claims to be anything more than it is:
a fun, enjoyable party where a guest might find wit, laughter and
champagne bubbles. Accusing a party of not having depth seems
besides the point, though this one is certainly guilty on that
count. Parties are meant to amuse and entertain, and this play
does that.
The next morning you will not remember anyone's names
and probably not care to, but at least after this "Party," you
won't be hung over.
