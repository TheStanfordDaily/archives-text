## 'Oy Vey!' Klezmer music proves irresistible in 'Shlemiel' 
### 
"Ya gotta have a gimmick," crooned the strippers
in that old Sondheim musical "Gypsy," and in
"Shlemiel the First," another musical, the gimmick is
this: An average man, stuck in a dull, unhappy life,
leaves his village and goes traveling, only to find him
self returning to his old village of Chelm by accident.
Thinking this is a "second Chelm," he finds every
thing fresh, wonderful and pleasant, including the
wife and children he previously couldn't stand.
This is a good way also to describe the show itself:
The first act is (purposely) depressing, with all the un
happy wives decrying their husbands' bad habits and
singing songs with no sense of joy. Then, in the second
act, when Shlemiel rediscovers his world, things be
come more captivating, and the show itself takes of 112 .
For "Shlemiel the First" is a great flight of fancy, a
fantasy that works best when it embraces the absurdi
ty of its gimmick. Some great farce heats things up as
Shlemiel, who thinks he's in the "second" Chelm, tries
to avoid temptation as he encounters the wife of the
"second" Shlemiel. In this parallel universe, the bully
ish wife seems more like a seductive vixen.
Director David Gordon insists on a surreal world,
mixing the ancient with the post-modern. The arche
typal, mythical Eastern European shtetl (village), is
surrounded by Chagallesque paintings, and the Jew
ish villagers change costumes and genders on stage.
Everyone keeps a straight face despite the absurdi
ty of what's happening around them. Mrs. Ox (Mari

lyn Sokol), the wife of the village "sage," Mr. 0>
(Charles Levin), uses a huge plastic pickle to beat hei
husband. Later in the second act, a stagehand, dressec
in ceremonial black, does a set change while the actor
on stage are still singing. It's what ihe Zucker brother
might have thought up if they had stage directions t(
play with instead of film.
Even the ground that the actors walk on is surreal
The platform is shaped like a piece of paper foldec
open, suggesting a world in three levels. No surprise
there. The A.C.T. loves to have wild sets that look liki
doll houses, miniature fancies blown larger than lift
through some Homeric whim.
Based on Isaac Mashevis Singer's tales, "Shlemie
the First" centers around a winning theme: marriei
couples who learn to love each other again —
Shlemiel and his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. Ox. It's a joy
ful musical, celebrating love and life and all that gooc
stuff.
Most of that joy comes from the Klezmer music
performed by the San Francisco Klezmer Experience
Klezmer is the music of Jewish weddings and othei
celebrations, and it has no trouble getting everyone ti
clap along all the way to curtain calls.
