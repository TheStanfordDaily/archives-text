# TV is Your Friend
## Don't Try to Resist the Lure of the Tube — Instead, Revel in its Wonder 
### 
Midway through the second week of the
fall TV season, it's a bit early to judge
the new shows. Some, like Michael J.
Fox's "Spin City" seem promising, while others,
like Brooke Shields' "Suddenly Susan" just seem
kind of embarrassing. But, of course, you never
know. So in the meantime, let's celebrate some
old favorites. Cuddle up on the futon with your
honey, pop an EANAB and enjoy.

SEINFELD
I'm not sure that "Seinfeld" is necessarily
the television show I enjoy the most, but it's
certainly my favorite. "Frasier" often makes me
laugh harder; I care more about "ER's" charac
ters. But no television show has ever impressed
me the way "Seinfeld" has (ignoring that un
fortunate 1994-95 season), and generally still
does.
1 like shows that fit the traditional sitcom
form, but I appreciate how "Seinfeld" has broken
away from that form. Traditional sitcoms depict

the world the way Bob Dole and his conspirators
would like it to be: Every problem, no matter how
seemingly insurmountable, will work out just
dandy in the end. "Seinfeld" instead depicts the
world as we secretly wish it would be. What other
show, after all, would have killed off a principal
character's fiancee just because he didn't want to
marry her? Cruel, yes. But also easy. And more in
line with what a real person would hope for than
any just-tell the truth Brady-esque resolution.
"Seinfeld" is great television because it de
picts people as they — we — really are: doing
nothing, and doing it self-centcredly.

LfiW & ORDER
The program uses a
unique concept. Each
episode follows a crime
from commission — oc
curring during pre-credit
teaser — to the resolu
tion.
The first half of the
drama focuses on the
criminal investigation
conducted by the New
York City Police Depart
ment. The second half -
hour occurs in the con
gested courtrooms of
New York Supreme
Court.
Filmed entirely on lo
cation, the plots can often
be mistaken for early
evening news footage.
Occasionally, in mo
ments of weakness, pro
ducers present thinly
veiled recreations of
criminal episodes ripped
from the headlines of the
major news dailies. More
often, however, "I,aw &
Order" remains a devoted
servant to more earthly
issues often taken from
the files of the New York
County District Attor
ney's Office.
The program caters to
humankind's fascination
with crime and punish
ment — to the Sopho
clean denominator. Per
haps that's why I am so
drawn to it. Then again,
perhaps it's just good
television.

FfiRTY OF FIVE
Julia Salinger (Neve
Campbell), the older sister
on "Party of Five," is my
heroine because she's the
17-year-old I never was.

Yes, Julia and I have our similarities — namely,
we're both dark-haired and whiny — hut Julia's
life is dramatic and meaningful and poignant
and filled with cute hoys who tell her they love
her just before they get shipped off to boot
camp. My own high school experience ran
more along the lines of bench-warming during
soccer games, trying not to flunk math and talk
ing with my friends about, say, split ends. In

Julia's life, however— well, in Julie's life, there
are issues.
Julia's siblings, who round out the cast of
"Party," impress me equally. The plot of this
drama is that two sisters and three brothers —
ranging in age from toddler to mid-20s — are
living in San Francisco and taking care of one
another after the death of their parents. Few of
the situations they encounter are unique, but,
with the exception of this year's shockingly

cheesy season premiere, they're dealt with realis
tically. Not every episode ends with two people
hugging in agreement, and the characters don't
always make the most ethical or responsible de
cisions. Admittedly, most of the actors are beau
tiful, but it would be greedy to expect realism on
all fronts. Besides, the Salingers get out more
than normal people do, and they need to look
good while significant things happen to them.

COLOMBO
Am I doing some
thing wrong? I mean, all
my favorite shows arc in
re-runs — not a new,
going show among them
since they canceled
"Night Court." But still, I
love the old stuff, particu
larly detective shows and
particularly, particularly
"Columbo."
You know
"Columbo," don't you?
It's the greatest. Peter
Falk played Columbo
forever, and he got it
down just right. I realize,
it has kind of a rep: a
cheesy show from the '70s
about this detective who
acts really dumb but is in
fact really smart. It is, I
admit, a formula show,
but the formula is a
unique one.
To begin with, they
show you the murder at
the beginning of the
show, so you know who
did it. The trick is to see
how Columbo catches
the guy. Columbo's the
best detective around at
the little fiddly clues: It's
scary some of the stuff he
notices.
What is unique to
"Columbo," though, is
watching him catch the
murderer. You know
who he or she is, and it
never takes Columbo
very long to work out, but
Columbo spends the rest
of the show dogging the
guy, making him incrim
inate himself. It can be hi
larious, because Colum
bo's a funny character,
and it's an original way to
frame a detective show.
Plus you get great guest
stars like Johnny Cash
and Mickey Spillane.
Columbo can out-sleuth
Poirot and Jessica Fletch

cr put together, and
there's nothing like watching him do it: if you
love detective shows, I really don't think you
could do better.

fiS THE WORLD TURNS
I began watching "As The World Turns"
when I was three, after preschool at my grand

ma's house. I have taped it for seven years,
scheduled classes around it and bawled when
characters have departed. Note: No one really
dies on soap operas. They simply depart.
"As the World Turns" is unique because it
maintains its roots — the Hughes family. For
more than 40 real years and five soap opera
generations, the Hugheses have lived in Oak
dale, 111. They have triumphed over alcoholism,
bulimia, custody battles, divorces, incest, rape,
stalking, split personality disorder, etc. — more
troubles than any non-soap-opera family could
survive. Every holiday, from Christmas to the
Fourth of July, the Hugheses, including depart
ed cast / family members, celebrate by reunit
ing, singing and praying.
Sometimes life on "As the World Turns"
spins too fast. Talented actors are fired. I-atcly,
the head writers have added a young bevy of
beauties, many of whom cannot act. I submit
that the show was better years ago when the

likes of Meg Ryan, Marisa Tomei and Ming-Na
Wen lit up Oakdale.
However, the evil and enthralling James
Stcnbeck (Anthony Herrera) has returned for a
couple of episodes this month. James was killed
for the third and final time in 1989 by his son
Paul, who has also recently returned to Oak
dale. Though James is currently only haunting
Paul's dreams, I hope that he comes back to life.
Villains truly do drive a soap opera.

THE X-FILES
As my college years have flown by, I have
been watching less and less television out of
necessity. However, I adamantly refuse to
miss an episode of "The X-Files."
It has everything that a television show
