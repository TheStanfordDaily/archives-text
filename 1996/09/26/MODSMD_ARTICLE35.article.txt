## SUBLIME 
### 
Three beefy white-trash guys from Long
beach with a penchant for skate-punk fash
ion and gangsta posing, Sublime first broke
onto the scene with "Date Rape," an uninten
tionally goofy ska romp from its album "40
oz. to Freedom." While "40 oz." sounded like
a bunch of meatheads merrily stumbling
their way through low-rent reggae standards,
Sublime's eponymous third album is a con
siderably more mature blend of ska, reggae,
punk and hip-hop — and with the death of
frontman Brad Nowell from a heroin over
dose, it's become a chronicle of what was and
what might have been for Sublime.
Forget for the moment that Nowell died a
rock star's death; Sublime are strictly regular
guys who drink beer, smoke pot and love
their dogs. But it's that working-class regu
larness that gives Sublime their appeal; they
built a broad fan base from constant touring
and two self-produced records before signing
with MCA.
The first single from "Sublime," "What I
Got," hits a summertime groove with ringing
acoustic guitars and a great call-and-re
sponse chorus; it shows that Nowell could
not only write good songs, but was also a pro
ficient guitarist. He may boast, "1 can play the
guitar like a motherfuckin' riot," but then
he'll show you how he does it.
From there, "Sublime" makes its way
through a variety of musical styles; the dark
er, sluggish groove of "Garden Grove," the
all-out punk grind of "Paddle Out," the
jumpy ska of "Wrong Way" and "Burritos,"
and the psychedelic rock of "Under My
Voodoo." Occasionally, Sublime gets bogged
down in extra-long jams ("Jailhouse," "Pawn
Shop"), but for the most part they keep it
fresh.

As for Nowell's lyrics, they're written sim
ply and honestly, but a few times they don't
ring true. His sensitive-guy act on "What I
Got" contrasts with his tales of dead-end liv
ing and fight-the-power anthems. Come on,
a white guy from Long Beach penning the
riot fantasy "April 29, 1992 (Miami)" and
singing about popping a cap in an informer
(the obligatory pot-praising song "Get
Ready")? Most of that shouldn't matter,
though, if you like good grooves, 'cause this
album is full of them.
