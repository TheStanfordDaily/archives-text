I am not suggesting that Lycia's "Cold" will
make you depressed if you are not already, al
though my friend and I did make a pact the first
time wc listened to it that we would turn it off
immediately if one of us started crying or feel
ing suicidal. Rather, the soaring beauty Lycia
manages to entwine with unhappy ambiance
spins one's inclinations towards the dark side.
I spent a day in bed. I enjoyed the luxury of
being truly, undeniably lazy. When someone
called, I told them to call back later. The cur
tains were drawn, the lights were off and my
head was submerged beneath my large, black
comforter. Sunlight did not enter the equation.
I didn't bother to eat lunch, and when dinner
time rolled around, I postponed my physical
cravings until my stomach finally told me point
blank that it would rebel if 1 didn't nourish it.
Now you may be thinking, "Go ahead.
Deny the world. Avoid reality. Fine. But some
of us have real lives to lead and will not be in
timidated into feeling bad about doing so."
And these are valid thoughts. I understand
working, studying, eating, shopping, etc.; I do
them with surprising regularity. Yet after lis
tening to l ycia's new album, "Cold," 1 was
overwhelmed with indulgence for normally
unacceptable patterns. Sorrow and inertia

seemed like beautiful, noble qualities of which
I wanted to partake.
Sometime within the past few years, Lycia
moved from Arizona to Ohio, and the title
"Cold" is perhaps a reflection of their new sur
roundings, both psychically and literally. None
of Lycia's albums have been particularly up
beat, and this one does not break the pattern.
However, the addition of more female vocals
(by Tara Van Flower) creates contrast within
the downward emotions, making it sing like the
falling of an early snow.
Lycia's music is undefinable. Categorically,
it would probably be filed under ethereal, but
that gives the uninitiated listener little idea of
what it sounds like. After listening to songs like
"Bare," the closest analogy 1 can come up with
is angels in mourning.
So light a candle, lie down, remember and
cry if you must. Slip into the Lycia mentality:
"It's late and I am here .... This night is mine
to keep/ My perfect quiet place ... It's late and
I'm at peace."
