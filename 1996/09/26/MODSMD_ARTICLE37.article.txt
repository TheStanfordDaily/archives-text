# NEUROTIC OUTSIDERS
## 
### 
Of all the strange consequences of punk's
media revival, the rise of the Neurotic Out
siders may rank as one of the most bizarre.
Led by the Sex Pistols' Steve lones and featur
ing Matt Sorum and Duff McKagan of Guns
and Roses and Duran Duran bassist lohnnv
(nee John) Taylor, the Outsiders began as a
party band for 1..A. hipsters, rocking Sol.il
glitterati at trendy clubs like Johnny Depp's
Viper Room. Things should have ended there.
After all, how can the person responsible tor
"Rio" and "Hungry Like The Wolf' be taken
seriously as a punk? The music industry is al
ways hungry for novelty, however, and 19%
finds the Neurotic Outsiders, with a Maverick
Records debut and a video in MTV rotation,
joining the already crowded race for punk su
perstardom.
In some respects, the Outsiders seem to have
what it takes. Regardless of their punk creden
tials, the members of this band are experienced
musicians, and while much of the album is
plodding anil sludgy, a few tracks, like "Angeli
na" or "Jerk," the current single, are catchy
enough to warrant a second listen. A bigger

problem is posed by the band's lyric content.
Jones seems to have trouble getting beyond a
line-by-line rhyme scheme, and, as song titles
like "Nasty Ho" and "Feelings Are Ciood" sug
gest, we aren't exactly dealing with American
Music Club here. Jones and Co. seem primari
ly interested in striking a pose, assuming an at
titude of toughness, and most songs seem as
though they exist to satisfy this purpose, their
lyrics ready-made to snarl at the camera during
the video shoot.
Is this punk? Nowadays, as bands like
(ioldfinger and the Offspring milk the word
into million-dollar contracts and stadium
tours, punk often seems to be no more than
cool hair, lots of tattoos and "being hard," and
this album doesn't provide anything to chal
lenge that idea. But if punk still means any
thing, if the hard work and passion bands like
Fugazi, Citizen Fish, or Bisybackson put into
their music still counts, then Neurotic Out
siders have more in common with their former
glam rock and hair metal colleagues than the\
do with their newly donned "punk mantle.
