# Nuggets of wisdom from the leader of the free world
## Clinton underwhelms with campaign season literature 
### Elizabeth Goldman 
For anyone who follows politics regularly,
there is no need to read President Clinton's new
book, "Between Hope and History: Meeting
America's Challenges for the 21st Century."
The book is little more than a glorified
speech — a chance, finally, for the President to
present a discourse as long as he wants on his
favorite topics. It breaks no ground, revives a
familiar image of Clinton and is so dumbed
down as to be insulting.

Book Review

But the book is not directed to a politically
informed Stanford student. For the audience it
serves, it is a clear guide to the President's beliefs
and goals. It can't hurt for him to explain one
more time where America should be headed.
At first, the book, in all its 178 pages, seems
a little intimidating. It's unclear why someone
would take the time to peruse the pages, finding
out little more than can be explained in a hand
ful of soundbites on the evening news.
The task doesn't seem so formidable, how
ever, once the book is opened. With large type
and wide margins, Clinton makes his text ac
cessible to one and all.
l ie is set up as an established author in the
first few pages. The book is copyrighted to
"William Jefferson Clinton," the more distin
guished brother of the neighborly "Bill," and an
early page notes books "also by Bill Clinton."
The list is short: "Putting People First" (with A 1
Gore).
Once the actual body of the book begins, the
plot proves to be distressingly thin.
The book's setup is as simple as its layout.
There is an introduction, followed by the body
— chapters on opportunity, responsibility and
community — and finally a conclusion. It's a
perfect high school English paper.
The formula continues within the chapters.

Statistics and facts are carefully interspersed
with anecdotes to give the book a human touch.
Each paragraph, no doubt, has an easily identi
fiable topic sentence.
Just in case people haven't yet caught on to
the major theme (Republicans: bad; Democ
rats: good), Clinton takes care to make use of
frequent repetition.
On page 9, for example, he mentions that his
administration helped cut the budget deficit
from $290 billion to $117 billion. Ten pages
later, a reminder pops up, lest the reader forget
what that shockingly high deficit was.
Over and over again, Clinton implies cur
rent problems began during the 12 years before
he took office. And references are equally fre
quent to the President's successes, such as the
AmcriCorps programs, and to his plans, such as
tax breaks to help cover college tuition.
Opportunity, responsibility and communi
ty are defined pretty much as would be expect
ed. But if the reader already knows what these
three key terms mean, Clinton has included
some hidden treasures of knowledge.
In the chapter on opportunity, for example,
he gives a basic lesson in economics — and
wouldn't it be easier to get that from a $ 16 book
than by paying Stanford tuition?
Economic change, Clinton elaborates for
the masses, is driven by changes "in what we
produce, in how we produce, in who produces
and in how well we produce."
John Taylor, move over.
But again, it's not really fair to complain
about Clinton's style because the people he has
to reach arc not the ones who have a university
level education.
In fact, the President probably expects few
people to sit down and read the book. What's
more important is his photograph on the cover
staring out from bookstore shelves all across
the country. And the timing was good: The
book was released late enough to capitalize on
the patriotic spirit of the Olympics (as it does in

the introduction) but early enough to give
Clinton face time before Election Day.
The book, while it may not be particularly
stimulating, inevitably does more good than
harm. People reading the text to find out more
about the man leading the country gain from its
printing, as does Clinton himself.

If nothing else, the President shows that he
believes books arc important — a fact too often
forgotten in today's multimedia world. That he
took the time to create a good, old-fashioned
book and that he believes Americans deserve
more effort than a soundbite speak volumes for
Clinton's true beliefs.
