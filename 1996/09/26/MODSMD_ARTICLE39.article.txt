## 'Standing' Alone 
### 
Warren Hill's adaptation has Style, but Bruce
Willis comes up short as samurai-inspired
hero in new version of Kurosawa classic

In the tradition of'9os Hollywood film production (think "Pulp Fiction"),
"Last Man Standing" comes off as unimpressively derivative.
The film is an adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's I9M renowned creation, "Yo
jimbo." "Yojimbo," which takes place in the wake of feudal Japan, follows a wan
dering samurai who chances upon a town wrought with savagery and corruption.
A dying hamlet controlled by a local silk merchant / gambling big man and a local
sake dealer / pimp-daddy, this town serves as the site ofexhaustion: of feudalism,
of civil order and of moral scruples.
The only thing which thrives herein is the logic of violence — a logic which in
evitably must collapse upon itself when the cynical, self-appointed samurai or
chestrates the destruction of both groups. At the conclusion of this blackly hu
morous parody of Hollywood westerns, the samurai waxes: "Now we'll havea lit
tle quiet in this town."
Director Walter I lill acquired the rights to this classic film in 1 C )K8 and refash
ioned Kurosawa's storv into a highly stylized Western gangster tale. Jericho, the
nearly abandoned, gang-controlled West Texan town, replaces the warring
Japanese hamlet. Instead of gambling and prostitution, the savagery and corrup
tion in "l ast Man Standing" originates with Prohibition and mafia competition
in the 19205. Most importantly, the protagonist, the samurai (or "bodyguard," as
the translation of the title would indicate), assumes the form of lone-star crimi
nal, John Smith.
Played by Bruce Willis, the samurai-inspired character of Smith barely apes
the tough-guy image which "l.ast Man Standing" attempts to evoke. At the open
ing of the film, he narrates his Manichean philosophy on life, whereby the good
and the bad coexist, but the bad usually prevails, even if the good "finds its way,
by some chance."
Spinning an empty bottle of Jim Beam at a crossroad, Smith takes the road to
Jericho and, by this very "chance, becomes an agent in the town's violent gang
war. His cunning, like the Yojimbo samurai's, leads the two gangs to their demise,
but it is a tlat cunning. Nowhere does Smith appear to be more than a monolith
ic Western hero who merely thinks that "those people (the Stro//i and Doyle
gang members) were better oft dead." "Last Man Standing," thus, seems but a
recipe for a Western with occasional twinge of Gangsta Hollywood.
