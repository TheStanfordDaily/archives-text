# Changes in advising system well received
## 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Major changes implemented last
spring to revamp the University fresh
man advising system have been favorably
received, Undergraduate Advising Center
Advising Consultant Hector Cuevas said
yesterday.
In order to help better acquaint fresh
men with the many academic options at
Stanford, two team advising pilot pro
grams were added to Otero House and
Kimball Hall, and e-mail and telephone
hotlines connected to the advising center
were installed over the summer. In addi
tion, the head advising associate position
has been modified.
"We have had really positive feedback

on these changes from many members of
the Stanford community," Cuevas said.
He added that faculty members have
told him they are pleased that the recom
mendations part of the report the
provost's Advising Task Force delivered
last November — have been put in place.
"So many times, you will be working
for one to two years on a large report, and
the recommendations included in the re
port never get implemented," Cuevas
said.
Beginning this year, Otero and Kimball
will utilize a multi-tiered structure of ad
vising that aims to provide "high-quality
advising" to resident freshmen. Rather
than relying on one faculty adviser, fresh-
men will be able to employ the ex
pertise of a diverse team of faculty
and staff members, Cuevas said.
In addition, each dorm will
have a professional adviser from
the UAC to answer questions
that dorm-based personnel can
not.
"The advising team will work
together to allow students to gain
knowledge from a variety of
sources," said Cuevas, the UAC
adviser for Otero.
John Rickford, professor of
linguistics and resident fellow at
Kimball, said it is too early in the
year to assess the efficacy of the
new advising teams.
"It is much too soon to know
how well [the team] will do, but I
expect it to be terrific," Rickford
said.
At the end of the year, Cuevas
said the UAC will assess the pilot
program and could possibly insti
tute the teams in other dorms
across campus.

In addition, the UAC estab
lished a telephone hotline and e
mail "froshline" from the middle
of May to the first day of Orienta
tion to field inquiries from in
coming students, Cuevas said.
The hotline, staffed by UAC ad
visers and head AAs, received
about 1,000 calls in four months
on topics ranging from major re
quirements to Advanced Place
ment credit.
Mona Parandkar, head AA for
Naranja and a hotline staffer,
said most calls came from con
cerned parents than eager stu
dents.
Aside from the advising teams
and hotlines, the UAC also decid
ed to compensate head AAs this
year, paying them a $2,500
salary.
Although the salary drew larg
er number of applicants this
year, money was not a contribut
ing factor in deciding to advise
freshmen, Parandkar said.
"I had this same position last
year, and I really enjoyed being a
head AA," Parandkar said. "The
extra money made no difference
in this year's decision."
