# Sisterhood is Powerful
## Three Medeas cook up revenge in sly, funny 'First Wives Club' 
### 
Grab some of your friends, a bite to eat and, of course, some
popcorn, and get out to see "The First Wives Club." OK, maybe
you'll have to scratch that idea if you happen to be male, or if you
happen to have several male pals you planned to take along. But
if you're a woman, this hot new flick is definitely worth a night
out on the town — let's say, a girls' night out.
With an all-star female cast, "The first Wives Club" is a
pleasant change to this summer's testosterone-based action
films. Of course I loved this summer's thrillers, but a refreshing
new comedy with a female cast is a great way to welcome the fall.
First, there is Flise (Goldie Hawn), a well-to-do actress who
can no longer find roles that suit her tastes and has now turned
into a paranoid alcoholic. Although Flise is stunningly attrac
tive, she still yearns for a wee bit more collagen to tidy herself up.

Her husband has left her for a younger woman.
Next, there's Brenda (Bette Midler). Brenda's just an ordi
nary lewisli lady, with an ordinary Jewish teen-age son. She's a
compulsive eater who has pictures of overweight women taped
to the fridge.
Her husband has left her for a younger woman.
Finally, there's Annie (Diane Keaton),a soft spoken middle
aged woman who has a problem expressing anger. For this rea
son, among many others, she is seeing a psychotherapist. And
oh, her daughter is a lesbian.
Annie and her husband are separated.
Although the three women were close friends in college, they
have since lost touch with one another. They are reunited at the fu
neral of their friend (lynthia, who was part of the college foursome.
Cynthia hit bottom after her husband left her for another
woman.
Soon after the luncheon, the three wild and cra/y musketeers

set out for revenge on the husbands that left them — step one:
form the First Wives Club.
No one can argue that this movie is funny. It's really funnv.
And when you combine this comedy with an audience that's
cheering and clapping at every humorous scene, the movie is
quite enjoyable.
It is, however, rather convenient that all four women would
end up in marriages to men who would later leave them . . what
a coincidence.
Nevertheless, the men who were in the audience when I saw the
film didn't seem offended. They were laughing right along with all
of the women at the plight of these three "wronged" characters.
Even though the movie is fun for everybody, overall, the
movie is much better suited for a female audience. It is a storv
about women — and I think a woman can relate to the three
characters in a way that a man cannot.
