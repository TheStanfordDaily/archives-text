## Tucci's Film a 'Big' Disappointment Much-hyped indie fails to serve a whole meal 
### 
Inside I Primi, the appetizer course of Stanley Tucci
and Cameron Scott's "Big Night," "are the best things in
life." This dish, II Timpano, would like to be the
metaphor for directors Tucci and Scott's entire debut
film; unfortunately, the best things in life prove too large
a casserole for Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo
(Tucci) — the brothers Pilaggi — to handle in this slug
gish and sentimental film.
"Big Night" is the story of these two immigrant Italian
brothers and their struggling Jersey shore restaurant.
Primo, the chef, is a culinary purist who comically can
not bear to serve a side of spaghetti with his risotto, be
cause "what would [someone) want with two starches?"
His brother Secondo (Tucci) manages their failing
restaurant. With $62 left in their bank account, Secon
do generates the film's main story line by arranging for
a one-night blowout with famous Italian singer Louis
Prima as the guest of honor, under the premise that the
favorable reviews will turn their business around.
At this point, the Hollywood version of the movie
would've gone one of two ways: It would've become a
heartwarming talc of coming out ahead, against the
odds and riding Primo's formidable talents, or it
would've taken the second road and made the dinner a

comic disaster and still have the brothers somehow luck
out of their plight at the end of the night. "Big Night,"
however, indulges a third, more true-to-life option and
thus circumvents these limiting Hollywood archetypes.
Yet "Big Night" can't succeed on this minor innovation
alone.
Luckily, Isabella Rossellini lends a hand, brilliantly
playing Gabriella, Secondo's lover, and she becomes the
character upon whom the entire plot moves — she pro
vides the fictional grease in this film's remarkably rusted
gears and is left solely responsible for speckling every
major hole in the plot.
Rossellini's talent is complemented by Scott's "Bob
the Cadillac Salesman" character — brilliantly acted and
even more brilliantly filmed — yet even Scott can do
nothing to push his own movie along.
Ultimately, the movie becomes a milder retelling of
Beckctt's "Godot" with the brothers Pilaggi as Vladimir
and tetragon, Scott as Pozzo and Louis Prima as the
West's most famous no-show, the absentee Godot. 1 low
ever, there are a number of obvious reasons (perhaps
missed by writers Tucci and Joseph Tropiano) why Beck
ctt didn't set "Godot" in 1950s New Jersey.
"Big Night" offers some delicious shots of cooking and
eating, and even had me believing that Primo may well
have been the best chef in the world. However, not even
its very fine acting and often stunning cinematography
can hold the film together.

Isabella Rossellini brings that Bergman-ian class to her character
Gabriella, but even she can't save the "Night."
