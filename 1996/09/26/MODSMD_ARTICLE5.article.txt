## Friends recall Roger Gray as a 'path maker' who contributed plenty to the institute and to Stanford 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer 
Roger W. Gray, an emeritus pro
fessor at the Food Research Institute
died Sept. 5 in Monterey at age 75. He
had suffered a stroke in June.
Gray was a path maker, said Jef
frey Williams, director of the insti
tute. He was among the second gen
eration of a growing field of economic
analysts dedicated to studying agri
cultural futures markets.

A member of the faculty since 1954, Gray was re
membered by Walter Falcon, director of the Institute
for International Studies, as a poetic spokesman for his
profession.
"He wrote and spoke with engaging wit and skill on
topics of profound technical importance, but —
through his gift for metaphor and irony — was able to

convey his thoughts and findings while enterta ling
any audience," Falcon said.
Falcon also remembered Gray's extensive vocabu
lary — one to which Falcon fell victim during many
games of Scrabble.
Williams said Gray also worked very hard for the
places to which he devoted his life. "He has made sig
nificant contributions to his institute and his universi
ty," Williams said.
Gray raised funds from grain traders to endow a
chair in honor of the late Prof. Holbrook Working — a
chair he later held.
His efforts, however, were not able to prevent the
institute's closure, announced last year, a defeat he did
not accept happily, according to Williams.
Gray received his undergraduate and master's de
grees from the University of Colorado before complet
ing his doctoral studies at the University of Michigan.

He worked as a research assistant
at the U.S. Department of Agricul
ture and an assistant economist
with Bank of America.
A past president of the Western
Agricultural Economics Associa
tion, Gray served as a principal ad
viser to the Chicago Board of
Trade, the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Na

tions and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.
During his tenure on the
Farm, Gray served as a member
of the Faculty Senate, president
of the Faculty Club and a resi
dent fellow.
He is survived by his wife, three
children, three stepchildren, 10
grandchildren and three great
grandchildren.
A tribute in Gray's honor will be
held Oct. 5 at 3 p.m. in the Bowman
Alumni Grove, followed by a recep
tion at the Faculty Club.
