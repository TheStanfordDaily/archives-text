More than 100 students crowded into the main
lounge at Kimball Hall last night to listen to chem
istry postdoctoral student Simon Clement speak
about the possibility of life on Mars.
Clement, who received his doctoral degree in
chemistry at Stanford, is part of the research group
that grabbed the attention of media worldwide dur
ing the summer after reporting evidence that life ex
isted on Mars billions of years ago.
"I'm not going to try to convince you all. I'll let
you think and decide for yourself," said Clement,
who presented a Time magazine cover featuring the
controversial Mars debate to open discussion.
Clement showed the audience dozens of slides and
colorful pictures of his research laboratory. Among
them were crucial shots of sample rocks taken from
Mars that support the claim that life did indeed exist
on the red planet.
Clement showed a picture of an S-shaped shining
figure, showing gatherings of crystal pieces. He said

the best explanation for this sample was a biological
one.
"In organic things, crystals tend to have nice
smooth curves," explained Clement, adding that in
organic crystals are usually much bigger and sharp
er.
Clement presented other Martian samples to the
crowd, including pictures of magnetite crystals
which he said are presumably too small to be inor
ganic.
"Judging from the way he presented, it seems to
me that there's no doubt that there is life on Mars,"
said junior Omeed Rezaian. "That's way out of this
world."
According to Clement, the most logical and sim
plest — and the best — explanation for the features
observed in the samples is that there is life on Mars.
He said any one of these features can be explained in
organically, but the biological interpretation seems
to fit best.
"Bugs will produce all the features we have ob
served," Clement said. "No one process explains all
