Speaking for a single lecturc class at the
Graduate School of Business may not be worth
the expensive and time-consuming cross-coun
try trip that visiting scholars sometimes face.
The Business School has tried to solve this
dilemma by installing videoconferencing equip
ment as part of technological improvements
which have been put in place during the past two
su miners.

"We've been using phone conferences in the
past," said Business School Assoc. Dean Tim
Wei. "There's been an increased demand for
that We thought, 'Why not go the next step?' "
In Rooms 70 and 80 at the Business School,
black video consoles replace the standard lec
ture tables Each console is equipped with a
YCK and a Pentium computer with Internet ac
cess. Both project images on to the classroom
screen.

Black video consoles equipped with VCRs and Pentium computers with Internet access have been in
stalled in two rooms at the Graduate School of Business as part of a technology upgrade. The ma
chines can project images onto a screen.
; "We're not only building the
ability to do videoconferencing but
also computer-based teaching,"
Wei said. "This system is very so
phisticated, yet very easy to use."
Wei said he considers these
two classrooms a test run. He
plans to "do two rooms first, get
faculty feedback, then fine-tune
the rough edges."
The classrooms were finished

Tuesday. Faculty are currently
being "walked through" for
their input.
"Tho general feedback has
been very positive," he said.
In order to initially prepare
for the upgrade, a project team
was sent to the business schools
at Harvard University, UCLA
and UC-Berkeley to examine
their technological programs.
"We borrowed some ideas
from them. This is not a totally
original idea, but we did ask
them what they would have
done differently," Wei said.
