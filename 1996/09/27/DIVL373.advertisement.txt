Consider a Linguistics Course this Fall
Linguistics tries to understand the miracle of language, why can a child of
four, who can't even add three and five, still perform extraordinarily com
plex speech operations that the most sophisticated computers can't? Why is
it that all human languages have certain structural properties in common?
What role does language play in differentiating people by social class,
ethnicity, and sex? What are the systematic differences between dialects and
other varieties of language?
Here are some reasons why students find linguistics exciting:
• Students in introductory courses can be trained to do original research
• The data for linguistic investigation is all around you in daily life, in cafete
rias and restaurants, on TV, in party conversations, etc.
• Linguistics courses are intellectually stimulating and FUN
