## Life and legacy of Evan Chen observed at service 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Friends and family gathered yester
day in Memorial Church to celebrate the
memory of Evan Chen.
Chen, who would have been a junior at
the Farm this year, died July 28 at Stan
ford Medical Center after a long struggle
with leukemia and complications from a
bone marrow transplant last October.
Family members and friends remem
bered Chen's strength of character
throughout his illness.
"I feel fortunate that I had a brother
like him," said his sister, junior Emily
Chen. "I will always remember his
strength and humor even when his body

was suffering."
Chen was remembered for his many
contributions to campus life, including
his membership in the Lambda Phi Ep
silon fraternity. Chen had an interest in
engineering and biology and was a mem
ber of the varsity fencing team.
Dean of Students Marc Wais recalled
meeting Chen at a party commemorating
the fifth anniversary of the Asian Ameri
can Bone Marrow Transplant Program.
"He really didn't like the spotlight," he
said. "What struck me the most was how
modest and humble he was."
Chen's struggle with biphenotypic
leukemia, a rare form of cancer, began in
May 1995 and resulted in an internation
al search for a donor for a bone marrow

transplant. Although a donor was found
in July 1995, Chen's body developed graft
vs. host disease, or "GVH," in which the
body rejects the donated marrow.
Yul Kwon, Chen's roommate, spear
headed a campus-wide effort to find a
donor for Chen. As a result, more than
1,000 people in the area were blood-

typed, and the efforts at finding a
donor caught the heart of the
community. More than 20 cancer
victims were matched with poten
tial donors through the search.
"Through Evan's life there is
hope for more people," Wais said
"His life did have meaning."
Kwon struggled to define exactly
what it was that made his besl
friend so special.

"Why was he so unique? Why
was he such a good friend?" Kwon
asked. "He never pretended to be
anything he wasn't."
Eliot Loh, a fraternity brother,
remembered that there was some
thing special about Chen.
"We try to be objective in the way
we treat every member," he said.
"We try to play no favorites. But
when most of us think of Evan, he
was the favorite."
Recalling Chen's propensity for
talking quickly, Kwon wished he
was able to rememlx?r more of his
time with his best friend since ju

nior high.
"I remember the first time I met
Evan I couldn't understand a word
he said. I really wish I had tried
harder."
In lieu of flowers, the Chen fam
ily has requested that contribu
tions be sent to his memorial fund.
Checks made payable to Stanford
University should be sent to the
Office of Development, Gift Pro
