## Fighting continues in Mideast Death toll reaches 55 in clash between Israelis and Palestinians 
### 
.JERUSALEM (AP) — Their fragile
peace going up in thick black smoke,
Palestinian police and Israeli troops
fought with automatic weapons yester
day at holy sites and in the streets of the
West Bank and Gaza, where thousands
of Palestinians burned tires, threw
stones and called for a revolution.
With at least 38 Palestinians and 11
Israelis killed in one day, the pitched
level of violence surpassed that of the
worst days of the six-year "intefadeh"
— the Palestinian revolt against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
that ended in 1993 with a breakthrough
peace accord.
At least 43 Palestinians, 11 Israelis
and one Egyptian army officer have
been killed since the clashes began
Tuesday, bringing the three-day death
toll to 55.
Embattled areas yesterday resem
bled war zones, with smoke from burn
ing tires blackening skies dotted by
Israeli helicopter gunships.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
returned to Israel yesterday and went
into an emergency cabinet meeting on

the crisis, cutting short a three-day trip
to Europe.
He tried to arrange a quick meeting
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
stop the fighting. Arafat told
Netanyahu he saw no point in meeting
unless Netanyahu presented concrete
proposals for implementing the peace
agreements.
Israel television and radio stations
reported that efforts were under way to
arrange a meeting of the two leaders
with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in Cairo today. The Egyptian
news agency MENA said the meeting
would probably take place next week in
Cairo.
The reports could not be immediate
ly confirmed.
Despite opposition from the United
States, the U.N. Security Council called
a formal session today to discuss the
mounting violence.
In street battles in the garbage
strewn alleys of Gaza and the rocky hill
tops of the West Bank, Palestinian
police in fatigues hunched behind trees
and walls as they fired assault rifles and

hurled firebombs at helmeted Israeli
soldiers who responded with heavy
bursts of gunfire.
Traditionally, Palestinians have used
stones in their battles with armed
Israeli troops. The involvement of the
Palestinian police force, created under
the peace accord, has made the most
recent clashes more deadly.
Casualties mounted in part yester
day because many of the Palestinian
police shot wildly and, unlike the
Israelis, had no flak jackets.
In the West Bank town of Nablus, a
fierce gun battle between Palestinian
police and Israeli troops broke out after
thousands of Palestinians stormed
Joseph's Tomb, a Jewish seminary. Six
Israeli troops and a Palestinian were
killed.
After the remaining Israeli troops
guarding the tiny enclave were over
whelmed, protesters celebrated by set
ting fire to their jeeps and an armored
personnel carrier. Trapped in the com
pound, some of the Israelis lit candles
and one kissed a Torah, or Jewish holy
book, in prayers for deliverance.
