# Gingrich investigation expanded
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
House ethics committee voted
unanimously yesterday to expand
an investigation of Speaker Newt
Gingrich, to include whether he
provided "accurate, reliable and
complete information" to the com
mittee on the college course he
taught.
Reading the carefully worded
text of the committee statement,
Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo.,
offered her translation: "That says
they think he lied," she said.
In a case steeped in election
year politics, the subcommittee
running the probe said it also will
examine whether Gingrich used
resources of a private, tax-exempt
foundation for official purposes —
strictly prohibited by House rules.
In the last two weeks,
Democrats have trooped to House
microphones to denounce Gingrich

as unethical and demand that the
committee release a summary of
evidence prepared by James M.
Cole, the outside counsel hired for
the investigation. The summary
was not released.
The expansion makes it likely
that the investigation will continue
after the November election,
although the subcommittee — with
authority to fde formal charges -
said it planned to complete its work
by the end of the year.
If the subcommittee of two
Democrats and two Republicans
fdes charges, the remainder of the
ethics committee — three more
members from each party — would
decide whether Gingrich violated
House rules. Only the full House
could administer a major punish
ment.
Cole, hired last December, has
been investigating whether the

course Gingrich taught from 1993-
95 was a political activity that vio
lated tax laws.
The course — and a satellite
hookup that beamed the lectures to
Gingrich's financial backers — was
financed through tax-exempt foun
dations. Donors could deduct their
contributions from their taxable
income.
"Certain facts have been discov
ered in the course of the prelimi
nary inquiry which the subcom
mittee has determined merit fur
ther inquiry," said a written state
ment prepared by the subcommit
tee.
The committee had already
alerted reporters it would have an
announcement in connection with
the 20-month Gingrich investiga
tion when the speaker released a
letter asking the panel to make its
decision public.
