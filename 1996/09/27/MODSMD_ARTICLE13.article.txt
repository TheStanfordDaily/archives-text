Senate upholds abortion veto
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate upheld
President Clinton's veto of legislation that for the
first time in two decades would have made a form of
abortion illegal.
But supporters of the ban on so-called partial
birth abortions vowed yesterday to keep the issue
alive during the election campaign.
Afler a wrenching debate, the Senate voted 57-41
to override the president's veto of the bill banning
the late-term abortion procedure, falling nine votes
short of the two-thirds majority needed.
"The most anti-choice Congress in history tried to
hand a pro-choice president an embarrassing defeat
less than six weeks before election day. Their cam
paign failed," said Kate Michelman of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
But abortion opponents said they had struck a
political nerve that would continue to be felt. "This
will immediately become one of the most powerful
issues of the fall election," said Senate Majority

Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
Klaas killer sentenced
SAN JOSE, Calif. tAP) - The killer of Polly
Klaas enraged her family even as he was being con
demned to death yesterday with a wild claim that
the 12-year-old girl's last words were that she had
been molested by her father.
Marc Klaas shouted obscenties, lunged at his
daughter's killer and was hustled out of the court
room. Polly's grandmother wailed aloud and wept,
leaning against her husband in shock.
Richard Allen Davis was sent to California's
death row at San Quentin Prison for killing Polly
after kidnapping her from a slumber party in the
bedroom of her Petaluma home Oct. 1, 1993. A
nationwide search for Polly ended when Davis led
police to her body in December.
Moments before his formal sentencing, the 42-
year-old career criminal criticized his investigators
and lawyers in a rambling speech.
