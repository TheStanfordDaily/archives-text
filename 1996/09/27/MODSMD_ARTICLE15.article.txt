Much of the building
could have been done
over the past summers

STANFORD'S BEAUTY has
never failed to generate awe
from tourists and photogra
phers. But the constant construc
tion all around campus has trans
formed the Farm from a pic
turesque postcard cover into
something resembling a battle
zone.
Without question, much of the
activity is necessary. The massive
damage caused by the Loma Pri
eta Earthquake nearly seven
years ago still has not been
entirely repaired. With the glacial
pace of structural upgrades, one
has to wonder why more could
not have been done over recent
summers, when far fewer stu
dents were present.
Since fall quarter 1995, the
scope of construction has escalat
ed dramatically. After a period of
relatively little activity, the cam
pus suddenly seemed as if a child
had just been given a set of Tin
kertoys and played with all of
them at once. While the Lan
guage Corner received a long
awaited upgrade to repair dam
age caused by a temblor that had
occurred several years ago, the
Gates Computer Science Building
was erected in a flash.
But both projects caused a
year-long hazard for members of
the Stanford community. The
walkways along the south and
east edges of the Main Quad,
already too narrow for their
everyday congested traffic, were
reduced by a fence that separated
the work area from the walkway.
The Gates Building's erection
limited access significantly to the
northwest portion of campus as
well, forcing automobile traffic
by Building 380.
The construction has persisted
into this year, continuing through
Orientation weekend. As new stu

dents entered the University
through Palm Drive, they saw a
huge green tarp before they could
take in a view of Memorial
Church. If they came in on
Embarcadero Road, they could
follow Galvez Street only to Cam
pus Drive because the remainder
of the road was closed to traffic.
The southwest portion of cam
pus, still waiting for cable televi
sion and in-room connections,
has more than its fair share of
work. Students in Governor's
Corner who already have long
walks to class now have long
walks to their vehicles, as well,
due to work in their parking lot.
And the removal of the Manzani
ta trailers has turned that area of
campus into a noisy construction
zone, too.
In addition to all the building
repairs, streets have been upgrad
ed, too. For starters, Escondido
Road was repaved earlier this
month. More troublesome areas,
especially places closed to auto
motive traffic but sprawling with
bicyclists, remain a bumpy ride.
The timing of the construc
tion, not the motive, should be
questioned. In the long run,
Stanford will be a better, safer
and more beautiful place. But the
short-term sacrifice is great, and
current upperclassmen will likely
not be around when the work set
tles down, nor will they be pre
sent at the grand opening of the
Science and Engineering Quad.
Arriving freshmen, on the
other hand, were surprised to see
that the lovely campus they had
been promised in brochures and
admissions packets actually
looked rather shabby in its cur
rent state of upheaval.
Nonetheless, while orange
signs litter the campus and Stern
Hall remains an indescribable
color, Stanford still retains some
beauty, only more subtly than
before.
But the Stanford we knew
upon our arrival will certainly be
drastically different from the one
we leave behind.
