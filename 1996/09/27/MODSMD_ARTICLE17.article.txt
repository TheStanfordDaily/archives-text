## Lisa Anfield Another Olympic dream come true 
### 
This summer, i
did something
that I never even
dreamed of doing: I sang
at the Olympic Games.
Performing with Tal
isman has been the
highlight of my Stanford
career, but our trip to
Atlanta in July sur-

passed any opportunity I imagined par
ticipation in a Stanford student group
might bring.
Our entourage convened in early July
in sweltering Montgomery, Ala., where
we frolicked, rehearsed and soaked up
Southern hospitality. Our host in Mont
gomery was Young Boozer, a colorful,
vivacious Southern banker and Stanford
alum with a distinct Alabama twang. We
were treated to the best the South has to
offer, taking in some theater ("To Kill a
Mockingbird"), some great barbecue and
touring the sites where Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. established the civil
rights movement.
The highlight of our Montgomery days
came one Sunday when we performed at
Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist
Church — the church where Dr. King
preached for six years, organized the
Montgomery bus boycott and ended the
famed Selma-to-Montgomery march. It
was the most inspirational concert set
ting we ever faced.
Then came Atlanta.
Armed with two vans, cellular phones
and a distinct lack of sleep, we rolled into

the madness. The city was strewn with
splashes of brilliant colors in the form of
banners, flags, billboards and lights.
Sidewalks everywhere bustled with
hordes of celebratory international
tourists. Clicks and clacks of every lan
guage on earth must have been spoken as
we walked around Olympic Park. We
couldn't believe we were actually at the
Olympics.
Our first concert was in the heart of
the Centennial Olympic Village — tem
porary home to the world's greatest ath
letes. We sang an hour-long set on a
stage in the middle of the Village, and we
ended up dancing and taking pictures
with a group of South Africans and Aus
tralians.
The next day, we were filmed by NBC
as we prepared for our second show in
the Village. As we sang, a group of Croa
tians started dancing behind us, proudly
waving their flags. We sold albums to the
many athlete listeners and saw our music
instantly spread to every corner of the
globe. I never thought my voice would be
heard in countries I had never even
heard of. Quite a thrill.
We were lucky to avoid Centennial
Park the night of the bomb. We had
planned to sing an impromptu concert
there, but we decided to dance the night
away with George Clinton at an athlete
party instead. As security flooded
Atlanta, we sang our final concert at a
Stanford reception and bid farewell to
the 1996 Games.
People always tell you that when you

go to a school like Stanford, doors are
open to you. This is one of those doors.
Talisman has allowed me to sing on sev
eral CDs, be on national television and
radio and, now, participate in one of the
world's largest spectacles.
We were remarkably well received at
the Olympics. The fluid performance
camaraderie of African Americans, Asian
Americans, Native Americans and Cau
casians elicited a warm reaction from
southern and international audiences.
Here was a group of bright multi-ethnic
young people, bringing forth substantive,
lively music. We made nearly $7,000 in
album sales in just 10 days and gathered
a fan list that we hope to stay in touch
with and even perform to one day in the
future. The trip reinforced to us the
importance of why we sing, what we sing
and what we hope to accomplish as a
group of young student performers.
Our trip was a great success. Our gen
erous Stanford alumni hosts down
South, Young Boozer and Sandy Smith,
and supporters Helen Bing and Mary
Edmonds were central in bringing this
trip to fruition. Upon our return, Presi
dent Gerhard Casper even wrote us a
personal thank you for representing the
University to the world.
Yes, it was a once in a lifetime experi
ence. Then again, if Sydney 2000 comes
calling, we'll be ready to roll Down Under
for a twice in a lifetime gig.
