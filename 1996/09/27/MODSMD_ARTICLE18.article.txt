# Compadres ad offensive to Mexican culture and people
## 
### 
IN THE SEPT. 20 issue of Intermis
sion, an advertisement from the local
Compadres Mexican Bar and Grill
appeared on page two. The restaurant's
marketing division seems to think that
all the Mexican the 13,500 readers need
to know is captured in its ad — a sun
sporting shades, a cactus, two musical
instruments, a cocktail and a sombrero.
Where are the little frolicking drunken
men that usually appear in these ads?
As a Mexican, I am bothered by the
fact that Compadres chose to promote a
frivolous, stereotypical and inaccurate
characterization of Mexico. This is found

in their advertisement slogan "All the
Mexican You Need to Know" surround
ed by the graphic icons mentioned
above. This is not the first time careless
advertising has been used — remember
the little frolicking drunken men leaning
against the cacti?
I wager that they were not insinuat
ing that the cocktail icon represented
the diverse and savory cuisine found in
Mexico. Probably not.
Did the sombrero represent the rich
cultural traditions expressed in regional
outfits and typical dress? I am sure
that's not what Compadres had in mind.

What about the sun and the cactus —
is the consumer led to think that Mexico
has marvelous landscapes and ecosys
tems? Or is Compadres banking on the
free-wheeling spirit that many American
tourists seek down there?
Certainly the musical instruments
are symbols of Mexico's centuries of
musical heritage heard the world over.
Could it be instead that Compadres uses
the maracas and the drum to tease the
limbo out of us?
While I don't hold The Daily respon
sible, I do think that Compadres should
be more responsible and respectful in its

advertisements — especially when it's
often Mexicans or other Latino employ
ees who cook their food, clean their
restaurant and serve their meals. I don't
understand why the restaurant chain
would be so ignorant. Maybe after figur
ing out how to select an authentic Mexi
can menu, it can work on better adver
tising. I am not asking for a National
Geographic-like depiction of Mexico in
their promotions. Instead, I ask for
respect and responsible advertising from
Compadres.
