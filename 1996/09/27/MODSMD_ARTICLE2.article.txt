## Bookstore efforts decrease shoplifting 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
Theft recoveries at the Book
store have jumped nearly 300 per
cent over the last year due to a re
vamped security department.
The improved recovery rate
may result in a larger rebate for
students this year, Bookstore
Events Coordinator Tricia Keady
said.
The Bookstore's new loss pre
vention manager, John Petrick,
said the security department was
in need of much "professional
management" when he was hired

1 1/2 years ago. Problems stemmed
from inefficient use of equipment
and lack of trailing for security
employees, he said.
"Previously, the department
consisted almost totally of student
security agents," Petrick said.
"None of them had ever received
any training in the proper tech
niques of catching shoplifters."
According to Bookstore
records, $3,903 worth of stolen
merchandise was recovered be
tween Jan. 1 and Aug. 21 of this
year, compared to $1,064 recov-
ered during the same period last
year.
Police arrested suspects and re
covered merchandise an average
of once every 1.4 days in 1996.
This is about seven times more
frequent than 1995, when an ar
rest was made every 8.9 days.
"We've reduced the number of
people who work in security," said

Petrick, who formerly worked in
retail security at Macy's. "Howev
er, we've increased their proficien
cy because we can properly train
them."
Moving around existing securi
ty equipment also bolstered loss
prevention efforts. For example,
according to Petrick, cameras
placed where the computers used
to be were relocated to more useful
locations.
The Bookstore has opted not to
conduct backpack checks and door
alarms as it has in the past, in

favor of a more friendly, conve
nient security system for stu
dents.
"Our intention is not to incon
venience students," Ready said.
Backpack checks "are really in
convenient for all the customers
with the best of intentions. There
are really just a very few people
here to rip us off."
About half of all people appre
hended by Bookstore security have
no affiliation with the University,
Petrick said, and many are not
even from the immediate area.
