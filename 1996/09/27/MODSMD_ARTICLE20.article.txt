Please help me welcome
my guest prophet for the
NCAA football picks of
the week, a man who makes Pat
Buchanan look like Green
peace's member of the year, it's
Stanford's favorite arch-con
servative demagogue W.
Glenn Campbell.
As the former Director of the
Hoover Institution and a Uni
versity of California Regent,
Dr. C has taken a few moments
away from his crusades against
things he doesn't like (possibly
including, but by no means lim
ited to, Stanford University,
the student body, most student
groups, the University faculty
and perhaps a good proportion
of the remaining population of
the earth) to try his political
hand at college football prog
nosticating.
My guess is that Dr. C will
find predicting football games
much more socially acceptable
than consistently opposing af
firmative action in higher edu
cation; then again, wasn't that
a stuffed replica of myself I saw
in the Cardinal football locker
room burning in effigy?
Oregon State at Cal
Say hello to one of the Cali
fornia Bears' last victories of
the season. With a defense
ranked 109 th out of 111 Divi
sion I-A schools, the Bears are
fortunate indeed to be 3-0 at
this juncture; having played
three teams that couldn't beat
a blindfolded Stanford Philoso
phy Club on the gridiron, the
victories make a bit more sense.
But rest assured that Cal's luck
will perish along with its un
beaten record as soon as it
meets an opponent that knows
the difference between a foot
ball and a croquet mallet.
Fortunately for the Bears,
Oregon State does not fall into
that category.
The Beavers are downright
hideous, and that's an amelio
rating euphemism for the
squad's true abilities. As if
NCAA-record 25 consecutive
sub-.500 seasons wasn't
enough, OSU is riding a 13-
game losing streak and hasn't
won in two calendar years. The
word victory is no longer a part
of OSU's already limited vocab
ulary.
Campbell picks Cal in this
contest, but not for its superior
football talent. "I'd like to see
the Bears win," the Dr. says,
"just so we can all know early in
the season how bad they are
going to beat Stanford in Big
Game."
More tough fighting words
from a man who has lived and
died by his saber-tipped
tongue. Nevertheless, without
the benefit of using REAL
sabers of their own on the field,
the Beavers don't have Glenn
Campbell's chance at a Black
Panther rally to pull out the
victory.

Oregon at Arizona State
Psst. Don't look now, but
the Arizona State Sun Devils
actually don't suck.
I know it's hard to believe.

But temporarily suspend your
utter disbelief and picture it.
The Sun Devils are 3-0, they
just knocked off Nebraska, a
team that hadn't been beaten
in the regular season in three
years, and they're showing no
signs of letting down.
And then there's Oregon.
After breaking through the
boundaries of mediocrity and
shining for a moment, the
Ducks' cameo role in the script
of Pac-10 powers has come and
gone. And like an out-of-work
actor, the Oregon squad is
searching for consistency and
out of favor with its fans.
Dr. C, in another attempt to
separate the sports from pre
dicting college football games,
picks ASU â€” for political rea
sons. I guess the University of
Oregon is just too ideologically
liberal for his liking.
Although Abbie Hoffman,
Tom Ilayden and Jerry Garcia
won't be in the Ducks' starting
lineup on Saturday, Dr. C's po
litical pick makes sports sense.

Ohio State at Notre Dame
Notarotcard, Ouija board or
crystal ball in the world could
ever get me to bet against the
luck of the Irish again. I'm tired
of getting burned; let's face it,
the Fighting Irish always win.
No matter how much we hate
them.
But can they beat a Buckeye
squad that has outscored its op
ponents 142-7 in the last TWO
games?
Yes. Ohio State is another
one of those Tennessee-esque
squads that always seems to
falter when faced with the first
inklings of stiff competition.
The Buckeyes are like a wet
cardboard box: you can fill it
with all the weight in the world
as long as you don't try to move
it, but put any pressure on it at
all or try to pick it up and move
it forward, and it will complete
ly fall apart.
Notre Dame is going to leave
Ohio State so fiat that the
Buckeyes will need a few sturdy
boxes of their own to lug their
shattered egos back to Colum
bus.

Colorado at Texas A&M
The collective lobotomy that
seems to have been performed
on the entire Big 12 Confer
ence has left even perennially
good squads with lousy early
season records. Texas A&M is
no exception; the 1-2 Aggies
just picked up their first win of
the year last week against a
limp-wristed North Texas
team.
But both me and Dr. C
agree: It's time for the IV to
shut off and Texas A&M to
come out of their duped slum
ber.
