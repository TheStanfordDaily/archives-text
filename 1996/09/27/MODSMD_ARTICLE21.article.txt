# Spikers to strut stuff in Maples

### Ben Hur Staff writer 
There's just no place like home.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team will finally return to the
Farm in the Pacific 10 Conference
home opener tonight at 7:30 p.m.
against Washington State and to
morrow at 7 p.m. when it faces
Washington.
The Cardinai women have com
piled an astounding 35 straight vic
tories in Maples Pavilion dating
back to the 1993 season, including
the Pac-10 title-clincher over the
Cougars last year. After playing
three consecutive tough road
matches, the Stanford squad is
ready to return home and rack up
some more wins.
The lOth-ranked Cougars could
provide the No. 4 Cardinal with
some strategic problems. Although
not a big squad, Washington State
possesses a fast-paced offense and
has one of the highest hitting per
centages in the country. Stanford
will attempt to control the match
with aggressive serving and strong
passing, traits it has lacked during
its last few matches.
The Cardinal will then face
Washington on the following
evening, a team that has steadily
climbed in the rankings since the
beginning of the 1996 campaign.

The 18th-ranked Huskies have
one of the biggest and most physical
squads in the nation. Their huge
lineup has allowed the team to lead
the nation in blocking as well as
earning the 11uskies a reputation as
an excellent defensive squad.
Washington's offense has also
proved its effectiveness, racking up
more than 17 kills per game, which
places the team in the top five na
tionally.
Neither the Cougars nor the
Huskies have had much success
against Stanford, and both look to
this match as an opportunity to
exact vengeance against a Cardinal
team which has dominated them in
the past.
"We need to play with a little
more desire," said coach Don Shaw.
"Washington State has never beat
en us. They are very hungry."
The Stanford coaching staff has
put an extra emphasis on more con
sistent serving and passing by giv
ing the squad tougher serves to
handle dunng practice.
"In general, our practices have
become harder, and we've been
stepping up the intensity," said ju
nior setter Lisa Sharpley. "We're
realizing there is a whole new level
of energy necessary to compete at
the high level we want to be at.

Senior Eileen Murfee pounds the ball out of Texas' reach at the 1995
Final Four.
"This weekend should be a good
test," Sharpley said. "These iire
probably the top two teams in the
conference besides us."
The Cardinal's only loss of the
season occurred in Pacific's rowdy
gym, and the squad hopes the Stan
ford faithful will create an intimi
dating atmosphere for visitors.
"We're excited to play some
where where people are cheering
for us," Sharpley said. "We lost at
UOP, and then had some tough
wins in Arizona, so it will be nice to
be home with people who are sup
porting us."
Over the past cou pie seasons, op
posing squads have arrived on the
Farm fearing the Cardinal hitters,
but not the excitement of the fans.
"These are big matches for us,"
Shaw said. "The crowd plays a big
pail in firing us up. Ten years ago,
volleyball was the student's game,
and nobody really went to see bas
ketball. Now things have changed,
but I would like to see the students
out there to see the kind of volley
ball we play."
