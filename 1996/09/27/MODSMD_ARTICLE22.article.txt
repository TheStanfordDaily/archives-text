# Women's soccer to change losing trend
## Players, coach say squad can pick up wins in Arizona tourney 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
After dropping three of its last
four games, the Cardinal
women's soccer team looks to put
a couple notches in the win col
umn in Arizona this weekend as it
confronts conference rival Ari
zona today and Wyoming on Sun
day.
While each of those three loss
es have come to top-20 opponents
— No. 16 Duke, No. 1 North Car
olina and No. 3 Santa Clara — the
Cardinal team (4-3) has not been
executing as well as it would like.
Stanford hopes to put together
two solid performances in Ari
zona and step up its level of play
as the season wears on.
"It's definitely important to
get back on track, that's for
sure," said coach Steve Swanson.
"But I don't think we've been
playing poorly or are in a slump. I
actually think we're playing bet
ter now than we did in those
games we won at the beginning of
the season. We've played some
very tough teams, and we've
played them well."
But while the Cardinal has lost
more games than it might have if
it played an easier schedule,
Swanson said that the games
were good for his team and will
pay off in the long run.
"We found out a lot about our
selves as a team in those losses,"
said Swanson, who is in his first
year at Stanford's helm. "It's
good to play against the best and
to be in some emotional games. I
definitely believe that the
tougher schedule has helped us."
Last year, Stanford disman
tled Arizona in its final game of
the regular season. Sophomore
goalkeeper Erin Bryla recorded a
shutout, and the Cardinal attack
pounded in four goals against an
overmatched Wildcat team. How
ever, Arizona has won its last two
games and is not to be taken light-

ly, according to Swanson.
Wyoming, on the other hand, is
in only its second season as a var
sity program. Last year the Cow
girls were winless.
"These are games we can win,"
said sophomore Christy Stoffel.
"We need to put them away early
and build some confidence. "
Swanson also said the begin
nings of these games would be
key. "We really need to come out
hard in the first 15 or 20 minutes.
We have to dictate the tempo, play
good team defense and maintain
possession of the ball. We must
establish ourselves early," he
said.
That won't be a simple task.
Team defense and ball possession
can be expected, but Stanford is
missing four major goal scorers
from its lineup. Emily Burt is the
Cardinal's leading scorer with
five points, but after injuring her
left shoulder in Sunday's game
against Santa Clara, the senior is
expected to be out for at least two
weeks.

Sophomores Kelly Adamson
and Tracye Lawyer and junior
Rita Hermiz are also injured.
Their absence leaves some major
holes in Stanford's lineup, partic
ularly on the forward line.
"We're missing a lot of really
good scorers," said Stoffel, Burt's
replacement against Santa Clara.
"We still have Erin Martin
though, and she's definitely able
to put the ball in the back of the

net for us."
Mart'n, a senior forward, was
Stanford's top scorer a year ago
and was only 39 points away from
becoming the Cardinal's all-time

points leader at the beginning of
this season. So far this season she
has recorded four points, and will
be called upon to up that total in
the coming games.
"There's not any extra pres
sure on me (because of the in
juries to other people)," Martin
said. "We have lots of capable
players who can fill in, so I don't
think that my job is changing very
much."
Swanson stressed that the in
juries, while certainly costly, are
not enough to bring down the
team.
"One of our greatest strengths
is our depth," he said. "This is a
great opportunity for some people
to step up, and I expect them to do
that. We may have to shuffle
some things positionally, but
we'll be ready to play."
So while it may appear that
Stanford is a slumping squad se
verely hampered by injuries, the
team certainly doesn't feel that
way.
"We have played really well the
past few games, unfortunately we
didn't win," Martin said. "I think
we're on the upswing, and it's im
portant for us to win this week
end and keep on improving."
