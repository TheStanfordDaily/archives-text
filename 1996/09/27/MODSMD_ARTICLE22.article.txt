# Women's soccer to change losing trend
## Players, coach say squad can pick up wins in Arizona tourney 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
After dropping three of its last
four games, the Cardinal
women's soccer team looks to put
a couple notches in the win col
umn in Arizona this weekend as it
confronts conference rival Ari
zona today and Wyoming on Sun
day.
While each of those three loss
es have come to top-20 opponents
— No. 16 Duke, No. 1 North Car
olina and No. 3 Santa Clara — the
Cardinal team (4-3) has not been
executing as well as it would like.
Stanford hopes to put together
two solid performances in Ari
zona and step up its level of play
as the season wears on.
"It's definitely important to
get back on track, that's for
sure," said coach Steve Swanson.
"But I don't think we've been
playing poorly or are in a slump. I
actually think we're playing bet
ter now than we did in those
games we won at the beginning of
the season. We've played some
very tough teams, and we've
played them well."
But while the Cardinal has lost
more games than it might have if
it played an easier schedule,
Swanson said that the games
were good for his team and will
pay off in the long run.
"We found out a lot about our
selves as a team in those losses,"
said Swanson, who is in his first
year at Stanford's helm. "It's
good to play against the best and
to be in some emotional games. I
definitely believe that the
tougher schedule has helped us."
Last year, Stanford disman
tled Arizona in its final game of
the regular season. Sophomore
goalkeeper Erin Bryla recorded a
shutout, and the Cardinal attack
pounded in four goals against an
overmatched Wildcat team. How
ever, Arizona has won its last two
games and is not to be taken light-
