# Field hockey will break stalemate when Golden Bears come to Farm
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The Cardinal field hockey
team is fired up to win the rubber
match against California in a
home game at 1 p.m. tomorrow
Stanford has split two contests
with the Golden Bears earlier in
the season.
Stanford beat Cal in a presea
son match, which counted to
ward its 3-1 overall mark but not
for Northern Pacific Conference
records. The Cardinal women's
loss was in an overtime game
against Cal.
If Stanford is able to top Cal in
tomorrow's contest at Maloney
Field, it will win the opportunity
to play against the Golden Bears

at the NorPac playoffs in Novem
ber.
Another victory over Cal is
crucial to accomplish one of the
team's main goals for this sea
son, which is to win the NorPac
title as the squad did last year. If
Stanford is unahle to beat Cal
next Saturday, its chances of
winning the title will diminish
Junior Paige Mader said that
the league title is "certainly at
tainable."
"While Cal is a strong team,
we are too," Mader said. "I know
we have the ability to beat any
team we encounter."
The Stanford team, which is
balanced with skillful and ener
getic freshmen as well as deter
mined veterans, also hopes to re

turn to the NCAA tournament
this year and put on a good show
ing.
The five new freshman mem
bers are expected to play a key
role in pursuing the high goals
that the team has set for them
selves.
"We have a great group of
freshmen who are learning
quickly and have a lot to give.'
Mader said.
Among them are forward / mid
fielder Mallory Chamber, forward
Lindsey Dunagan and midfielder
Julie Gwozdz. The three have al
ready put their skills to the test,
playing in last week's victory over
Pacific.
