# Field hockey will break stalemate when Golden Bears come to Farm
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The Cardinal field hockey
team is fired up to win the rubber
match against California in a
home game at 1 p.m. tomorrow
Stanford has split two contests
with the Golden Bears earlier in
the season.
Stanford beat Cal in a presea
son match, which counted to
ward its 3-1 overall mark but not
for Northern Pacific Conference
records. The Cardinal women's
loss was in an overtime game
against Cal.
If Stanford is able to top Cal in
tomorrow's contest at Maloney
Field, it will win the opportunity
to play against the Golden Bears

at the NorPac playoffs in Novem
ber.
Another victory over Cal is
crucial to accomplish one of the
team's main goals for this sea
son, which is to win the NorPac
title as the squad did last year. If
Stanford is unahle to beat Cal
next Saturday, its chances of
winning the title will diminish
Junior Paige Mader said that
the league title is "certainly at
tainable."
"While Cal is a strong team,
we are too," Mader said. "I know
we have the ability to beat any
team we encounter."
The Stanford team, which is
balanced with skillful and ener
getic freshmen as well as deter
mined veterans, also hopes to re

turn to the NCAA tournament
this year and put on a good show
ing.
The five new freshman mem
bers are expected to play a key
role in pursuing the high goals
that the team has set for them
selves.
"We have a great group of
freshmen who are learning
quickly and have a lot to give.'
Mader said.
Among them are forward / mid
fielder Mallory Chamber, forward
Lindsey Dunagan and midfielder
Julie Gwozdz. The three have al
ready put their skills to the test,
playing in last week's victory over
Pacific.

Sophomore sweeper Llssy Goralnik attempts to steal the ball from a Blue Hen earlier this year.
"They have so much energy
and great work ethics," said
sophomore midfielder Jordyn
Kramer. "They are fun and
hard-working and make the
rest of us really happy to be
here."
In addition to the five fresh
men, the fairly young team of
seven sophomores, two juniors
and three seniors lived together
off campus from mid-August to
the day Orientation started a
week ago.
"We did daily double prac
tices, cooked together and lived
together," Kramer said. "We
spend lots of time together [off
the field), and everybody on this
team gets along."
This team affinity can be
seen in the passing abilities the
members have displayed in the
four games so far.
"All elements combined, we
are a good passing team and can
work together to improve our
skills," Mader said.
"It's hard to stay focused

with school starting and with
the excitement of seeing all
your friends again, but we are
doing a good job focusing on and
balancing ourselves," said se
nior tri-captain Baochi Nguyen.
"We have a great ability to
focus as a team. We talk about
staying focused and it has
worked really well. The most
important thing is to focus on
us, to refine our abilities and to
communicate with each other,"
she said.
The Cardinal players showed
great enthusiasm and excite
ment for the upcoming season,
responding with an immediate
"yes" when asked if they
thought they could beat Cal to
morrow.
"We have the skill, the ability
and the teamwork to beat Cal
tomorrow," Nguyen said. "And
we'd like to be NorPac champi
ons."
"We have a really good team
this year," said coach Sheryl
Johnson. "Each year is definite
ly different, but we have a good
group this year, and we are def
initely progressing. I expect the
team to do really well this sea
son."
