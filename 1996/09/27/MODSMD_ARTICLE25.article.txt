Living on a campus far away from home can
be a frightening experience. That 's why we
at The Daily have decided to provide some
useful campus trivia to make your transition into
Stanford as painless as possible. We're friendly
citizens here to make your life happy! In fact,
we're your servants in every way. Try us!
The first thing you must know: Stanford has
a terrible secret no one can or will openly dis
cuss. A story so frightening drunken frat boys
dare not utter it. Twenty-eight years ago a rac
coon was found dead — strangulation. The rea
son remained a mystery until 15 years ago when
the same thing happened again. Except this
time it was a horse and it wasn't strangled; it
was drowned. Head first. The eerie part is, both
events happened in Lake Lagunita — on Sept.
27th. Don't bring it up.
Of course, not everything on campus is a
secret as demonstrated by our popular hangout
the Co Ho. The Co Ho is kind of like the Honey
Comb hideout, only there's no angry giant and
you have to pay for cereal. There's something
else about the Co Ho that makes it even more
unique. Rumor has it that it's owned and oper
ated by two werewolves. Now. not all were
wolves are bad werewolves; some are quite good.
That's the case with Bitey and Licky (sole pro
prietors). Those two have been serving up hot
treats for several years, never wasting a scrap.
•Just don't ask where they bought the meat!
You may have heard about the Redwood
Twins. Yes, it's true. This year, Dean of Under
graduate Admission and Financial Aids James
Montoya admitted two trees from a neighboring

forest. Our University has a strong tradition of
championing the rights of the disempowered,
and we're fortunate to witness the settlement of
a new frontier. Rights for all species, trees
included! And not just trees — rocks, sticks and
pixels, too. Who says cast an imaginary line
based on the similarity of nucleic acids? We're
all in it together! And remember, no paper!
Many people identify Stanford by its proud
monument, Hoover Tower. We're very proud of
Hoover, and we'd like you to preserve this piece
of Americana. That's why we've set up a contri
butions box outside the rear entrance. We don't
want to be too aggressive with our peddling, so
we've disguised the collection box as a 40-year
old man in a business suit. Don't let appear
ances deceive you. He's made of the finest plas
tics and looks extraordinarily real, but he's as
fake as a $5 bill and will accept small change in
his ear sockets.
Unlike Hoover Tower, a little known fact
about Stanford is its "won't listen, won't gossip"
policy on paranoid beetles. What university
would have a policy about uneasy insects?
Yours. Seven years ago six former Stanford
activists ate five mushrooms and enacted four
new policies on one subject — roaches. The
result was some quirky legislation that sets this
university apart.
Certainly you've heard stories about our
women's basketball team and you've seen our
famous golfers. Hut there's only one sport that
counts on the farm — Mountain Bike Motor
cross. The object is simple. Build up speed and
ride like a bat out of hell through White Plaza.

Bonus points are assigned to hikers using no
hands or feet. Riderless hikes speeding through
at 60 mph are an instant score. Dead bodies with
notes attached to their backs on bikes smashing
into buildings is instant disqualification.
I'm forgetting to tell you about Stanford's
star attraction. Liminers! Limmers, a sickly,
orphaned spider-lemming, was found aban
doned in Tangiers, half dead from giraffe bites.
Stanford students participating in studies at a
nearby post office found the poor creature,
nursed her back to health and gave her a home.
Now, after seven years of painful rehabilitation,
Limmers can dance to techno beats and catch
bagels with her tail. You'll find her in the Arril
laga Family Sports Center doing pec-deck-flies
and squats on weeknights.
I hope these pointers come in handy as you
cross the threshold of sophomoric idiocy into
marginal lunacy. If there's just one thing to
remember it's this: Smile at all those around,
hug everybody you meet, give high fives to pass
ing motorists and shy away from inebriated
squirrels.
