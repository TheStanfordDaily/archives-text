Fighting to prevent the Uni
versity's proposed $342 million
project on Sand Hill Road, approx
imately 50 Menlo Park and Palo
Alto residents have formed Mid
peninsula Action for Tomorrow, a
group designed to raise concern in
the surrounding communities.
The organization was created
in response to public hearings last
July in Palo Alto concerning the
draft environmental impact re

port on construction along Sand
Hill Road, said group spokes
woman Camas Hubenthal.
"Our goal is to educate the
community about the impacts
that the Stanford proposal would
have on the community and how
it would impact in particular our
quality of life and to investigate
alternatives to the proposal,"
Hubenthal said.
The University submitted pro
posals in 1992 for three construc-
tion projects — Stanford West Se
nior Housing, Stanford West
Apartments and the expansion of
the Stanford Shopping Center —
along with a proposed extension of
Sand Hill Road to El Camino Real,
a long-standing goal of the Uni
versity. Currently, the road termi
nates at the shopping center's
parking lot.
The University also plans tc
widen the two-lane road to four
lanes from Santa Cruz Avenue to
El Camino Real.
The estimated cost to the Uni
versity will exceed $20 million.
However, Stanford expects to gain
significant revenue from the pro
jects.
"In most municipalities, the
municipality contributes to the
cost of the roadway improve
ment," said Stanford's Director of
Community Relations Andrew
Coe. "It doesn't work that way

here. Stanford is more than will
ing to pay the entire cost."
The University has been sub
mitting proposals to improve the
road since the 19605, according to
Coe.
In the mid-1980s, a Menlo Park
resident filed a lawsuit, challeng
ing the adequacy of the environ
mental report. A second attempt
by Palo Alto to build the road fell
short when the city failed to get a
legal assessment.
While the environmental im
pact report states that the im
provements to Sand Hill Road will
redistribute traffic to more effi
cient roadways and provide better
access to areas such as the shop
ping center and the Stanford Med
ical Center, members of the new
group maintain that the project
will create more problems than it
solves.
The road "will become a mag
net for other traffic," said group
spokesman Dan Dippery. "Twen
ty-thousand more cars a day will
come from other areas," resulting
in greater congestion.

Dippery also expressed concern
about the construction of Stan
ford West Apartments on the field
across from the Oak ('reek Apart
ments.
"Between (Interstate) 280 and
the Bay, that's the last big piece of
open space in the midpeninsula,"
said Dippery. "In terms of a natur
al habitat, that's the only piece of
property available."
The Palo Alto City Council will
review the final environmental
impact report in January. Accord
ing to Hubenthal, her group will
hold a forum for the affected com
munities before the council meet
ing and will work on placing the
proposed projects on the ballot.
Coe expressed confidence that
both Palo Alto officials and resi
dents will approve the construc
tion, which is tentatively set to
begin in late 1997.
"We're trying to provide much
needed services to the area and
much needed resident housing,"
Coe said. "At the same time, we're
doing more than our share of pre
serving the environment."
