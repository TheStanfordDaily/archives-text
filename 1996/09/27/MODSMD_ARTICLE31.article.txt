Wednesday has resulted in allegations of sexual
battery and physical assault.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, the incident involved two men and
two women who were intoxicated and at the
house for a party.

one of the men made improper advances toward
them. They told the other man present at the
time about the advances. Upon hearing this, he
allegedly assaulted the man accused of improp

According to accounts given to the police, the
sleeping man woke up and proceeded to beat his
assailant. Niemeyer described injuries to the

but very bloody.
After a complete investigation by the sexual

The physical assault involving the two men is
now being reviewed by a Stanford residence
