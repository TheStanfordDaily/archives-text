# Parties cause trouble for Dekes, Sigma Chis
## 
### Marni Leff Staff writer 
With two parties shut down last week
and rumors that Stanford Police have
handed out multiple minor in possession
citations, some students fear a University
wide crackdown on fraternities.
The police received confirmed reports of
minors being served alcohol at a Sigma Chi
party Saturday. Also, at least one MIP cita
tion was issued at a Delta Kappa Epsilon
party Monday, according to Heather
Dunn, assistant director of the Office of
Student Activities.
The police patrolling the Deke party
Monday night entered the house after
noticing people crawling in and out of win
dows and about 200 people on the front
lawn, according to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer. There was also a report,
Niemeyer said, that members of Phi Delta
Theta kicked in the Deke house's kitchen
door.
After the police went into the Deke
house they observed about 50 people who
appeared to be underage and in possession
of alcohol, Niemeyer said.
"I was told that one person was cited,
and the police said if they had more man
power, they would have cited more," said
Deke president Bob Montgomery.
The Stanford Police, however, could not
confirm the citation.
After the police came, Montgomery said,

the Dekes were told they had 20 minutes to
clear out the party.
"I think that the police and the [office!
had the best intentions in mind," Mont
gomery said. "But the road to hell is paved
with good intentions."
Fearing it may be the beginning of a
trend, Montgomery said he found it unfor
tunate that police ended the party early.
"It's kind of an oppressive trend," he
said. "If [Student Activities) continues the
trend this is not going to be a fun place to go
to school. The students know that, and I
think [Student Activities J knows that, so I
don't know what their agenda is."
Earlier during Orientation, police broke
up a Sigma Chi party. After receiving an
anonymous tip that there were minors
being served alcohol at the Sigma Chi
party, Dunn said, police were called. Stan
ford Police confirmed that they issued one
minor in possession citation.
Two other students, according to
Niemeyer, were questioned by police.
"One of the males contorted his face in
an attempt to camouflage his identity
while police were trying to photograph
him," Niemeyer explained. The student
then fled the scene but was later identified,
Niemeyer said.
Sigma Chi President Christian Nicks
said his fraternity has no comment at this
time.
