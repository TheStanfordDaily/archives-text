## Star Folkl bids goodbye to basketball — for now 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
In possibly the biggest announcement
in Stanford athletics since Tiger Woods
turned pro, junior Kristin Folkl an
nounced yesterday she will not play bas
ketball in the 1996-97 season.
"I'm very happy with the decision I've
made, and I feel very comfortable with it,"
Folkl said. "I'm not playing basketball."
Folkl blamed physical and mental
weariness for her departure from the pro
gram but added that her basketball career
may not be over.
"I find it so funny that anyone would
care what I'm doing," Folkl said. "It has a
huge impact on my life, but I didn't realize
it would affect other people. I'm just a bas
ketball player on a team filled with other
incredible athletes.
"The option is there for me to come back

if I want. Not playing this I
year doesn't mean I'm |
closing the door on basket
ball. It's more of a small
sabbatical."
Folkl, who is an Ail-
American volleyball play
er, averaged 9.5 points
and 5.5 rebounds for the
Card as a freshman bas
ketball player and earned

All-Tournament honors in the NCAA tour
nament, where she averaged more than 20
points per game. She was also on the All-
Conference freshman team but did not
play last year in order to train with the na
tional volleyball team.
Her bid for a berth on the 1996 U.S.
Olympic team was unsuccessful, leading
many critics to wonder if the pressure of


Folkl
international competition and
trying to make the team led to
Folkl's fatigue. Folkl does not
deny that her decision might have
been different had she taken last
season off; still, she said, her expe
rience with the national team was
invaluable.
"There's no one definite rea
son," Folkl said. "My body is worn
out, and I don't know if I could
physically handle another season.
Coupled with that is the mental
stress [of playing]. If I'm not in it
100 percent, I can't do it.
"I have no regrets about leav
ing (last year). I didn't make the
(Olympic) team and that was hard
and disappointing, but I feel I

grew up a lot and learned a lot."
The pressure to reach a deci
sion has been a burden for Folkl
for some time now. Since last sea
son's departure, fans, the press
and friends all wanted to know if
Folkl would be "back for the 1996-
97 campaign, and that pressure
made the decision more difficult
for the athlete.
"It's got to help her a lot just to
get it off her mind," said head vol
leyball coach Don Shaw. "I didn't
think she had to make the deci
sion, but she did. It's something
she deals with constantly, and the
media is always on her."
In fact, the main reason for
yesterday's press conference was
to finally put all questions to rest
and hopefully alleviate the pres
sure from the press and the fans.
"I was feeling a pressure from a
lot of sides," Folkl said. "When

you hear all those people telling
you to play it's pretty hard to say,
'I need to do what makes me
happy.' It was hard; it's still
hard."
Knowing that the Stanford
women will be able to play unbeat
able basketball without her made
the decision more bearable, Folkl
said.
"I knew last year we'd be the
team to beat" this season, she
said. "They're so talent-laden.
They're experienced now and
have the entire coaching staff
back. Sometimes I wonder how
annoyed the team gets. I'm get
ting all this attention for not play
ing; I'd hate to mess up team
chemistry."
Folkl added that the leeway
both programs gave her in making
the decision was remarkable.
Doubly impressive are the oppor

tunities she has been given if she
decides to come back to the bas
ketball program.
"I can't believe how incredibly
lucky I am," Folkl said. "Both pro
grams have been great about let
ting me decide on my own time.
Most programs wouldn't allow
that luxury."
Now the question remains
whether Folkl will ever reach her
full potential as a basketball play
er. The sport is more visible and
more profitable than volleyball,
and many argue that Folkl could
be a top player if she focused on
basketball.
The attention "boggles me,"
Folkl said. "So much has hap
pened in the last year with pres
sures for coming back. I need this
year to get it all together. After I
do that and fulfill my need to have
a normal college experience, I'll be

ready to play again.
"I could see me playing next
year. I know I would like to go
overseas [after college] and play
— which sport I really don't
know. There's more money to be
made in basketball after college,"
Folkl said. "But you see people
who make so much money, and
they're not happy. I can't play a
sport I don't love just for money."
For now Folkl will concentrate
on schoolwork, volleyball and
other activities she's never experi
enced at Stanford. She said she
hopes to take a heavier coarse load
and go to a cappella concerts and
similar campus events.
Shaw hopes the media circus is
over, and Folkl will be able to fully
focus on volleyball.
"The media seems to pay a lot
more attention to basketball,"
Shaw said. "I'm going to miss

watching her play basketball; the
team is going to be good anyway.
[We've got] very big matches this
weekend, and I'm glad the deci
sion has been made. She needs to
have total concentration on vol
leyball this weekend."
For now Folkl's big challenge
will be watching her team com
pete without being on the court.
Folkl said watching last year's
Final Four from her San Diego
apartment was difficult and being
on campus this year could make
the task even tougher.
"Being at the Olympics and not
participating renewed a certain
fire I haven't had in me for a
while," Folkl said. "Seeing the
team play and me not being out
there could parallel the Olympics.
If I feel pretty rested and my
heart's in it 100 percent, next year
I'll play."

Folkl said. "But you see people
who make so much money, and
they're not happy. I can't play a
sport I don't love just for money."
For now Folkl will concentrate
on schoolwork, volleyball and
other activities she's never experi
enced at Stanford. She said she
hopes to take a heavier coarse load
and go to a cappella concerts and
similar campus events.
Shaw hopes the media circus is
over, and Folkl will be able to fully
focus on volleyball.
"The media seems to pay a lot
more attention to basketball,"
Shaw said. "I'm going to miss

watching her play basketball; the
team is going to be good anyway.
[We've got] very big matches this
weekend, and I'm glad the deci
sion has been made. She needs to
have total concentration on vol
leyball this weekend."
For now Folkl's big challenge
will be watching her team com
pete without being on the court.
Folkl said watching last year's
Final Four from her San Diego
apartment was difficult and being
on campus this year could make
the task even tougher.
"Being at the Olympics and not
participating renewed a certain
fire I haven't had in me for a
while," Folkl said. "Seeing the
team play and me not being out
there could parallel the Olympics.
If I feel pretty rested and my
heart's in it 100 percent, next year
I'll play."
