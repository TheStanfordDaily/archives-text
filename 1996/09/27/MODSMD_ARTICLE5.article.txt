### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
In possibly the biggest announcement
in Stanford athletics since Tiger Woods
turned pro, junior Kristin Folkl an
nounced yesterday she will not play bas
ketball in the 1996-97 season.
"I'm very happy with the decision I've
made, and I feel very comfortable with it,"

weariness for her departure from the pro
gram but added that her basketball career
may not be over.
"I find it so funny that anyone would

closing the door on basket
ball. It's more of a small
sabbatical."
Folkl, who is an Ail-

and 5.5 rebounds for the
Card as a freshman bas
ketball player and earned

All-Tournament honors in the NCAA tour

points per game. She was also on the All-

tional volleyball team.
Her bid for a berth on the 1996 U.S.
Olympic team was unsuccessful, leading
many critics to wonder if the pressure of
