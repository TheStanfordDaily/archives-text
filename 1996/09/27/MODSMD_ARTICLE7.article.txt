# Defining sexuality
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
"Heterosexual" was considered a derogatory
label as late as the 19205, historian and author
Jonathan Ned Katz told an overflow crowd in
Tresidder Union's Cypress Room yesterday.
Katz's discussion of his 1995 book, "The Inven
tion of Heterosexuality," kicked off the first les
bian, gay and bisexual studies lecture series,
planned to be an annual event.
More than 100 people listened to Katz describe
what he called his "surprising discovery." He found
that the word heterosexual appeared in early writ
ings, medical journals and dictionaries as a pejora
tive term used to describe promiscuity and sexual
perversions.
Katz explained that the terms heterosexual and
homosexual first were coined by German writer
Karl Marie Kert Beny in 1892. Katz quoted Beny as
writing of the heterosexual "unfettered capacity
for degeneration."
"Kert Beny's heterosexuals are no paragons of
virtue," said Katz.
In early medical journals, hypnosis and surgery
were recommended to cure heterosexual "abnor
mal methods of pleasure," said Katz. He added that
the 1923 edition of Webster's Dictionary defined
heterosexuality as "morbid sexual passion for
someone of the opposite sex."
By 1934, however, heterosexuality "had achieved
the status of normal in middle-class America," ac
cording to Katz. Webster's Dictionary defined het-
erosexuality as "the manifesta
tion of sexual passion for one of
the opposite sex," he said.
Katz stated that the recession
of stringent Victorian morality
led to a novel view of heterosexu
al sex in America. The middle
class became more sexually liber
ated, as shown by the increased
usage of birth control.
"Heterosexuality as a middle
class white norm legitimized the
practices which they were al
ready taking part in,"he said.
"Heterosexuality was affirmed

as the norm, a universal fact of
nature."
The concept of heterosexuali
ty is "an unquestioned sublimi
nal seducer. It continues quietly,
behind the scenes but is as pow
erful as any written law."
Katz asserted that current as
sumptions of heterosexuality as
normal, natural and timeless are
dangerous.
"It is important to problema
tize heterosexuality and keep it
problematized," he said. Not
doing so "prevents us from see
ing and recognizing all of the
ways in which sexuality is differ
ent. Problematizing the issue of
heterosexuality allows us to see
our country in a different way

and to imagine the United States
existing without categories. It
opens our eyes and minds for the
future."
Katz was introduced by Es
telle Freedman, chair of the
Feminist Studies Program.
Freedman called him "one of the
founding pioneers of gay and les
bian studies."
Katz was the recipient of the
Ken Dawson Award from the
Center for Lesbian and Gay
Studies in 1994 and two writer in
residence grants from the New
York State Council on the Arts in
1984 and 1985. Katz is also the
author of "Gay American Histo
ry" and"The Gay / Lesbian Al
manac."
