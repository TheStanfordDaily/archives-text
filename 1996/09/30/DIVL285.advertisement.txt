Bankers?
Ye all, sure
Don't be fooled by the casual dress (although it is appropriate on Fridays). These 10
PNC Bank employees are proof of the rapid changes taking place in financial services.
From the Asian Studies major who analyzes companies for one of our mutual funds to
the former naval aviator who is developing a method for tracking our long-term strate
gic progress, the backgrounds and skill sets of these PNC Bank employees are as diverse
as the services we offer.
If you would like to learn more about career opportunities at one of the nation's largest
bank holding companies, come visit us at our on-campus reception Friday, OcLll.
To attend, call Ruth Smith, Administrative Assistant,
College Relations, at (412)762-5901. You can send
resumes via fax to (412)762-2256. Visit us at
