First Daughter Chelsea Clinton had a lot of fun
during her visit to the Stanford campus on Friday,
but there's no word yet on whether she plans to
apply for admission to the Class of 2001.
"I think she enjoyed her stay," said sophomore
Jenny Abramson, who hosted Chelsea in her Bur
bank room on Thursday night. Family friends of the
Abramsons are good friends with the Clintons and
arranged the visit, Abramson said.
Chelsea, who visited campus with First Lady
Hillary Clinton, had a busy schedule on Friday, tak
ing a campus tour, attending a dance class and a
men's soccer game, and meeting with Undergradu
ate Advising Center counselor Hector Cuevas, Dean
of Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aids
James Montoya and Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds.
Montoya met with the Clintons for about half an
hour Friday morning but said he couldn't comment
on discussions with prospective applicants. Senior
Brooks Allen, an employee in the Admissions Office
who accompanied Chelsea on the campus tour, also
declined to comment.
Chelsea Clinton arrived on campus Thursday
night amid a swirl of rumors that the First Lady was

touringthe University. Residents of
Burbank, in Stern Hall, said they
had no idea what was happening
when they saw several men in dark
suits patrolling the hallways.
"It was a total surprise," said
sophomore Nathan Folkert. "We'd
seen federal agents walking around.
We didn't know who they were. We
made jokes that they were Secret
Service agents, but we didn't know
how ironic that statement would
be."
A few Burbank residents were

sitting in the lounge joking that the
vans driving up might bear the Clin
tons when they saw a curly haired
girl step out, Folkert said. No one
believed what was happening until
Chelsea came through the door and
could be identified.
Most students living in Burbank
remained fairly cool and hid their
surprise well, said freshman Bryan
Keefer, although "one guy followed
her upstairs."
"A lot of people sat around in the
lounge until really late waiting for
her to come down," added freshman
Margaret Duden. "I just stayed in
my room and studied."
On the tour, too, the Clintons
were a curiosity, but most people

kept a respectable distance.
The First Lady and her daughter
took an 11 a.m. tour led by seniors
Kiltie Barnett and Anjali Sakaria —
a regularly scheduled tour on which
they were joined by about 20 other
prospective applicants and their
parents.
Sakaria said the Clintons re
quested a normal tour but wanted a
premedical student or history
major to be the leader. Sakaria, a
human biology major who has com
pleted all the premedical require
ments, also is interested in joining
AmeriCorps, an initiative started
by President Clinton as a way for
students to pay for college through
public service.

The tour — which passed by the
Main Quad, science and engineer
ing buildings, Tresidder Union and
White Plaza — went well, Sakaria
said.
"Afterward, both Hillary and
Chelsea came up to me and told me
how they enjoyed the tour," she
said. "They were both very nice."
Barnett wasn't scheduled to be a
tour guide, but when the size of the
group got too large, she was sent
along to answer individual ques
tions.
"I really liked that position be
cause it gave me a chance to walk
alongside and talk to Hillary," she
said. The two had a conversation
about Barnett's plans after gradua

tions, which are still undecided.
"She said that it often seems like
people who are getting out of college
feel like they don't have a lot of time
and rush into something structured
like graduate school or a job," Bar
nett said. "One of the things she
said she regretted not doing more
was traveling abroad."
Barnett also had a few minutes
to speak with Chelsea at the end of
the tour. "She doesn't seem that
different from your average high
school senior," she said.
Although the group expanded
substantially during the course of
the tour and the Clintons were
mobbed by a lunchtime crowd at
White Plaza, Sakaria and Barnett

said they thought people handled
the surprise well.
"It was basically what you would
expect if you saw someone like the
Clintons on campus," Sakaria said.
"I thought in general people treated
them very respectably."
Barnett said getting to give the
Clintons a tour is one of the oppor
tunities she thinks make Stanford
special.
One other time, she said, she met
the inventor of the Aerobie flying
disk while she was at the Oval and
had the opportunity to play a game
with him.
Touring with the Clintons, she
said, "was the same but 100 times
more intense."
