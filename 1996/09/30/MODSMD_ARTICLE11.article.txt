## Editorial Students must vote 
### 
18-to-24 year olds
need to make sure that
their concerns are heard
FOR MANY STUDENTS, the
actions of Newt Gingrich and
Co. on Capitol Hill don't
seem to have much to do with their
daily lives on the Farm.
After all, the latest Congression
al vote on welfare or foreign policy
isn't going to help solve that seem
ingly unsolvable calculus problem.
Nor will it make food service cost
less or the lines at the post office go
any faster.
This kind of attitude spells dis
aster.
It leads students to harbor
thoughts like, "Hey, I don't need to
vote in November. It's not like my
one vote is going to make a differ
ence."
It makes it OK for students to
toss out excuses like, "Well, I
meant to vote, but I just didn't
have time," or "I forgot to sign up
for an absentee ballot until it was
too late."
The end result? Eighteen-to-24-
year-olds consistently have the
lowest turnout at the polls. In
1992, just 42.8 percent of the age
group voted in the presidential
election, and that was the highest
turnout since 18-year-olds were
first granted the vote 25 years ago.
No more.
Students must realize that what
happens in government — whether
it's in Washington or their home
state — has a real and direct
impact on their lives, both today
and tomorrow.
Consider the following statis
tics, compiled by Youth Vote '96, a
coalition of 30 organizations trying
to bring half of the 25 million peo
ple ages 18 to 24 to the polls in
November:
• Government funding for edu
cation has been cut by $42 billion
since 1980. In the 19505, education
funding made up 9.8 percent of the
federal budget; today, it makes up

only 1.8 percent.
• Eighty-four percent of college
freshmen think the government
isn't doing enough to protect the
environment.
• Young families headed by
someone between 25 and 34 years
of age had incomes $4,000 lower in
1991 than they did in 1979. Entry
level wages for both college and
high school graduates continue to
fall.
Nov. 5, Election Day 1996, is the
perfect chance for young voters to
stand up and say, "Enough is
enough."
Students can't let adults label
them as apathetic any longer. Nor
can they allow politicians to ignore
them as a significant political force,
instead catering to wealthy PACs
and influential businessmen.
Students care about issues —
like education, the environment,
the economy. They must use Elec
tion Day to say, "Here's what we
think ..."
There's no excuse not to vote.
It's easy to register, and polling
sites abound on the Stanford cam
pus on Election Day.
The ASSU is sponsoring a voter
registration and education cam
paign, "Voice Your Choice '96."
The campaign includes voter-regis
tration tables in White Plaza and
at Flicks, as well as a $700 prize to
the student group that registers
the most voters based on the
group's size.
California residents and non
residents alike can register
through the ASSU campaign. For
more information about the cam
paign, send e-mail to
vote96@assu.stanford.edu.
And if you're too lazy or busy to
make it out to White Plaza, you can
register to vote on the Internet.
Just check out the site at
http://www.rockthevote.org.
So, do your part and register to
vote. Remember, Oct. 7 is the dead
line to register in California.
Don't just sit back and wait to
see what the future will bring.
Young voters must fight to deter
mine what that future will be.
