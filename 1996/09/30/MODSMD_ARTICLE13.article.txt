## University's secret plan to kill fraternities 
### 
Dave Halsted

I GUARANTEE THAT
when the Betas,
Kappa Alpha and
Delta Tau Delta all lost
their houses last year,
nobody in the adminis
tration let fall a sorrow
ful tear, for the common
theme threaded through
out the University's rela

tionship with fraternities is obvious: It
wants all of them off the campus.
Let's hop the fence and put ourselves
in the boots of an egotistical University
administration.
How would we feel about housed frater
nities? We would see them as an anomaly
in our efforts to bring the entire campus
under strict Residential Education con
trol, hypocritically find them against the
mission of "diversity," and jump on the
national bandwagon in trying to rid our
selves of the independence they repre
sent.
But the kids at our school are suppos
edly smart, we concede, and the alumni
of the housed fraternities give our little
school crates of cash each year. So we
have to be clever; we have to construct a
facade where the fraternities appear to be
eliminating themselves (naturally, we'd
let the unhoused fraternities exist
because they have no visible presence at
Stanford nor social clout).
The first step would be to tie together
the laces of the shoes of all the remaining
fraternities. We'd remove distinction
between them by meshing them into the

Interfraternity Council. We'd know darn
well that the IFC is bogus because frater
nities are by their very nature separate
even from each other, but we'd appoint
people to IFC relations offices anyhow
and arm them with cellular phones,
pagers, plenty of paperwork and the
skills to deal with angry and frustrated
fraternity representatives.
For example, when a fraternity mem
ber demands, "Why in God's name aren't
the Rush Handbooks out in time for
Rush when it's the only thing the IFC
has to produce all year?" we'd be able to
respond quickly, "Lines of communica
tion have been broken and need to be
restructured to facilitate a healthy sym
biotic relationship, that's why."
With Rush itself, we'd make sure that
fraternities have little control over this
very process which is their lifeblood.
We'd restrict it to death, disallowing
them from Rushing more than once a
year, and we'd regulate it to death by
shoving the whole process into a neat lit
tle alcohol-free time slot. We'd make sure
our little lap-dogs, the resident assis
tants, frown upon fraternities and tell
scary stories to freshmen.
But how could we physically remove
them? Well, we'd set an arbitrary mini
mum membership number to be used as
an excuse for taking housing from partic
ularly annoying fraternities. We'd create
"collective responsibility," a policy direct
ed uniquely against fraternities that
would eliminate the individuality of fra
ternity members and find them responsi

ble for each other's crimes. If a dorm had
large men standing outside its party
ordering the female partygoers to
undress (Exotic Erotic), we wouldn't bat
an eye, but if a fraternity attempted any
thing remotely similar, we'd drill it to the
wall.
Each year we'd gleefully watch the
Delts accumulate irreparable debt, for
getting for a moment that we have
promised to assist the livelihood of fra
ternities. Then we'd jump in and have
them out by the end of the quarter.
Is there any way we would be able to
accelerate this process? Of course! By
actively recruiting and admitting only
students who are not potentially frater
nity-bound, we could create a perfect
community of mindless and unimagina
tive bookworms.
To mask and eventually kill the party
school image, we'd have the prospective
freshmen come see Stanford during Fra
ternity Rush, which we'll have conve
niently made dry and party-free. We'd be
sure to have our admissions department
flat-out lie to this summer's Newsweek
Special Edition on universities and
report to that magazine that only 1 per
cent of Stanford students belong to
Greek organizations.
And in the end, when the campus is
finally fraternity-free, we would regret
fully shake our heads and say we did all
we could to save them.
