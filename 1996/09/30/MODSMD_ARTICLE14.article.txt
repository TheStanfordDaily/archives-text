# MTL prof, and grad students blame Israel for violence
## 
### 
AS NORTH AMERICAN JEWS we
have watched the death toll
mount in the renewed Palestini
an-Israeli conflict with deep sadness and
anger. The catalyst of this violence was
the Israeli government's decision to
open a long-disputed entrance to an
archaeological tunnel below the edge of
the sacred site of the Temple
Mount / Haram al-Sharif. This provoca
tion expresses a long-standing Israeli
policy of asserting full control over
Jerusalem in violation of the Oslo
accords, according to which the fate of

the city is to be determined by final sta
tus negotiations that have not yet
begun.
Israeli forces repeatedly opened fire
on unarmed civilian demonstrators. Sub
sequently, Palestinian police returned
Israeli fire. Israel responded with exces
sive force, deploying Cobra attack hell
copters, tanks and armored vehicles.
Palestinian protesters are responding
to much more than the opening of the
tunnel. Since the Oslo accords, the
Israeli government has subjected Pales
tinians to repeated military closures,

land confiscations, house demolitions,
settlement construction and attacks on
local Palestinian institutions. Israel has
refused to withdraw its troops from
Hebron, violating a timetable previously
negotiated. The former Rabin / Peres
Labor government laid the groundwork
for many of the current government's
abuses by initiating the military closure,
extending the settlement infrastructure
in the West Bank and expanding Israeli
control of Arab East Jerusalem.
The provocative actions of the
Netanyahu government have further

diminished the already slim chance that
the Oslo accords might lead to lasting
peace. A just and stable peace should be
based on a two-state solution: a Pales
tinian state, with East Jerusalem as its
capital, coexisting alongside Israel.
