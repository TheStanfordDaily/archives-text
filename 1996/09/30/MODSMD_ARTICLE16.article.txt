## Water polo orchestrates comeback win in Stockton Cardinal scores victories over Long Beach State and Pacific in the pool this weekend 
### Rustan Eklund 
Down 11-9 against sixth-ranked Uni
versity of the Pacific with less than a
minute to play, the Stanford men's water
polo team (6-2 overall, 2-0 MPSF) needed
something big.
The Cardinal got it when freshman
forward Brian Heifferon beat UOP goalie
Rob Gemmel to score a two-point goal to
tie the game at 11-11 with just 55 seconds
to play.
Stanford went on to add goals from se
nior Brian Wallin and sophomore Crosby
Grant in overtime to win the game 13-11
and drop UOP to 3-5, 1-3 in the confer
ence.
"We felt pretty confident going into
overtime," Heifferon said. "We had to
step it up a bit when Daniel Lehoczky got
ejected in the fourth quarter, and we re
ally played well."
"We were on the counterattack with
one possession left, and Brian fired a
beautiful two-point skip shot to tie the
game," said coach Dante Dettamanti.
"The sign of a good team is one that can
come from behind and win the big games,
and that's what they did today."
In <?d, the road to victory was diffi
cult. I came out quickly, jumping out
to a 3-0 lead in the first quarter with goals
from Ryan Price and Daniel Stachkov.
Stanford responded with goals of its

own as sophomore forward David Hay
scored three points in under a minute.
Wallin added another with just 3 seconds
to play in the quarter to give Stanford a 4-
3 lead.
The Cardinal added two more goals
early in the second period and looked to
be cruising to victory. But the Tigers an
swered with two more Stanford took
a narrow 6-5 lead into the second half.
UOP proceeded to outscore the Cardi
nal 6-3 in the third and fourth quarters
before Heifferon's game-tying goal sent it
to overtime.
In other water polo action earlier this
weekend, the Cardinal squad faced No. 8
Long Beach State on Friday at deGuerre
Pool.
The Cardinal struggled in the first
quarter against the 49ers, as it let an
early 2-0 lead slip away.
"I thought that we struggled in the
first quarter," Dettamanti said. "We
were giving them shots on defense."
That's when the veteran Wallin
stepped in. After stealing the ball from
the 49er holeman, sophomore goalie
Chris Aguilera found Wallin breaking for
the goal.
Wallin pulled up at the 7-meter mark
and found the back of the net for a two
point goal with 5:42 to play in the half.

Freshman forward Brian Heifferon fires a shot in Friday's game against Long Beach State. Heifferon scored a two-point goal
against UOP to tie the game and spark the Card's win.
From that point on Stanford
never looked back.
Barely a minute later, Wallin
beat the goalie again with a skip
shot to the upper left corner to
make the score 5-2. Stanford
went on to roll to a convincing 20-
6 victory.
Wallin "really sparked us
today," Dettamanti said. "His
four points in the second quarter
really set the tone for the rest of
the game."

Senior holeman Bryce
Matthews, in his first game back
from a hand injury, put in his
first two goals of the season.
"I feel fine," Matthews said.
"My strength is all right, but my
endurance is a little low. By the
end of next week I'll be back in
good shape."
Matthews was also enthusias
tic about the overall play of the
young Stanford squad.
"There seems to be good chem
istry," Matthews said. "Every
body seems to have a positive at
titude, and we're improving. The
freshmen definitely seem to be
coming into their own."
