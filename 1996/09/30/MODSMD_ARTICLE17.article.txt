### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team kept its amazing
home winning streak alive by
defeating both Washington
State and Washington this
weekend at Maples Pavilion.
For 37 consecutive matches, no
visiting Cardinal opponent has
escaped the Farm with a victo
ry-
The Cardinal women proved
themselves up to the challenge
against the visiting 10th
ranked Cougars. Stanford
earned the victory in three
games 15-4, 15-13, 15-13 en
route to its 36th straight home
victory. The triumph ran the
Card to a 9-1 record overall and
a perfect 3-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference.
Stanford found solutions to
Washington State's quick
squad by pounding thi Cougars
for 59 kills. Freshman outside
hitting sensation Kerri Walsh
led the Stanford attack with 17
kills, while junior outside hitter
Kristin Folkl added 14 of her
own.
The Cardinal has owned
Washington State throughout
the duration of their head-to
head matchups. Friday's victo
ry ran Stanford's all-time mark
against the Cougars to 21-0.
In the first game, the usually
slow-starting Cardinal jumped
out to an early 6-1 lead after
powerful hitting from Walsh,
Folkl and senior middle blocker

Eileen Murfee. The squad
proved its intensity right from
the start and routed Washing
ton State 15-4 in the first game.
"I feel really good about the
way we practiced and our atti
tude going in," said head coach
Don Shaw. "We needed to go in
there and dictate the action,
and I think we did that."
The second game provided a
tighter contest, as Cougars Jen
nifer Stinson and Sarah Silver
nail traded kills with Murfee
and Walsh en route to an 11-11
tie. Washington State then
pulled ahead by two points be
fore committing timely errors,
falling prey to excellent serving
and hitting from Walsh to lose
the game 15-13.
Game three provided much
of the same dynamics, as Folkl
carried the offensive load for
the Cardinal, recording eight
kills and winning a key joust
with Cougar Stephanie Papke.
Murfee then finished Washing
ton State off with a kill on the
final play of the match.
"I think we rose to the occa
sion," Folkl said.
Stanford then faced No. 18
Washington (12-2, 2-1) the fol
lowing evening. The Huskies
also entered their battle with
the Card undefeated in Pac-10
play after squeaking out a win
against California. The Bears
extended Washington to five
games before losing Friday
night.

The Cardinal roared from the
starting blocks, amassing a 6-2 lead
behind strong hitting from junior
outside hitter Debbie Lambert and
a spirited defensive effort. Follow
ing a Washington timeout, the Car
dinal extended its lead to 11-4 be
fore putting the Huskies away 15-7.
"We knew we just had to keep
swinging away," Folkl said. "And
you know, it worked."
Washington pulled out to a 3-1
lead in game two, but a fired up

Stanford squad fought back, gain
ing the lead 7-4 after some nifty set
ting from junior All-American Lisa
Sharpley. The Huskies kept the
game close behind powerful hitting
from senior Angela Bransom, but
Stanford's Folkl, Walsh and junior
middle blocker Barbara Ifejika
pounded the ball at Washington's
highly-rated defense en route to a
15-9 game-two victory.
In the third game, the Huskies'
big front line started to prove why it
ranks first in the nation in blocking,
repeatedly stuffing Cardinal hitters
and gaining a 9-2 advantage. But
the Husky defense could not keep
the lid on Stanford's offense.

Walsh and Folkl both nailed
monstrous kills, and senior co-cap
tain Catherine Juillard and fresh
man Jaimi Gregory provided a
spark for the Cardinal off the
bench. After the score was finally
evened at 11-11, Washington took
the lead 13-11. But Stanford fought
back to tie the score before finally
winning 16-14.
"I think we did a great job," Gre
gory said. "I think the key was we
had such good practices this week."
"Juillard made a dig that really
kept us going in the third game,"
Shaw said. "Our bench is tremen
dous. I have to give those guys a lot
of credit; this was a team effort."
