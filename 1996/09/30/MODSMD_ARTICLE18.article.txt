# Soccer suffers loss to CSU-Northridge
## Clark's squad drops first contest since season opener 
### Lindsay Amstutz 
Looking to keep its unbeaten streak alive, the
Stanford men's soccer team (4-2-2) fell 2-1 to Cal
State-Northridge (3-2-1) on Friday at Maloney
Field. Stanford had not lost in its last six con
tests.
The Cardinal took an early lead in the sixth
minute when sophomore midfielder A.J. Sauer sent
a header into the back of the net off a cross from
sophomore forward Aaron Jones. That was the last
time Stanford would hold the lead as the Matadors
answered back in the 12th minute with a goal by
Danny Ortega.
Cal State-Northridge captured and maintained
the lead in the 15th minute with a shot by Kris
Swanson. Despite many shots on goal, both teams
were held scoreless in the second half.
Stanford tried to even the score, taking a total of
18 shots on goal throughout the game. The Cardi
nal outshot the Matadors 18-13, with Stanford se
nior goalkeeper Ryan Craig helping to keep Stan
ford in the game with four saves.
"We had a lot of chances to win, but the ball
didn't roll for us," Sauer said. "We had a lot of shots,
but we just didn't finish."
"The team was excited to play and to see so many
fans out there supporting us," senior Steve
Kirschbaum said.
But after a long preseason of dwelling on nothing
but soccer, the enthusiastic home crowd and start
of classes brought a few distractions. Kirschbaum
felt that perhaps the team wasn't quite as focused
as it will need to be for the conference schedule that
lies ahead.
"If we play the way we can and come ready to
play every game, we should do very, very well,"
Sauer said.
Stanford soccer action will resume on the road
on Oct. 6, when it takes on Sacramento State in the
Cardinal's first Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion game. The first home conference contest will
kick off on Oct. 11, when the Card takes on Oregon
State.
Despite the disappointing loss and minor set
back, the team feels confident that coach Bobby
Clark will have the squad prepared and ready for
the remaining games.
"We'll be ready to play on Sunday," Sauer said.
