# Field hockey wins again, now poised to win NorPac
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The Stanford field hockey team (4-1
overall, 2-1 Northern Pacific Conference)
won a key match which could help make it
the NorPac champions of the 1996-97 sea
son, beating California 2-1 in a heated con
test Saturday.
The Cardinal competed in front of hun
dreds of Stanford students, parents and
alumni that gathered at Maloney Field to
be a part of the most exciting game of the
season.
The Stanford squad was fired up to de
feat the Golden Bears after the overtime
loss to them earlier in the season. However
after Saturday's crucial victory, the Cardi
nal players have placed themselves in full
shooting range to grasp the NorPac title.
"One of our goals of the game was to
dominate, and this was definitely accom
plished," said coach Sheryl Johnson. "Cal
had their moments, but player-to-plaver,
we were definitely above them. We were
able to keep the intensity going throughout
the game."
Stanford's first goal was executed by
sophomore midfielder Jordyn Kramer, off
a pass from senior tri-captain Amy Marfil
with 9 minutes remaining in the first half.
The Bears caught up momentarily in
the second half before the Card's sopho
more forward Carey Cloyd recovered the

lead with a penetrating goal that won the
game.
Stanford outshot Cal 22-3 in the contest
and obtained a total of 13 penalty corners
to Cal's none.
Stanford's victory over its toughest
rival proves that the close-knit and well
balanced team is in top condition to main
tain focus on the path to the NorPac title.
"Everybody was focused today," John
son said. "It was obvious that we were click
ing. We had a solid defense, the midfield
line knew when they needed to be on of
fense or defense, and the passing combina
tion was great. I am 100 percent pleased
with the way the team played against Cal."
The players kept their intensity
throughout the game, and their teamwork
was visible as each pnss and play was com
pleted and dominated by the Cardinal.
"Adrenaline and communication be
tween each other had a lot to do with ithe
victory]," said sophomore sweeper Lissy
Goralnik. "Fan support was incredible and
we really trusted each other. We were able
to keep the intensity and follow up each
play to the finish, which we sometimes
aren't able to do. Everybody really listened
to what everybody else had to say. The Cal
hecklcr* are usually hard to ignore, so the
huge support we had was really encourag
ing."
The Cal players shed tears
after the game as the two teams
lined up to shake hands. These
squads will most likely meet
again late in the season to deter
mine the NorPac title once and
for all.
Although the Stanford players
said they have gained confidence
from this victory, it does not mean
they have let down their guard.
"We are looking forward to a
rematch against Cal," Kramer
said. "It could go either way on
any given day. Today, we were re
ally focused and were able to win.
As long as we always keep on aim
ing higher, focus, and play like we
did today, we have the skills to
beat any team."
The Stanford team will return
to action next Thursday at a
home game against St. Louis.
