create, the proposed merger of
Stanford Health Services and the
UC-San Francisco Medical Center
is a welcome challenge for incoming

Chair Judith Swain.
Swain, who will assume the posi
tion Dec. 1, said in an interview last
week that the merger helped her
decide to take the job, which was
opened afler the resignation of for
mer chairman Victor Dzau last
spring.
"Stanford's department is good,
but the merger will offer more than
a single institution would," said
Swain, currently professor of ge
netics and director of cardiovascu
lar medicine at the University of
Pennsylvania.
Swain said her new position will
provide her with "a wonderful op

portunity to lead an excellent de
partment of medicine."
Stanford School of Medicine
Dean Eugene Bauer said Swain
"brings tremendous talents to
Stanford.
"She is an outstanding investi
gator and educator with superb
clinical skills," he said. "She is also
wonderfully energetic and conveys
a real sense of enthusiasm for acad
emic medicine."
Swain was associate professor of
medicine and microbiology at Duke
University Medical Center and co
director of the Transgenic Animal
Facility of the Duke Comprehen
sive Cancer Center before going to
Penn in 1991.
Originally a resident of Cypress,
Calif., she received her bachelor's
from UCLA in 1970. She then at
tended UC-San Diego, where she
earned her medical degree in 1974.
She completed her training in inter
nal medicine and cardiovascular
medicine at Duke before joining the
faculty in 1979.
Swain has held several national
leadership roles, including presi
dent of the American Society of
Clinical Investigation, the only
woman to hold that position in the
organization's 87-year history.
Other national positions include

membership on the advisory coun
cil and the cardiology advisory' com
mittee of the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute, as well as act
ing as subcommittee chair of the
National Institutes of Health Direc
tor's Standing Committee on Clini
cal Research.
As chair of the Department of
Medicine, Swain will be "setting the
direction of the department," said
Micki Leder, associate dean for ad
ministration of the Medical School.
Although Swain is currently
pursuing her own research, she
said her commitments will change.

"My first priority is the depart
ment; my own laboratory research
comes second," Swain said.
A main goal, Swain said, is to in
crease the amount of research
funding in the department.
"The clinical opportunities and
resources are good, but I want to
improve them even more," she said.
Even though she will continue to
commute home to Pennsylvania
every other weekend, Swain said
she is looking forward to coming to
Palo Alto.
"I grew up in California, so it's
great to return," she said.
