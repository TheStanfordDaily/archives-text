Despite the extra work it may
create, the proposed merger of
Stanford Health Services and the
UC-San Francisco Medical Center
is a welcome challenge for incoming
Stanford Department of Medicine
Chair Judith Swain.
Swain, who will assume the posi
tion Dec. 1, said in an interview last
week that the merger helped her
decide to take the job, which was
opened afler the resignation of for
mer chairman Victor Dzau last
spring.
"Stanford's department is good,
but the merger will offer more than
a single institution would," said
Swain, currently professor of ge
netics and director of cardiovascu
lar medicine at the University of
Pennsylvania.
Swain said her new position will
provide her with "a wonderful op

portunity to lead an excellent de
partment of medicine."
Stanford School of Medicine
Dean Eugene Bauer said Swain
"brings tremendous talents to
Stanford.
"She is an outstanding investi
gator and educator with superb
clinical skills," he said. "She is also
wonderfully energetic and conveys
a real sense of enthusiasm for acad
emic medicine."
Swain was associate professor of
medicine and microbiology at Duke
University Medical Center and co
director of the Transgenic Animal
Facility of the Duke Comprehen
sive Cancer Center before going to
Penn in 1991.
Originally a resident of Cypress,
Calif., she received her bachelor's
from UCLA in 1970. She then at
