# Stanford's barber keeps on cutting
## 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
Although the face of Tresidder
Union will soon change dramatical
ly, there still is room for one famil
iar fixture: The barbers who have
operated on campus for decades
have signed a lease for a new place
in the redesigned union.
Stanford Hairstyling will move
from its current location across
from BASS ticket agency to a new
spot in Tresidder's west wing,
across from Tresidder Express and
next to the future site of Polio Rey.
Dean of Students Marc Vv'ais
said he was "very pleased anfTOf**
lighted to have signed a lease with
Stanford Hairstyling."
Carmelo Cogliandro and Newell
Whitford, the owners of Stanford
Hairstyling, also were enthusiastic
about setting up a new shop.
Cogliandro said he looked for-

ward to a "new
salon feel" and
added that all the
chairs and equip
ment will be new.
The salon will also
consider expand
ing its staff and
plans to change its
name to Stanford
Hair.

Whitford said the building per
mits would be obtained next week,
and both he and Wais said they
looked forward to moving in late
this quarter. According to Coglian
dro, the salon should not have to
r-jj '-112 down for more than a day for
iWfnove.
Stanford Hairstyling's current
spot is planned to house ajuice bar.
Wais said his office expected a deci
sion in the near future on which


Wais
juice vendor to invite.
Regarding the new site, Coglian
dro said that while "obviously, it't
not as centrally located as this
one. . . . There'll be a cluster of busi
nesses around [the new sitel, so wi
hope we'll draw business from each
other."
Coeliandro and Whitford havt

several other changes planned in
order to make the new salon more
convenient for students. Rather
than the current informal hours of
operation, Whitford said Stanford
Hair would be open from 9 a.m. to 8
p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. on weekends.
There also will be a discount for
students. Cogliandro said the cur
rent idea is to put an advertisement
in The Daily which would include a
coupon for a price reduction one day
a week. Haircuts now cost $14 each.

"What we're excited about,"
Wais said, "is [Stanford Hair'sl
commitment to provide a more stu
dent-focused environment, which is
evidenced by extended hours of op
eration and reduced student
charges.
"It really is a win-win situation,"
he added, noting that students
would get both a new convenience
and the familiarity of a longtime
Tresidder institution.
Wais said the new hours and stu
dent discount should make Stan

ford Hair competitive with discount
establishments off campus.
"Haircuts will now simply be
more affordable to more of our stu
dents," Wais said.
He added that he was "delight
ed" to have solved "another part of
the Tresidder puzzle" and stressed
"how pleased we are to accommo
date these barbers who have been so
much a part of the fabric of Stan
ford."
Whitford gave his first Stanford
haircut in 1951 in Old Union for

$1.25. His uncle had set up shop on
campus in 1937. Until recently,
however, it was not clear that his
stay would continue beyond the end
of the old lease on Aug. 30 of this
year.
Cogliandro said the owners had
received indications that the lease
would not be renewed ever since
Stanford Management Company
took over in 1994 but that they were
formally notified of the move this
June.
At that point, Cogliandro said,

the spot was opened for bids. At the
same time, there was a letter-writ
ing campaign by faculty, staff and
students in favor of Stanford Hair
styling, which Cogliandro said he
assumed was the deciding factor
that tilted Stanford toward finding
them a new place.
He added that Supercuts, a na
tional discount salon chain, had
considered a bid but had not sub
mitted one because of the long peri
ods of slack business during vaca
tions.
