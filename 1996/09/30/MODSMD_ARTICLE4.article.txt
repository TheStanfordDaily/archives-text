# LGBCC still seeks University changes
## 
### Kelly E. Young Contributing writer 
With the be
ginning of a new
academic year,
the University's
quest to improve
the quality of life
for its lesbian, gay
and bisexual com
munity has start
ed moving again.
Dean of Stu-

dents Marc Wais said Friday has
been working to address issues
raised by the community at a town
hall meeting last spring.
Members of the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center
sent Wais a memo requesting writ
ten accounts of how several offices
on campus were responding to the
recommendations of a 1995 report
on issues relating to that commu
nity.
"I've spent the summer getting
responses from these agencies —
community centers, athletics, Res
idential Education, and that's not
an exclusive list — asking them to
provide an updated report to me in
response to [lesbian, gay and bisex
ual] concerns," Wais said. "All of
those offices on campus have, in
fact, provided me with documenta
tion of their efforts in addressing
those concerns."
He is currently in the process of
compiling their responses in order
to present them to the community
center.
"I plan on having a town meet

ing to update where we are in this
stage of the process and update one
another on how the University is
responding to the initial report,"
he said. "We're talking about a
long process."
At the community center, stu
dent leaders and advisers said they
are waiting patiently for word
from Wais.
"I think we're just waiting for
[Wais] to respond," said Troy
Gilbert, community center adviser
and assistant director of the Office
of Student Activities. "He certain
ly has a lot on his plate at this
time."
The report in question was re
leased in March 1995 by the Work
ing Group on Lesbian, Gay and Bi
sexual Student Needs, which had
been gathering information since
1991. It emphasized many needs
— an official community center di
rector, more academic role models,
the integration of lesbian, gay and
bisexual studies into the Universi
ty curriculum, encouragement of a
healthy social and academic envi
ronment and open-mindedness to
ward homosexuals on campus.
A meeting was held last Janu
ary after Wais released his re
sponse to the report. Although the
community generally was support
ive of the University's stance, stu
dents provided Wais with a written
reply requesting more information
on what was being done to imple
ment the report's suggestions.
In February, Wais sent a memo


Gilbert
to the community summarizing
the main points of the town meet
ing. He also reiterated his recom
mendation for the formation of a
dean's advisory board, a group that
would work to make sure that the

suggestions put forth by the initial
report would be implemented.
One of the concerns still plagu
ing the community is the lack of
disabled access to the Fire Truck
House.
"We're still in the process of
working with the architects and
figuring out what would best work
for the Fire Truck House," said
Courtney Lake, community center

volunteer coordinator.
Although there is still progress
to be made in these areas, Wais
said he thinks that the University
has come a long way.
"Overall, I think the University
clearly made tangible efforts in im
proving quality of life for its les
bian, gay and bisexual students,
faculty and staff," he said.
