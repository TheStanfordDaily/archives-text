# Could it have been divine intervention?
## Four pious men find a challenge in life at Synergy 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Contributing writer 
This is the first installment in
an occasional series. It is the true
story of four "virtuous" men
picked by the Draw to live among
"Synners" for the next year and
have their worldview altered.
Find out what happens when
people stop eating meat and start
scrubbing floors. The Real
World, Stanford.

There is no doubt that the
Draw has its quirks. Draw
groups often pray they will
emerge from the sweepstakes in
tact and comfortably situated in
one of their desired residences.
For the members of this year's
Real World Stanford, however,
serious prayer and contempla
tion did not begin until after they
discovered their housing assign
ment.
Sophomore Scott Dollar and
juniors Erik Nordhagen, Mark
Lo and Arthur Chang, this year's
Real World members, had been
hoping for a residence located
close to friends in Governor's
Corner. They listed houses such
as Yost or EAST on their draw
application, both conventional

choices for groups drawing un
preferred.
A main concern for the guys,
when choosing residences, was
food. They all wanted a residence
with an open kitchen. Scott, the
Texan in the group and a man
known to live off of meat, was es
pecially concerned with having a
carnivorous diet.
They got their open kitchen.
The kitchen, however, instead of
coming well stocked with bacon,
hamburgers and ham, contains
items such as soy milk, organic
produce and tofu.
Late last spring, Scott and
Erik were given the news that
they would be living in Synergy
this year. The two had varying
reactions. Eric was left speech
less, while Scott naively ques
tioned, "Where is that?"
With safety houses such as
Durand and Ujamaa, both of
which surged in popularity this
year, the group ended up with a
Draw number too low to be as
signed to any of their choices.
The other roommate pair in
the draw group, Mark and
Arthur, reacted in the same way
as Scott. In fact, no one in the
group had visited Synergy until
after they discovered they had
been assigned to it, and Erik was
the only one who had even heard
of the house.
Friends of the guys, aware of
the Svnergian lifestyle, reacted

with a mixture of shock, amuse
ment and trepidation when they
heard the group's assignment.
Many thought the group would
apply to be on the wait list for
other residences or petition to be
rejoined with two other members
of their draw group who had
ended up in Loro and the French
House.
The group did indeed consider
petitioning. They had many nights
spring quarter when they stayed
up until 5 a.m., discussing what
they should do.
As they learned more about Syn
ergy, Scott, speaking for the group
said, "At first, it was something we
were thinking was just not for us.
We had some concerns about things
Synergy is known for."
In addition, Arthur said, "We
viewed Synergy as a community we
weren't sure if we would be able to
fit in and be accepted to. We felt we
might even be isolated and
shunned."
At the orientation meeting last
spring, the guys learned, according
to Mark, that "pretty much every
one else put Synergy first on their
list except for us." They were re
ferred to as "that Draw group" or
"the guys who didn't want to live
here."
In the end, though, Scott said
the four decided living in Synergy
would be "something we could
learn from." Besides not wanting

to be split up, the group felt there
was a purpose to their living in
Synergy.
"By living in a community we
are not used to, we will learn how
to relate. This assignment was not
an accident," said Scott.
Over this summer, Scott, who is
a member of the Campus Crusade
for Christ and the Stanford soccer
team, went on a mission trip to At
lanta during the Olympics with a
group called Athletes In Action.
Arthur, who is a member of
Stanford's Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship along with Marc and
Erik, went on a mission trip to
China and visited Taiwan.
When talking about his sum
mer, Mark grinned and said, "I did
not go on a mission trip." He did,
however, take physics at UC-
Berkeley, climb Half Dome and
travel throughout California.
Erik, who hails from Chattaroy,
Wash., a town of 400 people in the
corner of the state near Idaho and
Canada, worked for a start-up
computer company in Mountain
View. He also tried to bike from
Canada to Stanford, but his knees
"gave up" in Oregon.
After returning to Stanford and
spending their first week living in
Synergy, Scott, Eric, Mark and
Arthur are definitely beginning to
learn more about the "things Syn
ergy is known for."
Synergy means "the whole is
greater than the sum of the parts."
Life in Synergy is regulated by
the infamous consensus meeting,
which is used to cultivate strength
through group decisions. Along

with all residents of the house, a
blow-up figure of Munch's "The
Scream" is a regular attendant of
these mandatory, grueling meet-

ings.
According to
Scott, the puppet
"portrays what
everybody is feel
ing during con
sensus meet
ings."
Mark ex
plained that,
"From the nor
mal Stanford stu-

dent's perspective, these meetings
would be seen as inefficient." But,
said Mark, he respects the consen
sus system and sees it as some
thing special that you can't experi
ence anywhere else on campus.
During the first consensus
meeting, held last Monday night,
everyone chose rooms for the quar
ter. Discussion of who should have
which rooms began at 7 p.m., and it
was not until 1 a.m. that everyone
was satisfied and the meeting was
adjourned.
Following the meeting, Arthur
and Mark worked until 5 a.m. mov
ing into their room. By now, Erik
and Scott are also settled into their
room, along with Erik's stuffed
skunk, Flower.
"Flower is in a box right now,"
said Erik, "but I shot her in the
barn a few days before I came to
Stanford. I tied her to the top of my
car and drove her to the taxider
mist. She had been raiding the
chicken coop all summer."
Because Synergy is a coopera

tive, the guys are required to share
in house tasks throughout the
year. This means compost-turn
ing, cooking and cleaning. Erik,
who is the proud owner of a shirt
which proclaims he is a member of
"Manure Movers of America,
Local Chapter 239," could not be
more excited about getting the op
portunity to dig into the compost
pile.
Mark said his mother is very
happy he is living in Synergy be
cause he must share in the cooking
and cleaning.
Arthur is the only one who has
cooked for the house so far. Others
assigned to the kitchen shift with
Arthur kept an e>e on him, since
has never really cooked before.
"I just chopped cucumbers and
tomatoes," Arthur said. "It was
fun."
The house is vegan, a diet
stricter than vegetarianism in
which no dairy products are con
sumed and all food products must
be organic.
At first, Arthur said, "I didn't
even know what organic meant."
The ultimate shock may have come
when Scott realized he could no
longer have pepperoni on his pizza.
After eating at the house for a
week, Arthur said he feels a lot
more healthy. Last week, he went
to Tresidder Union to get a ham
burger and felt extremely tired
after he ate it. He attributes feeling
more alert to his new vegan diet.
Scott, on the other hand, said he
has lost weight. "My first couple of
days here, I think I ate two peanut
butter cookies," he confessed. Now,

he has taken to frying his food as
much as possible to add "taste."
Probably the biggest change for
the group, besides their diets, are
the bathrooms. As former resi
dents of Rinconada, Kimball, and
Serra, they had never before expe
rienced co-ed bathrooms.
Mark admits that the co-ed
bathrooms are probably what he is
most uncomfortable with about
the house.
"At first, I didn't realize they
were coed," he said. "One has a
sign which says men but has the
symbol for women, and the other
has a sign which says women but
has the symbol for men. I was
using the urinal when a woman
walked in, and I was very sur
prised."
Another feature of Synergy the
guys are having a bit of difficulty
adjusting to is the Nookie Room.
The Nookie Room located in a
back corner of the first floor, not
far from Scott and Erik's room, is
the designated sex room for the
house.
Mark said he was exploring and
found the room but "didn't know
what it was." In response, Scott
quipped in his Texan drawl, "Y'all
didn't interrupt anything, did ya?"
The strong community feeling
and the commitment to hear the
voices of all residents at Synergy
will most likely allow the members
of this year's Real World Stanford
and the other residents of Synergy
to learn from each other.
The group feels the Synergy life
is no longer shocking; it is becom
ing their lif< style already.

By the end of the year, Mark
said, living here will "change our
worldview a bit."
Scott, Erik, Mark and Arthur all
said they think "Synergy gets a bad
rap. The people here have been
gracious and have accepted us for
who we are. We are grateful for
that."

Lo and Arthur Chang, this year's
Real World members, had been
hoping for a residence located
close to friends in Governor's
Corner. They listed houses such
as Yost or EAST on their draw
application, both conventional

choices for groups drawing un
preferred.
A main concern for the guys,
when choosing residences, was
food. They all wanted a residence
with an open kitchen. Scott, the
Texan in the group and a man
known to live off of meat, was es
pecially concerned with having a
carnivorous diet.
They got their open kitchen.
The kitchen, however, instead of
coming well stocked with bacon,
hamburgers and ham, contains
items such as soy milk, organic
produce and tofu.
Late last spring, Scott and
Erik were given the news that
they would be living in Synergy
this year. The two had varying
reactions. Eric was left speech
less, while Scott naively ques
tioned, "Where is that?"
With safety houses such as
Durand and Ujamaa, both of
which surged in popularity this
year, the group ended up with a
Draw number too low to be as
signed to any of their choices.
The other roommate pair in
the draw group, Mark and
Arthur, reacted in the same way
as Scott. In fact, no one in the
group had visited Synergy until
after they discovered they had
been assigned to it, and Erik was
the only one who had even heard
of the house.
Friends of the guys, aware of
the Svnergian lifestyle, reacted

with a mixture of shock, amuse
ment and trepidation when they
heard the group's assignment.
Many thought the group would
apply to be on the wait list for
other residences or petition to be
rejoined with two other members
of their draw group who had
ended up in Loro and the French
House.
The group did indeed consider
petitioning. They had many nights
spring quarter when they stayed
up until 5 a.m., discussing what
they should do.
As they learned more about Syn
ergy, Scott, speaking for the group
said, "At first, it was something we
were thinking was just not for us.
We had some concerns about things
Synergy is known for."
In addition, Arthur said, "We
viewed Synergy as a community we
weren't sure if we would be able to
fit in and be accepted to. We felt we
might even be isolated and
shunned."
At the orientation meeting last
spring, the guys learned, according
to Mark, that "pretty much every
one else put Synergy first on their
list except for us." They were re
ferred to as "that Draw group" or
"the guys who didn't want to live
here."
In the end, though, Scott said
the four decided living in Synergy
would be "something we could
learn from." Besides not wanting

to be split up, the group felt there
was a purpose to their living in
Synergy.
"By living in a community we
are not used to, we will learn how
to relate. This assignment was not
an accident," said Scott.
Over this summer, Scott, who is
a member of the Campus Crusade
for Christ and the Stanford soccer
team, went on a mission trip to At
lanta during the Olympics with a
group called Athletes In Action.
Arthur, who is a member of
Stanford's Inter Varsity Christian
Fellowship along with Marc and
Erik, went on a mission trip to
China and visited Taiwan.
When talking about his sum
mer, Mark grinned and said, "I did
not go on a mission trip." He did,
however, take physics at UC-
Berkeley, climb Half Dome and
travel throughout California.
Erik, who hails from Chattaroy,
Wash., a town of 400 people in the
corner of the state near Idaho and
Canada, worked for a start-up
computer company in Mountain
View. He also tried to bike from
Canada to Stanford, but his knees
"gave up" in Oregon.
After returning to Stanford and
spending their first week living in
Synergy, Scott, Eric, Mark and
Arthur are definitely beginning to
learn more about the "things Syn
ergy is known for."
Synergy means "the whole is
greater than the sum of the parts."
Life in Synergy is regulated by
the infamous consensus meeting,
which is used to cultivate strength
through group decisions. Along

with all residents of the house, a
blow-up figure of Munch's "The
Scream" is a regular attendant of
these mandatory, grueling meet-

ings.
According to
Scott, the puppet
"portrays what
everybody is feel
ing during con
sensus meet
ings."
Mark ex
plained that,
"From the nor
mal Stanford stu-

dent's perspective, these meetings
would be seen as inefficient." But,
said Mark, he respects the consen
sus system and sees it as some
thing special that you can't experi
ence anywhere else on campus.
During the first consensus
meeting, held last Monday night,
everyone chose rooms for the quar
ter. Discussion of who should have
which rooms began at 7 p.m., and it
was not until 1 a.m. that everyone
was satisfied and the meeting was
adjourned.
Following the meeting, Arthur
and Mark worked until 5 a.m. mov
ing into their room. By now, Erik
and Scott are also settled into their
room, along with Erik's stuffed
skunk, Flower.
"Flower is in a box right now,"
said Erik, "but I shot her in the
barn a few days before I came to
Stanford. I tied her to the top of my
car and drove her to the taxider
mist. She had been raiding the
chicken coop all summer."
Because Synergy is a coopera

tive, the guys are required to share
in house tasks throughout the
year. This means compost-turn
ing, cooking and cleaning. Erik,
who is the proud owner of a shirt
which proclaims he is a member of
"Manure Movers of America,
Local Chapter 239," could not be
more excited about getting the op
portunity to dig into the compost
pile.
Mark said his mother is very
happy he is living in Synergy be
cause he must share in the cooking
and cleaning.
Arthur is the only one who has
cooked for the house so far. Others
assigned to the kitchen shift with
Arthur kept an e>e on him, since
has never really cooked before.
"I just chopped cucumbers and
tomatoes," Arthur said. "It was
fun."
The house is vegan, a diet
stricter than vegetarianism in
which no dairy products are con
sumed and all food products must
be organic.
At first, Arthur said, "I didn't
even know what organic meant."
The ultimate shock may have come
when Scott realized he could no
longer have pepperoni on his pizza.
After eating at the house for a
week, Arthur said he feels a lot
more healthy. Last week, he went
to Tresidder Union to get a ham
burger and felt extremely tired
after he ate it. He attributes feeling
more alert to his new vegan diet.
Scott, on the other hand, said he
has lost weight. "My first couple of
days here, I think I ate two peanut
butter cookies," he confessed. Now,

he has taken to frying his food as
much as possible to add "taste."
Probably the biggest change for
the group, besides their diets, are
the bathrooms. As former resi
dents of Rinconada, Kimball, and
Serra, they had never before expe
rienced co-ed bathrooms.
Mark admits that the co-ed
bathrooms are probably what he is
most uncomfortable with about
the house.
"At first, I didn't realize they
were coed," he said. "One has a
sign which says men but has the
symbol for women, and the other
has a sign which says women but
has the symbol for men. I was
using the urinal when a woman
walked in, and I was very sur
prised."
Another feature of Synergy the
guys are having a bit of difficulty
adjusting to is the Nookie Room.
The Nookie Room located in a
back corner of the first floor, not
far from Scott and Erik's room, is
the designated sex room for the
house.
Mark said he was exploring and
found the room but "didn't know
what it was." In response, Scott
quipped in his Texan drawl, "Y'all
didn't interrupt anything, did ya?"
The strong community feeling
and the commitment to hear the
voices of all residents at Synergy
will most likely allow the members
of this year's Real World Stanford
and the other residents of Synergy
to learn from each other.
The group feels the Synergy life
is no longer shocking; it is becom
ing their lif< style already.

By the end of the year, Mark
said, living here will "change our
worldview a bit."
Scott, Erik, Mark and Arthur all
said they think "Synergy gets a bad
rap. The people here have been
gracious and have accepted us for
who we are. We are grateful for
that."

There is no doubt that the

groups often pray they will

serious prayer and contempla
