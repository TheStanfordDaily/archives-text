## Four pious men find a challenge in life at Synergy

This is the first installment in
an occasional series. It is the true
story of four "virtuous" men
picked by the Draw to live among
"Synners" for the next year and
have their worldview altered.
Find out what happens when
people stop eating meat and start
scrubbing floors. The Real
World, Stanford.

There is no doubt that the
Draw has its quirks. Draw
groups often pray they will
emerge from the sweepstakes in
tact and comfortably situated in
one of their desired residences.
For the members of this year's
Real World Stanford, however,
serious prayer and contempla
tion did not begin until after they
discovered their housing assign
ment.
Sophomore Scott Dollar and
juniors Erik Nordhagen, Mark
Lo and Arthur Chang, this year's
Real World members, had been
hoping for a residence located
close to friends in Governor's
Corner. They listed houses such
as Yost or EAST on their draw
application, both conventional

choices for groups drawing un
preferred.
A main concern for the guys,
when choosing residences, was
food. They all wanted a residence
with an open kitchen. Scott, the
Texan in the group and a man
known to live off of meat, was es
pecially concerned with having a
carnivorous diet.
They got their open kitchen.
The kitchen, however, instead of
coming well stocked with bacon,
hamburgers and ham, contains
items such as soy milk, organic
produce and tofu.
Late last spring, Scott and
Erik were given the news that
they would be living in Synergy
this year. The two had varying
reactions. Eric was left speech
less, while Scott naively ques
tioned, "Where is that?"
With safety houses such as
Durand and Ujamaa, both of
which surged in popularity this
year, the group ended up with a
Draw number too low to be as
signed to any of their choices.
The other roommate pair in
the draw group, Mark and
Arthur, reacted in the same way
as Scott. In fact, no one in the
group had visited Synergy until
after they discovered they had
been assigned to it, and Erik was
the only one who had even heard
of the house.
Friends of the guys, aware of
the Svnergian lifestyle, reacted
