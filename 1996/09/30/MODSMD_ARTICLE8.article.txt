Richest Americans named
NEW YORK (AP) — From the average Joe to the most bloated
fat cat, Americans have more money. But the richest are a lot
richer and their ranks have swelled by nearly a third.
The 1996 annual ranking of the 400 wealthiest Americans by
Forbes magazine includes a record 121 billionaires, 27 more than
last year.
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett again lead the list with a com
bined fortune between them of $33.5 billion.
Scot dislikes Golden Arches
ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) — If Ronald McDonald — the one
with the big red nose — refuses to consider a name change, a
Scotsman by the same name says he'll take him to court for
clowning around with his heritage.
"I wish to register a complaint about my name being comman
deered by a clown," the retired teacher wrote in a letter to
McDonald's.
