# Clinton to host Middle East talks
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Gambling that he
can defuse tensions and revitalize moribund
peace talks, President Clinton is bringing
feuding Israeli and Palestinians leaders to
the White House for up to two days of talks
after they flatly refused to meet on their own
in the Middle East.
Clinton will participate directly in the ses
sions beginning tomorrow between Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. He will
meet both with them individually and togeth
er, senior administration officials said yester
day.
King Hussein of Jordan is joining the
summit while Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak is weighing the president's invita
tion to come here, as well.
Hussein has proposed appointing a com
mission of inquiry to delve into disputes
surrounding the Temple Mount in

Jerusalem, with its Muslim and Jewish holy
sites.
Netanyahu's unilateral decision last Tues
day to open a second entrance to a tunnel for
tourists ignited a Palestinian uprising that
led to exchanges between Israeli troops and
Palestinian police and exacted scores of casu
alties.
Then, despite a flurry of telephone calls
from Secretary of State Warren Christopher
and other senior U.S. officials, Netanyahu
and Arafat could not agree on terms for a
meeting that was supposed to be held this
weekend at a border crossing between Israel
and Gaza.
The Washington talks are to be held at the
White House and also Blair House, the presi
dential guest house across Pennsylvania
Avenue.
A senior U.S. official, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity, acknowledged Clinton was

taking a political risk in intervening in a
volatile dispute just five weeks before the
presidential election. But, the official said,
"the consequences of a breakdown in the
peace process were evident."
Netanyahu's tough stand — the entrance
was reopened after a temporary closing for
the Muslim and Jewish Sabbaths — could put
Clinton in a position of having to apply pres
sure on the Israeli leader. That could irritate
some of Israel's supporters among the Amer
ican electorate.
On the other hand, Netanyahu may be
ready to offer a concession, such as redeploy
ing Israeli troops in the West Bank town of
Hebron to keep them away from the Arab
majority, and that could make Clinton look
persuasive.
Netanyahu, Arafat and King Hussein all
are due to arrive here late today or early
tomorrow.
