## Campus Republicans, Democrats join in as Kemp comes to town 
### Patrick Bernhardt Contributing writer with AP wire reports 
Jack Kemp, the GOP nominee
for vice president, visited Silicon
Valley yesterday to accept the en
dorsement of 220 computer in
dustry executives in Mountain
View and tour a high school in
Menlo Park.
Speaking to a small crowd of
professionals at Netscape Com
munications Corp., an Internet
software company, he promised
the crowd a more business
friendly environment in a Dole-
Kemp administration.
"We know that this country
can compete with any nation in
the world if we stop the type of
regulations, litigation and taxa
tion that makes America less
competitive and is driving Ameri
can jobs offshore," the former
congressman and housing secre
tary said.
Sophomore Mike Grenier, a
College Republican who attended
the speech at Netscape, was im
pressed that Kemp avoided parti
san attacks, instead confining his
address to explaining Bob Dole's
economic plan.
"He made a clear distinction
between [the Republican 15-per
cent tax cut] plan and the Clinton
record," Grenier said. "Clinton's
record with computers and the
whole Silicon Valley is not very
good. He has opposed bills that

would have helped companies in
the area."
Kemp also spoke at the James
Flood Science and Technology
Magnet School in Menlo Park.
There he praised a four-year
partnership between the school
and Oracle Corp. Kemp looked on
as Larry Ellison, president and
CEO of Oracle, demonstrated the
computers his company is
putting in each classroom. The

computers will link students and
teachers to one another and to
the Internet.
Kemp noted the program
helped improve attendance and
test scores and reduce truancy
and discipline problems.
"This is a model that can be
replicated in every community in
the United States of America,"
the nominee said.
Kemp was greeted at the

school by a group of 75 Clinton-
Gore supporters including a con
tingent of 20 Stanford Democrats
led by junior Dave Thomas, chair
of the group.
Thomas conducted what he
called "rapid response" to shift
the focus from the GOP to Presi
dent Clinton.
