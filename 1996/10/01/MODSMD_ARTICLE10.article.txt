Arafat, Netanyahu to meet
WASHINGTON (AP) - Against a
backdrop of deep distrust and modest U.S.
expectations, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu
headed for a White House summit aimed
at ending an upsurge of violence in the
Mideast and keep flagging peace hopes
alive.
Netanyahu, speaking with reporters on
his plane en route to Washington, offered
to hold continuous negotiations with the
Palestinians after the Washington summit
and "until agreement is reached."
But a senior U.S. official described
Arafat and Netanyahu a" so distrustful of
each other that simply getting them to "re
engage" is the first order of business at the
Washington summit.
Clinton planned to meet separately
today with Netanyahu and then Arafat
before all parties sat down together. A
meeting also was planned for tomorrow.
In a setback for the White House, Egyp

tian President Hosni Mubarak rejected
Clinton's telephone invitation to join Jor
dan's King Hussein as a summit partici
pant.
You can have your cake
DALLAS (AP) â€” So you didn't eat
your vegetables yesterday and you really
overdid it with the double-chocolate cake.
Don't torture yourself with guilt. Just try
to do better in the next few days.
That recommendation comes from the
American Heart Association, which has
issued reduced-guilt guidelines aimed at
getting people to eat right over several
days or a week, instead of obsessing over
every day or every meal.
The guidelines don't change the recom
mended maximum levels of calories, fat
and cholesterol in people's overall diet.
But for the first time, the guidelines cut
people a little slack, allowing them to be
gluttonous one day, if they eat less the rest
of the week.
