# Senate passes budget as fiscal-year ends
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - With just
hours to spare yesterday, a battle
weary Senate sent President Clinton a
$389 billion spending bill for scores of
federal agencies and a tightening of
immigration laws, the Republican-led
104 th Congress' last major legislation.
The catchall bill contains $6.5 bil
lion in extra money that Clinton
demanded for education, drug-fight
ing and other programs and pushes
overall spending nearly as high as it
was before Republicans captured
Congress two years ago.
It also drops GOP-written immigra
tion provisions the White House
argued were too severe, such as one
barring federally paid AIDS care for
illegal immigrants.
The 84-15 vote sent the measure to
Clinton, who promised to sign it so
that the 1997 fiscal year can begin
tomorrow without a rerun of last
year's partial government shutdowns.
Forty-six Democrats and 38 Republi
cans voted for the legislation, while
one Democrat and 14 Republicans
opposed it.

The House approved the measure
Saturday night, 370-37, and with a
pre-election adjournment approach
ing, most of its members immediately
left Washington.
While bent on speeding home for
their re-election races, senators saw
their hopes of adjourning for the year
immediately dimming because of a dis
pute over a separate bill authorizing
air traffic systems.
Democrats complained that it con
tained language to help Federal
Express prevent its truck drivers from
unionizing.
Also percolating was a parks bill
making dozens of land exchanges,
boundary changes and new designa
tions of memorials and historic sites.
Most were not controversial, but
behind-the-scenes battles over adding
additional provisions persisted.
The House approved it Saturday,
404-4.
In an election-year drive to soften
their image, Republicans used the leg
islation to restore spending for pro
grams they had tried to cut since last

year.
For example, they ended up giving
the Department of Education $28.8
billion for 1997, $800 million more
than even Clinton requested for an
agency that House Republicans initial
ly decided to try to eliminate.
The added spending meant that
while the GOP undoubtedly pushed
spending below levels Democrats pre
ferred, they did not keep the budget on
an ever-downward path, according t<
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget
Office.
It also included an extra $1.1 billion
for anti-terrorism, $650 million for
firefighting in the West and $400 mil
lion for victims of Hurricane Fran.
These were to be financed with an auc
tion of parts of the radio spectrum,
dipping into an insurance fund for
financial institutions and using part of
the Pentagon's budget.
The immigration measure would
make it harder for foreigners to enter
illegally and stay in the country by
boosting law enforcement efforts and
reducing benefits they can receive.
