'Save STS' effort shows
students can affect
administrative decisions

LIKE A DEATH Row inmate
who receives a last-minute
executive reprieve, the Pro
gram in Science, Technology and
Society seems to have staved off
execution with the announcement
last week that the search is on to
find a new director for the pro
gram. The news is promising, and
all the students and faculty who
fought for the survival of STS
should feel especially proud of their
efforts.
While the exact chain of events
that led University administrators
to reverse their decision last spring
to discontinue the program is
unclear, two undeniable factors in
the program's resurrection were
strong student interest and contin
uing faculty support. That bears
repeating because the main reason
given last spring for the proposed
elimination of the program's
degree-granting authority was
dearth of faculty support. It is now
clear that the real lack was in
administrative will, not in faculty
commitment.
More importantly, the Universi
ty's reversal on STS illustrates the
power of a well-organized and
articulate student effort to affect
administrative policy. Immediately
after last spring's decision, stu
dents made their displeasure clear
and vocal. STS majors organized a
group called "Save STS" for the
express purpose of protesting the
decision and lobbying the adminis
tration to reconsider. More than
2,000 students signed a "Save
STS" petition; The Daily expressed
its disappointment with the Uni
versity's decision in this box, and
even the ASSU got into the act by
passing a "Save STS" resolution.
The "Save STS" leadership did a
brilliant job in marshaling the
power of student government, in
lobbying the School of Humanities

and Sciences Curriculum Commit
tee, and in rallying faculty to its
cause. And while some in the
administration are leery to give
students credit for a reversal in
University policy (God forbid that
students realize that they can
affect the policies of their school!),
it is clear that the student efforts
were the main impetus in the
administration's decision to recon
sider the STS program's future.
Absent the initiative of "Save
STS" organizers, it is unlikely that
pro-STS faculty members would
have had the confidence or power
to challenge the initial decision.
Those faculty members who did
come forward in support of STS,
especially the 16 who agreed to
devote some real time to the pro
gram, deserve particular praise.
So far, the Departments of Eco
nomics, Sociology and Political Sci
ence have each formed search com
mittees to gather applications for
the director position. The new
director will eventually be chosen
from short lists that those three
departments submit to a School of
Humanities and Sciences selection
committee. The professor who is
selected will be based in one of
those three departments, in addi
tion to his or her duties as STS
director.
Still, those concerned with the
future of STS cannot rest easy just
yet. One worry is that the selection
process for the new director is too
hasty. Departments are being
asked to submit their short lists to
Humanities and Sciences Dean
John Shoven by Nov. 1, which
means that the position is being
publicized mainly through the less
than-ideal word-of-mouth method.
Moreover, it is still unclear
whether the new STS program will
offer a bachelor of science degree as
well as a bachelor of arts degree.
In the end, the lesson is that
intelligent student initiative can
make a difference and can even
force the administration to change
course on the most important of
issues.
