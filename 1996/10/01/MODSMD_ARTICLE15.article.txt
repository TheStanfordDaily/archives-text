## Gerhard Casper Intelligent choice-making on the Farm 
### 
A DOZEN OR so
undergraduates
and I, during an
evening of milk and cook
ies at the house, got into a
discussion of all the
things there are to do at
Stanford: choosing cours
es, taking courses, writ
ing research papers,
meeting requirements,

learning a foreign language, electing a
major, perhaps choosing a minor (or
should it be a dual major?), attending an
overseas campus, engaging in public ser
vice, hiking in the foothills, or deciding
how best to train for the Olympics or what
a cappella group to join, and on and on.
Finally, a student turned to me in utter
exasperation: "You know, we have no time
to go out on dates. You really need to do
something about that!"
Ah, yes, that is what a university presi
dent is for. Alas, to this, and every Stan
ford student, I can only say, "Welcome to
adulthood!" Choices and trade-offs are
unavoidable. I use the term trade-off here
in the sense of a sacrifice made in one area
to obtain a benefit in another.
At the University, you frequently are
called upon to make choices. Stanford does
impose requirements and provide guidance
and advice, but in the end, no one can tell
you what to choose. In welcoming this fall's
new students, I offered a few suggestions
about how to think about making choices.
First, not choosing is in itself a choice.
In some circumstances, like not voting,

that means abdicating the choice to others.
At a university, abdication is rarely the
issue, since in many circumstances univer
sities leave their students no choice but to
make a choice. At a university, not to
choose more often means delaying a choice
or scattering attention across too many
activities, thus depriving yourself of the
pleasure that comes from pursuing some
activity with intensity and depth.
Having said that, you should not choose
too early. Robert Oppenheimer, the great
physicist, in 1932 wrote to his younger
brother, who seemed to be settling on a
particular course of study: "But let me
urge you with every earnestness to keep an
open mind: to cultivate a disinterested and
catholic interest in every intellectual disci
pline, and in the non-academic excellences
of the world, so that you may not lose that
freshness of mind from which alone the
life of the mind derives, and that your
choice, whatever it be, of work to do, may
be a real choice, and one reasonably free."
I could not agree more.
The very concept of choice suggests
deliberateness, a "real choice," as Oppen
heimer said. For that, you need the foun
dation in learning and experience that you
gain by seizing the initiative and seeking
out the incredible range of opportunities
that Stanford has to offer. The conundrum
is that, while searching widely, you must
keep in mind that less may be more and
choose selectively. Remember that there is
much one can do, but in the end, as the
saying goes, "you can only do so much."
Whatever the choice, once it is made,

you must participate. In an essay on her
freshman experience, Stanford sophomore
Amy writes: "The word that comes to my
mind after my first week of discussion sec
tions at Stanford is intimidation. I felt that
everyone was more intelligent than 1....
Soon I realized that my insecurities were
unfounded and that my lack of participa
tion in section prevented me from forming
my own ideas. I gradually became more
involved in discussions and found that the
more I contributed to a section the more
valuable it became."
Indeed! The quality of your experience
and choices depends on active participa
tion in the unceasing process of inquiry.
Finally, it behooves all of us to maintain
a sense of modesty about the deliberate
ness of our choices, as the French Renais
sance essayist Michel de Montaigne
expressed forcefully in his famous essay
"On the Art of Discussion": "[Even] our
wisdom and deliberation for the most part
follow the lead of chance. My will and my
reasoning are stirred this way and that."
There can be no doubt that serendipity
plays a role in your choices, as it certainly
has in mine throughout my life.
Stanford very deliberately provides you
with curriculum and academic programs
and with lively and frank association with
educated people. If all of this is in place,
chance and choice can do their work. As
somebody said to me the other day:
"Chance favors the prepared mind only."
