# Loss of Economics 140 will prove costly to students
## 
### 
LAST WEEK, A friend of mine told
me that "Economics 140: Finan
cial Economics" was not going to
be offered during the 1996-97 academic
year. I found this news to be both meta
physically shocking and saddening. Not
only will the members of the Class of
1997 be unable to take a superb course,
but the absence of Economics 140 in the
Bulletin this year may have severe rami
fications for Stanford recruiting.
Economics 140 provides a solid
overview of financial markets, as well as
a disciplined study of financial economic
theory. Even if one does not intend to
work on Wall Street, it is important to
gain an understanding of the risk /
return analysis inherent in every finan
cial investment decision; this knowledge
is crucial for anyone planning to save for
retirement, a child's college tuition,
etc. ... In essence, Economics 140 is
arguably the most useful course at Stan

ford, as one obtains "real world" skills in
addition to the theory. At the very mini
mum, students walk out of the class
knowing how to read the financial pages
of a newspaper, something which I sus
pect most graduating seniors are inca
p ible of doing.
Furthermore, there is a more serious
issue, and that concerns the opportuni
ties for Stanford students to find jobs.
Seniors seeking employment after gradu
ation will soon discover that the majority
of non-engineering jobs at the Career
Planning and Placement Center are
either in management consulting or
investment banking.
Traditionally, Economics 140 has been
considered an imperative for those con
templating obtaining a financial analyst
position at an investment bank. While
candidates are by no means expected to
know the Black and Scholes option pric
ing formula in their investment banking

interviews, they are encouraged to have a
basic knowledge of capital raising and at
the very least to know the difference
between a stock and a bond. How can one
can effectively articulate the desire to be
an investment banker if one does not even
know what an investment bank does?
Most investment banks do not have a
"Stanford quota," as the number of stu
dents hired will be determined by how
many candidates they like relative to
other schools. Unfortunately, because
Economics 140 is not offered this year,
seniors will be on average much less pre
pared for investment banking interviews
than in years past.
Imagine the classic interview in which
an intelligent Stanford economics student
is made to look like a speechless idiot by
the question, "What factors do you think
determine a company's stock price?" This
scene is repeated several times every
year, and because Economics 140 is not

offered, I suspect that this year will be a
record. In all probability, some analyst
slots will be lost to Harvard, Princeton,
UC-Berkeley and Stanford's other main
competitors. The loss of those slots may
also have consequences for those seeking
positions in management consulting, as
students who otherwise would have
received investment banking offers will
now compete for the limited number of
positions in that field.
I realize that the University has finite
resources and that it is not feasible to
offer every class every year. However,
few classes could be considered so
important as Economics 140, for person
al knowledge and for post-graduation
employment opportunities. The Univer
sity's decision to deprive seniors of the
opportunity to take Economics 140 is
irresponsible and highly unfortunate.
