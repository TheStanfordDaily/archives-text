# Dedication to social justice earns support for Green Party's Nader
## 
### 
Hearty thanks to Rudolph Delson for
his Campus Viewpoint (Sept. 25) encour
aging progressives to vote with good con
science by supporting Ralph Nader and
Wynona LaDuke of the Green Party.
Like Mr. Delson, I have also struggled
with the notion of casting my vote for the

lesser of two dismals, particularly since
Clinton signed the "Defense of Marriage
Act" on Sept. 21.
I could have sworn that the "real"
defense marriage needed to reduce the
more than 51 percent divorce rate was
introspective self-knowledge, good com
munication skills, commitment and vigor
ous honesty by the participants. Marriage
certainly needed no "defense" from les
bians and gay men who want the same
legal protections and social recognition
for our families and children as non-gays
have without pause.
The act is a useless, mean-spirited

slap to the American family. Shame on
you, Bill Clinton, for giving in to the
ignorant (but well-organized) religious
right hate-mongers who pretend to
honor American families and support
reduced government while reaching out
a legislative dagger to stab our lesbian
and gay families (and isolate our chil
dren from the equal legal protections of
marriage).
Because of this and other draconian
social and economic policies supported
by my registered party, I'll be voting my
conscience for Nader, LaDuke and the
following Ten Key Values of the Green

Party (http://www.greens.org/califor
nia/pl_lok_v.html): ecological wisdom,
grass-roots democracy, social justice,
nonviolence, decentralization, commu
nity-based economics, feminism, respect
for diversity, personal and global
responsibility, and future focus.
Remember, you must register to vote
by Oct. 7 to be eligible to vote your con
science in the Nov. 5 election. You must
re-register each time you change your
address.
