## Soccer gets hot in the desert Card wins two to claim the Arizona Eiger Classic 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Although it got off to a rocky start, the
Stanford women's soccer team (6-3) fin
ished strong this past weekend to knock

off Arizona 3-2 and Wyoming 6-0 in the
Arizona Eiger Classic.
The Cardinal came out flat on Friday
against the Wildcats (2-6), falling behind
2-0 in the first 10 minutes.
"They just came out harder than us at

the start," said senior forward Erin Mar
tin. "We probably shouldn't have let them
score at all. Once we decided to start play
ing, we scored three goals and controlled
the game."
Coach Steve Swanson said his team was

physically ready to play on Friday, but the
mental game just wasn't there early.
"We weren't talking enough, and we
were out of sync with one another," Swan
son said. "I had said that the key to the
game was in the opening minutes, and we
dug ourselves a big hole. It was not looking
good for us at all. They scored good goals,
but if we had been mentally into it, we
probably would've stopped them."
But despite being down 2-0 to its Pacif
ic 10 Conference rivals on foreign turf,
Stanford did not panic and assumed con
trol of the match. Within 3 minutes of Ari
zona's second score, sophomore midfielder
Christy Stoffel carried the ball down the
left side to the edge of the 18-yard box
where she laid the ball off to sophomore
forward Charmaine Leßlanc. Leßlanc
moved the ball across to Martin who fired
a long shot from 25 yards out.
"I saw that the goalie was a little bit off
her line, and I was pretty far out," Martin
said. "I shot it and got it in over her head."
"Erin's goal really got us back on
track," Swanson said. "We knew we could
win the game, and her shot put us right
back in it."
Just before the half the Cardinal struck
again. This time, freshman midfielder
Ronnie Fair fired a long cross over the Ari
zona defense to a waiting Leßlanc.
ließlanc played the ball out of the air and
drilled a volley into the upper right corner
of the cage.
Stanford continued to dominate play in
the second half but was unable to finish
any of its many scoring opportunities early
on. Finally, with about 15 minutes re
maining in the contest, Leßlanc played a
beautiful pass to senior midfielder Mandy
Tucker in front of the goal. Tucker slid
into the ball, one-timing it past the keeper
and into the back of the net. The Cardinal
defense shut down its Wildcat counter
parts the rest of the way, sealing the victo
ry.
"For us to come back, down 2-0 away,
shows a lot of character," said Swanson.

"We maintained our composure, played
hard and won."
Tucker's game-winning effort was the
highlight of an all-around excellent week
end for the senior. She started her first two
games of the season and in addition to the
goal against Arizona, notched three assists
against Wyoming.
Tucker "played awfully well," Swanson
said. "She really made a lot of things hap
pen out there, created a lot of good oppor
tunities for us."
"I'm definitely excited," Tucker said.
"We've had a lot of injuries, and I felt like I
needed to step up. It was good for us as a
team that myself and a lot of the usual
subs were able to get some time and expe
rience."
In addition to Tucker's outstanding
performance against the Cowgirls (2-7),
sophomore goalkeepers Erin Bryla and
Lisa Brooks combined for a shutout. It was
the team's fourth of the season.
Leßlanc and Fair added two more goals.
Martin added another goal to her season
tally, and Stoffel scored her first collegiate
goal.
"I thought (Fair] and (junior midfield
er) Elie Foster played really well in the
middle," Swanson said of his latest center
midfielder combination. "They really
helped us possess the ball, and control the
pace of the game.
"We also got some excellent play from
players who don't normally get as much
time and from players who may have been
playing in new positions. I was pleased
with the way the whole team stepped up."
That step-up was required to replace
the likes of senior Emily Burt, who had
been starting at forward, sophomore Kelly
Adamson, one of the team's top scorers
from a year ago, junior midfielder Rita
Hermiz, and sophomore midfielder Tracye
Lawyer, who are all currently injured. Al
though it is uncertain when these players
will return, the team is hoping they will be
able to return within the next couple
weeks.
