# Toyon Eating Clubs may be moving
## 
### Kelly E. Young Contributing writer 
The Toyon Eating Clubs may be in their last
few years in the L-shaped building behind
Toyon Hall.
Because of aging facilities and a scheduled
capital improvement program at the dormito
ry, the eating clubs may be forced to relocate or
renovate as early as the turn of the century.
Ideally, said Director of Housing and Dining
Services Keith Guy, the change would take
place the same time as the improvements to
the dormitory, which are slated for the sum
mer of 2000.

"They can't shut us down until they've got
somewhere to put us," assured junior Aaron
Williamson, eating clubs financial manager
and vice president.
Guy stressed that the project is still in the
preliminary stages, and those involved are still
considering many options.
The least expensive option is to move the
four clubs directly behind Toyon, extending
the facility to Branner Hall's kitchen. This
would create a small courtyard between Toyon
and Branner.
"This would represent a change in the way
that the eating clubs work," Guy said, because
the clubs would have less total square footage.

The Branner option is also the least favor
able option for the eating club managers.
"This space would make it impractical to
have partition dining rooms," said eating clubs
Generai Manager Nick Peters, Class of '94,
adding that the partitions are part of what
gives the current building a "club feel."
He added that if the clubs were put directly
behind Toyon, the University could use the
extra space for parking for the new Schwab
Residential Center being built in the same
area.
Another option is to relocate the clubs to the
south side of Toyon, adjacent to
Escondido Road. This would take
away some student parking, but it
would also allow the possibility of
building a program center on east
campus. The program center
would host speakers and student
groups.
Still another option is to reno
vate the current building.
Peters said he believes several
factors contributed to the Univer
sity's interest in relocating the
clubs.
First, he said, their location

across the street from the new
Schwab Residential Center in
creases the value of the property.
"We realize we're sitting on
some prime real estate," he said.
Peters said the age of the build
ing, which was dedicated in 1951,
also played a major role in the in
terest to renovate.
"We admit [the building's]
ugly," he said. "It has a charm and
a funk to it."
Peters and Williamson offered
several reasons for the eating
clubs to remain in their current lo
cation.
The eating clubs operate as a
private business, hiring non-stu
dents as employees. As a private
organization, the eating clubs

must cover the kitchen facilities
overhead fee, something Row
houses get around by charging a
higher room rate.
"What we'd like to see is the
University taking care of the over
head," Peters said.
The Toyon Eating Clubs also
sponsor social events such as
weekly parties, luaus, a boat dance
and a ski trip.
"We combine the best of dorm
life with the best of Row life and
still keep it professional," Peters
said.
Peters wanted to encourage
students not affiliated with Toyon
or the eating clubs to offer their
"blanket opinion" by serving on an
advisory committee which would

take a look at the current facility
situation. Anyone interested can
call Peters for more information.
Peters and Williamson are cur
rently in the process of compiling a
book that will draw parallels be
tween "what was going on in the
world, what was going on in the
University and what was going on
in the eating clubs" from the
founding of the clubs in 1894 until
present day. Peters requested sto
ries, recipes and other anecdotes
from former club members. He
said more than 20 instances of eat
ing club members getting married
to each other have been recorded.
The book will help raise money
to be placed in a savings fund for
the new building.
