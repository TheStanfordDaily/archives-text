# And the winner is...

### 
These coveted words pre
cede the presentation of
such notable awards as
the Oscars, Emmys, Grammys
and many other statue-bearing

prizes.
Now I'd like to add to this list
one more prestigious award.
Unfortunately it doesn't come

with an obscure-looking statue.
All you get is the notoriety of
being named a winner by the
Robin Davidson Academy of
Sports.
Each entry was submitted to
the Academy and reviewed by a
panel of judges until the final
decisions were made (which
means that I decided totally on
my own and sometimes at ran
dom who would win).
Here is a list of the cate
gories with first place and the
runner-up for each section.
Some of the categories have
been further divided into male
and female winners, and al
though the categories could be
divided into three different
areas (serious, not so serious

and totally out of my butt), they
appear below in no particular
order.
Almost a sure thing
First place:
Women's swimming and
diving — Admit it. By now
you've come to expect this
squad to bring home an NCAA
championship. In recent years
it's happened more often than
Tom Hanks has won an Oscar.
Defending champions since
1992, these women don't know
how to lose, so don't expect
them to learn this year. If
you're a betting person, put
your money in the pool.


Robin
Davidson
Runner-up:
Women's basketball — After
two straight trips to the Final
Four without an appearance in
the finals, this experienced squad
will be hungry for a title. The
coaching staff is complete, and the
team returns five starters and
enough depth at the post to field
the entire conference. Couple that
with some top freshmen to back
up the guards, and you've got a
team that finally has all the tools
to take it to the top.
Team on the rise
First-place winners:
Women's soccer — A new
coach has added new life to the
program and brought back some
key players missing from last
year's squad. The team has im
proved to 6-3 with losses only to
Duke, North Carolina and Santa
Clara. These women are moving
up in the ranks quickly and should
make a run at the postseason.
Field hockey — We have a tie
for the women. The field hockey
team adds several new frosh to a
balanced team for a powerful

punch. Stanford is the defending
NorPac champion and is in great
shape to repeat this season. Look
for these women to make a big
splash in the postseason.
Men's water polo — After
back-to-back NCAA titles in 1993
and 1994, the Cardinal was
stunned by Pepperdine in last
year's bid for a third straight.
This year's team is younger and
less experienced than most of
coach Dante Dettamanti's squads
but hasn't been fazed thus far.
Stanford has already exacted re
venge on Pepperdine and has
taken out several top teams. Look
for water polo to climb back into
the ranks of the elite in '96.
Runncrs-up:
Softball — This program has
nowhere to go but up. Last year's
youthful squad more than
quadrupled Stanford's success
from previous seasons, and with a
new coach and hopefully a new
field, the softball program can po
tentially catch fire this season.
Men's soccer — It was almost
a clean sweep for soccer. Maybe
it's a Dartmouth thing, I don't
know. The men's program is on
the brink of big things. The
team's 4-2-2 record doesn't reflect
the strides these guys have made
this season, so expect them to con

tinue to improve in 1996.
Biggest absence left by an
athlete
First place:
Tiger Woods — This award is
a definite no-brainer and de
serves no explanation, but I'll
give you one anyway. Three U.S.
Amateur titles and one NCAA
crown made Woods the most fa
mous amateur golfer ever. But
after $40 million from Nike and
enough success on the pro tour to
earn his money card, Woods is
now arguably the most famous
professional golfer.
Note from the Academy: This
award was so lopsided we chose
not to list a runner-up.
Most enthusiastic fans
First place:
Sixth Man Club — If you've
ever been to a men's basketball
game you know why the Sixth
Man deserves this award. Their
impact on the games is undeni
able. The Cardinal overcomes all
odds at home and defeats impres
sive teams like UCLA and Cal, but
on the road Stanford struggles. I
can only imagine how far the men
might go if the early rounds of the
tournament were held at Maples.
Note from the Academy: The Sixth

Mun Club also won awards in the
categories of "wittiest hecklers"
and "Superfan's biggest support
group."
Runner-up:
Phi Delts — These guys sup
port their own at men's volleyball
matches and were a close second
to the Sixth Man Club. The deter
mining factor was that I am often
among the Sixth Man Club at bas
ketball games and really, really
wanted the award.
Note from the Academy: The Phi
Delts also won the award for
"Most offensive to adults and
small children." Congrats guys,
we're proud.
Best conditioned athletes
First place:
Any athlete living in Ster
ling Quad — There is no runner
up for this category. No place on
earth is farther from the athletic
facilities than the West Campus
suburbs. Athletes with cars don't
qualify for this category unless, of
course, they ride their bikes to
practice every day.
Runner-up:
The teams who have early
morning weights (which could
apply to most any sport at a par
ticular time in the year) or 6 a.m.
practices.

Most animated coach
First place:
Dante Dettamanti, men's
water polo — Just sit in on one
water polo match and you'll un
derstand why Dante deserves this
award. No other coach has Detta
manti's timing and skill for in
serting the most hilarious and ap
propriate responses to some ac
tion in the pool. Dettamanti calls
it like he sees it with no consider
ation to who overhears his blatant
and usually comical remarks.
Runner-up:
Mike Montgomery, men's
basketball — Montgomery's seat
is probably the best in Maples for
viewing a men's game, mostly be
cause he's never in it. Montgomery
gets into every play of every game.
Who knows, if I were able to over
hear Montgomery's comments he
might edge Dettamanti out of the
top spot. But for now Dante's
humor gives him the advantage.
Most likely to get misidenti
fied in a caption
Note from the Academy: This
award is in no way a reflection on
the sport itself but merely a jab at
the unsuspecting sports editors.
First place:
Any team whose uni's don't
contain numbers — This list in

eludes sailing, golf, cross country,
wrestling, track and field, crew and
fencing. The task of naming a play
er in a photo caption becomes astro
nomically more difficult when there
is no roster by which to check num
bers. Our apologies to the victims.
Runner-up:
Any team whose uni's do
contain numbers — What can I
say? We're not perfect.
Most likely to injure a specta
tor
First place:
Women's volleyball — Have
you people seen how hard the
women hit the ball? My advice for
anyone going to a game: Don't sit
in the front row, you could be
taken out by a ricocheting ball.
Runner-up:
Football — The danger here
doesn't come from the sport itself
but from the balance-impaired
fans. (I swear it's just water, offi
cer.) Tailgating is an art that
many Stanford fans have perfect
ed much to their endangerment.
So if you see a fellow student
struggling to maintain his bal
ance, help him out before he falls
and hurts himself or someone else.

is probably the best in Maples for
viewing a men's game, mostly be
cause he's never in it. Montgomery
gets into every play of every game.
Who knows, if I were able to over
hear Montgomery's comments he
might edge Dettamanti out of the
top spot. But for now Dante's
humor gives him the advantage.

Note from the Academy: This
award is in no way a reflection on
the sport itself but merely a jab at
the unsuspecting sports editors.
First place:
Any team whose uni's don't
contain numbers — This list in

eludes sailing, golf, cross country,
wrestling, track and field, crew and
fencing. The task of naming a play
er in a photo caption becomes astro
nomically more difficult when there
is no roster by which to check num
bers. Our apologies to the victims.
Runner-up:
Any team whose uni's do

say? We're not perfect.
Most likely to injure a specta
tor
First place:
Women's volleyball — Have
you people seen how hard the
women hit the ball? My advice for
anyone going to a game: Don't sit
in the front row, you could be
taken out by a ricocheting ball.
Runner-up:
Football — The danger here
doesn't come from the sport itself
but from the balance-impaired
fans. (I swear it's just water, offi
cer.) Tailgating is an art that
many Stanford fans have perfect
ed much to their endangerment.
So if you see a fellow student
struggling to maintain his bal
ance, help him out before he falls
and hurts himself or someone else.

Robin reminds the winners not to
wait for a check in the mail.
These coveted words pre
cede the presentation of
such notable awards as
the Oscars, Emmys, Grammys
and many other statue-bearing

prizes.
Now I'd like to add to this list
one more prestigious award.
Unfortunately it doesn't come

with an obscure-looking statue.
All you get is the notoriety of
being named a winner by the
Robin Davidson Academy of
Sports.
Each entry was submitted to
the Academy and reviewed by a
panel of judges until the final
decisions were made (which
means that I decided totally on
my own and sometimes at ran
dom who would win).
Here is a list of the cate
gories with first place and the
runner-up for each section.
Some of the categories have
been further divided into male
and female winners, and al
though the categories could be
divided into three different
areas (serious, not so serious

and totally out of my butt), they
appear below in no particular
order.
Almost a sure thing
First place:
Women's swimming and
diving — Admit it. By now
you've come to expect this
squad to bring home an NCAA
championship. In recent years
it's happened more often than
Tom Hanks has won an Oscar.
Defending champions since
1992, these women don't know
how to lose, so don't expect
them to learn this year. If
you're a betting person, put
your money in the pool.


Robin
Davidson
Runner-up:
Women's basketball — After
two straight trips to the Final
Four without an appearance in
the finals, this experienced squad
will be hungry for a title. The
coaching staff is complete, and the
team returns five starters and
enough depth at the post to field
the entire conference. Couple that
with some top freshmen to back
up the guards, and you've got a
team that finally has all the tools
to take it to the top.
Team on the rise
First-place winners:
Women's soccer — A new
coach has added new life to the
program and brought back some
key players missing from last
year's squad. The team has im
proved to 6-3 with losses only to
Duke, North Carolina and Santa
Clara. These women are moving
up in the ranks quickly and should
make a run at the postseason.
Field hockey — We have a tie
for the women. The field hockey
team adds several new frosh to a
balanced team for a powerful

punch. Stanford is the defending
NorPac champion and is in great
shape to repeat this season. Look
for these women to make a big
splash in the postseason.
Men's water polo — After
back-to-back NCAA titles in 1993
and 1994, the Cardinal was
stunned by Pepperdine in last
year's bid for a third straight.
This year's team is younger and
less experienced than most of
coach Dante Dettamanti's squads
but hasn't been fazed thus far.
Stanford has already exacted re
venge on Pepperdine and has
taken out several top teams. Look
for water polo to climb back into
the ranks of the elite in '96.
Runncrs-up:
Softball — This program has
nowhere to go but up. Last year's
youthful squad more than
quadrupled Stanford's success
from previous seasons, and with a
new coach and hopefully a new
field, the softball program can po
tentially catch fire this season.
Men's soccer — It was almost
a clean sweep for soccer. Maybe
it's a Dartmouth thing, I don't
know. The men's program is on
the brink of big things. The
team's 4-2-2 record doesn't reflect
the strides these guys have made
this season, so expect them to con

tinue to improve in 1996.
Biggest absence left by an
athlete
First place:
Tiger Woods — This award is
a definite no-brainer and de
serves no explanation, but I'll
give you one anyway. Three U.S.
Amateur titles and one NCAA
crown made Woods the most fa
mous amateur golfer ever. But
after $40 million from Nike and
enough success on the pro tour to
earn his money card, Woods is
now arguably the most famous
professional golfer.
Note from the Academy: This
award was so lopsided we chose
not to list a runner-up.
Most enthusiastic fans
First place:
Sixth Man Club — If you've
ever been to a men's basketball
game you know why the Sixth
Man deserves this award. Their
impact on the games is undeni
able. The Cardinal overcomes all
odds at home and defeats impres
sive teams like UCLA and Cal, but
on the road Stanford struggles. I
can only imagine how far the men
might go if the early rounds of the
tournament were held at Maples.
Note from the Academy: The Sixth

Mun Club also won awards in the
categories of "wittiest hecklers"
and "Superfan's biggest support
group."
Runner-up:
Phi Delts — These guys sup
port their own at men's volleyball
matches and were a close second
to the Sixth Man Club. The deter
mining factor was that I am often
among the Sixth Man Club at bas
ketball games and really, really
wanted the award.
Note from the Academy: The Phi
Delts also won the award for
"Most offensive to adults and
small children." Congrats guys,
we're proud.
Best conditioned athletes
First place:
Any athlete living in Ster
ling Quad — There is no runner
up for this category. No place on
earth is farther from the athletic
facilities than the West Campus
suburbs. Athletes with cars don't
qualify for this category unless, of
course, they ride their bikes to
practice every day.
Runner-up:
The teams who have early
morning weights (which could
apply to most any sport at a par
ticular time in the year) or 6 a.m.
practices.

Most animated coach
First place:
Dante Dettamanti, men's
water polo — Just sit in on one
water polo match and you'll un
derstand why Dante deserves this
award. No other coach has Detta
manti's timing and skill for in
serting the most hilarious and ap
propriate responses to some ac
tion in the pool. Dettamanti calls
it like he sees it with no consider
ation to who overhears his blatant
and usually comical remarks.
Runner-up:
Mike Montgomery, men's
basketball — Montgomery's seat
is probably the best in Maples for
viewing a men's game, mostly be
cause he's never in it. Montgomery
gets into every play of every game.
