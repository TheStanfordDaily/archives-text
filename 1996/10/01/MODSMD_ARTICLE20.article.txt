# And the winner is...
## 
### 
These coveted words pre
cede the presentation of
such notable awards as
the Oscars, Emmys, Grammys
and many other statue-bearing

prizes.
Now I'd like to add to this list
one more prestigious award.
Unfortunately it doesn't come

with an obscure-looking statue.
All you get is the notoriety of
being named a winner by the
Robin Davidson Academy of
Sports.
Each entry was submitted to
the Academy and reviewed by a
panel of judges until the final
decisions were made (which
means that I decided totally on
my own and sometimes at ran
dom who would win).
Here is a list of the cate
gories with first place and the
runner-up for each section.
Some of the categories have
been further divided into male
and female winners, and al
though the categories could be
divided into three different
areas (serious, not so serious

and totally out of my butt), they
appear below in no particular
order.
Almost a sure thing
First place:
Women's swimming and
diving â€” Admit it. By now
you've come to expect this
squad to bring home an NCAA
championship. In recent years
it's happened more often than
Tom Hanks has won an Oscar.
Defending champions since
1992, these women don't know
how to lose, so don't expect
them to learn this year. If
you're a betting person, put
your money in the pool.
