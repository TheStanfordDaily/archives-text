# Kribel swings big at the Rolex

### Jeff Ellingson 
Although the Stanford men's golf team suf
fered a tremendous loss this year when junior
phenom Tiger Woods announced he would join
the pro circuit, the squad showed its readiness for
another successful season at the Rolex Collegiate
Golf Tournament last weekend.
Finishing 12th in the team standings and plac
ing one golfer in the top five, Wally Goodwin's
squad promises to continue delivering victories to
the Cardinal with or without Woods. Stanford's
score of 897 (300-299-298) was consistent but
well below the top of the leader board. North Car
olina won the invitational with a score of 852
(290-285-277), coming from behind to knock off
second-place Tulsa (289-274-292 — 855).
Leading the Stanford team was sophomore
Joel Kribel, who clinched the second-place title on
Sunday, finishing with a total score of 209, 4
strokes under par. Kribel jumped to the lead early
with a first-round score of 71. That was good
enough to tie for second place with many other
golfers.
In the second round, Kribel's improved score
of 69 was not enough to maintain his position as
he fell to third behind both Martin Maritz of the
Golden Hurricane and Ted Haley of the Tar
Heels.
Kribel stormed back in the final round with an
other 69, tying for the second-lowest score of the
day and was poised to win until Maritz birdied the
final hole to capture the title.
Also competing in the three-day tournament
for the Cardinal were senior Conrad Ray, juniors
Eri Crum and Jake Poe and sophomore Scott
Wang.
The consistent Ray was Stanford's second-best
finisher, placing 57th by shooting 77s in each
round for an 18-over-par 231. Crum scored a 19-
over-par 232 (74-76-82) and came in tied for 60th
place, while Poe (82-77-75) and Wang (78-79-77)
finished in a logjam for 69th with 234, 21-over
par.
