# Volleyball takes break from Pac-10 action against Sac St.
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team (10-1 overall, 4-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) will look to
dominate yet another visiting op
ponent when it hosts Sacramento
State tonight at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
The Cardinal enters the
match ranked fourth in the na
tion coming off impressive victo
ries over lOth-ranked Washing
ton State and No. 18 Washing
ton. So far this season Stanford
is undefeated at home with a 4-0
mark.
Sacramento State, a former
top-notch Division II school,
joined the Division I ranks only a
couple of seasons ago. The Hor
nets have a 9-5 record and are
currently not ranked in the top
25. Although this match may ap
pear to have blowout written all
over it, coach Don Shaw begs to
differ.
"Under most circumstances,
this match is cause for wonder
ing, 'Why in the world would we
schedule Sacramento State?' "
Shaw said. "But they beat Pacific
in four games, and they are capa
ble of playing very well."
Indeed, the Card's only blem
ish on its near-perfect record
came at the hands of UOP. The
visiting Cardinal found itself
under a barrage of aggressive
serves and dropped the match in
four games. Two nights later,
Sacramento State manhandled
the Tigers.
"I think that win helped us a
lot," said Sacramento State head
coach Debbie Colbert. "We have
done pretty well against the big
schools this season."
Stanford will rely more heavi
ly upon its deep bench in order to
give more players significant
playing time. Having a potent
bench comes in especially handy
for the Card since today's match
will be its third in five days.
"The bench will play a key
role," Shaw said. "But that is not
to take Sacramento State lightly.
Even with our reserves, our exe
cution level should stay high."
Although not a big team, Col
bert's squad will attempt to offset
the powerful Stanford hitters
with tough serves and try to keep
the Cardinal off the net.
The Hornets will probably rely
heavily on 5-foot-8 outside hitter
Jill Haas, who despite facing
tough defensive schemes night
after night has carried much of
the load for the Sacramento State
squad this year.

"To accomplish what she does
with her size is quite an accom
plishment," Colbert said. "What
is distinguishing about her is her
intensity."
Sacramento State may suffer
the same fate as Cardinal visitors

of the recent past, but this team
will not visit the Farm cowering
in fear.
"Our track record against top
teams is good," Colbert said. "I
don't think we are the type to get
intimidated."
