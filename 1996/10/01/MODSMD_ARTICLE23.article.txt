A report authored by Stanford researchers
sheds light on the mechanisms of cytomegalovirus
(CMV), a potentially fatal member of the herpes
family that attacks people with weakened immune
systems.
The paper appears in today's issue of the Pro
ceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Led by Edward Mocarski, chair of the Depart
ment of Microbiology and Immunology at the
School of Medicine, the scientists analyzed human
bone marrow and discovered genes of latent CMV
in cells involved in generating white blood cells.
According to Mocarski, roughly 50 percent of
residents of suburban areas such as Stanford are
infected with CMV. The number ranges between
90 and 100 percent in urban centers and underde
veloped nations.
CMV can be transmitted by sexual contact or
other exchange of bodily fluids, as well as from
mother to child during pregnancy or at birth. It
generally causes no serious symptoms and remains

latent thereafter.
However, CMV can be deadly to individuals
whose immune systems have been compromised.
This makes the virus a threat to premature infants
and a major killer among AIDS patients and trans
plant recipients, according to Mocarski.
Mocarski said the report addresses major ques
tions about the life-long latency of CMV. It was previ
ously unclear, for example, where in the human body
th',s virus resides and what its genetic composition is.
Mocarski hopes scientists can learn to predict
the re-emergence of CMV by getting a better idea of
how it activates. His research may contribute to a
future quest for a vaccine.
In addition, he said, while "it is already possible
to scan for the likelihood of CMV, (the research)
will make the tests more precise."
Since such a high proportion of the population
has CMV, infected organ or blood donors are usu
ally not excluded. By measuring the quantity of la
tent CMV, clinicians can now identify those with
the highest level of infection. This knowledge can
help to develop appropriate treatments for trans
plant recipients.
