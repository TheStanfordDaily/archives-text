# Post office negotiations crawling
## Officials look at mailing options 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
The stagnant
condition of ne
gotiations on a
new lease for the
Stanford post of
fice has left offi
cials pondering
the branch's fu
ture and examin
ing alternatives.
A 35-year lease

between the Stanford Manage
ment Co. and the post office ex
pired in February 1995. Since
then, the two corporations have
negotiated a new lease every
month, leaving the campus in
limbo about the future of postal
services.
Post office officials say they are
unhappy with the current facility

and are anxious to conclude nego
tiations with Stanford for a larger
space.
"We have been waiting since
the spring of 1995 for a proposal,"
said Glen Kwan, the U.S. Postal
Service's real estate specialist for
the San Francisco district. "Stan
ford needs to respond with an al
ternative facility to meet our
needs."
Leonie Batkin, a Stanford
Management Co. representative,
said negotiations are still proceed
ing.
"We are discussing the possibil
ity of moving the distribution
setup elsewhere and leaving the
post office boxes in their current
location," Batkin said.
Kwan said the ball is now in
Stanford's court to come up with a


Shen
proposal for alternate space.
"It seems like there is a lot of
jockeying going on [at Stanford]
from an internal standpoint," he
said. "Everything depends on
Stanford providing us with a facil
ity that will meet our needs."
The current facility has re
mained the same size since 1960,
while Stanford's student body has
grown in size, creating greater de
mands on post office workers, ac
cording to Kwan.
The slow pace of negotiations
and Stanford's special position as
one of three universities nation
wide with a campus post office has
led several Stanford students to
call for alternatives.
ASSU President Bill Shen said
he believes leasing a space to an
independent mail service compa
ny — such as Mail Boxes Etc. or

Green Mail Inc. — but maintain
ing the post office boxes might im
prove service.
"The service as it is is less than
adequate," he said. "Numerous
alternatives seem attractive. I
think we would be doing students
a disservice if we didn't examine
them."
Changing the current arrange
ment, however, is a daunting task,
Shen said.
"There is not much impetus
from any level for improving this
since it is such a massive under
taking," he said. "People are
afraid to do it since it involves fed
eral, University and business bu
reaucracy."
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said he plans to discuss the subject
of a private mail service company
with the Tresidder Advisory
Board tomorrow. Wais added that
space has become so cramped at
the post office that he, as a resi
dent fellow in Junipero, has no
box of his own.

"We would be willing to consid
er another vendor since there is a
space open in Tresidder, but it is
dependent upon the demand from
the students and vendor inter
est," he said.
Lisa Hoeflich, the owner of
Green Mail Inc., expressed inter
est in providing service to Stan
ford students, although she said
she had not been contacted by any
University officials.
Hoeflich added that her compa
ny could provide several addition
al services to students such as
UPS shipping and fax machines.
The manager of the local
branch of another mail service
company said expanding to Stan
ford would not be practical or fea
sible.
"In terms of a total setup over
there, it would just not be practi
cal," said Steven Wagner, the man
ager of the Menlo Park branch of
Mail Boxes Etc. "Setting up anoth
er branch would cut directly into
our location's business."
