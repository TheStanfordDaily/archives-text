Stanford's Faculty Club re
opened yesterday under the new
management of a private firm.
The club was placed under the
management of TDS of Redwood
City after a prolonged period of fi
nancial difficulty. It had been
closed since Sept. 5.
At the opening, club board pres
ident and Law Prof. Barton
Thompson explained the decision
to switch to new management as a
measure to improve the club's food
service and event schedule.
"We had an adequate product
but nothing to draw in new mem
bers or restore the health of the
club," Thompson said.
Thompson cited a decline in
business in the Faculty Club's
lunch, dinner and catering ser
vices.

"The Faculty Club had begun to
have a rubber chicken catering fa
cility reputation," Thompson said.
The club looked at a variety of
management possibilities, includ
ing restaurants and the University
Housing and Dining Services, but
it chose TDS in the end because of
the company's experience in food
service, Thompson said.
"The quality of its management
and food service made it the best
option for us," Thompson said.
TDS operates as the club's
"management team," Thompson
said. "The board still dictates the
policy and manages the operation
of the club."
Despite the many positive out
comes of the TDS management,
the issue of union labor has re
mained a point of contention for
the United Stanford Workers.
