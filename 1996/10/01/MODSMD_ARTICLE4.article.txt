### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
Stanford's Faculty Club re
opened yesterday under the new
management of a private firm.
The club was placed under the
management of TDS of Redwood
City after a prolonged period of fi
nancial difficulty. It had been
closed since Sept. 5.
At the opening, club board pres
ident and Law Prof. Barton
Thompson explained the decision
to switch to new management as a
measure to improve the club's food
service and event schedule.
"We had an adequate product
but nothing to draw in new mem
bers or restore the health of the
club," Thompson said.
Thompson cited a decline in
business in the Faculty Club's
lunch, dinner and catering ser
vices.

"The Faculty Club had begun to
have a rubber chicken catering fa
cility reputation," Thompson said.
The club looked at a variety of
management possibilities, includ
ing restaurants and the University
Housing and Dining Services, but
it chose TDS in the end because of
the company's experience in food
service, Thompson said.
"The quality of its management
and food service made it the best
option for us," Thompson said.
TDS operates as the club's
"management team," Thompson
said. "The board still dictates the
policy and manages the operation
of the club."
Despite the many positive out
comes of the TDS management,
the issue of union labor has re
mained a point of contention for
the United Stanford Workers.
Many were concerned that the
switch jeopardized the jobs of
workers who were employed
through the former management,

Thompson said. However, he said,
the club tried to ensure the work
ers would retain their positions
under TDS.
"We took every reasonable ac
tion to protect employees in the
transition," Thompson said.
The club met with people from
the union and provided them with

details regarding the switch in
management. The faculty club also
asked for feedback from the union,
Thompson said.
Faculty Club Supervisor Mark
Hall said he approves of the TDS
management. After working for
the club for the past six years,
Hall was hired by TDS when the

management changed.
"I've worked here six years
and I love the new management,"
Hall said. "They're down-to
earth and approachable. They're
heading the club in a new direc
tion."
Although Hall is not a member
of the United Stanford Workers,

he said some of his co-workers are.
They were rehired by TDS when
the management changed, and
they are "satisfied with their jobs,"
Hall said.
"Everyone has a sense of pride
about their work now. Here every
one is on an equal plateau," Hall
said.

Regarding changes in prices and
membership dues, Thompson said
the club will "increase prices only if
it becomes necessary for the club's
financial health."
As for the food, last night's
menu included Thai shrimp cakes,
cumin-roasted potatoes and grilled
prawns.
