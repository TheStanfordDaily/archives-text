It appears that skin problems
can be honorable after all.
Dr. Alfred Lane, chair of the
Dermatology Department, re
ceived this year's Outstanding
Faculty Physician Award for Ex
cellence in Specialty Care from
Cowell Student Health Center
Lane, who was nominated by stu
dents and a student-run health
advisory board, said he was hon
ored to have been selected.

'Lane is an outstand
ing clinician who has
provided wonderful
service to students.'
— Ira Friedman

Known for his clinical skills and
caring attitude with students, Lane
is a professor of dermatology and
pediatrics at Stanford.
Lane "is an outstanding clini
cian who has provided wonderful
service to students and we wish to
recognize that and express our ap
preciation," Cowell Director Ira
Friedman said. "He has treated stu -
dents at Cowell for five years, and
he's being recognized for his out
standing technical quality, bedside
manner and caring patient rela
tionships."
Lane, who no longer works at
Cowell, said his work there focused
on acne and acne treatments for

Stanford students.
"Acne is a problem. I joke
with students that Stanford actual
ly causes acne," said Lane, referring
to the high level of stress that seems
ever-present on campus. Lane also
said he enjoyed his time spent at
Cowell working with students.
Cowell provides free health care
for insured students and has ap
proximately 70 people on staff. The
health center provides medical ser
vices to approximately 14,000 Stan
ford students, their families and
their domestic partners.
According to Lane, who has been
working at Stanford for the past six
years, 30 percent to 40 percent of
the dermatology cases at Cowell are
acne-related. He also advised that
acne doesn't come from eating
greasy foods and that the only way
to get acne from food is to rub it on
your skin. He went on to say that,
besides reducing stress, medica
tions are the only way to combat
acne.
Lane also said many students
appreciate his friendly and caring
style. Instead of dealing solely with
clinical problems, he asked patients
about other issues that might be af
fecting them. This counseling ap
proach allowed him to develop clos
er relationships with students in
stead of dealing with them only on a
doctor-patient level.
Last year's winner of the out
standing physician award was Dr.
Elaine Lambert, an assistant pro
fessor of immunology and rheuma
tology and the physician for the
women's volleyball team.
