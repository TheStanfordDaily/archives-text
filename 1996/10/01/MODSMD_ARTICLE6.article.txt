# East Palo Alto children find schoolwork to be as rewarding as sports
## Tennis and tutoring program takes off 
### Emily Richmond 
For more than 200 children in
East Palo Alto, the new school
year doesn't just mean hitting the
books: With the help of Stanford
student volunteers, they will hit
the tennis courts as well.
Since its inception in 1989, East
Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring has
been teaching children the funda
mentals of tennis in a program cre
ated by Jeff Arons, a Stanford
alumnus and former tennis Ail-
American. Academic assistance
was added to the program in 1992.
According to Zora Shaw, a 1994
graduate of Stanford and the assis
tant academic coordinator of the
program, tennis and tutoring are
natural partners.
"We use tennis as the motiva
tion, but the two disciplines (ath
letics and academics) consistently
reinforce each other on and o(T the
courts," said Shaw.
The children in the first
through eighth grades begin in the
tennis program, and if they show
consistent effort, their names are
added to a waiting list for one-to
one academic tutorials. The tutori
als meet twice weekly on the
grounds of Cesar Chavez Academy
in East Palo Alto, which operates
as part of the Ravenswood School
District.
The one-to-one ratio has been
extremely successful, although
the waiting list for the tutorial pro
gram is roughly one year due to a
shortage of student tutors.

Volunteer tutors are trained on
campus, and a year-long commit
ment is expected. According to
Shaw, many students have re
turned for several years of partici

as a tutor and described her in
volvement as "the most satisfying
thing I've done at Stanford. I've
been looking forward all summer
to getting back to it."
Serxner described helping a

child who began the year resisting
reading. By the spring, she said,
the girl was reading more and had
written her own book.
