# East Palo Alto children find schoolwork to be as rewarding as sports
## Tennis and tutoring program takes off 
### Emily Richmond 
For more than 200 children in
East Palo Alto, the new school
year doesn't just mean hitting the
books: With the help of Stanford
student volunteers, they will hit
the tennis courts as well.
Since its inception in 1989, East
Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring has
been teaching children the funda
mentals of tennis in a program cre
ated by Jeff Arons, a Stanford
alumnus and former tennis Ail-
American. Academic assistance
was added to the program in 1992.
According to Zora Shaw, a 1994
graduate of Stanford and the assis
tant academic coordinator of the
program, tennis and tutoring are
natural partners.
"We use tennis as the motiva
tion, but the two disciplines (ath
letics and academics) consistently
reinforce each other on and o(T the
courts," said Shaw.
The children in the first
through eighth grades begin in the
tennis program, and if they show
consistent effort, their names are
added to a waiting list for one-to
one academic tutorials. The tutori
als meet twice weekly on the
grounds of Cesar Chavez Academy
in East Palo Alto, which operates
as part of the Ravenswood School
District.
The one-to-one ratio has been
extremely successful, although
the waiting list for the tutorial pro
gram is roughly one year due to a
shortage of student tutors.

Volunteer tutors are trained on
campus, and a year-long commit
ment is expected. According to
Shaw, many students have re
turned for several years of partici

Serxner described helping a

reading. By the spring, she said,
the girl was reading more and had
written her own book.

lenge of tutoring. "These kids are
active learners. They want to be in
volved," she said. "We're not lec
turing them; we're asking ques
tions."
Dee Dee Terzian, a Stanford
alumna, joined the program as aca
demic coordinator in 1992.
Terzian noted that the support
of the Ravenswood School District
and Superintendent Charlotte
Knight, coupled with the work of
Stanford tutors, has been critical to
the program's success.
Terzian's most immediate con
cern is meeting the needs of the
students currently enrolled in tu
toring, as well as finding volunteers
to help the more than 100 students
now on the waiting list.
Once the students have shown a
consistent effort on the tennis
courts, they begin tutorials. In
order to compete at tournaments
or participate in field trips, the stu
dents must complete 80 percent of
their homework, which is charted
by the tutors, parents and class
room teachers.
According to Terzian, "When we

take the tutoring kids from the ten
nis clinics, we don't look at tennis
ability. We look at attitude."
Coach Rich Gould, head of the
men's tennis program at Stanford,
works with Stanford staff and vol
unteers at the clinics. The students
are divided into groups of 10, and
on any given day there are as many
as 80 children on the courts. Gould
said the success of the program is
phenomenal.
"I don't know who gets the most
satisfaction, the tennis coaches or
the academic tutors," Gould said.
"It's one thing to volunteer for
something on your resume, but this
goes far beyond community service."
The program's success is evi
dent on the courts. Forty-five chil
dren compete in local middle school
leagues. Five children are ranked
in the top 40 for their age groups in
Northern California, and two oth
ers received tennis scholarships to
the renowned Palmer Academy in
Florida.
Glenda De La Cruz, a second
grade teacher at the Cesar Chavez
Academy, has worked with the pro
gram since 1992. De La Cruz has
seen marked improvement in both
the academic work and self-esteem
of the students.
Jose Medina was in De La

Cruz's second-grade classroom
three years ago when he entered
the tennis and tutoring program,
and she has continued to chart his
progress.
"In my class, Jose acted out," De
La Cruz said. "He didn't turn in his
homework, and he wouldn't work
during school. Now, he's become
much more disciplined. ... He
seems to care more about himself."
The tutorial sessions also incor
porate parental participation as
room coordinators. Laura Hag
gins joined the program in 1992,
and her mother, Patricia
Townsend, is now a room coordi
nator.
Townsend is grateful to the tu
tors for helping Laura to improve
in school. Laura agreed that her
study habits have improved but
said the tennis practices are de
manding and the tutorials require
hard work.
There is evidence that the hard
work pays off, according to De La
Cruz. Several students in the pro
gram began the past academic year
below grade level in basic skills, but
De La Cruz noted that many fin
ished the year much closer to or at
the expected skill level.
According to Terzian, "These
are tangible results of the tutoring,

but there have been important in
tangible results, like the students'
attitude toward learning. The dif
ference this program makes in
their lives is incredible."
Claudia Hermosillo, 13, is one
example of the attitude instilled by
the program. Claudia participated
in the program from fifth through
eighth grades and now plays for her
high school tennis team and com
petes in weekend tournaments. In
addition, she tutors younger chil
dren at the Cesar Chavez Academy.
Claudia misses the structure of
the Tennis and Tutoring program,
and said she is trying to continue to
work hard in high school. It helps,
she said, to work with the younger
children.
Recognizing that the transition
from the program to high school is a
significant change, Terzian recent
ly incorporated two separate leader
ship tutorials for the boys and girls,
aimed at helping prepare the chil
dren for more independent academ
ic study and decision-making.
Claudia believes she can contin
ue the success she experienced with
East Palo Alto Tennis and Tutor
ing.
"I like playing tennis," she said.
"I like winning. I want to win at my
schoolwork, too."
