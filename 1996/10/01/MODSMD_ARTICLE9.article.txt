## NASA hands off shuttle Private firm will oversee day-to-day operations 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - In
the biggest change in the history of the
space shuttle program, NASA is turn
ing over day-to-day operations to pri
vate industry to save money.
"Today is the first day of a new
space program in America," NASA
Administrator Daniel Goldin said yes
terday in announcing the $7 billion,
six-year contract with United Space
Alliance, a joint venture of Rockwell
International Corp. and Lockheed
Martin Corp.
Officials promise the shift will be
gradual, with shuttle flight safety the
No. 1 priority.
In the short term, not even NASA
and its contract employees will see
much difference.
NASA still will give the final "go" for
launch and make the important deci
sions during a shuttle flight, as it has

for the past 15 years. It will retain ulti
mate responsibility for shuttle safety
and hire the astronauts. And it will still
own the four space shuttles.
But it will ease itself out of the rou
tine, day-to-day work, such as prepar
ing the shuttles for flight, training the
astronauts and operating Mission Con
trol. Those duties will belong to United
Space Alliance.
The contract, which was announced
yesterday but was actually signed late
last week, designates United Space
Alliance as the single prime contractor
for shuttle operations. It includes two
two-year extension options that could
bring the contract's total estimated
value to $12 billion over 10 years.
Because Rockwell and Lockheed
Martin already handled most of the
shuttle work, the transition, while his
toric, won't make much immediate dif

ference.
Some NASA employees question
whether USA can do the job as
promised, especially with construction
of an international space station just a
year off, and they fear reduced govern
ment oversight could lead to another
Challenger-type disaster. Some fear
that the changeover itself could prove a
distraction that could lead to potential
ly fatal mistakes.
Under the agreement, USA will be
penalized for failing to meet safety and
mission objectives. The better the com
pany does, the more it will earn, and the
more taxpayers will save.
"We are telling the contractor we're
going to give you 35 cents of every dol
lar that you save us," Goldin said. "May
they get very rich because the taxpayer
will get very rich, because we get back
65 cents."
