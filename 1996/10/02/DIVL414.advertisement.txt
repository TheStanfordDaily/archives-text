Stanford in a new video that we plan to show to prospective undergraduates and their parents this spring.
Lee Mendelson, an alumnus known for producing such television specials as "A Charlie Brown Christmas"
and "A Man Named Mays," will select and film a few students as they describe their experiences and, when
possible, add footage from those experiences If you'd like an opportunity to be in the video, please send us
an e-mail describing your experience and tell us why it is meaningful to you We're especially interested in
the questions below, but if you've had a particularly wonderful experience at Stanford not covered by these
topics, please feel free to share that Responses should be e-mailed to cmurphy(a)Jeland by midnight
October 15, and should include your full name, e-mail address, and phone number. Those who are
selected will be contacted by the end of October

you \e taken ?
