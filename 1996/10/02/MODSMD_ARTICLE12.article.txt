## CIA studies chemical weapons exposure More troops involved in Gulf War disease 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A CIA study
looking into how many U.S. troops may
have been exposed to a chemical weapons
explosion could reveal "a very large num
ber" were involved â€” even far greater
than 15,000 troops, a Pentagon
spokesman said yesterday.
Pentagon officials are contacting about
5,000 troops whom they believe may have
been exposed during the first of two explo
sions at an Iraqi chemical weapons dump
in southern Iraq in March 1991.
But Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said a new study that looks at wind
conditions, the potential number of chem
ical rockets destroyed and other matters
involving a second explosion on March 10,
1991, may show far greater numbers of
troops could have been exposed.
"My expectation is that, based on the
amount of chemical weapons in the pit and
what we've been told, there could be a very
large number of troops included in a possi
ble cloud area," Bacon said.
Pressed to define the number, he
answered: "I just don't think we know at

this stage, but we have to think in terms of
big numbers, bigger than 15,000 certain
ly."
Veterans have long suspected that con
tact with Iraqi chemical or biological
agents contributed to the chronic illnesses
afflicting thousands of Gulf War soldiers.
Until June 21, the Pentagon insisted
there was no evidence the Iraqis used
chemical or biological weapons during the
war. Then, the officials acknowledged that
U.S. troops may have exposed themselves
by blowing up Iraqi chemical rockets at a
site they believed contained only conven
tional weapons.
The CIA computer model is supposed
to help ascertain how many troops may
have been exposed to sarin nerve gas dur
ing the destruction in a bunker and an
open pit at the weapons depot site called
Khamiseyah.
At first, Pentagon officials said only 300
to 400 engineers were nearby. But later,
they began warning about 5,000 veterans
who may have been near the depot that
they could have been exposed to nerve gas.
