# Peace talks start smoothly

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Amid ten
sions and suspicion inflamed by
Mideast violence, Israeli Prime Minis
ter Benjamin Netanyahu and Pales
tinian leader Yasser Arafat shook
hands at a White House summit yes
terday and held lengthy face-to-face
talks.
After three hours, the discussions
recessed on a cordial note, the White
House said. The crisis-shrouded meet
ing helped dispel a mood of mistrust but
did not resolve major differences, offi
cials said. The talks are to resume
today.
"We've come a long way in the last
three years," President Clinton said as
he sought to build on a 1993 peace
accord between the two sides. "No one
wants to turn back."
Netanyahu said they had come
together "to try to put the peace process
back on track" after last week's vio
lence left 76 people dead. He said he was
absolutely committed to the 1993
agreements, which include the
promised redeployment of Israeli
troops away from Arabs in the West
Bank town of Hebron.
However, Natan Sharansky, an
Israeli cabinet officer, said Israel had
rejected as impossible an American
request for a specific date for the troop
pullback. "We say to commit oneself to
a date is to create a built-in possibility

of the talks breaking down," Sharanksy
said.
Further, Sharansky said Israel
would not reverse Netanyahu's opening
last week of a second entrance to a tun
nel that winds around the Temple
Mount in Jerusalem, which has shrines
sacred to Muslims and Jews. The open
ing triggered the worst gun battles
between Palestinians and Israelis since
the 1967 Mideast war.
The White House said the
Netanyahu-Arafat talks went "a long
way towards re-establishing that notion
of trust that must exist between the
parties."
Still, presidential spokesman Mike
McCurry said, "We are at a very, very
difficult moment. We are still at that
moment."
It was only the second meeting
between Netanyahu and Arafat. They
talked in the presidential library under
a portrait of George Washington. For
45 minutes they were alone. Then they
were joined by Abu Mazen on the Pales
tinian side and Yitzhak Molcho, an
Israeli attorney.
They concluded their discussions
with a handshake as they escorted each
other to their motorcades. Netanyahu
went to a meeting with Secretary of
State Warren Christopher. The State
Department was trying to arrange a
meeting with Arafat, as well.

Despite the upbeat assessment about
re-establishing trust, there was no indi
cation of a breakthrough on divisive
issues, such as a promised but delayed
Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron
or how to treat holy sites in Jerusalem.
"They have a number of very deep dif
ferences," McCurry said.
Clinton said the meetings show "a
common commitment to end the vio
lence and to get the peace process back
on track. We are committed to that."
Hasan Abed Rahman, head of the
PLO office in Washington and one of
Arafat's closest advisors, said he was
hopeful about the summit's outcome.
"The general environment is not cold,"
he said.
Assembling at the outset in the
Roosevelt Room, Netanyahu and
Arafat — along with Jordan's King
Hussein — greeted each other with
handshakes and spoke amiably,
McCurry said.
The atmosphere was described as
very relaxed — despite the bitterness
growing out of bloody battles between
Israeli troops and Palestinian police.
The leaders met individually with
Clinton in the Oval Office and then all
together for 45 minutes. Then Clinton
invited them to lunch in the WTiite
House library where they dined on pan
roasted chicken with vegetables and
couscous.
