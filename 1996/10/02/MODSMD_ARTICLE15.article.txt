## Editorial Dial-in access denied 
### 
Res Comp's new policy
changes force students
to pay more for Ethernet

Returning students
who set up their comput
ers and try to connect to
the Internet this quarter will
soon discover two substantial
changes in residential computing
policy. First, the Ethernet regis
tration fee has gone up $15 from
last year; second, students who
live on campus in Ethernet-capa
ble residences are no longer
allowed to connect to the Inter
net via modems. And while the
fee increase was necessary, for
bidding resident students to dial
in to their e-mail accounts is an
unfair policy imposed on stu
dents with little forewarning.
In effect, dorm residents are
now required to purchase a costly
Ethernet connection if they want
to hook on to Stanford's network
and the World Wide Web, at least
in those residences which have
Ethernet capability. Just institut
ed this year, this policy denies
students the choice to connect via
modems, a slower but free
method. The removal of dial-in
access, much like the decision to
scramble over-the-air channels in
rooms equipped for cable televi
sion, forces students to shell out
money or settle for unnecessary
inconveniences.
And the amount of money
required to secure Ethernet con
nections just got larger. The Eth
ernet registration fee has sky
rocketed in recent years, from
$10 in 1994-95 to $30 last year to
the current amount. Fortunately,
the price of Ethernet cards (the
hardware necessary to connect
via Ethernet) dropped dramati
cally after the beginning of the
1993-94 school year. Because of
this drop in the price of Ethernet
cards, Residential Computing
chose to stop leasing them for
$50 per year, no longer a practical
program when the purchase price
was only slightly higher.

Residential Computing, denied
extra funding from the Provost's
Office, boosted the registration
price to raise funds for improved
and expanded Internet services.
Ten dollars in 1994 provided a
convenient way to check news
groups and e-mail, but the $45
investment this year opens the
door to vastly improved World
Wide Web access. The Web was
primarily a convenience or
curiosity two year ago; today, an
increasing number of students
depends on Internet resources
for classes and other academic
purposes.
Furthermore, vast upgrades in
operating systems were made
over the summer, providing
faster and more efficient service.
Future upgrades will add Ether
net capability to nearly all of
campus, but those upgrades will
cost additional money, some of
which will come from the rate
increase.
But none of the justifications
for the rate increase applies to
the new policy on dial-in access.
Residential Computing says that
heavy usage of the 498-1440 dial
in pool necessitated the limita
tions of dial-in access from most
of campus, but the elimination of
lower-speed access last year
opened up phone numbers that
could have been used to maintain
the high levels of dial-in activity.
With the various other upgrades
in computing systems, changes
should have been made to accom
modate the additional users.
In any event, students who
purchased modems over the sum
mer expecting to dial in to the
University network are left in the
worst possible position. Having
already paid for hardware that
they are unable to use, they now
face the choice of going without
in-room connections or shelling
out another $45 just to register
for Ethernet access.
In the future, Residential Com
puting should make sure that stu
dents know of significant policy
changes and fee increases well in
advance of their implementation.
