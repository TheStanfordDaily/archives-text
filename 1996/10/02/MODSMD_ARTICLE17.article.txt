# Campus Viewpoint Nkomo Morris with Sharon Holland
## Popular culture comes to Stanford 
### 
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT. You've
just returned to the dorm after
watching "The Piano" for the sec
ond time. You love that movie — you
love the music; you adore Holly Hunter,
and you think Jane Campion is a god
dess.
You look at a flier on the bulletin
board. Professor X from equally compet
itive elite school is going to talk about
the film on Thursday afternoon. Picture
yourself anxiously awaiting the moment
when you can engage in rapturous dis
cussion with someone from a parallel
institution about a film you adore.
Imagine your horror when Professor
X, slowly and with precision, begins to
tear your love object apart. She feels
that the camera angles, the music, the
costumes and, above all else, the treat
ment of the Maori people of New
Zealand constitute the worst cinematic
representation of imperialism she's ever

witnessed on film. To top it all off, Pro
fessor X has seen things you've never
noticed in the film — and she's convinc
ing. You leave the lecture hall depressed
but enlightened; peeved, but willing to
weigh the evidence.
You've just been subjected to the pro
cess that the study of popular culture
brings to everyone — a sense that things
aren't always as benign as they appear.
You're forever changed.
Critiquing popular culture is one of
the most valuable tools you can have in
the age of information — in a world so
unwilling to find solutions to its myriad
of problems, knowing how to examine
what's around you allows you to see the
possibility for proactive change.
At Yost, Stanford's popular culture
theme house, everything from fashion
trends to the true meaning behind
"Pulp Fiction" (and there is one) is suit
able for criticism and study.
Quite the opposite of haute couture,
popular culture is a subject that is
approachable and pertinent in the lives
of everyone. Important not only because
it is enlightening to learn exactly how
the various forms of media and
approachable art affect how we see the
world, but because it is enlightening to
learn how the rest of the world uses
those very same tools to view us and
how we use them to view ourselves.
The question that Yost wants to
answer is less of a what than a why. Why
the sudden surge in alien-focused and
conspiracy theory television shows? Why

is Alanis Morissette so popular for a style
of music that raging grrl bands brought
to the forefront long ago? Why did the
O.J. case turn into the "Trial of the Cen
tury"? Why is there a rape scene in "Mis
sion: Impossible," cleverly disguised?
Already, the new residents seem to be
stoked about the year. The dorm's first
gathering, an ice cream social, went very
well and a significant percentage of the
participants were from other dorms.
Hopefully, they have started a trend;
perhaps when they come back they will
bring money to support their ice cream
habit. New voices and new faces will be
welcome, even sought after, to join Yos
tites at the theme-based activities, and
plans are being made to create joint pro
gramming with other theme houses.
Possible future programming topics
include drug culture, tattoos and body
piercing, the image of women in the
media and the occult and "new age" cul
ture, plus short story readings.
Yost's funky home page (http://www
rescomp.stanford.edu/dorms/govco/yost)
is the most up-to-date information
source for upcoming events.
So, face your fear of having your
favorite pastime critiqued, remembering
"that which doesn't kill us makes us
strong." Check out Yost's quarter-long
programming calendar and elevate your
mind.
