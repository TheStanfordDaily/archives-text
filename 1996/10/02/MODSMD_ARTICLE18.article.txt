# Prof. Beinin and students offer propaganda, not facts
## 
### 
WE ARE WRITING in response
to Beinin, Stein and Oben
zinger's letter to The Daily on
Monday blaming Israel for the recent
outbreak of violence in Jerusalem, the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. As has been
the case with letters authored by Beinin
and his students in the past, we find this
letter to contain inaccuracies which we
wish to correct.
The authors claim that in restoring
the ancient tunnel in East Jerusalem,
Israel has violated the article in the Oslo
Accords which states that the status of
East Jerusalem will be determined in the
final settlement negotiations.
In actuality, the agreement does not
refer to archaeological restorations in
Jerusalem. Not coincidentally, Beinin
avoids echoing Yasser Arafat's accusa
tion that the tunnel desecrates the
Islamic holy site of the Temple Mount. It
was this blatantly false accusation that
sparked the Palestinian riots which initi
ated the latest outbreak of violence.
Beinin contends that Israel has prac

ticed "a long-standing . . . policy of
asserting full control over Jerusalem."
As Beinin surely knows but neglects to
mention, the Palestinian Authority has
consistently attempted to claim a pres
ence in Jerusalem by running illegal gov
ernment offices in the Orient House in
the eastern part of the city. You don't
have to be a professor of Middle East his
tory to understand that both sides are
attempting to strengthen their position
in the city in anticipation of the final set
tlement negotiations, but Beinin would
have us believe that this is solely an
Israeli transgression.
In their letter, Beinin and his stu
dents claim that "Israeli forces repeated
ly opened fire on unarmed civilian
demonstrators" and that "Palestinian
police returned Israeli fire." The
accounts of CNN and other news agen
cies as to the course of events is quite dif
ferent. The Palestinian demonstrators
attacked undermanned Israeli posts
with stones, Molotov cocktails and burn
ing tires. In Joseph's Tomb, a Jewish

holy site in Palestinian-controlled East
ern Nablus, a handful of Israeli soldiers
posted to protect Jewish worshippers
were attacked by a mob of thousands.
The soldiers attempted to disperse the
demonstration using tear gas and rubber
bullets.
It was at this point that Palestinian
policeman and assault-rifle bearing civil
ians opened fire on Israeli soldiers. The
Israelis reciprocated in self-defense,
leading to heavy bloodshed on both sides.
Arafat later apologized for the use of
deadly weapons by members of his police
force. If, as Beinin insinuates, the police
men had been using force in self-defense,
would Arafat have apologized?
Finally, Beinin blames the "repeated
military closures" instituted by the
Rabin / Peres government for creating
an inflammatory atmosphere among
Palestinians. Beinin fails to explain that
the closures were initiated as a result of
Palestinian terrorist attacks in the heart
of Israel which left hundreds of Israeli
civilians dead and wounded in the last

year.
We do not believe that the unbalanced
and inaccurate nature of Beinin's letter
is coincidental. It is the latest install
ment in a series of letters published by
Beinin or his students (see Feb. 24 and
March 2, 1995, issues of The Daily)
which are based on false statements and
misrepresented information. Unfortu
nately, Beinin used similar strategies
when teaching his course on Middle East
history. It is very disappointing that the
arguments used by a tenured Stanford
professor when conveying such a com
plex subject to the Stanford community
eerily echo the one-sided demagoguery
and propagandistic formulas used by
extremists from both sides. It is exactly
this type of blindness to the opposite
side's legitimate concerns that has
caused the tragic bloodshed of recent
days.
