# Housing and dining director responds to upperclass students
## 
### 
The Daily editorial about the differ
ence between the way Stanford wel
comes freshmen and the way upperclass
students are greeted upon their return
(Sept. 24) was a good reminder for us

all, and I'd like to respond. I believe we
can all do a better job of coordinating
the efforts of the many offices involved
in moving students back into residences
in the fall and ensuring that move-in
schedules meet returning students'
needs.
Access to storage rooms (including
bicycle storage) and to meal service are
within the purview of Housing and Din
ing Services, and our managers have
already agreed that in the future, we will

ensure access to those services on open
ing day in the fall. In the past, relatively
few students availed themselves of access
to storage and dining services on opening
day, but we realize that both are impor
tant and must be offered, regardless of
prior usage levels.
Issuance of keys and any arrange
ments for welcoming activities are func
tions of other offices, and I will be talking
with colleagues in those departments
about how best to coordinate our efforts

for returning students' benefit. We all
value upperclass students, but it is also
easy to understand that after the rather
extraordinary welcome to residences that
freshmen get each year, returning stu
dents can feel like we may have forgotten
them. We have not, and The Daily edito
rial has given us some very concrete
reminders about how to better demon
strate that fact in the future.

Director, Housing and Dining Services
