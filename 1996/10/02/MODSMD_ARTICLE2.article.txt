# University breaks fund-raising record

### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
Stanford University broke its
fund-raising and gift income record
in the 1995-96 fiscal year, crossing
the $300 million threshold for the
first time.
The fiscal year's total gift re
ceipts of $312.9 million represent a
30 percent increase from the previ
ous year's record of $241 million.
Gift records were set in several
areas: 85,626 total gifts were donat
ed, a 7 percent increase; 77,097 indi
viduals gave, also a 7 percent in
crease; and 332 donor gifts of
$100,000 or more totaling $258 mil
lion were brought in.

Stanford's fiscal year runs from
Sept. 1 through Aug. 31.
Included in this year's total is
David Hewlett and William
Packard's $62.5 million gift for the
construction of the Science and En
gineering Quad.
Increasing annual alumni giving
has been a priority for the adminis
tration since University President
Gerhard Casper's arrival four years
ago. Participation of undergraduate
alumni in giving reached 34 percent
this year, resulting in a total growth
rate of 42 percent since 1992.
Still, Stephen Peeps, associate
vice president for development, is
not completely satisfied. Peeps
stressed the need to solicit alumni
giving since Stanford has tradition
ally fallen behind other schools in
that area.
The Stanford Fund, created to
help finance undergraduate educa
tion and student life, encourages
gifts of any amount from alumni.
This year, the Stanford Fund raised
$5.2 million, exceeding its goal for
the year by 24 percent.
According to Stanford Fund Di
rector Chris Ponce, two programs
have contributed to the Stanford
Fund's record-breaking numbers.
More than half of the parents of
Class of 1999 students responded to
the first-ever challenge to freshman
parents to make gifts to the Stan

ford Fund. In addition, the im
proved programming for the Re
union Homecoming Weekend has
also drawn a greater number of
givers, he said.
The President's Fund, which
provides money for a wide range of
projects, also surpassed its goal by
drawing in $2.1 million. That fund
is designated for annual donations
of $10,000 or more from private
supporters. The money, at the pres
ident's discretion, is allocated to
various programs, from financing
the Presidential Scholars program
to purchasing teaching equipment
for the Science and Engineering
Quad, which currently is under
construction.
The Graduate School of Busi
ness and the Law School also beat
their fund-raisingrecords in this fis
cal year. While the Business School
surpassed $20 million for the first
time, the Law School reached $18

million, a 200 percent increase from
the previous year.
Although Peeps is pleased with
this year's overall progress, he cited
several areas to improve.
The Restoration Fund, estab
lished to repair the earthquake
damages of 1989, is still $6.6 million
short. While the Stanford Introduc
tory Studies programs — including
Casper's new freshmen-seminar
initative, Sophomore College and
sophomore seminars and dialogues
— has received general expendable
funding, the programs need nearly
$75 million of endowed funds to se
cure a permanent foundation.
In addition, the University needs
to raise $200 million for a new fel
lowship endowment to give full sup
port to 100 doctoral students every
year for three consecutive years as a
part of the Stanford Graduate Fel
lowship Program announced by
Casper last spring.
