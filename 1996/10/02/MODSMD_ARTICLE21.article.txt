# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## An unseen eclipse: searching for meaning in the moon 
### 
Apparently, this is a crucial year.
Maybe not for you, but appar
ently it is for me (and those like
me). My adviser tells me so. My other
senior friends complain that this is so.
My parents hint that this may be so.
The uncertainty of my post-graduate
place in this world (and of those like me)
proves that this is so.
It is in crucial years like this one that
everything begins to take on potential
meaning. Crucial meaning. And there
fore, something important might just
happen at any minute. If one is not
ever-vigilant, one might miss it.
Apparently, there was a lunar eclipse
last week, and apparently, I missed it.
Yeah, so what. Isolated Stanford stu
dent that I am, I can't feel it was entire
ly my fault. No one sent me e-mail
about it, so what the hell was I supposed
to do?
But nevertheless, I feel much as
Charlie Brown must have the morning
after the Great Pumpkin's ascension,

relying on the Linuses (Lini?) of the
world to tell me what I missed.
And those who did happen to witness
it were all ababble at the wonder of the
experience. Some were so entranced
that they forgot everything else they
were doing. For example, the eclipse
peaked at about 10:30 EST, which hap
pened to be right when I was supposed
to meet a friend â€” who never showed.
When I saw her the next day, it was I
who felt the fool. I should have known
better than to schedule our meeting on
Eastern Standard Time.
But more importantly, I am left won
dering: What did I miss? What signifi
cant sacrament was signified, only I
missed the signal? What prophecy was I
not privy to? In a crucial year like this,
what meaning was lost?
You see, throughout time, a shrouded
moon has meant something. From one
historical period to the next, the lunar
eclipse has conjured fear and consterna
tion in those who would witness it.

In the time of the Bible, a lunar
eclipse was believed to have heralded
the death of King Herod. In ancient
Japan, men would lie on the ground and
howl like dogs to ward off its evil after
effects. In 1974, 16 people were killed
in Cambodia when soldiers fired their
rifles to frighten off what they thought
to be a monkey eating the moon.
Ah, history can be hauntingly fasci
nating, yes? I mean, these events are all
true. They are facts. They really hap
pened. How do I know? I looked them
up on Lexis-Nexis.
This got me to thinking. What does this
celestial sensation mean? Maybe some
thing special is coming, and here I don't
just mean Chelsea Clinton. What does it
mean for me? An ominous symbol that my
life is changing? How would I know?
At least my research revealed that I
am not alone. Even today, the shadowed
moon takes on religious and spiritual
significance around the globe as people
search for explanations. To the Navajo

Nation, an eclipse signifies death, and
members observe the time by staying
indoors and meditating. The Jewish cal
endar is based on the lunar cycle and
makes special note of the phenomenon.
Last week, Kuwait's Ministry of
Islamic Affairs urged Muslim citizens to
follow Mohammed's tradition of pray
ing to mark a total eclipse of the moon.
Meanwhile, the Psychic Friends Net
work was imploring its callers to remain
calm: "It's nothing to be afraid of, be
around your animals, release negatives
in your life, get enough sleep."
Others have found their eternal
answers.
Last April, Jerry Garcia was official
ly laid to rest in a ceremony following a
lunar eclipse. Garcia's widow sprinkled
his ashes in India's Ganges River while
friends prayed that the darkened moon
would enable the Grateful Dead leader
to "travel to the stars."
Wow. It's a beautiful thing, man.
OK, maybe it all does seem like a lot

of hype over what is really just the
world's biggest shadow (literally). Rut
we here at Stanford, with our penchants
for lunar awareness (Full Moon on the
Quad), stargazing (various child actors,
etc.) and sun worship (spring quarter),
should perhaps not be so quick to judge.
Maybe it goes like this: The eclipse last
week was just a natural occurrence but
one that got many people to pay attention.
And maybe the bottom line is that
it's a good thing to be more aware than
not of the wonderful mystery that per
meates the world. To recognize those
unknowns about ourselves and others
that we encounter always. Every
minute of every day of every month of
every year. And if this year is truly more
crucial than others, then let it be.

Next fully visible total lunar eclipse:
Jan. 21, 2000. For exact time, check
