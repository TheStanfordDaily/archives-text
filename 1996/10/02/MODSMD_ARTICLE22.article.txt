# Med School researchers get grant
## Money supports cancer studies

Five scientists from the Stanford School of Medi
cine have received a $5. r Â» million grant to conduct
cancer research.
The project, funded by the National Cancer Insti
tute, a division of the National Institutes of Health, con
sists of five related studies of certain genes in animals
that spur normal growth under most circumstances but
cause cancer when mutated. Research began July 1.
The project is led by Assoc. Pathology Prof. Joe
Lipsick, who will also conduct one of the studies. The
other four will be led by Assoc. Pediatrics and Genet
ics Prof. Greg Barsh, Assoc. Pathology Prof. Michael
Cleary, Asst. Developmental Biology Prof. David
Kingsley and Developmental Biology and Genetics
Prof. Matthew Scott.
In the course of the five-year project, the re
searchers hope to "reach a better understanding of
how the abnormal expression of normal genes can
lead to cancer," said Barsh.
According to Lipsick, the research will focus on
specific genes that have previously been identified as

capable of causing cancer when mutated and on how
these genes operate with other genes to cause can
cerous or normal growth.
The scientists hope a better understanding of this
research in animals will eventually have an impact on
human cancer treatment, as earlier research has re
vealed a "remarkable similarity" between gene ac
tions in different organisms, said Lipsick.
"By studying simple organisms, you can under
stand how the same gene works in a complex organ
ism," said Lipsick. "When mutated, these genes
cause cancer. When normal, they don't."
Lipsick hopes more research into the way these
genes operate may someday lead to a human cancer
drug that "hits the bad but not the good."
Lipsick added, "A better understanding of these
genes is likely to have a profound impact on the diag
nosis and treatment of human cancer."
Each of the project's five studies will follow the
normal and cancerous development caused by a cer
tain gene. One study, for example, is centered on the
gene protein kreisler, which causes normal growth in
mice but is identified as a cause of cancer in chickens.
