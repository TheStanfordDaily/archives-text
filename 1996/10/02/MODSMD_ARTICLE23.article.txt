## Feeling a little bit under the weather? What you should know about flu shots 
### Mignon Fogarty Contributing writer 
The flu season is rapidly
approaching. One of the best ways
to avoid the awful high fever, diy
cough and sore throat that define
influenza is to get a vaccination
against the virus that causes it.
While flu season reaches its
peak around December, the
immune system needs time to
organize its reaction after the vac
cination. Therefore, the best time
to get a shot is in October or
November.
Vaccines work by introducing
the immune system to a bacterid
or viral invader at the molecular
level. When an invader, or antigen,
first appears, the immune system
needs time to mobilize attack cells
specific to that antigen.
Flu immunization differs from
most vaccines in that a new shot is
needed every year. The flu virus
continually changes its coat, the
surface hemagglutinin and neu
raminidase proteins, making last
year's vaccine against it useless.
Workers at the Centers for Dis
ease Control (CDC) and the World
Health Organization (WHO) fight
to keep ahead of the virus by mak
ing a new batch of vaccine to pre
vent disease from the new viral
form each year
"The selection is based on a
worldwide influenza surveillance
system," said Ann Arvin, a profes
sor of pediatrics at the Stanford
School of Medicine. "New influen
za strains usually appear first in
Asia and move during the next sea
son to the Western hemisphere.
"The CDC collects virus
strains from China and else
where, analyzes them for changes
that would increase virulence and
designs a vaccine that will induce
immunity to the strains most
likely to be present in the com
munity during the upcoming sea
son," she said.
Flu shots are usually only rec
ommended for people who are like
ly to suffer severe consequences
from the flu, for example the elder
ly and those with chronic diseases
such as asthma, diabetes or AIDS.
However, shots are available to
everyone.
"Flu shots are available to any
one who wishes to reduce their risk
of getting the flu," said John Dor
man, a physician at Coweil Student
Health Center. "Some have sug
gested that those living in close
quarters might be at greater risk."
The vaccine is made of inacti
vated virus particles, Arvin said.
This means there is no risk of
developing the flu from getting a
vaccination. Some people do expe
rience a sore arm following the
shot.
People with allergies to eggs,
however, should avoid vaccination.
The flu virus grows much better in

eggs than in standard viral culture
conditions, so researchers use this
medium to produce the millions of
doses of vaccine needed each year.
Flu shots are at least 70 percent
effective in preventing the flu in
young healthy people, Dorman
said. However, he added, "Keep in
mind that the vaccine does not pre-

vent colds and such but only
influenza, a very specific viral ill
ness."
While Cowell typically gives
more than 1,000 flu shots each

year, "We usually only see a few
cases each year of clear influenza,"
he said.
Flu shots are available at Cow
ell Wednesdays, beginning today,
from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. The shots are
free for faculty and staff, but stu
dents are charged $18.
Longs Drug Store on University
Avenue will provide flu shots for
$10 from 8 a.m. to noon Oct. 11.
Shots also will be available for $10
at Walgreen Drug Store on Uni
versity Avenue from 9 a.m. to 1
p.m. Oct. 23 and 28.
Flu prevention
• Wash your hands frequently.
Your mom probably already told
you this a million times, but it's
worth repeating.
• Avoid stress. Hormones like
corticosteroids released when
you're coming down from stress
can suppress your immune sys
tem.
• Exercising regularly will actu
ally reduce your incidence of colds
and the flu. Overexertion, howev
er, can stress your system.
• Getting a flu shot will increase
your odds of fighting off infection.
A 70 percent chance of success is
better than you'll get in Reno.

Getting better
• You really do need about eight
glasses of water a day to keep your
immune system happy. Dehydra-

tion symptoms feel similar to the
flu, so drinking enough water will
make you feel significantly better
while you are recovering.
• Changing your toothbrush
every day while you're sick can
actually reduce the time it takes
you to get better. Think of all those
virus particles on your toothbrush
recirculating through your mouth.
• Get some sleep. You're not so
busv you can't rest.
