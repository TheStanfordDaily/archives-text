Q m How come fan blades are
• so dusty?
A»lf you take a really close
• look at your electric fan,
you'll probably see a thin layer of
dust on the blades. Of all the
things you would expect to stay
clean, your fan blades probably
top the list. Your fan is probably
the only thing in your room that
ever moves, right? Sure, dust can
collect on your desk, your
shelves, your books and your
roommate but not your fan!
If you look very closely at the
dust that's on your fan blades,
you might notice that it is finer
than your everyday, run-of-the
mill dust. That's right, your fan
is elitist — it attracts only the
finest dust.
You've probably figured out
pretty much how the fan works.
The blades spin around and push
the air forward to give you any
thing from a nice breeze to gale
force winds. With all that air
moving through the fan. you'd
think that not only would the

dust have no chance of getting
anywhere close to the blades but
it would get immediately blown
off by all that air, like cows in a
tornado.
That's not how it works,
though. As it turns out, the air
closest to the surface of the fan
does not move with reference to
the fan. What that means is that
if you were a little tiny piece of
dust sitting on the surface of the
fan, you would not feel any air
moving around you. As you move
away from the surface of the
blade, though, the air speed
picks up. This means big, fat
pieces of dust which stick up too
far from the surface of the fan
will get blown away by the mov
ing air. This also explains why
when your car gets all dusty, you
can't just drive really fast to get
rid of it, though God knows I've
tried.
There is a very small layer of
air close to the fan blades which
moves with the fan blades. This
occurs because the surface of the
fan pulls the air closest to it
along with it. As you move far
ther away from the fan, the
effect becomes less and less, and

the motion of the air comes clos
er to what you would expect.
The amount the effect dimin
ishes as you move away from the
surface is determined by the
internal resistance of the fluid,
also known as its viscosity. The
less viscous the fluid (or gas) is,
the thinner the layer of non
moving air close to the surface
will be. For more viscous fluids,
the layer will be thicker and the
surface will have more of an
effect on the speed of the fluid
passing over it.
Air has very little internal
resistance, so the non-moving
layer is very thin. Essentially,
only dust and very, veiy small
cows are small enough to stay
inside this layer. Water has
more internal resistance than
air, so not only is the layer thick
er, but the surface over which
the water is moving has more of
an effect on the flow. This is why
waves start to break before they
reach the shore. As the depth of
the water decreases, the sea
floor has more and more an
effect on the waves on the sur
face of the water. Once the
water is shallow enough, the sea

floor totally screws up the
motion of the waves on the sur
face and causes them to break.
This is also the reason why
you don't rip your nose hairs out
when you snee2e.
No — I'm just kidding, but
it's a scary thought, isn't it?
