# Program can link various databases
## New kind of network may be created 
### Joe Westersund Contributing writer 
A revolutionary new network
ing program designed by a Stan
ford professor will allow informa
tion from various databases to be
combined automatically to answer
questions from the user.
The program, called Infomas
ter, makes possible a linked system
of databases instead of individual
pages such as those currently
found on the World Wide Web.
While Infomaster can be accessed
through the Web, the program
may turn out to be the basis for a
new kind of network called the
World Information Network.
While the Web "is a document
managment system, Infomaster is
an information management sys
tem," said Michael Genesereth, a
computer science professor and
Infomaster creator. The Web only
allows access to existing pages,
which contain relatively unstruc
tured information in the form of
text, audio and video. Infomaster is
designed to work on structured
data sources, which can be
searched and analyzed in more
complicated ways.
For example, a car buyer could
have the computer assemble a list
of two-door sedans from different
makers, or a surgeon could
retrieve a patient's health records
from various departments around
a hospital and even from other
doctors.
By bridging the gap between the
different structures of the databas
es, Infomaster can put information
from different sources together to
create a new page or chart.
That means an Infomaster-user
could retrieve data without having
to know where it's stored, even if
the data is spread around several
locations. Until now, there has
been no way to do that, Genesereth
said.
The Infomaster project began in
1992 when a group called Com
merce Net gave funding to create
an online catalog capable of com
paring products from different
companies. After three years of
development, Infomaster's first
test in September 1995 combined
the online classified ads of three
area newspapers to create a com
puterized housing index that is
updated each day as the ads
change, Genesereth said.
Because Infomaster was devel
oped at Stanford, many of the early
applications may benefit students
and staff here, he said.
Tests have included an online
conference room reservation sys
tem for the Gates Computer Sci
ence Building, a more sophisticat
ed version of the WTiois campus
directory and a few prototypes of
the online catalog concept. All of
these except the catalogs are avail
able in their rough form via the
Infomaster home page (http: info
master. stanford.edu).
The latest test of the Infomaster
system is designed to give students
more information for choosing
classes.
Students will be able to search
for classes and professors with var
ious characteristics, Genesereth
said. For example, a geological and
environmental sciences major
could look for a class taught by a
professor who is interested in plate
tectonics and who has also been
published in Geology Today.
A prototype should be available
in three to six months, said project
manager Dennis Rayer, who works
in the Office of Information Tech
nology Systems and Services.
This class-finding application is
part of a bigger project started this
September called the Stanford
Information Network, a joint
effort of the Computer Science
Department and other University
organizations, including the
libraries and ITSS.
The Stanford Information Net
work would link together adminis
trative databases on people, cours
es, grades, events, as well as aca
demic data from research like the
Human Genome Project or the lat
est calculations from the Eco
nomics Department.
The Infomaster program itself

is designed to be applicable in a
wide variety of situations. Gene
sereth compared the current tests
of the system to the laundry that
a washing-machine salesman
might use to demonstrate the
machine — whether it's socks,
jeans or Krusty the Klown boxers
you're washing, he said, the real
point is to show what the
machine can do.
Although Infomaster initially
focused on commercial applica
tions. Genesereth said he sees it as
a very general tool "to help people
who need information get the
information they need."
Genesereth said Infomaster
could help make the economy run
more efficiently because a freer
flow of information about new and
innovative products could grease
the wheels of competition. New
products would no longer stay
unknown as comparative informa
tion on all kinds of goods becomes
easily available.
For now, growth of the network
of information united by Infomas
ter is relatively slow. This is large
ly due to the difficulty in making
data from different sources com
patible.
Individual databases may use
different names for the same infor
mation, Genesereth said — one
might list an "office number"
while another gives the same infor
mation under "location." And
there's no standardized format for
entering information like phone
numbers — some lists may give the
usual seven-digit number while
another might use the five-digit
abbreviation that is used with on
campus phones.
Coding these translations into
the computer takes time and for
now is only being done by Infomas
ter's creators. Raver is the only
employee currently working on
this project full time.
In a few years, database owners
might be able to fit their own
databases into the system, accord
ing to Rayer. This mass input capa
bility could pave the way for the
kind of explosive growth that the
World Wide Web has experienced.
Data security may also present
a challenge, according to the Stan
ford Information Network propos
al. Deciding who will get access to
information over the network,
whether users will have to pay for
that service and who will be able
(or required) to add databases to
the system may present new legal
questions.
Because information from dif
ferent databases is joined without
the user necessarily knowing the
source, new databases might need
to be certified for accuracy to avoid
polluting the network with inaccu
rate data, Rayer said.
Rayer said he hopes to be able to
present parts of the Stanford net
work at the International World
Wide Web Conference that the
University is hosting this April.
New on-campus uses of Infomaster
could be implemented as early as
next year.
Infomaster is likely to be mar
keted to private companies as a
way to integrate their own
databases. According to Rayer,
Internet giant Netscape Commu
nications Corp. already makes a
large proportion of its money by
setting up "intranets" within com
panies.
