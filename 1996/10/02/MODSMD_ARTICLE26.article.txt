## Former soccer star now shines in major league 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
In the solar system of brilliance in
habited by Stanford alumni, former
Stanford soccer standout Mark Semioli
has charted his own Galaxy as a Major
League Soccer player.
Semioli, a 1990 graduate and now a
starting defender on the Los Angeles
Galaxy, came back to town last weekend
to face the San Jose Clash. Despite a
pulled stomach muscle that caused him
to miss the first game of the series — a
1-0 loss at San Jose on Thursday — he
played 70 of 90 minutes in the second
playoff game Sunday in Los Angeles.
Sunday's game took place at the Rose
Bowl in front of about 29,000 screaming
fans. The Galaxy won the second of the
three-game series 2-0, forcing a third
and deciding game in Los Angeles
tonight at 7:30 p.m.
Ask Semioli if it's always been his
dream to play professional soccer in
America, and he answers wryly, "To be
honest — no." As a child growing up in
Hauppauge, N.Y., he started playing
soccer at age 6 and went on to play in
youth leagues and Olympic develop
ment teams. Semioli planned to use his
sport to get an education, not provide a
profession.
Semioli was recruited to Stanford by
former men's soccer coach Sam Koch,
who saw him playing in an All-Star
game in the fall of his senior year of high
school.
Until then Semioli had never heard
of Stanford. "Coming from the East
Coast, you know about the Ivies, but
anything west of the Mississippi, forget
it," Semioli said.
He was convinced to head west after
a recruiting visit to the Farm, during
which he was impressed by the "excep
tionally nice people — players and espe
cially non-players. Essentially, once you
see Stanford, the decision is made."

While Semioli was at Stanford, the
soccer program never made the NCAA
playoffs, but he was still pleased with
his personal growth and that of the
squad.
"I was given a lot of freedom and a
pretty open role on the team to develop
into a team leader," Semioli said.
Coming from a very structured game
in New York, Semioli found that his new
freedom on the field translated into con
crete leadership skills. He credits his
Stanford experience with having helped
him in his professional role as a team
and field leader.
At Stanford "you're on a team with a
bunch of other guys, all very talented
athletically and very bright — if you can
lead these types of people, you can do
anything," Semioli said.
Semioli's time at the Farm was well
spent athletically. Former coach Koch
called him one of the best players in Stan
ford history. His long list of awards in
cludes All-America honors, four-year
team MVP and selection as one of Soccer
America's top 11 players in the country.
Semioli didn't consider playing pro
soccer until his junior year in 1988,
when a local semipro team, the San
Francisco Blackhawks, was created as
part of the fledgling American Profes
sional Soccer League. Semioli joined a
handful of other college stars playing in
the college offseason, which meant that
he played NCAA soccer from August to
November then trained and played for
the pro league from December to June.
The intense training schedule, com
bined with 15-20 units per quarter of
political science, made for a busy couple
of years until graduation.
To be a professional
After graduating from Stanford in
1990, Semioli found that it was "a big
jump from college to the pros, especially
because college soccer is not as devel
oped a game as, say, NCAA basketball,

which is more of a feeder system to the
professional leagues."
Semioli thinks the gap between col
lege and professional soccer will grow
narrower as the MLS grows and pros
pers, the skill level of American players
rises, and college soccer becomes "more
of a farm system " According to Semioli,
younger players are already skipping
college to go straight to the pro leagues
at home as well as overseas, where soc
cer is the high-paid glamour sport of su
perstars.
In America "most soccer players still
go through college programs, so they're
more educated than your average foot
ball or basketball player — they could do
other things than play soccer, and make
more money, to be honest," Semioli
said.
In its first year, the MLS was created
by bringing all the existing pro leagues
together, which, with the needed funds,
led to tremendous exposure, extensive
television coverage, and a new level of
professionalism in the administration
of the sport and the treatment of the
athletes.
The league's success is especially evi
dent in Los Angeles, where Semioli's
team has set league attendance records
at the Rose Bowl from a high of 90,000
fans to an average of about 30,000.
"Now national team coaches can see
good American players play in America,
whereas in the past you had to go over
seas to prove you were a good player,"
Semioli said. While the MLS still
doesn't quite compare with the top
leagues in Europe, it is only in its first
year.
"In 10 years, it might be the opposite,
because foreign players love America
and want to come here," Semioli said.
"Right now if you play well in MLS,
you'll get opportunities to play on the
national team or in Europe," Semioli

said. He should know: Semioli just
found out that he's been added to
the National Team player pool,
which makes him eligible to play
for that most visible of American
soccer organizations, the U.S.
World Cup team.
Style vs. Substance
As a brand-new organization,
the league was set up to be mar
ketable, which Semioli said trans
lates into flashiness. Semioli
points to teammate Cobi Jones as
an example.
"He's a good player, very fast,
but most importantly, he has a
special look," Semioli said. "Basi
cally, he's a solid, normal guy with
cool hair. Not to take any credit
away from Cobi, but when you're

trying to sell the sport, sometimes
it's flair over substance."
Semioli, who describes himself
as "a mellow, laid-back kind of
guy," is a nice reminder that
sometimes substance and talent
win out over flamboyance and
style.
The style / substance debate is
particularly lopsided in celebrity
studded Los Angeles. For exam
ple, Andrew Shue of "Melrose
Place" (who Semioli described as
"a good player, runs a lot, crosses
well") is on the roster of the
Galaxy, although his TV commit
ments make him unavailable to
play most of the season. One play
er on the team is dating actress
Kimberly Williams ("Father of the
Bride"), and Janet Jackson has a
box at the stadium.
Players are occasionally recog
nized around town, and Semioli
said they make a strong effort to
be more approachable than other

pro athletes. Semioli particularly
enjoys meeting kids.
"It's a new, different thing to
do in L.A.," Semioli said. "We'll
see if the popularity lasts."
What does it feel like to be
playing professional soccer in
America?
"It was never my dream from
when I was little . .. but when I
talk to former Stanford team
mates, who are working in some
great jobs and doing very well for
themselves, they all say, 'I would
do anything to trade places with
you.' And if you think about it,
you're doing something you love,
you get paid some money for it,
you're outside every day . . . it's
not too bad."
The team's practice schedule
means just two or three hours per
day of work, leaving plenty of time
for "other things." True to his
Stanford overachiever roots,

other things for Semioli include
law school part time; he's now in
his final year.
He sees himself playing for an
other four or five years, until age 33
or so, when "you start to lose a step
or two — or three," he adds with a
smile. Then his plans might include
practicing sports law; he's current
ly the team's union representative.
"We don't actually have a union
yet, but we're trying to get it start
ed," Semioli said.
For the future, he defmitely
wants to stay involved in soccer;
he sees himself maybe ending up
at a small school in the Bay Area,
which he loves, coaching soccer
and teaching law.
"When you put a lot of years
into something you love, and you
enjoy the sport and the people,
you'd love to stay involved," Semi
oli said. He paused, then grinned.
"But I want to play a few more
years first."
