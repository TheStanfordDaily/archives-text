The Sacramento State Hor
nets hoped that they would not
suffer the same fate that the last
37 visitors to Maples Pavilion
had endured. They had no such
luck.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team (11-1) crushed the Hor
nets 15-6, 15-2, 15-6 last night,
extending its home winning
streak to 38 matches.
"I think we got intimidated
early," said Sacramento State
coach Debbie Colbert. "It was
hard to compete against the size,
and they just had better ath
letes."

dated early. It was
hard to compete

they just had better
athletes.'

Sacramento State coach

The Cardinal started the
match slowly, falling behind 3-0
as the Hornets' finesse game
frustrated Cardinal hitters.
However, Stanford quickly
found its rhythm as freshman
outside hitter Kerri Walsh and
junior middle blocker Barbara
Ifejika gave the Card the lead 5-
4.
Sacramento State (9-6) fought
back valiantly, tying the score at
6-6 behind strong hitting from
outside hitter Carissa Buie, but
the Cardinal squad's significant
height advantage began to take
its toll.
Senior middle blocker Eileen
Murfee and Walsh provided a
blocking wall that Sacramento
State had trouble penetrating.
Freshman outside hitter Jaimi
Gregory registered two kills near
the end of the game to seal the
match and give the Cardinal a
15-6 victory.
"I think we came out, played
hard and did really well," said
Walsh, who led the Cardinal in

each match this homestand in
kills, this time with 20. "We also
had a lot of fun."
With senior co-captain
Catherine Juillard setting, Ifeji
ka, Walsh and junior outside hit
ter Kristin Folkl provided an
early spark and helped the Card
to a 9-2 lead in the second game.
The Cardinal continued the bar
rage and finished off the Hornets
15-2 after executing a nearly
flawless offensive and defensive
game.
Game three began with fresh
man outside hitter Sarah Clark
providing a kill for Stanford. Ife
jika and Walsh once again gave
the Cardinal an early lead, as
Juillard handed out assist after
assist.
Even with the match well
under control, Stanford's inten
sity level remained high. Gregory
epitomized the Card's level of ef
fort, diving through the air and
making a dig which eventually
led to a Stanford point.
Senior middle blocker Nikki
Otto added a kill, helping Stan
ford to an 11-1 lead in the final
game. The Hornets inched their
way back, notching five consecu
tive points to bring the score to
11-6 before eventually falling to
the Card 15-6.
The Cardinal successfully
contained the entire Hornets
lineup, including star outside
hitter Jill Haas.
Haas "is a great athlete and
player, but she just doesn't have
the size," Colbert said. "She is an
emotional player, and I think
once the reality of the situation
set in, that [emotion] was hard to
maintain."
Stanford went deep into its
bench, giving every member of
the squad a chance to play. How
ever, the Card suffered no loss of
intensity. The Stanford squad
committed just five unforced hit
ting errors throughout the entire
match.
"Everyone went out there and
played hard," Stanford coach
Don Shaw said. "All we ask of
them is to go out there and do
their job and play hard, and I
think they did an excellent job of
that."
The Cardinal will next take
the hardwood against California
in Maples Pavilion on Friday at 7
p.m.
