# Defense now Stanford strong point
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
At this time last year, the Car
dinal football team had a 2-0-1
record against its first three op
ponents: San Jose State, Utah
and Wisconsin. This year, after
having played the same three
teams, Stanford's record is an
unimpressive 1-2.
While it has been hard to find
bright spots in the team's first
three performances, the Cardinal
defense has given fans reason to
believe the squad has a shot at the
Rose Bowl.
The Stanford defense, which
many believe is the best defensive
unit to hit the Farm since 1992, is
currently ranked first in the Pa
cific 10 Conference and ninth na
tionally in scoring defense, allow
ing just 11 points per game.
"Right now I think the majori
ty of our guys are playing pretty
well," said head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "I think that is indi
cated by the scores that they have
given up and by the way that
we've been able to be in games
thus far with the limited offen
sive production that we've had."
Stanford's defense played well

against Utah and San Jose State
but did not really give anyone
cause to celebrate until the Wis
consin game Sept. 21, when the
defense put together its best
showing in years.
The Cardinal "D" shut down
the vaunted Wisconsin ground at
tack, holding the Badgers to just
2 yards on 13 rushes in the first
half. The Wisconsin running
backs, which had finished with
336 total yards the previous
week, were held to just 101 rush
ing yards — 54 of those coming
late in the fourth quarter when
the defense had already been on
the field for more than 30 min
utes.
"It was the best defensive ef
fort that I have ever been a part
of," junior tackle Carl Hansen
said. "This whole year has been a
great improvement over the last
few years that I have been here."
What many may be seeing in
the defense is the maturation of a
unit that has been together for a
few years and just needed time to
get stronger and more cohesive.
"I attribute it to the experience
of the team — we're older as a
