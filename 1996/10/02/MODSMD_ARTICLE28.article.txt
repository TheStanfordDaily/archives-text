# Defense now Stanford strong point
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
At this time last year, the Car
dinal football team had a 2-0-1
record against its first three op
ponents: San Jose State, Utah
and Wisconsin. This year, after
having played the same three
teams, Stanford's record is an
unimpressive 1-2.
While it has been hard to find
bright spots in the team's first
three performances, the Cardinal
defense has given fans reason to
believe the squad has a shot at the
Rose Bowl.
The Stanford defense, which
many believe is the best defensive
unit to hit the Farm since 1992, is
currently ranked first in the Pa
cific 10 Conference and ninth na
tionally in scoring defense, allow
ing just 11 points per game.
"Right now I think the majori
ty of our guys are playing pretty
well," said head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "I think that is indi
cated by the scores that they have
given up and by the way that
we've been able to be in games
thus far with the limited offen
sive production that we've had."
Stanford's defense played well

against Utah and San Jose State
but did not really give anyone
cause to celebrate until the Wis
consin game Sept. 21, when the
defense put together its best
showing in years.
The Cardinal "D" shut down
the vaunted Wisconsin ground at
tack, holding the Badgers to just
2 yards on 13 rushes in the first
half. The Wisconsin running
backs, which had finished with
336 total yards the previous
week, were held to just 101 rush
ing yards — 54 of those coming
late in the fourth quarter when
the defense had already been on
the field for more than 30 min
utes.
"It was the best defensive ef
fort that I have ever been a part
of," junior tackle Carl Hansen
said. "This whole year has been a
great improvement over the last
few years that I have been here."
What many may be seeing in
the defense is the maturation of a
unit that has been together for a
few years and just needed time to
get stronger and more cohesive.
"I attribute it to the experience
of the team — we're older as a

Stanford will sorely miss senior lineman Pete Swanson this Saturday
unit and we've got another year
under our belt in [defensive coor
dinator Bill] Harris' system,"
Hansen said.
For whatever reasons, Stan
ford's defense has shown dramat
ic improvement over last year's
squad. This year's defense has al
lowed nearly 15 fewer points per
game compared to the 1995 squad
through three games. Additional
ly, the defense has allowed five
fewer touchdowns and 38 fewer
yards per game, while recording
six more sacks than the unit did
at this point in Harris' first year.
"We're happy with our im
provement, but there is always
room to improve more," Hansen
added. "[We need to improve on]
our third down conversions and
overall defense."
As Hansen said, the one area
where the Cardinal defense has
suffered is on third down, as Car
dinal opponents are an impres
sive 21 for 45. That 47 percent
conversion rate must come down

if Stanford is to win many more
football games.
"Stopping people on third
down is our weakness," said se
nior strong safety Eliel Swinton.
"We need to realize that no mat
ter how tired we are, no matter
what happened on first or second
down, we've got third down and
it's time to stop them."
The Cardinal defense will head
to Seattle this weekend one man
short, though, as senior nose
tackle Pete Swanson will miss
Saturday's game against Wash
ington with a dislocated shoulder.
Willingham will rotate sopho
more Andrew Currie, junior An
thony Willis and senior Evan
Wagner in Swanson's absence.
The rotation, he hopes, won't
handicap the unit against Wash
ington. Swanson's absence
"makes us one man weaker, but
we expect that [Currie], [Wagner]
and [Willis] will step up and play
their best football now."
Swinton holds another, less
complex approach to the Husky
game. "It's that easy and that
general — we need to stop them
and we need to win," Swinton
said.
