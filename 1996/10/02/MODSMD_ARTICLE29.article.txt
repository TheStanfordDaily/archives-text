Despite men's soccer's disappointing loss Friday to the Cal
State-Northridge Matadors, sophomore midfielder A.J.
Sauer was able to please the large, enthusiastic home crowd
with Stanford's lone goal of the game, which he executed
skillfully in the sixth minute of the first half.

Freshman outside hitter Kerri Walsh continues to stun fans
with her powerful hitting and high-velocity serving. In Stan
ford's last three matches, Walsh led the team in kills with 17
against Washington State on Friday, 18 against Washington
on Saturday and 20 against Sacramento State last night.
