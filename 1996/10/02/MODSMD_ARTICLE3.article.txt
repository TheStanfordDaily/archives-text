# Committee confusion
## E-mails exchanged over nominations 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Students appointed to University committees
by the ASSU Nominations Commission will take
their seats as planned despite suggestions to the
contrary from administration officials.
ASSU President Bill Shen received word Mon
day that some committees would circumvent the
commission and select student members indepen
dently.
In an e-mail message to former ASSU Senate
Chair Alane Murdock, Trish Del Pozzo, assistant
to Academic Secretary Susan Schofield, said she
had instructed officials to find student represen
tatives to University committees on their own.

"By using the original Nom Comm recommen
dations, later declared invalid by you, and some
recruitment, I think the committees now have
their students, I hope," she wrote.
According to a long-standing agreement with
the University, the ASSU is responsible for ap
pointing all student members to University com
mittees. Murdock had never invalidated the com
mission's appointments.
Shen, angered by what he called a "lack of good
faith," lashed back with an e-mail of his own.
"Committees have been assigned students,
and any appointments made outside of the ASSU
Nom Comm process will be unacceptable," Shen
wrote. "It is frustrating to have worked so hard to
establish a legitimate and respectable nomination

process only to have it tarnished by administra
tive bungling."
During an emotional exchange yesterday,
Shen issued an ultimatum to Del Pozzo: Provide
justification for removing appointed students
from their committees or let them take their
seats.
Del Pozzo recanted.
"I have no problem with the appointments.
The list of students nominated bv the ASSU has
been distributed to the necessary committees,
and those committees have begun contact their
(student) representatives," she said in an inter
view vesterdav. "There was some confusion about
whether those nominations were
valid. The ASSU says they are, so
there is no problem."
Shen was equally conciliatory.
"I have confirmed with Ms. Del
Pozzo that the nominations from

last spring are current and are
valid, and we are ready to proceed
with a productive year," he said.
"Any confusion that may have ex
isted was due to a lack of communi
cation and unsubstantiated ru
mors."
Nanci Howe, director of the Of
fice of Student Activities, is entrust
ed with maintaining communica
tion between the ASSU and the Aca

demic Secretary's Office. She
claimed to have no knowledge of the
incident.
Shen, for his part, was anxious to
move beyond the confusion.
"The ASSU and the Academic
Secretary's Office have a long histo
ry of cooperation and can continue
to work together to ensure student
representation on University com
mittees," Shen said.
