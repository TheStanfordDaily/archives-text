# Peace is possible
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
Experts across the country have
questioned whether President Clin
ton can help bring a resolution to
the current crisis in the Middle
East, and Stanford professors are
no exception.
Violence erupted throughout the
West Bank a week ago after Israelis
opened a controversial northern en
trance to the tunnel that runs
under Jerusalem's Temple Mount,
a holy place for both Jews and Mus
lims. When the gunfire finally
stopped Saturday, 55 Palestinians
and 14 Israelis were dead.
Some, such as History Prof. Joel
Be in in say flatly that the Clinton
administration will be unsuccessful
in creating an agreement between
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, who are meeting in
Washington this week, along with
King Hussein of Jordan.
"In an election period, I think
the Clinton administration won't
be willing to put in the time and ef
fort it takes" to achieve peace,
Beinin said.
"The Clinton administration
has been the most uncritical of Is
rael," he continued. "They have
missed dozens of opportunities to
put pressure on Israel."
But others, such as Assoc. Reli
gious Studies Prof. Arnold Eisen
and History Prof. Steven Zipper
stein, chair of the Jewish Studies
Program, believe the Clinton effort
may, in fact, bring about a resolu

tion.
Clinton is "doing the right
thing," Eisen said. "He's putting
pressure on both sides to do what is
necessary to make sure the peace
doesn't crumble."
Zipperstein said he thought the
Washington meeting might present
an opportunity for Israel to extend a
peace offering to the Palestinians.
But he remained doubtful of a
successful outcome.
"In the long run, I don't see the
Netanyahu government satisfying
even the most minimal Palestinian
needs, and I don't see this Israeli
government satisfying the needs of
Israelis themselves in their search
for peace," he said.
This is the worst clash in the Is
raeli-occupied West Bank since the
Oslo peace accords were signed
three years ago. Although the vio
lence has receded, and there have
been two days of relative calm, ten
sions remain high. Some fear peace
in the area will never be recovered.
The most recent outbreak fur
ther complicates the already prickly
relationship between Netanyahu
and Arafat.
"The action taken by the Ne
tanyahu government was provoca
tive and irresponsible," Zipperstein
said. "A few more actions like this
could put the final nail in the coffin
of the peace process.
"If this occurs, this will be a
tragedy for Palestinians and Israelis
alike. My only hope is that Ne
tanyahu will prove to be such a
awful and inefficient head of state
that his coalition will abandon him."
