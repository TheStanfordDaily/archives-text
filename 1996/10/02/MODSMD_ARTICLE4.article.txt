# Student groups unite to fight Prop. 209
## 
### Kumar Narayanan 
A diverse coalition of student ac
tion groups has organized to plan a
campaign against Proposition 209,
the California Civil Rights Initia
tive.
The coalition's strategy is pri
marily to focus on voter registra
tion. Another area of work will be
publicity in the form of an e-mail
list, a poster campaign and possibly
a rally. Many members will attend
a rally on Immigrant Day, Oct. 6.

In addition, the "Stop Prop
209" statewide campaign has engi
neered a bus tour called "Save the
Dream" that will come to Stanford
today. Included on the program is
Dolores Huerta of the United
Farm Workers and Eleanor Smeal
of Feminist Majority. They will
speak in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at
7 p.m.
Proposition 209 introduces lan
guage into the state's constitution
that says the state "shall not dis
criminate against, or grant prefer

ential treatment to a group on the
basis of race, sex, ethnicity, color or
national origin." Proponents say
the measure would help create a
color-blind society.
However, many minority
groups on campus feel the measure
would unfairly deprive them of op
portunities. The measure would
mainly affect employment and ad
missions policies in state organiza
tions.
Several groups are represented,
including Resistance Action Grass

roots Organizing Education; the
Chicano Graduate Student Associ
ation; MEChA, the Chicano / Lati
no student group; the Black Stu
dent Union; the Asian American
Student Association; and Students
for Environmental Action at Stan
ford.
"There's a lot of confusion out
there," said senior Marianna Aue, a
member of RAGE who was at an or
gan izational meeting Monday at El
Centro Chicano. "Peopleare loathe
to vote against something that's
called civil rights, but [Proposition
209] does the opposite."
She said she hopes to unite sev
eral communities who were af
fected in the wake of Proposition

187 â€” a California ballot initia
tive passed in 1994 that made ille
gal aliens ineligible for social ser
vices.
Many students came to Mon
day's meeting independently. "I
am definitely affected" said sopho
more Talesha Reynolds, "because I
am an African American and a
woman."
Some students thought the un
derlying idea of the proposition was

a good one but questioned whether
its effects would be positive.
Proposition 209 "doesn't ad
dress real issues in a way they can
be fundamentally changed," said
sophomore Jocelyn Wiener.
The proposition would have lit
tle effect here at Stanford because
it is a private university, but it
could cause major changes at pub
lic schools such as UC-Berkeley
and UCLA.
