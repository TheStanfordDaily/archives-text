# Judicial charter open for review
## 
### David Stein Staff writer 
A draft of the new Legisla
tive and Judicial Charter,
which promises to give stu
dents greater control over the
Judicial Affairs process, will
soon be open to public debate.
The charter, which is not
yet in its final stages, redefines
the disciplinary procedures of
the Office of Judicial Affairs,
allowing a panel of students

and staff rather than a single University offi
cial to determine whether a student has violat
ed the Honor Code.
Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback, chairman of
the Committee of 15, the panel charged with
developing the revised document last spring,
said the charter, if enacted, will overhaul a dys
functional and outdated judicial system.
"This charter is completely new," Zoback
said. "We have thrown out the old one. There
was not one part of this campus — administra
tion, faculty or students — who approved of it."

In addition, the charter calls for greater stu
dent awareness of the Honor Code, Zoback
said.
"We have an obligation and a commitment
to the Honor Code," Zoback said. "Students
fought very hard for the code, and they deserve
to be aware of it. We can't expect it to work in
the dark; it needs light and fresh air."
In the past, the charter required that a stu
dent accused of violating either the Honor
Code or the Fundamental Standard would
have his or her disciplinary fate decided by a
designee of the dean of students. Through a se
ries of meetings, the designee alone would de
termine the student's guilt or innocence and
then dole out punishment, Zoback said.
Violations of the Honor Code pertain to aca
demic dishonesty, while breaches of the Fun
damental Standard — what Zoback called "the
agreement to be good citizens" — involve gen
eral disruptive behavior.
Under the proposed system, a student will
face a judicial panel comprised of four students
and two faculty or staff members. At that point,


Zoback
the dean of students would approve
any proposed punishment, and the
student would have the opportuni
ty to appeal the decision.
Zoback stressed that the appeal
process of the new system is still
being finalized. He does not yet
know how exactly the appeal
process will work, but he said it
will be fairer for the student in
volved.
With the current system, one
official in the Office of Judicial Af
fairs both provides information to
and collects evidence against stu
dents accused of violating the
Honor Code or the Fundamental

Standard.
This will change under the new
system; a judicial officer will act as
a "prosecutor" for the accused stu
dent, while a separate judicial ad
ministrator will act as a neutral
party to help inform the student of
his or her rights.
Because the charter does not
need to be submitted for approval
until the end of fall quarter,
Zoback hopes to solicit additional
feedback from members of the
Stanford community first.
He plans to present the charter
to the ASSU Senate soon so stu
dents can start discussing the var
ious proposals.
Senior Howard Loo, a member
of the committee and an ASSU
senator, is pleased with the pro
posed changes.

"I'm really happy with the
whole process," Loo said. "Every
one has worked together to create
abetter system."
Loo added that the ASSU Sen
ate's committee on student af
fairs, of which he is a member,
plans to begin a program to in
crease student awareness for the
Honor Code. He could not elabo
rate on this plan.
ASSU President Bill Shen also
was encouraged by the direction
the review committee has taken in
allowing more student involve
ment in the judicial process and by
the attention it is paying to the
Honor Code.
"The Honor Code is at the very
core of what it means to be a Stan
ford student," Shen said. "It
means having respect for yourself,

for others and for elders around
campus."
Although Shen agrees with
many of the changes, he said he is
concerned with possible redefini
tion of the "burden of proof"
clause, which determines the level
of guilt a student must show to be
found culpable. (See related
story.)
Before the charter becomes of
ficial policy, it must be approved
by the ASSU Senate, the Faculty
Senate and University President
Gerhard Casper.
Casper instructed the commit
tee early last spring to revise the
judicial charter. The charter cur
rently in place was implemented
in 1968, "a turbulent time" not
corresponding to our current soci
ety, Zoback said.
