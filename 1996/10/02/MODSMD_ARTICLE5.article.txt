# Judicial charter open for review
## 
### David Stein Staff writer 
A draft of the new Legisla
tive and Judicial Charter,
which promises to give stu
dents greater control over the
Judicial Affairs process, will
soon be open to public debate.
The charter, which is not
yet in its final stages, redefines
the disciplinary procedures of
the Office of Judicial Affairs,
allowing a panel of students

and staff rather than a single University offi
cial to determine whether a student has violat
ed the Honor Code.
Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback, chairman of
the Committee of 15, the panel charged with
developing the revised document last spring,
said the charter, if enacted, will overhaul a dys
functional and outdated judicial system.
"This charter is completely new," Zoback
said. "We have thrown out the old one. There
was not one part of this campus — administra
tion, faculty or students — who approved of it."

In addition, the charter calls for greater stu
dent awareness of the Honor Code, Zoback
said.
"We have an obligation and a commitment
to the Honor Code," Zoback said. "Students
fought very hard for the code, and they deserve
to be aware of it. We can't expect it to work in
the dark; it needs light and fresh air."
In the past, the charter required that a stu
dent accused of violating either the Honor
Code or the Fundamental Standard would
have his or her disciplinary fate decided by a
designee of the dean of students. Through a se
ries of meetings, the designee alone would de
termine the student's guilt or innocence and
then dole out punishment, Zoback said.
Violations of the Honor Code pertain to aca
demic dishonesty, while breaches of the Fun
damental Standard — what Zoback called "the
agreement to be good citizens" — involve gen
eral disruptive behavior.
Under the proposed system, a student will
face a judicial panel comprised of four students
and two faculty or staff members. At that point,
