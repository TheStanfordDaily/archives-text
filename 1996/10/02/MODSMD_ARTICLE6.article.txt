# Burden of proof still under debate
## 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Members of the University community
have been nearly unanimous in their sup
port for the proposed overhaul of the Leg
islative and Judicial Charter. There is still
one issue, however, which could derail the
new plan: burden of proof.
Under the current plan, a student ac
cused of violating either the Honor Code or
the Fundamental Standard must be proven
guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt," the
same condition under which criminal trials
operate in the United States.
But there is debate as to whether this
standard should be kept.
On one side is Geophysics Prof.
Mark Zoback, chairman of the
Committee of 15 which drafted
the new charter. He said he feels
"reasonable doubt" is too tough a
standard for University officials.
However, how much the standard
would be lowered remains in ques
tion; Zoback explained that such
parameters are difficult to define.
Yet in the same breath, Zoback

was quick to point out how tricky
this issue could potentially be
come.
"We are ready to be flexible be
cause this is such a huge issue,"
Zoback said. "But we do not want
this issue to dominate the whole
discussion surrounding the judi
cial process."
On the same side is Anthropolo
gy Prof. Jane Collier, another mem
ber of the committee. Although she
said she favors lowering the level of
guilt, she admitted that "in a practi
cal sense, [a change] could be very
hard to implement."
A potential roadblock to imple

mentation of the change might
come in the form of ASSU Presi
dent Bill Shen.
While calling the overhaul of
the judicial process "a vast im
provement" over the old plan,
Shen said he was "extremely con
cerned" with any change that
could violate students' rights.
"I have spoken with students
and faculty, and many are angry
about cheating," Shen said. "How
ever, we must always respect the
rights of the innocent first and
foremost."
Shen added that while the vary
ing levels of guilt associated with

burdens of proof are somewhat
"ridiculous," the burden of proof
is nevertheless symbolic of stu
dent liberty.
In addition, Shen said he would
hate to see this issue stand in the
way of an "otherwise great re
form" and added that he will do
his best to help approve most of
the reform.
In a somewhat similar vein,
Zoback said the best way to decide
this "red herring" issue would be
to let the student body decide.
"I would like to hear from stu
dents on this matter," Zoback
said. "It should be up to them."
