# Police say alcohol policy unchanged
## Presidential expenditures also debated at first ASSU meeting 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Relieving recent fears of a police crackdown
on campus social events, Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington told members of the ASSU
Senate yesterday that his officers would not rig
orously seek out alcohol offenders in residences.
During the last two weekends, 19 people were
arrested or cited on alcohol-related charges â€”
only two of those in University housing facilities.
"We do cite and arrest underage drinkers

when it comes to our attention, but I am not naive
enough to believe that I will ever totally control
that," said Herrington, who was speaking to the
ASSU Senate's first meeting of the year at the re
quest of Dean of Students Marc Wais.
After extensive questioning from ASSU Fi
nancial Manager John Hall and ASSU Senator
Fern Mechlowitz, Herrington assured senators
that his office has no desire to infiltrate campus
social events.
"If we were on a campaign to do that, we could
arrest 100 people at everyone of those," Herring

ton said. "I am not interested in that; I don't
have time for that. As long as there are no calls,
we won't come in, but when someone calls, we
are obliged to act."
Herrington, when asked, indicated that in
many instances calls to police originate within
the residence hosting the party, often from a
house authority.
He said better communication with party
givers before an event can help ease tensions and
calls to the police.
"We are getting more informa
tion and more accurate informa
tion that allows us to get out to a
party site before the party occurs
and speiik with the house officers
and aid the residence in giving a
party without our attendance later
on," he said.
The University recently has
taken steps to ensure more such
communication.
"The shooting (at a party at
Tresidder LTnion) last February
served as a catalyst for a new Uni
versity committee on party guide
lines," Wais said. Those guidelines
require organizations to notify the
University of planned parties two
weeks in advance.

"If relationships can be devel
oped, problems can be worked out,"
Wais said.
Later in the meeting, ASSU
President Bill Shen was grilled after
he requested to have his presiden
tial discretionary account reim
bursed for expenses incurred while
registering voters and bicycles.
Undergraduate Senator
Howard Loo announced his inten
tion to oppose any attempt to fund
with senate moneys what he
termed "unfair subsidies."
Shen spent more than $ 1,000 on
the bicycle registration campaign,
an event that saved 309 students a
total of $772.50.
"It's a very expensive way to
publicize the ASSU, and now we
are being pressured to reimburse
money that's already been spent
and that's unfair," Loo said.
Senators requested a full ac
counting of Shen's projects before

they would consider allocating the
reimbursement. Shen and Hall
promised to provide the informa
tion at the senate's next meeting.
Shen suggested that "the budget
is only a recommendation for the
year" and the senate is free to real
locate funds from its accounts to
cover the costs of his programs. If
the senate does not reimburse him,
the costs will nearly bankrupt his
discretionary fund, he said.
Apologizing for his actions, Shen
said he could not contact senators
for pre-approval during the sum
mer, when he required the funds.
The senate also confirmed
some of Shen's choices for cabinet
members. Alberto Tovar will serve
as the director of voter registra
tion, and Michael Putnam will
manage special projects. Junior
Kelly Naylor will be ASSU Vice
President Nick Thompson's assis
tant.
