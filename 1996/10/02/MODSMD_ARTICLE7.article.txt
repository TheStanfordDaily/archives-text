Relieving recent fears of a police crackdown
on campus social events, Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington told members of the ASSU
Senate yesterday that his officers would not rig
orously seek out alcohol offenders in residences.
During the last two weekends, 19 people were
arrested or cited on alcohol-related charges â€”
only two of those in University housing facilities.
"We do cite and arrest underage drinkers

when it comes to our attention, but I am not naive
enough to believe that I will ever totally control
that," said Herrington, who was speaking to the
ASSU Senate's first meeting of the year at the re
quest of Dean of Students Marc Wais.
After extensive questioning from ASSU Fi
nancial Manager John Hall and ASSU Senator
Fern Mechlowitz, Herrington assured senators
that his office has no desire to infiltrate campus
social events.
"If we were on a campaign to do that, we could
arrest 100 people at everyone of those," Herring

ton said. "I am not interested in that; I don't
have time for that. As long as there are no calls,
we won't come in, but when someone calls, we
are obliged to act."
Herrington, when asked, indicated that in
many instances calls to police originate within
the residence hosting the party, often from a
house authority.
He said better communication with party
givers before an event can help ease tensions and
