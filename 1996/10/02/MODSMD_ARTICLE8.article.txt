Academic advising at Stanford
is heading in a new direction as
the Undergraduate Advising
Center tries to expand its efforts
beyond its immediate sphere.
According to new Undergradu
ate Advising Director Lori White,
the center has introduced new
services, including an advising
hotline, an e-mail hotline and a
"froshline" that students have al
ready taken advantage of this

past summer.
Center Director Hector
Cuevas retains his current posi
tion under the reorganization;
White will be responsible for a
broader range of concerns, in
cluding both the center and out
reach efforts.
"We took the old position (of
director of the center) and recon
ceptualized it," Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education
