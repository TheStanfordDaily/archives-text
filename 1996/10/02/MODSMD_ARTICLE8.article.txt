# UAC makes changes, extending its efforts

Academic advising at Stanford
is heading in a new direction as
the Undergraduate Advising
Center tries to expand its efforts
beyond its immediate sphere.
According to new Undergradu
ate Advising Director Lori White,
the center has introduced new
services, including an advising
hotline, an e-mail hotline and a
"froshline" that students have al
ready taken advantage of this

past summer.
Center Director Hector
Cuevas retains his current posi
tion under the reorganization;
White will be responsible for a
broader range of concerns, in
cluding both the center and out
reach efforts.
"We took the old position (of
director of the center) and recon
ceptualized it," Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education


Johnny Zannis and Jesse Oxfeld â€” Dally
Ramon Saldivar explained.
In addition to organizing advis
ing services, White will be respon
sible for bringing advising out of
>weet Hall and more into academ
ic departments and dormitories,
rather than "just advising the stu
dent who happens to drop into the
center," Saldivar said.
The new programs are part of
an ongoing series of interven
tions" which began last spring to
improve the quality of undergrad
uate advising on campus, accord
ing to Saldivar.
Saldivar said that in addit ion to
changes and improvements at the
center, the entire advising system
at Stanford is being augmented.
In preparation for fall quarter,
there was an adviser training ses
sion concerning new additions to

the curriculum, such as the
change from the distribution re
quirements system to the new
general education requirements
system, the new language require
ment and the institution of the
minor.
Features such as the advising
hotlines are the immediate visible
effects of the changes to the advis
ing system, but, according to
Saldivar, these things "are only a
forerunner of bigger, better
things."
Among these changes is a new
pilot program called the Humani
ties Undergraduate Major En
hancement Program. The pro
gram, which involves depart
ments such as English and Span
ish, takes proposals from depart
ments on how to improve advising
for majors, and the University
provides funds to create new ad
vising programs for these majors.
Saldivar said the program "has
worked phenomenally well" in the

few months since its inception.
Although the program is not a
direct extension of undergraduate
advising, White said she wants the
advising center to assist academic
departments and Saldivar in pro
viding incentives to faculty to be
come advisers as part of the pro
gram.
"We need to find a way to make
the resources available at Stan
ford to students early on," White
said.
Saldivar said the main theme
in the implementation of these
changes is to "add opportunities
for students to get into advising
opportunities with faculty" and to
make sure students understand
that advising is for everybody
from pre-freshmen to seniors.
"I want students at Stanford to
have the best of both worlds" in
the sense of having tremendous
resources in the faculty of Stan
ford as well as a small college envi
ronment, White said.
