Have something to say about Proposition 209?
The Daily is looking for guest columnists to contribute to an upcoming special Op-Ed page focusing on the CCRI. If you want to
convince the campus that we ought to support or reject Prop 209, this is your chance. If you're interested, e-mail us at
"letters@daily" or call 725-2100 x512. Ask for David or Heather.
