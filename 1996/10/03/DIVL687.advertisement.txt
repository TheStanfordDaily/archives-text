DOING 1T...
BORN TO RUN
Like Springsteen said, Lija
Houston was horn to run. Shewww —
Lija Houston sure covers a lot of ground.
While interning this summer for Senator
Slade Gorton (R-WA) in Washington,
D.C., the American studies major could
be found running along the banks of the
Potomac or zig-zagging from landmark
to landmark for an hour-and-a-half each
day. To expand her horizons, she rode forty-mile bike tours out
of the nation's capital to faraway horizons, like Mt. Vernon,
Virginia.
Upon returning to her home state of Washington this fall,
Houston wasn't about to cool her heels. First, she ran in a half
marathon through Seattle's suburbs with her mother. Now she is
training for the Seattle Marathon in November.
Lija is picking up the pace for her final lap at Stanford: the
senior pounds the pavement around Campus Drive and treks the
local foothills. She also sprints through an impressive number of
extra-curricular events. To wit: she is an active member of the
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, works in the Dean's office, sits
on the Senior Class Council, coordinates campus events for the
Inter-Sorority Council and then, for a finishing lap, volunteers in
the press box for men's basketball.
And one more thing: Lija coaches a fourth grade girls
basketball team in Menlo Park. After all, to stay on cam
pus all day would certainly limit the horizons of someone
like Lija. Baby, she was born to run. A little air guitar, please
for that last line?
