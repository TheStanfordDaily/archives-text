Faye Wattleton
Life on the Line
An outspoken pro-choice crusader and the president of Planned Parenthood from
1978 to 1992, Wattleton combines the story of her life with a definitive history of the
reproductive rights movement. She provides a behind-the-scenes look at Planned
Parenthood, religious fanaticism and the extreme tactics favored by abortion foes, the
campaign to block Judge Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court, and her
personal challenges along the way.
