It's the second week of classes and the time to file a study
list is almost upon us. Time sure flies when you're having
fun, eh? Doesn't it seem like just yesterday that you were
in, say, fourth grade and your teacher was Mrs. Carmichael
and she favored short students because she was short,
too, and you wore sneakers with hearts on the shoelaces,
and you had a crush on Brad Goldfarb, and you and Karen
Kirstopolous were the only two kids who had lice when the
nurse checked in the hall during morning recess? You
bawled, but Karen handled the situation with dignity and of
fered you Luden's cherry cough drops while you sat on the
steps outside waiting to be picked up by your moms. And
now here you are on the Farm, and Karen is working as a
cocktail waitress at a horrible comedy club called Go Ba
nanas in your hometown, and she's thinking about getting
married. Funny how things turn out, isn't it? Ponder this and
others of life's mysteries by dropping off a free classified in
the box on the CD shelf in the Intermission cubicle in the
Daily office in Storke Publications Building, across from
Terman, on Planet Earth.
