# Freedom Bus hits Stanford
## 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Contributing writer 
Resounding shouts of "Hey,
hey, vote no! Prop. 209 has got to
go" beckoned members of the
Stanford community into Dinkel
spiel Auditorium last night for a
rally given as part of the Save the
Dream Freedom Bus Tour.
Once inside, the audience lis
tened to impassioned speeches

made by Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United
Farm Workers of America, and Eleanor Smeal,
president of the Feminist Majority. Both speakers
condemned Proposition 209, the California Civil
Rights Inititative.
"California is the battleground in the 1990s as
Mississippi was in the 19605," Smeal said in a
statement. "If California outlaws affirmative ac
tion programs for women and minorities and guts
sex discrimination law, you can be sure the attack
will spread nationwide."
The nation's attention is now focused on the
outcome of the battle over Proposition 209, said
Smeal, adding that politicians are poised to follow
the lead which California will set.
Proposition 209, which will be on the ballot in
November, is the most recent in a series of propo
sitions drafted across the country which have
threatened affirmative action programs and at
tempted to reduce the strength of sexual discrimi
nation laws.
In the past two years, 17 states have attempted
to pass similar propositions, and nine bills have
gone before Congress with similar contents. None
of the propositions or bills has passed.
The Save the Dream Bus Tour's biggest task is
to educate citizens about the contents of the propo
sition. Although it is referred to as a "civil rights"
proposition, according to Smeal, "both sides of this
battle agree [Proposition 209] outlaws affirmative
action."
The words "outlaw," "prohibit" and "affirma
tive action," however, are nowhere to be found in
the proposition. Smeal lamented that "the average

Californian probably will not
know, even if [Proposition 209]
passes, what they voted on be
cause the language is so tricky."
The rally predicted dire conse
quences should the proposition
pass. Not only would affirmative
action be threatened, but rally
participants said sexual discrim
ination laws could be gutted and
athletic programs for women de
creased. Essentially, said a vol

unteer, "This proposition turns
back time."
Huerta concluded the rally by
leading the audience in shouts of
"Si, se puede," which in Spanish,
means "Yes, we can do it."
Volunteers traveling on the
Freedom Bus also contributed
their voices to the mass outcry
against California's Proposition
209 by describing the efforts
they are making to educate the
public.
Many of those leaving Dinkel
spiel after the rally handed mem
bers of the Freedom Bus Tour
cards offering their services as

volunteers. While volunteers are
needed prior to the election to ed
ucate the public about the propo
sition, Smeal and Huerta said
they hope to have the strongest
show of strength made by volun
teers on election day, outside the
polling booths.
The volunteers have traveled
from all across the United States
to participate in the battle.
The Save The Dream Bus
Tour, which began Sept. 29 in Los
Angeles — when Jesse Jackson
participated in church visits, a
press conference and a rally — will
continue through next Thursday.
