to pass similar propositions, and nine bills have
gone before Congress with similar contents. None
of the propositions or bills has passed.
The Save the Dream Bus Tour's biggest task is
to educate citizens about the contents of the propo
sition. Although it is referred to as a "civil rights"
proposition, according to Smeal, "both sides of this
battle agree [Proposition 209] outlaws affirmative
action."
The words "outlaw," "prohibit" and "affirma

the proposition. Smeal lamented that "the average
