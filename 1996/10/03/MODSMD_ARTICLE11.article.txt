Fuhrman pleads no contest
(AP) — Fonner Los Angeles police Detective Mark Fuhrman
pleaded no contest — interpreted as guilty by the court — to one
count of perjury. In exchange for the plea, he was sentenced to three
years of probation, fined $200 and ordered not to disobey the law.
John Mack, Los Angeles Urban League president, said he was
pleased charges were filed but called the penalty "a slap on the wrist."
Amen to that!
HAMBURG, Germany (AP) — A businessman and devout Ito man
Catholic who stopped to pray at a church during a trip to Stockholm
ended up a millionaire, the Bild newspaper said yesterday.
The church was empty except for a coffin containing the remains
of a man, so Eduardo Sierra knelt down and prayed for the deceased
for 20 minutes, the Hamburg-based daily said.
Jens Svenson, the man he had prayed for, was a 73-year-old real
estate dealer with no close relatives. He had specified in his will that
"whoever prays for my soul gets all my belongings," Bild said.
