# Summit makes little progress
##

WASHINGTON (AP) -
Marathon negotiations between
Israeli and Palestinian leaders
failed to resolve bitter differences
that exploded in Mideast violence
and jeopardized the fragile peace
process. But the two sides agreed
to press ahead with nonstop talks
beginning Sunday.
Israeli Prime Minister Ben
jamin Netanyahu proclaimed a
feeling of greater trust with Pales
tinian leader Yasser Arafat as dis
cussions ended yesterday. But he
added, "I don't have any illusions
whatsoever about the difficulties
ahead. It's a very tense period
fraught with dangers right now."
Closing the White House-spon
sored talks, President Clinton said
somberly, "We have not made as
much progress as I wish we had."

He said he was not certain the
Mideast crisis was over but
expressed confidence that violence
would subside.
"Please, please give us a chance
to make this thing work in the days
ahead," Clinton implored Pales
tinians and Israelis.
He said he was sending Dennis
Ross, the senior U.S. mediator, to
Sunday's peace negotiations at
Erez, a border crossing between
Israel and Gaza.
The top priority will be Hebron,
the West Bank town where Israel
has refused to fulfill a promise to
move its troops from Arab neigh
borhoods into Jewish settlements
by March.
Netanyahu, talking to reporters
at his hotel, said that if lower-level
negotiators don't resolve the

Hebron dispute, "Arafat and I will
sit down until we solve it. We
agreed to do that."
Netanyahu and Arafat sat
stone-faced, side by side in the East
Room with Jordan's King Hussein
at the wrapup of the talks. By pre
arrangement, they declined an
opportunity to talk there.
Leaving the White House,
Netanyahu vigorously shook
Arafat's hand, clasping it with both
hands for several seconds. Clinton
beamed. Arafat saluted Clinton
before stepping into his car. The
president returned the gesture.
Netanyahu said the summit
"cemented the principle that the
path to peace is through negotia
tions and not through violence."
He added, "The children of Israel
are safer tonight."

Nabil Shaath, a top aide to
Arafat, said the summit's failure
was Israel's fault. "There is no
agreement about anything. Presi
dent Clinton did his best to put the
peace process back on track, but
the Israelis wouldn't let him,"
Shaath said.
Five weeks before U.S. elec
tions, the inconclusive summit
brought Republican charges that
Clinton had risked the prestige of
his office and came up empty
handed.
Another sensitive issue left
unresolved were Palestinian
demands that Netanyahu close an
ancient tunnel near Muslim and
Jewish holy sites in East
Jerusalem. The opening of the tun
nel sparked last week's violence
that left 76 dead.
