University must ensure
permanent funding for
the Women's Center

Well, it's about time. The
University has finally
stepped up to the plate and
offered the Women's Center the
financial support it needs.
This year, for the first time ever,
the center will receive an additional
$50,000 from the University. The
money will let the center increase
its staff and outreach programs.
Specifically, a part-time graduate
coordinator will be hired, as will five
student interns. The funding will also
pay for a part-time coordinator of the
Graduate Women's Network, a group
commited to academically supporting
graduate women. New programming
includes a brown-bag lunch series, a
big sister / little sister exchange and a
sophomore support group.
By providing these new services,
the administration is proving its
dedication to women students. The
support is long overdue.
The center's roots date back to
1971 when a women's group first
started meeting. Later, the Univer
sity provided the women's group
with its own building (originally
near the Toyon Eating Clubs and
now in the Fire Truck House) and
paid for the maintenance of that
space. In addition, a part-time coor
dinator position has been funded
since the mid-1980s.
But this paltry budget (just
$22,000 last year) wasn't enough to
meet the diverse needs of female
students. So, student volunteers
helped out, and the Women's Col
lective, the umbrella group that
runs the center, asked for an ASSU
special fee from the student body.
While a good attempt, this
arrangement was haphazard, at
best. Without a permanent struc
ture in place, the center had a diffi
cult time starting new programs or
outreach activities and instead
maintained the status quo.

And women suffered. Studies
commissioned by the University
showed female students weren't
getting the services they needed and
were more likely than their male
counterparts to have health and
psychological problems.
Now, we're not suggesting that
this gender disparity will magically
disappear due to a new infusion of
cash. Women will undoubtedly still
experience these problems but new
programming and support services
should make a difference.
That difference will be owed to
the women who lobbied for the Uni
versity funding.
Instead of whining when they
lost their special fee last spring,
women's leaders put together a plan
of attack. They submitted a formal
proposal to the University, which
emphasized the academic nature of
programming; they met with
administrators, and they mobilized
their peers to care about an issue —
a nearly impossible task among
today's apathetic students.
Other organizations searching
for cash should follow the center's
example. The Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Community Center is one
group that has indicated a need for
more University funding. Commu
nity leaders have already compiled
data about unmet needs and now
need to give the University a specif
ic proposal for funding.
So, the story of the Women's
Center seems to have a happy end
ing: The women got what they
wanted and will now live happily
ever after.
But will they? That all depends.
The University at this point has
only committed to a year of funding.
Administrators had better come
through with the rest. It would be a
disaster to make the center go back
to depending on special-fee funding.
With permanent University sup
port, women can focus on expansion
instead of spending their time wor
rying about future funding.
For the new grants to be mean
ingful, the University must offer its
unconditional support in the long
run.
