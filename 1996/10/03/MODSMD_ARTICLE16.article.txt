AD I V E R S E
group of 15 fac
ulty and staff
have assembled to cre
ate an entirely new judi
cial process for Honor
Code and Fundamental
Standard violations.
The cleverly named

Committee of 15 is proposing sweeping
reforms which will affect generations of
Stanford students. These changes strike
at the heart of how you define yourself
and what you believe your rights are as a
student.
The committee's preliminary recom
mendations display extraordinary vision.
Who says the administration doesn't
want students involved in their affairs?
Under the new system, students would
play a prominent role in the adjudication
and penalty phase in the judicial process.
This sort of student involvement, in coor
dination with a planned Honor
Code / Fundamental Standard education
campaign, will reinforce the mutual
respect and self-dignity current policies
lend to students.
Forget what U.S. News & World
Report wants everybody to believe, we
are the finest academic institution in the
world. By most standards we're living in
a fantastic Utopia. Sometimes we might
even convince ourselves that our Stan
ford world is free of society's corrosive
ills. But who are we trying to kid? The
committee's reforms are in response to

an apparently low conviction rate for the
sludge of society, sexual harassers and
sexual aggressors, and the slime of Stan
ford society, cheaters. We must temper
our emotions toward these vermin with
rational decisions. Do we overreact and
give up our rights to a fair trial? Or do we
hold the University on a commitment to
the highest standard? Sometimes we
never really appreciate what we have
until it's gone ... or almost gone.
The Burden of Proof
I am not even going to attempt to
impress everyone with a lofty legal argu
ment for retaining the burden of proof at
"beyond a reasonable doubt." The whole
issue is ludicrous!
If you're guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt, you're at least 99 percent guilty.
But if there's "clear and convincing evi
dence" you're probably guilty . . . maybe .
. . at least somewhere between 65 percent
and 80 percent guilty. How in the world
can anybody quantify guilt? Maybe we
should determine guilt on a curve! If the
burden of proof is lowered in a response
to a low rate of conviction, then you can
argue that it is being lowered to make it
easier to convict students. The bottom
line is that we are obligated first and
foremost to protect the rights of the inno
cent. I don't claim that this system is per
fect — I do claim that it is fair.
Lowering the burden of proof tries to
address two complex situations which are
difficult to prove — sexual harassment

and sexual assault. Sexual harassment is
most often either stalking or unwelcome,
sexually suggestive actions. There are
several actions students can take to
remove themselves from these situations
without having to prove the guilt of the
accused. Stanford has departments
which deal with both the complainant
and the accused. Since sexual harass
ment is one person's word against anoth
er, the burden of proof would have to be
lowered to 50 percent or less to convict.
At that level, our rights no longer exist.
The judicial affairs process is a crimi
nal trial. Given that, it would be unac
ceptable to gamble with "clear and con
vincing evidence." On the issue of sexual
assault, the University is neither
equipped nor is it expected to investigate
and adjudicate cases of this nature. Rape
is a crime which transcends the Funda
mental Standard. These aggressors need
to be locked away from society, not sus
pended or expelled. We cannot claim to be
able to do a better job of handling this
filth than the legal system which exists
outside of the Stanford shell.
The ASSU
The ASSU Senate will determine the
fate of the committee's recommenda
tions. For those that have never been
interested in the proceedings of your stu
dent government, now is a good time to
start.

Bill Shen is the president of the ASSU.
