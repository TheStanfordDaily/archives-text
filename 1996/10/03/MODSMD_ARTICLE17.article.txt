Student calls for the appreciation of our simpler lives

IN NO OTHER TIME in history have
our lives been so different from our
grandparents' lives. Technological
breakthroughs and achievement'? are
occurring at an accelerating rate; there
fore, our lives are getting simpler, easier,
faster and more portable each day. We
have come a long way since the Pony
Express, as information and communica
tions spread throughout the globe in an
instant. The technological age is
extremely conducive to business now
that the world has become smaller, but
what are the detriments of these never
before experienced changes? Are we as a
society emotionally ready to handle an
era that is advancing more rapidly than
any other? Is technology turning us into
spoiled children?

New and improved products are con
stantly getting quicker and easier to use.
Thus, bits are transmitted faster, pro
grams are run faster, faxes are sent
faster, Web sites are accessed faster, etc.
Technology is steadily moving us into a
world in which results happen more
speedily; that is to say, a world wherein
instant gratification is becoming the
expected norm. For example, 386 person
al computers, marvels of technology just
five years ago, are now arcane dinosaurs
Thirty-three million cycles per second
just doesn't seem to cut it nowadays.
With each new development, people
are becoming used to having to wait less
amounts of time. While this is great for
busy professionals who now have more
time to be even more productive in the

office, the lightning pace of technology
has literally raced into all avenues of peo
ple's lives. Unfortunately, these other
areas have not improved at the same rate
(like traffic lights which are red while fac
ing no perpendicular traffic). Still, people
are clearly more impatient both in and
out of the workplace. In other words, if
they could be using a 28,800-baud
modem, why are they stuck with some
9,600-baud piece of junk? Analogously, if
they could zoom home at 70 mph, why
are they stuck behind some moron going
55? Why is this line so long? When are
they going to get here? Why am I still on
hold? WHY DO I HAVE TO WAIT?
Why should people need to wait when
breakthroughs and innovations are con
sistently saving time all around us?

Technology is the wealthy parent spoil
ing us little children. In our new and
volatile virtual-reality, instant-gratifica
tion world, we need to demonstrate some
humbling maturity and recognize that
we are fortunate to live in a society that
no longer needs to perform the
monotonous drudge work so dutifully
completed by computers and machines.
We need to be gracious for what we have
achieved thus far and not take our
already relatively simpler lives for grant
ed. We must not let our advancements go
to our head, for, after all, do we control
technology or does technology control
us?
