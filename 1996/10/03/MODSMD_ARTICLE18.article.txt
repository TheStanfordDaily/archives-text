# Coed bathrooms, vegan diets and the Naked Guy clarified by Synergy house
## 
### 
We just wanted to convey our utmost
gratitude for the free publicity you've pro
vided us in that tasty Monday article,
titled "Could It Have Been Divine Inter
vention?" Subsequently, revenues from
tourist dollars have skyrocketed; projec
tions for the quarter are indeed so favor
able that plans for the construction of a
second Nookie Room are currently being
devised.

Though we fully realize the extent
to which The Daily stands alone in its
full-bodied attempt to keep the student
populace informed, we just couldn't
resist the opportunity of "frying up"
this culinary delight to add a bit of zing.
True enough, coed bathrooms can
add a bit of shock value to one's daily
life. One word to those who stand at the
urinal — remain calm, keep your aim
and whatever you do, don't turn around
in greeting.
The definition of vegan, in addition
to prohibiting dairy products and inor
ganic produce, includes abstention from
all animal byproducts, and though this

is not the required diet of all inhabi
tants, there are always the die-hards —
and the die-harders (who also abstain
from eating Bruce Willis).
Other common misconceptions
include the clothing factor. One resident
recalled, as a freshman attending the
Naked Guy's speech in Branner Lounge,
hearing questions as unbelievable as
"Well, what about winter? What do you
do in winter?" To wit, Mr. Martinez
responded, "I wear clothes. What do you
think?" It's viewpoints like this that
still give me hope for the U.S. govern
ment.
In conclusion, we wanted to thank

you again for the exposure (maybe folks
will know where Synergy is now). There
is no doubt that Synergy is a magical
place that engenders fairy tales and leg
ends of all shapes and sizes.
One must ask of oneself occasionally,
"Should I believe the hype?" The
answer is here, friends. If it serves the
greater purpose of maximum protection
against viscosity and thermal break
down, and the whole is greater than the
sum of its parts, be the tool maker, not
the tool.
