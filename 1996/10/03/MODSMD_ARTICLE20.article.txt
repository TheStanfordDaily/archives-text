# Brian Singer: Notes from the Eastern front
## Pondering the actual progress in today's Russia 
### 
ARRIVING IN RED Square for the
first time since the fall of Commu
nism in 1991,1 didn't gaze at beau
tiful St. Basel's Cathedral, the stunning
16th-century church seen in all postcards
from Moscow. I didn't look at the red walls
of the Kremlin, which centuries ago served
as the boundary of the Moscow fortress.
Having been in Moscow before, I want
ed to see what had changed.
I looked at the red, white and blue Rus
sian flag which now flies atop the Kremlin,
the main aesthetic difference in Red
Square since my previous trip to Moscow
five years ago. And I stared at the Russians
around me who, as I discovered during my
flight from Paris, are now conscious of
their identity, their history and the West.
It is this social consciousness which led
them to Red Square that Sunday. They
too wanted to see Red Square and that flag
with their own eyes. Their eyes affixed on
the flag, they then turned and gazed at
me.
I soon realized that although we were

looking at the same structure, we saw it
differently. The Russian who guided me
through the Moscow streets saw the Rus
sian flag with its three equal stripes blow
ing in the wind above the Kremlin. 1
wasn't looking at that, though. I looked
for the red Soviet flag with the hammer
and the sickle. I didn't see it.
To the right of the flag and outside the
Kremlin walls stands the mausoleum
where, for more than 60 years, the pre
served (more than preserved) body of
Lenin has rested. I looked for the line
wrapping around the opposite end of the
Kremlin. I didn't see it.
I watched as a Russian near me turned
and looked at me, an American, a West
erner — another American, another West
erner. He didn't even look to Lenin.
He saw what was present in Red
Square, what was flying atop the Kremlin,
and the Western culture which, after
being introduced to the Soviet Union dur
ing perestroika, has inundated the former
Soviet states since its collapse.

The former citizens of the Soviet Union
see what is present in Moscow, in Vladi
vostok or in whatever newly independent
state they reside. I, on the other hand, see
only what has disappeared, and what has
not appeared.
What has not appeared, as many
economists and political scientists are
quick to say, is a consolidated market econ
omy and a consolidated democracy. The
West sees this. Many who formerly
believed in communist principles for lack
of being presented with an alternative do
not.
Only minutes after arriving in Moscow,
I left Sheremyetevo Airport with Stanford
in Moscow's assistant director. After
receiving the parking fee, the parking
attendant who took the money nodded to
another parking employee who lifted the
crossing gate and let our car pass.
This example of "economic inefficien
cy" is seen easily through Western eyes,
but not necessarily by Russians. For 75
years, the Russian people were trained in

Communist-run schools with the ideology
of the Communist Party and the econom
ic principles of Karl Marx.
While many remnants of the old system
remain, sometimes I would rather think
more like the former Soviet citizens and
notice not what has yet to appear or what
needs to appear hut what exists now.
Escaping the ideology of Marxism-
Leninism will be difficult, but it is possi
ble. Speaking on the plane to a Russian
scientist about the remaining communist
states — specifically North Korea and
Cuba — 1 was surprised when he said, "We
are normal. They are abnormal." Only
minutes later, he could not believe that in
America, engineers were allowed to earn
more money than professors.
Western influence in Russia is here to
stay, politically, economically and socially.
A remaining question is whether the West
can tolerate two people working each
parking gate — whether the West can
understand it.
Being grounded in capitalism like all

Americans, I expect everything to behave
according to the theories I have learned. Is
it possible that some professors receive
higher wages than engineers while some
engineers receive higher wages than pro
fessors? Do people understand the market,
supply and demand, free prices?
And lastly, the larger question: Will the
West understand or believe it if not all the
suppliers and consumers understand mar
ket functions? Is it possible to think like
the post-Soviet producers and consumers?
It was quite obvious to me through my
short visit to Red Square that I was view
ing Russia and Russians as a transition
from Communism, while they viewed the
situation as a transition to democracy.
They saw what had changed. I saw
what had not.
