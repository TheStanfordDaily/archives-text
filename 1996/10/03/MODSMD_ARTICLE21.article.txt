# Construction prompts parking changes
## 
### Dan Wolk 
Significant changes have been implemented to
the University's parking infrastructure this year,
according to Transportation Programs Business
Manager Ixniise Aryapour.
The changes include the installment of hun
dreds of new parking spaces to replace those sup
planted by new building construction, an empha
sis on using alternative transportation and im
proved customer service.
According to Transportation Programs M.in
ager Julia Fremon, whenever the University
needs to add new buildings, parking lots provide
obvious space.
Two major parking lots that are being trans
formed into University buildings are the Varian
lot near the northwest corner of the Main Quad,
site of the future statistics building, and the
Governor's Corner lot, site of future graduate
housing.
Building entire new parking lots, however, is
difficult, said Aryapour. "Resources are
scarce. .. . The University wants land for educa
tion, not parking."
In order to accommodate the loss of the Varian
and Governor's Corner parking lots, Transporta

tion Programs has added hundreds of new spaces
around campus, most notably in an expanded
Roble parking lot and curbside parking along a
shrunken Mayfield Avenue in front of Florence
Moore Hall.
In addition, Transportation Programs has
also attempted to promote alternative trans
portation uses. These efforts have included
raising parking permit and meter prices, dou
bling the range of the Marguerite Shuttle ser
vice and offering a cash rebate of up to $90 for
those who commute without a car and live out
side of the Stanford parking permit system.
The programs seem to be doing well, said
Transportation Programs Program Manager Jef
frey Tumlin. "Ridership from trains has risen,
and the Marguerite is doing wonderfully," he
said.
Tumlin was also quick to point out that all the
improvements were financed from such sources
as parking permit and meter sales and not by gen
eral University funds or tuition.
"Those people who are not commuting should
not have to pay for improvements," he said.
In conjunction with the improvements in the
parking infrastructure, Transportation Pro
grams has implemented certain other measures

to improve customer service. These measures in
clude an automatic bank deduction for permit
payments and new permit schedules.
"Doing all this cuts the wait in lines in half,"
said Aryapour.
Transportation Programs also has many up
coming plans. In some of the new student hous
ing, there will be enclosed and secure places to
park bicycles. Many new buildings will be built
with added bike parking. Among other things,
"we are exploring electric vehicles, late night
shuttles [and] golf carts," Tumlin said.
Because commuting congestion is caused by
the large number of students, faculty and staff
that live off campus, officials at Transportation
Programs avidly support the proposed Sand Hill
Road project, which will widen Sand Hill Road
and add parking and much-desired housing to a
parcel nearly 70 acres in size.
According to the draft environmental impact
report for the project, "The proposed residential
projects will contribute fewer new single occu
pancy vehicle commuter trips per dwelling unit
than most existing developments in the study
area due to their proximity to employment op
portunities at the Stanford Campus, Medical
Center and Shopping Center."
