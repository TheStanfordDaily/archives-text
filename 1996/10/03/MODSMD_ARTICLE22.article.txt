## After beating Cal, field hockey ready to top winless St. Louis 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The Stanford field hockey team (4-
1, 2-1 Northern Pacific Conference),
already enjoying a three-game win
ning streak, is in top condition to play
St. Louis (0-7) today on Tate Marfil
Field at 3 p.m.
Stanford triumphed over the Bil
likens last season in St. Louis by a
count of 2-0, but Cardinal members
said the Billikens are still a strong
squad that will require Stanford to
keep its guard up.
"We are probably a better team,"
said sophomore midfielder Jordyn
Kramer, who scored the first goal in a
match against California on Saturday
despite back problems. "But I don't
know anything about their team this
year, and we have to keep our intensi
ty."
After a spectacular winning match
against the Golden Bears that brought
many Cardinal fans to their feet, the
team picked up its daily practice sched
ule on Monday right where it left off,
at its very best.
"We are building off of the energy
from Saturday's game toward the
game against St. Louis," said sopho
more midfielder Paige Mader. "Prac
tices are just as intense, but there is a

sense of relief because we know we
now have a sure shot [at the NorPac
title] after last Saturday."
According to Kramer, the Cardinal
must keep focused and keep on playing

'What we are really aiming
for is total domination.
Last Saturday, not only
were we able to win, but
we were also able to
dominate the game.'

like they have all season. Stanford has
already earned half its victory total for
all of 1995, when it went 8-6 and won
the NorPac title.
St. Louis will face Cal on Saturday
as its West Coast trip continues. Al
though the Golden Bears (2-5, 2-1
NorPac) are neck and neck with Stan
ford in the NorPac race, they have al
ready played nationally ranked squads
like Northwestern and Boston Univer
sity.
"We have yet to play the East Coast

teams, which Cal already played and
lost to," Mader said. "There is still the
need to be the very best we can."
A squeaker will not satisfy the
rapidly improving Cardinal squad
against the winless Billikens.
"What we are really aiming for is
domination," said senior tri-captain
Baochi Nguyen. "Last Saturday, not
only were we able to win, but we were
also able to dominate the game. That's
what we hope to do [against Saint
Louis]."
The Stanford players appear more
than ready for the hapless Billikens as
well as the challenges they will face in
the many games to follow. In fact,
many alumni complimented coach Sh
eryl Johnson after Saturday's game,
saying they had never seen a Cardinal
team look better,
"There is less pressure just because
we beat Cal," Mader said. "And what's
important is the faith we all have in
each other now. I don't think anyone is
nervous about [the St. Louis match].
We are all looking forward to it, and I
think we will do really well."
The St. Louis contest is the first of
two matches for Stanford at Tate
Marfil Field this weekend. The squad
will return to conference play when it
battles NorPac foe Pacific on Saturday
at 1 p.m.
