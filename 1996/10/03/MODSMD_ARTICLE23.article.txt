# Nike tourney to test talents of Cardinal women's soccer
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Tiger Woods isn't the only Stan
ford person sponsored by Nike. On
the contrary, this weekend the
women's soccer team hosts the
Nike Invitational, one of the top
soccer events in the country.
Coming to town on Friday are
No. 3 Santa Clara, No. 15 Clemson
and No. 24 Butler. Stanford,
ranked 14th', "will"face off against
the Clemson Tigers at 3 p.m. to
morrow and the Butler Bulldogs
on Sunday at noon. Santa Clara
plays Butler at 1 p.m. tomorrow
and Clemson at 10 a.m. on Sunday.
All games will be played at Maloney
Field.
The Tigers (7-2-1), a powerful
offensive team, hail from soccer's
toughest league, the Atlantic Coast
Conference. In their 10 games this
season, they have scored 31 goals
and have only been shut out once,
in a 2-0 loss to top-ranked North
Carolina.
Leading that explosive Clemson
attack is Beth Keller. The fresh
man has scored eight goals and tal
lied six assists for 22 points. Sara
Burkett aids Keller in the attack.
She has amassed five goals and
three assists, totaling 13 points on
the year.
To beat Clemson, coach Steve
Swanson said the team is going to
have to play solid team defense and
concentrate on controlling the ball.
"We've really been working on
possessing the ball better, really
taking care of it, especially in our
end of the field," Swanson said.
"Hopefully we can combine that
with some of the things we focused
on early in the season, like team de
fense and individual play."
Sophomore goalie Erin Bryla
said that so long as the team plays
well, it will be able to handle the
Tiger offense. "We just need to play
our own game and worry about the
things that we can take care of,"
said the sophomore keeper. "If we
can step the attack up early, hope
fully we can take them out of their
game early and make them play to
us.
On the offensive side of the ball,
the Cardinal appears to be growing
more potent every day. Senior for
ward Emily Burt, who missed the
last two games due to an injured
shoulder, is expected to be back in
the lineup tomorrow. She has
three goals already this season and
led Stanford in scoring before she
went down against Santa Clara on
Sept. 22.
Joining Burt on the road back
from injuries are sophomore Tra
cye Lawyer and junior Rita Her

miz. Swanson is hopeful that both
players will be ready for action on
Friday. Hermiz started all four
games she played this year, scoring
one goal.
The additional firepower com
ing off the injury list will accompa
ny a Cardinal front line that has
been very hot of late. Charmaine
Leßlanc, who was pointless
through the first five games of the
season, has caught Ike over the
past two weeks. The sophomore
forward / midfielder has assumed
the Cardinal scoring lead, register

ing 11 points on four goals and
three assists in the last four games.
Seniors Erin Martin and Mandy
Tucker are also playing very well.
Tucker scored one goal and had
three assists in her first two starts
this past weekend. Martin, the
Cardinal's leading scorer from a
year ago, has totaled eight points
this year on three goals and two as
sists.
Sunday marks the second meet
ing between the Cardinal and the

tempts to retrieve It In a game against Santa Clara Sept. 22.
Bulldogs. The teams first met in
October 1993, when Stanford
cruised to a 4-0 victory. Butler (7-1-
1) has improved considerably since
then and should give the Cardinal a
much better contest this year.
It will take two complete games
for the Cardinal to have a success
ful weekend, Swanson said.
"My biggest thing is consisten
cy, right from the beginning of the
game to the end of the game," said
Swanson, who is in his first year as
head coach. "I have a lot of faith in

the players' abilities, but we've had
a lot of little lapses that have cost us
a lot.
"A few mental lulls have really
hurt us, and we can't have that. I'm
still looking for us to play 90 min
utes of good soccer."
But while the coach can't guar
antee that kind of effort from his
team, he did say that Maloney
Field would undoubtedly be host
ing excellent soccer all weekend.
"These should be really good col
lege soccer games," Swanson said.
"I'm excited about this weekend,
playing at home in front of our
fans. It should be a lot of fun for
us."
