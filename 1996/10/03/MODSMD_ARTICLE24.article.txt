# Cheers for Stanford Aerobics Program
## Student-run fitness fun 
### 
I'm taking a risk here. I'm
about to write about a topic
that could potentially alien
ate those of you readers who
have even gotten this far.
I'm going to write about aer
obics, the Stanford Aerobics
Program in particular.
Now, some of you may scoff
at the thought of the topic of
aerobics taking up a whole col
umn on the sports page. Others
may simply be disinterested.
But some, however small the
portion, will cheer my decision
to write about a subject that
has probably never before re
ceived attention in the sports
section, or any other section for
that matter, of The Daily.
To that first category of
scoffers, I hope to prove to you
that, though aerobics is not a
sport, it is certainly worthy of
some "sports" attention. To
those who are bored, stop read
ing now and go read World and
Nation or something. And to
those cheering, check out the
comprehensive schedule for the
Stanford Aerobics Program
this fall.
Despite my support of aero
bics as a terrific venue for exer
cise and fitness, I don't consid
er it a sport, and I certainly
have no plans to ever watch the
aerobic championships aired on
ESPN2 at 2 a.m. But I do think
that aerobics is one of the most
cardiovascular and enjoyable
workouts out there for those in
terested in individual athletics.
And in fact, even team ath
letes utilize aerobics, particu
larly step aerobics. Both the
women's swim team and the
women's gymnastics team do
step aerobics for cardiovascular
training.

Personally, step aerobics ties
with running as my favorite
form of efficient exercise, both
being types of intense activity
that can burn tons of calories
and build stronger muscles in
about an hour's time. Step aer
obics may even get extra points
in my book, because it causes
less stress on the joints when
done properly and provides
more of a full body workout
than running (although run
ning is a sport, which brings it
added allure).
As a Stanford student who
has tried out a number of aero
bic programs, I can wholeheart
edly say that the Stanford Aer
obics Program is the best this
area has to offer when one is

taking convenience, price and
mission into account.
Before I go on any further, I
must insert a disclaimer: I am
an instructor with the Stanford
Aerobics Program, and there
fore, I am inherently biased.
But as a voluntary participant,
it should make sense that I sup
port and praise the program,
and, as a columnist, I've earned
the license to provide press to
those organizations I think de
serve more exposure.
Though I've taken aerobics
classes on and off since I was

about 13 years old, I just start
ed teaching classes last winter
when I was studying overseas
at Stanford in Florence. We had
access to a local gym which had
aerobics classes I attended
somewhat religiously to coun
teract the long, lazy meals filled
with incredibly large portions
of authentic Italian food and
red wine — meals that were
more often than not followed by
my favorite flavor of gelato and
a nap.
One of the instructors in my
Italian aerobics class asked me
to be a substitute for her, so I
bought some music tapes of
Firenze discoteca tunes, put to
gether a routine, studied how to
say "Keep it tight!" and "We're
almost done!" in Italian and be
came a foreign aerobics instruc
tor.
As a freshman, I had started
out taking the aerobics classes
offered by the Department of
Athletics, but after attending a
number of classes, found my
self disappointed with many
things, primarily the low level
of intensity of the classes, the
music and the class locations.
With the discovery of the
Stanford Aerobics Program
later that year I found what I
was looking for — a program
that offered a variety of intense
classes in a variety of on-cam
pus locations with a variety of
convenient times. Not only
that, the instructors were
young and energetic and the
price was extremely reason
able.
After teaching aerobics
abroad, I returned to Stanford
last spring and, after an audi-


Vanessa
Arrington
tion, became an instructor with the
Stanford Aerobics Program, for
which I'm currently teaching a
morning step class.
Despite the fact that the pro
gram reeled in $14,700 last year
from fees charged to participants (a
pretty large number considering
class members are only $25 per
quarter to attend as many classes as
they want), I still feel it is a program
unknown to the average Stanford
student interested in aerobics, who
is often either dissatisfied taking

classes offered by the University or
paying much higher price tags at
some health club off campus.
"Most students in our classes re
alize what a gw)d deal they are get
ting, " said Susan Wandling, financial
officer mid instructor with the pro
gram for six years. "It's usually about
$10 a class at a club. Our prices are
very reasonable."
In addition to the prices, the
Stanford Aerobics Program im
presses me in other ways. As of the
end of fall quarter 1992 the program
made the transition from being run
by Cowell's Health Improvement
Program to students. Consequent
ly, suggestions by class members
and instructors on how to improve

the program are taken quite seri
ously and usually acted on immedi
ately.
Although the ASSU supports
and legitimizes the program, it is
not funded by the ASSU but rather
by participants' fees. Instructors
are reimbursed for money spent on
shoes, music, etc., but coordinator
Martha Mabie-Gardner sees it as
more of a service-based program.
"I feel we serve a big portion of
the community, especially of the fe
male population," Mabie-Gardner
said. The classes are open to the en
tire Stanford community, which in
cludes undergraduates, graduate
students, spouses, faculty, you
name it.

Schedules of classes offered this
quarter are available at the Tresid
der Information Desk, the Ford
Center and Rains Graduate Hous
ing. Schedule and program infor
mation that is updated weekly can
also be obtained by calling the hot
line: 261-6436.
And for those of you who still
doubt that aerobics provides an ex
cellent cardiovascular, full-body
workout, I have one challenge —
7:15 a.m. step aerobics at Rains Ha
cienda Room Mondays and
Wednesdays.

Contrary to popular belief, Vanessa
does not have her own workout tape
in the works.

quarter to attend as many classes as
they want), I still feel it is a program
unknown to the average Stanford
student interested in aerobics, who
is often either dissatisfied taking

classes offered by the University or
paying much higher price tags at
some health club off campus.
"Most students in our classes re
alize what a gw)d deal they are get
ting, " said Susan Wandling, financial
officer mid instructor with the pro
gram for six years. "It's usually about
$10 a class at a club. Our prices are
very reasonable."
In addition to the prices, the
Stanford Aerobics Program im
presses me in other ways. As of the
end of fall quarter 1992 the program
made the transition from being run
by Cowell's Health Improvement
Program to students. Consequent
ly, suggestions by class members
and instructors on how to improve

the program are taken quite seri
ously and usually acted on immedi
ately.
Although the ASSU supports
and legitimizes the program, it is
not funded by the ASSU but rather
by participants' fees. Instructors
are reimbursed for money spent on
shoes, music, etc., but coordinator
Martha Mabie-Gardner sees it as
more of a service-based program.
"I feel we serve a big portion of
the community, especially of the fe
male population," Mabie-Gardner
said. The classes are open to the en
tire Stanford community, which in
cludes undergraduates, graduate
students, spouses, faculty, you
name it.

And for those of you who still
doubt that aerobics provides an ex
cellent cardiovascular, full-body
workout, I have one challenge —
7:15 a.m. step aerobics at Rains Ha
cienda Room Mondays and
Wednesdays.

Contrary to popular belief, Vanessa
does not have her own workout tape
in the works.
I'm taking a risk here. I'm
about to write about a topic
that could potentially alien
ate those of you readers who
have even gotten this far.
I'm going to write about aer
obics, the Stanford Aerobics
Program in particular.
Now, some of you may scoff
at the thought of the topic of
aerobics taking up a whole col
umn on the sports page. Others
may simply be disinterested.
But some, however small the
portion, will cheer my decision
to write about a subject that
has probably never before re
ceived attention in the sports
section, or any other section for
that matter, of The Daily.
To that first category of
scoffers, I hope to prove to you
that, though aerobics is not a
sport, it is certainly worthy of
some "sports" attention. To
those who are bored, stop read
ing now and go read World and
Nation or something. And to
those cheering, check out the
comprehensive schedule for the
Stanford Aerobics Program
this fall.
Despite my support of aero
bics as a terrific venue for exer
cise and fitness, I don't consid
er it a sport, and I certainly
have no plans to ever watch the
aerobic championships aired on
ESPN2 at 2 a.m. But I do think
that aerobics is one of the most
cardiovascular and enjoyable
workouts out there for those in
terested in individual athletics.
And in fact, even team ath
letes utilize aerobics, particu
larly step aerobics. Both the
women's swim team and the
women's gymnastics team do
step aerobics for cardiovascular
training.

Personally, step aerobics ties
with running as my favorite
form of efficient exercise, both
being types of intense activity
that can burn tons of calories
and build stronger muscles in
about an hour's time. Step aer
obics may even get extra points
in my book, because it causes
less stress on the joints when
done properly and provides
more of a full body workout
than running (although run
ning is a sport, which brings it
added allure).
As a Stanford student who
has tried out a number of aero
bic programs, I can wholeheart
edly say that the Stanford Aer
obics Program is the best this
area has to offer when one is

taking convenience, price and
mission into account.
Before I go on any further, I
must insert a disclaimer: I am
an instructor with the Stanford
Aerobics Program, and there
fore, I am inherently biased.
But as a voluntary participant,
it should make sense that I sup
port and praise the program,
and, as a columnist, I've earned
the license to provide press to
those organizations I think de
serve more exposure.
Though I've taken aerobics
classes on and off since I was

about 13 years old, I just start
ed teaching classes last winter
when I was studying overseas
at Stanford in Florence. We had
access to a local gym which had
aerobics classes I attended
somewhat religiously to coun
teract the long, lazy meals filled
with incredibly large portions
of authentic Italian food and
red wine — meals that were
more often than not followed by
my favorite flavor of gelato and
a nap.
One of the instructors in my
Italian aerobics class asked me
to be a substitute for her, so I
bought some music tapes of
Firenze discoteca tunes, put to
gether a routine, studied how to
say "Keep it tight!" and "We're
almost done!" in Italian and be
came a foreign aerobics instruc
tor.
As a freshman, I had started
out taking the aerobics classes
offered by the Department of
Athletics, but after attending a
number of classes, found my
self disappointed with many
things, primarily the low level
of intensity of the classes, the
music and the class locations.
With the discovery of the
Stanford Aerobics Program
later that year I found what I
was looking for — a program
that offered a variety of intense
classes in a variety of on-cam
pus locations with a variety of
convenient times. Not only
that, the instructors were
young and energetic and the
price was extremely reason
able.
After teaching aerobics
abroad, I returned to Stanford
last spring and, after an audi-


Vanessa
Arrington
tion, became an instructor with the
Stanford Aerobics Program, for
which I'm currently teaching a
morning step class.
Despite the fact that the pro
gram reeled in $14,700 last year
from fees charged to participants (a
pretty large number considering
class members are only $25 per
quarter to attend as many classes as
they want), I still feel it is a program
unknown to the average Stanford
student interested in aerobics, who
is often either dissatisfied taking

classes offered by the University or
paying much higher price tags at
some health club off campus.
