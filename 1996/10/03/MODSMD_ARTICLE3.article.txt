Proponents and detractors of Proposition
209, the California Civil Rights Initiative, had
an opportunity to exchange views and gain in
sights in a civil but animated debate yesterday
at the Law School.
Clint Bolick, director of litigation for the
Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Justice,
and Eva Paterson, executive director of the San
Francisco-based Committee for Civil Rights,
met in a head-to-head debate to discuss

whether Proposition 209 would bring Califor
nia closer to the ideal of a gender- and color
blind society.
Proposition 209 — which, according to re
cent statewide opinion polls, is expected to
pass by a large majority — is aimed at ending
all discrimination and preferential treatment
on the basis of race, sex, ethnicity or national
origin in the operation of public employment,
public education or public contracting in Cali
fornia. Nearly 50 students and faculty mem
bers attended the event, hosted by the Stan

ford Federalist Society.
Bolick, who supports the proposition,
opened the debate with a reference to the place
ment of Japanese Americans in internment
camps in the 19405. Calling discrimination an
"issue that has racked America's soul," Bolick
said the government should not be given the
burden of intervening on behalf of or against
citizens of different genders and racial back
grounds.
