Proponents and detractors of Proposition
209, the California Civil Rights Initiative, had
an opportunity to exchange views and gain in
sights in a civil but animated debate yesterday
at the Law School.
Clint Bolick, director of litigation for the
Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Justice,
and Eva Paterson, executive director of the San
Francisco-based Committee for Civil Rights,
met in a head-to-head debate to discuss

whether Proposition 209 would bring Califor
nia closer to the ideal of a gender- and color
blind society.
Proposition 209 — which, according to re
cent statewide opinion polls, is expected to
pass by a large majority — is aimed at ending
all discrimination and preferential treatment
on the basis of race, sex, ethnicity or national
origin in the operation of public employment,
public education or public contracting in Cali
fornia. Nearly 50 students and faculty mem
bers attended the event, hosted by the Stan

ford Federalist Society.
Bolick, who supports the proposition,
opened the debate with a reference to the place
ment of Japanese Americans in internment
camps in the 19405. Calling discrimination an
"issue that has racked America's soul," Bolick
said the government should not be given the
burden of intervening on behalf of or against
citizens of different genders and racial back
grounds.
Paterson countered this view by
presenting herself as a product of
affirmative action. Paterson, who
is black, said that while she met the
qualifications to succeed academi
cally, she needed the benefit of af
firmative action to enter UC-
Berkeley and obtain her law de
gree.
Paterson claimed Proposition
209 could be misconstrued by the
electorate and interpreted as pro
minority because it is worded simi
larly to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
She warned that the passing of
Proposition 209 would bring about
the "virtual devastation" of the
progress that has been made in
California in the area of civil rights.
"This guy is good. He is a bril
liant strategist," said Paterson as
she pointed to Bolick while a trick
le of laughter ran through the au
dience. "We have to learn from
him. This is whv I'm here to listen

to him."
Emphasizing that racial prefer
ences only "cover up problems,"
Bolick said society should not re
distribute opportunities but in
stead increase the number of peo
ple that can compete effectively.
"It has taken us 200 years to
limit the power of government to
discriminate," said Bolick. "Now,
we have the opportunity to elimi
nate it."
Paterson, in contrast, cited dire
predictions for future applicants
of the University of California sys
tem. While 22 out of 270 students
accepted at UC-Berkeley's law
school are African Americans, Pa
terson claimed that the number
woidd be reduced to only three
without affirmative action.
Paterson also made an appeal
to women by highlighting the im
pact that the passage of the propo
sition would have on such issues
as pregnancy leaves.
She ended with the ominous
words: "Devastation lurks around
the corner. This is not a game.
This is real."
