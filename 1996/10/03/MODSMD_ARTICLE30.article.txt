### Crystal Carreon Contributing writer 
A small group Stanford students has joined thou
sands of environmentalists in protesting the controver
sial agreement to preserve ancient redwoods at the
Headwaters Forest.
The Headwaters Forest, located 75 miles south of
the Oregon border, is the world's largest privately
owned old-growth grove. Redwoods there are a re
ported to be 2,000 years old, and the site is regarded as
sacred by many Native American groups.
Charles Hurwitz, chair of Maxxam Inc. (the corpo
rate conglomerate that owns Pacific Lumber Co.,
which in turn owns Headwaters), was set last month
to begin salvage logging of Headwaters Forest to re
move all dead or dying trees.
With the clock ticking, state and federal negotia
tors cut a deal with Hurwitz to preserve part of the
forest.
According to the pact, the government will buy
7,500 acres of Headwaters for $350 million in cash
and land grants. Government officials have offered
Hurwitz nearly 50 properties across the western Unit
ed States, including other national forests and deserts
in California which privy him to various mineral
rights.
"If they do any kind of logging at all, it will damage

the ecosystem," said senior Mikhail Davis. Davis par
ticipated in a rally at the forest last weekend to draw
attention to the issue. "There are no logging regula
tions, especially on private land."
"Headwaters is a national and worldwide gem; there
is nowhere else in the world where you have ancient
redwoods like these," he added.
Overall, Davis said the pact is a"bu m deal." Activists
wanted to preserve 60,000 acres rather than the 7,500
agreed on.
In addition, groups such as the Sierra Club and
Earth First strongly object to the power Hurwitz has
reserved to veto the agreement at any point before it is
finalized.
Davis and a few other Stanford students were also
among 1,000 people arrested at a protest at Headwa
ters on Sept. 15 for illegally trespassing on private
land.
Davis, who grew up near Headwaters, said he has a
genuine interest in preserving the ancient forest.
This weekend, a group from Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford plan to go to Headwa
ters to continue the protest of the Headwaters agree
ment.
Junior Allyson Field was at the rally last weekend.
"It was inspiring to see people who care about the en
vironment and their communities," she said. "The
worst thing is apathy."
