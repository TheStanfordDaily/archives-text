## 'Big Night' director Tucci is getting big-time attention, but will he now go mainstream? An exclusive interview 
### Elisabeth Morse 
"Big Night," a playful film by Stanley Tucci
(co-writer, co-director and lead actor), will
make even the most finicky caters and view
ers hungry. Released by Rysher Productions,
the movie is about two Italian-American
brothers who attempt to open a restaurant on
the New jersey shore sometime during the
19505.
Tucci, who warmly wields a storytelling
ability rarely found in popular cinema these
days, spent 15 minutes talking to me about
the preparations and making of "Big Night,"
a film decidedly in the classic vein. After .1
promising opening, the film seems to be
poised lor success.
"All I know is that the film opened this
weekend, and the numbers are wonderful,"
said Tucci. "Now I never thought that I would
ever use the word 'numbers,' but I'm sure the

. as far as
mainstream stuff
goes, if there's
something
attractive, yeah.
I'd probably do it.
Bufl don't really
know. . .

people who put in the money are very happy."
Tucci, who lived in Florence for a year as a
child and si ill speaks Italian, presented a very
friendly and conversational phone voice.
Though he has no accent, Tucci's intonations
were often distinctly Italian while discussing
everything from food to the American loss of
innocence.
One of the key elements which defined the
personalities ol the film's characters was their
Italian heritage and their continual switching
of languages. Tucci decided when the charac
ters would speak Italian or English with an
Italian accent based on his own background.
"It seemed that because I'm someone who
speaks Italian and grew up with people — my
grandparents — speaking Italian, and there
were very specific times when they would do
so," Tucci said. "It was usually when they

didn't want people to understand what they
were saying, when it was something of a more
intimate nature or sometimes when they
would want to have an impact on the person
they were talking to — to take them out of
one world and bring them into another, and
usually the other world they wanted to bring
them into was something more personal."
One of the stars of "Big Night" is definite
ly the food. Scenes of pasta, risotto and lus
cious vegetables abound. One can practically
smell the cooking while watching the screen.
Despite growing up in a large Italian fam
ily and loving to cook, Tucci trained in a
restaurant on and off for a year to prepare for
his role as a restauranteer.
While there, he "learned how to flip a fri
tata, and I learned how to make the pasta that
they make in an old fashioned way, you know,
everything by hand. I learned how to make a
good risotto, both the quick version and the
slow version. All different things, really. How
to chop things properly."
Like most Italians, Tucci views food as a
means of expressing "a million things, such
as love, caring ... or, you know, there's a sex
uality to it, a sensuality to it, it's everything."
As with any intense relations, his articula
tion 011 his own romance with food is a bit
muddled.
"I love Italian food; of course it's my fa
vorite. But I don't know. I love all kinds of
food. I have no favorite. I wish I did." Unfor
tunately, the food 011 the set of the movie was
mostly stage food, not fit for human con
sumption.
"Big Night'' often addresses themes of the
false and corruptive powers of having to sell
things, from cars to food to life itself. Tucci
had a lot to say about his own experiences in
the financially driven movie industry.
"I know that I want to continue making
movies 011 this scale. I think independent
film is very important, but the lines of inde
pendent film are very blurred," he said. "I
don't even know really what it is so much, I
mean, being independent outside the stu
dios. But then you have all of these 'inde
pendent companies' that are set up. They
will set the same guidelines as studios do
and they will do the same things that studios
do, but they just expect you to do it for less
money.
"So you might as well go make a studio
picture and make some dough and put it in

the bank for your kids."
Tucci, however, does not seem in danger of
producing mindless Hollywood drivel.
"I definitely want to make movies that I
have as much control over as I did over this
one," said Tucci. "But as far as mainstream
stuff goes, if there's something attractive,
yeah, I'd probably do it. But I don't really
know. I know that my heart is in this."
Tucci believes that he got very lucky in
having almost complete control of the film,
which, after it was finished, went directly to
Sundance Film Festival and won an award.
"As soon as it went to Sundance, people

wrote about it and
were praising it, so
after that, you
couldn't do anything
to it because already
people were saying,
'This is so interesting,
this is so different....
The end of the film,
I've never seen an
ending like that.' We
loved it and it made us
feel great, of course —
it made me feel like I
wasn't nuts — but it
also made it so that no

one was able to do anything to it after that.
"A lot of independent films get made and
then people will do a test screening, and then
they will say, The audience didn't react this
way, so we better change this and we better
add that and we better this and we better
that.'"
In the end, Tucci's vision for the film pre
vailed, creating a movie that will make one
laugh, make one cry, make one salivatingly
hungry — movies which will allow us to es
cape the ugliness of our everyday lives.
"I guess it's like I said: Don't be afraid to
trust the people who are making the movie."
