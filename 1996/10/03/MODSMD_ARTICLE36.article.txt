# 'Gitchee' Glorifies Downward Mobility
## Janowitz fashions a white trash fairy tale

Having gotten sick and tired of Holly
wood's formulaic, idyllic portrayals of white
trash families or couples, I never imagined
that I would endeavor to discover a written
version. If you can consume someone's ad

ing lifestyles in less than 100 minutes, why
waste time attempting to read the same mate

sion into the white trash narrative could lure
me more than Ricki Lake and Jenny Jones,
truckers' diners along Interstate 80, Publish

gy calendars in the checkout line in Pay Less.
"By the Shores of Gitchee Gumee" (Crown
Publishers, $23), is one such fictional explo
ration. Written by Tama Janowitz on t he 10-
year anniversary of her cult-creation "Slaves of

New York" — the novel which familiarized us
with the Tama whose name is "trauma with
out the Rand the U" — "Gumee" combines
essential ingredients of the po' white genre
with a healthy dose of hilarity.
While there's more than enough of famil
iar elements like lower standards of health
and cleanliness, hypersexuality, get-rich
quick schemes, child molestation, drug
abuse, convenience-store robbery and
hostage-taking, their flavor is mitigated by the
author's unrelenting sense of humor.
Janowitz weaves a lightweight story of a
young female in pursuit of a lover / husband
to rescue her from the trailer-home dol
drums. At the start of the novel, the "fair,
young maiden" Maud Slivenowicz is con
sumed with the prospect of seduction.
Should it be the part-time vacuum cleaner
salesman, Steve Hartley, who lives down the
street or the new neighbor, the Englishman
(Lord) Simon Halkctt, who has arrived at
1-ake Gitchee Gumee to fix up the rundown

Wolverhampton estate?
Humor, undoubtedly, bears the brunt of
this plot, pervading actions and antagonisms
through and through. A library hostage crisis
accounts for a significant part of the plot.
While a few of the Slivenowicz kids wait for
the "skinny" on the crisis, they decide to get
pizza at a Greek joint run by a convicted child
molester. This frightening interlude turns
comical when Dimitrios allows Theodore,
one of the Slivenowicz brothers, to make his
own pizza. ("Dimitrios said I can have all the
pizza I want any time I come here on my own,
free of charge.") This is absurdity, and not
pathology, at a high point.
The insults exchanged between characters
also extend from clever situational comedy.
When the mother, Evangeline, enlists the help
of the police in the library hostage crisis, she
toys with an old flame in the police station
and pokes fun at his impotency, chomping on
a "Jordan almond" candy. She sings:" 'Jordan
River is deep and wide / Hallelujah / Milk

and honey on the other side / Hallelujah
Would anyone else like a nut?"
Authentically crafted, "Gitchee Gumee
gives the impression of Woody Allen doing ai
18th-century romance novel in a '90s, lias
Coast hickville: ridiculous and smart at th<
same time.
