# YOU THINK YOU KNOW THIS MAN? THINK AGAIN!
## The
						Stanford Tree Bares All in a Candid Talk About Becoming a Tree, Falling from a 40-Foot Cliff, and Why He'll Never Give Up Being the Mascot 
### Story by Samuel Park Photos by Frank Guinan Photo illustrations by Laura Hester 
Everyone knows the wild side of
junior Chris Cary (a.k.a. The
Stanford Tree) — crazy, nutty
and funny. But you're in for a sur
prise. The Stanford Tree is not what
it seems — the man behind the tree
opens up, talking about paganism,
his unconventional childhood and
the surprising reasons why he want
ed to be the Tree.
INTERMISSION: You have a repu
tation for being 11 wacky and crazy
kind of guy. ..
CHRIS CARY: (laughs) I'd say it's
probably true.
I: Are you a nutty guy m everyday
life?
CC: I think I'm pretty sponta
neous. I think most of humor is
you doing what someone else
won't, and I usually end up doing
|what someone else won't|. The

Tree is a
dream of mine.... I grew up idolizing the
Tree. I used to paint myself green and run
around the backyard in the sprinklers and
yell, "I'm watering the Tree. I'm watering the
Tree."
/: How old were you?
CC: Like 7. 6 or 7.
I: I hope you've stopped doing that.
CC: No, I still do. The neighbors think I'm
pretty peculiar.
I: I )<> they send your parents hate mail?
CC: No, but the FBI was investigating our
house for a while, cause they thought the Un
abomber was trying to bomb us, but it was
just our neighbors' (practical joke]. Suburbia
can be a rough place at times.
Junior Chris Bottzon, former Stanford tree
(1995-96), on Cary:
"He doesn't really care about academics, and
that's a great thing to go with I to be the Tree];
he has no problem publicly humiliating him

self, and he likes goats. Not sheep, but goats.
But he doesn't like goats in the way you think
he likes goats."
I: You're from suburbia. Where?
CC: I'm from Stockton, Calif. It's like 1 1/2
hours from here.
/: And you grew up idolizing the Tree.
CC: My dad grew up idolizing Mickey Man
tle; I grew up idolizing Paul Brendan Kelly 111,
one of the first modern Trees.
/: That was in '85?
CC: '85, '86, yeah.
I: What appealed to you about being the live so
much?
CC: I always saw myself as someone with
solid roots, firm grounding in life. It was sort
of a natural extension of this philosophical
... grounding. Being the Tree is sort of a, I
wanna call it zen, hut zen gets so
overused.... It's a spiritual thing, it's a life,
it's a way to live one's life. It's not just a job or
a costume you wear. It's in every pore of your
existence.
I: That sounds like paganism.
CC: Yeah.
I: Are you pagan?
CC: Yeah. I've got a golden calf in my room.
I: Are your parents pagan too?
CC: Yes. Well, actually, one's pagan, one's
Jewish. It was a little hit of a (laughs) weird
growing up. My dad always wanted me to
dress up as Thor for Halloween, and my mom
was always trying to get me to dress up as a
Hasidic Jew. I ended up dressing up as a Ha
sidic Thor, but it never turned out very well.
I'd throw little thunderbolts at theother kids,
but after that, wish them happy Yom Kippur,
50...
I: What would you be dressed like?
CC: My costume somewhat resembled.... I
had this helmet. Thor normally wears a hel
met with horns sticking out, but 1 had a
yarmulke with horns sticking out of it. And
instead of breast armor and leg armor, 1 actu
ally had those little Thora velvet carriers that
people walk around with, strapped around
with Hebrew letters up and down. I fought
for truth, justice and the Hasidic way.
I: People are gonna think we're putting them
on.
CC: (laughs) I think they'd be mistaken. 1
think that once they got to know me, they'd
see that little Hasidic Thor inside of me and
say, Til bet he's telling the truth."

One of the key moments in Gary's process of
becoming the Tree happened early in his
freshman year, during an Orientation trip to
Monterey with his dorm. After playing some
at the beach, Cary saw a "beautiful" cliff and
decided to climb it. Nearing the top, Cary re
alized he had no way of going back down. He
was 40 feet high. After a moment of tension,
watching his horrified dormmates below
wondering how to rescue him, Cary made a
stunning decision. He let go and fell back
wards on the sand. Then he immediately got
up and started dancing around like an alba
tross, and finally sprinted into the ocean. His
dormmates watched in shock.
I: Forty feet?
CC: Well, again, I say, when you become the
Tree, you live the Tree. I think this was the be
ginning of when I knew 1 was going to be the

I'm almost like the student formerly
known as Chris Cary, kind of like
Prince. I'm Tree. People say Chris
Cary and I use it as sort of a
convenient form of identification.

Tree. It was as if I had fallen from a 40-foot
tree and somehow the tree gods protected
me. Again, going back to the pagan thing we
were talking about earlier. I oft sacrificed
weeds, shrubs to tree gods since I was 7 or 8.
Ever since then, I've had protection from
heights.
/: Do you participate in pagan rituals?
CC: Yeah.
I: So when the full moon comes, you're sup
posed to dance on the...
CC: Yeah, that's why l ull Moon on the Quad
actually is such a big event for me every year,
myself and my druid friends. We encircle the
freshmen who are all there and we usually
take three or four of them to ... ahh, I can't
reveal too much, otherwise ...
/; To the woods.
CC: I'll incite the anger ol my fellow druids,
but I'll say that we take them to the woods.
And that's special to me, to be in the woods,
with the trees, and with the freshmen, and
cover them with strudels, and let them go. It's
a remarkably spiritual experience. They
think we're going to sacrifice them, I mean,
but it's kind of a big joke on our part; it's pret
ty funny.

/: Do you have a lot of pagan friends?
CC: Yeah, I do. I'd say we're the silent major
ity. We meet secretly, obviously, and that
dates back to numerous pagan forefathers, il
you will, Thomas Edison, Thomas Dewey,
Karl Marx, all druids. If Stanford tor some
reason passes a no-paganism at Stanford, or
no ritual sacrifices, or a ban on all strudel on
campus, the silent majority would rise. I'd
compare us to the Christian Coalition. Our
influence is unbelievable, though our ranks
are somewhat undefined.
I: All this makes sense to me, but people will
read this, and think ...
CC: If you want me to tell a lie, I'll tell a lie. I'll
lie to the freshmen, I'll lie lo the sophomores,
I'll lie to the juniors, I'll lie to the seniors. I'll
even lie to the administration, but 1 feel as
though, for the Tree's sake, for my sake, for

paganism's sake, that the Stanford public
ought to know what goes on in the mind of a
Tree, or what people perceive to be the Tree, 1
guess.

I: That's you, Chris.
CC: What?
I: Not the Tree. It's you.
CC: Uh-uh. How do you make a
distinction? I am the Tree. I am
Tree.

/: (laughs) Chris!
CC: It's not funny. And stop
calling me Chris. Stop call
ing me Cary.

/: That's your name. That's
who you are.
CC: No. I won't have
it. Next question.

/: OK. 1 see I've
touched a sensitive
area there. So for
you there's no dif
ference between you
and the Tree. You
are one.
CC: That goes hack

to the zen thing 1 was talking about earlier.
Think how ironic it would be to come home
on a dark night, to walk in, have the only light
in your house, you're searching for the inner
light, metaphorically and literally, to click the
switch and not work. That's how I describe
being the Tree. Turning on that inner light
and having it not work.
I: So you're the person coming home in the
dark?
CC: You're making some separation between
me and the Tree. When you say you, I want
you to think in your mind, the Tree-slash-
Chris Gary. I mean, I'm almost like the stu
dent formerly known as Chris Cary, kind ot
like Prince. I'm Free. People say Chris ( ary,
and I use it as sort of a convenient form of
identification, I guess, just because I don't
know how many students would understand
this light metaphor I 've alluded to earlier.
I: Let me put myself in my readers' shoes. For
them to read this, it might he confusing.
CC: L.et me offer another analogy. There's a
great Beatles song called "1 Am the Walrus." It
someone asks me, "Are you Chris (.'arv or are
you the Tree?" I would say, "I am the eggman,
I am the Walrus, goo goo gajoob.' And I think

that explains it
perfect.
(I aug h s)

Goo goo
gajoob, in
big let
ters!

I: I've been told that your great-uncle on your
father's side was an arborist ami an influence
in your wanting to be the Tree.
(C: 1 would say him as well as (ius | his neigh
bor] were the two people who motivated me
to reali/e, 1 guess what was inside me all
along, that 1 was the Iree. He used to, ah. . .
This i> gonna sound probably rather sick and
incestuous to some of your readers, but my
uncle used to take me down to the basement
and he would bury me up to my head in dirt
and slap me across the face with cooked cab
bage, yelling,"(loo goo gajoob
I: What w as the point ot that?
CC: 1 don't know. There's some debate in m\
family as to what was the point of that.
i pause) 1 like to think he was preparing me
for, in sort of an allegorical way. for the in
sults of life. I think life flings a lot of bad stuff
at you, symbolized bv the cooked cabbage,
and you can react to it in two ways you can
get pissed off and spend your whole lite seek
ing vengeance and being bitter at people, or
you can have a good time. My dad iust thinks
that my great-uncle was a sick and perverted
man.
I: What did you think at the time?
CC: I was 7 years old. As far as I knew, even
one's great uncles did that to them. Ihe
training and the preparation that goes into
becoming a tree often isn't pretty. I'm sure it
an Olympic athlete like Michael Johnson ex
plained his training regimen to the normal
everyday |oe Blow that he would think he was
crazy. By explaining this to the Stanford pub
lic, I'm running the risk ot letting people
think I'm crazy, but for me being the Tree is
like winning the 200 and the 400 and ham
mer throw, all in one shot.

I: What happens when you haw to give up
being the Tree?
CC: That's a touchy issue for inc. They sa\
I'm gonna have to give it up. Right now I'm
stockpiling weapons in a little presidio
down in Monterey lor a guerrilla assault
on the Band. Hopefully it it's a success, the
Band will he under martial law and I'll

get a second year. It II be a bloody con
tlict.... That's the only way I can con von
to you the grave seriousness ot this
whole episode. In addition to taking
