# The
						history of the mascot
## 
### 
Believe it or not, the Tree was not always
Stanford's mascot. In fact, it still isn't. Tne
Tree is only the mascot of the Band. (Con
fused? It gets worse.) Before there was the
Tree, there was the Indian. But political
correctness made the Indian a controver
sial choice for a mascot, and he was even
tually dropped in 1971, opening the way for
suggestions for a new mascot.
one at the University could come up
with a mascot that was acceptable to all,'

remembers Alex Jardetzky, Band manager
during the 1977-78 season. "The Band said
it would unveil a mascot at Big Game that
had won a mock mascot selection contest.
The most notable entry in the contest at
the time was a large Banana Slug."
The mascot, unveiled at halftime, was
the Tree. According to Jardetzsky, it was
inspired by the emolem on the side of all
the Stanford utility trucks â€” the emblem
features a seal witn the "El Palo Alto" (tall

tree in Spanish) redwood at the center.
Rick Pam, now a lab manager in the
Physics Department, was in the Band at the
time when they decided on having a tree for
a mascot.
"The concept was instantly recog
nized as a paradigm-shifting stroke of
pure genius, on a par with special rel
ativity and the invention of Liquid
Paper," said Pam. "Bedlam ensued,
and the rest is herstory."

The first Trees were always the Band
managers' girlfriends, according to former
tree Chris Bonzon, a junior. They painted
themselves green, wore leaves and ran
around with tne Band at football games.
Things changed in 1985, when tryouts
were held for the first time. By coinci
dence, all the Trees since then have been
male. Although the Tree is not the school's
official mascot, it is widely accepted as
such.
