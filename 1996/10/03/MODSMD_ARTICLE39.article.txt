## SOUL COUGHING "IRRESISTIBLE BLISS" 
### 
Cartoon noises, thick bass lines that pop
like molasses bombs, sharp bursts of mum
bling guitar and a nasal white guy spouting
spastic beat poetry. What the hell is this
racket, anyway?
It's Soul Coughing, of course, a four
piece band from New York (drums, upright
bass, keyboard / sampler and guitar) that
twists jazz into a rock context, setting neu
rotic sentiments to heavy, cool grooves.
Soul Coughing can be sometimes sensitive
and dreamy, other times suffocatingly
creepy and just plain weird the rest of the
time.
Soul Coughing's first album, "Ruby
Vroom," was packed full of self-consciously
goofy sounds and words, but some songs
tried to maintain a groove longer than was
necessary. On their new album, "Irresistible
Bliss," Soul Coughing's songs are tighter and
more streamlined, as well as a little darker
and more paranoid. "Super Bon Bon" and
"White Girl" are propelled by scary, clatter
ing noises and front man M. Doughty's ur
gent growls; twangy spy guitar adds a noir
feeling to the dark, jerky feel of "Collapse."
Of course, Soul Coughing can still sing a
loony tune, as in "Disseminated," based on
a swinging Raymond Scott sample, and the
Schoolhouse Rock-ish "4 out of 5." On the
poppier songs, Doughty muses dreamily
about girls and summer afternoons ("Soft
Serve," "Soundtrack To Mary"), but he's the
type of person to always end up yearning
and lonely ("How Many Cans?").
The sludgy, mean "Paint" and the inter
minably slow, sparse "Sleepless" are exam
ples ol Doughty's predilection for repeating

phrases over and over until they become
some sort of post-modern mantra. Some
times his gimmicky catch phrases work,
and sometimes they don't. It's a chance
Soul Coughing takes, and for the most part,
it pays off.
"Irresistible Bliss" is an apt name for this
album; you may initially resist Soul Cough
ing's continued tendency to stretch out
their songs in the interest of keeping the
groove going, but with repeated listenings
you'll notice the bliss beneath the sound
and fury.
