## ASSU donates vans to Haas

Students gathering at the Haas
Center for Public Service for com
munity service projects will find two
new Plymouth Voyagers at their dis
posal.
The unprecedented gift of the two
mini-vans from the ASSU to the
Haas Center is expected to reduce
the inconvenience and costs involved
in transporting volunteers to com
munity service projects.
According to ASSU Financial
Manager Johii Hall, the gift is signif
icant, as it will save community ser
vice groups the expense of renting
vehicles. It will also mark the first
time the ASSU has made a substan
tial contribution to the center.
"We're delighted with the
ASSU's generosity," said Sue Gray,

community partnerships coordina
tor at the center. "They saw a need
and took the lead in responding to it."
The funding for the vans came
from ASSU Program Board re
serves.
The donation is the result of in
formal discussions between the cen
ter and other campus groups about
the difficulties of transporting volun
teers to programs as far away as San
Francisco and San Jose.
"We don't want them to worry
about fund raising," ASSU Presi
dent Bill Shen said. "We want to
make sure that groups are focused
on doing what they do best â€” in this
case, community service."
The center will be lending the
vans to various campus groups for a
small fee. First priority for van usage
will go to community service organi

zations that previously requested
transportation funding from the
ASSU. The vans will also be avail
able for use by other Haas Center or
ganizations and student groups.
Both ASSU and Haas Center offi
cials anticipate that the two vans will
not be able to meet the needs of all of
the service groups. "We have set up a
\' >ble system to give priority to com
munity service groups, and we hope
that it makes a substantial dent,"
said Suzanne Abel-Vidor, director of
development and external relations
for the center
However, both the ASSU and the
center stressed that this is an experi
mental program, and the impact of
the new vans will take a full year to
evaluate. They indicated that thev
will continue to listen carefully to
needs of community service groups to
serve them as effectively as possible.
The vans, which will begin serving
groups in the next few weeks, are ex
pected to save service groups and the
ASSU $18,000 to $20,000 over the
next several years, Hall said.
