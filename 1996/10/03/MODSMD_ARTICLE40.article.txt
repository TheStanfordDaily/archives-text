# ZZ TOP
## "RHYTHMEEN" 
### 
Many, many years ago, ZZ Top was a rel
atively unimpressive and unknown boogie
band from Texas. After discovering a gim
mick, synthesizers and M TV, the rest is his
tory.
However, ZZ Top had been steeped in
the Texan blues tradition, ranging from
Hobby "Blue" Bland to Junior Parker,
meaning that the band's instincts were as
alien to the '80s video age as synthesizers
were to the blues.
Nevertheless, ZZ Top proved quite will
ing to ride their cartoon eccentricity to su
perstardom, as if they were bearded aliens
from another world. If the trio had a storied
past, one could accuse them of "selling
out," but in the cultural vacuum of the '80s,
any roots were better than none.
Now that MTV' has moved from slick
ness to "authenticity," ZZ Top has been left
out in the cold, and their response is the as
sertively bluesy new album "Rhythmeen."
As a whole, the work is an impressive re

turn to their roots. While still maintaining
their own specific style of humor (as on
"Zipper Job" and "Hairdresser"), the band
plays some dirty, dirty blues.
Employing smoky guitar tones and caus
tic rhythms, the album delivers dense satis
faction. At its best, such as on the title track,
the band is a blur of metal and fuzz.
With "What's Up With That," the trio
stings a fairly traditional blues form, and on
the album's strongest track, "My Mind Is
Gone," the groups rides a powerful riff into
anthem territory, to impressive results.
However, the album's smoky atmos
phere, which provides some of its best mo
ments, might also be its greatest weakness.
The album can quickly become a blur of
darkness and sparks, suggesting that a little
of the old ZZ Top glitter could have put the
album over the top.
As it stands, "Rhythmeen" is more sig
nificant as a statement than as an album:
that ZZ Top were more than just cartoons
and that they never lost the blues.

One of the members of Soul Coughing thanks Claire Danes in the liner notes and
tells her to call him. Is that endearing or creepy?
