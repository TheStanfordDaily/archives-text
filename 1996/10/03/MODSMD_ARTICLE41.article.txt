## "TEST FOR ECHO" 
### 
Rush's latest album, "Test for Echo," is a
wake-up call to our segregated, discontent
ed, workaday society.
Since 1968, Rush's progressive style of
music has earned these Canadian high
school dropouts a worldwide fan following
that has resulted in numerous multiplat
inum albums. While Rush is always recog
nizable by their unique sound, much of the
band's success can be attributed to the pro
found lyrics composed by drummer Neil
Peart. Arguably one of the world's best
drummers, Peart consistently imbues the
group's albums with commentary on soci
etal wrongs.

This time around, the album's title song
expresses disgust with the disintegration of
our society: "Can't do the time? Don't do
the crime." A track entitled "Half the
World" comments on the growing disparity
between the rich and the poor, as well as our
ever-present disillusionment with reality:
"Half the world tries to be the other half."
While expressing dissatisfaction with the
outside world, "Test for Echo" also reveals
Rush's continuous search for self-identity
and their struggle with "what is right."
Tackling the issues of righteousness and
sense of purpose, Rush reaches out to the
listener in hopes of sparking millions of
echoes to its timely message.
As the band members move into middle
age, their lyrics seem to reflect their coping
with a faster-moving electronic world. A
shipwreck featured as the background for
the lyrics of "Virtuality" illustrates the im
personal nature of the Internet and the so
ciety it represents.
Taking the place of "The Red Barchetta,"
a classic track about the freedom of a car
ride in the country, are songs such as "Dog
Years" that confess, "I'd rather be a tortoise
from Galapagos or a span of geological time
than be living in these dog years." The evil
priests of the Temple of Syrinx that plagued
Rush's "2112" album have apparently "as
sumed control" of our planet as well.
Although the lyrics of "Test for Echo"
live up to the high standards that Rush has
set over the years, the originality of music
on the album leaves something to be de
sired. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, Rush's
lead vocalist and guitarist, respectively,
struggle to keep up with Heart's bold, non
rhyming lyrics. Void of Peart's famous
drum solos (such as "XYZ"), or the amaz
ing guitar work of "Spirit of the Radio,"
the songs in "Test for Echo" reek of
grunge, are repetitive in style and fall short
of displaying the wide spectrum of Rush's
artistic talent.
"Test for Echo" is not a CD to dance to at
