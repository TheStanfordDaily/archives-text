# THE
						GRASSY KNOLL
## "POSITIVE" 
### 
A listening buddy astutely remarked that
he couldn't tell whether one would be more
likely to hear the Grassy Knoll's "Positive"
blasted out of the Enchanted Broccoli Forest
or in Bondage-A-GoGo. The CI), a combina
tion of acid jazz and funk with a few industri
al-ish highlights thrown in, is definitely am
biguous.
The Grassy Knoll's CD "Positive" comes
in an opaque blue case with a hospital-style
cross decal on the front; on the back, a photo
of a boy dancing, the same cross painted
white on his dark hair. The inside, along with
a song list including such sensually gratifying
titles as "Black Helicopters," "Driving
Nowhere" and "Slow Steady Salvation," ex
claims "BE RELENTLESS."
All in all, most intriguing.
At its low points, "Positive" sounds like
something an amateurish campus band
might produce. Its often repetitive and vocal
ist-less songs easily degenerate into a boring
listening experience.
"Slow Steady Salvation" is a horny song
(Where is your mind? 1 meant trumpets and
saxes.) which just goes on and on.
"Roswell Crash" is better. Though it fails
to invoke images of burning aliens, it's a
catchy tune.
"Positive" is at its best with songs such as
the evocative "Driving Nowhere," which
smoothly conjured spies crawling through
the Capitol Building at night with night-vi
sion goggles on.
But, with titles such as "Another Theory"
and "End Of It All" (the last track), perhaps
the Grassy Knoll should be commended as
much for the wit of their appearance as for
their movie-tracked music.
