# CAKE
## "FASHION NUGGET" 
### 
The first thing you noticc about Cake is
that unlike most of the current crop of "mod
ern-rock" bands, they don't attempt to over
power with loud guitars or swaggering atti
tudes. It's partially due to the band's distinct
production values; instead of the instrumen
tation blurring into a formless mass, each in
strument (guitar, bass, trumpet and occasion
al organ) can be heard clearly and sharply.
In a way, Cake has revived the lost art of
"ensemble playing"; you can hear that the
members of Cake are actually playing along
with one another. This is especially surprising
when you consider the breadth of musical
styles that Cake tosses into the mix. Wry vo
cals rub against moody trumpet lines; funk
bass clashes with country-style finger picking.
No one style comes across strongly enough
for Cake to be slapped with some easy music
critic label.
Their new album "Fashion Nugget" ap

pears on the surface to be the product of a
dancy college-campus party band, but there's
a more ominous element to them that pre
vents them from being so. "The Distance,"
Cakes first single, has a dirty 311-ish guitar
riff, a shout-along chorus and a whiny
theremin-like sample (think Dr. Dre), but the
song tells the story of a rather pathetic race
car driver who insists on circling the track
long after the race is over.
Cake's main virtue is their unwillingness
to be tied down to any one genre. What can
you concretely say about a band that covers
the Gloria Gaynor disco classic "I Will Sur
vive" as well as Willie Nelson's "Sad Songs
And Waltzes"? "Stickshifts and Safetybelts"
rolls along in a country-twang manner, "Per
haps, Perhaps, Perhaps" alternates between a
tango and an exotica-lounge groove, and
"Open Book" lurches merrily, apparently
about to fall apart at any moment.
Barely anything is straightforward about
Cake; they probably know what they're real
ly doing, but they're not telling. Instead of
appealing directly to the listener's tastes,
"Fashion Nugget" is infectious in a sublimi
nal, underhanded manner.
