# JOHN PARISH AND POLLY JEAN HARVEY
## "DANCE HALL AT LOUSE POINT" 
### 
Polly Jean Harvey's latest release is more
of a side-project than a new effort. A col
laboration with guitarist John Parish,
"Dance Hall At Louse Point," gives her the

chance to flesh out the vampy stage per
sona introduced on tour in support of
1995's critically acclaimed "To Bring You
My Love." Harvey, who contributed vocals
and lyrics, gets second billing to Parish,
who wrote and performed the album's
music, but there are enough trademark
"Darlings," "Oh Lovers" and man-eating
moans to ensure that she steals the show.
This is not to say that Parish isn't up to
the task of playing opposite Harvey. He
opens the album casually with "Girl" — 90
seconds of atmospheric guitar noodling
over which Harvey innocently warbles —
and easily shifts into a variety of love-gone
wrong songs, such as the stunning and
largely acoustic " That Was My Veil" and
"Rope Bridge Crossing," a song whose la/v
crunch dictates Harvey's spoken
verse / soaring chorus delivery.
Throughout "Dance Hall At Louse
Point's" 12 tracks — some hits, some miss
es — Parish creates soundtracks equal to
Harvey's more cinematic portraits, which
range from edgy thrillers to full-on horror
movie stuff. "Civil War Correspondent"
shimmies along morbidly until Harvey be
gins to sing, at which point the music is
stripped bare enough to reveal the insecu
rity of lines like "Words leave my heart
dry."
The frightening "laut" revels in black
humor and an urgent guitar riff before
Harvey sputters "Even the son of God had
to die, my darling," and the music erupts
into a dissonant, forceful chorus of "Jesus
save me."
Parish's music at times flirts with ca
cophony. He refuses to bring it all neatly to
gether, leaving the listener stranded be
tween possibility and reality. Harvey takes
full advantage of this special effect, shout
ing across the distance in a theatrical and

often successful effort to connect the two
worlds. Timid, broken-hearted lovers be
come shrieking goddesses; needy souls end
up celebrating their freedom; and declara
tions of immortality morph into sexual de
mands — all to the tune of spooky organs,
sporadic percussion and wailing guitars.
On the down side, "Dance Hall At Louse
Point" was recorded in less than a month, a
fact that accounts for the album's sense of
effortlessness and the wasted, throwaway
feel of some songs. Even the album's
strongest tracks sound like leftovers from
"To Bring You My Love" — nothing really
new, but certainly nothing to complain
about, either.
