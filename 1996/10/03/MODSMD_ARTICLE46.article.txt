## 'Bound' for Trouble Brilliant noir questions gender construction and socialization 
### 
Imagine the pitch for the movie "Bound."
A pair of poor writers slink into two empty
seats. In their minds, a great idea but in their
pockets, meager wallets. Looking at the he
suited movie baron, they begin, "It's a mob
picture with two protagonists, except in our
version there's no DeNiro and no Pesci. In
stead it's a couple, a lesbian couple."
Where's the payoff in that investment? It
seems obvious to me — add a novel and in
genious twist to a polished cinematic genre,
support it with a dramatically curvaceous
plot and two directors who obviously appre
ciate patient 1 litchcockian suspense and peo
ple will pay to watch.
"Bound" traces two women, played by
Jennifer Tilly ("Bullets over Broadway") and
Gina Gershon ( "Showgirls"), as they attempt
to purloin money from the Marzzone family
of(Chicago. Violet (Tilly), a Mafia homemak
er, begins the film discontent with her
lifestyle of trading luxury lor services ren
dered. Fortuitously, the Mar/zones hire a fe
male ex-con, Corky (Gershon), which allows
the women to form a tenuously volatile rela
tionship. When Violet's boyfriend, Caesar

(Joe Pantoliano), brutally repatriates Marz
zone family funds, the couple devises an in
tricate plan to steal the cash, simultaneously
framing Caesar.
The film questions the strength of the les
bian relationship by using the heist as a de
vice. The film genre tricks the audience into
viewing the women as criminals, as well as
lovers, capable of double-crossing each other.
Brilliant depictions of violence place the
women in situations where selfishly aban
doning the scheme obviously benefits one out
of the two women; usually by escaping physi
cal harm (with the money) and leaving the
other in it. The women are bound merely by
romantic commitment to each other.
"Bound" is fueled by crazed, "Shallow
Grave"-like plot kinks. The film is an incred
ible directorial debut for the Wachowski
brothers, Andy and Larry, who successfully
create sheering suspense by manipulating
slow-motion cinematography, point-of
view shots and flash forwards. Disguised
within the drama, the intentional bending of
the Mafia genre intelligently questions film's
role in gender construction and socializa
tion, an issue partly addressed by the uncon
ventional close.
