# The
						Young and the Morbid
## Two lovers find out what it takes to get 'Curdled' 
### 
Never, ever, ever make assumptions about a
movie if you haven't seen the preview. Going
into "Curdled," I knew nothing more than that
its executive producer was Quentin Tarantino
and that Billy Baldwin played one of the leading
parts. "Fantastic," I thought wearily, "another
star vehicle for the overpublicized and preten
tious."
The opening credits clued me in: cartoon
drawings of violent deaths framing newspaper
articles which detailed various gruesome
demises — beheaded, eaten by sharks, stabbed
repeatedly.
Now, one may be wondering if this isn't al
ready typical Tarantino fare: How many auto
matic machine gun massacres will there be?
But the most one sees of our friend Quentin
is a cameo picture of him as a rapist / murderer
amid a false news program. "Curdled" is an ex
tremely gory film, but it lacks the in-your-face
brutality and finesse of a real Tarantino pro
duction. Instead of feeding the viewer so much
violence that one becomes desensitized, the
film tries to couch its blood in humor.
The plot is a bit thin on substance. Gabriela
(Angela Jones), a beautiful South American liv
ing in Miami, is fascinated by unnatural death

to the point of obsession. As a child, Gabriela
witnesses a man being pushed off a building.
For the rest of the film, one continually won
ders if the script was an improv session gone
gruesome while one watches the consequences
of Gabriela's morbid curiosity.
Paul (Baldwin) is the typical blue-eyed,
suave-hungry barman-serial killer who seduces
society women, then slices off their heads with
a sword. Once Gabriela gets a job with a clean
ing company that specializes in removing the
traces of death and murder, the only suspense
lies in how long it will take this twisted duo to
meet.
"Curdled" has its amusing points: a shot of
Paul smoking a cigarette after a kill interspersed
with a shot of Gabriela cutting the head off of a
gingerbread man and eating it.
I must admit that 1 laughed (or rather, snick
ered) frequently throughout the film. But 1 have
a pretty sick sense of humor and take pleasure
from things a lot of normal human beings
would find either demented or just not that
funny.
"Curdled" trods through a scenario that is
somewhat novel but cannot really support an
entire film. Despite some fresh moments, one
feels by the end that the hour-and-a-half movie
was way past its expiration date.
