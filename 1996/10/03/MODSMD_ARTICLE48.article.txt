## FILM '2 Days' Too Much Tarantinoproduced film too self-conscious 
### 
The vision: a riveting film of coincidcnce
that intertwines the lives of 10 random peo
ple within a time frame of 48 hours. It begins
with a murder in the San Fernando Valley.
The product: a Tarantino-esque piece that
just doesn't match up to "Pulp Fiction." "2
Days in the Valley" is teeming with casual
murders and fateful encounters between the
characters. Writer and director John Herzfeld
tries too hard and comes out with a film that
is too self-conscious about its attempt at off
beat coincidence and humor. The entire pro
duction is too neady packaged, with a form of
poetic justice wrapping up everyone's lives.
Characters who the audience would love

to kill off die; likewise, those who moviegoers
are more willing to forgive are blessed with
happy endings.
Teri Hatcher turns in a good performance,
even though it is a bit disorienting to see Lois
Lane swear on the big screcn. However, her
all-Amcrican girl image still carries through
and she provides a great contrast to the vil
lainess in the movie: a taller and blonder
femme fatale played by Charlize Theron. But
this Marianne and Ginger stereotype doesn't
do much for enhancing female roles in the
movie business. Both women are in disgust
ingly good shape and sport enough Spandex
in two hours to outfit an entire team of aero
bics instructors.
However, there are many quality comedic
performances that are very enjoyable. Greg
Cruttwell and Danny Aiello contribute im
mensely to the movie and give glory to their
"loser" characters. James Spader plays it cool
and kills with elegance each time. Story-line
twists and turns won't exactly keep audiences
on the edge of their seats, but will keep peo
ple entertained nonetheless.
Subtle Southern Californian jokes abound
and will amuse those familiar with the area
but escape those who live in areas that don't
have such good weather. For instance, in a
scene set in a hotel, strange noises generated
by a cat fight upstairs elicits a remark from the
man in the room below along the lines of, "I
guess that's how the people in Tarzana do it."

Overall, the film moves a bit slowly but
satisfies minimal requirements to entertain
moviegoers in the mood for a mellow movie
that happens to feature a lot of killing.
