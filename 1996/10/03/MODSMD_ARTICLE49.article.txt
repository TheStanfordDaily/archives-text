# Oedipus Deux
## Family gets 'Caught' in Web of Desire 
### 
"Caught" is the latest incest flick to hit
the screens. The story twists the Oedipus
tale to include two sons, one natural and one
adopted, and explores the warring forces of
filial affection and lust. Directed by Robert
Young, the film is shot with workmanlike
cinematography and balances the perspec
tives of the mother, the father and the two
"sons."
The movie begins with the young va

grant Nick (Arie Verbeen) bursting into a
Jersey fish store owned by Joe (Edward
James Olmos) and Maria (Maria Conchita
Alonso). Maria quickly seizes on Nick,
inviting him home to stay in the empty
room left by their son Danny (Steven
Schub), who's chasing a comedy career in
Hollywood. Nick takes a job as Joe's helper
and learns the craft of fish-cleaning, while
slowly being drawn by Maria's magnetic
sexuality.
Tensions mount as Danny returns home
one day to find Nick in his room and Maria's
panties on his bed. Danny's return precipi
tates the dissolution of the family as the
movie plods towards the inevitable conclu
sion.
The movie is curiously one-dimensional.
The characters are well-acted but uninterest
ing, and the camera work adds no new per
spective to the story. The narrative is jejune
and in the absence of dramatic fillips fails to
ever achieve any sort of momentum. Part of
the problem may stem from the dominance
of incest as a theme in recent films and litera
ture. Young originally began work on the film
23 years ago; had it come out then its effect
would likely have been incendiary. As it is, be
tween "Spanking the Monkey" and"The Ce
ment Garden," the film tramps over familiar
ground while bringing nothing new to the
landscape.
