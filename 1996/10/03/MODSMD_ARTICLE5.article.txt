Prof. Emeritus Gerald Went
worth, who spent more than 20 years
as a student and professor in account
ing at the Graduate School of Busi
ness, died Monday in his Cupertino
home at the age of 86.
Wentworth was born in Great
Falls, Mont., in 1909. He earned his
bachelor's degree in accounting from
Montana State College in 1931 and
later owned and operated a cafeteria.

He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1942, soon after
getting married. Wentworth was stationed in the
South Pacific and served in a troop carrier group and
also as an intelligence officer in the Civil Air Patrol.
He left the service in 1946 with no noticeable
wounds except a distaste for hunting, which no longer
seemed fair to him, according to his son, Daniel.
Wentworth then returned to his wife, Elliott, and
spent more than a year living in a cabin on a dirt road
deep in the Rocky Mountains.
The Wentworths sold the cafeteria, which Elliott
had been managing during the war, and moved to New-


Wentworth
