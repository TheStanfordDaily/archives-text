### Joe Westersund Contributing writer 
Prof. Emeritus Gerald Went
worth, who spent more than 20 years
as a student and professor in account
ing at the Graduate School of Busi
ness, died Monday in his Cupertino
home at the age of 86.
Wentworth was born in Great
Falls, Mont., in 1909. He earned his
bachelor's degree in accounting from
Montana State College in 1931 and
later owned and operated a cafeteria.

He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1942, soon after
getting married. Wentworth was stationed in the
South Pacific and served in a troop carrier group and
also as an intelligence officer in the Civil Air Patrol.
He left the service in 1946 with no noticeable
wounds except a distaste for hunting, which no longer
seemed fair to him, according to his son, Daniel.
Wentworth then returned to his wife, Elliott, and
spent more than a year living in a cabin on a dirt road
deep in the Rocky Mountains.
The Wentworths sold the cafeteria, which Elliott
had been managing during the war, and moved to New-


Wentworth
castle, Calif., where they lived in a
cherry orchard.
Wentworth later came to Stan
ford to get his teaching credential
and earned his master's degree in
accounting from the Business
School in 1953. The next year he be
came a research associate and also a

father, when Daniel was born.
Wentworth received his doctorate
in 1960.
Daniel remembers him fondly as
having "raised me to believe that I
could do whatever I wanted" and as
someone who didn't pressure him
to follow the same career path as his
father.
Wentworth was often involved
in projects overseas. Business
School Prof. Emeritus Thomas
Harrell remarked that he would

have made a good foreign represen
tative because of all the foreign vis
itors he hosted.
Wentworth served as director of
the Iran Management Seminar in
Tehran and taught accounting at
the Australian School of Manage
ment. His family later moved to
Lima, Peru, when Stanford began
the first business graduate school
in South America.
Wentworth lived in Peru for two
years, even staying through a mili

tary junta. He served as the last
American dean of the school from
1968 to 1970, when the school was
handed over fully to Peruvian offi
cials. Wentworth retired from
teaching in 1973.
He was someone who quite liter
ally liked to "take roads less trav
eled," Daniel Wentworth said. In re
tirement, Wentworth was fond of car
trips through the Rocky Mountain
states and later the Southwest, al
ways trying to find a new back road.
