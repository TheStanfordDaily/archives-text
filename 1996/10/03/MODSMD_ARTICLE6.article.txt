## Three vendors eye Tresidder 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
Three juice bars seeking a spot in
Tresidder Union made presenta
tions to the Tresidder Advisory
Board yesterday.
Jamba Juice, the parent compa
ny of Juice Club, was among the
vendors selected from a group of 10
that submitted bids to present to
the board. Juice It and Odwalla also
gave presentations.
University officials expect to sign
a lease with one of the juice drink
vendors by Nov. 15 and open the
store by late spring quarter, accord
ing to Dean of Students Marc Wais.
Four of the 10 original bidders
were invited to give presentations
about their plans for the space cur
rently occupied by Stanford Hair
styling. One vendor withdrew its
bid.
Based on the meeting yesterday,

members of the board will discuss
the options and then make a recom
mendation to Wais. The Stanford
Management Co., which oversees
lease agreements in Tresidder, will
then negotiate with the chosen ven-

dor.
The board has
yet to make its se
lection. "We
looked at the
three vendors,
and we are mov
ing forward in the
negotiations,"
Wais said.
Each vendor
delivered its pre-

sentation in separate rooms on
Tresidder's second floor as board
members "rotated from room to
room," Wais said. One of the more
elaborate setups included bamboo
