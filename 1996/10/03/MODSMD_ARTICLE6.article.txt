# Juice boost
## Three vendors eye Tresidder 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
Three juice bars seeking a spot in
Tresidder Union made presenta
tions to the Tresidder Advisory
Board yesterday.
Jamba Juice, the parent compa
ny of Juice Club, was among the
vendors selected from a group of 10
that submitted bids to present to
the board. Juice It and Odwalla also
gave presentations.
University officials expect to sign
a lease with one of the juice drink
vendors by Nov. 15 and open the
store by late spring quarter, accord
ing to Dean of Students Marc Wais.
Four of the 10 original bidders
were invited to give presentations
about their plans for the space cur
rently occupied by Stanford Hair
styling. One vendor withdrew its
bid.
Based on the meeting yesterday,

members of the board will discuss
the options and then make a recom
mendation to Wais. The Stanford
Management Co., which oversees
lease agreements in Tresidder, will
then negotiate with the chosen ven-

dor.
The board has
yet to make its se
lection. "We
looked at the
three vendors,
and we are mov
ing forward in the
negotiations,"
Wais said.
Each vendor
delivered its pre-

sentation in separate rooms on
Tresidder's second floor as board
members "rotated from room to
room," Wais said. One of the more
elaborate setups included bamboo


Wais
trees.
Presentations on product quali
ty included explanations of how
vendors make their juices, get their
fruit and develop their additives.
There were many "interesting Cali
fornia terms" used to describe the
additives, Wais said.
According to Wais, the selection
of a vendor will be based on factors
such as hours of operation, menu,
financial stability and floor plans.
The chosen juice vendor will be
retrofitting the current site of the
barber shop to fit its needs.

"Foremost, we're addressing
student concerns," said senior
Kevin Barenblat, chair of the board.
"First among those are taste, prod
uct quality and pricing."
Secondary concerns involve ven
dor enthusiasm about "being part
of Stanford and Tresidder," Wais
said. In their presentations, ven
dors expressed strong commitment
to the Stanford community.
The Juice Club-type establish
ment is just the latest endeavor in a
series of improvements being made
to Tresidder. Polio's restaurant, a
Mexican fast-food chain, is tenta
tively scheduled to open Nov. 9.
According to Wais, the Universi
ty has just signed a long-term lease
with Tresidder Express, which had

been leasing its space on a month
to-month basis for the past year.
VVais said he believes the campus
will see some physical improve
ments completed now.
New lighting in the cafeteria
area is now completely installed. Ac
cording to Wais, the Bon Appetit
area will have completely new furni
ture and carpeting by Nov. 1. The
food management company may
need to close down in the evenings,
but renovations will be done with
"minimum disruption," Wais said.
"We hope Tresidder will become
much more lively with the opening
of Polio's and the juice center," said
Barenblat. "We hope students will
frequent and just hang out in
Tresidder more often."
