# Tutoring system revised at CTL
## 
### Therese Lee Contributing writer 
Reflecting the pressures of a
tightening budget and high stu
dent demand, the Center for
Teaching and Learning has re
vamped its tutoring system this
year.
The center has reorganized its
drop-in tutoring programs and
eliminated individual tutoring in
several of the more popular sub
jects.
Drop-in tutoring involves no as
signed instruction, and tutors help
whomever arrives at their tutoring
sites.
According to Tutoring Coordi
nator Phyllis Frus, the change al
lows the center to be more flexible
and reach more students.
Last spring, the center submit
ted a proposal for the new tutoring

program to the President's Office.
Several things made the changes
necessary, said Jack Prostko, the
center's associate director.
"Our budget was cut several
years ago," he said. "We were no
longer able to provide individual tu
tors to all the students who re
quested it. The budget could no
longer handle it."
The old program limited the
center's capacity for outreach, said
Frus. Students were often put on a
waiting list, and each student was
allowed to have only one tutor.
However, students often needed
help in more than one subject, said
Frus.
Although the center served
about 1,500 to 2,000 students dur
ing the last school year, Frus said
the center still wants to reach a
larger number.
Figures from the center showed
that about one-third of the stu
dents helped last year were part of
the drop-in tutoring program at
Meyer Library.
The new tutoring system fea
tures 14 drop-in tutoring centers
around campus, many of which are
located in dorm residences. The tu
tors there were unpaid residence
tutors who only helped those who
lived in their dorms. The revised
program incorporates the tutors
into the system and pays them for
the tutoring service.
"Our philosophy is that we want
to turn the tutoring program into a
residential-based intellectual sup
port system," said Frus.
Also, new additions to the cen
ter's World Wide Web site are set

to provide students with ready ac
cess to information they need to
find the appropriate tutor. The
center will offer drop-in tutoring
for chemistry, math, biology,
physics and economics. Subjects
will have individual pages on the
Web site, where students can see a
schedule of tutoring offered for
the entire week.
"The online schedule is available
at all times," Fins said. "It's not the
same as 24-hour tutoring, but at
least you know when you can get
some time with a tutor. We
shouldn't have to turn anybody
away. That's the idea."
Individual tutors will no longer
be offered for these subjects.
"The only exceptions we're
making to the rule is if [the stu
dent] has been referred to us by the
Disabilities Resource Center,"
Prostko said. "The system is set up
as a collection of drop-in centers,
and we want to see how that
works."

Despite this change, senior Josh
Meezan, a biology and chemistry
tutor for the center, said he believes
the quality of attention students
get will not decline.
"Overall, it's going to be an im
provement because tutor availabil
ity will go way up," he said. "Indi
vidual tutoring is an inefficient use
of the tutor's time."
The advantage of the new sys
tem lies with its flexibility, said
Frus. If a tutoring session becomes
too crowded, the center will simply
move tutors around and adjust, she
said.
"It's very flexible," she added.
"We can change it every week if we
have to."
Individual tutors will still be as
signed for writing and foreign lan
guages. The center is also looking
into providing assistance in the
near future to students taking the
human biology core. Tutoring for
all other subjects is set to begin
Monday.
