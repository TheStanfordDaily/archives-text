# Fellows use funds to focus

Under the pressure of the publish or perish dic
tum, young professors rely on awards that help them
earn the coveted title of associate professor and the
security of tenure.
In 1994, William Hewlett and David Packard con
tributed $25 million to the University, and from that

gift the Term an Fellows Program was created to
support the research of six promising junior science
and engineering faculty members. Three years later,
seven young professors are accomplishing great
things as Frederick E. Terman Fellows, among them
designing microsensors and manipulating mathe
matical equations to describe the universe.


Asst. Mathematics Prof. Jun Li, one of the first group of Terman Fellows, demonstrates some of his
work on discovering the "final theory of the universe."
