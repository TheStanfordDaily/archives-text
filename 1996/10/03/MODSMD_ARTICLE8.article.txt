# Fellows use funds to focus
## 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
Under the pressure of the publish or perish dic
tum, young professors rely on awards that help them
earn the coveted title of associate professor and the
security of tenure.
In 1994, William Hewlett and David Packard con
tributed $25 million to the University, and from that

gift the Term an Fellows Program was created to
support the research of six promising junior science
and engineering faculty members. Three years later,
seven young professors are accomplishing great
things as Frederick E. Terman Fellows, among them
designing microsensors and manipulating mathe
matical equations to describe the universe.


Asst. Mathematics Prof. Jun Li, one of the first group of Terman Fellows, demonstrates some of his
work on discovering the "final theory of the universe."
The Terman Fellows, who have
three-year grants, are selected by
their department chairs and then
approved by their respective
deans in the Schools of Humani
ties and Sciences, Engineering,
Medicine and Earth Sciences.
The first chosen included Asst.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Thomas Kenny, Asst. Electrical
Engineering Prof. Greg Kovacs,
Asst. Mathematics Prof. Jun Li,
Asst. Physics Prof. Charles Mar
cus, Asst. Biological Sciences
Prof. Susan McConnell, Asst.
Computer Science Prof. Serge
Plotkin and Asst. Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Shan Wang.
According to Wang, the deans
decided to select seven instead of
six that year because "the School
of Engineering couldn't let any of
the candidates go."
Wang said the research that re

suited from his funding award is
focused on "developing novel mag
netic materials for information
storage." He and his researchers
are studying a way to store 10 bil
lion bits of data per square inch,
compared to the current best prod
ucts which hold only one billion
bits per square inch.
The goal, he said, is to make
this efficient storage of vast
amounts of information available
in the future at the same cost as a
one to two gigabyte storage unit is
available for today. He cited the
example of the once-costly hard
drive of years ago, which held only
200 megabytes of information.
While Wang has been working
solely in magnetic film and invisi
ble magnetic domains, his six col
leagues have been researching
vastly different subjects. For the
past few years, each has invested
his or her award into individual
projects of their choice, since their
endowments of up to $100,000 an
nually, are unrestricted.
Kovacs said the award "al

lowed more freedom than a feder
al grant" in that he and his re
search group can change the di
rection of their focus without a
great amount of proposals and pa
perwork.
Kovacs said he has used his
award to develop chemical sensors
that search out pollution or identi
fy when someone or something is
polluting. Specifically, he and his
researchers have been working on
a way to monitor minute impuri
ties in ground water by detecting
heavy metal traces in quantities as
small as one part per billion.
His work also includes the de
velopment of a sensor chip that
employs live tissue as the detec
tor. Applications for this research
could curb the use of live animals
in laboratory tests and improve
efficiency in monitoring the
health of natural resources.
Related to Kovacs' work is
Kenny's research in building
micro-machine sensors to detect
toxic gases. During the past two
years, he has focused on the pro

duction of small cantilevers which
will increase the resolution of
NMR spectroscopy, a structure
determining process which gener
ates a magnetic field to identify
atoms in a molecule.
Kenny and his group have al
ready succeeded in capturing a
high-resolution image of 10 mi
crons with the possibility of soon
seeing submicrons. It may be pos
sible to make images of individual
atoms with extremely high resolu
tion. Once scientists are able to see
and then locate individual dopant
crystals, it will be possible to fabri
cate ultra-small transistors.
"The Terman money filled in
gaps other grants left and was a
great way to bootleg projects,"
Kenny said. "I used it for lab fees,
materials and student pay
checks."
Kenny explained that the pro
gram gave him an opportunity he
was glad to have because he was
able to start up projects, which
now attract their own funding.
Plotkin, a computer science

professor, agreed. Without the
Terman Fellows program, "I
would not say that the research
could not have happened, but it
would definitely have been much
harder," Plotkin said.
Plotkin used it to fund travel
ing expenses for his research
group to attend conferences be
cause his research "begins with a
lot of paper and pencil."
He has been looking at ways to
"minimize [computerl network
overload" and "loss in perfor
mance, revenue and response
caused by poorly made decisions."
In collaboration with AT&T,
he used a mathematical principle
approach, a derivative of an algo
rithm, to create an ATM switch, a
product which is applicable to
ATM networks and possibly the
Internet if both operate under
similar principles. The switch will
manage the use of network re
sources by spreading the load of
information around, he said.
Person-to-person relations can
also be a big part of research, Li

said. His mathematical and high
energy physics work requires him
to be in indirect contact with
other researchers.
"We work with our pens but
I personal 1 connections are a very
essential part," he said. Li used
his award to fund two scientists
from Europe to lecture and share
their advanced research with his
group at Stanford.
He has been studying a new
theory which he said many in the
field of physics describe as "the
final theory of the universe."
"It's a mathematical series
that describes everything," he
said. The theory looks at a particle
as a string with a path of motion.
The particle thus has a "history,"
he explained. He said it is a novel
view of existence and time with an
explanation based on algebra and
geometry.
All of the fellows will be contin
uing their research with funding
from outside grants, such as aid
from the National Science Foun
dation.

their department chairs and then
approved by their respective
deans in the Schools of Humani
ties and Sciences, Engineering,
Medicine and Earth Sciences.
The first chosen included Asst.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Thomas Kenny, Asst. Electrical
Engineering Prof. Greg Kovacs,
Asst. Mathematics Prof. Jun Li,
Asst. Physics Prof. Charles Mar
cus, Asst. Biological Sciences
Prof. Susan McConnell, Asst.
Computer Science Prof. Serge
Plotkin and Asst. Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Shan Wang.
According to Wang, the deans
decided to select seven instead of
six that year because "the School
of Engineering couldn't let any of
the candidates go."
Wang said the research that re

suited from his funding award is
focused on "developing novel mag
netic materials for information
storage." He and his researchers
are studying a way to store 10 bil
lion bits of data per square inch,
compared to the current best prod
ucts which hold only one billion
bits per square inch.
The goal, he said, is to make
this efficient storage of vast
amounts of information available
in the future at the same cost as a
one to two gigabyte storage unit is
available for today. He cited the
example of the once-costly hard
drive of years ago, which held only
200 megabytes of information.
While Wang has been working
solely in magnetic film and invisi
ble magnetic domains, his six col
leagues have been researching
vastly different subjects. For the
past few years, each has invested
his or her award into individual
projects of their choice, since their
endowments of up to $100,000 an
nually, are unrestricted.
Kovacs said the award "al

lowed more freedom than a feder
al grant" in that he and his re
search group can change the di
rection of their focus without a
great amount of proposals and pa
perwork.
Kovacs said he has used his
award to develop chemical sensors
that search out pollution or identi
fy when someone or something is
polluting. Specifically, he and his
researchers have been working on
a way to monitor minute impuri
ties in ground water by detecting
heavy metal traces in quantities as
small as one part per billion.
His work also includes the de
velopment of a sensor chip that
employs live tissue as the detec
tor. Applications for this research
could curb the use of live animals
in laboratory tests and improve
efficiency in monitoring the
health of natural resources.
Related to Kovacs' work is
Kenny's research in building
micro-machine sensors to detect
toxic gases. During the past two
years, he has focused on the pro

duction of small cantilevers which
will increase the resolution of
NMR spectroscopy, a structure
determining process which gener
ates a magnetic field to identify
atoms in a molecule.
Kenny and his group have al
ready succeeded in capturing a
high-resolution image of 10 mi
crons with the possibility of soon
seeing submicrons. It may be pos
sible to make images of individual
atoms with extremely high resolu
tion. Once scientists are able to see
and then locate individual dopant
crystals, it will be possible to fabri
cate ultra-small transistors.
"The Terman money filled in
gaps other grants left and was a
great way to bootleg projects,"
Kenny said. "I used it for lab fees,
materials and student pay
checks."
Kenny explained that the pro
gram gave him an opportunity he
was glad to have because he was
able to start up projects, which
now attract their own funding.
Plotkin, a computer science

professor, agreed. Without the
Terman Fellows program, "I
would not say that the research
could not have happened, but it
would definitely have been much
harder," Plotkin said.
Plotkin used it to fund travel
ing expenses for his research
group to attend conferences be
cause his research "begins with a
lot of paper and pencil."
He has been looking at ways to
"minimize [computerl network
overload" and "loss in perfor
mance, revenue and response
caused by poorly made decisions."
In collaboration with AT&T,
he used a mathematical principle
approach, a derivative of an algo
rithm, to create an ATM switch, a
product which is applicable to
ATM networks and possibly the
Internet if both operate under
similar principles. The switch will
manage the use of network re
sources by spreading the load of
information around, he said.
Person-to-person relations can
also be a big part of research, Li

said. His mathematical and high
energy physics work requires him
to be in indirect contact with
other researchers.
"We work with our pens but
I personal 1 connections are a very
essential part," he said. Li used
his award to fund two scientists
from Europe to lecture and share
their advanced research with his
group at Stanford.
He has been studying a new
theory which he said many in the
field of physics describe as "the
final theory of the universe."
"It's a mathematical series
that describes everything," he
said. The theory looks at a particle
as a string with a path of motion.
The particle thus has a "history,"
he explained. He said it is a novel
view of existence and time with an
explanation based on algebra and
geometry.
All of the fellows will be contin
uing their research with funding
from outside grants, such as aid
from the National Science Foun
dation.
