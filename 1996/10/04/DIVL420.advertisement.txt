STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR YOUR CAR
Cars can potentially impact the environment in many different ways. Leaky fluids, residue from grinding
breaks, soapy water from washing, all have an impact on the environment around us. You can help
minimize the impact on the environment by following these easy suggestions.
I HOW YOU CAN HF.I.P |
□ Service your car regularly. Cars leaking oil and coolant contribute to water pollution which eventually
ends up in streams and the San Francisco Bay.
□ Do you change your own oil? If so, please use drip pans to collect the oil and then take it to a local
service station for recycling. Kragen Auto Parts will accept your used oil and offer coupons for 32
cents per gallon of recycled oil. To find the nearest oil recycling station call:

□ When replacing break pads for your car, if possible, use organic break pads. By switching to organic
break pads you can reduce the amount of copper released from brake pads that accumulates on
roadways and eventually runs off to the San Francisco Bay.
□ Wash your car over a grassy area away from storm drains,
or take your car to the car wash. Water with soap
used at commercial car washes is disposed of to the
sanitary sewer instead of the storm drain.
