# Election doesn't excite voters
## Poll reveals most expect no progress on major issues in next four years 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Unenthusiastic voters
largely expect President Clinton to win re-elec
tion next month but few expect to see progress
on major national problems over the next four
years, according to a poll released yesterday.
The Pew Research Center's national survey
also found just 43 percent of voters plan to
watch the presidential debates this year, down
from 67 percent in 1992 and 55 percent in the
two previous elections.
Two out of three registered voters say
they've already made up their minds and the
debates won't matter, as do three out of four
likely voters. The first nationally televised
debate is Sunday night.
While Clinton held a strong re-election lead
over Republican challenger Bob Dole, his per
formance as president got mixed grades from
1,517 registered voters surveyed Sept. 25-29.
Seven percent gave him an A, 40 percent B, 32

percent C, 20 percent D or F.
"What in effect you have is a C candidate
running against a D candidate, and C beats D,"
said Walter Dean Burnham, a University of
Texas political scientist. "Clinton is running
against somebody who's got other vulnerabili
ties that seem to be large enough to overcome
his own."
Still, Burnham was surprised Clinton's
average rating in the Pew poll wasn't higher, as
he has gotten some of the highest job-approval
scores of his presidency in other recent polls.
The difference may be in question wording:
Other polls ask simply if people approve or dis
approve of Clinton's handling of his job, and 55
percent or more have approved in most recent
polls. Some voters may generally approve of
Clinton's job performance, yet give it only a C
grade.
Overall, 51 percent of registered voters said

they would support Clinton if the election were
today, 35 percent favored Dole and 7 percent
backed Ross Perot — little changed from a
Pew poll in early September. Among 1,138 vot
ers deemed likely to vote next month, Clinton
led 50-38-6. The margin of sampling error for
both groups was plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
Those results are comparable to other
national polls conducted around the same time.
Asked whom they expect to win, 79 percent
of all voters said Clinton; only 12 percent said
Dole and 1 percent said Perot.
About three in 10 registered voters said they
think the country will make progress in the
next four years on the budget deficit, jobs,
crime and drug abuse; a similar proportion said
the country will lose ground on those problems,
and pluralities said things will stay about the
same.
