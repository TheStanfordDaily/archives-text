New guide on parties
gives lots of regulations,
little help to students

£ TT AVE A REASON for the
I I party. Consider decora-
JL JLtions, music, food,
games, activities and beverages
that compliment the theme."
"Decorations should be in keep
ing with the theme of the
event. . . . Flammable material
such as hay, large paper panels,
sheets, tree branches and foliage
should not be used as decorations
unless properly treated with flame
retardant."
No, it's not dialogue from
"Martha Stewart's Living." It's the
new party planning guide put out
by the Office of Student Activities
titled, "What you need to know
about hosting parties at Stanford."
The guide, which aims to pro
mote safe parties hosted by Stan
ford students or groups, was estab
lished in response to the shooting
of two 19-year-old non-Stanford
students at a party inside Tresid
der Union last February.
Granted, this incident was scary
and clearly served to remind the
campus of the importance of safety.
However, the administration's
dealing with party safety — the
guide itself as well as reprimands
for certain fraternities who have
hosted parties this fall — seems
silly in parts and unclear as a
whole.
For starters, the administration
has not made it clear why a one
time shooting incident at Tresid
der which involved non-Stanford
students necessitated new rules for
run-of-the-mill dorm and fraterni
ty parties. But, apparently that is
beside the point.
In keeping with the administra
tion's claims of not cracking down
on fraternities, the guide does not
specifically target them, instead
referring to "groups" in general.
But certain statements within the

guide could not be more obviously
to the contrary.
For example, the guide states,
"Avoid serving hard liquor. Shots of
any kind (including Jell-O) are not
acceptable." Might as well preface
this with "A note to the Dekes"
since this fraternity hosts an annu
al "Jell-0 bash" each year.
The crux of the guide, though, is
its concluding section establishing
five levels of parties ranging from
private room parties to off-campus
parties sponsored by Stanford
groups. Special note: For level one
parties, "individual invitations are
acceptable." Gee thanks, Student
Activities.
As the levels progress, more reg
ulations — largely dealing with
not serving alcohol to minors —
are put on the parties, but the
guide does not state what will hap
pen to those organizations which
do not meet these University
expectations.
Though at least one minor in
possession citation has been issued
at a fraternity party earlier this
fall, Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington told members of the
ASSU Tuesday night that the
Stanford police do not intend to
enter parties unless they are called
to do so.
The administration, for its part,
stated that it does not intend to
crack down on fraternity parties
and will leave this job to police dis
cretion.
And yet, recent parties thrown
by the Dekes and Sigma Chi were
shut down by the police, and the
fraternities are currently under
investigation by the Greek Judicial
Council.
Something doesn't add up here.
Students need to be made aware of
the current status of fraternity
parties at Stanford. What will hap
pen if fraternities continue with
their practice of serving alcohol to
any party-goers? Can underage
students consume alcohol at par
ties without getting cited?
Unfortunately, the new party
policies beg more questions than
they answer.
