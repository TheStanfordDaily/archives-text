said a rabbi when he
heard about my new
appointment as an asso
ciate dean of religious
life at Stanford.
"What does a rabbi do

at Memorial Church?" others have
inquired more politely. The confusion is
understandable. This is new territory. I
went from working in a synagogue with
general awareness of what a rabbi does
to a university chaplaincy which has been
staffed by and historically associated
with Protestant Christianity.
My presence as one of the University
chaplains has contributed to a discussion
of important and long overdue questions
about the place of religion in a university
community. Recognizing that appointing
a rabbi as an "associate dean of Memori
al Church" would be incongruous, all
three of us who were just appointed
became "associate deans of religious
life." This is not just an accommodation
to having a rabbi on staff, but rather a
reflection of a healthy questioning of the
role of religion on campus.
The variety of religious experience,
faith traditions and spiritual seeking on
campus is already far richer than a Chris
tian idiom can encompass. My presence
insists that the time has come for the
University chaplaincy to be defined not
solely by a building and by the activities

which occur within its walls such as Uni
versity public worship, weddings and
memorial services, but by the scope, com
plexity and richness of religious life on
campus in which Memorial Church is a
part, but not the whole.
As deans of religious life, our staff is
committed to going beyond the walls of
the church into the dorms, the class
rooms and the workplaces of Stanford
to begin to create a multifaith chaplain
cy which reflects the diversity of our
community. We see ourselves engaged
in and conversing with one another and
with the Stanford community about
how our traditions speak to one anoth
er.
We have discussed how we can pray
together and how we can shape rituals
which maintain the integrity of each of
our traditions in a respectful and authen
tic way. We are beginning to dream about
a space in which our many religious tra
ditions are not only free to practice but
eager to communicate with others, not
for purposes of proselytizing, but to deep
en respect and knowledge.
When Jane Stanford established
Memorial Church, she broke through
the confines of her own particularism to
create a non-denominational Christian
church. For Jews and other religious
adherents, the implications of that can
easily be missed. Jane Stanford was as
forward-thinking and pluralistic as her
time and place allowed. Perhaps it is
not too chutzpadik to suggest that in

working toward a multifaith chaplain
cy, we are continuing her vision of mov
ing beyond the limits of what one is
given, to imagine a reality not yet creat
ed.
The intellectual tradition of Stanford
has rightly earned this community a rep
utation for excellence. But an excellent
education is not only an education of the
mind, but an education of the soul and
the spirit as well. Just as one's mind is
stretched at Stanford, so one's view of
faith and religious traditions can be
expanded and challenged.
There is a strong connection between
the world of ideas and the world of the
spirit. Questions of our place in the
world, our responsibility to others, our
understanding of what we are here for
are not only intellectual but are also r<4i
gious questions. Part of the work of the
University chaplains is to create conver
sations in which we make that link more*
apparent. Our specialty is in knowing
about how religious traditions challenge
us, anchor us, shape us.
In response to the rabbi who asserted
that I have become an Episcopalian, I
understand this holy work not as aban
doning Judaism, but as incorporating the
language of my tradition and the Jewish
commitment to study in a larger conver
sation.
