# GUIDELINES FOR PAYMENT OF INTERNS
## 
### 
The Department of Labor has outlined the requirements to be
come a "trainee" — the category under which an intern would fall.
These criteria are taken directly from a U.S. Department of Labor,
Wage and Hour Division fact sheet from April 1994.
• The training, even though it includes actual operation of the facili
ties of the employer, must be similar to that which would be given in
a vocational school (a curriculum is followed and the students are
under continued and direct supervision by either representatives of
the school or by employees of the business).
• The training must be for the benefit of the trainees or students. The
placements of trainees must not be made to meet the labor needs of
the business.
• The trainees or students must not displace regular employees, va
cant positions must not be filled, employees must not have been re
lieved of assigned duties, and the students must not be performing
services that, although not ordinarily performed by employees, clear
ly are of benefit to the business.
• The employer that provides the training must derive no advantage
from the activities of the trainees or students.
• The trainees or students must not necessarily be entitled to a job
at the conclusion of the training period. (Once a student has become
an employee, the student cannot be considered a trainee at that par
ticular placement unless in a clearly distinguishable occupation.)
• The employer and the trainees or students must understand that
the trainees or students are not entitled to wages for the time spent in
training.
