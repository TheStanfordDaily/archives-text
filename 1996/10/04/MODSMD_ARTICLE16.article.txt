## Billikens bombarded After scoreless first half, field hockey explodes to keep St. Louis winless 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The Stanford field hockey team execut
ed another dominating match in a 5-1 win
over St. Louis (0-8) yesterday to improve
its season record to 5-1.
Despite Stanford's 2-0 triumph over St.
Louis at the Billikens' home grounds last
season and the expectations for the Cardi
nal to put on a skillful victory, the squad
got oft" to a fairly slow start.
The first half of the game ended with a
score of 0-0 despite Stanford's 14 shots on
goal and six penalty shots.
"We're definitely domiri ting the game,
but we're just not putting it in," said Asst.
Athletic Director Shirley Schoof at half

time. The players "look good, so I'm sure
we'll start getting them in."
True to Schoofs word, the Stanford
team leaped into action as soon as the whis
tle blew to signal the beginning of the sec
ond half â€” sophomore forward / midfield
er Sarah Medeiros immediately made the
first goal, assisted by junior midfielder
Paige Mader.
The Cardinal members came back with
spectacular plays that equaled the precise
and confident performances seen in last
Saturday's win over Cal, including goals by
senior tri-captain Baochi Nguyen, senior
defense Amy Marfil and sophomore for
ward Monique Leroux.
