## Billikens bombarded After scoreless first half, field hockey explodes to keep St. Louis winless 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The Stanford field hockey team execut
ed another dominating match in a 5-1 win
over St. Louis (0-8) yesterday to improve
its season record to 5-1.
Despite Stanford's 2-0 triumph over St.
Louis at the Billikens' home grounds last
season and the expectations for the Cardi
nal to put on a skillful victory, the squad
got oft" to a fairly slow start.
The first half of the game ended with a
score of 0-0 despite Stanford's 14 shots on
goal and six penalty shots.
"We're definitely domiri ting the game,
but we're just not putting it in," said Asst.
Athletic Director Shirley Schoof at half

time. The players "look good, so I'm sure
we'll start getting them in."
True to Schoofs word, the Stanford
team leaped into action as soon as the whis
tle blew to signal the beginning of the sec
ond half — sophomore forward / midfield
er Sarah Medeiros immediately made the
first goal, assisted by junior midfielder
Paige Mader.
The Cardinal members came back with
spectacular plays that equaled the precise
and confident performances seen in last
Saturday's win over Cal, including goals by
senior tri-captain Baochi Nguyen, senior
defense Amy Marfil and sophomore for
ward Monique Leroux.
With just 5 minutes remaining,
freshman forward Lindsay Duna
gan, who has played in all but one
game since the start of the season,
finished the Billikens off with her
first varsity goal.
Dunagan, freshman defender
Ashley Rich and sophomore
sweeper Lissy Goralnik are all
from St. Louis and have practiced
under Billiken coach Cathleene
O'Brien. They have played with
some of the St. Louis players as
well.
"It was weird to see them
here," Dunagan said. "But it
didn't affect [my play]."
O'Brien commented that the
Cardinal was a good team and that
she was impressed with some of
the Stanford players in particular.
"I'm happy with the way the
team played in the first half," she
said. "But we let Stanford do what
it wanted in the second half, al
lowing them to dribble down mid
dle field."
The Billikens coach also joked
that it was great to see her former
players out on the field again
"even if they are playing for the
other team."
According to coach Sheryl
Johnson, the Stanford team still
needs to work on dominating the
whole game.
"I think our skill level was
there, but it's always hard to keep
the mentality up after a big
game," she said, referring to the
Cal victory. "We have to make
sure we build on each game and
stay up."
After the halftime awakening,
the Stanford team controlled the
game as well as the ball until the
end, except for a shot Billiken

sophomore forward Laura Dobosz
managed to squeeze in midway
through the Cardinal's line of at
tack.
"In the second half, we really
picked up," said Cardinal sopho
more defense Stephanie Fin
klestein. "We needed to focus
more in the first half. We had lots
of opportunities, but we weren't
capitalizing them."
According to Finklestein, the
defense had a difficult time get-

'We needed to focus
more in the first half.
In the second half, we
really picked up.'

ting used to the different look of
St. Louis' offensive line. But as
the Cardinal familiarized them
selves with the St. Louis team and
began to govern the Billiken goal,
the Stanford crowd started to pick
up as well.
Cheers and shouts from the
bleachers as well as the Cardinal
bench did not stop until the end of
the game.
"The team was great," said
sophomore Thad Buzolish, who
calls himself the No. 1 fan of the
field hockey team. "There are ex
cellent young players and there's
great leadership [in the team]."
Stanford will next play Pacific
tomorrow at 1 p.m. on Maloney
Field in a Northern Pacific Con
ference match. The Cardinal al
ready enjoyed a 2-0 victory over
the Tigers two weeks ago.
"I think we should definitely
win the game," Johnson said. "We
just have to keep our mentality up
and execute our skills."
