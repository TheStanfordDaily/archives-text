This weekend senior outside midfielder
Erik Morrison may be unwelcome at home.
On Sunday, the Sacramento native
faces a clash of loyalties as the Stanford
men's soccer team travels to play league
rival Sacramento State on Hornet Field.
"We've labeled this as an important part
of our season," Morrison said. "Sunday
will tell us a lot about our season."
Coming off a 4-2-2 record in the early part
of its nonconference slate, Sunday's match
at Sacramento State marks the opening of
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play
and a defining moment for the Cardinal.
"It's a big game for us," said assistant
coach Randy Mann. "There's a lot at stake
here. It's a game we feel we should win."
With a short league schedule of only five

games, Sunday's contest will determine
the course of Stanford's postseason hopes.
After a tough loss to Cal State-North
ridge last week, the Cardinal enters its
league opener with renewed optimism for
the season.
"Our main strength is organization and
our team defense," Mann said.
Although the Cardinal squad does not
boast any true superstars, Mann believes
the team forms "a solid, cohesive unit.
Everyone understands their roles."
Sophomore midfielder A.J. Sauer cites
this renewed team closeness as a key to vic
tory in Sunday's game. Coming off a recent
loss, Sauer believes this team unity has in
spired strong improvement over the past
week. The squad is clearly looking ahead.
"We've just got to make sure
we come out and play," Sauer
said. "If we stay focused, we
should be all right. We can't have
any mental laps.. . even when we
play [poorly] we can't give up the
struggles."
Sacramento State head coach
Michael Leinberger articulated a
similar need for focus for the
Hornets and underscored the im
portance of this first league con
test for both teams.
"Stanford has become kind of
a rival in soccer," Leinberger
said. "It's a big event for us. I ex
pect a good game. Stanford al
ways draws a good attendance
when we play them here."
The Hornets (3-5) hope to
challenge Stanford's defense
with an explosive offensive
combo. Junior Darren Edge an
chors the Hornets' midfield
game, while senior forward
Jamel Mitchell leads the scoring
attack. Following an impressive
performance of four goals and
four assists in the last two games,
Mitchell will look to test the Car
dinal backfield.
Mitchell "is really dangerous.
He's the rare type of guy who can
create something out of noth
ing," Mann said.
Containing Mitchell will be
key to the Stanford's defensive
strategy. And given the quick
scoring nature of the Sacramento
offense, Mann cautions his squad
to avoid getting behind.
In addition to a strong defen
sive effort, Morrison highlights
his team's potential to strike
quickly at the opposing goal.
"When we gbforward quickly,
we're dangerous," Morrison said.
With renewed team bonds and
equal distribution of firepower
among all players on the field, the
Cardinal expects success.
"The strength of our team is
that we play as a team," Morrison
said. "We feel like we're all on the
same page right now, and we just
want to go out and play."
