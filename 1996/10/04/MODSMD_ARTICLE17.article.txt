This weekend senior outside midfielder
Erik Morrison may be unwelcome at home.
On Sunday, the Sacramento native
faces a clash of loyalties as the Stanford
men's soccer team travels to play league
rival Sacramento State on Hornet Field.
"We've labeled this as an important part
of our season," Morrison said. "Sunday
will tell us a lot about our season."
Coming off a 4-2-2 record in the early part
of its nonconference slate, Sunday's match
at Sacramento State marks the opening of
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play
and a defining moment for the Cardinal.
"It's a big game for us," said assistant
coach Randy Mann. "There's a lot at stake
here. It's a game we feel we should win."
With a short league schedule of only five

games, Sunday's contest will determine
the course of Stanford's postseason hopes.
After a tough loss to Cal State-North
ridge last week, the Cardinal enters its
league opener with renewed optimism for
the season.
"Our main strength is organization and
our team defense," Mann said.
Although the Cardinal squad does not
boast any true superstars, Mann believes
the team forms "a solid, cohesive unit.
Everyone understands their roles."
Sophomore midfielder A.J. Sauer cites
this renewed team closeness as a key to vic
tory in Sunday's game. Coming off a recent
loss, Sauer believes this team unity has in
spired strong improvement over the past
week. The squad is clearly looking ahead.
