# Volleyball to greet Bears, Olympians
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team (11-1,4-
0 Pacific 10 Conference) will be
Bear hunting this weekend as
archrival California visits the
Farm tonight. The Cardinal will
then play an exhibition match
against the USA Olympic team
tomorrow evening. Both matches
begin at 7 p.m.
The Stanford women have
amassed a perfect 5-0 record at
home, including Tuesday's win
over Sacramento State. The Car
dinal stands on top of the Pac-10
after disposing of conference ri
vals No. 10 Washington State and
18th-ranked Washington last
weekend.
The unranked Bears (3-7, 0-4)
have suffered a few tough losses,
including two close defeats at the
hands of heavily favored Wash
ington and Washington State.
California stretched both of those
matches to five games despite its
underdog status.
Although California's short
lineup may give the tall Cardinal
squad more offensive opportuni
ties, the Bears have been holding
their own defensively this season.
"They are very good defen
sively, very scrappy, and they are
Cal," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "They are going to come out
and not be intimidated by any
body."
Stanford will adjust its de
fense slightly for California, par
ticularly in its blocking schemes.
The Bears will run many quick
sets, which occur when the setter
puts the ball low and close to the
net so that a hitter can sneak a

spike in before the opposing
blockers are set up. If successful,
the Bears may neutralize the
Cardinal's significant size advan
tage.
However, California will prob
ably not catch Stanford flat foot
ed. The Cardinal seems to have
found a solution to the slow
starts that it suffered from earli
er in the season.
"This team is starting to do a
very good job of getting them
selves ready to play," Shaw said.
"They are coming out and playing
at a very high level right off the
bat."
Despite California's poor
record and Stanford's own 38-
match home winning streak, the
Cardinal players refuse to take
the Bears lightly.
"Whenever we play Cal, the ri
valry is going to be strong," ju
nior outside hitter Kristin Folkl
said. "I am definitely not looking
past them. They play hard, and
they play to win."
Since Cal only visits the Farm
once a year, the Card also hopes
the Stanford faithful will come
out in droves and show their sup
port.
"Hopefully the crowd will be
big," junior outside hitter Debbie
Lambert said. "They totally fire
us up."
A packed house is definitely
expected tomorrow night, when
the Cardinal will face the USA
Olympic squad as it makes its
only Bay Area aDpearance of the
season. If California Joes not put
up a challenge for Stanford, the
Olympians surely will.
