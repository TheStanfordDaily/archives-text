# Offense hopes to awaken from slumber in Seattle
## Football tries to end drought 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
While struggling to a 1-2 record, the Cardinal
men's football team promised that all it needed to
return to last season's bowl success was time.
After three nonconference games and a subse
quent bye, Stanford has had just that in prepara
tion for tomorrow's Pacific 10 Conference opener
against No. 18 Washington at Husky Stadium,
and the time has come to perform.
"This is our Pac-10 opening ball game so I
would hope that our boys understand that this is
what you really play for when you play in the Pac
-10," Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham
said. "We have an excellent opportunity to get a
great start against a good football team. And if we
go out and play the game the way we are capable
of playing, then we have an excellent chance of
winning it."
The bulk of the Cardinal's troubles in the non
conference schedule came on the offensive end,
where Stanford looked consistently out of sorts.
The Cardinal is putting an average of just 11.7
points on the board, which puts them dead last in
the Pac-10 in scoring offense and near the bottom
in Division I-A.
Noticeably absent has been the Stanford
ground attack. Outside of senior fullback Adam

Salina's two rushing touchdowns against San
Jose State, the ground game has been largely un
productive. Senior Mike Mitchell and junior An
thony Bookman, who combined for nearly 1,500
yards last year, have only accumulated 190 total
rushing yards on 56 carries.
An offensive line that features three first-time
starters has been cited for the running game's dis
appearing act, and the Cardinal line is not making
any excuses.
"Even though we have young guys starting,
they all have definite ability to be good Pac-10
players," senior left tackle Nate Parks said. "Any
time the running game is struggling, it definitely
comes down to the offensive line because we are
the guys making the blocks and creating the holes
for the running backs."
Willingham is confident that the run game will
return to the Stanford offense.
"What we see in our run game is that we have
people in the right places," Willingham said. "Our
guys are very close to getting the execution that
we need to be a very productive run offense."
The Husky defense may not be the ideal oppo
nent to find a rushing attack against. Washington
is second in the Pac-10 in rush defense, allowing
just 109.3 yards per game on the ground. Line
backers John Fiala and Ink Aleaga lead the charge
for the Husky defense, ranking second and eighth
in the conference with 13.3 and 9.3 tackles per
game, respectively. Junior Jerry Jensen rounds
out the linebacker core for the Huskies.
"I really like their experience," Washington
head coach Jim Lambright said. "They have a
great nose for the ball and they have great football
instincts."
Defensive end Jason Chorak is also making his
presence felt for Washington, currently third in
the Pac-10 in sacks with four for a loss of 17 yards.
Stanford's offensive woes are never more ap
parent than on third down, where the Cardinal
has converted just nine of its 37 attempts for a 24
percent conversion rate.
"I think it's just execution," Parks said. "I've
watched the film and everything will go right and
we'll have one little breakdown in the play, and
that is something you can't have."
While the offense has been trying to find its
rhythm, all is alive and well for the Cardinal on
the other side of the ball. The Stanford defense is
allowing just 11 points a game, tops in the Pac-10
and ninth in the country. The Cardinal is also
yieldingjust 325.5 total yards per game.
"I absolutely love what Stanford is doing on de
fense," Lambright said. "I like the attack style,
and I think they've done a great job getting out
and going after people and holding the points
down."
The Stanford defense is still looking to get bet
ter each week, however.
"You can always improve," junior tackle Carl
Hansen said. "We set goals for ourselves every
week. We have made improvements from last
year, but we can still get better."
The Cardinal is looking for that improvement
more specifically on third down, where it is allow
ing opponents to convert first downs 47 percent of
the time.
After holding the vaunted Wisconsin running
game intact two weeks ago, the Cardinal defense
has yet another challenge against Washington.

hee, who ran for nearly 200 yards
against the Cardinal last season.
The Huskies can then counter
with junior college transfer Corey
Dillon, the Pac-10 leader in all
pu rpose yardage.
The Cardinal will be without
the services of senior nose tackle
Pete Swanson in its quest to stop
Shehee and Dillon. The fifth-year
senior reaggravated a shoulder
injury against the Badgers and
will not make the trip.
"Pete's an emotional and

physical leader on this team,"
Hansen said. "He's the only
fifth-year senior left on the de
fense, and he's a huge guy inside.
We're going to miss all of that.
We will just have to push
through. I think we have people
we can put in."
Sophomore Andrew Currie, ju
nior Anthony Willis and senior
Evan Wagner will split time in
Swanson's absence.
The Cardinal will also be look
ing to put pressure on quarter
backs Shane Fortney and Brock
Huard, who have been solid at the
helm for Washington. Fortney,
back from a strained knee, will
get the starting nod, but expect to

see Huard as well. Last week,
Huard threw for .311 yards and
three touchdowns against Ari
zona.
Though Fortney and Huard
have combined to throw just four
interceptions, the Cardinal wants
to pressure the Husky quarter
backs into making bad decisions.
"They make smart decisions,"
Willingham said. "We are hoping
that we'll be able to supply suffi
cient pressure to force them to
throw the ball at some inoppor
tune times."
