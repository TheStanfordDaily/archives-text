## Political science profs lectures are 'models of clarity' 
### Jim Tankersley 
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Scott Sagan was honored last week
by his students and colleagues for
excellence in undergraduate educa
tion.
At the Sept. 25 Junior Convoca
tion, Sagan received the Laurance
and Naomi Hoagland Prize for Un
dergraduate Teaching. The award
draws its nominees from student
letters of recommendation, with
final selection made by a panel of
deans from undergraduate schools.
"I feel both honored and moved
by (the award)," Sagan said. "Hon
ored because it means that my in
terest to inspire students has
worked."
He added that he was pleased

that the group of
deans recognized
the difficulty of
teaching lecture
classes, a practice
he enjoys.
"It reminds me
how personally re
warding it is to
teach a huge un
dergraduate lec-

ture class and how important it is
for faculty here to do that and do it
well," he said.
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven presented the
award to Sagan. In his remarks,
Shoven said students not only flock
to Sagan's courses but often seek
the professor as an honors thesis ad
viser.

Sagan also drew praise from sev
eral colleagues, including fellow Po
litical Science Prof. David Aber
nethy. Sagan's lectures, Abernethy
said, "are models of clarity. He is
beautifully organized."
Some of Sagan's other strengths
include his ability to deal with peo
ple and to tackle significant issues,
Abernethy said. He called Sagan
courteous in all settings, saying that
he takes people seriously, and also
noted that he works on important,
innovative topics.
Since coming to Stanford in
1987, Sagan has been appointed as a
senior fellow at the Institute for In
ternational Studies and has worked
with the Center for International


Sagan
Security and Arms Control. He is
currently the chair of the Interna
tional Relations Program and the
vice chair of the Political Science De
partment.
Last year, he co-authored a book
on the risk of nuclear accidents or
accidental war. In it, he argued
against co-author Kenneth Waltz of
UC-Berkeley â€” Sagan taking the
stance that the risk is great. As part
of a current project, he will repeat
that debate in New Delhi, India,
later this year.
He also is in the process of re
searching organizations that man

age hazardous technologies, includ
ing space shuttles and nuclear
power plants.
Outside of his work at Stanford,
Sagan has been a consultant for
the strategic nuclear policy branch
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
other organizations, including Los
Alamos National Laboratory. He
earned his bachelor's from Oberlin
College in 1977 and a doctorate in
political science from Harvard
University in 1983.
Sagan is the 10 th recipient of the
Hoagland Prize. Named in honor of
donor Laurance Hoagland Jr.'s par
ents, the award was established to
honor superb teachers and their
commitment to undergraduate edu
cation. Nominations forms are
mailed to sophomores each spring.
