# Water polo to welcome Aggies

### Rustan Eklund 
After a spectacular come
back win over Pacific on Sun
day, the No. 5 Stanford men
aim to continue their winning
ways against No. 9 UC-Davis
when they host the Aggies at
noon tomorrow in deGuerre

Pool.
Coached by former Stanford
player Tom Elson (a member of
the 1976 NCAA Championship
team), Davis boasts its best
lineup in recent history and
has recorded victories against
several top teams.
"They've beaten No. 14 UC-

Santa Barbara and No. 8 Long
Beach State," said Stanford
coach Dante Dettamanti.
"This is the best team that
Davis has had in the last 10
years."
As good as the Aggies are,
the Stanford squad is confident
going into this weekend's
game.
"We have already beaten
them once this year, and we're
pretty healthy," Dettamanti
said. "But they're certainly ca
pable of beating us if we don't
have a good game."
Dettamanti looks toward to
morrow's contest as an oppor
tunity to give the younger play
ers some playing time and pre
pare for the Northern Califor
nia tournament which is being
held Oct. 12-13 in Stockton.
"We're looking toward the
tournament two weeks from
now, where we have a chance to
play top-four teams [in the na
tional rankings]," Dettamanti
said. "We've been practicing
with a lot of intensity and have
been training very hard."
With just two losses this sea
son (both to UC-Irvine), the
Stanford men are ready to
challenge the best in the coun
try.
"We're definitely not look
ing past Davis, but we're look
ing forward to the tourna
ment," said senior holeman
Bryce Matthews. "Right now
we're just trying to focus on
keeping the momentum."
And momentum they have.

The Stanford players have
won their last five games and
continued to improve their
play in recent weeks.
"Slowly but surely we are
making the corrections," Det
tamanti said. "The thing that I
like most is that everyone is
contributing. We're really
playing as a team."
