# Ping offers early measuring stick
## Men's golf powerhouses collide at Illinois tournament 
### Jeff Ellingson 
Six Stanford golfers will take
to the links tomorrow in the pres
tigious Ping / Golf Week Preview
Tournament at Conway Farms
Golf Course in Lake Forest, 111.
Because this is one of the
largest tournaments of the fall
season and features the top 15
teams in the country based on
last year's final standings, the
Preview Tournament should give
the Cardinal men's golf team a
solid idea of where it stands this
year.
Finishing fourth last year and
sending one golfer to the profes
sional circuit sets a challenging
precedent for this year's squad
Much of this weight of expec
tation falls on the shoulders of
sophomore Joel Kribel, who fin
ished second at the Rolex Colle
giate Golf Tournament last week

end.
"He's a little behind Tiger still
— maybe half a shadow or so,"
said Stanford golf coach Wally
Goodwin.
"This summer I felt 1 raised
my game to another level," Kribel
said. "My playing has been solid
lately, and I feel confident about
this year."
Kribel will travel with senior
Conrad Ray, junior Jake Poe,
sophomore Scott Wang and
freshman Andy Hastings to this
weekend's event, which will be an
excellent opportunity for the Car
dinal to view the field.
"The Preview Tournament
will host all the top teams," Ray
said. "It's one of the best tourna
ments we'll plav in before Nation
als."
"These first tournaments pro
vide opportunities to see the
other good teams, what they have

and what we need to do to beat
them," Goodwin said.
An invitation to the Preview
Tournament also brings with it
the opportunity to play Conway
Farms Golf Course — the site of
the 1997 NCAA Championships.
"It's a great course with a lot
of length," Ray said.
By golfing the course now, the
team will have a better idea of
what to expect and prepare for as
the NCAAs approach next May.
Another goal for the team this
weekend will be to deal with its
new climate quickly, according to
Goodwin.
"It's difficult for an entire
team to adjust in one day to a two
hour change (from PST to CST)
and not let it affect their play,"
Goodwin said.
"Every day we have the same
goal — we play today to prepare
for tomorrow," Goodwin said.
