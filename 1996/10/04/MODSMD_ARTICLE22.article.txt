It's back to the drawing board
in this week's NCAA football
picks of the week. I've decid
ed to take a step back from pick
ing the games with real human
beings and put my apparently
dismal ability to predict the fu
ture to the true test.
Perhaps you remember the
competence test of several top
stockbrokers that was conducted
several years ago. The brokers
chose the stocks they thought
would perform best, and those
"professionally chosen" stocks
competed against a set of random
stocks chosen by the throwing of
darts onto a newspaper stock
page. Sure enough, the dart
stocks beat out the "experts."
This week I put myself to a
similar test. I'm picking the
games with Abraham Lincoln —
that is, I am competing against
the unbiased, uninformed toss of
a penny. It's a vice-like situation
to put myself in; if I out-pick
Abe, I merely accomplish what
would be expected of a cognitive,
sports-learned human being. If
Abe out-picks me, I'll be the first
person in history to be remem
bered for having been pinched by
a penny.
Stanford at Washington
Ode to the days when the
Stanford football squad could put
points on the board.
For the past three seasons the
Cardinal has been an offensive
juggernaut, churning out points
faster than a Power PC processes
bits. Simultaneously, Stanford's
defense has perennially played
like a thin slice of Swiss cheese —
full of holes and unable to hold
together under pressure.
And now, the Cardinal is in
the midst of a role reversal that
makes Saul of Tarsus' conver
sion look like a whimsical and
short-lived change in hairstyle.
Stanford's defense is now tops in

the Pacific 10 Conference, and
the offense can't score to save its
soul.
Unless Stanford has found the
ability to cross the goal line in the
past two weeks, the Cardinal will
have some problems in Seattle
this weekend. Washington, also
fresh from a bye last week, has an
offense that plays the same tune
that Stanford's did in the Sten
strom / Butterfield years. It's
music to the ears of Husky fans
— 311 passing and 166 rushing
yards two weeks ago — but "the
song that never ends" for the
Cardinal, who will undoubtedly
need to put at least 21 points on
the board to claim a victory.
A toss of the coin randomly
predicts a victory by the Huskies.
So far my chances at beating Abe
are looking pretty slim.

Washington State at Arizona
Mixed feelings abound on this
game. I like the Cougars' bal
anced offensive attack. I don't
like Washington State's defense,
which forces the Cougar offense
to score in triple digits each week
to have any shot at winning.
Both these squads think the
word "de-fense" comes from the
French for"the stuff we don't
do." Watch any 2-minute snippet
of a Washington State football
game and you might mistake the
Cougar defense for its oppo
nents' offense, were it not for the
delineating jerseys. Still, WSU
can put more points on the board
than the Wildcats and, seeing
how that's the definition of win
ning a football game, I gotta go
with the Cougs.
