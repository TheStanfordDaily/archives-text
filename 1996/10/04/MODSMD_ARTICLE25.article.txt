# You don't remember me, but can we hug?
## 
### 
THE OTHER DAY I ran into a girl I
kinda know through a friend. Amazing
ly, 1 remembered her name, so in an
attempt to reveal my suave new image, I
asked her the typical back-to-school ques
tions. "How was your summer . . . where are
you living this year . . . what classes are you
taking this quarter?" After humoring me with
a few polite replies, she quite viciously asked
if it were "possible to have a more generic con
versation." Touche, I thought, as 1 began to
cry.
This was the first of several heart
rending incidents in which I was reminded of
the perennial problem facing returning stu
dents: How do you greet people who fall in
between the "1 barely know you" and"I know
your name, but that's about it" category?
Regardless of where you run into a
person you barely know, an etiquette dilemma
inevitably presents itself. "Should I pretend I
didn't see her, or should 1 say hello and bolt?
Should I strike up a conversation, and, if so,
how short of a conversation can 1 get away
with?" One's coolness rating can fall precipi
tously with a weak performance on this cru
cial social competency test.
For example, if you don't acknowl
edge a girl who knows that you know her,
she'll call you on it, making you look like a
complete jackass. On the other hand, when

you do greet her, she doesn't remember ever
meeting you. You then look like you are just a
little too interested.
Supposing that you do remember her
name and know that she remembers yours;
the problem is then whether to hug her to
show her how much you missed her. It is usu
ally not too hard to tell whether a hug is in
order, though it's infinitely more difficult and
clearly more important to know what type of
hug is most appropriate.
If it's a good friend, anything pretty
much goes. Hugging her as if she were your
dead grandmother is out of line. Firmly and
repeatedly grabbing the rear is usually well
received.
Hugging people you don't know well
can prove problematic. Hugs early in a rela
tionship are simply awkward. Do I push to let
go, or do I let her? How tightly is it OK to
squeeze? How far down the back is it OK to
place my hands? Imprudent decisions
inevitably doom a promising hugging relation
ship. The importance of hugs cannot be over
stated. Hugs can easily make one's overall
coolness plummet. When a guy hugs a girl
incorrectly, he not only completely turns her
off, he risks the potential "reputational"
repercussions among her friends.
So what's the solution? Pretend you
know everyone you recognize, even if only

vaguely. You can always make up reasons why
the person ought to know you. If clever
enough, you can even make yourself look cool
er by making them appear foolish for not
knowing you. If your bullshitt ing skills aren't
up to par, you might pretend that you remem
ber only those people that you're certain know
you. For those people who may not know you,
the "I'm better than you, and no, of course, I
don't remember your name" attitude is pretty
darn effective.
As far as hugging is concerned, hug
only those people whom you have some inter
est in getting to know better, otherwise you
might hug someone generally regarded as an
"unhuggable." If other cooler and more hug
worthy people witness such a shameful act,
your place in the hug hierarchy could be hope
lessly lost.
