# Unpaid internships break law

Most students searching for summer internships
take it for granted that they will end up slaving away
for no pay. But, in many cases, unpaid internships
may be illegal.
Internships at for-profit businesses are subject to
minimum wage laws unless a number of criteria are
met. The requirement holds even if a student is re
ceiving college credit for the work.
A number of large companies do not pay their in
terns, including ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and CNN.
According to Rachel Leibrock Davis, a writer and
internship coordinator at the Sacramento News &
Review, unpaid internships are common among
newspapers, too, including her own.

"You'll find thata lot of internships are non-paid,"
she said. "Maybe the bigger dailies and the bigger
magazines will pay but not alternative weeklies of
our size (circulation 85,000). All of our money comes
from advertising and that goes to pay for publication
and staff."
In general, media organizations are more likely
than other businesses not to pay interns. Intern
ships in architecture and theater often also are un
paid.
Few people seem to be aware of the laws prohibit
ing this practice. Officials at media organizations, in
ternship coordinators and even Department ofLabor
officials said they had no knowledge of the regula
tions.
