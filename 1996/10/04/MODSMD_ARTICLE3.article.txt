# Unpaid internships break law
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
Most students searching for summer internships
take it for granted that they will end up slaving away
for no pay. But, in many cases, unpaid internships
may be illegal.
Internships at for-profit businesses are subject to
minimum wage laws unless a number of criteria are
met. The requirement holds even if a student is re
ceiving college credit for the work.
A number of large companies do not pay their in
terns, including ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and CNN.
According to Rachel Leibrock Davis, a writer and
internship coordinator at the Sacramento News &
Review, unpaid internships are common among
newspapers, too, including her own.

"You'll find thata lot of internships are non-paid,"
she said. "Maybe the bigger dailies and the bigger
magazines will pay but not alternative weeklies of
our size (circulation 85,000). All of our money comes
from advertising and that goes to pay for publication
and staff."
In general, media organizations are more likely
than other businesses not to pay interns. Intern
ships in architecture and theater often also are un
paid.
Few people seem to be aware of the laws prohibit
ing this practice. Officials at media organizations, in
ternship coordinators and even Department ofLabor
officials said they had no knowledge of the regula
tions.
Legal standards
As a result of the 1938 Fair
Labor Standards Act, most workers
are subject to minimum wage laws
— interns included. In fact, a work
er will rarely meet all the criteria
necessary to qualify for an unpaid
internship.
If those criteria are not met, the
business can be held responsible
and may be forced to pay back
wages, with the possibility of other
penalties.
The Labor Department fact
sheet on the labor standards act
gives an example of an intern who
would be exempt from minimum
wage laws: "a student entering
worthless data on a company com
puter which is not used to conduct
business."
According to Brian Yeskovich,
an investigator with the Depart
ment of Labor in Reno, Nev., the
department looks at each possible
violation on an individual basis.
Internship issues rarely come up,
he said.
In addition, he said, the extent
of violations should not be overes
timated, as a large number of fac
tors come into consideration.
Who knew?
Few people apparently know
about this law.
One of the few organizations
that is aware is the University of
Nevada-Reno Internship Office.
The office refuses to acknowledge
businesses that don't pay interns,
according to internship coordina
tor Nancy Markee.
However, even that office
rarely deals with the problem.
"It's never been an issue since
I've been here," said James Gentry,
dean of the Reynolds School of Jour
nalism at the university. "I've never
heard this discussed before. I guess
it just never boiled to the surface.

"I wouldn't say we are system
atically involved in breaking this
law," said Gentry. "We always
urge employers to pay their in
terns. We tell them it's in their
best interest to pay students."

'I had no idea about
the law because (un
paid) internships are
such an institution in
American society.'

Warren Lerude, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist and
the internship coordinator at
the Reynolds School of Journal
ism, said he did not know about
the labor standards act. And be
cause most internships
arranged through the university
are paid, he said, it is not a big
problem.
"I had never seen it before,"
Lerude said. "Nobody had ever
complained. But when I look at
those [requirements], most of
them would apply. The way we do
this, most of them are not a prob
lem."
However, he did admit that the
fourth requirement — that the
business does not benefit from the
internship — would be a stum
bling block in most unpaid intern
ships.
"I think it's vague to the point
that I do not know why (business
es] would get involved in intern
ships if there was no advantage,"
he said. "If there was no advan
tage, there would be no point."
Cherene Marchant, internship
coordinator at the Stanford Ca
reer Planning and Placement Cen
ter, did not fmd the wording to be
as vague. She was surprised when
notified of the law.
"It had not come up before, but
it should still be an issue," she

said, pointing out that of 1,285 in
ternships in her database, 980
were paid.
She also noted that "a majority
of the unpaid internships fall into
the media area."
Most students also seem to be
in the dark about the law.
Jordan Gelber, a senior major
ing in drama and communication,
held an internship with Dateline
NBC two summers ago. He was
unpaid, only receiving reimburse
ment for his travel.
Gelber said the network bene
fited from his work. As an editori
al and technical intern, his duties
included research, participating in
shoots and assisting the producers
wherever necessary.
"I had no idea about the law be
cause (unpaid) internships are
such an institution in American
society," Gelber said.
Judy Sullivan, the internship
coordinator at NBC News, said
her office works in accordance
with New York state labor law.
"You have to be compensated
for your services," Sullivan said.
"Course credit is okay, and that is
what we do."
However, a federal act takes
precedence over state law. When
this was pointed out, Sullivan re
peated that NBC works with New
York state law.
An ABC News internship coor
dinator said all interns must prove
that they are receiving credit for
the internship. However, when in
formed of the Fair Labor Stan
dards Act, she said she did not
know about it. She then refused to
give her name.
Unenforced law
The long-standing law is rarely
enforced. Neither labor investiga
tor Yeskovich nor Kathy Noel, an
investigator in the Sacramento of
fice of the Department of Labor
Wage and Hour Division, could re
member a case specifically dealing
with interns.
One reason may be the common

misconception that as long as an
intern is receiving school credit for
an internship, he or she need not
be paid.
Dale Maharidge, a Communica
tion Department visiting lecturer,
said many newspapers are con
fused about the academic credit
issue. Many newspapers refuse to
take interns unless they have doc
umentation that the student will
receive school credit.
"If you are getting credit,
[media organizations] believe that
they are exempt from paying in
terns," he said.
According to Yeskovich, howev
er, the exemption is not valid.
"If [students are receiving]
credit, as long as an employment
relationship exists, it doesn't mat
ter," Yeskovich said, emphasizing
again that determinations are
made on a case-by-case basis. "If

all criteria of an employment rela
tionship have been met, the provi
sions of the (labor standards act]
may apply."

'You're using them,
and you're being used.'
— Dale Maharidge

Another reason for the lack of
understanding may stem from
confusion at the Labor Depart
ment.
Ericka Hatcher, a wage and
hour investigator in the Balti
more Labor Department office,
said unpaid internships are legal
as long as academic credit is being
given.
After checking regulations,
however, Hatcher said she had
been confused.

"If an intern is doing produc
tive work, then Ihe or she) must
be paid and is subject to receive
minimum wage and overtime
pay," she said, noting that the
only exception is for medical in
terns.
Possible repercussions
Some people are happy that the
law is not enforced. While com
panies like network television
stations and larger newspapers
can easily afford to pay interns,
paid internships would be impos
sible for some smaller compa
nies.
"If they decide to stick to this,
it could hurt internships," said
Marchant. "If it is pushed, it
might hurt students. It is hard to
draw the line."
Gelber agreed that enforce
ment could take away opportuni
ties for students.
"Nobody is going to pay you if
you do not have experience," he
said. "You're not on the same
level. When you deal with a big
media company like NBC, a studio
or a major newspaper, if you tell
them you can't hire unpaid in
terns, they'll want interns with ex
perience. Then where will we get
experience?"
However, Lerude disagreed,
saying there are plenty of reasons
to pay interns.
"If an agency calls looking for
an intern but say they have no
budget for one, I tell them they
should consider putting it in their
budget,"he said. "We have 10
places for every intern we've got.
You're going to get a better intern
if you pay."
Nonetheless, many students
seek out unpaid internships every
year.
"Internships are about unspo
ken connections," Gelber said.
"There's no price you can put on
that."
Maharidge summed up unpaid
internships best: "You're using
them, and you're being used."
