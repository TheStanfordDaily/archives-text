# College Board will change PSAT in '97
## 
### Cameron Doolittle 
Resolving the controversy that
males score better than females on
the Preliminary Scholastic Assess
ment Test, the College Board an
nounced Tuesday that it will in
clude a multiple-writing section
effective in October 1997.
However, Stanford officials say
the change should have little im
pact on admissions to the Univer
sity.
The Princeton, N.J.-based Col
lege Board began looking into the
possibility of adding a third sec
tion in 1990 when Derek Bok and
David Gardner, former presidents
of Harvard University and the
University of California respec
tively, released a report titled "Be
yond Prediction."
This report stressed the need to
"devise tests that emphasize sub
stantive knowledge as well as gen
eral ability while calling for skills
of problem-solving, writing and
the like."
The College Board had planned
to roll out its new section in 1999.
However, complaints from the Na
tional Center for Fair and Open
Testing, or Fairtest, in 1994 to the
U.S. Department of Education's
Office for Civil Rights alleged that
the PSAT was sexist.
Although the office found the
College Board had not violated any
statutes, the College Board agreed
to implement the changes in the
test two years sooner.
According to Janice Gans, as
sistant director of public affairs at
the College Board, the new section
will be weighted equally with the
verbal and math sections to deter
mine a student's score.

In 1995, males averaged 48.8
verbal and 50.8 math while their
female counterparts averaged
48.6 and 47.4. The verbal score on
the PSAT is doubled, so the aver
age male outscored the average fe
male by almost four points out of a
possible 180.
Supporters of the change be
lieve it will bridge the National
Merit Scholarship's 20-point gen
der gap — a scholarship that is de
termined in large part by a stu
dent's PSAT scores.
High PSAT scores qualify stu
dents for National Merit Scholar
ship competition. Students scor
ing well are placed into a semi-fi
nalist category where other fac
tors like grade-point average and
extracurricular involvement de
termine their final standing and
any scholarship award.
"One result may be that girls
score higher," said Elaine Detweil
er, public information director for
the National Merit organization.
"It may change the number of girls
in the semifinalist pool."
She stressed that the changes
are not intended to change out
comes but to incorporate more
skills necessary for college success.
According to Cynthia Rife, di
rector of student awards in Stan
ford's Financial Aids Office, the
shift is not expected to alter Stan
ford's admissions or financial aid
packages.
"We have lots of students who
get National Merit Scholarships
now," Rife said. Males and females
are not treated any differently by
the Financial Aids Office, so "it
wouldn't make any difference in
terms of individual aid packages,"
she said.
