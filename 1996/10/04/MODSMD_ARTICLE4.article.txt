# University official admits to role in recent fraternity bust
## Administrators insist procedures have not been changed 
### Marni Leff Staff writer 
A call from a University official
prompted Stanford Police to enter a
Sigma Chi party last month and cite at
least one student for underage drinking.

The call, documented
in material obtained by
The Daily, was made de
spite statements by sev
eral officials that there
has been no change to
their policy on underage
drinking. In response to
student concerns about
a crackdown, Stanford
Police Chief Marv Her-

rington told ASSU senators this week
that police generally will not investigate
campus parties unless they are called.
The police report filed for a minor in
possession of alcohol citation given at the
Sept. 21 party lists the reporting party as
Heather Dunn, assistant director of the
Office of Student Activities.
"I was dispatched to 550 Lasuen on
report of a loud party taking place with

minors present who were consuming al
cohol," wrote Stanford Police Officer
Adrienne Moore in the police report filed
for that citation. "The reporting party
was Heather Dunn, director of New Stu
dent Orientation... at Stanford Univer
sity."
Last week, Dunn told The Daily that
an anonymous tip led police to the Sigma
Chi party.
Dunn confirmed that she called the
police that evening and told them that
underage drinking was going on at the
Sigma Chi house.
"I am not out attending parties or
sending people undercover or any of the
other rumors that are out there," she
said.
According to Dean of Students Marc
Wais, the night of the Sigma Chi party
some freshmen informed Dunn that they
had been served alcohol at the Sigma Chi
party and that there were other fresh
men being served there. He explained
that after Dunn spoke to those students,
she called the police.
"She made the assessment that there
were students in harm's way and that

the situation had the potential to esca
late," Wais said. "She put in a phone cal
to the Stanford Police, which was the ap
propriate and responsible action. This ii
no deviation from what has happened ir
the past and is not a crackdown of anj
kind."
Fraternity members expressed sur
prise that Dunn had called the police.
"When I was called outside to speai
with the police, Heather [DunnJ and the
police were there," said Sigma Chi presi
dent Christian Nicks. "It surprised mete
hear that their presence was due to hei
request and not the other way around."
Stanford Police could potentially
issue citations for underage drinking at
any fraternity party, Herrington said
yesterday.
"We're not going to turn a blind eye or
things that are illegal," he said. "But hey,
on the other hand, we aren't going to use
all of our resources chasing underage
drinking. We have other things to be
doing, especially on the weekends."
Some fraternity members expressed


Wais
concern that police would actively
seek out and cite underage
drinkers. None would speak on the
record, however, for fear of reprisal
from the Office of Student Affairs.
"I hope the current trend does
not continue" was all that Inter

fraternity Council President and
Sigma Chi Craig Thomas would
say.
With a new phamplet on party
planning released to student orga
nizations this fall, Vice Provost
and Dean for Student Affairs Mary
Edmonds feels that guidelines are
clear from the beginning.
"I think it's just great," Ed
monds said of the pamphlet con
taining the party guidelines. "It's

now very clear the conditions
under which alcohol can be pre
sent and what the liability is."
Edmonds said she hopes an al
cohol task force created last spring
will produce a report this quarter.
"There is a need for law and
order on campus," Edmonds said
in a brief comment. "There are
laws against underage drinking,
and I think I'll leave it at that."
What may happens to their par

ties in the future, fraternity mem
bers agree, is unclear.
Theta Xi is the next fraternity to
host a party, scheduled for tonight.
Taxi president Daniel Ho said the
fraternity has talked with police
and fire department representa
tives about planning a safe party.
"Whenever there's a party, we
always have to be concerned," Ho
said. "We're hoping that things
will go well."
