About 20 women filled the Women's
Center lounge yesterday to hear Vice
Provost and Dean for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds address women's issues
and share a bit of her life story at the
first in the center's Brown Bag Lunch
Series.
The lunches are a way to bring
prominent women on campus into the
center to speak about their accomplish
ments.
"We invite women staff members and
faculty members to come speak with us
about development in their professional
careers," said Women's Center Coordi
nator Anne-Marie Nunez.
Edmonds was selected to speak at the
center because of her commitment to
women's issues. She helped the center
acquire permanent funding from the

University and worked to obtain perma
nent funding for a coed self-defense
class. In addition, Edmonds played a sig
nificant role in the acquisition of the
blue light emergency phones now in
place on campus.
Throughout her talk, Edmonds em
phasized the importance of women tak
ing risks in their careers, admitting that
"some of [my success] was serendipi
tous, but some of it was, 'OK, I'm willing
to take that risk.' Sometimes you just
put yourself out on a limb and the re
wards can be great."
Edmonds also said Stanford women
can find many role models on campus.
"There's a lot of women on campus
who could tell you how to make it in a
male-dominated situation," she said.
Edmonds' role models were closer to
home.
"My role models were my parents,"
she said as she passed around framed

pictures. Both of her
parents held graduate
degrees â€” unusual for
blacks in the 19205, she
said.
One of the more trau
matic moments in her
life occurred when her j
husband died two years
into their marriage in a
drowning accident. Ed-

mouds was> then lour months pregnant
with their daughter. Jacque.
"I had a reason to live because I was
going to give I my daughter] the best life
1 could," she said.
At that time, Edmonds planned to go
right back to work. However, her family
had different plans. They held a "family
council"and told her she was going back
to school instead.


Edmonds
As a former physical thera
pist with graduate degrees in so
ciology and medical sociology,
Edmonds has performed exten
sive research on how the older
black community, at one time,
showed a fear of hospitals and
lacked knowledge in basic
pathology.
"What you found was people
that were really sick but were
denying it," said Edmonds.
She said she saw diabetic
white females coming into the
hospital missing a toe or two, but
black diabetic women were miss

ing a limb. People were praying
to get better, she said, but they
were not seeking medical treat
ment.
"I saw religion as a dysfunc
tional coping mechanism," said
Edmonds, who will be presenting
a paper on this topic at a national
conference in Cleveland this
month.
Katie Chow, a volunteer at the
center, said she was pleased with
yesterday's turnout.
The Women's Center will host
Sally Dickson, director of the
Multicultural Development Of
fice, at the next lunch and will
conclude the quarter with Histo
ry Prof. Estelle Freedman, direc
tor of the Feminist Studies Pro
gram.
