# In check
## Tours show reality of EPA 
### Tsung-Pei Jennifer Chang Contributing writer 
Turning off Highway 101 onto University Av
enue, there is a part of town with broken pavement
and crumbling buildings. This is a small part of East
Palo Alto, a brief stretch of road that demonstrates
the great discrepancy between the poverty of this city
and the wealth of neighboring Palo Alto.
Pointing out the striking contrast between two
areas in such close proximity is the focus of Reality

Check Tours.
The 12-person, two-hour tours are led by Sue
Gray of the Haas Center for Public Service and Jim
Burklo of United Campus Christian Ministry. Lead
ers hope Stanford students and faculty attending the
tours will get a clear picture of the socio-economic re
ality of the area around campus.
"The poverty of East Palo Alto and the wealth of
Palo Alto is blatant." Burklo said. "The difference

makes people ask questions about
why this is the case, and the tours
provide the answers."
Gray and Burklo had each inde
pendently let! tours of East Palo
Alto. Discovering their common
goals, they collaborated to create
Reality Check Tours.
"When students volunteer in
East Palo Alto, they only see the
schools they tutor at," Gray said.
"They may not understand the con
text, the politics and the history of
the community. The tours help to
flesh out their knowledge and un
derstand how everything fits into
the big picture."
The tour begins with a look at El
Palo Alto Tree, an icon for the city
of Palo Alto.
The homeless masses camped
along a creek beside the tree sym
bolize the social problems plaguing
the community. From there, the
tour proceeds down University Av
enue, with a glimpse of the wealthi

er neighborhoods in the area. The
contrast is meant to be startling.
At the outset, the tours explain
the impact Stanford's development
has had on the surrounding com
munities.
The relationship between the
University and the cities of Palo
Alto and East P;ilo Alto goes back
far, Burklo explained. The estab
lishment of the University spurred
the creation of Palo Alto itself, and
parts of the city are University
property.
High residential incomes and
sales tax revenue from the Stanford
Shopping Center and other busi
nesses have helped make the town
wealthy.
East Palo Alto, on the other
hand, suffers from a lack of land
and resources. Through the years,
much of the tax-generating proper
ty in East Palo Alto has been trans
ferred to Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
The property transfer "left East
Palo Alto in a position where, when
it was ready to develop, it didn't
have land to create tax revenue
raising areas," Burklo said.
Through the years, East Palo

Alto became known for its poverty,
crime rate and low standard of liv
ing.
East Palo Alto is perhaps most
notorious for its 1992 claim to the
highest murder rate per capita in
the United States. However, Gray
and Burklo point out in their tours
that the communities in East Palo
Alto and neighboring areas are
making great strides toward im
proving the situation.
"When people noticed East Palo
Alto's high crime rate, leaders of
neighboring cities figured out this
was not just EPA's problem," Burk
lo said. "Now, there is lots of inter
community help to improve the sit
uation, and crime has gone down."
Pointing out common miscon
ceptions of East Palo Alto is also im
portant, Gray explained.
"There are wonderful things
going on in East Palo Alto that peo
ple do not realize," Gray said. "They
don't know about the city's agricul
tural history and beautiful things
created out of the cultural diversity,
like the lovely Vietnamese Buddhist
Church located there. Furthermore,
just as not all of Palo Alto is rich, not

all of East Palo Alto is poor."
Finally, the tours introduce par
ticipants to various nonprofit orga
nizations, such as Free At Last,
Plugged In and the East Palo Alto
Historical and Agricultural Society,
with the hope that students and fac
ulty will be inspired to take part in
the effort to improve East Palo
Alto.
"The tours deepen people's com
mitments to their involvement in
the community," Gray said. "It's
easy to spend four years here with
out knowing what is outside of cam
pus. The tours open up a spectrum
of possibilities that students can do
to help."
"It's inspiring to see how the
people of East Palo Alto have pulled
off improvements despite such
great obstacles," Burklo said.
"There's so much energy, and the
change taking place is very excit
ing.

A Reality Cheek tour will be held
next Wednesday from 3 p.m. to 5
p.m. Those interested must sign
up at the Haas Center or Campus
Christian Ministry.
