Polish poet wins Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — A shy, 73-year-old Polish poet
who disavowed her Stalinist past to become an inspiration for movie
makers and rock bands won the Nobel Prize for literature yesterday.
Wislawa Szymborska had gone for a walk in the southern Polish
holiday resort of Zakopane just before the Swedish Academy
announced the $1.12 million award.
M&Ms go technicolor
NEW YORK (AP) — M&M-Mars is expanding its 56-year-old
candy line to include 18 new colors that cross the spectrum.
The old standards — red, green, yellow, brown, orange and the
relatively new blue — now will compete with the likes of white and
black, pink and maroon, aqua and light yellow.
The new colors, however, will be sold only in specialty stores in 26
markets from Denver to the East Coast. The M&Ms, which come in
the plain chocolate variety, will not be sold in individual packages,
but rather by weight.
