You waited in line an hour to see this movie. Incredible opening! Heart
stopping action! Unbelievable tension! This is going to be... a great... a great...
oh no. Seated directly behind you. A talker. You can withstand many things.
People who drive 55 in the left lane. People with 10 items in the 8-items-only
checkout. But here you draw the line. Talking in movie theaters is
112 You paid seven bucks for this ticket. Seven bucks!
To the voice you say, "Could you please keep it down?"

friend. "Lib," she says. "Gome on," you implore. "Ifo," she says. "I've had it

object on her lap. What the...? Out Of th COm Pof your y ,

It's sleek. It's smooth. It's small. It's a...PDA? She's going to

You glance back. What the...? It's long. Round. Pointy. A... cone...
0f... silence? "PDA with a silencer," your girlfriend mutters.
Damn, that's good software.
