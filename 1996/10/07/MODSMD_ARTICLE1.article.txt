Even while last night's presidential debate
was still in progress, Stanford students seemed
convinced that President Clinton, if anyone,
was the evening's victor — but only because
Bob Dole's performance was so poor.
Junior Dale Yu, one of a small group watch
ing the debate in the Twain lounge, gave a fair
ly representative reaction. "Bob Dole's getting
schooled," he said. "It kind of hurts to watch

him."
Other reactions were in the same vein.
Matt Blumenstein, a freshman Republican
watching in Arroyo's lounge: "I think Dole's
being pathetic. I think he's burying himself."
Joel Monschke, a freshman Democrat in the
Branner lounge: "Bob Dole struck me as kind
of old and a bit senile."
Sabra Mazzaferro, an Arroyo freshman,
made possibly the most damning remark: "He
reminds me of Nixon." Richard Nixon's nar
row 1960 loss to John F. Kennedy is largely at

tributed to Kennedy's superior performance in
the first televised presidential debate.
Other students, though, were disappointed
by the performances of both candidates.
"I was disgusted with both of them," said se
nior Shawn Wrobel, a Republican who'd had
enough and stopped watching the debate
halfway through. "I'm not going to vote for ei
ther of them."

first presidential debate. The segment will be broadcast later this week.
the Green Party, expressed a simi
lar sentiment. He only kept watch
ing, he said, because the debate
made for entertaining television.
"It was like watching Seinfeld —
funny."
But the big excitement of the
night, for Stanford students at
least, wasn't in the Hartford,
Conn., Bushnell Theater, but
rather in Kimball Hall. There, the
pull of the television lights — word
had spread that an ABC News cam
era crew would be on hand to cap
ture students' reactions — lured
more than 100 people to the dorm's
lounge, where they were taped re

spectfully watching the debate.
Respectfully, that is, until Dole,
in his closing remarks, pointed view
ers to his World Wide Web site. The
computer-sawy audience exploded
in laughter as the septuagenarian
Republican stumbled his way
through a mess of W's, dots and
ORGs.
The ABC crew taped student re
actions during the debate and inter
viewed some students on their opin
ions of the candidates' perfor
mances afterwards. The material
was shot for this evening's broad
cast of "World News Tonight with
Peter Jennings," according to Liz
Thornton, a news editor for ABC in
Los Angeles. "World News Tonight"
will air at 5 p.m. on KGO-TV,Chan
nel 7 (Channel 27 on Stanford's
cable system).
