## Clinton, Dole square off Candidates debate the role of federal government 
### 
HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Presi
dent Clinton and Bob Dole clashed vigor
ously over the role of the federal govern
ment, tax cuts, Medicare and the
strength of the economy last night in a
prime-time debate critical to the Repub
lican challenger's comeback hopes.
Standing just a few feet apart on a
red-carpeted stage, Clinton and Dole
challenged each other again and again
during a 90-minute showdown that ush
ered in the final month of the White
House campaign.
Their fast-paced exchanges were
often pointed and ranged from the caus
es of rising teen drug use to the role of
the American military at the dawn of the
21st century.
"I trust the people; the president
trusts the government," Dole said in try
ing to cast the Democratic incumbent as
a liberal hiding behind conservative elec
tion-year rhetoric. Dole pointedly
recalled the president's 1994 health-care
initiative "he wanted to impose on the
American people."

Clinton ignored the criticism of that
failed proposal but offered a vigorous
defense of his record — and of what he
said was carefully targeted government
activism
"We are better off than we were four
years ago — let's keep it going," Clinton
said in taking credit for 10 million new
jobs and making his case for a second
term.
Dole, clearly nervous in the debate's
opening minutes, disagreed. Under Clin
ton, he said, "Americans are working
harder and paying higher taxes."
Trailing by significant margins in
most national and key state polls, Dole
was running short of time to build sup
port for a Republican campaign
anchored on a promise to cut taxes by 15
percent and the theme that Clinton is a
"warmed over liberal."
Clinton held fast to his assertion that
the "Dole-Gingrich" 1995 Republican
budget would have devastated Medicare.
Dole retorted: "Stop scaring the seniors,
Mr. President." He said the GOP budget

increased spending on Medicare, just not
as much as Democrats wanted.
Dole vigorously promoted his $548
billion tax cut plan, saying it was time to
put more money in the pockets of every
day working Americans. "I want the gov
ernment to pinch pennies for a change
instead of the American families," Dole
said.
Clinton called it a "$550 billion tax
scheme" that would either make the
deficit explode or require unacceptable
cuts in Medicare and education.
There was an early light moment on
this subject, as Dole told moderator Jim
Lehrer he would get the tax cut, and "so
will the former president." Clinton
laughed and said, "I need it."
Dole also took aim at Clinton's foreign
policy. "Saddam Hussein is better off
than he was four years ago," Dole said of
the Iraqi dictator. Further, Dole said,
Clinton had been too soft on Communist
regimes in Cuba and North Korea. Clin
ton countered that the criticisms were
off base.
