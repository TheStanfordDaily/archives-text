Tiger wins Las Vegas tourney
LAS VEGAS (AP) — Tiger Woods, staking his first claim
to greatness as a pro, parred the first playoff hole yesterday
to beat Davis Love 111 and win the Las Vegas Invitational in
only his fifth tournament as a pro.
Woods watched with arms folded as Love missed a six
foot putt on the first playoff hole to give him the win and the
$297,000 first prize. He overpowered the par-5s to shoot 64
and take the lead in the clubhouse.
The three-time U.S. Amateur champion then went
straight to the driving range to hit practice shots in antici
pation of a playoff that came after Love made eagle on 15
and birdie on 16.

Pope admitted to hospital
VATICAN CITY (AP) — Patients in casts and bandages
crowded into windows and balconies yesterday to greet Pope
John Paul II as he entered a Rome hospital for an operation
to remove an inflamed appendix.
The operation will be tomorrow morning, said hospital
spokesman Giuseppe Pallanch.
The pope's recurring bouts of fevers and the loss of his
once-boundless vigor have led to open speculation that he
suffers from a more serious illness. The Vatican has denied
every report about a chronic condition.
Get-well cards may be sent to: Pope John Paul 11, 00120
Vatican City.
