## Editorial Advances in advising 
### 
Undergraduate Advising
Center deserves praise for
implementing services

AS FRESHMEN PONDER
the values of taking advanced
writing or calculus courses,
sophomores consider applying for
sophomore seminars, juniors try to
fit studying abroad into their four
years at Stanford, and seniors fret
over just what they will do when
those four years come to an end, it is
clear that many undergraduates
share a common need: academic
advising.
To help serve these needs, the
Undergraduate Advising Center
has expanded its efforts to serve
those students who may not ven
ture into Sweet Hall. Responding to
the Commission on Undergraduate
Education's recommendations for
increased faculty involvement in
advising, a task force assigned to
look at restructuring Stanford's
advising system offered the center
several suggestions, which have
been implemented this year.
The center has hired a new
undergraduate advising director,
Lori White, who will be responsible
for bringing advising into dormito
ries and academic departments to
ensure more accessibility for stu
dents.
In addition, the center has intro
duced new services, including an
advising hotline, an e-mail hotline
and a "froshline."
The center also held an adviser
training session concerning recent
changes in the curriculum, includ
ing the switch from the distribution
requirements system to the new
general education requirements
system, the new language require
ment and the institution of the
minor.
These changes represent an
important move toward making
Stanford's advising system more
meaningful than obtaining a code
from an adviser late Sunday night

when class lists are due.
For freshmen, who arguably have
the most questions for academic
advisers, academic advice will be
available between those scheduled
dorm dinners with faculty advisers.
Moreover, declared students who
only have advisers in their major
department, will be able to ask
questions about academic options in
other departments. For example,
those upperclassmen working to fill
certain DRs or wondering what
double-majoring versus minoring
entails will now have several outlets
to turn to for information.
The aim for making advising
accessible (i.e. available outside the
walls of Sweet Hall) is also an
important move. Entering this
large building for the first time to
search out someone who knows the
difference between Chem 31 and
Chem 32 can be intimidating. Offer
ing such information in a hotline
fashion will surely ease new stu
dents into the advising system.
Moreover, offering these hotlines
and dorm advising suits students'
schedules better. Students typically
have classes, labs, practices and
other activities during the day. Since
Sweet Hall maintains normal office
hours, having these other advising
options available later in the day is a
beneficial move for students.
One concern, though, that has
yet to be addressed and changed by
the center is the freshman advising
system. Yes, there are some
informed, reachable faculty advis
ers out there, but many freshmen
complain that their advisers lack
knowledge about classes, the GER
system and majors.
While these new advising
changes are positive steps, they can
not replace the potential for mean
ingful, personal connections with
faculty advisers.
The center should be commend
ed for its changes to the advising
system and should use these as
first positive steps on the road to
an accessible, informational advis
ing system for freshmen, as well as
the entire undergraduate student
body.
