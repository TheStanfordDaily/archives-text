## STV causes Stanford's dip 
### 
WHILE APPLYING TO colleges,
I was acutely aware of the cor
relation between the U.S. News
& World Report's college rankings and
my future success. I came to Stanford
because it was No. 4 — 10 spots higher
than the next college willing to accept
me. My future was so bright I bought
shades and started saving for a condo in
Russian Hill. But now, quite suddenly,
Stanford has plummeted to No. 6.
That's right. Stanford is now only 60
percent as good as it was a year ago. Why
oh why has this happened? Why has
Andersen Consulting stopped stalking
me? Why has my credit line been sev
ered? Is it Stanford's large classes? An
East Coast bias? Condoleezza Rice's
reluctance to get the Rachel 'do?
No. Stanford's fall from prominence
can be summed up in two words: in-room
cable.
STV seemed so innocent at first. For a
couple of bucks a month, you received a
limitless source of mindless entertain
ment which you could watch from the
comfort of your own bed. You might
watch a little more TV than you normal
ly would have, but you no longer had to
waste time walking down to the lounge.
They even billed you later.
Unfortunately the lure of cable pro
gramming was much stronger than any
one ever imagined. One by one, Stan
ford's strident intellectuals have traded
their textbooks for TV Guides and suc
cumbed to cable TV's tempting fruits. A
friend of mine who wished to be identi

fied by the name "Dave" took time out
during a commercial break to issue the
following statement:
"Last fall I started watching Sports-
Center a couple of nights a week. 'It's
cool — the problem set can wait until
after El Centro,' I rationalized. It
wasn't long until the Dukes of Hazzard
and MTV's Singled Out filled my after
noons. By spring quarter I was spend
ing the entire day chillin' on the couch,
rapidly developing boobs in front of the
boob tube. Predictably my grades suf
fered. I thought I could bring them
back up by changing my major to Com
munication and enrolling in classes
offered on SITN. But even during my
classes I would catch myself watching
Ricki Lake during the commercials.
You go, Ricki!"
Dave's room is a dark, musty place. He
has removed the light bulbs from his
overhead lights and nailed plywood over
his windows to magnify the glorious glow
of the television. Ninety percent of
Dave's time is spent in a semiconscious
state. He generally holds the remote con
trol with one hand, while stroking the
cable wire with the other. Occasionally,
Dave glances affectionately at the cable
wire and utters the phrase "my pre
cious." Dave only eats food which con
tains cheese, and he is not, in my estima
tion, a serious student.
Indeed, Dave and his "Fried Green
Tomatoes"-watching ilk are indicative of
the decline of Stanford's academic stan
dards. In an informal survey of residents

of the "Roble Penthouse," I discovered
several startling statistics which demon
strate the destructive effects of cable.
• Forty percent of the papers written for
Greek Mythology last spring included
references to the syndicated Hercules
television series.
• Thirty-two percent of Stanford stu
dents can identify more than two charac
ters from Mork and Mindy.
• Only 46 percent of incoming freshmen
use the term "up all night" to describe a
studying technique.
• Twenty-three percent of Stanford's
Spanish language majors report using
Sabado Gigante as a study tool.
Given these opprobrious statistics,
one might think the University would
take some active steps to reverse this
trend.
Stanford's "don't ask, don't tell"
cable TV policy needs to be amended.
Until that can happen, try and watch
out for your friends. Get them off the
tube and back into the 24-hour study
room where they belong. Let's all do
everything we can to get Stanford into
the top five before graduation because
we should only be ranked below Duke in
basketball.
