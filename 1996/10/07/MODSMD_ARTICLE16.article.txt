Stanford students should appreciate ethernet cost, speed

I'M QUITE AMAZED at your attitude
toward ethernet and modems in the
editorial in Wednesday's Daily.
For the last year it almost seems like
the media has been talking about nothing
but the World Wide Web and connecting
to it with 14.4 modems, 28.8 modems,
33.6 modems and ISDN modems, with
costs ranging from hundreds of dollars to
thousands. Most people can only dream of
being able to connect to the Web at ISDN
speeds.
We at Stanford get to connect to the
Internet at a speed that's a hundred times
faster even than ISDN, at a cost (aver
aged over the year) of only $5 per month.
What do we say about this? We com
plain. We say we'd rather use a modem.

How typically Stanford.
At $33 for installation, plus $13 a
month for nine months service, a year's
phone service costs you $150. Every time
you make a long distance call on the
phone, they charge you more money for
that too. A year's ethernet service costs
only $45 and there's no charge every time
you send a long-distance e-mail or access
a Web site. If you're going to complain
about the cost of something, complain
about the cost of telephone service, not
networking.
As to the your complaints about all the
poor students who bought modems over
the summer, why? New students are
advised to wait until they get to Stanford
before spending money on computer pur

chases, both because the Bookstore has
discount prices and because it's in their
best interest to wait to see what the com
puting environment is here before they
waste money on possibly unnecessary
computer purchases.
If you arrive on campus and find
you're living two doors from the dorm
computer cluster with a fast 600 dpi net
worked laser printer, you're going to feel
a bit silly if you wasted your money buy
ing one of your own as well. Complaining
that they bought modems over the sum
mer is like complaining that they bought
a horse and carriage instead of a car, and
now they're surprised to find that Stan
ford dorms don't provide stables for stu
dent horses.

A friend of mine recently graduated
and left student housing. He hadn't quite
realized until then how much he'd taken
for granted having a high-speed network
connection. About a month later, while
talking to me, he said, "Stanford showed
me the future, and then they took it away
from me."
Most countries in the world don't have
10 megabits per second for their entire
nation's connection to the Internet, but
Stanford students have that much to
their personal computer in their own
room. Let's try to remember how incredi
bly privileged we are at Stanford.
