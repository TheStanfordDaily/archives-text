# Daily's editorial about ethernet policy changes contained factual errors
## 
### 
I'm writing to correct two factual
errors in Wednesday's editorial column
"Dial-in Access Denied." First, the
policy that blocks dial-in access in certain
student residences was not established
by Residential Computing. It's the policy
of Distributed Computing and Commu
nication Systems (DCCS), the group that
provides Stanford's network, telephone
and cable TV service. DCCS manages the

campus modem pool. Residential Com
puting staff did participate in the discus
sion that led to the decision and advised
us which dorms have the capacity to pro
vide ethernet service to 100 percent of
their occupants (the so-called "port-per
pillow" standard). The policy was jointly
developed by DCCS and the Infrastruc
ture Advisory Group, the faculty com
mittee that advises us on issues related
to data communications.
Second, the editorial states that "elim
ination of lower-speed access ... opened
up phone numbers that could have been
used to maintain the high levels of dial
in activity." In fact, that's exactly what
DCCS did do. In January, using equip-

ment that used to provide low-speed ser
vice, DCCS increased dial-in capacity
from 252 to 312 simultaneous connec
tions. This extra capacity was immedi
ately absorbed by the community's
demand for dial-in service. The contin
ued difficulty dialing in during winter
and spring quarters led to the policy of
blocking access to dorms with "port per
pillow" ethernet service.
The change is intended to improve
service to the thousands of students and
faculty who live off campus. It's too soon
to evaluate the success of this decision,
but the number of busy signals has
declined markedly.
I do agree with the editorial's conclu

sion that students should be alerted to
changes in network access policies well in
advance of their implementation. DCCS
did attempt to notify people in May and
June about the plan to change modem
access in September. We even ran ads in
The Daily. But clearly our message
didn't reach enough people. We'll do bet
ter in the future. Information about the
change in modem access, including ways
to acquire inexpensive ethernet equip
ment, can be found on the Residential
Computing Web page. See
