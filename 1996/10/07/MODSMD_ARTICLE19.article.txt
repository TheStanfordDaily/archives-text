### Perry Chen Contributing writer 
Members of the Stanford community com
memorated the historic 1912 visit to Stanford
by Abdu'l-Baha, one of the major figures of the
Baha'i Faith, at a Memorial Church gathering
Saturday evening.
The event consisted of music, readings,
prayers and a keynote address by David Smith
of the University of Toronto on the issue of
moral leadership in contemporary civilization.
On Oct. 8, 1912, Abdu'l-Baha, upon the in
vitation of then-University President David
Starr Jordan, gave an address titled, "To the
World of Science."
Abdu'l-Baha, the son of Baha'i founder
Baha'u'llah, covered topics including "the har
mony of science and religion, the unity of reli
gion and international peace" in his address,
according to senior Nava Ashraf, a member of
the Stanford Baha'i Community.
The Baha'i faith has more than 6 million
members worldwide located in hundreds of
countries and territories, making it the second
most diverse independent religion in the world,
said Baha'i community member Eric Stout, a
student at the Graduate School of Business.
Members of the Baha'i Faith believe there is

only one God and that all the world's religions
and peoples should be united.
Smith's keynote address focused on moral
leadership as the means to achieving peace and
unity among humankind. Smith said leader
ship is constructed out of people's ideas of hu
manity in response or in anticipation to the so
cial needs of the time.
Because leadership is dynamic, "the histori
cal version of leadership may not be applicable
today," said Smith.
Noting that today's world is, historically
speaking, at a critical juncture, Smith empha
sized that "a new vision for future growth and
development is required. ... A new under
standing of humankind and leadership is re
quired."
This new kind of thinking is embodied in
Bah&'u'llah's teachings, said Smith. With
unity a lasting peace can be created, but unity
requires moral leadership.
"The human spirit has been endowed with
the intellect and wisdom to shape civilization,"
he said. "Today the individual must be devoted
to social good and the cause of peace and well
being."
In trying to define moral leadership, Smith
pointed out the sharp contrast between the
historical notion of moral goodness and what is

needed in today's world.
"The old moral being was 'a good person' be
cause they stayed out of trouble," Smith said.
"The new moral being promotes social good
and has the capability to seek moral action."
Listing the characteristics required for
moral leadership, Smith said effective leaders
must possess a world-embracing vision,
courage, humility and a willingness to serve
others. Because everyone is capable of possess
ing these qualities, anyone can be a leader, said
Smith.
Baha'i community member Chris Baskett,
commenting on Smith's address, contrasted
the Bahd'f approach to leadership with the tra
ditional approach.
"The old way of thinking was based on as
sumptions of human nature which diminu
tized and controlled people," Baskett said.
"The new way of looking at human beings ex
alts human nature."
The Stanford Bah&'i Community has about
25 members, according to Stout. The organiza
tion holds discussions on various religious and
nonreligious writings at noon Fridays in Toyon
Hall.
"The basic focus of the discussions is on
unity," Stout said. "We are all trying to seek
the truth together."
