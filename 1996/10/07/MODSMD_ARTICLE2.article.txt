# Engineering dept. draws more women
## Women represent record one-third of incoming petroleum engineering class 
### Martin Zemitis 
The Petroleum Engineering Department, in a
dramatic demographic shift, has recruited more
female students this year than ever before.
One-third of 24 incoming graduate students
are women, compared with only two last year.
"Women as a rule are underrepresented in
technical fields," said Prof. Roland Home, chair
of the department. "This is a tremendous and
unaffordable waste of talent and creates a sense

of self-perpetuation. We are trying to restore the
balance."
Rosalind Archer is a prime example of the new
direction in the department. Having recently re
turned from her fourth summer job in New
Zealand, she eagerly looks forward to studying
petroleum engineering as a graduate student at
Stanford.
"Being a female in a predominantly male en
vironment is definitely not a problem," she said.
Despite the increase in the number of female

students, the department stil! lacks female facul
ty. In the last 10 years, no woman has lectured in
the department, Home said.
"We have been trying hard to hire a female
lecturer, but most women with qualifications in
our field are at high demand," he said.
The Petroleum Engineering Department has
a long tradition of producing oil industry leaders
for countries all across the globe, according to
