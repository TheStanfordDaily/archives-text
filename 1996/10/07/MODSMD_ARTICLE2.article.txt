# Engineering dept. draws more women
## Women represent record one-third of incoming petroleum engineering class 
### Martin Zemitis 
The Petroleum Engineering Department, in a
dramatic demographic shift, has recruited more
female students this year than ever before.
One-third of 24 incoming graduate students
are women, compared with only two last year.
"Women as a rule are underrepresented in
technical fields," said Prof. Roland Home, chair
of the department. "This is a tremendous and
unaffordable waste of talent and creates a sense

of self-perpetuation. We are trying to restore the
balance."
Rosalind Archer is a prime example of the new
direction in the department. Having recently re
turned from her fourth summer job in New
Zealand, she eagerly looks forward to studying
petroleum engineering as a graduate student at
Stanford.
"Being a female in a predominantly male en
vironment is definitely not a problem," she said.
Despite the increase in the number of female

students, the department stil! lacks female facul
ty. In the last 10 years, no woman has lectured in
the department, Home said.
"We have been trying hard to hire a female
lecturer, but most women with qualifications in
our field are at high demand," he said.
The Petroleum Engineering Department has
a long tradition of producing oil industry leaders
for countries all across the globe, according to
Home. Some distinguished alumni
include the chair of the Petroleum
Engineering Department at
Ankara University in Turkey and
the head of the main petroleum
management organization in Pak
istan.
In the spirit of keeping up with
the diversity of the today's interna
tional energy industry, the depart
ment maintains a 80 percent inter
national student rate, creating a

cultural and ethnic diversity that is
unique on campus, Home said.
The students of the 1996 petro
leum engineering class come from
12 different countries.
Besides increasing the diversity
of the student body, the depart
ment is striving to broaden the cur
riculum. This year they are adding
an environmental component to
their classes.
This reinforced curriculum
would allow graduates even more
flexibility in their job placements.
Stanford graduates have shown a
steady trend of almost 100 percent
job placement upon graduation.
