## Runners win invitational 
### Gil Lopez 
Despite holding back top runners for the 32nd an
nual Stanford Invitational on Saturday, the cross coun
try team still managed to breeze to solid victories in
both of the mayor races.
In order to preserve some of the Cardinal's top com
petitors for future meets, Coach Vin Lananna chose to
keep senior David Dyer, sophomore Brad Hauser and
senior J.J. White out of the race on Saturday. Dyer has
led the Cardinal men this year with convincing victo
ries at both the San Diego State and Nevada Invita
tionals earlier this season.
"We were resting a few runners for the future,"
Lananna said. "But we still had to post a good team be
cause those are good teams we were running against.
(Senior Greg) Jimmerson and (junior Nathan) Nutter
both had excellent days."
The harriers did not allow the fact that they were a
little short-handed stop them from easily beating the
rest of the field. In the Men's Invitational 8,000-meter
race, Jimmerson led the Cardinal by taking second
place with a time of 24 minutes, 58 seconds â€” 24 ticks
behind the winner, Meb Keflezighi of UCLA.
"I think that our race on Saturday gives the team a
lot of confidence, especially since we have so many run
ners that can do that well," Jimmerson said. "Even
though not everyone ran and we kind of split the team
we still put out good performances.
"The guys that sat out have practiced with the rest
of the team so they know where they stand and how
they should be racing. I think now the team is ready to
go and they have a positive attitude for our next few
meets."
Nutter (25:02) and junior Jason Perscheid (25:15)
followed closely for most of the race as they took third
and fourth, respectively, in overall competition. Jason
Lunn and Jason Balkman rounded out the Cardinal
top five with times of 25:25 and 25:31, respectively.
As a team, the men combined for 27 points, easily
beating second-place Brigham Young, who finished
with 92 points. Cal Poly-Pomona rounded out the top
three with 168 points.
