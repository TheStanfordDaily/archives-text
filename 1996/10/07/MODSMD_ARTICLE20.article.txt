## Runners win invitational 
### Gil Lopez 
Despite holding back top runners for the 32nd an
nual Stanford Invitational on Saturday, the cross coun
try team still managed to breeze to solid victories in
both of the mayor races.
In order to preserve some of the Cardinal's top com
petitors for future meets, Coach Vin Lananna chose to
keep senior David Dyer, sophomore Brad Hauser and
senior J.J. White out of the race on Saturday. Dyer has
led the Cardinal men this year with convincing victo
ries at both the San Diego State and Nevada Invita
tionals earlier this season.
"We were resting a few runners for the future,"
Lananna said. "But we still had to post a good team be
cause those are good teams we were running against.
(Senior Greg) Jimmerson and (junior Nathan) Nutter
both had excellent days."
The harriers did not allow the fact that they were a
little short-handed stop them from easily beating the
rest of the field. In the Men's Invitational 8,000-meter
race, Jimmerson led the Cardinal by taking second
place with a time of 24 minutes, 58 seconds — 24 ticks
behind the winner, Meb Keflezighi of UCLA.
"I think that our race on Saturday gives the team a
lot of confidence, especially since we have so many run
ners that can do that well," Jimmerson said. "Even
though not everyone ran and we kind of split the team
we still put out good performances.
"The guys that sat out have practiced with the rest
of the team so they know where they stand and how
they should be racing. I think now the team is ready to
go and they have a positive attitude for our next few
meets."
Nutter (25:02) and junior Jason Perscheid (25:15)
followed closely for most of the race as they took third
and fourth, respectively, in overall competition. Jason
Lunn and Jason Balkman rounded out the Cardinal
top five with times of 25:25 and 25:31, respectively.
As a team, the men combined for 27 points, easily
beating second-place Brigham Young, who finished
with 92 points. Cal Poly-Pomona rounded out the top
three with 168 points.
" I think this was a good opportu
nity for us," Perscheid said. "It was
the first invitational we had where
we battled national powerhouses. It
was a good introduction to the na
tional level for us this year. By no
means was it an amazing victory,
but we went out and we got the job
done. This sets us up for upcoming
meets where we'll have to face the
top teams in the country."
Perscheid said the fact that a few
runners were rested for the day
only illustrates the depth which the
team has.
"It was a good feeling to hold
some of our better runners out and
still win, but we don't concern our
selves with who's running that day
and who's not," Perscheid said.
"Whatever seven we put on the
line are our team. They just have to
get the job done. It's more like the
team we put out that day is the
best team we have for that day and
they have to get the job done. We
just field whatever team we've
got."
In the Women's Invitational
race, junior Kortney Dunscombe
led the Cardinal women, taking
third in the 5,000-meter race with a
time of 17:29. Kim Hortensen
(16:52) of UCLA and Courtney
Fugmire (17:27) of Brigham Young
finished first and second, respec
tively.
Sophomore Mary Cobb and ju
nior Jessica Fry took fourth and

fifth, respectively, each crossing the
finish line in 17:38. Junior Sarna
Renfro (17:43) and senior Monal
Chokshi (17:45) scored the rest of
the points for the cardinal- and
white-clad women while finishing
eighth and ninth, respectively.
The team finished with 29
points, 16 ahead of second-place
Brigham Young. UCLA finished a
distant third with 129 points.
"I think [the victory] shows that
Stanford is becoming a cross coun
try powerhouse," Renfro said.
"This year we have the depth we re
ally need. We're not just seven
strong, we're 15 or 20 strong.
That's what we really need to com
pete.
"If we were relying on only three
or four or five people, something
could go wrong, but we have lots
more to back us up."
One men's and one women's
team will be sent to race at the Uni
versity of Maine next weekend be
fore moving on to the Arizona Wild
cat Invitational at Tucson, Ariz.,
and the Cal Poly Mustang Invita
tional in San Luis Obispo, both on
Oct. 19. The men will send one
squad of runners to each of the
meets, but the women will skip the
Wildcat Invitational and only field a
team in San Luis Obispo.
"We had a lot accomplished
today," Lananna said. "[Women's
assistant coach] Beth Alford-Sulli
van and I are both honored with the
way the women put themselves to
gether today. They handled them
selves great. We have a great cross
country year ahead of us."
