# Hockey wins sixth straight
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The unstoppable Stanford field hockey team
captured the Pacific Tigers in an overwhelming 3-0
match on Saturday that brought its Northern Pa
cific Conference record to 6-1.
The Cardinal once again dominated the game,
keeping the ball in front the UOP goal for most of
the first half while tallying a total of 30 shots on
goal for the match.
Sophomore forward Monique Leroux completed
Stanford's first successful attack with an unassist
ed goal 10 minutes into the game. Sophomore for
ward / midfielder Sarah Medeiros struck next for
the Card with a goal assisted by sophomore mid
fielder Jordyn Kramer.
Stanford stretched its lead to three just before
the half when senior tri-captain Amy Marfil put one
in the net, assisted by junior midfielder Paige
Mader.
Although the Tigers' offense came back stronger
in the second half with six consecutive penalty cor
ners, an offensive play that allows a direct shot at
the opponent's goal, the contest was clearly anoth
er Cardinal-governed match.
Coach Sheryl Johnson said
the Tigers attack was "good
practice for the defense," show
ing that the Cardinal was in con
trol throughout the contest even
though the ball was not always
under Stanford command in the
scoreless second half.
"We wanted to put together a
game in which we played 100
percent the whole game,"
Kramer said. "We came out
strong in the first half, but we
slowed down in the second half.
We didn't put as much into the
second half as we could have."
Sophomore defender Stephanie
Finkelstein, who played an "awe
some" game according to Johnson,
said the Cardinal members were
not going to the ball as much in the
second half.
"I think we were being a little
tentative," Finkelstein said.
But even in the less-aggres
sive second half, the Cardinal
was clearly in control of the
game. Its 3-0 advantage was
never seriously threatened by
the Tiger attack.
Johnson experimented with
different lineups which allowed
members to play outside their
normal positions while letting
the entire roster put its skills to
the test.
"We had a lot of freshmen
that haven't gotten much play
ing time," Johnson said. "Also,

Lull team members] have been
practicing a lot of shooting, and
we had some defense play for
ward positions so everyone could
have a chance to score."
Sure enough, Johnson's strat
egy proved to be effective as
freshman defender Mallory
Chamber scored her first varsity
goal.
"It was a great feeling,"
Chamber said. "I've been shoot
ing a lot, but they haven't been
going in, so it was nice to have
one finally go in."
Pacific coach Carla Konet de
scribed the Stanford squad as a
skillful team that is "quick with
sticks, excellent in rebounds and
deadly in front of the goal."
"They make no mistakes, and
while we weren't able to com
plete any of our plays, they fin
ished [their plays] through,"
Konet said.
Konet said the Tigers lost mo
mentum in the first half when
they were forced to take out sev
eral starters due to injuries. She
also commented that the Tigers
defensive line was not in top con
dition and surrendered the ball
to the Cardinal on numerous oc
casions.
Despite UOP's troubles be
fore intermission, Konet found a
silver lining to the afternoon in
the team's performance after the
break.
"I think we picked up (our
game) in the second half, and I
am happy with the way we
played," Konet said.
