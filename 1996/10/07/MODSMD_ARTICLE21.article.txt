The unstoppable Stanford field hockey team
captured the Pacific Tigers in an overwhelming 3-0
match on Saturday that brought its Northern Pa
cific Conference record to 6-1.
The Cardinal once again dominated the game,
keeping the ball in front the UOP goal for most of
the first half while tallying a total of 30 shots on
goal for the match.
Sophomore forward Monique Leroux completed
Stanford's first successful attack with an unassist
ed goal 10 minutes into the game. Sophomore for
ward / midfielder Sarah Medeiros struck next for
the Card with a goal assisted by sophomore mid
fielder Jordyn Kramer.
Stanford stretched its lead to three just before
the half when senior tri-captain Amy Marfil put one
in the net, assisted by junior midfielder Paige
Mader.
Although the Tigers' offense came back stronger
in the second half with six consecutive penalty cor
ners, an offensive play that allows a direct shot at
the opponent's goal, the contest was clearly anoth
er Cardinal-governed match.
