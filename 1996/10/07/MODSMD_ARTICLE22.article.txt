# Card survives Cal, falls to Olympians
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
Stanford junior outside hitter Kristin Folkl wasn't
kidding when she said California plays to win.
The fourth ranked Stanford women's volleyball
team (12-1, 5-0 Pacific 10 Conference) almost
watched its 38-match home winning streak vaporize
Friday night against the unranked Bears (3-8, 0-5
Pac-10). The Cardinal squeezed out a 12-15,15-7,15-

7, 13-15, 18-16 win against a squad that many
thought would not offer Stanford much competition.
The scrappy Cal team proved early that it would
not roll over and die to the heavily favored Card, who
was playing without junior All-American setter Lisa
Sharpley. After Stanford opened the first game with
an 11-8 lead, the Bears stormed back to win 15-12.
"We dominated the match at times," coach Don
Shaw said. "But there were a couple of streaks in
there that really cost us. The streak at the end of game
one turned that game around."
The Cardinal rebounded in game two with a strong
performance, hitting .520 as a team. Stanford ran
over the Bears, winning the second game 15-7. The
Card continued to control Cal in the third game, as
Folkl and freshman outside hitter Kerri Walsh over
powered the Bears' defense.
With the first game far behind them, the Cardinal
women appeared on the verge of finishing off the
Bears in game four. Stanford jumped out to a 13-8
lead, only to watch as an inspired CaJ squad scored the
last seven points to pull out a 15-13 victory.
The Bears' momentum continued into game five,
as they took a commanding 8-1 lead using rally scor
ing. But the Cardinal proved its mettle by battling
back to tie the match 13-13 before Walsh made a kill
to give Stanford the deciding fifth game 18-16.
"You change sides at 8-1 in rally scoring, and pret
ty much it's a lost cause," Shaw said. "But we battled
back, and we made the plays we had to make. It was
an unbelievable comeback."
On Saturday evening Stanford faced off against
the U.S. National Team in the first of a six-match ex
hibition for the Olympic squad. The nationally tele
vised match featured Stanford alumnae Kristen
Klein and Bev Oden returning to the home of their
collegiate glory, and Folkl, the Olympic squad's first
alternate, playing against her former teammates.
At Stanford, Klein was a four-time All-American
and the 1991 national player of the year. She also be
came the first player in Pac-10 history to earn a spot
on the all-conference squad for four consecutive
years. Klein also holds the Stanford record for kills
(1,909) and digs (1,456).
Oden, who played alongside her sister and fellow
Olympian Elaina, also earned All-American status for
her four-year stay on the Farm and holds the all-time
Pac-10 record for hitting percentage (.338).
The match started in classic fashion, as Bev Oden
elevated for a kill, only to have Folkl stufTher ard give
Stanford the game's first point. Team USA returned
the favor to Folkl, blocking the Cardinal outside hit
ter's first kill attempt.
"It was nice to be back in Maples Pavilion," Bev
Oden said. "[Folkl] is really fun, she played really
well, and she was working us a little bit. She is a great
player; we like her."
Team USA jumped out to an early 8-1 lead, forcing
the Cardinal to call for time. Both squads played stel
lar defense, but the Olympians seemed to dig balls
that under normal circumstances would have result
ed in easy Stanford kills. The Cardinal fought valiant

ly, but fell to Team USA 15-4.
"I feel really good," Folkl said. "Our team played
really well, we played as hard as we could. It wasjust
a good experience."
Game two began with another Folkl moment, as
the Cardinal star spiked the ball so hard that it
knocked down Team USA member Tara Cross-Battle
along with her two hair clips. However, the
Olympians once again ran ahead to a quick 6-1 lead.
Walsh and Folkl helped the Cardinal stay competi
tive, racking up several kills, but Stanford could not
contain the fire power of the National Team.
A spirited Stanford team jumped out to an early 5-
1 lead in the third game, as Folkl once again provided
the firepower for the Card. Senior middle blocker
Eileen Murfee and freshman outside hitter Sarah
Clark also contributed kills of their own. The
Olympians pulled even at 6-6, before Team USA took
control and eventually won 15-6.
"It was great to be back," Klein said. "I really miss
Stanford. It was great to hear the fans and be in
Maples Pavilion. It was a lot of fun."
