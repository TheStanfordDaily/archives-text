# Water polo defeats Davis in scoring battle
## 
### Rustan Eklund 
The No. 5 Stanford men's water
polo team came out quickly and never
relinquished its early lead, cruising to a
17-12 victory over No. 9 UC-Davis on
Saturday.
Less than a minute into the game,
senior holeman Brian Wallin scored on
a brilliant spin move to put Stanford up
1-0.
After a goal for the Aggies courtesy
of Ryan Indart, junior holeman Tyrone
Miller responded with a goal of his own
as he found the back of the net off a
great pass from sophomore forward

David Hay to make the lead 2-1.
Just minutes later, junior Nathan
Osborn pulled up from two point range
and beat the Davis goalie to put Stan
ford up 4-1. After the Aggies added an
other, redshirt freshman Brian Heif
feron scored the second two-point goal
of the game for the Cardinal. Wallin
then put in his second goal as time ex
pired to give the Cardinal a 7-3 edge
after the first quarter.
Stanford continued to dominate in
the second quarter, as senior forward
Daniel Lehoczky fooled the Aggie
goalie with a no-look shot about a
minute into the period. Wallin added

his third goal soon afterward to put the
Cardinal up 9-3. Two possessions later,
Heifferon added another to give Stan
ford its biggest lead of the game at 11 -3.
But in the second half Stanford's de
fense began to unravel. After building a
commanding lead in the first half, the
team suffered a bit of a defensive let
down and allowed Davis to start closing
the gap.
"We gave them way too many extra
opportunities, and Davis didn't give
up," said Stanford coach Dante Detta
manti. "They kept counterattacking
and we were slow to get back."
"When you score two quick two

pointers, it really takes the wind out of
your sails on defense," Wallin said.
Davis took control early in the third
quarter as it scored four goals to Stan
ford's two to come within striking dis
tance at 13-6. But Stanford's offense
proved too strong for Davis, as Wallin
put in his fourth of the game and
sophomore Jeremiah Robison added a
goal.
The Aggies responded with a goal
from a 4-meter penalty shot, but Peter
Osborn answered back with another
Stanford goal to give the Card a 15-7
lead after three quarters.
Davis would add four more
goals in the final quarter, but with
the help of David Hay and a bril
liant backhand shot from senior
Arturo Rodelo, the Cardinal man
aged to add two of its own to stave
off the comeback and win 17-12.
Indeed the Stanford offense
proved to be unstoppable, as no
fewer than nine different players
scored. Senior Brian Wallin proved
to be the star, as he added two
more goals in the second half to
wind up with four on the game.
"I can't say enough about Brian
Wallin," Dettamanti said. "He can
just take over a game — no matter
who we're playing."

Wallin's play thus far this sea
son has been phenomenal. He has
scored 13 goals in his last three
games including the game-winner
in overtime last week against Uni
versity of the Pacific.
Wallin and the squad will have
their hands full Saturday, when
they travel to Stockton for the
Northern California Tournament,
where they'll play top competition.
With a first-round matchup
against UC-San Diego, the Cardi
nal will likely advance to the sec
ond round. There they should
meet UC-Irvine, the team which
has handed Stanford its only two
losses of the season.
"The real test is our rematch
with Irvine," Lehoczky said. "The
team is really coming together, so
we'll be more evenly matched then
we were earlier in the season."
