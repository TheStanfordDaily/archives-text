# Football drops conference opener to Washington 27-6
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
SEATTLE — After holdinga 6-3 halftime
lead and clinging to a 6-6 tie through three
quarters on Saturday, the Cardinal football
team (1-3) finally fell to the 18th-ranked
Washington Huskies (4-1) 27-6.
In front of 71,488 roaring Husky fans,
Washington started the game on its own 19-
yard line and proceeded to move the ball 30
yards before junior inside linebacker Chris
Draft forced Washington quarterback Shane
Fortney to fumble on his own 46-yard line.
Junior tackle Carl Hansen recovered the
fumble, giving the Cardinal offense, which
had not scored a touchdown in six quarters,
good field position to start the game.
Stanford's offense, however, held true to
form on its first drive, as junior running back
Anthony Bookman fumbled on the Cardi
nal's second play from scrimmage, giving the
ball back to the Huskies on their 35.
The Cardinal defense then continued its
season-long pattern of giving up big plays on
third down, as Washington converted two
third-and-longs en route to setting up a first -
and-goal on the Cardinal 2.
Stanford's defense, which came into the
game ranked ninth in the nation in scoring
defense, came up with a big play when junior
inside linebacker Jon Haskins recovered
Corey Dillon's fumble on the Stanford 3.
Following the fumble, Stanford's offense,
which was last in the Pacific 10 Conference
in yardage coming into the game, seemed to
get on track for the first time this season.
Sophomore quarterback Chad Hutchin
son threw eight straight completions and se
nior running back Mike Mitchell also ran for

54 yards, leading the Cardinal on two
straight 93-yard scoring drives. But each re
sulted in Kevin Miller field goals Despite
ending both drives without touchdowns, the
offense remained optimistic with a 6-3 lead.
"I don't think there was a sense of let
down from me or the team," said head coach
Tyrone Willingham. "We just know that you
can't drive the ball that far and not come up
with the big score. But at the same time if
you get points, you still consider yourself
being up."
However, before Stanford added the sec
ond field goal, Hutchinson was slammed to
the turf by Husky Jason Chorak while at
tempting a shovel pass on third-and-goal.
Hutchinson, whose chin was split open on
the play, was diagnosed at halflime with a
concussion. Freshman Todd Husak replaced
Hutchinson for the final plays of the half.
Hutchinson returned in the second half,
but the offense never seemed in sync follow
ing the quarterback's injury. Hutchinson
admitted to forgetting some of the plays and
patterns in the second half, and it seemed
clear that his play was affected by the hit.
"The first half felt good, we were coming
off the ball real well and things were click
ing," Hutchinson said. "The second half was
kind of a blur — I'm not real sure what hap
pened." Hutchinson finished the game with
12 completions in 21 attempts for 148 yards
and one interception.
What happened was simple — the Cardi
nal offense fell apart. The team, which
rushed for 68 yards in the first half, lost 9
yards rushing in the second half. Hutchin
son only completed 4of 11 passes after his
concussion for 27 varris

Sophomore quarterback Chad Hutchinson takes a crushing blow to the chin from the
Washington front line.
Stanford only gained 47 total
yards in the second half and failed
to score again, making it 10 straight
quarters for the Cardinal without a
touchdown. The Cardinal has now
been held to single-digit scoring to
tals in consecutive games for the
first time since 1985.
But Washington's offensive unit
got things moving. Behind quarter
backs Fortney and Brock Huard
and running back Corey Dillon, the
Huskies dominated after the break.
Dillon rushed for 97 of his 173
yards in the second half, setting a
career best and adding the score
that put the game away. The rest of
the offensive clinic was taught by
wideout Jerome Pathon, who fin

ished with a career-best six catches
for 128 yards and two touchdowns.
Pathon's first score ended a
drive which was kept alive by a con
troversial fourth-down pass inter
ference call. But it was the ensuing
kickoff that broke Stanford's back.
Husky place-kicker John Wales
booted the ball short, trying to keep
it away from junior Damon Dunn.
But the ball bounced off the artifi
cial turf and bumped senior Adam
Salina, and Washington recovered
the fumble at the Cardinal 13.
"I made the mistake — I should
have let the deep man come up [and
catch it]," Salina said. "We all make
mistakes and one generally tops the
other. I think this one pretty much
takes the cake right now."
Dillon's score came just over two
minutes later, giving the Huskies
an insurmountable 20-6 lead.
