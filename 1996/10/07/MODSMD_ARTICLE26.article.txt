# Soccer beats Butler, falls to Clemson in Nike Invitational
## No. 3 Santa Clara destroys Bulldogs, takes home tourney title 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Stanford (7-4) only scored one goal
in its two games this weekend, but it
was enough to earn the Cardinal a 1-
1 performance in this year's Stanford
Nike Invitational.
The Cardinal, ranked 14th nation
ally, turned in a superb performance
against Clemson (8-3-1) on Friday but
was unable to convert its efforts into a
victory, falling 1-0 to the 15th-ranked
Tigers.
Yesterday, the team put forth a less
than stellar game, but thanks to
freshman Ronnie Fair's successful
penalty shot, was able to walk off the
field with a 1-0 victory over the No. 24
Butler Bulldogs (7-1-3).
Santa Clara (8-2), who beat the
Cardinal earlier this season 2-1, won
the tournament by beating Butler 8-0
on Friday and followed that impres
sive victory with a 2-1 win over Clem
son. The Broncos are ranked third,
with their only losses having come to
No. 1 North Carolina and San Diego.
"We really played an excellent soc
cer game against Clemson," said
Stanford coach Steve Swanson. "We
must have hit the post or crossbar at
least sLx or seven times, and we had
one ball cleared off the end line. We
had a lot of chances to win that game,
and we probably should have; we just
didn't get the result. You really put
yourself in a hole when you don't fin
ish."
Clemson's Sheri Bueter, a sopho
more forward, was the only player

able to finish in that game, scoring an
unassisted goal late in the second half.
Tiger goalie Suzanne Putnam saw
her cage peppered with Cardinal shots
all game long, but she was able to fend
off all Stanford attempts en route to
posting her fourth shutout of the
year.
"We were dominating them for

'We really played an

against Clemson. We had
a lot of chances to win
that game, and we
probably should have.'
— Steve Swanson

most of the game. We had our oppor
tunities but couldn't quite capitalize,"
said Stanford keeper Erin Bryla.
The first half of the Butler game
brought more of the same from the
Cardinal — plenty of shots but no
goals. The senior forward duo of Emily
Burt and Erin Martin were finding
holes in the Bulldog defense, but de
spite the many chances, the score re
mained knotted at zero at the half.
The Cardinal came out with a lot of
fire to start the second half, putting
together two excellent scoring
chances. In the first minute, Fair fired
a beautiful left-footed cross into the

middle of the Bulldog goal box, but
sophomore center midfielder Elie
Foster one-timed the ball just wide of
the cage.
Shortly after that miss. Burt found
herself with only one defender to beat
on the way to the goal but lost control
of the ball before she was able to get a
shot off.
Ten minutes after the intermis
sion, Cardinal fans began to get a little
nervous. Butler sent a cross high into
the goal box, and after leaping to
punch the ball out of the area, Bryla
fell to the ground. The ball bounced
freely for a few moments until the de
fense was able to recover and clear the
ball.
Stanford had another scare on But
ler's next attack. Joy Aschenbrenner,
a very quick sophomore forward,
drove past her defender and forced
Bryla to come out on her.
"She got down to the end line,"
Bryla said. "Then she turned and slot
ted it across. It was a great move, but
fortunately we had all of their run
ners covered, so I knew they wouldn't
be able to score."
Just at that point, when the Cardi
nal appeared to be falling apart, Mar
tin sneaked past the last line of Bull
dog defense and ran onto a well
played ball in the middle of the field.
Martin made a good move to get
past Amy Huber, Butler's goalie, but
Huber made a desperate and illegal
tackle to keep Martin from passing
the ball into an open net. The call was
for a penalty shot.
With the game on the line, Martin

stepped up to take the kick. She hit a
good ball at the lower right corner of
the net, but Huber made a diving save,
getting just enough of her out
stretched arm on the ball to knock it
wide.
The Cardinal finally got on the
scoreboard when sophomore mid
fielder Tracye Lawyer took a pass
deep down the left side of the field.
Lawyer was fouled, setting up anoth
er penalty shot opportunity.
"I was just trying to get the cross
off," Lawyer said. "I cut back and
turned, and (the Bulldog defender)
ran right into me."
At that point, Fair drilled the
penalty kick into the netting on the
lower left side of the goal, giving the
Cardinal a 1-0 lead.
"That's where I was trying to put
it," Fair said. "I was just glad it went
in."
Fair's play recently has been far
from mediocre. In the last three
games, the freshman from Los Altos
has scored three goals and assisted
another. Her point total of eight ties
her for second on the team with Mar
tin. Sophomore Charmaine Leßlanc
is leading the squad with 11.
"We weren't as creative against
Butler as we were against Clemson,"
Swanson said. "I thought we got a lit
tle too predictable. I really feel that if
we can bottle the first half of the
Clemson game and uncork it for the
rest of the season that I'll be very
happy with our results. We didn't get
the result on Friday, but we played
well enough to."

The Cardinal came out with a lot of
fire to start the second half, putting
together two excellent scoring
chances. In the first minute, Fair fired
a beautiful left-footed cross into the

middle of the Bulldog goal box, but
sophomore center midfielder Elie
Foster one-timed the ball just wide of
the cage.
Shortly after that miss. Burt found
herself with only one defender to beat
on the way to the goal but lost control
of the ball before she was able to get a
shot off.
Ten minutes after the intermis
sion, Cardinal fans began to get a little
nervous. Butler sent a cross high into
the goal box, and after leaping to
punch the ball out of the area, Bryla
fell to the ground. The ball bounced
freely for a few moments until the de
fense was able to recover and clear the
ball.
Stanford had another scare on But
ler's next attack. Joy Aschenbrenner,
a very quick sophomore forward,
drove past her defender and forced
Bryla to come out on her.
"She got down to the end line,"
Bryla said. "Then she turned and slot
ted it across. It was a great move, but
fortunately we had all of their run
ners covered, so I knew they wouldn't
be able to score."
Just at that point, when the Cardi
nal appeared to be falling apart, Mar
tin sneaked past the last line of Bull
dog defense and ran onto a well
played ball in the middle of the field.
Martin made a good move to get
past Amy Huber, Butler's goalie, but
Huber made a desperate and illegal
tackle to keep Martin from passing
the ball into an open net. The call was
for a penalty shot.
With the game on the line, Martin

stepped up to take the kick. She hit a
good ball at the lower right corner of
the net, but Huber made a diving save,
getting just enough of her out
stretched arm on the ball to knock it
wide.
The Cardinal finally got on the
scoreboard when sophomore mid
fielder Tracye Lawyer took a pass
deep down the left side of the field.
Lawyer was fouled, setting up anoth
er penalty shot opportunity.
"I was just trying to get the cross
off," Lawyer said. "I cut back and
turned, and (the Bulldog defender)
ran right into me."
At that point, Fair drilled the
penalty kick into the netting on the
lower left side of the goal, giving the
Cardinal a 1-0 lead.
"That's where I was trying to put
it," Fair said. "I was just glad it went
in."
Fair's play recently has been far
from mediocre. In the last three
games, the freshman from Los Altos
has scored three goals and assisted
another. Her point total of eight ties
her for second on the team with Mar
tin. Sophomore Charmaine Leßlanc
is leading the squad with 11.
"We weren't as creative against
Butler as we were against Clemson,"
Swanson said. "I thought we got a lit
tle too predictable. I really feel that if
we can bottle the first half of the
Clemson game and uncork it for the
rest of the season that I'll be very
happy with our results. We didn't get
the result on Friday, but we played
well enough to."
