# Debate on CIV ready to begin
## Committee will meet today 
### Sarah Cameron Therese Lee Staff writers 
Fifty-seven percent of gradu
ating seniors surveyed last spring
believed that Cultures, Ideas and
Values should be required, ac
cordingto preliminary findings of
the dV Design and Review Com
mittee.
Committee members will meet
with CIV instructors for the first
time today in a public meeting to
discuss potential changes that
could be made to the curriculum.
The committee was formed
last fall as part of University
President Gerhard Casper's on
going effort to evaluate all facets
of undergraduate education.
Committee chair and English
Prof. Robert Polhemus said the
committee plans to present its
findings and recommendations at
the beginning of winter quarter.
About 500 students responded

to the spring 1996 survey. Eighty
percent rated CIV as rigorous and
challenging compared with other
Stanford courses.
However, 26 percent of the re
spondents regarded the value of
CIV as "slight." Only 10.1 per
cent considered it "very great,"
and 12.3 percent declined to an
swer.
"CIV works," said Asst. Histo
ry Prof. Philippe Buc. "It teaches
very important, basic things, but
I am quite willing to see it being
transformed."
The survey also asked respon
dents to gauge how much CIV im
proved their oral and written
communication skills. About 30
percent, the largest group, rated
ClV's effectiveness as only "mod
erate." Less than 10 percent said
it was "very great," and 12.9 per
cent said CIV had no effect.
About 30 percent thought the
importance of ClV's emphasis on
American culture was only
"somewhat important" on a scale
ranging from "unimportant" to
"essential." Of those surveyed,
32.3 percent rated the impor
tance of other cultures "very im
portant."
One of the goals of the commit
tee is to simplify the goals of the
CIV sequence as outlined by the
Faculty Senate in 1989.
"The document (outlining the
CIV objectives) is a document so
much of its time that people felt
they had to spell everything out,
(such as) 'It's necessary once a
quarter to refer to race, class and
gender,' " Polhemus said. "It's all
spelled out. It seems to me those
battles are won. I think we're
going to have fewer prescriptive
requirements."
Polhemus also indicated there
is a general sentiment in the com
mittee to change CIV to reduce

the number of readings and
"focus instruction on intensive
reading ... of important primary
texts" and have "less of a smor
gasbord."
The most controversial change
the committee is discussing
would be to decrease the CIV se
quence from three quarters to
two, according to Polhemus.
"I am worried that two quar
ters of CIV would not make it vi
able as an intellectual object,"
said Buc. "It takes time to un
derstand certain kinds of theo
ries."
The committee has invited all
CIV faculty and teaching staff to
a meeting this afternoon to dis
cuss the results of the survey,
give a progress report of its delib
erations and gather input.
Today's agenda will include
discussion of CIV objectives and
its structure and relationship to
other requirements. These in
clude the writing requirement,
general education requirements
and the freshman seminar pro
gram Casper presented to the
Faculty Senate last spring.

"Making CIV two quarters
would be a disaster," said Histo
ry Prof. Jack Rakove. "What
happens to the lecturers? It is
hard to employ on a two-quarter
basis."
The committee has unani
mously voted to retain CIV, said
Polhemus. What changes are to
be made is yet to be seen.
"We don't see the track system
being replaced," he said, adding
that he wants CIV to have "less
prescription and less microman
agement." That will be the major
sentiment going into the meeting,
he said.
Instructors in the program
said they are happy the commit
tee is seeking outside input.
"There is so much secrecy in
volved in this," said History Prof.
Carolyn Lougee. "It is about time
they consulted with the people
who teach CIV."

Today's meeting of the CIV Re
view and Design Committee will
be held at 4:15 p.m. in Building
300, Room 300, and is open to the
public.
