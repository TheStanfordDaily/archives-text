# Stanford hesitant to join online campus

### Kelly Thomas 
Gov. Pete Wilson is looking
to create a "virtual university"
on the Internet in collabora
tion with several California
universities, including Stan
ford.
Wilson's staff consulted
with officials at various univer
sities in California, including
University President Gerhard
Casper and Director of Govern-

ment and Community Relations Larry Horton.
However, Stanford representatives only offered
suggestions on the project and have not pledged
active participation.
Hoping to capitalize on new technological in
novations, the planned virtual college would
offer classes and degrees by way of the Internet
and other media. Wilson has said he sees the
new university as a possible solution to the

rapidly increasing college population in the
country.
Horton and Anthony DiPaolo, director of
Stanford Instructional Television Network, at
tended a meeting last month organized by the
governor's office to discuss how universities in
the state can extend education to reach more
students via new technological outlets.
But Horton emphasized that participants
only considered ideas at the meeting.
"We made no commitments," he said. "We
just wanted to be encouraging and informed."
Wilson's proposal last week comes as a re
sponse to an invitation from 10 other Western
states asking California to participate in creat
ing Western Governors University, another
cyber-university. Instead of joining forces with
the other states, Wilson decided California
should form its own online institution.
Chris Thomsen, director of new ventures for
the Stanford Alumni Association, said the Uni
versity is assuming a more peripheral role in the

project. While others such as California State
University Chancellor Barry Munitz expressed
great enthusiasm for the virtual university,
Thomsen said Stanford "was more cautious."
"Stanford would like to participate, but it has
a different agenda," Thomsen said.
The man in charge of forming the design
team, Wilson's deputy chief of staff and Stan
ford alumnus Joseph Rodota, said he is inter
ested in learning what programs universities
currently offer online and how these courses
might fit in with the idea of the larger virtual
university.
The design team will include various Califor
nia campus administrators and faculty, as well
as representatives from the fields of finance,
telecommunications and information technolo
gy-
Parts of the new California online college are
expected to begin functioning next spring, be
fore the opening of the Western Governors Uni
versity, Rodota said.
