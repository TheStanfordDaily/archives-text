# Facebooks arrive three weeks late

### Eric Leventhal 
After a three-week delay, the
1996 facebook of incoming fresh
men and transfer students has fi
nally arrived on campus.
Residential Education staff
should receive copies of the book
by tomorrow, according to Orien
tation Publications Coordinator
Blake Harris. Res Ed staffers will
then distribute the books to fresh
men and transfer students.
The annual publication con
tains photos and residential infor
mation and is meant to facilitate
the process of social adjustment
that inevitably comes with being a
first-year student.
Harris attributed the waiting
period to "miscommunication"
about the production roles of the
New Student Orientation staff
and Herff Jones Inc., the company
which prints the book.
He likened the process to "a
cheesy episode of 'Three's Compa
ny' â€” you know, like when Mr.
Furley and the roommates get all
the information wrong or some
thing."

The information, compiled joint
ly by New Student Orientation and
the New Undergraduate Student
Information Project, was mailed to
the Kansas printing offices of Herff
Jones on Aug. 9. The completed
facebooks were expected back Sept.
13, m time for the arrival of this
year's freshman class. Instead, the
books came in just five days ago.
"The way the book was submit
ted, the company had to do a lot
more work than they had antici
pated," Harris explained.
The Orientation stafFs decision
to hire Herff Jones came after last
year's printing company, Josten's,
produced a partially inaccurate
freshman index. The photo infor
mation was correct, but the index
contained the addresses of fresh
men from the year before.
Harris said that despite prob
lems with the Herff Jones partner
ship, the Orientation staff would
prefer to "stick with one company"
in the publication of future face
books.
In response to campus-wide
complaints about the books' de
layed distribution, Harris was care
ful to note that "most frosh don't

know what to expect. It's every
body else who makes it an issue."
Harris also expressed concerns
that the book could be abused by
some members of the fraternity
system on campus.
"The only people I care about
are the frosh," he said.
