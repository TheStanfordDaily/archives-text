# Student groups help register EPA voters
## 
### Crystal Carreon Contributing writer 
Stanford students from MEChA
and Stop 209 crowded the court
yard of St. Francis Church in East
Palo Alto yesterday to help register
voters.
The church was chosen as the
site because students wanted to en
courage voter turnout, particularly
among Chicanos.
"It is a conscious decision that
we go to EPA because it is an area
not targeted or informed by the big
campaigns," said senior Felipe Bar
rag6n.
Barrag6n said mainstream
sources of information may bypass
places such as East Palo Alto be
cause it is largely an immigrant
community.
"But that doesn't mean these
people can't be influential and par
ticipate in the process, however in
directly," he said.
Sophomore Maria Medina said
the eftort to register voters was part
of a larger community outreach
strategy that will include precinct
walks and canvassing in the coming
weeks.
"Everyone needs to know and to
be informed on the issues of the
election," she said during the 15-

minute car ride
to East Palo
Alto. "We are fo
cusing on com
munities that
usually do not
vote."
Historically,
many Chicanos
have registered

to vote, but they seldom make it to
the ballot box. Although Chicanos
constitute about 10 percent of the
U.S. population, only 4.4 percent of
registered Chicanos voted in the
November 1994 elections, accord
ing to The Associated Press.
After spending the morning out
side of the church, students regis
tered 12 people, and an additional
four asked for absentee ballots.
One of the main problems of yes
terday's effort was the large num
ber of people who weren't citizens,
Medina said.
Junior Migdalia Gamboa
shrugged her shoulders as a mem
ber of the church filed past her.
"He said, 'No puedes.' He can't
vote — he's not a citizen," Gamboa
said.
Nevertheless, senior Maria Fer
nandez said more Chicano and

Latino immigrants are becoming
citizens everyday. Fernandez added
that language barriers may have
contributed to the lack of Chicano
participation in the political
process.
"The information we're offering
here is bilingual," she said. "The

language issue is one of the reasons
why many Latinos may not vote."
Because the group was register
ing voters on church property, they
were not allowed to campaign for
any particular cause, Medina said.
Members said they hope to cover
two or three of East Palo Alto's 12
precincts during walks every Sun
day until the Nov. 5 election.
The student effort was held in
conjunction with a statewide orga
nization, Californians for Justice.
