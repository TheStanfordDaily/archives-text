### Matt Spence 
U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-
Atherton, discussed her frustra
tion with the Republican Con
gress, campaign strategy and key
election issues in a lunchtime
talk at the Haas Center for Pub
lic Service yesterday.
"What you think and what
you're about are really the most
important things to me," said
Eshoo.
Amid jeans, pizza and politics,
Eshoo spoke to a heavily partisan
group of 30 students, emphasiz
ing the importance of Stanford
students to the upcoming race in
the 14th District, which she rep
resents.
The event, organized by the
Stanford Democrats, marked the
first in a series of casual meeting
between area candidates and
Stanford students.
"Were it not for Stanford stu
dents, we would not have gone
over the top" in the 1992 elec
tion, said Eshoo, who became the
first-ever Democrat to serve the
district in the House of Repre

sentatives. "Stanford was such
an integral part of the strategy
and work ethic of the campaign."
In a half-hour of opening re
marks, Eshoo called for contin
ued student activism and out
lined the central issues of the
campaign.
Citing increasing public apa
thy and unfavorable Congres
sional approval ratings, Eshoo
lamented the lack of a true con
nection between elected officials
and their constituents.
"I think people don't have con
fidence in their leaders," Eshoo
said. "They don't trust, and it's
hard to get them to go out and
vote."
In light of low voter turnouts
among young voters, Eshoo
praised the Stanford Democrats'
success in increasing campus po
litical involvement. Working
with the ASSU's voter-registra
tion effort, Stanford Democrats

had helped register 830 voters as
of Saturday.
Responding to student con
cerns over rising tuition costs,
Eshoo said education is central to
her legislative agenda.
"As we stand on the threshold
of the new millennium ... we
need more investment in educa
tion," Eshoo said.
Eshoo defended federal grant
in-aid programs, student loans
and Pell Grants despite recent
Republican attacks.
"I don't know who has that
type of money" to pay college tu
ition "unless you're the heir to
David Packard," said Eshoo,
drawing smiles from the group.
The congresswoman followed
her opening remarks with a 45-
minute informal question and
answer session, which drew
praise from the audience.
"I was especially impressed
by how accessible [Eshoo] was,"
said freshman Jessica Tucker-
Mohl, a newly registered Demo
crat. "I appreciated her readi
ness to answer questions and
her candor to address issues

about the election."
In this Democratic crowd,
Eshoo fielded questions about
the negative tenor of the Republi
can Congress. Eshoo attributed
the personal attacks and divisive
ness of the Congress to House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's person
al leadership style.
"It's been, in my view, a house
of horrors," Eshoo said of the Re
publican Congressional majority.
Eshoo concluded her presenta
tion by reiterating her opposition
to Proposition 209, the California
Civil Rights Initiative, which
would affect state affirmative ac
tion programs in education, con
tracting and employment.
Organizers of the event
praised the Congresswoman's
appearance as a success in in
creasing student awareness of is
sues in the election.
"I think this really shows that
Stanford is an institution that
represents progressive issues and
progressive ideals," said senior
Dave Thomas, chair of Stanford
Democrats. "This is not a reac
tionary campus by any means."
