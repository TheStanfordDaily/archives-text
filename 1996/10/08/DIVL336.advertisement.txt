She came bounding into
one of our on-campus
information sessions about
a year ago, an engineering
undergrad carrying a bag
of dismantled hard drives.
"Look," she said, and pointed out a subtle
inefficiency in the servo mechanism, which to that day,
only our top engineers had recognized.
Then she gave us a half hour lecture on how to fix it,
and we told her about state-of-the-art labs; she launched
into a monologue about data storage and what we should be
doing about it, so we told her what we are doing about it.
She said there's a lot of work to
be done, and we invited her to join us,
and do it. And since then, she's taken
n
TH
storage technology to the Nth degree.
Helped revolutionize how portable hard drives work.
Which brings us back to campus.
This semester we're scouting the country again,
looking for more spirited people and ideas.
We're pushing this company to the Nth degree.
And you can take us there
