The SSE intern learns about business by
working first hand with student project
managers of Stanford Student Enterprises. The
project managers run such programs as Flicks,
Stanford Directory, Lecture Notes, Stanford
Group Discounts, Linen Service,and Custom
T-Shirts. By working side-by side with the
project managers, an SSE intern is involved
with the marketing, accounting, and staffing
of the project. If you are interested in learning
about business and if you are interested in
having fun, it is time to apply for the SSE
Internship program.
