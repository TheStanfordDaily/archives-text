# Ex-Zapata RF dies of cancer
## 
### Crystal Carreon Contributing writer 
A single sob broke through the
silence in Casa Zapata's courtyard
last night. About 120 students,
alumni and friends gathered in a
candlelight vigil to honor the pass
ing of Jos6 Antonio Burciaga.
Burciaga, 57, a noted communi
ty activist, artist, writer and for
mer resident fellow in Casa Zapata,
died around 3 a.m yesterday from
cancer. He was first diagnosed with

cancer of the pancreas in December 1994, after
which a 10-pound cyst was removed.
After the vigil, a procession proceeded to El Cen
tro Chicano where the current Zapata RF, Lora
Romero, read a message from Burciaga's widow, Ce

cilia. "She said his soul was soaring," Romero said.
She paused. "Tony is now free. Free from the pain."
Before the vigil took place, students and friends
of Tony Burciaga took the time to reminisce.
Senior Rosie Armendariz was a freshman in Za
pata when the Burciagas were the RFs. She re
members the strong sense of familia the Burciagas
created that year.
"My dad had died a year before I was a fresh
man," she said. "Tony represented a father figure,
especially for me."
Her father had died of cancer. "When I heard
that Tony had cancer, I was shocked. In my mind it
automatically registered that cancer equals death.
Now Tony's gone."
Armendariz was on the Floricanto Committee
last spring. Burciaga was in remission when he read

some of his work at the event. Flor
icanto is the annual celebration of
the arts, music and poetry.
"So much of Tony is in his
work," Armendariz remembered.
"We have his artwork and his writ
ten works, but we'll miss hearing
his narration, his reading of his
poems."
The Burciagas were the Casa
Zapata RFs from 1985 through
spring 1994, when tensions be

tween the ethnic community and
the University culminated in a
hunger strike. In March 1994, Ce
cilia Burciaga, who at the time was
the highest-ranking Chicana ad
ministrator at Stanford, was fired
after 20 years of service. Student
groups organized a protest in the
Main Quad to draw attention to is
sues affecting the Chicano com
munity.
Remembering the events that
unfolded that spring, Romero
commented: "It seems as if we've
lost Tony twice. After the hunger
strike, we lost Cecilia and Tony to
gether. And now, we've lost Tony a

second time."
Linda Paulson, the RF in Don
ner, was a close friend of the Burci
aga family. She said everyone
knew Tony was terminally ill, but
yesterday seemed too soon to lose
him.
"I miss his voice," she said, with
the day's stress stained on her
face. "His soul was eloquent.
There was an eloquence in every
thing he did, whether he was
painting, writing or with friends.
He was very special."
Burciaga authored several
award-winning books, including
"Drink Cultura: Chicanismo" and

"Undocumented Love." He exhib
ited artwork throughout the
Southwest and Mexico. His murals
can be found in Zapata, particular
ly in the dining hall.
The Burciagas have been fea
tured in The New York Times, His
panic Link and Campus Report
(now Stanford Report), among
other publications.
"As long as we have his artwork
and remember his friendship he
will always be a part of Zapata,"
Romero said.
In addition to his widow, Burci
aga is survived by two children,
Tony Jr., 19, and Rebecca, 22.
