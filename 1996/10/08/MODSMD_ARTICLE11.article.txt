Bomb rocks Northern Ireland
LISBURN, Northern Ireland (AP) — Bombers struck at the center
of Northern Ireland's security yesterday, detonating two car bombs
inside the British army's heavily defended headquarters. Thirty
one people were wounded. There was no claim of responsibility.
The first bomb went off without warning in a parking lot inside
Thiepval Barracks, the main camp for the 18,000 army troops in
the British-ruled province.
No pain relief
DAYTON, Ohio (AP) — A 14-year-old expelled from school for
giving a Midol tablet to a classmate claimed yesterday in a federal
lawsuit that she was punished because she is black.
"You should not treat students this way for something as minute
and as small as a Midol tablet," said Carl Lewis, the lawyer for Kim
berly Smartt, an eighth-grader at Baker Junior High School.
Smartt was expelled until February after she gave a Midol
tablet to classmate Erica Taylor, who is white.
