# New strains of AIDS appear in U.S.

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Scien
tists are discovering the AIDS epi
demic is far more diverse in Amer
ica than previously thought, and
they are scouring the globe for
AIDS strains to ensure that U.S.
tests for the disease are able to
detect every type.
Doctors here weren't too wor
ried in 1994 when France first
sounded the alarm that an exotic,
hard-to-diagnose strain of AIDS
was spreading. Doctors found the
first U.S. case in July.
Then last month, scientists
uncovered a second U.S. resident
infected with this rare type of HIV,
named Group O. In interviews last
week, researchers said they also
are investigating a small cluster of
New Yorkers with signs of still dif
ferent AIDS strains never before

seen in this country.
"We will now treat these prob
lems as a global village: A case any
where is a case here, and we will
move more quickly" to battle them,
said Dr. Jay Epstein, the Food and
Drug Administration's blood chief.
AIDS symptoms appear similar
worldwide even though the HIV
virus is genetically different from
country to country. Tests to detect
HIV are designed to recognize a
region's most common strains.
The concern is whether they'll also
catch any rare foreign strains.
Take the HIV type named
Group O, thought to lurk only in
West Africa until a woman in
France was diagnosed in 1994.
Doctors didn't find the first U.S.
case until July, a Los Angeles
woman. Her infection had gone

undiagnosed by routine AIDS
tests, which miss Group O once in
every five cases.
Late last month, Abbott Labo
ratories filed an FDA application to
sell the nation's first upgraded
AIDS test designed to better catch
Group O infections — just as feder
al health officials discovered a sec
ond Group O case, this one in
Maryland.
Both Group 0 patients found in
the United States apparently were
infected in their native West
Africa, said Dr. Patrick Sullivan of
the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
More disturbing, the CDC is
investigating whether patients in
the Bronx borough of New York
City caught other foreign strains of
HIV while in this country — not

before immigrating here or while
traveling abroad.
The CDC genetically tested 43
newly diagnosed AIDS patients
from Bronx-Lebanon Hospital
Center last spring. Eight patients,
an unexpectedly high 19 percent of
those tested, had strains different
from the subtype B that is respon
sible for North America's AIDS
epidemic.
Preliminary test results indi
cate six patients have HIV sub
types A or C normally found in
Africa, said CDC epidemiologist
Dr. Kathleen Irwin. One has a
Thailand version of subtype B
never before found in a U.S. resi
dent, and the eighth patient has a
strain so unique the CDC's tests
haven't yet recognized it, said
Irwin.
