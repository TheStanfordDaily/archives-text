## Priceless donations 
### 
Stanford must ensure
monetary gifts mean
more than just ranking

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
Gerhard Casper made it
clear when he arrived at
Stanford that his administration
would increase fund-raising
efforts. Recent statistics from the
Office of Development show that
the administration has succeeded
so far and should be commended.
In the 1995-96 year, Stanford
rewrote its fund-raising record
book, breaking the $300 million
barrier for the first time. David
Packard and William Hewlett sin
gle-handedly contributed 20 per
cent of the total, and their $62.5
million donation will help make
the Science and Engineering Quad
a reality.
While such a staggering dona
tion skews the numbers, the trend
toward greater giving nonetheless
holds. Even without Hewlett and
Packard's gift, the record would
have fallen with room to spare.
While the benefits of most gifts
may not be as obvious as the con
struction of the science quad, their
impact has not gone unnoticed.
Stanford has traditionally
lagged behind other prestigious
institutions in alumni donations,
resulting in poorer marks in U.S.
News & World Report's college
rankings. After the school's rank
ing fell for the third consecutive
year in 1993, due largely to a woe
ful alumni donation rate, Stanford
stepped up its fund-raising efforts.
But the effects of increased
donations extend well beyond arbi
trary rankings to more tangible
upgrades. The Terman Fellows
Program is one of many that has
benefited from increased funding.
Again, Hewlett and Packard
deserve thanks for making it hap
pen.
The program began three years
ago thanks to a contribution from
the Stanford alumni. This year, an

additional fellowship brought the
total to seven research grants of
up to $100,000 each for professors
in technical fields.
The grants are unrestricted,
giving recipients the freedom to
conduct research without having
to adhere to strict guidelines. Cur
rent Terman fellows are studying
pollution sensors, how to improve
magnetic information storage and
a "final theory of the universe,"
among other things. Their
research could result in changes
that will not only boost Stanford's
prestige but improve lives every
where.
Terman fellows agree that the
funding from the program has
been a pivotal contributor to the
success of their research. Casper
and the Office of Development
should search for additional funds
to support the Terman program
and similar programs in other
areas of study.
Hewlett and Packard are not
the only ones who have earned a
pat on the back for their help. In
general, alumni are giving in
greater numbers. The Stanford
Fund, which asks alumni for dona
tions of any amount, has doubled
its intake from three years ago to
today's $5.2 million. As a result,
nearly $3 million more is available
for undergraduate education and
scholarships.
The rise in donations has not
been confined to the undergradu
ate community, however. The
Graduate School of Business and
the Law School both entered
uncharted territory, with Law
School donations tripling the
1994-95 total.
While Stanford can never
receive enough donations, and sev
eral programs are still consider
ably short of their desired
amounts, it is encouraging that
Casper and the Office of Develop
ment have made a concerted effort
to remedy the widespread dona
tion drought. Their application of
newly acquired funds should con
tinue to foster creative research
and benefit students.
