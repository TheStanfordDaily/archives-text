## In defense of carnivores 
### 
I'VE HAD ENOUGH! Every year it's
the same ol' routine. Whether at a
dorm meeting or a party on The Row,
it's the same crap!
One incident that is so maligned that
I've given up on trying to fix it! Let's take
the ordering of pizza: Stanford students
seem to think that there are only three
types of pizza eaters. First, there are those
who eat whatever is on a pizza — omni
vores. Then we have the simple veggies.
Third, we have the vegans, who eat nei
ther meat nor cheese. However, an impor
tant third group has been annoyingly
overlooked; Stanford, being the hypersen
sitive place it is, seems to ignore the fourth
group: those who eat only meat. No veg
gies, no cheese — just meat! This over
sight has caused me and those like me
(believe me, we are few, but we exist)
much anguish. Stanford's Carnivorous
Community is fed up and we want decisive
action!
The University and its Dining Service
does an incredible amount for the leaf
eaters on campus.
But what about us? What about the
meateaters?
The salad bars in dining halls like Flo
Mo are splendid, boasting on a daily basis a
vast array of fruits, vegetables, seeds and
grains. (Not even Safeway has as great a
selection of fruits and vegetables as Stan
ford's Dining Service). However, those of
us who eat only meat or tremendous por
tions of this divine sustenance can only
choose between hamburgers and chicken

on a daily basis.
What ever happened to Stanford meet
ing the needs of all its students?
We've seen vegetarian and vegan hous
es such as Synergy and Columbae pop up
out of concern for those students it serves,
but no house truly exists that meets the
needs of the University's All-American
boys who just want "what's for dinner."
Behold: a university that is completely
remiss about the needs of its carnivorous
community.
Oh ... but I forgot! I'm in Northern
California — not back in good ol', God
fearing cow-grazing Arizona. The cabbage
patch has us greatly outnumbered. I
couldn't help but laugh when I saw animal
rights activists in Petaluma protesting
before a slaughterhouse, totting signs
which read "Meat is Murder" and "Boycott
Milk-Fed Veal: Toxic for you — Torture
for the Calf."
Whatever!
You call us murderers! Just because
your little carrot doesn't scream when you
bite it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. It
doesn't mean that this creature of God
doesn't feel pain or suffer as you take each
quick bite — chomp after chomp; you
siphon away its life force. I speak for plants
and roots alike when I say they too are part
of the living world.
Take your innocent little apple. You are
eating the ovary of an apple tree! I would
not so much as touch the ovaries of a cow
or pig, yet the cabbage-patch kids contend
that we are guilty of murder. I'd suggest

that we'd use the same ruler for everybody
— this way, veggemites can't be so slippery
and go away unindicted for their crimes.
Good!
Now we're all on the same level: We
both have our vices. But unlike most of my
seed eating, soy-milk drinking opponents, I
am willing to take the first step to end this
bitter antagonism. Let's bury the hatchet
and work to better understand each other;
let us learn to appreciate one another's dif
ferences — like Res Ed taught us!
I invite you to come over to Mirrielees
and prepare a vegan or vegetarian dish. I
will bite back my tongue, hold my breath
and try and eat your food of the gods. But
in conjunction with this meal, I too will
prepare for you a carnivorous, culinary
extravaganza: pounds and pounds of bar
becued beef, pork, chicken and fish. I'd
force even the most devoted member of
this clan to jettison his wicked ways; no
more poultry excuses: "But I'm vegan."
We could all meat in the same room with
out the other group crying fowl or fishing
for reasons to duck out of the meeting. The
beef between Bambi and the butchers
would be a succulent memory.
Any takers?
