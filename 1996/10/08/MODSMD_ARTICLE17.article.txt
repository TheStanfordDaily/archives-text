New CTL peer tutoring services beneficial to students

WHILE WE AT the Center for
Teaching and Learning were
pleased to have front page cover
age of the important changes in the peer
tutoring program, we were disappointed
that the extent of improvement and
increased availability that the new sys
tem will bring did not come across clear
ly. The program has not simply shifted
from assigning individual tutors to hav
ing tutors work out of drop-in centers. It
has actually expanded, with the generous
support of the President's and Provost's
Offices, and will help students in ways
not possible before.
After carefully examining the limita

tions in the way tutoring had worked
after budget cuts in the early '90s, we
proposed that students would actually be
better served by making tutors more
widely available in the residences where
they are more convenient to students
when and where they do their studying.
Thus, we haven't "eliminated"
tutoring in popular subjects but
instead have made help for the most
widely requested subjects accessible all
over campus.
In addition, students are no longer
limited to eight hours of tutoring in one
subject. Now they can meet with tutors
regularly for help in a variety of courses.

We are also pleased that students will not
have to wonder whether they will be able
to reach their tutor and when they will be
able to set up an appointment.
Thanks to the extensive use of tech
nology, students can simply turn to easi
ly located Web pages and know instantly
where the closest tutoring help will be.
What's more, students will still be
assigned individualtutors in foreign lan
guage and under other special circum
stances.
And finally, students in Human Biolo
gy can be assured that tutors do exist for
the core, as they always have; at this
early point in the quarter, their sched

ules simply haven't been determined yet.
We're happy to report that when stu
dents come into the center and hear
about the new tutoring system, they are
reacting enthusiastically to its flexibility
and breadth.
We will also closely monitor the new
system as students begin to use it to
make sure that help is there when it's
needed. Students are encouraged to e
mail us their suggestions and comments
at ea.ctl@forsythe.
