# Tuesday Thoughts: California Civil Rights Initiative
## Proposition 209 Yes! CCRI points state in right direction 
### 
With few exceptions, everybody comes into
the world in the same manner, yet complete
equality ends as soon as it begins. From the
first breath of air, some children will prosper more
than others for a multiplicity of reasons. The socioe
conomic or the ethnic / genetic advantage is by no
means the sole cause for some people's advancement
or lack thereof. One's community, friends, family life
or chance mentors may also be the resources for a
person's unfair edge.
Because we unfortunately live in an inequitable

world full of racism and financial injustices, not every student has the
chance to excel in life. Furthermore, as morally and socially responsi
ble Americans, something should at least be attempted in order to
truly bring about equality in a nation that claims "liberty and justice
for all."

In the American experiment, education has always attempted to
be the great equalizer amongst a diverse people; hence, the thou
sands of public schools around the country. Although various pros
and cons to our public schools may be debated, the fact of the mat
ter remains that several thousand dollars are spent per student
every year in a process meant to educate each child as much as the
next. In Miami, I have visited many schools — from the richest to
the poorest neighborhoods. Public schools may have wonderful J
motivations and goals but sadly lack complete, successful imple- J
mentation. I

For an infinite amount of reasons, every high school graduate
is still not equal among his peers; therefore, a tremendous bur
den falls upon the nation's universities, public and private.
Through affirmative action programs, colleges (at the under
graduate and graduate levels) must offer one final effort to cre
ate equality among peers through the best manner possible — i
education. Affirmative action MUST continue at all education- j
al institutions and stages in order to fulfill our Founding '
Fathers' dream, the American Dream, of shaping a nation I
where every person is not only created equal but also devel- I
oped equally through knowledge and learning. V
True educational parity will allow every person exiting a I
university the necessary tools to succeed in society at large — I
thus eliminating the need to discriminate, for whatever rea- I
son, after a complete scholastic career.

In my perfect affirmative action world, eveiy college I
graduate should have received his fair share of educational
opportunities. So why should preferential treatment contin
ue beyond the final stage of equalization? Some may criti
cize my "perfect affirmative action world" as unrealistic;
however, if one reads carefully, the affirmative action pro
gram I described above is basically what we have today.
Our more perfect Union needs definite fine tuning. If
God truly created all men equal, as our Founding Fathers
seemed to believe, then shouldn't we do the best we can to
assure this equality? Children, more than adults, are
extremely (if not totally) dependent upon their environ
ment. We should attempt to remedy the terrible disparity
among peers, as students, at eveiy outlet. I strongly believe
educational opportunity will create the equality necessary
for the principles behind Prop. 209, freedom from discrimi
nation, to be universally accepted.
Prop. 209 embodies the ideals of our democratic society. .
Although seemingly terminating affirmative action, I have 1
the strongest confidence that California's educational insti- 1
tutions will continue to recognize their duties and responsi- \
bilities concerning the equality of man and the perfecting of a 1
nation — no matter where the struggle may lead.
I believe Prop. 209 will be the first step, although seem- '
ingly an obstacle, in creating a stronger affirmative action
program in regards to our institutions of higher learning.
And then I ask, "If everybody finally receives a fair deal to
excel in the gathering of knowledge, the necessary key to pros
perity, why will we need any bias outside the realm of educa
tion?"
