# Drinking policy in flux
## 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Despite student concerns about policing
of underage drinking, the upcoming report
from the Alcohol Task Force will stress ed
ucation rather than enforcement, said Vice
Provost and Dean for Student Affairs
Mary Edmonds.
Arid although Edmonds said "clarity"
will be a focus of the report, it is not clear
when the revision of the University's alco
hol policy will eventually surface.
The task force, which is composed of

students, faculty and staff members, has yet to meet in its
entirety this quarter. The first meeting is scheduled some
time in the next two weeks.
Originally, the report had been scheduled to be delivered
to Edmonds at the end of fall quarter, and she said she
hopes the deadline will be met.
However, according to Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas,
chair of the task force, the appointed commission is "far
from any conclusion."
Although Thomas said the task force has begun writing
the first draft, he added that a winter quarter completion
date is more reasonable.
Of the eight students selected by the ASSU Nominations
Commission last year to serve in the group, at least six have
left the task force, either due to graduation or changes in in
terest.
The commission has subsequently named new students
to the task force, although some of these members have yet


Edmonds
to meet officially. Nominations
Commission Chair Paul Kim could
not give any reason for the large
turnover of the task force.
Meanwhile, two or three faculty
members have been gathering to
discuss ideas and to "canvass opin
ions from the community,"
Thomas said.
Last spring quarter, the task
force surveyed resident assistants
and resident fellows to determine
University-wide views on the cur
rent alcohol policy, Thomas said.
With this information, Thomas
said he hopes to be able to draft a
policy that the community will re
spect and "buy into."
Edmonds said the final report
should involve "a web of caring" in
which students will be educated
about the potential dangers associ
ated with drinking on campus.
Edmonds first announced the
formation of a task force to revise
the University's alcohol policy in
her State of Students Affairs ad
dress last October.

She emphasized three categories
of students who will be targeted
with this policy: students who binge
drink, students who choose not to
drink and do not want to be around
people who do, and freshmen who
are introduced to drinking once
they arrive on campus.
"We don't want our men and
women to be exposed to a new
habit of drinking without them
learning about it," Edmonds said.
But for those who do decide to
drink, Edmonds added, "help
should be given if that's what is
needed. We want to let students
know what to look out for."
As part of the policy's imple
mentation, a "big educational"
process will be developed to help
students understand the new
guidelines. However, Edmonds
added that it is too early to define
what this process will entail.
Senior Nick Sordoni, a member
of the task force, said he hopes the
revisions will play a major role in
the interactions between alcohol
and students.
"The Stanford drinking scene is
not any sort of crisis, but there is
definitely room for improvement,"
Sordoni said.
