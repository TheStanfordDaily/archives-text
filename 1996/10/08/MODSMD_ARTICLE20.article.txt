## 209 works against hard-fought gains 
### 
There is no denying that minorities and
women have gained much through
affirmative action. While this program
has given so much to so many people, it still
faces the fate of destruction.
Proposition 209, the California Civil
Rights Initiative, will effectively put an end
to all affirmative action programs in school
and in the workplace. The enforcement of
such an initiative would undo years of strug
gle in which colored people and women strove

collectively to gain more power in America. For the large part,
affirmative action is a strong and necessary voice that ensures
that discrimination against minorities does not take place.
The fact that some of our politicians have even generated a
I disastrous initiative such as Prop. 209 only proves that they
I have no understanding of the needs and circumstances facing
their constituents — Californian constituents who should vote
an emphatic NO on Prop. 209.
Just a few years ago, men and women alike endured indig
nant ordeals to make certain that their needs and those of gen
erations to follow would not go unnoticed in America. Countless
women have marched through hissing, spit-hurling crowds only
to have a right to maternity leave or to be able to get a better
paying, male-dominated job. Likewise, colored individuals bore
the lash of burning blows and the piercing glare of hateful eyes
while in search of fair education and employment opportunities.
The result of their frightful struggles eventually led to the cre
ation of affirmative action. No one wishes to relive this past, and
no one should support Prop. 209.
Affirmative action is a strong claim to authority when it comes
to job and education equality. A civil rights group, Californians for
Justice, reports that 86 percent of all jobs in America are found by
■vord of mouth. More than 90 percent of the well-paying jobs in
America are held by white men. Affirmative action ensures that
ninorities have access to these jobs they would never have heard of
itherwise.
Additionally, with the passage of CCRI, much needed govern
ment-supported scholarships for minorities will be illegal. What's
more, women can be viewed as unqualified for a job because of sex
or fired for being pregnant. Affirmative action guards minorities
and females against such absurd actions while Prop. 209 decep
tively OKs them.
Knowing these things, it seems foolish that some politician
would mastermind the creation of an initiative that is so cor
ruptive. Some politicians have sold affirmative action off as a
quota setting entity. The Bakke decision of 1978 made the
establishment of hiring and school enrollment quotas unconsti
tutional. However, affirmative action programs are only initiat
ed for a limited amount of time in places where there is over
whelming evidence of prejudicial hiring practices.
While politicians such as David Duke and Pete Wilson propose
getting rid of affirmative action, they offer minorities and women
no alternative to affirmative action. .An example of the possible
;fleets is when a man feels discriminated against, he will no longer
ave the free support of a powerful program. Instead he will have to
Liel in court and await the decision of a judge. Such hearing could
>e a legal nightmare, taking months or years, not to mention a lot
)f money — two things most women and minorities cannot afford
o gamble with. Suddenly ripping affirmative action out of society
ill merely open another world of problems for Americans and politi
ins to deal with and combat.
Prop. 209 is a ludicrous piece of legislation crafted to further
veaken women and people of color and strengthen the "old boys
network." The passage of the ill-designed Prop. 209 could revert
females and minorities back to the time when getting a decent job
was next to impossible. In the absence of affirmative action,
women and minorities face harder obstacles when attempting to
acquire an education and gaining jobs. In the mean time, their
representatives are leaving us with no other option. On Nov. 5,
vote against insanity and the encouragement of political injus
tices — vote no on Prop. 209.
