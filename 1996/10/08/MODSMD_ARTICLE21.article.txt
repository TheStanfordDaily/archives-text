# Before Deciding ...
## Take a step back from the rhetoric and look at the initiative carefully 
### 
An important element of poli
tics is the manipulation of
symbols. Candidates run
ning for office continually try to
package their analyses and especial
ly presentation of issues to convince
voters that their positions not only
make more sense, but that the
opponents' positions are seriously
lacking in foundation, truth or rele
vance. (That is, of course, unless
the chosen strategy is to present as
few positions on issues as possible.)
The politics of the popular refer
endum is similarly subject to such
manipulation. It is even possible
that because a popular referendum
is not about candidates but about
issues, the electorate is even more
subject to manipulation because it
can't make a decision solely on the
basis of who it likes, who is the
incumbent, who is the favored par
tisan, who is better qualified or
simply who looks best. Therein lies
the dilemma.
How can the public benefit from
a process of voting on popular ref
erenda where proponents and
opponents consciously try to
manipulate the public for their own
benefit? How can the public weed

through the misrepresentation and
posturing to take a thoughtful posi
tion on an issue of considerable
controversy? This is the primary
challenge presented by the serious
consideration of Proposition 209,
the so-called "California Civil
Rights Initiative." It is a challenge
all California voters must meet.
The politics of misrepresenta
tion abound with regard to Prop.
209, and they come from those who
favor it as well as those who oppose
it. Plain and simple, this proposi
tion is designed to outlaw most ele
ments of affirmative action pro
grams practiced by public institu
tions including all state and local
government agencies, universities,
community colleges and public
schools.
Yet the authors of Prop. 209
chose not to include the words
"affirmative action" anywhere in
the text. One must ask why. It was
the proponents who gave it the
name "California Civil Rights Ini
tiative," and if one reads the first
half of paragraph (a), it does read
like an anti-discrimination law. It
is evident that the purpose of the
proposition is to outlaw systems of

"preferential treatment"
treatment based on "race,
sex, color, ethnicity or
national origin."
But, do all affirmative
action programs require
"preferential treatment"
for members of targeted
groups? What is "preferen
tial treatment"? What is the
relation of "preferential
treatment" to assessment of

"merit"? Are "preferential treat
ment" and "merit" incompatible?
What is evident is that there is a
need for definitions and unfortu
nately Prop. 209 does not provide
them. Many proponents of Prop.
209 argue that affirmative action
programs require preferential
treatment, that preferential treat
ment is incompatible with merit -
based assessment, and that target
ed groups benefit to the disadvan
tage of non-targeted groups ... all
without definitions to assess this
logic.
Many opponents of Prop. 209
argue that the primary motivation
of the legislation is racist and that
it is designed to limit the gains
made with affirmative action in

public employment and
university admission by
targeted groups including
African Americans, Lati
nos and women. The pres
ence of racism in American
public policy has a long
history. Its legacy is still
present in many sectors of
our society. However,
charging racism does little
to convince many voters

that affirmative action programs
are worthy.
Should all members of particu
lar racial and ethnic groups benefit
from affirmative action programs
even when it is not evident that
they have experienced any disad
vantage or discrimination in their
background? Should social class,
somehow defined, be included
within a determination of racial,
ethnic and gender groups? How
should people of mixed race be clas
sified for affirmative action purpos
es? Should recent immigrants be
included in affirmative action pro
grams? These are difficult ques
tions which opponents of Prop. 209
tend not to consider.
It is abundantly clear that Prop.

209 will directly affect the way in
which California public institu
tions, and perhaps private ones,
will be able to include race, ethnici
ty and gender in their work Affir
mative action is a complex policy, a
complex program and a complex
strategy for dealing with group
diversity and inequality in our soci
ety.
The most thoughtful definition
of affirmative action that I have
found is the following: Affirma
tive action is a policy designed to
enhance access to and success in
institutions of merit-based deci
sion making. Affirmative action
does not require preferential
treatment for the member of any
group, unless group identity is
included as one among other
resources needed by institutions
to enhance their productivity or
to include individuals whom the
institution tended not to include
in the past. Assuming that one
can agree upon appropriate merit
based criteria to assess potential
performance, affirmative action
programs must work as direct
complements to the application of
these criteria.

Diversity in race, ethnicity and
gender are ever-present in Cali
fornia today. How we incorporate
that diversity within our public
and private institution of work,
education an economic develop
ment will require some of our
most creative thinking as individ
uals, as families and as member of
our larger public and private com
munities.
Does Prop. 209 provide more
opportunities for that creativity
to develop or does Prop. 209 stifle
creativity? Does Prop. 209
acknowledge that diversity and
see it as a resource in our state, or
does Prop. 209 identify diversity
as a problem that needs to be cor
rected? Does Prop. 209 encourage
voters to work together to build a
more inclusive California citizen
ry, or does it work to pit ethnic,
racial and gender groups against
one another?
Your answers to these three
questions should greatly affect how
vou vote on Nov. 5.

tions including all state and local
government agencies, universities,
community colleges and public
schools.
Yet the authors of Prop. 209
chose not to include the words
"affirmative action" anywhere in
the text. One must ask why. It was
the proponents who gave it the
name "California Civil Rights Ini
tiative," and if one reads the first
half of paragraph (a), it does read
like an anti-discrimination law. It
is evident that the purpose of the
proposition is to outlaw systems of

"preferential treatment"
treatment based on "race,
sex, color, ethnicity or
national origin."
But, do all affirmative
action programs require
"preferential treatment"
for members of targeted
groups? What is "preferen
tial treatment"? What is the
relation of "preferential
treatment" to assessment of

"merit"? Are "preferential treat
ment" and "merit" incompatible?
What is evident is that there is a
need for definitions and unfortu
nately Prop. 209 does not provide
them. Many proponents of Prop.
209 argue that affirmative action
programs require preferential
treatment, that preferential treat
ment is incompatible with merit -
based assessment, and that target
ed groups benefit to the disadvan
tage of non-targeted groups ... all
without definitions to assess this
logic.
Many opponents of Prop. 209
argue that the primary motivation
of the legislation is racist and that
it is designed to limit the gains
made with affirmative action in

public employment and
university admission by
targeted groups including
African Americans, Lati
nos and women. The pres
ence of racism in American
public policy has a long
history. Its legacy is still
present in many sectors of
our society. However,
charging racism does little
to convince many voters

that affirmative action programs
are worthy.
Should all members of particu
lar racial and ethnic groups benefit
from affirmative action programs
even when it is not evident that
they have experienced any disad
vantage or discrimination in their
background? Should social class,
somehow defined, be included
within a determination of racial,
ethnic and gender groups? How
should people of mixed race be clas
sified for affirmative action purpos
es? Should recent immigrants be
included in affirmative action pro
grams? These are difficult ques
tions which opponents of Prop. 209
tend not to consider.
It is abundantly clear that Prop.

209 will directly affect the way in
which California public institu
tions, and perhaps private ones,
will be able to include race, ethnici
ty and gender in their work Affir
mative action is a complex policy, a
complex program and a complex
strategy for dealing with group
diversity and inequality in our soci
ety.
The most thoughtful definition
of affirmative action that I have
found is the following: Affirma
tive action is a policy designed to
enhance access to and success in
institutions of merit-based deci
sion making. Affirmative action
does not require preferential
treatment for the member of any
group, unless group identity is
included as one among other
resources needed by institutions
to enhance their productivity or
to include individuals whom the
institution tended not to include
in the past. Assuming that one
can agree upon appropriate merit
based criteria to assess potential
performance, affirmative action
programs must work as direct
complements to the application of
these criteria.

Diversity in race, ethnicity and
gender are ever-present in Cali
fornia today. How we incorporate
that diversity within our public
and private institution of work,
education an economic develop
ment will require some of our
most creative thinking as individ
uals, as families and as member of
our larger public and private com
munities.
Does Prop. 209 provide more
opportunities for that creativity
to develop or does Prop. 209 stifle
creativity? Does Prop. 209
acknowledge that diversity and
see it as a resource in our state, or
does Prop. 209 identify diversity
as a problem that needs to be cor
rected? Does Prop. 209 encourage
voters to work together to build a
more inclusive California citizen
ry, or does it work to pit ethnic,
racial and gender groups against
one another?
Your answers to these three
questions should greatly affect how
vou vote on Nov. 5.
