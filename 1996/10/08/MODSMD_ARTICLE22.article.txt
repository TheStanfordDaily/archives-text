## Wanted: FANS 
### 
The following story is in no
way directed to the athletes on
this campus bui to the lifeless stu
dents who attend sporting events.
So if you 're an athlete (and you
probably are because most other
students don't read this page)
lend this to one of those students
sitting around you in lecture.

Most of the columns that
appear in these pages
focus on the sports and
athletes on campus. Some of
them keep count of the national
titles earned and boast about
Stanford dominance in the world
of sports. They're sometimes
critical but most always about
the athletes and sports them
selves.
So brace yourselves. This is a
direct message to all the nonath
letes — get off your butts and
make some noise!
I'll admit, I'm as guilty as the
rest of you. Except for the occa
sional loud-mouthed cheer for
one of my friends, I'm usually as
passive as anyone. And that is ex
actly the problem; we all sit
around (watching the game or
not) and observe. No one takes
an active part in the game.
The only exception to this
rule is the men's basketball
games. No one can deny that the
Sixth Man Club is loud and ob
noxious (as any good student
section should be). And the
club's impact on the game is un
deniable. The men's team has an
unbelievable home-court advan
tage thanks to these energetic
students.
Now consider the other sports
— the teams that have impecca
ble records without the help of
the crowd. What if they got that
kind of support too?
Women's volleyball is on track
for a third straight Pacific 10
Conference title and should win
the NCAA Championship as
well. So where's the support?
The students provide the occa
sional "oooo" when Kristin Folkl
or Kerri Walsh come up with an
unbelievable kill and participate
in the ceremonial standing for
game point, but they're not even
close when it comes to crowd sup
port (except for Branner — who
for the most part, constitutes the
Kerri Walsh Fan Club).
Last week's match against Cal
was the most nerve-racking, ex

citing match of the year. And the
fans who hung around for game
five really got into the match. But
I noticed something very inter-

esting in that final game.
There were two groups of peo
ple who kept the crowd into it.
They initiated clapping and en
couraged the crowd to get in
volved. Surprisingly (or maybe
not), it was the members of both
basketball squads who were at
the match and the Stanford
bench.
Funny isn't it. The biggest
supporters of the athletes are the
athletes themselves. The rest of
us are too wrapped up in whatev
er the hell we're doing. I don't
know what the problem is. It
honestly baffles me.
What's even sadder for me is
that I've come to accept this as
the norm. But the one atrocity I
can't overlook is the football
games. Don't tell me you're not
into it this year because the team
isn't doing as well. Last year's
team was on fire, but we only got
up for Big Game.
I guess my biggest hurdle with
accepting the ill fate of our foot
ball games springs from my orig
inal expectations. I'm from Geor
gia, and in the South football is
huge.
I can't remember the last time
the University of Georgia had a
football team worth cheering for,
but I look forward to the few
games I attend each year more
than an entire season of Stanford
football.
There's an excitement in
Athens that I've never found at
Stanford Stadium. I've been at
games that were so loud you
couldn't hear the band (and I was
sitting in the student section
right next to it). Now that's what
I call a home-field advantage.
But in Stanford football there
is no such thing as a home-field

advantage. OK, I realize the stadi
um is huge and set back from the
field but that's no excuse.
Last year the Card had its
most successful start since 1951
with a 4-0-1 record through the
first five games. But the four
wins came on the road, the tie at
home before puny crowds. Stan
ford followed that start with two
straight losses at home and only
won two games at home all sea
son.
All in all, Stanford dominated
on the road, going 5-1 away but just
2-2-1 at home. (The Liberty Bowl
loss was at a neutral site). The sole

road loss came at the hands of Rose
Bowl champion USC, and the Card
lost by just one point.
So back to my original point.
The fans need to get involved!
Don't be satisfied to sit and talk to
all your friends and be a passive
member of the worst cheering sec
tion I've ever been a part of.
I realize that although Stanford
is a top athletic university, most of
us are here for the education. But
trust me when I tell you sitting in
the hot sun for several hours with a
fading buzz is much more fun if the
crowd actually gets into it. I've
done it with and without the
crowd, and I promise it's so much
better with the crowd.

Robin reminds students that Home
coming is Saturday vs. Oregon.
