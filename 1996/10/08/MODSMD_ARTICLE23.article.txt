Sacramento St, 2

Men's soccer overcame the blis
tering heat of late Sunday after
noon in Sacramento to tie Sacra
mento State 2-2. The Cardinal (4-
2-3, 0-0-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) began the scoring in
the first half when senior Erik
Morrison beat three Hornet de
fenders before bending the ball
around the goalkeeper into the net.
Morrison's goal was the only
goal for the Cardinal in the first
half, though coach Bobby Clark
said his team "drummed together
some of their best soccer in the
first half."

'A tie was not really
what we wanted, but
it's not going to kill us.'
— Sfeve Kirschbaum

In the second half, the heat
began to sap the Cardinal's energy
and allowed the Hornets the op
portunity to score, tying the game
at one apiece. Neither team was
able to score in the remainder of
regulation, forcing the game into
overtime. Although both teams
were physically drained by the un
relenting heat, each managed to
find the net in the overtime period.
After Sacramento State scored
on a well-executed play, the Cardi
nal responded with sophomore
midfielder A.J. Sauer, who took a
cross from freshman midfielder
Andy Hemmerich that skipped off
a defender's head and one-touched
it from about 12 yards into the
right corner of the net.
Shortly after Sauer's goal,
Stanford got another opportunity
to score. Steve Kirschbaum, a se
nior striker, got a breakaway
chance but was unable to convert.
Neither team got a good scoring
opportunity after Kirschbaum's,
ending the game in a 2-2 tie.
"We played well enough to
win," Kirschbaum said. "A tie was
not really what we wanted, but it's
not going to kill us."
Clark praised his team's display

of character in overcoming the
one-goal deficit in overtime to end
the game in a tie but also said his
team grew complacent early on in
the second half.
"The team showed a lot of grit
and determination," Clark said.
"We started to wilt in the last 10
minutes though, and we lost a lot
of momentum. We played much
more evenly with Sacramento in
the second period. It was as if we
were content with a 1-0 lead."

The Cardinal will match up
against Oregon State and Wash
ington this weekend in two key
home MPSF contests. The physi
cal Beavers will meet Stanford on
Maloney Field at 4 p.m. Friday.
Kirschbaum said Oregon State
is a tough team, but the "revenge
factor" will be in full force. The
Beavers handed the Cardinal its
worst loss last year (5-0), though
this year brings to the field a new
team with a new coach. On Sunday

Oregon State took fourth-ranked
Washington into overtime tied 2-2
before the Huskies managed two
more goals.
Washington's victory over Ore
gon State was its ninth straight
after losing its season opener. Led
by junior forward James Boyce,
the Huskies will meet the Cardinal
this Sunday at 2 p.m.
"Oregon State will be a very
hard game, but Washington will be
even harder," Clark said.
