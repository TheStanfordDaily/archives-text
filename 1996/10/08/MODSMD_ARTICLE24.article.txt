# Tennis dominates Japan in exhibition match 11-0
## 
### Jennifer Splansky 
In its first match since capturing the
NCAA Championship, the Stanford men's
tennis team crushed the Japanese Nation
al Collegiate Champion team from Asia
University. Led by All-Americans Paul
Goldstein and Ryan Wolters, the men ap
pear ready to defend their national title.
Winning all eight singles matches in
straight sets, as well as all three eight
game pro-sets, Stanford's 11-0 victory
sends a message to the competition that
the Cardinal is back once again.
"I was very satisfied with how the
match went and how we played," said
coach Dick Gould. "Our top eight players
all got to play and it was nice to get the
freshmen involved. This is going to be an
exciting year."
Replacing graduated seniors Jeff
Salzenstein, Jim Thomas and Ricky Beck
er are three of the top freshmen in the na
tion. Twin terrors Mike and Bob Bryan, as
well as Geoff Abrams, provide new blood to
last year's team. These exciting frosh gave
impressive performances on Friday.
The match against Japan was the first
match for the Bryan twins since capturing
the U.S. Open junior doubles title early last
month.
"It was great to play in my first Stanford
match," Bob Bryan said. "It is a real honor
to play for Stanford — the best program in
the nation. Our coaches are the best in the
world, and I am really fired up to be playing
here."
However, returning team members
sense an existing pressure, defending the
national title.
"There is a lot of pressure to repeat,"
said Wolters, a sophomore. "Three in a row
doesn't happen too often. I came out a little
nervous; it was the first match of the year "
As with any team, however, losing valu
able seniors and adding new players re
quires developing a sense of team cama
raderie..
"This is a new team," Wolters said.
"There is not the same chemistry as last
year, and it will take a while for us to get to
know each other. If we have faith in each
other, I think the team has the ability to do
really well."
The match against the Japanese colle
giate championship team was a step in the
right direction for the Cardinal No. 1

Goldstein, a senior, beat Kazushi Takeshi
ta 6-2, 7-5, and Wolters started slowly but
beat Claudia Isad Suzuki 7-6, 6-3 in the
No. 2 match.
Stanford's depth was apparent as tht
remaining team members also cruised
through in straight sets, with no score clos
er than 6-4. The Bryan twins started their
Stanford careers with victories. Mike and
Bryan defeated Takeshi Yoshino 6-2, 6-2
and Wataru Ochi 6-1, 6-1, respectively.
In the other four singles matches senior
Grant Elliott knocked off Yoshihirc

It is a real honor to play
for Stanford — the best
program in the nation. I am
really fired up to be play
ing here.'

Hashimoto 6-2, 6-4, while freshman Geoff
Abrams beat Vivian Gen Horiguchi 6-2, 6-
2. Juniors Charles Hoeveler and Misha
Palecek also got some action, as the exhibi
tion format allowed for eight singles
matches. They defeated Kazumiro
Hayashi 6-3,6-3 and Nobuki Nakamura 6-
2, 6-4, respectively.
In doubles, Stanford only allowed the
Japanese a combined total of four games in
the three matches. The Bryan pair was not
tested at the No. 2 doubles position due to
a Japanese injury, but Goldstein and
Wolters sailed to an 8-0 victory at No. 1
against Ochi and Hashimoto.
The Card handled the Japanese 8-2 in
the Nos. 3 and 4 spots as Elliott and
Abrams defeated Takeshita and Yoshino,
while Hoeveler and Palecek crushed
Hayahi and Nakamura.
"The Japanese have improved (since
last year)," Gould said. "We may have been
a hit nervous, but it was just a work day, a
day at the office."
Next on the agenda for the men's tennis
team is the Ail-American Tournament in
Austin, Tex. Goldstein and Wolters earned
a birth to this tournament by being named
All-Americans last season, and the Bryan
twins earned a wild card berth through
their performances in the U.S. Open.
