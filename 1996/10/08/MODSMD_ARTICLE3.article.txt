### Dana Hangai Staff writer 
Partying students in Gavilan Friday
evening were dealt an unpleasant surprise
when Stanford police officers entered the
dorm and cited one student for dispensing
alcohol to minors.
According to Stanford Police Chief Marv
Herrington, officers patrolling the campus
first issued a minor in possession citation to
a student standing in front of Florence
Moore Hall. When the officers asked him
where he had received the alcohol, the stu
dent told them he had come from Gavilan,
an all-freshman dorm.
While the officers were walking toward
the dorm, they found another student who
was intoxicated and under 21. However, he
was not currently in possession of any alco
hol and was not cited, Herrington said.
Once the officers were Inside, they found
one minor giving out both hard liquor and
beer from a dorm room. He was cited for dis-
pensing alcohol to minors, after
which the party dispersed. No other
citations were issued, according to
Herrington.
There were a number of people
drinking at the party, Herrington
said. "When my people went in and
began asking questions and discov
ered what was going on, the party
just kind of faded away," he said. "I
don't believe this was a party that
was organized in the sense that it
was sponsored by the hall."
Gavilan resident staff members
confirmed that the party was orga
nized by residents and did not in
volve staff members.
Some students felt the police
should not have entered the dormi
tory.
"I don't think it was the place for
the police to bust in," said freshman
Mike Ying, a Flo Mo resident. "I
think they should only have come in
if there was a registered complaint."
Dean of Students Marc Wais said
the police's reaction was a typical re
sponse to the situation and not evi

dence of an administrative crack
down on parties.
"The Stanford police department
could have cited anyone in that com
plex who was drinking and under
age, but they didn't," Wais said.
Police also were in attendance at
a party Friday night hosted by the
Theta Xi fraternity. Herrington said
officers noticed the crowds and dis
cussed whether the party should
continue with Taxi representatives.
The Taxis volunteered to close the
party, he said.
Despite the number of citations
issued by the police during the last
three weekends, Herrington said
the instances of minors in posses
sion is consistent with previous
years' totals.
"I don't see any difference from
this year to another," Herrington
said. "It's amusing because every
year, people think we're cracking
down."
Wais echoed Herrington's view.
"We've had three weekends, and
each weekend the number of alcohol
violations has decreased," Wais
said. "As dean I'm concerned be
cause the perception does not mir
ror the reality, but instead the per
ception is taking on a life of its own."
