# Review committee hears faculty voices
## Changes to CIV debated 
### Elise Lipkowitz 
A meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the
proposals of the CIV Design and Review Commit
tee demonstrated that strong feelings about CIV
are not relegated to students.
The meeting included discussion of revising the
requirements for the cultures, ideas and values
course; reducing CIV to a two-quarter sequence,
engaging freshmen in closer interaction with fac
ulty; and linking CIV to the writing requirement

and the recently proposed freshman seminar pro
gram.
The committee, chaired by English Prof. Robert
Polhemus, reported that surveys given to last
year's senior class revealed some students wanted
greater emphasis on cultural commonalities, while
others wanted diversity stressed.
Several faculty members took issue with the
survey results, suggesting that the views of CIV
faculty have not been so far con
sidered by the committee.
"Almost all of the people who
teach in CIV are amazed and ap
palled that it has taken a full
year for an initial meeting with
those of us who teach in CIV,"
Classics Prof. Marsh McCall
said.
Assoc. Anthropology Prof.
James Fox also warned that the
value of data taken from seniors
may be limited, as continual
changes are being made to the
program. With an internal CIV
committee conducting similar
surveys each quarter, he said, the
information may be out of date.
Several other faculty mem
bers questioned the need to re
vise the CIV curriculum at all.
"French republics last longer
than the CIV curriculum," said
Assoc. Admissions Director
Jonathan Reider, who said he
has observed the curriculum
change four times since 1962.
The issue of the relationship

between freshman seminars and
CIV dominated the discussion.
Faculty members emphasized
their view that three quarters of
CIV are vital to the continuity of
the program and that a mandato
ry freshman seminar would
strain student schedules.
Options could include replac
ing the third quarter of CIV with
a seminar or
offering the seminars as options.
McCall warned that the devel
opment of the freshman seminar
program must be done delicately
to avoid the negative result of
pitting the programs against one
another.
Professors also mentioned
concerns about stretching facul
ty resources too far. Some pro
fessors questioned whether pro
fessors would be able to offer a
full range of departmental cours
es in addition to their CIV and
freshman and sophomore semi
nar responsibilities.
Despite the lengthy discus
sion, the results of the meeting
were inconclusive. "Invite us
back when you have proposals,"
English Prof. David Riggs sug
gested, "and bring the provost."
