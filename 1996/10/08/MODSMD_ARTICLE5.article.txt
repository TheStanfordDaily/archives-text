# Alumnus analyzes the beat artists
## Speech offers anecdotes about Kerouac and other insights 
### Theresa Vargas 
Stanford graduate and author of "The
Birth of the Beat Generation" Steven Watson
spoke to about 175 people in Annenberg Audi
torium yesterday about the beat culture, call
ing it "an extremely messy concept."
Watson described the beat generation — a
group of writers and artists who were at the
height of their creativity in the 1950s — as
"the beginning of a new thought process of a
younger generation," pointing at the three
main focuses of the group's writing: uncen
sored self expression; "derangement of the
senses," either through drugs, visions or
dreams; and art superseding conventional
morality.
Watson's presentation included a slide
show of beat artists accompanied by personal
anecdotes of their lives. His speech was part of
a tour to inaugurate "Beat Culture and the
New America," a current exhibition at the
deYoung Museum in San Francisco.
Watson touched on writers such as Jack

Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Bur
roughs, as well as "beat icons" like Neal Cas
sady.
"Kerouac was always writing, always had a
notebook with him, [wasl always taking in the
world around him," Watson said. "In the
midst of a chaotic life, these notebooks were
always neat and organized."
He said Kerouac's well-loved book, "On the
Road," a veritable bible for followers of the
beat culture, went through many versions. Fi
nally in April 1951 he taped pages of the man
uscript together in "one long scroll" and typed
for three weeks to finish the novel.
Watson said that while initially he found
the writings of beat authors to be somewhat
dark, "I found as I read further that the heav
iness I initially felt became somewhat
lighter."
Watson described the beat generation as an
"opposition to the kind of America that was
seen in the 19505."
"Beats favor spontaneity, as seen in jazz,
and the derangement of the senses. Beats

favor spirituality: They favor non-national
ism, something like the universal man," he
said.
The discussion brought back memories for
people in the audience.
"It was part of my era," said contemporary
art dealer Paula Kirkeby, adding that when
she was around 18, she met Kerouac and Cas
sady. Kerouac "was just a guy. They used to
come by the coffee house and just talk. He was
very energetic but that was probably drugs."
Kirkeby also said that although the beat era
was extremely difficult to comprehend, Wat
son has a clear grasp of it.
"He has a real relationship with the artists,
even though he's not of their generation," she
said.
Other spectators had their own reasons for
attending. "I just wanted to extend my art ed
ucation a bit," said Patty McGuigan.
A few scattered students also filled the au
ditorium.
