What we're about...
Wc realize there's some
question about what
exactly Allied Signal
"does."
tf
We are a manufacturer of
aerospace and automotive
components, chemicals,
fibers, plastics and
advanced materials.
Everything from spark
plugs to aircraft engines,
from commercial aircraft
guidance systems to
circuit board laminates,
from sonar systems to high performance fibers.
Where we stand...
Many companies talk about change. We make it
happen. A company-wide change initiative set in place
just five years ago is delivering results. Sales, which
currently stand at $14+ billion, have grown by $2.5
billion and earnings have risen at a compound average
annual rate of 25%. Our stock price has quadrupled
since 1991.
You should be there...
Have we gotten your attention yet? Allied Signal has
impressive growth momentum. If you are interested in
finding out more about one of the top performers in
