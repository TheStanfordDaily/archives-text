IRONICALLY, THE TIME TO START
SAVING FOR RETIREMENT IS WHEN IT LOOKS
LIKE YOU CAN LEAST AFFORD IT.
Can t afford to save lor retirement?
The truth is, you can't afford not to.
Not when you realize that your retirement
can last jo to So years or more. You'll want
to live ill least as comfortably then as you
do now. And that takes planning.
By starting to save now, you can take
advantage of tax deferral and give your
money time to compound and grow.
Consider this: Set aside just Sioo each
month beginning at age So and you can
accumulate over by the time
you reach age oS. But wait ten years and
you II have to budget $2 19 each month
to reach the same goal.
Even if you're not counting the years to
retirement, you can count on TIAA-CREF
to help you build the future you deserve —

annuity plans, a diverse portfolio of invest
ment choices, and a record of personal
