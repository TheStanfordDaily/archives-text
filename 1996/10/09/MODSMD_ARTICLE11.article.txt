## Dole clowns around 
### 
LYNDHURST, N.J. (AP) -
Bob Dole sharpened his criti
cism of President Clinton yes
terday and promised to hit
harder on the administra
tion's ethical controversies in
their next debate. "Bozo's on
his way out," Dole said of his
rival.
Dole targeted Clinton's
integrity in two fiery speeches
before rains cut short his
New Jersey bus tour and
chased the GOP nominee
back to his Washington cam
paign headquarters.
"His word's no good. My
word is good and I'll keep my
promises to the American
people," Dole said, telling vot

ers not to believe Clinton's
line that the GOP ticket
would cut Medicare to pay for
tax cuts.
"Who is this guy? What
does he know about benefits,"
Dole demanded.
One man in the crowd

shouted to Dole as he shook
his hands, "Please get Bozo
out of the White House." Dole
called back, "Bozo's on his
way out!"
Dole spokesman Nelson
Warfield sought to play down
the offhand remark as a

"light moment along the
ropeline." But it recalled the
final weeks of President
Bush's 1992 campaign when
Bush referred to Clinton and
A 1 Gore as "two bozos" who
had less foreign policy exper
tise than a dog.
