ROME (AP) — Surgeons
who removed Pope John Paul
ll's troublesome appendix
sidestepped questions yester
day about hand tremors and
other health problems but
predicted the 76-year-old pon
tiff would be "sitting in an
armchair tomorrow."
The doctors did say they saw
no signs that a benign colon
tumor removed in 1992 had
returned.
The pope's vital signs held up
well during surgery at Gemelli
Polyclinic, and he came through it
successfully, they said.
John Paul quickly regained
consciousness after general
anesthesia, greeting and
thanking everyone.
"He should be sitting in an

armchair tomorrow," said Dr.
Corrado Manni, chief anes
thesiologist for the 50-minute
surgery.
"The appendix that was
the cause of the pope's ills
doesn't exist any more," said
Manni.
The appendectomy aimed
to cure what the Vatican said
were recurring bouts of
inflammation and fever that
caused John Paul to cancel
some public engagements this
year. Frequently, the pope's
energy flags and he walks
with difficulty.
That image of the leader of
the world's 950 million
Roman Catholics generated
concern that a bowel tumor,
removed in 1992 and

described as benign, had
returned.
"This is the moment to
demythologize these fantasies,"
said the chief surgeon, Dr.
Francesco CrucittL "I exclude it
categorically. There is no secret."
A radiologist, Dr. Corrado
Colagrande, added: "The doc
tors were happy. They are
very fond of this pope."
But even as doctors called
the appendectomy successful,
they wouldn't discuss other
aspects of the pope's health.
Journalists shouted out
questions on whether a
marked tremor in the pon
tiffs left hand is a sign of
Parkinson's disease — a neu
rological disorder marked by
tremors and a shuffling gait

— and what the battery of
medical tests showed.
Crucitti would only say
that the pontiff is under the
care of "other specialists" for
other ailments.
Crucitti operated on the
pope in 1981 after a Turkish
gunman shot the pontiff in
the abdomen during an assas
sination attempt and again in
1992 for the tumor.
Yesterday, surgeons first
had to remove adhesions, or
scar tissue, from the previous
operations before tackling the
appendix.
Crucitti said the accumu
lated scar tissue helped keep
the inflammation from
spreading throughout the
abdomen.
