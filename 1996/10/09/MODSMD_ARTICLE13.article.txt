# Arafat makes public visit to Israel
## Mideast leaders meet for more peace talks 
### 
CAESAREA, Israel (AP) - With
Palestinian negotiators back at the table
after walking off in anger, Yasser Arafat
made his first public visit to Israel yes
terday and pledged to keep his police
from firing again on Israeli soldiers.
Sitting in garden chairs on the ter
race of President Ezer Weizman's villa,
Arafat and Weizman traded compli
ments, shook hands for the cameras and
agreed there was no alternative to
peace.
The cozy exchange capped Arafat's
transformation in two years from
Israel's arch foe to its most important
peace partner.
Yesterday's meeting came less than
two weeks after deadly gun battles
between Israeli and Palestinian security
forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip

that left 78 people dead.
The cordial luncheon and Arafat's
promises contrasted sharply with the
deep discord evident at Israeli-Palestini
an peace talks on Israel's border with
Gaza.
On Monday, Palestinian negotiators
balked at Israeli demands for improved
security arrangements for Jewish set
tlers in the West Bank town of Hebron,
where an Israeli troop pullout is long
overdue.
Only the intervention of U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross brought the Palestinians
back to the table that night.
Israel said it wanted to retain the
right of "hot pursuit" of suspected
Palestinian assailants into areas that
will come under Palestinian control in
Hebron.
