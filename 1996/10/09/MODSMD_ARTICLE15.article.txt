Planning Office should
lobby county officials to
light up Junipero Serra

WHETHER IT'S JOGGING
the popular Campus
Drive loop or driving
home after a long workday, chances
are that most members of the Stan
ford community have had to navi
gate their way along Junipero
Serra Boulevard in the dark. For
some, it's a regular part of their
commute; others use the road only
occasionally. But all those who
drive the stretch between Page Mill
and Alpine roads at night can attest
to its unmitigated darkness.
While sufficient lighting is a con
cern everywhere on campus,
Junipero Serra presents a particu
larly egregious example of poor
lighting. The only lights between
the Alpine and Page Mill intersec
tions are stationed right around the
Campus Drive and Stanford
Avenue intersections. Otherwise,
there are neither human-scale
lights nor regular street lights to
help out pedestrians, bikers or
drivers.
The most dangerous stretch of
road lies just northwest of the point
that Santa Maria Avenue hits
Junipero Serra. Here the windy
road rises to a slope high enough
that oncoming cars become impos
sible to see until the last second.
Ordinarily, this would not be an
unusually dangerous situation.
However, because there is no street
lighting, most drivers use their
brights at night and are thus tem
porarily blinded by oncoming cars
at the last second when the poten
tial for crashes is greatest.
Junipero Serra is one of a hand
ful of rights of way on campus that
is public and managed by the Santa
Clara County Department of Roads
and Airports. The county, not Stan
ford, is responsible for road mainte
nance and safety improvements.
Unfortunately, the county classifies
Junipero Serra as a rural, non-resi

dential road which means that it
has relatively low priority.
And one could certainly make a
case that designating the road as
"rural" is more of a sentimental
attachment than an accurate
description.
But the fact is that any major
improvement of the lighting along
the road would have to come from
the county.
This is where the University's
Planning Office should come in.
The University cannot unilaterally
plan and execute lighting improve
ments, but the Environmental and
Community Planning division
ought to bring the issue of Junipero
Serra lighting to the attention of
county officials.
Stanford does own the land on
both sides of the road. Stanford stu
dents, faculty, staff and visitors are
the primary users of the road. The
Planning Office would do all those
who traverse the road at night a big
favor if it lobbied for the erection of
street lights ali along Junipero
Serra, not just at the major inter
sections.
The Planning Office works regu
larly with county and municipal
officials on a whole panoply of
transportation-related issues. Cur
rent development plans for the
Sand Hill Road corridor call for a
widened road, an expansion of the
Shopping Center and new housing.
The result of all of this develop
ment will undoubtedly be increased
traffic along Junipero Serra.
Stanford's Planning Office thus
has every reason to ask the county
to take a new look at Junipero
Serra.
In the meantime, there is no rea
son not to erect small-scale, even
temporary, lighting along the popu
lar jogging stretch between the two
Campus Drives. This temporary
pedestrian lighting would only have
to go up on the north side of the
road to be effective.
The campus community should
not have to wait for a tragedy to
wake up to the fact that Junipero
Serra is a dark and dangerous road
at night.
