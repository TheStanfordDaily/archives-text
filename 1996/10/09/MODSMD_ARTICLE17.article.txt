## Bring back the bonfire 
### 
I WANT A fire. A big fire. Big enough
to be seen from miles away. Big
enough to make Beavis proud. And
damn it, I want it in Lake Lag.
It's been four miserable years since
the last Big Game Bonfire. With the
exception of a few crusty coterms and
fifth-years, no undergraduates were here
the last time Stanford had a REAL pre
game weenie roast.
I'm no bio major, but I've got a few
questions that maybe someone can
answer: How is it that an endangered
species such as the California tiger sala
mander can be wiped out from virtually
all of its natural habitat except our own
man-made Lake Lagunita? What is a
greater threat to the salamanders: an
event which brings humans into their
habitat once a year, or a two-year
drought which kept Lake Lag dry,
apparently preventing them from repro
ducing? What could harm the salaman
ders more: the bonfire or the new park
ing lot which this summer replaced an
empty field marked "biological test
zone"?
Two reports have been promised on
the fate of the salamander: a biological
study (to determine if in fact there really
are salamanders in the area) and a feasi
bility study to determine the impact of
human land usage (such as the bonfire
and the new graduate student housing
project) on salamander habitat.
The bio report finally came out this
summer, declaring that yes, salamanders

do exist, and no, there's no immediate
danger of extinction. It also said that if
steps aren't taken, Stanford could be
salamander-free 25 years from now.
Apparently long-term planners want to
build a salamander habitat on the other
side of Junipero Serra Boulevard, elimi
nating the problem altogether.
The feasibility report (which will
decide not just the fate of the bonfire, but
also the fate of the University's multi
million dollar housing facility) has been
delayed. Last year's scheduled ground
breaking for the new dorms was post
poned pending the outcome of the report.
However, the administration apparently
became impatient, and as anyone who
has tried to park their car in west campus
can tell you, construction has indeed
begun. Nevertheless, Stanford can't open
the new residences until the feasibility
report gives the OK.
Why then, would the University risk
millions of dollars without knowing
something about the final report? Either
Stanford knows that the report will clear
the way for the new dorms, or someone
should be fired for pissing away $15 mil
lion on an uncertain project. Since the
administration can't possibly be that
dumb (can it?), I'll assume the former.
If the dorms can open, the bonfire
should return. It's that simple. All I
know is that the first administrator who
defends the new housing project while
condemning the bonfire should be pub
licly flogged. It shouldn't take a three

year research project to conclude that the
"permanent" dorms constitute a more
serious threat to the salamanders than
an annual bonfire.
I believe the feasibility study will even
tually give the go-ahead for the bonfire,
and that it CAN do so in time for this
year's event. Three years ago, the Axe
Committee itself voluntarily postponed
the bonfire pending further information.
That information is becoming available
only now. Said Axe Comm chair Jeremy
Schreiber, "We're not out to harm the
salamanders, but if the feasibility study
approves, we don't want to wait another
year." All they're waiting for is a report
(which Stanford has already decided to
ignore) that could come out any time
between tomorrow and next summer.
Unfortunately, time is running out for
the Class of '97. Big Game is less than
seven weeks away, and Axe Comm needs
about a month to prepare for the event.
They're ready and willing, as long as the
feasibility report is released in the next
two weeks. So to the administration, I
humbly request that you act now and
give us your blessing to resume this awe
some tradition.
