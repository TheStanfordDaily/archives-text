## Slain by the dagger: the secret history of the gender DR 
### 
"ls this a dagger I see before me?"
— Macbeth
EVEN MACBETH HAD nightmares
about fulfilling that damn gender
requirement. He'd be calmly throw
ing a cocktail party for King Duncan and
Mac Duff and any ghosts who decided to
show up, but the moment everyone else
went up to bed, Macbeth would start flip
ping out again over that stupid dagger.
And he wasn't even a senior.
I see much of myself in that doomed
Scotsman — as I too must face the dagger
before my days here are through. "Tomor
row, and tomorrow, and tomorrow," said
Shakespeare's tragic hero — but I've got to
graduate soon. "Next quarter, and next
quarter, and next quarter" has been my
mantra for four years now, but sooner or
later I'm going to have to just suck it up
and meet that DR.
(For you freshmen out there, DR stands
for "Distribution Requirement," which is
exactly like your GERs, but cooler. Why
general education? If I wanted a general

education, I'd go to ITT Tech, wouldn't I?
'Nuff said.)
It's not that I'm bitter about being
forced to take a gender studies course —
believe me, I love gender. I'm just a little
bitter that Stanford's selection of daggered
courses could be counted on just one hand
of a seven-fingered man. Or woman.
I checked the fall quarter time schedule
and just seven courses fulfill that political
ly correct puppy. And three of those suck
ers are in the French and Italian Depart
ment. I didn't even know we had a French
and Italian Department, let alone that it
leads Stanford in the groundbreaking field
of gender studies.
Looking for suggestions, I asked a
friend of mine last week which class she
had taken to fulfill the dagger, and she told
me that she hadn't technically completed
the requirement yet. But she was hoping to
petition a course that she had taken.
"It didn't count as a gender course," she
said.
"Which course?" I asked.
"Sex and Gender in East Asian Reli

gions," she replied.
And I looked it up — Religious Studies
170: "Sex and Gender in East Asian Reli
gions" does not count for the DR! Who
writes this stuff? Who draws in that all
powerful little sword? I picture a clandes
tine meeting held in a dark, smoky board
room where a few dozen men and women
dressed in dark suits meet to discuss which
seven courses will be emblazoned with the
honorary dagger.
"Zis meeting shall determine all zee
courses for zee dagger," says Pierre. He's
French.
"Let's aahhhh — how you say — screw
Religious Studies again, eh?" says Isabella.
She's Italian.
"I know,"says Juan, who crashed the
meeting. "Let's choose interesting classes
that will fuel debate over society's oft
ignored paradigms and focus our energies
into understanding how gender affects per
ceptions of authority, power and success in
today's world."
Juan is shot. His body is dumped in the
Claw.

But Juan had a point. Gender studies
courses aren't typically about "gender"
studies at all — they tend to focus more on
"estrogender" studies. "Female Saints,"
"Images of Women in French Cinema" and
"Women's Voices in Contemporary Italian
Literature" aren't courses about gender;
they're courses about women. So,
shouldn't the women of this campus be
outraged that the University requires
them to spend five units studying them
selves?
Besides, what could you possibly
learn about women in "Female Saints"
that you couldn't learn from a subscrip
tion to Cosmo? "Female Saints" may
have midterms every quarter, but
Cosmo has a quiz every month. (Or so
I've heard.)
I'm not trying to imply that gender
studies isn't important; it just seems to me
to be a really bizarre and redundant
requirement at Stanford. After all, didn't
we all suffer through three quarters of CIV
freshperson year? And what about Writing
and Criticized Thinking? We've all been

exposed to the material, and those of us
who were inspired by it went on to study
and learn more about it.
And the rest of us went on to learn more
about different things such as economics
or mechanical engineering.
All I know is that, like Macbeth, I need
to accept my fate and fulfill that DR — or
I'm not getting a diploma. I'm sure it'll be
fine, and I'm sure I'll become a better per
son for it. Honest. But that doesn't change
the fact that there is some bizarre set of
circumstances at work resulting in a
ridiculously pitiful list of courses to fulfill
this requirement. And, of course, how
many of these fulfill the World Cultures
DR (GER: 4a) as well?
Zero.
But that's just a coincidence, I'm sure.
At least that's what Pierre and Isabella
have told me. I'd ask Juan, but he hasn't
come home yet.
