# Prop. 211 examined in law debate
## 
### Jim Tankersley 
Two Bay Area lawyers bat
tled it out last night at the
Stanford Law School, debat
ing the pros and cons of Propo
sition 211.
Lawyers Joseph Tabacco
and Timothy Roake squared
off in the debate, sponsored by
the Stanford Federalist Soci
ety and held in the Law

School's Moot Courtroom. They argued the mer
its of Prop. 211, a referendum that would make
it easier in California to bring lawsuits alleging
securities fraud.
A highly complex measure dealing with state
securities regulation, Prop. 211 is a dramatic ex
pansion on existing federal laws. The proposition
would essentially change state law to provide a
new course of action to any person or entity
whose pension or retirement funds suffer a loss
due to "fraudulent" behavior in connection with
the purchase or sale of securities.

According to the wording of the proposition,
that behavior includes "willfully, knowingly or
recklessly" making false statements, omitting
facts or participating or assisting in any decep
tive practice or scheme.
Arguing for the measure, Tabacco painted
Prop. 211 as a tool for the common man, saying
that it "is aimed at protecting retirement and re
tirees."
The measure, he said, was drafted in re-

sponse to the federal Private Secu
rities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. That law made severe
changes to federal regulation of se
curities fraud, changes that Tabac
co said left investors without pro
tection against corporate fraud.
"The reason that '211 is neces
sary," hesaid, "is to plug the gaping
hole that was just recently punched
in laws that have been around for
50 years."
Roake countered that the refer
endum would damage business in
Silicon Valley. He said he fears Prop.
211 would open the floodgates of
frivolous lawsuits in the state. The
resources needed to fight those law
suits would eliminate jobs, he said,
and additional positions would be
lost as companies flee the state and
its litigation overflow.
He also attacked the proposition
on more fundamental grounds. The

measure, he said, is an "end run"
that would circumvent both the leg
islative and judicial branches of the
federal government, allowing one
state to dictate national laws.
Prop. 211 would turn "the fed
eral system on its head," Roake
said. "Would we allow the great
state of South Carolina to set na
tional policy on tobacco?"
Even relatively small parts of
the measure were hotly contested
by the two men. One such provision
would award punitive damages in
cases of "willful, outrageous or de
spicable conduct" — less attorneys'
fees and expenses — to the state
general fund. Roake called this pro
vision damaging to investors and a
blatant effort to further line the
pockets of securities lawyers.
"It's designed for a cottage in
dustry of attorneys that would
handle these suits," he said.
Tabacco, a securities lawyer,
disagreed. Another of the bill's pro
visions, he noted, creates penalties
for bringing "frivolous lawsuits" to
court.
