## Research examines biodiversity, exotic species 
### Anne Ruimy 
A new research project at
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve
will study whether or not changes
in biodiversity affect the invasion
of exotic species.
In particular, researchers will
be investigating why yellow
starthistle, which was brought
from Mediterranean regions to
the West Coast in the 1800s, has
started spreading uncontrollably
in the last decades and is now
invading nearly half of all Califor
nian grasslands.
"Eight million acres of grass
lands in California are invaded by
starthistle," said Jeff Dukes, a
graduate student in biology who
is coordinating the project.
"It is taking over in many
cases," Dukes said. "It is spread
ing more rapidly than anything
else. There is no sign that it will
stop. It'll expand until it exploits
its habitat."
Once it has started invading,
yellow starthistle is very hard to

control. One method that works
involves repeated burning of the
grassland at the end of the sum
mer — when fuel is abundant but
starthistle seeds have not yet
started spreading.

'It is spreading more
rapidly than anything
else. There is no sign
that it will stop. It'll
expand until it
exploits its habitat.'

But, according to Dukes, the
best way to deal with invasive
species is prevention.
Yellow starthistle's characteris
tics make it an unfavorable compo
nent of the California grasslands
for several reasons.
It is dangerous to humans who
come in contact with its long, cac
tus-like spines. It is also toxic for
horses who might eat the plant.
Horses who feed on it get
"chewing disease," which means
they will chew their food and water
endlessly. The horses are unable to
swallow the food, and they eventu
ally starve to death.
Yellow starthistle came from
Turkey and other Mediterranean
regions in the dry ballast of ships
and as a contaminant in crop
seeds. It was first registered in Cal
ifornia in 1869.
According to Dukes, the species'
population began to explode in the
beginning of the 1980s. Often
there is a lag period like this dur
ing which the population builds
up, he said.
"What triggers the explosion is
not sure." Dukes said. "In some
cases it is series of wet years. All
you need is one year of good condi
tion."
The biological controls in a
species' natural environment usu
ally prevent it from becoming a
problem. Scientists also speculate
that the number of different
species in an ecosystem, or its bio

diversity, may affect the ease with
which an exotic species invades a
new environment.
In the classical hypothesis,
when many species are present in
the same place, they each have dif
ferent strategies to use the
resources of the environment —
they occupy different niches.
In an ecosystem with high bio
diversity, there are not many nich
es left for a newcomer, making it
difficult for the newcomer to
invade the ecosystem.
There have been very few
experiments done in the past to
test this theory, so no good gener
alizations can be made based on
evidence, Dukes said.
The Jasper Ridge project will be
a comprehensive study, looking at
all the aspects of invasion of an
ecosystem by yellow starthistle,
including nutrient use, water use,
as well as the main criteria of inva
sion: seed production, seed weight
and plant weight.
"Hopefully my study will be suf
ficiently comprehensive that each
bunch of results will tell a story;
each answer will be interesting on
its own," Dukes said.
Even though the invasion of
yellow starthistle is of great impor
tance to the scientific community
and to the economy, Dukes has
designed and funded the project by
himself. He received a Mellon
grant from Jasper Ridge and an
earth science fellowship from
NASA.
According to Hal Mooney,
Dukes' adviser, the project has
international implications. The
project may uncover clues as to
why some species are invaders in
the West Coast of North America
but not of South America, or vice
versa, even though the regions
may share similar climates.
"Starthistle is present in Chile
but is not a problem," Mooney
said. "We know that we have a dif
ference [and] for the first time we
can do cross-comparisons."
Dukes started his project two
weeks ago and is setting up his
experiments now. Apart from
Dukes, there are three undergrad
uate students doing independent
research projects associated with

yellow starthistle and one under
graduate student who is paid to
help set up.
Jen Brown, a senior earth sys
tems major, is one of the students
doing independent research with
Dukes. She said she does not mind
the hard work of shoveling piles of
soil into a grinder, despite the blis
ters from previous days of shovel
ing.
She makes a clear distinction
between setting up the experiment
and the actual research.
"Research is interesting and
fun; you have much freedom; you
apply what you learn. Setup is dif
ferent from research," Brown said.
More than 250 pots, filled with a
mixture of soil and sand, will be
planted with different combina
tions of seeds of native plants and
starthistle, so the number of
species present in the pot will vary.

When many species
are present in the
same place, they
each have different
strategies to use the
resources of the
environment.

The plant species placed in the
pots will be selected among four
groups: annual grasses, perennial
grasses, early season forbs and
late season forbs. Each of these
groups is considered a functional
group because each one occupies a
different niche than the others.
According to Dukes, it is diffi
cult to predict if biodiversity will
have a positive or negative effect
on the invasion of communities by
yellow starthistle.
"I really don't know" if this
experiment will predict the effects
of biodiversity, Dukes said. "It
would be really exciting if I could
find something really stark. But I
think I'll find something about
functional groups" and how each
one directly effects the invasion of
vellow starthistle.
