S,What's the difference.
• between AM and FM
A. AM and FM radio are both
• methods of sending infor
mation over radio waves.
The information doesn't nec
essarily have to be sound,
though. 'IV broadcasts are trans
mitted as a combination of FM
and AM signals — FM for the
sound and AM for the picture.
Theoretically, you could even use
AM and FM to transmit informa
tion between two cans tied
together. It's just not as effective
— otherwise, everyone would be
surfing the Information Super
Ball o' Yarn today, instead of
that Internet thing.
Radio waves are a form of
electromagnetic radiation, just
like visible light. The two
attributes of electromagnetic
radiation that tire important to
the transmission of information
are frequency and amplitude.
The frequency of electromag
netic radiation controls how
quickly the waves "vibrate."
The other attribute is the
amplitude, which measures how
strong the radiation is.
As you probably have figured
out by now, you can send infor
mation over radio waves by
changing either the amplitude or
the frequency.
Not surprisingly, when you
change the amplitude of the
wave, that technique of informa
tion transmission is called ampli
tude modulation (AM). Even less
surprisingly, when you change
the frequency to transmit infor
mation, you are using frequency
modulation (FM).
Amplitude modulation trans
mits sound waves by adjusting
the amplitude of the radio wave,
or carrier wave, to match the
changes in the sound.
In AM transmissions, the fre
quency is kept constant and the
amplitude is adjusted. I he

changes in amplitude fire inter
preted by the receiver and con
verted back into the original
sound. If AM radio was broad
cast using visible light, each
radio signal would have its own
color, and the signal would be
broadcast by brightening and
dimming the light.
Commercial AM radio sta
tions transmit at set frequencies
between 535 kilohertz and 1,605
kilohertz.
The good thing about trans
mitting at these frequencies is
that they can be reflected and
refracted by the layer of the
atmosphere called the iono
sphere. This means that AM
radio can be heard very far away,
even over mountains, because
the signal can "bounce" off of the
sky.
The problem with AM radio is
that interference from things
like lightning, machinery and
UFOs affects the amplitude of
the signal. This is why during
thunderstorms and alien
attacks, AM radio sucks even
worse than it usually does.
Frequency modulation trans
mits sound by adjusting the fre
quency of the radio wave.
The mechanics behind fre
quency modulation are more dif
ficult, but the main point is that
the amplitude of the radio wave
stays constant, while the fre
quency fluctuates. This is like
keeping a light at a constant
brightness, but changing the
color to transmit information.
Commercial FM stations
transmit between 88 megahertz
and 108 megahertz, frequencies
which aren't reflected by the
ionosphere. That's why FM sta
tions need to be placed in high
spots where they can cover more
area. However, FM isn't affect
ed by changes in amplitude, so
the things that interfere with
AM signals don't affect FM sig
nals.
Unfortunately, controlling
annoying passengers who fiddle
with your car radio is still beyond
the power of modern science.
