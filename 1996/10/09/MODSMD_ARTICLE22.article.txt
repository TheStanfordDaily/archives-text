# Initiative will allow radiation laboratory to add to current array of projects
## SSRL receives infusion of funds

The Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory, the source
of the brightest X-rays on Earth,
just received an infusion of $4.3
million thanks to the Scientific
Facilities Initiative.
The 1996 initiative was passed
by the Department of Energy,
which provides most of the fund
ing for the laboratory.
Associated with the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, the
laboratory captures the X-rays,
called synchrotron radiation,
which are thrown off as electrons
speed through an accelerator at
nearly the speed of light. The
radiation is emitted into nine
beam lines connecting to 25
experimental stations, allowing
many different experiments to be
conducted simultaneously.
The initiative was passed in
recognition of the fact that bud
getary constraints have limited
the service provided by the labo
ratory and similar facilities in
recent years. Because of the large
ratio of fixed to variable costs, rel
atively small budget decreases
had large effects on operations,
and the laboratory has been run
ning at far less than full-time.
The new funding measure will
allow the laboratory to now oper
ate for nine months, adding three
months to the previous schedule.
The facility runs 24 hours a day.
While the length of the average
experiment can vary from days to
weeks, the laboratory has experi
ments booked covering 93 percent
of the time that the accelerator is
running.
"The value of the facilities ini
tiative is that it allows us to do an
even longer run. However, we
continue to be oversubscribed,"
said Borah McSwain, assistant to
the director of the laboratory.
Experiments conducted at the
laboratory range from X-ray crys
tallography used to determine the
three-dimensional shape of pro
teins to examining microcontami
nation in silicon computer chips
During its 1996 run the laborato
ry had more than 1,000 users

from 153 different institutions.
More than 200 papers appear
yearly in journals based on
research at the laboratory.
The work on microcontamina
tion in computer ships is impor
tant because the slightest flaw
can cause widespread malfunc
tion, said Adam Brand, a senior
device engineer at Intel Corp.
"An average Pentium chip has
3.5 million transistors and mil
lions of interconnecting wires. A
defect on any one of those causes
the whole thing not to work,"
Brand said.
"The first step in eliminating
contamination is to detect it. The
size of the contaminants
detectable on the chip is deter
mined by the wavelength of the
light used," Brand said. "X-rays
should detect even smaller parti
cles than is possible with current
laser-based systems. This may be

required in more advanced tech
nologies which will be sensitive to
smaller contaminating particles."
Environmental science is one
of the fastest growing segments of
the laboratory's research.
"There is great concern about
environmental problems that face
our society," said McSwain.
"There are so many areas where
environmental contaminants are
a serious concern. The scientific
activity in this area has been
fueled by need and demand."
In addition to providing gener
al funds for the laboratory, the
funding initiative also provided
individual awards for specific pro
jects. Gordon Brown Jr., a geology
professor, will receive $781,000
over three years to continue his
environmental research.
Working in the area of toxic
decontamination. Brown's group
has used the laboratory's facilities

to determine that a carcinogenic
and very mobile form of chromi
um found in soils at Department
of Energy weapons sights, are
rapidly reduced to a relatively
benign and immobile form by
magnetite.
Groups studying phytoremedi
ation — the use of plants to clean
metal contaminated soil — have
used the laboratory's facilities to
demonstrate that certain plants,
known as chromium hyper accu
mulators, can also reduce danger
ous chromium to a more benevo
lent form. As an important step in
maximizing metal accumulation
in these plants, researchers have
also studied how cadmium moves
from the root to the leaves of
these plants.
The laboratory is located on
site at SLAC's Sand Hill facility.
Group and individual tours can be
arranged by calling 926-2050
