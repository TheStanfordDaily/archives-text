## Talented freshman brings enthusiasm to water polo 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
You're sitting in Otero lounge, trying
to think about something else to over
come your anxiety and failing.
You're waiting for a water polo play
er, a highly touted freshman. Finally, a
T-shirted figure slips in and introduces

himself as Sean Joy. He is munching on
nacho chips carried in the rolled-up edge
of his T-shirt, and he is not enormous,
blond or looming.
He is not what you expected, and you
are glad.
He is smaller than you'd expect for a
water polo player — he seems normal
size, proper proportions, manageable.

He has very tan skin and candid brown
eyes and blond-tipped dark hair. He
shrugs a lot and fidgets as he sits and
asks constantly, "Y'know? Y'know?" He
is self-deprecating and funny and a bit
vague; he is, as he describes the water
polo team, "Goofy — just really goofy."
A native of Orinda, Calif., Joy "grew
up swimming." He started playing water

polo his freshman year in high school. It
seemed natural, because the water polo
coach was his old swim coach and a fam
ily friend.
Joy started playing a bit late. "Where
I grew up, everyone swims, and >/ater
polo's not as big a sport as in Southern
California," he said. He kept swimming,
but lost interest in it and began playing
more water polo, which was "just fun" in
his words.
Joy hails from a distinguished water
polo tradition at Miramonte High
School, which has produced a host of
Olympians and national team members
in the last decade, including Colin Keely,
Kirk Everest and Stanford alumnus
Rick McNair. In Joy's time there, the
varsity team won three consecutive
North Coast Section championships, a
feat never before accomplished.
But things could have been different
for Joy.
"I was going to play football, but my
friends talked me into playing polo," Joy
said. "I had a good time, so I just stuck it
out. I never really thought it would get
me anywhere, y'know?"
So, instead of being a middle line
backer, Joy is a right-handed driver, re
sponsible for getting the ball to the hole
man for shots. While some drivers have
special shooting or passing skills, Joy
counts on his speed.
"I swim," Joy said. "Basically, I just
swim around a lot. It's fun, y'know —
being a small guy, playing with the big
guys. No one really expects you to do
anything, so when you do something
good, it's like,' All right.'
"The guys are so nice to me, and help
me learn — I'm a freshman, that's what
I'm supposed to do," he said and
shrugged.
Joy said the older team members pro
vide support and leadership. "Brian
Wallin is my hero," he said.
"Sean has brought a certain enthusi
asm to our game," said Wallin, the
team's senior captain. "It's motivating
to play with someone who's really excit
ed about playing water polo.
"He has the potential to be a great
player," Wallin said, noting Joy's speed
and quickness.
When asked why he came to Stanford,
Joy said, "It was the best school I could

go to for water polo — I needed some
thing to get me in here." Rick McNair,
coach of Joy's freshman team, put in "a
really good word" with Dante Detta
manti, Stanford's coach.
"Dante had a lot of faith in me," Joy
said, and Dettamanti seems to expect a
lot from his young player.
Like other fall-sport athletes, Joy

'It's motivating to play
with someone who's real
ly excited about playing
water polo.'

came to Stanford in mid-August to begin
preseason training. The water polo team
members lived off campus. Joy stayed in
Los Altos with teammate Jeremiah Ro
bison, which he said was great because
"his mom cooked us dinner."
Joy gets to see his own mother once a
week, when his parents make the hour
long drive to campus to watch Stanford
games.
"It's nice — they take me out to lunch
and bring me stuff from home, since I
brought, like, a pillow (to school] with
me," Joy said.
The contact with home was especially
nice during the first week of school,
when Joy was feeling typical freshman
dislocation.
"I really missed my family and my
friends back home," Joy said. "I mean,
you spend your whole life with these
people, and then you come out here and
you're supposed to be best friends with
everyone."
Being away for water polo matches
right as the year didn't help ei
ther, but now Joy said he feels like he's
getting a chance to meet more people
and adapt to life at Stanford.
Joy said he'll almost definitely play
water polo for the rest of his time here.
"Well, I'm definitely not going to
graduate early, so there's no problem
there," he said.
"I like it here. It's really different
from high school, though — everyone's
so focused."
