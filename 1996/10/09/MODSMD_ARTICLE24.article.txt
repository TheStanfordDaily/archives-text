The Cardinal cross country teams were once again the
pacesetters at Saturday's 23rd annual Stanford Invita
tional, an all-day race featuring more than 50 college
teams.
Junior Kortney Dunscombe led the Stanford women's
team, which finished in first place with 29 points, well
ahead of second-place Brigham Young and UCI.A, which
came in a distant third. Dunscombe took third in the 5,000-
meter race with a time of 17 minutes, 29 seconds, topping
her eighth-place finish last year.

Senior Greg Jimmerson led the men's team, which came
in first with 27 points, ahead of Brigham Young and Cal

finished in second place in the 8,000-meter race in 24 min
utes, 58 seconds — only 24 ticks behind the winner. Jim
merson, who is a two-time Cardinal co-captain, is expected
to be one of the nation's top runners in both track and cross
