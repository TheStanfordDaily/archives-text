# Copycats
## Cal looks familiar 
### 
Don't look now, but the
next thing you know the
school across the bay
might change its colors to red
and white.
The athletic program at Cali
fornia may not boast the depth of
Stanford's, but in the three
major sports — football and
men's and women's basketball
— the Golden Bears have taken
undeniable steps to follow in
Cardinal footsteps. Before long
the Chronicle's Glenn Dickey
will cut in the food line at Steve
Mariucci's press conferences and
blast the young football coach in
print two days later.
Twelve months ago, such a
startling development never
seemed possible. But since then,
athletic director John Kasser has
been on a rampage. Keith
Gilbertson, Todd Bozeman and
Gooch Foster have all moved on
to dimmer and bleaker things,
and their replacements all have
the ability to inject new life into
their respective programs.
At first glance, Mariucci and
Tyrone Willingham seem to have
little in common. Willingham is
an intense man, and while not
devoid of charisma as some have
suggested, he'll never be de
scribed as flamboyant.
On the other hand, Mariucci's
optimism was infectious from
day one, and he was welcomed
with open arms as The Man Who
Replaced Keith Gilbertson. Will
ingham replaced Bay Area

demigod and Hall of Famer Bill
Walsh.
But the two have more in com
mon than anybody could have
imagined. Both are in their early
40s and had no previous head
coaching experience. Both
helped improve offenses in the
NFC Central prior to returning
to the collegiate school where
they made their most recent im
pact. And now that Cal is 5-0,
both were undefeated five games
into their collegiate careers with
huge road wins over the defend
ing conference champion.
Barring a collapse, Mariucci
will follow in Willingham's foot
steps as the second consecutive
rookie Pacific 10 Conference
Coach of the Year. But much as
Willingham's squad sputtered to
a 3-4-1 mark after its initial suc
cess, Cal could very easily do the
same — after all, Oregon State
took the Golden Bears to triple
overtime. Cal will likely end up in
a lackluster bowl and look for
ward to the next season with
higher expectations. Where have
we heard that before?
Bill Braun (who?) enjoyed
considerable success at that Mid
west hotbed of hoops, Eastern
Michigan. But before we scoff,
we should recall that Mike Mont
gomery came from Montana,
where fans are crazy about their
Grizzlies but still realize the Big
Sky Conference is far from the
big time.
We have seen what Mont
gomery can do, and Braun cer
tainly boasts credentials from his
time with the Eagles to indicate
that he could bring the Golden
Bears to respectability on and off
the court. Of course, Montgomery
didn't have to take over a pro
gram under heavy NCAA scruti
ny, but the voung and unassum

ing Braun appears to have the pa
tience and skill to operate under
the unfavorable conditions.
But certainly, Braun is a
"Jason Kidd 360-degree turn
around" from the most recent
man to occupy the Cal head
coach's chair. Todd Bozeman
brought in tremendous talent;
unfortunately, he couldn't keep
or develop it.
What he did leave was a black
stain on Cal's reputation — the
impression that Cal would do any
thing to win and join the ranks of
the elite. By selecting Braun to
run the ship, Cal may reduce its
flashiness and desire for automo
biles. But players will stay, and
Cal may become fundamentally
sound for the first time in memo
ry. Montgomery has proven that
coaches can be nice, play by the

rules and win with execution of
fundamentals, and Kasser wants
Cal to go the same route.
Still, Cal's most blatant and
commendable copycat stunt came
with the hiring of Marianne Stan
ley to replace Dr. Gooch Foster.
The venerable Dr. Gooch was the
dean of Pac-10 coaches and an all
around well-liked person. Hut in
the past three years her program
had plummeted to unprecedented
depths. Th? hiring of Stanley sig
naled that Cal was finally ready to
commit to women's basketball
and stop devoting all its hoops en
ergies to Bozeman's shenanigans.
Of course, Cal plucked Stanley
from Stanford's deep coaching
staff. A true pioneer in women's
basketball, Stanley had an admin
istrative bum rap sheet longer
than even Bozeman's, which she
proved was blatantly undeserved
throughout her brief, unforget
table tenure here. Foster was
hard not to like; Stanley is impos
sible not to respect.

She inherits a cellar-dweller,
but give her the time and re
sources and Cal will excel. Success
will perhaps not come now, per
haps not in 1997-98, but Cal will
instantly be more fundamentally
sound and will never give up as
the Golden Bears did at times last
year. And once Stanley recruits
her own players, Cal will contend
for Pac-10 supremacy year in and
year out.
Cal won't win the Sears Direc
tors' Cup any time soon, but Cal
won't finish a combined 27-39 in
the Big Three like last year, ei
ther. If Stanford isn't careful,
Oski may turn into a replica of the
Tree — or at least learn how to
avoid letting the Tree rip its head
off.

Jeremy reminds Cal to change its
Web page to reflect Bozeman's de
parture (see http://www.cal
