## Cal looks familiar 
### 
Don't look now, but the
next thing you know the
school across the bay
might change its colors to red
and white.
The athletic program at Cali
fornia may not boast the depth of
Stanford's, but in the three
major sports — football and
men's and women's basketball
— the Golden Bears have taken
undeniable steps to follow in
Cardinal footsteps. Before long
the Chronicle's Glenn Dickey
will cut in the food line at Steve
Mariucci's press conferences and
blast the young football coach in
print two days later.
Twelve months ago, such a
startling development never
seemed possible. But since then,
athletic director John Kasser has
been on a rampage. Keith
Gilbertson, Todd Bozeman and
Gooch Foster have all moved on
to dimmer and bleaker things,
and their replacements all have
the ability to inject new life into
their respective programs.
At first glance, Mariucci and
Tyrone Willingham seem to have
little in common. Willingham is
an intense man, and while not
devoid of charisma as some have
suggested, he'll never be de
scribed as flamboyant.
On the other hand, Mariucci's
optimism was infectious from
day one, and he was welcomed
with open arms as The Man Who
Replaced Keith Gilbertson. Will
ingham replaced Bay Area

demigod and Hall of Famer Bill
Walsh.
But the two have more in com
mon than anybody could have
imagined. Both are in their early
40s and had no previous head
coaching experience. Both
helped improve offenses in the
NFC Central prior to returning
to the collegiate school where
they made their most recent im
pact. And now that Cal is 5-0,
both were undefeated five games
into their collegiate careers with
huge road wins over the defend
ing conference champion.
Barring a collapse, Mariucci
will follow in Willingham's foot
steps as the second consecutive
rookie Pacific 10 Conference
Coach of the Year. But much as
Willingham's squad sputtered to
a 3-4-1 mark after its initial suc
cess, Cal could very easily do the
same — after all, Oregon State
took the Golden Bears to triple
overtime. Cal will likely end up in
a lackluster bowl and look for
ward to the next season with
higher expectations. Where have
we heard that before?
Bill Braun (who?) enjoyed
considerable success at that Mid
west hotbed of hoops, Eastern
Michigan. But before we scoff,
we should recall that Mike Mont
gomery came from Montana,
where fans are crazy about their
Grizzlies but still realize the Big
Sky Conference is far from the
big time.
We have seen what Mont
gomery can do, and Braun cer
tainly boasts credentials from his
time with the Eagles to indicate
that he could bring the Golden
Bears to respectability on and off
the court. Of course, Montgomery
didn't have to take over a pro
gram under heavy NCAA scruti
ny, but the voung and unassum
