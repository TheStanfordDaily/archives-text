### Vanessa Arrington Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's golf
team is leading after the second
round of play at the Edean Ih
lanfeldt Invitational at the Sa
halee Country Club in Redmond,
Wash.
The Cardinal extended its lead
from one stroke to 15 by firing a
blistering 289 yesterday on the
par-72, 5,920 yard course. With a
score of 590, Stanford has a con
siderable cushion over host Wash
ington (605) and New Mexico
(623).
All five women golfers are in
the top 25, and senior Mhairi
McKay leads the pack at par, firing
consecutive 725. Senior Andrea
Baxter reduced her roommate's
lead to one stroke by scoring a bril

liant second-round 69, the only
subpar score of either round.
Freshmen JaeJean Ro (76-72—
148) and Julie Dunn (77-76-153)
are right behind their teammates,
tied for third and sixth places, re
spectively. Sophomore Michelle
Sperry is currently in 22nd place
with a score of 161, including an
83 yesterday.
The final round of the invita
tional begins at 8 a.m. today.
The men's golf team didn't fare
nearly as well in its road tourney
that ended yesterday. Coming in
14th place out of 15 teams, the
Cardinal men finished at the bot
tom of the pack at the 1996 Ping-
Golfweek Preview Invitational
played at the Conway Farms Golf

931 at the end of the invitational

Sophomore Joel Kribel's 11-
over-par 224 (75-76-73) was
enough to tie him for ninth place,
after his 1-over-par 73 in the final
round. East Tennessee State's
Keith Nolan, the winner of the
tourney, reeled in an individual
213 (69-73-71).
Stanford's Conrad Ray and
Jake Poe came in tied for 35th and
41st places, respectively. Senior
Ray scored a 77-80-74—231 and
