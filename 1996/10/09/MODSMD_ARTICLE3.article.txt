### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
Libertarian ideas have gained support among
students, according to the results of a recent po
litical quiz sponsored by the Stanford Libertari
ans.
"A lot of people are not aware of libertarian
ism," said sophomore Brian Singerman, presi

dent of the Stanford Libertarians. "It is a philos
ophy more than a political party."
The fundamental basis of libertarianism, ac
cording to Singerman, is true freedom from gov
ernment intervention in an individual's econom
ic and personal life. Libertarian views include the
support of legalizing what members consider vic
timless crimes, such as drugs, prostitution and
gambling.

Poll results showed that students have voiced
agreement with libertarian philosophies but are
not aware of libertarianism, according to Singer
man, who added that most people view them as
extremists.
According to the poll, 70.2 percent of those
surveyed favor eliminating the draft, 60.6 per-
cent are against governmental cen
sorship and 63.4 percent favor re
pealingsex regulation laws. Howev
er, only 20.7 percent favor of repeal
ing drug laws, 6.9 percent were in
favor of ending taxes and 29.9 per
cent supported unregulated immi
gration and emigration.
"I find this party attractive be
cause of its openness," said sopho
more Jonathan Russell, president of
the Stanford College Republicans.
"Libertarians have a lot to con
tribute to the political system."
Although students have shown a
growing interest and support of the
Libertarians, the party is still small.
"Of the registered voters on cam
pus, I didn't see many registered in
the Libertarian Party," said senior
Dave Thomas, chair of the Stanford
Democrats, which organized a voter
registration drive in White Plaza
during the past couple of weeks.
According to Thomas, only 1 per

cent of the voters registered in the
drive declared as members of parties
other than Democrats, Republicans
and Greens.
"This year's election is positive
for parties like the Green Party and
the Libertarian Party," said senior
Rudy Delson, president of the Pro
gressive Student Network, repre
senting the Green Party on campus.
Both the Libertarians and the
Progressive Student Network are
advocating voters to "vote their
conscience" and vote for the respec
tive candidates of their party. They
agree that President Clinton al
ready has the California vote.
"By voting for [Libertarian can
didate] Harry Brown, the votes will
give more exposure," Singerman
said.
The Stanford Libertarians are
looking forward to their first year as
an active campus group. Singerman
is planning freedom forums and dis
cussions on various issues through
out the year.
"There is something for every
one in the Libertarian Party," he
said.
