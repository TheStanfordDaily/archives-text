# $800K grant to help study hepatitis C
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
Researchers led by Assoc. Chair of Medicine
Harry Greenberg recently received a major
grant to study hepatitis C, a common chronic
viral infection.
Coordinated by the National Institute of Al
lergy and Infectious Diseases, the funding
amounts to $800,000 annually for four years.
The investigation led by Greenberg will involve
scientists from UC-San Francisco and Washing
ton University in St. Louis.
Hepatitis C was fust discovered in the late
1980s by Chiron Corp., a Bay Area biotechnolo
gy company. Greenberg describes it as "very

common" and estimates that "at least several
million Americans" are currently infected with
the virus.
Hepatitis C is transmitted mainly by sharing
needles and less efficiently through sexual con
tact. It is a major long-term cause of liver dis
ease.
According to Greenberg, there are "no great
treatments" available for hepatitis C today, as
existing solutions only have a limited effect. No
vaccine for the virus has been developed.
Greenberg's research will focus on three as
pects of hepatitis C. First, the scientists will at
tempt to understand how the virus enters cells
and which host immune cells will inhibit it.
Second, according to Greenberg, "Nobody has

yet been able to grow hepatitis C in cell culture."
The researchers will use molecular techniques to
try to understand the replication of the virus.
The third component of the study is an ex
amination of the virus in immunodeficient indi
viduals, including liver transplant and AIDS pa
tients.
Other research centers selected by the insti
tute include the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, USC and the University of Wash
ington.
Greenberg will soon travel to Washington,
D.C., to discuss his research with the institute's
officials. He said national coordinators hope for
a high level of cooperation between the research
centers.
