# Survey finds grads more optimistic
## Job search worries now less prevalent 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
A majority of last year's gradu
ates are more optimistic about
their careers than those in previ
ous classes, men more so than
women, according to a recent
Gallup Poll.
But at Stanford, the trend may
not be so easy to detect, campus
career advisers say.
The poll found that while 1996
graduates have an overall sense of
confidence and a strong interest
in entrepreneurial careers,
women are slightly less optimistic
about their career paths and pur
sue different vocations than men.
Lynne Dotson, the interim di
rector of the Career Planning and
Placement Center, said there is no
perceivable difference in the way
men and women at Stanford view
their futures.
"Although liberal arts stu
dents are more concerned about
their futures than (computer sci
ence] and engineering students,
Stanford students, in general, are
and have been more optimistic
than their counterparts at other
schools," Dotson said.
Nearly 1,000 seniors from 88
colleges and universities around
the country participated in the
second annual Graduate Manage
ment Admission Council / Gallup
senior survey.
More men than women sur
veyed said they were interested in
entrepreneurial positions, science

professions and corporate man
agement. Women, on the other
hand, preferred education and
health care professions.
The council commissions the
annual study of college seniors to
assess their interest in post-grad
uate education and different ca
reers.

According to the poll, graduate
business school attracts one in
every five seniors heading to gradu
ate school, making it the primary
choice for graduate education.
Twenty-seven percent of men going
to graduate school said they were
likely to attend business school,
compared to 16 percent of women.
The Stanford Graduate School
of Business — with its 28 percent
female student body — actively
recruits women through mentor
ing and buddy programs.
Deciding between motherhood
and career advancement can com
plicate issues for women, said
Sharon Hoffman, assistant direc
tor of MBA admissions at the
Business School.
