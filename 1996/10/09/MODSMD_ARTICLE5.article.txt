In its first meeting of the yeai
the Board of Trustees expressec
overwhelming support for a stud)
contending that alumni from mi
nority groups feel forgotten by the
University.
The study, formally presented
in a report yesterday, was one ol
many topics on a busy agenda at
this week's meeting.
Compiled by the Task Force on
Minority Alumni Relations, the
report said that while 98 percent
of minority alumni surveyed were
happy with their undergraduate
experience, only 20 percent still
felt strongly connected to the
Stanford community.
With these findings, the report
recommended that a "clearing
house" be developed to coordinate
opportunities for all alumni te
participate in University life. Ir
addition, the report urged the Uni
versity to establish more connec
tions between minority alumn

and undergradu
ates, such as a ca
reer mentoring
program.
"The report
was very enthusi
astically received,"
said Rol>ert Bass,
chair of the board.
"We very much ap
preciated the hard

work done by | trustee 1 Charles
Ogletree."
Ogletree, a Stanford alumnus
and Harvard University law pro
fessor, organized the task force
and participated in taking testi

around the nation
Bass stressed that the report's
recommendations included all
alumni, regardless of race, be

ates' loyalty to the University
should be a campus-wide and on
going effort
"These [undergraduates] are
