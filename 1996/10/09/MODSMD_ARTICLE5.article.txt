# Trustees hear alumni report
## 
### David Stein Staff writer 
In its first meeting of the yeai
the Board of Trustees expressec
overwhelming support for a stud)
contending that alumni from mi
nority groups feel forgotten by the
University.
The study, formally presented
in a report yesterday, was one ol
many topics on a busy agenda at
this week's meeting.
Compiled by the Task Force on
Minority Alumni Relations, the
report said that while 98 percent
of minority alumni surveyed were
happy with their undergraduate
experience, only 20 percent still
felt strongly connected to the
Stanford community.
With these findings, the report
recommended that a "clearing
house" be developed to coordinate
opportunities for all alumni te
participate in University life. Ir
addition, the report urged the Uni
versity to establish more connec
tions between minority alumn

and undergradu
ates, such as a ca
reer mentoring
program.
"The report
was very enthusi
astically received,"
said Rol>ert Bass,
chair of the board.
"We very much ap
preciated the hard

work done by | trustee 1 Charles
Ogletree."
Ogletree, a Stanford alumnus
and Harvard University law pro
fessor, organized the task force
and participated in taking testi
mony from minority alumni
around the nation
Bass stressed that the report's
recommendations included all
alumni, regardless of race, be
cause maintaining undergradu
ates' loyalty to the University
should be a campus-wide and on
going effort
"These [undergraduates] are


Bass
the future of the University. They
are going to be the leaders in their
communities," Bass said. "One
should not wait until a student re
ceives his degree before one starts
letting him deal with alumni."
Bill Stone, president of the
Stanford Alumni Association, has
been working for a year on a study
which will detail where the associ
ation should be in the year 2000.
He said the task force's report was
an important step in increasing
alumni involvement.
"I know a lot of alumni who
don't want to make a donation but
want to volunteer, and they want
to know, 'What else can I do?' "
Stone said. The clearinghouse
should give volunteers this infor
mation, he added.

In other business, the board
discussed various ongoing Univer
sity projects, such as the proposed
merger between Stanford Health
Services and the UC-San Francis
co Medical Center. The board has
yet to vote on the issue.
Bass said the UC Regents, who
govern UCSF, will meet next week
to decide on the merger's
progress. After that meeting, a
committee appointed to represent
the board will negotiate the final
terms of the merger if it is eventu
ally approved.
Bass said the new medical cen
ter will be under private rather
than state control.
"In order to compete effective
ly, it is imperative that the opera
tion of the [hospital] be private,"
Bass added.
He said he hopes that the merg
er will be completed by the end of
the year.
The board also discussed open

ing an Overseas Studies adminis
trative office in Moscow to help fa
cilitate bureaucratic difficulties.
"As the former Soviet Union
has grown more complex and be
come more formal, it was only
natural for us to open a formal of
fice in Moscow," Bass explained.
The office will aid students and
faculty at the current Overseas
Studies center with visas and
other diplomatic issues.
Construction issues, as always,
made an impact on the meeting.
The School of Education, which
has not had any major renovations
in 60 years, has been approved for
a facelift. Bass did not elaborate
on a completion date or costs for
what he termed a "timely rebuild
ing.
In other construction-related
news, Bass said annual construc
tion costs are currently at $100
million but will rise to $180 mil
lion annually before falling.

These costs were mainly attrib
uted to the new Science and Engi
neering Quad and the Center for
Clinical Studies at the School of
Medicine.
Along with the costs of the new
structures, the seismic re
strengthening of the Quad has
contributed to the University's fi
nancial burden, Bass said. How
ever, he added that "we can see
the end" of that renovation pro
ject.
In addition, a site on Jasper
Ridge Biological Preserve has been
set aside for the reburial of Native
American artifacts unearthed dur
ing construction, Bass said.
"We have from time to time dis
covered some remains in con
struction," Bass said. "We've had
great support from Native Ameri
cans on this issue."
A specific site at Jasper Ridge
has yet to be determined, Bass
said.
