### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Having survived college, stan
dardized tests and a brief stop in
the real world, the entering class
of students at the Graduate
School of Business arrived on the
Farm last month in pursuit of the
most lucrative graduate profes
sional degree, the MBA.
The median first-year compen
sation package offered to gradu
ates of the school tops $100,000.
The 374 members of the new
class, the Business School's
largest ever, have enrolled in the
nation's most selective MBA pro
gram. Only one in 14 applicants
was offered admission this year,
and 84 percent of those accepted
elected to join the Class of 1998.

''New students come from 33
countries and from 142 under
graduate institutions," said Janet
Zich, an information resource offi
cer at the Business School. She
added that members of the class
include 39 graduates from Stan
ford, 37 from Harvard University
and 24 from the University of
Pennsylvania.
Seven members of the class re
ceived a perfect score on the Grad
uate Management Admissions
Test given to potential applicants.
Almost 30 percent of the class
received undergraduate degrees
in_econuuuos. Another quarter
majored in engineering and com
puter science.
"The average class member
had 3.9 years of work experience
at the time of application," Zich
said. Students came from 246 dif
ferent companies. Management
consulting, investment banking

and high technology firms made
up the largest share of employers.
Statistically, the class is similar
to those that preceded it. Women
make up 29 percent of new stu
dents. Twenty-eight percent of the
class are from foreign countries
and ethnic minorities represent a
slightly smaller portion of this
group than last year's, falling

from 25 to 24 percent.
The Class of 1998 is not just
statistically impressive; Zich also
emphasized the diversity of its
members.
"There is a gold medal water
polo player, an Olympic rower and
a swimmer who was given the
honor of carrying [Guam's] flag in
the opening ceremonies at At

lanta," she said. "There is a pro
ject manager for a national labor
union, a financial analyst for the
NFL, a finalist in the Sundance
Film Festival, a record company
founder and a platoon commander
in the U.S. Marine Corps.
"I am excited," she said. "And I
can't wait to get to know all of
them."
