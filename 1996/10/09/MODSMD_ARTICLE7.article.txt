# Taking Time Off
## 
### Emily Richmond Contributing writer 
Palo Alto resident Molly Hanks was expected
back at Duke University this fall for her junior
year, but instead she was waiting to meet the
author of "Taking Time Off' at the Stanford
Bookstore.
Before heading to work at a Palo Alto restau
rant where she waits tables, she stood at the
Bookstore, clutching a copy of the book, which
had been sent to her by some friends back at
Duke. They had already heard one of the co-au
thors, Ron Lieber, speak.
"They sent it to me in the mail, express,"
Hanks said. "They called me on the telephone
and said, 'This guy is coming to your campus.
You have to read this book, and you have to talk
to him.' "
The book that Hanks and her friends have
found so inspirational is a collection of essays
detailing the "time-off" experiences of students
from across the country. Co-authors Colin Hall
and Ron Lieber hope to make a compelling case
for delaying college in favor of exploring anoth
er country, volunteering or working.
Hall and Lieber have been best friends since
their pre-kindergarten days in suburban Chica
go. They played together, studied together and
even planned on attending Amherst College to
gether. But somewhere between their senior
year in high school and freshman orientation,
Hall decided to take a different road.
While Lieber headed off to Massachusetts,
Hall went to work and then around the wor Id.
Lieber explained his friend's wanderlust.
"There was a lot of the world he hadn't seen,"
said Lieber. "College would always be there, but
there were opportunities to make some money

Ron Lieber, co-author of the new book, "Taking Time Oft," discusses why stopping out
may be a viable option for students during a book signing at the Bookstore last week.
and travel that he probably
wouldn't have after college."
"Colin took two years off. He was
a freshman when I was a junior,"
Lieber said. "It was amazing to me
how much more he milked out of
the place in his first year or two than
I had been able to."
Hall, speaking from his office at
the New York investment firm
Morgan Stanley, described his
time off as rewarding and encour
aged "constructive risk taking.
We're not encouraging anyone to
stay at home for a year to watch
soaps."
In order to pay for a trip to
Africa, Hall worked in construc
tion. He backpacked through
Kenya, Rwanda and Zimbabwe
and learned Swahili from a local
school while he lived at youth
hostels.

Hall returned to Amherst
where he earned straight A's â€”
partly due to a renewed academic
focus he said he discovered during
his years away from the traditional
school setting.
After graduation, prospective
employers were impressed with
how Hall had created learning op
portunities for himself and lived in
Africa with limited funds. "They
thought it showed maturity and re
sourcefulness," he said.
Lieber said that while he had a
successful and satisfying college
experience and enjoys writing for
Fortune magazine and his life in
New York, he has regrets about
charting an uninterrupted course
through college.
"There is a whole lot of the
world I haven't seen, certainly not
in the way I'd like to see it, through
traveling and experiencing," he
said.
The idea to write a book came
from a classmate of Hall's who was
having trouble academically and

asked Hall for advice.
"There was no one else for him
to talk to, except Colin," Lieber
said. "He was complaining to us
about this other lack of resources
in this area, and Colin was the only
person he knew with any experi
ence taking time off."
Surprised that there were no
books of success stories and advice
from students who had taken time
off from school, Hall and Lieber de
cided to write one.
i The need for a more compre
hensive guidebook was evident to
Lieber, who recognized that Hall's
i time away from school had been
: beneficial.
; "Rushing through college, it's
hard to have any chance for reflec
; tion," Lieber said. "If all you've
t ever done is go to school, it's very
i difficult to know what you want to
j do once you're out of school."
Through e-mail and advertise
i ments in college publications, the
5 authors sought students who had
1 used their time off in unusual and

fulfilling ways. The response was
remarkable. "We had 500 people
get in touch with us," Lieber said.
The book required nearly two
years of research. "I was the jour
nalistic brain trust of the project,
and Colin was the ideas guy,"
Lieber said.
Having written for the Amherst
College newspaper and freelanced,
including an opinions piece pub
lished in The New York Times,
Lieber focused on the technical
writing of the book. Hall contacted
publishers and editors and story
subjects.
"Every last one student we
talked to, even those whose time
off didn't turn out exactly like
they'd planned, said they would do
it again," Lieber said. "Everyone
realizes that a bachelor's degree is
part of the program you need to get
a good job these days.. .. College is
great. But you have to be prepared
to take advantage of everything it
has to offer."
Lieber added that he spoke from

personal experience.
"I spent much of my first year
fine-tuning my personality and
going to parties," he said. "The so
lution isn't to come to college and
distance yourself from the parties;
the solution is to think carefully
about whether at 18 you are ready
for college."
He also acknowledged the fi
nancial constraints of a college ed
ucation. "A majority of kids who
take time off do it because they
can't afford college anymore, and
they need to make money," he said.
Lieber saved four weeks of vaca
tion from Fortune magazine in
order to visit college campuses
across the country, where he talks
to students about the book. The
positive reviews and publicity the
book has received was highlighted
when Ann Landers suggested the
book as a resource in her national
ly syndicated advice column.
At the Stanford Bookstore last
Thursday, Lieber read selections
from the book, including a passage

about a Wellesley College student
who left school to work on Presi
dent Clinton's 1992 campaign, re
turned to school and won a Rhodes
scholarship. Lieber also discussed
students in the book who volun
teered in rural Appalachia or
worked abroad.
Among the audience at the
Bookstore was Susanna Fryer, a
freshman at Stanford. She said the
book would be interesting to read,
and the resources section would
probably be very helpful.
"I think it's good to take time
off. You can learn new things that
you can't find in college. 1 might be
interested in doing it," Kryer said.
Sophomore Tom Goff said he
thought taking time off would help
some students "gain a little
perspective, do something differ
ent and maybe learn a language."
"Taking time off isn't for every
one," Lieber said. "The most im
portant thing that a student can
learn from our book is that they
have options."
