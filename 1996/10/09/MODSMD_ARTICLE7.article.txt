# Taking Time Off
## 
### Emily Richmond Contributing writer 
Palo Alto resident Molly Hanks was expected
back at Duke University this fall for her junior
year, but instead she was waiting to meet the
author of "Taking Time Off' at the Stanford
Bookstore.
Before heading to work at a Palo Alto restau
rant where she waits tables, she stood at the
Bookstore, clutching a copy of the book, which
had been sent to her by some friends back at
Duke. They had already heard one of the co-au
thors, Ron Lieber, speak.
"They sent it to me in the mail, express,"
Hanks said. "They called me on the telephone
and said, 'This guy is coming to your campus.
You have to read this book, and you have to talk
to him.' "
The book that Hanks and her friends have
found so inspirational is a collection of essays
detailing the "time-off" experiences of students
from across the country. Co-authors Colin Hall
and Ron Lieber hope to make a compelling case
for delaying college in favor of exploring anoth
er country, volunteering or working.
Hall and Lieber have been best friends since
their pre-kindergarten days in suburban Chica
go. They played together, studied together and
even planned on attending Amherst College to
gether. But somewhere between their senior
year in high school and freshman orientation,
Hall decided to take a different road.
While Lieber headed off to Massachusetts,
Hall went to work and then around the wor Id.
Lieber explained his friend's wanderlust.
"There was a lot of the world he hadn't seen,"
said Lieber. "College would always be there, but
there were opportunities to make some money
