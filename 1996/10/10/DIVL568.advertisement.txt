Who's the
Social Security
beneficiary?
You can't tell just by looking who's
getting Social Security benefits because
a parent died, is disabled, or retired.
Today, 3 million kids under age 18
get monthly Social Security benefits,
based on a parent's earnings. And,
Social Security protects more than
70 million kids.
To learn more about Social Security,
call 1-800-772-1213. Ask for the
booklet Basic Facts About Social
Security.
