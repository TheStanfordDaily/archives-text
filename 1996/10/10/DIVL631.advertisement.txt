He's back. Your housemate's boyfriend. Sitting on your sofa.
Sifting through your CDs. Hunching over the open refrigerator.
"Say," he says accusingly, "did you guys know you're out of food?"
Gee, I wonder why. You like your housemate. You value the friend
ship. But the boyfriend is "beginning to create bad feelings of
J proportions. Night after night, he appears.
First stop, refrigerator. Second stop, micro
wave. Sometimes he forgets to check whether the housemate
is even home, causing you to believe his affection is based
somewhat on the success of the last shopping trip. You think
your housemate is'beginning to SUSpect this as well,
which is probably why the housemate is not here tonight.
Sudden date with the library. The housemate's boyfriend is
talking to you again; he wants to know if you can pick up some
cheese-in-a-can next time you're at the store. You say, "I hate
to be rude, but I'm tired and you need to leave." You wait for
protests from the sofa, but there are none. But that's because
the boyfriend is not on the sofa. He's drifted over to the TV,
filling your once-quiet domicile with sounds from the shop
ping network. You can't sleep with this on. You wonder what
it's gonna take. A natural disaster?
A ... wait a minute. Well, sure. You smile, "Say, do you like
video games?" Boyfriend nods eagerly. "It's the latest thing,"
you say. "Ky friends in Paris play it whenever they want to
connect with their friends in Johannesburg. It's great for
people who like to travel." You turn toward him and say sweetly,
H You like to travel, right?"
He nods. You smile again. Type in a few commands. Hand the
wireless mouse to him. Then count. I'ive. Four. Three. Two. One.
Oh good, he's chosen FULL ENGAGE mode. Boyfriend's gone. Pood's
gone, too. Oh well. Into everyone's life a little rain must fall.
Which, you think as you catch the mouse in midair, is exactly
what it's doing in Paris right now. Damn, that's good software.
What will the next generation of software be? Come to Microsoft and shape it.
Real jobs. Real internships. With real responsibility.
