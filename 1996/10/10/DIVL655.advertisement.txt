Hey Students!
We know you're profoundly committed to your studying (snicker)
but even Nietzche needed to get out and do something different...
...why not fire up a bowl?
(Maybe this college thing is going to be better than you thought. )
Bring your current, valid college student ID into
PETROGLYPH CERAMIC LOUNGE
any weekday between 10 October and 10 November
and paint any of our hundreds of cool ceramic pieces
at HALF PRICE!!!
Finally, you can tell your mom
you're doing your own dishes.
