### Therese Lee Staff writer 
A recent survey indicating that
80 percent of minority alumni feel
isolated from the University comes
as no surprise to ethnic center lead
ers on campus.
The Task Force on Minority
Alumni Relations formally present
ed its findings in a report to the
Board of Trustees on Tuesday.
While 98 percent of minority re
spondents offered positive feedback

regarding their undergraduate educational experi
ence, only 20 percent said they continue to feel
strong ties to the Stanford community.
"The survey results are pretty consistent with
what we've been finding through our work in the ac
tivities center," said Asian American Activities Cen
ter Director Richard Yuen. He went on to praise the
study as "comprehensive" and said it "adds cre
dence to these issues and concerns raised over the
years."
Specifically addressing the issue as pertaining to
African-American students, Black Community Ser
vices Center Director Morris Graves said the report
was "not alarming."
