# Alum study no surprise
## 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
A recent survey indicating that
80 percent of minority alumni feel
isolated from the University comes
as no surprise to ethnic center lead
ers on campus.
The Task Force on Minority
Alumni Relations formally present
ed its findings in a report to the
Board of Trustees on Tuesday.
While 98 percent of minority re
spondents offered positive feedback

regarding their undergraduate educational experi
ence, only 20 percent said they continue to feel
strong ties to the Stanford community.
"The survey results are pretty consistent with
what we've been finding through our work in the ac
tivities center," said Asian American Activities Cen
ter Director Richard Yuen. He went on to praise the
study as "comprehensive" and said it "adds cre
dence to these issues and concerns raised over the
years."
Specifically addressing the issue as pertaining to
African-American students, Black Community Ser
vices Center Director Morris Graves said the report
was "not alarming."


Yuen
"That response is very typical of
African-American alumni at his
torically white universities, be
they private or public," Graves
said. "Real ties to universities have
come through ethnic centers."
The report recommended that
the University work to strength
en connections between minority
alumni and undergraduates, sug
gesting a possible career mentor
ing program.
The Asian American Interac
tive Mentoring Program —
which operates under the Asian
American Activities Center —

matches sophomores with faculty
and alumni whqgive personalized
academic guidance. The activities
center also regularly invites alum
ni to participate in career panels.
Graves said he believes strong
alumni relations are cultivated
starting in the beginning of a stu
dent's freshman year and not upon
graduation. Stanford "has to find
ways to incorporate the spirit and
culture of every group so that they
see themselves reflected through
out the institution," he said.
It is only in this way, according
to Graves, that strong ties to the
University itself can be developed.
A number of negative conse
quences could result if this trend
of minority alumni isolation con
tinues, added Benny Shendo, di

rector of the American Indian
Program Office.
"Freshmen or undergraduates
reading about [the survey] are
going to be thinking, 'When I
graduate, what is the University
going to think about me?' " Shen
do said.
This line of questioning could
have an impact on alumni contri
butions, he added.
Yuen said more funding could
be provided to ethnic centers and
alumni associations by the Uni
versity in order to conduct more
outreach efforts.
"We're always asked to do
more with less," Shendo said. "I
think it's our priority, but it's
more of the University's overall
priority."

In an ongoing endeavor to
maintain ties with alumni, the
American Indian Program Office
recently received a charter for an
alumni association.
"We have pretty active alumni,
in terms of the activities we have
going on here," Shendo said. "In
the future, better coordination
with the alumni office is certainly
going to be critical."
Shendo added that he valued
the analysis made possible by the
survey. "The report is a good
warning for the University to look
at what we are doing with the mi
nority alumni," Shendo said. "As
soon as they're out the door, they
feel alienated from what's going
on at Stanford. It's really critical
that we really look at that."
