Is nerve gas to blame?
WASHINGTON (AP) - A firm finding that
nerve gas wafted over U.S. troops in the Per
sian Gulf could open the door to benefits for
some veterans. But five years after the U.S.-
Iraqi war, the Pentagon is nowhere near ready
to link low-level exposure to chemical weapons
to a specific illness.
Nor is the medical community ready with a
cure or even treatment if ailments known col
lectively as Gulf War syndrome are found to
result from chemical agents.
These sobering assessments were offered by
government officials, veterans representatives
and medical experts in interviews yesterday
even as the Pentagon continues a massive
effort to sort out whether a demolition job after
the conflict released toxic gases over U.S. sol
diers.
Research linking chemical exposure to long
term ailments such as cancer could lead to
broad new benefits policies offered by the Vet
erans Affairs Department, VA spokesman
Terry Jemison said.
IRA bomb plans were months old
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) - The
Irish Republican Army may have planned an
attack on the British army's headquarters here
four months ago â€” before the latest negotia
tions on Northern Ireland' 3 future, police said
yesterday.
The IRA bought one of the cars used in the
attack on June 4, said Detective Chief Superin
tendent Derek Martindale, who is leading a
team of about 40 detectives in investigating

Monday's car bombings inside Thiepval Bar
racks.
Six days after the IRA bought the car, negoti
ations among nine parties and the British and
Irish governments began in east Belfast.
The IRA-allied Sinn Fein party had demand
ed entry to the talks, but was barred because
the IRA resumed its campaign of violence
against British rule in February with a London
truck bomb.
Florida politician met aliens
NEW SMYRNA BEACH, Fla. (AP) - Your
neighbor tells you space aliens cured her of can
cer. Do you:
A) Smile, nod and tell her that you, too, have
been cured?
B) Look at your watch, mumble something
about being late and get away?
C) Re-elect her to the County Council?
It's a question 53,000 voters in Volusia
County face after incumbent Lynne Plaskett
told millions of daytime TV viewers that 20
years ago, a flying saucer the size of a dinner
plate came to her house, levitated her from her
bed and scanned her from head to toe.
Within four months, Plaskett told the audi
ence on "The Maury Povich Show" in Septem
ber, her deadly lymphoma was in complete
remission, confounding her doctors who
thought it should have already killed her.
Plaskett, who is now 46, said she hopes her
TV appearance doesn't turn voters against her
when they go to the polls next month.
"People can believe me or they can not
believe me," she said Tuesday. "I'm just an hon
est person who told my story."
