# Vice presidential candidates go head to head
## Gore, Kemp stick to issues 
### 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.
(AP) — Vice President Al Gore
and Jack Kemp differed politely
but pointedly over abortion and
affirmative action last night in an
energetic debate that offered
sharply contrasting views of
President Clinton's first term.
Neither abortion nor affirma
tive action had come up in Sun
day night's debate between Clin
ton and GOP nominee Bob Dole,
but both issues generated spirit
ed exchanges between the cam
paign understudies.
Although both Dole and Kemp
are on record supporting a consti
tutional amendment outlawing
abortion, Kemp said such a dra
matic change was not in the
cards.
"There is no consensus,"
Kemp said. "A constitutional
amendment would not pass We
must use persuasion, not intimi
dation." That remark, while per
haps an accurate reflection of the
country's political environment,
was certain to alienate Christian
conservative leaders who have
been urging Dole and Kemp to
draw sharper contrasts with
Clinton on abortion and other
social issues.
Affirmative action is another
such issue, and Gore moved
quickly to put Kemp on the
defensive on that point.
The vice president recalled

that Kemp had criticized a Cali
fornia ballot initiative rolling
back affirmative-action programs
but later fell in line with Dole's
support for it after joining the
GOP ticket. Gore said he wished
Kemp had convinced Dole to
change his position instead.
"With all due respect, I do not
believe Abraham Lincoln would
have adopted Bob Dole's position
to end all affirmative action,"
Gore said, promoting Clinton's
"mend it, don't end it," approach.
For activists in both parties,
the evening had an inescapable
subplot. Gore. 48, is all but cer
tain to seek the Democratic pres
idential nomination in four
years. And if Dole loses to Clin
ton, the 61-year-old Kemp would
be considered the top early
prospect for the next Republican
nomination.
For all the speculation about
campaign 2000, Kemp and Gore
were determined to keep the
focus on Clinton and Dole.
"This economy is overtaxed,
overregulated," Kemp said in
making the case for Dole's plan to
cut taxes 15 percent across the
board Kemp said the economy
was growing a feeble 2.5 percent
a year under Clinton.
Gore, in turn, said repeatedly
that Dole and Kemp were offer
ing a "risky $550 billion tax
scheme" that would "blow a hole

in the deficit and cause much
deeper cuts in Medicare, Medi
caid. education and the environ
ment."
Kemp protested that Clinton
and Gore were practicing "dema
goguery" in trying to frighten
older Americans.
Gore promoted Clinton's plan
for targeted tax cuts to help low
and middle-class families pay for
college. Kemp countered that
government should not engage in
"social engineering" by picking
winners and losers through tax
policy.
Much of the debate was spent
on nitty-gritty policy differences,
but Kemp and Gore also took
time to talk more philosophically
about the need to improve race
relations — and about what they
agreed was a worrisome decline
in public civility.
Dole was criticized by some
Republicans after the first debate
for not attacking Clinton on
administration ethical lapses and
broader character questions.
Lehrer opened the 90-minute
debate by asking Kemp if he
agreed with the critics.
"In my opinion, it is beneath
Bob Dole to go after anyone per
sonally," Kemp said in calling for
a civil campaign. Gore thanked
Kemp, and from there the debate
proceeded politely, at times »tu»
diously.
