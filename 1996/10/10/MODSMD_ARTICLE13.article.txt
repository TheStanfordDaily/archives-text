Relocating the sorting
of our mail could help
us keep certain benefits

CONSTANT AS THE chang
ing of the seasons are com
plaints of slow service at the
Stanford post office.
The laments of students and fac
ulty stem partly from the apparent
discrepancy in mail delivery times
of letters and magazines as com
pared to the world outside of Stan
ford campus. Somehow letters that
take three to four days suddenly
need seven or eight to make it into
a Stanford post office box.
Also, letters from administrative
offices in Old Union reinforce the
adage "one week from one side of
White Plaza to the other," where
most correspondence bears a post
mark — oddly — from Redwood
City or sometimes even from San
Francisco.
And why is it that magazines
that show up on Tuesday at the
Stanford Bookstore take until Sat
urday to arrive in post office boxes?
So is it time to let the post office
go the way of privatization? Should
the University open up mail service
to free-market competition from
outside sources?
The debate over what to do is
particularly pressing now in light
of the recent expiration of the 35-
year lease. Neither the current
post office management nor the
Stanford Management Co., which
owns the space, seem willing to
compromise over their demands,
leaving future plans for either
expansion or significant change in
limbo.
The biggest roadblock to better
service the post office management
has cited is valid. The Stanford
post office, which has occupied the
same location and space since the
19605, has not grown, while the
faculty, staff and student popula
tion have expanded considerably
since then.
But conversely, it should be

pointed out that Palo Alto and its
three post offices serve a popula
tion more than triple that of
Stanford with apparently no time
delays. Then again, this may be
due to the unique demands the
University places on its postal
service. Stanford is only one of
three schools with the conve
nience of having a post office on
campus.
To its credit, service demeanor
has improved. Complaints about
grumpy or even hostile clerks have
gone down. And the office has
made an effort to reduce lines at
peak usage times — around lunch
time and before closing. At other
times, it takes maybe five minutes
to get through the line to see a
clerk.
Additionally, the post office pro
vides a convenience that is often
overlooked by students as they
return to campus. Unlike their
telephone numbers or even their
choice in majors, the post office box
and address remain a constant
throughout students' tenures here
at Stanford, provided they put in
their request to renew before the
May deadline.
Postal officials have accused the
management company of dragging
its feet on the issue, saying that the
office has been waiting for a pro
posal since spring. Even if the
management company was to give
in to the demands of the post
office, where would the new facility
go? The current position of the
post office is considered optimal —
it intersects at two major campus
pathways and its location is well
suited to students rushing to or
from class.
So the best alternative does not
necessarily require privatization or
the leasing out of services to firms
like Mailboxes Etc., but moving as
many sorting and distribution
operations off campus as possible.
Further, the management com
pany should also consider expand
ing the post office boxes available
by using the space that may be
saved through the attrition of sort
ing operations.
