Retired professor calls for Teddy Roosevelt-like morality

SEEING THE TV documentary of
Teddy Roosevelt brought back the
virile (yet gentle) moral climate he
represented for us old-timers. First, he
experienced awful bouts of asthma and
the early disappearance of his virtuous
and kind father. This was followed by
the same-day loss of his equally adored
mother and wife, which drove him mer
cilessly to be worthy of their death-deep
spiritual challenge. He flung himself
into a life of risk, grueling work, study
and service to mankind (and first, his
cherished new family).
What a man! He cared about the chil
dren and the working poor, fought the
trusts, gave us the Panama Canal and a
strong national confidence. So he is up
there on Mount Rushmore; his cousin
FDR worshipped him. But if he came to
this campus now, like Jesus in the leg

end of the Grand Inquisitor, no doubt he
would be reviled or ignored.
Those of us who were raised to
respect virtue, heroism, genius, chal
lenge, risk, sacrifice and shared with
poets Roosevelt read far into the night a
tragic, or "existential" — along with
hopeful — sense of human destiny, are
inevitably galled when we witness all
around the moral decay, the slackness,
the mediocrity, the resentment of and
ganging up against true superiority —
indeed against the very idea of truth or
beauty or saintly goodness, now deemed
elitist and passe.
One senses that, for lack of meaning
ful challenge — the tough kind their
ancestors likely faced in childbirth: war,
disease, poverty, harsher standards in
the home, school and church — the chil
dren of today typically improvise futile

risks through drugs or marauding
through shopping malls, riding motor
bikes without a helmet — or worse.
Retired, running out of years but no
curiosity, like the ancient mariner, I
often buttonhole random students on
campus and, rather surprisingly, given
the "official" liberal line of the place,
have found almost unanimous agree
ment on these points. Maybe they're just
being nice to the old guy. But my tenta
tive judgment is that Americans here or
in the country at large are walking in a
sort of daze of puzzlement and protec
tive indifference through a public and
academic climate which, given the histo
ry of human ups and downs, is totally
unrepresentative of anything deep and
abiding. They all-too-humanly go with a
shallow flow — what can they do to
shake it up? — and cultivate their own

gardens, even as they share with a
stranger their profound misgivings
about what is happening to the children,
education, high culture, manners.
In sum: We once knew better. And
knew better years in sense (not, indeed,
by skin color), preferring Mozart to rap
music or popular trash made life more
worth living. Now, suicide and despair
are distinctly on the rise. Quality and per
sonal relations are on the skids. Our cam
puses are opportunistic, social-tinkering
(a good excuse for not facing steep intel
lectual challenges) genius-scanting opera
tions, educationally, and money-making,
or sincere-providing institutions materi
ally. No one, scarcely even a voice, rises to
the occasion. We wait, like the Rice
Krispies commercial, for reality to set in.
