# Garry Grundy's meaty column showed lack of sensitivity and humor
## 
### 
When I read Garry Grundy's column
in The Daily on Tuesday, I was offended.
Not because I'm vegetarian or vegan. I
enjoy eating meat. It just bothers me that
such a moronic column managed to get so
much exposure. I mean, aren't we here to
value rationality and think smart
thoughts? Grundy's column, in my opin
ion, is a symptom of a disease rapidly

spreading among Daily columnists, infor
mally known as: "Uh, my column's due
tomorrow. What the heck do I write
about?" Unfortunately, the results of this
affliction are usually about as interesting
as the average college admissions essay or
CIV paper, both of which are often writ
ten with similar amounts of inspiration.
I'm not sure Grundy himself is even
interested in his topic. I mean, not enough
meat for carnivores on campus? My heart
bleeds. It really worries me how meat
eaters are being driven out of Stanford.
It's terrible how we can only get a burger,
chicken or steak when vegans have that
tasty salad bar full of variety every day.

Vegans or vegetarians often avoid meat for
either moral or health reasons. Grundy, as
far as I can tell, avoids greens because he's
a picky eater. If there are other reasons
involved, he doesn't mention them. Now I
know we all have those foods we just can't
stand, but whining about it to the whole
University population seems excessive. If
it weren't, I'd be the first to start a cam
paign against raisins.
Grundy then backs up his beliefs with
one of the most ridiculous analogies in
existence: Eating an apple is like eating the
ovaiy of a cow. Hmm, let's think about
that. First of all, apples spread the trees
seeds when eaten, helping them to repro-

duce successfully. Eating the ovary of a
cow doesn't exactly accomplish the same
purpose. Second, cows die when they get
slaughtered. Apple trees seem to suffer no
ill effects from having their fruit picked.
Cows have brains and nerve endings; apple
trees don't. Gee, I see the similarities.
I know that Grundy probably has a lot
of other time commitments and is doing
his best to write interesting material. My
only advice is: try a little harder. The
same advice goes out to all the other
columnists waiting to spring their half
baked writing on us.
