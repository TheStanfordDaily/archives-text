## Talent and humility, anyone? 
### 
AN OVERWHELMING popula
tion of Stanford's undergradu
ates is far more conceited than it
has the right to be. I am not talking
about those exceptional few who are
already published and like to do a read
ing every now and then. Nor am I talk
ing about any of our multimillion dollar
athletes who find it funny that Nike
makes a special shoe color for Stanford
(cardinal-colored) and like to talk about
that. And let it be known that those few
computer science majors who are
already world famous for doing whatev
er it is they do are not included in my
complaint, either.
I am talking about the people who
scored well on their SATs and continue
to talk about it now, in their junior year
of college. I am talking about the people
who consider themselves geniuses and
feel the overpowering urge to tell the
rest of us about it. And finally, I am
talking about the people who chuckle
out phrases like "and we all know how
worldly I am," or "since I am easily the
smartest person in my state". . .
This campus is overrun with kids
from families who never quite learned
that intelligence comes in many forms.
There are those who can do so well on
the (insert standardized test here) exam
that they get to meet the president.
This is a good thing.
But there are also those who can
raise a child, survive an abusive rela
tionship or spend 40 hours per week

sweeping floors without offing them
selves. That is something to be proud
of. I am not saying that if you get out of
here with a 4.0 grade-point average, you
should go cry in a corner because you
haven't really accomplished anything.
What I am saying is that you should
take your accomplishments in stride.
Talent isn't for bragging, it's for surviv
ing.
Consider, for example, my great
aunt. I was here in California when she
passed away, and so I had to take a
plane ride back to the East Coast to
attend the funeral in South Carolina.
Down South is where my roots lie,
but not my psyche. I can mimic my rel
atives only artificially, because I can't
come up with the little phrases they
pull out of the air. Things like, "You
need to go out and talk to the hens" and
"just 'cuz I am the shortest thang in
this room 'sides you don't mean you got
to throw your arm up 'round my shoul
der!" You have to grow up down there
to talk like they do. And even though
my mother hasn't lived down south in
more than 30 years, the language comes
crawling back as soon as we hit that Dil
lon, S.C., dust.
I have no idea what kind of education
my great-aunt Meater (pronounced
MEE-duh) had, but I do know this: She
affected the lives of more people than
she could have counted. She raised 13
children, none of them hers, now rang
ing in age from 60-something to 6 years

old. She was sole caretaker of two of her
sisters: one who can't walk on her own,
and one who just won't, both in their
80s.
Did I mention that she was 79? She
was. She's also the one who taught me
how to read. I never heard her utter one
self-congratulatory word, and if there is
anyone in this world that had some
thing to brag about, it was her. Worked
the farm until the day she died. Skinny
as a pole. Black and female in the South
during the '30s, the '40s, the '50s, the
'60s, most of the '90s. That's something
to be proud of.
Perhaps my experience in Structured
Liberal Education subjected me to a dis
proportionate amount of the self
obsessed blathering that is necessary in
any college setting. Perhaps I am just
oversensitive. Either way, I don't care.
The plain fact of it is that the truly
talented people that I have known have
no need to broadcast proof of their
exceptionalness, or exceptionality, if
you will. Things like that are evident.
They're true. And no SAT score could
ever have made a woman like Meater
more impressive.
