# Carolyn Sleeth: From Russia with love
## Baba-Vera cooks up some important life lessons 
### 
BABA-VERA HAS WRAPPED a
rag around her bleeding finger,
which she cut a few minutes ago
chopping beets. The stain of the blood
and the stain of the beets run together
in the fibers of the rag as she continues
to slice the sanguine vegetable.
Baba-Vera is the 70-year-old grand
mother in the family that I live with
here in Moscow, the all-powerful
babushka whose word is law. Most days
she trudges around the kitchen cooking,
muttering to herself. In keeping with
the Russian custom, she doesn't wear
her shoes in the house, baring her feet
to the cold ground.
Her feet have thickened like her fin
gers, supporting the massive body that
supports everyone around her. Like
used sink scrubbers, the skin on her
heels scratches against the linoleum
floor, and the soles of her feet have
molded to the flatness of the floor.
Her toenails are yellowed and thick,
bent up and ingrown, shriveled like

raisins. They are tough, like Baba-Vera.
Pressing down, her feet against the
floor as she carries pots to the sink and
then back to the stove, she moves heav
ily forward with each step. Heat from
her warm body and the heating oven
radiate into each other, warming the
kitchen. Forever boiling water for tea or
baking something in the hot oven, the
warmth spreads to her entire family.
Laughing rises out of Baba-Vera like
a cross between the cherry-bowl chuck
le out of Santa Claus and a cackle from
the witch in Hansel and Gretel. Her
whole being shakes with amusement at
my stumbling in Russian or at the
antics of her two 10-year-old nephews.
As a pensioner, Baba-Vera receives
only $50 a month from the Russian gov
ernment. She depends on her children
to provide money, care and a place to
live. Many elderly Russians wander the
streets during the day, begging in the
metro stations and standing aimlessly
on sidewalk corners. The elderly that do

have homes rarely leave them. In the
month that I have been here, Baba-Vera
has walked out of our apartment only
once.
Baba-Vera has also only changed her
house dress once. Sometimes, when she
is cooking, she ties on a faded apron
with a picture of a slightly foreign-look
ing, mutant, purple and orange Chip
and Dale chipmunks.
Her grayed, matted hair is tied up,
out of her face. She is thick-skinned,
like an avocado, hardened and worn by
the difficult life here.
In her apron, Baba-Vera rules the
kitchen. Every utensil, every pot is her
property. She cooks and serves every
meal for her family of six. She concocts a
fresh batch of borscht every day, brews
fresh tea, debones and smokes fish, and
bakes her version of a Russian apple pie.
No one else can touch or prepare the
food. If I try to make my own food, she
pushes me with her thick arm onto the
wooden bench in the kitchen. I can only

watch her, slowly trudging around,
chopping her beets into tiny cubes.
Once, having been benched and
unable to help, I sat and watched her
trudge around the tiny kitchen. I asked
Baba-Vera if she liked to cook. She
explained her family needed to eat, so
she cooked. She said it didn't matter if
she liked cooking, someone had to feed
them.
Ironically, Baba-Vera can't even eat
her carefully prepared meals: She has
only one tooth — it is silver and on the
upper right hand side of her mouth. The
tooth waggles there when her mouth
opens wide in laughter; she is proud
that even one tooth remains after so
many years. She eats soft rice, apple
sauce or tea, but she doesn't consume
the delicate salads or fancy meals she
prepares. But she continues to cook for
her family.
Baba-Vera toils in the kitchen,
grunting like a massive mother pig
when her piglets are milking. She

grunts from the secret enjoyment of
feeding the family she loves. Cooking is
her way of expressing her love; she
cares for them through her food. Baba-
Vera is hungry for love, and her family
is grateful for food and love her in
return.
However, cooking also gives her a
reason to keep living. Sometimes she
cuts herself with a knife, and she bleeds
a little into the bowl of beets. But the
pain isn't taken for granted. By cook
ing, she continues to be useful in a
world that has nearly forgotten her.
But the family that loves her makes it
worthwhile, and she keeps going. She
loves them, and love is all she needs.
