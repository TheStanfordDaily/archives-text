The Stanford Democrats, who have registered
1,053 voters on campus since Sept. 20, won the
ASSU's competition for most voters registered by a
student group.
"We took a multi-faceted approach to registering
voters," said junior Dave Thomas, chair of the Stan
ford Democrats. The Democrats registered voters at
Whit# Plaza, at Meyer Library during phone service
signups and during graduate check-in at Escondido
Village and Rains. They also went to house meetings
to publicize the registration drive.
"We registered the most people through tabling
in White Plaza," said sophomore Brian Free, direc
tor of community relations for the Stanford Democ
rats and head of the voter registration project. Free
added that 560 of the students they registered were
with the Democratic Party.
For the Democrats, "this bodes well for the elec
tion in November," Free said.
The contest was part of the ASSU's "Voice your
Choice" campaign to register students on campus.
Overall, 1,295 students registered as a result of the
campaign. Approximately 80 percent of the voters
registered were undergraduates.
