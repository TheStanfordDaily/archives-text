### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
The Stanford Democrats, who have registered
1,053 voters on campus since Sept. 20, won the
ASSU's competition for most voters registered by a
student group.
"We took a multi-faceted approach to registering
voters," said junior Dave Thomas, chair of the Stan
ford Democrats. The Democrats registered voters at
Whit# Plaza, at Meyer Library during phone service
signups and during graduate check-in at Escondido
Village and Rains. They also went to house meetings
to publicize the registration drive.
"We registered the most people through tabling
in White Plaza," said sophomore Brian Free, direc
tor of community relations for the Stanford Democ
rats and head of the voter registration project. Free
added that 560 of the students they registered were
with the Democratic Party.
For the Democrats, "this bodes well for the elec
tion in November," Free said.
The contest was part of the ASSU's "Voice your
Choice" campaign to register students on campus.
Overall, 1,295 students registered as a result of the
campaign. Approximately 80 percent of the voters
registered were undergraduates.
"The results were excellent,"
said senior Alberto Tovar, director
of the ASSU project. "This is the
highest number of individuals reg
istered [at Stanford] through one
organized campaign."
Behind the Stanford Democ
rats were the Asian American Stu
dent Association and the Asian-
American fraternity Lambda Phi
Epsilon, who together registered
85 voters.
"The Asian-Pacific community
has the lowest percentage of eligi
ble voters," said sophomore Jane
Kim, chair of AASA. "We decided
that voter registration was very
important, especially for the
Asian-American community."
MEChA, a Chicano / Latino
student group, was third, with 54

voters registered.
The ASSU also sponsored its
own registration drive, which
ended up registering 103 voters.
Resident assistants from several
dorms registered additional peo
ple.
The ASSU's goal for this year
was a 100 percent registered cam
pus. Tovar said it will be impossi
ble to tell how close the ASSU
came to its goal until the Novem
ber election is over, and the voting
results can be tallied. When the re
sults are confirmed, the ASSU
plans to give a prize to the dorm
with the highest voter turnout.
The Stanford Democrats won a
$700 programming grant for win
ning the voter registration compe
tition.
"The ASSU has never spon
sored an incentive like this," said
ASSU President Bill Shen. The
Stanford Democrats saw "the in
centive and went for it."
