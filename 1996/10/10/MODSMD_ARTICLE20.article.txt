# Lane lecture series endowed

According to Bill Lane, "all
writing should involve a con
scious effort at creativity."
If writing is "dull as mud,"
Lane warned, "whether in a let
ter or on e-mail . . . who's going
to read it?"
Fifteen years ago, Lane, Class
of '42, and his wife, Jean, decided
to fund a Stanford lecture series
featuring recognized writers.
This year, the Lanes' donation of
$1 million establishes the Lane
Lecture Series as a permanent
endowment. The Lanes' gen
erosity has also extended to the
History Corner, the Institute for
International Studes, as well as
professorships in the humanities
and the Graduate School of Busi
ness.
Lane asked his long-time
friend, Daniel Boorstin — an ac
claimed American historian, a
former Librarian of Congress
and a Pulitzer Prize-winning au
thor — to be the endowment's

inaugural keynote speaker.
Lane stressed the importance
of writing across all disciplines,
including those students in the
engineering and science fields.
"As I am sure even Microsoft
will testify, once and if you get a
leadership position, you are
going to find more and more
competition to get a share of that
market," he said. "That kind of
persuasion comes down to cre
ative writing."
Most people would be happy
to boast just one of the positions
listed on the business card of
Laurence William "Bill" Lane.
To have held the title executive
publisher of Sunset Magazine,
consultant for Time Warner or
board member for Time Inc.
would satiate even the most com
petitive of Stanford students.
But the business card doesn't
stop there — there's just enough
space to mention Lane's ambas
sadorships to both Australia and
Japan.
Prior to his professional ca

reer, Lane studied journalism at
Stanford, with a particular in
terest in nature writing.
Sunset Magazine focuses on
the West and "Western living."
Lane said the expedition writ
ings of Lewis and Clark provided
initial inspiration for the envi
ronmental focus of the maga
zine.
"Even though they were not
terribly well educated, the writ
ing of Lewis and Clark was so
creative and so colorful and so
descriptive," Lane said, noting
"the excitement and curiosity,
the pure awareness that they
were looking to share."
Lane's love of the outdoors is
rooted in childhood camping trips
and his time as a mountain guide
at Sequoia and Yosemite Nation
al Parks. Lane credited a family
camping trip to Yosemite during
the Depression as the time he
began to understand the tran
scendent value of the environ
ment — an idea which propelled
his writing at Sunset Magazine.
