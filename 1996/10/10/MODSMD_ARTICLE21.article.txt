# Nobel laureates lecture on ethics of sciences
## 
### Kelly Vaughan 
Six Nobel laureates will share their views
on scientific ethics in a new Science, Tech
nology and Society class this quarter.
The class, titled "Nobel Perspectives on
Ethics in Science," is the brainchild of junior
Aly Remtulla who, in addition to lectures,
put together a course reader of materials
suggested by the laureates. Topics range
from the responsibilities of physicians to the
relationship between science and public pol
icy.
Remtulla also arranged for 10 students to
dine with each speaker after the lecture in
order to discuss the issues in a more person
al setting.
When Remtulla approached 1980 Nobel
Laureate Paul Berg about his idea for the
class, Berg said he initially "thought it was
pretty much talk." But when the idea be
came reality and Berg was asked to speak, he
accepted, partly because he had previously
spoken in undergraduate classes about the
ethics of genetic engineering.
Another motivation was his respect for
Remtulla, who assisted him in lab research
on DNA mutations and participated in a

reading course with him.
Berg said his only reservation is that he
sees "an overemphasis on the Nobel Prize"
at Stanford and that "if you run up the flag
of the Nobel Prize, everyone is supposed to
be intimidated."
He added that he feels this perception "di
minishes from others" among the Universi
ty's "amazing faculty." While Nobel Prize
winners tend to have great expertise in their
specialty, he said, they may not be able to an
swer general questions as well as other fac
ulty members.
Berg said he feels he was chosen to speak
because genetic engineering is so prevalent
in ethical discussions today. He added that
he plans to teach a little science, speak about
his own background and talk about "the real
ethical and social issues raised by the capa
bility of determining genetic makeup."
Irene Yun, a senior enrolled in the class,
said she is taking the course because she
plans to become a neuroscience professor
and"I need to learn what is ethical and what
is not in my field." She said she feels it is
valuable for undergraduates to have "con
tact with exemplars" whom "the scientific
community looks to for guidance."

Yun suggested that "if the University had
all the time and money in the world, it
should require that everybody take an ethics
class."
During his freshman year, Remtulla
heard Berg speak in his dorm and attended
one of Berg's classes. He later approached
Berg and asked to work in his laboratory.
Due to Remtulla's advanced background for
a first-year student, Berg allowed him to as
sist in the lab.
After this experience, Remtulla "realized
that undergrads rarely have the opportunity
to interact with the most accomplished fac
ulty at this university."
This "led me to begin work on a class that
would involve campus Nobel scientists
speaking about ethics to a largely under
graduate population," he said.
Remtulla approached Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education Ramon Saldivar,
who approved money for the project, and
Ellen Woods, assistant dean for undergrad
uate studies in the School of Humanities and
Sciences, who helped Remtulla design the
academic components of the class that enti
tle students to receive credit.
Woods said it was Remtulla's "sincere en

thusiasm to express his experience" that
convinced her to support his proposal. She
expressed her "admiration for him for hav
ing a dream."
About 70 students can register for "Nobel
Perspectives," although there is room for
additional students who wish to listen but
not receive credit. Classes will be taped by
Channel 51 and may be used in NASA's
ethics and science training in the future.
Lectures will be given on Wednesday af
ternoons in October and November. Lectur
ers include: Berg, who won the Nobel Prize
in chemistry; Robert McGinn, acting direc
tor of the Program in Science, Technology
and Society and faculty sponsor of the class;
Henry Taube, the 1983 Nobel laureate in
chemistry; Arthur Romberg, 1959 Nobel
laureate in medicine; Richard Taylor, the
1990 Nobel laureate in physics; Arthur
Schawlow, the 1981 Nobel laureate in
physics; and Herbert Abrams, the 1985
Nobel Peace Prize winner.
The class is given in memory of Robert
Hofstadter, who taught freshman physics at
the University, and Linus Pauling, an anti
nuclear activist. Both were Nobel laureates
and Stanford faculty members.
