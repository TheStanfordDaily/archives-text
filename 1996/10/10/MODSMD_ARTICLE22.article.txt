## Kickers fired up for Santa Clara tourney 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Tomorrow night at 6 p.m. the Stanford
women's soccer team will play its biggest
game of the year so far against defending
national champion and current No. 1
Notre Dame.
"This is huge, but there's no nervous
ness," said sophomore midfielder Christy
Stoffel. "I'm excited to play, because we
have nothing to lose, and we can do it.
"We've got a chance to beat the No. 1
team, and I think we're capable of doing
it."
The match is part of the Santa Clara
Nike Classic and will therefore take place
at Santa Clara. Four teams are partici
pating in the tourney: the Fighting Irish,
No. 8 Santa Clara, No. 20 Stanford and
Colorado College.
Stanford will face off against the
Tigers on Sunday at noon, but right now
all eyes are on the Irish.
While the Cardinal (7-4) has shown
flashes of brilliance this season and
boasts excellent talent, the team is 0-4
against top-20 opponents.
On the other hand, Notre Dame (12-0)
has been perfect so far this season. The
Irish are coming off a huge weekend in
which they beat No. 22 Duke and handed
previously unbeaten North Carolina its
first loss 2-1. Both Duke and then-No. 1
UNC recorded victories over Stanford
earlier this season.
In addition to its unblemished record
this year, Notre Dame also owns a nation
best 23-game winning streak, including
13 in a row on the road.

So with all indicators pointing to an
easy Notre Dame victory, is there any rea
son to believe the Cardinal is capable of
pulling off the biggest upset of the year?
"We're definitely capable of beating
anyone who comes up against us, whether
it's Notre Dame or Colorado College,"
said senior forward Erin Martin.
"We need to put together a good 90
minutes of soccer," said the star forward.
"We've played well for 15- or 30-minute
spurts, but we need a whole game effort
where we're really connecting."

contain Notre Dame freshman Jenny
Streiffer. The midfielder-turned-forward
leads her team in goals (11) and points
(35). Her 13 assists this year are second in
the nation behind teammate junior Holly
Manthei, who has 15.
Streiffer scored both goals in the win
over Carolina and demonstrated that she
is a versatile player scoring with both her
head and left foot. But Cardinal keeper
Erin Bryla said she isn't overly concerned
with Streiffer.
"We've just got to go out and do the
things we can," the sophomore said. "Our
defense has come a long way since the be
ginning of the season, and I think we can
handle Notre Dame."
It is imperative for the Cardinal to get
off to a solid start tomorrow. Notre Dame
is an explosive team, and Stanford could
find itself down two or three goals early if
it doesn't come out of the gates with in
tensity.
"I think our preparation will be key,"
said sophomore midfielder Charmaine
Leßlanc, the team's leading scorer with
four goals and three assists.
"Physically, I think we'll be fine,"
Leßlanc said. "Psychologically, I think
we need to come out with confidence. It's
all about attitude, and we just need to
come out strong in the first 10 minutes
and kick some butt."
In addition to needing a strong start,
Stanford must finish better than it has
lately. In the last few games, the Cardinal
has had plenty of opportunities but few
goals to show for its efforts.
"I've never hit the post so many times
in a season," said Martin, who has put 46
balls in the back of the net in her illustri
ous four-year career. This year she has
put 31 balls on cage, but only three have
made it into the netting.
"We need to keep making the opportu
nities and the goals will come," she said.
Last year, the Cardinal did not make
enough opportunities or goals against the
Irish, falling 2-0 in South Bend. Stanford
beat Notre Dame in its two previous at
tempts (1992, 1993), however, and leads
the all-time series 2-1.
Sunday's match against Colorado Col
lege will be the teams' sixth meeting. Col
orado College leads the series 3-2, but
Stanford has won the last two matches
(1993, 1994) easily.
