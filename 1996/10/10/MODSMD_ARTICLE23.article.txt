# Sharpley leads on, off court

She doesn't get the recognition that
some of her teammates do, and some
may be surprised that the only first
team Ail-American on the Stanford
women's volleyball roster is not
Kristin Folkl.
Cardinal junior setter Lisa Sharp
ley has played in the shadows of great
players like Folkl and last season's na
tional player of the year Gary Wendell,
but she doesn't really mind.
"Setter is not a glory position,"
Sharpley said. "I have always been
comfortable with it, and it is all the

better for me to have great players to
set to. The players on the team give me
a lot of credit, so that's nice."
Maybe the press and the fans have
not given her the publicity that her
outstanding play has merited, but
Sharpley has earned her share of acco
lades. As a freshman, she joined team
mate Folkl on the Pacific-10 Confer
ence All-Freshman team and recorded
her best statistical game of the year in
the NCAA Championship against Pac
-10 rival UCLA, helping the team to the
1994 title.
In her sophomore season, Sharpley
continued on the road to the top, earn
ing first-team Pac-10, All-District and

All-America honors. Sharpley led the
squad in assists while splitting the set
ting duties with Wendell. But Sharp
ley is not merely a great setter, for she
also ranked second in kills and digs for
last season's Final Four team.
"She has progressed a great deal,"
said coach Don Shaw. "She is a great
all-around player."
This season, Sharpley took full re
sponsibility of the setting duties, and
she has responded. With Sharpley at
the helm, the Cardinal has moved
into the top ranks in hitting percent
age, and she has already recorded 452
