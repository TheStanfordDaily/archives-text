# Sharpley leads on, off court

She doesn't get the recognition that
some of her teammates do, and some
may be surprised that the only first
team Ail-American on the Stanford
women's volleyball roster is not
Kristin Folkl.
Cardinal junior setter Lisa Sharp
ley has played in the shadows of great
players like Folkl and last season's na
tional player of the year Gary Wendell,
but she doesn't really mind.
"Setter is not a glory position,"
Sharpley said. "I have always been
comfortable with it, and it is all the

better for me to have great players to
set to. The players on the team give me
a lot of credit, so that's nice."
Maybe the press and the fans have
not given her the publicity that her
outstanding play has merited, but
Sharpley has earned her share of acco
lades. As a freshman, she joined team
mate Folkl on the Pacific-10 Confer
ence All-Freshman team and recorded
her best statistical game of the year in
the NCAA Championship against Pac
-10 rival UCLA, helping the team to the
1994 title.
In her sophomore season, Sharpley
continued on the road to the top, earn
ing first-team Pac-10, All-District and

All-America honors. Sharpley led the
squad in assists while splitting the set
ting duties with Wendell. But Sharp
ley is not merely a great setter, for she
also ranked second in kills and digs for
last season's Final Four team.
"She has progressed a great deal,"
said coach Don Shaw. "She is a great
all-around player."
This season, Sharpley took full re
sponsibility of the setting duties, and
she has responded. With Sharpley at
the helm, the Cardinal has moved
into the top ranks in hitting percent
age, and she has already recorded 452

national title.
assists during the 1996 cam
paign.
One may wonder why a 6-foot
volleyball player with excellent
jumping ability is not racking up
kills as an outside hitter, but
from a young age, Sharpley chose
otherwise.
"She has been setting for quite
a while," Shaw said. "She decided
early on in her volleyball career
that she wanted to set, and her
size has been a great advantage."
Sharpley's arrival on the Farm
resulted from a classic combina

tion of rich volleyball and acade
mic tradition. As the second-most
highly touted recruit in the coun
try behind Folkl, Sharpley had
her options, but decided to make
her mark as a collegiate in a Car
dinal uniform.
"When it came down to it, I
went with my gut feeling,"
Sharpley said. "I really liked the
girls on the team, and I felt really
comfortable. I liked the fact that
with everyone you talk to here
you are pretty much guaranteed
of having a semi-intelligent con
versation. Everyone here has
something special about them."
Sharpley's tight-knit family
has played a major role in her life,
and since they reside in nearby

Los Altos, they continue to have a
significant influence on her, re
siding court side at most Cardinal
home matches.
Since all four of Sharpley's
grandparents served as Baptist
missionaries, she has also en
joyed a rich cultural heritage and
spiritual foundation.
"Religion is definitely impor
tant to me; I am a Christian,"
Sharpley said. "It has been a
struggle for me here though, but I
guess it is all a part of the growing
experience."
The Stanford volleyball squad
has served as Sharpley's second
family, giving her both support
and a little ribbing. Since she
lives with junior teammate Deb

bie Lambert and in the same
dorm with Folkl and junior Bar
bara Ifejika, she probably could
not get away from them if she
tried.
"They are really like my sec
ond family," Sharpley said. "We
fight like sisters, but we also have
great moments. We have gone
though a lot of hard times and a
lot of good times together."
"She's one of the genuinely
nicest people I know," Folkl said.
"I'm so comfortable with her off
the court that it helps when we're
on the court."
As the so-called "quarterback"
of the team, Sharpley has run the
potent Cardinal offense with re
markable efficiency and has con

stantly kept Stanford opponents
off balance.
The setter has the responsibili
ty of calling the plays and catch
ing the numerous audibles that
the hitters call. Sharpley must de
cide who to give the ball to based
on the alignment of the blockers,
which teammate has the hot hand
and how this particular play could
set up the following one. It's quite
a lot to think about in the matter
of a couple seconds.
But Sharpley carries with her
a confident determination that
propels her to success. And as a
co-captain on this national cham
pionship-caliber squad, the
coaching staff has given her the
responsibility of transferring

that attitude to her teammates,
and particularly to the under
classmen.
"There is a little bit of that
cocky attitude that you need to
have in order to be successful,"
Shaw said. "I like her attitude on
the court."
As Sharpley and the rest of the
talented Cardinal squad look for
ward to contending for their sec
ond NCAA crown in three years,
one thing that will probably re
main the same is her attitude.
"Last year Eileen Murfee and I
had this saying," Sharpley said.
"Before each match, we would
say to each other, 'I wonder what
it feels like to think you are going
to lose.' "
