### Caroline Lin 
Any coach would love to be in Frank
Brennan's shoes right now. As the head
coach for the 1996 NCAA runner-up Stan
ford women's tennis team, Brennan once
again leads a solid nucleus of returning
players. However, he has added a few more
weapons to his already potent arsenal, set
ting the stage for an exciting season.
The 1996-97 campaign will be a balanc
ing act for the championship-caliber
squad. Complementing the experience of
All-Americans Katie Schlukebir, Ania
Bleszynski, Sandra De Silva and Julie

Scott will be the raw talent of a highly tout
ed freshman class, including Lilia Oster
loh, Anne Kremer, Teryn Ashley and Jen
Heiser.
The Cardinal women displayed their
depth and talent last Friday in an exhibi
tion match with Asia University of Japan,
which is on tour in the United States for
the fall season. The women dominated the
competition, winning six of seven singles
matches and two of three doubles matches.
Despite his squad's dominance, Bren
nan saluted Stanford's opponents.
"They're probably better than 16 of our
opponents (this year)," Brennan said.

Asia defeated Pacific 10 Conference ri
vals California and USC prior to its arrival
at Stanford.
Playing without senior Schlukebir in
singles, one of the top seeds, the Cardinal
women were still able to string together
impressive victories against the talented
Japanese players. Though the matches
were unseeded, the competing players
were matched up by coaches according to a
rough lineup of ability.
The freshmen especially came out
strong in their first college matches. Oster-
loh handily defeated her opponent
6-1, 6-2 in her Stanford career
opening match. Kremer and Ashley
followed suit with identical winning
scores of 6-1,6-1.
The lone singles loss for the Car
dinal came in a tight three-set
match as Heiser fell 6-7,6-3, 7-6.
The Cardinal returners matched
the freshman efforts with three vic
tories of their own. Junior Bleszyn
ski, coming off of an impressive
1995-96 season in which she
reached the semifinals of the NCAA
Championships singles tourna
ment, put together a 7-5, 6-4 win.
Senior De Silva, who reached the
quarterfinals in the NCAA singles

tournament last season, defeated
her opponent 6-4, 6-1. Junior Julie
Scott, a strong singles and doubles
player, displayed her versatility on
the courts, winning 6-2,6-3.
In doubles competition, the
Stanford women won two out of
three pro-set matches. Scott and
Schlukebir won 8-2, while fresh
men Kremer and Osterloh
squeaked by their opponents 8-7.
Junior Heidi Stalla and Ashley
combined talents but lost to a tough
Japanese duo 8-3.
Overall, Schlukebir commended
the experience of playing a strong
international team.
"They were super-nice people,"
she said. "From an observer's point
of view, people had fun, and it was a
great way to start the year — a good
strong match with a decent, com
petitive team."
