Any coach would love to be in Frank
Brennan's shoes right now. As the head
coach for the 1996 NCAA runner-up Stan
ford women's tennis team, Brennan once
again leads a solid nucleus of returning
players. However, he has added a few more
weapons to his already potent arsenal, set
ting the stage for an exciting season.
The 1996-97 campaign will be a balanc
ing act for the championship-caliber
squad. Complementing the experience of
All-Americans Katie Schlukebir, Ania
Bleszynski, Sandra De Silva and Julie

Scott will be the raw talent of a highly tout
ed freshman class, including Lilia Oster
loh, Anne Kremer, Teryn Ashley and Jen
Heiser.
The Cardinal women displayed their
depth and talent last Friday in an exhibi
tion match with Asia University of Japan,
which is on tour in the United States for
the fall season. The women dominated the
competition, winning six of seven singles
matches and two of three doubles matches.
Despite his squad's dominance, Bren
nan saluted Stanford's opponents.
"They're probably better than 16 of our
opponents (this year)," Brennan said.

Asia defeated Pacific 10 Conference ri
vals California and USC prior to its arrival
at Stanford.
Playing without senior Schlukebir in
singles, one of the top seeds, the Cardinal
women were still able to string together
impressive victories against the talented
Japanese players. Though the matches
were unseeded, the competing players
were matched up by coaches according to a
rough lineup of ability.
The freshmen especially came out
strong in their first college matches. Oster-
