# Men's soccer to confront the Husky challenge, Oregon State
## 
### John Sullivan 
Men's soccer matches up
against two of college soccer's
premier teams this weekend. The
Cardinal (4-2-3, 0-0-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) will
meet the Oregon State Beavers
tomorrow at Maloney Field at 4
p.m. and the second-ranked
Washington Huskies at home on
Sunday at 2 p.m.
Coming off a disappointing tie
to Sacramento State last Sunday,
Stanford is looking to use this
weekend to redeem itself and
exact revenge on two of last sea
son's foes.
"We've kept our fate in our
own hands with a tie (against
Sacramento State), but it's cru
cial that we play some of our best
soccer this weekend," said senior
forward Erik Morrison. "Both
games are must-win situations."
Oregon State handed the Car
dinal its worst defeat of last sea
son, a 5-0 shutout, while Wash
ington posted a 3-1 victory over
Stanford last year and holds a 4-2
edge over the Cardinal in the
1990s
Though coach Bobby Clark in
sists that the Cardinal will re
main within its usual game plan
for both matchups, the physical
and direct play of Oregon State
will require Stanford to make
some adjustments.
Oregon State relies on a long
ball strategy, which puts extra
pressure on the opponent s de

fense. The Cardinal defense will
have to play mistake-free soccer
to give the team a good chance
against the Beavers.
Stanford will look to capitalize

'We know we're capa
ble of beating any
team in the country,
but at the same time
we know that any
team in the country
could beat us.'
— Erik Morrison

on the Beavers' tendency to send
players frequently upfield by
using a high-pressure defense
with quick and frequent counter
attacks. The Cardinal will also
look to put pressure on Oregon
State's defense, which has not
been highly proficient.
Though Clark said no special
mark-ups will be used against the
Beavers, the Cardinal will have
to watch out for senior forward
Dominick Conti, their third-lead
ing scorer. Described by Stan
ford's Morrison as "big, strong,
good in the air and an excellent
shot," Conti is a player to watch
and guard tightly.
Other players to watch are
Oregon State's sophomore goal

keeper, Colin McMillen, who has
given up just five goals in five
starts for a 1.03 goals against av
erage, and junior Josh Dodson,
who is among the conference
leaders in scoring with seven
goals.
Comingoff adisappointing4-2
overtime loss to the Washington
Huskies, the Beavers look to send
a message to the Cardinal.
Though Oregon State has a mod
est 6-5 (0-1 MPSF) record, its
close play with Washington indi
cates that it can compete with the
best.
Though Stanford players and
coaches want to take one game at
a time, the Huskies are clearly on
their minds. Washington has
won nine consecutive contests
since its 1-0 opening season loss
to Seattle University. The
Huskies sport a 5-0 record when
scoring first and have outscored
opponents 15-2 in the second
half.
"We have to play hard (against
Washington) and cannot have
any letdowns," Morrison said.
"We've played close to them the
last few years.
"We know we're capable of
beating any team in the country,
but at the same time we know
that any team in the country
could beat us," he said.
The Huskies' style utilizes an
efficient short game, as opposed
to the direct, long-ball approach
of the Beavers. The Cardinal's
high-pressure defense and quick

counterattack offense should be
effective, though Washington is a
highly skilled team not known
for making many mistakes. The
Huskies will probably give noth
ing away easily, forcing the Car
dinal to create its own opportuni
ties.
Husky players to watch are

freshman forward Hees Bet
tinger, who leads the team in
goals with eight and points with
17, and junior striker James
Boyce, who leads the team with
six assists.
"I haven't put any pressure on
the players, nor have I put any
pressure on myself," Clark said.

"We've put a lot of work into this
season and want to use these
games to see how well we can ex
ecute the things we've been
working on this season against
the best teams in the country.
"If the favorites always won,
the bookkeepers would be out of
business."
