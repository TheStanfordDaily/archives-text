# Good things come in threes for triathlete Josh Dapice
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Editorial staff 
What Stanford junior can cover
more than 32 miles in under two
hours without the aid of any mo
torized vehicle?
Triathlete Josh Dapice — fast
runner, talented cyclist and star
swimmer all wrapped up into one
tremendous athlete.
Dapice is the man. He swims 1.5
kilometers (about 1 mile) in 19
minutes, bikes 40 kilometers
(about 25 miles) in under an hour
and runs 10 kilometers (about 6.2
miles) in less than 35 minutes.
These impressive times have led
him to both national and world ti
tles and encouraged him to keep
pursuing his career as a triathlete.
"I'd like to do the World Cup se
ries when I graduate," Dapice said,
which would consist of him com
peting in 12 races per year all
around the world as a professional.
This tour also determines who
qualifies for the Olympic teams.
"My goal is to get to the Olympic
trials in May 2000," Dapice said.
At the rate he is going, Dapice
is making himself a prime candi
date for a slot in that competition.
Since he qualified for the Junior
National Team at the end of his
senior year at Phillips Exeter
Academy, Dapice was ranked No.
2 in the country in his age group
and placed 18th in the 1995 World
Junior Championships in Cancun
(a considerable improvement
from his already impressive 26th

place at the same competition the
year before in New Zealand).
As a 20-year-old, Dapice is no
longer eligible for Junior (age 19
and under) competitions. Now,
this Concord, Mass., native com
petes as an amateur athlete spon
sored by DeGeorge, a racing team
on the East Coast, which supports
his travels to competitions around
the world.
Recently, Dapice brought home
a fifth-place showing in an ama
teur world championship in Japan.
Closer to his Stanford home, he
also just placed third overall in the
Santa Cruz triathlon, which he ran
in 1 hour, 49 minutes.
Other accomplishments under
his belt include a 12th-place finish
in the 1996 World Amateur Cham
pionship in Cleveland and coming
in fourth place at the Collegiate
National Championship.
When not gaining national ti
tles this past summer, Dapice
spent his time with some friends
from Harvard University with
whom he started a company called
Synergy Foods. With a trademark
and the finished product, Synergy
Bar (which includes the ingredi
ents of the Massachusetts boys' fa
vorite energy bar as well as their
own secret ingredient), the compa
ny is underway.
"We won't have a national
launch anytime soon," Dapice said
with a laugh. "We still have to find
a bakery and suppliers before we
can market it."
Though he definitely wants to

pursue triathlons in the future,
Dapice said he does not expect to
support himself solely as a triath
lete after graduation. Dapice is an
economics major but does not plan
to be an economist.
"My dad is the economist," said
Dapice, whose father works at
Harvard's Institute for Interna
tional Development.
Speaking of family, Dapice isn't
the only athletically inclined off
spring of his parents. His younger
brother Robbie, now a freshman at
Dartmouth University, is a cyclist
who is currently reigning as the
national champion in junior cy
cling.
Before Dapice began devoting
his time to triathlon training, he
was a swimmer. He swam on a
swim team in his hometown with
some of the current members of
Stanford's men's swim team, in
cluding fifth-year senior Ray
Carey.
"I could keep up with them until
it came time to race, and then I'd
get run over," Dapice said. "I was
never as fast as them."
"I have so much respect for the
athletes here (at Stanford),"
Dapice said. "A swimmer here has
most likely been swimming since
they were 8 years old and is so spe
cialized."
While at Exeter, Dapice also
swam on a team, in addition to
being the coxswain on Exeter's
crew team, which competed in
England.
As a freshman at Stanford,

Dapice tried out for but did not
make the cross country team. He
thought about participating in
crew here also, but, once he started
juggling classes, triathlon training

and a social life (Dapice is current
ly pledge marshal for his fraterni
ty, Sigma Nu), he realized he just
didn't have the time.
Dapice's year-round training

schedule (with the exception of the
off-season — December and Janu
ary) could make any athlete cringe.


Rebecca Roberts — Daily
Whether he is in a pool, riding a bike or running on foot, junior triathlete Josh Dapice can display his su
perior athletic abilities.
With just one day off, Dapice's
week consists of swimming, bik
ing and running practices rang
ing from a couple of hours to 6 1/2
hours per day.
Dapice's coach, Tim Sheeper,
who also coaches a triathlon and
swim team in Menlo Park, always
goes along with Dapice on his
runs and bike rides.
Dapice usually exercises in
the same order the events run
in triathlon competition —
swimming, biking and then
running.

"I'm the most comfortable
with swimming because of my
background," said Dapice, who
thinks that the best triathletes
tend to come from a swimming
background. "Cycling is my weak
point."
"With riding, I'm just trying
to stay efficient. And when I
run, I'm just trying to go as fast
as I can."
In giving advice to aspiring
triathletes, Dapice said, "Don't
be scared of a triathlon, anyone
can do one.
"Make sure you're comfort
able in the water when there's a
lot of people around you, and
practice running immediately
after you cycle."
