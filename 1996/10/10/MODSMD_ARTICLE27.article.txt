# Cardinal equestrian rearing to go
## 
### Erin M. Reilly 
The Stanford equestrian team jump-starts
its season on Saturday at Fresno State, and will
host fall shows at the Red Barn Oct. 27 and Nov.
10.
After qualifying for nationals last year, the
Cardinal anticipates another strong showing in
1996-97, since the majority of the team is re
turning riders.
Last year's success, combined with 10 new
riders, could also mean more outside support for
the squad. Team president Amanda Hoche said
many Stanford students are unaware that Stan
ford has both an equestrian center, the Red
Barn, and a competitive equestrian team. She
added that many people are curious about the
skills involved and how a competition is judged.
Riders compete within their skill level
(novice, intermediate and open advanced) and
within their team discipline, Western or Eng
lish. Each class is judged exclusively on the rid
ers' ability to pilot horses they have never been
on before. Rider style and effectiveness is called
"equitation."
Although considered one team, Western and
English riders use different equipment and
master distinctly different skills. Jumping
fences highlight the English competition while
roping is an advanced Western skill.
"Since points accumulated by open advanced
riders are worth the same as those earned by be
ginners, there is actually more incentive for
novice riders," said Hoche, who is a junior. "In
the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association
everyone is equal."
"It is really a challenge to get on a strange
horse and, without warmup, adjust in front of a
lot of people and a judge who is deciding how
well you ride," said sophomore Kathleen
Gilbert.
Competitors arbitrarily draw mounts provid
ed by the host university. While open English

riders jump a course of fences, beginners are
judged without jumps at the walk, trot and can
ter.
Western team coach Karine Boudouin is un
able to accompany her team this weekend but
still holds high expectations for her returning
riders.
In the long term, "Many of them should

'I am pretty excited about the
team. A lot of my friends are
on it, and I am here to have a
good time.'

'point out' (move up a division) by year end and
qualify for the regional and national competi
tions," Boudouin said.
"This is a team with tremendous potential,"
said new coach Barbara Close. 'The [English!
team is strong and the riders are all at the upper
end of their divisions in terms of skill, but they
don't have much in terms of experience yet."
Hoche is also optimistic. Stanford was the
only West Region team selected to compete at
nationals last season. Hoche attributed the suc
cess due to team unity.
"Riding is such an individual sport. Last year
was the first year we really put team success
over individual success, and we qualified for na
tionals," Hoche said.
The IHSA is a national governing body for
collegiate equestrian sports and is divided into
zones and regions. Stanford competes in zone 8,
which was recently split into three regions.
Stanford is also expected to be elected region
al president college with Close elected regional
president at the IHSA regional elections this

weekend. Close and Stanford would be adminis
tratively responsible for the region as well as
hosting the spring regional finals.
Despite success in recent years, the coed
team faces many challenges; namely, a scarcity
of money, time and resources.
"I intend to focus a lot on mental training be
cause the physical training is limited," Close
said.
The team's tight budget covers veterinary
fees, feed, equipment, training and farrier ser
vices for Mojo, Brutus, Sunny, Joey and Splash
— the team horses — as well as travel expenses
for the team members. Both Close, a veteran
trainer and current MBA student, and
Boudouin, a part-time rider and full-time exec
utive, are volunteers. y
Managing the horses is an additional chal
lenge. Sophomore Karen Hoffman shares the
title of horse manager with Gijjbert. They are re
sponsible for feeding the hoses, treating the
horses' injuries, scheduling Hides and organiz
ing the tack room.
"It is a lot more work than it seems," Gilbert
said.
Three horses are currently lame, which has
limited the team's practice time. Hoffman has
only had one lesson so far. Jii
"I'm not too nervous about Fresno, because
it's really the luck of the draw, " Hoffman said.
"But I am pretty excited about the team. A lot of
my friends are on it and I am hefe t° have a good
time."
Teams are completely student-run under
IHSA rules, so the coach's sole responsibility is
training.
Riders to watch for in the coming year are
sophomores Ann Carney and Vanessa Bartsch
(both have previous English and Western riding
experience) as well as Mark Gunderson on the
Western team. Also watch "for English ruler
Hoche, who has competed oi). the national-level
circuit in Florida.
