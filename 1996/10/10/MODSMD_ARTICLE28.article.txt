Presenting arguments in favor of Proposi
tion 209, San Francisco attorney Robert Corry
and author David Horowitz spoke to a crowd of
about 30 students last night in Building 160 at
a forum sponsored by the Stanford College He
publicans.
Prop. 209 is a piece of legislation aimed at
ending all discrimination and preferential
treatment based on race, ethnicity, sex or na
tional origin in the public sector, including af
firmative action programs.
Corry, a graduate of the Stanford Law
School, outlined the common arguments relat
ing to racial issues and described how Prop. 209
actually "strikes down discrimination and pref
erences."
It is a common misbelief that there are no
quotas when it comes to hiring practices in the
public sector, Corry said. He believes quotas
"exist and are a problem" and furthermore that
they prove to be costly for the government.
Corry also heavily criticized the belief that
over diversification is "good for America." In
his speech, he called for "intellectual diversity

in universities" rather than diversity based on
race alone. He said he believes Prop. 209 does
not "ban diversity;" rather, it ends the "racial
paternalism and racism" which he contends are
the results of affirmative action programs ex
isting today.
Additionally, Corry refuted the argument
that there is racial underrepresentation in gov
ernment jobs, pointing to the fact that recent
studies have shown "Asian Americans, African
Americans and women are all overrepresented
in civil service jobs."
Corry is no stranger to debates over civil
rights issues. He served as the spokesman for
the plaintiffs who successfully sued the Univer
sity in 1994 over the then-existing speech code,
which prohibited students from making in
flammatory statements based on race, sex,
handicap or sexual orientation.
According to Corry, Prop. 209 would ensure
that the "best qualified" were hired, regardless
of race or gender.
In one of his most passionate arguments,
Corry responded to a question pertaining to
the fact that some affirmative action programs
make up for "past abuses and wrongs." He said

these programs are "un-American" and that
Prop. 209 will put an end to them because "our
generation is innocent of the sins of the past."
Horowitz, in raising the notion that affirma
tive action programs are "totally unnecessary,"
said he believes in some instances they can ac
tually hurt minority groups. He described that
in the University of California school system,
affirmative action programs are "designed to
keep the Asian population at [UC-Berkeley]
down."
After the speakers expressed their support
for Prop. 209, the floor was opened for audience
members to ask questions. In response to a
question regarding the way in which Prop. 209
is worded, Corry reinforced the fact that the
measure is "defined by existing case law" and is
"worded in common terms."
Opposition to Prop. 209 was obvious in the
lobby of Building 160. A table was set up before
the forum by an opposition group, which hand
ed out literature to passers-by.
According to senior Vanessa Frank, a mem
ber of the unnamed group, "Affirmative action
should be reassessed. Eliminating it is not a so
lution at all."
