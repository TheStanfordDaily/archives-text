Pulitzer-Prize winning historian and
former Librarian of Congress Daniel J.
Boorstin discussed the "spectacular risks of
literature" last night in a talk which exam
ined the role publishers, writers and readers
play in the web of literature.
In the talk at Kresge Auditorium,
Boorstin encouraged the development of
the imagination and the ability to think and
communicate creatively.
Calling publishers the "unsung heroes of
literature without whom writers would go
unnoticed," Boorstin attributed the plea
sure of reading a favorite book to the
"courage and enterprise" of publishers.
"Publishers are the least celebrated force
in literature," Boorstin said.
Boorstin mentioned literary greats Ezra
Pound, T.S. Eliot and James Joyce as writ
ers who were aided by the risks publishers
took in producing their work.
Admitting that there would be no pub
lishers without writers, though, Boorstin
went on to discuss the risks authors took in
first experimenting with fiction, especially
in the form of the novel.
"With the novel, authors took their
chances with new material and new forms.
It was not easy for authors to plunge into
the sea of fictional writing,'' Boorstin said.

The third portion of Boorstin'3 talk fo
cused on the reader's role in literature.
Readers "take risks too, by committing
time and money to works we don't know,"
Boorstin said. "It is our duty and our privi
lege as readers not to shun the risks of liter
ature but to embrace them."
Boorstin, who was educated at Harvard
and Oxford Universities and Yale Universi
ty's law school, has taught at many schools,
including, for the last 25 years, the Univer
sity of Chicago.
In 1969, Boorstin was appointed director
of the Smithsonian Institution's National
Museum of American History. He was sub
sequently appointed Librarian of Congress
in 1975, a position he held for 12 years.
Boorstin has received numerous awards
for his work, including the National Book
Award for Lifetime Contribution to Ameri
can Letters.
He has received such prizes as the Ban
croft and the Parkman, given to him for the
first two volumes of his trilogy, "The Amer
icans." The final volume of his work, "The
Democratic Experience," won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1974.
Boorstin's other books include "The Dis
coverers," "The Creators" and "Cleopatra's
Nose: Essays on the Unexpected."
