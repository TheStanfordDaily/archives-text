# Nobel Prize-winning work on helium-3

Physics Prof. Douglas OsherofT, working in
coi\junction with his thesis advisers at Cornell
University in the 19705, discovered the super
fluidity of helium-3 — work which earned him a
share in this year's Nobel Prize for physics.
Superfluidity occurs when a sample of liquid
helium-3 is cooled almost to absolute zero, the
temperature at which all possible energy is re
moved from a system.
OsherofF found that at two-thousandths of a
degree above absolute zero, -273.15 degrees
Celsius, the atoms in the helium lost their ran
domness and moved in a perfectly coordinated
manner.
Such a change in the behavior of the atoms is
significantly different from the change atoms

experience in other phase transitions — such as
from gas to liquid or from liquid to solid.
The atoms themselves don't change, Os
heroff explained. Instead, they pair up.
"The lifetime of one of these pairs can be a
few billionths of a second," he said. "Then those
atoms will form pairs with other atoms. It's a
very funny kind of a dance where everyone's
cutting in on everyone else's partner."
Because randomness has been eliminated
from the system, there is no friction within the
liquid. Without friction, liquid helium-3 can
flow through very small holes, climb up the
walls of a container and exhibit other effects
that can't be explained with classical physics.
Osheroff spent his first year at Cornell de
veloping a compressional cooling technique.
He started by building his own dilution refrig
erator.

After cooling the helium to within a few
thousandths of a degree of absolute zero, the re
searchers looked for a phase transition to a kind
of magnetic order in frozen helium-3. To find
the transition, they studied the pressure within
the sample as a function of the time during
which the volume was slowly increased and re
duced.
Osheroff noticed small extra steps in the
pressure vs. volume curve. Rather than pass
the deviations off"as an instrumental error, the
researchers recognized them as the transition
to the superfluid state.
Superfluid helium-3 is an unusually pure liq
uid, OsherofT said. Because of that characteris
tic, "it serves as a model system for under
standing bits and pieces of complex physics that
would be difficult to study and understand ac
curately with less clean systems."
