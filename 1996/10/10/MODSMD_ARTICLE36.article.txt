# Head of the Class?
## The 						star of 'With Honors' seemed like the ideal Harvard roommate, but in a surprising interview, Moira Kelly reveals what she really thinks of college kids 
### Elizabeth Logan 
Location: Old St. Mary's Church in the middle of the bustle and
tourism of Chinatown. Time: around noon on a weekday.
I was:
a) Going to Muss.
b) Listening to an organ concert.
c) Talking with actress Moira Kelly ("Chaplin," "The Cutting Edge,'
"With Honors") about her new film "Entertaining Angels: The Doroth)
Day Story."
The correct response is c, as bizarre as that may seem.
During our interview, Kelly, who always acts perky and energetic in
her movies, seemed withdrawn and awkwardly quiet in person. Shi
rarely made eye contact and must have yawned a half dozen times.
In all fairness, she was probably exhausted from the grueling pub
licity junket. Then, halfway through the interview she sprang to life
exploding into a mantra of her beliefs. They poured out in a seeming

"We have a young generation
that has grown up having taken
care of themselves, and that
has created a very confused
and I think bitter generation. We
have our priorities all messed
up, not just in this country, but in
the world."

ly endless dissertation:
"I don't believe in technology.
"/ don't believe in muting money on items rather than using it to help
people who ore down and out.
"I don't believe in having more than yon need.
"I don't believe in the self-centered attitude of people today.
"I don't believe in societies looking out for No. I.
"I don't believe in this new welfare bi11....
"I don't believe in a society looking on a president to take on the re
sponsibilities of the country. ..
Feisty and fearless replaced withdrawn and distant. Yet many actors
today say one thing and practice the other extreme. But a hypocrite
she's not; Kelly practices what she preaches.
Kcllv currently lives in a one-bed room apartment in New York (lity.
She does not own a television and admits to having few friends in the
Hollywood scene — a scene that she detests. She sees acting as a step
ping stone to her true calling, music. She wants to open a children's
theater in Ireland to share her love of music. Kelly, who hails from a
musical family, plays the violin, piano, drums and flute.
Born and raised in Long Island, N.Y., Kelly is the third oldest of six
children. Her parents are Irish immigrants. Her mother is a nurse, and
her father a musician, but according to Kelly, at times he worked two
other jobs to make ends meet.
Kelly's mother did not work when Kelly and her siblings were
young. 1 ler parents believed that getting love and guidance from a full
time parent was more important than material comforts. Kelly praised
her parents' decision.

of themselves... and that has treat
ed a very confused, and I think bit
ter, generation," said Kelly. "We
have our priorities all messed up,
not just in this country, but in the
world. . . . Money and material
items take precedence over kind
ness and human caring."
With all her energy, she seemed
to fit in perfectly with many of our
impassioned speakers at White
Plaza. So 1 asked her about her own
college experience. At first, she was
reluctant to answer.
Kelly, who is only 28, said college
was so long ago that she couldn't
speak of it. Minutes later she soft
ened and returned to my question,
perhaps regretting her initial refusal.
Kelly implied that her years at
Marymount College in New York
were not the best of her life. Accord

ing to Kelly, she enjoyed her theater
and writing classes, the city and her
friends but did not like being in
classrooms.
Kelly sounded frustrated with the
"financially driven" college "kids" of
today, especially those who are pre
med or pre-law students only be
cause "it's good money."
She misses "the times when peo
ple wanted to be a lawyer because
they wanted to help or a doctor be
cause they wanted to cure.... You
do what you do because you love to
do it, not because you make money
and not to make money."
Kelly loves to act, but says she
never envisioned herself doing what
she does.
Kelly offered "college kids" a bit
of advice because she knows we
"love having something to have a
voice about." She believes Holly
wood is guilty of "gluttony," spend
ing as much as $170 million on a
film "that benefits no one but the

people who put it out."
She also believes Hollywood has
found a safe place in this supply and
demand market, "regurgitating the
same stuff over and over again."
Kelly suggested that students refuse
to pay the outrageous ticket prices to
force change. Her repetitive use of
the word "masses" reminded me of
CIV. Her publicist must have a per
manent migraine.
After her intriguing sermon on
greediness, Hollywood and the not
so good old days of college, we re
turned to the film that brought us to
Old St. Mary's, "Entertaining An
gels: The Dorothy Day Story." Exec
utive producer Ellwood Kieser, pre
sent at the interview as well, is also
— shock of all shocks — the Rev.
Kieser, a practicing Pan list priest.
For the non-Catholics out there, like
me, the Paulists are an American
order dedicated to spreading the
love of Christ to non-Cat holies.
Kieser's film fulfills his mission,

spanning over 20 years of the life of
Day, the co-founder of the Catholic
Worker's movement. The movie de
picts her ministry with the poor, her
rocky relationships with men, in
cluding playwright Eugene O'Neill,
and her struggle to find the abun
dance of life.
Originally, Kieser deemed Kelly
too young for the part. According
to Kieser, he eventually reconsid
ered after looking at the 30 or 40
biggest names in Hollywood.
Kieser offered the role to a few of
them, though he gladly admits they
turned him down. 1 le savs the Lord
saved him from his own mistakes.
After one of those infamous Hol
lywood power lunches, Kieser hired
Kelly. According to Kieser, he based
his decision on the fact that she pov
sessed a struggling spiritual quality
similar to that of Day's.
True to Kelly's call for thrifty
movies, the film, also starring Mar
tin Sheen, cost a mere $4.3 million.

Hundreds of extras from local Los
Angeles parishes crowded onto the
the Paramount lot for six davs of
filming, working only for food.
Kelly is very modest ahout her
performance, but her Day is truly
inspiring. Kelly has more of Day in
her than she is willing to admit,
such as strength of character and an
outspoken nature. Day didn't lust
work for the poor, she became poor
to serve them and see them all as her
angels. Day acted on her convic
tions, as Kelly does.
Kieser referred to Day during the
interview as "the American Mother
Teresa" — made of steel inside yet
covered with sandpaper. Although
Kelly's demeanor may have been a
bit scratchy, her beliefs and passions
are secureb anchored. Dav'swords,
that begin the film, can be seen as a
guide to understanding Kelly.
"1 wanted the abundance of
life.... I did not have the slightest
idea how to find it."
