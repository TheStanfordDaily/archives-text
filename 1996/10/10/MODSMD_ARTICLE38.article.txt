# Prepare for Parody: Capitol Steps Stomp into Mem Aud
## 
### Liz Chien 
Imagine this scenario: A dark room in
Washington, D.C. A couple of people are
hunched over the television screen, rub
bing their hands in glee. The focus of their
interest? The first of two televised presi
dential debates. Sen. Bob Dole and Presi
dent Bill Clinton are hard at work trying to
convince the American people thattheir re
spective plans are best for the country.
Then, the blunders come, one after the
other. Instead of pushing his tax cut propos
al, Dole discusses his cholesterol level and
Web site. The people in the dark room fran
tically scribble down all this verbiage, for it
is the very lifeblood that will sustain them in
the weeks to come. The question looms:

Who are these people
and why are they here?
The answeris simple.
The Capitol Steps are
here to make you laugh.
Stanford is in for a treat
tonight as the Steps get
ready for their 8 p.m. en
trance at Memorial Au
ditorium, following last
year's highly popular
performance on cam
pus.
In this election year
where mudslinging oc

curs on both sides, the Capitol Steps run
right into the middle of the mishmash. Ob
taining comedic material from the blunders
of both Democrats and Republicans, the
Steppers are a nonpartisan group of former
and current Congressional staffers who
thought politics would go down a little eas
ier with a dose of laughter and song.
A quick lesson in Stepper philosophy as
given by co-founder Elaina Newport: "Typi
cally the Republicans goof up, and the De
mocrats party. Then the Democrats goof up,
and the Republicans party. That's what we
call the two-party system."
Although Capitol Steps seem to emanate
youthful vigor, they have been around for 15
years. Co-founder Bill Strauss recalls that
the group first came together in the summer

of 1981 and gave its debut performance a
few months later as the entertainment at a
Christmas office party for Illinois Sen.
Charles Percy.
The members joke that they originally
considered staging a traditional Nativity
play, but in all of Congress, they were un
able to find three wise men, much less a vir
gin. Thus, they resorted to current events,
which they satirized in the form of popular
songs. One example is their ditty sung to the
long-titled tune from "Mary Poppins" about
members of Congress, who are character
ized as "super, callous, mean and nasty
right-wing legislation."
In fact, Capitol Steps was not the out
growth of a Nativity play but actually was an
idea that had been in the making since the

previous election, when the Senate shifted
from Democratic to Republican. Newly un
employed, Strauss and Newport began to
write songs about various Senators. "It was
sort of like a jam session," remembers
Strauss.
Over the summer lull of 1981, the duo
continued creating the song parodies, and
when it came time for the infamous Christ
mas show, the troupe was ready. "The
preparations for the Christmas show start
ed in October. It was tough since we had
full-time jobs then and had to practice dur
ing lunch," Strauss says.
With no support from any special inter
est groups or political action committees,
Capitol Steps relied on children's toys as
equipment for the shows. Strauss explains,
"We weren't very technically sophisticat-

Ed, but that was fine since we had to keep
things low-key." Percy, Strauss' and New
port's boss at the time, was under heavy
scrutiny from both his own party and the op
position.
Up until this time, Strauss and Newport
considered Capitol Steps a hobby since
they both had full-time jobs with Percy. "But

then he lost, and we had
to figure out what we
wanted to do. By then, we
had assembled other
members from Congres
sional staffs and decided
that it was time to go into
business," Strauss says.
Once in business, they
received raving biparti-

San recognition. Ronald
Reagan jokingly warned
the company, "You're all
under arrest," and Vice
President (and Strauss'
college classmate) Al
Gore commented, "Some
people in Washington are
confused, but the Capitol
Steps are not"

As the Steps evolved, they were able to
more specifically define their mission. "We
are trying to reach people who might be po
tentially associated with politics," says
Strauss. "A lot of young people have been
getting their political information from late
night television (Jay Leno and David Letter
man). So, we wanted to add our name to
that mix."

Since the prerequisite for becoming a
Stepper is experience working in Congress,
the political parodies they stage are actual
ly quite educational in their authenticity. For
instance, an actress who auditioned forthe
Steps had to intern for the House Subcom
mittee on the Environment before she could
even be considered for a spot. Likewise, the

Steppers who will perform at Memorial Au
ditorium tonight are all veteran Congres
sional staffers whose work has included
stints with Rep. Connie Morella, the House
Subcommittee on Health and the Environ
ment, and the Senate Governmental Affairs
Subcommittee.
The troupe has not only worked with
high-ranking figures; they have also per

formed for them. Past audience members
have included such dignitaries as the Clin
tons, Pete and Gayle Wilson, Willie Brown
and the Gores. Of course, no show could
top playing forthe O.J. Simpson jury.
"We weren't sure exactly what we were
allowed to sing," says Strauss. "After all,
the jury was being sequestered at the time

and couldn't have any contact with current
news, which is what most of our material is
based on." Little did the Simpson jury know
that they themselves would later be fea
tured in the Steps' songs.
No one is safe from the Steps' satirical
bite — least of all the presidents, whose
major decisions the Steps like to take cred
it for influencing. During the 1988 Republi

can National Convention, the Steps did a
show at Bush's residence, and Newport
overheard him saying to a group of people,
"You know, I haven't decided on a running
mate — who should I pick?" Newport sug
gested that he "pick somebody funny."
Well, Bush did, and Quayle provided comic
relief for the next four years.

In another presidential
encounter, Strauss remem
bers a show that the Capitol
Steps played at the White
House right ofter the end of
the Gulf War. "Of course,
we had a lot of material on
Bush and Saddam (Hus
sein). But before the show,
a White House staffer came
up to me and asked that we

Typically the Republicans goof up,
ana the Democrats party. Tnen the
Democrats goof up, ana the Repub
licans party.That's what we call the
two-party system.'
—Elaina Newport, co-founder of the Capitol Steps

refrain from performing any
songs about the president."
The performance pro
ceeded smoothly, until the
end of the program when
"Bush came up to me and
asked, 'Has this show been
censored?' I looked at him
and returned, "What do you
think?' 'You have songs
about me?' I nodded. He

looked at me and said, 'Do them.' Bush was
a really good sport"
In fact he was such a good sport that
after his loss in the 1992 election, Bush ap
parently said, "The Capitol Steps make it
easier to leave public office."
The Capitol Steps take full advantage of
the political arena by featuring guest per
formers such as Al Gore, Sam Donaldson,

Dick Cheney, Pat Robertson, former Sur
geon General C. Everett Koop, George Bush
and Ross Perot, who offers his own unique
perspective on issues. According to New
port, Perot likes to adds his down-South
homilies such as "Dealin' with the deficit is
kinda like findin' a rattlesnake in your pants
— you know you gotta take out your gun
and shoot it, but you don't want to hit any
thing important."
The same "anything goes" attitude that
allow the Steppers to include Perot in their
program accounts for the origins of their
name. "In 1981, there were rumors flying
around that Sen. Genrette and his wife Rita
had made love on the Capitol Steps. We've
used that name ever since," says Strauss.
Not surprisingly, Strauss' irreverence
extends to his personal life. After receiving

both a bachelor's and a law degree from
Harvard University, he was ready to settle
for a career as a congressional staffer. But
one summer working as an intern at a large
law firm in San Francisco convinced him
that the field was not for him.
"I remember looking out the window and
thinking that the police officers had a more
interesting job than I did. I guess I was just
inoculated against the Dilbert style of law.
Whenever I get my law school question
naire that asks about my career field, I al
ways have to check 'other.'"
But Strauss has no regrets about his un
orthodox job. "I can'tthink of anything more
fun to do. Live theater is a wonderful human
experience where you get to make people
think as well as laugh." As a civil rights
activist at Harvard, Strauss never thought
that being an entertainer would be a fulfill

ing career. But he claims it is because
"there is no way to duplicate how a theater
audience thanks you."
Thus, in a tacky brown Al Gore wig,
Strauss forges ahead with the Steps. "Hey,
this beats working for a living. I always fig
ured that I would be writing serious books
instead of cracking jokes for a living." (In
fact, Strauss is an expert on generational
history and has published several books on
the subject.)
With their extensive background in poli
tics, the troupe realizes that the issues are
not simple, and they try to make them clear
er through portrayals of a phantom-y Newt,
an Elvis-like Clinton and a stiff Al Gore.
It is this type of smart, sassy parody that
has put Capitol Steps in such high demand
The 18-member troupe performs approxi

mately 300 shows annual
ly, including several on
National Public Radio.
They have also been fea
tured on "Good Morning
America," "ABC News
Nightline," "The Today
Show," "20/20" and other
national news and radio
programs. Acting in rota
tions of six members, the
Steppers are allowed to
continue working at their

"real world" jobs in Congress.
As for that huddled viewing of the presi
dential debate, Stanford can look forward
to reaping the benefits of the recent politi
cal bloopers. Strauss stressesthat "it won't
be an evening where you will be preached
at. But if you come home with a few new
thoughts, that will be good, too."
Or maybe you'll walk away sharing the
more prosaic reaction of George Bush:
"Gosh, the Capitol Steps are really neat."
