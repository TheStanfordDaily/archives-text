## NIRVANA "FROM THE MUDDY BANKS OF THE WISHKAH" 
### 
If the release of Nirvana's "MTV Un
plugged in New York" proved anything, it's
that revisionist history is not exclusive to
academia. The brilliant, naked arrangements
of "Unplugged" thrived on the late Kurt
Cobain's weary voice, using it as a battered
instrument and pushing the lyrics — usually
mumbled and submerged in a barrage ot
power chords — to the forefront.
Critics and fans took this opportunity to
detect and dissect every conceivable refer
ence to Cobain's death, in the process recast
ing Nirvana in a much more subdued, re
signed and emotionally brutal light than
their first four albums would suggest.
"From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah,"
a 17-song live album, is surviving band
members Krist Novosclic and Dave Grohl's
attempt to return the conception ot Nir
vana's music to something slightly more cel
ebratory and aggressive. "Wishkah" is still
edged in darkness — the phrase "Obituary
birthday" from "Milk It" comes to mind —
but its selections rock out at listeners instead
of dragging them down.
This is, of course, really nothing new. It's
become a rock-critic cliche to talk about the
tension between "Beatles-esquc" melody and
raw noise in Cobain's music, and with live
versions of "Aneurysm," "Been a Son" and
"PoIIv," among others, there's some ot that
tension here. There's also simple sentiment

expressed with painful emotional honesty, as
in "School" ("Won't you believe it, just my
luck — no recess!"), "Sliver" ("Grandma take
me home") and "Lithium" (in which a cho
rus of "yeah" comes across as legitimately
deep).
What "Wishkah" offers is essentially
trademark Nirvana in greatest hits form.
None of the album's tracks substantially dif
fer from their studio counterpart, and there
are no obscurities or covers — one of the as
pects that made "Unplugged" so appealing.
Sure, these are fiery performances, seam
lessly mixed together to form what seems like
one definitive concert experience, and sure,
after the stripped sound of "Unplugged," the
pure power found here is almost unsettling.
But there's really nothing on "Wishkah"
that isn't on "Bleach," "Nevermind," "Inces
ticide" or "In Utero" — except for some
crowd noise, which any die-hard fan can find
on bootleg. Besides making a posthumous
point about Nirvana's rock legacy and its
rightful place, "The Muddy Banks of the
Wishkah" doesn't seem to have much of a
point.
