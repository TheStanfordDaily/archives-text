# Physics prof. earns Nobel Prize
## Osheroff's award marks second consecutive for a Stanford faculty member

For the second year in a row, a Stanford profes
sor will share the Nobel Prize for physics.
Physics Prof. Douglas Osheroff, 51, was one of
three Americans named as the 1996 Nobel Prize
winners yesterday for research on superfluid heli
um-3. The work was done while Osheroff was a
graduate student at Cornell University, with his
thesis advisers, David Lee and Robert Richardson.
"It's pretty exciting," Osheroff said. "I just don't
know what to expect. People all over the world have
called. I'm getting congratulations from people I
haven't seen in years."
Osheroff spent the day fielding questions from
reporters, talking to students and colleagues, and
responding to the more than 40 phone messages
and several hundred e-mail messages he had re
ceived since first learning of the award at 2:30 a.m.
He did take time, however, to teach his 4 p.m. class,
a sophomore dialogue on the physics of photogra
phy.
"I asked them if they would prefer hearing about
lenses or superfluidity in helium-3," Osheroff said.
"They opted for the latter."
The physics of his discovery is very complex, Os
heroff said. The hour that it took to explain to a
group of students with varied backgrounds in
physics, he said, provided good practice for expand
ing on the work for others.
The balance Osheroff — winner of the 1991 Wal
ter J. Gores teaching award — has been able to cre
ate in pursuing research in low-temperature

physics while continuing to teach at the undergrad
uate level drew praise from his colleagues and stu
dents.
Stanford has a tradition of Nobel laureates
teaching introductory-level courses, Physics De
partment Chair Bias Cabrera said at a celebration
yesterday outside the Varian Physics Building.
"Doug will continue that tradition," Cabrera
said. "This shows excellence in research does breed
excellence in teaching."
Physics Prof. Steve Chu, who nominated Os
heroff for the Gores award, said the laureate fits
into Stanford's ideas of what a teacher and re
searcher should be.
"We don't hide them and give them special
waivers on teaching," he said of the University's
best researchers. "We really believe some of the best
teachers are also some of the best researchers."
Fifth-year doctoral student Barry Barker noted
that Osheroff teaches Physics 45 regularly. "Every
year, he spends about 20 hours a week in office
hours," Barker said.
Osheroff also knows how to balance his role as an
adviser to his graduate students, Barker said.
"He takes his mentoring very seriously," Barker
said. "He'swillingtobackus llOpercentand give us
any aid we need without being overpowering."
Another member of Osheroffs group, fourth
year doctoral student Doug Natelson agreed with
Barker's assessment.
"He's a really good person to work for," Natelson
said. "He does a great job of walking that line. He's
