# Physics prof. earns Nobel Prize
## Osheroff's award marks second consecutive for a Stanford faculty member 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
For the second year in a row, a Stanford profes
sor will share the Nobel Prize for physics.
Physics Prof. Douglas Osheroff, 51, was one of
three Americans named as the 1996 Nobel Prize
winners yesterday for research on superfluid heli
um-3. The work was done while Osheroff was a
graduate student at Cornell University, with his
thesis advisers, David Lee and Robert Richardson.
"It's pretty exciting," Osheroff said. "I just don't
know what to expect. People all over the world have
called. I'm getting congratulations from people I
haven't seen in years."
Osheroff spent the day fielding questions from
reporters, talking to students and colleagues, and
responding to the more than 40 phone messages
and several hundred e-mail messages he had re
ceived since first learning of the award at 2:30 a.m.
He did take time, however, to teach his 4 p.m. class,
a sophomore dialogue on the physics of photogra
phy.
"I asked them if they would prefer hearing about
lenses or superfluidity in helium-3," Osheroff said.
"They opted for the latter."
The physics of his discovery is very complex, Os
heroff said. The hour that it took to explain to a
group of students with varied backgrounds in
physics, he said, provided good practice for expand
ing on the work for others.
The balance Osheroff — winner of the 1991 Wal
ter J. Gores teaching award — has been able to cre
ate in pursuing research in low-temperature

physics while continuing to teach at the undergrad
uate level drew praise from his colleagues and stu
dents.
Stanford has a tradition of Nobel laureates
teaching introductory-level courses, Physics De
partment Chair Bias Cabrera said at a celebration
yesterday outside the Varian Physics Building.
"Doug will continue that tradition," Cabrera
said. "This shows excellence in research does breed
excellence in teaching."
Physics Prof. Steve Chu, who nominated Os
heroff for the Gores award, said the laureate fits
into Stanford's ideas of what a teacher and re
searcher should be.
"We don't hide them and give them special
waivers on teaching," he said of the University's
best researchers. "We really believe some of the best
teachers are also some of the best researchers."
Fifth-year doctoral student Barry Barker noted
that Osheroff teaches Physics 45 regularly. "Every
year, he spends about 20 hours a week in office
hours," Barker said.
Osheroff also knows how to balance his role as an
adviser to his graduate students, Barker said.
"He takes his mentoring very seriously," Barker
said. "He'swillingtobackus llOpercentand give us
any aid we need without being overpowering."
Another member of Osheroffs group, fourth
year doctoral student Doug Natelson agreed with
Barker's assessment.
"He's a really good person to work for," Natelson
said. "He does a great job of walking that line. He's

own ideas and make their own mis
takes."
Being able to teach was part of
the motivation for OsherofFs move
from AT&T Bell Labs to Stanford
in 1987, he said.
His major responsibility at Bell
Labs was research. "Even though I
enjoyed doing research, I found my
self yearning to do more that would
add significance to my life," he said.
"Teaching does that."
Osheroff earned his bachelor's
in physics from Cal Tech in 1967
and a doctorate from Cornell in
1973. He joined the Stanford facul
ty in 1987 as the J.G. Jackson and
C.J. Wood Professor in physics.
The Nobel Prize caps a long list
of recognitions Osheroff has re
ceived. A member of the National
Academy of Sciences, he has won
the Simon Memorial Prize and
the Oliver E. Buckley Prize and
been named a Mac Arthur Prize
Fellow.
Osheroff said he started on his
distinguished career in physics be
fore he could even connect a name
to his interests.
"I was always tearing apart my
toys to get the motors out and play
ing with magnets," he said. "I was
just fascinated with all manner of
physical behavior.... It was all so
magical."
He first was drawn to low-tem
perature physics when he went to
work at a laboratory at Cal Tech to

avoid a required physics course.
Two other people working at the
lab "kept telling me about how real
ly fascinating the properties of liq
uid helium-4 were," Osheroff said.
The Cal Tech researchers were
cooling the helium in a manner sim
ilar to that used by Osheroff at Cor
nell when he cooled helium-3 to two
thousandths of a degree above ab
solute zero.
The work at Cal Tech was "very
exciting," Osheroff said, and by the
time he left for Cornell, he knew he
wanted to pursue low-temperature
physics.
Upon arriving at Cornell, he met
Lee. "He ran a low-temperature
lab, and I basically just got sucked
in," Osheroff said
Lee's recruitment of the new
graduate student paid off, as the
group eventually discovered the
first of three superfluid phases of
liquid helium-3.
University President Gerhard
Casper, Provost Condoleezza Rice
and other administrators yesterday
praised Osheroff for his representa
tion of his new home at Stanford.
"I feel great, great" about this,
Casper said at the second Nobel
Prize-winner party he has hosted in
two years. "I couldn't be better. It
shows we are doing something
right, at least in hiring faculty."
"We're extremely proud of
Doug," said Dean of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven. "He's a
fantastic teacher, as well as a world
renowned scholar."
The Nobel Prize is a "recogni
tion that I think is well-deserved,"
Shoven said. "There will be more
[winners] to come. But this is
Doug's day."
