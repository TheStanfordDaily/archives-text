# CITIZEN FISH "THIRST"
## 
### 
Let's face it — most of the old punk bands
that are still playing today stink worse than
week-old beer. I ong since out of interesting
ideas, the majority are reduced to self-paro
dv, recycling their long-dead adolescent
angst for fans who weren't even born when
this stuff was original. Old fans are forced to
either settle for crap or sigh and remember
the days when these were actually pretty

good bands. Fortunately for hard-to-pleasc
types like me, there are still bands like Citizen
Fish who knock this pattern on its head.
Having played together in some form or
another for almost 20 years, Citizen Fish may
well win punk's Longevity Award. Three of
the current members were in the Subhu
mans, whose experimental sound and angry,
political lyrics cut a major swath through the
British punk scene of the early 1980s.
Later, two of the members served in Cul
ture Shock, one of the first bands to success
fully graft punk's fury and activism onto
danceable ska and reggae rhythms. Citizen
Fish came together in 1990, and since then
they've released more albums of consistently
impressive music than almost any other band
I can think of.
Like Culture Shock, their music blends
ska, punk and reggae into a potent brew
that's greater than the sum of its parts.
"Thirst," their fifth full-length, builds on the
formula of its predecessors, then one-ups
them. It's punk-ska, I guess, but not the kind
that's being popularized today, where a ska
riff is idly tossed in to liven up an otherwise
boring song.
This is more complex — on tracks like
"City On A River" ska beats gradually work
their way into a raging punk rant, only to
drop suddenly into a minor-key reggae
breakdown that makes the hairs on the back
ofyour neck stand up. Horns, jazz and even a
spoken-word piece arc periodically tossed in
to add further spice.
But Citizen Fish aren't just good musi
cians: Singer Dick Lucas also writes intelli
gent, passionate and witty lyrics. Urban re
newal, credit cards, pointless jobs, pollution
and top 40 music are only a few of the issues
thoughtfully dissected here, and it's still
catchy enough to dance to. Skip the 20 bucks
for the Sex Pistols reunion, wait till No Doubt
shows up in the bargain bins, and pick this up
instead: I guarantee you "Thirst" will stand
the test of time.
