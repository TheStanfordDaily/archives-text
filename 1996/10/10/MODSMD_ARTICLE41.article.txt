# MARTHA ARGERICH "TCHAIKOVSKY, PIANO CONCERTO NO. 1"
## 
### 
In a market overflowing with hundreds of
recordings of Tchaikovsky's First Piano Con
certo, there is little reason for Deutsche
Grammophon to issue yet another. There's
even less reason for Martha Argerich, whose
discography is staggeringly small, to commit
her fourth foray into this hackneyed piece.
But whatever misgivings one might have, this
new release will dispel them and will only
fortify Argerich's already formidable artistry.
Few could rival the sense of freshness and
spontaneity Argerich brings to this played
to-death war horse. Surprising turns and
twists abound in just about every measure.
Argerich's chordal entry in the first move
ment remains fiercely triumphant while the
second subject is introduced with utmost
tenderness and lyricism. The momentum she
builds is paced so naturally that one barely
senses the impending danger when the or
chestra picks up the tempo which perfectly
tailors Argerich's crashing double octaves.
This time around, however, she keeps her vir
tuosity at bay and achieves a stunningly pow
erful yet smooth octave runs.
Still more surprises await in the second
movement, where she unveils the first theme
with beguiling simplicity. No sooner does the
last note of this section fade than Argerich
launches into the Prestissimo section with
neck-breaking velocity. Here Argerich uses
sforzando to the best of her advantage.
In the Finale movement, Argerich regales
with thunderbolts and filigree alike. The par
allel runs glitter with hair-raising speed and
clarity yet maintains a prolonged and unbro
ken legato. Fler legendary octaves seethe with

drive that passionately seals the coda.
The Finale is clearly the best of her four
recorded attempts at this piece. Nowhere else
does she demonstrate a more mature concep
tion, seamless rapport and coloristic shad
ings than in this live performance with Clau
dio Abbado, who lent her superlative orches
tral support. As for other recordings of this
piece which everybody plays but nobody
plays well, only Richter's rendition with Karl
Ancel on Supraphon can hold a candle to
Argerich.
