## THE 						ROOTS "ILLADELPH HALFLIFE" 
### 
Rarely does a rap album come out that is
so musically creative without ever straying
from its hip-hop roots. Justifying their name,
The Roots have created a masterpiece with
"Illadelph Halflife," their first album since
1994's "Do You Want More?" Much like their
last collection, "Illadelph Halflife" bring to
gether a plethora of live instruments (includ
ing tambourines, saxophones, guitars and a
cello) to put together a beautiful 20-track
eargasmic experience.
The music is varied — from the orchestra
sounds backing "Concerto of the Desperado"
to the jazzy "What They Do" and "One
Shine." Other tracks, like "No Alibi" sound
mystical and almost eerie. But do not be
fooled; this album is pure hip-hop. The
Roots' lead vocalist, Black Thought, has ex
plained, "The Roots are a product of a bona
fide, spinning-on-the-sidewalk, buying-12-
inches-in-1979, banging-out-beats-with
their-fists hip-hop culture." The ability to
combine a raw hip-hop bassline with rip
pling keyboards and a mellow sax are what
make this album a classic.
Lyrically, the album comes through,
breaking free from the all-too-common
gangsterisms that plague rap today. On
"Clones," the album's first single, lyricist

Malik B kicks rhymes
about the roots of hip-hop
and the phony MC's try
ing to make a buck off the
product: "fake niggaz
don't go platinum, they go
aluminum," he raps, let
ting rappers know that no
matter how much they
sell, they must remain true
to where they came from.
On "The Hypnotic,"
Black Thought tells the
story of a love gone tragi
cally wrong, over a track
complete with sleigh bells
and D'Angelo's soft hack
ground vocals and electric
guitar. Even Q-Tip lays
down some vocals on "Ital
(the Universe Side)."
1 can't say enough
about this album. The
Roots are a collection of
true hip-hop musicians, a
combination not too often
found in the rap game. "ll
ladelph 1 lalflife" is a guid
ed tour of hip-hop fantasy
land. Ciet on board as soon
as possible.
