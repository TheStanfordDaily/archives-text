# WEEZER "PINKERTON"
## 
### 
Poor Rivers Cuomo.
Sure, he's the frontman for the band Weezer,
whose self-titled debut allium went double
platinum on the strength of such gooey pop
songs as "Buddy Holly" and "Say It Ain't
So." Sure, he's successfully weathered the ac
cusations that Weezer rode into fame on
Green Day's punk-pop coattails, which is
ridiculous, since Rivers is a much better

songwriter than Billic Joe. Sure, his cute
nerd looks and yearning lyrics have made
him a bit ofan international sex symbol. But
the poor boy slill can't get laid.
Weezer has always walked the fine line
between the machismo-soaked rock aes
thetic and the filling-the-world-with-sillv
love-songs aesthetic. For every innocuous
"Buddy Holly," there's a "No One Else," in
which Rivers sings, "I want a girl who will
laugh for no one else / When I'm away, she
puts her makeup on the shelf / When I'm
away, she never leaves the house."
Weezer's monolithic guitars crash and
swoon when Rivers croons like a boy in love;
but when the love turns sour, the croon
turns to a snarl, and the guitars stomp
around like a third-grader throwing a hissy
fit. Rivers isn't afraid to express thoughts
that most people wouldn't admit they have;
however, such honesty can sometimes be
off-putting.
"Pinkerton" contains the same basic
Weezer formula: Boy falls in love with girl,
boy can't have girl, boy agonizes lor a while
and then writes a song about his inability to
deal with girl.
Starting off with the searing synth riff of
"Tired of Sex" (obviously an influence of
bassist Matt Sharp, who heads Moog-pop
sters the Rentals) and the desperate menace
of "Getchoo," "Pinkerton" takes on a dis
tinctly angrier edge than the group's first
album. Throughout, Rivers pursues women
he knows he could never have: a Japanese
pen pal ("Across The Sea"), a lesbian ("Pink
Triangle") and a classical cellist who knows

nothing about pop music (the first single
"F.I Scorcho").
Of course, with all the pounding drums
and guitars the size of a house looming be
hind Rivers' vocals, you might not even care
about the words; you'll be too busv rocking
out to notice. When all is said and done,
"Pinkerton" breaks absolutely no new
ground in the music universe, but its a great
slab of fluffy grunge-pop that you'll be
singing along to for months to come.
