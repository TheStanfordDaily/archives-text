## Patricia Broderick explains why you can't yell too much when the director is your son. An exclusive interview. 
### Joe Rosenblum 
For those of us who in our adolescence
worshipped the king teen-ager Ferris Bueller,
Matthew Broderick's subsequent career
moves have been about as surprising as if The
Fonz took the lead role in "To Wong F00..."
I'm not talking only about "Torch Song Trilo
gy" but such equally far removed films as
"The Road to Wellville" and "Glory," as well.
Broderick, while still boyish and bright
eyed, has moved forward with his career, act
ing and directing both on- and off- Broadway
productions. His newest film and directorial
debut is "Infinity," an excerpt from the life of
Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feyn
man.
"Infinity" carries the unique tag of having
been written, directed and produced solely by
the Irish Broderick clan. The first Hollywood
collaboration between Broderick and his
mother Patricia, "Infinity" was written by
mom and co-produced by the overtly Oedi
pal pair.
While on the promotional circuit for the
new film, Patricia made time for a brief bi
coastal chat, dialing in from NYC to talk to
me like a mother about art, atoms and the ab
stract.
INTERMISSION: Can you tell me about your
painting?
PATRICIA BRODERICK: I don't know how
to describe it. Do you have the press kit?
/.Yeah.
PB: I got them to ask someone who has a lot
of my paintings when they asked me that:
"What kind of paintings do you do?" And I
said, "You better ask somebody else." And
they did, it's in there. I'm not being rude, Ire
ally don't know how to answer that.
I: Well, what role has painting played in your
life?
PB: It's what I've mostly done. That's what 1
do. I'm not being difficult. What do you

mean?
I: Is it how you find fulfillment?
PB: I guess; it's what I do.
I: Hoes painting tie into the drama that you've
written?
PB: I guess just because I'm the same person.
But I've never written about that or anything.
I don't know how I got to doing both. I origi
nally worked backstage. You know, like 1 did
that for money, but then I painted, right? And
then, at some point 1 was having difficulty
| with j painting and 1 was also directing and
teaching. And [back then| it was difficult for
women directors to get jobs so some very nice
actor said to me, "Well, I don't see why you
couldn't learn something from writing a play,
as a director," and I said, "Well, 1 can't write,"
and he said, "I didn't say 'a good play."' So I
did write a play, and after a while 1 wrote for
television. You know those specials? I wrote
fancy television.
I: Do you mean like TV movies?
PB: In those days it wasn't TV movies. What I
mean by fancy is "stars." Like Hitchcock
movies, only made into the 52-minute for
mat. With fancy movie stars. I was writing
plays and I did plays in London, and here, off-
Broadwav and that, and then I switched back
[to painting] and did really only that for 20
years. And then 1 worked on "Glory," becaue
Matthew was in that and there was some kind
of difficulty, and 1 did most of the final
rewrite. I don't know if I'm supposed to talk
about that; I didn't get credit for it. And I
didn't fight for credit, either. I had no inten
tion of doing anything else [in film), and then
Matthew liked this story [about Feynman)
and wanted to do it. It found me.
I: Was this the first biographical drama you've
worked on?
PB: Yeah and it was the first full [feature]
movie I've ever done, and I had no inten
tion of doing one; but we wanted to do it to
gether, so we could do it our own way. We
started out together on the story. We did it

together very much.
1: So this wasn't the first professional collabora
tion between you and your son?
PB: It was our first public collaboration. I
mean I've worked with him forever on parts
at home anyways, but this was fully credited.
The difference was you can't yell too much,
and when you do fight you can't [swear at
each other) because you're closer, so that
would be worse. We had the same fights we've
always had but not publicly. We very much
think in the same language, so that's very
good.
I: So you've been involved with your son's career
from the very begining?
PB: Yeah, and I was [ involved | with Jimmy's
[career], and Jimmy was [involved] with
[Matthew's career] as well. Jimmy was my
husband, and he was also an actor. We always
have worked together; it doesn't necessarily
imply anything else, although some people
think it does.
I: What do they think it implies?
PB: Oh, that we get on in some special
way.... 1 mean, I think we get on as well or

badly.... I mean, [I) adore
him and all that... .But, we
get on whatever way a
mother and son would get
on anyway, it's just that we
do work together very well.
I've had boyfriends that

I've worked very well with and after we broke
up we went on working well together ...
I: I grew up with the Cold War scare films likt
"The Day After" and even "War Games"...
PB: (interrupts) Hid you see the film?
I: I saw "Infinity."
PB: You did?
I: Ve*.
PB: lie's a lot older in that than he was in
"War Games."
/: Yes, I dnin't mean to draw a parallel between
the two. "Infinity" is one of the first movies l'v(
seen that treats the atomic bomb without an
obvious reference to or influence from the Cola
War. Do you think you could have made this
movie before the end of the Cold Warr
PB: It's certainly J story of the end of innno
cence — that's a horrible phrase — it's also
modern America. Once they heard that
sound reverberating, they were frightened b\
the noise going on while they were in that
ditch — it was out of control, which is 1 guess
what the whole movie is about; it certainly
happened to America then. You don't control
an atomic bomb; but Feynman wasn't wor
ried about that, he was more worried about
his wife.
