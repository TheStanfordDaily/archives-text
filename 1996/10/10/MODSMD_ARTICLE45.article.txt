## 'Move' Over, Eddie Ross' romantic comedy worse than a bad date 
### 
I so admire independent filmmakers for their guts,
determination and commitment to making their vi
sions reality. The making of "Ed's Next Move," a good
ol* New York indie, is a classic story of constant strug
gle with under-budgeting, under-staffing and some
how, last-minute miracles. Unfortunately, the film's
production notes are more moving than the product,
which is the apotheosis of mediocrity.
The movie is about a nice, normal, though rather
uptight guy named lid (Matt Ross). Back home in
Wisconsin, he gets dumped by his girlfriend and de
cides to move to New York City. The movie becomes a
quick cliche of a naive nerd lost in the big bad city. He
spills lemons at a fruit stand, gets his backpack
dumped in the trash, gets pushed around in the sub
way entrance and encounters all kinds of weirdo char
acters: a performance artist, a karate fanatic and a pot
obsessed paranoid. I should acknowledge that some
audience members found these situations wildly
funny, but for me they were far too contrived to
muster any laughs.
Although Ed loves his job as a genetics researcher at
the World Rice Institute, he's a bit lonely and becomes
infatuated with an uninterested musician, Lee (Callie
Thorne). The movie becomes the tale of the pursuer and
the pursued, and the ending is incredibly predictable.
It's not that the film is a total waste — in fact, there
are two worthwhile elements. There's the quirky hip
pie music from Lee's band (she plays violin). Record
ed by San Francisco-based Ed's Redeeming Qualities,
the music is fun — I recommend the soundtrack. And
Ross' totally adorable smile is so amusing, it's almost
worth the $7 — but not quite.
The movie's intention seems to be a feel-good ro
mantic comedy a la "The Brothers McMullen." The
genre is difficult to pull off without doing what's been
done before, and writer-director John Walsh has none
of the wit, charm or originality which makes "Mc-
Mullen" director Ed Burns' movies so appealing. In
stead, this film, despite all the blood and sweat that
went into its making, never steps beyond the expect
ed, and remains throughout perfectly blase.
