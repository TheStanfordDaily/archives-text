## 'Ducks' sequel good but not quite a swan 
### 
In light of "D 2: The Mighty Ducks"' fail
ure to make itself interesting— no surprise
for the world of the sequel — 1 was wary of a
third episode to this duck story. But "D 3: The
Mighty Ducks" wasn't all that bad. As in the
first "Mighty Ducks" movie, it takes time
outs from the hockey-playing and teen-age
high jinks to develop characters and their re
lationships.
In this third installment in the series, time
has passed since the Mighty Ducks, a junior
high hockey team, defeated the Hawks (their
enemy in"The Mighty Ducks") and Team Ice
land (their enemy in "D 2"). Now, it's time for
them to move on to high school (hey, even
"90210'5" Brandon and Brenda Walsh had to
go to college). And as fate — or Disney —

would have it, the whole team's been given full
athletic scholarships to attend Fden Hall Acad
emy, a Minnesota prep school full of"cake-eat
ing" jocks and cheerleaders. All but one Duck
accepts, and voila — the stage is set for a story
of puberty on ice.
Coach Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez),
the miracle-working coach of "The Mighty
Ducks" and "D 2" fame, is now director of the
Junior Hockey League, leaving his team in the
hands of junior varsity coach Ted Orion (Jef
frey Nordling). But Orion rubs the Ducks' cap
tain Charlie Conroy (Joshua Jackson) the
wrong way, and their first argument kicks off
the team's long struggle to understand and ap
pease its coach.
The Ducks let off their frustration by play

ing tit-for-tat with the snobby varsity hockey
team, alternately getting had and getting re
venge using whatever they can get their hands
on — Brazilian ants one time, a freeze-ma
chine another.
But while their personal problems get re
solved in time for the big game against the var
sity team, their athletic shortcomings (their
defense sucks) don't. 1 won't say what happens
then, but you can guess. There's a lot of yelling,
kissing and quacking.
You don't need to watch the first two to
enjoy "D 3"; you don't need to be a kid either,
although it would help. But hey — most of us
still act like that anyway (read: fraternity mem
bers, freshmen).
