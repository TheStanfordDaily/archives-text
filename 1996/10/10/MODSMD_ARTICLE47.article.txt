The time has come to tell it like it is: In their third week,
classies are dying a slow and wretched death. For less than
the price of a cup of coffee — in fact for free — you can rem
edy this situation. If you care for us at all, add your own ex
istential musings, sexually repressed one-liners and
scathing commentary. You can do this in two ways: One, by
coming into the sweat box we call The Daily and leaving
them in the appropriate receptacle on the top shelf in the In
termission cubicle; or two, because you're lazy or shy, by e
mailing them to intermission ©daily. Just remember, noth
ing is too stupid or too cryptic. We need your support —
without it, this is all getting embarrassingly masturbatory.

Dear Abby, If you're in a situation
with a boy and you're both a little
drunk and you end up kind of lean
ing against each other and touching
a lot, is the boy always priming you
for when he busts a move or are
there times when he only wants to
lean against you, tot)? If it's possible
that he doesn't want to bust a move
on you immediately, does he still
want to bust a move on you ulti
mately? If, say, he touches your
hair, is it because he wants to touch
your hair or is it because he thinks
he's doing you a favor?
Sincerely, Stymied in Stern

JoJo I). is my only true friend.
Dih's everyone always do every

just me?
The time has come to tell it like it is: In their third week,
classies are dying a slow and wretched death. For less than
the price of a cup of coffee — in fact for free — you can rem
edy this situation. If you care for us at all, add your own ex
istential musings, sexually repressed one-liners and
scathing commentary. You can do this in two ways: One, by
coming into the sweat box we call The Daily and leaving
them in the appropriate receptacle on the top shelf in the In
termission cubicle; or two, because you're lazy or shy, by e
mailing them to intermission ©daily. Just remember, noth
ing is too stupid or too cryptic. We need your support —
without it, this is all getting embarrassingly masturbatory.

Sain P. has lustrous hair.
Long live Ivan the Cat.
Missed Connection / Me: dread
locks, wearing green sweater, walk
ing by History Corner. You: on
mountain bike, pedaling kind of
fast, looking toward Hoover
Tower, eating a bagel and talking to
your friend. You literally took my

ribs) but your calf muscles turned
me on as you whizzed in the other
direction. (ioinc to the second floor
