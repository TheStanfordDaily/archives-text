# Internet II
## Stanford among 33 schools to help develop new network 
### Kelly E. Young Contributing writer 
Stanford may be among the first places to receive
"Internet II,"the new and improved sequel to the In
ternet.
Stanford was among 33 universities that agreed to
help develop a faster, more efficient Internet at a
meeting in Chicago last week.
According to the project's charter statement, the
Internet II aims to "rapidly transfer new network
services and applications to all levels of educational
use and to the broader Internet community, both na
tionally and internationally." Participating universi
ties hope to accomplish this task by providing a
broader bandwidth — the equivalent of a larger pipe
— through which information can travel.
The current Internet can transmit information at
45 megabits per second With broad-band network
connections nationwide, Internet II is expected to
reach speeds of 622 megabits per second.
According to Raman Khanna, director of Stan
ford's Distributed Computing and Communication
Systems, students at the School of Medicine could in
stantaneously receive detailed X-rays from another
university with the new network E-mail and less de
manding Internet tasks would remain on the current
network.
This faster connection could also have several
other advantages for the Stanford
community. Internet II would ser
vice videoconferencing, real-time
transmission of data and voice
and other distance-learning pro
jects.
The Internet II will initially
only have connections with partic
ipating universities and firms.
Members of the Stanford commu
nity wishing to connect with an
organization not participating in
t he project will continue to use the
current Internet until Internet II
is made widely available.
Khanna will chair the project's
charter and goals committee. Part
of his concentration lies in "how
this infrastructure would devel
op "
Internet II will probably not be
operational for several years. By
that time, project members antici
pate the involvement of 50 to 100

universities, along with a number
of federal agencies and telecom
munications and computing firms
like IBM, MCI, AT&T, Sun Mi
crosystems and Cisco Systems.
Most of the funding for the pro
ject will come in the form of small
grants to the universities from
government research agencies
and industry partners.
It seems that the popularity of
Internet II is already spreading.
Since the initial meeting of tech
nology officials on Oct. 1, three
new universities have joined the
group.
The universities which met
agreed to keep charter member
ship in the program open for a lim
ited amount of time for universi
ties that have the capabilities to
support the program. Khanna ex
plained, however, that the devel
opers of Internet II do not want it
to get too crowded too quickly.
"The problem would be to keep
universities out," he said, "be
cause the focus is on end-to-end
quality of service."
