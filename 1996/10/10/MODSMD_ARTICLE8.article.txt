## 'Buckeyball' wins Nobel Prize for chemistry Texans, Briton share honor 
### 
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — Nobel
Prizes went to six scientists today, includ
ing five Americans, for discoveries of whim
sically named molecules known as "bucky
balls" and a bizarre form of helium that
may shed light on the moments after the
big bang.
Two Texans and a Briton won the Nobel
Prize in chemistry for discovering a family
of soccer ball-shaped carbon molecules that
spawned a new field of study. Known unof
ficially as "buckyballs" and officially as
fullerenes, the unusual molecules were
named for R. Buckminster Fuller because
their structure resembles his famed
geodesic domes.
The physics prize went to three U.S. sci
entists for discovering that at extremely
low temperatures a rare form of helium can
flow without losing energy to friction. That
finding has had unexpected applications to
theories about the universe's earliest
moments.
Each prize this year is worth $1.12 mil
lion.
The chemistry prize was shared by
Harold W. Kroto, 57, who teaches at Sus
sex University in England, and chemists
Robert F. Curl, Jr., 63, and Richard E.
Smalley, 53, of Rice University in Houston.
The three discovered buckyballs in 1985.
"It's what every kid who had a chem
istry set dreams of. There's no doubt about
it, it's marvelous," Curl told reporters in
Houston.
"It's a fundamental discovery," said
Salo Gronowitz, chairman of the Nobel
committee for chemistry. "You can practice
a lot of new chemistry with these balls, and
we are on the way to discovering lots of dif
ferent applications."
Gronowitz said chemists expected to
develop whole new materials, in addition to

new medicines, from the discovery within
five to 10 years.
Fullerenes were thought at first to be
an exclusively manmade invention, but
after the chemists created them in the
laboratory the molecules were found in
natural settings on Earth and also in
space.
"No physicist or chemist had expected
that carbon would be found in such a sym
metrical form other than those already
known," the Nobel Academy said in its cita
tion.
The chemists found in 1985 that the
molecules could be created by condensing a
carbon vapor in an atmosphere of inert
gas.
The physics prize went to three U.S.
scientists for discovering that at
extremely low temperatures a form of
helium can flow without losing energy
to friction. That finding has had unex
pected applications to theories about the
universe's earliest moments and opened
a window into a weird subatomic realm.
The peace prize is to be announced
tomorrow in Oslo, Norway.
Tuesday's economics prize went to
William Vickrey of the United States and
Briton James Mirrlees for studies explain
ing how information — or lack of it —
shapes business decisions.
On Monday, the medicine prize was won
by Peter C. Doherty, an Australian work
ing in Tennessee, and Rolf M. Zinkernagel
of Zurich, Switzerland.
This year's Nobel prizes began last
Thursday with Polish poet Wislawa Szym
borska winning the literature award.
The prizes are awarded on Dec. 10, the
anniversary of the death of industrialist
and dynamite-inventor Alfred Nobel,
whose will created the prizes.
