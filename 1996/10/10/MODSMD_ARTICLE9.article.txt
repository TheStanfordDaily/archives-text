# Muslims open prayer hall to counter Jewish tunnel
## 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Muslim
authorities angered Israelis yester
day with plans to open a new under
ground prayer hall at the A 1 Aqsa
MoSque, on the site revered by Jews
as Temple Mount and beside the
Israeli tourist tunnel project that
set off rioting last month.
Hassan Tahboub, the Palestini
an minister of religious affairs, said
the hall would open in two days
once floor tile has been laid — in
time for weekly prayer services
tomorrow.
The announcement comes as
Israelis and Palestinians try to
reconstruct a peace shattered after
Israel opened a new entrance to the
tunnel at the base of the complex.
The riots and clashes last month
killed 78 people.
Tahboub refused to comment
yesterday on the timing, saying only
that the hall was not Israel's
"responsibility or property."
Muslims call the A 1 Aqsa com
plex Haram as-Sharif, or Noble
Enclosure, and it is one of the holi
est sites of Islam. Jews revere it as
the Temple Mount, the site of the
Second Temple that was destroyed
by the Romans in A.D. 70.

The new Muslim prayer hall,
which the Palestinians have named
Marwani Mosque, is in a nearly
2,000-year-old chamber beneath
the A 1 Aqsa Mosque known as
Solomon's Stables. It was built in
the time of King Herod as part of
underground support structures for
an expansion of the Temple Mount.
Islamic tradition says the site
was visited by the prophet
Mohammed and the chamber was
used as a Muslim prayer hall as
early as the Bth century.
Christian tradition says Jesus'
feet were ritually washed on what is
known as the "cradle" stone, and a
chapel marks the site. Christian
Crusaders converted the structure
into stables for their horses.
The previous Israeli government
gave permission in January for the
chamber to be used for prayers dur
ing the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan and during rainy periods
when worshipers cannot pray in the
courtyard of A 1 Aqsa.
But Israel did not authorize the
Muslims to use it on a permanent
basis as a mosque.
Gideon Avny, chief archaeologist
for Jerusalem, said in a report to the

Antiquities Authority that recent
Palestinian renovations have
caused "irreversible damage" to the
site. He said 15-foot-high columns
in the chamber were damaged by
drilling holes for electrical cables
and lamps.
The Israeli complaints follow
Muslim claims of damage to Islamic
heritage buildings caused by Israel's
opening of the new tunnel entrance
last month. Islamic authorities say
the digging there caused cracks in a
half-dozen buildings.
A city spokeswoman said a dis
trict court order issued Sept. 3 bars
unapproved renovations that could
damage Solomon's Stables.
Jewish extremists who seek the
right to pray on the Temple Mount
have asked Israel's Supreme Court
to enforce the lower court order.
The spokeswoman said the city
would not act against the Muslim
authorities pending the outcome of
the court case.
Right-wing Israelis called for
the renovated prayer hall to be
closed, saying it violates the deli
cate status quo over the site and
that renovations might damage
it.
