# Power outage shuts down campus for 4 hours

The University suffered a four-hour power outage
last night after a 12,000 volt switch gear failed at the
Cardinal Cogeneration Facility, the main power sup
ply for the campus.
The failure occurred at 7:26 p.m. and prompted
the relay protection system to disconnect all the cir
cuit breakers, said Jim Soutter, the facility's opera
tions manager. This resulted in the loss of power all
across campus and the shutdown of the cogenera
tion facility.
The cause of the switch gear failure has yet to be
determined, Soutter said.
A switch gear is "like a circuit breaker in your
house," he said. "It's just a lot bigger."
According to sophomore Francisco Najera, who
was attending a meeting in Cypress Hall — which is
located adjacent to the power plant — there was a big
bang at the time of the power outage. However, Sout
ter said, there was no explosion.
The power plant is actually made up of two com
ponents: the Central Energy Facility, which provides
chilled water to the entire campus, including the
Medical Center; and the cogenerator, which produces
steam and electricity. Chilled water and steam power
air conditioning and heating systems, respectively.
According to Central Energy Facility engineer
Mark Alexander, the Medical Center runs on Palo

Alto's power system. However, because of the black
out, the hospital will run without emergency power
until the plant opens up again.
As of 1 a.m. this morning, the entire power plant
was still shut down. The breakc- that failed fed the
energy facility. At 1 a.m., Soutter said he expected
the cogenerator to be up again in the "next couple of
hours" but was uncertain as to when the energy fa
cility would be brought back up. Once the cogenera
tor is operational, the only amenity not available will
be air conditioning.
The cogenerator distributes power to all academ
ic buildings and most dormitories on campus, said
Mark Lawrence, systems coordinator at the
Forsythe Data Center. Several peripheral residen
tial areas, like some Row houses, get their power

from Pacific Gas and Electric and thus did not expe
rience a blackout.
PG&E was eventually able to provide power to the
campus despite an initial problem with the Universi
ty's switching capabilities. Power was restored on
west campus at about 10 p.m., while the remainder of
campus remained in the dark until 11:35 p.m., ac
cording to Stanford Police Sgt. Rick Tipton.
This is Stanford's worst power outage since 1969
after a malfunction occurred at PG&E.
Lawrence said he was on his way home when the
power failed.
"I knew something was wrong when I went to turn
out the lights, and everything went black. I thought,
there's supposed to be more lights on than that,"
Lawrence said.
