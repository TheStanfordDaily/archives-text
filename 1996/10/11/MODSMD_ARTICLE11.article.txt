Hero or thief/
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Yankee fans are toasting him. Orioles fans
want to wring his little neck.
The most crucial glovework in the opening game of the Amer
ican League championship series became a tale of two cities yes
terday: New York bestowed instant celebrity on 12-year-old Jef
frey Maier, the fan whose quick glove boosted his beloved Bronx
Bombers to a victory, while Baltimore cried larceny.
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke opened his weekly news con
ference yesterday by saying the stolen catch showed New York
doesn't have a true zero-tolerance policy toward crime.
Jeffrey's eighth-inning lean-and-grab of a Derek Jeter homer
that looked like it could be caught landed him on ABC's "Good
Morning America."
Later in the day, the crowd in Times Square's All-Star Cafe
gave Maier a standing ovation.
