CINCINNATI (AP) — Bob Dole welcomed
Colin Powell's "vim and vinegar" to the
Republicans' lagging White House race yes
terday and kept up his tease that the popular
retired general would be "one of the stars" in
his administration.
In Dole's largest and most spirited crowd
in weeks, several thousand people jammed
downtown Cincinnati's Fountain Square on a
bright fall day to hear from the Republican
presidential candidate, running mate Jack
Kemp and Powell.
"My task, specifically, is to introduce you
to a straightforward man who has a straight
forward vision for America," Powell said in
introducing Dole and saluting the self
described presidential underdog as a fellow
soldier.
"He wears proudly the Purple Heart as a

daily reminder to him about what fighting for
this country is all about," Powell said of Dole.
Asked offstage what Powell brings to the
campaign, Dole said, "He's a good friend. I
think he gives me more vim and vinegar and
vitality ... a little excitement, too."
Excitement was what Dole had hoped to
generate with his performance against Presi
dent Clinton in their first debate last week.
But with post-debate polls finding Dole's dou
ble-digit deficit largely unchanged, he has just
one week before the final debate to find a
comeback route.
In a striking moment late Wednesday, Dole
expressed frustration with his campaign and
indicated changes would have to be made
quickly. He plans a critical meeting with top
aides tomorrow to decide where he'll target his
advertising and travel in the final 3 1/2 weeks.

"I don't pay attention once I'm on the
road — I'm out of it all day long, 12, 14
hours. But we're going to . . . take a hard
look not only at the electoral maps but every
thing else," Dole said in an interview on
CNN.
For weeks, the campaign has hinted it
would try to stir enthusiasm by announcing
Powell as Dole's pick for secretary of state.
On stage yesterday, with Powell standing
behind him, Dole said nothing of the gener
al's place in a future Dole administration. But
he told reporters Powell was "going to be one
of the stars of our administration."
The idea of announcing Cabinet picks in
advance has been discussed within the Dole
campaign. But Dole, according to campaign
sources, has resisted on grounds it would be
viewed as a gimmick born of desperation.
