Juice Club deserves
contract for store in
Tresidder Union

IN LIFE, IT is often the little
pleasures that can make all
the difference. A sunny day, a
smile from a stranger, a chocolate
chip cookie. These are not things
that students have the right to
demand; they are those little
extra bonuses that make some
days just a little bit brighter than
they would have been otherwise.
For many Stanford students
over the past couple of years, the
cold concoction known as the
Juice Club smoothie had been
just that, a carefree delight that
tasted great and even made you
feel a little healthier.
Then came that fateful after
noon in June when a fire broke
out in the Town and Country Vil
lage Shopping Center. Hobee's, a
breakfast favorite, was the first
to feel the flames, but the fire
soon spread to the surrounding
establishments. Next door, Juice
Club workers and customers
were helpless to stop the surging
flames, and Juice Club fell victim
to a wall of fire it could not con
trol.
And so, one of the little plea
sures of Stanford student life was
erased. No more dorm trips for
smoothies, no more Pacific Pas
sion, no more wheat grass chal
lenges. At least not right across
El Camino Real.
But now, it appears that Juice
Club's status as a campus icon
could be resurrected, this time in
an even more convenient location
than ever. Juice Club right in our
own Tresidder! Could this be?
Have the gods really looked on
Stanford with such favor?
Ridiculous, you say. No, it's
true. Last Wednesday, three juice
bars made presentations to the
Tresidder Advisory Board in
hopes of landing a contract to set
up shop on Tresidder's first floor.

Odwalla, Juice It! and Juice
Club are the three companies
vying to bring smoothies to the
floor space now occupied by
Stanford Hairstyling. Any of the
three would bring a much needed
boost to Tresidder's appeal as a
student union. The combination
of a juice bar and Polio's will
start the ball rolling. More stu
dents will come to Tresidder; the
union will become more attrac
tive to other retailers, and shop
ping and dining choices for stu
dents will increase as a result.
Regardless of which juice bar
company is finally selected, one
can only hope that the selection
process will be quick and that we
do not have a repeat of the Taco
Bell debacle.
And while any of the three
juice bars would be an improve
ment, there are good reasons to
favor Juice Club over the other
two contenders. First, its presen
tation to the Tresidder Advisory
Committee was the most detailed
of the three. The presentation
included three sketches of their
proposed floorplan, information
on expected store hours (they
plan to stay open until 11 p.m.
everyday) and an impressive
array of awards and reviews,
including "Best Juice Bar" in the
SF Weekly's 1996 "Best of San
Francisco" issue.
The rather slim proposal put
forward by Juice It! did an
admirable job introducing the life
stories of the two professional
tennis players who started the
company, but it was short on
details. Odwalla's proposal was
chock full of "Vision" but did not
come close to the comprehensive
Juice Club presentation. What's
more, many Odwalla drinks are
already available on campus. In
fact, Odwalla drinks are already
being sold in Tresidder and
Tresidder Express.
Juice Club is the only one of
the three that already has a loyal
and vocal student following. On
pure utility, Juice Club's selec
tion makes the most sense.
