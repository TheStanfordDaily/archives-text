Alumna remembers life and work of Burciaga

JOSE ANTONIO BURCIAGA died on
Monday. While many are recounting
the achievement of the artist, poet
and writer, I would like to remember the
educator. As someone now in the field of
education, I have often looked at several
people from my Stanford experience as
models of true educators.
Tony and Cecilia are truly a rare
breed in education: advocates for STU
DENTS. This may sound surprising to
some. But after all, isn't the focus of
education the students?
Still, amid politics, personal ambition
and the "rules of the game," doing what
is truly best for students often becomes
a low priority. Student voices are often
disregarded or merely incidental.
I lived in Casa Zapata my junior
year, 1993-94. It was to become Tony
and Cecilia's final year as resident fel
lows in Zapata. I was even recounting
Monday the strong feelings of love and
hate I have when looking back. My
memories of that tumultuous year in
Zapata are those of extreme fondness
and extreme pain.
The Chicano community, from the
beginning of the school year, was being
outwardly attacked. Our community
center, El Centro Chicano, was threat
ened. And our voices were seemingly
unheard by the administration. Cecilia
was systematically fired during spring
break. Then came spring quarter and

the infamous Flicks episode in which a
short film about the United Farm
Worker grape boycott was aired.
Students who saw pictures of
deformed children and families in pain
laughed. They chanted, "Go home, bean
ers." Like children imitating their par
ents, my peers felt that in the face of a
hostile administration that demonstrated
a complete lack of respect for the Chicano
community, their laughs and chants were
acceptable. And with no response from
the administration for several days, it
become obvious that such behavior was
acceptable at Stanford.
The Chicano community at Stanford
mobilized. Shortly before Cinco de
Mayo, a hunger strike was initiated by
students demanding an apology and
new position for Cecilia Burciaga, a
community center in East Palo Alto, a
campus-wide ban on grapes and a Chi
cano Studies program.
What moments of fondness can I
recall amid these memories? I have
memories of an extremely close dorm,
led by Tony and Cecilia, that truly was a
familia. While the outside oflen seemed
to attack much of what we held dear,
Zapata was a safe haven to learn about
and celebrate our community. Usually.
And, many times, it was Tony and
Cecilia who could be found at the front
lines fighting for Chicano / Latino stu
dents. It was their belief in what was

best and right for us and their willing
ness to express and fight for us that led
to their loss at Stanford.
I recall in spring 1994 (during the
time of the hunger strike) a campus
paper deliberately coming to our dorm
to distribute individually their latest
edition that contained vicious and hos
tile articles and commentaries pointed
directly at the Chicano community. We
knew what the paper contained; we had
already been forewarned. And one
weekday afternoon, when several of
their representatives came to our dorm
and began to slip their paper under
each door, they were met by Tony. He
began gathering up their papers. He
asked them to leave.
Soon, many of us went into the hall
ways and also began to gather the
copies. And I can vividly see Tony going
up our stairway and blocking it. He
refused to allow the representatives to
go up. Soon, much of our dorm gath
ered in the front lounge and demanded
that these people leave.
It was a prime example of both the
extreme and explicit disrespect directed at
the Chicano community and of Tony and
Cecilia's willingness to confront it directly.
There was no mere talk of the rights and
needs of students. They actively pursued
preserving and filling those needs.
Throughout their near-decade as RFs
in Casa Zapata, Tony and Cecilia helped

to create a space for Chicano students
where one could truly be a Chicano
Stanford student. They bridged the gap
between academia and cultura.
Tony graced Zapata's halls and din
ing space with murals that spoke of the
power and turmoil of our community
and our world. Tony and Cecilia intro
duced us to C6sar Chavez and Luis
Valdez. They enabled us to learn about
and celebrate our history as Mexican-
Americans through events such as Zoot
Suit Week in which we learned of the
lives and struggles of 1940s Chicanos.
So now, as I enter the world of educa
tion, I look to Tony and Cecilia as my
models. Their examples demonstrate
the need NOT to "play by the rules"
and not to accept the status quo when it
comes to the well-being of students.
They illustrate the importance of bridg
ing the gaps between home and school
for students. They show what it means
to find power, strength and dignity in
one's community, cultura and history.
They remain incredible examples of
advocates for students and contributed
to the success of countless students.
Their legacy is an inspiration.
To Cecilia, Tono and Rebecca, I offer
my sincerest condolences.
To Tony, I offer my deep sadness
and respect. Siempre en mi corazon.
