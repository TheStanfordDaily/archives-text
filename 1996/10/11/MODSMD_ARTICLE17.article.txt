## The 						choice: Bob or Bill 
### 
NEXT MONTH I vote for my first
president ever. Should I be excit
ed? A ballot choice between Bob
and Bill is like a TV that gets only The
Grand Ole Opry and, well, the music of
Roger Clinton. The two UHF stations
are programmed by Darth Nader and
that trophy-headed lunatic plutocrat
from Texas whose nutty simile-laden
rhetoric seems aimed at the Joad family,
after Jim Casey was long dead and Ma
lost the handle. Oh — the Libertarians.
My high school physics teacher was a
Libertarian. He wanted to build his own
missile silo.
I have a Clinton for president —
George Clinton. He runs on the Mother
ship ticket with Bootsie as veep. The slo
gan and platform: No Congress, Just
Parliament.
Most here seem happy with Clinton. I
wonder if it was his marijuana trouble
that won the collegiate vote. Or his
alleged draft-dodging. Neither one both
ers me, even if the only kind of pot Clin
ton didn't want to smoke was Pol Pot.
The washed-out lines of criticism bore
me. He likes McDonald's? So he has a
Big Mac. He is a skirt-chaser? So he is a
Big Mack. The face America puts on to
the world is already so Puritan that hav
ing a horndog as president can't help but
make us seem a more visceral and stinky
nation. Imagine going to France and
being accepted.
But just as ad hominem jabs at Clin
ton have grown stale over time, so have

attacks on other candidates. While we
are on the subject of things growing stale
over time, what about Bob Dole? Every
one complains that Dole is old. I have
nothing to add except this etymological
explanation — take away the "e" in
"Dole," rearrange the letters, and you
have "old." Add the "e," and you have
"olde"— not only the word itself, but the
old spelling. Other than being "Olde,"
Dole strikes me as being mean, because
of his stiffness. Perhaps it is rigor mor
tis, and the Republican campaign is a
political "Weekend at Bernie's."
I have other theories about Dole. One
stems from his spookiest rhetorical habit
— his penchant for referring to himself
in the third person: "Bob Dole knows it,
you know it, and the American people
know it." Why does he do that? Is he not
really Bob Dole? Someone should ask
him, "If you are not Bob Dole, then who
are you?" He might say, "I'm really
Keith Richards. Bob Dole lives with
William S. Burroughs in a remote
Kansas farmhouse. All they talk about is
typewriters."
Yes, I believe Bob Dole the person has
dissociated from Bob Dole the candidate.
He heard so many nasty rumors about
himself that he decided he didn't want to
be in Bob Dole's shoes anymore and
scuttled off like a hermit crab. I can't
blame him. If someone is running for
president today, then they must be
insane.
With all the mudslinging and absurdi

ty, it is no wonder that our candidate
pool is a psychopathological Dream
Team, and I blame this on the media
consumer plexus.
Not just the blue-haired, muumuu
clad trailer mamas who keep the Enquir
er and the Sun spewing, but whoever else
has such a pitiful life that they will pay to
hear the wisdom of Divine Brown. Who
blew Hugh? Tonight, on a special "Cur
rent Hard Inside Edition Copy Affair."
Even the "real" news is suspect — if
Ted Turner can colorize any of the clas
sic films he owns at his discretion, what
keeps him from "colorizing" the news?
The detritus that comes with news can
be sorted out, but only if you know it as
detritus. Least trustworthy of all is the
World Wide Wasteland, a labyrinth of
glitzy facades promising wealths of
information and leading instead to the
home page of an Intervert named Jethro
who has more fingers than teeth and
offers JPEGs of his girlfriend with farm
animals. I run from pages like this faster
than a date with Ricki Lake. In the end,
for lack of better information, I fear
many of us will vote the same way we
navigate the Web: Just point and click.
