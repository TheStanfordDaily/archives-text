A 8 one of the top point
guards in the nation,
Stanford basketball star
Brevin Knight has had many a
good pick set for him. The ques
tion now is: Can he make a few
good ones on his own?
Just in case the NBA (and its
accompanying six- or seven-fig
ure salary) gets a bit boring or
drab for this talented fella in the
future, Knight is looking to di
versify his skills now in sports
and perhaps eventually branch
off into the little-known but in
creasingly popular field of col
lege football prognosticating.
Today Knight puts down his
basketball and picks up his crys
tal ball, applying the foresight he
musters when predicting the
opening of a lane to the basket to
the college gridiron this week
end. I'll consider his excursion
into the unathletic side of athlet
ics a success if he can overcome
his biggest prognosticating
fears: getting stuffed and, heav
en forbid, making a "foul call."
Oregon at Stanford
These two struggling squads
fit together like a puzzle. Ore
gon's defense (the college foot
ball equivalent of the Liechten
stein National Guard) is ranked
106 th in the nation and just gave
up 591 yards to Arizona State
two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Stan
ford's offense is ranked 100 th
nationally and hasn't scored a
touchdown in 10 quarters; the
squad is planning a big party for
when the Cardinal gets its next
first down, and y'all are invited
to the festivities (if you're still
around next season).
And the compatibilities don't
stop there. Stanford's defense is
a finely tuned instrument this
year, and only Cardinal
turnovers and critical errors on
special teams have consistently
allowed opponents to put
points on the board.

At the same time, the Ducks
are ranked 18th in total offense
(453 yards per game), and most
of that is collected via the pass;
with more than 50 passes last
week, look for the pigskin to
spend more time in the air dur
ing this one game than the space
station Mir spent in space in the
past decade.
Brevin foresees the Cardinal
"breaking out of [its] slump" this
weekend. "We'll be at home; the
students are all here," he said.
"They'll be anxious for a win."
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, I doubt the cards will fall in
its favor this weekend. My guess
is that Oregon's offense will
break down the Stanford sec
ondary before the Cardinal man
ages to score its first touchdown
in three games. Having been
sacked six times in last week's
loss, Stanford quarterback Chad
Hutchinson played the entire
second half with a concussion
and didn't remember much of
the Washington game. That's
probably for the better. But let's
just hope that by the time he
clears his mind of the lingering
cobwebs he doesn't have visions
of Duck defensive linemen danc
ing in his head.

No. 16 Washington at No. 11
Notre Dame
Let me just quote one statistic
before moving on to the next
pick: The Irish haven't lost con
secutive games in South Bend
since Bob Dole first started wear
ing dentures. Folks, we're talk
ing decades here.
"UW looked a little shaky to
me when they played us," Brevin
said of Washington's 6-3 half
time deficit last weekend. "Notre
Dame is at home, and I think


Reagan
Demas


Brevin
Knight
they'll win big."
While I think the Huskies will
give Notre Dame reason to clutch
its four-leaf clover, in the end the
Irish will be sipping Guinness
and reveling in a victory that is
sure to make even the Pope
proud.

Miami
As long as the Seminoles don't
get sucked into the Hurricane
hype swirling around the Orange
Bowl this weekend, they seem to
have the edge in this battle of
Sunshine State powerhouses.
Brevin agrees. "Miami just

isn't dominating this year like in
years past," he said.
But a closer look at the evi
dence details a much more com
plicated story. Miami has won 11
straight football games dating
back to its loss to Florida last
year. In addition, the Hurricanes
will stack up the No. 1 defense in
the country to thwart Bobby
Bowden's bruisers.
Conclusion: Hurricanes blow
the Seminoles right out of town.
I'm probably going to regret this,
but after being outpicked by a
penny last week, how can I do
wrong by going against my intu
ition?

Arizona at USC
I don't see how the Trojans
can show their faces in public
again after last week's embar

rassing drubbing at the hands of
Cal. But John Robinson's squad
will return, albeit with egos the
size of Billy Graham's Playboy
collection.
"USC's not going to lose two
in a row at home," Brevin said.
"Robinson will have them ready
to play."
Indubitably. While the Trojans
let quarterback Brad Otton get
sacked six times last week and
could hardly cross the midfield
stripe on offense, look for the
Wildcats to be neutered this week
end by a rejuvenated USC squad.

"OSU just can't win," Brevin
said. "No way."
Can anybody tell me why they
still have a football program in

Corvallis? I say they shut down
the gridiron office, convert the
football stadium into an eques
trian field and donate the weight
room, pads, gear and water bot
tles to the Beaver pick-up sticks
club.
In the meantime, if you're
planning on attending the Ore
gon State game this weekend,
bring a good book. Check that —
bring a word processor and write
your own good book. You'll have
plenty of peace and quiet and ab
solutely no distractions on the
football field.

rassing drubbing at the hands of
Cal. But John Robinson's squad
will return, albeit with egos the
size of Billy Graham's Playboy
collection.
"USC's not going to lose two
in a row at home," Brevin said.
"Robinson will have them ready
to play."
Indubitably. While the Trojans
let quarterback Brad Otton get
sacked six times last week and
could hardly cross the midfield
stripe on offense, look for the
Wildcats to be neutered this week
end by a rejuvenated USC squad.

"OSU just can't win," Brevin
said. "No way."
Can anybody tell me why they
still have a football program in

Corvallis? I say they shut down
the gridiron office, convert the
football stadium into an eques
trian field and donate the weight
room, pads, gear and water bot
tles to the Beaver pick-up sticks
club.
In the meantime, if you're
planning on attending the Ore

bring a good book. Check that —
bring a word processor and write
your own good book. You'll have
plenty of peace and quiet and ab
solutely no distractions on the

A 8 one of the top point
guards in the nation,
Stanford basketball star
Brevin Knight has had many a
good pick set for him. The ques
tion now is: Can he make a few
good ones on his own?
Just in case the NBA (and its
accompanying six- or seven-fig
ure salary) gets a bit boring or
drab for this talented fella in the
future, Knight is looking to di
versify his skills now in sports
and perhaps eventually branch
off into the little-known but in
creasingly popular field of col
lege football prognosticating.
Today Knight puts down his
basketball and picks up his crys
tal ball, applying the foresight he
musters when predicting the
opening of a lane to the basket to
the college gridiron this week
end. I'll consider his excursion
into the unathletic side of athlet
ics a success if he can overcome
his biggest prognosticating
fears: getting stuffed and, heav
en forbid, making a "foul call."
Oregon at Stanford
These two struggling squads
fit together like a puzzle. Ore
gon's defense (the college foot
ball equivalent of the Liechten
stein National Guard) is ranked
106 th in the nation and just gave
up 591 yards to Arizona State
two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Stan
ford's offense is ranked 100 th
nationally and hasn't scored a
touchdown in 10 quarters; the
squad is planning a big party for
when the Cardinal gets its next
first down, and y'all are invited
to the festivities (if you're still
around next season).
And the compatibilities don't
stop there. Stanford's defense is
a finely tuned instrument this
year, and only Cardinal
turnovers and critical errors on
special teams have consistently
allowed opponents to put
points on the board.

At the same time, the Ducks
are ranked 18th in total offense
(453 yards per game), and most
of that is collected via the pass;
with more than 50 passes last
week, look for the pigskin to
spend more time in the air dur
ing this one game than the space
station Mir spent in space in the
past decade.
Brevin foresees the Cardinal
"breaking out of [its] slump" this
weekend. "We'll be at home; the
students are all here," he said.
"They'll be anxious for a win."
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, I doubt the cards will fall in
its favor this weekend. My guess
is that Oregon's offense will
break down the Stanford sec
ondary before the Cardinal man
ages to score its first touchdown
in three games. Having been
sacked six times in last week's
loss, Stanford quarterback Chad
Hutchinson played the entire
second half with a concussion
and didn't remember much of
the Washington game. That's
probably for the better. But let's
just hope that by the time he
clears his mind of the lingering
cobwebs he doesn't have visions
of Duck defensive linemen danc
ing in his head.

No. 16 Washington at No. 11
Notre Dame
Let me just quote one statistic
before moving on to the next
pick: The Irish haven't lost con
secutive games in South Bend
since Bob Dole first started wear
ing dentures. Folks, we're talk
ing decades here.
"UW looked a little shaky to
me when they played us," Brevin
said of Washington's 6-3 half
time deficit last weekend. "Notre
Dame is at home, and I think


Reagan
Demas


Brevin
Knight
they'll win big."
While I think the Huskies will
give Notre Dame reason to clutch
its four-leaf clover, in the end the
Irish will be sipping Guinness
and reveling in a victory that is
sure to make even the Pope
proud.

No. 3 Florida State at No. 6
Miami
As long as the Seminoles don't
get sucked into the Hurricane
hype swirling around the Orange
Bowl this weekend, they seem to
have the edge in this battle of
Sunshine State powerhouses.
Brevin agrees. "Miami just

isn't dominating this year like in
years past," he said.
But a closer look at the evi
dence details a much more com
plicated story. Miami has won 11
straight football games dating
back to its loss to Florida last
year. In addition, the Hurricanes
will stack up the No. 1 defense in
the country to thwart Bobby
Bowden's bruisers.
Conclusion: Hurricanes blow
the Seminoles right out of town.
I'm probably going to regret this,
but after being outpicked by a
penny last week, how can I do
wrong by going against my intu
ition?
