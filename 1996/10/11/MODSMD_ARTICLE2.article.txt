From Memorial Auditorium to the Quad and from
the Row houses to Roble, people were forced to im

the restoration of power to the campus.
Students felt the effects of the outage in many

Both Green and Meyer libraries, as well as the
Bookstore, closed early. According to Martin, the de

after the outage, which began at 7:26 p.m.
Not even the power outage could close the 24-hour
study room in Meyer, however.
The outage also coincided with the first day of this
