# Thousands affected as buildings are emptied
## 
### Kristie Smith Staff writer 
From Memorial Auditorium to the Quad and from
the Row houses to Roble, people were forced to im
provise in the darkness last night as they waited for
the restoration of power to the campus.
Students felt the effects of the outage in many
ways.
"The only light we had was from a Powerbook
screen," said sophomore Francisco Najera, who was
attending a Latino leadership Opportunities meet
ing held in Cypress Hall. "We found all sorts of earth
quake kits, [which contained] food for weeks but ab
solutely no flashlights."
For some students on campus, missing the Thurs
day night "Must-See-TV" lineup was the main con
cern.
Senior Chris Hyder, house manager of 353 Cam
pus Drive, was setting up his VCR to record
"Friends" at the time of the outage. "I'll probably
miss it now," he said, "[which] is a complete bum
ft
mer.
In Adams House in Sterling Quad, not even a
power outage could stop people from watching
"Friends," as some residents huddled around a small,
battery-operated television in the hall.
Other students treated the outage as an emer
gency. In Lagunita Court, residents evacuated the
building on a resident fellow's suggestion.
"We headed out because it was dark," said junior
Jeremy Sugarman, the resident computer coordina
tor in West Lagunita.
Students at the libraries also ran into some trou
ble because of the power loss. At Meyer, the outage
caused a number of minor problems with the videos
in the multimedia center and with discharging books,
said Ben Martin, Meyer's evening supervisor.
Both Green and Meyer libraries, as well as the
Bookstore, closed early. According to Martin, the de
cision to close the libraries came about half an hour
after the outage, which began at 7:26 p.m.
Not even the power outage could close the 24-hour
study room in Meyer, however.
The outage also coincided with the first day of this
year's Reunion Homecoming
Weekend — wreaking havoc on al
most every Homecoming event
scheduled last night.
According to Jeannie Meyer,
the associate director of donor re
lations in the Office of Develop
ment, the outage prevented Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
from speaking at the alumni din
ner, which was held in the Quad.
In order to ensure alumni had
enough light to maneuver
throughout the evening, the cen
terpiece candles were moved from
the tables onto the walkways, said
Meyer. The organizers of the
event also obtained a generator,
which provided some light for the
occasion.
"Thank goodness the crowd
wasn't crazy or hostile," said
Alumni Association President Bill
Stone. "It's just been a bizarre
night, but I'm sure we'll get to
hear President Casper's speech
and my old jokes some other
time."
The alumni didn't seem to
mind the circumstances. "We had
an opportunity to have long talks
with friends and people we
haven't seen in a long time," said
Young Boozer, Class of'7l.
At Memorial Auditorium, a
sold-out crowd of about 1,700 peo
ple was sent home because of the
power outage. The Capitol Steps, a

Washington, D.C.-based comedy
group specializing in political
humor, was scheduled to perform
at 8:30 p.m.
According to Events Services
Director Lois Wagner, she re
ceived word from Casper around
8:15 p.m. that the performance
would need to be rescheduled —
although the auditorium has
emergency lighting support for up
to 12 hours.
Kay Ritchey, the house manag
er for Stanford Lively Arts, said
the performers were ready to go
on anyway. "They had even incor
porated the blackout into their
routine," she said.
Capitol Steps Director Bill
Strauss said he understood the sit
uation. Even if the group went on,
there would always be the risk that
the emergency power would fail.
"The whole audience would
have been in the dark then," he
said. They would have also had to
perform without stage lights or
microphones.
In its 15-year history, the
troupe has only had two perfor
mances canceled. The first be
cause of a 2-foot blizzard in Wash
ington, D.C., and the second be
cause of the Los Angeles riots,
Strauss said.
Fortunately, Wagner was able
to secure the facility at a time
when the group could reschedule
— next Wednesday evening.
In Tresidder Union, a group of
children from the Cardinal Kids
Camp had stopped for dessert.
The camp is for children of alumni

participating in reunion activities.
The kids were not upset by the
darkness in Tresidder. "We feel
fine; it's cool," said Fernando
Sanchez, one of the camp partici
pants.
Richard Calbow, director of re
tail operations for Bon Appetit,
was not concerned about the out
age itself — only how long it would
last. The refrigerator units at
Tresidder do not have generator
backups, but Calbow said he did
not expect a problem as long as the
doors of the refrigerator stayed
shut and the power resumed.
The retail operations in Tresid
der all closed down early as a re
sult of the outage.
One person unaffected by the
power failure was Joe Jonah Eu
clid. The bearded man who fre
quents the campus continued
pecking away on his manual type
writer outside Tresidder, seem
ingly oblivious to the chaos the
outage had caused to the techno
logically dependent.
The outage was caused by a
switch gear failure at Central En
ergy Facility, but some had theo
ries of their own.
"Well, my theory is that the
true zero-degree helium backed
up from the physics lab and some
how got mixed up with our corn
soup and somehow created this
problem," Stone said.
