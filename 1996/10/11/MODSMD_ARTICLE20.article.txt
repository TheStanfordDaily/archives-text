# Something must give for football
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Last season, the Stanford Car
dinal and the defending Pacific 10
Conference champion Oregon
Ducks met in Eugene for a clash of
unbeaten teams.
At 2 p.m. tomorrow in Stanford
Stadium, the Cardinal and the
Ducks meet again under quite dif
ferent circumstances as both Stan
ford (1-3 overall, 0-1 Pac-10) and
Oregon (3-3, 0-3) seek their first
conference victories in order to
turn their young seasons in a posi
tive direction.
After two losses on the road to
Wisconsin and Washington, the
Cardinal prepares for its Home
coming showdown looking to
break an even more dubious statis
tic: 10 consecutive quarters with
out a touchdown.
Despite the offensive woes,
Stanford head coach Tyrone Will
ingham and the Cardinal remain
upbeat.
"I think the morale is very posi
tive," Willingham said. "I think
our football team sees an opportu
nity to accomplish the things we
want to accomplish."
The Stanford offensive drought
was not relieved in its two field
goal performance against the
Huskies. Senior fullback Adam
Salina's second-quarter touch
down against San Jose State
marks the last time the Cardinal
reached pay dirt.
While the Stanford offensive
line has caught much of the criti
cism for the lack of a rushing at
tack, Willingham dismissed that
the offense is failing due to the in
experienced line.
"The problem is never all one
particular group," Willingham
said of the offense. "It would be
nice to package this as just an of
fensive line problem. We think
that there are some growing pains
on the offensive line.
"But at the same time, if you are
a back, you are asked to gain
yardage. You are supposed to gain
yardage when there is no one
blocking, and you are supposed to
gain more when there is. All of it

has contributed to a lack of execu
tion on our part, not being as effi
cient as we would like to be."
There were strides last week for
the Cardinal offensive unit as red
shirt freshman quarterback Chad
Hutchinson and company man
aged 189 total yards in the first
half against a tough Washington
defense. Yet with just two Kevin
Miller field goals and 47 total yards
in the second half, Stanford still
has not clicked offensively.
"I think we're doing all right,"
said senior right guard Brad Bad
ger. "We took the No. 18 team in
the country down the field on 93-
yard drives twice. That just shows
that we have the ability. We just
have to sustain it for 60 minutes."
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
what Oregon brings to the table
defensively is no more impressive
than what the Stanford offense
has shown thus far. Due to inexpe
rience and a number of injuries to
key defensive players, the Duck de
fense, tabbed Gang Green in their
Rose Bowl season two years ago, is
looking more like Swiss cheese.
While the Cardinal ranks last in
the Pac-10 in points scored, the
Ducks are dead last as well in three
major defensive categories —
rushing defense, passing defense
and appropriately, total defense.
Something will give on Saturday;
either the Cardinal will better its
10.3 points per game average or
Oregon will better its 38.2 points
allowed average.
"We are very young on defense,
and we knew that coming into the
season," Oregon head coach Mike
Bellotti said. "Unfortunately, that
problem has been compounded by
some injuries, and we have per
formed very poorly."
Once again, the Cardinal will be
looking to restore its rushing at
tack, which is mysteriously
putting up only 77.3 yards per
game, last in the conference. The
Oregon defense conveniently
yields more than 212 rushing
yards per game, also last in the
conference.
"We haven't mounted much of

a running attack yet," Willingham
said. "So I don't think I can say that
we are going to come out and run
the ball down their throat. I'm not
interested in trying to run the ball.
I am interesting in succeeding."
While the Stanford offense and
Oregon defense look to get on
track, there will be a serious battle
on the other side of the ball as
well.
Just as the Stanford defense has
been showered with praise as it
shares the lead in the Pac-10 in
points allowed with USC, the Ore
gon offense has also been spectacu
lar.
The Ducks have averaged more
than 33 points per game under sec
ond-string quarterback Ryan
Perry-Smith. He has been filling in
for starter Tony Graziani, who has
been sidelined by a knee injury.
Despite the fact that Perry-
Smith and the Ducks rank first in
passing offense and efficiency,
Graziani will get the nod if healthy
and the Cardinal squad must be up

for the challenge.
"I think both of their quarter
backs are very good," Willingham
said. "I think they play very well
and they run their system well."
After shutting down Wiscon
sin's vaunted ground game, the
Cardinal took a step backward
last week against Corey Dillon
(who rushed for 175 yards) and
the Washington running game.
Yet Oregon has not been nearly
as successful moving the ball on
the ground as it has through the
air.
"We have been very pass orient
ed, maybe too much so," Bellotti
said. "We're putting up great num
bers in terms of yardage, and we're
scoring a lot of points. But I don't
know if we've been as efficient as
we need to be."
Injuries to tailbacks Saladin Mc-
Cullough (knee), Jerry Brown
(hand) and David Crump have se
verely limited the Ducks in the
backfield.
Coming off two straight bowl ap
pearances, the Ducks opened the
year with three nonconference
wins before dropping Pac-10 con
tests to Washington State, Arizona
State and UCLA.

Salina's second-quarter touch
down against San Jose State
marks the last time the Cardinal
reached pay dirt.
While the Stanford offensive
line has caught much of the criti
cism for the lack of a rushing at
tack, Willingham dismissed that
the offense is failing due to the in
experienced line.
"The problem is never all one
particular group," Willingham
said of the offense. "It would be
nice to package this as just an of
fensive line problem. We think
that there are some growing pains
on the offensive line.
"But at the same time, if you are
a back, you are asked to gain
yardage. You are supposed to gain
yardage when there is no one
blocking, and you are supposed to
gain more when there is. All of it

has contributed to a lack of execu
tion on our part, not being as effi
cient as we would like to be."
There were strides last week for
the Cardinal offensive unit as red
shirt freshman quarterback Chad
Hutchinson and company man
aged 189 total yards in the first
half against a tough Washington
defense. Yet with just two Kevin
Miller field goals and 47 total yards
in the second half, Stanford still
has not clicked offensively.
"I think we're doing all right,"
said senior right guard Brad Bad
ger. "We took the No. 18 team in
the country down the field on 93-
yard drives twice. That just shows
that we have the ability. We just
have to sustain it for 60 minutes."
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
what Oregon brings to the table
defensively is no more impressive
than what the Stanford offense
has shown thus far. Due to inexpe
rience and a number of injuries to
key defensive players, the Duck de
fense, tabbed Gang Green in their
Rose Bowl season two years ago, is
looking more like Swiss cheese.
While the Cardinal ranks last in
the Pac-10 in points scored, the
Ducks are dead last as well in three
major defensive categories —
rushing defense, passing defense
and appropriately, total defense.
Something will give on Saturday;
either the Cardinal will better its
10.3 points per game average or
Oregon will better its 38.2 points
allowed average.
"We are very young on defense,
and we knew that coming into the
season," Oregon head coach Mike
Bellotti said. "Unfortunately, that
problem has been compounded by
some injuries, and we have per
formed very poorly."
Once again, the Cardinal will be
looking to restore its rushing at
tack, which is mysteriously
putting up only 77.3 yards per
game, last in the conference. The
Oregon defense conveniently
yields more than 212 rushing
yards per game, also last in the
conference.
"We haven't mounted much of

a running attack yet," Willingham
said. "So I don't think I can say that
we are going to come out and run
the ball down their throat. I'm not
interested in trying to run the ball.
I am interesting in succeeding."
While the Stanford offense and
Oregon defense look to get on
track, there will be a serious battle
on the other side of the ball as
well.
Just as the Stanford defense has
been showered with praise as it
shares the lead in the Pac-10 in
points allowed with USC, the Ore
gon offense has also been spectacu
lar.
The Ducks have averaged more
than 33 points per game under sec
ond-string quarterback Ryan
Perry-Smith. He has been filling in
for starter Tony Graziani, who has
been sidelined by a knee injury.
Despite the fact that Perry-
Smith and the Ducks rank first in
passing offense and efficiency,
Graziani will get the nod if healthy
and the Cardinal squad must be up

for the challenge.
"I think both of their quarter
backs are very good," Willingham
said. "I think they play very well
and they run their system well."
After shutting down Wiscon
sin's vaunted ground game, the
Cardinal took a step backward
last week against Corey Dillon
(who rushed for 175 yards) and
the Washington running game.
Yet Oregon has not been nearly
as successful moving the ball on
the ground as it has through the
air.
"We have been very pass orient
ed, maybe too much so," Bellotti
said. "We're putting up great num
bers in terms of yardage, and we're
scoring a lot of points. But I don't
know if we've been as efficient as
we need to be."
Injuries to tailbacks Saladin Mc-
Cullough (knee), Jerry Brown
(hand) and David Crump have se
verely limited the Ducks in the
backfield.
Coming off two straight bowl ap
pearances, the Ducks opened the
year with three nonconference
wins before dropping Pac-10 con
tests to Washington State, Arizona
State and UCLA.
