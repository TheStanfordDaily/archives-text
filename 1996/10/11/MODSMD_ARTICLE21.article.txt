# NorCal tourney caps big weekend
## Water polo greets UC-Santa Barbara today for starters 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
With a 3 p.m. conference game
against UC-Santa Barbara today at
deGuerre Pool and the Northern Califor
nia Tournament in Stockton tomorrow
and Sunday, the Stanford men's water
polo team is looking to come up big.
UCSB, winless in the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation (0-9), will likely pro
vide little challenge to the Cardinal, who
is ranked No. 5 with only two losses this
season. Nonetheless, it provides an ex

cellent opportunity for the team to get
game experience before the tournament
begins tomorrow.
"It's a league game, so it counts to
ward our seeding," head coach Dante
Dettamanti said. "But the biggest thing
for us is the tournament."
Indeed it is. The tournament brings
together the top 10 teams in the country,
and only two of the top 16 squads will not
be present. In its second game of the
tournament Stanford will face either No.
10 UC-San Diego or No. 4 UC-Irvine.
The Anteaters handed the Cardinal its

lone loss earlier this season.
"We're really looking forward to play
ing Irvine," said sophomore forward Je
remiah Robison. "We feel that we've
made some big steps since our last game
against them."
In the two games against the Cardinal
thus far in 1996, the Anteaters have
taken advantage of their excellent offen
sive balance and large size to exploit
weaknesses in the Stanford defense.
In David Bailey and Craig Watson,
Irvine has an offensive duo that's
tough to stop. At 6-foot-5, Bailey is
a powerful holeman who is the
team's biggest scorer and has the
ability to score despite good defen
sive coverage. Watson, who is also
6-5, has a very accurate long-range
shot, making it difficult for the de
fense to help out inside on Bailey.
"They killed us on two-point
shots," Dettamanti said. "Our de
fenders need to do a better job mov
ing in and out on defense, and we
need a good performance from our
goalie."
"We need to stop their big scor
ers, Bailey in particular," Robison
said. "He really made us pay for our
mistakes on defense."
The game also represents a turn
ing point in the season for the Car
dinal. If Stanford plays UC-Irvine
tomorrow and comes away with a
win, it will likely go up against two

of the top three teams in the coun
try on Sunday, giving Stanford a
shot at moving up in the rankings.
Given the importance of the
game, the team has been training
especially hard and will arrive in
Stockton in top condition.
"Last week we practiced really
hard," Robison said. "Now we're fo
cusing on the kind of defense that
[the Anteaters 1 play and working to
improve our own."
"It's time to find out where we
really are," Dettamanti said.
"We're due now, and we're ready to
play these teams."
The Stanford squad goes into
battle confident it can win and en
ters the tourney with all of its play
ers healthy, whereas the previous
two times Stanford and UC-Irvine
met, the Cardinal was without se
nior holeman Bryce Matthews.
"I think that we'll do very well
against them," Robison said.
"We're going to be able to do a lot of
good things both on offense and de
fense that we weren't really pre
pared to do earlier in the season."
