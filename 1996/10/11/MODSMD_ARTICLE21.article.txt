## Water polo greets UC-Santa Barbara today for starters 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
With a 3 p.m. conference game
against UC-Santa Barbara today at
deGuerre Pool and the Northern Califor
nia Tournament in Stockton tomorrow
and Sunday, the Stanford men's water
polo team is looking to come up big.
UCSB, winless in the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation (0-9), will likely pro
vide little challenge to the Cardinal, who
is ranked No. 5 with only two losses this
season. Nonetheless, it provides an ex

cellent opportunity for the team to get
game experience before the tournament
begins tomorrow.
"It's a league game, so it counts to
ward our seeding," head coach Dante
Dettamanti said. "But the biggest thing
for us is the tournament."
Indeed it is. The tournament brings
together the top 10 teams in the country,
and only two of the top 16 squads will not
be present. In its second game of the
tournament Stanford will face either No.
10 UC-San Diego or No. 4 UC-Irvine.
The Anteaters handed the Cardinal its

lone loss earlier this season.
"We're really looking forward to play
ing Irvine," said sophomore forward Je
remiah Robison. "We feel that we've
made some big steps since our last game
against them."
In the two games against the Cardinal
thus far in 1996, the Anteaters have
taken advantage of their excellent offen
sive balance and large size to exploit
weaknesses in the Stanford defense.
