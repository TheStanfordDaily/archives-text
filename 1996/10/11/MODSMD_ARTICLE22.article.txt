# Beavers, Ducks hope to deflate volleyball
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team (12-1,5-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) takes its high octane of
fense on the road this weekend to
face Oregon State (13-3, 3-3) and
Oregon (6-10, 0-6) for two impor
tant conference matches.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal will
have its hands full with No. 21 Ore
gon State tonight at 7 p.m. The
Beaver 3 began the season 13-1 be
fore falling to Washington State
and Washington last weekend, but
have earned themselves a place
among the nation's elite teams.
Oregon State worked extremely
hard during the offseason in an at
tempt to make this a memorable
year, and the combination of dedi
cation and an experienced team has
paid dividends.
"They are playing very well,"
Stanford coach Don Shaw said.
"They are strong all the way
around. It will be a tough match for
us."
The Cardinal has owned the
Beavers throughout the history of
the two programs, winning all 22
matches they have played. Last
season, Oregon State failed to win a
single game against Stanford.
"If we are playing well and if we
are fired up, we should do pretty
well," junior outside hitter Kristin
Folkl said.
The Card will probably have its
starting setter Lisa Sharpley back
for tonight's game in Corvallis.

Senior middle blocker Eileen Murfee bumps a strong one in the grueling California
match last Friday.
Sharpley missed both last Fri
day's match against California
and Saturday's exhibition match
against the Olympic Team with a
sprained ankle that she suffered
in practice.
"I was really looking forward to
playing against [the Olympians],"
Sharpley said. "I was kind of dis
appointed."
Shaw said Sharpley is probable
for tonight's match but will most
likely not play against Oregon to
morrow evening.
Stanford will probably play se
nior co-captain Catherine Juillard
at setter, but Shaw does not ex
pect its quality of play to suffer be
cause of it.
"Catherine has been going
hard since the first day she got to
campus," Shaw said. "She is doing
a fine job out there."
The Ducks have struggled as of
late, particularly against confer
ence opponents. Oregon suffered
two blowout losses to both the
Huskies and Cougars last week

end.
Although Oregon has yet to de
feat a Pac-10 opponent this sea
son, the last team without a con
ference victory that Stanford
played nearly beat the Cardinal.
Last Friday California came
into Maples Pavilion and forced
the match to the wire, eventually
falling to the Card 18-16 in the de
cisive fifth game. Nobody at Stan
ford will be looking past the
Ducks.
"Everybody you play is capable
of beating you," Shaw said. "They
will come out fired up. There are
no gimmies on this schedule."
The Ducks have had some
problems off the court as well.
Some of Oregon's starters were
suspended for last week's match
es for selling equipment they had
received, but those players will
play against Stanford tomorrow
night.
Oregon coach Cathy Nelson
has shown some brazen boldness
about her team's chances against
the Card.
"If Cal can force Stanford to
five games, anyone can," Nelson
said.
