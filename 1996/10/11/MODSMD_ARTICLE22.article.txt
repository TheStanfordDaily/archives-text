### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team (12-1,5-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) takes its high octane of
fense on the road this weekend to
face Oregon State (13-3, 3-3) and
Oregon (6-10, 0-6) for two impor
tant conference matches.
The fourth-ranked Cardinal will
have its hands full with No. 21 Ore
gon State tonight at 7 p.m. The
Beaver 3 began the season 13-1 be
fore falling to Washington State
and Washington last weekend, but
have earned themselves a place
among the nation's elite teams.
Oregon State worked extremely
hard during the offseason in an at
tempt to make this a memorable
year, and the combination of dedi
cation and an experienced team has
paid dividends.
"They are playing very well,"
Stanford coach Don Shaw said.
"They are strong all the way
around. It will be a tough match for
us."
The Cardinal has owned the
Beavers throughout the history of
the two programs, winning all 22
matches they have played. Last
season, Oregon State failed to win a
single game against Stanford.
"If we are playing well and if we
are fired up, we should do pretty
well," junior outside hitter Kristin
Folkl said.
The Card will probably have its
starting setter Lisa Sharpley back
for tonight's game in Corvallis.
