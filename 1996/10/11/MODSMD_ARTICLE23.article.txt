# Friars next big test for field hockey in Berkeley
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The Stanford field hockey team (6-1),
riding on top of the Northern Pacific Con
ference pack with six straight wins, will
play two out-of-region schools this week
end at California.
The Cardinal will play Simon Fraser
University of Canada tomorrow at 9 a.m.
and Providence (3-6, 2-2 Big East Confer
ence) on Sunday at noon.
Although the Stanford squad has de
feated one team after another since the
start of the season, the Cardinal is pre
pared for a tough game against Provi
dence.
The Providence squad, consisting
mainly of veteran players, has defeated
tough Big East teams including Rutgers
and Villanova.
"If we knock Providence down, we
would take their place, ranking just in the
outskirts of the top 20," said senior tri
captain Baochi Nguyen. "In order to beat
Providence, we need to play our game and
play it neatly. We need good crisp passes,
and we need to take lots of shots [on
goal]."
A victory over the Friars would further
accelerate the Cardinal joyride and be a
big confidence booster in the upcoming
matches against other skillful East Coast
teams such as James Madison and Amer

ican.
After enduring a week of mid-day prac
tices with temperatures climbing as high
as 100 degrees, Stanford is ready to take
on the challenges of the weekend.
"We scrimmaged a lot and worked on
things we needed to work on, like passing
stick to stick and changing directions,"
said freshman star Mallory Chambers.
"I have no idea how these teams are,
but I think our team is good enough that
no team is just going to kill us," Cham
bers said. "Practices are going great and
the coach has been pleased with the way
we've been playing. We can definitely
hold our own."
According to coach Sheryl Johnson,
there are no special strategies planned for
the challenging match.
"We usually stick to our own game and
make adjustments throughout the
game," Johnson said. "If we can beat
Providence, it will be really good [for the
team]."
After its match against Simon Fraser,
the Cardinal will have a chance to observe
the Providence players when California
challenges the Friars. Stanford tri
umphed over Cal when the Golden Bears
visited Stanford two weeks ago.
The Simon Fraser match "will be a
good warm-up game," Nguyen said. "It'll
be a good workout, [but 1 we're aiming to
beat Providence."
