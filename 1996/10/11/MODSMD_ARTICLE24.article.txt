# Hau concert set for Saturday

### Martin L. Yeung Staff writer 
William Shakespeare once wrote
"some men are born great, others
achieve greatness, and still others
have greatness thrust upon them."
For Heidi Hau, greatness took
on all the above forms. Hau, a ju
nior Engish major, is one of the
finest concert pianists in the world.
Having played everywhere from
Carnegie Hall to the conservatories
of France and Russia, she seems
comfortable with the lifestyle.
" I've been playing the piano since
I was 4," said Hau. "My two older
brothers played, and it seemed like a
logical next step for me."
But while her brothers played
the piano well, touring Asia when
they were in high school, Hau
demonstrated an amazing talent
for the instrument at an early age.
She gave her first solo recital when
she was only 10 years old and won
honors at the Soviet-American
Youth Festival before graduating
from high school.

Hau puts in three hours of prac
tice per day, often more on week
ends. In terms of time spent, she
compares herself to an athlete.
"I have friends in sports, and like
them, I need to practice constantly
and exercise physically," said Hau.
"I need to have my body in good
shape in terms of endurance, espe
cially if I'm preparing to play an ad
vanced work."
Endurance was key during a
two-week festival this July at the
French Piano Institute, where Hau
gave a series of performances rang
ing from solo recitals to master
classes. In master classes, the play
er is critiqued by a music professor
in front of an audience.
"The festival is headed by major
professors from the Paris Conser
vatory. We had to send in tapes, and
they chose only 18 out of hun
dreds," Hau said.
All this culminated in a final
competition and the awarding of le
premier prix, or the grand prize to
Hau. In addition to getting an all-ex
penses-paid trip back to Paris, Hau

will have the honor of giving a solo
recital in the Salle Cortot, one of the
best-known concert halls in France.
Touring and traveling abroad is
one of the greatest benefits of being
a concert pianist, said Hau.
"J'adore Pans," she said. "I re
ally love how the French are able to
live and enjoy life much more than
people here in America where
everyone seems to focus on compet
ing against each other."
Hau is often asked why she
chose Stanford over schools with
more renowned music programs
like Yale or Barnard. The some
what laid-back lifestyle of the area
was one of the reasons Hau chose to
attend Stanford, along with the
University's academic reputation.
"I wanted to go to a school where
I would benefit not only from music
but also from classes that would
complement the English mayor I
wanted to pursue," Hau said.

Heidi Hau will give a free concert cu
Campell Recital Hall in Braun
Music Center tomorrow at 2:30p.m
