## CSRE awaiting approval

The Comparative Stud
ies in Race and Ethnicity
Program could start offer
ing classes at Stanford as
early as next quarter if ap
proved by the Faculty Sen
ate.
Dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences John
Shoven approved a proposal
for the program at the end

of Inst spring, according to History Prof. A 1
Camarillo, chair of the CSRE steering com
mittee.
The proposal has been sent to the sen
ate's Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
which plans to act on it at an Oct. 23 meet
ing. The full senate will review the proposal
Dec. 5, if it's approved by the committee.
"I'm delighted with the progress we've
made," said Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ram6n Saldivar. "Anytime you
start a program from scratch, you're taking
on a huge project. It's not surprising that it's
taken a year and a half to get it going."
The proposal outlines four new majors
under the CSRE program: Asian American
Studies, Chicano / Latino Studies, Native
American Studies and comparative ethnic

studies. Each of the first three majors has a
comparative studies component. The pro
posal also contains all the criteria for corre
sponding minors.
The comparative studies major focuses
on cross-ethnic perspectives and allows
more flexibility for students who don't nec
essarily want to focus too much on study of a
single ethnicity, Saldivar said. This feature
makes the CSRE program "really innovative
and cutting-edge," he added.
The CSRE proposal also offers a new op
tion for students majoring in African and
Afro-American Studies. They may opt to
conduct their studies within a comparative
context under CSRE or stay within the tra
ditional route of completing the major.
Assoc. History Prof. Gordon Chang, a
CSRE steering committee member, said he
expects five to 10 new courses to be offered
during the next two years if the program is
approved. They will be taught by existing
faculty.
CSRE will have two new assistant profes
sors by next fall, according to Saldivar. A
Chicano / Latino studies scholar will be
hired through the Anthropology Depart
ment. Carolyn Wong, an Asian American
studies scholar hired last spring, will begin
teaching in January.
