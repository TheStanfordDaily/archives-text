# Next quarter?
## CSRE awaiting approval

The Comparative Stud
ies in Race and Ethnicity
Program could start offer
ing classes at Stanford as
early as next quarter if ap
proved by the Faculty Sen
ate.
Dean of the School of Hu
manities and Sciences John
Shoven approved a proposal
for the program at the end

of Inst spring, according to History Prof. A 1
Camarillo, chair of the CSRE steering com
mittee.
The proposal has been sent to the sen
ate's Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
which plans to act on it at an Oct. 23 meet
ing. The full senate will review the proposal
Dec. 5, if it's approved by the committee.
"I'm delighted with the progress we've
made," said Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ram6n Saldivar. "Anytime you
start a program from scratch, you're taking
on a huge project. It's not surprising that it's
taken a year and a half to get it going."
The proposal outlines four new majors
under the CSRE program: Asian American
Studies, Chicano / Latino Studies, Native
American Studies and comparative ethnic

studies. Each of the first three majors has a
comparative studies component. The pro
posal also contains all the criteria for corre
sponding minors.
The comparative studies major focuses
on cross-ethnic perspectives and allows
more flexibility for students who don't nec
essarily want to focus too much on study of a
single ethnicity, Saldivar said. This feature
makes the CSRE program "really innovative
and cutting-edge," he added.
The CSRE proposal also offers a new op
tion for students majoring in African and
Afro-American Studies. They may opt to
conduct their studies within a comparative
context under CSRE or stay within the tra
ditional route of completing the major.
Assoc. History Prof. Gordon Chang, a
CSRE steering committee member, said he
expects five to 10 new courses to be offered
during the next two years if the program is
approved. They will be taught by existing
faculty.
CSRE will have two new assistant profes
sors by next fall, according to Saldivar. A
Chicano / Latino studies scholar will be
hired through the Anthropology Depart
ment. Carolyn Wong, an Asian American
studies scholar hired last spring, will begin
teaching in January.

Grass-roots efforts by faculty
and students played a significant
role in the progress of CSRE,
Saldivar said.
The Concerned Students for
Asian American Studies, which
was involved in the hiring of a
CSRE faculty member last year, is
waiting to see what will happen as
the proposal is reviewed by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. .
"On the whole, we're pretty
happy with the process right
now," said group representative
Jane Kim. "We're looking forward
to the curriculum, and we're look

ing forward to having those ma
jors at Stanford."
The history of CSRE reaches
far back, according to Saldi'var.
"For several generations of stu
dents at Stanford, there has
been interest in developing new
courses in these areas," Saldfvar
said.
He cited the increased num
ber of Chicano / Latino Stud
ies courses offered as an exam
ple.
"Over the years, the plan has
been to expand the curriculum
and to move to a position where
we can bring them together into
a coherent, rigorous and excit
ing degree program," Saldfvar
said.
Students interested in either
majoring or minoring under

CSRE should "come seek us
out," Chang said. "I think we can
be fairly confident of its passage"
through the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies and the full
senate."
Saldfvar doesn't expect the
program to be large; attracting a
huge number of students isn't a
goal behind CSRE, he said.
"The real goal is to provide an
educational opportunity for a
great number of students inter
ested in the area," he said. "The
program is a real opportunity for
Stanford to be a leader in the de
velopment of ethnic studies in
the United States. I think our
comparative program will be a
model that other excellent ethnic
studies programs will be increas
ingly turning to."
