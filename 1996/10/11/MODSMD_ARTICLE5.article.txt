Questions regarding undergraduate admis
sions took center stage at the first meeting of
this year's Faculty Senate.
In his annual report to the senate, Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aids
James Montoya discussed the changing climate
of admissions and its effects upon Stanford.
He identified several factors — such as an
earlier start to the admissions process and the
national debate on affirmative action — which
have changed the climate.

"Students have taken more of a consumer attitude," he said.
"They are concerned about whether or not they will get their
money's worth at Stanford."
Changes in the federal financial aid process have also led to
national attention, Montoya said, noting that he recently was in
terviewed by Ted Koppel for an "ABC News Nightline" segment
about financial aid.
In light of a one-year decline in the number of Asian-Ameri
can students admitted, Montoya said his office is examining the
current admissions rating system, in which applicants are rated
on a scale of 1 to 5 on both academic and non-academic criteria.
"We would like to be more sensitive and better understand
the immigrant experience," he said.
