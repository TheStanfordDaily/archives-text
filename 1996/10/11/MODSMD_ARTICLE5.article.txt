### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Questions regarding undergraduate admis
sions took center stage at the first meeting of
this year's Faculty Senate.
In his annual report to the senate, Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aids
James Montoya discussed the changing climate
of admissions and its effects upon Stanford.
He identified several factors — such as an
earlier start to the admissions process and the
national debate on affirmative action — which
have changed the climate.

"Students have taken more of a consumer attitude," he said.
"They are concerned about whether or not they will get their
money's worth at Stanford."
Changes in the federal financial aid process have also led to
national attention, Montoya said, noting that he recently was in
terviewed by Ted Koppel for an "ABC News Nightline" segment
about financial aid.
In light of a one-year decline in the number of Asian-Ameri
can students admitted, Montoya said his office is examining the
current admissions rating system, in which applicants are rated
on a scale of 1 to 5 on both academic and non-academic criteria.
"We would like to be more sensitive and better understand
the immigrant experience," he said.

Montoya also reported on the
progress of Stanford's early deci
sion program, instituted last year.
"We wanted to institute it in a
responsible manner," he said.
"We didn't want to send the mes
sage that the only way to attain
admission is through early admis
sion."
Several faculty members raised
questions about the quality of stu

dents admitted.
"Are we really getting the very
best students?" asked Statistics
Prof. Bradley Efron. "And if not,
what can we do to get better stu
dents?"
Montoya highlighted the
progress of several programs, in
cluding the President's Scholars
Program — which targets 200
Stanford admits specially selected
for extraordinary achievement —
and "Life of the Mind," a program
to educate high school students
about the opportunities that Stan
ford offers.

Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ram6n Saldfvar empha
sized that the best draw for top stu
dents is the promise of faculty con
tact.
"Access to faculty absolutely
makes an appreciable difference,"
he said.
In other business, Provost Con
doleezza Rice presented the sched
ule for department reviews for the
Schools of Engineering, Humani
ties and Sciences, and Medicine.
"Departmental reviews are an
ongoing process in all major
schools," she said.
