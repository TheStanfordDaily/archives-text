# Tuition benefits to end
## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Due to a shift in federal government policy, Stanford
will no longer provide a tuition benefits program to staff
hired after Sept. 1,1998.
Previously, individuals employed by Stanford for at
least five years were entitled to reimbursement for their
children's undergraduate education totaling as much as
half the cost of a Stanford education. The University
funded two-thirds of this sum, and the federal govern
ment funded the remaining third.
However, a decision by the federal Office of Manage
ment and Budget last May to cease contributing to the tu
ition benefits program as of Sept. 1,1999 caused Stanford
to change its policy, according to Provost Condoleezza Rice.
"The days are long gone in which we can simply bear
the cost of federal cuts," she said.
Rice said tuition benefits would continue to be available
to t hose employees hired before the September 1998 cutoff
date.
"It is a disproportionate benefit
in that it is only for those who have
children," she said "There are a
number of issues involved as a

University."
Rice said the move was consid
ered in light of making a total ben
efits package attractive to
prospective employees.
She said the University has
been experiencing extremely stiff
competition in hiring new faculty
in some areas, especially informa

tion and technology fields.
"Many of these faculty tend to
be very young," she said. "Tuition
benefits are no good to recruiting
them."
Rice has charged a staff benefits
committee to examine issues of em
ployee benefits and report back to
the senate within six months.
