# Is there still life after Juice Club?
## 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
For some, it was the only club that would ever accept
them.
The whir of blenders is now replaced with a silence;
the patch of wheat grass desiccated. The doors to Juice
Club have been closed since the beginning of the sum
mer due to a grease fire that began in the kitchen of
Hobee's, the popular restaurant located next door in
Town and Country Village in Palo Alto.
Back on campus, thirst only partially quenched with
flat sodas, many tongues are wagging about this calami
ty-
"Without Juice Club, the campus will dry up and blow
away," sophomore Red Anaya said.
The sassv taste of Razzmatazz and Strawberries Wild


Johnny Zannts — Daily
continues to linger in the minds of
many students.
"I still carry my mug every
day," said junior Megan Fix. "I'm
sad that only water fills it up
now."
"There's so many vitamins and
minerals," added Fix, the peer
health educator at Castano. "I've
never seen so many fruits in one
drink."
Juice Club had a healing power
beyond its spirulina and blue
algae.
"We used to go there after IM

sporting events. For softball, our
team record was 0-5," said junior
Mike Chen. "I enjoyed the citrus
flavor after the bittersweet taste
of defeat."
Others feel a deeper loss in the
aftermath.
"I'm from the Missouri. We
don't have things like that out
there. For me, smoothies and
Juice Club are naturally and inti
mately associated," said senior
Jason Husgen. "I saw a juice bar in
North Beach. I just looked at the
employees and thought 'You just
don't get it, do you?' "
Similarly, like the kids who
continue to make the trek to
Woodstock, Stanford freshmen
are experiencing nostalgia for an

era they never knew.
"Freshmen from all over had
heard of Juice Club — and now it's
gone," said senior Irene Chan, a
resident assistant in West Laguni
ta. "One woman from Connecticut
instantly recognized and mourned
when she saw the mug."
Not one for being lost in yester
day, senior Geoff Kaung saw the
fire as opportunity for future im
provement. Instead of the fruity
phoenix rising from the ashes, he
hoped for a winged pig.
"I hope they come out with a
meat-based smoothie when they
reopen," Kaung said. "More pro
tein."
Some students have the sour
taste of dry mouth influencing

their feelings.
"I expected to see a charred pile
of wood. It's essentially all there
— the floor, the counter, the build
ing. I'm bitter. It looks like all they
need to do is mop up," Husgen
said.
Scott Graeber, co-owner of
Juice Club, explained the delay
due in completing renovations.
"Smoke gets everywhere,"
Graeber said. "Health codes dic
tate that we need to seal it, to re
place it. We can't have cross-cont
amination. Plus we need to deal
with the different contractors, the
landlord, obtaining permits."
Graeber hopes to reopen the
store by the middle of December.
"We're going to have a grand open

ing about a week after the students
come back from winter break.
We'll block off the parking lot and
have a couple bands," he said.
No detail will be left unfin
ished. Even preparations for a
lush field of wheat grass are being
set in motion. According to Grae
ber, "We'll contact our vendor to
start sprouting the seedling in the
darkroom. After a few days under
the hot tract lights in the store,
the grass will grow several inch
es."
Graeber noted some possible
changes in the future, including
on-campus delivery, increased
sponsorship and mobile smoothie
making.
"We want to earn back every

one's loyalty," Graeber said. "But
we know everyone is hungry and
everyone knows our drinks."
Juice Club may face on-campus
competition from a Tresidder
Union smoothie bar. Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais said plans call for
a juice bar to open in the student
union by late spring quarter.
"We hope to have a lease signed
by early November," Wais said.
Originally, 10 vendors submit
ted full business proposals. The
Stanford Management Co. select
ed three finalists, Odwalla, Jamba
Juice (the parent company of
Juice Club) and Juice It.
The new business would be lo
cated in the spot previously occu
pied by the barbershop.
