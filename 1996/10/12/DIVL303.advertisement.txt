"The Unauthorized Authority on Cardinal Football"
"WANTED": Editor-in-Chief and Publisher
Experienced, enthusiastic management team sought for an industry-leading, award-winning newsletter exclusively covering
Stanford Cardinal Football; Time Commitment: unreasonable to the point of being ridiculous, especially during the football
season; Compensation: none (you may even have to become an investor yourself); Benefits: limited (although a few naive Dollies
may chat you up and some crispy old alum may score you a few free brew or ten); Career Implications: downwardly-mobile; Family
Implications: Don't even try!; Occupational Hazards: an "imaginationally-challenged" offensive staff and an athletic department
bureaucracy that will fight you every single step of the way; Bonus: Free hats & T-shirts. Successful candidates will possess
uncompromising dedication towards the Cardinal Crusade™, a high energy level (read: psychotic tendencies), and an obsession
with Stanford sports. Expect severe sleep deprivation, creative burn-out, emotional volatility and extremely limited "social
activity" during the Fall. "It's not just a job, it's a royal pain in the butt!" Send resumes to: rosebowl@thebootleg.com.
Season subscriptions (consisting of 14 artfully-crafted issues) are priced at $39 (for e-mail distribution) or $49 (by fax or U.S.
"Snail Mail"). Please forward payment and subscription information to: The Bootleg, 3 Pyrola Lane, San Carlos, CA 94070. You
can fire off a quick e-mail to us at: rosebowl@thebootleg.com. Phone #: (415)593-3579 Fax #: (415)592-4876. Be sure to call into
