# Oregon/Stanford Matchups
## 
### 
The Oregon flanker has emerged
as one of the top recovers in the Pa
cific 10 Conference regardless of
which quarterback is throwing to
him. He has also displayed tough
ness, coming back from a separated
shoulder in the opener against Fres
no State to make a critical catch that
keyed the victory over the Bulldogs.
Receivers like Griffin are nothing
new to Pruitt, who usually draws
the opponents' best pass catchers.
He has turned in an admirable job,
picking off nine passes in his two
plus years at corner. He has also be
come the iron man of the secondary,
starting 22 of Stanford's last 23
games and contributing 104 tackles
in the process.
Wilcox has become the go-to guy
on third-down situations, convert
ing 13 of his 18 receptions for first
downs or scores. Now in his final
year, this Duck standout has be
come the most prolific tight end in
school history while also quickly be
coming among the best receivers in
Oregon football. Meanwhile, Swin
ton has done it all on defense in the
early going, recording 35 tackles,
picking off a pass and recovering a
fumble. The Cardinal senior has
also shown remarkable versatility,
playing all four positions in the de
fensive secondary in the past three
seasons while accumulating 192
tackles in nearly four years of play.
For all the yardage allowed by the
Gang Green defense this year,
Wheaton has still become one of the
most dangerous corners in the Pac
-10, pacing the conference with five
interceptions last season while hav
ing already garnered in two picks
this year. With his teammates for
getting how to tackle, the junior cor
ner has also had to step up in that de
partment, leading the Ducks in
tackles the past two games. Mean
while, for all the criticism that Man
ning has faced, there is no denying
the numbers. The senior flanker
needs only 363 yards to become the
all-time Stanford leader in career re
ceiving yardage, leapfrogging over
names like Ed McCaffery and Dar
rin Nelson. Although he has yet to
catch a touchdown pass, Manning
still leads the team with 16 recep
tions for 223 yards thus far in 1996.
The Fairfield native would like
nothing more than to wreak havoc in
the Cardinal backfield. The senior de
fender already has 14 tackles for loss
es totaling 59 yards, including three
quarterback sacks. He also ranks
fifth all-time on the Oregon career
sack list. The menacing linebacker
will be coming up Cronshagen's side
of the line. Theyoung sophomore has
had to adapt quickly being only one
season removed from redshirting
while also protecting their young and
equally inexperienced signal caller.
With the Duck offense scoring at a
throttlingpace, the sophomore kick
er has had plenty of scoring oppor
tunities and he has been nearly flaw
less. Smith has converted nine of 12
field goals while splitting the up
rights on all 21 of his extra point at
tempts. Miller can do him one better
though, as he has taken on the punt
ing duties as well. While he has had
considerably less opportunities to
kick, the sputtering Stanford of
fense has given him plenty of
chances to punt and he has deliv
ered. The junior has averaged more
than 44 yards per kick while also
being perfect on his four field goal
and three point-after tries.
Both coaches are hoping there is
no such thing as a sophomore jinx in
the coaching ranks. After each expe
rienced tremendous success in their
rookie seasons last year, Bellotti and
Willingham need this game to turn
their respective seasons around.
After winning 12 of his first 15
games, Bellotti has seen his team get
run out of the stadium in three
straight conference losses. Mean
while, the ever-serious Willingham
has seen the Cardinal defense play
inspired ball while the offense con
tinues to have trouble finding the
end zone. All this has added up to a
1-3 start, one year removed from a 7-
4-1 bowl season.
