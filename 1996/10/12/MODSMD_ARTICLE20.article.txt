# Griffin takes flight in Ducks' pass offense
## Oregon flanker continues strong receiver tradition 
### Andrea De Young Special to Cardinal Today 
Before the season even started
Damon Griffin had high expecta
tions to live up to.
The Ducks had recently lost
their all-time leading receiver,
Cristin McLemore, to graduation,
and there was uncertainty about
who could take his place.
Six games into the season, the
junior flanker is making his case to
become McLemore's successor,
and it is a strong one. In his five
games this season, Griffin has
scored four touchdowns, including
two in a 48-27 loss to Arizona State
two weeks ago. The game against
the Sun Devils already ranks high

on Griffin's list of most memorable
games.
"The Arizona State game is the
best game I've played so far in my
career," he said. "I really haven't
been playing much so that's going
to stand out in my mind forever."
But Griffin has had more than
one spectacular game. He has
racked up 406 yards so far this sea
son and not only leads the Ducks in
receiving but also leads the confer
ence in catches with 25.
Griffin recognizes that in Ore
gon's style of offense, a game like
his against Arizona State won't
come around often.
"It's hard to have that kind of a
game with all of the receivers that
we have Dameron [Ricketts] and
Jibri Hodge and the tight ends,
Blake [Spence] and Josh [Wilcox],"
Griffin said. "It's hard for one re
ceiver to have a good game because
everybody gets the ball."
It was even more difficult for
Griffin because the team lost the
game. He acknowledges that per
sonal statistics are not as impor
tant as winning.
"It hurts. You finally have a
game you've been waiting for all
your life and you don't win," he
said. "Yeah, I had a good game, but
I didn't feel it because I was upset
and frustrated about losing."
When the Ducks faced UCLA

last Saturday, Griffin was playing
against a team that he grew up al
most around the corner from. He
was also facing a former teammate
in the backfield.
"UCLA was my second choice,"
he said. "It was a more comfortable
feeling coming up here to Oregon. I
wanted to have my own life. I felt I
could concentrate more on school if
I was away from home.
"The starting cornerback Andy
Colbert was my quarterback in ju
nior high school so we're really
going. .. at it."
Griffin's proficiency this year
can be chalked up in part to a new
offensive coordinator. With Dirk
Koetter now holding the reins of
the Oregon offense instead of A1

Borges, Griffin is
part of a system that
reflects his style of
play.
"Coach Koetter's
style of offense is re
ally my style," he
said. "It's aggressive
and [emphasizes
the] attack. We like
to put a lot of yards
up. We haven't got
ten into the end
zone a lot, but his
style of aggressive
ness is tough on [de
fensive backs] and
good for receivers.
DBs are on their
toes so much' that is
why we are able to
put so many yards

up every game."
Griffin considers himself to be
on the same wavelength as Koetter
playing with intensity is key.
"My mindset is aggressive," he
said. "Ever since I was growing up I
was always a kind of DB-type play
er. I didn't even play offense until
my senior year. My mindset is, 'l'm
going to dominate whoever is in
front of me.' I'm a very emotional
player, and I let people know that.
I'll tell anybody to pick it up.
"My strength is my will to win. I
always want to win; I can't stand to
lose. I was losing in high school all
my life. Since I came here I know
how it feels to win. Everybody likes
to win. I'll never quit and I will not
let our team quit."
On the physical side, Griffin en
joys one of the hardest parts of the
game being hit.
"There really isn't a ball that I
can't catch. If it's thrown to me,
I'm going to catch it. I'm not scared
of catching the ball in the middle,"
Griffin said. "In fact I kind of like
catching the ball in the middle. I
like to get hit. It really takes a DB's
mindset away if you catch a ball and
he just thrashes you and you get
right back up and start talking
smack right away. You've really got
him in his head, and once you get
him in his head, it's over with for a
DB. It's total domination after

that."
During the season-opening 30-
27 win over Fresno State, Griffin
went down with a slightly separat
ed shoulder but was only out for a
few plays before jumping right back
into the action. He proceeded to
catch a pass that led to the game
tying field goal.
The injury did keep him out of
the victory over Nevada, but head

coach Mike Bellotti has been im
pressed with Griffin's play all
year long.
"Damon Griffin has done a very
nice job of improving his level of
play every week since he came
back from the injury," Bellotti
said.
Griffin recognizes he is still far
from knocking McLemore out of
the Oregon record book, but step

ping into his place on the field is be
coming a reality.
"That is a big step," Griffin
said. "He did some great stuff
here, and he had a great career. I
looked up to him. I had to steal a
lot of style from him."
If Griffin continues to play like
he has in the past few weeks, future
Oregon receivers may be stealing
style from him.

game with all of the receivers that
we have Dameron [Ricketts] and
Jibri Hodge and the tight ends,
Blake [Spence] and Josh [Wilcox],"
Griffin said. "It's hard for one re
ceiver to have a good game because
everybody gets the ball."
It was even more difficult for
Griffin because the team lost the
game. He acknowledges that per
sonal statistics are not as impor
tant as winning.
"It hurts. You finally have a
game you've been waiting for all
your life and you don't win," he
said. "Yeah, I had a good game, but
I didn't feel it because I was upset
and frustrated about losing."
When the Ducks faced UCLA

last Saturday, Griffin was playing
against a team that he grew up al
most around the corner from. He
was also facing a former teammate
in the backfield.
"UCLA was my second choice,"
he said. "It was a more comfortable
feeling coming up here to Oregon. I
wanted to have my own life. I felt I
could concentrate more on school if
I was away from home.
"The starting cornerback Andy
Colbert was my quarterback in ju
nior high school so we're really
going. .. at it."
Griffin's proficiency this year
can be chalked up in part to a new
offensive coordinator. With Dirk
Koetter now holding the reins of
the Oregon offense instead of A1

Borges, Griffin is
part of a system that
reflects his style of
play.
"Coach Koetter's
style of offense is re
ally my style," he
said. "It's aggressive
and [emphasizes
the] attack. We like
to put a lot of yards
up. We haven't got
ten into the end
zone a lot, but his
style of aggressive
ness is tough on [de
fensive backs] and
good for receivers.
DBs are on their
toes so much' that is
why we are able to
put so many yards

up every game."
Griffin considers himself to be
on the same wavelength as Koetter
playing with intensity is key.
"My mindset is aggressive," he
said. "Ever since I was growing up I
was always a kind of DB-type play
er. I didn't even play offense until
my senior year. My mindset is, 'l'm
going to dominate whoever is in
front of me.' I'm a very emotional
player, and I let people know that.
I'll tell anybody to pick it up.
"My strength is my will to win. I
always want to win; I can't stand to
lose. I was losing in high school all
my life. Since I came here I know
how it feels to win. Everybody likes
to win. I'll never quit and I will not
let our team quit."
On the physical side, Griffin en
joys one of the hardest parts of the
game being hit.
"There really isn't a ball that I
can't catch. If it's thrown to me,
I'm going to catch it. I'm not scared
of catching the ball in the middle,"
Griffin said. "In fact I kind of like
catching the ball in the middle. I
like to get hit. It really takes a DB's
mindset away if you catch a ball and
he just thrashes you and you get
right back up and start talking
smack right away. You've really got
him in his head, and once you get
him in his head, it's over with for a
DB. It's total domination after

that."
During the season-opening 30-
27 win over Fresno State, Griffin
went down with a slightly separat
ed shoulder but was only out for a
few plays before jumping right back
into the action. He proceeded to
catch a pass that led to the game
tying field goal.
The injury did keep him out of
the victory over Nevada, but head

coach Mike Bellotti has been im
pressed with Griffin's play all
year long.
"Damon Griffin has done a very
nice job of improving his level of
play every week since he came
back from the injury," Bellotti
said.
Griffin recognizes he is still far
from knocking McLemore out of
the Oregon record book, but step

ping into his place on the field is be
coming a reality.
"That is a big step," Griffin
said. "He did some great stuff
here, and he had a great career. I
looked up to him. I had to steal a
lot of style from him."
If Griffin continues to play like
he has in the past few weeks, future
Oregon receivers may be stealing
style from him.
