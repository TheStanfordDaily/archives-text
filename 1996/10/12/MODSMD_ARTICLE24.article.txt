# Ducks display matador-like defense
## Oregon attack offset by injuries, poor tackling 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
Today's game between Oregon and Stan
ford features two teams desperate to stay
out of the Pacific 10 Conference basement.
It is expected to be a contest in which Ore
gon's potent offense is tested by Stanford's
dominant defense.
No, this is not an episode of "The Twi
light Zone." It just appears that way.
Oregon (3-3, 0-3 Pac-10) started off its
season by winning three fairly easy non
conference games, coasting to a top-25
ranking and living up to the expectations of
another finish at or near the top of the con
ference. However, once the league season
began, Oregon fell apart. The Ducks find
themselves needing a win to keep the possi
bility alive of a winning conference record
and thus a decent bowl berth. History is not
on their side; they are seeking only their
second Stanford Stadium win in 13 years.
"I can say that we haven't quite been sat
isfied with our performance obviously,"
said Ducks head coach Mike Bellotti. "We're
3-3. We won our first three and lost our last
three so we've got to try and turn things
around."
The first thing that the Ducks need to
turn around is their defense. The "Gang
Green" defense has had symptoms of gan
grene, giving up an average of 38.2 points
per game. The minimum amount of points
Oregon has given up in a game this season is
27 the maximum amount the Cardinal
defense has allowed.
However, the Ducks offense has been al
most impressive as their defense has been
pathetic. The team is racking up 33.7 points
a game on average, even scoring 27 points
on the Arizona State defense which held
two-time defending national champion Ne
braska scoreless.
"So, I guess in one sense, it's a battle of a
pretty good offense vs. a very good defense,
from our standpoint," Bellotti said. "I guess
the unknown is how well Stanford's offense
is going to play against our defense."
However, the Oregon defense has shown
some brief flashes of improvement recently.
Last week against UCLA, the Ducks held
the Bruins to only a touchdown and little
else in the first half. Then all hell broke
loose as UCLA scored on their first five dri
ves of the second half. Bellotti said that the
first half against the Bruins was the Ducks'
best defensive half all year.
"I don't think we've played 60 minutes
on both sides of the ball yet this year," he
said. "I'm encouraged by the progress the
defense has made."

Oregon has been equally incompetent at
stopping its opponents' running and pass
ing games. The Duck defense has allowed
261 passing yards per game and 212.5 rush
ing yards per game. Last week, Oregon gave
up 461 yards to UCLA about average for
the Ducks thus far this year with 288 of
those yards coming in the second half.
Injuries have been one of the reasons for
Oregon's defensive collapse. Four players
with starting experience defensive backs
Michael Fletcher and Brandon McLemore,
linebacker Matt Lofrano and defensive end
Mark Schmidt all sat out last week.
Fletcher and McLemore will also miss this
week's contest while Schmidt is listed as
"very doubtful" and Lofrano is question
able.
In other words, Stanford's offense may
have its best opportunity of the season to
get on track. Of course, the same could be
said about the Oregon defense.
As for the Ducks' offense, one word accu
rately describes it: passing. And lots of it. In
their second game of the season against
Nevada, star quarterback Tony Graziani in
jured his right knee, and Oregon did not
miss a beat. Senior backup Ryan Perry-
Smith came in and rewrote the Oregon
record book. Against Arizona State, Perry-
Smith threw for 468 yards, the second-best
total in Oregon history. His 395-yard effort
against Colorado State placed him sixth on
the list, and he is currently ranked eighth in
the NCAA in total offense. His 1,287 yards
passing in his four starts is the best four
game stretch in Oregon history.
However, Perry-Smith may find himself
back on the bench, with Graziani expected
to start the game.
"If Tony Graziani is healthy, Tony will
play," Bellotti said at Tuesday's press con
ference. "That has not been a question yet
because he has not been healthy enough."
Regardless of who starts, the air attack
should be the main source of offense for
Oregon, as their running game has been
disappointing thus far, averaging only
95.5 yards a game. Leading rusher Sal
adin McCullough has missed the past
three games all losses and is doubt
ful for today's game. Last week, the Ducks
only managed 45 rushing yards against
UCLA.
Bellotti said getting the running game
going against Stanford is crucial.
"We've been very pass-oriented," he said.
"I think a little too much so."
In other words, the key matchup for the
game may be Oregon's potent passing
against Stanford's dominant defense.
How times have changed.

likely return to the starting lineup after missing the last four games due to a knee injury.
