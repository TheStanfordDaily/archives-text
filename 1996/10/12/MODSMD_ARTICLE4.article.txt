# Wong shows surprising impact on defense
## Eugene native blossoms into menacing defensive end for Cardinal 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
Two years ago, Cardinal defen
sive lineman Kailee Wong, watched
as his hometown team, the Oregon
Ducks, marched into the Rose Bowl
as the Pacific 10 Conference repre
sentative.
While it would have been easy for
the North Eugene High School star
to regret his decision to attend Stan
ford instead of Oregon, the 6-foot-3,
260-pound defensive end focused on
the positives at Stanford and has
blossomed into one of the premier
defensive linemen in the Pac-10.

"You would definitely like to be
on the team that is going to the Rose
Bowl," Wong said. "I just had to take
it in stride and look at the positives
that were here for me."
Now a junior, Wong was recruit
ed by Stanford as a linebacker, one
of the positions he played in high
school. While garnering many na
tional defensive honors his senior
year, Wong was also named the state
co-offensive player of the year while
rushing for 1,658 yards and 21
touchdowns.
The problem Stanford faced was
luring him away from the Ducks,
who had been recruiting Wong since

early in his high school career.
"I was recruited in my sopho
more year, so it started pretty early
for me," Wong said. "It wasn't that
tough a decision though. It's not like
I didn't like Oregon; I just needed to
get out of Oregon and experience
something else."
Wong started seven games as a
freshman, recording 23 tackles, one
quarterback sack and two tackles
for loss. Each year, Wong has im
proved and is now thought of as not
only one of the most improved play
ers in the league but one of the best.
Last year, Wong added 39 total
tackles, one sack and five tackles for

loss. This season,
Wong has taken his
play to a higher level,
amassing 24 tackles,
five sacks and five
tackles for loss in the
first four games.
"I just think I fi
nally have more con
fidence in my ability,"
Wong said. "It's not
like I didn't have con
fidence before, but
now I am accepting
more of a role in get
ting the job done."
While Wong may
feel he is taking on a
larger role this year,
his teammates seem
to think he's become

a much more intense player.
Wong "has always been kind of a
leader; he's always been real vocal,
always trying to pump the team up,"
said senior strong safety Eliel Swin
ton. "Even though you don'tseehim
saying stuff during a game, he is say
ing stuff to us like, 'Let's go, let's
work through this.' "
Wong "seems a little bit more
intense this year," said linebacker
Chris Draft, who rooms with Wong
this year. "Our defense has to be
leaders everybody on the de
fense has to be a leader and he's
played his part."
Wong has definitely become
more vocal on the field this year, as
evidenced by his play last week in
Seattle. As time was winding down
in the third quarter last Saturday,
Wong took exception to a Husky
knocking his helmet off. His out
burst following the play was per
haps a good sign to many Cardinal
fans.
"That's just [Wong] showing a lot
of emotion this year and showing
how his desire for the game has
grown within him into more of a
hunger for him," Swinton said.
For Wong and the rest of the Car
dinal defense, this season has been
the first in years in which people are

actually talking about the defense
rather than the offense. Most no
tably, people are boasting that Stan
ford has the 20th-ranked scoring de
fense in the nation at just 15 points
per game.
"We do want to keep scores
down," Wong said. "We don't want
to be pushed around and be consid
ered one of the Stanford teams of the
past with all offense and no de
fense."
Despite the defense's improve
ment, Wong still lacks what the
Ducks have a Pac-10 champi
onship. "I never want to go home be
cause it will be rubbed in my face,"
Wong said. "I'll go out places or see
my friends; they make a concerted
effort to tell me about what I missed
out on."
Accordingly, when Wong takes
the field on Saturday, he'll be look
ing for a win even more than his
teammates. "It's huge for me,"
Wong said. "These are some of the
games that every athlete likes to
play in with people back home
watching.
"I try to get up for every game
the same, but for some reason or
another I usually end up raising my
level of play a little bit higher
against Oregon."
