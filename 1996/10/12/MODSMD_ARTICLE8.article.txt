# CARDINAL NOTES
## Cardinal hunts for win against Ducks 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
After coming off two straight
underwhelming offensive show
ings, the Cardinal looks to get on
track against the soft defense of
the Oregon Ducks in this year's
Homecoming game. Both squads
have struggled of late, with Stan
ford losing their last two contests
while Oregon has dropped three
straight conference games after
winning the first three games to
start the year.
The Ducks have been decimat
ed by injuries to their backfield,
forcing them to use their fourth
running back this year while also
losing their starting quarterback
for four games. Meanwhile, it ap
pears that Stanford quarterback
Chad Hutchinson's head is clear
once again after taking a devastat
ing blow last week against Wash
ington. The minor concussion ap
pears to have subsided and the
sophomore will be ready to go
today.
OFFENSE STILL STAG
NANT: After posting 23 points in
the first half against San Jose
State, the Stanford offense has
fallen off the face of the earth. In
the last 10 quarters against the
Spartans, Wisconsin and the
Huskies, the offense has only pro
duced two Kevin Miller field goals,
both coming last week. It marked
the first time in 11 years that the
Cardinal was held to single digits
in consecutive games. Further
more, the goose egg against the
Badgers also marked the first time
Stanford was shut out since 1990,
when the Cardinal dropped a 31-0
decision to Oregon.
While Hutchinson has shown
flashes of brilliance directing the
offense, he has been harassed con
sistently by the pass rush while
also throwing five interceptions.
Also, the running back tandem of
senior Mike Mitchell and junior
Anthony Bookman has not helped
the young quarterback. They are
averaging only 4.2 and 3.0 yards
per carry, respectively. Junior
place-kicker Kevin Miller has been
a bright spot, going 4 for 4 on field
goal attempts and hitting on all
three of his extra point tries. Se

nior fullback Adam Salina leads
the team with three touchdowns.
DEFENSE CONTINUES TO
CARRY THE DAY: For the first
time in several years, the Cardinal
has showed it can contain the op
ponents' offense. Going into
today's contest, Stanford ranks
first in the conference in scoring
defense, allowing only 15 points
per game, which also puts them
20th in the nation. Furthermore,
it is nearly 12 points off of last sea
son's average of 26.2.
Several players have stepped up
this year, including junior defen
sive end Kailee Wong, who has
recorded five quarterback sacks.
Also chipping in are junior inside
linebacker Chris Draft and junior

defensive tackle Carl Hansen with
two sacks apiece. This adds up to
an improved sack attack. Last sea
son, the Cardinal recorded 20
sacks. Through four games in
1996, Stanford already has 12. Ju
nior inside linebacker Jon Haskins
paces the team with 41 tackles.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal
will again be without the services
of senior nose tackle Pete Swan
son, who is out with a separated
left shoulder. Senior cornerback
Alistair White is questionable with
an ankle injury.
HERE COMES THE QUACK
ATTACK: Despite some roster
depleting injuries, the Oregon
Ducks bring some impressive
numbers into this game, most no
tably through the air. Between
Ryan Perry-Smith and Tony
Graziani, the Ducks have already
passed for more than 2,000 yards
and 12 touchdowns. Six receivers
are already in double digits in re
ceptions, led by junior Damon
Griffin with 25.
Not only is the receiving corps
catching an abundance of passes,

the wideouts are also making it
count with big-yardage plays. Six
different receivers are averaging
better than 16 yards a catch. Se
nior Josh Wilcox adds another di
mension to the passing game at
tight end with his ability to make
clutch catches in key situations.
However, as impressive as the
stats have been, they are practical
ly all the Ducks have with the run
ning game in shambles. In only its
seventh game, Oregon is already
using their fourth tailback in
sophomore tailback Kevin Parker.
With all the instability, it's no
wonder the Ducks average a
mediocre three yards per carry and
95 yards per game. Also, the de
fense has not helped matters any
by allowing an average of 48 points
in Oregon's first three conference

games, all losses. Oregon has been
outscored in that stretch 144-93.
Perhaps the only two bright spots
on the defense have been the quar
terback-sacking skills of senior
outside linebacker Reggie Jordan
and the pass-picking abilities of ju
nior cornerback Kenny Wheaton.
HOME FIELD ADVAN
TAGE?: In the last three meet
ings between the two teams, the
road team has come out victori
ous. Last season, in a battle of un
beatens, Stanford shocked the
12th-ranked Ducks in Eugene 28-
21 while the year prior, Oregon
embarrassed the Cardinal in
Stanford Stadium 55-21 on its
way to a conference title and Rose
Bowl berth. In 1993, former
standout receiver Mark Harris
had a career-high 182 yards re

ceiving to pace Stanford to a 38-34
cliffhanger in Autzen Stadium.
Lately, the numbers favor the
Cardinal as Stanford has won
seven of the last 10 meetings and
leads the overall series 40-10 with
one deadlock.
HOMECOMING IS HERE
ONCE AGAIN: Today's game
also marks Homecoming Reunion
weekend. Events and festivities
that started yesterday will contin
ue through today. Also adding to
the fanfare is the very first All-
Sports Festival in Arrillaga Fami
ly Sports Center Plaza. More than
30 Stanford teams will be repre
sented by current and former
players as well as the coaches. The
proceedings begin this morning at
9 a.m. and are open to the public.

Stanford ranks first in
the conference in
scoring defense,
allowing only 15
points per game.

Junior running back Anthony Bookman (4) and senior right guard Brad Badger (78) hope to punch holes
in the soft Oregon defense this afternoon.
