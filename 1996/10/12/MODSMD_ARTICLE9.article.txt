No. 16Washington(3-l)atNo. 12 Notre Dame (3-1)
11:30 ami.
The Huskies travel to hallowed Notre Dame Stadi
um for the first time since 1948, when Frank Leahy's
fabled squad trounced Washington 46-0. Last year's
contest in Seattle was much closer as Notre Dame ral
lied for a 29-21 win by scoring 15 unanswered points in
the final four minutes. Tailback Rashaan Shehee had
a sensational game in a losing effort, shredding the
Irish defense for 171 yards and two touchdowns. On
the other side, Ron Powlus looks to bounce back from
a poor performance against Ohio State. Beano Cook's
golden boy threw for only 154 yards in a 29-16 loss to
the Buckeyes. So much for all the multiple national
championships and Heisman Trophies that were sup
posed to come Powlus' way.
No. 4 Arizona St. (5-0) at UCLA (2-2) 12:30 p.m.
The Sun Devils are rolling along with frightening ef
ficiency, the likes which haven't been seen since the
days of Frank Kush. Senior quarterback Jake Plum
mer is the real deal, rolling up impressive numbers
against cream puffs like Boise State and delivering
clutch performances against top teams like Nebraska
All in all, it adds up to their best start since 1982, taking
the heat off of head coach Bruce Snyder. Meanwhile,
the ever-smiling Bob Toledo picked up an impressive
road conference win against Oregon. His Bruins ran
through the sieve-like Duck defense for 461 yards of
total offense, including 303 on the ground. Tailback
Skip Hicks ran for 153 yards in the third quarter alone.
There is hope for Mitchell and Bookman.

Arizona (3-2) at USC (3-2) 3:30 p.m.
In the new Burger King commercials featuring
head coaches of prominent college football programs,
Trojan coach John Robinson ponders, "If you're sec
ond best, what's the point?" Jolly John may be looking
for the answer after suffering a humiliating home de
feat at the hands of California, their first such loss
since 1970. Adding salt to the wound was being shut
out for three quarters by a Cal defense that allowed 42
points to perennial doormat Oregon State. Mean
while, Arizona is adding a sequel to the "Desert
Swarm" defense of 1994, better known as the "Desert
Swipe" squad. The Wildcat secondary is leading the
conference with 10 interceptions, including four by
cornerback Chris McAlister.
Washington St. (3-2) at Oregon St. (0-4) 1 p.m.
The fact that this rivalry dates back to 1903 is about
the most exciting thing one can say for this game. A los
ing season from the Beavers is quickly joining death and
taxes as a third constant in life. However, the last time
these two squads squared off in Corvallis two years ago,
Oregon State delivered a 21-3 victory which, incidental
ly, was the last conference victory for the Beavers.
Washington State quarterback Ryan Leaf looks to put
up big numbers this afternoon. He has thrown 10
touchdown passes in the last three games, including two
last week against Arizona. He has also been spreading
the ball around with five different Cougar receivers get
ting more than 50 yards receiving last Saturday. With
the Beavers ranking ninth in the conference in pass de
fense, it looks like the beat will go on.
