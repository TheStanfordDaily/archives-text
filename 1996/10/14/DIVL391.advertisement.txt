FOR THE RECORD...
The text of Proposition 209 that appeared in Tuesday's Daily
was an early draft of the initiative. The version of the initiative
that will appear on the November ballot differs primarily in the
ordering of the paragraphs. In the official version of Prop. 209,
the paragraph pertaining specifically to sex-based classifications
is paragraph (c), not (d). For the official text of the proposition,
see http://Vote96.ss.ca.gov.
An article in Friday's Daily incorrectly stated that the Univer
sity will discontinue its tuition benefits program for faculty and
staff hired rfter Sept. 1, 1998. In fact, Provost Condoleezza Rice
has asked a committee to examine options for the future of the
program in wake of the federal government's decision to stop pro
viding partial funding for it. Eliminating the program is one
option the committee will consider.
