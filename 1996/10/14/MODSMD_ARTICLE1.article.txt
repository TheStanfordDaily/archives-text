# Rankings rankle
## Crusade launched against U.S. News 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
ASSU Vice
President Nick
Thompson has
launched a cam
paign to prevent
U.S. News &
World Report
from compiling
its annual rank
ings of universi
ties.

Thompson has called on college
students across the country to ask
their universities to stop submit
ting the data that makes the rank
ings possible.
Tomorrow, ASSU Senate
Deputy Chair Joe Freund will in
troduce a bill before the senate
that requests Stanford to pull out
of the news magazine's 10-year
old rankings.
"I would prefer that the infor
mation be provided, but it should
come from a source not motivated
by money and should not subjec
tively rank colleges," Thompson
said. "College education cannot
and should not be quantified."
Supporting Thompson in his
drive against the national news
magazine is a small group of con
cerned students and ASSU sena
tors.
"The focus group has six or
seven people that are contacting
people, friends, activists and stu
dent governments at other cam

puses," Thompson said. "Our goal
is to get enough student groups
behind this to make it into a na
tional issue."
The University of California
Student Association — the stu
dent government body overseeing
all eight UC campuses — is sched
uled to consider a resolution simi
lar to Freund's later this month.
Student support has been
promised at Harvard University,
the University of Michigan, Yale
University, Princeton University,
Antioch College, the University of
Chicago, Tufts University, UC-
Santa Cruz, the University of
Hawaii and Washington Universi
ty, Freund said.
Freund added that Thompson,
a Truman Scholar, has contacted
other Truman Scholars in search
of support.
"The responses we're getting
are really encouraging," Freund
said. "Although this may seem to
be a fairly small issue, it shows
that college students still can get
together and try to accomplish
things."
Freund has asked officials at
the U.S. Department of Education
if they are capable of providing the
school-by-school information U.S.
News now provides but in a non
ranked format.
Currently, the department
only judges schools to ensure they
provide a legitimate education,
