# Rankings rankle
## Crusade launched against U.S. News 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
ASSU Vice
President Nick
Thompson has
launched a cam
paign to prevent
U.S. News &
World Report
from compiling
its annual rank
ings of universi
ties.

Thompson has called on college
students across the country to ask
their universities to stop submit
ting the data that makes the rank
ings possible.
Tomorrow, ASSU Senate
Deputy Chair Joe Freund will in
troduce a bill before the senate
that requests Stanford to pull out
of the news magazine's 10-year
old rankings.
"I would prefer that the infor
mation be provided, but it should
come from a source not motivated
by money and should not subjec
tively rank colleges," Thompson
said. "College education cannot
and should not be quantified."
Supporting Thompson in his
drive against the national news
magazine is a small group of con
cerned students and ASSU sena
tors.
"The focus group has six or
seven people that are contacting
people, friends, activists and stu
dent governments at other cam

puses," Thompson said. "Our goal
is to get enough student groups
behind this to make it into a na
tional issue."
The University of California
Student Association — the stu
dent government body overseeing
all eight UC campuses — is sched
uled to consider a resolution simi
lar to Freund's later this month.
Student support has been
promised at Harvard University,
the University of Michigan, Yale
University, Princeton University,
Antioch College, the University of
Chicago, Tufts University, UC-
Santa Cruz, the University of
Hawaii and Washington Universi
ty, Freund said.
Freund added that Thompson,
a Truman Scholar, has contacted
other Truman Scholars in search
of support.
"The responses we're getting
are really encouraging," Freund
said. "Although this may seem to
be a fairly small issue, it shows
that college students still can get
together and try to accomplish
things."
Freund has asked officials at
the U.S. Department of Education
if they are capable of providing the
school-by-school information U.S.
News now provides but in a non
ranked format.
Currently, the department
only judges schools to ensure they
provide a legitimate education,


Thompson
but officials told Freund they were
interested in an expanded mission.
"They seemed very interested
and asked me to write up a propos
al and send it in," Freund said.
"They have the resources to start
a more specific, comprehensive
study."
Thompson said he believes
Stanford and other universities
around the country make deci
sions designed to improve their
survey rankings.

"I think the U.S. News rank
ings are in the back of the minds of
the administration all the time,"
Thompson said. "They are not the
driving force (behind decisions),
but they are a force."
Thompson cites three major re
cent changes to University policies
that he believes were formulated
to improve Stanford's U.S. News
ranking. They are:
• the changes in Stanford's
grading policy, designed to im
prove Stanford's "academic repu
tation" score;
• the new early decision pro
gram, designed to increase the
University's "selectivity" ranking

by improving the yield rate — the
number of students that accept of
fers of admission; and
• the Stanford Fund, designed
to improve Stanford's worst score:
"alumni giving rate" — a category
based not upon the aggregate
value of donations but upon the
percentage of living alumni who
make donations, regardless of
each donation's size.
Director of University Commu
nications Terry Shepard took
issue with Thompson's claims.
"We notice the U.S. News rank
ings like everyone else, and sure,
we wish we were No. 1 every year,
but our greater wish is to provide

the best possible education,"
Shepard said. "Policy changes
around here are based upon trying
to give the best possible educa
tion."
Shepard pointed out that the
policy initiatives Thompson indi
cated came from different places of
the University. Only one change,
the creation of the Stanford Fund,
came from the President's Office.
"When [University President
Gerhard] Casper came here four
year ago, he was surprised at
how low our annual giving rate
was," Shepard said. "Stanford's
fund-raising philosophy had
been to get larger gifts, (Casper]

saw a need to put more emphasis
on more smaller donors because,
for one, the Hewletts and the
Packards in this world are mor
tal."
Shepard said he supports
Thompson's crusade.
"We wish him well," Shepard
said, adding that the University
has no love for the rankings.
"All of the schools at the top of
that list are excellent schools and
to try to distinguish between them
by tenths of points is impossible,"
Shepard said.
"You can't statistically capture
the qualities of a university," he
said. "What's the best school for

one student may not be the best
for another student."
In the 1997 survey, released
last month, Stanford fell two slots
to sixth place. University initia
tives taken during the last acade
mic year will not affect Stanford's
place in the U.S. News rankings
until next year's survey.
Five schools chose not to re
spond to the this year's survey. All
were ranked based upon data from
outside sources, including the De
partment of Education, the Amer
ican Association of University
Professors, previous U.S. News
survey data and U.S. News ap
proximations.

nications Terry Shepard took
issue with Thompson's claims.
"We notice the U.S. News rank
ings like everyone else, and sure,
we wish we were No. 1 every year,
but our greater wish is to provide

the best possible education,"
Shepard said. "Policy changes
around here are based upon trying
to give the best possible educa
tion."
Shepard pointed out that the
policy initiatives Thompson indi
cated came from different places of
the University. Only one change,
the creation of the Stanford Fund,
came from the President's Office.
"When [University President
Gerhard] Casper came here four
year ago, he was surprised at
how low our annual giving rate
was," Shepard said. "Stanford's
fund-raising philosophy had
been to get larger gifts, (Casper]

saw a need to put more emphasis
on more smaller donors because,
for one, the Hewletts and the
Packards in this world are mor
tal."
Shepard said he supports
Thompson's crusade.
"We wish him well," Shepard
said, adding that the University
has no love for the rankings.
"All of the schools at the top of
that list are excellent schools and
to try to distinguish between them
by tenths of points is impossible,"
Shepard said.
"You can't statistically capture
the qualities of a university," he
said. "What's the best school for

one student may not be the best
for another student."
In the 1997 survey, released
last month, Stanford fell two slots
to sixth place. University initia
tives taken during the last acade
mic year will not affect Stanford's
place in the U.S. News rankings
until next year's survey.
Five schools chose not to re
spond to the this year's survey. All
were ranked based upon data from
outside sources, including the De
partment of Education, the Amer
ican Association of University
Professors, previous U.S. News
survey data and U.S. News ap
proximations.
