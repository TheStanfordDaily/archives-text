## Africa supports Boutros-Ghali; Christopher's objections rebuffed 
### 
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — Secretary
of State Warren Christopher is getting a
lukewarm hearing from African leaders for
his campaign against a second term for
U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-
Ghali.
Both the head of the Organization for
African Unity and South African President
Nelson Mandela restated after Christopher
arrived last week that they support re-elect
ing the Egyptian diplomat.
The U.S. campaign, in fact, is short on
support around the world. Only Rwanda and
the Southeast Asian nation of Malaysia have
publicly backed Washington, which con
tends that Boutros-Cihali has not done
enough to restructure the money-strapped
United Nations.
The timing of Christopher's five-nation
Africa tour to seek support for a new secre
tary-general has also been met with cyni
cism.
Some say President Clinton has practi
cally ignored the continent until now — sev

eral weeks before the U.S. presidential elec
tion.
"Africa within the world appears to
becoming much marginalized," said
Antoinette Handley, director of studies at
the South African Institute of International
Affairs.
"We certainly haven't seen a high profile
U.S. visit for many months and we have to
question the motivation, coming so close to
an election," she said. "There is also the
African-American constituency which is so
important to the Democrats."
A Clinton endorsement of Boutros-Ghali
would have played right into the hands of
the Republicans, who have long accused the
United Nations of being a bloated bureau
cracy.
Jacques Godfrain, France's minister for
development cooperation, also suggested
that Christopher's visit was politically
timed.
"I am pleased that after Washington has
cut its public and development aid by 15

percent, that after President Clinton has
not traveled to Africa even once . . . several
weeks before the presidential elections,
Africa has become a priority of the Ameri
can government," said Godfrain, whose
country has voiced support for Boutros-
Ghali.
This brought an angry response Friday
from State Department spokesman Nicolas
Burns.
"Minister Godfrain seems to believe the
United States just discovered Africa," Burns
said, citing visits to the continent by Vice
President A 1 Gore last year and other U.S.
officials. "I don't know if he's been living
under a rock or what."
Christopher's first stop in Africa was
Mali, an impoverished West African state
that has been praised by the West for its
transition to democracy after three decades
of Marxist rule. It was the first visit by a
U.S. secretary of state and thousands of
Malians were made to line the roads as
Christopher's motorcade passed.
