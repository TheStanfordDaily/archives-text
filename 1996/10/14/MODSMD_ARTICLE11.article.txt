# Yanks head to World Series
## New York defeats Orioles 6-4 in Baltimore's Camden Yards 
### 
BALTIMORE (AP) — Absent for 15 years, the
Yankees are returning to what was once their tra
ditional October stage.
Powered by a three-homer third inning and
eight strong innings from Andy Pettitte, New
York won its 34th American League pennant yes
terday with a 6-4 victory over the Baltimore Ori
oles.
The Yankees took the American League Cham
pionship Series 4-1 and head to the World Series
for the first time since 1981.
New York closed out the best-of-7 series with a
dominating performance reminiscent of the great
Yankees teams of the 1950s and 60s featuring
DiMaggio, Berra, Ford, Mantle and Maris.
This group, with names like Jeter, Williams,
Pettitte, Fielder and Strawberry, will get a chance
to make its own mark in the franchise's storied
history when the World Series opens Saturday
night at Yankee Stadium.
The National League entrant — the St. Louis

Cardinals or Atlanta Braves — will have their
hands full because the Yankees are playing their
best ball of the season.
When Cal Ripken grounded out for the final
out, the Yankees celebrated in a mob scene in the
middle of the infield at Camden Yards where they
went 9-0 this season.
Bernie Williams hit .474 (9-for-19) with two
homers and six RBIs and was named MVP of the
series.
Williams, along with rookie shortstop Derek
Jeter, carried the Yankees offensively through the
first three games of the series before New York's
power hitters came around.
After winning Game 1 in New York's Yankee
Stadium — "The House that Ruth Built" — with
the help of Jeffrey Maier, a 12-year-old fan from
New Jersey, and taking Game 3 at Camden Yards
with a shocking four-run eighth inning, the Yan
kees wrapped up the series with two conventional
wins.
