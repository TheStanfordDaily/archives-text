FBI dispatched to Antarctica
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) — FBI agents are
making what are believed to be unprecedented
visits to Antarctica to investigate an assault and
staff dispute at two bases.
Three agents were expected yesterday at the
U.S. Antarctic base at McMurdo Sound to inves
tigate an assault case.
A fight broke out between two cooks in the
galley on Wednesday, in which one attacked
another with the claw end of a hammer.
A third cook who tried to break up the fight
also was injured.
The case provides a novel legal test for the
FBI, since it appears to be the first time the
United States has sent federal law enforcement
officials to a U.S. Antarctic base to investigate a
serious crime.
Visitors who taunt the penguins and seals
or remove rock samples are normally han
dled by the station's chief scientist, who is a

deputized U.S. Marshal.
Gas prices fall
CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) — The nation's
average gasoline price fell 1.64 cents a gallon in
the last three weeks, led by declines in the West,
according to an oil industry survey released yes
terday.
The average retail price per gallon for all
grades, including taxes, was $1.28 on Friday,
according to the Lundberg Survey of prices at
10,000 gas stations nationwide.
Most parts of the country showed little
change in gas prices.
The average numbers were pulled down by
continued drops on the West Coast, where
prices had soared last spring.
The survey found the average price at self
serve pumps was $1.22 a gallon for regular
unleaded; $1.32 for mid-grade unleaded; and
$1.40 for premium.
