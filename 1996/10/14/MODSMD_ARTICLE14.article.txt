In rewriting the Judicial
Charter, keep students
informed and protected

LIKE MOST OF our campus,
the Stanford judicial sys
tem is undergoing recon
struction. To handle this enor
mous task, President Gerhard
Casper activated the Committee
of 15, a group composed of stu
dents and facuty.
The committee's primary task
is to rewrite Stanford's Judicial
Charter. This document controls
the process by which alleged vio
lators of the Honor Code and the
Fundamental Standard are adju
dicated.
The current system hasn't
been touched in years, and there
are deficiencies that need to be
corrected. With that said, howev
er, it should be noted that our sys
tem doesn't lack positive ele
ments. After all, the fact that the
overwhelming majority of alleged
violators admit to guilt or agree to
the veracity of the facts demon
strates that our system works to a
degree.
The committee, chaired by
Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback,
has been examining the current
Judicial Charter and its processes
since last spring quarter and
should release its final recom
mendation by the start of winter
quarter. From that point, the
committee's recommendation
must be approved by the Faculty
Senate, the ASSU Senate and
Casper.
To ensure the best possible out
come, the committee should heed
the following points during its
final months of deliberation:
• The current process can take
as little time as two days or as
much as one year to complete
cases. This is unacceptable. Stu
dents are typically only here for
four years and, regardless of guilt
or innocence, should not have to
endure such a lengthy waiting

period. Efforts to embellish the
process with new additions should
consider the amount of time
involved.
• The judicial process at Stan
ford has not only been a punitive
system; it has been an education
al experience. This element
should be enhanced by establish
ing a more substantial role for the
complainant throughout the
entire adjudication process, not
only for the benefit of the accuser,
but also for the benefit of the
accused. More importantly, the
educational aspect must be rein
forced and not diminished in the
new charter.
• Throughout all these revi
sions the committee should
adhere to the most important
guiding principle — the protec
tion of students' rights.
Right now, any student charged
with a violation of the Honor
Code or the Fundamental Stan
dard must be proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt, just
as in the American criminal jus
tice system. In order to protect
the innocent, this high burden of
proof must be maintained.
And yet, there are those on the
committee and within the admin
istration who would like to see
the burden of proof lowered. That
would be a mistake, especially
given the major opposition to
such a move inside the ASSU.
Tampering with the current proof
level could sabotage the whole
process.
• Finally, the committee must
ensure that all interested stu
dents have the chance to express
their opinions on any proposed
changes. It is the students, after
all, who will be the most affected
by any changes; dorm talks and
campus-wide "town hall" meet
ings should go ahead as planned.
Students must also make the
effort to keep informed about the
proceedings. A healthy campus
dialogue about the proposed
changes would benefit all parties
involved and would be education
al in its own right.
