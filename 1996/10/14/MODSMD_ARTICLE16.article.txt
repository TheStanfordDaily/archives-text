## Walking in a biker's world 
### 
RECENTLY, I WAS in an accident
involving a bicycle. I am a pedes
trian commuter, and I always
considered myself to be immune from
the perils of bicycle commuting. But
like so many others, I have become a
casualty of Stanford's cyclists.
I was casually strolling by the Book
store when the crowd of bicyclists in
front of me parted, and a dredlocked
guy on a child's BMX barreled through
the gap into my left thigh. From the
ground, I looked up just in time to see
him grab his bike and speed off towards
the Quad with the call of "Sorry, dude."
Ah, sincerity.
The aggressive sense of punctuality
displayed by Stanford's bikers has
claimed many innocent victims over the
years. Their lack of consideration for
the common commuter is abhorrent,
although somewhat understandable.
You see, I myself was once a speed
freak, rushing blindly to class like a
spawning salmon.
When I owned a bike, I would pull it
off the rack every morning and peddle
like it was a garage sale. Yessir, I was
Mad Max on a 10-speed â€” jumping
curbs, plowing through tour groups and
kicking over lowly Rollerbladers. A sea
of devastation in my wake, I was
assured the best seat in the back of
class. I was never late, and no mortal
could hinder my daily quest for prompt
ness . . . well, except for the one who
stole my bike.

Without a bicycle or means to pur
chase a new one, I began walking to
class. At first walking seemed a horrible
fate. I tried to put on my "biking face"
and racewalk around campus, but even
a fast walking pace seemed glacial in
relation to the incredible velocity of the
bicycle.
As my hopes for making the trip
from the Row to class in under 5 min
utes faded, I started walking slower. I
began looking around and taking in the
surroundings. One day my natural
instinct to leave my room exactly 10
minutes before I needed to be some
where disappeared, and my departure
pattern changed.
Leaving up to 25 minutes before an
on-campus obligation, I suddenly had
time to reflect on life, stop along the
way and visit with friends, sit down and
read the paper, or what have you.
I realized that there are 24 hours in
the day, and that spending one or two of
them in the relaxed state induced by
walking was a good, healthy thing.
Today, I look up at the steely-faced
bicyclists racing off to the Chem Lab
and laugh to myself. If they only knew
about the joys of walking. Unfortunate
ly, these derelicts are the ones who are
least likely to be reading this column,
and they're probably late to a very
important study date at Stern anyway.
Still, the rest of you should seriously
consider walking. As pedestrians, you
will avoid the hassle of maintaining,

locking, polishing, registering and ulti
mately losing a bike. You will be
immune from the wet crotch and
muddy butt-stripe that plague bikers on
rainy days. And you won't have to
worry about getting a biking under the
influence violation from Stanford's
overzealous police squad the next time
you're biking home from a Sigma Chi
party.
I know old habits are hard to break,
but walking really is feasible. Tomor
row try walking your bike to class.
You'll still have the security (and
shield) provided by your bicycle, but by
taking steps, you'll be taking a big step
toward becoming a full-fledged pedes
trian.
Eventually, you will be able to take
short trips around campus without the
bike. Maybe one day you will even be
able to make a clean break from the
insanity that is bicycling.
While I recommend ditching your
bike, you might want to hang onto that
helmet of yours, because as long as
there are stressed-out pre-meds and
slackers who like to sit in the back,
Stanfordites will be susceptible to the
reckless endangerment of wild cyclists.

lock guy.
