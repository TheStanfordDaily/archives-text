Student decries 6 the new Puritanism 9 on the Farm

AFTER TWO YEARS in the Greek
system, I'm more or less used to
being disappointed by the Greek
Affairs Council. So I was disappointed,
but not surprised, to learn that Heather
Dunn (assistant director of the Office of
Student Activities) had phoned the police
about minors being served alcohol at a
few fraternities parties early this quarter.
What I am disappointed to discover is
that the anonymous tip that prompted
Dunn to call the police was not actually
from Director of Student Activities Nanci
Howe — the most famous "anonymous"

phone caller of them all — but rather that
this information had come from a couple
of freshmen who were "upset" to see this
drinking.
This makes absolutely no sense at all
to me. What, precisely, are freshmen who
are going to be offended by drinking doing
at a parties widely known to feature alco
hol as a significant part of the festivities?
It's not as if Greek drinking is a big secret.
Instead, I have the feeling that this is
part of the new Puritanism that seems to
be so popular among the young and newly
admitted. If they see something that

offends them, they report it. Well, that's
fine and good, so long as they aren't out
deliberately looking for things to offend
them and to complain about — which
seems to be precisely what they did at
those parties.
To all the new Puritans out there, let
me tell you something. Moral worth is not
determined by how offended you have
been by others' crass insensitivity (which,
in this case, consisted of the deplorable
measure of throwing a party for the cam
pus' enjoyment). Nor is the path towards
righteousness found by imposing your

morality on others.
I'm sure you new Puritans are des
tined to have great careers at Stanford;
God knows that there are plenty of majors
ready to foster your perpetual moral out
rage. But once you hit the business world,
you'll find that flexibility and tolerance
will get you further than a diet of perpet
ual political correctness.
As I said, I'm not used to being disap
pointed by Stanford students. But I won't
be surprised if I am.
