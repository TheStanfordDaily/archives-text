# Office of Development happy with recognition for fund-raising efforts

I was gratified to read your Tuesday
editorial, "Priceless donations." On
behalf of the Office of Development, I
would like to thank you for drawing such
useful attention to Stanford's ongoing
need for alumni support.
Stanford has indeed been fortunate to
receive a few extraordinary large gifts for
buildings and endowment, such as those

you noted from William Hewlett and
David Packard. At the same time, howev
er, we most critically need a sustained
flow of smaller, annual gifts from alumni.
Taken together, these less spectacular
gifts amount to vital core support for
undergraduate education as well as for
undergraduate scholarships and gradu
ate fellowships.
Every current student will soon
become an alumna or alumnus — and
therefore a prospect either for The Stan
ford Fund or for one of the graduate
school programs if she or he earned an
advanced degree.
Our former students thereby come to

do their part for current students, and so
on. The recent success at increasing par
ticipation among graduating seniors
bodes well in this regard. Participation
among members of the Class of '93 was
only 8 percent. But thanks to the Peter
Bing Challenge, it rose to 45 percent
among members of the Class of '94, to 52
percent among the Class of '95, to 58 per
cent among the Class of '96, and we hope
that the Class of '97 will set its sights
even higher.
The development staff works hard
each day to generate gifts for various
University programs. We don't do so to
raise Stanford's standings in the U.S.

News & World Report. Rather, we under
stand the real costs of excellence, and we
believe deeply that Stanford's excellence
must be made available to all deserving
students.
As testament to our own commitment,
more than 95 percent of the alumni on
staff (and there are many) were Stanford
donors themselves last year. I therefore
cannot overstate how uplifting it is to
have The Daily's support — and, by
extension, that of Stanford's students as
well.
