# Rats may have caused outage

Wayward rodents may be to
blame for the power outage that
left the campus dark for four
hours Thursday night.
The outage also led to continu
ing disruptions to electricity, air
conditioning and computer ac
cess on Friday and shut down In
ternet access for a host of Silicon
Valley companies.
"We're still speculating, but
our understanding is that the
damage was caused by rodents in
the switch gear," said Robert
Reid, University energy manag
er. "We found several fried, dead
rats that appeared to have en
tered through underground con
duits."
The two rats found in the
switch gear compartments were
exposed to extreme temperature
and voltage. Even the copper on
the 12,000-volt switch gear was
vaporized.
This incident was not the first
time rodents have been a source
of trouble. In the past, rats have
chewed through communication
cables and have been involved
with other electrical failures at
the University, Reid said.
This, however, was first time
such a major outage has occurred
since the cogenerator became the
main power source for the cam
pus in 1988.
Conduits are often filled with
urethane foam insulation to pre
vent rodents and water from get
ting into the them, but those

leading into the failed switch gear
appeared to have no such insula
tion, Reid said. Facility engineers
are looking into the matter.
"We're not sure why the insu
lation was left out," Reid said.
"Either it was left out, or it was
intentionally not designed."
One reason for not installing
the insulation may have been be
cause foam restricts access to
components of the switch gear,
making it more difficult for re
pairs to be completed.

Other theories about the cause
of the failure center around a pos
sible faulty switch or power
surge. The University has
brought in an independent com
pany to make a more formal
analysis, according to Reid.
Stanford suffered its initial
blackout Thursday at 7:26 p.m. A
second power outage occurred
Friday at 5:49 a.m. when another
switch gear failed, according to


Sam Mankiewicz — Daily
An electrocuted rat lies next to an underground conduit at the Car
dinal Cogeneration Facility Friday. The rat, which officials suspect
got into a switch gear through the conduit, may have been the
cause of a power outage that hit the campus Thursday.
Facility Engineer Stephen
Briscombe.
Unlike the first one, the second
blackout only affected two-thirds
of the campus. Power was com
pletely restored at 4:16 p.m. Fri
day, said Briscombe.
After initially running on elec
tricity supplied by Pacific Gas and
Electric for a brief interval after
the first blackout, the campus has
returned to its normal source of
power.
Both the Central Energy Facili
ty, which provides chilled water,
and the Cardinal Cogeneration Fa
cility, which generates steam and
electricity, became operational
again at 10 a.m. Friday. However,
the campus will remain in a "Phase
Three" mode of chilled water cur
tailment until 2 p.m. today.
Phase Three restricts use of
campus air-conditioning. "All
comfort cooling — cooling for
teaching facilities — is curtailed,"
Reid said. "All cooling that causes
short-term disruption to research
has also been curtailed."
Chilled water was never taken
away from the Stanford Medical
Center or the animal holding facil
ities. However, after the initial
power outage, the hospital went
without steam for six hours and
chilled water for 18 hours.
The extent of the damage done
to the switch gears is significant.
Reid estimated the repair costs to
be about $200,000.
"That's just a rough estimate,"
he said.
Currently, the Central Energy
Facility — which produces chilled
water for the campus — has
brought in two generators to sup
ply its power until all the repairs to
the cogenerator can be completed.
Reid said the process will take at
least two weeks because "major re

construction" may be in order.
"The plant typically goes out of
service twice a year," Reid said.
"One is a scheduled outage. We
typically account for one (unex
pected) trip per year."
The cogeneration plant is at a
much higher availability than
most others.
"We are available 98 percent of
the time," Reid said. Most cogen
eration plants have only 90 per
cent to 92 percent availability, ei
ther due to problems or scheduled
maintenance.
One of the more noticeable in
conveniences caused by the power
outage was the shutdown of e-mail
and other networking services.
According to Sandra Senti, di
rector of Networking Systems, e
mail went down immediately after
the first power outage. It was not
completely restored until about 5
p.m. Friday. Sweet Hall does not
have a backup system.
"Although it doesn't look like
we lost any e-mail," Senti said,
"some did get bounced back to the
sender."
The power outage also affected
the Palo Alto branch of BBN
Corp., which provides Internet ac
cess to more than 400 Silicon Val
ley customers, most of which are
high-tech companies. Genentech,
Hewlett-Packard, Apple and Sili
con Graphics were among the af
fected customers. The online edi
tions of the Los Angeles Times, the
San Francisco Chronicle and the
San Francisco Examiner were also
out of service.
Facility engineers will meet
with Director of Facility Opera
tions Chris Christofferson next
week for a "lessons-learned con
ference," said Briscombe.
The meeting "will have a dual
purpose," he said. "One will be to
determine what the cause was so
we can correct that area. The other
is to pick up all other things to im
prove the reliability of service. It's
not a simple answer."
