# Rats may have caused outage

Wayward rodents may be to
blame for the power outage that
left the campus dark for four
hours Thursday night.
The outage also led to continu
ing disruptions to electricity, air
conditioning and computer ac
cess on Friday and shut down In
ternet access for a host of Silicon
Valley companies.
"We're still speculating, but
our understanding is that the
damage was caused by rodents in
the switch gear," said Robert
Reid, University energy manag
er. "We found several fried, dead
rats that appeared to have en
tered through underground con
duits."
The two rats found in the
switch gear compartments were
exposed to extreme temperature
and voltage. Even the copper on
the 12,000-volt switch gear was
vaporized.
This incident was not the first
time rodents have been a source
of trouble. In the past, rats have
chewed through communication
cables and have been involved
with other electrical failures at
the University, Reid said.
This, however, was first time
such a major outage has occurred
since the cogenerator became the
main power source for the cam
pus in 1988.
Conduits are often filled with
urethane foam insulation to pre
vent rodents and water from get
ting into the them, but those

leading into the failed switch gear
appeared to have no such insula
tion, Reid said. Facility engineers
are looking into the matter.
"We're not sure why the insu
lation was left out," Reid said.
"Either it was left out, or it was
intentionally not designed."
One reason for not installing
the insulation may have been be
cause foam restricts access to
components of the switch gear,
making it more difficult for re
pairs to be completed.

Other theories about the cause
of the failure center around a pos
sible faulty switch or power
surge. The University has
brought in an independent com
pany to make a more formal
analysis, according to Reid.
Stanford suffered its initial
blackout Thursday at 7:26 p.m. A
second power outage occurred
Friday at 5:49 a.m. when another
switch gear failed, according to

An electrocuted rat lies next to an underground conduit at the Car
dinal Cogeneration Facility Friday. The rat, which officials suspect
got into a switch gear through the conduit, may have been the
cause of a power outage that hit the campus Thursday.
