## It's time to banish race from the admissions process 
### 
Proposition 209, the so
called California Civil Rights Ini
tiative, will appear on Califor
nia's Nov. 5 ballot. About as straight
forward as propositions come, Prop. 209
simply states: "The state shall not dis
criminate against, or grant preferential
treatment to, any individual or group
on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity
or national origin in the operation of
public employment, public education, or
public contracting."
Most would agree that racial discrim
ination is wrong. However, when racial
discrimination is used in university
admissions, many say, "Well, that's just
affirmative action." Affirmative action
was originally designed to ensure equal
opportunity for all people, including
qualified minority job applicants. It
explicitly condemned racial preferences
and quotas.
Over the years, this noble design has
been distorted to justify race-based
decisions in hiring and college admis

sions. Prop. 209 would do nothing to
harm affirmative action as it was origi
nally intended. Based on the 1964 Civil
Rights Act, Prop. 209 would strengthen
the laws against racial discrimination,
ensuring equal opportunity for all peo
ple.
Race is a physical trait; something
that no one has control over. Physical
traits do not equal individual achieve
ment. Yet, universities in California
and across the country continue to con
tradict this obvious truth by making
membership within a certain racial
group, rather than individual merit, the
deciding factor in the admissions pro
cess.
Administrators at the University of
California system claim that they no
longer use racial preferences in admis
sions. This, however, is simply not true.
According to Ward Connerly, UC
regent and chair of the CCRI campaign,
UC admissions committees assign
points to each applicant for predeter

mined categories such as grades,
extracurricular activities and SAT
scores. They then have the option of
giving each applicant up to 900 "bonus"
points for whatever reason they find
compelling.
This "reason" is often the race of the
applicant. Since UC schools are limited
in space, the use of racial bonuses by
UC admissions offices often means that
a less qualified applicant with a racial
bonus is admitted while a more quali
fied applicant without one is rejected.
As Eugene Voloch, a constitutional
law professor at UCLA and a supporter
of the California Civil Rights Initiative
has said, "You can't prefer one person
on the basis of race or ethnicity without
penalizing someone else on that basis."
Affirmative action was designed to
ensure equality of opportunity, not
equality of result. University admis
sions offices have twisted affirmative
action in an effort to ensure equality of
result, and they have failed. Due to the

discriminatory admissions process at
public schools, an unqualified applicant
and a qualified one may both experience
the "equal" result of getting into col
lege, but this is where the equal results
stop. Often, the unqualified applicant
must complete several remedial courses
before even being able to deal with col
lege level study. Instead of focusing on
admission to college as the great equal
izer, we should be focusing on equaliz
ing elementary and secondary educa
tion where preparation for college
occurs.
Advocates of race-based admissions
policies insult and degrade minority
groups and women with their assump
tion that these groups have limited abil
ity and that the only way they will ever
be able to compete is with a helping
hand.
Race is not a handicap and is in no
way related to ability. Prop. 209 does
nothing to limit the chances of minori
ties or women and reaffirms the fact

that ability comes from hard work, dis
cipline and persistence, all three of
which are completely colorblind.
Universities should look at how
applicants have utilized the resources
available to them. This would ensure
that underprivileged applicants get a
fair shot. Resource utilization is
infinitely more accurate as a predictor
of how an applicant will perform in col
lege than race, because how one has
used available resources reflects indi
vidual achievement. Prop. 209 takes
race out of the college admissions equa
tion and puts the individual back in. On
Nov. 5, vote yes on Prop. 209, and
affirm that you're an individual not a
race.
