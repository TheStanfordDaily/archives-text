Obscene caller returns
Since Oct. 1, at least 10 female students have reported to Stan
ford Police that they received obscene phone calls.
A caller who often identifies himself as "Oscar" has been calling
Stanford students for at least two years, said Stanford Police Cap
tain Raoul Niemeyer.
"It's either the same individual or copycats," Niemeyer said.
The individual often makes calls early in the morning and asks
for the women he reaches by name. Niemeyer said it's possible that
the caller tries various numbers in advance until he gets an an
swering machine with a female voice giving her name.
"We suggest that you don't give your name on messages,"
Niemeyer said.
Detectives nab bike thief
Stanford Police detectives tracked down 21-year-old Joshua
Emert after he allegedly stole a $395 bike from the Campus Bike
Shop Oct. 5, Stanford Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer said.
Emert went to the Bike Shop and asked tottapk p a Diamond
Back Topanga bike for a test ride, leaving his backpack as collat
eral, Niemeyer said. Emert took off on the bike and never re
turned.
After the owner of the bike shop called the police, Detectives Tim
Schreiner and Allen James found an algebra book in the backpack
and called around to local high schools, according to Niemeyer.
Eventually, detectives were led to Emert. At first, Emert denied
stealing the bike. Detectives then asked him to accompany them to
the bike shop so that he could be eliminated as a suspect.
"He confessed in the car on the way there," Niemeyer said.
Emert was then taken to the police station for booking at which
point detectives discovered that there were $6,000 in traffic war
rants under his name.
