### David Felman 
The Stanford Alumni Association honored
the lifetime achievements of five minority
alumni and faculty members Friday as part of
Reunion Homecoming Weekend.
The multicultural reception marked the
second year that honorees were inducted into
the "Minority Hall of Fame." The leaders of
each of the four main ethnic centers on campus
— African American, Asian American, Chi
cano / Latino and Native American — induct
ed honorees from their respective communi
ties.
Event sponsors said they hoped to give Stan
ford's ethnic communities an opportunity to
celebrate the contributions th 1 honorees have
made to campus life, while at the same time
promoting a sense of cohesiveness among all
Stanford alumni.
"I think this a wonderful way ... to remind
current students about alumni who have faced
many complexities in coming to Stanford," said
Bill Stone, president of the alumni association.
The Black Community Services Center hon
ored James Gibbs, the first African-American
tenured professor at Stanford. Gibbs has
taught anthropology at the University since
1966, later becoming the first Martin Luther
King Jr. Centennial Professor and earning the
Alan Cox Medal for service to undergraduate
research.
In addition, Gibbs was the first dean of un
dergraduate studies, served as chair of the An
thropology Department and acted as co-direc

tor of the Stanford-Berkeley Joint Center for
African Studies.
"I felt particularly honored to be selected by
the black community as an inductee," Gibbs
said. "It's really very exciting because 30 years
ago when I first came | to Stanford!, there were
very few minorities. Now the minority student
population is 45 percent. This signifies the
changing face of the University and of the
American population as a whole."
Representing the Chicano / Latino commu
nity on campus, El Centro Chicano honored
two alumni, Helen Gertrude Dominguez and
Margarita Espinosa. Dominguez was the first
Latina student to graduate from Stanford. She
received her bachelor's in English in 1920.
Espinosa enrolled as a transfer student in
1924. In 1994, Espinosa received the Award for
Lifetime Achievement from the Senior Center
in Palo Alto for her contributions to society.
Now 90 years old, Espinosa is an active fund
raiser for Stanford.
The Asian American Activities Center rec
ognized Yamato Ichihashi, Stanford's first
Asian-American professor. Ichihashi helped to
establish Stanford as a principal center of
teaching and research in Asian studies in the
United States. His mentor, David Starr Jor
dan, Stanford's first president, persuaded Ichi
hashi to teach at Stanford in 1913 despite Ichi
hashi's fear of anti-Japanese sentiment in the
country.
In 1942, however, Ichihashi became a victim
of the anti-Japanese hysteria during the war
and was incarcerated at Tule Lake Relocation

Center. He documented his internment experi
ences in his hook, "Morning Glory, Evening
Shadow."
The Native American community honored
Woesha Cloud North, an accomplished artist,
poet and educator, who received a master's in
education from Stanford. North, a member of
the Winnebago / Chippewa tribe, and nearly a
dozen members of her family represent the first
Native American legacy at Stanford. Three
daughters, three sons-in-law, three grandchil
dren, a grand-niece and a grand-nephew ail
have attended the University, the most recent
matriculating in the fall of 1992.
In addition to the induction ceremony, Uni
versity Trustee Roger Clay — who was one of
the founders of the Stanford Black Alumni As
sociation — spoke about the Oct. 10 release of
the Task Force on Minority Alumni Relations
Report, a two-year study on minority alumni
engagement and involvement.
Focusing on the link between student expe
rience, alumni perceptions and institutional
leadership, the report made several recommen
dations for improvements.
Speaking about the report at the reception,
University President Gerhard Casper said, "I
am taking this report very seriously ... as it
poses questions about minority alumni rela
tions and minority relations."
"I am delighted this afternoon that we have
a sense of family and community," Casper said
later in the afternoon. He commented that "it is
just amazing that there is a family here that has
such a legacy."
