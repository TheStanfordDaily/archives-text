## Kirwan defines moment 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
There are certain defining mo
ments in sports that live forever.
They result in plays that subsume
the outcomes of ball games, plays
that people remember much longer
than the games they occurred in;
plays that define an athlete and
often defme a season.
Some players have defined such
moments — Joe Carter winning
the World Series with a ninth-in
ning home run, Joe Montana hit
ting John Taylor with less than a
minute to go to win the Super Bowl
and Michael Jordan hitting a jump
shot to lift his North Carolina Tar
Heels to their first-ever champi
onship under Dean Smith.
Other players have let the mo
ments define them. No one has for
gotten Bill Buckner's error or
Chris Webber's timeout or Scott
Norwood's missed field goal.
So when the clock showed 1
minute, 30 seconds left in Satur
day's game and the Stanford of
fense came to its own 35-yard line,
facing a fourth and 12 while trailing
Oregon 24-21, everyone knew it
was a defining moment for the Car
dinal.
"I think a lot of people knew our
season was on the line on that
play," said senior running back
Mike Mitchell. Mitchell was right
— a failed conversion would have
meant a 1-4 record (0-2 in the Pa
cific 10 Conference) and the near
certainty of a bowl-less season.
Hutchinson dropped back to
pass and was immediately flushed
out of the pocket to the left. The
play was quickly starting to resem
ble many of the unanswered
prayers of Cardinal teams of the
past; it was beginning to look like
another tough loss and another

week of saying, "We were so close."
The moment was seemingly
going to define the team.
Hutchinson, under pressure,
aired one out. He threw a high,
tight spiral — Stanford's conser
vatism on offense now gone, the
squad was going for the win. The
pass was thrown in the direction of
senior flanker Andre Kirwan, who
had started the game in place of se
nior Brian Manning, and Oregon
cornerback Kenny Wheaton, ar
guably the best cover man in the
Pac-10.
"I didn't feel any pressure; I had
been there before," said Kirwan,
who finished with five catches for

80 yards. "You dream about your
number being called, and then you
have to step up and make plays."
The team was going to define
the moment.
Kirwan and Wheaton seemed to
bump each other all the way down
the left sideline. At the last mo
ment before the ball got there, Kir
wan turned, leaped and came down
with the ball.
"I came off the ball and he was
pushing me — I actually thought
he pushed me out of bounds," Kir
wan said. "I was thinking, 'Just
concentrate, concentrate, concen
trate,' and I looked back and saw
the ball and just came down with

And when Kirwan came down
with the ball, everyone — Cardinal
players and fans alike — knew it
was something special.
"Chad was flushed a bit on that
play, he stepped out of the pocket
and launched it and Andre just
fought for the ball and made one
hell of a catch," said head coach Ty
rone Willingham.
"I was just praying to God, 'Help
us out on this one, 'cause we really
need it,' " Hutchinson said. "Andre
is a great receiver — we have a
bunch of great receivers. I have

confidence in everyone out there,
but Andre did come up big for us."
Following the catch, junior kick

er Kevin Miller booted a 25-yard
field goal to send the game into
overtime. In overtime, after junior
Kailee Wong forced Oregon quar
terback Tony Graziani to fumble,
Miller sealed the win.
Not to take anything away from
the rest of the team, or the players

who made the big plays, but what
people will remember about the
game is The Catch.
"This is a game that can turn
our whole season around,"
Hutchinson said after the game.
