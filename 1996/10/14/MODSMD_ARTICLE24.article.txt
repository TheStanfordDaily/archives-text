# Victory at last!
## Comeback leads to overtime win 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
All week long, Saturday's
matchup between Stanford and
Oregon was tabbed a must-win
game for two struggling squads.
After trailing 24-14 in the fourth
quarter, senior wide receiver Andre
Kirwan hauled in a must-catch des
peration bomb and redshirt sopho
more Kevin Miller converted two
must-make field goals to give the
Cardinal a required 27-24 victory.
After tying the game with just
under a minute left in regulation,
the Cardinal (2-3, 1-1 Pacific 10
Conference) earned its first Pac-10
win of the year when Miller con
nected on a 27-yard field goal at
tempt in the first-ever overtime
contest in Stanford history.
"You really can't ask for any
thing more," Miller said. "That was
a kicker's dream."
Miller's game-winner was set up
by a defensive stop by the Cardinal.
On first and goal from the 10-yard
line, Stanford junior defensive end
Kailee Wong, a Eugene native,
stripped Oregon quarterback Tony
Graziani from behind, and junior
tackle Carl Hansen's recovery gave
the Cardinal offense and Miller the
chance to win.
Were it not for Kirwan's heroics,
however, the game would have
ended in regulation with a very dif
ferent outcome. The Cardinal got
the ball with just under 3 minutes
left in regulation, facing a 24-21
deficit. On first down, the Duck de
fense sacked redshirt freshman
quarterback Chad Hutchinson for a
14-yard loss. An incomplete pass
and a Troy Walters reception left
the Cardinal at fourth and 12 on its
own 35-yard line.
Forced out of the pocket by the
Oregon pass rush, Hutchinson

rolled left and launched a prayer
downfleld across his body in the di
rection of Kirwan. Battling with
Duck cornerback Kenny Wheaton,
a second team All-American, Kir
wan came down with a 49-yard re
ception and a breath of new life for
the Cardinal.
"The biggest thing was the play
by Andre Kirwan," Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham said.
"The catch he made in an almost
desperate situation really bailed us
out."
Four plays later, Miller booted a
25-yard field goal to send the game
into overtime.
"It didn't bother me one bit to
have him in that position," Willing
ham said of his kicker. "We've got a
lot of confidence in Kevin and he is
doing an outstanding job."
For at least 15 minutes when it
mattered most, the Cardinal made
Stanford Stadium goers forget
about its offensive woes. In the
fourth quarter alone, Stanford
racked up 243 yards of offense and
most importantly, put 17 points on
the board.
"I think we were still able to do
some of things we were able to do
early in the ball game," Willingham
said. "In the fourth quarter, we still
did not forsake our run game be
cause we thought our guys were
doing a pretty good job there."
In fact, it was the ground game
that began the offensive explosion.
Senior running back Mike Mitchell
turned a seemingly harmless sec
ond-down handofT into a 42-yard
touchdown run, his second of the
afternoon.
"Mike has really put together
two good weeks for us," Willingham
said. "He did a fine job up at Wash
ington, and he came m today and
did some tough running. That
breakaway that gave us a touch
down really gave us a spark."

But Oregon answered the Stan
ford resurrection immediately. Ju
nior Pat Johnson returned the en
suing kickoff 95 yards for a score,
putting the Oregon lead back at 10.
Despite the momentum shift,
the Cardinal put together an im

pressive five-play, 73-yard touch
down drive which culminated in a
Hutchinson strike to junior wide
out Damon Dunn. Hutchinson,
who finished the game with 27 com
pletions in 41 attempts for 365
yards and a touchdown, completed

four of five attempts on the drive.
Perhaps more important than a
solid passing performance by
Hutchinson, the Cardinal saw the
return of its rushing attack.
Mitchell added 123 yards on 21 car
ries to his two touchdown runs, and
his first-quarter, 6-yard score broke
the Cardinal's streak of 10 consecu
tive quarters without a touchdown.
"I think we all knew we could
run the ball," Mitchell said. "We
knew we had the talent on the of
fensive line to do it. It was just a
matter of doing it consistently. It
was more about us making bad
plays. Today, the offensive line real
ly came to play."
For the offense, scoring almost
immediately was more significant
than just the seven points.
"Scoring on that first drive was
really important," Hutchinson
said. "It got us rolling. We know
that we can drive on people, but it
gave us a lot of confidence."
While pleased with the rushing
performance, Willingham was
more satisfied with the outcome.
"The key for me is to win," Will
ingham said. "If we gained 5 yards
on the ground, I'm not going to be
happy. But we have said it since we
arrived — we want this to be a win
ning program. And today, I thought
our guys performed to a winning
level."
Overshadowed by the return of
the Stanford offense, the defense
once again kept the Cardinal in the

game and gave Hutchinson and
company the opportunity to come
back in the fourth. The Cardinal de
fense began the fourth by forcing
Graziani and the Ducks to punt.
Two tackles for loss by Wong and
junior inside linebacker Jon Hask
ins forced another Oregon punt on
the next series. Stanford held on
Oregon's next two possessions as
well before the Ducks opted to sit on
the ball in their last possession.
Sophomore free safety Tim
Smith came up with two defensive
gems to save the Cardinal from a
bigger fourth-quarter deficit. In the
second quarter, he blocked a 38-
yard Josh Smith field goal try. In
the third, he thwarted an Oregon
touchdown drive by intercepting a
Graziani pass which Haskins got a
hand on in the end zone.
Willingham needed another
solid defensive performance as the
Cardinal offense stalled between
the first-possession touchdown and
the fourth-quarter scoring barrage.
Stanford lost opportunities to
put points on the board in the sec
ond on fourth and goal from the 2, a
fourth and three from the Oregon
27 and a Miller field goal attempt
which sailed wide left.
Miller, who added place-kicking
duties this year in addition to punt
ing, said the 38-yard miss in the
third quarter, along with Willing
ham's decision to go on fourth down
rather than kick a 44-yard field
goal, did not come into play on ei

ther his tying or winning field goal.
"I was mad at myself on the miss
because I didn't adjust for kicking
from the hash," Miller said. "But it
didn't really come into my head on
the other kicks. My head was pretty
clear at the time. I know if I take the
right steps, the ball will be there."
The Stanford offense set season
highs in a number of crucial cate
gories including total yards (514),
points scored (27), first downs (25),
total plays (80), net rushing yards
(149) and net passing yards (365).
The lone Cardinal turnover came
on a surprise squib kick by Oregon
to open the second half.
"This gives us quite a bit of con
fidence," said Hutchinson. "As an
offense, we are really young so scor
ing points and coming back no mat
ter what the deficit is important for
our offense."
While the Cardinal showed
flashes of offensive potential and
the defense continued to perform,
what is perhaps even more impres
sive to Willingham was the display
of character.
"I really don't think we dodged a
buliet," he said. "I think our foot
ball team came and fought very
hard. The way they fought, that in
and of itself gave them a chance to
be victorious. I think our guys
fought hard and deserved a win."
The loss marks the fourth
straight defeat for Oregon (3-4,0-4)
as the Ducks virtually fell out of the
race for a Pac-10 bowl bid.

Graziani and the Ducks to punt.
Two tackles for loss by Wong and
junior inside linebacker Jon Hask
ins forced another Oregon punt on
the next series. Stanford held on
Oregon's next two possessions as
well before the Ducks opted to sit on
the ball in their last possession.
Sophomore free safety Tim
Smith came up with two defensive
gems to save the Cardinal from a
bigger fourth-quarter deficit. In the
second quarter, he blocked a 38-
yard Josh Smith field goal try. In
the third, he thwarted an Oregon
touchdown drive by intercepting a
Graziani pass which Haskins got a
hand on in the end zone.
Willingham needed another
solid defensive performance as the
Cardinal offense stalled between
the first-possession touchdown and
the fourth-quarter scoring barrage.
Stanford lost opportunities to
put points on the board in the sec
ond on fourth and goal from the 2, a
fourth and three from the Oregon
27 and a Miller field goal attempt
which sailed wide left.
Miller, who added place-kicking
duties this year in addition to punt
ing, said the 38-yard miss in the
third quarter, along with Willing
ham's decision to go on fourth down
rather than kick a 44-yard field
goal, did not come into play on ei

ther his tying or winning field goal.
"I was mad at myself on the miss
because I didn't adjust for kicking
from the hash," Miller said. "But it
didn't really come into my head on
the other kicks. My head was pretty
clear at the time. I know if I take the
right steps, the ball will be there."
The Stanford offense set season
highs in a number of crucial cate
gories including total yards (514),
points scored (27), first downs (25),
total plays (80), net rushing yards
(149) and net passing yards (365).
The lone Cardinal turnover came
on a surprise squib kick by Oregon
to open the second half.
"This gives us quite a bit of con
fidence," said Hutchinson. "As an
offense, we are really young so scor
ing points and coming back no mat
ter what the deficit is important for
our offense."
While the Cardinal showed
flashes of offensive potential and
the defense continued to perform,
what is perhaps even more impres
sive to Willingham was the display
of character.
"I really don't think we dodged a
buliet," he said. "I think our foot
ball team came and fought very
hard. The way they fought, that in
and of itself gave them a chance to
be victorious. I think our guys
fought hard and deserved a win."
The loss marks the fourth
straight defeat for Oregon (3-4,0-4)
as the Ducks virtually fell out of the
race for a Pac-10 bowl bid.

Senior running back Mike Mitchell breaks through the Duck defense to run 42 yards for the touchdown.
Mitchell gained a season-high 121 yards on the ground.
All week long, Saturday's
matchup between Stanford and
Oregon was tabbed a must-win
game for two struggling squads.
After trailing 24-14 in the fourth
quarter, senior wide receiver Andre
Kirwan hauled in a must-catch des
peration bomb and redshirt sopho
more Kevin Miller converted two
must-make field goals to give the
Cardinal a required 27-24 victory.
After tying the game with just
under a minute left in regulation,
the Cardinal (2-3, 1-1 Pacific 10
Conference) earned its first Pac-10
win of the year when Miller con
nected on a 27-yard field goal at
tempt in the first-ever overtime
contest in Stanford history.
"You really can't ask for any
thing more," Miller said. "That was
a kicker's dream."
Miller's game-winner was set up
by a defensive stop by the Cardinal.
On first and goal from the 10-yard
line, Stanford junior defensive end
Kailee Wong, a Eugene native,
stripped Oregon quarterback Tony
Graziani from behind, and junior
tackle Carl Hansen's recovery gave
the Cardinal offense and Miller the
chance to win.
Were it not for Kirwan's heroics,
however, the game would have
ended in regulation with a very dif
ferent outcome. The Cardinal got
the ball with just under 3 minutes
left in regulation, facing a 24-21
deficit. On first down, the Duck de
fense sacked redshirt freshman
quarterback Chad Hutchinson for a
14-yard loss. An incomplete pass
and a Troy Walters reception left
the Cardinal at fourth and 12 on its
own 35-yard line.
Forced out of the pocket by the
Oregon pass rush, Hutchinson

rolled left and launched a prayer
downfleld across his body in the di
rection of Kirwan. Battling with
Duck cornerback Kenny Wheaton,
a second team All-American, Kir
wan came down with a 49-yard re
ception and a breath of new life for
the Cardinal.
"The biggest thing was the play
by Andre Kirwan," Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham said.
"The catch he made in an almost
desperate situation really bailed us
out."
Four plays later, Miller booted a
25-yard field goal to send the game
into overtime.
"It didn't bother me one bit to
have him in that position," Willing
ham said of his kicker. "We've got a
lot of confidence in Kevin and he is
doing an outstanding job."
For at least 15 minutes when it
mattered most, the Cardinal made
Stanford Stadium goers forget
about its offensive woes. In the
fourth quarter alone, Stanford
racked up 243 yards of offense and
most importantly, put 17 points on
the board.
"I think we were still able to do
some of things we were able to do
early in the ball game," Willingham
said. "In the fourth quarter, we still
did not forsake our run game be
cause we thought our guys were
doing a pretty good job there."
In fact, it was the ground game
that began the offensive explosion.
Senior running back Mike Mitchell
turned a seemingly harmless sec
ond-down handofT into a 42-yard
touchdown run, his second of the
afternoon.
"Mike has really put together
two good weeks for us," Willingham
said. "He did a fine job up at Wash
ington, and he came m today and
did some tough running. That
breakaway that gave us a touch
down really gave us a spark."

But Oregon answered the Stan
ford resurrection immediately. Ju
nior Pat Johnson returned the en
suing kickoff 95 yards for a score,
putting the Oregon lead back at 10.
Despite the momentum shift,
the Cardinal put together an im

pressive five-play, 73-yard touch
down drive which culminated in a
Hutchinson strike to junior wide
out Damon Dunn. Hutchinson,
who finished the game with 27 com
pletions in 41 attempts for 365
yards and a touchdown, completed

four of five attempts on the drive.
Perhaps more important than a
solid passing performance by
Hutchinson, the Cardinal saw the
return of its rushing attack.
Mitchell added 123 yards on 21 car
ries to his two touchdown runs, and
his first-quarter, 6-yard score broke
the Cardinal's streak of 10 consecu
tive quarters without a touchdown.
"I think we all knew we could
run the ball," Mitchell said. "We
knew we had the talent on the of
fensive line to do it. It was just a
matter of doing it consistently. It
was more about us making bad
plays. Today, the offensive line real
ly came to play."
For the offense, scoring almost
immediately was more significant
than just the seven points.
"Scoring on that first drive was
really important," Hutchinson
said. "It got us rolling. We know
that we can drive on people, but it
gave us a lot of confidence."
While pleased with the rushing
performance, Willingham was
more satisfied with the outcome.
"The key for me is to win," Will
ingham said. "If we gained 5 yards
on the ground, I'm not going to be
happy. But we have said it since we
arrived — we want this to be a win
ning program. And today, I thought
our guys performed to a winning
level."
Overshadowed by the return of
the Stanford offense, the defense
once again kept the Cardinal in the

game and gave Hutchinson and
company the opportunity to come
back in the fourth. The Cardinal de
fense began the fourth by forcing
Graziani and the Ducks to punt.
Two tackles for loss by Wong and
junior inside linebacker Jon Hask
