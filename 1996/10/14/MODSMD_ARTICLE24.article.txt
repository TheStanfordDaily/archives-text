# Victory at last!
## Comeback leads to overtime win 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
All week long, Saturday's
matchup between Stanford and
Oregon was tabbed a must-win
game for two struggling squads.
After trailing 24-14 in the fourth
quarter, senior wide receiver Andre
Kirwan hauled in a must-catch des
peration bomb and redshirt sopho
more Kevin Miller converted two
must-make field goals to give the
Cardinal a required 27-24 victory.
After tying the game with just
under a minute left in regulation,
the Cardinal (2-3, 1-1 Pacific 10
Conference) earned its first Pac-10
win of the year when Miller con
nected on a 27-yard field goal at
tempt in the first-ever overtime
contest in Stanford history.
"You really can't ask for any
thing more," Miller said. "That was
a kicker's dream."
Miller's game-winner was set up
by a defensive stop by the Cardinal.
On first and goal from the 10-yard
line, Stanford junior defensive end
Kailee Wong, a Eugene native,
stripped Oregon quarterback Tony
Graziani from behind, and junior
tackle Carl Hansen's recovery gave
the Cardinal offense and Miller the
chance to win.
Were it not for Kirwan's heroics,
however, the game would have
ended in regulation with a very dif
ferent outcome. The Cardinal got
the ball with just under 3 minutes
left in regulation, facing a 24-21
deficit. On first down, the Duck de
fense sacked redshirt freshman
quarterback Chad Hutchinson for a
14-yard loss. An incomplete pass
and a Troy Walters reception left
the Cardinal at fourth and 12 on its
own 35-yard line.
Forced out of the pocket by the
Oregon pass rush, Hutchinson

rolled left and launched a prayer
downfleld across his body in the di
rection of Kirwan. Battling with
Duck cornerback Kenny Wheaton,
a second team All-American, Kir
wan came down with a 49-yard re
ception and a breath of new life for
the Cardinal.
"The biggest thing was the play
by Andre Kirwan," Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham said.
"The catch he made in an almost
desperate situation really bailed us
out."
Four plays later, Miller booted a
25-yard field goal to send the game
into overtime.
"It didn't bother me one bit to
have him in that position," Willing
ham said of his kicker. "We've got a
lot of confidence in Kevin and he is
doing an outstanding job."
For at least 15 minutes when it
mattered most, the Cardinal made
Stanford Stadium goers forget
about its offensive woes. In the
fourth quarter alone, Stanford
racked up 243 yards of offense and
most importantly, put 17 points on
the board.
"I think we were still able to do
some of things we were able to do
early in the ball game," Willingham
said. "In the fourth quarter, we still
did not forsake our run game be
cause we thought our guys were
doing a pretty good job there."
In fact, it was the ground game
that began the offensive explosion.
Senior running back Mike Mitchell
turned a seemingly harmless sec
ond-down handofT into a 42-yard
touchdown run, his second of the
afternoon.
"Mike has really put together
two good weeks for us," Willingham
said. "He did a fine job up at Wash
ington, and he came m today and
