## Hockey notches its eighth straight win 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The Cardinal field hockey team
(10-1, 6-1 North Pacific Confer
ence) added two ferocious victories
over Providence and Simon Fraser
of Canada this weekend to mark
their eighth straight win.
In what players described as
"one of the most intense matches
of the season," the Cardinal tri

game against Simon Fraser.
Providence "probably thought
they'll be able to beat us easy," said
sophomore midfielder Jordyn
Kramer. "Although it was a good
game, we didn't play great."
This may be due to the Stan
ford's strategy to keep its playing
