## Hockey notches its eighth straight win 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The Cardinal field hockey team
(10-1, 6-1 North Pacific Confer
ence) added two ferocious victories
over Providence and Simon Fraser
of Canada this weekend to mark
their eighth straight win.
In what players described as
"one of the most intense matches
of the season," the Cardinal tri
umphed over the Providence Fri
ars 2-1 when sophomore forward
Monique Leroux put one in the net
with 52 seconds remaining in the
game.
Leroux's goal, assisted by se
nior tri-captain Baochi Nguyen,
broke the 1-1 tie carried over from
the first half of the game to win the
fierce match for the Cardinal
squad.
"Basically, it was a team effort
throughout the whole game," Ler
oux said. "Everybody really
stepped it up, especially our de
fense. They contained Providence
really well."
According to Leroux, her game
winning goal was a result of a col
lective team effort; the forward
said she "merely tipped it in" after
sophomore forward Carey Cloyd's
calculated pass to Nguyen, who

brought the ball up the field and to
Leroux.
"We knew it'd be a great game
going into it," said freshman for
ward Mallory Chambers, who
scored the first Cardinal goal
against Providence. "And it was a
great game. Both our offense and
defense were incredibly focused."
"I don't think anyone knew
there were only [seconds] left in
the game after [Leroux's goal],"
said junior midfielder Paige
Mader. "Everyone was so fo
cused."
The Friars, who were playing
the Golden Bears after the Cardi
nal match against Simon Fraser
on Saturday, showed up early
enough to observe the Cardinal
game against Simon Fraser.
Providence "probably thought
they'll be able to beat us easy," said
sophomore midfielder Jordyn
Kramer. "Although it was a good
game, we didn't play great."
This may be due to the Stan
ford's strategy to keep its playing
cards faced down throughout the
Simon Fraser match.
"We didn't do the plays we nor
mally do on penalty corners,"
Kramer said. "We tried to show as
little as possible."
This proved crucially effective,
as the Friars were confused by the
Cardinal's unfamiliar offensive
plays.
"It worked really well," Cham
bers said. "They were definitely fo
cused, but they were thrown off."
In the Simon Fraser match,

Stanford led 2-0 at halftime after
Leroux and Cloyd each put one in
the net.
Although the Canadian team
came back in the second half, mo
mentarily tying the game at 2-2,
Cloyd scored her second goal of the
game to clinch the match at 3-2.
The Stanford team has stepped
it up this weekend; it is more confi
dent than ever and ready to take on
the challenges of the skillful East
Coast teams in the upcoming
games.

"Everybody tried really hard
[this weekend]," said sophomore
defender Stephanie Finkelstein.
"Providence was a huge game for
us, and it shows wp can hold our
own against the East Coast
teams."
The Card has created a stir in
the East with it most recent victo
ry over Providence, but its winning
streak may just he the beginning of
a huge storm that will hit the East
Coast when *1 Â° Stanford team
travels there later in the season.
