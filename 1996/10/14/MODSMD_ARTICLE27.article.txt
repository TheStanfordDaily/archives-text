### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
The men's soccer team defeated Oregon State
5-1 on Friday but lost a 1-0 heartbreaker to No. 2
Washington yesterday. Stanford (5-3-3, 1-1-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) dominated
both games, but was unable to convert several
good scoring opportunities against the powerful
Huskies.
Against the Beavers, the Cardinal began the
scoring early when senior midfielder Steve
Kirschbaum scored his first goal of the season.
Though Stanford recorded six shots in the first
half, Kirschbaum's goal was the only scoring be
fore intermission, leaving it 1-0 in favor of the Car
dinal at halftime.
The second half began slowly for Stanford, but
the squad recovered quickly to score three unan
swered goals. Sophomore midfielder Jamie Clark
scored the first of his two goals of the day on a
penalty kick after Beaver goalkeeper Olin Glenne
received a yellow card. Just four minutes later,
Clark struck again, this time assisted by sopho-

more midfielders A.J. Sauer and
Aaron Jones.
Sophomore forward Adam
Siegman got into the action a few
minutes later with his second goal
of the season. Oregon State re
sponded quickly with its only goal
of the day, but the Beavers were
put to rest when Sauer scored his
eighth goal of the season and the
final score of the day for the Car
dinal.
Stanford was unable to dupli
cate its late-game scoring display
of Friday against the Huskies yes
terday. The Cardinal came out
strong, playing aggressively and
surprising Washington, which
looked downbeat from its disap
pointing loss to California on Fri
day.
"We came out so pumped up,
thinking we were going to have a
struggle," said senior Erik Morri
son. "Then we find ourselves

dominating the entire game but
unable to get the victory."
Stanford's best scoring oppor
tunity in the first half came with
15 minutes remaining when
Jones received a beautiful pass
from Jamie Clark but shot the
ball off a Husky defender to earn
the corner kick. Siegman headed
the corner, narrowly missing wide
right. The Huskies did not put
much pressure on the Stanford
goal in the first half, ending the
half scoreless.
In the second half, Stanford
once again came out a little bit off
its rhythm but regained its com
posure quickly. About 10 minutes
into the half, Siegman broke
through the Husky defense forc
ing the keeper out but shot the
ball over the net.
A few minutes later, Siegman
once again unraveled the Husky
defense, but this time dished the
ball to Sauer, who one-timed the
ball, just missing near-post.
Sauer had another excellent
scoring opportunity about mid

way through the second half
when he beat two defenders but
blasted the ball into a Husky de
fender.
The Huskies had a chance to
score when midfielder lan Russell
seemed to have Stanford senior
goalkeeper Ryan Craig beat, but
he flubbed the ball wide right.
Washington scored with seven
minutes remaining when mid
fielder Kyle Godat connected
from about 30 yards out. As the
game came to its conclusion, the
Cardinal was unable to put the
ball in the net, making the final
score 1-0.
Though the Huskies were
without star striker Jason Boyce
because of a red card suspension
and were clearly dominated by the
underdog Cardinal, Washington
was able to eke out the victory.
"Great teams can be outplayed
on the road and still win," coach
Bobby Clark said. "Though I
think we played excellent soccer,
I've got to give them full credit for
the win."
