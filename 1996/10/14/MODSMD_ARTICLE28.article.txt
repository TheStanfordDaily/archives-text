# Oregons prove to be no match for Card
## Volleyball now 7-0 in the Pac-10 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team (12-1, 7-0
Pacific 10 Conference) continued
its winning ways this weekend, dis
mantling No. 21 Oregon State (14-
4, 4-4) on Friday before scorching
Oregon (6-11, 0-8) the following
night.
Stanford went into Corvallis to
meet a talented group of Beavers,
but defeated Oregon State in three
games behind a stellar defensive
team effort and solid hitting from
its usual sources.
Junior outside hitter Kristin
Folkl led the way with 17 kills,
while senior middle blocker Eileen
Murfee added nine of her own.
Freshman outside hitter Kerri
Walsh recorded a triple double,
racking up 12 kills, 10 assists and
10 digs.
"We were just really focused,"
Folkl said. "We came in ready to
play; we executed and we did really
well."
The Card jumped all over Ore
gon State in the first game, blowing
the Beavers away 15-3. In the sec
ond game, several Stanford service
errors and a stronger effort by Ore
gon State created a seesaw battle
between the two teams, but once

again the Cardinal prevailed, win
ning game two 15-11.
The Beavers started quickly in
the third game, gaining some mo
mentum along with a 6-2 lead, be
fore the Cardinal defense took over.
Stanford took 13 of the next 16
points, winning the final game 15-
9.
"Oregon State is a very good
team," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "But we played as good a de
fensive match as we have all year."
The Card's excellent defensive
efFort made it extremely difficult
for the Oregon State hitters to gain
their rhythm. Although the
Beavers do not use much variation
in their hitting schemes, they have
a talented lineup with many offen
sive weapons. However, the Stan
ford women recorded 12 blocks and
held Oregon State to a .053 hitting
percentage, compared with the
Cardinal's .356 mark.
Stanford started its match
against Oregon in much the same
way, dominating the Ducks in the
first two games by scores of 15-4
and 15-2. The Card had a .533 hit
ting percentage after two games,
while Oregon struggled at a -.089
clip.
In the third game, Shaw opted to

go deeper into his bench. The Car
dinal struggled, falling to the
Ducks 15-9 and giving Oregon a lit
tle momentum.
"We didn't play well in game
three," Shaw said. "It was a case of
letting a team off the hook."
Stanford rebounded in game
four behind another awesome de
fensive performance, and powerful
hitting from Walsh and Folkl gave
the Card a 15-4 win. Junior middle
blocker Paula McNamee provided
a spark against the Ducks, hitting
.500 and making six kills.
"Paula got a chance to get some
more playing time and she played
really well," Shaw said. "For the
most part, we had a good week
end."
