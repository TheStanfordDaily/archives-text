# Soccer drops heartbreaker to the Irish
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
It was a weekend of disappointment and
frustration for the Stanford women's soccer
team. The No. 20 Cardinal (7-6) lost 4-0 to
the No. 1 Notre Dame Fighting Irish on Fri
day night, and then fell 2-0 to the Colorado
College Tigers yesterday at the Santa Clara
Nike Classic.
The loss to Notre Dame was expected. The
Irish (13-0) are the best team in the country
and have thoroughly dominated their opposi
tion this year.
But the loss to Colorado College really
hurt. Stanford controlled the game, outshot
the Tigers 15-9 and except for a couple of
mental lapses, dominated play.
"I'm very disappointed," said coach Steve
Swanson. "It's frustrating. We outplayed
them the whole game and then didn't win.
It's really frustrating when you lose a game

like that."
The losses bring the Cardinal's record to a
mere one game above .500, and will probably
drop Stanford, which was ranked sixth at the
beginning of the year, out of the top 25.
To beat the Irish, Swanson said Stanford
needed to play 90 minutes of solid soccer and
shut down Notre Dame's star forward, fresh
man Jenny Streiffer.
It failed to accomplish either mission.
Streiffer scored two goals and added two as
sists, and the Cardinal suffered through a 10-
minute lapse early in the second half during
which the explosive Irish poured in three
goals.
"The Stanford kids deserve a lot of credit,"
said Notre Dame coach Chris Petrucelli, who
has quickly built the Irish into a national
powerhouse program in his seven seasons at
the helm.
"Except for about 10 minutes there, they
played us very well. They're a good team,

with excellent talent, and Steve does a great
job coaching them. I was worried for a while,"
he said.
While the loss is very discouraging, the
Cardinal was a heavy underdog to a team that
has been nothing short of incredible this
year.
The Irish have outscored their opponents
66-6 so far this season. That means they av
erage a whopping 5.08 goals per game while
they only allow 0.46 goals per contest.
And Notre Dame's second half dominance
is nothing new. In the final 45 minutes of
games, the Irish have outscored the opposi
tion 33-2.
"We are a better team than last year.
There's no doubt about it," Petrucelli said.
"We have more maturity and some really top
notch freshmen."
That is a scary thought for the women's
college soccer world. Last year the Irish were
the nation's best team, taking home the na
tional title.
The defending champs jumped out to the
lead early. Streiffer beat her defender at the
edge of the goal box and launched the ball
past Stanford's sophomore goalie, Erin
Bryla.
" I've just been trying to think about shoot
ing this year," Streiffer said. "I didn't do any
thing special; I just shot it."
Indeed, Streiffer has been shooting the
ball a lot this season. In just 13 games, the 18-
year-old has tallied 13 goals and 15 assists,
for a remarkable total of 41 points.
By comparison, the entire Stanford team
has 48 points in its 13 games this year.
"Jenny's a great player," Petrucelli said.
"I knew she'd be a key contributor this year.
But I wouldn't have thought she would score
this many goals."
Streiffer's goal was the only one of an
evenly played first half. Notre Dame con
trolled the ball more than the Cardinal, but
Stanford put together a number of effective
counterattacks.
The first 10 minutes of the second half
were much like the first half — both teams
struggled to get control of the game.
The Irish won the battle. In the 11th
minute, Streiffer struck again, this time
beating a charging Bryla to a ball played into
the middle by senior teammate Cindy Dawes
and easily placing the ball into the netting,
extending the lead to 2-0.
Less than 10 minutes later, the Irish had
scored two more goals to lengthen the lead to
4-0, and put the game out of reach for Stan
ford.
The third goal came when sophomore Shan
non Boxx played a free kick across the field to
the nation's assist leader, Holly Manthei. Man
thei recorded her 16th assist by reversing the
ball back into the middle beautifully, setting up

an easy goal for Dawes.
Monica Gerardo, a sophomore
forward, recorded the fourth goal
by placing a well-shot ball over
Bryla's head. Gerardo had an
easy opportunity after Manthei
and Streiffer set her up so that
she had only the keeper to beat.
The Cardinal appeared to have
put the Notre Dame loss out of its
mind going into the Colorado
College game.
Stanford took control in the first
half, as star forwards Erin Martin
and Emily Burt had their way with
the Tiger defense. The senior duo
took plenty of good shots and juked
plenty of defenders, but still the
ball would not fmd the net.
Tiger goalkeeper Robyn Bils

some terrific saves and repeated

Cardinal player could get her
head or foot on the ball.
The Tigers got on the board
with less than 5 minutes remain
ing in the first half. Martina
Holan, a junior forward and Col
orado College's leading scorer,
took a ball from freshman Kristi
na Kifer down the left side of the
field and beat Bryla, who was
coming off her line to cut down
the angle.
The game remained 1-0 until
Meagan McGuire, a senior mid
fielder, broke away from the Car
dinal defense and scored by pop
ping the ball past Bryla, who once
again was the final Stanford
player between the ball and the
cage.
