# Cogen facility powers campus

It cost $66.5 million to build,
and it's located on Campus
Drive, near the Medical Center.
At capacity, it produces 49.9
megawatts of energy, but most
students had no idea what it
was before power went down
across campus Thursday night.
It's called the Cardinal Co
generation Facility, and it's a
privately owned steam and
electricity cogeneration plant
that provides the Stanford
campus with energy and serves
as a backup power source for
the Medical Center.
"It simultaneously produces
electricity,, and it also creates
steam and chills water," said
Director of Facilities Opera
tions Chris Christofferson.
"The steam heats hot water
and also provides heat to cam
pus buildings."
Finished in April 1988, the
cogenerator — the largest such
facility on the Peninsula — is
operated by its own company,
Cardinal Operating Personnel
Inc., a subsidiary of General
Electric. Before the cogenera
tor was constructed, Stanford
bought its electricity from Pa
cific Gas and Electric Company.
Cogeneration is more efficient
because it produces both energy and
steam using one fuel source. The
use of only one source cuts down on
production costs and reduces emis

sions of some regulated pollutants.
Although the plant is located on
University property, it is not owned
by Stanford.
"The Cogen is operated by a third
party," Christofferson said. "It's fi
nanced and contracted until 2002.
The agreement has been favorable
and also has generated additional
sales for the third-party company."

Only about half the energy gen
erated at the plant is used by the
University. The other half is sold to
private companies, including
PG&E, making a profit for the com
pany, Christofferson said.
Overall, Christofferson said, the
cogenerator has proven reliable.
"We have had power many more
times than we would have if we

were still receiving it through
PG&E," Christofferson said. "Part
of the reasons it's so reliable is that
it is well engineered. Also, because
the Cogen is on Stanford property
we don't have overhead lines. By
and large, they are all under
ground. Because it is so well-de
signed, it's not subject to weather
conditions."
