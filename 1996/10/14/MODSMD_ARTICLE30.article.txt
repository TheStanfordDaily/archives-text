The Stanford men's golf
team will be fighting a tough
match with the big guns of golf
at the Red River Classic Tour
nament in Dallas today and to
morrow. With a new lineup
and new chemistry, this team
seems poised for battle.
"This is another great field,
another tough field, and to fin
ish midway would be a great
accomplishment," coach Wally
Goodwin said.
Goodwin also put into per
spective the impact of losing
Tiger Woods. "Had Tiger been
at Missouri Bluffs two weeks
ago, we would have finished
fourth. Last week at the Pre
view, we could have placed
third." As it turned out, the
Cardinal finished 14th at the
Preview. A 1 -
though the competition will be
stiff for the Cardinal, this
week's lineup carries a great
deal of potential. The five-man
team will consist of sophomore
Joel Kribel, senior Conrad
Ray, juniors Eri Crum and
Jake Poe and freshman Dusty
Brett.
"The chemistry this week
will be awesome; it's a domi
nating lineup that brings a lot
of possibilities," Goodwin said.
"We have a different team,
and that changes our game,"
Kribel said. "Everyone has a
different game; for example,
Dusty plays more of a power
game with big drives and long
shots while Eri's more of a con
trol player who hits a lot of
fairways and greens."

"Brett brings a strong dy
namic with him because he's a
dominating player with a lot of
charisma," Goodwin said.
"I'm excited to be going,"
Brett said. "This is a good
group of guys. They're a lot of
fun, but they work really hard.
This creates a good atmos
phere for improvement be
cause it's intense but in per
spective."
The Cardinal hopes to step
up its play and show the com
petition what it's made of this
week.
"I'm looking forward to this
tournament because we
haven't really shown what we
can do yet," Crum said. "The
first tournament we were still
finding our footing. Last week
at the Preview tournament we
were up against the top 15
teams in the nation.
"I think we're finally com
fortable with ourselves and
this week we will be playing
against teams we've already
seen. This team has a lot of tal
ent, and this is our first chance
to show it."
As for the future, the golfers
are aiming their sights at
steady improvement.
"The goal for now and the
winter is to finish in the middle
of the field while achieving
more consistency," Goodwin
said.
With strong depth and solid
team dynamics, the Cardinal
golfers should continue to im
prove.
"We're slowly improving,
and that's a good feeling," Kri
bel said.
