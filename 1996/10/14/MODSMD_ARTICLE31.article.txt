# Beyond the clouds
## Student microsatellite designs will be launched later this year 
### Alex Tung 
Despite the well-grounded
studies of most Stanford stu
dents, those enrolled in Aeronau
tics and Astronautics 236 have
their heads in the clouds â€” and
beyond.
For the past three years, the
class has been designing and
building two small, low-cost "mi
crosatellites" to be launched
sometime within the next year.
Although the project was start
ed by Aeronautics and Astronau
tics Prof. Robert Twiggs, it en
compasses many different disci
plines, including electrical and
mechanical engineering and com
puter science.
"The goal of the class is to be
able to build a small, low-cost
satellite in about one year," said
Twiggs.
However, the students are av
eraging about one satellite every
18 months, according to Dominik
Schmidt, a second-year doctoral
student in electrical engineering
who is in charge of the communi
cations systems on the first of the
two satellites, Sapphire.
Sapphire, started in 1994, has
an expected launch date sometime
in the beginning of next year,
while Opal is expected to go into
space about a year after that.
The satellites themselves are
considered "microsatellites" be
cause of their small size of about
30 pounds to 40 pounds. Both
satellites are hexagonally shaped,
about 18 inches in diameter and 1
foot high.
"One of the big trends [in
building satellitesl is making
them smaller and cheaper, and
we're trying to do that," said
Chris Kitts, a sixth-year doctoral
student in mechanical engineer
ing and one of the project's engi
neers.
According to Schmidt, the
satellites cost less than $50,000
each, with much of the money
coming from companies who will

either use the satellites to test
their products or donate materi
als and use of facilities to the class.
Both satellites carry a small
computer, a transmitter and re
ceiver and batteries as well as
solar panels, but Sapphire has on
board small infrared sensors
which, unlike most infrared sen
sors, do not need a large amount
of cooling, Kitts said.
Sapphire also holds a Logitech
camera to take downloadable pic
tures of the Earth. An onboard
voice synthesizer will allow the
satellite to return vocally mes
sages to Earth that students have
typed from the ground.
According to Kitts, "The in
frared sensors were the main pro
ject for Sapphire. The other two
(the camera and the voice synthe
sizer) were mainly just a fun thing
that the students came up with."
Opal will carry a set of three
tiny satellites, dubbed "picosatel
lites." About the size of hockey
pucks, they will be ejected from
the main satellite to measure
magnetic fields and relay the data
to the main satellite, which will
then relay it to the ground.
In addition to working on the
project, students also had a
chance to present papers regard
ing their work at last month's In
ternational Conference on Small
Satellites, sponsored by the Amer
ican Institute of Aeronautics and
Astronautics at Utah State Uni
versity in Logan, Utah, from Sept.
17-19'
The conference was "a learning
experience, since we were able to
see what other students and com
panies were doing and how they
were solving their problems,"
Schmidt said.
Rick Lu, Class of '96, won sec
ond place and $3,000 for his pre
sentation, and the combined ef
fort of Michael Swartwout and
Kitts, both graduate students in
aeronautics and astronautics,
won an honorable mention and
$500.
