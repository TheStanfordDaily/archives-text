# Legal agreement for burial plan expected within year
## University and Ohlone tribe working to preserve remains found on campus 
### Dan Wolk 
University planners are working with tribal
representatives in the area to find reburial
sites for Native American human remains that
may be unearthed during construction on out
lying Stanford property.
They expect to have a legal agreement with
in the next several months to bury the remains
on the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, Uni
versity Architect David Neuman said.
"This is a case of the University being pre
pared and being good stewards of its archeolog
ical sites," Neuman said. Neuman added that
no remains have as yet been discovered but
that the University wants to be ready if such a
find does occur.
Several potential sites have been identified
at Jasper Ridge for reburial. "We have walked
the area with Jasper Ridge officials and identi
fied potential sites," said Neuman.
Planningofficials, however, are taking their
time with such a delicate and hotly debated
issue. "There is no urgency," Neuman said.
Paramount to all University concerns are
those of the Tribal Council of the Ohlone. The
Ohlone tribe is the designated tribal represen

tative of the area and of the remains, in the
event that any are unearthed.
"Our main concern is to satisfy the concerns
of the Native Americans," said Philippe Cohen,
administrative director of Jasper Ridge. "I
have little doubt we can work something out."
But recent questions have been posed as to
the validity of the representation of the Ohlone
tribe.
According to Anthropology Prof. Emeritus
Bert Gerow, regarded as an expert of local Na
tive American history, there is "no demonstra
tive relationship" between the Ohlone tribe's
descendants and remains discovered on outly
ing Stanford property.
"This is a politically hot topic," added Assoc.
Anthropology Prof. John Rick.
Pnor to the influx of colonizing and mis
sionary Spaniards, the area including and sur
rounding what is today Stanford was heavily
populated by indigenous peoples.
Called "Constanoans" by the Spaniards,
these various Native American tribes — one of
which has come to be known as the Ohlone
tribe — migrated according to season, finding
solace in the warmer climate near the Pacific
Ocean in the winter time, and seeking the

fruitful inland areas near Stanford in the sum
mer and fall.
"They lived as hunters and gatherers, so to
speak," said Assoc. Anthropology Prof. Jim
Fox. "They thrived on acorns produced in the
oak forests of the greater Stanford area." Shell
fish also provided a major food source.
By the time the Spanish government grant
ed a plot of land to a man named Buelna —
eventually purchased by the University's pa
triarch Leland Stanford Sr. — the Native
American population of the area had declined
dramatically due to the influx of Spanish mis
sionaries and colonists during the 18th and
early 19th centuries.
"Their numbers were very small" by that
time, Fox said.
Many archeological discoveries have been
made, both recent and ancient, said Fox, not all
of which have been proven to belong to the
Ohlone tribe
Since the land is privately owned by the Uni
versity, the federal statues of tribal designation
do not apply. Therefore, it becomes the Uni
versity's responsibility to find which tribe it
thinks the human remains are related to and
act accordingly.
