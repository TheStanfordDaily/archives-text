# Med Center online magazine in progress

The Medical Center has launched a new In
ternet publishing project, Stanford Healthlink
Online.
In addition to a community calendar, a menu
of health tips and Medical Center news, the site's
news-magazine format offers a direct link to the
Stanford Health Library, a clearinghouse of
medical information available to the public.
A paper component of Healthlink premiered
this week as well. An estimated 85,000 home
owners from San Mateo to San Jose will receive
the single page newsletter.
Conceived by Judy Frabotta, a special assis
tant to Stanford Health Services President and
CEO Peter Van Etten, and Jeffrey Davis, a pub
lications editor at the Medical Center News Bu
reau, Healthlink stresses accessibility to the gen
eral public.
According to Frabotta, the evolving project is
a logical step in the Medical Center's attempt to
reach out to the Silicon Valley community.

Because a large fraction of the local popula
tion has access to the World Wide Web, the new
site will help the Medical Center "communicate
with the community on its own terms," Frabotta
said. In addition, Internet presence could help
the Medical Center become "nationally and in
ternationally known."
According to Davis, the site was constructed
using the "technical background and creative de
sign sense" of medical students Bryan Chan and
Larry Chu. Chan and Chu are the creators of
Medworld, a student-run site sponsored by the
Stanford Medical Alumni Association.
The Healthlink site is not yet fully developed,
Davis said. Building a search engine will be the
next step, possibly followed by features focusing
on multimedia patient education.
According to Davis, the site will be updated
regularly by the Medical Center News Bureau
staff. He hopes a working news section with daily
stories will become a regular feature.
Davis said feedback about Healthlink will
help determine its future direction. According to
Frabotta, Mednet, the Medical Center Internet

provider, will track every connection to the site in
order to help its creators to learn about their con
stituency.
The library — which has a staff of more than
100 volunteers — is one of Healthlink's main at
tractions, offering community members an op
portunity to access a wealth of medical informa
tion.
According to Barbara Ralston, the library's
manager of community outreach, the site repre
sents "a baby step" toward future online interac
tivity.
Currently, the site allows individuals to e
mail the library's staff with their research inter
ests and receive desired information through
postage mail or by fax. It also will identify other
scientifically reliable sources of medical informa
tion on the Web.
Ralston hopes that, after studying the rele
vant copyright regulations, the library will be
able to offer more information, including video
and audio records, through the Internet.
