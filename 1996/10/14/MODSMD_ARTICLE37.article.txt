Members of Stanford's current
and past lesbian, gay and bisexual
communities welcomed back the
old and new alike in an Orienta
tion Celebration Friday at Tresid
der Union.
According to sophomore orien
tation coordinator Manuel Ojeda,
the introductory gala that occurs
in conjunction with National
Coming Out Day is one of the
biggest events of the fall quarter
for the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center.
Cedric "Phoebe" Hobbs, a doc
toral student in mechanical engi
neering, emceed the event dressed
in a white blouse, a black skirt,
heels "that killed" and a sleek
brown wig with a blunt cut.
"I thought I might need to en
ergize the crowd," he said. There
were "a lot of new faces. That's
what we want to see."
Hobbs introduced the six com
munity center staff members,
who stressed that the center was
not solely for undergraduates or
graduates.
"The LGBCC is here for the
whole community," said Grace
Pasigan, the center's graduate
student intern.
Representatives from other les

bian, gay and bisexual groups on
campus then introduced them
selves and gave brief synopses on
their groups' objectives and pro
jects.
One of the newest projects pro
posed for the community center is
a literary magazine, tentatively ti
tled "Masque." Although they
have obtained funding, the maga
zine organizers are still request
ing help in publication.
After the speakers, Ojeda and
Hobbs raffled off prizes which
would normally be found in a clos
et. The prizes included hangers,
cedar cubes, moth balls, a laundry
bag, a giant chest, organizer
shelves and a plastic skeleton "be
cause it belongs in [the closet], not
you."
"I wanted the skeleton so
badly. I was so disappointed," said
freshman Sassa Kitka, who also
expressed an interest in the new
literary magazine.
Ojeda said about 200 raffle
tickets were collected at the door,
but people came and went
throughout the night.
Earlier in the day, the center held
a "coming out of the closet" booth at
White Plaza. Ojeda said the table
was in place "just to mobilize peo
ple" and raise people's awareness of
National Coming Out Day and the
Orientation Celebration.
