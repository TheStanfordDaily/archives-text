# War crimes prosecutor stresses justice
## 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
The chief prosecutor of war criminals in
the former Yugoslavia stressed the impor
tance of seeking justice through an interna
tional court system to an attentive crowd at
the Stanford Law School Saturday.
Richard Goldstone, chief justice of
South Africa's Constitutional Court and
the chief prosecutor for the International
War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, said
the tribunal must indict and arrest war
criminals or else the continued practice of
systematic rape and mass murder is in
evitable.
War victims are "too often lifted out of the
equation," he said. "Their expectations (of
justice) increased with the establishment of
the war crimes tribunal and have not been
met for too long because criminals have not
been brought into account."
Goldstone's lecture on "Assessing the
Work of the U.N. War Crimes Tribunals"
was part the California Institute of Interna
tional Studies' annual conference at Stan
ford to promote informed discussion of in
ternational affairs.
As a justice in South Africa during there-

lease of Nelson Mandela and the violence of
the first free elections, Goldstone has fought
for human rights in his own country and
throughout the world.
By setting up the international war
crimes tribunal in 1993 to investigate events
in Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the U.N. Securi
ty Council made a link between peace and
justice for the first time, Goldstone said.
"If justice does not prevail and crimes are
not exposed, people will continue to commit
crimes against humanity," he said.
According to Goldstone, the Nuremberg
trials held after World War II attempted to
extend the rule of law for war crimes to other
countries, but 50 years have elapsed and
there has been "no attempt to enforce the
law" and "not a single person has been
brought into account."
The establishment of the International
Prosecutor's Office in The Hague marks the
first time law enforcers representing differ
ent countries are working together for a
common purpose.
Pointing to many benefits of the tribunal,
Goldstone noted that for the first time rape
is recognized as a crime against humanity.
"It has happened for centuries and has not
been reported in a system of law historically

written by men," he said.
When asked whether the tribunal will be
an instrument for the most powerful nations
to impose Western liberal values upon the
world, Goldstone responded with conviction.
"These crimes are not culturally rela
tive," he said. "Rape victims don't differ in
their reactions. The question is very funda
mentally human."
Goldstone emphasized the importance of
support from the international community.
"If [public support from] the international
community doesn't come through, no ar
rests will take place, and the work of the tri
bunal will end," he said.
The success of this ad hoc tribunal is es
sential in Goldstone's view because it will de
termine the establishment of a permanent
international court to further reduce vio
lence in succeeding wars.
The international studies conference took
place this weekend with the cooperation of
the Hoover Institution, the Institute for In
ternational Studies, the School of Law and
the School of Education. Other speakers at
the conference included Political Science
Prof. Michael McFaul, Hoover Fellow Harry
Wu and Undersecretary of State for Global
Affairs Tim Wirth.
