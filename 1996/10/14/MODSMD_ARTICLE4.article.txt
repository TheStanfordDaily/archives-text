## Stanford alum and global affairs secretary discusses role of education in foreign policy for 21st century 
### Matt Spence 
Tim Wirth, the undersecretary of state
for global affairs, received his doctorate
from Stanford's School of Education in
1973, but he hasn't stopped learningyet.
In a speech to 100 students, faculty and
alumni Friday evening, Wirth praised his
former professors for his Stanford educa
tion but cited re-education as the key to un
derstanding U.S. foreign policy in the 21st
century.
"Each of our foreign policy goals is fun
damentally rooted in education," he said.

"Each requires a different type of educa
tion, that is found in the structure of our
society."
In the School of Education's first Cub
berley Lecture for this year, Wirth chal
lenged audience members, saying their
view of world politics may be out of touch
with reality.
"The question to ask ourselves is how to
focus foreign policy in the post-Cold War
world," he said. "We now have to reorga
nize, rethink ourselves."
This new definition of foreign policy in
cludes creating strategies that consider

oceans, democracy, human rights, anti
narcotics, science and a slew of other non
traditional military concerns, With said.
To illustrate the dramatic changes in
world politics over the past 30 years, Wirth
recounted his fear of war after graduating
from college. With the recent construction
of the Berlin Wall, Wirth believed he would
be going to war in Eastern Europe.
"A few years ago, my own college-aged
kids were sitting on that same Berlin Wall
watching a Pink Floyd concert," Wirth
said, drawing chuckles from the
audience.
To deal with the new world
order, Wirth outlined four chief
problem areas that the State De
partment seeks to control: popu
lation, climate change, narcotics
and food scarcity.
"We're growing faster than
we ever have before," he said.
"We have an increase in popula
tion the size of Mexico each year,
China each decade."
Dealing with these vexing so
cial issues requires new alliances
between the United States, for
eign governments and foreign
businesses, Wirth said.
Wirth's choice of issues sur
prised some in the audience.
"I thought it was interesting
that he brought up ... main is
sues that the general public
would not normally think of,"
said Jenny Waldman, a master's
student in the School of Educa
tion.
Because these global issues
lie outside mainstream public
discourse of foreign policy,
Wirth maintained that new edu
cation would prove key to solv
ing them.
Such relearning is nothing
new to Wirth, who holds this
high foreign policy post al
though he was trained in a dif
ferent field. After receiving his
doctorate in education, Wirth
began a 20-year stint in politics.
