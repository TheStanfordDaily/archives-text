# Ram's Head musical will return this year
## 
### Eric Leventhal 
Ram's Head Theatrical Society's upcom
ing spring performance of the hit Broadway
musical "City of Angels" marks the return
of a long-established theatrical tradition to
the Stanford campus.
Ram's Head is a student-run theater
group known for its annual productions of
three major events â€” Big Game Gaieties,
Winter One Acts and the Spring Musical.
Last spring marked the first time in 20
years that the musical failed to appear at
Stanford.
Executive Producer Carrie Casselman, a
senior, ascribed last spring's cancellation to
aberrant problems within Ram's Head's fi
nancial structure. Some temporary difficul
ties also occurred when it became "unclear
who would be the primary producers for the
show," she said.
Ram's Head's financial difficulties arose
partly from the group's desire to keep stu
dent ticket prices reasonably low, despite
the increasing costs of staging a Broadway

style production. Buying the rights to a re
cent Broadway show can run upward of
$5,000. In addition, supervision charges for
use of Memorial Auditorium cost the group
around $7,000.
The rising Bay Area theater scene also
makes it increasingly difficult to draw large
audiences to campus shows, said Cassel
man.
Nevertheless, Ram's Head has demon
strated its resilience in the face of the con
tinued trend of financial difficulties for the
arts on a national scale.
Last year "was a very positive year over
all," Casselman said, attributing the
group's long-term success to "really great
human resources," including a continued
high level of student support.
"We proved ourselves capable of reorga
nizingour human and financial resources to
accommodate a full-scale production of a
Broadway musical," she said.
Last year, however, was not the first time
Ram's Head canceled its spring
musical. According to senior liana
Weiner, Ram's Head producer, the
rise of "dorm shows" began to
overshadow Ram's Head's Broad
way productions in the 19705. The
group's popularity spiraled after
the ill-received performance of its
1971 spring production, "Dracula:
A Type 'A' Musical." The group
was then shut down for five years.
Ram's Head found itself depen
dent on what Weiner called
"grass-roots community support"
to get back on its feet.
Since that time, however,
Ram's Head has consistently
brought some of the most popular
Broadway musicals to Stanford.

The group's most recent Spring
Musical productions have includ
ed "West Side Story," "Guys and
Dolls" and "Once on This Island."
The success of last year's Gai
eties and Winter One Acts, cou
pled with increasing submissions
for One Acts scripts among the
student body, indicates a promis
ing future for one of the corner
stones of Stanford's arts commu
nity, according to Casselman.
She described the cancellation
of last year's Spring Musical as
"an experiment to see what would
happen" to the group's presence
on campus.
Applications for staff positions
in the production of "City of An
gels" should be out by late Octo
ber. The premiere is scheduled for
April 11 in Memorial Auditorium.
Tickets will be $8 for students and
$15 for general admission.
