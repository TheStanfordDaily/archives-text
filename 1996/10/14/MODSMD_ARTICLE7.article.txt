						summer spent at work
## Kennedy fellows pursue public service 
### Emily Richmond Contributing writer 
Summer vacation is traditionally a time
for students to rest from their academic pur
suits.
For several Stanford students, this sum
mer was an opportunity to work â€” in South
Africa, as head of a bilingual education pro
gram or as an AIDS prevention program co
ordinator in New York City.
These original public service projects
were created by the students and funded by
Stanford University's Donald Kennedy
Public Service Fellowship program.
Peter Bouckaert, a third-year law stu
dent, used his fellowship stipend to travel to
South Africa, where he worked as an assis
tant to the director general of land affairs.
Bouckaert said his work in the land re
form process was both challenging and ful
filling. "To play a role in the transition of
South Africa, to realize you're giving back
something that was uryustly taken, allow
ing people to go back home, it was a very
powerful experience," Bouckaert said.
Sixteen students were awarded fellow
ships for their proposals, said Sue Gray, the

community outreach director of the Haas
Center for Public Service.
The fellowships, established in 1984, are
open to all Stanford students. In the early
spring a committee evaluates written pro
posals for public service programs, and stu
dents are asked to participate in interviews.
Bouckaert described the application
process as rigorous but encouraging. "Even
if I wasn't chosen, I would have felt good
about the application process," he said.
"This program lets you put your ideas to
work. It sparked my interest in public ser
vice."
While Bouckaert's fellowship had an in
ternational slant, several Stanford students
returned to their hometowns to effect
