# A 						summer spent at work
## Kennedy fellows pursue public service 
### Emily Richmond Contributing writer 
Summer vacation is traditionally a time
for students to rest from their academic pur
suits.
For several Stanford students, this sum
mer was an opportunity to work â€” in South
Africa, as head of a bilingual education pro
gram or as an AIDS prevention program co
ordinator in New York City.
These original public service projects
were created by the students and funded by
Stanford University's Donald Kennedy
Public Service Fellowship program.
Peter Bouckaert, a third-year law stu
dent, used his fellowship stipend to travel to
South Africa, where he worked as an assis
tant to the director general of land affairs.
Bouckaert said his work in the land re
form process was both challenging and ful
filling. "To play a role in the transition of
South Africa, to realize you're giving back
something that was uryustly taken, allow
ing people to go back home, it was a very
powerful experience," Bouckaert said.
Sixteen students were awarded fellow
ships for their proposals, said Sue Gray, the

community outreach director of the Haas
Center for Public Service.
The fellowships, established in 1984, are
open to all Stanford students. In the early
spring a committee evaluates written pro
posals for public service programs, and stu
dents are asked to participate in interviews.
Bouckaert described the application
process as rigorous but encouraging. "Even
if I wasn't chosen, I would have felt good
about the application process," he said.
"This program lets you put your ideas to
work. It sparked my interest in public ser
vice."
While Bouckaert's fellowship had an in
ternational slant, several Stanford students
returned to their hometowns to effect
change
Claudia Aranda, a sophomore, combined
her studies in public policy and education to
develop a proposal for a project in El Paso.
Texas. Aranda produced a guidance manual
for public school students, designed to in
volve students and parents in the early plan
ning necessary for college applications.
Aranda included checklists which start as
early as the eighth grade and con
tain practical advice and resources
for taking practice exams and ap
plying for financial aid.
"So many of these students
don't even consider college," Aran
da said. "It was important that we
provide them with information
about all the different types of
schools. Whether it was at home or
away, there was a place for them."
According to Aranda, almost 50
percent of the seniors in the Ysleta
School District graduated from
high school without taking the
SAT. Working with teachers and
guidance counselors, as well as ad
missions officers at Stanford, Har
vard University and the University
of Texas-Austin, Aranda compiled
the expected requirements of most
colleges.
Her manual will be published
and distributed to all high school
students in the El Paso school dis
trict.
Nami Jhaveri, a junior majoring
in biology at Stanford, traveled to
New York's Lower East Side,
where she evaluated the impact of
AIDS education on women who are
intravenous drug users.
Jhaveri credits her fellowship
experience with helping her put
into context "much of what I had
read about intravenous drug users
and syringe exchange programs in
my classes at Stanford."
"By actually meeting these
women participating in these pro
grams, the issues surrounding
drug addiction and the need for in
creased HIV prevention ... be
came much more real," Jhaveri
said.
The stark and often frightening
reality of a New York needle ex
change program gave Jhaveri a
more personal perspective on the
AIDS crisis, which she couldn't
have gained in an academic set
ting, she said.
"This summer has helped me to
focus my interest (in women's
health), and hopefully I can incor

porate my project from this sum
mer into my course work," Jhaveri
said.
Marianna Sanchez, a junior, is
the current student coordinator of
the public service fellowships and a
1996 recipient.
Returning to her former ele
mentary school in San Diego,
Sanchez developed a series of
workshops designed to help Span
ish-speaking parents and their
bilingual children access the edu
cational system. Sanchez also es
tablished a parent resource cen
ter.
Sanchez conducted the work
shops in Spanish, which is her first
language. Her personal experi
ences as a bilingual student helped
her better understand the con
cerns of the parents, Sanchez said.
"I think I helped give these par
ents a voice in the school. They
talked about what they thought
was important in terms of educa
tion and what they wanted for their
kids for the future," Sanchez said.
A continuing concern of the par
ents was the long-term effects on
their children of moving into an
English-speaking world.
"The parents worry that with
their child in an American class
room in an American school sys
tem, the child will lose their cul
ture," Sanchez said. "They also
worry that children in a bilingual
classroom are getting the same
quality education as an all-English
speaking classroom."
A political science mqjor who has
taken graduate courses at the
School of Education, Sanchez plans
to teach elementary school after
graduating and eventually earn a
doctorate in education in order to
work in curriculum development or
the politics of education.
"One of the reasons I decided to
go back (to work at home) was be
cause of my experiences there with
the teachers who cared so much
about the kids and wanted them to
succeed," she said. "I wanted to
give something back to the school
that had given so much to me."
Gray noted that advance prepa
ration is critical to a successful pro
posal.

"This is not something you
should wait until the middle of
winter quarter to start thinking
about," she said. "People should
think about what motivates their
passion, their energy, and how
their community involvement con
nects to their academics."
The fellowship program is suc
cessful because of what the stu
dents bring to the process, Gray
said.
"There is a lot of trust involved
in awarding these fellowships.
Students come back in the fall and
say, 'This has been the most re

warding thing I've done at Stan
ford,' "
Donald Kennedy is the Stanford
biology professor and former Uni
versity president for whom the fel
lowships are named.
He said the success of the fel
lowship program has exceeded his
expectations.
"I have lots of reports from the
students (who participate), and I
go each year to hear about the
awards," Kennedy said. "I think
it's gone to terrific people who have
done great things. I'm very happy
about it."
