# Greek task force looks at housing
## 
### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
Housing for the Greek communi
ty on campus has been the focus of
discussion among members of the
Greek Affairs Task Force.
But committee chair Robert Si
mon i, a biology professor, said no de
cisions have yet been made, even
though the task force was created
more than six months ago.
Vice Provost and Dean for Stu
dent Affairs Mary Edmonds formed

the committee last spring to look into such things as
the Greek judicial system, academic education, hous
ing and residential education.
"Of all issues, clearly the one that generates the
most interest is housing — specifically, whether
sororities should be housed," Simoni said.
Simoni said sorority housing is an issue of equity
"If there is housing on campus, sororities ought to
be housed too," Simoni said.
The primary role of the task force is to examine
various aspects of the Greek system while eliciting re
sponses from students regarding their views on all of
the issues being discussed by the committee.
Despite "little substantive progress yet," Ed
monds said she expects the committee to release a re
port by the end of the quarter, possibly including a
recommended course of action.
"If the task force needs more time, though, it cer
tainly will be able to have more," Edmonds said.
Simoni said that although the task force's work
has been ongoing, progress has been minimal, and
the group may need extra time.
The Greek system "is a complicated issue. We're
trying very hard to meet the deadline," Simoni said.
Senior Derek Yarbrough, president of the un
housed fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon, said he hopes
the task force will consider everyone's perspective.
"Although I am representing fraternities, I am
representing non-Greek students as well. We're real
ly trying to do useful work," Yarbrough said.
Yarbrough, who serves on the housing subcom
mittee of the Greek task force, said he is trying to get
input from as many people as possible.

"Individuals may have their
own interests, but we're just try
ing to get all the facts and infor
mation. In the end, we may not
come up with a recommendation;

we may just present a review,"
Yarbrough said.
Simoni said that in addition to
the criticism about housing equi
ty, many members of the Greek
community have complained
about the availability of space for
meetings on campus.
"The question of facility meet
ing space has been a serious con

cern for many. People are going off
campus to hold meetings when
there is a lot of space in the educa
tional buildings," Simoni said.
"There is a simple solution here —
it has to be done and done quickly."
The Greek task force will meet
for the first time this quarter on
Oct. 23. At its final meeting last
spring, the task force assessed its

progress thus far.
Yarbrough said he hopes stu
dents will continue to voice their
opinions.
"If someone has strong feel
ings, contact someone on the task
force, such as Prof. Simoni,"
Yarbrough said. "We don't want
anyone to feel like he or she didn't
give input."
