## Stock market hops above 6,000 barrier 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street is run
ning with the bulls.
The Dow Jones industrial average
closed above the 6,000 mark yesterday for
the first time, rising 40.62 points to close at
6,010.00, less than a year after it cleared
the 5,000 barrier and just months after
many had thought the wild ride was over.
There were whistles of joy from the floor
of the New York Stock Exchange and trad
ing slips were tossed into the air as Anne
Allen, vice president for operations at the
Big Board, rang the closing bell.
The performance by the world's best
known stock indicator reflects the resilien
cy of the stock market and, perhaps more
importantly, that of individual investors
who have poured billions of dollars into
stocks.
After reaching what was then a closing
high of 5,778.00 on May 22, the Dow fell 10
percent before resuming its advance. That
was followed by several sharp drops,
including a nearly 115-point slide on July 5
and a 161-point plunge on July 15.
Then on July 16, the Dow dropped more
than 167 points, to a six-month low of
5,182.31, before rebounding to a gain of
just over nine.
With the Dow now above 6,000. some
analysts warned yesterday that the 6-year
old bull market might finally be over.

A fear voiced by many was that many
individual investors were naive, that they
didn't understand there are no guarantees
the market will continue to advance.
The fact that it's taken less than a year
for the Dow to go from 5,000 to 6,000 —
the previous milestone was reached Nov.
21, 1995, when the Dow closed at 5,023.55
— has lulled new investors into a false
sense of security, said the analysts, who
warned that individuals might yank their
money out of the market.
"Clearly the individual investor became
nervous" in July, said Norman Fosback,
editor of stock market newsletters includ
ing The Insider and Market Logic. "This
occurred with a relatively modest decline in
the market.
"I think it is a tipoff to what could hap
pen in a more serious decline."
But many of these supposed neophytes
have proven themselves to be calm, careful
investors who don't rush for the exits at
the first sign of trouble. When panic over a
likely increase in interest rates briefly
drove down prices, individual investors did
not bail out.
"I'm investing for five to 10 years. I'm
not concerned where it is tomorrow," Mark
Teplitsky of Westborough, Mass., said yes
terday as he waited for a tour of the New
York Stock Exchange.
