# FDA wrangles over home testing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - An ever
increasing number of Americans are
using medical kits that let them check for
high cholesterol, colon cancer and even
the AIDS virus without having to leave
the privacy of their homes.
Yet the government has no policy to
guide decisions on when these increasing
ly sophisticated tests — with their some
times emotionally charged results — go
beyond the routine and demand a doctor's
interpretation.
"It becomes a matter of social policy —
what is an appropriate test for an individ
ual to engage in themselves?" said Wayne
Pines, a former Food and Drug Adminis
tration official who is a consultant to the
medical device industry.
Now, an Atlanta housewife who wants
to sell parents a test to check their chil
dren for drug use is again forcing the FDA
to grapple with that policy question.
The home drug test has "got a lot of
people thinking,'' Pines said.
Amid sweeping changes in the U.S.
health care system, Americans are grow
ing more aggressive about making their
own medical decisions. They spent more
than $1 billion on home tests last year, a
13 percent jump from 1994.

The FDA regulates the effectiveness of
home tests and makes sure laymen can
use them and understand the results.
Some decisions about some tests are
straightforward, like pregnancy tests
where chemically treated strips simply
change color in urine samples.
Others pose more complicated chal
lenges. The FDA wrangled for almost six
years over whether Americans should be
allowed to mail their blood samples to a
laboratory and learn over the telephone if
they had the AIDS virus. The FDA
approved a home HIV test this year only
after phone counseling was ;«lded.
Even after that experience, the FDA
failed to set a policy on how to balance
rapidly evolving tests with the social con
cerns of how and when to sell them direct
ly to laymen.
Will patients be hurt if tests are
wrong? When do they see a doctor? Could
they force a test on a family member?
More basic, are there some tests — like
those that detect genetic flaws that might
cause incurable diseases — that laymen
should never use?
The agency again faces these unre
solved questions because of the Atlanta
woman's home drug test.

After Sunny Cloud caught her son
smoking marijuana, she created kits to
help other mothers diagnose teen drug
use. The $40 "Parents Alert" kits contain
a cup to collect urine, a package to mail it
to a federally certified laboratory and a
toll-free telephone number where Cloud
provides the lab's test results.
The FDA says Cloud violated federal
law by selling more than 1,000 of the kits
without its knowledge. But after congres
sional complaints that the FDA was being
paternalistic, the agency let Parents Alert
stay on the market until the government
re-evaluates how strictly to regulate it.
Scientific experts are to meet
within two months to debate whether the
FDA should simply check that Cloud uses
reliable test methods and explains them
to parents — or whether it should consid
er broader social questions, including
whether false results create family strife.
Twice before, the FDA has opposed
home drug tests for fear of "potential
adverse consequences in parent-child or
spousal relationships" if the test falsely
detected drug use. Each time, top agency
officials were divided over whether they
should even consider such social con
cerns, but never settled the issue.
