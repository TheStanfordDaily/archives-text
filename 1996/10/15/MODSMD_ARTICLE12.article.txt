Kurds advance on Iraqis
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - A Kurdish
faction claimed new gains yesterday in
a push through northern Iraq, and the
U.S. and Iraqi governments were put
in the curious position of agreeing on
something: The feuding Kurds should
settle their differences to keep the con
flict from spreading.
The American and Iraqi positions did
not completely coincide. The White
House said both Iraq and Iran should
stay out of the conflict, while Iraq
warned against involvement by Iran.
The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan,
which is battling a Kurdish faction
allied with Iraqi leader Saddam Hus
sein, said yesterday that it was march
ing closer to Irbil, northern Iraq's
principal city. However, there was no
indication that PUK fighters planned
an assault on the city — which is forti
fied by Iraqi tanks — or that Iraq was
planning to intercede.
On Sunday, PUK rebels seized the
key city of Sulaymaniyah, but the
group's leader, Jalal Talabani, said he

was reluctant to take on Saddam's
powerful military.
Mother found decomposed
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - An
8-year-old boy caught shoplifting food
led police to his home, where he and
his sister had spent nearly two weeks
alone while their mother's body
decomposed in a bedroom, authorities
said.
Police were searching yesterday for
the children's father, who was sus
pected of stabbing his wife to death.
Arrest warrants for murder and
assault were issued for the children's
father, Robert Castorena, 38, who
abruptly quit his teaching job last
month, said Sgt. Bob Mitchell.
Janice Castorena, 38, probably was
killed on Oct. I and Castorena left
within two days, investigators believe.
"As he left he said, 'I'm going to
find the enemy,' " Mitchell said. "If
he has a fixation on an 'enemy,' he
could harm anybody. He's got a 10-
day start and he could be anywhere

in the United States by now."
Just too scary?
According to the American Library
Association, Stephen King is one of the
two most-often challenged — and
banned — authors in schools and
libraries.
"Carrie": challenged at Clark High
School library in Las Vegas in 1975 as
"trash." "Cujo": Removed from the
shelves of the Bradford, N.Y., school
library in 1985 "because it was a
bunch of garbage."
And what does the prolific author
say?
"What I tell kids is don't get mad
(about censorship) get even," King said
at a recent conference at the University
of Maine. "Run, don't walk, to the first
library you can find and read what
they're trying to keep out of your eyes.
Read what they're trying to keep out of
your brains. Because, that's exactly
what you need to know."
The other most-often challenged
author is Judy Blume.
