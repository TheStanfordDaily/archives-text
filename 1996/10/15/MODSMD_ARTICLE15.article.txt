## No longer in the dark 
### 
Power outage served as a
valuable lesson in dealing
with future emergencies

YES, THE POWER outage
which left Stanford dark for
four hours last Thursday
was annoying. A Thursday night
without "Friends," or
answering machines just didn't feel
right.
But, the outage served as a good
trial run for future emergencies. In
the midst of earthquake country,
true emergencies can strike Stan
ford just as suddenly and unexpect
edly as the power outage did. Now,
because of this practice Thursday,
we know what works and what
doesn't so we may better prepare
for a real crisis.
One of the most severe problems
which affected Stanford following
the outage was the lack of the new
blue lights. These 19 bright blue
lights dotting campus — which
mark emergency phones in the
hopes of making the campus safer
— went down during the outage.
Clearly, a generator needs to kick
in immediately when the power for
these lights goes down. An emergen
cy like a total power outage on cam
pus surely warrants the most need
for these phones, and in the future
they must be on at all times.
Internet connections proved to
be another weakness during the
emergency. The outage affected the
Palo Alto branch of BBN Corp., an
Internet provider for more than 400
Silicon Valley customers including
Pacific Bell, Hewlett-Packard Co.
and Silicon Graphics. The online
editions of several newspapers,
including the Los Angeles Times
and the San Francisco Chronicle
were also shut down.
With the Stanford area being one
of the major national points of pres
ence for Internet connections, an
emergency backup must be made
available. Phone and power compa
nies have developed such backup
systems and Internet providers,

including Stanford, should follow
suit.
Perhaps one of the primary con
cerns of the University, though, was
to alert students of the proper pre
cautions to take during the outage.
Barbara Butterfield, vice presi
dent for faculty and staff services,
left messages for those students
with voice mail stating that there
was a power outage and encourag
ing students not to panic. Likewise,
News Service and Transportation
Services distributed fliers around
campus on Friday giving the basic
information about the outage. Since
some buildings continued to lack
power on Friday, the fliers urged
faculty and staff to use common
sense as to whether they should
remain at work.
KZSU, which is meant for both
student entertainment and emer
gency broadcast information,
broadcast bulletins over the air
Thursday night. The station's engi
neering staff used walkie talkies to
gather any information available.
Official bulletins from News Service
were broadcast Friday.
Although these bulletins may
have stated the fairly obvious, they
did work to ease some fears around
campus. Such quick action is clearly
essential in an emergency situation.
Hopefully, should a major disaster
strike campus, these emergency
notifications could be released in
even higher numbers.
Thursday will be the seven-year
anniversary of the Loma Prieta
Earthquake which heavily damaged
the Stanford campus. In light of
this, emergency evacuation drills in
residences around campus are
scheduled to take place this week to
acquaint students with their dorm's
Emergency Assembly Point in the
case of a disaster. The power outage,
then, seems like a particularly well
timed reminder.
If Thursday night still seems like
a complete loss, then perhaps you
will be comforted to know that on
last week's episode of "Friends,"
Rachel and Ross . . . well, never
mind. You can always catch it dur
ing next summer's reruns.
