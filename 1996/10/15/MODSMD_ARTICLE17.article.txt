## Requirements of the heart 
### 
PRESIDENT GERHARD CASPER
has always had a way with words.
His enlightening remarks about
what makes Stanford so exceptional have
always caused me to bristle with enthusi
asm and passion: "Stanford: where minds
are moving and studies blossom; Stan
ford: where the climate of learning, the
opportunity for growth ..."
Hold the line! "Where the opportunity
for growth is reason to celebrate." I am in
complete accord with our German presi
dent — we do have opportunity for
growth. I am a fine example of this
growth, gaining 15 pounds and 2 inches to
my gut. I've also grown socially and emo
tionally. Yet many of my budding friends
remain stunted, unmoved by the mar
velous actions of campus groups such as
Residential Education and the Haas Cen
ter for Public Service. But Casper need
not fret; I've saved him a grip of time and
found a solution that would see to the
blossoming and growth he so eagerly
seeks.
I would like to see introduced a com
munity service requirement that obliges
every Stanford undergraduate to perform
at least two hours a week of community
service for at least one quarter. That's
only 20 hours a quarter. (We spend more
time doing e-mail!)
Some may argue that Stanford stu
dents have already done their fair share of
community service.
Fair enough.
However, I would like to argue the case

by entertaining a few questions: How
many Stanford students truly under
stand and have been touched by an issue
like poverty? How many understand what
it is like for a young man to grow up with
out a father? How many of us understand
compassion and what it means to take
responsibility for our environment and
our individual communities?
Now, be careful not to confuse under
standing with pity. I don't imply an
understanding of these problems that has
been achieved vicariously, through a text
book or CIV lectures, but a hands-on cog
nition of the problem; I want students to
feel it first hand — through programs like
Alternative Spring Break, Barrio Assis
tance or Upward Bound. I need not out
line the benefits of service for they are
clear: We all win.
So then, what is holding us back from
taking that next big leap?
Perhaps words like "mandatory" and
"requirement" cause a bit of trepidation.
Don't worry! This would be a fun require
ment. (I wish I could say the same about
distribution requirements 4, 5 and 6.) But
those of you who remain convinced that
we cannot make community service
mandatory, pay closer attention to DRs 4,
5 and 6. These areas were made mandato
ry because the powers that be saw merit in
math and the sciences; similarly, the
dreaded "dagger" was made a require
ment — those in power finding credit in
feminist issues, thus mandating we take a
class that espoused a feminist flavor. So

why then can't the same discriminating
eyes that brought us the "dagger" bring
on the "heart"? Is Stanford quietly saying
they find no value in community service
for all of its students?
I certainly hope not.
In order to erase all doubt, the Uni
versity should make community service
a credited requirement toward every
undergraduate degree. The Haas Center
could serve as a clearinghouse for these
community service activities. With the
"heart" requirement (it sounds so much
better than the "dagger"), we all can con
tribute; now, an electrical engineer can
contribute to community service as
much as a French major — without wor
rying about service obstructing his stud
ies. Perhaps students will fall in love
with their service one quarter and be
back for a second dose of love. Perhaps
my "square" comrades will see that peo
ple are what really matter! Not CS I06A;
not SLE — but people!
Then I would say that Casper has a cer
tifiable reason to celebrate; for"the cli
mate for learning" would be warm and
"the opportunity for growth" a flurry —
and all of Stanford would be tending to the
requirements of the "heart."

Uncle Garry will do anything for the
kids!
