Protestors have not considered Burma's realities

AFTER READING THE Daily's arti
cle about student protests of the sit
uation in Burma (Oct. 8), I couldn't
help but wonder how well thought out
these efTorts are.
One needs only to remember the stu
dent protests in Tiananmen Square to
realize that repressive governments are in
many cases able to withstand such pres
sures, even if the influential governments
and media of the West throw their support
behind the human-rights cause.
The case of South Africa should also
teach us something. Like Burma, South
Africa during apartheid was the target of
student protest abroad and was confronted
with a 3teady decrease in foreign invest
ment. Ultimately, of course, the apartheid
government fell.
Can similar results really be expected in

Burma, however? Whereas the apartheid
government of South Africa was "demo
cratic" at least in the sense of being elec
torally responsible to some of its citizens,
the Burmese government has no such
responsibilities because it is a military dic
tatorship. It is therefore not as concerned
with the welfare and satisfaction of (some
or all of) its citizens as was South Africa's
regime.
What worries me, therefore, is that the
efTorts being employed in the fight against
Burma do not seem appropriate to the par
ticular situation. Even if we all agree that it
is our duty and responsibility to strive for
the defense and extension of human rights
on a global scale, the question still stands as
to how best to accomplish this goal.
It is probably true that a drastic
decrease in foreign investment will con

tribute to further impoverishment of both
the government and citizens. But who will
this hurt? Unfortunately, it is quite possi
ble that it will only hurt the citizens. Not
only will they lose jobs supplied by foreign
investment, but the government — at least
in the short run — may become increas
ingly repressive in order to squeeze as
much wealth out of its population as possi
ble.
The Burmese government does not
exist or survive on the basis of its eco
nomic viability. It is a military regime; it
exists by virtue of force. No economic
measures can, by themselves, destroy
such force. If the government loses
money, it will not "go out of business," for
it is not in the business of making money
for its country.
I am not saying that we should sit idly

while human rights are abused; I am say
ing that economic pressures do not appear
to be the solution as they have been else
where.
My concern is that it is all too easy to
participate in "protests" without really
thinking through the issues involved. It
makes us feel good, feel that we are accom
plishing something when, in fact, our
actions may be doing more harm them
good.
I would simply like to see a fuller dis
cussion of these matters take place, instead
of blind and self-congratulatory acceptance
of the assumption that familiar methods of
"protest" will in time meet with success. I
only hope that I have somehow contribut
ed to such a discussion.
