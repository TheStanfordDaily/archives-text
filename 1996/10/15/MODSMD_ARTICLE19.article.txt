# SEAS group and others continue to persevere in anti-Burma protests
## 
### 
As a Stanford student and political
activist, I was thrilled that much of the
front page of The Daily on Oct. 8 was
dedicated to the efforts of Students for
Environmental Action at Stanford and
students at Stanford who are finding
ways to unite their political beliefs with
action.
The article ("Students Fast to
Protest Burma Situation"), however,
had surprisingly little information
about what SEAS had organized. I was
also disappointed with the pessimistic
slant the reporter took toward activism

here at Stanford and worldwide.
This was not a minor fast. More than
75 students on campus (including the
entire executive branch of the ASSU),
15 area high school students and stu
dents from 60 other universities in the
United States, Canada, Burma, Japan,
South Africa and Europe fasted from
Monday to Wednesday as part of a larg
er effort to show solidarity with the
Burmese people and draw attention to
the repressive, dictatorial regime which
is killing its own people, propped up by
multinational corporations such as
Unocal, Texaco and Total.
On Tuesday afternoon, students par
ticipated in a press conference in Berke
ley which featured Harry Wu.
Stanford students were interviewed
for Voice of America, one of the largest
radio shows in the world, and their voic

es were heard all over Burma. Unfortu
nately, they weren't even seen in The
Daily.
Additionally, more than 30 people
attended a teach-in Tuesday night in
Tresidder Union on the issues sur
rounding the government in Burma and
the American role in it. There is cur
rently a major student movement in
Burma, and the majority of protest in
the United States is coming from uni
versities, as well.
Kelly Naylor, who at the teach-in
presented Stanford student involve
ment around Burma over the past three
years, stressed that it is precisely this
sort of student campaign that can —
and does — have an effect. Just last Fri
day, Apple Computer pulled out of
Burma because of the fast and the
attention it has drawn.

The Daily quotes me as having said,
"There is a limit to what international
pressure can achieve." I did not, and
would not, say that, as it disparages the
crucial role international influence
must and can play in such cases.
I am saddened that the article paint
ed such a bleak picture, both of student
involvement at Stanford and of the pos
sibilities of resistance to political evil.
I am glad to know, though, that it
was just that, a picture, and that the
reality of student activism and the pos
sibility that justice will come to Burma
are two very real, very positive events.
They are two things in which I, and the
rest of the student body, can most
assuredly play an active, effective role.
