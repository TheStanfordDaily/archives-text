## Water polo sinks the competition Card wins four of five over stiff weekend opposition 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's water polo team (11-3
overall, 2-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) played five games this past weekend,
and when the water was finally still the Car
dinal had claimed four victories.
The Card entered the weekend with a
bang, crushing UC-Santa Barbara 23-6 in
conference play on Friday. Wasting no time,
the host Cardinal jumped out to an early lead
with two goals.
Up 6-2 after one quarter of play, Stanford
continued to dominate in the second quarter,
as the team added an additional six goals to
carry a 12-3 lead into halftime.
The second half proved to be more of the
same, as the Cardinal added another 11 goals
while holding the Gauchos to just three.
The game demonstrated the amazing
depth which characterizes the Stanford
squad this year, as all 19 players saw action
and 10 different men scored.
After putting away UCSB, the Cardinal
hopped onto the bus to make the trip to
Stockton for the Northern California Water
Polo Tournament.
Stanford's first game of the tourney pitted
the Cardinal against No. 10 UC-San Diego.
Starting sluggishly, the Card managed just
three first-half points and carried a slim 3-2
lead into the second half.
At that point sophomore holeman Peter
Osborn broke the game open, scoring three
goals in the third quarter. Stanford would
add six more points by game's end and won
the contest by the convincing margin of 12-4.
"I put the second unit in to begin the third
quarter, and they played very well," head
coach Dante Dettamanti said. "Peter Osborn
had a real good game."
In fact, Osborn played well enough to earn
a starting position for the evening matchup
with fourth-ranked UC-Irvine.
Here again, the Cardinal came out of the

blocks slowly, but Irvine didn't capitalize,
and the Anteaters carried a slim 3-2 lead into
the second half.
Senior holeman Brian Wallin came out
strong to open the third quarter, scoring two
quick goals to give the Cardinal a 4-3 lead.
Irvine battled back, putting in two goals of
their own to recapture the lead at 5-4.
But the Cardinal offense stormed back, as
senior holeman Bryce Mathews tied the
game with a backhand shot. Then, with just
four seconds remaining in the quarter, se
nior forward Daniel Lehoczky put it by the
Irvine goalie to take a 6-5 lead into the final
quarter.
Wallin came out quickly again in the
fourth, scoring two quick goals to pad the
Cardinal lead to 8-5. Irvine answered with
another goal, but redshirt freshman Brian
Heifferon found the back of the net just sec
onds later to give Stanford a nearly insur
mountable 9-6 lead with just a few minutes to
Play-
Irvine cut the lead to 9-7 and with just 22
seconds to play added a two-point goal off a
tip-in to make it 10-9.
But Stanford ran out the clock, capturing
their first win in three tries against the
Anteaters this season and earning a berth in
the tournament semifinal.
"It was an excellent team effort," Detta
manti said. "We really wore them down."
Indeed, that was the key to the game, as
the second unit for the Cardinal played near
ly the entire third quarter, allowing the
starters valuable time to recover.
"It tremendously benefited us," Wallin
said. "By the fourth quarter we had tired
Irvine out, and we got a lot of rest."
With their first victory against Irvine in
hand, Stanford's next opponent was No. 1
UCLA.
Again, Stanford came out slowly, and this
time it could not recover. Down 4-0 after the
first quarter, the Cardinal managed to adjust
to the play of the Bruins early in the second

quarter.
The squad played UCLA close for the du
ration of the game, outscoring the Bruins 6-5
in the final three quarters but couldn't re
cover from the early four-point deficit and
lost 9-6.
"We had a tough time offensively," Detta
manti said. "We weren't shooting well, and
we never challenged their goalie."
Just nine of Stanford's 21 shots were on
goal, forcing the Bruin goalie to make just
three saves. The loss to UCLA placed Stan
ford in the consolation final against sixth
ranked Pacific.
After putting together an amazing 13-11
comeback win against UOP just two weeks
ago, it was evident going in that the Cardinal
was in for a battle.
The first quarter proved uneventful, as
the two teams traded goals to enter the sec
ond quarter with the game tied 1-1.
The Cardinal exploded in the second quar
ter to score four goals to UOP's two and en
tered the third quarter with a 5-3 lead.
At that point, Dettamanti substituted for
the starters, placing the entire second unit
in the pool for the duration of the third quar
ter.
The Cardinal managed to hold UOP to just
one goal while the exhausted starters got
valuable rest on the bench. A refreshed start
ing six returned to the pool for the fourth
quarter, outplaying the visibly tired UOP
squad.
Wallin added an empty-net two-point goal
with just seconds to play to put the game out
of reach, securing an 8-5 victory. The week
end proved especially memorable for Wallin,
as his 15 goals in just five games earned him
the honor of MPSF Player of the Week.
All told, it was an amazingly successful
weekend for the team, as they upset UC-
Irvine en route to an impressive third-place
finish.

Up 6-2 after one quarter of play, Stanford
continued to dominate in the second quarter,
as the team added an additional six goals to
carry a 12-3 lead into halftime.
The second half proved to be more of the
same, as the Cardinal added another 11 goals
while holding the Gauchos to just three.
The game demonstrated the amazing
depth which characterizes the Stanford
squad this year, as all 19 players saw action
and 10 different men scored.
After putting away UCSB, the Cardinal
hopped onto the bus to make the trip to
Stockton for the Northern California Water
Polo Tournament.
Stanford's first game of the tourney pitted
the Cardinal against No. 10 UC-San Diego.
Starting sluggishly, the Card managed just
three first-half points and carried a slim 3-2
lead into the second half.
At that point sophomore holeman Peter
Osborn broke the game open, scoring three
goals in the third quarter. Stanford would
add six more points by game's end and won
the contest by the convincing margin of 12-4.
"I put the second unit in to begin the third
quarter, and they played very well," head
coach Dante Dettamanti said. "Peter Osborn
had a real good game."
In fact, Osborn played well enough to earn
a starting position for the evening matchup
with fourth-ranked UC-Irvine.
Here again, the Cardinal came out of the

blocks slowly, but Irvine didn't capitalize,
and the Anteaters carried a slim 3-2 lead into
the second half.
Senior holeman Brian Wallin came out
strong to open the third quarter, scoring two
quick goals to give the Cardinal a 4-3 lead.
Irvine battled back, putting in two goals of
their own to recapture the lead at 5-4.
But the Cardinal offense stormed back, as
senior holeman Bryce Mathews tied the
game with a backhand shot. Then, with just
four seconds remaining in the quarter, se
nior forward Daniel Lehoczky put it by the
Irvine goalie to take a 6-5 lead into the final
quarter.
Wallin came out quickly again in the
fourth, scoring two quick goals to pad the
Cardinal lead to 8-5. Irvine answered with
another goal, but redshirt freshman Brian
Heifferon found the back of the net just sec
onds later to give Stanford a nearly insur
mountable 9-6 lead with just a few minutes to
Play-
Irvine cut the lead to 9-7 and with just 22
seconds to play added a two-point goal off a
tip-in to make it 10-9.
But Stanford ran out the clock, capturing
their first win in three tries against the
Anteaters this season and earning a berth in
the tournament semifinal.
"It was an excellent team effort," Detta
manti said. "We really wore them down."
Indeed, that was the key to the game, as
the second unit for the Cardinal played near
ly the entire third quarter, allowing the
starters valuable time to recover.
"It tremendously benefited us," Wallin
said. "By the fourth quarter we had tired
Irvine out, and we got a lot of rest."
With their first victory against Irvine in
hand, Stanford's next opponent was No. 1
UCLA.
Again, Stanford came out slowly, and this
time it could not recover. Down 4-0 after the
first quarter, the Cardinal managed to adjust
to the play of the Bruins early in the second

quarter.
The squad played UCLA close for the du
ration of the game, outscoring the Bruins 6-5
in the final three quarters but couldn't re
cover from the early four-point deficit and
lost 9-6.
"We had a tough time offensively," Detta
manti said. "We weren't shooting well, and
we never challenged their goalie."
Just nine of Stanford's 21 shots were on
goal, forcing the Bruin goalie to make just
three saves. The loss to UCLA placed Stan
ford in the consolation final against sixth
ranked Pacific.
After putting together an amazing 13-11
comeback win against UOP just two weeks
ago, it was evident going in that the Cardinal
was in for a battle.
The first quarter proved uneventful, as
the two teams traded goals to enter the sec
ond quarter with the game tied 1-1.
The Cardinal exploded in the second quar
ter to score four goals to UOP's two and en
tered the third quarter with a 5-3 lead.
At that point, Dettamanti substituted for
the starters, placing the entire second unit
in the pool for the duration of the third quar
ter.
The Cardinal managed to hold UOP to just
one goal while the exhausted starters got
valuable rest on the bench. A refreshed start
ing six returned to the pool for the fourth
quarter, outplaying the visibly tired UOP
squad.
Wallin added an empty-net two-point goal
with just seconds to play to put the game out
of reach, securing an 8-5 victory. The week
end proved especially memorable for Wallin,
as his 15 goals in just five games earned him
the honor of MPSF Player of the Week.
All told, it was an amazingly successful
weekend for the team, as they upset UC-
Irvine en route to an impressive third-place
finish.

Junior Nathan Osborn shoots the ball over the UC-Santa Barbara
defender on Friday.
"Our two goals were to beat
Irvine and to move up in the
rankings," said junior defender
Nathan Osborn. "We accom
plished both of them."

The action continues for the
Card as Stanford faces California
and UCLA in the upcoming weeks,
but the team remains confident.
"Everyone is playing un
selfishly, and each game we play
we're doubling or tripling our ex
perience levels," Osborn said.
"I'm looking forward to it, and I
think we can beat both of them."
