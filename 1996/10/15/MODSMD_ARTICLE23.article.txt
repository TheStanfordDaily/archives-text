The Stanford sailing team
blew its opponents out of the
water this weekend, winning the
Stoney Burke Intersectional at
The Berkeley Marina in dominat
ing fashion.
Led by junior skipper John
Meade and sophomore crew Jes
sica Knape in the varsity Division
A, the second-ranked Cardinal
easily outdistanced second-piace
Hawaii by 22 total points, 50-72.
California placed third, while
USC and UC-Santa Barbara
rounded out the top five.
Meade and Knape won four of

the 10 races in Division A, never
placing worse than fourth out of
the field of 15 boats en route to
totaling 21 points for the divi
sion. Cal finished second with 23
points in Division A.
Stanford displayed its depth
when seniors Kevin Pidduck and
Barry Kang split the 10 varsity
Division Braces with junior
Danny Zimbaldi and senior
Megan Ireson. The Cardinal
challenged for the lead, finishing
with 29 points, six behind Divi
sion B winner Hawaii. Cal fin
ished fifth with 55 points in Divi
sion B to fall out of championship
contention.

"We have a really, really deep
team," head coach Steve Bour
dow said. "We could have started
any of six pairs and still won. We
were comfortably in control."
The change in Division B from
Pidduck and Kang to Zimbaldi
and Ireson did not reflect any
poor performance on the part of
Pidduck and Kang. On the con
trary, the change was made so
Bourdow could give other team
members experience.
"It was a big start for Kevin
and Barry," Bourdow said. "They
did very well."
In the junior varsity races, the
Cardinal placed equally well, fin

ishing in the top four every race.
"The JV teams were just excel
lent," Bourdow said.
On a day where the weather
was inconsistent, ranging from a
quiet 6 knots at times to a more
raucous 18 knots, the Stanford
team was invariably in command
of the regatta from start to fin
ish.
"We expected to do well,"
Knape said. "We have a very
strong team, with many experi
enced crews and skippers. But
we're really excited to have done
as well as we did."
The Stoney Burke Intersec
tional was hosted by the Golden
Bears, and the event was some
what disorganized, starting late
on Saturday.
Only four races were com
pleted before the teams retired
for the day. The final six races
occurred on Sunday. Among the
15 teams present, all were from
the West Coast, with Washing
ton, Western Washington and
Hawaii representing the only
out-of-state competition.
"We expected to win," Bour
dow said. "We are coming off
only a couple weeks of practice,
but we are doing very well. We
are obviously the best in the
West."
Upcoming for the Cardinal
this weekend is the Pacific Coast
Single-handed Championships
at Long Beach, hosted by USC.
The following weekend Stanford
will host the national champi
onships.
