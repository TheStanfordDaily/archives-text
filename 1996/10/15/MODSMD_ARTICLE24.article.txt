## 
### Gil Lopez 
Facing a field of 13 teams, most from the
East Coast, the men's and women's cross
country teams both pulled off comfortable
victories in the fifth annual Murray Keating
Cross Country Invitational on Saturday at
the University of Maine.
For the men's squad, sophomore Brad
Hauser led the Cardinal in the 5-mile race,
finishing second overall with a time of 23
minutes, 48 seconds, a half-second behind
invitational champion John Mortimer of
Michigan.
Brent Hauser (24:02), Brad's twin broth
er, and senior J.J. White (24:07) followed in
fourth and sixth place respectively. The rest
of the team's points were earned by juniors
Jason Perscheid and Jason Lunn, who fin
ished with times of 24:23 and 24:32 to take
the eighth and ninth spots, respectively.
"This gave us a lot of good competition
outside of the district as far as an [NCAA
meet] at-large bid goes, but it was also good
to see teams from different parts of the
country since we're out here on the West
Coast," White said.
With all the juggling that has been done
in the lineup over the past couple of weeks,
White feels that everyone has proven their
level of talent and their ability to compete
with the team as a whole.
"It'll be nice to have everyone come to
gether during the next month of the sea
son," White said. "It should be really excit
ing to see the full team out there competing
together."
The team finished with 29 points, far
ahead of second-place Michigan, which fin
ished with 59. Army rounded out the top
three only one point behind Michigan.
"There was lota of interdistrict competi
tion which might help us earn an at-large
selection for the NCAA meet," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "We beat a very sound
Michigan team, and they defeated Notre
Dame last week.
"This was good for the guys in that it was
a very flat course. They just let out and

raced. It was a good speed course."
On the women's side, sophomore Mary
Cobb led the team in the 5,000-meter race
with a second-place finish and a time of
17:19. She finished well behind Pacific 10
Conference rival Amy Skieresz of Arizona,
who set a course record by clocking in at
16:33.
Junior Sarna Renfro (17:32) took sixth

and freshman Sally Glynn (17:37), junior
Kortney Dunscombe (17:43) and senior
Monal Chokshi (17:47) rounded out the
Stanford top five by placing seventh
through ninth, respectively.
The women ended up with 31 points. Ari
zona took second with 42, and Boston Col
lege finished a distance third with 71.
"This was a solid win for us," Lananna
said. "We beat our Pac-10 rivals Arizona. It
also gives us a chance to prepare for the next
three weeks and build a big assault for the
Pac-lOs."
Assistant coach Beth Alford-Sullivan
"has identified a few things we needed to
take care of," Lananna said "We had to es
tablish some front-running and try racing
that way. We'll need a couple of weeks, but
we saw what we needed to do and we'll move
from here."
The teams will try to maintain their un
beaten records this season as they travel to
the Cal Poly Mustang Invitational at Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo on Saturday. A
men's squad will also compete in the Ari
zona Wildcat Invitational at Arizona on the
same day.
