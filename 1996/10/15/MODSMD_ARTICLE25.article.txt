# Women's hoops goes professional
## Will it last? 
### 
Have you ever wondered
what happens to those
amazing women bas
ketball players after they grad
uate from college?
Probably not. But the phe
nomenon of women's basket
ball has made leaps and

bounds in the popularity de
partment as of late, and now
those of you who've never
wondered what became of
those former All-Americans
can simply say, "Oh yeah,
they'll probably play profes
sional ball."
What you may not realize is
that professional opportuni
ties have always existed for
women — just not in this coun
try. So here's my salute to the
inaugural season of the Amer
ican Basketball League and its
players.
There's just one fix. The
Women's National Basketball
Association may ruin the
ABL's efforts. Two leagues
rather than one splits the pool
of talented players. And right
now the WNBA has the mar
keting strategies and support
of the NBA as well as more
television coverage than its
ABL counterparts.
But the WNBA season is
scheduled for the summer I
could be wrong, but the last
time I checked basketball sea
son was a winter thing— you
know, starts in October or No
vember, runs through Febru
ary or March.
I mean, I wouldn't dare in
sinuate that the NBA would
try to undermine the ABL, but
let's face it, the WNBA is a
half-attempt at creating a pro
fessional league — whether
well-intentioned or not (and I
tend to think not).
The ABL was a well
planned endeavor (Gary Cav
alli and Anne Cribbs started
planning this thing in Febru
ary 1995), but the WNBA has
been thrown together in the
months since then and has al
ready managed to lure several
ABL players to its league.
Most notably is Sheryl

Swoopes. This star has done as
much for women's hoops as
Michael Jordan has done for
Nike. She's undeniably the
most recognized female bas
ketball player, and any league
would benefit from her pres
ence.
A little more than a year
ago, Swoopes was dedicated to
playing in the ABL along with
many of the other National
Team members. But now,
three days before the first
game of the ABL, Swoopes is
out working on her moves —
not for one of the eight ABL
teams but for next summer's
WNBA season.
All hostilities toward the
NBA aside, a pro league is the
best thing to happen to
women's hoops in decades. Fi
nally, top-notch college stars
will have an arena for playing
ball in their own country be
yond the NCAA,
So the answer to the ques
tion I first posed was — if col
lege athletes were good and re
ally wanted to play profession
al basketball, they went to Eu
rope. And for many years,
that's just what they've done.
College stars would join
teams in the international
arena and play professionally
— at least for a few years, then
they'd come home, burned out
and tired of playing, to seek
jobs in the broadcasting world.
So what's the ABL got to
offer these women that Eu
rope or the WNBA can't give
them 0 A chance to play in their
own country during basket
ball season. And they could
earn a little money. Granted
the average salary of $70,000
doesn't compare to NBA
salaries, but it's a good start
for the women's league. The
league minimum is $40,000
and National Team players
will earn $125,000.
The league could hardly af
ford to charge outrageous tick
et prices in its first year — I
mean, let's face it, they've still
got to prove that America is
ready for a women's league —
so average ticket costs will be
around 10 bucks. Not bad,
huh?
So where does that leave the
ABL? It has a lot of talented
players and hopefully a great
shot at building a winner. The
league has eight teams divided
into East and West divisions.
The Atlanta Glory, Rich


Robin
Davidson
mond Rage and San Jose Lasers
should be the top three teams.
The Glory has veteran player
Teresa Edwards (my lifelong
hero) as well as the 1996 Nai
smith Player of the Year in
Saudia Roundtree and college
standout Stacey Lovelace (Pur
due), not to mention Stanford
grad Rachel Hemmer.
Richmond has arguably one of
the league's best players in
Olympian Dawn Staley but may
lack depth in the lineup.
The Rage took a heavy blow
when pre-assigned superstar
Lisa Leslie chose to pursue a
modeling career. Leslie was po
tentially the league's best center.
The Card's Molly Goodenbour is
possibly the biggest name on the
team outside of Staley.
The Lasers could name Tara
VanDerveer head coach and then
the team really would be Stan
ford. Jennifer Azzi and Val Whit

ing were pre-assigned to the
team and San Jose added former
Stanford standouts Anita Ka
plan and Sonja Henning. Add
Vanderbilt's Sheri Sam to the list
and it could be an almost all-
Stanford starting five.
Other Stanford alumnae in the
league are Kate Paye and Christy
Hedgpeth on a Seattle team that
probably won't be a contender
and Olympian Katy Steding on a
Portland team that has potential.
So pay close attention to these
teams when the season gets un
derway. Granted, only 13 ABL
games from the regular season
will be televised nationally, but
this league has a chance.
Who knows? In a few years, we
may have college players forgo
ing years of NCAA eligibility to
play professionally and chase
those big endorsement bucks.

Robin plans to try out for the At
lanta Glory in order to play with
her lifelong hero Edwards and
chase a Nike endorsement.
