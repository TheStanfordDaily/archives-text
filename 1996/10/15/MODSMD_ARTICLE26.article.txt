Despite drawing some of the
toughest rides, the Stanford
equestrian team logged a solid per
formance at its season opener in
Fresno on Saturday.
Stanford riders competed
against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo,
Kings River College, Fresno State,
UC-Davis and Bakersfield College.
Fresno State won champion Eng
lish and reserve champion West
ern, and Cal Poly-SLO claimed
champion Western and reserve
champion English.
"It was a long day, but I was so
impressed," said sophomore
Vanessa Bartsch, Western team
captain. "The team was amazing
under pressure."
The competition is judged on
the style and skill of a rider.
Mounts are assigned by lottery
which tests a rider's ability to com
municate with the horse and com
plete a series of tasks, be it a West
ern reining pattern or English
jumping course.
Bartsch rides for both the Eng
lish and Western teams (although

different disciplines, the two com
pete under an umbrella team orga
nization). In addition to covering
for coach Karine Boudouin,
Bartsch placed second in the Inter
mediate Stock Seat 2 class and
sophomore Ann Carney placed
fifth.
"It was fun being coach for the
day," Bartsch said. "It was a good
show and a defmite learning expe
rience."
Sophomore Mark Gundersen
placed second in the Beginning
Stock Seat Equitation division and
freshman Jana Cain placed third.
Bartsch said Gundersen "has im
proved every show and made im
provements by leaps and bounds."
"I only was able to practice once
before the show so I am pretty
happy overall," Gundersen said.
Gundersen had never ridden
prior to last year when he was re
cruited for the predominantly fe
male squad after team members
heard him listening to country
music in his dorm room.
Jamie Shamseldin had to make
quick adjustments prior to her In
tercollegiate Horse Show debut.

The freshman rode first in the ad
vanced division, Open Stock Seat
Equitation.
"Usually we follow directions

1 just tried not to over
react, but it was an
adventure out there.'

and are judged with all of the other
riders, but I found out 4 minutes
before I went in that I was to ride
alone and had to know a pattern —
I'd never done that before," Sham
seldin said. Frustrations aside,
Shamseldin finished fourth in the
class.
"I just tried not to overreact,
but it was an adventure out there,"
she said.
Junior Amanda Hoche, the
team president, cited the first
place wins by sophomore Chandra
Christenson in the Walk-Trot class
and sophomore London Davies in
the Advanced Walk-Trot-Canter
class as high points of the day.

Christenson, a novice rider, had
only one lesson prior to the show
but "did famously," according to
coach Barbara Close.
Davies "is just gifted," said
Bartsch in reference to Davies*
skill and unbroken streak of first
place wins.
"She needed one more win to
point out of the division and move
up," Hoche said. "Now she's al
ready qualified for regionals."
Hoche was the reserve high
point winner in the Open Hunt
Seat class after placing second on
the flat and fifth over fences.
The regional Intercollegiate
Horse Show Association elections
were also held during the competi
tion. Close was elected regional
IHSA president, and the Stanford
team was selected as president col
lege. The job allows Close and
Stanford to direct show operations
in the coming year as well as host
the spring regional finals.
Carney was also elected to the
regional Standards and Ethics
Committee. Stanford will host the
next IHSA competition at the Red
Barn on Oct. 27.
