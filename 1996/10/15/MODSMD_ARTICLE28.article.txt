# Doctors analyze effect of Internet on relationships
## 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
The Internet is the biggest
thing to happen to sex since the
pill, according to A! Cooper at
Cowell Student Health Center.
Cooper — a staff psychologist at
Powell's Counseling and Psycho
logical Services and the author of
the online column, "Cyberspace
Sex Doctors on Sex and Lust" —
counsels clients both online and
offline about sexuality and the In
ternet.
What he's witnessing is the
dawning of a new sexual revolu
tion, he said.
"The Internet is the greatest
place to meet people since bars
were invented," said Cooper.
"With personal ads there's always
a little bit of embarrassment and
desperation associated with it. But
everything about the Internet is
cool. You can't do anything embar
rassing."
Unlike visiting singles clubs,
meeting on the Internet is anony
mous and relatively safe. And it's
also female-friendly, he said.
"Women want from a man
someone who can talk, someone
who can communicate," said
Cooper. Online chatrooms provide
a perfect forum for this kind of
communication.
"It's not like you can go to the
movie together on the Internet
and not say anything," he said.
A recent World Wide Web user
purvey compiled by Georgia Tech
University revealed that women
make up only 31.5 percent of the
Internet's virtual community. So
how should men meet the female
cyberpartner of their dreams?
Cooper's advice is to avoid sexu
al chatrooms, which are not so
heavily frequented by women. In
fact, as many as two out of every
three women indulging in cyber
sex may well be men, he said.
Instead he advises people to
visit travel chatrooms or choose a
topic where there is some com
monality of interest. "If that's
somewhere you feel comfortable
and confident, that's where you'll

do well," he said.
Cooper tells his clients that the
Internet is an excellent gene pool
to dive into.
"It is clear that if you meet the
mother of your child on the Net,
you are likely to be gettmg the
cream of the genetic stock," he
said.
The average Internet user is
just 33 years old, bright and suc
cessful. According to Georgia
Tech's survey, more than 56 per
cent of users hold at least one col
lege degree, and the average
household income is $59,000. Of
19- to 24-year-old cybercruisers,
75 percent also confessed to being
single.
But the pitfalls of online flirta
tions are plentiful, Cooper said.
"It accelerates the casual conver
sation in the chatroom to some
thing that feels more intimate and
feels more romantic," he said.
"There's a sense of knowing the
person without really knowing
them."
Cooper has seen clients who
have moved across the country,
leaving husband or wife behind,
without ever having met their cy
berpartner. They feel they have
found their soulmate, who knows
everything about them and loves
them unconditionally, he said.
"We really caution people not to
feel as secure as you think you feel,
to be cautious," he said. "Meet in a
public place, and don't give out
your phone number."
Over the last year, Cooper has
seen a sharp rise in patients com
ing to him with sexually compul
sive problems related to the Inter
net.
"People can get really lost in
that," he said. "They can get into
compulsive sexual gratification,
run up thousands of bills, leaving
them pretty empty."
Cooper attributes compulsive
Internet surfing to the easy access
and anonymity of the Internet.
"If you go down to a store and
want to rent an X-rated video, you
have to face this 16-year-old across
the counter. On computer, nobody
else knows," he said.

But Cooper sees more and more
students who feel threatened by
their partner's online behavior,
forcing them to re-evaluate the no
tion of infidelity, he said.
Cooper advises couples in this
situation to negotiate the contract
of their relationship with one an
other until both parties feel com
fortable with the terms. His advice
to the online-obsessed is to take a
step back and ask what is missing
from their lives.
Stanford master's student Erin
Reilly subscribed to America On
line last year and posted her pro
file for other members to electron
ically ogle. Since then she has been
bombarded by instant messages
from prospective suitors.
"In the beginning it was fun. I
was really tickled by it," Reilly
said. "Then I got overwhelmed. I
wasn't getting any work done."
Reilly's phone bill rose expo
nentially as she chatted online
into the early hours when she was
supposed to be studying. In the
end, she took her profile off be
cause she was tired of the inter
ruptions.
Although Reilly never ventures
into online chatrooms, she said
she can understand the attraction
of an online romance.
"It's a safe way to date some
one," she said. "There are none of
the real-life problems. . . . It's
fairyland. You can be anyone you
want to be."
Reilly keeps in touch with five
of the men she met online but has
never met any of them face-to
face.
"I would never give my phone
number out," Reilly said. "I don't
trust these people. I think there
are a lot of really strange people
out there."
"The Internet tends to pull peo
ple into instant gratification," said
Cooper, adding that "sex" is the
word most often searched for on
the Web.
According to Cooper, the Inter
net may put the $600 million-a
year phone sex industry out of
business, particularly now that
video hookups have been devel

oped.
While this online trend toward
physical gratification reflects a
general phenomena in society, ac
cording to Cooper, the Internet
can also be used in a positive way
to help people enhance their con
nections.
Peter Russell, Cooper's col

league at CAPS, has counseled a
number of gay and lesbian stu
dents who have come out over the
Internet.
"It's a really safe way to con
nect with people and ask ques
tions," he said, "and a nonthreat
ening way to do exploration."
According to Russell, increas

ing numbers of gay and lesbian
couples admit to him that they met
their significant others on the In
ternet.
"It's certainly a safer place to
meet than in a bar," he said.
Whether negative or positive,
said Cooper, "There's something
on the Internet for everybody."

Although Reilly never ventures
into online chatrooms, she said
she can understand the attraction
of an online romance.
"It's a safe way to date some

fairyland. You can be anyone you
want to be."
Reilly keeps in touch with five
of the men she met online but has
never met any of them face-to

Cooper, adding that "sex" is the

According to Cooper, the Inter
net may put the $600 million-a

business, particularly now that
video hookups have been devel

oped.
While this online trend toward
physical gratification reflects a
general phenomena in society, ac
cording to Cooper, the Internet
can also be used in a positive way
to help people enhance their con

Internet.
"It's a really safe way to con

ening way to do exploration."
According to Russell, increas

couples admit to him that they met
their significant others on the In

"It's certainly a safer place to
meet than in a bar," he said.

Al Cooper, a doctor at Stanford's Counseling and Psychological Services, says the Internet is creating a
new sexual revolution.
The Internet is the biggest
thing to happen to sex since the
pill, according to A! Cooper at
Cowell Student Health Center.
Cooper — a staff psychologist at
Powell's Counseling and Psycho
logical Services and the author of
the online column, "Cyberspace
Sex Doctors on Sex and Lust" —
counsels clients both online and
offline about sexuality and the In
ternet.
What he's witnessing is the
dawning of a new sexual revolu
tion, he said.
"The Internet is the greatest
place to meet people since bars
were invented," said Cooper.
"With personal ads there's always
a little bit of embarrassment and
desperation associated with it. But
everything about the Internet is
cool. You can't do anything embar
rassing."
Unlike visiting singles clubs,
meeting on the Internet is anony
mous and relatively safe. And it's
also female-friendly, he said.
"Women want from a man
someone who can talk, someone
who can communicate," said
Cooper. Online chatrooms provide
a perfect forum for this kind of
communication.
"It's not like you can go to the
movie together on the Internet
and not say anything," he said.
A recent World Wide Web user
purvey compiled by Georgia Tech
University revealed that women
make up only 31.5 percent of the
Internet's virtual community. So
how should men meet the female
cyberpartner of their dreams?
Cooper's advice is to avoid sexu
al chatrooms, which are not so
heavily frequented by women. In
fact, as many as two out of every
three women indulging in cyber
sex may well be men, he said.
Instead he advises people to
visit travel chatrooms or choose a
topic where there is some com
monality of interest. "If that's
somewhere you feel comfortable
and confident, that's where you'll

do well," he said.
Cooper tells his clients that the
Internet is an excellent gene pool
to dive into.
"It is clear that if you meet the
mother of your child on the Net,
you are likely to be gettmg the
cream of the genetic stock," he
said.
The average Internet user is
just 33 years old, bright and suc
cessful. According to Georgia
Tech's survey, more than 56 per
cent of users hold at least one col
lege degree, and the average
household income is $59,000. Of
19- to 24-year-old cybercruisers,
75 percent also confessed to being
single.
But the pitfalls of online flirta
tions are plentiful, Cooper said.
"It accelerates the casual conver
sation in the chatroom to some
thing that feels more intimate and
feels more romantic," he said.
"There's a sense of knowing the
person without really knowing
them."
Cooper has seen clients who
have moved across the country,
leaving husband or wife behind,
without ever having met their cy
berpartner. They feel they have
found their soulmate, who knows
everything about them and loves
them unconditionally, he said.
"We really caution people not to
feel as secure as you think you feel,
to be cautious," he said. "Meet in a
public place, and don't give out
your phone number."
Over the last year, Cooper has
seen a sharp rise in patients com
ing to him with sexually compul
sive problems related to the Inter
net.
"People can get really lost in
that," he said. "They can get into
compulsive sexual gratification,
run up thousands of bills, leaving
them pretty empty."
Cooper attributes compulsive
Internet surfing to the easy access
and anonymity of the Internet.
"If you go down to a store and
want to rent an X-rated video, you
have to face this 16-year-old across
the counter. On computer, nobody
else knows," he said.

But Cooper sees more and more
students who feel threatened by
their partner's online behavior,
forcing them to re-evaluate the no
tion of infidelity, he said.
Cooper advises couples in this
situation to negotiate the contract
of their relationship with one an
other until both parties feel com
fortable with the terms. His advice
to the online-obsessed is to take a
step back and ask what is missing
from their lives.
