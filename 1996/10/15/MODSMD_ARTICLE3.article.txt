# Magazine ranks GSB seventh best
## 
### Cameron Doolittle 
Stanford's Graduate School of Busi
ness slid from fourth to seventh place in
this year's edition of the biannual Busi
ness Week magazine rankings.
The primary reason for the drop was
"student complaints about the quality of
teaching," according to an article in the
magazine's Oct. 21 issue. The rankings

are based on surveys of recent graduates
and corporate recruiters.
"I'm a little disappointed," said Busi
ness School Dean Mike Spence, who is
beginning his seventh year as dean here.
Spence added that he was surprised
graduates had such a low opinion of
teaching. He pointed out that students
had nominated approximately half the
faculty members for awards for excel

lence in teaching.
In the rankings, Stanford placed be
hind the University of Pennsylvania, the
University of Michigan, Northwestern
University, Harvard University, the Uni
versity of Virginia and Columbia Univer
sity.
Stanford placed even lower in rank-
ings specific to students' satisfac
tion, coming in at 11th place. Re
cruiters ranked Stanford seventh.
Despite the drop, Stanford has
the lowest acceptance rate at 7 per
cent, the second-highest median
post-MBA pay at $108,000 per year
and the second-highest percentage
of graduates earning more than
$100,000 per year at 59 percent.
Spence said ranking fluctua
tions have almost no effect on ap
plication volume. Although Busi
ness Week has the MBA programs
switching rankings frequently,
Spence said, "I don't think any of
us change that quickly."
Spence said he questions Busi
ness Week's methodology.
Magazines that rank education
have come under fire recently for
being biased toward shifting rank
ings to keep sales high. Such rank
ings also have been criticized for
making too much of subjective cri
teria.
A group of Stanford students
this week called on students at
other universities to petition their
administrations to withhold infor

mation necessary for magazines
such as U.S. News & World Report
to do the rankings.
Spence said Business Week's
annual rankings are "a big seller."
Although he admits to being "puz
zled" by the drop, Spence said it is
important "not to jump to conclu
sions" prematurely.
"We have to resolve this data
question," he said.
"I'm not going to ignore this,
but on the other hand, we have to
realize that things are never per

fect," he added.
A Stanford Business School
graduate receives an average of 3.3
job offers. In specific skill rankings,
Stanford placed second behind
Harvard in general management
skills and 10th in marketing skills.
Corporate recruiters gave Stan
ford MBAs superior ratings in analy
sis and "global view" but a lower
score for skills as "team players."
Graduates gave the program
B's in curriculum and placement
and a C in teaching.
