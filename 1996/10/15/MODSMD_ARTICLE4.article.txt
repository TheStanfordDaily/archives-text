# President's accounts nearly out of money
## 4 weeks into year, ASSU's Shen has no cash left 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Four weeks into the school year, ASSU
President Bill Shen has committed to ex
penditures exceeding his annual allocations
by $2,894.78 — putting him 31.3 percent
over budget.
Documents provided by the ASSU's fi
nancial office indicate that Shen is rapidly
closing in on his limit for the year, and in
formation obtained by The Daily shows
Shen's expenses have actually exceeded his
budget. But he has yet to file receipts for
several large purchases — including $3,000
for custom-made adhesive notepads.
The president's budget is not funded by
student fees; rather, it comes from the prof
its of the ASSU's business projects, now
known as Stanford Student Enterprises.
Shen claims the financial office figures
inaccurately reflect his budget. He said he
is counting on reimbursements from other
campus organizations — including the
ASSU Senate — to help replenish his ac
counts.
But representatives of many of the orga
nizations from which Shen is expecting re-

imbursements are un
aware of his plans.
ASSU Senator Howard
Loo voiced strong opposi
tion to the reimburse
ments Shen has requested
from the senate.
"I'm not ready for the
senate to fund any of these
things," Loo said. "I think
that the senate will have to

exercise more oversight over the presi
dent's expenses."
Loo added that if senate refusal to reim
burse Shen's accounts leaves the president
bankrupt, it's his own fault.
"If he starts asking for money for reim
bursing his accounts, the students at large
should have the information on what exact
ly he's spending his money on," Loo said.
Shen has requested funds from the senate
but has not itemized the expenses for which
he wishes to be repaid.
As president, Shen has pledged to use his
office and its funds to bring a large number
of student-oriented programs and services


Shen
to campus.
"He's been focused on compil
ing a list of high-profile events that
he can point to and say, 'See the
ASSU did this,' " said ASSU Sen
ator Doug Natelson. "He wants to
keep the ASSU in the people's
minds as a service organization
that does things."
And Shen says he plans to do
just that.
"I am committed to spending
$7,250 on the year for program
ming and $2,000 on the year for
discretionary," Shen said, indicat
ing his intention to spend his en
tire annual budget.
"I have very specific ideas and
very specific initiatives that I want
to put forth for students — ser
vices, programming and advocacy
— and I am less concerned, rela
tive to those initiatives, with how I
am constrained by my budget,"he
said.
Reimbursement concerns
Shen appeared before the sen
ate two weeks ago to request re
imbursement to his account for
50 percent of the cost of his recent
"Buck-a-Bike" campaign. He
spent $1,375 on the effort, which
allowed 310 students to register
their bicycles with Stamford Po
lice for only $1; the ASSU subsi
dized the remainder of the $3.50
per bike total cost and spent hefty
amounts on advertising.
Financial office documents
show the program was funded by
the ASSU's orientation account
and not the president's program
budget as Shen suggested to the
senate. Still, the payments stu
dents made to the ASSU to regis
ter their bikes were deposited into
Shen's account.
Shen called the discrepancy an
"error" but had not, according to
ASSU Financial Manager John
Hall, moved to correct the problem
as of yesterday afternoon. Hall
manages all of the ASSU's finan
cial operations in addition to over
seeing the projects of Stanford
Student Enterprises.

Shen pledged to transfer the ex
penses to his budget and continue
with his attempt to get senate
funds.
"The intent was to shoulder the
burden equally," he said. "I owe
$687.50; the senate owes
$687.50."
The senate did not move to
transfer those funds at its last
meeting, instead requesting Shen
return tonight with an in-depth
expense record.
Two weeks ago, objections were
raised because senators had not
been informed of the expenses be
fore they were incurred.
"I put on these events in the
name of the ASSU, which not only
earned huge amounts of the pub
licity for the ASSU but provided a
tremendous service for students,"
Shen said. "No one was around
(during the summer) to accept or
deny these costs."
Natelson, however, did not
share the president's views.
"There were a reasonable num
ber of graduate senators on cam
pus — people he could have con
tacted," said Natelson, who spent
the summer on campus. "I am dis
appointed that he did not seek out
their opinions."
ASSU Senator Emily Andrus,
Appropriations Committee chair
and a member of the Budget and
Finance Committee, was not on
campus over the summer but was
in contact with Shen.
"We discussed the program
ming issues but not the specific
budget questions," Andrus said.
Shen also failed to raise the
issue of spending when he worked
side by side with senators during
orientation events.
"I always assumed that would
be taken care of at a later time," he
said.
$3,000 on notepads
One of Shen's most glaring ex
penditures was the $3,000 he
spent on 8,000 rush-order, cus
tom-made, ASSU logo-embla
zoned adhesive notepads. The
president said the cost of the
pads will be shared with Stan
ford Student Enterprises. Hall,
however, said he has not yet de
termined whether he will help

pay the pads' cost.
Shen hopes to split the cost of a
new computer for the ASSU's on
line course guide between his of
fice and the senate's Committee
on Academics, Research and
Evaluation. Natelson, chair of
that committee, said he had not
been approached regarding such a
deal.
Shen also anticipates reim
bursements from other campus
organizations for yet other expen
ditures, such as the cost of bring
ing consumer activist and Green
Party presidential candidate
Ralph Nader to campus tomorrow
night.
But according to the ASSU
Constitution Shen cannot receive
funds from outside organizations
without the approval of the senate.
Hall said he will not accept pay
ments to the president's accounts
without the senate's permission.
Until the issue is resolved,
Shen's accounts — which are al
ready nearly empty — will be held
liable for all of the costs associated
with the Nader speech and other
planned events including a debate
on Proposition 209 between Jesse
Jackson and Dinesh D'Souza.
Although displeased with his
practices, some in the senate are
willing to give Shen the benefit of
the doubt.
"We've never had a single pres
ident; it is a learning experience,"
said ASSU Senator Maren Norten,
chair of the Budget and Finance
Committee. "In the future,
though, I would like to see him go
through [the Budget and Finance
Committee]."
Shen said he intends to go
through Norton's committee later
this year — to ask for a higher bud
get for his office in future years.
"My office is probably the best
funded student group on this cam
pus," Shen said. "But for the pur
poses of an effective single presi
dent this budget is inadequate."
The senate will resume discus
sions on the president's finances
at its meeting tonight at 7 p.m. in
Room 190 of the Law School. Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
will also attend the meeting to an
swer general questions from sena
tors.
