# President's accounts nearly out of money
## 4 weeks into year, ASSU's Shen has no cash left 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Four weeks into the school year, ASSU
President Bill Shen has committed to ex
penditures exceeding his annual allocations
by $2,894.78 — putting him 31.3 percent
over budget.
Documents provided by the ASSU's fi
nancial office indicate that Shen is rapidly
closing in on his limit for the year, and in
formation obtained by The Daily shows
Shen's expenses have actually exceeded his
budget. But he has yet to file receipts for
several large purchases — including $3,000
for custom-made adhesive notepads.
The president's budget is not funded by
student fees; rather, it comes from the prof
its of the ASSU's business projects, now
known as Stanford Student Enterprises.
Shen claims the financial office figures
inaccurately reflect his budget. He said he
is counting on reimbursements from other
campus organizations — including the
ASSU Senate — to help replenish his ac
counts.
But representatives of many of the orga
nizations from which Shen is expecting re-

imbursements are un
aware of his plans.
ASSU Senator Howard
Loo voiced strong opposi
tion to the reimburse
ments Shen has requested
from the senate.
"I'm not ready for the
senate to fund any of these
things," Loo said. "I think
that the senate will have to

exercise more oversight over the presi
dent's expenses."
Loo added that if senate refusal to reim
burse Shen's accounts leaves the president
bankrupt, it's his own fault.
"If he starts asking for money for reim
bursing his accounts, the students at large
should have the information on what exact
ly he's spending his money on," Loo said.
Shen has requested funds from the senate
but has not itemized the expenses for which
he wishes to be repaid.
As president, Shen has pledged to use his
office and its funds to bring a large number
of student-oriented programs and services
