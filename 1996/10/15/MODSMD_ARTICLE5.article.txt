### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
The five ASSU Senate
committees articulated
their goals for the year at a
meeting of the senate's
steering committee yester
day.
Through the steering
committee, the ASSU
hopes to increase its effi
ciency and to make sure
that the committees and

the ASSU as a whole are held accountable
for completing projects.
"A big problem in the senate in the past
has been lack of focus on concrete goals for
individual committees," ASSU Senate
Deputy Chair Joe Freund said. Once goals
are solidified, he said, the committees need
to inform the senate and the student body.
The steering committee will serve as a
forum to present committee goals and check
committee progress.
Freund stressed that the senate is not
one mass but includes five committees with
different responsibilities. The committees
focus on five main areas: academics, re
search and evaluation; student affairs;

ASSU administration and rules; budget and
finance; and appropriations.
Graduate senator Doug Natelson, chair
of the Committee on Academics, Research
and Evaluation, articulated three goals: to
conduct a comprehensive study of graduate
faculty relations, to expand and publicize
the annual ASSU Award for Teaching and
to increase communication between faculty
committees and the student body.
The communication is necessary "so stu
dents aren't caught blindsided with things
like Food Research and STS," Natelson
said, referring to last year's controversies
over the closure of the Food Research Insti
tute and the proposed elimination of the
Science, Technology and Society major.
Student Affairs Committee Chair
Howard Loo, an undergraduate senator,
emphasized the need for increased interac
tion between the ASSU and dormitories.
Loo stressed that the committee would
not call for a return to the old dorm repre
sentative system but would instead look
into dormitory-based groups of students
working on specific projects and issues.
Loo also hopes to encourage discussion of
pertinent issues for the year, such as the


Freund
proposed revision of the Honor
Code, in dormitories.
Graduate senator Mallory
Roberts, chair of the Committee
on Administration and Rules, said
his goals include reviewing the
ASSU Bylaws in order to elimi
nate esoteric and outdated infor
mation.
Roberts also intends to propose

an environmental policy for the
ASSU, which would encourage
the use of recycled paper and dou
ble-sided printing throughout the
ASSU administration and Stan
ford Student Enterprises.
The Budget and Finance Com
mittee, which is responsible for
overseeing the business sector of
the ASSU, plans to form a "tight li
aison" with the business side of the
ASSU and ASSU Financial Manag
er John Hall, said chair Maren Nor
ton, an undergraduate senator.
Undergraduate senator and

Appropriations Committee Chair
Emily Andrus addressed the need
to review the bylaws and create a
guideline handbook to be used by
future appropriations committees
and by the ASSU Program Board.
"This is in order to make sure
that we are doing things most ef
fectively" for student groups, An
drus said.
The Appropriations Commit
tee is responsible for deciding how
much special-fee money student
groups receive and for reviewing
how the ASSU spends its funds.
