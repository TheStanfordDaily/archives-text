The five ASSU Senate
committees articulated
their goals for the year at a
meeting of the senate's
steering committee yester
day.
Through the steering
committee, the ASSU
hopes to increase its effi
ciency and to make sure
that the committees and

the ASSU as a whole are held accountable
for completing projects.
"A big problem in the senate in the past
has been lack of focus on concrete goals for
individual committees," ASSU Senate
Deputy Chair Joe Freund said. Once goals
are solidified, he said, the committees need
to inform the senate and the student body.
The steering committee will serve as a
forum to present committee goals and check
committee progress.
Freund stressed that the senate is not
one mass but includes five committees with
different responsibilities. The committees
focus on five main areas: academics, re
search and evaluation; student affairs;

ASSU administration and rules; budget and
finance; and appropriations.
Graduate senator Doug Natelson, chair
of the Committee on Academics, Research
and Evaluation, articulated three goals: to
conduct a comprehensive study of graduate
faculty relations, to expand and publicize
the annual ASSU Award for Teaching and
to increase communication between faculty
committees and the student body.
The communication is necessary "so stu
dents aren't caught blindsided with things
like Food Research and STS," Natelson
said, referring to last year's controversies
over the closure of the Food Research Insti
tute and the proposed elimination of the
Science, Technology and Society major.
Student Affairs Committee Chair
Howard Loo, an undergraduate senator,
emphasized the need for increased interac
tion between the ASSU and dormitories.
Loo stressed that the committee would
not call for a return to the old dorm repre
sentative system but would instead look
into dormitory-based groups of students
working on specific projects and issues.
Loo also hopes to encourage discussion of
pertinent issues for the year, such as the
