### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Instead of observing Christopher Colum
bus' discovery of the Americas yesterday,
Stanford's Native American community cel
ebrated something else.
"Today, people are celebrating Columbus,
and we're not," said senior Patty Ferguson,
co-chair of the Stanford American Indian
Organization.

'Sometimes people don't
know that there are still In
dians here.'

Students in SAIO joined indigenous peo
ple around the world in organizing the annu
al celebration of "Indigenous People's Day."
Through music, candlelight vigil and an
open microphone, they honored not Colum
bus and his voyage to America, but the peo
ple who were affected by that encounter.
Ferguson said the vigil was held "in re
membrance of those who we lost and to cele
brate our existence now. ... Sometimes peo
ple don't know that there are still Indians
here. They talk about Indians as if they are a
thing of the past."
In between talks at the open mike —
where students shared stories, experiences,
poetry and songs — the Eagle Nation
Singers, a Native American drum group from

the Bay Area, drummed and sang memorial
songs to Native American veterans.
"The idea is that it's a memorial service
for all the native peoples that died as a result
of colonization, in wars, direct conflicts, dis
ease," said senior Clay Akiwenzie, an SAIO
co-chair.
According to Akiwenzie, the event was
first put on by SAIO in 1992, the quincen
tennial year of Columbus' 1492 voyage.
Among its aims were "to rethink Colum
bus Day and what it meant to Stanford's in
digenous peoples, who Columbus was ...
and the movement that he was part of, as far
as exploiting and murdering native peoples,"
he said.
"People didn't really feel comfortable
with honoring him in that way, so they felt it
would be more appropriate to honor the peo
ple who were here before him," Akiwenzie
said.
Freshman Theresa Downey, who attend
ed the vigil, said the event was an important
way to raise the Stanford community's
awareness.
"I think it's really important that the
Stanford community become nware of the
Native American students that are coming
here," Downey said. "They need to under
stand the history of Columbus and our point
of view."
During the open mike, senior Stan Quinn
talked about the Native American struggle
to retain its culture.
"It's not about what happened 500 years
ago; it's about what started 500 years ago,"
he said.
