# New 'Latina' fills a niche
## 
### Mignon Fogarty Contributing writer 
When most people graduate from law school
they get jobs as lawyers.
While Christy Haubegger has been keeping
the long hours often associated with young
lawyers since she graduated from Stanford Law
School in 1992, she's been pursuing a more per
sonal dream: Haubegger is the founder and pub
lisher of Latina, the only bilingual magazine for
the nation's 8 million women of Spanish descent.
When she was growing up in Houston,
Haubegger said she felt something was missing
from the magazine stands. However, it wasn't
until she took a law school business class taught
by Prof. Bill Lazier that she imagined filling the
gap herself.
Inspired by Lazier's class she decided to go
into business.
Lazier "really impressed on us that if you're
going to be an entrepreneur then you should
choose something that you're passionate about
because you're going to live on love and water for
the first few years," Haubegger said.
Haubegger did have to do freelance legal work
to pay the bills while developing Latina. Eventu
ally, she secured financing from Essence, a mag
azine for African-American women.
Of the joint venture, Haubegger said, "It's
perfect because that is what I always thought:


Law School alumna Christy Haubegger has filled a niche with the
creation of a new magazine for women called Latina.
'Why don't we have something
like Essence?' "
Haubegger, however, was
quick to point out that while Lati
na fills a niche, its success is based
on good business sense.
"Nobody is going to give their
investment money to a good cause.
That's what charities are for,"
said Haubegger. "Latina is good
business because the Hispanic
market is growing much faster
than the general population."
With its second issue out on
newsstands, Haubegger said,

"Latina is exceed-1
ing all of our sales I
goals. The De-|
cember issue will I
be our first bi-1
monthly issue,l
and we'll be pub-1
lishing monthly 112
by summer."
One of the I
unique feature of

the magazine is its bilingual bent.
"Most of our readers are bilin
gual," Haubegger explained, "but
they wanted to be able to share the
magazine with people who didn't
necessarily speak good English."
The bilingual aspect of the
magazine also makes it a natural
for teaching Spanish.
"Tons of people are using Lati
na for their high school Spanish
classes," Haubegger said. "We get
teachers calling up and complain
ing about our articles on sex, but
we have to tell them we're a maga
zine, not a teaching aid."
The magazine also blends

Spanish words and phrases into
its English articles, a mix Haubeg
ger refers to as "Spanglish"
"This is the way most of us actu
ally talk," she said. "It upsets the
purists, but we wanted something
that reflected the way we really
sound as well as the way we look."
The magazine's first two covers
have been graced by actress Jen
nifer Lopez and model Patricia Ve
lasquez. However, the editors had
to search long and hard to find
Latina models to fill their pages.
According to Haubegger, "It's
incredibly hard to find Latina
models because the agencies don't
represent them. They would tell
us they had an Italian model that
looked Hispanic, but we wanted
real Hispanic women."
Haubegger is especially proud
of the "Successes" section that
features the accomplishments of
Latinas.
"It's never hard to find women
to feature in our 'Successes' sec
tion," said Haubegger. "We get
suggestions from all over the
country. It's been hard to get it
down to four women each issue.
"People don't hear the positive
side of our story told anywhere."
Latina is clearly changing the
views of some people.
According to Haubegger, "A
woman called from Texas and said
her daughter had picked up the
magazine. After reading the 'Suc
cesses' section, she said, 'Look,
Mom, now we can do anything.'
"It's stories like these that keep
me going and make it all worth
while."

Latina is available at all major
bookstores near campus for $2.50
per issue.
