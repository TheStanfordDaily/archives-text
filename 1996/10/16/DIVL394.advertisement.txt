"...it's about
tapping
an ocean of
creativity,
passion
and energy
that, as
far as we
can see,
has no
bottom
and no
shores."
Jack Welch, Chairman and CEO
How would you describe (iK's work
environment? Open, inspiring,
charged, fast-paced, non-bureau
cratic, apolitical. We think you'll
agree these are particularly appeal
ing adjectives.
We believe in being "boundaryless."
We're taking down walls that divide
people, eliminating hierarchies and
stripping out bureaucratic processes
company-wide. And it's working. We
are a 70 billion dollar global enter
prise whose extremely diverse range
of businesses are number one or
number two in their markets.
Others look to us for management
best practices and our financial
results have shareholders cheering.
We'll be on
campus this fall. Please
check with
the Placement Office
for more details.
We want to hear from Bachelor's
and Master's degree candidates. If
you are bright, creative, passionate
about your work and determined to
make things happen, we want you to
know we find these to be particu
larly appealing qualities.
