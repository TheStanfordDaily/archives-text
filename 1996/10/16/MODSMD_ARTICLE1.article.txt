## Housing and Dining committee to look at lowering dining costs 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
The opera
tions costs of
Housing and Din
ing Services have
been the main
focus of discus
sion by an ad hoc
committee set up
to review the ad
ministrative divi
sion.

University Budget Director
Tim Warner, spokesman for the
committee, said the group plans to
finish its recommendations by the
end of the quarter to present to
Provost Condoleezza Rice.
The committee of two faculty
members, five staff members and
three student representatives last
met Monday. It was created last
winter quarter at the request of
the provost.
Housing and Dining Services is
an umbrella organization that
controls three separate opera

tions, the largest of which is Din
ing Services, which runs food
sales in Stanford's dormitories,
and is managed by Director of
Housing and Dining Services
Keith Guy. Conference operations
and capital programs also fall
under the aegis of Housing and
Dining.
Dining Services prices — the
subject of some of the most com
mon student complaints — are an
important concern for the com
mittee, Warner said.
"We're specifically looking at
market comparison of food ser
vice, especially relative to other
colleges and universities," he said.
"We're trying to find ways that
costs can be reduced and looking
at food service's pricing struc
ture."
Suggestions have been made to
lower Dining Service's costs by
consolidating dining areas and
food distributors rather than
maintaining separate services for


Warner
each residence. However, Resi
dential Education believes having
residence-based dining services is
vital to creating community with
in dormitories, as well as provid
ing students a greater opportuni
ty to interact.
In addition, the committee will
focus on capital programs, which
pay for large, on-campus projects
such as dorm renovations and
building new graduate student
housing. Warner said the commit
tee plans to recommend to continue
renovating student residences and
building new facilities on campus.

Conferences, held in the sum
mer and sponsored by faculty
members, bring off-campus ex
perts to Stanford. These experts
are housed in student residences.
The committee is assessing the
costs of these conferences to the
University, Warner said.
Although the committee has
outlined what issues it will exam
ine this quarter, "It's too early to
say what changes there may or
may not be," Warner said. "I don't
want to speculate right now."
Sophomore Eric Friedman, one
of two undergraduates on the
committee, said no single issue
will receive more consideration
than any other. "We're trying to
pay sufficient attention to all
three," he said, adding that any

changes the group might recom
mend are still "up in the air."
Although the committee has
three student members — Fried
man, junior Ernie Palomino and
master's student Alex Gould — it
is currently searching for ways to
gather more student input, Warn
er said. One idea is to create focus
groups to gather and consolidate
students' concerns and sugges
tions.
"We would probably hire an
outside consultant to design and
lead the focus groups," Warner
said.
Friedman said that while the
group wants to reflect students'
ideas, "The committee is fairly
closed to new members right
now."
