## Housing and Dining committee to look at lowering dining costs 
### Jamie Taylor Staff writer 
The opera
tions costs of
Housing and Din
ing Services have
been the main
focus of discus
sion by an ad hoc
committee set up
to review the ad
ministrative divi
sion.

University Budget Director
Tim Warner, spokesman for the
committee, said the group plans to
finish its recommendations by the
end of the quarter to present to
Provost Condoleezza Rice.
The committee of two faculty
members, five staff members and
three student representatives last
met Monday. It was created last
winter quarter at the request of
the provost.
Housing and Dining Services is
an umbrella organization that
controls three separate opera

tions, the largest of which is Din
ing Services, which runs food
sales in Stanford's dormitories,
and is managed by Director of
Housing and Dining Services
Keith Guy. Conference operations
and capital programs also fall
under the aegis of Housing and
Dining.
Dining Services prices — the
subject of some of the most com
mon student complaints — are an
important concern for the com
mittee, Warner said.
"We're specifically looking at
market comparison of food ser
vice, especially relative to other
colleges and universities," he said.
"We're trying to find ways that
costs can be reduced and looking
at food service's pricing struc
ture."
Suggestions have been made to
lower Dining Service's costs by
consolidating dining areas and
food distributors rather than
maintaining separate services for
