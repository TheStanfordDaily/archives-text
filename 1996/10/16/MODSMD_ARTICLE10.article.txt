## Supreme Court looks into religious freedom 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Supreme Court set the stage for
a key ruling on religious free
dom by agreeing yesterday to
review a 1993 law aimed at curb
ing governmental interference
with the spiritual lives of Amer
icans.
In taking on a case that began
as a zoning dispute between a
church and a Texas city, the jus
tices said they will review the
constitutionality of the Reli
gious Freedom Restoration Act.
The law gives give more weight
to claims that actions taken by
government sometimes improp
erly restrict religious freedom.
The court's ruling, expected
by July, could clarify the bound
aries between legitimate govern
mental restrictions and undue
infringement on religious free
dom.
A church in Boerne, Texas,
invoked the law after the city
thwarted its attempt to build an
addition. The church argued
that Boerne's refusal to issue
the permit was an example of
governmental action banned by
the law.
City officials, in turn, mount-

Ed a constitutional attack —
contending that in passing the
law, Congress unlawfully
usurped power from state and
local governments and from the
Supreme Court itself.
"What's at stake is really any
meaningful expression of faith
for all Americans," said Melissa
Rogers of the Baptist Joint Com
mittee on Public Affairs, one of
many religious groups that
pushed for the act's passage.
"We think the law is both con
stitutional and vital to religious
freedom," she said.
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-
N.Y., who helped author the law,
said he hopes the high court will
uphold it. He noted that "every
one from Phyllis Schlafly to the
ACLU supported (it), along with
every major religious organiza
tion in the country."
But the 1993 law has been
particularly unpopular with
prison officials in many states.
They say it caused a flood of law
suits in which inmates chal
lenged regulation of apparel,
diet and other aspects of life
behind bars as violations of their
religious beliefs.
