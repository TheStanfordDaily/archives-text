## Dole hones in on the Golden State 
### 
SAN DIEGO (AP) â€” For Bob Dole, it is
the $6 million question: Is California the
land of electoral treasure or a cleverly set
Democratic trap?
Dole must answer the question by
week's end, after today's final debate with
President Clinton, as he settles on a come
from-behind strategy that even many
Republicans doubt can succeed.
Democrats are dubious that California
will suddenly become the anchor of Dole's
hopes, given Clinton's assiduous courting
of the state. Clinton has been to the state
27 times as president and rarely a week
has passed without a visit from some
senior administration official.
"I think it would be insane," said Bill
Carrick, Clinton's top California opera
tive.
But all signs from the Dole camp point
to a full-scale battle for California and its
54 electoral votes, provided that polls after
the debate do not show any significant
movement in Clinton's favor.
"I think history is on Dole's side," said
Republican activist Steve Merksamer,
pointing to six consecutive GOP presiden
tial wins in the state before Clinton broke
the streak in 1992.
The latest public poll put Clinton's lead
at 10 points. Republicans say their
research found an eight-point Clinton edge
as of Sunday night; Democratic polling put

the gap at 14 points.
If Dole runs all-out here, Democrats
"will spend them into oblivion here and
they will never catch up anywhere," said
Carrick.
But California Republicans, still bitter
at George Bush for conceding the state to
Clinton four years ago, are urging Dole to
fight. They will try to convince Dole strate
gists at a meeting today that they are pre
pared to help.
According to state and national Repub
lican sources, the California GOP is poised
to spend $3 million on television ads criti
cizing Clinton for opposing a ballot initia
tive that would roll back state affirmative
action programs. Supporters of the mea
sure, known as the California Civil Rights
Initiative, also plan to spend several mil
lion dollars on TV before the Nov. 5 elec
tion.
Republicans believe the measure, like
an anti-immigration initiative two years
ago, will boost conservative turnout and
help GOP candidates in a state where
Democrats and Republicans are battling
fiercely for a handful of congressional
seats.
"The issues cut in our favor in Califor
nia," said David Carney, a 1992 Bush oper
ative now working for Dole. "In 1992, we
pulled out before we pulled in. It was a
giant tactical mistake."
