Are you flabby too?
BRECKENRIDGE, Colo. (AP) - Flab
is now the norm.
For the first time, overweight people
outnumber normal-size ones in the United
States, according to the latest government
statistics, released yesterday.
The reasons are not entirely clear.
Katherine Flegal of the National Center
for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Md.,
who outlined the data, noted the develop
ment of the TV remote control, which
keeps people planted on the couch all

evening, and fear of crime, which gives
them another reason to stay inside.
Television loses blood
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The bad news:
Television's bloodiest and most graphic
hours still come from movies transplanted
from theaters.
The good news: The use of violence in
the 1995-96 season went down in spite of
shows such as "The Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers," according to a network
financed study issued yesterday by UCLA.
