# King Hussein pledges support for Arafat

JERICHO, West Bank (AP) - Jor
dan's King Hussein made his first visit to
the West Bank yesterday since losing the
territory to Israel in the 1967 Middle
East War and pledged support for Yasser
Arafat. "My brother Arafat and I are a
team," the Jordanian monarch said.
With the visit — the first by an Arab
leader to the autonomous enclave —
Hussein also signaled his public accep
tance of Palestinian rule in the West
Bank and put more pressure on Israel to
accelerate the pace of the peace process.
"I am happy to be on Palestinian
land," the monarch declared, standing
shoulder-to-shoulder with Arafat at a
news conference in the West Bank town
of Jericho. Both leaders wore checkered

Arab headdresses.
In a veiled warning to Israel, Hussein
said he and Arafat would cooperate close
ly to ensure that the Jewish state's new
hard-line government keeps promises
made in peace agreements with the
Palestinians.
"I will do all I can to help complete the
peace process," the Jordanian king said.
"God willing, we will see realization of
the g0a1... the establishment of an inde
pendent Palestinian state."
Hussein and Arafat have had a trou
bled relationship. By letting the Pales
tinian leader play host yesterday, Hus
sein was also tacitly acknowledging his
own role as a visitor to the West Bank,
over which he once ruled.

Israelis have been shocked in recent
days at the harsh criticism of their gov
ernment by Hussein, who has become
one of Israel's closest friends since the
two countries made peace in 1994.
The unexpected royal trip comes at a
critical stage in Israeli-Palestinian nego
tiations on an Israeli troop pullback from
the West Bank town of Hebron. U.S.
mediator Dennis Ross has been pressing
the two sides to wrap up an agreement
quickly, reportedly before the U.S. presi
dential elections on Nov. 5.
Under the agreement between Israel's
previous government and the Palestini
ans, Israeli troops were to have pulled out
of 80 percent of Hebron, remaining only
near Jewish settler enclaves.
