New report on minority
alumni relations offers
realistic proposals

STANFORD'S ALUMNI ARE
like a flower garden, accord
ing to a new report of the
Task Force on Minority Alumni
Relations.
The garden's composition has
been changing over time and con
tinues to do so.
That is to say, the alumni popula
tion is becoming increasingly
diverse; about 10 percent of today's
150,000 alumni are minorities, and
this figure will only go up as about
45 percent of rurrent undergradu
ates are minorities.
The new and old flowers in the
garden have many of the same
needs — sunlight, water and good
soil. But the new flowers have some
special needs that traditionally
haven't been addressed. If Stanford
wants to keep cultivating beautiful
and productive flowers, then it
must take steps to fulfill these spe
cial needs. The University's future
depends on it.
It looks like the University is
ready to put on its gardening gloves.
With the release of its 100-page
report last week, the Board of
Trustees' task force laid out a
blueprint for future gardening suc
cess. The task force is to be com
mended for its comprehensive find
ings. as is Provost Condoleezza Rice
for forming the group two years
ago.
The report is successful because
it explains the similarities and dif
ferences between the experiences of
white alumni and minority alumni.
As for the similarities, the over
whelming majority of both groups
say they are satisfied with their
undergraduate years on the Farm;
they are proud of their Stanford
degrees and feel they got a better
value at Stanford than they would
have elsewhere. Still, most alumni
think that the University doesn't
do enough to keep them involved

and make them feel like an impor
tant part of the Stanford communi
ty after graduation.
These anecdotes offered by cur
rent minority students in the report
highlight the unique experiences of
minorities at Stanford:
• An African-American under
graduate said he had been penal
ized, in terms of his grade, because
he had expressed an opinion in class
which came from a non-Western
perspective.
• An Asian-American undergrad
uate said she could not find any fac
ulty members who shared her inter
est in East Asian studies and there
fore ended up switching her major.
• Several students of color report
ed unpleasant experiences with
older, white alumni at football
games. The alumni questioned why
the students were sitting in the stu
dent section.
These anecdotes, though not sci
entific, get at an important point:
Minority students' experiences as
undergraduates will affect their
relationship with the University as
alumni. The task force should be
applauded for recognizing this fact
and for recommending the develop
ment of "an accessible student feed
back system" to understand the
experiences of current undergradu
ates.
The task force's other recom
mendations are also worthwhile
and would improve the University's
relations with all alumni, not just
alumni of color. Furthermore, the
suggestions are realistic in today's
cost-controlling era. The price tag
for establishing an--H-lumni volun
teer clearinghouse — estimated at
several hundred thousand dollars
— will be well worth the investment
if properly implemented. Clearing
house staff would be responsible for
identifying and coordinating oppor
tunities for all alumni to participate
in University life.
University President Gerhard
Casper has offered his support for
the task force's recommendations.
That's a good first step. Now he
needs to grab his gardening gloves
and dig in.
