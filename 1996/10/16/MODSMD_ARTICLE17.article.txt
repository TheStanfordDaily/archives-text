Parks' column misrepresents affirmative action

Rvan parks' arguments
against affirmative action trade
on various meanings of the word
"discrimination."
Parks writes that most people believe
that "racial discrimination is wrong."
But what exactly does that mean? There
are (at least) two meanings to the word
"discrimination." In one meaning, the
word simply means to make a distinc
tion, a& when I discriminate between a
good argument and a poor one.
In the other meaning, to discriminate
means to make a distinction in an
unjust or illegitimate way, as when I
discriminate between sophomores and
juniors with respect to awarding grades.
Only in the second meaning of the term
is "discrimination" morally wrong. The
question which Parks' analysis begs is
the following: Does the discrimination

on the basis of race and gender in affir
mative action policies amount to dis
crimination in the first sense or in the
second sense?
Consider the following possible moral
justification for racial "discrimination"
in university admissions policies. The
United States is a society with profound
and enduring legacies of discrimination.
Only 35 years ago, blacks could not par
ticipate in public institutions or share
public benefits — including not only
access to transportation, but also to uni
versities — on par with whites. Today,
black Americans continue to experience
de facto neighborhood and educational
segregation.
Even without conscious race discrim
ination fin the morally bad second
sense) group segregation prevents the
flow of information between racial

groups which could allow for fair equali
ty of opportunity between black and
white potential applicants. Potential
black applicants may be unaware of the
opportunities for entrance, and even
when they are aware, they have little
reason to believe that the procedures
are fair.
What should our society do — and
what should it say to those who suffer
present disadvantages from the policies
of the past? In the context of an atmo
sphere poisoned by the past history of
race relations, affirmative action sends
(or can send, when properly articulated
and institutionalized) a message of
mutual respect. Affirmative action does
not favor applicants simply because
they are black or female for no other
reason but as a way of affirming ideals
of mutual respect, trust and fair oppor

tunity. It emphasizes outreach, account
ability for decisions and a commitment
of resources to those who the university
believes, if given the chance, would
flourish and contribute to the university
by fully appropriate and universal stan
dards. It holds out the promise of a soci
ety in which all groups can be included
as equal members.
Whether affirmative action succeeds
in advancing this promise, and to what
extent, can and should be debated. But
that discussion requires serious atten
tion to actual, specific affirmative action
policies. It also requires a discussion of
alternatives.
Proposition 209 does neither and
advances only racial polarization; it
should be voted down.
