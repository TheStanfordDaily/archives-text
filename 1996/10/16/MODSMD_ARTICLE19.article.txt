## The 						wrong way to fight 209 
### 
Like an overwhelming
majority of Stanford students, I
voted no on the infamous Proposi
tion 187, the 1994 California ballot initia
tive which eliminated a wide range of
state services for illegal immigrants.
Despite how the initiative was received at
Stanford and numerous other campuses
across the state, the initiative passed eas
ily-
I blame us. Those of us who opposed
Prop. 187 did more to help pass the initia
tive than did its supporters. We played
right into their hands, and we're about to
do it again, this time with the controver
sial Prop. 209, also known as the Califor
nia Civil Rights Initiative.
I made many attempts to convince
friends and family in Southern California
that they should vote against Prop. 187,
"and' Tor a while* it was working.
"This initiative is the wrong answer.
It's bad for schools because it turns teach
ers into Immigration and Naturalization
Service agents. It's bad for public health
because it will discourage large segments
of the population from seeking medical
treatment. Finally, it's going to break
down the division between legal and illegal
immigration in the public's eyes. Whatev
er your feelings are about illegal immigra
tion, it's a separate issue from legal immi
gration, and it's going to make it easier for
xenophobes to attack people who come to
this country LEGALLY." For the short
time that this was the public strategy of
Prop. 187 opponents, the race tightened.

Then came the fiasco. For several
weeks prior to the election, angry stu
dents held near-violent demonstrations
across the state. Prop. 187 supporters got
the best gift they could have wished for:
free air-time, courtesy of local news. Not
only was the hysteria angering many
swing voters, but the message served to
alienate instead of educate.
Rather than focusing on the public
dangers of Prop. 187, protesters burned
American flags, waved foreign flags and
defended illegal immigration, incoherent
ly arguing that "no one is illegal." Anyone
who supported Prop. 187 was quickly
labeled a racist. Students and agitators
threatened riots should the initiative
pass.
Pec pie who hadn't made up their
minds were disgusted. My own mother, a
former Los Angeles school teacher who
proudly taught many children of illegal
immigrants, made up her mind to vote for
Prop. 187 while sitting at our dinner table
one night, watching TV footage of Cal
State-Northridge students burning an
American flag.
She argued, "I don't believe that illegal
immigrants should have the same rights
as those who come here legally, and more
importantly I'm voting to send a message
that I will not be intimidated." I had
nothing to respond with, and I believe
Prop. 187 passed because of swing voters
like my mom.
I'm concerned that history is on the
verge of repeating itself. There are quite a

few similarities between Prop. 187 and
Prop. 209. Both measures appeal to pop
ulist tendencies. Both have attracted
national interest. Finally, both are
extremely unpopular on college campus
es.
Rather than initiating a much needed
public dialogue on race, the anti-Prop.
209 camp has focused on what it argues
the proposition will do to women. This
strategy was initially appealing since a
majority of California voters are women;
however, it hasn't worked very well.
Prop. 209 leads among likely voters of
both sexes, and supporters of the measure
have been very successful in getting
women to speak out for the initiative.
It's probably too late to change tactics
to a rational discourse on race. Instead, we
are likely to see a reaction of fear and hys
teria, leading to the same type of mistakes
we saw in the Prop. 187 campaign. Two
weeks ago there were reports of campus
disturbances at Cal State-Northridge, and
now that the eight University of Califor
nia schools on the quarter system are back
in session, look for the media to focus
their attention on college campuses. If the
hysteria returns, you can bet that Prop.
209 will pass easier than Prop. 187 did.
