From health care funding to af
firmative action, the outcome of the
upcoming presidential election
could have a serious impact on Stan
ford, according to University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper.
In an appearance last night at the
Palo Alto City Council meeting,
Casper outlined Stanford's strategic
priorities as the election approach
es.
"We must set priorities in order
to make the most of our limited re
sources at Stanford," he said. "We
are likely to suffer very much if ei
ther the Democrats or the Republi
cans carry out what they say they
will carry out."
Casper referred to the proposed

budget cuts suggested by the presi
dential candidates. Such cuts will ef
fect a 25 percent reduction in feder
al funding now available for re
search and development at Stan
ford, he said.
"My proposal for Stanford grad
uate fellowships in the sciences and
engineering is to wean us off federal
grants," said Casper. The humani
ties are mainly supported by private
sources and so do not face the same
threats, he added.
The program Casper suggested
would require $200 million to fi
nance 100 graduate students in the
sciences and engineering for three
years.
Casper also said if the merger
being negotiated with the UC-San
Francisco's medical center does
not go through, Medicare cuts
could hurt Stanford's health care
and medical research.
Depending on changes in feder
al funding and policy, Casper also
suggested reorganizing health
services in order to make them
more accessible to students and
faculty.
"We need to expedite the move
ment of knowledge from the
bench to the bedside," he said.
Casper also expressed doubts
about the future of affirmative ac
tion at Stanford if Proposition 209
is passed, despite the fact that it
would primarily affect public uni
versities. Prop. 209 is a controver

sial measure that is aimed at elim
inating affirmative action in the
public sector in California.
"I do worry that if Prop. 209
gets adopted, somebody will find a
way to extend its reach even out to
the private sector," Casper said.
Other priorities for Stanford
include technological innovations
and campus construction.
Casper said emphasis will be
placed on keeping Stanford up-to
date with information technology
by creating instructive software
and upgrading old systems.
"We welcome change and do
not fear it," Casper said, challeng
ing the argument that new tech
nologies will make universities ob
solete. He referred to the overhaul
of Stanford's information sys
tems, a project he said has taken
almost two years and cost $60 mil
lion to complete.

Action is also being taken to
renew the physical infrastructure
of the University, as evidenced by
extensive construction at the cen
ter of campus.
"For some years now, we have
realized that many of our facilities
are antiquated and need to be up
graded," said Casper. "We need to
enhance both the aesthetic and
functional qualities of the Univer
sity."
The costs of renovation, new
programming and technological
innovation are high, and Casper
said the University's $3.6 million
endowment covers only 12 percent
of its annual operating income.
He said Stanford is working
with industry leaders and other
universities in order to increase
efforts for raising capital in this
time of a potential federal funding
crunch.
