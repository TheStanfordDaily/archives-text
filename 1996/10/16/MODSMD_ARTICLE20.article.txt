# Paragraph (c) of 209 opens up loophole for sex discrimination
## 
### 
Ryan Parks' column on Proposition 209
and affirmative action represents the igno
rance typical of those who vote based only

on the larger issues and do not read the
fine print accompanying each proposition.
Mr. Parks does a good job demon
strating his ignorance when he writes,
"Prop. 209 does nothing to limit the
chances of minorities or women . .
He obviously has not read past the first
section of the proposition. If he were to
continue on to part (c), he would read
the following: "Nothing in this section

shall be interpreted as preventing bona
fide qualifications based on sex which
are reasonably necessary to the normal
operation of public employment, public
education, or public contracting."
This sentence does, in fact, "limit the
chances of women" by creating a huge
loophole for sexual discrimination in the
job market. As a result, the proposition
allows for preferential treatment based

on gender in the hiring process, thereby
making it possible for women to be legal
ly excluded from any application process.
Because of this legal loophole, I urge
voters to read their ballot pamphlets and
vote no on Prop. 209. Voting yes on this
proposition would not abolish discrimina
tion, it would only encourage it.
