# Stanford Fund's goal debated by student
## 
### 
Regarding Stephen Peeps' letter in
which he writes that the Stanford Fund
is meant in part to increase the "excel
lence" of a Stanford education:

In light of how far from obvious it
is, I do not believe that any Stanford
administrators can assert that they are
interested in improving the quality of
our education without providing con
siderable evidence in favor of that
claim.
