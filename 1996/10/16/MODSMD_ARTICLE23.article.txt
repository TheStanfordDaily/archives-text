# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Smells like a rat: tracing the power outage to its source 
### 
AW, RATS! 7:26 p.m. Thursday
night. The night the lights went
out on Stanford. The night the
Internet snagged and the Web snapped.
Hundreds of companies in Silicon Valley
and elsewhere were cast off line. Thou
sands of e-mail messages, hundreds of
hours of network research and many
online newspapers were disrupted. Also,
several thousand games of Warcraft. Lost.
Altogether, power was out for the bet
ter part of a day (here I mean late after
noon and evening; conversely, morning is
the worst part of a day). Students found
different ways to cope. Some held sing
alongs, gathered 'round the guitar
(acoustic only). Others engaged in out
door / indoor watergun warfare. Casa
Italiana played a few rounds of Mafia.
Greeks streaked. The Band rallied.
Other students in a less playful mood
came trickling to those "peripheral" resi
dences on my end of the Row as we know
it, where electricity still flowed with wild
abandon. Some came with Powerbooks
and problem sets in hand. Some just came

to see friends. Some just came to see
"Friends."
(On the subject, one of my friends
wanted me to say here what "sweet and
just revenge Thursday night was for those
four days of finals last fall when our
power was out and nobody else on campus
gave a good g-ddamn!" Alas, I told him, I
just didn't think it right to mention that.)
As for me, at 7:26 p.m. I was finishing
a post-dinner session with some friends.
Just one of those poignant, heated philo
sophical / religious, is-there-right-or
wrong-or-even-free-will type of discus
sions that "Approaching Stanford"
always said you would have and that you
should theoretically have had in Cultures,
Ideas and Values but of course you didn't
because, hey, it's CIV. One of my friends
was just stating how he believed that
everything in life happened for a reason,
when the power blew. So we asked him,
why did the power blow? He didn't know.
Luckily, the answer wasn't long in
coming. Unwittingly, the culprits left
behind two key pieces of evidence that led

investigators right to them: themselves.
Found near the blown circuit were two
"fried, dead rats."
That's how the story goes. It was all
just a rat-infestation problem. A couple of
wayward rats found our Achilles' heel and
bit it hard. Where's the Pied Piper of
Hamelin when you need him? I mean, the
world's fastest (second-fastest?) network
system can only be so well protected. And
any system that advanced, that precari
ously perched on the cutting edge of tech
nology, is bound to have a few bugs in the
system. Or rats. At least, that's what we
are all supposed to believe.
Not me. The next day (Friday), I was
sitting in class (Psychology 131: "Lan
guage and Thought"), and I languidly
thought to myself that, in retrospect, the
situation was just a little suspicious.
Superficial tragedy though this may have
been, there were probably people out
there who were benefiting, I thought to
myself, not noticing as my professor
extended our due date to Monday.
Other thoughts filtered their way into

my brain. Reunion Homecoming Week
end. The Capitol Steps. "Must-See TV."
And I realized that the timing and the cir
cumstances were just too perfect for this
appalling episode to be simply the random
act of Mickey and Minnie. Are we really
supposed to believe that some inconsider
ate and inconsiderable roadkill is all it
took to shut down the information super
highway?
I smell a rat.
In fact, the whole situation stinks of a
cover-up. But whose? There's no real good
reason to blame any of the usual suspects.
Some fraternity houses still had power, so
that rules out Residential Education. The
alumni certainly wouldn't have pulled
this prank with so many of their own in
town. And my theory that reconstructs an
indirect trail to U.S. News & World
Report is shaky and contrived at best.
Maybe it was some techie-turned
technophobe who saw the end of the
world in the dawn of the Internet. Maybe
it was some sad Daily columnist desperate
for an interesting topic. Maybe it was all

just a psych experiment.
But for all my postulating, only one
thing remained almost certain — this was
an inside job. Making sure the right peo
ple say the right things, making sure The
Daily runs the right chicken-fried rat
photo on page one — all these things take
the right connections to do the job right,
right?
So in the end, all I'm convinced of is
that somebody out there pulled this ofT,
and whoever it was had a lot of moxie.
And if there's any lesson to be learned, it's
this: The only kind of good rat is a dead
rat, and everything happens for a reason.
Remember that. And the next time
something like this happens, don't be left
in the dark.

Yes, Mickey and Minnie are mice, not rats.
They are also cartoons that talk. What's
your point?
