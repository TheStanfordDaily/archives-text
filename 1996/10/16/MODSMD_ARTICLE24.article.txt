## Sound shadows How ears help you stay safe and sound 
### Jessen Yu Staff writer 
Q,How can we tell where a
• sound comes from ?
A. Being able to tell where
• sound comes from is a
very undervalued aspect of
human hearing. Just think
about how worse off our
species would be if we
couldn't tell where sounds
were coming from.
In prehistoric times, the
capability probably helped our
predecessors in hunting big,
woolly mammoths and avoid
ing lions, tigers and bears.
Later in history, it helped
peasants avoid getting run
over by horses. And today, it
allows you to tell whether it's
your phone, microwave, pager
or computer that's beeping at
you.
Obviously, our society
could never survive without
it.
Just like your two eyes
allow you to see in three
dimensions, your two ears
allow you to determine where
sounds are coming from.
The localization of sound,
as some experts are apt to call
it, is a more difficult problem,
though. Your eyes can move
around and focus on the
objects that you are trying to
see, but your ears are pretty
much stationary, unless
you're one of those freaks who
can wiggle them.
There are two main strate
gies used to determine where
a sound is coming from.
The first is the difference
in the loudness of the sound
reaching both ears.
For example, if you hear
someone talking in your right
ear, and all your left ear hears
is the muffled sounds of
human speech, it's probably a
sign.
Perhaps it means that not
only have you fallen asleep in
class again, but the person on
your right is trying to wake
you up to tell you to leave the
classroom so it can fumigated.
It turns out that your head
does a pretty good job of
blocking sounds from getting
around your head, causing a
big "sound shadow" where
sounds are quieter. This
makes it a lot easier to tell
where a sound is coming from.
The difference caused by
the shadow can have an effect
of up to 20 or 30 decibels. The
sound shadow, however,
works only when the wave
length of the sound is much
less than the size of your head.
This means that only higher
frequency sounds are affected
— like sirens, teapot whistles
or Kerri Strug's voice.
Interestingly, this applies
to all animals, and head size

affects the sounds that an ani
mal can locate effectively.
Animals with smaller heads
typically cannot hear lower
sound frequencies very well
but have better hearing for
higher frequencies. Large
headed animals, like ele
phants, typically cannot hear
very high-frequency sounds.

The difference in the time
when each ear first hears a
sound can also indicate where
the sound comes from. A
sound in front or in back of
you will reach both ears at the
same time, whereas a sound
from the right can reach your
right ear a few hundred
microseconds before it reach
es your left ear.
So why don't you hear two
sounds if the sound reaches
your ears at different times?
Your brain is actually very
good at telling which sounds
are the same ones.
For instance, your brain
can also filter out echoes
which occur soon after the ini
tial sound. In auditorium
sound systems, this is taken
advantage of by amplifying
the sounds coming from the
front and then playing them a
fraction of a second afterward
in the back of the room.
You hear the sound first
from the front of the auditori
um, but the louder sound
comes from the back. Your
brain, however, knows that
the sounds are the same, and
you are tricked into thinking
that the amplified sound
comes from the front.
There are other factors
which help you tell where a
sound is coming from, like
how sounds interact with the
shape of your ears.
These other factors help to
tell the distance and elevation
of a sound but are less well
understood.
They don't matter as
much, anyway, especially if
you're Vincent Van Gogh.
