# Monarchs begin annual migration
## Thousands of butterflies follow their instincts to Santa Cruz 
### Mignon Fogarty Contributing writer 
Every year, millions of
monarch butterflies migrate
south for the winter, and people
who live near their overwintering
habitats celebrate their return.
"Welcome Back, Monarch" cel
ebrations reigned last weekend in
Pacific Grove near Monterey and
in Santa Cruz's Natural Bridges
State Park, the region's most
monarch-rich sites.
While the parades and festivi
ties have already occurred, only
about 1,000 of the 100,000 butter
flies expected to visit the Santa
Cruz preserve have arrived. The
population in the eucalyptus grove
will peak in late November.
North America has two distinct
monarch populations separated by
the Continental Divide.
The butterflies that flutter into
Santa Cruz during the next weeks
have never been there before.
Often they are five generations
removed from last year's guests.
Differences in the seasons and
temperatures determine the lifes
pan of a butterfly generation.
Santa Cruz's cold temperatures
allow the winter generation to live
up to nine months. The summer
generations, maturing in warmer
climates, live only two months.
The secret to how the descen
dants know where to migrate each
year is a phenomenon that mysti
fies scientists and thrills resi
dents.
Nobody is certain why the but
terflies favor the eucalyptus groves
along the California coast. Howev
er, it is believed that the canyon at
Natural Bridges State Park pro
vides shelter from wind, as well as
offering filtered sunlight that
keeps the monarchs from freezing.
The trees also flower in the winter,
giving the butterflies a convenient
source of nectar for nourishment.
David Marriott, director of The
Monarch Program, was migrating
down the coast with the butter
flies in search of monarchs that
had been tagged by his program.
"We have volunteers in all the
different states west of the Rockies
tagging and monitoring monarchs
as they migrate," Marriott said. "If
anyone finds a butterfly with a tag,
they can call the 800 number [on
the tagl and find out when and
where it was tagged, whether it's a
male or female and whether it was
reared by us or not."
Julie Sidel, an interpretive spe
cialist at Natural Bridges State
Park, recounted a family finding a
tagged butterfly in the park.
"We brought them inside
where they were able to call the
researcher who had tagged the
monarch and find out when and
where it had originated from," she
said. "It was a very exciting expe
rience for the whole family."
While monarchs are not endan
gered, Sidel explained, "Their phe
nomenon of migrating and clus
tering is in danger.
"Migrating animals always
have a hard time because their
habitat isn't contained in one sin
gle location," she said. "Their
summer and winter spots and
everywhere along the way need to

be protected."
Part of the difficulty in main
taining their habitat is the picky
eating habits of the monarch lar
vae; they only eat milkweed plants.
According to Sidel, "Most peo
ple don't plant milkweed. In fact,
they consider it a nuisance. So as
the empty overgrown lots and
ditches disappear, the monarchs
have less and less habitat along
their route."
A butterfly garden of milkweed
is maintained at the preserve and
milkweed plants are sold to
encourage visitors to plant the
weed and create a habitat for but
terflies in their own yards.
The Monarch Program, .in addi
tion to for-profit ventures, has
found a more capitalistic way to
increase public appreciation and
awareness of the monarch: raising
monarchs for sale. Often these are
released at weddings or other spe
cial events, at a cost of about $7
per butterfly.
"As long as they're released, it
is very safe for the butterflies,"
said Marriott.
"They're sent by Federal
Express at the last minute and the
person gets them first thing in the
morning," added Christian Mari
on, assistant director of The
Monarch Program. "They do OK."
Monarchs require a minimum
of 55-degree weather to fly and
therefore will be most active on
warmer days.
Next month there will be thou
sands of monarchs in Santa Cruz,

but Sidel emphasized that huge
clusters of inactive monarchs can
be as fascinating as hordes flutter
ing in the sky.
"The beauty is that they're
always changing," she said. "Any
