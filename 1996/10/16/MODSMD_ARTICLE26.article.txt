# Researchers examine effect of carbon dioxide on ecosystem

While scientists are now fairly cer
tain the carbon dioxide level in the
atmosphere is increasing, they have
just begun work determining the
effects of the rise on the Earth's
ecosystems.
A research project recently com
pleted at Jasper Ridge Biological Pre
serve has tested the effects of carbon
dioxide on the grassland ecosystem.
Started in 1991, the Jasper Ridge
Carbon Dioxide Experiment has pro
duced several important findings.
One of the researchers is Chris
Field, a staff scientist in the Carnegie
Institution of Washington plant biolo
gy department, which is located at
Stanford. He called the Jasper Ridge
experiment "a whole new approach to
ecology."
Part of this approach is the focus on
whole ecosystems.
A fair amount is known about car
bon dioxide effects in the lab, Field
said, but "unless you include the rest
of the ecosystem in the experiment,
it's very hard to predict the outcome"
of real-world carbon dioxide increas
es.
Jasper Ridge's grassland environ
ment made it manageable to study 60
separate model ecosystems in the
field, each taking up less than 1 square
meter.
About 500 smaller artificial micro
cosms were created to allow even more
factors to be controlled and analyzed.

"With two to four experiments in
each microcosm, the entire project
looked at almost 1,500 model ecosys
tems, with a large range of water, fer
tilizer, soil and species combinations,"
Field said.
He added that exploring so many
different factors makes it easier to
generalize the results to different con
ditions, one of the main goals of the
Jasper Ridge project.
New technology and approaches are
starting to "move ecology from a
descriptive science to a predictive sci
ence," Field said.
This predictive ability may be very
important in understanding the
impact of the carbon dioxide produced
by human activities such as burning
fossil fuels.
According to Field, carbon dioxide
levels have increased by 30 percent
since the Industrial Revolution.
"Increased carbon dioxide is one
[global change) that has clearly
occurred already and is almost certain
to continue in the future," Field said.
Depending on how plants and
ecosytems react, they could either
slow this increase or accelerate it.
There have already been "2,000 to
3,000 papers on plant responses to
carbon dioxide," Field said. Almost all
of these tested the responses of indi
vidual plants rather than whole
ecosystems.
Past lab tests have pointed to
increased photosynthesis in a high
carbon dioxide atmosphere.
However, no one has studied how

carbon dioxide might affect the com
plex equilibrium of a real ecosystem —
where there are other variables
including species composition, micro
bial and insect pests, different soils,
and even grazing.
The Jasper Ridge study found,
among other things, that inherently
slow growing species are not helped
significantly by carbon dioxide, but
fast-growing species can grow as much
as 40 percent faster in the high-carbon
dioxide environment if nutrients are
plentiful.
High carbon dioxide levels also are
more of an advantage for plants when
water is a limiting factor.
Plants lose water to evaporation in
the process of absorbing carbon diox
ide through their leaves, so the more
carbon dioxide in the air, the more
efficient the absorption process and
the more water the plant can save.
Increased carbon dioxide also
caused changes in the mix of species
present, according to the study.
Summer-growing plants got a boost
from the water savings that carbon
dioxide made possible and in the end
made up 20 percent or 30 percent of
the population — up from the normal
5 percent to 10 percent.
The Jasper Ridge experiment pre
dicts a variety of outcomes if carbon
dioxide levels continue to rise.
According to the study, there will
be "large growth responses in some
systems, small growth responses in
others and extensive prospects for
species changes," Field said

a research project at Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.
