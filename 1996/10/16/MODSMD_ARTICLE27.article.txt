## Dons need miracle to beat soccer 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Men's soccer continues its tough schedule as it
faces San Francisco in a 3 p.m. contest today at
Maloney Field. The Dons (6-5) have strung to
gether four straight victories after getting off to a
shabby 2-5 start.
After Sunday's narrow 1-0 loss to the Washing
ton Huskies, the Cardinal (5-3-3,1-1-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) is looking to reassert it
self in the MPSF. Though Stanford thoroughly
outplayed No. 2 Washington on Sunday, the
Huskies came away with the victory.
"The loss was, of course, a disappointment,"
said sophomore midfielder A.J. Sauer. "That just
puts more of an emphasis on the upcoming
games."
The Dons will be just as hungry for a victory as
the Cardinal. They are now finally one game above
.500, and losing to Stanford would not only bring

them even but would also snap
their four-game winning streak.
Although the Dons are known to
be an all-around solid team, their
defense is particularly strong.
Headed by senior sweeper Erik
Lemoine, the Dons' defense has
surrendered only four goals in the
last six games and has not allowed
the opposition to score more than
two goals in a game since Oct. 6,
1995, a span of more than 20 con
tests.
Cardinal coach Bobby Clark said
the two key Don forwards, al
though rather slender, are quick
and dangerous. Senior striker
Michael Hunter is second on the
team in goals and points with five
and 11 respectively. Erik Lemoine,
also a senior forward, has been able

to utilize his 6-foot-3 frame to col
lect four assists. Both players will
certainly challenge the Cardinal de
fense with their speed and their
sudden and repeated counterat
tacks.
"The true test for our team will
be to see if we can keep our focus as
the season begins to wind down,"
Clark said. "This is often when
teams begin to fade. It is important
that we really concentrate on the
upcoming games against USF
[today] and California on Sunday."
Other players to watch for the
Dons are their leading scorer, se
nior forward Chris McDonald, and
sophomore goalkeeper Zach
Vaughn, who has a .5 goals-against
average, surrendering only two
goals in four games, including
shutouts of Cal State-Fullerton
and Navy.
"There is no reason to believe
that we cannot compete with any

team in the nation," said Dons head
coach Steven Negoesco.
Considering the fact that the
Dons have disposed of two top-20
teams already this season, Cal
State-Fuilerton and San Diego, he
is probably right.
The Dons "are going to be hun
gry for the victoiy," Sauer said.
"USF is also apparently playing
better ball lately than Washington,
so it's definitely going to be a chal
lenge."
USF usually plays a smart game,
using the entire field and switching
fields frequently. Like the Cardi
nal, the Dons often surprise teams
with quick counterattacks to catch
the opposition off guard. The quick
pace with which both teams like to
play may require each squad to test
its depth. Both schools have good
depth which should make the game
a fast-paced and hard-fought bat
tle.
