# Mader's humor lifts hockey on, off field
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
Teammates look up to her as the spiritual
leader; she initiates Cardinal spunk. Tri-cap
tains count on her to back them up; her play
ing is consistent on the field. The coach ex
pects her to do the job; she has the skill.
Junior Paige Mader, a starting member of
the Stanford field hockey team since her
freshman year, has played a cardinal role in
leading the squad to its remarkable current
overall record of 10-1.
"She has excellent speed," said coach Sh
eryl Johnson. "Together with (sophomore
forward) Carey (Cloyd) and (senior tri-cap
tain) Amy (Marfil), our right side is unstop
pable."
Everyone who has seen this group at work
would agree that teamwork is the squad's
crucial weapon; Mader is the Stanford
squad's communication tower that keeps the
team together both on and off the field.
"We really communicate well on the
team," said the talented midfielder. "But
sometimes when I see the team slacking off
(during the game), I try to get them going.
You can't always do this on your own, but it
is like a domino effect. If one person starts
[playing hard], it transfers to the other mem
bers of the team. I will definitely try to gen
erate [hustle] if I see a need for someone to
push the team."
"I heard Paige saying, 'It's your turn now,
you can do it, Mallory, you score,' " said
freshman Mallory Chambers, who put her
first varsity ball into the net two weeks ago.
"And I finally did it."
Mader's leadership and personality on the
battlefield does not stop there; teammates
often come to her and seek advice and com
panionship to help them through their prob
lems.
"Since I'm pretty goofy, and we can joke

around, I think my teammates feel comfort
able coming to me and talking to me about
serious things," said the modest brunette.
Even without her Cardinal uniform, the
5-foot-8 athlete is just as gravitating, ener
getic and spunky as she is on the field.
The super-jock who appears to be on top
of the world as well as the game is an English
major with a religious studies minor; like
many others, she cranks out papers just
hours before they are due.
"I like to hang out; I'm a big procrastina
tor," Mader said. "Last year, instead of say
ing how many more days we had till a paper
was due, my rcommate and I would start
talking hours."
Mader enjoys being the social manager for
her residence house, Lambda Nu, playing
pool with fellow residents after dinner and
spending time with her close friends.
Mader is an aggressive but easygoing
character whose friendly, outgoing nature
and good humor attracts everyone who sur
rounds her, both on and off the field.
The smiling hockey player who calls her
self "lighthearted and goofy" says she has
fun personifying herself as a "dumb jock."
"Stanford doesn't have too many dumb
jocks, and I think it's funny [to play the
role]."
The "tomboy who was always running
around" with her older brother started play
ing field hockey when she was in seventh
grade.
The born competitor also has a history of
lacrosse, figure skating and tree climbing
and enjoys mountain biking and skiing.
"I decided to pursue field hockey because
I really loved the game and the skill [it in
volves]," Mader said. "Field hockey is a big
part of my life, and I have never second
guessed it."

Sophomore forward Paige Mader works hard on the field but settles
for fun and games in her spare time.
However, the vivacious athlete
is not the "dumb jock" that she oc
casionally enjoys playing.
"I'm a student here first,"
Mader said, revealing a serious
side of herself which does not al
ways surface over her liveliness. "I
know the coach doesn 't like to hear
that, but I play it because I love the
game and not because I think I
want to do something with it in the
future."
In fact, the ever-energetic and
aspiring Mader has plans to get
into action off the field next quar
ter as well.
"I really can't do anything dur
ing the season," Mader said. But
she wants to get involved in the
Stanford Homelessness Action
Coalition.
