## Golf finishes in middle of field at Dallas 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
The Taylor Made Red River Golf
Classic did not yield a strong perfor
mance for the Stanford men's golf
team, which finished 16th with a 54-
hole total score of 881 yesterday. Held
at the 6,766-yard Dallas Athletic Club
Golf Course, this difficult tournament
will stand as a progressive, if not tran
sitory, step in the Cardinal's improve
ment.
"Although we finished toward the
bottom as a team, around 12 of the
teams there were ranked in the top 15,
so it was a strong field with a lot of low
scores," said senior Conrad Ray.
Team competition was fierce, with
Wake Forest posting a total team score
of 834 to win the team title over New
Mexico and USC, which both trailed at

a distant second with finishing scores
of 845. Rounding out the top five in
team competition were Ohio State and
Texas Christian, which tied for fourth
with a total of 847.
Individually, Chris Wollmann of
Ohio State garnered the first-place
title with a total score of 202 — a solid
three strokes over New Mexico's Doug
La Belle and Wake Forest's Ray Floyd,
who tied for second place with individ
ual finishes of 205 each.
Cardinal sophomore Joel Kribel
clinched the highest finish for a Stan
ford golfer, placing 39th in a tie at
even-par 216. Kribel's best score of 70
occurred in the first round on Sunday.
Kribel played a consistent game on
Monday and yesterday, shooting 73 on
both days.
The next best finish for a Stanford
golfer was Ray, who completed the

tournament with a total score of 219
and tied for 57th. Ray's lowest score
also occurred on Sunday when he post
ed a 72. In the second and third rounds
he finished with scores of 74 and 73, re
spectively.
Freshman Dusty Brett also made a
respectable showing in his first colle
giate tournament, closing with a tie for
78th place and a score of 225. Brett's
best score of 72 was in Monday's
round. He also shot a score of 75 on
Sunday and 78 yesterday.
Juniors Jake Poe and Eri Crum
wrestled to a tie, both finishing in 8» ih
place and with individual total scores
of 228. Poe and Crum went head to
head during Sunday's round, both
posting scores of 77. Poe jumped ahead
on Monday, shooting 71 to best Crum's
score of 78, but the final round turned
the upper hand back to Crum, who

bested Poe's score of 80 by posting a 73.
Despite the disappointing outcome
of the tournament, the men's golfers
continue to hold their heads high.
"1 think we have a really good team
unit," Ray said. "This week was only our
third tournament, and in terms of varsi
ty experience we're still very young."
In fact, Kribel and Ray are the only
golfers who have competed at the var
sity level for a full season prior to this
year. However, the youth of this year's
squad also promises that the team will
continue to improve as its members are
exposed to more varsity experience in
the future.
"We're slowly but surely getting
better," Ray said. "This week was just
another step in that improvement. Ul
timately, we are in preparation, be
cause the only tournament that really
matters is the NCAAs in the spring."
