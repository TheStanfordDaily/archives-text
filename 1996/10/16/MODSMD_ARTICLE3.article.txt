# Task force to examine Draw
## Casper discusses Res Ed, legal reform at ASSU meeting 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper told the ASSU Senate last
night that he will create a panel to
address a broad range of under
graduate housing concerns.
"In these five years I have had
innumerable opportunities to lis
ten to students ... and I have
heard numerous complaints with
regard to University housing and
the spring housing Draw," Casper
said, referring to annual lottery
system which determines campus
housing for the following year.
"Finally, having heard this
complaint once too often, I asked
for some detailed information on
the subject, but I could not under
stand one word of it,"he quipped.
He also noted that so many in
coming students request all
freshman dormitories that "the
demand is in excess of the supply
by 400 beds."
In an effort to address both
sets of needs and to examine the
larger role of Residential Educa
tion, Casper announced the for
mation of a Task Force on Resi
dential Programs and Student
Housing for Undergraduates.
The task force, to be chaired by
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldivar, is
charged with evaluating the sys
tem of housing assignments, as
well as the proper relationship be
tween residential programs and
undergraduate education.
Casper has already offered the
committee a number of options to
investigate, including giving stu
dents priority in the Draw as they
progress toward graduation and
differentiating programming to
meet the needs of first-year and
upperclass students.
Three University staff mem
bers, three faculty members and
three students — at least one of
whom will be a class president —
will comprise the task force. It
will report to Provost Condoleez
za Rice at the close of spring quar
ter.
Casper also instructed Nanci
Howe, director of the Office of

Student Activities, to ensure that
the Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee examines similar re
forms of the policies it oversees.
In addition, the president em
phasized the importance of the
debate that surrounds upcoming
legal reform proposals.
"I hope the ASSU and the stu
dent body generally will pay very
close attention to the work of the
Committee of 15," Casper said.
The committee is currently en
gaged in the re-examination of
the University's judicial policies.
The committee's recommenda
tions may include a highly contro
versial proposal to lower the bur
den of proof required to find a de
fendant guilty.
"Any changes in the present

system will require I the ASSU
Senate's] consent, the consent of
the Faculty (Senate] and my con
sent," Casper said. He encour
aged ASSU senators to talk with
their constituents regarding the
recommendations, adding that he
did not want the burden-of-proof
issue to endanger the entire re
form package.
The president also announced
his intention to hold "Casper's
Fortnightly Office Hours."
"The rules are very simple.
Students individually or in
groups may come to see me,"
Casper said. "Each slot is 15 min
utes."

dent's schedule on Oct. 29, Nov.
14 and Nov. 26. Appointments can
be made by calling the President's
Office at 723-2482.
Addressing ASSU Vice Presi
dent Nick Thompson's questions
regarding U.S. News & World Re
port's annual rankings of univer
sities, Casper restated his long
held position that University poli
cy is not made to appease exter
nalities.
"We do not engage in educa
tional reform to impress U.S.
News & World Report," Casper
said. "Education is too important
for that."
He did say, however, that he
disliked the manner in which the
news magazine ranked universi
ties.
"At the end of September, I
wrote [the editor of U.S. News &
World Report] a four page letter
and asked him to re-evaluate [the

ranking] endeavor," Casper said.
Casper added that he was inter
ested by Thompson's suggestion
that a coalition of top universities'
presidents collectively request an
end to or modification of the rank
ings.
Addressing a long-standing
goal, Casper also spoke about his
plan to expand the existing system
of small seminars offered to first
and second-year students.
"We must make it possible for
more students in the first two
years — especially during the
freshman year — to interact di
rectly with tenured faculty,"
Casper said.
The president reported that he
had received many positive en
dorsements of his plans from fac
ulty that have taught such cours
es.
He said his resolve to move
ahead with the plans was
strengthened by his experience
teaching a summer sophomore
seminar, which he termed the
most rewarding experience in his
career.

Casper also addressed the is
sues of declining research fund
ing, increased campus safety and
the preservation of most interdis
ciplinary programs. Saying he
was keenly interested in each of
those issues, he assured senators
that the University was actively
working in the interests of stu
dents.
Later in the evening, the senate
unanimously passed a resolution
denouncing the U.S. News &
World Report rankings, authored
by Senate Deputy Chair Joe Fre
und.
In other business, University
Registrar Roger Printup told the
senate that he supported its rec
ommendation that official tran
scripts include academic distinc
tions such as Rhodes scholarships
and Phi Beta Kappa membership,
as well as more explanatory
course descriptions.
The Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement is currently consid
ering changes to the format of
transcripts.
