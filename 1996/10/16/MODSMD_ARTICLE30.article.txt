# Could I take a look at that play again?

### 
I can't believe I am actually going
to write about what I am going
to write about. But after watch
ing the San Francisco 49ers lose to
the Green Bay Packers Monday
night on the heels of two controver
sial calls, I must say it — BRING
BACK INSTANT REPLAY!
Now, before you jump to too
many conclusions, let me clarify
some things. I am not in favor of the
instant replay practices of NFL

years past. The no-time limit, no
quantity limit instant replay sys
tem we had to endure a few years
ago interrupted each game and was
destructive to the game of football.
However, with the right guidelines
and with referees willing to follow
them, instant replay could be a
valuable asset to the NFL.
Let's look at last night's game.
The Niners were winning 17-6 in
the third quarter and appeared to
be en route to a surprisingly easy
victory over the NFI/s "hottest
team." That was until the Niners
got screwed.
On a third-and-long play mid
way through the third quarter,
Packer quarterback Brett Favre
dropped back to pass and was
flushed out of the pocket to his left.
As Favre rolled left, he threw a pass
across his body in the direction of
Packer Don Beebe, who made an

impressive diving catch.
As Beebe rolled on the ground,
Niner cornerback Marquez Pope
overran Beebe, clearly touching
him on the leg as he passed. The
play should have been whistled
dead as soon as Pope touched him,
but the refs didn't see the touch and
allowed Beebe to sprint toward the
end zone for six points.
As if allowing the touchdown
wasn't bad enough, the refs blew
the very next call on the Packers'
two-point conversion try. It was ob
vious that Edgar Bennett's knee
was down before he reached the
ball into the end zone, but the refs'
naked eyes failed to see the play
properly and the Packers pulled to
within three points of the Niners.
The rest, as they say, is history.
The Packers tied the game and sent
it into overtime, when place-kicker
Chris Jacke hit a 53-yarder to put
the final nail in the 49ers' coffin.
Whether or not you believe the
Packers were handed the game, as I
do, is immaterial. The fact is that
instant replay could have prevent
ed the desecration of last night's
game.
It's hard to believe the United
States Football League was able to
set any precedents in sports, but
that league had the right idea about
instant replay. Here's how it
should work:
Each team gets three challenges
each half for any call, in any situa
tion. If a team's head coach wants
to exercise a challenge, he throws a
flag onto the field and the referees
have 2 minutes to review the play.
If the coach ends up being correct,
the call is reversed and everyone,
except the opposing team, is happy.

Bernstein
If the coach is wrong, it costs his
team a timeout.
I know the NFL toyed with this
system in the preseason this year,
but the practice disappeared before
the regular season. The NFL seems
reticent to implement instant re
play for fear of alienating fans dur
ing games. I can think of no faster
way to do this, though, than allow
ing a bad call to ruin a game.
Additionally, when the NFL had
instant replay, league owners felt
that replays made officials less com
petent because they always had the
replays to fall back on. The new sys
tem addresses this concern, howev
er, because there is a maximum of
12 calls a game that could be con
tested. Realistically, though, no
coach would waste his timeouts

making petty challenges, so games
should only average two to four re
views.
Instant replay could have saved
last night's game. I know, as a
Niner fan, that last night's game
just sucked. However, if I were a
Packer fan, I don't think I could be
happy with the game either.
Looking back, I can think of
many big games that could have
been saved, too. Last year's Steel
ers-Colts AFC Championship
game, for example, was decided by
less than a touchdown, and had the
league had instant replay, the Neil
O'Donnell touchdown pass to Ko
rdell Stewart in the first half would
not have counted.
No one will ever know whether
the Colts would have won, or if the
Niners would have held onto their
lead last night. But it sure would
have been nice to have given them a
chance.
