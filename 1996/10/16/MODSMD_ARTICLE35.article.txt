# Menlo officials discuss Sand Hill
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
The Menlo Park City Council voted unanimously
last night to retain an independent expert to study the
traffic, economic and biological issues covered in the
final environmental impact report on the Stanford
Sand Hill Road Projects.
The report will be released by the City of Palo Alto
on Jan. 10.
The council, again unanimously, approved a motion
by council member Calvin Jones to give Palo Alto writ
ten notice of the fact that Menlo Park considers the
draft report on the project — released this summer —
to be inadequate.
The project combines proposals for Stanford West
Senior Housing, Stanford West Apartments and ex
pansion of the Stanford Shopping Center, with mtyor
traffic changes to the Sand Hill Road corridor. Critics
say the project would cause undue traffic burden and
significant environmental damage.
Menlo Park officials said they are concerned that the
project will have disproportionate impacts on their city.
Furthermore, according to City Attorney William
McClure, the final report will be susceptible to a legal

challenge if it contains "significant new information"
left out of the draft. In this case, Palo Alto may be forced
to recirculate its final report as a draft and reopen it for
public comment.
McClure also gained the council's approval to retain
an outside land-use attorney for "a comprehensive
analysis" of legal issues involved.
Council members have expressed strong concerns
that the independent experts used by Menlo Park may
not have enough time to reach their conclusions before
Palo Alto certifies the final report.
McClure said Menlo Park has no authority to force
Palo Alto to extend the mandatory 10-day waiting peri
od between giving involved agencies notice of the final
report and certifying it.
However, according to McClure, Palo Alto may not
even consider certification until it is ready to proceed
with the project, as it will have just as little time as
Menlo Park to evaluate the final report — described by
council member Dee Tolles as "7 inches of documents."
Jones said he originally wanted the council to pro
ceed with an interim legal action against Palo Alto but
reconsidered when McClure advised that the issue is
"not ripe for challenge" until the final report is re
leased.
