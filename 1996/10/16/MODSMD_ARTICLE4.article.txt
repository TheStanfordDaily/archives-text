# Shen denies improprieties

ASSU President Bill Shen at
tempted to fend off reports that
he has exhausted his annual
budget in an appearance before
the ASSU Senate last night.
"Many students within and
without of this room would like a
full disclosure of my finances
since taking office," Shen said.
"Well, Stanford students de
serve the truth."
Shen presented a statement
of accounts created by his office
and, he said, verified by a mem
ber of the ASSU's financial office
staff. ASSU Financial Manager
John Hall, however, said he had
not seen nor could he confirm
the information presented by
Shen.
Shen's statements showed he
had spent $3,226.01 of his
$7,250 programming budget,
leaving him $4,023.99.
Shen did not present a state
ment for his discretionary ac
count. Documents provided by
Hall show that the discretionary
account has less than $300 in it.
Shen spoke to and took ques
tions from the senate for nearly
an hour in response to an article
in yesterday's Daily, which indi
cated that the president has ex
hausted his allocated funds.
"I am not bankrupt or out of
funds, as The Daily would as
sert," Shen said.
The figures provided to the
senate reflect the removal of
some expenses incurred by last
year's Council of Presidents and
the depreciation of computer
equipment purchased for the
ASSU online course guide.
Shen's accounting, however,
omitted expenses that he has in
curred but for which he has yet
to file requests for payment.
