# Shen denies improprieties

### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
ASSU President Bill Shen at
tempted to fend off reports that
he has exhausted his annual
budget in an appearance before
the ASSU Senate last night.
"Many students within and
without of this room would like a
full disclosure of my finances
since taking office," Shen said.
"Well, Stanford students de
serve the truth."
Shen presented a statement
of accounts created by his office
and, he said, verified by a mem
ber of the ASSU's financial office
staff. ASSU Financial Manager
John Hall, however, said he had
not seen nor could he confirm
the information presented by
Shen.
Shen's statements showed he
had spent $3,226.01 of his
$7,250 programming budget,
leaving him $4,023.99.
Shen did not present a state
ment for his discretionary ac
count. Documents provided by
Hall show that the discretionary
account has less than $300 in it.
Shen spoke to and took ques
tions from the senate for nearly
an hour in response to an article
in yesterday's Daily, which indi
cated that the president has ex
hausted his allocated funds.
"I am not bankrupt or out of
funds, as The Daily would as
sert," Shen said.
The figures provided to the
senate reflect the removal of
some expenses incurred by last
year's Council of Presidents and
the depreciation of computer
equipment purchased for the
ASSU online course guide.
Shen's accounting, however,
omitted expenses that he has in
curred but for which he has yet
to file requests for payment.
Outstanding and unreported
expenses include: $1,081.50 paid to
the Stanford Police for bicycles reg
istered during the "buck-a-bike"
campaign; a $1,750 donation to
Ralph Nader's organization;
$535.70 for voter-registration ads
in The Daily; a $300 co-sponsorship
contribution to the Asian American
Students Association; a $50 co
sponsorship donation to the Inter
sorority Council; at least $600 in
publicity charges for the "buck-a

bike" campaign; and $3,000 for ad
hesive notepads.
Before the senate, Shen explicit
ly denied having "any undisclosed
expenses coming down the pike."
He continued to attest that numer
ous organizations would reimburse
him for these expenses.
Senators did agree to pay part of
the costs of the "buck-a-bike" effort
and the "Voice Your Choice" initia
tive. The senate transferred
$1,487.50 from its discretionary ac
count to the president's program
ming account for those initiatives.
Hall said he has received a com
mitment to help reimburse Shen's

accounts from only one other orga
nization — $1,750 from the ASSU
Speakers Bureau. That contribu
tion, however, is still subject to re
view.
Hall also agreed to contribute
$1,000 from Stanford Student En
terprises' funds for the adhesive
notepads on the condition that the
senate contribute an equal amount.
He had previously agreed to pay for
half the pads' cost, but the price
originally quoted by Shen was far
less than was actually spent.
The notes were significantly
more expensive, according to Shen,
because they were rush-ordered.
