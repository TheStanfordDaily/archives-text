# Bookstore rebate set at 10%
## 
### Hillary Stamm 
This year's Bookstore rebate checks — available
starting today — will be for 10 percent of submitted re
ceipts, up from 6 percent last year.
The increase in returns can be attributed to "a real
ly great year" financially for the Bookstore, according
to event coordinator Trish Keady.
"It was a really strong year for the store, which
means a better profit overall for everyone," Keady
said.
The Bookstore will be returning $400,000 to Stan
ford students, faculty and staff who saved their re
ceipts and submitted them by the deadline.
"We are pleased to return a significantly larger re
bate to our customers this year," said Bookstore Pres
ident and CEO Peggy Mendelson in a statement. "We
thank them for their business and support and hope to

continue serving them at the highest possible level."
Keady said the average rebate is $46 an envelope
but pointed out that many students submit more than
one envelope, thus making their overall return higher
than this average.
"We are so happy to be able to give back such big re
bates," Keady said. "It makes our jobs more fun."
In total, 7,687 envelopes were submitted, more
than 7,000 of which were from students. These num
bers reflect many students' affinity for their rebates.
Students agreed that the increased rebates are
great, considering the amount of money spent on
books each term.
"I spent a lot of money. I expect to get a lot back,"
said senior Blake Harris.
The Bookstore, a nonprofit organization, annually
divides a portion of its surplus be
tween the students, faculty and
staff who submit their book re
ceipts for the past year. The re
bates are paid on all book purchas

es made at the Bookstore but not
on other merchandise, such as
computers, school supplies or
clothes.
The store's board of directors
determines how much surplus is
available for rebate annually. That
total is then divided among those
customers who have submitted re
ceipts based upon the amount each

customer spent.
Rebates will be available from
the Bookstore today though Friday
this week. Staff will be in front of
the store from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Recipients must present valid stu
dent IDs to collect the check.
The Bookstore will mail checks
to those unable to pick them up in
person.
