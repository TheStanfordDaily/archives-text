# Bookstore rebate set at 10%

### Hillary Stamm 
This year's Bookstore rebate checks — available
starting today — will be for 10 percent of submitted re
ceipts, up from 6 percent last year.
The increase in returns can be attributed to "a real
ly great year" financially for the Bookstore, according
to event coordinator Trish Keady.
"It was a really strong year for the store, which
means a better profit overall for everyone," Keady
said.
The Bookstore will be returning $400,000 to Stan
ford students, faculty and staff who saved their re
ceipts and submitted them by the deadline.
"We are pleased to return a significantly larger re
bate to our customers this year," said Bookstore Pres
ident and CEO Peggy Mendelson in a statement. "We
thank them for their business and support and hope to

continue serving them at the highest possible level."
Keady said the average rebate is $46 an envelope
but pointed out that many students submit more than
one envelope, thus making their overall return higher
than this average.
"We are so happy to be able to give back such big re
bates," Keady said. "It makes our jobs more fun."
In total, 7,687 envelopes were submitted, more
than 7,000 of which were from students. These num
bers reflect many students' affinity for their rebates.
Students agreed that the increased rebates are
great, considering the amount of money spent on
books each term.
"I spent a lot of money. I expect to get a lot back,"
said senior Blake Harris.
