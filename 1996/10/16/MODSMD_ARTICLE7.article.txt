# 'Lay down your weapons and leave'
## Martin brings originality back to library's closing announcements 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
You peel your noble mien ofT the
vinyl green couch, wincing in agony
of the losing face. A voice had called
you out of the darkness.
"This is Ghengis Khan. My in
vincible Mongol hordes have swept
across the steppes of Asia, crushed
China, pillaged Persia, ruined Rus
sia and toppled even the fabled tow
ers of Christendom.
"Only your accursed citadel still
resists my might legions, but soon
you will stand against me no longer.
But because of your valor, if you lay
down your weapons and leave with
in 20 minutes, I will sp ire you and
grant you safe conduct to your
homes."
No — it wasn't a dream. It was
the voice of Ben Martin, the "Meyer
Libraiy announcement guy."
It's time to pack up your books
and continue your nap back at
home, for the lights will soon dim
and the doors of the libraiy will shut
against the world.
Each night, Martin, the night su
pervisor at Meyer, chooses from a
selection of 92 closing announce
ments.
"I try not to repeat them more
than once a quarter," Martin said.
"I wrote most of them when I first
got here. One student asked me to
write one about the O.J. Simpson
trial, but that's a touchy subject
You have to go back far enough in
history to avoid offending people."
Martin re ignited the torch song
of the midnight announcements at
Meyer.
"I remember when they did a rap
song, a subliminal message rou
tine," he said. "However, the prac
tice had elapsed in the late '80s.

When I came to Meyer, I saw it as an
opportunity to be creative, to ex
press an aesthetic."
There are three kinds of an
nouncements. Martin said he im
personates famous people or liter
ary figures, portrays silly situations
or makes use of alliteration.
Mart in has become an icon in the
collective campus imagination.
"He's like the telephone time
lady," said senior Ed Tran. "You
don'texpect him to say anything else
besides announcements. It's strange
hearing him talk out of context."
Although the pages of the daily
planner get scribbled in and the
highlighters dry up as the quarter
goes by, students find a source of

comfort in Martin.
"It's nice to know that some
things in the world don't change,"
said senior Greg Woodhead. "The
announcement guy is a constant in
my life."
Stanford has been a constant in
Martin's life since he came here as
an undergraduate.
"I've been at Stanford more or
less since the early '705," Martin
said. In that time, he's seen win
dows broken at the Hoover Institu
tion, a professor fired for inciting
students to disrupt speeches and
the now-razed trailer park sprout
up into Manzanita.
