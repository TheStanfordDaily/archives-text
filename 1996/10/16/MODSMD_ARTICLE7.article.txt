# 'Lay down your weapons and leave'
## Martin brings originality back to library's closing announcements 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
You peel your noble mien ofT the
vinyl green couch, wincing in agony
of the losing face. A voice had called
you out of the darkness.
"This is Ghengis Khan. My in
vincible Mongol hordes have swept
across the steppes of Asia, crushed
China, pillaged Persia, ruined Rus
sia and toppled even the fabled tow
ers of Christendom.
"Only your accursed citadel still
resists my might legions, but soon
you will stand against me no longer.
But because of your valor, if you lay
down your weapons and leave with
in 20 minutes, I will sp ire you and
grant you safe conduct to your
homes."
No — it wasn't a dream. It was
the voice of Ben Martin, the "Meyer
Libraiy announcement guy."
It's time to pack up your books
and continue your nap back at
home, for the lights will soon dim
and the doors of the libraiy will shut
against the world.
Each night, Martin, the night su
pervisor at Meyer, chooses from a
selection of 92 closing announce
ments.
"I try not to repeat them more
than once a quarter," Martin said.
"I wrote most of them when I first
got here. One student asked me to
write one about the O.J. Simpson
trial, but that's a touchy subject
You have to go back far enough in
history to avoid offending people."
Martin re ignited the torch song
of the midnight announcements at
Meyer.
"I remember when they did a rap
song, a subliminal message rou
tine," he said. "However, the prac
tice had elapsed in the late '80s.

When I came to Meyer, I saw it as an
opportunity to be creative, to ex
press an aesthetic."
There are three kinds of an
nouncements. Martin said he im
personates famous people or liter
ary figures, portrays silly situations
or makes use of alliteration.
Mart in has become an icon in the
collective campus imagination.
"He's like the telephone time
lady," said senior Ed Tran. "You
don'texpect him to say anything else
besides announcements. It's strange
hearing him talk out of context."
Although the pages of the daily
planner get scribbled in and the
highlighters dry up as the quarter
goes by, students find a source of

comfort in Martin.
"It's nice to know that some
things in the world don't change,"
said senior Greg Woodhead. "The
announcement guy is a constant in
my life."
Stanford has been a constant in
Martin's life since he came here as
an undergraduate.
"I've been at Stanford more or
less since the early '705," Martin
said. In that time, he's seen win
dows broken at the Hoover Institu
tion, a professor fired for inciting
students to disrupt speeches and
the now-razed trailer park sprout
up into Manzanita.

Ben Martin is the man behind the voice making closing announce
ments at Meyer Library.
"I came in at the end of the anti
war protests," Martin said "It was a
tense time. Students were con
cerned. After all, men were still sub
jected to the draft. Fringe political
groups were more attractive then
than nowadays."
Once Martin went back to visit
the incubator of his Stanford experi
ence — his freshman dorm, Larkin,
in Stern Hall.
"My room had disappeared,"
Martin said. "They tore it out for the
resident fellow suite."
In 1974, Martin graduated from
Stanford with a degree in what he
calls "the history of Western con
sciousness," exploring "the impact
of technology on humanity."
Martin was accepted into the doc
toral program on the history of ideas
at Brandeis University.
"I wanted to examine the role of
nature in modern times. I looked at a
case study of Hetch-Hetchy, a valley
north of Yosemite which also had the

waterfalls, the sheet rock cliffs, the
narrow valley. That made it a good
reservoir site for San Francisco,"
Martin said." I looked at the literature
of debate between San Francisco and
John Muir and other naturalists."
Martin stayed three years at
Brandeis. "The residency agree
ment was for two years. I didn't like
the weather, the atmosphere from
the East Coasts, so I came back to
Stanford," he said. "I had part-time
jobs, some at the library. I re-estab
lished ties with professors and
worked on my dissertation here."
In 1982, Martin received his doc
torate and began looking for a job as
a university professor.
"I came into the economy at a bad
time," he said. "Due to the drop in
the U.S. birthrate two decades ago,
there was the smallest number of
18-year-olds ever. Fewer instructors
were required."
Martin began working full time
in Green Library in the stack divi
sion. From there, he began a succes
sive string of positions at different li
braries, moving from Green to the
Art and Architecture Library and
then finally to Meyer.

"The atmosphere here is more
hang-loose with the undergradu
ates. There are no dour graduate stu
dents and professors," Martin said.
Only once has a student com
plained; this was via the suggestion
box in the 24-hour study room.
"He wrote me that my announce
ments were annoying people who
were studying and to please stop for
the benefit of silence and sanity,"
Martin said.
Martin responded by posting this
explanation: "Any closing an
nouncement, no matter how prosa
ic, would interrupt students' trains
of thought. My creative embellish
ments may slight intensify the dis
traction and extend it by 10 to 15 sec
onds, but most of the distracting ef
fects would remain even with the
most basic announcements.
"And we cannot eliminate the an
nouncements, for they are vital in
evacuating the building. Any stu
dent who has not cleared out of
Meyer by closing time is subject to
disciplinary action and possible ar
rest."
For now, Martin will continue to
arrest student interest.

and continue your nap back at
home, for the lights will soon dim
and the doors of the libraiy will shut
against the world.
Each night, Martin, the night su
pervisor at Meyer, chooses from a
selection of 92 closing announce
ments.
"I try not to repeat them more
than once a quarter," Martin said.
"I wrote most of them when I first
got here. One student asked me to
write one about the O.J. Simpson
trial, but that's a touchy subject
You have to go back far enough in
history to avoid offending people."
Martin re ignited the torch song
of the midnight announcements at
Meyer.
"I remember when they did a rap
song, a subliminal message rou
tine," he said. "However, the prac
tice had elapsed in the late '80s.

When I came to Meyer, I saw it as an
opportunity to be creative, to ex
press an aesthetic."
There are three kinds of an
nouncements. Martin said he im
personates famous people or liter
ary figures, portrays silly situations
or makes use of alliteration.
Mart in has become an icon in the
collective campus imagination.
"He's like the telephone time
lady," said senior Ed Tran. "You
don'texpect him to say anything else
besides announcements. It's strange
hearing him talk out of context."
Although the pages of the daily
planner get scribbled in and the
highlighters dry up as the quarter
goes by, students find a source of

comfort in Martin.
"It's nice to know that some
things in the world don't change,"
said senior Greg Woodhead. "The
announcement guy is a constant in
my life."
Stanford has been a constant in
Martin's life since he came here as
an undergraduate.
"I've been at Stanford more or
less since the early '705," Martin
said. In that time, he's seen win
dows broken at the Hoover Institu
tion, a professor fired for inciting
students to disrupt speeches and
the now-razed trailer park sprout
up into Manzanita.


Lunnon Miles — Daily
Ben Martin is the man behind the voice making closing announce
ments at Meyer Library.
"I came in at the end of the anti
war protests," Martin said "It was a
tense time. Students were con
cerned. After all, men were still sub
jected to the draft. Fringe political
groups were more attractive then
than nowadays."
Once Martin went back to visit
the incubator of his Stanford experi
ence — his freshman dorm, Larkin,
in Stern Hall.
"My room had disappeared,"
Martin said. "They tore it out for the
resident fellow suite."
In 1974, Martin graduated from
Stanford with a degree in what he
calls "the history of Western con
sciousness," exploring "the impact
of technology on humanity."
Martin was accepted into the doc
toral program on the history of ideas
at Brandeis University.
"I wanted to examine the role of
nature in modern times. I looked at a
case study of Hetch-Hetchy, a valley
north of Yosemite which also had the

waterfalls, the sheet rock cliffs, the
narrow valley. That made it a good
reservoir site for San Francisco,"
Martin said." I looked at the literature
of debate between San Francisco and
John Muir and other naturalists."
Martin stayed three years at
Brandeis. "The residency agree
ment was for two years. I didn't like
the weather, the atmosphere from
the East Coasts, so I came back to
Stanford," he said. "I had part-time
jobs, some at the library. I re-estab
lished ties with professors and
worked on my dissertation here."
In 1982, Martin received his doc
torate and began looking for a job as
a university professor.
"I came into the economy at a bad
time," he said. "Due to the drop in
the U.S. birthrate two decades ago,
there was the smallest number of
18-year-olds ever. Fewer instructors
were required."
Martin began working full time
in Green Library in the stack divi
sion. From there, he began a succes
sive string of positions at different li
braries, moving from Green to the
Art and Architecture Library and
then finally to Meyer.

"The atmosphere here is more
hang-loose with the undergradu
ates. There are no dour graduate stu
dents and professors," Martin said.
Only once has a student com
plained; this was via the suggestion
box in the 24-hour study room.
"He wrote me that my announce
ments were annoying people who
were studying and to please stop for
the benefit of silence and sanity,"
Martin said.
Martin responded by posting this
explanation: "Any closing an
nouncement, no matter how prosa
ic, would interrupt students' trains
of thought. My creative embellish
ments may slight intensify the dis
traction and extend it by 10 to 15 sec
onds, but most of the distracting ef
fects would remain even with the
most basic announcements.
"And we cannot eliminate the an
nouncements, for they are vital in
evacuating the building. Any stu
dent who has not cleared out of
Meyer by closing time is subject to
disciplinary action and possible ar
rest."
For now, Martin will continue to
arrest student interest.
