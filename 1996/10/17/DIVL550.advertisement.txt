FOR THE RECORD...
An article in yesterday's Daily reported that ASSU President
Bill Shen had committed to "a $1,750 donation to Ralph Nader's
organization." That $1,750 is a payment to the American
Program Bureau, Nader's agents, as an honorarium for his
speech on campus last night. It was not a donation to any of
Nader's advocacy groups or to the Green Party.
