And that's just what you want: an annuity that works harder than you do.
TIAA's Tcachers Personal Annuity* is specifically
designed to provide tax-deferred growth potential to
people who are already contributing the maximum

after-tax money in taxable savings or investments. With
TIAA's long-term, after-tax savings annuity, you can
take advantage of the security of the Fixed Account,
the growth potential of the variable Stock Index Account,
or a combination of the two accounts.
You also benefit from ■ Low initial investment require
ments ■ The convenience of making regularly-sched
uled deposits to your account via Electronic Funds
Transfers ■ No current surrender charges ■ No-fee
transfers between Teachers Personal Annuity accounts*
■ The flexibility of having no minimum withdrawal
requirements at age ■ The retirement expertise of
the largest pension system in the United States (based on
assets under management).
