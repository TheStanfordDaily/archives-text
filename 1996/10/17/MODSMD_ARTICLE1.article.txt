# 'You don't have burrs under your saddle... something to shake you up.'
## Nader urges student activism 
### Kelly E. Young Contributing writer 
Memorial Auditorium was filled nearly to capacity
last night with students who decided to follow the
evening's televised presidential debates with live com
mentary from Ralph Nader.
Nader, the Green Party's presidential candidate and
a longtime consumer advocate, focused his speech on
fighting America's corporate giants.
Nader, who fought the auto industry in the 19605,
said the federal government put $1.5 billion toward a
merger of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta. He sug
gested this money could have been put to better use on
consumer needs like auto safety, infant nutrition, edu
cation and meat and poultry inspection.
"The determinants of federal spending are increas
ingly corporate determinants," he said.
He also voiced concern over adults being too busy in
today*B corporate world to raise their children.
"Corporations are increasingly raising our children.
These kids are learning to converse, and they have a vo
cabulary smaller than Esperanto," he joked. "McDon
ald's is feeding them. Time Warner is entertaining them
.... Then the addictive industries get them — tobacco,
alcohol, drugs."
Nader encouraged individuals, particularly stu
dents, to exercise their civic duty and to take control of
where their tax dollars wind up.
"You don't have burrs under your saddle," he told
the crowd. "You don't have something to shake you up."
He challenged the students "to think, to challenge, to
dream of what you can do to advance justice in the
world.
"The people on Capitol Hill, with a few exceptions, do
not want organized citizens watching over their shoul
der," Nader said.
According to ASSU President Bill Shen, Nader's
speech is just the first in a series of appearances by politi
cians, part of the ASSU's Voter Education Project. Re
form Party presidential candidate Ross Perot, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and author Dinesh D'Souza will also be
coming to campus before the Nov. 5 election.
"We not only try to bring prominent speakers but
speakers we feel have something to share," Shen said.

Ralph Nader urged students to fight corporate America in a
speech at Memorial Auditorium last night.
"We're not bringing in people from
tin l Clinton campaign or the Dole
campaign."
"Politics tend to kike a hack seat
on this campus," he said. "There's

something riding on this election."
Earlier in the evening, organiz
ers were concerned that Nader —
who also had an appearance in San
Francisco today — might not show
up for his speech tonight. He did not
arrive at the ASSU office in Tresid
der Union at 6 p.m. as scheduled.
According to ASSU Vice Presi
dent Nick Thompson, Nader's man

ager had told student organizers in
the afternoon that everything was
moving on schedule. But just before
the scheduled speech time of 8 p.m.,
no one had seen the speaker.
Nader ultimately arrived at the
auditorium a few minutes after 8
p.m. Organizers had decided to call
the event off at 8:15 p.m. if Nader
had not yet arrived.
