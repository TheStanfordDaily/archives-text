# Dole lashes out in debate

### 
SAN DIEGO (AP) — Out to revive his
White House hopes with just 20 days to
go to the election, Bob Dole accused
President Clinton in their final debate
yesterday of violating the public's trust
by presiding over an administration with
"scandals almost on a daily basis."
Dole was the aggressor from the out
set in a 90-minute, town hall-style forum
at the University of San Diego. No mat
ter the subject, Dole sought to turn his
response into a critique of Clinton. But
he spoke in a calm, measured voice,
eager not to appear overly negative.
In addition to faulting Clinton's ethi
cal record, Dole forcefully accused the
president of misleading voters by saying
Republicans were trying to cut Medicare.
"When I am president of the United
States, I will keep my word," Dole said.
"My word is my bond."
Dole said "many Americans have lost

faith in government" because "they see
scandals on an almost daily basis — they
see ethical problems in the White House
today."
Dole specifically mentioned the Clin
ton White House's collection of more
than 900 sensitive FBI background files
— many of them on prominent Republi
cans.
"You have to keep that public trust"
as president, Dole said. "I think now that
trust is being violated."
Clinton tried to remain above the
fray, letting several attacks pass unan
swered. He did not immediately respond
directly to Dole's criticisms on ethical
problems but protested Dole's claim he
was trying to cut too deeply into the
defense budget.
Dole also attacked Clinton for his
massive health care reform package, call
ing it "an extreme medical plan."

Dole and Clinton took questions from
a group of 113 undecided voters from the
San Diego area who were selected by the
Gallup polling organization.
A young woman asked Dole if his age
— 73 — would make it hard for him to
understand the concerns of younger
Americans.
"I think it is also a strength, an
advantage," Dole said of hi.s age, saying it
gives him experience, intelligence and
wisdom.
Clinton said he wouldn't make Dole's
age an issue but said "it's the age of his
ideas I object to." He cited supply-side
economics chief among them. "We tried
this before," Clinton said.
Dole shot back "when you don't have
any ideas, I guess you say the other per
son's ideas are old." He evoked Clinton's
unfulfilled 1992 campaign promise to
cut middle-class taxes
