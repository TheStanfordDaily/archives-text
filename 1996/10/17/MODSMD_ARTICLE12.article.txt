Shen's current spending
habits do not bode well
for his financial future

THE FINANCES OF the vari
ous ASSU offices and com
mittees are understandably
not the object of much passion
around campus. And slugging
through line-item budgets isn't
anyone's idea of great fun.
But Stanford students, via the
annual general election, have a
great deal of control over which
people and which organizations
actually get their hands on real
money. Thus, they have every rea
son to keep tabs on how and how
much money ASSU officials actual
ly spend.
This past week has witnessed a
mini-drama swirling around the
finances of ASSU President Bill
Shen's office, and students have
good reason to be worried about the
fiscal health of the president's
office.
The fundamental problem here
is a basic asymmetry between
Shen's ambitions and the resources
of the president's office. Shen, the
first single president in decades,
has made clear that he intends to
raise the profile of the ASSU and
particularly the presidency. And
while some might see this effort as
self-serving, Shen's performance so
far indicates a genuine attempt to
make ASSU services and events
integi al to students' lives. For this,
he should be commended.
However, as Shen surely recog
nizes, he has only a limited amount
of money to spend over the course
of his term, and he must act very
prudently when he starts signing
checks. He only has $7,250 to
spend on programming and opera
tions for the whole year, and his dis
cretionary budget is a paltry
$2,000. Not exactly an imperial
presidency.
Shen has already complained
that his budget is "inadequate . . .
for the purposes of an effective sin

gle president," and he has a point.
His suggestion that the president's
office receive a higher budget in
future years is reasonable and
ought to be considered before next
year's ASSU budget is set.
But Shen needs to focus on this
year.
Last night, he presented the
ASSU Senate with a document
showing that his office has only
spent around $3,200 of its desig
nated programming and operations
budget. But his figures, which indi
cate that he still has more than
$4,000, leave out a considerable list
of spending commitments, chief
among them the now-infamous
$3,000 adhesive notepads.
What's more, Daily records indi
cate that he owes $535.70 to The
Daily's advertising department,
$700 to the Stanford Democrats for
winning the voter registration con
test and $300 to the Asian Ameri
can Student Association for co
sponsoring a campus event.
Except for the $1,000 that ASSU
Financial Manager John Hall has
pledged for the pads, it is unclear
how Shen plans to cover all of these
expenses. Borrowing from his dis
cretionary budget does not seem to
be an option because that account
appears to be down to less than
$300.
Unless Shen can convince the
senate or Hall to bail him out again,
he will find his office in debt by the
end of the quarter. Needless to say,
that would be a disaster for the
ASSU, for the president and for all
students.
The numbers can only be mas
saged for so long; Shen's budget
will not magically expand to fill his
commitments. He needs to act now
to ensure that his office will remain
solvent through the remainder of
the fiscal year.
The president's intention to
spend every last cent of the money
allocated to his office is his preroga
tive, and his efforts to boost the
ASSU's visibility are fine. But he
should realize that the best way to
improve the ASSU's image is to
spend his money responsibly.
