Affirmative action necessary at the collegiate level

I WAS DISMAYED by Ryan C. Parks'
harsh attack on affirmative action
and his uninformed promotion of
Proposition 209, the "California Civil
Wrongs Initiative." There are several
issues which Mr. Parks disregarded and
misinterpreted, in the areas of both
affirmative action and Prop. 209.
First of all, Mr. Parks referred to
Prop. 209 as "as straightforward as
propositions come." If the measure is so
straightforward, why are the words
"affirmative action" present nowhere in
its text? The proposition is deliberately
ambiguous and misleading because its
authors know that the majority of Cali
fornians favor affirmative action and do
not want to see it dismantled.
Race is not the deciding factor at
work in the admissions process. Many
qualities are factored into the equation.
Being a legacy (which applies to mainly
white applicants) is another example of
such a factor. However, I would venture
to say that admissions can be considered
arbitrary by nature and are based on
subjective characteristics, such as talent
and personality. Individual merit cer
tainly is not an objective quality when it
concerns something other than pure
academic performance.
Affirmative action is necessary on the
collegiate level for two reasons. First of
all, we are being educated in order to
make a difference and leave the world

better than we found it. If Stanford was
not as diverse as it is, many students
would remain unaware of the many
injustices which plague women and peo
ple of color. Without being exposed to
the viewpoints of others and their feel
ings about the obstacles which they face,
Stanford students would not be aware of
whom has been forgotten in past efforts
to improve the status quo.
Secondly, a good education is the first
step toward a good career. If a woman or
a person of color wishes to succeed and
serve as a role model for others, he or
she must have the tools to become
prominent and prosperous. The glass
ceiling is still entrenched in the infras
tructure of corporate America, but it is
much harder for employers to justify
their rejection of women and people of
color if those job applicants are as well
educated and well-qualified as possible.
The idea that an applicant is stealing
a place in a university from someone
else because the applicant is a woman or
person of color is a complete myth, fabri
cated to conquer and divide people who
believe in fairness and equality of oppor
tunity. Each one of us is here at Stan
ford in place of many others who wanted
to be here and who might have been just
as well qualified.
There are efforts to equalize elemen
tary and secondary school education
and they should continue to be pursued.

However, I remind Mr. Parks that pub
lic education is often a matter left to
local governments; complete equaliza
tion can never occur because communi
ties and their priorities are all different.
Therefore, no two school systems will
ever treat their own students identical
ly. The consequences of assuming that
bottom-up equalization techniques will
eclipse any need to equalize at the colle
giate level could be extremely detrimen
tal. For example, I would hate to think
that a woman could be seen as less ath
letically talented than another person
because her school prioritized men's
sports over women's sports.
Race-based admissions policies do not
insult women and people of color. They
ensure that we will have the same
opportunities as others.
"Race is not a handicap and is in no
way related to ability." For once, Mr.
Parks, you are correct. If everyone
agreed with you, affirmative action
wouldn't be necessary. Unfortunately,
discrimination still exists, and ignoring
it is not the solution. Prop. 209 doesn't
just eliminate affirmative action on cam
pus. It could have the legal ramifications
of closing down women's centers, elimi
nating job recruitment aimed at women
and people of color, weakening women's
studies and ethnic studies programs at
state colleges and universities, reinstat
ing job ads under the categories of "men

wanted" and "women wanted," and
allowing employers to reject female job
applicants because the possibility of
maternity leave could weaken the pro
ductivity of the company.
Prop. 209 is an amendment to our
state constitution. Most of our protec
tion against discrimination has been
adopted by the courts, and an amend
ment would take precedence over all of
them. Even if you feel that affirmative
action is not beneficial in its present
form, please consider the ramifications
of rendering it completely illegal. The
extent of Prop. 209 will be up to the
courts to interpret. I would rather not
take that chance. Would you?
For more information, come to No on
209 Coalition meetings Thursdays at
7:30 p.m. in El Centro Chicano. If you
are interested in other issues concerning
women, come to a National Organiza
tion for Women meeting Tuesday, Nov.
12, at 7 p.m. in the Women's Center.
Also, be sure to wear a red shirt today to
express your disdain for Prop. 209.
