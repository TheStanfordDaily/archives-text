## Loneliness, schmonliness 
### 
Loneliness is the common
denominator of most of the
lifestyles at Stanford. It's evident
in even the tiniest day-to-day occur
rences: recognizing someone in the row
ahead of you in class but saying noth
ing; seeing someone on the street who
was in your freshman dorm and sud
denly finding something very engaging
in the sidewalk crack flora when he or
she approaches you; all-nighters with
the door wide open, watching people
walk into the room next door; fraterni
ty parties.
In almost all of these instances, one
or more of the parties involved would
like to interact with another party.
Generally, a pervasive feeling of the
possibility of rejection fills the air, and
both parties are left sitting alone, walk
ing alone, studying alone or dancing
alone, as it were, because it is so much
easier to seem nonchalant than to act as
if you give a damn. It's so much easier
not to try.
Take the prevalence of the belief that
there is no dating at Stanford. Here,
just as in any other social setting, those
who have whatever talent or knowledge
is required to earn the good graces of
whatever sex(es) they prefer are the
ones who get the Stanford version of
dates: someone to talk to for long peri
ods of time, to do homework with and
occasionally kiss. This, to me, doesn't
sound dramatically different than what
goes on outside of Stanford. So why is

the dating question such a big deal
here? Because the majority of us care so
much about dating and having friends
that we put no effort into it.
Most undergraduate Stanford stu
dents are such social misfits in the real
world (I am no exception), that they
expect to be social misfits here, as well.
So we try as hard as we can to seem as
if we don't care because the more we
don't seem to care, the less likely it is
that people will notice that we do. The
smarter we pretend to be, the less peo
ple will notice that we sit alone in our
rooms most of the time. Unfortunately,
this puts us in a bind. We don't want to
put ourselves out there to get hurt, but
we also don't have very fulfilling rela
tionships.
So, I am proposing a solution to lone
liness: effort. All too often, I have been
the witness and / or victim of a lack of
effort. Friendships die because of it;
friendships never begin because of it;
people avoid others because of it; people
sit lonely in their rooms because of it. I
think that a great many of the social ills
out here would be solved if we all just
took some time out to put a little more
of ourselves into what we do and how
we act.
Don't worry about whether or not
someone knows that you feel a certain
way about them — let them know.
Don't assume that the person down
stairs doesn't want to talk to you — try
to have a conversation. Don't just let

that great relationship go to hell
because you are afraid to say something
— take action. Say hi to the people you
pass on the street, invite the loners in
your dorm to go out partying with you
and your friends. Try, for your sake, as
well as someone else's.
Rejection sometimes happens; it's
OK. Don't spend time dwelling on rejec
tion because it usually doesn't happen
(I am not speaking of the sexual sphere
here).
But effort doesn't just end there. If
you are lonely yourself, make a move.
Stake your territory. Let the world
know that you are available for commu
nication, and that the time has Finally
come to make contact.
It doesn't make sense that one
should feel more lonely at a large
school, where there are more people to
choose from. Small fish in a big pond,
my arse. No one is fooled by your reflec
tive shades (I have a pair, too); no one
thinks that you really love having no
one knock on your door ever (I certain
ly don't love it) so stop trying to seem
like you don't care.
Make the effort and I am willing to
bet that eventually, others will, too.
