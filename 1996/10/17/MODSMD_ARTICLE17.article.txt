# Brian Singer: First Impressions
## Russian Jews: Creating meaningful traditions 
### 
I REALLY DIDN'T expect the noise.
Everyone was talking to each other,
occasionally glancing up to the front
of the expansive, centuries-old building.
After straining unsuccessfully to see in
the back of the large hall, I waded
through the sea of covered heads to the
front of the synagogue.
The clapping provided a respite to the
near pandemonium. At first, I didn't
even notice it. One person began to clap
slowly, beckoning for others to join him.
Suddenly, everyone was clapping. I felt
my head rise, and my eyes saw the
Torah, the holiest Jewish text, shrouded
in jewels and a beautiful crown, circulat
ing around the synagogue.
I knew why the hundreds of other
Jews in the Moscow synagogue had
come. The talking had stopped. Every
one faced the Torahs; now there were
four.
Those Torahs were being mauled.
Normally, I like to be in the center of
things, but I watched from afar until
they approached my pew. With one of

the few prayer books in the synagogue, I
touched the Torah and then kissed it.
This was the tradition I learned, my par
ents learned, and their parents learned.
But most of the other people in the
Moscow Synagogue on Simchat Torah,
the holiday celebrating the simultane
ous conclusion and beginning of the
Torah, were making traditions. For the
first time since possibly before Peter the
Great, Russian Jews are free to make,
break and observe Judaism.
Because of the lack of institutional
memory, few Jews (Yevrei in Russian)
are knowledgeable about the religious
aspects of Judaism. But the cultural
aspect is very alive. Jewish texts didn't
die either, not during the pogroms of the
czarist years, nor during 74 years of
Communism.
The American-style auction that fol
lowed proved that the Jews who gath
ered in the synagogue that Saturday
night treasure the Torah above all else.
In America, many synagogues solicit
donations during the two major holi

days, Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.
Given the low wages and a poor Russian
economy, I didn't expect any kind of
appeal that night. But as the Torah
returned to the front of the synagogue, I
suddenly heard people shouting a series
of numbers and finally raz, dva, tri (one,
two, three) . . . sold! Yes, they were auc
tioning off the right to carry the Torah
around the synagogue for the second of
its seven laps.
This was funny, I thought, since talk
of money in this manner is usually for
bidden on holidays. I walked closer to
determine what the going price was.
Five hundred thousand rubles, anyone
else? One million! Raz, dva, tri, sold.
Two hundred dollars spent just to carry
a Jewish text around the synagogue.
I watched as a Russian man, about 50
years old, pushed forward his son of 14
or so years to carry the scroll. With tears
in his eyes, the father watched as his
timid son held in his hand the five books
of Moses which were forbidden for so
many years, many of those years before

the Communist revolution.
I understood why it was worth $200.
The exploration into religion in Rus
sia includes all faiths, not just Judaism.
Since 1991, many Russians have bap
tized themselves and their children, not
necessarily because they believe in
Christianity but because the option is
now available. One Russian I met want
ed to pass Russian culture on to her
child, and baptism, she said, is one of the
only positive cultural elements she
knows.
The embracing of religion here is not
limited to the religious aspects alone.
Cultural singing and dancing and reli
gious youth organizations are proliferat
ing around some of the larger cities.
The Anatevkas of Russia, though, are
much the same. I've seen "Fiddler on
the Roof almost 50 times, but it took an
hour-long recitation of my host family's
life in the early 20th century for me to
truly visualize Shalom Alecheim's
descriptions.
Those who survived both the forced

nomadic life of czar ism and tne nara
labor of Stalin returned to the cities dur
ing the de-Stalinization program of
Khrushchev. While religious life was
still forbidden, each Simchat Torah,
Jews would gather outside the Moscow
Synagogue, to celebrate the holiday in
true Russian style. When the govern
ment opened the synagogue in the early
1980s, most Jews still remained outside
the temple, letting the KGB agents
inside "pray" in comfort.
Even this year, hundreds of Jews did
not step foot inside the synagogue dur
ing Simchat Torah, but not because they
weren't allowed. Moscovites could
dance, sing, pray, drink and mingle into
the night, without a curfew, without
worry, without fear. And they did.
