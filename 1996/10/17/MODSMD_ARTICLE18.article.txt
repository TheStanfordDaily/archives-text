## Stanford's power outage stuns Silicon Valley 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
When last week's power outage on campus cut off
Internet service to thousands of people in the Bay
Area, many people were surprised.
The Bay Area Regional Research Network has been
run from Stanford's Korsythe Hidl for the past 10
years It currently serves as the "point of presence" for
th< Bay Area Internet access provider BBN Corp.
Forsythe Hall acts as BBN's Palo Alto "point of
presence" â€” the connection BBN uses to provide In
ternet access for its Silicon Valley customers.
BBN is one of the oldest and top Internet architects
in the country.
The outage affected approximately 400 of BBN's
customers, including Apple, Silicon Graphics, Sun Mi
n>systems, UC-Berkeley and, to a lesser degree,
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.
Created by Stanford in 1986, the research network
was part of a bigger system that provided Internet ac
cess for the campus, research organizations and vari
ous other businesses in the Bay Area, according to
Chip I laven, a network specialist with Stanford's Dis-

tributed Computing and Communication Services.
Due to the growing popularity and usage of the In
ternet, the University sold the network to BBN two
years ago, Haven said.
Despite the spread of the service, the cabling set ac
quired by BBN was left in its original location in
Forsythe Hall.
According to Haven, BBN cabling facilities may be
moved off campus "at some point in the future."
However, with the increasing demand and depen
dence on information technology, moving the plant off
campus may not be a priority for the Massachusetts
based company, Haven said.
BBN Chair and CEO George Conrades apologized
to his customers after the power outage, saying the
company was doing everything possible "to help Stan
ford restore electrical power to BBN's facilities."
Backup batteries providing 40 minutes of power
has been enough to get BBN through minor power dis
ruptions in the past, according Glen Mueller, Stan
ford's chief information officer.
"Now that 1 BBN's] customer base has grown so
large, they cannot afford to have another blackout," he
said.
