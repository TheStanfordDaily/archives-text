U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo joined area doctors at a forum
last night at the School of Medicine to discuss health
care issues in the upcoming election.
"Physicians need to take a stronger role in politics,"
said coordinator Ann Fyfe, director of strategy and net
work development at the Medical Center.
California Medical Association Vice President Steve
Thompson agreed, stressing that physicians have a re
sponsibility to know what is on the hallot. He said meet
ings such as this are particularly important to physi
cians in academic centers because they are somewhat
isolated from the rest of the medical community.
Eshoo, a Democrat representing Stanford and the
surrounding area, discussed Medicare, health mainte
nance organizations and California ballot Propositions
214 and 216.
She said that because Medicare provides health care
to 38 millions Americans and is growing faster than the
economy, "it is a program that is well worth fighting
for."
1 lowever, she strongly disagreed with both proposi
tions. The propositions would regulate the circum
stances under which insurance providers can deny care
and prohibit providers from offering financial incen
tives to doctors to reduce care.
In addition, Prop. 216 would place a tax on the

health care industry to pay for government-provided
health care services.
"I don't support either one of the propositions be
cause, more than anything else, I think it's a loußy way
to create laws," Eshoo said.
Eshoo predicted more HMOs would be created in
the future. She also predicted more mergers such as the
one Stanford Health Services currently is negotiating
with the UC-San Francisco Medical Center.
"The overall missions of both (HMOs and mergers)
are in the same ballpark, to save dollars and still pro
mote public good," she said. "This is the way we pro
mote excellence."
According to Clinical Medical Prof. Charles Feld
man, Stanford could be profoundly affected by any leg
islation dealing with health care.
"Health care legislation will affect the financial base
of the hospital, and the propositions will affect HMOs
in the state," Feldman said.
San Mateo Medical Association President Bill
Tatomer said the legislation affects more than hospital
funding — it affects people.
"When you need health care, what's being done now
is going to affect what you get," he said, adding that stu
dents often don't give much thought to health care.
Tatomer added that as a psychiatrist he has already
seen some negative changes resulting from health care
reform.
