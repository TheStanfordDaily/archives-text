# Debate fails to sway student vote

Presidential hopefuls
Bob Dole and Bill Clin
ton found themselves
competing for voters' at
tention with the Atlanta
Braves and the St. Louis
Cardinals in the Branner
lounge last night.
The National League
Championship Series

and the final debate of the two candidates
for president played on two televisions, side
by side.
But with the Braves taking the lead in

the fifth inning and the presidential choice
of most Stanford voters already decided,
the outcome of both contests seemed
wrapped up.
For freshman Emily Wang, the choice
was not that clear.
Wang intended to watch the debates
with an open mind to make a final choice be
tween Clinton and Bob Dole. But, like many
of her fellow Stanford voters, the debates
did not bring her any closer to making a de
cision
"If you're trying to watch this with an
open mind," said Wang, "it's just like two
people aimlessly firing bullets."
Several other students watching agreed

that there was no clear winner and that the
debates had no impact on their vote.
"It was pretty much a wash," said senior
Matthew Kaufman.
Students also expressed concerns that
neither candidate was able to sway voters
during last night's forum, a town hall meet
ing held at the University of San Diego.
"I think they both did a good job ad
dressing individual questions" from the au
dience, said freshman Jessica Tucker-
Mohl. "But I don't know how relevant some
of the issues are."
Halfwav through the 90-minute debate,

Branner's audience had thinned,
leaving only a handful of political
junkies still watching the candi
dates and a weary voter snoring
on the coach.
Other dorms reflected a similar
lack of interest. In place of the
candidates, the Kimball lounge
featured a movie, while voters in

Arroyo opted to return to the
baseball game.
"No one I've seen here has been
here for more than five minutes at
a time," said Kaufman, who
watched the debates from the
Cedro lounge.
Earlier in the evening, the
Branner crowd, dominated by
Clinton supporters, jeered at
Dole's attacks on the president.
"Dole is definitely on the offen
sive tonight," said freshman
Adam Weiss. "I don't think it's

been very effective. The attacks
only make Dole appear to be a neg
ative, pessimistic candidate."
Despite the increased intensity
of Dole's attacks on Clinton, view
ers praised Dole's improved poise
on national television.
"I had seen Dole before when
he couldn't formulate a sen
tence," said sophomore Sheenie
Ambnrdar. "Now he's making
sentences. I'm impressed he's
having a decent conversation with
the public."
