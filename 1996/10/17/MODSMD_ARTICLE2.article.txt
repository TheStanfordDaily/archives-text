# Debate fails to sway student vote

### Matt Spence 
Presidential hopefuls
Bob Dole and Bill Clin
ton found themselves
competing for voters' at
tention with the Atlanta
Braves and the St. Louis
Cardinals in the Branner
lounge last night.
The National League
Championship Series

and the final debate of the two candidates
for president played on two televisions, side
by side.
But with the Braves taking the lead in

the fifth inning and the presidential choice
of most Stanford voters already decided,
the outcome of both contests seemed
wrapped up.
For freshman Emily Wang, the choice
was not that clear.
Wang intended to watch the debates
with an open mind to make a final choice be
tween Clinton and Bob Dole. But, like many
of her fellow Stanford voters, the debates
did not bring her any closer to making a de
cision
"If you're trying to watch this with an
open mind," said Wang, "it's just like two
people aimlessly firing bullets."
Several other students watching agreed

that there was no clear winner and that the
debates had no impact on their vote.
"It was pretty much a wash," said senior
Matthew Kaufman.
Students also expressed concerns that
neither candidate was able to sway voters
during last night's forum, a town hall meet
ing held at the University of San Diego.
"I think they both did a good job ad
dressing individual questions" from the au
dience, said freshman Jessica Tucker-
Mohl. "But I don't know how relevant some
of the issues are."
