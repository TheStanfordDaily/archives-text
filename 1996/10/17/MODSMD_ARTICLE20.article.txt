## Female phenomenon blazes trails on and off ice 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
You walk into Tresidder
Union a little late and look
around for a phenomenal athlete
who you have never met. You
hear your name called and walk
over to find a girl with blond hair
in a short ponytail and a round,
open face.
Your immediate impression is
of strength — she stands and
holds out her hand, and you no
tice her powerful arms and mus
cular shoulders. Briefly, you pity
the hapless discus and innocent
javelin hurled enormously from
those arms. Then she smiles, and
her evident strength is tempered
by the warmth exuding from her
clear blue eyes. She makes you
feel comfortable. This is Sami Jo
Small.
Small, a junior from Win
nipeg, Manitoba, has been receiv
ing attention since she arrived on
campus. The two-sport star is
not only a javelin and discus
thrower for Stanford's track and
field team but also the goalie for
the Cardinal men's ice hockey
team. The novelty of this posi
tion draws attention to her, at
times more than she would like.
Small certainly has the back
ground to be an ice hockey star.
She started skating at age 2 and
was playing organized hockey by
age 4.
"I had an older brother, and 1
wanted to be just like him; he
went skating, so I got to go too,"
she said.
This was easy to do in her
hometown. "In Winnipeg,
there's a rink on every corner —
an outdoor rink," Small said.
And although the tempera
ture can drop to -20 degrees
Fahrenheit, it doesn't stop the
many passionate hockey lovers.
"Hockey in Canada is really
psycho," Small said. "They really
love hockey up there."
Small proved herself one of

those avid hockey fans, playing
on traveling teams six days a
week, starting at about age 10.
She always played with boys.
"I was lucky because when I
was younger I was one of the big
ger people out there," which
meant the gender question
wasn't really an issue, Small
said.
As the boys caught up,
though, she shifted positions
from forward to goalie, where
she has played ever since. "It's
easier (for girls) to go in net be
cause reflexes aren't gender-spe
cific," she said.
"I like the fact that it's so indi
vidual back there," Small said. "I
really like pressure situations,
and there's a lot of pressure on
the goalie. You also get blamed
for a lot, but that kind of comes
with the territory."
Being the first female ever in
the province of Manitoba to play
the "manly" sport of ice hockey
wasn't always easy. Small had
coaches say to her, "I'm sorry, we
have to cut you because it
wouldn't be convenient to have a
girl on the team" and use the ex
cuse of organizing separate hotel
and locker rooms as justification.
This happened twice and angered
her, but it still didn't stop her.
"Both times I didn't push it,
but both times I also made the
team the next year," Small said.
"It's definitely always in the
back of your head," Small said
"You feel like you're always try
ing to prove something, that you
can't have a bad day or an off day
because they won't say, 'She's
having an off day,' they'll say,
'She's a girl.' "
In countering this attitude,
Small never missed a game and
refused to admit injury. "I was
always out there, always trying
hard," she said.
In high school, a teacher once
told Small that she should be
using her position to help the
cause of feminism.

"I never thought about that,"
Small said. "I just wanted to play
hockey at the highest level I
could "
Small has achieved a very high
level indeed. She was MVP of last
year's Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, which Stanford
won, and her plans for the future
include trying out for the Cana
dian national team in women's
ice hockey, which will debut as an
Olympic sport in 1998.
Ironically, Small has faced
hostility from other women play
ers, who she said resent the fact
that she plays with men.
"They feel like I'm trying to
crack a man's sport and should
be playing women's hockey in
stead," Small said.
Back on home ice, Small has to
deal with fans who single her out
for being the only woman on the
team. At schools with big hockey
teams like Arizona and Califor
nia, Small gets a lot of verbal
abuse. It's not from the other
players — who before the game
just seem curious about what she
can do and then once the game
starts just try to score on her, she
said — but from the fans.
"It's the worst at Berkeley be
cause all the fans know I'm a
girl" and incorporate that fact
into their original and pointed
cheers, Small said. It's at Berke
ley, where the late-night con
tests encourage a party atmos
phere, that Small has had to en
dure "the most unique cheers"
she's ever heard from 2,000
rabid fans.
Small's older brother was at a
game last year, and"he wanted
to beat everyone up," she said. In
a strange twist of fate, her broth
er is now a graduate student at
Cal and plays on the school's
hockey team. The siblings will
meet on the ice for the first time
in November.
"I can't wait." Small said.

As if competing for two Cardinal sports teams (track and field and Ice hockey) Isn't enough, junior Sami
Jo Small happens to be the only female player on Stanford's men's ice hockey team.
What about "the question that's always asked"
— locker rooms? Small usually changes with the
guys.
"I wear shorts and a T-shirt under my uniform,
so it's not a problem," Small said. "But you learn to
get in and out of there pretty quickly," Small said.
The guys on her team are accustomed to it by
now. "It takes the first few weeks for them to get
used to me, but then we reach this comfort level
where it's like having 21 brothers in a room," Small
said.
The funny part comes during tryouts, when un
suspecting players are astonished to find her in
their locker room. "Guys would just sit there for
the longest time, afraid to change," Small said.
And about typical locker room talk, Small said,
"You're really trying hard not to pay attention."
Small, a mechanical engineering major, chose to
come to Stanford on a track scholarship for the ed
ucation the school provides with its athletics. She
was convinced that she was giving up hockey. "But
when I got here and found out that Stanford had a
hockey team," Small said, and her face lit up.
"Hockey's in my blood — I've played for so long
I couldn't imagine stopping," Small said. "It's
something I think I need to do. I'll always keep
playing; even if it's an old-timer's league in Aus
tralia or somewhere, I'll still find a rink on the
weekends."
