# Eight miles?
## Race no easy task 
### 
It's 7:30 a.m. on a Sunday
morning, and your phone is
ringing over and over again.
You know who it is, and you
know why he's calling, and you
wonder if you should just pre
tend you're still sleeping.

You finally decide to pick it up
and face the reality that your
boyfriend is calling long-dis
tance to wake you up so you can
go run in a 10-kilometer race.
Despite the positive thoughts
conjured by your boyfriend's
voice, the "7:30 a.m." and "10K
race" combination is just not ap
pealing to you.
Regardless, you get off the
phone and then slowly haul your
tired, stayed-up-hot-tubbing-all
night- Friday and didn't-stick-to-
EANABS-at-the-football-tail
gaters-Saturday body out of bed
and throw on your running
clothes.
The drive to Stanford Stadi
um, the site of the race, is slow
and painful as you attempt to
fathom how it will feel to embark
on a 6.2-mile run in the next half
hour.
But your arrival to the stadi
um marks the beginning of a
growing enthusiasm. You find
yourself surrounded by other
tired but eager-looking runners
and immediately get caught up
in the adrenaline rush that is in
herent in any race.
On Sunday, this was me as I
prepared to run in the 10K race
at Theta Breakers, an event put
on by Stanford's Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority that more than
800 people registered for. De
spite my initial fatigue, the ener
gy-filled atmosphere was all I
needed to wake up and remem
ber why races are so fulfilling.
In addition to the fact that the
proceeds of the race (more than
$25,000 this year) benefited a
good cause — ('hild Advocates, a
nonprofit organization that
helps abused and neglected chil
dren go though the court system
— races are a great way to add

some excitement and variety to
your typical running schedule.
Which would you rather moti
vate for: running 6 miles by
yourself just because your sched
ule says you're supposed to or
running in a 10K race, commis
erating with the people sur
rounding you as you race the
clock together and push each
other to run a little faster than
you normally run?
Personally, I'd rather run a
10K race any day than go out on
a 6-mile run by myself, even if it
means waking up at 7:30 on a
Sunday morning.
This is why I didn't mind
when the 10K race I started out
running on Sunday turned into a
7.8-mile run. While others were
upset they had to run those extra
1.6 miles, I was glad, preferring
to run almost 8 miles on a race
day instead of having to motivate
myself to run that distance alone
on a normal running day.
The race was well-organized,
and the correct 10K course had
been laid out. In fact, the hard
core runners at the front of the
pack really ran just 10 kilome
ters. It was the group of runners
behind them that, for whatever
reason, took the wrong turn that
added 1.6 miles to the race.
The beginning of the race was
in the stadium, where the run
ners ran around the track twice,
then around the outside of the
stadium once before heading up
toward the heart of campus.
Coming out of the stadium, the
accurate route led the first pack
of sprinters straight up toward
Meyer and Green libraries, then
to the Suites.
However, after leaving the
stadium, my group took a left
turn on Campus Drive instead of
heading to the libraries and
wound around the campus until
reaching the Enchanted Broccoli
Forest and the former Delta Tau
Delta house, at which point we
cut down by I*ake and
then ran out to the Suites.
The junction of Suites and
Campus Drive signified the
halfway mark (3 miles complet
ed) for the runners who stuck to
the course, but was really about
4.7 miles for those oflf-the-beat
en-track trendsetters Imagine
reaching that point after run
ning what was really two-thirds
of the 10K race and hearing
