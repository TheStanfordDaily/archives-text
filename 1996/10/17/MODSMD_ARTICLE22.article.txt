### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
Southwest Missouri State and Santa Clara
will be the next teams to challenge the Stanford
field hockey squad, which is leading the North
ern Pacific Athletic Conference pack with an im
pressive record of 6-1.
The Cardinal squad, currently enjoying eight
straight victories and a 10-1 overall mark, hopes
to continue its winning streak when it plays the
Broncos Saturday at noon and the Bears Sunday
at 2 p.m. Stanford will host both games on Mal
oney Field.
Stanford's focus this weekend will be on
SMSU, a Division I team which defeated the Car
dinal last year in a close 1-0 match.
However, Stanford has defeated one skillful
sqund afler another, and players are confident
that they can hold their own against the Bears.
"We're on a roll," said sophomore midfielder
Jordyn Kramer. "We are doing so well that we
are more focused on playing the East Coast

teams now. But when it comes time to play
(Santa Clara and SMSU], we'll focus on those
teams. I think we'll do well."
According to senior tri-captain Baochi
Nguyen, the Santa Clara match will be "just a
good shooting game" for the Card.
"Southwest is a much better team and should
be more of a challenging game," Nguyen said.
"But if we play as well as we have been, we should
do well against them; we should beat them."
While a victory over club team Santa Clara
will not add to the Card's official winning streak,
the challenging SMSU match will count toward
its overall record.
Stanford created a stir among the prestigious
East Coast teams with its latest triumph over
Providence and is more anxious than ever to put
its skills to the test in the more challenging envi
ronment.
"We are playing very well this year," coach
Sheryl Johnson said. "We are building on each
game, and [the match against the Bears] will be
a good game for us before we go back to the East

next week."
According to Johnson, each Cardinal member
is "working extremely hard and keeping focused
through hard conditioning practices" after two
intense victories last weekend in Berkeley.
"We are feeling the momentum of all the vic
tories," Nguyen said. "Team morale is very high
We're er\joying practices, but they are just as in
tense. As a whole, we're all proud of each other."
The high-aiming squad's three-hour daily
practices consist of drills produced by reviewing
previous games.
Johnson said the team is working on creating
more shooting opportunities in preparation for
the upcoming contests.
"We are working on cross-play to set up more
scoring options inside the shooting 'nrcle," John
son said. The team wants to "broaden our shoot
ing angle and increase our chances of scoring "
"Every game we play is important," Kramer
said. "But we are looking toward playing teams
like James Madison and American on our (East
Coast] trip."
