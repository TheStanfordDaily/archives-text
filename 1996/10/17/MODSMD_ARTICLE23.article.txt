### Jennifer Splansky 
Two 45-minute halves. Two 15-minute over
times. Two teams exhausted, neither one able to con
vert for a winning goal After two overtimes, the
Stanford men's soccer team managed to hold on for
a 1-1 tie against the San Francisco Dons.
In his first game in four weeks, junior Shan Gaw
scored the only goal for the Cardinal on a direct kick
from 30 yards out. Gaw returned to the lineup after
being sidelined for four weeks with a torn medial col
lateral ligament. The direct kick was rewarded to
Stanford after a holding call against the Dons. Gaw
took advantage of the opportunity and shot a bullet
just out of reach of Zack Vaughn, USF's freshman
goalie. Vaughn is averaging a .5 goals-against aver
age this season.
The Dons responded and tied the score with 5
minutes left. The USF ofTense broke through the
Stanford defense and Cardinal sophomore goalie
Grant Brown made a beautiful save, tipping a shot
just over the goal. With the following corner kick, the
IV>ns centered the ball and, through traffic, fresh
man Thomas Hovenic put the ball in the goal
Stanford's best scoring opportunities came dur
ing the first half, but the Card was unable to convert
any of them into a goal On an impressive slide tack
le, sophomore Aaron Jones stole the ball from the
Dons and passed to sophomore A.J Sauer Sauer
took a shot on goal which deflected back to Cardinal
senior Steve Kirschbaum Kirschbaum was able to
create a shot, but it sailed just wide of the goal
The Cardinal played phenomenal defense
throughout the entire game. Seniors Brad Davies
and Jon Manchester and junior Daniel Wytock came
up with big defensive plays time after time In the
first overtime period, a Don forward beat Brown and
took a shot on what appeared to be an open goal
Wytock made a defensive save and cleared the ball,
preventing a goal
During the first overtime period. Brown made a
huge save, preventing the Dons from taking the
lead. USF forward Shane Watkins broke away from
the field and took on Brown one on one. Brown came
