goulash of a city out of space and time,
swirling in karaoke bars, massage parlors,
expatriate business tycoons and pink
Rolls-Royces. Joe, a Chinese American
and former Peace Corps volunteer is
thrown by his law firm into his ancestral
homeland. He falls in love with an entre
preneurial hottie, copes with moral crises
and attempts to achieve a sense of self in
a senseless city. "Memories" are served

2 p.m. Sunday at the Noh Space in San
Francisco, $13-$l5 a pop. Call 621-7978

tions melt away until the shattering climax
shakes us all. Or so promises the press re
lease. The play shows from Wednesday

into the sleaze and jazz of dissolute 1929
Germany. The story centers on a young
