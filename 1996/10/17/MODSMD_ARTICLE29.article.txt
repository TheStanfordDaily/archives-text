## The 						House on the Hill Adventures of an art history major in the fairy world of Runnymede 
### Elisabeth Morse 
Have you ever been driving and passed something that looks really neat
but not bothered to stop and look because life is short and stuff off the
highway is never really that cool when you get too close to it?
Well, for years and years while driving on Interstate 280 through the
Woodside area just north of campus, I passed what looked like a large
house with various sculptures spotting its land. Three years ago, 1 finally
asked the late Art History Prof. Albert Elsen what this intriguing place
was. The answer was Runnymede, a private sculpture collection displayed
on 120 acres of land. Elsen talked about the eccentric collecting habits of
the owners — they buy art for their own pleasure, not its resale value —
and mentioned that Runnymede is almost never open to the public. He
also said something about a fire engine used for tours of the (arm. (This
turns out not to be a myth; I saw the fabled fire truck.)
Once 1 knew that Runnymede had not just two or three sculptures but
around 160,1 tried to drive close to the property early one morning to see
what I could see through the fence, but the view was pretty similar to that
from 280 and the fence was tichtlv locked.

Runnymede is not about stuffy art
that no one understands. It's about
interacting with sculpture, about
taking a beautiful walk in a beautiful
setting, about relaxing and feasting
one's eyes on the contrast between
man-made and natural beauty.

Thus, a thrilling shiver ran through my spine when I read that the San
Jose Museum of Art would be holding a "Harvest Picnic" at Runnymede.
Finally, I thought, a concrete opportunity presents itself to see this myste
rious place; good things come to those who wait and watch. Unfortunate
ly, the official event is going to run you $90 ($75 for members of the San
lose Museum of Art). But after a preview of the place (someone had to do
it), 1 must say that your Bookstore rebates will be well spent.
Runnymede was formed by John and Podie Rosenkrans in 1985 after
they visited Storm King Art Center, the country's most famed sculpture
park, in upstate New York. Even though one can feel the influence of the
art market at-large at Runnymede through the display of works by
renowned artists such as Mark di Suvero, Sol Le Witt and Robert Arneson,
the sculptures as a group are more a reflection of the tastes ot the individ
uals who purchased them.
Walking around Runnymede is entirely different from a museum ex
perience. It's a chance to see sculptures among hills and trees, to see Viola
Frey's "Metal Man" and "Questioning Woman" emerge from the bushes
like Adam and Eve in Eden. Interspersed with images of large yellow light
ning bolts shooting out from the forest (Charles Ginnever's "Zeus II") arc
views from the tops of hills of the bay and even of Hoover Tower.
Runnymede is not about stuffy art that no one understands. It's about
interacting with sculpture, about taking a beautiful walk in a beautiful set
ting, about relaxing and feasting one's eyes on the contrast between man
made and natural beauty. Visiting Runnymede is a rare and enriching ex
perience; even if your bank account can't afford it, it's still worth waving
hi to it as you breeze along the freeway.

"Harvest Picnic," a fund-raiser held at Runnymede Sculpture Farm in Run
nymede Road at Woodside, will take place on Saturday from noon to 5 p.m.
Tickets cost $90 for general admission, $75 for members. Admission includes
a catered lunch, live jazz and a silent auction. Proceeds go to support the mu
seum's education programs. For reservations, call Linda Larkin, director of
membership at the San Jose Museum of Art, at (408) 271-6840.
