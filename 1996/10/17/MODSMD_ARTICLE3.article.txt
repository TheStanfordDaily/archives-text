University President Gerhard Casper's
total compensation for the 1994-95 fiscal
year reached $527,533, making him the
fourth-highest paid university president in

the country.
Casper's compensation
that year included his
salary of $330,750 and his
benefits, which totaled
$196,783. Benefits include
all payments not covered by
base compensation, such as
matching retirement and
social security contribu
tions and insurance premi
ums.

The figures were compiled by The
Chronicle of Higher Education, which ex
amined data from federal tax returns filed
by 479 of the nation's colleges and universi
ties. The survey examined data from 1994-
95, the most recent year available.
Casper was paid a one-time payment of
$156,643 to cove- relocation costs. Stanford
reimbursed him for capital-gains taxes in
curred when he became Stanford's presi
dent and sold his home in Chicago to move
into Hoover House, which is owned by the
University. A person who sells a home but
buys anot her one within two years is not re
quired to pay capital-gains taxes.
"The board's trustees required the pres
ident to live in Hoover House," said Univer
sity Communications Director Terry Shep

ard, explaining that the board's compensa
tion committee didn't feel it was appropri
ate to hold Casper liable for taxes associat
ed with their decision.
"His compensation is pretty far down the
list if that is taken out," Shepard said.
