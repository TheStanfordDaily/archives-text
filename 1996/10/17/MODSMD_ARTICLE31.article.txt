The term "rock opera"
seems like an oxy
moron.
Imagine rock music sung in Ital
ian, or 300-pound divas diving into
the rrrash pit. Imagine the pay-per
view event of the year: The three
tenors sing The Doors.
Opera is traditionally associat
ed with the elite and rock with pop
culture and the masses. Mixing
rock with opera, you might say, is
equivalentto mixing oil with water.
That didn't stop The Who's Pete
Townshend, however, from com
ing up with the first rock opera. His
original concept led to the Broad
way musical "The Who's Tommy,"
which is coming to campus this
weekend courtesy of Stanford
Lively Arts.
The conception of "Tommy"
was simply The Who's experimen
tation with tying together four
songs at the end of their second
album, "The Kids are Alright."
Some critics felt "Tommy" was a
joke; others immediately hailed it
as a ground-breaking feat in
tended to close the
gap between art
and mass

culture.
"It's definitely important to
know the background behind it,"
said Davis Kirby, who plays the
leading role. "I think it's important
for people to understand the
power of what The Who's Tommy'
represents.
"It was the first rock opera; it
was the first to actually show that
this rock music isn't exactly just a
bunch of people slamming guitars
around. You're actually creating
music."
Slamming guitars around was
literally an integral part of The
Who's appeal in the 1960s — the
group often ended their concerts
by smashing their instruments. In
fact, The Who is playing
"Quadrophenia," a second rock
opera,inSan Francisco this week
end, another sign of the group's
longevity.
The journey of "Tommy" to
Broadway is a rags-to-riches
story, with plenty of misbegotten
offspring along the way.
When the double album came
out in 1969, it helped propel The
Who, already famous in the United
Kingdom, to stardom in America.
Over the years "Tommy" has seen
many incarnations, from a
London
Sym-

phony Orchestra recording, to a
ballet, to a 1975 film version by
bizarre auteur Ken Russell.
But when the first staged pro
duction of "Tommy" appeared in
1979, it flopped. Townshend and
writer Des McAnuff revamped the
book, and in 1993, Broadway
staged it to immediate success.
Classical opera aficionados do
not turn up their noses at the idea
of rock opera, as one might ex
pect. Stanford Prof. Herbert Lin
denberger, the author of books on
the aesthetics and cultural theo
ries of opera, is one such opera
enthusiast.
"Opera has to renew itself —
every art form has to renew itself
all the time — so using something
like rock is absolutely appropri
ate," he said.
Lindenberger cited the incor
poration of jazz in opera in the
1920s as a radical innovation in the
history of the art form. He whimsi
cally proposed that the composer
Rossini was as guilty of damaging
19th-century eardrums as rock
concerts do to eardrums today.
"People had never
heard such loud

sounds in a theater as I'm sure
they heard in parts of Rossini.
Think of what Wagner and Strauss
did later in the 19th century to the
orchestra," he said. "Everything
got louder and bigger and more
powerful."
The use of the term "rock
opera," however, immediately
lends a sense of legitimacy to the
use of rock as an art form.
"It is really the composer who
decides if you call this an opera
and if you want your audience to
go into it with the attitude that this
is attempting a serious renewal of
opera as a form," said Linden
berger. "If a composer decides
he's writing an opera, and he
wants his audience to think in
terms of opera, he's making a
statement"
Does rock opera even have a
role in the future direction of
opera?
"I think [opera] is going in the
direction of seeing what can be
done with different instruments,
seeing what can be done with am
plification, see
ing what

can be done with different kinds of
voices," said Lindenberger.
Kirby agreed that the kind of singing
in "Tommy" is quite different than your
usual musical.
"You have to rock out with these
voices," he said. "You can't really have
a legit soprano singing this stuff; you
have to belt it."
Broadway musicals have a history
of dabbling in rock, such as "Jesus
Christ Superstar," and more recently,
"Rent." "Rent" could be considered
the literal fusion of rock and opera, a
rendition of Puccini's "La Boheme" for
the '90s where Rodolfo is a struggling
musician and Mimi is HIV-positive.
"I've seen 'Rent' and I truly enjoyed
it," Kirby said. "I think 'Rent' gets a lot of
attention because of a lot of the topics
that it covers. (It's] something so totally
new to theater, with an irreverence for
the theatrical idea. I think that's what
we're doing as well. It's important to us
that we tell the story of Tommy as well
as work on being honest with the
music."
"Tommy's" music apparently does
hold up to normal rock standards.

"We've had several people say, 'You
know what, we could just listen to your
band all night long/ " Kirby said of the
seven-member "Tommy" band, which
is actually on stage during the show.
The repertoire includes songs such as
"See Me, Feel Me," "The Acid Queen"
and "We're Not Gonna Take It." The
songs may be familiar to audiences
who aren't well-versed in The Who's
music but have heard them on the
radio.
The story of "Tommy" may also be
familiar: Tommy witnesses the murder
of his mother's lover by his real father,
who has just returned from a World
War II POW camp. He becomes blind,
deaf and dumb from the traumatic ex
perience.
Essentially cut off from the world,
Tommy finds self-expression through
playing pinball. Even after his talent en
ables him to break through his barrier
of silence, the public hails him as their
messiah and wants to become just like
him. All Tommy wants, though, is to feel
normal.
The intensity of the music in
"Tommy" brings out new dimensions in
the performers. Kirby, whose credits
include "Gypsy" and "Guys and Dolls,"
said that he had never worked on a
"pure" opera before.
"Quite honestly, it's
some of the hardest
music I've ever

had to work with," he said. "Everything
in the whole show is sung except for
maybe one or two lines here or there.
You've got to remember that you're in a
rock concert as well as performing the
ater and telling a story, so it's a very thin
line you have to run."
A second way in which "Tommy" re
sembles a rock concert is in the visual
effects. Under the direction of Victoria
Bussert, "Tommy" promises a multime
dia extravaganza with slides, projec
tors, intense choreography and the
requisite flashing lights.
The initial setting is the war-torn
London of the 19405, and the visuals
evoke the horror of air raids. Twenty
years later, the visuals are 1960s psy
chedelic, with the main theme of the ar
cade. The sets are also designed to
take the audience into the pinball ma
chine and inside Tommy's mind. Memo
rial Auditorium will never have experi
enced such a bombardment of the
senses, not even at late-night Flicks.
Will Stanford students appreciate
the innovation of the rock opera, espe
cially one done by a group whose
music was popular in the 19705?
"I think this show itself actually
speaks to the university crowd," said
Kirby. "I think they will
truly appreciate

{Tommy'] because it has messages
that are eternal."
"Everyone wants to be seen and
heard and felt, and that's really what
Tommy is crying out for. One of the
basic themes in the show is just to be
honest to yourself. One of the lines in
the show is 'be what you'll be,' and
that's talking about not changing what
you are to fit someone else's needs."
Thirty years ago, The Who came out
with their first album in America, titled
"My Generation." Through the success
of "Tommy," as an album and a Broad
way musical, this still is their genera
tion.
