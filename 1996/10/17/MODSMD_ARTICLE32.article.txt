"First Band On The Moon"

"Operation Heavenly"

As John Lennon once rhetorically asked, why can't
one fill the world with silly love songs? We normally
praise / blame the Beatles for the oft-maligned genre of
pop music, breezy ear candy that Americans could ap
preciate but could never quite get the hang of. Let's face
it, we here in the States generally prefer the cathartic,
sex-soaked rush of good old-fashioned rock V roll in
stead of the fey, giddy jangle of pop. Across the pond,
however, the Beatles' pop legacy lives on in new releases
by European bands The Cardigans and Heavenly.
The Cardigans are a quintet from Sweden, so they
naturally find themselves working within in the long
shadow cast by Sweden's last (in) famous musical export,
ABBA. Indeed, the Cardigans tip their hats to their fore
bearers, but not to the point of blatant imitation, on
their second U.S. album "First Band On The Moon."
Principal songwriter Peter Svensson frequently incor
porates familiar disco rhythms into his lush melodic or
chestrations, but in place of ABBA's vocal harmonies, the
Cardigans have Nina Persson's singularly lovely coo.
"First Band On The Moon" is at once languid and boun
cy, with Nina sounding self-assured and confident

whether she's breaking hearts ("Been It") or getting her
own heart broken ("Lovefool"). And you won't believe
your ears when you hear the Cardigans reducing Black
Sabbath's rawk classic "Iron Man" to a lazy, psychedelic,
navel -i n spec tingst u po r.
In contrast to the Cardigans' polished, kitschy pop,
Heavenly's roots are planted firmly in scruffy, jangly
Brit-pop. A group of post-graduate Oxford students,
Heavenly has earned a sizable underground following in
the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest
indie-pop scene. Olympia, Washington-based K
Records released Heavenly's latest album, "Operation
Heavenly," which finds the band moving towards a
rawer, more punk-pop sound.
Amelia Fletcher and Cathy Rogers still wrap their beauti
ful harmonies around subversively bitter lyrics; the jaunty
swoon of "Ben Sherman" and the jumpy riot-for-fun of"K-
Klass Kisschase" show that Heavenly still has a distinctly
British kick to their sound.
However, more than a few songs on "Operation Heaven
ly" are reduced to a rather bland fuzz-guitar rush. It sounds
suspiciously like what Lush, another girlie Brit-pop band, did
with their modern-rock hit "Ladykillers;" when the dream
pop lad of the early '90s went bust, they simply cranked up the
distortion and tried to rock out. I don't mean to say that Heav
enly is doing the same thing, though; "Operation Heavenly"
is a pretty decent album, regardless of how much I miss the
jangle and bounce of Heavenly's earlier material.
