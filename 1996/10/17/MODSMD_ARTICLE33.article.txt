# MANOWAR "LOUDER THAN HELL
## 
### 
Back in the '80s, when alternative music
was still alternative and punk was the
province of angry 14-year-old misfits, heavy
metal ruled the seas of rock music. The pants
were tight, the hair was big, and every guitar
player in America practiced noodly arpeg
gios in hopes of someday attaining the
heights ruled by Skid Row and the like. That
all changed when Nirvana tore into the
mainstream.
Now, five years later, the bands that didn't
cut their hair in a desperate attempt to jump
onto the alternative bandwagon have disinte
grated entirely. Metalheads, abandoned by
their idols, have retreated in disarray, finding
solace in suburban pool halls or out-of-the
way bars where Judas Priest is still on the
jukebox. The faithful are scattered: heavy
metal, rest in peace.
Or at least that's what I thought before I
came across this album. "Louder Than Hell"
is proof that metal's magic lives on, at least
for some people. Manowar make metal the
old-fashioned way, right down to their tight
leather codpieces. Five-minute guitar solos.
Chanted backup vocals a la "Balls To The
Wall." A singer who uses more octaves than
Mariah Carey. Power ballads with pianos and
strings.
Song titles like "Brothers of Metal Pt. I"
and"The Cods Made Heavy Metal" give an
idea of the way this band thinks of itself, as

big-haired warriors defending a sacred trust
against all odds: "Our hearts are filled with
Metal and masters we have none / And we
will die for Metal, Metal heals, my son."
Manowar means it too — this is no joke. This
is Conan the Barbarian metal, music to play
Dungeons and Dragons by. This is Spinal Tap
if Spinal Tap weren't kidding. This is insane.
Yet somehow this album works. Perhaps
it's a testimony to alternative's complete
dominance of our listening tastes, but
"Louder Than Hell" s in-your-face flaunting
of heavy metal's most absurd and flagrant
cliches is like a refreshing blast of fresh air.
You have to respect the courage — or the in
sanity — of a band that can cling unrepen
tantly to a nearly dead genre with such pride
and dedication.
Swallow your '90s cynicism and sense of
irony for just a few minutes, and give
Manowar a try. By the time they exhort you
to "Crack the walls and shake the
ground / fight tonight for Metal one and all,"
you'll be tempted to join the battle.
