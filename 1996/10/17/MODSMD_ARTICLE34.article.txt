# CATHERINE WHEEL "LIKE CATS AND DOGS"
## 
### 
If a group like the Catherine Wheel pro
duces alternative rock, then a contradiction
exists. Because alternative music was a vio
lent reaction to the musical hangover known

as the late '80s (Michael Bolton, Vanilla Ice,
Paula Abdul, etc.), it has often been described
as the second (or third) coming of punk,
which was a violent response to the preten
tious art rock of the middle '70s (Yes, Rush,
the Moody Blues, etc.).
The musical term "alternative" has now
become as ambiguous as the term "rock and
roll" itself, to the point where a number of
"alternative" bands have made productive ca
reers out of making subtly disguised art rock.
(Ask any punk fan what he or she thinks of an
album titled "Melon Collie and the Infinite
Sadness.") Simple angst somehow became an
excuse for pretentiousness.
The Catherine Wheel's latest album, "Like
Cats And Dogs," is an excellent example of
the problems with an overly generous defini
tion of the term "alternative." The band
makes art rock in the same vein as the Smash
ing Pumpkins, meaning mammoth guitar
feedback, plodding "dramatic" rhythms and
swirling vocals.
Often, the results can he quite compelling, as
on the track "Girl Stand Still," which controls a
powerful guitar line for four minutes before un
leashing it as a deluge of rage and beauty.
I lowever, the album suffers overall from a
shimmering atmosphere devoid of potent
hooks to snag the listener. Truthfully, the
problem might be that the album is a collec
tion, described by the group's manager,
Merck Mercuriadis, as "our album of non

album songs." Composed of extra tracks
recorded for the group's singles, the work
lacks direction and focus, producing few
memorable moments.
Indeed, the album's most remarkable
track is a gorgeous and deliciously grandiose
reading of Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were
Here." Still, this tribute to art rock's patron
saints is followed by two "original" composi
tions, "Mouthful Of Air" and "Car," which
are little more than shoddy rewrites of the
preceding masterpiece.
Thus, "Like Cats And Dogs" is an album
which suffers from one of the traditional
weaknesses of art rock. Successful musical
ideas are beaten into submission until songs
are either unlistenable or indistinguishable.
Either way, it's not worth anyone's time.
