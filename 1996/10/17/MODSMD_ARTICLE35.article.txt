## DAVID SANCHEZ "STREET SCENES" 
### 
First, your eyebrow start twitching. Your
toes then begin to wiggle, followed by the in
evitable tapping of your feet. Soon, your
shoulders and hips join the compelling
rhythm. Before you know it, your whole body
moves and swings to David Sanchez's catchy,
upbeat jazz music. In his third album, "Street
Scenes," Sanchez's talent and varied style are

illustrated via the tenor saxophone against
the strong backdrop of percussion.
Infused with a jolt of Latin American and
African rhythms, Sanchez s musical pieces are
unique and unpredictable in their freshness
and innovative energy. His style seems com
plicated, but the beautiful and invigorating
music that results is relaxing in its simplicity.
One minute, Sanchez has your heartbeat
pounding along with the ferocious "thump,
thump" of the drums in "Four In One" and
the next, he eases into a slow and sensuous
ballad, "Carmina," using soprano sax.
This pronounced variation in style is the
result of his mentor, Dizzy Gillespie, who
"was always getting into other cultures, and
adding those influences to his music,"
Sanchez has explained. "That's why I'm al
ways searching for things I can bring into my
music, to avoid repeating myself."
Since his first exposure to music was
through drums, Sanchez still demonstrates a
deep connection with percussion instru
ments, although he ended up playing sax be
cause he was "attracted by its sound." Influ
enced by jazz greats such as Miles Davis and
Eddie Palmieri, Sanchez exudes a sense of
spirituality in his sound that is a recipe of
one-fourth world beat, one-fourth R & Band
one-half jazz.
It is Sanchez's inventive style and variety
that make his music so appealing. His ratio
nale for this unorthodox sound: "In a multi
cultural society like New York City (where
Sanchez grew up), when you go into certain
neighborhoods, each has a certain kind of
flavor. We all come out of a particular com
munity, and when you throw it all together,
you come up with some exciting new combi
nations. That's the vibe of' Street Scenes.' "
Sanchez's music is a sound that permeates
all boundaries of race and invokes in us an
understanding of what it is to be human.
Wow! I did learn something from CIV
after all.
