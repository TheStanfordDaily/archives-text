# DESCENDENTS "EVERYTHING SUCKS"
## 
### 
Even though they broke up at right about
the time I lirst heard them, the Descendents
were the first punk band I ever got into, and
even today their old albums still have a spe
cial place in my heart. Songs like "Hope' were
anthems for the young and weird, perfectK
encapsulating the rage and angst of my ado
lescence.
Anchored by Milo Aukerman's aggro
nerd vocals, Descendents music at its best
was edgy but earnest, simultaneous!) selfish
