# DESCENDENTS "EVERYTHING SUCKS"
## 
### 
Even though they broke up at right about
the time I lirst heard them, the Descendents
were the first punk band I ever got into, and
even today their old albums still have a spe
cial place in my heart. Songs like "Hope' were
anthems for the young and weird, perfectK
encapsulating the rage and angst of my ado
lescence.
Anchored by Milo Aukerman's aggro
nerd vocals, Descendents music at its best
was edgy but earnest, simultaneous!) selfish

and self-deprecating, dorky but a little scary.
Blending SoCal punk with surf and rock, the
Descendents were the roots of the pop-punk
sound that would eventually make Green Pay
famous. Then Milo went to graduate school,
the rest of the hand metamorphosed into an
utterly ordinary band called All, and the De
scendents were gone.
Or at least they were until this month.
Now, perhaps catalyzed by All's tailed major
label debut and Milo's failure to translate his
degree into a paying job, the Descendents are
back. "Everything Sucks" debuted in the Hill
board 200. There are plans for an MTV video
and a major international tour. Looks like my
favorite band may finally get the success it .il
ways deserved. So why am I not celebrating?
This is a pretty good album, all things con
sidered. It sure tops most of the so-called
"punk" stuff out there. A few tracks, like
"Coffee Mug," "Doghouse" or the Milo-au
thored "We" and "This Place," still have the
old magic and energy. Milo's songs are by far
the best ones; he almost succeeds in docu
menting adult angst as artfully as he once
pinpointed adolescence.
Too often, however, "Everything Sucks"
sacrifices rage and energy in favor of middle
of-the road pop songs. Pure pop was always
part of the Descendents' repertoire, but this is
different: Easy cliche is substituted for lyrical
earnestness or wit, dumbed-down power
chords for interesting music.
Obviously, my standards for Descendents
music are pretty high. So maybe it's no sur
prise that this album disappointed me a little.
This is a decent album, no question. But even

if it weren't, I'd have a tough time conceding
that the band that helped me survive 10th
grade is now just a bunch of jaded old men
producing half-assed music in an attempt to
cash in on their legacy.
