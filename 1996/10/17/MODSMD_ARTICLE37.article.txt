BOOK REVIEW

beautiful but refreshingly unconcerned with
her beauty — all of which merely makes her
more fetching and more a source of intrigue.
The problem with this kind of character, at
least as manifested by Lily Dahl, is that she's
not very believable. The entire novel, there
fore, rests on a shaky foundation and, despite
its strengths, falls far short of its potential.
In tiny Webster, Minn., Lily rents a room
above the Ideal Cafe, where, like other
spunky, sassy heroines from literature,
movies and TV, she's employed as a waitress.

Raised in Webster, 19-year-old Lily has re
cently returned alone from Florida, where
she moved for two years with her parents be
cause her father had cancer.
Lily is playing Hermia in a local produc
tion of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," fan
tasizing about becoming a professional ac
tress and pondering the life of Marilyn Mon
roe. Engaged to a plodding and devoted po
lice officer her own age, she privately spies
on Edward Shapiro, a painter in his early 30s
who is staying in the seedy hotel across the
street.
Edward suffers from a combination of the
two maladies that plague almost all the char
acters — either they're familiar, mostly in a
cartoonishly hick way, or they're not fully
developed and their behavior and actions
seem arbitrary rather than organic. I be
lieved they did the things they did because
Hustvedt told me so, not because the ges

tures seemed like natural outgrowths of the
characters' personalities. Edward is both
stereotypical — the sensual artist visiting
from exotic New York City — and incom
prehensible.
Lily and Edward have sex about 15 min
utes after formally introducing themselves,
yet Hustvedt portrays their relationship as
one of meaningful and sincere love. At times,
especially early on, I found this portrayal so
hard to swallow I wondered if Hustvedt were
being facetious.
At their first meeting, Edward offers Lily
wine and says, "1 think we should drink to
Division Street (the street on which he and
Lily live) at night, to its silence and its music,
to its darkness and its light." The toast, which
seemed embarrassingly cheesy to me, ap
pears to be intended to reinforce an image of
Edward as deep and sensitive.
Of the cartoonishly hick characters, most
are tolerable and some are even interesting
and appealing, but all feel cliched: Lily's boss
at the diner, whose gruffness conceals a heart
of gold; Bert, another sassy, gum-chewing
waitress and l ily's ally; Dolores, the town
slut; and an array of other Webster natives
who gossip about each other and utter folksy
truisms like, "You're askin' me if that boy
could do somethin' bad. I'm tellin' you, you
bet he could, but that don't make him much
different from nobody else."
The various characters have the opportu
nity to reveal themselves via a somewhat con
voluted plot involving a former classmate of
L.ily's who is obsessed with her and ultimate
ly commits an act of violence stemming from
his obsession. Despite this act, the book
doesn't have a real climax, and the mystery
which ostensibly has been driving the book is
never solved satisfactorily.
Even with many weaknesses, however,
"Lily Dahl" has redeeming qualities. Ironical
ly, part of my frustration with this novel
came, from my deep admiration for
Hustvedt's previous novel, "The Blindfold."
In"The Blindfold," Hustvedt chronicles the
breakdown and recovery of Iris, a graduate
student in New York City. Hustvedt's writing
style in"The Blindfold," as in "Lily Dahl," is
so unadorned as to be almost clinical. This
refusal to be flowery, coupled with Hustvedt's
uncanny powers of observation, results in a
uniquely direct and affecting narrative voice.
The biggest difference between "The
Blindfold" and "Lily Dahl" is that "The
Blindfold" offers Hustvedt the opportunity
to write about people whose intelligence is as
sophisticated as her own clearly is, and "Lily
Dahl" does not. The vaguely inauthentic way
the citizens of Webster come off is perhaps
nothing more than my own sense that
Hustvedt is writing about them from a dis
tance.
At times in "Lily Dahl," Hustvedt's aston
ishing control over language does create a
feeling of immediacy, especially when she is
evoking a specific scene: "What remained of
a brown carpet had buckled away from the

walls, and a smell that reminded her of the
high school cafeteria filled the air — the smell
of pallid green beans and mashed potatoes on
a tan plastic tray."
Or, "Her eyes felt sore, and the steadily
darkening sky caused a turbid gloom over the
trees and water, muting their colors to grays
and browns. Somewhere above her on the
other side of the creek, she heard children
playing, and I.ily wondered why children al
ways sound the same when they play, that it
didn't seem to matter who they were or where
they lived."
Unfortunately, for every succinct and on
target description, there are even more in
stances of awkwardness in Hustvedt's writ
ing: times when a tension she creates never
develops into anything, or, more commonly,
times when she simply summarizes in a place
where showing the evolution of a situation
would be much more persuasive.
For example: "Until then, Hermia's verse
has been as remote to Lily as a song in anoth
er language she could memorize but not un
derstand. But that afternoon, she discovered
that by watching Mabel closely, by adopting
her tone and posture, she felt more when she
spoke the lines."
The character of Mabel, Lily's elderly next
door neighbor, is especially problematic. A
former professor working on her memoirs,
Mabel is Lily's closest friend, as well as, infor
mally, her acting coach. At one time,
Hustvedt hints that Mabel is a lesbian, and
another time, she hints that Mabel is a surro
gate mother to Lily — a suggestion which
comes so late it feels like an afterthought, es
pecially because Lily's own mother is hardly
mentioned in either a positive or negative
way.
By the end of the novel, after Lily has been
injured, Mabel and Lily take to sharing a bed:
"At first Lily had held herself tightly against
the edge of the bed, conscious even in her
sleep of the old woman's body, but that
awareness disappeared, and often they would
wake up entangled in each other — an arm or
a leg thrown over the other — and after the
first few times, they didn't bother with apolo
gies."
As a former 19-year-old girl myself, 1 sim
ply don't buy this description. All through
high school, I volunteered at a nursing home,
and even with the residents I was most fond
of, 1 cannot imagine any circumstances
under which I could have been talked into
hopping in bed with them, let alone allowing
our limbs to become "entangled."
Generally, I questioned Lily's willingness
to spend the majority of her time with men
and women not even close to her own age,
and I also questioned the intense interest
with which those men and women regard
Lily. It's easy to believe that Lily is fascinating
to herself, and Hustvedt skillfully, even
touchingly, depicts Lily's very normal self
absorption. But her beauty aside, it's hard to
believe that Lily is fascinating to other peo
ple.

Hustvedt's sophomore effort is slightly less than enchanting.
