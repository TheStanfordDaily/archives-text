# Remembering What Never Happened:
## Hustvedt on Language, Dreams and Autobiography 
### Curtis Sittenfeld 
Siri Hustvedt believes that her readers are
"people who are attracted to fiction where
everything isn't articulated. We live in a culture
where everything is overly explicated. 1 don't
do that because I'm interested in ambiguity."
Having just returned home to Brooklyn,
N.Y., after a three-week promotional tour for
her new novel "The Enchantment of Lily
Dahl," Hustvedt has encountered her ambigu
ity loving readers in cities ranging from
Nashville to Milwaukee to Seattle. "I met very
serious and passionate readers, people who
have really thought about what the book was.
Sometimes people ask questions 1 have to real
ly think about. It gives the problems of the
book a new context, and that's a pleasure."
On the down side, the endless hotel rooms
of her promotional tour made her feel a bit like
Willy Loman, Hustvedt said. "I was all over the
place. You get a little disoriented. Being in a
new place every day is a very strange thing to
do, almost like an out-of-body experience."
In part, Hustvedt said, this strangeness re
sulted from the dichotomy between the indi
vidual, personal act of writing and the com
munal act of giving a reading. "Writing a book

is solitary. Turning it into something more
public is a little foreign."
Of course, judging from her fiction, feel
ings of disorientation seem like something to
which Hustvedt is highly attuned. Both "l ily
Dahl," as well as Hustvedt's first novel, "The
Blindfold'' are crowded with people for whom
the world is rarely a safe or logical place. In
rural Webster, Minn., the setting of "Lily
Dahl," a variety of disoriented characters seek
to make sense of what I lustvedt calls "the ulti
mate questions."
The plot of "Lily Dahl,' while technically a
mystery, is in fact more of a backdrop against
which characters can pursue these questions,
Hustvedt said. "The form of suspense is a way
of talking about essential mysteries that are
not about suspense. The book is a lot about
fictional depictions of realityâ€” the paintings
Ed does, and the private and more mad art of
Martin, and Lily, who's an actress, transform
ing herself."
Other "fictional depictions of reality"
which influenced "Lily Dahl" are dreams and
language, Hustvedt said. In "Lily I)ahl," as well
as in"The Blindfold," characters are obsessed
with language, an obsession Hustvedt said she
can understand, although she does not share

it. "I'm not crazy. I think language is arbitrary.
[But) I think language cuts the world up, and
that diffuse reality can't be conquered. You're
always away from it."
The influence of dreams on her novel takes
several shapes, Hustvedt said, including Lily's
participation in a performance of "A Midsum
mer Night's Dream," a play whose selection
was "deliberate," according to Hustvedt. Addi
tionally, Lily has a dream about finding a girl
lying on the floor which Hustvedt said she
borrowed from her own life.
Lily's dream is not the only element in the
novel which has autobiographical overtones
for Hustvedt. The town of Webster is a fiction
alized version of Northtield, Minn., the place in
which Hustvedt was raised and attended col
lege before moving to New York, where she ob
tained a doctorate in English literature from
Columbia University and married the novelist
Paul Auster, with whom she has a daughter.
The Ideal Cafe in Webster, where I.ilv works,
does actually exist, and while Hustvedt was not
a waitress there, two of her sisters and her high
school best friend all were.
Reactions to the novel have been positive in
Northfield, Hustvedt said. "It appears that I'm
somewhat of a celebrity in my own little town.

People seem to be verv proud of me. No one
has been insulted."
Hustvedt said her next novel, which she has
just begun "making notes for," takes place in
New York City and has a man as its protago
nist. However, she acknowledged that pieces
of her own life will probably find their way
into the novel, albeit in a changed form.
"Writing fiction is like remembering what
never happened," she explained. "It's an act of
bringing out that's very similar to memory'
