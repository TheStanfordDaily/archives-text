# SLEEPER "THE IT GIRL"
## 
### 
About one month ago, I witnessed the
most impressive rock concert of my admit
tedly young life. The artist was Elvis Costello,
and the event was Seattle's Bumbershoot Arts
Festival.
A relatively unknown British band named
Sleeper opened the show, and while they ob
viously had no hope of competing with the
main attraction, the group still performed a
memorable set. Energetic and engaging, the
group centered around assertive lead singer
Louise Wener, whose vocal style provided
the essential rhythmic backbone to their
music.
The easy comparison to make would be
between Sleeper's Wener and the Pretenders'
Chrissie Hvnde. Indeed, Wener is Sleeper's
main songwriter, and, also like Hynde, Wener
centers her songs around her own unique
vocal approach.
Also like the Pretenders, Sleeper either
succeeds or fails depending on how the band
interprets Wener's vision. As I witnessed in
Seattle, Wener has assembled an impressive
group of musicians. In particular, the drum
mer, Jon Stewart, deserves praise, somehow
invoking images of Keith Moon in my mind,

if perhaps only for his mischievous manner.
(He was, however, the first drummer I have
ever seen who occasionally struck his cym
bals on the upswing.)
While performing, however, the hand
often sounded cluttered, which perhaps was
evidence of songs which sound better in the
studio. Sleeper's latest album, "The It Girl,'

confirms this hypothesis.
Two songs specifically — "Nice Gu>
Eddie" and "Lie Detector" — become
punchy and powerful pop, buoyed b\
Wener's bouncy vocals. On the latter, she ,k
tually makes lyrics like "reads all l>os
tovevskv's household tips' sound natu; il.
On other tracks, like "What Do I Do
Now?" the bands

mixes 80s *.\nih
music with tvpically
blurred punk guitar,
making one wonder
why this fertile syn
thesis hasn't been
tried more often.
Wener has an un
usual gift for pulling a
strong vocal melody
out of thin air, which
saves a number of
otherwise mediocre
tracks, such as "Sale
Of The Century."
At their best.
Sleeper is a very
promising band, cer
tainly capable of com
peting with their
peers in the recent
British pop explosion.
Whether the Ameri
can psyche has room
for one more British
band with a one-word
name is doubtful, but
Sleeper definitely de
serves a Itxik.
