# Sand Hill remains controversial issue
## PA City Council must approve expansion 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
Although the University's controversial
proposal for extending Sand Hill Road con
cerns many area citizens, Palo Alto and Stan
ford officials are waiting eagerly for the signal
to bring in the bulldozers.
Before the construction can begin, the
Palo Alto City Council must review and ap
prove an environmental impact report as
sessing the effects of the Sand Hill project, ac
cording to state law. The project is technical
ly on University property but is under the ju
risdiction of the city of Palo Alto.
Stanford will pay the entire cost for the
$341 million project, which includes a 630-
unit apartment project, a senior housing cen
ter, an expansion of the Stanford Shopping
Center and an extension of Sand Hill Road to
El Camino Real. The site envisioned for the
project includes a substantial amount of the
remaining undeveloped land in the area.
The sheer magnitude of the Sand Hill pro
ject frightens some local residents.
The project "will take the community in
the wrong direction," said Kim Maxwell of
the Crescent Park Homeowners Association
in Menlo Park. "The whole character of the
area will change from rural to urban."

Camas HubenthaJ, spokeswoman for
Midpeninsula Action for Tomorrow, an envi
ronmental group opposed to the Sand Hill
project, said she believes citizens need to be
educated on the project's effects on the com
munity.
Made up of 75 local residents, the group is
holding a series of forums called "Voting for
the Environment" to create dialogue and ex
plore alternative construction sites that
would preserve the San Francisquito Creek
and Ohlone Field area, the last remaining
creek corridor and grassland in the county
and the site of the proposed project.
The group listed loss of valuable open
space in urban areas, loss of a natural buffer
between Menlo Park and Palo Alto, negative
ecological effects and an increase in traffic in
tensity as major points of concern in the
group's recently published report card on the
project.
According to Maxwell, as people become
more aware of what the project means, they
will get angrier.
"In the next three or four months, [Stan
ford and Palo Alto J will hear an increasing
patter of feet from the citizens," he said.
The environmental impact report esti-
mates that there will 1m? 10,000
extra car trips per day along Sand
Hill Road due to the new housing
units and 20,000 redirÂ«>cted trips
and additional trips to the enlarged
shopping center. But traffic flow at
the intersection of University Av
enue and Middlefield Road will ac
tually be reduced as a result of the
project, according to the draft re
port.
Maxwell cited what he sees as
"deep and significant." flaws in the

way the report analyzed traffic im
pact. He pointed to the report's pro
jected reduction in the number of
cars at the University Avenue inter
section as one of its mistakes.
Palo Alto's chief transportation
official, Marvin Overway, said all
the projections in the report are ac
curate.
Since the draft was released
this summer, the estimate for traf
fic flow on University Avenue has
been reviewed by several private
consultants and corrected to pro
ject a slight increase, he said.
According to Overway, citizens'
fears are unsubstantiated. Ex
tending Sand Hill Road will draw

traffic out of west Menlo Park res
idential areas and relieve the al
ready saturated Highway 101 by
redirecting cars to Interstate 280,
he said. Both routes run north
south from San Francisco to San
Jose.
The final report is scheduled to
be voted on by the Palo Alto City
Council in late January. If passed,
some city council officials have
promised to put the issue up for a
referendum.
If the council approves the pro
ject, Stanford will begin construc
tion within eight to nine months,
said Andy Coe, the University's di
rector of community relations.
