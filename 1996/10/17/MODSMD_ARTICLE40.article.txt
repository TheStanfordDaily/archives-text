## Tennessee Burning 'The Chamber' shows colder side of justice in KKK story 
### 
I nearly winced when I learned that
"The Chamber" would be coming to
the big screen this year. There have
been enough movies based on John
Grisham novels lately to make them
predictable; "A Time to Kill" was re
leased a mere two months ago.
This particular film centers around
Sam Cayhall (Gene 1 iackman), a Mis
sissippi death row inmate and white
supremacist who killed two children
during a 1%7 Kn Klux Klan bombing.
Adam Hall (Chris O'Donnell) is the
young, determined lawyer who has 28
clays to save Cayhall from dying in the
gas chamber. It's not long before we
learn that Hall is in tact Cayhall's
grandson; his ulterior motive in han
dling this case is to learn about his
family's dark past.
The plot involves the standard Gr
isham twists. Hall is convinced that
Cayhall has taken the fall for more
prominent Klansmen and attempts to
find evidence that he did not act alone.
To get information, he forms a con
nection with Nora Stark (Lela Ro
chon), a legal aide to the governor. Hall

is then violently threatened by the shadowy
Klan, which has so far kept Cayhall quiet and
doesn't want him uncovering any names.
Meanwhile, much of the decision for
Hall's appeal rests in the hands of the gover

nor, a former district attorney who initially
won the conviction in the Cayhall case.
But that's where the predictability of "The
Chamber" stops. Casting the cheesy action
aside, the story shows a surprising amount of

maturity. The tocus seems to be more on de
veloping the characters than putting their
lives in danger. Hall is portrayed as a naive
and weak lawyer who becomes increasingly
frustrated as every one of his arguments for

appeal is denied by the
courts. This is a strong con
trast from the miracle
working lawyers of "The
Firm" and "A Time to Kill."
A lot of the heroism is actu
ally applied to Cayhall, who
appears to be stubbornly
racist but has secretly suf
fered from his moral crimes
over the years.
Hackman delivers a strik
ing performance as the
complex Cayhall, as does
Faye Dunaway, who por
trays Cayhall's troubled
daughter Lee Bowen.
O'Donnell and Rochon
aren't as convincing, but
their characters are meant to
be less flamboyant. Another
person to note is Bo Jackson
(yes, that Bo), who makes
his acting debut here as
Sam's prison guard. Bo may
know baseball and football,
but he don't know movies.
Overall, "The Chamber" is
a good film. Unlike its pre
decessors, it shows a truer,
colder side of justice. Now,

could someone please explain to me why
these movies require a scene with the lawyer
running for his life wearing a suit and carry
ing a briefcase?
