## Spike Lee's 'Get on the Bus' drives down to reality 
### 
In "Get on the Bus," director Spike Lee
tries to dismiss the misconception that last
year's rally of solidarity by African Ameri
cans, The Million Man March, was centered
solely around the controversial Nation of
Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan.
In the tradition of "Do the Right Thing"
and "Malcolm X,' Lee uses this story of 15
diverse black men making a 3,000-mile bus
trip from Los Angeles to the march in
Washington, D.C., to inform the public that
the march was about throwing away excus
es, giving up violence and accepting re

sponsibility— not demagoguery.
As Lee said himself, "Self-reliance is the
key, and we as African Americans are start
ing to lose the vestiges of slave mentality and
discover that we can rely on each other."
Beyond refuting the "Farrakhan thing,"
Lee uses a set of diverse character profiles to
address a number of pressing issues rele
vant to African Americans, including
black-on-black violence, gangs and person
al responsibility.
The characters include Gary (Gabriel
Gasseus), a biracial police officer in South
Gentral struggles with the death of his fa
ther by a black policeman; Jamal (Isiah
Washington), a former gang member who

now works with at-risk teens; and George
(Charles Dutton), the organizer of the trip,
who just hopes that "we'll come back as bet
ter men than those who left."
These men provide a refreshing change
from the deluge of recent media and
evening news reports which, as Jamal says,
"think they got us all figured out as the four
K's — rapper, robber, rapist or rioter."
A couple of scenes are a bit cumbersome
and the message is way too obvious. In one,
two white Tennessee state troopers pull
over the bus and bring dogs to "search for
drugs being smuggled through these parts."
In another, the bus stops so two of the men
can have a fistfight while Bob Marley's

"Songs of Freedom" plays in the back
ground.
Those scenes are the exception to the
rule, however. The power of this movie is
that it works on a number of levels. Many
people, including myself, who only read
and heard sound bites from speakers and
participants in the march, came away with
just a superficial knowledge of the march.
But the combination of social commentary
with realistic portraits of a diverse set of
characters and the issues they face vaults
"Get on the Bus" above a simple story and
into a film that makes you think and sticks
with you long after its conclusion.
