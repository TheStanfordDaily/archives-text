Did anyone besides me and my sister Jo ever used to watch
that "Anne of Green Gables" series? The one where Anne
starts out about 10 years old and then gets through school and
accidentally dying her hair and realizing Marilla is a good per
son under her marm-ish exterior and at the end Anne is about
20 and she's kissing Gilbert on the bridge? By the way, how
cute was Gilbert? Well, where Jo and I are from, they run the
miniseries on a channel even more obscure than PBS, and so
they have to interrupt episodes at pivotal moments to beg
viewers for money. And since this channel airs out of, like,
Kentucky, all these people with atrocious accents are offering
you Anne dolls and Anne diaries if only you'll write a check. But
then when enough people call and pledge, they say, "Thank
yew all. It's only because of generous viewers like yew that this
quality programming can continue." Well, that's kind of how I
feel now. Submit your classies to intermission@daily or bring
them to the Intermission cubicle at The Daily.
