## Femme Fatale Geena Davis kills to thrill in action-packed 'Long Kiss Goodnight' 
### 
Director Rcnny Harlin is determined to
make his wife Geena Davis into an action hero.
I silt down for Harlin's latest effort, "The Long
Kiss Goodnight," somewhat reluctantly, with
the knowledge that not many people had seen
their last collaboration, "Cutthroat Island."
1 also left my seat reluctantly two hours later
because I wanted to see Davis kick some more
butt.
The movie opens on the eighth year of
Samantha Caine's (Davis) life as an amnesiac.
Somehow she has become an elementary
school teacher and is raising a daughter whose
father she can't remember. She's hired seedy PI
Mitch Henessey (Samuel Jackson) to figure out
who she is. He warned: From here on out every
thing's highly implausible, but unless you were
expecting Merchant and Ivory, it's all in good
fun.
After Caine hits a deer with her car and starts
getting her memory back, Henessey makes a
breakthrough. Meanwhile, a State Department
official known as Mr. Perkins (Patrick
Malahidc), in charge of secret counterassassins,
gets nervous seeing footage ofCaine in a Christ
mas parade because she shouldn't be alive.
At this point, schoolmarm is gone and the
truth is discovered: Chine's really Charlene
(Charly) Baltimore, a counterassassin recruited
by the not-quite-patriotic Mr. Perkins for
Chapter, a State Department "black bag opera

tion." After breaking the neck of an intruder
with her bare hands, Caine starts killing bad
guys at an exponential rate.
Davis makes for a pretty impressive coun
terassassin / working mom action heroine,
proving that you can kill a guy while strapped
to a water wheel. In the movie's best scene,
which had people cheering, Davis shoots the
bad guys accurately while they're in a car and
she's speed skating on a lake, looking like some
kind of Nordic goddess wielding a very large
firearm.
And Davis really looks capable of these
things: She's big (6 feet tall), somewhat buff and
looks pretty good in a tight black 007 outfit with
short blond hair and a Eurotrash makeup job.
But while Davis impresses, the men lose.
There's not a single strong male in the tlick, and
lackson is definitely not his usual menacing
"Pulp Fiction" self. Instead, he's the comic re
lief: an incompetent pervert who sings badly. If
it's any consolation, he's convincing.
Finally, the climax involves Perkins orches
trating a fake terrorist hit. He rigs a truck bomh
in a New Jersey town for the sole purpose of
proving that the State Department needs a big
ger slush fund to tight terrorism. (Interesting
how villains have changed since the end of the
Cold War.)
My only complaints: While never boring,
the movie took too long to end and the title is
not related to the story in any way. But who re
ally cares as long as Davis saves the day?
