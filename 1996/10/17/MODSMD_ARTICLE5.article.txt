# Socially responsible endowment proposed

Student leaders have proposed the estab
lishment of a new endowment fund for Stan
ford that would allow for some investment
money to be directed to socially and environ -
mentally responsible corporations.
The proposal, authored by ASSU Vice
President Nick Thompson and his assistant,
Kelly Naylor, currently is being considered
by officials of the Board of Trustees and
Stanford Management Co.
Under the current terms of the proposal,
money given to the fund would be invested
in "socially and environmentally responsi
ble" corporations, said Thompson. Only cor
porations that successfully meet strict crite
ria focused on environmental and social con
cerns would benefit from money invested.
For example, companies that contribute
to social repression or environmental de
struction would be screened off by the man
agers of the fund, Thompson said.
"It's a question of how we spend our
money," he said. "How can we make the

most money while helping
the most people? When I
spend $20 on a product, I
can ask how much it bene
fits me. Or I can ask how
much it will benefit soci
ety."
"This is a way to invest in
socially responsible compa
nies, [rather than] strictly
looking at the financial re-

turns of your investments," said Linda Kim
ball, staff member to both the trustees' Spe
cial Committee on Investment Responsibili
ty and the University's Advisory Panel on
Investment Responsibility.
The APIR is composed of students, staff
and facultv and acts as an adviser to the
SCIR.
Thompson stressed that directing money
to the fund would be an entirely voluntary
option for alumni to choose when donating
to the University.
