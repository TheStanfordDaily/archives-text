# Socially responsible endowment proposed
## 
### Juan Pablo Toro 
Student leaders have proposed the estab
lishment of a new endowment fund for Stan
ford that would allow for some investment
money to be directed to socially and environ -
mentally responsible corporations.
The proposal, authored by ASSU Vice
President Nick Thompson and his assistant,
Kelly Naylor, currently is being considered
by officials of the Board of Trustees and
Stanford Management Co.
Under the current terms of the proposal,
money given to the fund would be invested
in "socially and environmentally responsi
ble" corporations, said Thompson. Only cor
porations that successfully meet strict crite
ria focused on environmental and social con
cerns would benefit from money invested.
For example, companies that contribute
to social repression or environmental de
struction would be screened off by the man
agers of the fund, Thompson said.
"It's a question of how we spend our
money," he said. "How can we make the

most money while helping
the most people? When I
spend $20 on a product, I
can ask how much it bene
fits me. Or I can ask how
much it will benefit soci
ety."
"This is a way to invest in
socially responsible compa
nies, [rather than] strictly
looking at the financial re-

turns of your investments," said Linda Kim
ball, staff member to both the trustees' Spe
cial Committee on Investment Responsibili
ty and the University's Advisory Panel on
Investment Responsibility.
The APIR is composed of students, staff
and facultv and acts as an adviser to the
SCIR.
Thompson stressed that directing money
to the fund would be an entirely voluntary
option for alumni to choose when donating
to the University.
According to Thompson, the endowment


Thompson
fund will not interfere with the
Stanford Fund â€” a fund to which
unrestricted gifts may be donated.
In fact, he said, its appeal to
alumni concerned with social is
sues should increase alumni dona
tions overall and compensate for a
potential decrease in returns on
Stanford investments.
Thompson said his involve
ment with Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford in

spired the proposal.
SEAS has protested invest
ments by companies such as Pepsi-
Co, Texaco and Unocal, claiming
their economic presence in Burma
support a military dictatorship
guilty of violating civil rights and
destroying the environment.
The original draft of the pro
posal describes a plan to devote
about 70 percent of the progres
sive endowment fund's money to
large, stable companies that do not
affect the environment negatively
or contribute to social repression.
Twenty percent of the fund's
money would go to small compa

nies that actively contribute to the
environment's welfare, while the
remaining 10 percent would be
used to invest in "high impact
community loans," such as educa
tional loans for the poor of East
Palo Alto, Thompson said.
According to Kimball, "stu
dents feel that the proposal is a
way to address their concerns on
social issues."
The proposal will be submitted
tomorrow to Stanford Manage
ment Co. CEO Laurance
Hoagland and Board of Trustees
member Roger Clay, chair of the
SCIR.
