Supervisor killed in Purdue University dorm
WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — A shotgun-wielding Purdue University freshman
killed a dorm supervisor yesterday who had turned him in on a cocaine charge, then took
his own life as police closed in.
According to reports, Jarrod Allan Eskew, 18, of Crawfordsville, walked into Wiley
Hall, a four-story, red brick men's dormitory housing mostly freshmen.
He entered the third-floor room of Jay Severson, a 27-year-old graduate student from
Fair Oaks, and shot him twice.
"I just heard a big, loud blast. And then I heard what sounded like something drop
ping," said freshman Kevin France, who lives on the floor above. "It was so loud I could
feel the floor shaking."
Eskew then ran down the hall, locked himself in his room and shot himself, Purdue
spokesman Joe Bennett said.
Police evacuated the building and, afler a room-by-room sweep, fired tear gas into the
room, burst in and discovered Eskew's body.
University spokeswoman Ellen Rantz said Severson had found cocaine in the Eskew's
possession on Tuesday and alerted campus police, who searched his room and confirmed
the drug possession.
Freshman Joe Blauvelt said Severson was well-liked and responsible.
