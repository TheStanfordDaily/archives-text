Dear On Campus Resident Students,
On April 12,1995, President Gerhard Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice, in their response to the Grapes Policy Committee, charged the
Dean of Students and the Office of Residential Education to collect and
make available balanced informational materials from which residents
of on-campus housing could make informed decisions about whether
they wanted to have California Table Grapes served in their dining
servery. This service is an issue because of a standing boycott on grapes
called by the United Farm Workers Union and because of the impact
that it has on a significant part of the Stanford community.
Resident Fellows and Resident Assistants in all houses have been given
copies of a report submitted by the 1995 Grapes Policy Review
Committee. In this report, the issues surrounding the dispute over
boycotting California Table Grapes are discussed with testimonials from
some of the prominent figures on both sides of the issue. This final
report and excerpts from the report can be found on the world wide
web(http:/ / rescomp.stanford.edu/ grapes/).
In addition, on October 23 at 7:30 p.m., Channel 51 will televise the 1995
program "Grapes in the '90s: Serving Grapes at Stanford. During this
program, a panel of five speakers discuss their views for and against the
UFW boycott on California Table Grapes. We strongly encourage you to
view this program to hear directly from these speakers their perspective
on the grapes issue. We also encourage you to participate and attend
other educational programs addressing this issue that may be held in
your house or available elsewhere on campus.
It is expected that the residential staff will facilitate the acquisition of
information on the grapes policy and the information on different
perspectives for their residents. In Fall Quarter, you should have the
opportunity to vote on whether or not to serve grapes in our servery. If
you have questions about this voting or what the current policy is in
your residence hall, please ask your Resident Fellow or Resident
Assistant.
We encourage you to become educated and make informed choices
about this issue of whether or not to serve grapes in your dining
servery.
Sincerely,
Jane Camarillo, Director of Residential Education & Graduate
