Bauer articulat
ed the central
themes of his vi
sion in his State
of the School ad
dress yesterday
in front of a fac
ulty audience in
Fairchild Audito
rium.

Bauer began with a discussion
of medical research, which he said
continues to bring recognition to
the University as a "source of fun
damental discoveries" in biology
and biomedical sciences.
However, while research in
basic science departments has ex
perienced steady growth, clinical
science departments have not
fared as well. Bauer expressed
concern that competition in med
ical care may jeopardize clinical
research.
Moving "from bench to bed
side," Bauer spoke of the impor
tance of translating research re
sults into patient care solutions.
This crucial work will be accom
plished in special centers, over
seen by a committee comprised of
faculty members with diverse re
search interests, he said.
New facilities for these centers
are in the planning stages and, if
approved, will become a tangible
representation of "commitment
to clinical excellence." As research
space is a "finite" commodity, it
will be "essential to utilize space
efficiently and productively."
Bauer went on to point out that
"the quality and successes oi our
faculty will ultimately determine
