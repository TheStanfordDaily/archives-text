Medical School
Dean Eugene
Bauer articulat
ed the central
themes of his vi
sion in his State
of the School ad
dress yesterday
in front of a fac
ulty audience in
Fairchild Audito
rium.

Bauer began with a discussion
of medical research, which he said
continues to bring recognition to
the University as a "source of fun
damental discoveries" in biology
and biomedical sciences.
However, while research in
basic science departments has ex
perienced steady growth, clinical
science departments have not
fared as well. Bauer expressed
concern that competition in med
ical care may jeopardize clinical
research.
Moving "from bench to bed
side," Bauer spoke of the impor
tance of translating research re
sults into patient care solutions.
This crucial work will be accom
plished in special centers, over
seen by a committee comprised of
faculty members with diverse re
search interests, he said.
New facilities for these centers
are in the planning stages and, if
approved, will become a tangible
representation of "commitment
to clinical excellence." As research
space is a "finite" commodity, it
will be "essential to utilize space
efficiently and productively."
Bauer went on to point out that
"the quality and successes oi our
faculty will ultimately determine


Bauer
the quality of the School of Medi
cine." Praising the achievements
of the faculty, he noted that, ac
cording to independent organiza
tions, Stanford ranks only 16th in
the output of publications but sec
ond in impact.
Mentioning the talent of new
department chairs and faculty
members, Bauer said he felt "ex
cited, in fact buoyed, about future
prospects." Additionally, the Med
ical Center Office of Development
will work with department lead
ers to endow at least 12 professor
ships over the next three years.
On the other hand, since "ex
cellence in clinical teaching and
clinical medicine" are difficult to
evaluate, Bauer made note of
problems with criteria for faculty
advancement.
Although it is impossible to
come up with a universal formula,
committees tackling the issue will
make the process easier to under
stand, he said.
Furthermore, the declining
ratio of billings to collections may
threaten the financial health of
the Medical Center. Bauer sug
gested developing an explicit com

pensation philosophy which
would link a greater portion of
staff compensation to perfor
mance-based criteria and offer
competitive packages based on
specialty.
Discussing the challenges of
preparing students for leadership
roles, Bauer stressed the impor
tance of "programs responsive to
real needs."
As changes in federal policy
threaten graduate student fund
ing, Bauer offered a variety of so
lutions, including stabilizing the
number of students and establish
ing University fellowships. The
Office of Development will launch
a campaign to raise $20 million
over five years for these programs.
Bauer also praised accomplish
ments in maintaining diversity
and promoting minority partici
pation. However, the proportion
of underrepresented minorities
and women among postdoctoral
fellows and faculty remains no
tably lower than among medical
students and house staff.
In discussing the integration of
the Medical School with the Uni
versity in general, Bauer cited a
history of collaboration with the
School of Engineering and faculty
contributions to the undergradu
ate curriculum.
Predicting that significant

changes will take place in academ
ic medical centers and in their re
lationships with parent universi
ties, Bauer expressed hopes of
meeting them in a manner "com
patible with not just surviving but
with excellence."
Bauer's message would not
have been complete without a
statement regarding the possibili
ty of a merger with the UC-San
Francisco Medical Center.
Conceived as a response to a
changing local market, discus
sions of the merger have contin
ued intensely, he said.
In becoming a "premier med
ical enterprise in Northern Cali
fornia," the new conglomerate will
need to transition from a school
based and department-based sys
tem to an "enterprise-wide, inte
grated practice."
Pending negotiation between
the Stanford and the UC Regents,
the merged medical centers will
experience their "period of infan
cy" starting July 1997, according
to Bauer. This timeline is "subject
to slippage," he warned.
Bauer wrapped up his address
with reflections on a "post-Dar
winian era of academic medi
cine," whose challenges he said
could be met by laying down the
necessary foundations outlined in
his vision.
