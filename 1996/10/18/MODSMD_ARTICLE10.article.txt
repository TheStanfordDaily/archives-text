## Gold rush! Campaigns bid for votes 
### 
SAN DIEGO (AP) â€” California's 54 electoral votes
were the immediate target yesterday as President
Clinton and Bob Dole began a 19-day dash to Election
Day with the incumbent targeting traditionally
Republican territory in hopes of blocking any path to a
GOP comeback.
The morning after the second and final presidential
debate, strategists from both campaigns studied
polling data as they debated strategies on issues,
advertising and travel for the campaign's closing
stretch.
Dole and fellow Republicans said they were buoyed
by his final debate performance. They predicted Dole's
questions about Clinton's ethics would motivate GOP
base voters and convince independents to give the
GOP nominee another look.
"I'm breathing easier," said Dole campaign manag
er Scott Reed. But he and other Republicans conceded
there was a long way to go if Dole is to reverse Clin
ton's lopsided lead in the quest for 270 electoral votes.
"I think he needs to drive home two messages: One
is trust, and the other is taxes," said Republican poll
ster Ed Goeas.
"Now he has to find a way to shake independent
voters and get them to reassess their early decision to
support Clinton," Goeas said.
With the debates over and the campaign now
reduced to day-to-day combat, Democrats were dubi
ous Dole could engineer a redefining moment.
"The biggest problem for Bob Dole is all the funda
mental opportunities to be seen, be evaluated and be
re-evaluated are now over, and there is no evidence
voters have changed their opinion of Bob Dole," said
Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
On the morning after the debate, both campaigns
talked boldly.
Dole told a rally in Riverside, Calif., that on the
morning after the elections, "Bill Clinton will be the
most surprised man in America."
