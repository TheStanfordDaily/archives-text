Dinosaurs of a feather?
NEW YORK (AP) - Chinese paleon
tologists have found the remains of a 121
million year-old feathered dinosaur, pro
viding what could be the most graphic
evidence yet that birds are descended
from the prehistoric titans.
Photographs of the fossilized creature
show an unmistakable downy stripe run
ning down its back. If the feathered
dinosaur is confirmed, say paleontolo
gists who have seen the fossil, then it
provides almost irrefutable evidence that
today's birds evolved from dinosaurs.
"As soon as they showed me the speci
men it just blew me away," said Phil Cur
rie, a paleontologist who recently saw the
fossil in Beijing. "You can't come to any
conclusion other than that they're feath
ers."
Nobody has ever found feathers on
anything other than a bird. So the feath
ered fossil provides further ammunition
for the already widely accepted theory
that dinosaurs gave rise to birds. That
theory is now based mostly on the simi
larity in shape of bird hip bones to those
of one dinosaur group.
Yesterday, Chen Pei-Ji of the Nanjing
Paleontology Institute showed pho
tographs of the fossil at the American
Museum of Natural History, where the
Society of Vertebrate Paleontology is
holding its annual meeting. The pho
tographs show the flattened remains of a

bird-like beast splayed out on a slab of
rock, its neck twisted backward at an
agonizing angle.
Nixon papers released
COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -
Richard Nixon revealed to Henry
Kissinger, then his national security
adviser, that their conversations were
secretly recorded, apparently to keep him
from taking credit for successes in for
eign policy.
This was in November 1972, when the
secret White House taping system was
supposedly known to only a handful of
staffers.
Nixon, who hated personal confronta
tion, instructed Chief of Staff H.R.
Haldeman to tell Kissinger "you don't
make the decisions, and when they are
made, you waver the most."
Haldeman's handwritten note, which
recorded his instructions from the presi
dent, was part of 28,000 Nixon adminis
tration papers made public today by the
National Archives here. Nixon's lawyers
had opposed their release for years but
chose not to fight when a review board
decreed there were no grounds to sup
press them further.
Haldeman mentioned the circum
stances in his diary, published posthu
mously in 1994. Kissinger was claiming
he was responsible for the newly reestab
lished opening to China, Haldeman said.
