# Yeltsin ousts feuding Russian security chief
## 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Sacked by a livid
Boris Yeltsin amid charges he was plot
ting a coup, national security chief
Alexander Lebed wasted no time yester
day serving his own gruff notice: He will
be out to campaign for the ailing presi
dent's job.
The Kremlin, rent by power struggles
as Yeltsin prepares for heart surgery,
turned out to be too small for the aspira
tions of both these high-powered leaders,
who feuded openly during Lebed's four
month stint in the president's inner cir
cle.
Although Yeltsin gained office with
help from the widely popular, 46-year
old Lebed, the relationship paid off for
Lebed, too. Pursuing his own designs on
the presidency, Lebed increased his pop
ularity by reaching a peace agreement
with Chechen rebels; he raised his pro
file by incessantly criticizing — and infu
riating — his Kremlin peers.
The dismissal came just a day after
Lebed's bitter rival for authority in secu
rity decisions — Interior Minister Ana
toly Kulikov — accused him of plotting
to form his own 50,000-man army with
sights on seizing power in a "mutiny."
No evidence surfaced to back this sen
sational charge, and Yeltsin ignored talk
of coups when he announced Lebed's
ouster on national television.
Scowling, moving stiffly but speaking
clearly and more resolutely than he has
in recent appearances, Yeltsin declared
that Lebed's unilateral actions, excessive

ambition and outspokenness were dam
aging to the country.
With hands clenched into fists on the
table in front of him and eyes narrowed,
the president looked angrier than he has
in years and healthier and more in com
mand than he has in weeks.
"I can't tolerate the situation any
more," Yeltsin said, slowly and deliber
ately signing a decree dismissing Lebed.
He spoke at the health spa where he has
been resting up for heart bypass surgery
next month.
Pegged by many as Yeltsin's likely
successor, Lebed was characteristically
unbowed. He announced plans to start
campaigning soon to replace Yeltsin,
who many suspect is too ill to serve out
the rest of a term that lasts until 2000.
Lebed denied the coup allegations, and
has insisted he wants to gam office only
through the ballot box.
He said he would not launch his cam
paign while the president is alive.
"Today he's an elderly and ill person,"
Lebed said. "It's not for me to kick the
one who is down."
Lebed gave up his seat in the State
Duma, parliament's lower house, to take
the Kremlin job. The seat has not been
filled, and deputy speaker Mikhail Gut
siriyev said yesterday that Lebed could
reclaim it.
Lebed's departure could end for now
the noisy Kremlin infighting that has
created a widespread impression of
chaos.
