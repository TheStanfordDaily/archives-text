### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The econo
my appears to be cooling and may not
need higher interest rates to keep it from
overheating and igniting a fresh round of
inflation, new government reports sug
gest.
Data released yesterday showed resi
dential construction and industrial pro
duction both slowed in September, while
business inventories and the number of
new claims for jobless benefits grew
faster than expected.
Stock and bond prices mostly rose on
the reports, which were interpreted as

evidence the Federal Reserve will not
raise short-term interest rates soon.
Higher rates would put a drag on corpo
rate profits and lower payoffs on bonds.
The Dow Jones industrial average
posted its third record of the week, rising
38.39 to 6,059.20. The Treasury's 30-
year bond yield fell to 6.80 percent from
6.85 percent late yesterday.
"The reports show an economy that is
still growing but has definitely slowed
from its first-half pace, " said economist
Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc., in
Jacksonville, Fla. "It would indicate

there is no urgency for any Federal
Reserve tightening in the near term."
Although many analysts had expected
the economy to moderate during the sec
ond half of the year, Fed officials have
warned they would boost interest rates if
needed to prevent any acceleration in
inflation.
The economy was growing at a robust
4.7 percent annual rate during the sec
ond quarter, the government has report
ed, but economists at Macroeconomic
Advisers in St. Louis believe it has now
slowed to less than half that pace.
