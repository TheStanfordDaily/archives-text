# Amid joy, soccer stampede kills 84
## 
### 
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) - The
joyful screaming of fans drowned out
the shrieks of panic. Even as
paramedics and firemen began laying
out the corpses, fans were doing the
wave.
The horror of what happened
Wednesday night was slow to dawn on
the more than 50,000 people at the
Mateo Flores stadium, a frenzied
crowd wild with anticipation of the
World Cup soccer qualifying match
between Guatemala and Costa Rica.
Only when radio stations began to
broadcast news of what had happened
in a dimly lit corner of the stands did a
hush fall over the crowd and the play
ers stop their warmups.
Then, President Alvaro Arzu took

the field, microphone in hand.
"One of the worst tragedies in our
country has occurred tonight," he
said. He said the match was suspend
ed and declared three days of mourn
ing.
The stampede killed 84 soccer fans
and injured 147, a fire department
spokesman, Herbert Leiva, told The
Associated Press late yesterday. It
apparently resulted from the same
factors that have created soccer
tragedies before: too many spectators,
too much crowding, few ways to
escape when an incident sparks a
panic, and panic that kills.
The fans began to arrive hours
before the 8 p.m. match. They started
flooding in when the stadium opened

at 4:30 p.m. They filled the 45,000
seats and benches, paying between
$50 and $3 each.
Then they began to clog the aisles,
clambered atop walls, even up to the
rooftops.
There were no security checks.
Many fans brought in beer.
The black-bereted Special Forces
police were helpless to keep fans out of
the aisles.
But alarmed by the growing
throng, they began to close entrances
at about 7 p.m., leaving many angry
ticket holders outside.
At about that time, two men were
arrested on suspicion of selling coun
terfeit tickets — a practice that offi
cials later said led to overcrowding.
