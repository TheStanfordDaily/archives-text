## Keeping CIV afloat 
### 
CIV Design and Review
Committe needs to talk
to current CIV faculty

FOR ALMOST A decade,
Cultures, Ideas and Values
has been the defining liber
al arts experience of every first
year student at Stanford. Born
out of the turbulent "Western
Civilization" debate, CIV has
always been a compromise, and
everyone recognizes that some
tracks are more rigorous than
others.
But students and faculty
should be wary of some of the
changes being considered by the
CIV Design and Review Commit
tee.
The committee has made an
extraordinary attempt to get
feedback and input from students
that have participated in the CIV
curriculum, highlighted by a
comprehensive survey of last
year's graduating seniors. Ironi
cally, though, the committee has
neglected to consult the very peo
ple who make the program run,
CIV professors and instructors.
While it is very encouraging to
see student input playing such an
important role in reshaping the
graduation requirement, the
committee must stay in constant
contact with those instructors
who are implementing and
improving CIV every day. The
input of both current students
and instructors is vital.
One immediate concern is that
the seniors who participated in
the CIV survey last spring may
have taken a substantially differ
ent CIV than the one being
taught today.
Since CIV curriculum changes
are made each year for improve
ment, the committee may be
looking at a CIV system that no
longer exists. It might be more
helpful to study the year-end
track evaluations that all CIV
students fill out every year.

As for the proposed changes,
committee members need to keep
in mind that any mandatory
course like CIV must maintain
the highest standards. It is essen
tial that section leaders and lec
turers remain qualified doctorate
holders. This is, after all, one of
the single defining aspects of the
CIV curriculum. Stanford fresh
men deserve specialized attention
from experienced teachers, not a
once-over-lightly from first-year
graduate students.
The fear is that CIV will
become a two-quarter letdown
for those students who are
already interested in the liberal
arts and a big waste of time for
those not already excited about
reading classic texts.
The new freshman seminar
that is being proposed may look
like a good alternative to a third
quarter of CIY but it is not. Any
course that seriously tried to give
students an introduction to the
history and issues of the humani
ties and social sciences needs a
full academic year. No doubt, spe
cialized seminars could be great
additions to the freshman experi
ence, but they should not be used
to derail a full year of CIV
The implications of reducing
CIV to two quarters are tremen
dous. It is essentially the first
step toward killing the program.
According to CIV lecturers,
reducing the course to two quar
ters would translate into a sub
stantial salary reduction for sec
tion leaders and lecturers, even
tually making CIV a completely
unattractive course to teach. Not
only is it impossible to live on two
quarters' worth of salary in the
Palo Alto area, but it will be vir
tually impossible to recruit quali
fied faculty to teach the course.
The CIV committee should
work with students and faculty to
maximize the strengths and over
haul the weaker points of the cur
rent system; it should not partic
ipate in the erosion of a demand
ing and rewarding year-long aca
demic adventure.
