Are Internet users really 'cream of the genetic crop'?

AS A BIOLOGIST, I was fascinat
ed to read in the recent article
regarding Internet relationships
(Tuesday's Daily) that Internet users
are the "cream of the genetic stock," in
the words of Dr. A 1 Cooper of Stan
ford's Counseling and Psychological
Services. And that Dr. Cooper advises
his patients that the Internet is an
excellent gene pool to dive into.
The article continues with the
undoubtedly true assertion that the

average Internet user is young, bright
and successful. But was this statement
offered as evidence in support of the
claim that the Internet gene pool is
above average? And is this advice given
tongue-in-cheek (as I would hope) or
as seriously as suggested in your arti
cle?
Claims about the genetic basis of
intelligence and other human behav
iors abound in the popular media, but
few of these claims are well supported

by available research. The social impli
cations of these assertions are pro
found and lead to frequent abuse of
research in support of particular ethi
cal and political arguments.
Access to the Internet requires
either money or affiliation with institu
tions, such as this university, that pro
vide free or inexpensive connections to
students and employees. And unless I
missed the news, not even the most
zealous proponents of genetic deter-

minism have claimed they have "found
the genes" for wealth or university
attendance.
Searching for relationships on the
Internet also requires the ability to sit
glued to a computer for many hours
conversing with complete strangers —
not necessarily the attributes that rank
at the top of my list in a potential part
ner.
