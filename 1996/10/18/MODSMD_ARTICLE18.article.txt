# Power sources of P.A., Stanford and PG&E need to be connected

### 
The effects of the Stanford blackout,
from Berkeley all the way to Monterey,
are slowly becoming known. The Stan
ford Daily performed heroically, moving
its editorial operation from its offices in
the area served by the Cardinal cogener
ation plant to a student residence in the
PG&E area. It was quite a feat to get
out the paper, and the staff deserves
congratulations.
However, the basic problem remains
When a massive blackout hits communi
ties, most of them are plunged in dark
ness. The Stanford area is lucky in that
there are three independent systems
serving neighboring areas: PG&E, the

Cardinal cogeneration plant and the
Palo Alto city system.
It should be simple to connect the
three systems so that if there is a black
out in one, the others automatically kick
in. That the state-of-the art cogeneration
plant did not include this provision is
incredible.
To put all the blame on two rats, now
reportedly cooked and unable to defend
themselves, is an insult to the reputedly
high intelligence of the Stanford com
munity.
