# Students present concerns to Casper
## Parties, disabled access among issues discussed at 'Tea and Cookies' 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper was served
up everything from light fare to heavy questions last
night in the latest of his periodic "Tea and Cookies"
sessions at Tresidder Union.
In the format — part of a series of open meetings
with students — Casper took questions for more than
an hour on topics ranging from skateboarding on cam
pus to disabled access to campus community centers.
More than 100 students attended the meeting.
Casper, with assistance from Dean of Students
Marc Wais, also fielded several questions on the status
of campus parties in the wake of two recent incidents
in which the police were called in to break up the fes
tivities.
"This can be a very, very unhappy dilemma," said
Casper. "It is not easy to find a happy solution."
"Stanford is not a sanctuary against the law," Wais
added, "but we are not trying to make it into a police
state either. We are trying to ensure that students
hold safe and successful parties."
Wais said recent guidelines on party planning de
veloped by the Office of Student Activities are not per
manent and are open to student input and change.
One student raised the issue of access to commu
nity centers for disabled students. She said many
centers — such as the Hillel Foundation or the Les-

bian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center — are difficult or im
possible for disabled students to
reach.
"We are all Stanford students,
and that just doesn't work,"
sophomore Jessica Lehman said.
"We are doing as much as hu
manly possible to make everything
as accessible and available to you,"
Casper responded. "We need your
help by participating in the plan
ning."
Wais added that the University
has asked an architect to examine
the community centers to see if
any changes can be made to the ex
isting structures in order to make
them more accessible.

Casper also took a question on
the issue of registration from
Simon Weffer, a graduate student
in sociology, who asked that the
University consider having stu
dents pre register for classes.
University Registrar Roger
Printup, who was also in atten
dance, said he is in support of pre
registration, and the University
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement is examining the
issue. Printup said the University
is considering electronically link
ing the time schedule, Stanford
Bulletin, Bookstore orders and
campus library system for stu
dents.
One student raised the issue of
University cutbacks.
"In the last two years, Stanford
has gone in two different direc
tions," said senior Ines Diogo.
"There has been a hike in tuition

costs as well as a cutback in the
number of services. Are we cheat
ing the students that Stanford
purports to attract?"
Casper said the University is
committed to keeping up the qual
ity of education.
"We are not making any
promises to anyone that we are not
keeping," he said. "We are trying
to give people a realistic picture of
what they can expect."
The evening was not without its
humorous notes.
In response to a question from a
computer science graduate stu
dent concerned about the avail
ability of lunch at the Gates Com
puter Science Building, Casper
said the students themselves may
have to look for solutions.
"Perhaps the nerds just aren't
interested in having lunch," he
lightheartedly said.
