# Shen's shenanigans
## 
### 
I am an undergraduate student at
Stanford. I have recently read the Daily
article regarding ASSU President Bill

Shen's expenditures. His comments in
The Daily do not seem to be apologizing
for his obviously overzealous use of
funds that he has been entrusted with.
As a student voter, I would like to
say that I am sorry to see someone that
I supported take such an arrogant
stance about his duties and obligations
to the students and University.
Just because he believes the ASSU
should be extremely important in every
student's life does not give him the
right to spend money that is not his, for
causes that aren't necessarily supported
or approved by his constituents, the
general student body.
Mr. Shen, please keep the students
and University in mind, not your own
"publicity" or the furthering of the
ASSU's "publicity." The ASSU has
obviously had enough help from you.
