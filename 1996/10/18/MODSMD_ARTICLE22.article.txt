## Seeking sanity at Stanford 
### 
"We should favor and help everything
which contributes to a general rise in the
level of sanity."
— Joe Jonah Euclid
MANY PEOPLE HERE are insane.
Wait, I must define my terms
before I word-sling like that. Let
me differentiate between what I deem
"outside-world insane" and "Stanford
insane." I subscribe to the notion that the
idea of sanity implies conformity to an
unmentioned set of behavioral norms, and
I can demonstrate that the norms we fol
low at Stanford are different than those in
the outside world. Consider this dialogue
between a Stanford student and an auto
mechanic of the same age:
Stanford student: What did you do last
weekend?
Mechanic: Friday night I went to a strip
bar. Saturday night I drank a bottle of Jack
and fixed my uncle's tractor. That mother
roars! On Sunday I participated in the
Bowl-for-Jesus tournament. And yourself?
Stanford student: Friday night I heard
an a cappella concert. Saturday night I
went out for some frozen yogurt. Sunday
night I read Hegel and watched "The Lion
King."
Mechanic: Oh, you're one of those.
This is not to say that our notions of
normal behavior do not overlap. Enter a
third participant in the dialogue:
Stanford student: How was your week
end?

Bum (visibly shaken): Umhumhum.
Ikkkooo! I gotta go, man.
Stanford student: What's that he's
drinking?
Mechanic: Prestone.
But except for extreme cases like this,
what happens in the University and what
goes on outside are governed by widely dif
ferent systems. This poses a problem for
the undergraduate, who has not commit
ted to an academic life and must navigate
both worlds in order to keep contact with
parents, friends and prospective employ
ers. Consider this conversation between an
undergraduate and her father:
Father: What are you studying this
quarter?
Undergraduate: Linguistic relativism,
Marxism and female saints.
Father: (reaches for Maalox) Sounds
good.
Or consider this excerpt from an inter
view:
Senior: I wrote my thesis on decon
struction.
Employer: So why are you applying for
a job in construction?
Or this exchange between a student and
an old buddy:
Buddy: So what are you into these days?
Student: Kant.
Buddy: Amen, brother.
So the problem is posed: We need to live
in two largely incompatible societies that
operate by different rules, yet both are
important to us if we want to have any
thing like a balanced existence. Luckily,

the best cure is a simple one. If you want to
maintain balance, if you want to be able to
go home to your friends and parents and
not feel like a sideshow geek, there is one
good solution: Ix;ave campus, often. Get
out. Violate 280. Stray across Sand Hill.
Pedal past Page Mill. Cruce El Camino.
You in the computer cluster. You've
been there too long. You play Doom too
much — you're beginning to look like some
of the monsters. Yeah, I'm talking to you,
Gollum.
And you in the library, with the books
piled high. Yes, you in the South Mezza
nine. Ever wonder why you have to go to
the South Mezzanine to study?
Lug the tome to the beach. If your read
ing is really that important to you, you will
prefer it to the crashing of the waves.
And yet in the end we gain something
from the isolation of the Farm. There is a
peace here that can never be attained at
any institution integrated into a city and
that allows for a studious repose the likes
of which we may never have again. Enjoy it
— suck it up, but only until it starts to
make you nuts. Then, get a change of
scenery for however long it takes and come
back. Despite its faults, this place isn't
hard to miss.
