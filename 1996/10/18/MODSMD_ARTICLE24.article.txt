## Spyros Andreopoulos Stanford- UCSF merger has been tried and has failed before

THE FRENCH
have a saying,
"Plus fa change,
plus c'est la me me
chose." The more
things change, the more
they are the same.
That seems to be the
case with the contro-

versial merger of Stanford Health Ser
vices and UC-San Francisco hospitals,
whose proponents consider it a novel
idea and necessary for their survival.
Actually, Stanford and the University
of California first tried to combine their
medical schools and hospitals in 1914.
Both schools faced severe fiscal problems,
and a merger seemed the right thing to
do. Talks went on for months. When they
finished, both sides came to the
inevitable conclusion that combining a
public with a private institution couldn't
be done legally.
If that holds true today, the proposed
new merger could be dead on arrival.
The history of this early attempt is
contained in the meticulously kept min
utes of the Stanford medical faculty
meetings from 1909 to 1914. They were
discovered recently in the Lane Medical
Library archives by Prof. John L. Wilson,
a retired surgeon who is writing a book
about the Stanford School of Medicine.

When Stanford acquired Cooper Medi
cal College in 1909, the medical school's
predecessor in San Francisco, Stanford's
trustees had no clue how costly the new
venture would be. The budget of the
school had jumped from $25,000 to
$100,000 a year, a hefty sum in those
days, and the trustees wondered if they
should close the school.
It was Dr. Hay Lyman Wilbur, dean of
the school, who suggested a merger with
UC instead. "It is desirable that the uni
versities should unite their resources in
medicine into one large medical school
under a common management," he
wrote.
Wilbur recommended a nine-member
board of managers to run the combined
school. It would be composed of a dean,
"the best available man regardless of
locality," and a faculty administration
committee to be selected by the board of
managers.
A UC regents committee considered
the proposal, and Dr. Herbert C. Moffitt,
dean of the UC Medical School, informed
Stanford of its decision. "The authority
of the state is invested in the board of
regents," Moffitt wrote. "(It] cannot be
transferred to others. ... The majority
control of the board of management of
the united school must rest with the
board of regents."

Stanford's trustees replied that they
considered it "impossible to formulate
any plan for the union of the medical
schools." In the opinion of the board,
they wrote, "the trusts they are adminis
tering do not permit their turning over
either property or income to be managed
and disbursed by any institution in
which they do not have at least an equal
voice."
The regents wrote back affirming
their "deep desire" to see the amalgama
tion of the schools completed and called
on Stanford's trustees "to suggest a basis
on which a merger may be brought
about."
But according to Wilson, the trustees
treated UC's latest overture with suspi
cion. It was an open secret in those days
that UC's master plan called for every
effort to absorb the Stanford medical
school, a competitor, into the state sys
tem.
The notion of a truncated and subordi
nate medical school for Stanford was
repugnant to the trustees, he wrote. On
May 29, 1914, the Stanford trustees
informed UC that "no basis of a merger
can be formulated, or exists, which is
compatible with the legal powers and
duties of either university."
"If such merger could be formed," they
added, "it would cause no material saving

in expense to either university. . . . The
interests of each university and of the
public will be best served by the mainte
nance of the two separate schools, each
pursuing its own methods and standards
and so far as possible supplementing each
other."
This ended the affair, but anyone who
has followed the present talks between
Stanford and UCSF will recognize that
very little has changed in 82 years even
though there are important differences.
The present plans involve the joining of
hospitals and clinical operations, not the
medical schools which presumably will
remain separate.
The composition of the governing
board was a pivotal issue in 1914 as it was
in 1996 before the two sides agreed to
have their hospitals operated as a private
nonprofit organization, and as such to be
exempt from state open meetings laws
that could allow their "trade secrets" to
be scrutinized by their competitors and
the public.
The present merger plans call for the
transfer of yet unspecified public assets
from UCSF and approximately $700
million, including reserves held by Stan
ford Health Services, to a new corpora
tion in which Stanford and UCSF will
each have only 30 percent control on the
board.

But in 1914, both institutions
acknowledged that a merger and transfer
of assets under conditions that violated
their charters could not take place. What
has really changed in a legal sense to
allow it now?
Some UC regents have acknowledged
they are unsure about their authority
under the state constitution to transfer
public property. They intend to ask the
courts for clarification. No such concern
has been raised by Stanford's trustees
about their authority in a deal tanta
mount to giving away the store. An expla
nation would seem appropriate for the
benefit of faculty, staff and donors who
helped create Stanford's medical enter
prise as we know it today.
Next month, after another delay and
barring any unforeseen surprises in an
independent consultant's report, the UC
regents are expected to approve the merg
er, and Stanford trustees to follow suit.
If it happens, it can be said with cer
tainty that the wheel of circumstance has
turned full circle. Let us only hope that it
works.
