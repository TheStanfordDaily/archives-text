## Cal to visit Cardinal raging waters 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
Coming off a breakthrough
weekend in Stockton at the Nor-
Cal Tournament, the Stanford
men's water polo team looks to
retain its newly achieved No. 3
ranking against No. 4 California
tomorrow at deGuerre Pool.
The upcoming game marks
Stanford's fourth conference
game of the season, each of which
plays a crucial role in seeding for
the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration tournament.
"The key issue here is that it is
an MPSF official game, one of
eight which count toward our
seeding," said coach Dante Detta
manti. "Seeding is critical in these
tournaments because you do not
want to play a difficult game in the
first round."
Indeed, each conference game
for the Cardinal through the end
of the season should prove to be of
utmost importance as only the top
two teams will be invited to the
NCAA tournament in December.
Standing at 2-1 in conference
play with a loss to UC-Irvine early
in the season, the Cardinal must
make every opportunity for a con
ference win count.
