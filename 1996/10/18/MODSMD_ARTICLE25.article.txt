## Cal to visit Cardinal raging waters 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
Coming off a breakthrough
weekend in Stockton at the Nor-
Cal Tournament, the Stanford
men's water polo team looks to
retain its newly achieved No. 3
ranking against No. 4 California
tomorrow at deGuerre Pool.
The upcoming game marks
Stanford's fourth conference
game of the season, each of which
plays a crucial role in seeding for
the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration tournament.
"The key issue here is that it is
an MPSF official game, one of
eight which count toward our
seeding," said coach Dante Detta
manti. "Seeding is critical in these
tournaments because you do not
want to play a difficult game in the
first round."
Indeed, each conference game
for the Cardinal through the end
of the season should prove to be of
utmost importance as only the top
two teams will be invited to the
NCAA tournament in December.
Standing at 2-1 in conference
play with a loss to UC-Irvine early
in the season, the Cardinal must
make every opportunity for a con
ference win count.

Tomorrow's contest represents
such an opportunity, and the Car
dinal will look to capitalize.
"We need to play the kind of
game that we played against UCI,"
said sophomore forward David
Hay, speaking of Stanford's 10-9
triumph against Irvine on Satur
day. "To do that we have to stop
their holeman, Brent Albright, as
well as their counterattack."
"Albright will be one of our
national team members next
year," Dettamanti said. "To stop
him we need to create mismatch
es.
While Cal indeed represents a
worthy opponent, the team is con
fident that they can exploit their
weaknesses.
"They pretty much have one 2-
meter man in Albright, and one 2-
meter defender," Dettamanti
said. "We have a lot of center for
wards that we can use to wear
them out, and we know their ten
dencies."
Once again, the depth of the
Stanford squad proves to be one
advantage that it has going into a
tough game.
Against Irvine last weekend, the
second unit played the entire third

quarter against the Anteaters*
starters.
When the refreshed starters for
the Cardinal returned in the fourth
quarter, they dominated the
exhausted Irvine squad and pulled
out the win.
"It's important that our second
line play as well as it did against
Irvine," said sophomore forward
Arturo Rodelo.
"Ten guys played solid polo, and
it really helped us to win," Hay
said.
While the depth of this year's
team continues to lead the Cardi
nal to victory, much rests on the
shoulders of senior Brian Wallin.
His consistent, dominating play
creates much frustration for the
defense of opposing teams.
Leading the team with an
astounding 42 goals in just 14
games thus far this season, Wallin
earned MPSF Player of the Week
honors for his performance in the
NorCal tournament.
Indeed one of the top players in
the country this season, he has
shown that he has what it takes to
lead a team to victory, routinely
scoring goals at opportune times to
spark a Cardinal win.
So while the Card may be con
cerned about the play of one Brent
Albright, the Golden Bears had
best look out for Stanford's leader,
No. 4 Brian Wallin.
