### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The two winners of four of the last six
NCAA championships will collide tomorrow at
7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion when the fourth
ranked Stanford women's volleyball team (14-
1, 7-0 Pacific 10 Conference) faces No. 13
UCLA (12-6, 4-3).
The Cardinal will first have to deal with

numbers, hopefully keeping the Trojan hitters
off balance.
Last week against Oregon and Oregon

State, the Card recorded more than 20 blocks
and kept both opponents' hitting percentages
below .100. Stanford plans for much of the
same tonight.
"We always take the first night's match
more seriously," Shaw said. "If we start look
ing toward UCLA, we could be in trouble."
The Maples Pavilion faithful will surely
wait anxiously for UCLA. The two teams have
a rich history of head-to-head competition.
The Card defeated the Bruins in the 1994
NCAA championship match, but the Bruins
are the last team to defeat Stanford at home, a
