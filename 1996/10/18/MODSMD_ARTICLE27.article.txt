Because this weekend, consumer advo

challenge yet.
He's picking the games with me in the
NCAA football picks of the week.
Stanford at Oregon State
Did you hem- about the new horror
flick that opened last weekend? It's called
"Weekend of the Living Dead." I haven't

seen it yet, but I guess it's about all these
guys that die for a month or so, and just
when their friends and family miss them
most, they crawl out of their graves and
stumble back home (much to the surprise
of those who expected them to remain in
their coffins).
You haven't seen it? Wrong. The story
is based on the true-life tale of the 1996
Stanford offense. The flick stars Chad
Hutchinson in his first major role, and
Mike Mitchell and Andre Kirwan have
surprisingly large parts. Oh, and Tyrone
Willingham makes his directorial debut.
But ladies and gentlemen, don't race to
the theaters just yet. This movie opened
against pitiful competition last weekend
and continues playing tomorrow against
absolutely zilch. Even Siskel and Ebert,
like most of us, don't know whether to
give the thumbs up or thumbs down.
Mv suggestion to Roger and Gene: Just


Reagan
Demas


Ralph
Nader
suck your thumbs for a while.
Although tomorrow's game
against the Beavers (who haven't
won a game in 15 attempts) won't
provide a basis for proper judg
ment, in a few weeks we should
know whether Stanford's offense
has truly come back to life or if it
will simply slip back into a coma.
As for this weekend, both Ralph
and I know that a Stanford victory
over OSU is as imminent as a mul
timillion dollar profit at General
Motors. Granted, during the first
four games of the season Stan
ford's offense scored less than
Beavis and Butthead do in an hour.
But it'll only take one point to
damn the Beavers. To prove just
how sure I am, if OSU triumphs
this weekend in Corvallis I'll vote
for the Green Party in the Presi
dential election.
Does that mean that if the
Beavers win Ralph will cast his bal
lot for Dole?

California at Washington State
Even most Berkeley fans that I
have talked to know that the down
fall is inevitable. After a dreamy
undefeated start to the season, the
Golden Bears are about to find
Freddy Krueger disrupting their
REM.
The Cougars have won four of
five games and will be hosting the
Weenies up north. If the cold
weather doesn't ice the Bears, the
second-quarter epiphany that
makes them realize how bad their
defense bites certainly will.
Ralph is a no-go on my anti-Cal
bandwagon. Once again, he blazes
his own trail. He says the Bears
will win 34-9.
If the Bears don't win, any num
ber of factors could be responsible.
It might be the NCAA governing
committee, wielding power against
Nader as a powerless participant in
the "machine" and fixing the
game. It might be that colleges
themselves, with their big fat
endowments, subjugate all who
dwell on campus and direct their
puppet-like players to win or lose
any given contest at the Universi
ty's profit-driven whim.
Or, perhaps, a Washington
State victory might just mean that
Cal is the sorry, overrated, Nean
derthalesque heap of unskilled

football matter that most analysts
have dubbed it since September.

USC at Arizona State
Bow to the Sun Devils. Kiss the
desert sand they walk on. Since
they'll be representing the Pacific
10 Conference in the Rose Bowl in
January, now is the time to
befriend them.
And why not? Arizona State is
cruising toward an undefeated sea
son with only a tiny speed bump by
the name of USC left in the road.
And this Sun Devil quarterback
— wow. If Jake Plummer were a
race horse, he'd have won the
Triple Crown. As it turns out, he
became only one of a handful of
players in college football history to
score touchdowns in all three
capacities from scrimmage — pass
ing, running and receiving.
Ralph fights the system again
on this pick. He calls Arizona State
"overrated" and picks the Trojans
by a big margin. Unfortunately,
USC's inept running game would
need the return of O.J. Simpson —
minus the gimpy leg and the tar
nished image — to have Johnnie
Cochran's chance at a KKK rally of
winning the game in Tempe.
Ralph: USC by 15

UCLA at Washington
First question: Have you seen
the Huskies play this year? Second
question: Which one of Washing
ton's two teams did you happen to
catch?
That's right — the Husky foot
ball squad has been diagnosed with
an acute case of multiple-personal
ity disorder that makes Sybil look
like the most well-adjusted child on
the planet.
No sooner does Washington win
a few big games and play outstand
ing defense than the team takes a
trip to South Bend and gives up
650 yards of offense to Notre
Dame.
So Ralph and I are in agreement
on two things in life: One, that
McDonald's sucks, and two, that
the Huskies should have no prob
lems with the Bruins.

handedly lobbied to get airbags required
in automobiles. And all that stuff about
one man bringing about the consumer's
constitution, better known as The Free
dom of Information Act? Peanuts.
Because this weekend, consumer advo
cate lialph Nader takes on his greatest
challenge yet.
He's picking the games with me in the
NCAA football picks of the week.
Stanford at Oregon State
Did you hem- about the new horror
flick that opened last weekend? It's called
"Weekend of the Living Dead." I haven't

seen it yet, but I guess it's about all these
guys that die for a month or so, and just
when their friends and family miss them
most, they crawl out of their graves and
stumble back home (much to the surprise
of those who expected them to remain in
their coffins).
You haven't seen it? Wrong. The story
is based on the true-life tale of the 1996
Stanford offense. The flick stars Chad
Hutchinson in his first major role, and
Mike Mitchell and Andre Kirwan have
surprisingly large parts. Oh, and Tyrone
Willingham makes his directorial debut.
But ladies and gentlemen, don't race to
the theaters just yet. This movie opened
against pitiful competition last weekend
and continues playing tomorrow against
absolutely zilch. Even Siskel and Ebert,
like most of us, don't know whether to
give the thumbs up or thumbs down.
Mv suggestion to Roger and Gene: Just


Reagan
Demas


Ralph
Nader
suck your thumbs for a while.
Although tomorrow's game
against the Beavers (who haven't
won a game in 15 attempts) won't
provide a basis for proper judg
ment, in a few weeks we should
know whether Stanford's offense
has truly come back to life or if it
will simply slip back into a coma.
As for this weekend, both Ralph
and I know that a Stanford victory
over OSU is as imminent as a mul
timillion dollar profit at General
Motors. Granted, during the first
four games of the season Stan
ford's offense scored less than
Beavis and Butthead do in an hour.
But it'll only take one point to
damn the Beavers. To prove just
how sure I am, if OSU triumphs
this weekend in Corvallis I'll vote
for the Green Party in the Presi
dential election.
Does that mean that if the
Beavers win Ralph will cast his bal
lot for Dole?

California at Washington State
Even most Berkeley fans that I
have talked to know that the down
fall is inevitable. After a dreamy
undefeated start to the season, the
Golden Bears are about to find
Freddy Krueger disrupting their
REM.
The Cougars have won four of
five games and will be hosting the
Weenies up north. If the cold
weather doesn't ice the Bears, the
second-quarter epiphany that
makes them realize how bad their
defense bites certainly will.
Ralph is a no-go on my anti-Cal
bandwagon. Once again, he blazes
his own trail. He says the Bears
will win 34-9.
If the Bears don't win, any num
ber of factors could be responsible.
It might be the NCAA governing
committee, wielding power against
Nader as a powerless participant in
the "machine" and fixing the
game. It might be that colleges
themselves, with their big fat
endowments, subjugate all who
dwell on campus and direct their
puppet-like players to win or lose
any given contest at the Universi
ty's profit-driven whim.
Or, perhaps, a Washington
State victory might just mean that
Cal is the sorry, overrated, Nean
derthalesque heap of unskilled

football matter that most analysts
have dubbed it since September.

USC at Arizona State
Bow to the Sun Devils. Kiss the
desert sand they walk on. Since
they'll be representing the Pacific
10 Conference in the Rose Bowl in
January, now is the time to
befriend them.
And why not? Arizona State is
cruising toward an undefeated sea
son with only a tiny speed bump by
the name of USC left in the road.
And this Sun Devil quarterback
— wow. If Jake Plummer were a
race horse, he'd have won the
Triple Crown. As it turns out, he
became only one of a handful of
players in college football history to
score touchdowns in all three
capacities from scrimmage — pass
ing, running and receiving.
Ralph fights the system again
on this pick. He calls Arizona State
"overrated" and picks the Trojans
by a big margin. Unfortunately,
USC's inept running game would
need the return of O.J. Simpson —
minus the gimpy leg and the tar
nished image — to have Johnnie
Cochran's chance at a KKK rally of
winning the game in Tempe.

UCLA at Washington
First question: Have you seen
the Huskies play this year? Second
question: Which one of Washing
ton's two teams did you happen to
catch?
That's right — the Husky foot
ball squad has been diagnosed with
an acute case of multiple-personal
ity disorder that makes Sybil look
like the most well-adjusted child on
the planet.
No sooner does Washington win
a few big games and play outstand
ing defense than the team takes a
trip to South Bend and gives up
650 yards of offense to Notre
Dame.
So Ralph and I are in agreement
on two things in life: One, that
McDonald's sucks, and two, that
the Huskies should have no prob
lems with the Bruins.
