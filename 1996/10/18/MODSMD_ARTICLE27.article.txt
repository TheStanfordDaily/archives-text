# Nostra Demas

### 
He's been working for more than
30 years to empower consumers
and reform the relationship
between government, producers and con
sumers. He has taken on and defeated
some of the most powerful entities in the
nation, leaving corporations and govern
ment departments weeping in miseiy.
Forget about the way he almost single
handedly lobbied to get airbags required
in automobiles. And all that stuff about
one man bringing about the consumer's
constitution, better known as The Free
dom of Information Act? Peanuts.
Because this weekend, consumer advo
cate lialph Nader takes on his greatest
challenge yet.
He's picking the games with me in the
NCAA football picks of the week.
Stanford at Oregon State
Did you hem- about the new horror
flick that opened last weekend? It's called
"Weekend of the Living Dead." I haven't

seen it yet, but I guess it's about all these
guys that die for a month or so, and just
when their friends and family miss them
most, they crawl out of their graves and
stumble back home (much to the surprise
of those who expected them to remain in
their coffins).
You haven't seen it? Wrong. The story
is based on the true-life tale of the 1996
Stanford offense. The flick stars Chad
Hutchinson in his first major role, and
Mike Mitchell and Andre Kirwan have
surprisingly large parts. Oh, and Tyrone
Willingham makes his directorial debut.
But ladies and gentlemen, don't race to
the theaters just yet. This movie opened
against pitiful competition last weekend
and continues playing tomorrow against
absolutely zilch. Even Siskel and Ebert,
like most of us, don't know whether to
give the thumbs up or thumbs down.
