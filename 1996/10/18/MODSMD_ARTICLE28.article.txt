# Soccer to get back on track
## Cardinal women face San Diego at home 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer team is
looking for a breakthrough win today
against the No. 20 San Diego Toreros. The
game is at 2 p.m. on Maloney Field
The Cardinal (7-6) has struggled of late,
having dropped three of its last four games.
This past weekend was particularly frus
trating, as coach Steve Swanson's team
played excellent soccer for all but about 15

minutes in two games and left with losses to
No. 1 Notre Dame 4-0 and Colorado College
2-0. Those setbacks knocked the Cardinal
out of the top 25 for the first time this sea
son.
"I've never played on a team with a
rccord like this before," said senior forward
Erin Martin, one of 15 players in the nation
nominated by the preseason top-20 coaches
for the Missouri Athletic Club Sports Foun-
dation's Women's Collegiate Soc
cer Player of the Year Award.
"It's so frustrating; it's just real
ly disappointing," Martin said.
"We've played well in our games;
we just aren't winning. I think we
need to stop having those mental
lapses, and we could use a little
luck."
"We're doing a lot of things
right," Swanson said. "We need to
fine tune here and there, but for
the most part, we're doing pretty
well. We've had a few mental laps
es that have really hurt us, and
what we need to do is start doing
that to other teams. We need to
start scoring when other teams
make mistakes."
Stanford has beaten San Diego
two years in a row, shutting the
Toreros out both times. But the
Toreros are by no means a
pushover team.
San Diego has worked hard and
played good soccer to achieve its 7-
2-1 record. This year, the squad has
already recorded an impressive 3-1
win over No. 3 Santa Clara, a pow
erful squad which beat Stanford 2-
1 earlier this year and handed No. 1
Notre Dame its first loss in 24
games Sunday.
One of the Cardinal's chief prob
lems this year has been scoring.
Stanford has made plenty of oppor
tunities for itself but seems to be
plagued by bad luck when it comes
to getting the ball into the back of
the net.
"We're obviously not finishing,"
Swanson said. "A lot of that is men
talâ€”we start to think that things
aren't going our way after we hit
the post or crossbar or the goalie
makes a great save. We need to stay
positive and keep banging down
that door. The goals will come.
"It's going to be tough to score
against San Diego. They've only
given up five or six goals this sea
son, but if we can capitalize on our
chances against them, I think it
will really get us going."
This game could potentially
have an impact on the Cardinal's
chance to make it to the NCAA
tournament. This year eight teams
will receive automatic berths, in
addition to the 24 at-large bids

which will be granted. In the past,
the tourney featured only 24
teams.
Should Stanford win the Pacific
10 Conference (the Cardinal is cur
rently 2-0 and has five more con
ference games left), it will automat
ically qualify. If it doesn't, the San
Diego game could be very impor
tant, since the Toreros are in Stan
ford's region.
"It's extremely important to
beat San Diego," said Martin, who
along with freshman midfielder
Ronnie Fair was selected to the all
tournament team for her play last

weekend in the Santa Clara Nike
Classic. "If we don't win, it's going
to be really tough to get on track.
We need to make this game a turn
ing point for us. We can't be down
going into Pac-10 games."
But the Cardinal isn't looking
ahead to the NCAAs just yet.
"You look at this program and
the way it has done so well in the
past, and you know that it's impor
tant," Swanson said. "Right now,
though, we need to focus on the
here and now. We need to think
about the things we can control on
the field.

"To simplify as much as possi
ble, we need to come out and play
hard-working, positive, emotional
soccer for 90 minutes. If we do
that, we're going to do just fine the
rest of the way."
The rest of the way starts
tomorrow with San Diego. Then
the Card has only six more games,
five within the Pac-10, before the
end of the regular season.
"The schedule is running out on
us," Swanson said. "We need to
start playing really well soon. I'm
excited to get back into it [tomor
row]."
