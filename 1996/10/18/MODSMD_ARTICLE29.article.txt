# Card must beat hapless Beavers
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
After a thrilling overtime
win last week at home, the
Stanford football team will be
looking to roll with the
momentum in an attempt to
even up its overall record
tomorrow at Oregon State.
The Cardinal's come-from
behind victory last Saturday
against Oregon marked yet
another solid defensive per
formance and more signifi
cantly, the appearance of the
Stanford offense, which put
14 points on the board in the
fourth while erasing a 10-
point deficit.
On the other hand, the hap
less Beavers (0-5, 0-3 Pacific
10 Conference) will be looking
to reverse a rather dubious
momentum, a losing streak of
15 consecutive games. Winless
in their last 12 conference
attempts as well, Oregon State
last won a Pac-10 contest in
1994 against Washington
State.
Perhaps the most difficult
aspect of playing Oregon
State is not looking beyond
them.
"I think a concern with
Oregon State is what your
players are going to think and
what your players are going to
read that will influence how
they prepare for this ball
game," Stanford head coach
Tyrone Willingham said. "We
have to get everyone in our
program on the same page."
Yet Stanford (2-3, 1-1) has
assured that it is taking Sat
urday's contest in Corvallis
seriously.
"In no way are we over

looking them," junior defen
sive end Kailee Wong said.
"Every year you have to play
Oregon State. We will not
approach this game lightly at
all."
Despite the Beavers'
record, a win at Oregon State
does stand as a much-needed
Pac-10 triumph in the quest
for a bowl bid
"It's now or never for us in
terms of making a bowl
game," senior running back
Mike Mitchell said. "Oregon
State is on the rise, and we
have to take care of that
game."
Oregon State's offensive
attack depends largely on who
will be taking the snap from
center, a decision still up in
the air. Starting quarterback
Tim Alexander is still recover
ing from a hamstring injury
but may be ready come tomor
row If not, David Moran will
be calling plays for the
Beavers.
With Alexander at the
helm, the Beaver offense is
dangerous because it empha
sizes the option, which the
Cardinal has seen sparingly.
"We don't face the option,
except on maybe eight other
plays throughout the year,"
Willingham said. "You see
teams that will mix it in
there, but at some point, this
team is going to consistently
run the option. That is very
difficult to prepare for."
Oregon State is more of a
passing offense with Moran in
the ball game, but the Beavers
are trying to open up their
offense either way. After just
