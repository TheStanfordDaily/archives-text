# Menlo residents criticize Sand Hill project
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
Although it is the Palo Alto City Council
that must OK Stanford's Sand Hill Road pro
ject, Menlo Park residents are fighting to
have their voices heard in the debate, too.
Residents of the neighboring suburb ex
pressed deep reservations about the project
during a city council meeting earlier this
week, asking their elected officials to take a

strong stand against the University.
John Shaffer, a Menlo Park resident for 22
years, raised concerns about the traffic com
plications that could result from the project,
which seeks to develop and widen a part of
Sand Hill Road. Shaffer was also concerned
about years of "dirt and dust" from construc
tion.
In addition, Shaffer said, the University
funded a study of the project's impact on Palo
Alto and should do the same for Menlo Park.

Menlo Park Transportation Commission
er Paul Collacchi stressed that the draft envi
ronmental impact report on the project is
sued by Palo Alto was "inadequate" and
therefore precluded the citizens' "ability to
have due process" during the public com
ment period.
A final environmental impact report on
the project is scheduled to be released in late
December, after which there will be a 10-day
period for public comment before the Palo

Alto council votes.
Collacchi urged the council to make a for
mal request for Palo AJto to circulate a sup
plemental draft before releasing a final re
port. This draft should give residents "an op
portunity to make a meaningful review" of
the report.
Dan Dippery, a spokesman for Midpenin
sula Action for Tomorrow, a coalition of local
residents working to "protect the
quality of life," asked why it took
the council until October to assert a
strong position against the project.
According to Dippery, communi
ty members are fighting the project
because it "destroys balance."
Community organizer Chuck
Kinney joined the call for a letter to
Palo Alto articulating Menlo Park's
position on the project. He also
urged the two cities to cooperate in
seeking a mutually acceptable solu
tion.
According to Menlo Park Mayor
Bob Burmeister, Palo Alto will con
sider the council's request for a
meeting between representatives of
the two cities.
Menlo Park resident Anita Dip
pery said sharing sales tax income
from the project with Palo Alto is
not an adequate answer to objec
tions of the activists. It is the project
itself, not its financial benefits, that
citizens target, she said.
Council member Dee Tolles con
firmed that sharing the tax income

is merely one of the suggestions
submitted by Menlo Park as com
mentary on the draft report.
Collacchi and Kinney are both
campaigning for two openings on
the council, as are Planning Com
missioner Harry Harrison and in
cumbent Tolles. The Sand Hill con
troversy has become a crucial issue
in the November election.
Following the meeting, Dan Dip
pery expressed his surprise over the
apparent lack of involvement by
Stanford students and faculty. The
Sand Hill project offers "tremen
dous opportunities for environ
mental and social action," he said.
Anita Dippery added that the
University has fallen far short of its
world-class reputation in its han
dling of the project.
Senior David Soergel, a member
of Students for Environmental Ac
tion at Stanford, said that although
he personally dislikes the project,
the organization is not doing any
thing about it at the moment.
After a meeting with a local ac
tivist, SEAS has entered a "strate
gic planning stage," said Soergel. In
two weeks a "more focused idea of
what [SEAS] campaigns are"
should emerge, he added.
