# Menlo residents criticize Sand Hill project

Although it is the Palo Alto City Council
that must OK Stanford's Sand Hill Road pro
ject, Menlo Park residents are fighting to
have their voices heard in the debate, too.
Residents of the neighboring suburb ex
pressed deep reservations about the project
during a city council meeting earlier this
week, asking their elected officials to take a

strong stand against the University.
John Shaffer, a Menlo Park resident for 22
years, raised concerns about the traffic com
plications that could result from the project,
which seeks to develop and widen a part of
Sand Hill Road. Shaffer was also concerned
about years of "dirt and dust" from construc
tion.
In addition, Shaffer said, the University
funded a study of the project's impact on Palo
Alto and should do the same for Menlo Park.

Menlo Park Transportation Commission
er Paul Collacchi stressed that the draft envi
ronmental impact report on the project is
sued by Palo Alto was "inadequate" and
therefore precluded the citizens' "ability to
have due process" during the public com
ment period.
A final environmental impact report on
the project is scheduled to be released in late
December, after which there will be a 10-day
period for public comment before the Palo

Alto council votes.
Collacchi urged the council to make a for
mal request for Palo AJto to circulate a sup
plemental draft before releasing a final re
port. This draft should give residents "an op
portunity to make a meaningful review" of
the report.
