## Golf to keep momentum at home 
### Parker Hume 
Whenever the words "Stanford golf' are spoken,
one name comes to mind: Tiger Woods. Woods, he of
the 340-yard drives and $40 million Nike contract,
is gone now. However, a force that may become just
as synonymous with success in college golf can be
seen daily on the driving range and on the Stanford
Golf Course.
Beginning today, the Cardinal women's golf
team will put its skills on display in a three-day
tournament at home. Stanford will face San Jose
State along with other participants who should pose
stiffer competition than that faced by Stanford last
week.
Dominant is the only way to describe the perfor
mance put on by Stanford in Washington last week.
Although facing a relatively weak field, the Cardi
nal stormed to victory in its first tournament of the
season. Not only did Stanford demolish the field,
winning by an astounding 11 strokes, the Cardinal
set a course record for overall low score.
Although many of its major competitors were in
Ohio playing in an NCAA-sponsored preview tour
nament, the Cardinal felt it benefited from the
weekend.
"We got to know what it feels like to win," said
senior standout Andrea Baxter. "It was really good
for us."
In addition to the strong play of seniors Baxter
and Mhairi McKay and sophomore Michelle Sperry,
two newcomers — freshmen Julie Dunn and Jae-
Jean Roe — also provided strong play.
Coming off a victory in which good performances
were turned in by all, the team has very high expec
tations for the upcoming season. After finishing a
disappointing fifth in the NCAA Championships
last year despite having the lead going into the final
round of play, the team's goal is simple — to win an
NCAA crown. "This team is definitely more tal
ented than last year's," Baxter said. "It is our best
shot to win the NCAAs in my four years here."
Although there are only two upperclassmen on
the team, the relative inexperience has not seemed
to be a problem so far. The veteran players were
pleasantly surprised at the outstanding play of both
freshmen.
"Normally it takes the freshmen at least two or
three tournaments to get adjusted to playing in col
lege," Baxter said. Based on their performances last
weekend, Dunn and Roe are the exceptions rather
than the rule.
But this weekend, the Cardinal will have to over-

come two very tough Western
schools, Arizona and nearby
rival San Jose State. These
teams, perennial powers in
women's golf, will both be look
ing to shatter the dreams of the
Cardinal. As college tourna
ments normally include fields of
12 to 18 teams, the Cardinal will
not square off against either of
its rivals in a head-to-head
match but will compete with
them collectively.
Although only the second of

13 tournaments, and still a long
way off from the NCAA Champi
onships that take place May 22-
25, a win this weekend would be
a major step forward for the Car
dinal.
However, if the Spartans
manage a victory, the effects will
be far from disastrous. Unlike
many other sports in which
berths to NCAA Championships
are rare, the Stanford women
are almost assured a berth in the
20-team field.
Now the only thing that
remains to be seen is whether
the dream will turn into an
NCAA trophy come late May.
