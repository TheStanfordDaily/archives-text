# Soccer's own Big Game
## Men challenge the Bears 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Men's soccer travels to
Berkeley on Sunday to play
perennial rival California in a
game that will decide much
more than bragging rights. A
victory for the Cardinal would
be a breakthrough win against a
top-10 team, while a victory for
the Golden Bears would all but
clinch the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation title.
Although Stanford has
proven time and time again that
it has the ability to compete
with any team in the country, it
has yet to prove that it can beat
any team in the country. No. 2
Cal is as good as teams come
and the Cardinal has every rea
son to believe it can tame the
Bears.

Coming off a disappointing
loss to the Oregon State Beavers
Sunday, Cal (10-2-2, 1-1 MPSF)
looks to justify its highest rank
ing in over 45 years as the No. 2
team in the country. Cal entered
last week at No. 8, but defeated
then-No. 2 Washington to earn
the No. 2 position for itself.
Although Stanford lost to
Washington last Sunday by the
narrow margin of 1-0 in a game
that the Cardinal dominated,
the Stanford men manhandled
the Beavers. Whether this will
bode well for the Card remains
to be seen, but what seems obvi
ous is that both teams will have
a lot on the line and both are
capable of playing top-notch soc
cer.
"This game has all the mak
ings for a very exciting contest,"
said Stanford coach Bobby

Clark. "We've been close several
times this year to getting the big
victory against a top team that it
seems to me that we're due for
one. Although I thought it
would come against USF and it
didn't, I told the lads that per
haps it was better to wait for
Cal."
The Bears are an all-around
solid team, using precise defense
and quick shooting to bury their
opponents. Cal likes to get the
ball in behind the opponent's
defense and then flick the ball to
the middle for the quick shot.
The Cardinal defense, which
played particularly well against
Washington and USF, will have
to continue its clean, mistake
free play if Stanford is to win
this game.
