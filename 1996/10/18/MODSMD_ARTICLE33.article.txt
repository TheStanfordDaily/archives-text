# Sailors try lasers at PCCs

### David McGee 
The Stanford sailing team is
hoping for a serendipitous out
come this weekend when the
Cardinal travels to Long Beach
for the Pacific Coast Intercolle
giate Yacht Racing Association
Single-handed Championships,
hosted by USC.
The regatta's top two individ
ual finishers will qualify for the
national single-handed champi
onships held next month.
The team will race in lasers,
the most popular single-handed
boats. However, this is not a rac
ing style that the Stanford team
concentrates on, as most major
collegiate regattas are double
handed.
"We'll be pleased with what
ever we get," head coach Steve
Bourdow said. "Ninety-five per
cent of our races are in dinghies
(double-handed boats). This type
of racing just isn't a big focus for
us because it's not a big focus for
college sailing."
Nonetheless, Stanford sailors

have just as great a chance to
succeed in the regatta as any
other competitors, due to the
depth of the squad.
Stanford will send seven
sailors to Long Beach, including
last year's national qualifier,
junior Danny Zimbaldi.
The remainder of the Stan
ford contingent consists of
junior John Meade, sophomores
Taylor Robinson, Tyler Doyle
and Steve Kleha and freshmen
Anika Leerssen and Martin
Fichtner.
Leerssen is making her first
collegiate start, but according to
Bourdow she is already a very
accomplished laser sailor. Ficht
ner is also an unknown in the
collegiate scene, but has previ
ously sailed with the Mexican
national team.
The regatta will start tomor
row morning with a three-race
elimination to cut the 25 boats
that will start the regatta down
to the 16 that will continue in
the final races. Bourdow antici
pates most, if not all, of the

Stanford sailors will qualify for
the finals.
"All seven should be able to
qualify," he said. "And to be sail
ing around the course having six
friends out there makes a differ
ence. They're six boats that
won't get in your way."
Bourdow sees Stanford's
toughest competition coming
from two Hawaii sailors, Patrick
Whitmarsh and Chris Jewett,
and UC-San Diego's Mark Barra.
Almost every school in the dis
trict will have at least one repre
sentative present.
How well Stanford fares,
though, may depend on the
weather. Bourdow predicts that
if it is windy and choppy, the
advantage could go to Meade and
Zimbaldi, who he said excel in
these conditions. If it's not
windy, any of the others have a
good chance.
"I'm really looking for John
and Danny to step up," Bourdow
said. "If we don't get a (national)
qualifier, I'll be a bit surprised,
maybe a little disappointed."
