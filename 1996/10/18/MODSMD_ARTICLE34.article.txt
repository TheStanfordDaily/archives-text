# Runners split to conserve energy
## 
### Gil Lopez 
Before taking a two-week break from competi
tion in order to focus on training for the Pacific
10 Championships, the cross country teams will
travel to both the Arizona Invitational in Tucson
and the Cal Poly Mustang Invitational in San
Luis Obispo tomorrow.
Only the men's team will compete in Tucson.
Facing a field of 33 teams, 11 of which are ranked
in the top 25 in the nation, the Cardinal will have
to send a split squad.
The race will serve as a pre-Nationals meet
and could be integral for clinching an at-large
berth in the Nov. 25 NCAA Championships in
Tucson, should the Cardinal fail to qualify out
right at the District VIII Championships at Fres
no State on Nov. 16. Taking one of the top three
spots would all but clinch that at-large berth.
"This (men's) team is very unique," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "I don't think we'll ever have
another team like this. It's everything you can
desire in a team.
"We have the depth and now we're utilizing it.
Because of the depth of the men, no one has had
to run all of the meets in the last three weeks."
Both the men's and women's teams will com
pete in the San Luis Obispo meet, which will be
comprised of 20 teams, most of which are from
California and Nevada.
Because having the women race in both meets
would mean forcing certain runners to compete
three weeks in a row, the coaching staff decided
to withhold the women's team from the Tucson
meet.
"We've identified the things we needed to
work on," Lananna said. "After this weekend, we
have three solid weeks of training.
"Our next meet isn't until Nov. 2. That means
we can rest and train for a nice block of time."
The Pac-lOs will be held at the Stanford Golf
Course on Nov. 2. The women, who are ranked
third in the nation and won consecutive confer
ence titles in 1993 and 1994, will attempt to
recapture the championship they lost to Arizona
last season. They have already defeated the Wild
cats this season in earlier competition on Sept.
21.
The second-ranked men are looking to win the
Pac-10 for the first time since 1985, the only
championship in the team's history. Stanford's
biggest rival is defending champion Oregon,
whom the Cardinal will not see in action until the
championships.
