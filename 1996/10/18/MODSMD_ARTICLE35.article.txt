## Doing our part to spread paranoia & fear Baby stolen by blue jay 
### Patrick Smith Editorial Staff 
Two graduate students are in mourning this
morning after an aggressive blue jay alighted
from its perch high atop a pine tree, descended
upon the trio, latched on to their baby's left ear
with its beak, then flew away in a westerly
direction.
The startled couple, identified as John and
Salmonella Johnson, hail from Valdosta, Ga.,
and are both currently enrolled in the Law
School. John, currently in his second year in
the program, feels that "people who violate the
' law need to get with the program and be
responsible contributors to America's gross
national product."
His wife, Salmonella, a first-year student
claimed that "law is an inviolable social contract
signed at birth" and is the only thing preventing
her from going on an all-out-shooting-spree when
she's feeling tired and irregular.
Campus security officers were alerted to the
scene when officer Lynn Trout spotted a flashing
blue light. "I came as fast as I could, but that
baby's dead now and there's nothing I can do no
more (sic)," Trout said. "I just have to go on with
my life and pretend like it never happened.

Someday it's possible this will deeply disturb me.
But I can't worry about that now."
The baby, only 17 months, 3 weeks, 7 days old,
was reportedly irritable from teething pains at
the time. Observers at the scene speculate that
the wildly gesticulating child may have provoked
the bird into leaving its nest and attacking him.
"Yeah, that baby makes lots of noise," report
ed Tom Thig, a junior from Boca Raton, Fla.,
majoring in biochemistry. "I have a baby, too, but
she's quiet and leaves the birds alone. That John
son baby is a handful of Crystal Meth, let me tell
you."
It is not yet known whether the family will
have a funeral or await the discovery of the
baby's corpse somewhere on campus. "It's possi
ble this bird has flown south," claimed Anthro
pology Prof. Whip Henley. "She could be very far
away, so far we will never know what happened to
that baby."
In a related story, two students petitioned the
University to establish a Baby Eating Club, to
preserve the memory of the lost infant. An
unidentified University representative said she's
seen the paperwork but could possibly get away
with procrastinating from taking action for three
or four more days at least, or until her superiors
realize she's been assigned the project.
