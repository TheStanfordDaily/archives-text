# Rats attack power center â€” 6 hostages
## 
### Kitten Sparkles Staff writer 
Two angry rats, dissidents from a
local foragers and gatherers union,
attacked a black tube containing three
high voltage wires, wires used by a local
Internet service provider servicing Sili
con Valley. Seven federal workers at the
scene were maimed then beheaded; UFO
literature was later found surgically
inserted into the earlobes of their sev

ered skulls.
The attack, in full gear by midnight,
began with a high pitched yelp from a
rotund rat with blue, weary eyes wield
ing a malodorous wind beaten skull-and
crossbones flag. In all, 300 rats charged
the power compound. Two hundred
ninety-eight either chickened out or
were felled by land minds planted by
proactive Stanford security guards. Two
rats made it to the voltage control box.
The two rodents, identified as "gray

rat suffering fourth-degree burns" and
"rat suffering from lacerations to cervi
cal column," were pronounced dead at
the scene. They are now in a white room
decaying with other corpses. "They have
passed on and are now with the lord,"
said a man in the room nonchalantly
chewing on a butter sandwich.
Services for the rats will be held in an
non-denominational ceremony at
Memorial Church. Devo will perform at
the reception following.
