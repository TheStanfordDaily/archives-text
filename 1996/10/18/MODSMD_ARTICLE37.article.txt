# Student totally freaks out in White Plaza
## 
### Patrick Smith Editorial writer 
A 19-year-old junior college transfer
from White Plains, N.Y., totally
freaked out in White Plaza yesterday
at noon.
Josh Winthrop threw down his book
bag, ripped off his bandanna and
screamed, "I'm bananas." He then
claimed to be Godzilla and began dis
tributing leaflets on the dangers of
nuclear radiation.
"I don't know why he did that" was
the chorus from a group of fraternity
brothers who witnessed the scene.
"Yeah, we were making Little Willy
break dance to some old Curtis Blow
records when it all went down. He just
went nuts! I don't know why and if you
ask me, it's weird."
"I think he must be crazy," said

Lynn Chu, a particle graphics major.
"He had no reason to do that, and it
makes me mad. Who knows how this
might potentially affect the way other
people on campus feel? It could really
make somebody hurt, somebody with
low self-esteem who likes bananas."
The Nuclear Regulatory Agency
immediately released a statement
maintaining nuclear power was safe
enough to wear and aids in the diges
tion of mercury.
A spokesman was, however, at a loss
to explain how it spawned a 70-foot-tall
creature capable of destroying large
cities with its fiery breath.
"It's possible," he mused "that this
young man is not Godzilla but is rather
a human being suffering from a rare
mental condition known as object cyni
cism."
Bob Dole, president and CEO of

Dole Bananas, also issued a statement.
Distancing himself from Winthrop,
Dole said, "Bananas have been good to
some people, and those people have
had bananas for a long time.
We should however, continue to give
bananas to those people because they
want bananas and they need bananas."
Winthrop has been remanded to the
custody of his resident assistant and
must perform 20 hours of community
service. "It's clear that they want to
establish a clear connection between
freaking out and helping out," said Hal
Jones, professor of behavioral psychol
ogy.
Each time a person does something
we as a community consider undesir
able, we should immediately make
them participate in a program that
helps our community. That way they
associate the two."
