# Studious students rewarded
## 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Whoever thought Exotic Erotic was the
one chance to feast his or her eyes on full
frontal nudity hasn't visited the Green
Library lately. This month, students on the
third floor have been greeted by a sweet
smelling bearded man intent on exposing
himself. The most recent episode occurred on
Oct. 10, when the scruffy, mid-sized man
flashed three unsuspecting male students
studying for an E6O midterm.
Under the condition of anonymity, one stu
dent reported that the man donned an expen
sive Armani trench coat, smelled vaguely of
Drakkar and was "well-built and oddly attrac
tive." Described as a dark-haired, white male of
about 40 years, the suspect is reportedly
streaking in an attempt to thwart University
efforts to "clean up this oversexed campus."
In a disturbing twist, the suspect is believed
to be a University official / Bookstore employ
ee. He reportedly became disgruntled when
the University, under the guidance of the vigi
lante director of New Student Orientation,
refused to allow him to bring his pro-pornog
raphy campaign to campus during Orientation
week.

Despite the many oddities of this case, one
thing remains painfully clear: The act was
aimed at undermining the quiet academic
and pristine sexual life of the entire Universi
ty . , ,
A top University official, who requested
anonymity due to his close relationship with
the suspect, called the incident "most disturb
ing, one which cuts to the very core of what we
as a community hold dear; that is, an environ
ment in which we all can choose our values,
whether they be religious, political, academic
or even sexual. The worst thing about this is
the involuntary, forced nature of this dismast
ing act. The utter perversity of this incident
absolutely appalls me."
Although the university official wouldn't
comment on his relationship with the suspect,
he mentioned that his behavior wasn't "entire
ly out of the ordinary." In a press release, the
University said Green Library will step up
security to level 10, meaning that students and
others with University affiliation will not only
be subject to book bag searches, but may have

to submit to a strip search to ensure the pres
ence of under garments.
Off the record, the University official
revealed that the man would desist from
streaking only if The Daily would agree to print
his manifesto in full. The 50-page document
extols the virtues of sexual perversion, while
denouncing the mainstream media's "arbi
trary rejection of fringe sexual practices that
are only perverted if you think they are."
A Daily spokesman commented that the
paper cannot be taken hostage for such an
innocuous act. "That guy is going to have to do
something a whole lot more offensive for us to
even consider printing his manifesto."
The Daily is apparently receiving intense
pressure from the University, again under the
guidance of the director of New Student Orien
tation, to print the manifesto not only because
"it might persuade the man to stop his pornog
raphy crusade, but also because the man has a
First Amendment right to have his views
heard, regardless of how offensive they may
be."
