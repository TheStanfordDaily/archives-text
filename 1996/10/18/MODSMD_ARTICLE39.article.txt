The Stanford Cardinal were once again beaten, this
time by a group of laboratory monkeys let loose on the
field by an unknown prankster. The final score of 35-
2 has ignited a flurry of gossip about whether head
coach Tyrone Willingham will return after this sea
son.
"We had an excellent opportunity to get a great
start against a good bunch of lab monkeys,' Willing
ham said. "I'm not sure what went wrong; our guys
just were not executing."

Things started off horribly for the Cardinal and
then got much worse. A lab monkey returned the
opening kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown. "That
monkey flew," said special teams player Jeff Byrd.
"I went to knock the ball out his hand and he just
jumped right over me." Then on the Cardinal
opening possession quarterback Chad Hutchinson
was picked off. The lab monkeys capitalized imme
diately, hitting an unidentified player running a
post pattern in the end zone for six.
After the game the laboratory animals fled the
field when the regular KZSU programming began to
air over the loud speakers.


14-17, 285 yards, 3 TDs.
