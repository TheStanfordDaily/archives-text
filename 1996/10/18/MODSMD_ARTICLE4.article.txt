# Permit parking instituted on Row
## 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
The last island of free student
parking on campus was eliminated
yesterday: Residents on the Row
will now be required to purchase
permits to park on several key
streets.
Mayfield Avenue, Constanzo
Street and San Juan are now zoned
for SH permit parking. Students
will have to pay the regular $70 an
nual fee for the permit.
The SH zone also covers a sub
stantial area outside of Campus
Drive, including Alvarado Row and
Santa Ynez Street.
According to Patrick Siegman,
an analyst at Transportation Pro
grams, about 250 to 300 additional

people will now need permits. He es
timated, however, that about half of
the students affected had already
applied for the permit.
Previously, the only residences
in the SH zone were Chi Theta Chi
and Hammarskjold House. Until
the recent change, Siegman said,
residents of those two houses did
not require permits for their park
ing lots and were given free permits
for street parking in the area.
Siegman said that students were
informed of the changes last spring
and that Transportation Programs
had intended to begin enforcing the
permit zone Sept. 1. However, the
date was pushed back to allow more
time to put up signs.
He added that not all signs were
in place but that they would be with
in the next nine days, at which point
ticketing will begin.
Jeffrey Tumlin, program manag
er at Transportation Programs, said
"equity reasons" were behind the
move. He noted that no other resi
dences have free parking and that
the move "brings the outer Row
houses to where they're now the
same" as other student housing.
Residents of the Row houses
should find more available parking
now, Siegman added.
"We're just doing it to ensure
that the people who have permits
actually have parking spaces," he
explained.
Another issue is preserving park
ing space for the faculty and staff

housing in the area
Siegman said faculty and staff
would continue to receive free per
mits because the cost of building
those houses included building the
streets. In effect, the residents have
already paid for the parking.
At the moment, the SH zone only
extends as far as San Juan. Siegman
said it is possible that people will
park further out in the neighbor
hood rather than buy permits. He
stressed that Transportation Pro
grams would not allow the faculty
neighborhoods to fill up with stu
dent parking.
"We're prepared to extend the
SH zone as far as it takes to get peo
ple to buy permits," he added.
Those Row houses affected by
the expansion of the SH zone are
Grove, Kairos, Delta Kappa Ep
silon, La Maison Haus
Mitteleuropa, Durand, Slavianskii
Dom, Theta Xi, Synergy, Roth and
Phi Sig.
