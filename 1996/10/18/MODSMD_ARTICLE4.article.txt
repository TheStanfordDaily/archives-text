# Permit parking instituted on Row
## 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
The last island of free student
parking on campus was eliminated
yesterday: Residents on the Row
will now be required to purchase
permits to park on several key
streets.
Mayfield Avenue, Constanzo
Street and San Juan are now zoned
for SH permit parking. Students
will have to pay the regular $70 an
nual fee for the permit.
The SH zone also covers a sub
stantial area outside of Campus
Drive, including Alvarado Row and
Santa Ynez Street.
According to Patrick Siegman,
an analyst at Transportation Pro
grams, about 250 to 300 additional

people will now need permits. He es
timated, however, that about half of
the students affected had already
applied for the permit.
Previously, the only residences
in the SH zone were Chi Theta Chi
and Hammarskjold House. Until
the recent change, Siegman said,
residents of those two houses did
not require permits for their park
ing lots and were given free permits
for street parking in the area.
Siegman said that students were
informed of the changes last spring
and that Transportation Programs
had intended to begin enforcing the
permit zone Sept. 1. However, the
date was pushed back to allow more
time to put up signs.
