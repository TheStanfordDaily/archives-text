# Civil charges dismissed against O.J. â€” riots ensue
## 
### Patrick Smith Editorial Staff 
Civil litigation against O.J. Simp
son, former Buffalo Bills running back
turned B-movie actor, was dismissed
unanimously this morning. By noon,
the city of Los Angeles erupted into an
urban brawl, pitting whites against
blacks, Chicanos against Asians and
visiting New Yorkers against anyone
within their reach.
The rioting began the moment the
verdict was announced live on televi
sion. The mayor of Los Angeles
declared a state of emergency and
called upon the White House for sup
port from the National Guard.
"It's hell, plain and simple," said
LaKesha Williams, an African Ameri
can at the scene. "This white dude hit
me upside the head with a portable
computer. He said it was my own
fault. Dude's crazy (sic)." Williams
was one of several hundred African
Americans attacked downtown.
Violence began when whites began
smashing downtown store windows
with cellular phones. The action esca
lated when the whites began loading
washing machines, hair dryers and
bottles of Jack Daniels into several

nearby U-Hauls. "This is nothing more
than a protest over the injustice we
have witnessed today" claimed Wen
dell Evergreen, an Anglo-Saxon spot
ted staggering away with a stolen Baxo*
phone and acoustic guitar. "This saxo
phone, this guitar, they are not for my
apartment; they are rather a symbol of
my personal struggle against affirma
tive action in the court room."
Police refused to intervene in the
scene, instead establishing a perime
ter around the urban brawl in an
attempt to contain the action. "It's
better we not get involved," said
LAPD Master Sgt. Paul Mummy. "We
don't want anyone thinking we single
out white folk for baton blows. Things
will die down when enough people are
dead or unconscious, and we'll be
ready to move in with the dogs and a
coroner."
Representatives of the state and
local government have yet to respond,
although President Clinton released a
statement: "We support their struggle
and are on their side, in this day of
struggle. We hope the struggle will
end, and we are for an end to the
struggle, so let us work together for a
peaceful solution in this moment of
struggle."
