### Jim Tankersley 
Saying that administration
fraternity relationships have
been estranged "for far too
long," President Gerhard
Casper announced yesterday
that he will donate his mansion
to the Delta Tau Delta fraterni
ty' ,
The move, a dramatic reversal
from recent administrative
trends that have seen several
fraternities lose their houses in
the past three years, was imme
diately hailed as a peace offering
by fraternity presidents campus
wide.
"Casper's actions can only be
seen as one thing: an olive
branch," the Delt president said
"We graciously accept the offer
and look forward to moving in
next year."
Casper's plan will transfer
possession of Hoover House to
the Delts effective next fall, he
said. In the meantime, he and
his wife Regina will do every
thing in their power to prepare
for the transition.
"Obviously, some house mod
ifications are going to need to be
made. We don't have a dart
board or any neon beer signs,
and I'm afraid to say that our
pool table is in terrible repair,"
she said.
The Delt brothers, too, will
start preparing for the move
immediately. "Once the initial
sensation of being back in a house
wears off, I think we'll find that
we have a lot of work to do, espe
cially from an interior decorating
standpoint. What works for a
presidential mansion doesn't
always carry over well into a frat
house," the Delt president said.
"The draperies can no longer
match the bed spreads and we
have special ordered an inflat
able, oscillating Chipmunk for
the terrace."
Ramifications of the move are
being felt not only by the Delts,

but throughout the entire Uni
versity Greek system. Immedi
ately after Casper's announce
ment, several frat presidents
reacted with glee. "This is a
great day," said the Interfrater
nity Council president, "both for
the fraternity system, for the
University and for the United
States of America. This certainly
represents a welcome change
and a good omen for things to
come."
The Theta Xi president
agreed. "I've always said that
President Casper looked impres
sive in tights, but a move like
this is unprecedented. I have to
hand it to him ... his timing
couldn't be better."
Only the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
president would go on record
with reservations about the
housing offer. He noted that the
transfer agreement allows for
the Delts to hold Rush week
activities in Hoover House.
"Assuming that they can get it
ready in time, that's going to
give them quite an advantage in
recruiting students easily
impressed by opulence," he said.
"That cuts deeply into our
pledge class."
Speculation arose immediate
ly after the press conference as
to where the Caspers will reside
next year. In an interview with
The Daily, Casper denied
rumors that he and his wife will
move off-campus or that the
University is at work building a
new presidential mansion.
Instead, he plans on entering the
Draw, he said.
Casper would not name his
top choice for the Draw, only
saying that he would prefer to
have an open kitchen "for those
late-night attacks of the
munchies."
"It's all random of course, so
speculation at this point is a bit
moot," Casper said. "Really, I
have no preference. I just don't
want to end up in Lag."
