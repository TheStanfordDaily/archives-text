# Health Services volunteers for early audit

Stanford Health Services has volunteered
to undergo a government audit to determine
whether its past Medicare billing practices
have conformed to federal regulations.
SHS requested to be an early participant in
the Physicians at Teaching Hospitals pro
gram, a federal government program aimed at
reviewing the Medicare billings of all academ
ic medical centers in the United States, SHS
President Peter Van Etten said.
The audit will use a sample of Medicare's
patient records and will be conducted by an in
dependent accounting firm.
The program was developed by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services to
ensure that Medicare billing is being done cor
rectly. One of the complexities of Medicare is
that there are many different billing proce
dures for services ranging from surgery to of
fice visits.
"It is mainly a paperwork issue," said Judy
Frabotta, a spokeswoman for SHS. "The area
of the most confusion is the supervision of res-

idents and how to bill for resi
dent and supervisory time."
A similar audit done two
years ago at the University of
Pennsylvania's medical cen
ter resulted in the school hav
ing to pay a $30 million settle
ment.
"There is an extensive set
of documentation for services
.. . and billing," Van Etten

said. "There were a number of instances (at
the University of Pennsylvania) where regu
lations were not followed."
Stanford requested an early audit to ad
dress issues similar to those raised at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania.
"The idea is to do a joint audit to see if there
are issues here like those raised at Penn," Van
Etten said. "We wanted to volunteer for the
audit sooner rather than later."
The audit will be done on files from the last
three to five years, since new regulations that
clarify billing procedures were put into effect
on July 1 of this year.

The auditing firm will "probably pull 100
charts at random," explained Van Etten.
"They will detect errors and use the sample
for an estimate. Then we will make a settle
ment."
Van Etten added that he could not estimate
how much the audit would cost the Universi
ty.
Although SHS had originally planned to
conduct its own review because of the new
regulations, officials decided it would be most
efficient to do the review in conjunction with
the government rather than undergoing two
separate audits.
No definite time period has been given for
the audit. However, the process has typically
taken between four and six months at other
universities.
"The principal goal is to expedite the [au
diting] process and get an answer as soon as
possible," Van Etten said. "If there are excep
tions at Stanford we want to come to an agree
ment with the government as soon as possi
ble. No one is questioning the quality of pa
tient care provided."
