# Foreign policy panel discusses arms race
## 
### Jim Tankersley 
A four-man panel of foreign pol
icy experts came to Annenberg Au
ditorium last night to debate nu
clear policy, all sounding a clear
theme. The Cold War is over, they
said, but nuclear weapons still
pose a great challenge to both the
United States and Russia.
The forum was sponsored by
Stanford's Institute for Interna
tional Studies.
The group, including of both
American and Russian scholars
and headlined by 1996-97 Payne
Distinguished Lecturer James
Goodby, responded to the question
of whether strategic partners can
be nuclear rivals. And while each

participant attacked the issue
from a slightly different stand
point, a common line ran through
the program.
All four men seemed to agree
that Russia and the United States,
no longer political enemies, are
still in a dangerous position in
terms of nuclear weapons.
"We are still locked in a strate
gic confrontation as a result of the
Cold War," said panelist John
Steinbruner, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution in Washing
ton, D.C. "Both sides are basically
preserving the capability to anni
hilate."
He echoed the sentiments of the
opening speaker Alexander
Yereskovsky, minister counselor
of the Russian embassy. "The po
litical pendulum has swung from
the Cold War to an unrealistic hope
of a strategic alliance to something
in between," Yereskovsky said.
Yereskovsky also set out the
idea of "mutually assured coopera
tion," a concept also touched on by
Nickolai Sokov, a fellow at the
Monterey Institute of Internation
al Studies.
"We cannot make nuclear
weapons obsolete, but we can make
warfare obsolete," Yereskovsky
said. "Cooperative deterrence is
one way to achieve that."
The first step in that coopera
tive direction, the panel discussed,
would be the ratification of the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
This treaty — between the United

States and Russia — requires both
countries to reduce their overall
strategic forces by 5,000 warheads
by the year 2003.
As part of his presentation,
Goodby — who once served as
President Clinton's chief negotia
tor for U.S.-Russian nuclear
weapons dismantlement — includ
ed an overhead-projector display.
He wrote, "Key to the whole effort
is entry into force of the START II
treaty and relaunching of U.S.-
Russian negotiations on strategic
arms control."
START II would be followed by
a time of uncertainty, said Goodby,
adding that there is no formal pro
posal that would go beyond the
treaty.
Instead, he foresees possible
problems worldwide if major disar
mament steps are not taken in the
next several years.
The global nuclear nonprolifer
ation treaty and comprehensive
test ban treaty will come up for re
view in the year 2000, which could

be reason for concern, according to
Goodby.
In addition, Pakistan and India
are close to becoming declared nu
clear states, China is on the verge
of making new missiles, and Rus
sia's systems will soon be ready to
be replaced.
The United States, for its part,
will be considering a missile de
fense system.
"I don't think it's an exaggera
tion to say that we may be in for a
global arms race," he said.
Steinbruner presented a five
point agenda for reducing that
threat.
His plan calls for a greater re
duction in the number of existing
weapons; the establishment of
comprehensive accounting of war
heads and materials; the termina
tion of alert or "quick-response"
procedures; termination of mass
targeting practices; and ending the
practice of explicit deterrence, or
pointing the majority of weapons
at one country.
