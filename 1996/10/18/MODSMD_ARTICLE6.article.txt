History Prof. Norman Naimark was honored yes
terday with the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit
— the highest decoration given by Germany — for
his work and research on German history.
Naimark was presented with the award by
Ruprecht Henatsch, consul general of Germany. The
order was issued by German President Roman Her
zog.
Naimark was recognized in particular for his work
on German history from 1945 to 1949, which focuses
on the Soviet occupation of East Germany.
The professor's 1995 book, "The Russians in Ger
many," is the "most comprehensive study of that pe
riod of German history," said Henatsch. Naimark is
"one of the leading interpreters of German history in
the United States."
Henatsch, who did graduate work at Stanford in
1963 and 1964, said he had "very vivid memories" of
Stanford. Naimark had just begun his Stanford ca
reer when Henatsch was a graduate student.
Naimark "has done so much in promoting acade
mic discourse on both sides of the Atlantic," said
Henatsch, citing the professor's work in promoting
student exchange between Germany and the United
States and the extensive research that Naimark has
done on Germany and Eastern Europe.
Naimark first became interested in Germany dur
ing his undergraduate years at Stanford. In 1964,
Naimark spent the fall quarter of his junior year at
Stanford's overseas program in Germany, which was
then located in Beutelsbach. The program moved to
Berlin in 1974.
Naimark has done a lot to promote Germany, said
Bob Hamrdla, who was the director of Stanford in
Germany when Naimark attended. "He is a very
civic-minded fellow," Hamrdla said.
Naimark went on to get his master's and doctoral
degrees in history from Stanford and became a pro
fessor here in 1988.
"It's an outstanding example of what a Stanford
graduate can become," said History Prof. Gordon
Chang, who attended the ceremony.
"The Soviet occupation is an important part of
[East German] history," Naimark said. "It's harder
for lEast Germans! to write it. It's so close that it's
harder for them to get perspective. Sometimes it's
easier if someone else comes from somewhere far
