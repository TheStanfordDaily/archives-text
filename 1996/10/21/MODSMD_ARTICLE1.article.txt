# AASA hosts statewide forum
## Conference urges Asian Americans to take action 
### Dan Wolk 
The voices of a group too often stereotyped
broke through the silence during a confer
ence on Asian-American issues Saturday.
In conjunction with the Asian American
Activities Center, the Asian American Stu
dents Association organized the statewide
"Listen to the Silence" conference with goals
of making voices heard and instilling a sense
of activism among Asian Americans.
The conference, which is in its second year,
ran all day at various locations on campus,
mostly centered around Braun Music Center.
The conference included speeches by promi
nent Asian-American officials, panel discus
sions, workshops and cultural performances.
About 150 people were expected to attend
the conference, including students from
other universities, said sophomore Jane Kim,
chair of AASA. Kim and others had been or
ganizing the conference since early June.
The program for the conference noted that
students representing the rest of California,
as well as Nevada, Texas, Kansas and Penn
sylvania were in attendance.
The conference was inaugurated last year
by coterminal student Gavin Funabiki, an
AASA member.
Instilling a sense of activism "is necessary
for our community and the community at
large," Kim said. "We have a goal of giving a
voice to everyone in attendance."
The conference's title, "Listen to the Si
lence," stems from a stereotype many hold of
Asian Americans — that they are not very
outspoken about their culture in the public
sphere, Kim said. The conference is supposed
to inspire people to listen to their own silence,
to define it and to substitute activism in its

place, she said.
The opening speaker for the conference
was Angela Oh, a graduate of the UC-Davis
law school, who has served as president of the
Korean American Bar Association of South
ern California. Oh spoke of the troubling
prejudices among members of the white com
munity and of the need for Asian Americans
and Pacific Islanders to speak out.
"If we don't speak out, do we expect the
world to be telepathic?" Oh asked. "We have
a responsibility to speak up."
Oh also discussed extensively the stereo
types she said white people hold about Asian

Americans and Pacific Islanders.
"In their minds, we are lumped together as
one," she said. "It doesn't matter what eth
nicity or generation."
Later in the conference, a panel discussed
Proposition 209, adivisive initiative that will,
if passed in November's election, halt prefer
ences on the basis of race or ethnicity, such as
affirmative action programs, in the public
sphere.
Involved in the discussion were Henry
Der of the state Department of Fducation;
