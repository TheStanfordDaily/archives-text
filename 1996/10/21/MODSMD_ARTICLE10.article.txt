Workers prepare to move a Delta Air Lines McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jet from the edge of a runway
at New York's LaGuardia Airport yesterday. All 58 passengers aboard the Saturday flight were evac
uated safely after the jet, bound from Atlanta, apparently lost part of its landing gear and then spun
180 degrees and slid off the runway.
