# Clinton proposes drug tests

WASHINGTON IAP) - In a
pre-election bid to polish his anti
drug credentials Saturday, Presi
dent Clinton proposed using the
loss of teen-agers' coveted driver's
licenses as a tool to curb youthful
drug use and drinking.
Clinton also suggested testing
for drug usage every teen-age
applicant for a driver's license,
with licenses denied to those who
fail. He said he would hope "the 90
percent who are drug-free" would
participate willingly in such a pro
gram to enable identification of
teens who use drugs.
Clinton declared a new "zero
tolerance" regulation for teen
drinking and said states that fail to
bar young people from drinking
and driving will lose a percentage
of their federal highway aid.
In his weekly radio address, the

president said he has a double-bar
reled message:
— "If you're under 21 and you
drink, you can't drive — period.
— "No drugs — or no driver's
license."
Clinton has been hammered
repeatedly by Republican presiden
tial candidate Bob Dole for presid
ing over a sharp increase in drug
use by young people.
In his address, Clinton said he is
directing the White House drug
policy chief, retired Army Gen.
Barry McCafTrey, and Transporta
tion Secretary Federico Pena to
develop within 90 days a plan
requiring that young people be
tested for drugs as a condition of
obtaining driver's licenses. He said
that might require new legislation.
And he said he would seek the
help of the vast majority of Ameri

can youth who don't use illegal
drugs to help identify and change
the habits of those who do.
In a memo to McCaffrey and
Pena, Clinton said the lure of a
driver's license is so compelling for
most young people that it can be
used to effect their behavior.
Clinton said he is convinced that
pulling the licenses of youthful
driver's who test positive for even a
tiny amount of alcohol in their
blood will be equally effective.
More than 2,200 young people
died in alcohol-related car crashes
last year, a number Clinton said
can be sharply reduced.
Under terms of the new regula
tion, he said, all states must now
pass new laws permitting suspen
sion of driver's licenses of people
under 21 who are found to be driv
ing after drinking.
