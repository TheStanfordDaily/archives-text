## Japanese ruling party makes historic comeback 
### 
TOKYO (AP) — The prime
minister's party won a parliamen
tary election yesterday on vows to
overhaul the bureaucracy that
dominates Japanese policy-mak
ing. But even as the results came
in, Ryutaro Hashimoto appeared
to back away from his promises.
Hashimoto's conservative
party captured almost half the
seats in Japan's lower house of
Parliament to secure a dominant
place in government.
The results of yesterday's elec
tion mean all but certain re-elec
tion for Hashimoto as prime min
ister and a return to glory for the
Liberal Democratic Party, which
governed Japan alone from 1955
to 1993, before falling amid a
series of corruption scandals.
Domestic issues were the focus
of the campaign, with every party
— from the Liberal Democrats to
the Communists — declaring it
was best qualified to overhaul the
bureaucracy, to reduce the power
of career bureaucrats and elimi
nate a morass of regulations criti
cized by Japanese and foreign
businesses alike.
The Liberal Democrats won
239 of the 500 seats in Parlia
ment's lower house, which choos

es the prime minister, the Japan
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
That's far better than their
previous strength of 206 seats.
But the party still lacks a major
ity in the upper house, which
was not being chosen yesterday,
so Hashimoto said his party
plans once again to govern in a
coalition.
He said the Liberal Democrats
will seek support from their cur
rent coalition partner, the Social
Democratic Party, which holds a
substantial bloc in the upper
house but won only 15 lower
house seats.
The No. 1 opposition New
Frontier Party took 156 seats,
while the liberal-leaning Demo
cratic Party won 52, both slightly
below their strength in the last
parliament. The Communist
Party took 26 seats, up from 15.
Voter turnout reached a record
low of just under 60 percent, down
from the 67 percent mark set dur
ing the last election in 1993.
The new parliament is expect
ed to convene at the end of this
month or in early November to
select the prime minister.
In foreign policy, the Liberal
Democrats' dominance means

continued support for the Japan-
U.S. security alliance. Hashimoto
also has been hawkish as a nego
tiator in trade disputes with the
United States.
Since the Liberal Democrats
lost power in 1993, three different
coalition governments and four
prime ministers have held power
in Japan.
