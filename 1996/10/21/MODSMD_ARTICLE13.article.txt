GM strike continues
TORONTO (AP) — Leaders of the Canadian
Auto Workers, whose strike has shut down all Gen
eral Motors operations in Canada, were pessimistic
yesterday that their differences with GM could be
resolved by a noon deadline today.
The CAW wants the automaker to follow the
example of Chrysler Canada by accepting limits on
outsourcing in order to protect union jobs. GM says
it needs more flexibility to remain competitive.
Overtime and work hours also are subjects of dis
pute. The union has said it will pull out of the talks,
at least temporarily, if today's deadline is not met.
The strike against GM began Oct. 2 and involves
more than 26,000 Canadian workers. Because of
disruption to the flow of parts, more than 7,400 GM
workers in the United States and Mexico have been
laid off, and more layoffs could occur today.
