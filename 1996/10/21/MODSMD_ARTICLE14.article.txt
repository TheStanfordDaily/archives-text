Widening Sand Hill Road
would improve economy
and lighten traffic flow

A CENTURY AGO, Sand Hill
Road was probably nothing
more than a nature trail,
winding its way through the pic
turesque foothills into Portola Val
ley.
Today, spectacular growth and
development in the area has pro
pelled Stanford and Palo Alto into
the ranks of America's most afflu
ent neighborhoods, yet Sand Hill
Road remains underdeveloped for
the demands of these growing
communities.
Plans to widen and expand the
road have been on the board for
more than a decade. However, a
small but determined group of
opponents has delayed the project
for just as long, saying essentially
they want to retain the rural
atmosphere of their communities.
The desire to preserve a more
small town feel waxes nostalgia to
the point of absurdity. One such
attempt to stymie growth for the
sake of keeping a few cars off the
streets was soundly defeated last
year, as voters rejected Measure R,
an anti-growth initiative meant to
curb "excessive" commercial
development in Palo Alto. Had
Measure R passed, it would have
halted further expansion of the
Medical Center and the Stanford
Shopping Center.
Still, opponents are again ask
ing the citizens of Stanford and
Palo Alto to sacrifice economic
growth and improved traffic flow.
In order to help finance the pro
ject, which is expected to cost $341
million, the University also plans
to expand the Stanford Shopping
Center by 12 percent, build a 630-
unit apartment complex and reno
vate the old children's hospital
into a senior citizens center.
Admittedly, the University and
Palo Alto stand to reap a consider
able income from the widening of

Sand Hill Road and the projects
designed to complement it. But
consider also the benefits for the
general public:
• Sand Hill currently dead ends
into a parking lot at the Stanford
Shopping Center. Anyone who
wants to get on to the El Camino
Real either has to negotiate the
parking lot or try making an illegal
turn onto University Avenue from
Arboretum Road. By widening the
road and connecting it to the El
Camino Real, traffic will actually
decrease in the residential neigh
borhoods of Menlo Park as drivers
will use Sand Hill Road instead to
get to the El Camino Real.
• Rental vacancy rates in Palo
Alto and Menlo Park stand at
about 1 percent. This past fall was
particularly harsh on graduate
students who not only faced an
incredibly tight market but rents
that were raised through the roof.
The additional apartments will
help those who now need to com
mute from as far as Sunnyvale to
study and work here.
• The marginal increase of mall
space — 12 percent — amounts to
the area currently occupied by
Macy's department store.
The arguments of losing open
space are also fallacious. If Stan
ford remained a bucolic regional
institution as it was a century ago,
it might have been possible to pre
serve the ideal opponents of growth
seem to envision. But the loss of the
open space, while regrettable, does
not mitigate the fact that this
entire area is bordered by the open
foothills, which dwarfs the targeted
Ohlone field thousands of times
over. Still, students should care
about the character of their campus
and voice their opinions.
The expansion of Sand Hill
Road is long overdue, and the
planned complementary develop
ments are well thought out. They
will not only provide funding for
the project but also measurable
economic development in the
years to come for the University
and the citizens of Menlo Park and
Palo Alto.
