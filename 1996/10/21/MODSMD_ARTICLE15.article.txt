Benefits of Sand Hill
development unclear,
losses are irrevocable

IN ANY DECISION about corpo
rate development, the company
always starts out with a distinct
advantage. A company has a clear aim,
plenty of money and a ready-made
hierarchical structure to implement its
policies. Individual citizens do not.
That is why grass-roots campaigns
to curb development always take
awhile to get rolling, and it is why they
appear in the press to be less coherent
than the corporate apologists.
Most grass-roots campaigns do not
have the resources to hire slick public
relations firms to promote their caus
es, nor do they have the power to buy
and sell elections.
Stanford Management Co., on the
other hand, acts as a classic big-money
developer in this sense, right up to the
$623,675 it pays its CEO.
And now, the company tells us that
the development of the Sand Hill Road
corridor is essential to raising rev
enues for the University. With all of
the support and resources of the Uni
versity administration behind it, the
company has proposed a massive
building program that will radically
change the character of the whole
northwest side of campus.
What's more, it foot the bill for the
environmental impact report that is
supposed to assess the consequences of
this development.
Hmm, maybe some people not
directly beholden to the company need
to take a look at this.
In fact, Stanford students, faculty
and staff ought to be up in arms about

the Sand Hill proposal. "Townies"
from Menlo Park and Palo Alto
shouldn't be left alone to defend Stan
ford's remaining open lands. They
could use the organizational skills and
support of a lot of students, not to
mention the public relations coup it
would generate. Where have you gone,
Nick Thompson?
There are always trade-offs in
development decisions; but the man
agement company, by virtue of its
power and prestige, has completely
dominated campus debate on the
topic. In fact, The Daily has yet to
receive a single letter this quarter
about the Sand Hill question. Given
the detailed exchange of opinions
going on in other local publications
about this issue, the silence of Stan
ford students, faculty and staff is a
sad, sad commentary on our commu
nity's civic skills.
This is, after all, our campus, and
we ought to actively protest when the
powers that be try to pave over some of
its most pleasant public spaces.
Does Stanford really need to sell out
its western flank? What are the tangi
ble benefits for students, faculty and
staff? After enduring seven years of
construction, what will the Stanford
community gain? It's just not clear.
We know, however, that we will
irrevocably lose the rural character of
west campus, that complete suburban
ization will have overrun our campus
and that a few major retailers will gain
new floor space in the mall.
A politically mature campus would
be debating this issue with passion,
and a university that paid more than
lip service to corporate responsibility
and ecological preservation would
squash this development proposal.
