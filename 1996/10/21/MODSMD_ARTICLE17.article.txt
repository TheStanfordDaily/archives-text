# Elliott Brown
## PEO means 'Piss Elliott Off' 
### 
For the united states to
function efficiently and have a
continually growing economy, all
working-aged men and women should
produce something. Some people, such as
carpenters, assembly line workers and
chemists, produce tangible goods. Oth
ers, such as travel agents, lawyers and
police officers provide useful services. In
fact, any employed person provides our
society with a product of their labor.
There is, however, one profession
whose members fail to provide any sort of
benevolent or useful service, whose sole
purpose in life is to deprive us of any lev
ity or money we may have. Of course, I'm
speaking of Parking Enforcement Offi
cers (PEOs). These forked-tongued pur
veyors of malice spend their days driving
around in battery-powered vehicles,
marking their territory with little yellow
fines in the name of "public safety."
Ah, yes, public safety. If it weren't for
parking cops, a dangerous system of par
allel and perpendicular parking might
emerge. Countless lives would be lost.
This anarchy would certainly be followed
by the apocalypse, damn double-parkers.
If PEOs sat at home, kicked their dogs
and collected welfare checks, society
would be better off than it is with their
"services." Let's face it, Adam Smith's
"invisible hand" would give these guys
the middle finger.
In an effort to find out what it takes to
become one of society's most useless
members, I called up my high school

guidance counselor. He was shocked by
my request for information about PEOs
— "I thought we decided you were gonna
go to college, Elliott." I eventually con
vinced him that the information was for
a troubled friend and he grudgingly
mailed me the application along with a
list of suicide hotlines, just in case.
The Parking Enforcement Officer
Application provided a lot of insight into
the psyche of your average PEO. Ques
tions such as "number of hooves" and
"do you now, or have you ever possessed
a soul" were telling, but I wanted to know
more about this rare breed. I was going to
fill out the application for fun, but I
failed to meet some of the basic require
ments such as "odd number of teeth." I
tried to arrange a ride-along with one of
Stanford's finest, but he refused so I
spent some, time trailing the Parking
Enforcement Cart on foot.
At first the PEO was withdrawn and
cautious, but he slowly became accus
tomed to my presence. After several
hours I attempted communication:
Me: How ya doin'?
PEO: All right I guess.
Me: So, uh, what are you doing for lunch?
PEO: Dunno.
Me: Gonna have some favre beans and a
nice chianti?
PEO: You mockin' me?
Me: Sorry, no, Officer Poncherello.
PEO: Listen, kid, I've heard that one
before. In fact I've heard 'em all before.
And don't even think for a second that

your present pedestrian status gives you
any sort of automotive anonymity. I
don't know who you are, but I know your
car. New Mexico, license plate number
194 GJF.
Me: But I'm parked legally — you have
no power over me.
PEO: Actually you're about 19 inches
from the curb. That's a class 2 infraction,
fella. And I can guarantee you that every
time you even think about parking in an
"A-Permit" spot for the rest of your life,
I'll be there waiting. Maybe you'll see me,
maybe you won't. Twenty-five dollars
every time, earthling.
Now, I consider myself to be a pretty
open-minded person. Thus, I would nor
mally accept any bizarre form of employ
ment as an alternative lifestyle, but the
PEOs are different. They have powers.
Coupled with their uniquely inefficient
place in our economy, these powers
should provide sufficient grounds to
remove PEOs from our dimension, not
just our parking lots.
I asked a friend in the ASSU Senate if
there was anything we can do to stop this
evil horde. His response? "Things are
tough all over. Write your congressman."
I'm there, dude.
