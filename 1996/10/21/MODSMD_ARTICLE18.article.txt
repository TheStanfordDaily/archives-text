Puritans beat businessmen

I DIDN'T DISAGREE with every
thing that Bruce Cannon Gibney
wrote in his letter last week criticiz
ing the "new Puritans" for interfering
with the free-flowing alcohol at a party
Gibney was enjoying.
Like Gibney, I do wonder why people
offended by drinking would show up at a
fraternity party. Also, I agree that our
mode of morality has changed for the
worse. Rather than ask: Is this consis
tent with what I believe?, we ask: Can I
find a way to justify complaining about
this, exonerating myself and assuring
my friends that I am just as righteous as
they had hoped? We treat morality as a
pastime rather than a pattern for shap
ing our lives.
I disagree with one of Gibney's last
points, the bit where Gibney tells the
new Puritans that "you'll find that flexi
bility and tolerance will get you further
than a diet of perpetual political correct
ness." I think that Mr. Gibney is recom
mending flexibility and tolerance as a
viable moral choice on the grounds that
they will get you further in the business
world.
Now, I suspect that Mr. Gibney's
description of the business world is accu
rate — tolerance of all sorts of values
will help you get ahead in business.
Why, just last week, I did unpleasant
business with the unscrupulous rogues
of a local car dealership. During my
visit, I witnessed a wide variety of val-

ues: honesty and trust working in har
mony with deceit and duplicity. And
business there is booming.
Even if Gibney is right through and
through, maybe the new Puritans are
shrewder than we had at first imagined.
Maybe they, like Gibney, are just trying
to contribute to the "campus' enjoy
ment" by calling the cops. I mean, what
excitement! Plashing lights (just like a
rave!), arguments between drunken
brothers and the local deputies! Maybe
some loose cannon is dynamic enough to
throw a beer bottle at a police cruiser.
Then the cops break out the tear gas
and Agent Orange to subdue the crowd
(and the Tree), and the school gets
national media coverage; you know, jum
bles up the U.S. News & Report rank
ings a bit.
On top of it all, the Puritans get men
tioned in The Daily, twice in one week —
what a great way for them to make their
mark at Stanford! Maybe we are the
ones who need to be more tolerant of
their offbeat merrymaking.
No, I don't think the current stan
dards of the business world make a
good substitute for morality, and until
someone can show me that the busi
ness world is something other than a
very large group of people trying to
screw each other, I side with the Puri
tans.
