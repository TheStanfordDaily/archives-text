# Calling all assassins
## Alternative career fair offers some options 
### Kelly Young Contributing writer 
It looked like the Stanford Career Faire
was making a repeat appearance in White
Plaza on Friday. But a second glance re
vealed a sign reading "Alternative Career
Fair" and a number of costumed students
canvassing the plaza.
"It's our satirical response to Stanford's
Career Faire, which is depressing," said senior
Adam Seelig, the event's organizer and "vil
lage idiot" recruiter. "Do what you want in life.
Don't limit yourself to a professional job."
About 20 Stanford students attempted to
recruit for such alternative careers as belly
dancer, face painter, nudist, clown, male
prostitute, prophet and messiah, assassin,
village idiot, hippie and candidate for An
dersen Insulting firm, a parody on Ander
sen Consulting.
"When people didn't quite cut it for God,
they were referred to the village idiot," Seel
ig joked. "It's self-mocking. We're basically
parodying everything and everyone. It is a
celebration and a calling for people to break

out of their shells."
"I think I cracked my shell," added grad
uate student Brandon Stafford, the Ander
sen Insulting recruiter, whose slogan was
"making tomorrow worse so today seems
better."
While it may all have seemed like fun and
games, Seelig and company attempted to
send a deeper message to the recruitees —
that the arts at Stanford are under corpo
rate pressure and creativity is dwindling.
Seelig said one of the fair's main goals
was "creativity over corporate rigidness and
a call for people to create, explore and con
tribute in a nonpractical way."
Planning for the Alternative Careers
Fair did not begin until last Monday.
According to Seelig, "this nebulous, un
official organization, [the Silly Society of
Stanford] sponsored the Alternative Ca
reers Fair. We're planning to hold more
events in the future. What they are, we
won't disclose just yet.
"The police even came for a little while,"
he added. "I think they had a problem with
the nudist recruiter."
