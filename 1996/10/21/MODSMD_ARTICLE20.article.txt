## Mark Zoback The 						C-15: Modifying Stanford's judicial system one step at a time 
### 
IN THE PAST two
weeks, two Daily
articles — an opin
ion piece by ASSU
President Bill Shen
and a Daily editorial —
have all appeared on
revisions of the Stan
ford's Legislative and

Judicial Charter now being considered
by the students, faculty and staff that
make up the Committee of 15. On
behalf of the committee, I want to take
a few minutes to describe what the com
mittee has been up to these past six
months and where we are headed.
The previous Daily articles have
already addressed many of the problems
that beset the current judicial system,
which has its origins in the turbulent
atmosphere that characterized campus
life in the late 19605. To understand the
direction the committee has been head
ing, it is important to understand some
of our primary objectives:
•To affirm the importance of the
Honor Code and Fundamental Standard
to the Stanford community.

•To restore to students the central
role in establishing judicial policy and
adjudicating cases, as envisioned when
the Honor Code was first established in
1921.
•To make education about the Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard a visi
ble part of campus life for students, fac
ulty and teaching assistants.
•To eliminate ambiguity and con
flicts of interest in the roles of those
participating injudicial affairs.
•To protect the rights of all individu
als while upholding the standards of
honesty and respect of the Stanford
community.
•To streamline the judicial process
and expedite cases, especially those in
which the facts of the case are not in
dispute.
The preliminary mechanisms the com
mittee has identified to accomplish these
objectives include the use of panels where
students make up a two-thirds majority
to adjudicate all cases and use of a stand
ing committee of students, faculty and
staff to set judicial policy. A draft of our
preliminary recommendations will be

presented to the ASSU Senate on Nov. 5
and the Faculty Senate on Nov. 7.
The committee welcomes comments
and criticisms. After considering the
feedback we get about our preliminary
proposals, the committee will present a
new judicial charter to the ASSU and
Faculty Senates and University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper for approval in
early 1997.
In the articles that have appeared in
The Daily recently, there has been con
siderable attention paid to the narrow
legalistic issue of the burden of proof
used to determine whether a violation
of the Honor Code or Fundamental
Standard has taken place. It is quite
clear that some students feel that low
ering the burden of proof from "beyond
a reasonable doubt" to "clear and con
vincing evidence" represents a severe
and unacceptable abridgment of stu
dents' rights. On the other hand, it is
equally clear that many in the Stanford
community, including students, believe
that "beyond a reasonable doubt" is
such an unreasonably high burden of
proof that those guilty of academic dis

honesty often go unpunished.
Although there are varied opinions
amonj; the members of the committee
about what the final standard should
be, we all believe that students should
be allowed the opportunity to decide the
issue of burden of proof.
Eighty years ago, students fought for
the right to conduct themselves under the
terms specified in the Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard. Stanford stu
dents today seem no less committed to the
ideals set forth in these two documents.
However, if the Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard are going to work, it is
both appropriate and necessary for stu
dents to decide how cases should be adju
dicated. From a practical perspective, it is
essential for all concerns! to know how
the majority of students feel about this
issue. There is simply no point for the
committee to propose a new judicial char
ter in January that will not be supported
by students.
The committee hopes that the ASSU
Senate will undertake consideration of
the burden of proof question as soon as
possible.

We look forward to the discussions
our recommendations will stimulate. It
has been clear since our very first meet
ings that the process of undertaking
revision of the judicial charter is a high
ly educational activity, both for the
members of the committee and for the
Stanford community as a whole.
It has also been clear from the outset
that we can only hope to be successful in
revising the charter if the process we
undertake is an open one, unencum
bered by allegiance to the current sys
tem or commitment to hidden agendas.
We started our activities by issuing an
open letter to students, faculty and staff
calling for comments and recommenda
tions from the entire community.
We strongly endorse the proposal in
the Daily editorial calling for campus
wide "town hall" meetings and dorm
talks to ensure the healthiest dialogue
possible on these important issues that
affect us all
