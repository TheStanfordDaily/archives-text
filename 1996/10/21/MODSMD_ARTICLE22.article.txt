## Water polo gets by Cal 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
Less than a week after vaulting to a No. 3
ranking, the Cardinal (12-3 overall, 3-1 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) faced fourth
ranked rival California on Saturday.
The Stanford men rose to the challenge, as
sophomore Crosby Grant and senior Daniel
Lehoczky exploded for seven of the team's 10
goals to sink Cal 10-9.
"Daniel had arguably the best game of his
career at Stanford," said head coach Dante
Dettamanti. "And Crosby kept us in it early in
the game."
Indeed he did, as Grant scored Stanford's
only goal of the first quarter when the Card
was slow to get started. Down 3-1 to com
mence the second quarter, Grant struck
again, pulling Stanford to within one, but
Cal's Jeff Moloughney answered with his
third point of the game to make it 4-2.
Then Lehoczky beat the Golden Bear goalie
with a quick shot to score the first of his four
points on the day. Senior holeman Brian
Wallin added a goal of his own to tie the game
4-4.
The Stanford team playing with newfound
fire, sophomore goalie Chris Aguilera stole
the ball on Cal's next possession and found
Lehoczky breaking for the goal.
With just a small edge on his defender,
Lehoczky didn't have time to simply pull up
and shoot. Instead, he spun around his
defender and put a brilliant shot into the cor
ner, surprising the Cal goalie and putting the
Card on top 5-4.
The crowd cheered wildly, energized by
Lehoczky's two amazing goals and the inten
sity with which the teams were playing.
"I love to play against Berkeley," Lehoczky
said. "I get fired up every time, and we had a
great crowd today."
Outscoring Cal 4-1 in the second quarter, it
looked like Stanford would keep the momen
tum and continue to dominate its archrival.
But it didn't prove to be that easy, as the
Golden Bears came out quickly in the second
half to score two quick goals and regain the
lead at 6-5.
Grant scored his third goal of the game to
tie the game at 6-6, but Cal answered again
with its seventh point on a 4-meter penalty
shot.
On the Card's next possession, redshirt
freshman Brian Heifferon found himself with
a mismatch on defense and made the most of
it, driving to the goal and finding the back of
the net to knot the game at 7-7.
Stanford looked to be pulling away as
Lehoczky and Wallin added goals early in the
final quarter, and took a three-goal lead on
Lehoczky's fourth goal which made the score
10-7.
With under 2 minutes remaining, Stanford
simply needed to stop the two-point shot and
run out the clock to claim a victory.
However, on a defensive mix-up Cal's Peter
Stern fired an open shot from two-point range
by Aguilera to pull Cal within one goal at 10-
9.
"The game was really in our hands," Detta
manti said. "We shouldn't have given up a
two-point shot."
Cal got a final possession, but Chris Aguil
era made an excellent save to give Stanford
the hard-fought victory.
"The team was psyched up," Lehoczky said.
"We were prepared both mentally and physi
cally for this one, and it paid off."
Indeed, with the exception of the mistake
late in the game, the Stanford defense played
perfectly, containing Cal standout Brent
Albright.
Albright, who will most likely be a member
of this year's national squad, could never
