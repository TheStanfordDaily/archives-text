# Football falls to weak Beaver squad

CORVALLIS, Ore. — The Streak is
over, and the Stanford Cardinal was
the unfortunate victim.
The Oregon State Beavers, winless
in their last 15 games and without a
conference victory in 706 days, gave the
raucous, hostile Homecoming crowd a
special treat — a stunning 26-12 victo
ry over Stanford.
No, this is not a typo. These are the
same Beavers who have not had a win
ning season since the Beatles broke up
and have not been to a bowl game since
Lyndon Johnson was president. The
same Beavers who had beaten the Car
dinal only three times in the last 26
years.
With the disappointing loss, Stan
ford dropped to 1-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference and 2-4 overall while also
seeing its bowl hopes fade into the
gloomy gray sky above Parker Stadium.
"In my opinion, this is the lowest
point we've been at since I've been the
coach," Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham said.
"It's disappointing because this was
an opportunity for us to put ourselves
right in the thick of things in this con
ference, and we squandered that oppor
tunity," Willingham said. "That's what
the loss and disappointment is."
The Stanford offense, looking like it
was finally stepping up after last week's
thrilling overtime victory, took a giant
step backward on Saturday. Three of
the first four drives ended in turnovers
while the Beavers turned into the
Doomsday Defense in the second half,
sacking Cardinal quarterback Chad
Hutchinson nine times over the final 30
minutes and holding him to 171 yards
passing. Out of the 73 Stanford offen
sive plays, 17 lost yardage, resulting in
only 198 net yards in total offense.
"I think things they did in their
defensive structure took us out of our

offense and never allowed us to get in
sync," Willingham said. "We had some
big plays, but we were never able to get
the rhythm and execution we needed to
be successful today."
Things started off poorly and only
got worse. Stanford elected to take the
opening kickoff in the hopes of putting
away the Beavers early. Instead, it
breathed life into Oregon State's
already hopeless season. After three

plays gained 17 yards to the Stanford
48-yard line, Hutchinson foreshadowed
things to come by floating a pass on the
right sideline into the hands of sopho
more cornerback Andrae Holland at
the Oregon State 47.
The Beavers wasted little time, run
ning the ball on five straight plays in
under 2 minutes, capped off by a 20-
yard touchdown run by sophomore tail
back DeShawn Williams. Although

junior place-kicker Randy Lund
shanked the point aft'T. Oregon State
held a stunning 6-0 1 id with 11 min
utes, 52 seconds left i.he first quarter.
While it was by no means an insur
mountable deficit, th" Cardinal offense
could not over com' 't early. As the
opening frame drew to a close, Stanford
had gained 29 total vards. averaged 1.5

the Stanford D could not hold off the Beavers.
yards a play and turned the ball
over three times. Clearly, the
doubt was creeping in on the Car
dinal sideline while the Beavers
were starting to rise to the occa
sion.
"We didn't obviously [focus on
OSU] today," Willingham said. "I
don't think we played with same
emotion or the same 'get alter it'
early that we had in weeks past. I
look at it as Tyrone Willingham did
not do his job to make sure his
team was ready."
Less than a minute into the sec
ond quarter, however, that emo
tion seemed to have come out as
Mitchell took a swing pass from
Hutchinson and ran down the
right sideline for an electrifying 57-
yard scoring scamper (his career
long play from scrimmage). Junior
Kevin Miller's extra point put
Stanford up 7-6 and it looked like
Stanford would be on its way.
However, in a rare showing of
moxie, the Beavers answered,
putting together a methodical 10-
play drive aided by absence of tack
ling. Oregon State worked the ball
down to the Cardinal 3 before
freshman quarterback David
Moran, finding no receivers, scam
pered around right end untouched
to put his team up 12-7.
The ensuing two-point attempt
produced the most bizarre play in
an already surreal day. Moran
tried to force a pass into the right
flat, where sophomore free safety
Tim Smith was eagerly awaiting.
One hundred yards the other way
later, Stanford had pulled within
12-9, 5:12 into the second quarter.
After an exchange of punts,
Stanford got the ball back in terrif
ic field position at the Beaver 23-
yard line with 3:55 left in the half.
The way the Cardinal defense was
starting to stuff OSU's wishbone
attack, this looked like a golden
opportunity for Stanford to march
down the shortened field and
silence the increasingly hostile
Parker Stadium crowd.
It didn't quite work out that
way.
A Mitchell run lost 2 yards,
Hutchinson's pass for senior
Andre Kirwan was overthrown out

of bounds and redshirt freshman
Troy Walters took a screen pass 6
yards to the Oregon State 19. This
forced Stanford to settle for a 36-
yard field goal attempt. While
Miller's straight and true attempt
knotted matters at 12-12, it defi
nitely was not what the Card had
in mind.
But with 2:28 left in the half,
surely Oregon State's inept offense
could not possibly work a two
minute drill to push ahead before
halflime? No, it took only a minute
and three plays to hit paydirt.
Senior tailback Akili King took
the ball up the middle for 20 yards,
followed by a broken play that
resulted in the Beaver quarterback
stumbling and bumbling his way to
a 21-yard scramble all the way
down to the Stanford 17. Williams
did the rest, taking Moran's toss
into the end zone.
With only a minute and change
to go prior to the half, the Stanford
offense put together its most effec
tive drive of the game. Hutchinson
found Kirwan and senior tight end
Greg Clark for 12 and 13 yards,
respectively, and was also aided by
a 15-yard roughing the passer
penalty. A few plays later, the Car
dinal was at the Beaver 6 for what,
at worst, was a short field goal
attempt. But on the next-to-last
play of the half, defensive end Tony
Huot jarred the ball loose from
Hutchinson. Brian Rogers recov
ered and Moran kneeled to merci
fully end an embarrassing half.
The second half provided a glim
mer of hope for the Cardinal in the
name of Mike Mitchell. On Stan
ford's second possession of the
third quarter, the senior running
back took a third-down handoff,
slipped three tackles and took off
for a career-long 56-yard run
before being dragged down from
behind at the Beaver 21. But
Hutchinson was blindsided on the
ensuing third down and Miller
missed a 42-yard field goal, ending
the Cardinal's best scoring chance
of the half.
The final quarter only delayed
the ugly inevitable. With each
quarterback sack, the crowd only
grew more hostile and the Cardinal
more befuddled. Simply put, Stan
ford was in dead retreat. Seven
offensive plays lost 52 yards in the
final quarter.
Beaver senior fullback Darron

Kirkman's 28-yard touchdown run
through the fallen Cardinal with
3:22 left, was only the final nail in
the coffin. As the clock ticked down
to zero and fans stormed the field,
the final result was all too real:
Oregon State had won.
"It definitely felt like one we
could have had and we're just very
disappointed," said Mitchell, who
led the team with 143 yards of total
offense. "We just didn't execute.
We never corrected four mistakes].
It's the past now. This disappoint
ment will just get us more fired up
for ASU next week."
Hutchinson, who kept his post
game comments to a minimum,
ended the day 17-of-34 passing
while getting sacked 11 times.
However, Willingham believes that
his performance was not due to
inexperience.
"When you are pursued and
rushed that much, I don't think
you can evaluate experience that
much," Willingham said. "Our
quarterback today was under
heavy pressure. Heavy pressure
cost him all day."
When asked what was the most
disheartening item of this day,
Willingham summed it up quickly.
"There was nothing that I could
draw that was even the most disap
pointing outside of just flat losing,"
Willingham said. "That's what it's
all about."

Senior running back Mike Mitchell bursts through the line for a big gain earlier this year. Mitchell's 56-
yard carry was the Card's only big run against Oregon State.
