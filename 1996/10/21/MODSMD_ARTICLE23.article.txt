# Football falls to weak Beaver squad

CORVALLIS, Ore. — The Streak is
over, and the Stanford Cardinal was
the unfortunate victim.
The Oregon State Beavers, winless
in their last 15 games and without a
conference victory in 706 days, gave the
raucous, hostile Homecoming crowd a
special treat — a stunning 26-12 victo
ry over Stanford.
No, this is not a typo. These are the
same Beavers who have not had a win
ning season since the Beatles broke up
and have not been to a bowl game since
Lyndon Johnson was president. The
same Beavers who had beaten the Car
dinal only three times in the last 26
years.
With the disappointing loss, Stan
ford dropped to 1-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference and 2-4 overall while also
seeing its bowl hopes fade into the
gloomy gray sky above Parker Stadium.
"In my opinion, this is the lowest
point we've been at since I've been the
coach," Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham said.
"It's disappointing because this was
an opportunity for us to put ourselves
right in the thick of things in this con
ference, and we squandered that oppor
tunity," Willingham said. "That's what
the loss and disappointment is."
The Stanford offense, looking like it
was finally stepping up after last week's
thrilling overtime victory, took a giant
step backward on Saturday. Three of
the first four drives ended in turnovers
while the Beavers turned into the
Doomsday Defense in the second half,
sacking Cardinal quarterback Chad
Hutchinson nine times over the final 30
minutes and holding him to 171 yards
passing. Out of the 73 Stanford offen
sive plays, 17 lost yardage, resulting in
only 198 net yards in total offense.
"I think things they did in their
defensive structure took us out of our

offense and never allowed us to get in
sync," Willingham said. "We had some
big plays, but we were never able to get
the rhythm and execution we needed to
be successful today."
Things started off poorly and only
got worse. Stanford elected to take the
opening kickoff in the hopes of putting
away the Beavers early. Instead, it
breathed life into Oregon State's
already hopeless season. After three

plays gained 17 yards to the Stanford
48-yard line, Hutchinson foreshadowed
things to come by floating a pass on the
right sideline into the hands of sopho
more cornerback Andrae Holland at
the Oregon State 47.
The Beavers wasted little time, run
ning the ball on five straight plays in
under 2 minutes, capped off by a 20-
yard touchdown run by sophomore tail
back DeShawn Williams. Although

junior place-kicker Randy Lund
shanked the point aft'T. Oregon State
held a stunning 6-0 1 id with 11 min
utes, 52 seconds left i.he first quarter.
While it was by no means an insur
mountable deficit, th" Cardinal offense
could not over com' 't early. As the
opening frame drew to a close, Stanford
had gained 29 total vards. averaged 1.5


Sophomore inside linebacker Sharcus Steen and a host of Cardinal defenders upended Oregon last weekend, but
the Stanford D could not hold off the Beavers.
