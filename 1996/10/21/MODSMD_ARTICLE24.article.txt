Some things just never seem to
change.
The Stanford women's volleyball team
(16-1, 9-0 Pacific 10 Conference) contin
ued its winning ways by defeating both
USC and UCLA this weekend at Maples
Pavilion. The third-ranked Cardinal has
won 41 consecutive matches on the Farm.
Against No. 12 USC, Stanford jumped
all over the Women of Troy, defeating
them handily in the first game by a score
of 15-6. But USC roared back, taking the
second game from the Card behind stel
lar play from sophomore outside hitter
Jennifer Kessy and junior outside hitter
Jasmina Marinkovic. Although the
Women of Troy hit only .241, the Card
played even worse, hitting a paltry .186.
USC prevailed 15-11.
The Women of Troy then jumped out
to a 13-8 lead in the third, but the Card
would not fold. Behind excellent play
from freshman outside hitter Kerri
Walsh and senior middle blocker Eileen
Murfee, Stanford stormed back, scoring
eight of the game's final nine points
while fending off five game points en
route to a 16-14 win.
In the fourth game, the Cardinal

attack continued its momentum, as
Walsh helped serve the Card to a 9-4 lead
and an easy 15-6 Stanford victory.
"It's really hard to play against Pac-10
teams day in and day out," Murfee said.
"We played really well, but we have to
work on being more consistent."
Walsh and junior outside hitter
Kristin Folkl led the Cardinal with 18
kills, while Murfee added 16 kills while
hitting .367.
Before a packed house in Maples
Pavilion, the Cardinal then faced No. 17
UCLA, the last team to triumph over
Stanford on the Farm. The fired-up
crowd provided an emotional spark for
the Cardinal and demonstrated one rea
son why Stanford plays so well at home.
"The crowd was great," said junior
setter Lisa Sharpley. "They do a lot to
keep us going. We love playing in
Maples."
Game one began with the two squads
trading points, as both the Card and the
Bruins provided an excellent display of
defense. However, the Stanford firing
squad started to heat up, as Stanford
began to prove its hitting prowess.

the Bruin blockers.
But the Bruins worked their
way back, and eventually took a
commanding 14-8 lead. Excellent
blocking by the Bruin front line
and the hitting of junior outside
hitters Kara Milling and Tanisha
Larkin helped the Bruin surge.
Costly service errors haunted
the Card, as Folkl, Sharpley and
Walsh committed mistakes.
Stanford fought back but fell
short, losing 15-10.
The Card rebounded in game
two, jumping out to an 8-2 lead
after Murfee and junior middle
block I '* Barbara Ifejika led the
chaise. Ifejika and Walsh also
helped create a nearly impene
trable Cardinal wall, repeatedly
stuffing the UCLA hitters and
disposing of the Bruins 15-8.
In the third game, the Card
continued where it left off, gain
ing an early 6-2 lead behind the
hitting and blocking of Walsh.
But UCLA responded, scoring

four consecutive points and
tying the match at 6-6.
The Bruins continued their
hot streak, moving out to a 10-6
lead. But then Walsh took over.
The Cardinal freshman provided
a key block, sparking a Cardinal
rally that included two kills from
Folkl and started the Cardinal
comeback. Walsh then stuffed
three more Bruin hitters, giving
the Cardinal a 14-11 lead. Grego
ry then finished the Bruins off,
slamming the ball through for a
15-12 Cardinal victory.
"It was really exciting to play
tonight," Walsh said. "I was fired
up."
Game four provided for some
dynamic action, as the two teams
seesawed back and fourth. Mur
fee, Walsh and Ifejika continued
to fuel the Cardinal offense, as
Stanford gained an 8-4 advan
tage. The Card finally won 15-7
as Gregory provided the match
winning kill.
"I think we worked really
hard," Gregory said. "It is a long
rivalry. Every team we play
against is really ready. Nothing
is ever given to us."
