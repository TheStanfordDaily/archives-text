Some things just never seem to
change.
The Stanford women's volleyball team
(16-1, 9-0 Pacific 10 Conference) contin
ued its winning ways by defeating both
USC and UCLA this weekend at Maples
Pavilion. The third-ranked Cardinal has
won 41 consecutive matches on the Farm.
Against No. 12 USC, Stanford jumped
all over the Women of Troy, defeating
them handily in the first game by a score
of 15-6. But USC roared back, taking the
second game from the Card behind stel
lar play from sophomore outside hitter
Jennifer Kessy and junior outside hitter
Jasmina Marinkovic. Although the
Women of Troy hit only .241, the Card
played even worse, hitting a paltry .186.
USC prevailed 15-11.
The Women of Troy then jumped out
to a 13-8 lead in the third, but the Card
would not fold. Behind excellent play
from freshman outside hitter Kerri
Walsh and senior middle blocker Eileen
Murfee, Stanford stormed back, scoring
eight of the game's final nine points
while fending off five game points en
route to a 16-14 win.
In the fourth game, the Cardinal

attack continued its momentum, as
Walsh helped serve the Card to a 9-4 lead
and an easy 15-6 Stanford victory.
"It's really hard to play against Pac-10
teams day in and day out," Murfee said.
"We played really well, but we have to
work on being more consistent."
Walsh and junior outside hitter
Kristin Folkl led the Cardinal with 18
kills, while Murfee added 16 kills while
hitting .367.
Before a packed house in Maples
Pavilion, the Cardinal then faced No. 17
UCLA, the last team to triumph over
Stanford on the Farm. The fired-up
crowd provided an emotional spark for
the Cardinal and demonstrated one rea
son why Stanford plays so well at home.
"The crowd was great," said junior
setter Lisa Sharpley. "They do a lot to
keep us going. We love playing in
Maples."
Game one began with the two squads
trading points, as both the Card and the
Bruins provided an excellent display of
defense. However, the Stanford firing
squad started to heat up, as Stanford
began to prove its hitting prowess.
