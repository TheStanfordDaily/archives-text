# Soccer dominates competition but comes away winless again
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
It was the same old story Fri
day afternoon at Maloney Field.
The Cardinal women's soccer
team once again outplayed its
opponent for most of the game,
but when the final buzzer sound
ed, it was another loss for the
frustrated Stanford squad.
San Diego handed the Cardi
nal this most recent disappoint
ing defeat 1-0. The loss drops
Stanford's record to an even 7-7.
"It's very frustrating," said
freshman Ronnie Fair, who
started at sweeper Friday.
"We've been getting opportuni
ties, but we can't finish them.
For the last few games we've
been outplaying our opponents,
and we should be winning. I
think we're losing our confi
dence."
The 20th-ranked Toreros won
with the same style of play that
they have capitalized on all sea
son — good solid defense and
occasional counterattacks.
With 28 minutes left in the
game, San Diego sophomore
Aimee Wagstaff scored the only

goal. Vanessa Thiele, a freshman
midfielder, fired a shot at the
Stanford net, and sophomore

Cardinal keeper Erin Bryla made
a diving save but was unable to
control the ball. The ball
bounced right to Wagstaff, and
the substitute forward pushed it
into the vacant right corner of
the cage.
That was all the Toreros
would need as Allison Worden,
San Diego's senior goalkeeper,
was as brilliant Friday as she has
been all season. The goalie has
allowed only seven goals in her
12 starts and came up with four
big saves to preserve the shutout
win for her team.

Stanford had a number of
good opportunities but, as has
been the case all too often this
season, couldn't finish. This was
the Cardinal's third consecutive
shutout loss — Stanford dropped
games to No. 1 Notre Dame 4-0
and Colorado College 2-0 — and
its fourth loss in five games.
Over that span, Stanford has
only managed one goal, a penalty
shot goal by Fair against Butler.
"It's definitely disappointing,
but you couldn't have a more
positive attitude as a team than
we do," said Fair. "We know we
can win games if we just figure
out a way to put it all together."
That is something coach Steve
Swanson will be focusing on in
preparation for two very impor
tant Pacific 10 Conference
games this weekend. Washing
ton State and Washington are
coming to the Farm on Friday
and Sunday.
Despite its recent troubles,
the Cardinal is still in first place
in the conference with a record
of 2-0. If Swanson's team can
win the Pac-10, it will reeeive an
automatic berth in the NCAA
tournament.
