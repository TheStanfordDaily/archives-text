# Wins keep coming
## Hockey has another perfect week 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The varsity field hockey
ground was the place to be this
weekend as the squad (12-1
overall, 6-1 Northern Pacific
Conference) marked its fourth
shutout of the season and put
on two more dominating victo
ries for the Cardinal audience of
fans, parents, students and the
Band.
Together with the gathered
crowd, the Stanford team
enjoyed a 9-0 win over Santa
Clara on Saturday and tri
umphed over the Southwest
Missouri State Bears in a 5-0
match yesterday.
"It was great seeing the
bleachers full," said sophomore
forward Monique Leroux, who
scored two goals against SMSI'.
"The Band was really enthusi
astic; it's great to see school
spirit. [The Band] shows we
have University support, and it
also shows (field hockey] is a
varsity sport."
The Cardinal rarely let the
ball cross over the center line
into its territory, as the squad

posted 26 shots and recorded
nine penalty corners to Mis
souri's two shots and five cor
ners.
Point-scorer Leroux initiated
the Cardinal line of fire less
than 5 minutes into the game
with a goal assisted by senior
tri-captain Amy Marfil.
Sophomore forward / mid
fielder Sarah Medeiros followed
by putting one into the net with
sophomore forward Carey
Cloyd's assist. Medeiros then
assisted 1/eroux on her second
goal of the game.
In the second half, Cloyd
immediately added the fourth
Cardinal goal assisted by Ler
oux. About a minute later,
freshman Mallory Chambers
followed suit with a goal assist
ed by Cloyd.
The Bears, who beat Stan
ford in a close match last sea
son. were expected to put on a
better showing.
"We thought (the SMSU
match] would be closer,"
Medeiros said. "Both games
were a lot easier than we are used
to, but we had a lot of energy"
going into them.
But coach Sheryl Johnson said
the squad has been playing "excep
tionally well" and the complete
domination by her players did not
come as a surprise to her.
The skill of the Stanford team
brought the fans to their feet as the
Stanford Band struck up an instru
mental storm led by the Tree.
The Cardinal fever not only
swept the Stanford bleachers but
crossed boundaries into the Bears'
bench.
"It was nice to have the Band,"
said Southwest Missouri State

coach Kathy De Angelis. "I liked
them a lot; [they] added fun and
excitement to the game. It was nice
that they came out here and
played, and it's great to see support
for the sport."
De Angelis added that the Stan
ford team has really come around
and showed a lot of improvement.
"Stanford is a nice little team,
very well-coached by Sheryl John
son," De Angelis said. "They really
stepped up. They are a very skilled
team, and they took control. They
really worked together, and we let
their skills frustrate us too much. I
think that's the reason they came
out on top."
According to Medeiros, the two
weekend matches allowed Cardinal
players to grasp a deeper under
standing of the squad and the
game. All five freshmen started in

the Santa Clara game, and mem
bers switched positions to play and
observe the game from a different
point of view than they are usually
accustomed.
"It was really good because it
gave [the freshmen] a chance to
play with each other," Medeiros
said. "It was also good practice to
work with different people."
Although the shutout wins over
club team Santa Clara and the out
of-region Missouri school do not
pad the Card's lead in the NorPac,
they further elevated the team's
confidence and energy level as it
gets ready to head east to play
prestigious teams there this week.
"It was good to get offense going
before we leave," Leroux said. "It's
nice to score so many goals; it gives
us confidence going east. We are
going to be leaving on a high."
