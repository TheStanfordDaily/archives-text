# Greeks help build houses
## 
### Kimone Gooden 
Sixty members of Stanford's Greek community
joined in a Habitat for Humanity effort to build two
new houses in East Oakland this weekend.
Thirty men representing five fraternities and 30
women representing five sororities worked at the
site from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on a variety of jobs,
including painting an entire house. The site is pro
jected to have 10 houses after work is completed.
Senior Mercedes Cisneros, the philanthropy
chair of the Delta Delta Delta sorority, said the work
was incredibly rewarding.
"I am extremely proud of the way the Greek com
munity turned out and participated," she said.
"It was a positive day filled with lots of fun," said
senior Craig Thomas, president of the Interfraterni
ty Council."It was good to see the fraternities unite.
Fraternities usually act as isolated units; they don't
usually come together."
Junior Lisa Rubin, president of the Intersorority
Council, felt that the members of the fraternities
and sororities interacted as if they were indeed a
community with no barriers.
"It was exciting and rewarding to see that hap
pen," she said.
Cisneros originally approached Rubin to initiate
the project as an all-sorority community service
event. Rubin then decided to make it a Greek com
munity service event.
Both Thomas and Rubin wanted sororities and

fraternities to work together for a common cause.
They recognized the need to encourage the commu
nity service aspect of the Greek community, so they
adopted Habitat for Humanity as the community
service project for this year.
The Greek leaders wanted to do a project that
changed the perception of members of the Greek
community at Stanford so they can be seen as
"scholars, leaders and community servants,"
Rubin said.
The Greek community will work on the site once
a quarter, although they are considering monthly
participation.
"Through cooperation with Habitat for Humani
ty, we will continue to create homes not only for our
selves but for others as well," Rubin explained.
Habitat for Humanity was founded by former
President Jimmy Carter. Its purpose is to locate and
build new homes for needy families, thereby com
bating poverty and homelessness. The organization
builds houses in inner-city neighborhoods to create
better housing for poor or homeless people. The
work is done entirely on a nonprofit basis.
The Greek community will be holding a block
party with local vendors and live bands this Friday
on Lasuen Mall to benefit Habitat for Humanity.
Proceeds will be used to make T-shirts, which will
then be sold in White Plaza the following week. All
proceeds from the sale of the T-shirts will be donat
ed to Habitat for Humanity. Overall, the students
hope to raise $3,000.
