# Forming a new judicial process
## Student involvement debated 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
A committee of students, facul
ty and administrators is looking
for ways to restore student in
volvement in all aspects of the ju
dicial process as the Honor Code
and the Fundamental Standard
approach their 75th and 100 th an
niversaries, respectively.
"The Honor Code is the real
foundation of Stanford," said
Dean of Students Marc Wais. "It is
a symbol of community trust, re
spect and academic integrity"
The Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard dictate guide
lines of student behavior but also
emphasize the responsibility
which students ultimately have
over their behavior and their envi
ronment.
The Fundamental Standard
was described when it was written
as "a pioneer approach to student
conduct at a pioneer University"
and is supposed to dictate a moral
standard of behavior in the com
munity.
It reads simply, "Students at
Stanford are expected to show
both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the

rights of others as
is demanded of
good cit l/ens.
Failure to do this
will be sufficient
cause for removal
from the Univer
sity."
The Honor
Code was initiat
ed bv students in

1914 and was not formally adopt
ed bv the University until 1921.
The Honor Code at present is "es
sentially the application of the
Fundamental Standard to acade
mic matters," according to the
Stanford Bulletin.
The Honor Code calls on stu
dents not to give or receive unper
mitted aid in class work or exami
nations and also to make sure they
and others uphold the code. The
faculty is expected to "manifest its
confidence" in student honor by
avoiding "unusual and unreason
able' precautions against cheat
ing. For one, this means that there
is no proctoring of exams.
The Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard are formally in
terpreted by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, made up of


Zoback
students and faculty, which de
fines misconduct and penalties.
All students agree to abide by
the Honor Code and Fundamen
tal Standard upon accepting en
rollment at Stanford, but in the
past, this is where student in
volvement in the judicial process
has ended. Almost all recent vio
lations have been handled by
Wais and his office.
Increasing student involve
ment is one of the main goals of
the Committee of 15, a panel ap
pointed by University President
Gerhard Casper last March.
Casper cited an "urgent" need to
review the University's Legisla
tive and Judicial Charter because
the process had become lengthy
and bureaucratic.
The committee, which is made
up of six faculty members, three
members of the administration,
and six students, plans to make
the first major revision to the
Legislative and Judicial Charter
since its adoption in 1968.
"The Honor Code has a few
problems with its implementa
tion right now," said committee
member Howard Loo, a senior
and ASSU senator. "These prob
lems are first, that students lack
information about the workings
of the Honor Code, and second,
that students must have faith in
the Honor Code in order for it to
work.
"We're all here at Stanford,
and we're all trying to succeed,
but we should also strive for in
tegrity," Loo said.
Computer Science Teaching
Prof. Eric Roberts, another com
mittee member, said, "The sys
tem in place is no longer working.
Students don't feel ownership of
the process."
The committee plans to revise
the judicial process so that every

case must come before a panel
which would include students.
"The philosophy of the Honor
Code is that students are respon
sible for maintaining good order
on campus," Roberts said. "All vi
olations must come before a com
mittee with student members.
That's what it means to have stu
dent involvement."
When a possible violation of ei
ther the Honor Code or the Fun
damental Standard occurs, the
Legislative and Judicial Charter
dictates the process through
which the accused student is in
vestigated, charged and pun
ished.
Evidence against the accused
must be sufficient to meet the
burden of proof, part of the char
ter which states that the student
must be guilty "beyond a reason
able doubt."
If a charge is given, the ac
cused student has three options.
First, the student can agree
with the charge and opt to have
the case heard by the dean of stu
dents, who will give a penalty rec
ommendation. This is referred to
as the "dean's route."
The student can choose to con
test the facts of the charge, in
which case a fact-finding hearing
occurs, led by an outside attor
ney. The student also can contest
the charges on the basis that his
or her actions did not violate the
Honor Code or Fundamental
Standard.
When a charge is contested
for any reason, the Judicial
Council, which has student and
faculty members, hears the case
and gives a penalty recommen
dation.
Although there were 90 to 95
investigations of suspected viola
tions last year and 45 to 50 for
mal charges, the Judicial Council
never met.
Instead, every student
charged chose to go the "dean's
route."
Burden of proof is one of the

most controversial issues associ
ated with the Committee of 15.
There has been debate over
whether the burden of proof
should be lowered from "beyond
reasonable doubt" to "clear and
convincing evidence."
Any revisions made by the
Committee of 15 to the judicial
charter must be approved by the
ASSU Senate, the Faculty Senate
and Casper.
The last Committee of 15,
which met in 1991, failed to make
major revisions to the charter
after the ASSU refused to ap
prove the lowered burden of
proof.
The current committee is try
ing to avoid argument over the
burden of proof issue. "Too much
has been made of the burden of
proof," said Geophysics Prof.
Mark Zoback, chair of the cur
rent committee. "The burden of
proof is not the primary thing
we're trying to correct."
"Our biggest fear is that the
burden of proof will dominate"
the discussion, said Loo.
The committee currently
plans to ask the ASSU for a rec
ommendation on the burden of
proof and to ask for student input
on the issue.
Both the Committee of 15 and
Wais hope the deliberation this
year over the judicial charter will
create opportunities for students
to review legislative and judicial
policies and increase awareness
on campus of the Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard.
"Students have to understand
what's at stake here," said Wais.
"This affects every student at
every stage, from freshmen to
doctoral candidates."
Wais, who has been responsi
ble for hearing all violations since
last year, also feels that increased
student involvement is neces
sary. "I would welcome and hope
that there will be more student
involvement in the judicial
process," Wais said.
