# Forming a new judicial process
## Student involvement debated 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
A committee of students, facul
ty and administrators is looking
for ways to restore student in
volvement in all aspects of the ju
dicial process as the Honor Code
and the Fundamental Standard
approach their 75th and 100 th an
niversaries, respectively.
"The Honor Code is the real
foundation of Stanford," said
Dean of Students Marc Wais. "It is
a symbol of community trust, re
spect and academic integrity"
The Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard dictate guide
lines of student behavior but also
emphasize the responsibility
which students ultimately have
over their behavior and their envi
ronment.
The Fundamental Standard
was described when it was written
as "a pioneer approach to student
conduct at a pioneer University"
and is supposed to dictate a moral
standard of behavior in the com
munity.
It reads simply, "Students at
Stanford are expected to show
both within and without the Uni
versity such respect for order,
morality, personal honor and the

rights of others as
is demanded of
good cit l/ens.
Failure to do this
will be sufficient
cause for removal
from the Univer
sity."
The Honor
Code was initiat
ed bv students in

1914 and was not formally adopt
ed bv the University until 1921.
The Honor Code at present is "es
sentially the application of the
Fundamental Standard to acade
mic matters," according to the
Stanford Bulletin.
The Honor Code calls on stu
dents not to give or receive unper
mitted aid in class work or exami
nations and also to make sure they
and others uphold the code. The
faculty is expected to "manifest its
confidence" in student honor by
avoiding "unusual and unreason
able' precautions against cheat
ing. For one, this means that there
is no proctoring of exams.
The Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard are formally in
terpreted by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, made up of
