Despite concerns from some alumni about the
new format of the Stanford Magazine, this year's
magazine should be better than ever, according to

its editor, Bob Cohn.
A year and a half ago, Stanford
Magazine merged with the Uni
versity-run Stanford News Ser
vice, and News Service now con
tributes an insert, called Stanford
Today, to every issue. Another
major change is that the magazine
will now come out six times a year
instead of four.
The controversy concerns the
Class Notes section, which con-

Cohn

tains short personal news items from alumni. At
one point in the redesign of the magazine, Cohn
planned to limit each class column to 300 words in
stead of the previous 1,000 words.
In early October, Subodh Chandra, Class of '89,
circulated an e-mail protesting the change and
called it "non-customer-oriented bureaucratic de
cisionmaking."
Cohn defended the change noting that, given
the average length of a class column and the in
creased frequency of the magazine, the limit did
not amount to a substantial reduction.
The final format of the magazine revises the
limit to 700 words, which actually represents an in
crease in the total amount of space available for
Class Notes in a year.
Chandra applauded the change but added that
the magazine still needs to be more responsive to
its readers.

Another change that Cohn, who came to the
magazine in January, has made is to add Leland's
Journal, a light-fare news section.
Cohn has also made some adjustments in merg
ing Stanford Today smoothly into the Magazine's
format. "It's a whole new ballgame in trying to
make these two things work well together," Cohn
said.
Stanford Today, which did not exist before the
merger, is the fruit of University News Service ef
forts. It is really a magazine within a magazine, ac
cording to Alan Acosta, director of the News Ser
vice, who has been overseeing Stanford Today's
progress.
Acosta said Stanford Today's mission is "to
communicate to alumni what is going on at the
Farm since they graduated." This includes cover
ing student life and research, from profiles on stu
dents and athletes to Stanford's participation in
research.
Acosta's most recent contribution to the formula
is a section called The Learning Curve, designed to
report changes in education at Stanford. Both stu
dents and faculty contribute to reports on a new
class in every issue.
"In the first issues, there were articles about re
search and profiles of professors, but there wasn't
any section that focused on teaching and learn
ing," Acosta said. "I want to get more students in
the magazine because they are an important part
of the University."
Because Stanford Magazine now encompasses
two different magazines, with different editors, art
directors, and two essentially different missions,
the experiment has been to make them work to
gether as one magazine, Cohn said.
