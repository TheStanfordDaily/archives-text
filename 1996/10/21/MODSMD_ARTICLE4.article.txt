# Anesthesia study in progress
## New drugs on the way 
### Jen Graves Staff writer 
Computer scientists at Stanford
are cooperating with researchers to
try to create better drugs for anes
thesia after a recent study shed
light on what has until now been a
medical mystery.
Anesthesia Prof. Mervyn Maze, a
staff physician at the Veterans Af
fairs Palo Alto Health Care System,
headed the team of researchers, who
discovered a protein link in the brain
that connects to an anesthetic drug
In order to put the brain to sleep.
Seniors Kaveh Maghsoudi and
Jennie Ou, both biology majors,
worked with Maze and others to
perform the research.
Although anesthesia has been
used for almost 150 years, the med
ical community is still at a loss to
pin down exactly how it works.
Maze's study is one of the first
breakthroughs in determining how
and why anesthetic drugs function.
"We give anesthesia every
day," said Maze. "We are using an
act of faith most times that what
we're doing is going to work and
that the patient is going to wake

up afterwards."
Research was done with the drug
dexmedetomidine, or "dex." Maze's
group determined that dex works
by binding to a specific protein in
the brain called the alpha-2A adren
aline receptor
The discovery will be useful in
creating newer, more effective
drugs, Maze said.
While dex is activated by the
alpha-2A adrenaline receptor, it
also needlessly binds to other pro
teins, causing the side effects of
anesthesia. The nausea and groggi
ness often associated with anes
thetic drugs can be eliminated by
creating a drug which binds only to
the alpha-2A adrenaline receptor,
according to Maze.
"We could make compounds
that are more selective th in the
ones we have now, which, target
everything," said Maze. "Ideally,
we could put people to sleep and
wake them up at will."
In order to create th< se new
drugs, M i/i is working w h a ro
botics g: >up headed by Robotics
Laboratory Director Jean-Claude
Latombe that is using software to create a
three-dimensional version of the protein
molecule that binds to dex.

With this 3-D structure, the scientists
will be able to see the molecule more clear
ly. They can then try to figure out which
molecules will bind to it, and this will deter
mine which new anesthetic drugs will work
on the protein.
"It's the old lock-and-key idea," said
Maze. The computer scientists "under

stand how to map out structure, and they
can help us figure out exactly what will fit
into the protein."
According to Latombe, building the
structure will be complicated and could
take months, even years to perfect.
"After three or four months, we will
have some preliminary research and then

can go further," he said. "But this will be
the first case we address where the result is
not known. A binding site can be very com
plicated, but in this case, even an approxi
mate geometry will help to find new mole
cules which are more potent than the ones
which are now used."
The development of new anesthetic

drugs is still on the horizon, according to
Maze.
"It's a long way from saying we know
how anesthetics work," he said. "I wouldn't
describe this as earth-shattering, but it's a
step in the right direction. Instead of doing
the art of anesthesia, we'll be doing the sci
ence of anesthesia."
