# Anesthesia study in progress
## New drugs on the way

Computer scientists at Stanford
are cooperating with researchers to
try to create better drugs for anes
thesia after a recent study shed
light on what has until now been a
medical mystery.
Anesthesia Prof. Mervyn Maze, a
staff physician at the Veterans Af
fairs Palo Alto Health Care System,
headed the team of researchers, who
discovered a protein link in the brain
that connects to an anesthetic drug
In order to put the brain to sleep.
Seniors Kaveh Maghsoudi and
Jennie Ou, both biology majors,
worked with Maze and others to
perform the research.
Although anesthesia has been
used for almost 150 years, the med
ical community is still at a loss to
pin down exactly how it works.
Maze's study is one of the first
breakthroughs in determining how
and why anesthetic drugs function.
"We give anesthesia every
day," said Maze. "We are using an
act of faith most times that what
we're doing is going to work and
that the patient is going to wake

up afterwards."
Research was done with the drug
dexmedetomidine, or "dex." Maze's
group determined that dex works
by binding to a specific protein in
the brain called the alpha-2A adren
aline receptor
The discovery will be useful in
creating newer, more effective
drugs, Maze said.
While dex is activated by the
alpha-2A adrenaline receptor, it
also needlessly binds to other pro
teins, causing the side effects of
anesthesia. The nausea and groggi
ness often associated with anes
thetic drugs can be eliminated by
creating a drug which binds only to
the alpha-2A adrenaline receptor,
according to Maze.
"We could make compounds
that are more selective th in the
ones we have now, which, target
everything," said Maze. "Ideally,
we could put people to sleep and
wake them up at will."
