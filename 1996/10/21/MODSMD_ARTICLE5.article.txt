# Up close and personal with the men at the helm
## Beyond the mug shot: Bill Shen opens up 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
Whatever peo
ple think they
know about Bill
Shen, it probably
doesn't include
the fact that he
harbors a crush
on the actress
Gwyneth Pal
trow.
"I'm totally in

love with Gwyneth Paltrow,"
Shen said. "She seems like the
sweetest person. But I heard she
showers once a week, so I think the
fantasy would be better than the
reality."
Shen, who is the first student in
27 years to serve as a single presi
dent of the ASSU rather than as a
member of the Council of Presi

dents, claims he is just like any
other Stanford student, and, at
least on the romantic front, he ap
pears to be telling the truth.
"My friends always joke about
finding me a first lady, but it seems
unrealistic. [The ASSUI started
the year talking about winnable
battles, but that's not one of
them," he said.
"I've been accused of being
picky, and I can never work up the
nerve to ask anyone out. People
say, 'You spar with (University
President Gerhard) Casper on the
floor of the senate.' But when it
comes to this, I'm scared out of my
mind. I have the greatest fear of re
jection."
Generally, Shen is able to con
ceal his insecurities, perhaps even
too well â€” to some on campus, he
seems the quintessential slick.


Shen
schmoozy politician.
Yet Shen, a junior, said his in
volvement in student government
stems less from ambition than
from a personal sense of pride and
investment in his community.
When he came to Stanford, this
pride and investment was a natur
al extension of what he feels about
his hometown.
"I'm from Huntington Beach in
Southern California," he said.
"It's the official Surf City, USA. I
have that on a sticker on my car.
It's the proudest city in America.
God, I love home."
Shen also loves Stanford and
conveys his love in terms that
would make even the authors of
"Approaching Stanford" blush.
"I think we're the best univer
sity in the world with the most in
credible student body in the
world," he said. "We have
Olympians, future Nobel laure
ates in science, incredible artists.
We have a faculty that's top
notch.
"And it's all in this California
setting. You can't beat the weather.
"Stanford is a formula that
can't be recreated," he said.
"We're competitive, and yet we're
not cutthroat. We're laid-back,
and that fuels creative energy.
That's why I love this place, except
the post office."
Shen said he ran for ASSU pres
ident precisely because of this love.
"I realized this office was the
best way I could give back and im
prove a school I care very deeply
about," he said. "I don't want to
just pass through Stanford and get
my education. I want to feel like
I'm part of this university."
Among Shen's current goals are
addressing proposed changes to
the Legislative and Judicial Char
ter, promoting the "Voice Your
Choice" voter registration cam
paign and reinstituting the bonfire
for Big Game.
"I coordinate a lot of projects,"
Shen said. ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson "is the ambas
sador to the outside world. I'm
pushing for a lot of projects on
campus."
Not all of these projects have
proceeded smoothly for Shen. Last
week, The Daily reported that
Shen has committed to expendi
tures that exceed his annual alio

cation. Included in the expendi
tures are $3,000 worth of now-no
torious custom-made adhesive
notepads.
Last Thursday, The Daily's
comic strip, "Julie," featured Shen
harking, "I'd like 100,000 custom
made, red paper napkins embla
zoned with the ASSU logo and my
picture ASAP. $12,000 for a rush
job? Sure, I'm not paying for it."
In response, Shen stamped sev
eral napkins with the ASSU logo
and delivered them to The Daily of
fice. He attempted to stamp toilet
paper, which the cartoon also men
tioned, "but it bleeds," he said.
Despite his sense of humor re
garding the notepad incident,
Shen said he feels he was misrep
resented by The Daily, and he is
concerned about the damaging ef
fects of this alleged misrepresenta
tion.
"I didn't run for this office so
people would thank me for a job
well-done," he said. "I can live
without thanks. But at the same
time, it hurts.
"I'm not used to having stu
dents who I don't know write me e
mails saying I've let them down. I
can't stand it when someone
doesn't like me, especially when I
don't know who they are."
Shen said that despite the fact
he is always busy and needed, his
presidency is fundamentally
"lonely."
"I'm ultimately accountable.
Even if tons of people are in my of
fice, I feel pressure on me and just
me," he said. "No one else can un
derstand the pressure, and I don't
want anyone else to feel the pres
sure."
For Shen, who spends about
seven hours per day in the ASSU
office and receives about 50 phone
calls per day, pressure often takes
the form of missed meals. On a re
cent Friday, he had yet to eat any
thing by 3 p.m.
"I'm down to about one meal a
day and a midnight snack," he said.
"I invest so much in my work that I
get nervous, and I can't eat when
I'm nervous. I didn't eat the day
Ralph Nader came."
Additionally, for reasons of
time, Shen takes a reduced course
load. He will go to summer school
so that he can graduate on sched
ule.
The pressures of public service
are the reason "why a lot of politi
cians get sucked into corruption
and scandal," Shen said, and these
pressures are the same reason he is

unsure of whether he wants to pur
sue politics professionally.
"The job is so thankless and
lonely," he said. "You're constantly
scrutinized. Your life is what the
media portrays it to be because you
can't meet all your constituents
personally."
Fortunately for Shen, the disad
vantages of his position are miti
gated by the many benefits.
Most notable among these bene
fits is his vice president.
"Working with Nick has been
the biggest and most pleasant sur
prise of my working life thus far,"
he said. "We have such different
styles. We're educating each other.
Hopefully, he sees it the same way.
I was worried Nick would be turned
off by my style, but we're working
in tandem so well."
Other benefits of Shen's posi
tion include the various lessons
and skills he has acquired.
"I know how to manage a staff,"
he said. "I know how to manage my
time. I know how to lobby and ne
gotiate."
More tangibly, since starting
with the ASSU, Shen has met Pres
ident Clinton three times.
Although Shen had been in
volved in student government in
high school, he said working for the
ASSU as a freshman was consider
ably different. "There was a transi
tion between planning formals and
working on campus safety," he
said.
As a freshman, then-Senate As
sociate Shen and then-Senate Sec
retary Alane Murdock wrote a re
port on campus safety in which
they requested more campus tele
phones at the entrance of resi
dences, as well as a system of emer
gency blue light telephones.
With the recent installation of
the blue light telephones, said
Shen, "We got everything we asked
for. It was great. I think this phrase
is overused, but [working for the
ASSU offers the opportunity] to af
fect change."
When he is not affecting change,
Shen unwinds with his drawmates
in Adams, where he shares a one
room double.
"None of my drawmates are po
litical, and that keeps me sane," he
said. "I can go home, order pizza,
hang out. I don't always like to
hang out with ASSU people. I con
sider that my work, and I love my
work, but I love a lot of other
things."
Gwyneth Pal trow, are you lis
tening?
