# Up close and personal with the men at the helm
## Beyond the mug shot: Bill Shen opens up 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
Whatever peo
ple think they
know about Bill
Shen, it probably
doesn't include
the fact that he
harbors a crush
on the actress
Gwyneth Pal
trow.
"I'm totally in

love with Gwyneth Paltrow,"
Shen said. "She seems like the
sweetest person. But I heard she
showers once a week, so I think the
fantasy would be better than the
reality."
Shen, who is the first student in
27 years to serve as a single presi
dent of the ASSU rather than as a
member of the Council of Presi

dents, claims he is just like any
other Stanford student, and, at
least on the romantic front, he ap
pears to be telling the truth.
"My friends always joke about
finding me a first lady, but it seems
unrealistic. [The ASSUI started
the year talking about winnable
battles, but that's not one of
them," he said.
"I've been accused of being
picky, and I can never work up the
nerve to ask anyone out. People
say, 'You spar with (University
President Gerhard) Casper on the
floor of the senate.' But when it
comes to this, I'm scared out of my
mind. I have the greatest fear of re
jection."
Generally, Shen is able to con
ceal his insecurities, perhaps even
too well â€” to some on campus, he
seems the quintessential slick.
