Explaining the
extraordinary
scope of ASSU
Vice President
Nick Thompson's
interests and ac
tivities is easy for
Bill Shen. "I'm
firmly convinced
there is more than
one Nick Thomp-

son on this campus," Shen said.
"There might be two or three We
just haven't gotten them all in the
same room."
As ASSU President, Shen
shares an office with Thompson
the politician Other Nick Thomp
sons include the activist, the ath
lete, the scholar, the musician and
the writer.

Thompson himself is similarly
unfa/ed by his accomplishments
and, in fact, sees them as little more
than manifestations of his wish to
live in an engaged and responsible
way.
Thompson, who i.> a senior, said
he developed his holistic perspec
tive when he became involved with
the Student Environmental Action
Coalition as a freshman.
"You don't just work on turning
ofT the water, but you also work on
issues of social justice," he ex
plained.
Toward that end, Thompson
has been a member of SEAS, the
Stanford chapter of SEAC, and also
has tried to implement his political
beliefs in his personal life.
He is a vegetarian, and he moni
tors his consumption of products


Thompson
sold by corporations whose policies
he believes are reprehensible. For
example, he does not own a car, and
he does not drink Pepsi because of
PepsiCo's questionable actions in
Burma.
Thompson said he is discouraged
by students who think, "I can't do
anything because I can't do every
thing."
Actually, said Thompson, "You
can't boycott everything, but you
should boycott some things.
There's a direct connection be
tween you drinking Pepsi and this
horror in Burma."
Not surprisingly, the classes at
Stanford that Thompson said he
has most enjoyed have been the
ones "when I can tie in service stuff
with academic stuff."
By majoring in earth systems,
political science and economics,
Thompson has had ample opportu
nity to tie together homework and
real life.
The honors thesis which he is
working on focuses on the debate
among environmentalists over im
migration. "I'm asking, 'What does
"environmental" mean?'" Thomp
son said. "Is it just the trees, or is it
the trees and the people?"
Thompson's three fields of study
do not constitute a triple major, he
insists, because several classes in
political science and economics
overlap.
"It's two majors and a secondary
major," he said. "Saying it's a triple
major makes people feel really
weird. It's not really a triple major."
After graduation, Thompson
will utilize his non-triple-major by
working for the summer in Wash
ington, D.C., as a Truman Scholar.
Following the summer, he will go to
his family's farm in New Hamp
shire to read and write articles and
essays. He plans to return to school
eventually, probably for a doctor
ate.
This quarter, Thompson said he

is taking 18 units. Most of his class
es involve independent research,
which he can "do on my own time,
in the mornings and on weekends."
For the moment, however,
"work has been suspended" be
cause Thompson is spending 12 to
15 hours per day on one of the four
campaigns of his vice presidency:
the effort to abolish the annual col
lege rankings published by U.S.
News & World Report.
Thompson's other campaigns
are the creation of a socially re
sponsible endowment fund; the
creation of a comprehensive service
learning program; and the supervi
sion of the third-party presidential
series, which has entailed oversee
ing visits to campus by candidates
such as Ralph Nader.
With regard to the U.S. News
rankings, Thompson said he began
thinking about the issue when his
younger sister, a senior in high
school, was * ading the current re
port. Thompson's older sister, who
graduated last June from Yale Uni
versity, also has become involved in
the national campaign.
Thompson is spearheading the
campaign and has obtained sup
port from Truman Scholars at
other schools.
Thompson said that his parents,
who are divorced and who are both
professors, stand behind his ac
tivism.
In fact, genetics might even play
a role in the unusual amalgam of
Thompson's activist and personal
tendencies: His grandfather on his
father's side was a "wandering
preacher" on Native American
reservations, as well as a pacifist
who resisted World War 11, while
Thompson's grandfather on his
mother's side was Secretary of the
Navy.
Like his father, Thompson at
tended Phillips Academy Andover,
a boarding school in Andover,
Mass. Thompson's father also at
tended Stanford, and Thompson
said he is conscious of being a prod
uct of "upper middle class white
suburbia."
"I've had special opportunities,

and with that
comes special re
sponsibilities, be
cause a lot of the
problems are
coming from that
(upper middle
class) communi
ty," Thompson
said.
In at least one
way, however,
Thompson's up
bringing was not
stereotvpically
suburban: His fa
ther is gay.
"I like people
to know that be
cause, contrary
to common belief,
it's not the end of
the world for chil
dren to have gay
parents,"
Thompson said.
"Also, living with
him and the prej
udice against
him helped me
develop a little
bit of a social con
science."

Thompson began demonstrat
ing this social conscience as a se
nior at Andover. As part of an in
dependent project for which he re
ceived academic credit, Thompson
and a friend wrote a book about
high school environmentalism.
Andover also was the place
where Thompson first pursued
two other central interests: run
ning and playing guitar.
He became a member of the
cross country team as a sopho
more. "Running was my identi
ty," Thompson said. "It was the
first thing I'd ever been really
good at. I wasn't a really good stu
dent; I'd been cut from JV basket
ball."
Yet at the end of his freshman
year at Stanford, Thompson began
to question whether running had
any "overriding purpose." He said
he found himself wondering,
"What does one do when one real

izes one is a robot?"
In addition to being plagued by
such existential quandaries,
Thompson had the more prosaic
problems of an injury and hepati
tis; the combination of factors led
to his quitting cross country. Now,
he runs only about once every
other week with the Stanford
Mountain Running Team, "a coali
tion of burnt-out runners."
"We get up at 5 a.m., bike to a
mountain and run up the moun
tain," Thompson said.
Thompson expressed enthusi
asm for other modes of physical ex
ertion. "I've had some really fun
experiences climbing on buildings
at bizarre hours," he said.
Another of Thompson's enthu
siasms is the guitar.
"I've played since the beginning
of high school," he said. "At first, I
just sucked. I played in a Guns 'n'
Roses cover band." The summer

after his junior year at Andover,
Thompson attended guitar camp,
where he learned to play finger
style.
"I still can't read music and
don't know music theory and can't
play any songs off the radio," he
said.
Nonetheless, he has written
many acoustic songs, recorded an
album last April and gives perfor
mances to which "no one comes,"
every Thursday at noon in the
Stanford Bookstore.
Thompson's album, which is ti
tled "Red Weather" after a line in
a poem by Wallace Stevens, con
tains "non-traditional music,"
Thompson said. "A lot of my per
sonality comes out in it. It's ram
bling."
Thompson said he believes
"music is one of the coolest things
humans have ever done. It's deeply
personal and spiritual."

Thompson ha 3 also tried to ex
tend himself personally through
various on- and off-campus publi
cations.
As a sophomore, he was a found
ing editor of The Thinker, a leftist
journal, and he has worked as busi
ness manager for the Chaparral
and as a columnist for The Daily.
Recently, Thompson has had
writing published on a wider scale,
with an op-ed piece on school "lega
cies" printed in The Boston Globe
and another piece on U.S. News &
World Report forthcoming in The
Los Angeles Times.
As ASSU vice president, as in
his writing, Thompson has been
able to synthesize many of his in
terests. The position has been
much more pleasurable than he
anticipated, he said.
"I thought I was going to have to
deal with all this crap, but Bill
(Shen) deals with it."
Thompson and Shen's partner
ship came about in an unusual
way, according to Thompson.
"Originally, I thought I'd run
for president as a protest candi
date. But not that many people
were running, and I realized I
might win, and then I'd be
screwed."
Thompson approached Shen
about the possibility of running to
gether. During the campaign, they
identified themselves as the ulti
mate insider (because Shen has
been a member of the ASSU since
his freshman year) and the ulti
mate outsider (because Thompson
had never held a government posi
tion).
So far, Thompson and Shen
have nothing hut positive things to
say about one another.
Almost a month into the school
year, one of their most significant
disagreements has been over what
to serve Ralph Nader for dinner
when he spoke on campus.
Shen proposed taking Nader to
an upscale restaurant in Palo Alto.
Thompson had earthier ideas.
"I wanted to take him to Colum
bae. I thought, 'Why not cook him
up stir fry?' "
