Explaining the
extraordinary
scope of ASSU
Vice President
Nick Thompson's
interests and ac
tivities is easy for
Bill Shen. "I'm
firmly convinced
there is more than
one Nick Thomp-

son on this campus," Shen said.
"There might be two or three We
just haven't gotten them all in the
same room."
As ASSU President, Shen
shares an office with Thompson
the politician Other Nick Thomp
sons include the activist, the ath
lete, the scholar, the musician and
the writer.

Thompson himself is similarly
unfa/ed by his accomplishments
and, in fact, sees them as little more
than manifestations of his wish to
live in an engaged and responsible
way.
Thompson, who i.> a senior, said
he developed his holistic perspec
tive when he became involved with
the Student Environmental Action
Coalition as a freshman.
"You don't just work on turning
ofT the water, but you also work on
issues of social justice," he ex
plained.
Toward that end, Thompson
has been a member of SEAS, the
Stanford chapter of SEAC, and also
has tried to implement his political
beliefs in his personal life.
