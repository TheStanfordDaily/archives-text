FOR THE RECORD...
An article in yesterday's Daily incorrectly stated that Habitat for
Humanity was founded by former President Carter. In fact, Millard
Fuller established the organization; Carter has been an avid sup
porter and, as a public figure, has brought much attention to it.
An article in yesterday's Daily stated that the Asian American
Students Association's "Listen to the Silence" program was origi
nally created by coterminal student Gavin Funabiki. Liane Nomura
and Anoop Sinha, both Class of '96, also helped start the event.
An editorial in yesterday's Daily incorrectly stated that a driver
attempting to reach El Camino Real from Sand Hill Road could be
forced to make an illegal left turn from Arboretum Road onto
University Avenue. In fact, a left turn is legal at that intersection,
where the road is known as Palm Drive, not University Avenue.
