We've dressed Nathan in
downtown duds for his
deceptively casual dinner
appointment with the pro
moter / CEO/ recruiter
Slimy Jerk Records.
Crushed velvet shirt — One
part chic, one part trash,
this intense-vet-restrained
burgundy button-down says,
"Touch me." Nathan's
Friends, $40.
Ring —T
requisite
maximum piece
of metalwear is
also a good con
versation-piece.
Elisabeth's
Closet, $H
Snakeskin belt
Faux. It's not neces
sary to kill real
snakes for hipness in
the post-modern
'90s. Elisabeth's
Closet, $20
Leather pants
— Resilient and
smooth, just like
you. Nathan's
Friends, $60.
Ponytail — An
action kinda guy
like this produc
er-to-be needs a
hairdo that's
easy yet stylin'.
Nathan's Own,
Frit?.
■I
Shades — Tin's*
are de rigueur
for day or night,
suggestively con
cealing the
tnd
remains (or
absence) of a
hangover.
Elisabeth's
Closet, $15.
"i »
Earrings —
Sporting little
jewelry but
these slightly
chunky clip
ons. Nathan
exudes femi
nine authority.
Goodwill, $99.
Pearl necklace —
You could go real or
fake. Barbara Bush
made it all good.
Goodwill, $1.69.
Portfolio —
The final, pro
fessional
touch: the spe
cial resume
receptacle.

The Daily
advertising
office
Black skirt —
Basic and
beautiful, the
skirt goes with
the blouse.
Elisabeth's
Interview Suit,
$50.
So versatile! Nathan
can go from chatting it
up at the CPPC Career
Fair with a U.S.
Secret Service rep, to
an interview with
Andersen Consulting,
to a Trilogy presenta
tion all in an afternoon
in this always classic
ensemble.
Black leather shoes — We
attempt to be one with the
pants. Nathan's Friends, $50.
Ivory blouse —
Basic and beaut 1
ful, the blouse
goes with the
jacket.
Elisabeth's
Interview Suit,
$100.
Black blazer —
Basic and
beautiful, the
jacket lends the
necessary
shoulder pad
age. Elisabeth's
Interview Suit,
$100
V.
Shoes — Basic
and beautiful,
you can hardly
tell we had to
split these up
the back to get
Nathan's feet
into them
