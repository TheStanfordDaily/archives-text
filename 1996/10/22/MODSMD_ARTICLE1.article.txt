# Gingrich raises funds in Palo Alto
## Stanford Democrats protest outside Varian Associates 
### Matt Spence Contributing writer 
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., followed the cam
paign trail into Palo Alto yesterday, only to be greeted by a slew of
Stanford students with chants and placards, defiantly boasting,
"Our house is not your House, Newt."
A dozen Stanford Democrats joined a group of 40 protesters play
ing to television cameras in an effort to derail the Republican cam
paign effort in Silicon Valley.
"We basically want to turn out the Stanford Democrats to show
that this is not friendly territoiy," explained sophomore Rob Rakove,
finance director for the Stanford Democrats, the campus group
which organized the protest event.
With enthusiastic chants of "Hey, hey, ho, ho, Gingrich / Dole
have got to go," the Democrats painted an incongruous picture in the
heart of a Silicon Valley corporate park. Gingrich was attending a
fund-raiser at the headquarters of Varian Associates in Palo Alto's
Stanford Research Park.

Freshman Adam Weiss (above) shows support for the Democrats
outside Varian Associates in Palo Alto, where Rep. Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., (above right) was speaking yesterday.

"Our strategy here is to make
as much noise as we can and sym
bolically be heard," said freshman
Adam Weiss, a Stanford Democ
rats protester.
"This is Clinton country. . . .
Gingrich is the representative of a
failed Republican revolution," con
tinued Weiss, as he joined a chorus
of "Stanford says no to Newt"
chants.
While Clinton enthusiasts
screamed the failures of the Re
publican Congress to passers-by.
Gingrich lauded the successes of
the "Contract With America" to
key Republicans in a brief press
conference and reception for
major party contributors.
Gingrich boasted of Republican
victories in spending cuts in the
federal government and volleyed a
scathing attack against the ethics
of the Clinton administration.
"We really believe the election

will come down to two checks,"
said Gingrich, waving a flier com
paring the Republican and Demo
cratic tax plans in Perot-esque
fashion. "One is to families; the
other is to the IRS."
Gingrich boasted the savings
the much discussed Dole tax cut
would give the "typical American
family."
"The question is should fami
lies have the money or the bureau
crats," he said.
Continuing his theatrical
demonstration of Republican bud
get-cutting, Gingrich proudly dis
played "an official House of Rep
resentatives ice bucket." By cut
ting an ice distribution program
which brought fresh ice each rep
resentative each day, Gingrich
claimed to save taxpayers
$500,000.
"We did not distribute an ice
delivery study or form an over
sight committee," Gingrich
quipped. "We just cut it."
Gingrich abandoned his props
to continue a sharp criticism of
President Clinton's integrity. The

speaker cited a laundry list of De
mocratic controversies and openly
accused the president of bribery,
money laundering and other
fund-raising improprieties.
Gingrich also reasserted the
Republicans' focus on issues im
portant to college voters.
The speaker emphasized re
forming entitlement spending, bal
ancing the budget and winning the
war on drugs as key examples of
Republican attention to young vot
ers.
"You should be scared about
the Democrats willingness to sell
out your generation," said Gin
grich. The speaker also recapped
Republican efforts to reduce enti
tlement costs and criticized the
Democrats for using fear tactics to
defeat such spending cuts.
Gingrich reminded Stanford
voters of the importance of the up
coming election.
"From your generation's
standpoint" in regard to taxing
and spending policies, Gingrich
said, "the difference between the
two parties is billions of dollars."
