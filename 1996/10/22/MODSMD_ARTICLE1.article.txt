# Gingrich raises funds in Palo Alto
## Stanford Democrats protest outside Varian Associates 
### Matt Spence Contributing writer 
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., followed the cam
paign trail into Palo Alto yesterday, only to be greeted by a slew of
Stanford students with chants and placards, defiantly boasting,
"Our house is not your House, Newt."
A dozen Stanford Democrats joined a group of 40 protesters play
ing to television cameras in an effort to derail the Republican cam
paign effort in Silicon Valley.
"We basically want to turn out the Stanford Democrats to show
that this is not friendly territoiy," explained sophomore Rob Rakove,
finance director for the Stanford Democrats, the campus group
which organized the protest event.
With enthusiastic chants of "Hey, hey, ho, ho, Gingrich / Dole
have got to go," the Democrats painted an incongruous picture in the
heart of a Silicon Valley corporate park. Gingrich was attending a
fund-raiser at the headquarters of Varian Associates in Palo Alto's
Stanford Research Park.
