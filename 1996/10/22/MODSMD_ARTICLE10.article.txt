# Court backs policy on gays
## Denial of homosexual's appeal upholds 'don't ask, don't tell' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Clinton's "don't ask, don't
tell" policy on gays in the military
survived its first Supreme Court
test yesterday as the court rejected
the appeal of a former Navy officer
dismissed for declaring his homo
sexuality.
The justices rejected former Lt.
Paul Thomasson's argument that
the policy is unlawful discrimina
tion and a violation of homosexual
service members' free-speech
rights.
Thomasson was forced to leave
the Navy last year after writing a
letter to his commander that said,
"I am gay." He had served for near
ly 10 years.
The court's action was not a rul
ing on the issue's merits and does
not preclude the justices from fully
reviewing the policy in a future
case. But the court let stand a
lower court's decision that upheld
the rule barring openly homosexu
al people from serving in the mili
tary.
The Clinton administration
said the government has a legiti
mate interest in prohibiting homo
sexual acts in the military to avoid

A A 1
a "risk to military effectiveness"
and to protect service members'
privacy
"I'm tremendously disappoint
ed," said Thomasson, who now
manages a restaurant in Washing
ton, D C. But he added, "I know
this injustice will someday be set
right."
Gay rights advocates said they
were not surprised by the court's
action because Thomasson chal
lenged only the part of the policy
allowing the discharge of people
who say they are gay. Other cases
in lower courts are challenging the
entire policy.
"This policy says absolutely no
sexual . . . activity anywhere as
long as you're lesbian or gay," said
Matt Coles of the American Civil
Liberties Union's lesbian and gay
rights project.
In other action yesterday, the
court:
• Left intact a lower court's
decision allowing a film that seeks
converts to Christianity to be
shown at federally funded senior
citizen centers in Albuquerque,
N.M. City officials said showing
the film at citv-owned centers

would violate the required separa
tion of church and state.
• Told a lower court to reconsid
er, under a new federal immigra
tion law, whether U.S. officials in
Hong Kong may refuse to issue
visas to Vietnamese boat people
seeking to enter this country.
• Agreed to use an Idaho case to
decide how quickly government
officials sued in state courts may
appeal a denial of immunity.
Earlier this year, the nation's
highest court handed gay-rights
advocates a major victory by ruling
that Colorado voters could not ban
state and local laws that protect
homosexuals from discrimination.
Hut that ruling did not address
the legality of homosexual conduct.
In 1986, the justices upheld a
Georgia law that criminalized
homosexual sex between consent
ing adults.
Clinton's "don't ask, don't tell"
policy was a compromise that
resulted from congressional repu
diation of his pledge to lift the long
standing ban on gays in the mili
tary. The policy is intended to let
gays serve as long as they keep
