### 
JERUSALEM (AP) — Deepening a
sense of crisis in Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, Palestinian negotiators unexpect
edly walked out of talks in Jerusalem yes
terday.
The walkout came hours after U.S.
mediator Dennis Ross announced that he
was returning to Washington. Israelis
and Palestinians blamed each other for
an impasse after two weeks of talks.
It was not clear when the Palestinians
intended to return to the negotiating
table. Moshe Fogel, a spokesman for
Israel's government, told the AP that "in
principle" the negotiations would contin
ue today. He said the Palestinians seemed
angry, "but we believe these are delaying
tactics."
The latest round of talks began in

response to a plea from President Clinton
following a week of violence in which
Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers
opened fire on one another, killing 79
people. At a summit in Washington, Clin
ton persuaded the two sides to negotiate
nonstop until they reached agreement.
But since then, the Palestinians have
walked out of talks several times to con
sult with Arafat, each time returning to
the table. It was unclear whether yester
day's walkout was more serious.
Ross said there had been progress in
the latest round — just not enough.
Israel, on the other hand, claimed that
only details remained unresolved and
accused Palestinians of stalling. The
Palestinians said both were overestimat
ing the progress.

The talks continued after Ross
announced his departure. But Palestini
an negotiators "got up and walked out"
from a session discussing security in the
West Bank town of Hebron after Israeli
troops pull out, according to Fogel.
A Palestinian official said on condition
of anonymity that the chief Palestinian
negotiator, Saeb Erekat, went to the
nearby autonomous West Bank city of
Bethlehem to report to Yasser Arafat on
the new disagreements.
Fogel said the Palestinians walked out
after the Israelis refused to renegotiate
aspects of the agreement that had been
worked out in recent negotiations. A sep
arate committee working on civilian
aspects of the new Hebron arrangement
was still meeting, he said.
