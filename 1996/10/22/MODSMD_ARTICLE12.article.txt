Nicaraguan election in doubt
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) — Piling up so many votes that he might avoid a
second round, conservative Arnoldo Aleman claimed a triumph yesterday over
Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua's presidential election
But in what may be a preview of antagonism between the Sandinistas and an
Aleman administration, Ortega rejected the official results — at least temporarily
— claiming anomalies and discrepancies between official figures and his own
party's count.
"There was fraud in several instances. There were alterations in the telegrams
from the (states) that lead us to believe the telegrams did not give the exact num
ber of votes the (Sandinistas) got," he said.
Few had expected any candidate to get the 45 percent of the vote needed to win
Sunday's election outright and avoid a runoff. But with 42 percent of the vote
counted yesterday, Aleman had 48 percent to Ortega's 39 percent. Twenty-one
other candidates shared the rest.
