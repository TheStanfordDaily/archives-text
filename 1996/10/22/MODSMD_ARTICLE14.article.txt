## Editorial Rankings too powerful 
### 
Students' aim to curtail
the power of U.S. News'
rankings deserves support

EVERY YEAR, U.S. News &
World Report comes out
with a much-anticipated
"Best Colleges" issue. On this
year's cover, the "Best Colleges"
issue declared itself to be the "#1
Selling College Guide" and boast
ed of its "Exclusive Rankings."
Unfortunately, the magazine is
right; its college guide is wildly
popular while its ranking system is
nothing if not idiosyncratic. The
problem, of course, lies in the con
junction of these two facts. It is
precisely the power of the guide to
effect the decisions of students,
parents and administrators that
makes its unique rating system so
deleterious.
The recent student initiative to
reform the U.S. News & World
Report guide thus deserves serious
attention.
The ASSU last week passed by
unanimous vote a resolution
explicitly denouncing the rankings
and calling for"the administration
to . . . refuse to send in informa
tion requested by the U.S. News &
World Report."
Meanwhile, ASSU President
Bill Shen and Vice President Nick
Thompson have been marshaling
a coalition of students from all
over the country to lobby U.S.
News & World Report to radically
reform its current ranking prac
tices. Already, they have succeeded
in getting students from most of
the top-ranked colleges, including
all of the "top five," to join the
newly formed "Forget U.S. News
Coalition."
Given Stanford's drop this year
from fourth to sixth place in the
rankings, many, including the San
Francisco Chronicle, have suggest
ed that sour grapes have driven
Stanford students to mount this
challenge against the news
magazine. It is important to dispel

this notion here and now.
Shen and Thompson's motives
spring not from any misplaced
resentment about Stanford's fall;
they are most concerned about the
effect that these rankings can have
on University policy.
There have long been suspicions
that certain policies of the Univer
sity are tailored more to boosting
Stanford's ranking than to
improving education. Shen and
Thompson point to the Stanford
Fund, the enactment of an early
decision admissions program, the
change in grading policy and the
repeated attempts to cut certain
interdisciplinary programs.
Needless to say, top University
administrators deny ever making
policy for the benefit of U.S. News
& World Report, so there is no way
of definitively knowing how much
the rankings actually effect
administrative decisionmaking.
But Shen and Thompson have
identified a pattern of decisions
that strongly indicates that Uni
versity administrators, whether
they like it or not, make policy
with one eye on the yearly rank
ings.
The right of U.S. News & World
Report to print overall rankings of
colleges is not in dispute. However,
recognizing the subjective nature
of the rankings and the power they
can have in determining Universi
ty policy, students are asking that
the newsmagazine take some
responsibility for the conse
quences of what it publishes.
The student coalition is asking
U.S. News & World Report to sim
ply print the information it has
collected about each college with
out coming up with some deceiv
ingly precise mechanism to deter
mine which college is first, second,
third, etc. Even University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper pointed out
the inherent problems of measur
ing educational quality statistical
ly in a letter to U.S. News & World
Report's editor.
The newsmagazine would do
well to listen to the criticisms and
advice of students and Casper.
