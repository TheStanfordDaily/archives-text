## Truth is not always relative 
### 
c\ TERITAS," TRUTH - THE
\/ motto of the oldest and
▼ arguably the finest, most well
respected university in America, Har
vard. "Lux et Veritas." Light and truth
— another all too familiar motto from
another well-respected university, Yale.
For years, these institutions have found
value in the role of truth in higher educa
tion. These old school mottoes lead us to
believe that one cannot have a university
without truth.
Or can we?
Stanford has managed to sneak the
word "university" after its name and, at
the same time, unconcern itself with the
sweet pursuit of "lux et Veritas" —
instead, allowing a certain breed of
unbridled relativism to run rampant on
campus.
No introduction to this madness is bet
ter than our freshman year at Stanford;
our CIV tracks and freshman dorms serve
as spawning pools for relativist thought. I
can never forget our discussions and lec
tures on ancient Greek pederasty. A
young, sheltered Arizona boy from
Phoenix's poor South Side, I had no
mixed emotions about the lifestyles of the
Greeks: shameless. However, my profes
sors and comrades all labored relentlessly
to have me remove my 20th-century gog
gles: "Garry, you must consider this is a
different time period with different val
ues," they contended. "You must look at
the situation from another standpoint."
Bullshit.

What other standpoint? What else is
there to say? You just cannot look at an
act like pederasty and rationalize it. We
do draw the line somewhere, don't we?
Where is our sense of conviction? Didn't
Evelyn Waugh say, "It is better to have
strong and rigid principles than none at
all"? Have we opted for none at all?
Where are those strong principles
responsible for the creation of universi
ties like Harvard and Yale? Are they not
supposed to move us toward some truth?
Pursuing these all too elusive truths
implies a certain degree of intellectual
honesty. This means analyzing the val
ues of the period in question; sometimes,
that even means we must deem certain
behaviors intolerable. I would hate to see
someone attempt to justify American
slavery as "a different period with differ
ent values." I will not look at it from
another standpoint. This is why I cannot
rationalize Greek pederasty as merely a
way of life for a distant society.
Instead of calling a spade a spade, we
are bred to mouth cliches like "It's all
good" and "To each his own." Inspired to
embrace everything, we believe in noth
ing, fueling the flames of student apathy.
For fear of offending groups or opening
ourselves up to attack, we remain tight
lipped and go with the flow: "It's all
good." Students honest enough with
themselves and their education reject
this disheveled genre of so-called educa
tion, thus becoming martyrs of the uni
versity.

I must be honest with myself; rela
tivism and the university are queer bed
fellows. I can tolerate some ambiguity
when it comes to truth; there are some
gray areas, but there is a hell of a lot of
black and white too! To use a mathemat
ical example: Two and two do equal four.
That is a truth. So do three and one. And
four and zero, too.
But two and two do not equal six. And
anyone who says so is wrong. This is the
purpose of the university — to find the
truth wherever it may be hiding and to
unmask prevarications disguised as
truths as the malevolent deceivers they
really are. We should not seek to ratio
nalize their existence; neither should we
make an effort to accept them. I do not
spend $30,000 and nine months of my
year in pursuit of learning how to accept
every value that comes my way — for
what worth is there to my own values if I
accept every other?
None.
Veritas is what I seek, not a rational
ization of behaviors and customs. I guess
it is most apropos that our University
motto is "Die Luft der Freheit Weht"
(the winds of freedom blow).
I'd call those winds hot air.
