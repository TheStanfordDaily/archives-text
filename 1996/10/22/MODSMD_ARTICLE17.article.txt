Outside protest essential to ending Burma's atrocities

WE WOULD LIKE to continue the
discussion about the effective
ness and purpose of the Interna
tional Free Burma Fast that was brought
up in an Oct. 15 letter to The Daily.
First of all, we appreciate your input
and are glad that our actions have made
people think about the issue at hand. The
letter questioned the power of the econom
ic sanctions in creating real change in
Burma. We maintain that informing peo
ple and pushing for sanctions have been
and will be effective in reducing the
stronghold of the Burmese dictatorship.
For more than 20 years, the State Law
and Order Restoration Council rejected
corporate dollars and tried to shut Burma
off from the rest of the world. However, as
knowledge of the military activities in
Burma spread, the monetary support of
foreign governments declined. The mere
opening of Burmese doors to foreign
investment in 1988 shows the economic

decline of the government and its reliance
on corporate money in order to stay in
power. The SLORC needed and continues
to need money, just as all governments do.
Far from providing any real benefit to the
citizens of Burma, this money helps to
legitimize and strengthen the stronghold
of the government. How can the govern
ment expect to stay in power if it has no
money with which to purchase weapons,
soldiers, bribes and jail cells?
Why do we, as activists in the United
States, believe that economic sanctions can
change any of this? It is because, as Scott
Richardson says in his letter, the Burmese
government is not really concerned with
the welfare and satisfaction of its citizens;
instead, they are concerned with what WE
think.
SLORC cares very much about its repu
tation in the world community, and they
pay particular attention to foreign corpo
rate investors. It needs to cultivate a legit

imate image of itself if it hopes to continue
to support itself through foreign invest
ment. And what better proof of its "legiti
macy" than to have the economic support
of influential U.S. corporations? In this,
the corporate involvement in Burma
extends far beyond the millions of dollars
that is given to the SLORC.
When PepsiCo decides to sponsor the
SLORC's international trade fair, as they
did last year, it sends two messages: one to
other international investors that it is okay
to profit from the oppression of Burmese
people, and another to the Burmese people
fighting for democracy that even the Unit
ed States is on the side of their oppressors.
Thus, it is crucial that we use every
opportunity to try to get U.S. corporations
out of Burma. The people of Burma, includ
ing Aan Sang Suu Kyi, have been calling for
economic sanctions for a long time. With
the momentum that has recently been built
as more and more U.S. corporations pull

out of Burma, and Clinton prepares to pos
sibly impose further sanctions, the time is
perfect for activists to use strong measures
in order to maintain media attention on
Burma. The reason that these actions
make us "feel good" is we have seen the
effectiveness of media attention on college
activism in forcing corporations to stop
their involvement in Burma. Any action or
discussion of Burma in the media or on
campus promotes the work of activists
nationwide in this movement.
Finally, we would like to stress our
appreciation of any discussion about our
activities involving Burma, and we hope
that we have continued our ongoing dia
logue about this important issue.
