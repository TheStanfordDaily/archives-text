# Tuesday Thoughts: Presidential Election
## Clinton's tax policies make Dole look great 
### 
Before i
ask you
to consid
er voting for Bob
Dole on Nov. 5,
let me ask you to
consider why
you shouldn't
vote for Bill

Clinton.
Bill Clinton has often spoken
about making America more
equitable, an end which the
Democrats have consistently
tried to achieve by levying heavy
taxes on the rich. No surprise
there — Clinton has already
raised taxes by more than a
quarter of a trillion dollars dur
ing his term. What may be a sur
prise, though, is that if you and
your spouse earn what the aver
age Stanford graduate earns,
you are considered "rich." And
in the interests of equity Clinton
intends, through a combination
of state, local and federal taxes,
to take 68 percent of what makes
you "rich" away.
Many people could accept this
if the 68 cents the government
takes out of their dollar were
going to a useful purpose — but
it isn't. The government has
spent $5.4 trillion on poverty
(the largest spending sector)
since the inception of the wel
fare state — which incidentally
is enough to have put every per
son ever on welfare above the
poverty line. Logically, then,
poverty cannot exist. But pover
ty does exist because the govern
ment piddles away the money on
administration. Clinton knows
this but has vetoed welfare
reform twice.
Your money isn't going to
education, either. The great uni
versity science departments,
Stanford's included, thrived on
military research grants which
Clinton has cut out of the bud
get. Mind you, Clinton has given
the Department of Defense more
money than it requested every
year, but that money has been
pork — building obsolete
bombers, maintaining outmoded
missile systems. Clinton's redis
tributing wealth, all right, right
into the hands of local party
machines.
Despite taking 68 percent of
your paycheck, Clinton feels
that he still isn't spending
enough.
The Social Security fund has
been raided each year of his
administration to cover illegiti

mate spending. Social Security
will be bankrupt after 2004,
which means that we'll have to
carry an even heavier tax burden
to support many who had con
tributed in expectation of retire
ment benefits, but who will by
necessity be shifted on to the
notoriously inefficient welfare
rolls.
Under Clinton, the pay you
earn and which the Democrats
consider the property of "the
people," hasn't gotten much big
ger either. The economy grew at
a moribund 2 percent to 3 per
cent under Clinton compared to
the much-maligned Bush, who
managed 4 percent growth dur
ing the last year of his term.
Bob Dole and his plan aren't,
of course, instant cures for these
problems. But Dole is a start.
Dole proposes a 15 percent tax
cut, which means that 15 per
cent more American income can
be invested without the ridicu
lous inefficiency of government
into American business, creating
jobs so people don't need to be
on welfare for 12.98 years, as
they are on average now. Dole
also advocates greater fiscal
responsibility than Clinton and
honestly intends to balance the
budget, which Clinton promised
to have mostly balanced by now,
but which is still dangerously
out of kilter.
Many people find Dole's tax
cuts and thrift appealing but
worry that Republicans are
unsympathetic. To believe that
is to ignore that Dole has one of
the strongest civil rights records
in the Senate, acknowledged as a
rights leader by Democrats and
Republicans alike. Many people
believe that the Republicans
want a few people to be rich and
everyone else to be poor.
Again, not true. Prosperity is
not a zero-sum game: Republi
cans want everyone to be rich.
Many people believe that Dole
and other Republicans are
amoral and avaricious —
neglecting Clinton's behavior in
Whitewater and Travelgate and
forgetting about Dole's record as
a war hero and rights leader.
Dole alone isn't the answer,
but he's a good start. I hope you
will consider him for President
this fall.

is an ASSU senator who is cur
rently studying at Stanford in
Oxford.
