# Faculty debate tuition benefits
## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
In the wake of recent federal cut
backs, Stanford is pondering the
long-term future of its employee tu
ition benefits program and con
fronting issues related to equity and
an increasingly competitive hiring
process.
Under the current program, in
dividuals employed by Stanford for
at least five years are entitled to re
imbursement for their children's
undergraduate education totaling
as much as half the cost of a Stan
ford education.
While faculty and staff generally
are supportive of the tuition bene
fits program, they recognize its ef
fects on how competitive the Uni
versity is in attracting hires — de
pending on whether the prospective
applicant is planning for children's
higher education.
The University currently funds
two-thirds of the tuition benefit,
and the federal government funds

the remaining third.
However, a decision by the feder
al Office of Management and Bud
get last May to cease contributing to
the tuition benefits program as of
Sept. 1, 1999, has caused Stanford
to re-examine its policy.
In an announcement to the Fac
ulty Senate earlier this month,
Provost Condoleezza Rice said the
program would be "grandfathered"
in for all employees hired before
Sept. 1,1998.
The University Committee on
Faculty and Staff Benefits will
study options for employees hired
after that date and report back to
the Faculty Senate within six
months with a recommendation.
Faculty members' relief at the
continuation of the program for ex
isting employees is tempered with
concerns over its future.
"We have to weigh the overall fi
nancial issues for faculty and staff,"
said James Franklin, vice president
for total compensation for the Per
sonnel Services Office. "As a gener
al spirit, we like the idea of provid
ing benefits, and the program has
been highly valued."
A number of issues related to the
University's competitiveness are
up for discussion.
"Just how can we attract the
brightest young people and keep
those people here to build and nur
ture their careers?" Franklin
asked.
According to Franklin, in con
structing a total benefits package
attractive to prospective employ
ees, the University must be careful
to find a balance between people
whose children will soon be attend
ing college and others for whom the
prospect of paying for a college edu
cation may be far down the road or
not even a concern.
Franklin, the father of two col
lege-aged children, said Stanford's
tuition benefits program helped en
courage him to spend 21 years on
the Farm.
"Sometimes you have to do what
is contrary to the immediate tastes
of the person," he said. "You don't
want to attract them in a hurry and

then hand it all to them."
Building a total benefits package
is complicated, said Business Prof.
Bob Flanagan, the chair of the ben
efits committee.
"You are hiring on two levels:
the academic market and the staff
market," he said. "How do you han
dle the total benefits package?"
In addition to tuition, the facul
ty package includes other benefits
such as health care, dental care and
retirement programs.
Another member of the commit
tee said the competition for new
staff is particularly intense in the
science and technology fields,
where Stanford is competing
against Silicon Valley firms, in ad
dition to other universities.
"It all depends upon the individ
ual situation," said David Spiegel, a
psychiatry professor. "These firms
can offer things such as stock op
tions."
Several faculty members men
tioned the tuition benefits program
as a factor in their decision to come
to Stanford.
Dean of Students Marc Wais,
who came to Stanford a year ago
from the University of Maryland,
said Stanford's program was at
tractive in light of financing his two
young children's college education.
"In makinga 3,000-mile move, it
is something that you pay a lot of at

tention to," he said. "Because of the
sheer cost of a college education, it
is something that parents are con
stantly thinking about."
History Prof. Jack Rakove, fa
ther of two teen-age children, said
the tuition benefits program was
an extra incentive for him.
"It was a great relief to hear that
it will be continued," he said.
In making its decision, the com
mittee must also consider issues of
equity since many faculty members
do not have children, according to
Franklin. Although some may lose
out if their children cannot take ad
vantage of the tuition benefits,
those faculty and staff may take ad
vantage of other benefits more
making the program fair overall, he
said.
"Not everyone uses equal dol
lars in health benefits," he said. "It
all comes out in the wash in the end.
In general, it is an excellent benefits
package. There is nothing unduly
unfair in the benefits package."
The committee is looking at the
long-term consequences of its deci
sion.
"We want to come up with a so
lution that is financially responsi
ble," said Spiegel. "Investing in ed
ucation is responsible."
"It is all about what Stanford
can do to make it a good place to
work," said Franklin.
