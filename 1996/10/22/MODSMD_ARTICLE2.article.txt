# Faculty debate tuition benefits
## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
In the wake of recent federal cut
backs, Stanford is pondering the
long-term future of its employee tu
ition benefits program and con
fronting issues related to equity and
an increasingly competitive hiring
process.
Under the current program, in
dividuals employed by Stanford for
at least five years are entitled to re
imbursement for their children's
undergraduate education totaling
as much as half the cost of a Stan
ford education.
While faculty and staff generally
are supportive of the tuition bene
fits program, they recognize its ef
fects on how competitive the Uni
versity is in attracting hires â€” de
pending on whether the prospective
applicant is planning for children's
higher education.
The University currently funds
two-thirds of the tuition benefit,
and the federal government funds

the remaining third.
However, a decision by the feder
al Office of Management and Bud
get last May to cease contributing to
the tuition benefits program as of
Sept. 1, 1999, has caused Stanford
to re-examine its policy.
In an announcement to the Fac
ulty Senate earlier this month,
Provost Condoleezza Rice said the
program would be "grandfathered"
in for all employees hired before
Sept. 1,1998.
The University Committee on
Faculty and Staff Benefits will
study options for employees hired
after that date and report back to
the Faculty Senate within six
months with a recommendation.
Faculty members' relief at the
continuation of the program for ex
isting employees is tempered with
concerns over its future.
"We have to weigh the overall fi
nancial issues for faculty and staff,"
said James Franklin, vice president
