# President has worked hard for our generation
## 
### 
THE ESSENCE OF the
1996 election can be cap
tured in three little L
words. Dole calls Clinton the lib
eral; Perot pursues his lawsuit;
Clinton wins by a landslide.
In a time of huge social
changes, Clinton's message crit
ically targets the emerging prob
lems in America. XJnlike Bob
Dole, Clinton has identified that
the information age requires
bipartisan support for solid edu
cational, environmental and
economic opportunities. Bob
Dole should seize this last
minute opportunity to re-evalu
ate the dominant issue in his
campaign. His promise to cut
taxes by 15 percent turns away
more voters than his plot to
eliminate the Department of
Education.
In his next four years, Clinton
will inevitably expand on his
previous successes. Clinton
reveals his resolution in the
landmark and effective legisla
tion he has signed into law. The
Brady Bill and the Crime Bill
will work to limit sales of hand
guns with the additional support
of 100,000 police officers on the
streets. With a budget balanced
in seven years, Clinton will
invest resources in education
from public elementary schools
to private colleges. Empowering
children through the Head Start
program, the Educate America
Act and tax rebates for college
tuition demonstrates his com
mitment to the future.
In addition, Clinton's agenda
focuses on developing working
skills for those facing poverty.
Though the Welfare Reform Bill
has its weaknesses, it is a first
step in breaking a cycle of depen
dency. The bill funds job place
ment and child support recovery
efforts to support self-sufficien
cy and responsibility. Clinton
has also created 10.5 million
new jobs in his first term and his
second term promises an even
better record as the economy
improves.
Bob Dole is old. The fact that
a 73-year-old man reaches his
life expectancy in three years
deserves our serious attention.
While he demonstrated laudable
courage in World War 11, the
next five decades of his life
reveal some serious political
flaws and an extremist view of
government.
Dole's tax scheme calls for
m nrp tVitan $700 hi 11 inn in tav

cuts. Credible
analyses from
Time and Busi
ness Week say
that Dole's plan
will require at
least a 30 per
cent cut in the
federal govern-

ment. It is less than comforting
that Dole wants to cut the
Department of Education while
promising that he always keeps
his word. Maybe he should
reconsider in light of America's
overwhelming support for edu
cational improvement.
Clinton has committed him
self to incrementally improve
the health care system for the 30
million Americans who have no
insurance. Bob Dole's tax cuts
threaten America's economic
health and Americans' right to
health care. The thousands of
victims of smoking-related ill
nesses should remind Dole that,
even though tobacco companies
fund Dole's campaign, tobacco is
addictive.
Bob Dole will not win. Less
than 20 days before the election,
Bill Clinton has a 20-point lead
in the most recent polls. But the
incredible importance of voting
must not be understated.
The process of voting and
electing a president creates an
infinite legacy in legislation and
political appointments: the
trickle-down effect of electing a
president.
Many Supreme Court justices
are approaching their last years
of service. Bob Dole's appoint
ments would threaten the right
to abortion, affirmative action
programs and the right to free
speech.
The new breed of Republicans
link the party to an extremist
"Contract with America." Clin
ton has proven that incremental
change maintains the trust vot
ers have invested in him.
Exuding confidence on the
countdown to Election Day, Bill
Clinton has found a balance
between change and stability.
His re-election promises Ameri
cans better health care, educa
tion and economic growth. And,
in turn, this promise strength
ens our responsibility to make it
happen.
