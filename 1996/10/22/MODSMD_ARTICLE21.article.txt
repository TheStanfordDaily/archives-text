# And Don't Forget...
## Nader offers students a real progressive choice 
### 
WHAT CONSTITUTES A
vote nowadays — a citizen
or a dollar? If you believe
in government by the people and
for the people, consider Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader.
Those who are pushing the vote
for Nader are really pushing the
vote for themselves; that is, to put

government back in the hands of citizens and out of
corporate control.
In the past three decades, Nader has worked to
fight corporate power and support workers, con
sumers, taxpayers and basic human rights. Nader's
ideas and lobbying have resulted in such state and
federal laws as the Freedom of Information Act, the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Con
sumer Protection Safety Commission. He has
established many non-profit public interest groups
and was among the first U.S. activists to recognize
and expose the threat of NAFTA and GA I I to
American workers and the environment. Nader's
public record alone might be enough to ameliorate
the cynicism of these days.
However, even Nader would admit that no
amount of citizen action can surmount the corpo
rate interests that flood our government. "The
two-party duopoly — essentially one corporate
party with two heads called Republican and Demo
cratic, each wearing different makeup — presents
the citizenry every four years with a choice
between the Bad and the Worse," Nader said.
While social issues serve as a moderate mark
between right and left, both parties these days are
quick to kowtow to moneyed interests. Both parties
keep turning their eye from corporate crime,
including financial swindles, pollution and con
sumer law violations.
We are paying already — massive corporations
like General Electric and Lockheed Martin get
about $200 billion a year in corporate welfare. And
while we watch the two sides race to cut aid to fel-

low Americans,
we can at least
take heart in the
$100 billion a
year that goes to
"defend" Western
Europe and East
Asia from a
nonexistent

II v; 11 U A 1 O I U II b
enemy but at least keeps the military employed.
However, Nader's campaign is not merely based
on the current wrongs but also a truly progressive
based movement to "focus on ways to develop uni
versally accessible, accountable instruments of
democratic action for citizens, voters, taxpayers,
workers, consumers, shareholder investors and
students who r and our civic associations." In
essence, to make any locus of power accountable.
He says he'd increase law enforcement on corpo
rate crime, fraud and abuse; include practical, civil
skills in public schools; remove corporate welfare
and cut the defense budget; funnel money into
research and development for people's needs;
restore "critical public wealth of our country" and
create major community-development loans.
While many Greens are content on Nader's
strong economic stance alone, others are wholly
confident about their vote because of Winona
LaDuke, Green vice-presidential candidate.
LaDuke founded the Indigenous Women's Net
work, serves on the board of Greenpeace, USA and
is the spokesperson for the Chippewa people of
Northern Minnesota. LaDuke's activism adds a
social dimension that makes the Green vote a well
balanced choice.
"Eventually government is a mirror for our
selves," said Nader last Wednesday in Memorial
Auditorium. So, do we keep wallowing in with
drawal or break down corporate culture and restore
democracy now?
