£ T SHE RUNNING?' everyone asks when I wear
I my "Perot for President" button. It's a sad
.X. commentary on American politics and media
that Ross Perot's latest work has gone unnoticed. In
just a few months, he created a national political party
from scratch and put his name on the ballot in all 50
states. And even at Stanford, in all our political activi
ty, we have heard little of the Reform Party leader.
Until now. Perot, in a whirlwind of appearances
nationwide, arrives here Nov. 1, and maybe then we at
Stanford can learn more about "Ross," who definitely
is running in this year's presidential election.
Ross Perot is no ordinary politician. Raised in
Depression-era Texas, he attended the Naval Academy.
After working for IBM, he started a small computer

company and made it a high-tech
$2.5 billion success. When two
employees were token hostage in
Iran, Perot personally led a successful
rescue mission through the Teheran
prison. He sits on prisoner of war,
drug and education task forces.
In 1992 Perot won 19 percent of
the popular vote, the best showing
for an independent candidate since
Teddy Roosevelt's "Bull Moose
Party" in 1912.
This time Perot runs under the
Reform Party with a platform of eco
nomic mid political reform, but in the
rigid two-party system the new party
has been unfairly brushed aside.

However, Perot has a great deal to offer our genera
tion — a sound plan of swift and dynamic reforms to
prepare our country for the 21st century.
• The IX'ht: Perot's favorite issue, now topping $5
trillion With these numbers, Perot warns, we are los
ing clout in the global marketplace and wasting pre
cious tax dollars just paying off the interest. As it piles
up, we subject ourselves and future generations to an
enormous tax burden. Clinton's 1995 budget report
estimates that a baby born today will grow up to pay
an 82 prrccnt tax rate. "That," Perot says, "will be the
end of the American Dream."
• Rustv Old Programs: Perot suecrests total over-

haul of Social Security, Medicare,
welfare and the Internal Revenue
Service, all created decades ago and
no longer cost-effective. When our
baby-boomer parents begin to
retire, the costs will soar astronom
ically. Perot insists, "We must keep
these programs dynamii and calls
for expert research and pilot-test
ing before signing any plan into
law.

• Clean Up Washington Sh iter and cheaper cam
paigns, easier access to ballots and debates and no spe
cial interest money. Perot also proposes national ref
erenda on major legislation, elimination of the elec

toral college and voting on weekends.
• Abortion I Vrot i> pro-choice, leav
ing it up to the individual, not Wash
ington, to decide on personal and
moral issues.
Many fear that Perot "doesn't
have a chance or will "throw the
election ' However, a New York
Times poll revealed that, had we
voted our consciences in 1992, Perot
would have received -40 percent, but
"Don't waste your vote" propaganda
convinced many to vote for one of the
two major-party candidates. Also,
contrary to popular belief, Perot
pulled equally from both Clinton and
Bush supporters.

We are at a crucial point in American history. Our
next president must have the vision and the determi
nation to make our nation great again. On Nov. 5, let
us cast our votes with the future in mind — a nation
with a healthy economy, an honest government and a
renewed American Dream.
"Is Ross Perot running?" He sure is. Is he winning?
Now that is left up to us. We have two weeks to decide.
Vote your conscience.
