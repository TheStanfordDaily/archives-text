### Megan Tompkins 
The rising stars of Stanford women's
golf, led by stellar senior Mhairi McKay,
captured a second-place finish at the Stan
ford Women's Intercollegiate on Sunday
against the stiff competition of perennial
power San Jose State and other top teams.
The tournament was the second on the
year for the squad, as Stanford won the
team competition and McKay claimed first
individually at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invita
tional earlier this month.
"We are really pleased with the start of
the season," McKay said. "We got first last
week and second this week. We were a bit
disappointed in the last day (of the Inter
collegiate), but we're really excited for the
rest of the season."
McKay owned the first two rounds this
weekend for the Card, firing a career-low
66 for the edge after round one and main
taining her lead with a 71 in round two.
Senior Andrea Baxter was next for the
squad with a two-round total of 148 for just
2-over-par and an eighth-place position.
Freshman Julie Dunn followed closely
behind Baxter in a tie for ninth at four
over.
After day one of play, the Stanford
women held the top spot in the team com
petition with a 5-under-par 287 and a new
tournament record for an 18-hole total.
The Cardinal faltered slightly in round
two, shooting a 302 while San Jose State
edged narrowly ahead. The Spartans main
tained their level of play by notching anoth
er team score of 293 and moved into the top
position three strokes up on Stanford.

But McKay still held the top spot in
individual play after two rounds at 10
under par. She slipped in the third round to
San Jose State's Janice Moodie, who seized
the individual title with 10-under- par 209,
just two strokes over McKay's 211.
Rounding out the top five in the event
were Spartan K.M. Juul, Sarah Comstock
of New Mexico State and USC's Ida
Danielsson.
Baxter moved up in the final round of
competition to finish sixth and played even
ly throughout the tournament with three
round totals of 73, 75 and 74 for a 222 total
at 3-over.
Dunn maintained her position in the
final round after slipping from fifth in the
first round to ninth place in the second and
ended the tournament in ninth. Dunn's
best score came in the first round at 72, and
she added scores of 78 and 75 in the final
rounds.
The other Stanford golfers, sophomore
Michelle Sperry, freshman JaeJean Ro and
sophomore Jenny Pippin, finished 34th,
40th and 60th respectively with total scores
of 238, 240 and 251.
The Cardinal finished with a 54-hole
total 892 after shooting a final round of
303. San Jose State took the team title with
a 5-over-par 881, while UCLA finished
third at 920.
"I know we can go on and do great
things from here," McKay said. "We all
know we've got the team to win the
NCAAs. We're going to have to put our
selves in a winning position so come
