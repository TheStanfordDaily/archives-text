With a decisive victory at
the Pre-NCAA Invitational at
Tucson, Ariz., the men's cross
country team has made a
strong bid for a berth at the
NCAA finals on Nov. 25.
The team, ranked second in
the nation, beat a field full of
top-25 teams by scoring 53
points. Sixth-ranked Colorado
followed with 110, ninth-ranked
Portland garnered third with
168 and No. 4 Northern Arizona
finished a disappointing fourth
with 180.
Senior Greg Jimmerson led
the Cardinal by taking fourth
overall with a time of 26 min
utes, 34 seconds over the
8,600-meter course. No. 24
Nebraska struck quickly as
Cornhuskers Cleophus Boor
(25:58) and Jonah Kiptarus
(26:07) finished first and sec
ond, respectively. They were
followed by 1996 Stanford Invi
tational champion Mebrahtom
Keflezighi (26:08) of UCLA.
But it was the consistency of
the Cardinal runners which
decided the race, as they fin

ished with three in the top 10
overall and all five point-win
ners in the top 20. Sophomore
Brad Hauser (26:43) and
senior J.J. White (26:53) fin
ished sixth and seventh,
respectively, and junior
Nathan Nutter (27:13) and
sophomore Brent Hauser
(27:20) garnered the rest of the
Cardinal points by taking 17th
and 19th, respectively.
"I don't know what coach
[Vin Lananna] is doing in
terms of running different peo
ple [over the past few weeks],
but I think that this week he's
really focused on training,"
Nutter said. "I think that since
the beginning of the season
he's really been stressing these
two weeks for practice.
"This is the championship
part of our season We've all
gotten the feel for racing again
(after the offseasonj. We're
basically back in racing form.
Everyone knows what to
expect now. We just have to
have good workouts and keep
focused on our goal. That's the
main thing that's gotten us
