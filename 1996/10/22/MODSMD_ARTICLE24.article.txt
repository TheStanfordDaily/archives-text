## 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
With a decisive victory at
the Pre-NCAA Invitational at
Tucson, Ariz., the men's cross
country team has made a
strong bid for a berth at the
NCAA finals on Nov. 25.
The team, ranked second in
the nation, beat a field full of
top-25 teams by scoring 53
points. Sixth-ranked Colorado
followed with 110, ninth-ranked
Portland garnered third with
168 and No. 4 Northern Arizona
finished a disappointing fourth
with 180.
Senior Greg Jimmerson led
the Cardinal by taking fourth
overall with a time of 26 min
utes, 34 seconds over the
8,600-meter course. No. 24
Nebraska struck quickly as
Cornhuskers Cleophus Boor
(25:58) and Jonah Kiptarus
(26:07) finished first and sec
ond, respectively. They were
followed by 1996 Stanford Invi
tational champion Mebrahtom
Keflezighi (26:08) of UCLA.
But it was the consistency of
the Cardinal runners which
decided the race, as they fin

ished with three in the top 10
overall and all five point-win
ners in the top 20. Sophomore
Brad Hauser (26:43) and
senior J.J. White (26:53) fin
ished sixth and seventh,
respectively, and junior
Nathan Nutter (27:13) and
sophomore Brent Hauser
(27:20) garnered the rest of the
Cardinal points by taking 17th
and 19th, respectively.
"I don't know what coach
[Vin Lananna] is doing in
terms of running different peo
ple [over the past few weeks],
but I think that this week he's
really focused on training,"
Nutter said. "I think that since
the beginning of the season
he's really been stressing these
two weeks for practice.
"This is the championship
part of our season We've all
gotten the feel for racing again
(after the offseasonj. We're
basically back in racing form.
Everyone knows what to
expect now. We just have to
have good workouts and keep
focused on our goal. That's the
main thing that's gotten us
this far â€” focusing on our goal,"
Nutter said.
Nutter also feels that the team
is in a better position now than it
has been in past years at the
same time of the season.
"The same [pre-NCA\] meets
last year made us travel far away,
and we'd be tired out this week,"
Nutter said. "We would not be
running up to par. But this year
we only went to Arizona. We're
not too tired out, and we're geared
up for a good week of training."
At the California-Nevada
State Championships in San Luis
Obispo, the women took the meet
title by taking second place with
88 points. Adams (Colo.) State
scored 33 to win the overall com
petition, but because they were
only an outside competitor not
affiliated with the meet alliance,
the crown went to the Cardinal.
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo fin
ished third with 133 points.
Freshman Sally Glynn led the
team by taking sixth place with a
time of 18:23. Sophomore Ryan
Thomas (18:49), freshman

Shaluinn Fullove (18:52), sopho
more Allison Twist (18:57) and
senior Amy Mac Arthur (18:59)
scored the rest of the Stanford
points by placing 17th, 20th, 21st
and 24th, respectively.
"This meet was basically an
opportunity for a lot of the team
to get in and compete well," said
assistant coach Beth Alford-Sulli
van. "We had rested kids who had
run in Maine the weekend before.
It just shows the depth we have.
"I think the women are in
good shape. . . . We've gotten
them into a training cycle which
should get us ready for the Pac
-10 meet and every race there
after."
The men's squad for the Cal
Poly race finished fifth overall,
behind Adams State, UC-Santa
Barbara, Cal Poly-SLO and Fres
no State.
Junior Jake Maas led the men
by taking 20th with a time of
26:15. Junior Michael Prindiville
(26:24) and Matt Devine (26:37)
rounded out Stanford's top three
by taking 25th and 30th, respec
tively.
"I think [this meet has) given
a lot of people a lot of opportuni
ty for competition," said assis

tant coach Andy Gerard. "This
weekend we had almost 20 men
and 11 women compete. We've
had that kind of situation the
past couple of weeks. That's the
key to doing well late in the sea
son. It's allowed our top level
runners to compete against com
petitors who are some of the top
in the country.
"It has also allowed our
younger kids to compete against
people who are on their level. We
did a pretty good job in terms of
challenging ourselves with that
particular group of people."
The team will now focus on
training over the next two weeks
as they prepare for the Pacific 10
Conference Championships at the
Stanford Golf Course on Nov. 2.
"I think we're going to hold
lots of tough workouts which will
get us prepared physically and
mentally for the championship
part of the season," Twist said.
"We'll concentrate on the things
we need to concentrate on as a
team in order to do our best, such
as working on a formulaic race
strategy not only for the team as
a whole but for each person on
the team as an individual run
ner."
