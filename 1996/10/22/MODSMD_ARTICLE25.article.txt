# Meade sails into nationals
## 
### David McGee 
In an event not often practiced and
in a boat not often raced by the Stan
ford sailing team, junior John Meade
claimed first place at the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Associa
tion Single-handed Championships in
Long Beach this weekend.
In winning the regatta Meade qual
ified for the national single-handed
championships to be held Nov. 8-10 at
the College of Charleston in South
Carolina, as the top two individual fin
ishers of the 19-boat regatta qualified
for nationals.
The victory marks the second con
secutive year that a Stanford sailor has
qualified for the national champi
onships, after junior Danny Zimbaldi
qualified last year. Zimbaldi just
missed qualifying this year, narrowly
finishing third to San Diego State's
Brian Camet.
Meade finished with 73 points, far
outdistancing Camet's 93 and Zimbal
di's 99. Stanford sophomore Tyler
Doyle finished 10th and freshman
Anika Leerssen finished 13th.
Meade finished in the top three in 11
of the 19 races and never placed worse
than eighth en route to his victory.
"The big key was being consistent,"

Meade said. "I didn't want to let any
small mistake turn into a big mistake,
which could turn into a bad race,
which could turn into a bad regatta. I
was well prepared mentally."
"It's nice to see [Meade] win a big
event like this," said head coach Steve
Bourdow. "He's getting the feel of
entering a regatta with the intention of
winning it."
Meade entered the seventh race tied
for first with USC's Mike Uznis, but
Meade's first place and Uznis' 12th
place finish put Meade on top to stay.
Uznis finished the regatta in fourth
place with 116 points.
As Saturday's 10 races came to a
close, Meade already had a command
ing 19-point lead, and hoped to hang
onto the lead on Sunday.
"I was nervous," he said. "I thought
I would have to be a real idiot to lose it,
so I sailed more conservatively on Sun
day. You could tell because I didn't sail
as well as Saturday, but I was still able
to extend my lead by one point."
After placing second last year, Zim
baldi almost made a repeat perfor
mance, but was thwarted by a late
charge from Camet.
Trailing Camet 76-94 after the 17th
race, Zimbaldi narrowed the gap with a
first-place finish while Camet placed a

distant 14th. Zimbaldi needed to beat
Camet by six places in the 19th and
final race to qualify, but Camet's third
place finish sealed the Trojan's overall
second-place standing.
"I thought I had him beat," Zimbal
di said. "But when he came up strong
behind me, it was out of my hands."
Had Zimbaldi finished second, it
would have marked the first time two
Stanford sailors had qualified for the
single-handed national championships.
"It would have been nice to see,"
Bourdow said, "But we're still very
happy with the outcome."
It was a perfect day for laser sailing.
Cloudless skies yielded morning
breezes of 5-7 knots, which picked up
to 10-12 knots in the afternoon. The
exquisite weather is a complete oppo
site of what Meade will be facing in
Charleston, however.
"Sailing [in Charleston] is literally
like sailing in a toilet bowl," Bourdow
said. "The tidal current is tricky, with
three rivers emptying into the harbor,
which then empties into the ocean. It's
a tough place to sail."
"I'm looking forward to it," Meade
said. "The competition should be real
ly tough, but I think I can do pretty
well."
The regatta will feature the top
16 laser sailors in the country.
Bourdow said Meade will not go
into the regatta as the favorite,
but he definitely has the ability to
do well.
"He should be able to finish in
the top five," he said. "John has
good size for laser sailing and is a
good laser sailor. How he prepares
himself will determine how well
he will do. If he wins we'll be real
ly pumped up."
