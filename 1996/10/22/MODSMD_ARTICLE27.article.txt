# No. 2 Cal defeats Card
## Men's soccer falls prey to the Weenies 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
The men's soccer team dropped anoth
er close game 2-1 to the No. 2 California
Bears on Sunday. With the loss, the Car
dinal is now only one game above .500 at
5-4-4 (1-2-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration), while the Bears (11-2-2, 2-1
MPSF) moved within one win of a MPSF
Mountain Division championship.
Stanford began the game very fiat,
allowing Cal to score just 6 minutes. 42
seconds into the game when freshman
J.V. Ganal crossed the ball to senior Steve
Rullo, who beat a diving Grant Brown.
Stanford's sophomore goalkeeper.
The goal was a wake-up call for the
Cardinal. Following that score, Stanford
outplayed Cal for the rest of the first half,
but Stanford was unable to capitalize on
several scoring opportunities, leaving the
score 1-0 in favor of Cal at intermission.
The beginning of the second half was a
little flat for the Stanford men, but they
recovered quickly to play aggressive and
precise soccer.
"The second half was a little bit ugli
er," said coach Bobby Clark. "Cal effec
tively stopped our counterattacks, switch
ing their play to a more direct style, not
allowing us to intercept many of their
passes, which made it challenging to
mount offensive attacks."
Though the Cardinal played Cal evenly
for most of the second half, the Bears
were able to score again, with the aid of a
moderate headwind, when Juan Luis
Romero centered the ball to Matt New
mark, who headed the ball into the upper
left corner of the net.
With 15 minutes remaining. Stanford
mounted an impressive rally. Stanford

scored with 10 minutes left when junior
defender Brad Davies passed the ball to
junior forward Erik Morrison, who one
touched it past a Cal defender and then
deposited the ball in the back of the net.
As the game concluded, the Cardinal
pressured the Bears on all fronts and
pounded the Cal defense repeatedly but
was unable to convert on several excellent
scoring opportunities.
"It's definitely disappointing," Morri
son said. "We just haven't put it all
together yet. We've been outplaying our
opponents, but we've been unable to put
the ball in the back of the net when we've
needed to."
Stanford has dominated its last three
opponents while producing a 0-1-2 record
during the three-game span.
This loss will clearly put more empha
sis on the rest of the games this season,
but the team takes comfort in the fact
that the Cardinal has already come a long
way this season. Stanford has consistent
ly played high quality soccer against some
of the best soccer teams in the nation, a
tremendous improvement over last year's
5-12-1 showing.
"We need to win the rest of our games,"
Morrison said. "It's disheartening to lose
so many close games after coming a long
way from last year. I guess we just have to
learn how to win. That's what separates
the good teams from the bad ones."
Stanford meets rival UC-Irvine on Fri
day and UC-Santa Barbara on Sunday in
two games which will most likely deter
mine whether or not the Cardinal will
have a winning season.
"We've got to look ahead," Clark said.
"We're doing a lot of things right. We just
have to figure out how we can eke out the
victories against the tough teams."
