William C. Bark, an emeritus history professor
and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, died of
cancer at age 87 on Oct. 11 in Palo Alto.
In a speech he made upon the 1987 announce
ment of a Hoover Institution fellowship in his honor,
Bark expressed a desire to "strengthen the values of
the kind of liberal education to which Stanford was
dedicated when it hailed Ulrich von Hutten's . . . de
claration that 'Die luft der freiheit weht' — 'The
winds of freedom blow.' "
Bark was instrumental in the development of
some of Stanford's best known classes, part of the
History of Western Civilization Program — the pre
cursor of today's Cultures, Ideas and Values Pro
gram — which he directed from 1947 to 1960. Bark's
western civilization course was consistently praised
by alumni.
"He was a very fine gentleman and an excellent
teacher," said former Hoover Institution Director
W. Glenn Campbell, who worked with Bark for

many years.
Bark also taught courses in medieval history and
spent the last several years of his life working on a
book to "prove that the medieval world was not so
bad as people thought," said Campbell.
Bark sought to show that the medieval era was not
the "dark ages" but rather a time in which the
Roman Catholic church saved for humanity the best
parts of classical civilization and laid the ground
work for the modern world.
A native of Tacoma, Wash., Bark came to Stanford
as an undergraduate, receiving a bachelor's in histo
ry in 1931. Bark also completed his master's at Stan
ford before pursuing his doctorate at Cornell Univer
sity.
Both of Bark's children attended Stanford. One of
them, Dennis, majored in history before following in
his father's footsteps to become a senior fellow of the
Hoover Institution. The other, Jared, an art major,
now manufactures picture frames in New York.
Bark is also survived by his wife of 59 years,
Eleanor Carlton Bark, and two grandchildren.
