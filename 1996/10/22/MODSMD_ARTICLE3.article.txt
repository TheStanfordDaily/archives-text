# Redesign proposed
## Minors, awards may be added to undergraduate transcripts 
### Hillary Stamm 
The Registrar's Office is con
sidering reformatting undergrad
uate transcripts to include mi
nors. Future changes could also
mean awards would be listed on
the document.
"As of right now, the only im
mediate thing which needs to hap
pen is the installation of the minor
before the fall grades come out,"
said University Registrar Roger
Printup.
Although the office only plans
to add the minor at this time, the
ASSU has also proposed a more
substantial revamping of the tran
script.
A bill passed by the ASSU Sen

ate last week calls for students to
become involved in the process of
reformatting the transcript.
The senate also requested that
awards for academic and extracur
ricular achievement are recog
nized and encouraged the Regis
trar's Office "to make the tran
script more readable and informa
tive, particularly with regard to
department and course titles "
Complete course titles often do
not fit in the space available on the
transcript.
In a meeting with Printup in
early October, ASSU Vice Presi
dent Nick Thompson and Michael
Putnam, the ASSU's director of
special projects, discussed their
concerns with the current tran
script.
Putnam said his primary worry
is that the current document does
not truly reflect a student's time
at the University. "It is supposed
to be a record of what you take
away from Stanford, and right
now it is completely short of that,"
he said.
Putnam also cited the problem
of abbreviated courses titles, as
well as the lack of recognition of
awards, such as Gardner, Rhodes,
Marshall, Fulbright and Truman
scholarships, as well as dean's
awards and membership in the
Phi Beta Kappa honor society.
"We went to [Printup] initially
because we wanted awards on the
transcript and found out that they
had already initiated a plan to
change the transcript," Putnam
said.
In the long run, Printup said

the goal will be to make the tran
script more readable by redesign
ing several areas.
"Course titles are truncated,
allowing for only 18 characters at
a time," Printup said. "Degrees
and majors are listed together, but
distinctions are located down on
the bottom someplace."
Although Printup recognizes
that there are many problems
with the current transcript, he
said it is not easy to change the
format.
"Reformatting the transcript is
a difficult task," he said.
No specific plans have been for
mulated to do a major reformat
ting of the document. Responsibil
ity for the redesign would lie with
the Office of Information Tech
nology Systems and Services.
The Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement determines what
goes on the transcript. Students
sit on this committee, but the
ASSU would like to make sure
there is more student involve
ment with the redesign process,
Putnam said.

Printup said changing the
transcript to include awards and
achievements is a move that needs
to be evaluated closely.
Printup cited the Gardner Fel
lowship as a good example of an
achievement which is awarded on
account of good deeds rather than
scholastic achievements. This
may not be appropriate for a tran
script, he said.
" There is a question as to
whether or not it is appropriate to
put these types of awards on a
transcript, which is supposed to
be a record of one's academic
achievement," Printup said.
Because there are no immediate
plans to reformat any major part of
the transcript, Printup suggested
that the next step should be to pri
oritize the most important prob
lems of the transcript.
"What needs to happen now is
that we need to come up with a
concrete list," Printup said.
"About 50,000 transcripts are
produced each year," Printup
said. "Certainly, we can make it
more readable to the people out
side of the University."
