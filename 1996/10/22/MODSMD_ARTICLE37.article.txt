o, what are you doing after
graduation?" begins the
barrage of questions. There
is a bit of squirming and hedging
involved as the respondent tries to
sound calm, collected and in control of
the future.
Whether you are looking for a sum
mer internship, part-time work experi
ence or your first full-time job, now is
the time to visit the Career Planning
and Placement Center. A common mis
conception among students is that the
CPPC's sole purpose is to list job open

ings and organize on-campus recruit
ing; in fact, for every level of career
development, the CPPC has an array of
resources to help guide your search.
To orient yourself with the workings
of the CPPC, attend the workshop,
"Getting Started at the CPPC." This
introductory session helps students
structure their activities at the center
and eases feelings of drowning.
Scheduled times are advertised in The
Daily and at the CPPC. A video of the
workshop is also available.
Still feel lost?

"Some students think they need to
come in with a clear plan in mind and a
resume — but they don't," said Lynne
H. Dotson, acting director of the CPPC.
A major role of the CPPC is to help
students with career planning.
One of the most important things
students can do is "answering the ques
tion, 'Who am I?' " Dotson said. "Even
the students who think they know what
they want . . . need to know first who
they are."

the basics: 1) Know yourself; 2)
Research what's out there; 3) Develop
and focus objectives; 4) Create a mar
ketable profile; 5) Strategize the job
search; and finally, 6) Pulverize the
long-awaited interview.
Resources that have proven useful to
students are abundant. The most widely
read materials are the job strategy hand
outs — growing off the flier-tree in the
CPPC — which offer tips on such topics
as writing resumes, networking and
planning careers in areas like the inter
national or the public service sector.
Other services target a more special
ized niche: the organization of on-cam
pus recruiting sessions, for example.
However, these activities can be a dis
traction to those who are still defining
their personal goals.

"If you don't really know exactly
what you want, [the on-campus recruit
ing process] can psych you out and you
end up following the pack and getting
caught up in the competition," said
Aaron Hallmark, Class of '95.
Although Hallmark did find a job
through on-campus recruiting, he wish
es, in retrosect, that he had done more
exploring during his job search.
"You don't stop to think that there
are other avenues to finding what you
want to do," Hallmark said. On-campus
recruiting "is a safe option, (but) people
should look around more on their own."
Going for the "safe option" has
deterred many students from using less
structured resources, such as alumni
contacts, which rely more on student
initiative, Dotson said.

"I think it's helpful to be open to
insecurity, to give yourself some
breathing room and be open to differ
ent opportunities," said Jennifer
James, Class of '96, who is still trying
to figure out the process of networking.
James agreed that taking some risks
could lead to more creative ends.
Students who are curious but not
quite ready for an overwhelming, for
mal job search can stop by the CPPC
for a brief tour from a staff member or
student peer counselor. They can also
schedule a counseling appointment by
calling 725-1789.

Lila LaHood, an international relations
major from the Class of '96, is still unem
ployed and has become well acquainted with
the CPPC. Her resume is available on request.
