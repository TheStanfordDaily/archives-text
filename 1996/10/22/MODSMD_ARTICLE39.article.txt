# The
						Fuzzy Job Search:
## Busting the paradigm that nontechies are doomed 
### Vanessa Hua 
From a distance, you may see
the suits going toward the
Career Planning and
Placement Center, navigating
with bikes, trying not to get
blood on their dress clothes. You '
wonder if you too should be lin
ing up for your future.

You're don't want to go to grad
school — at least not for now —and
you're not sure if you want to teach. So
come June, will the trumpets of Pomp
and Circumstance signal entry into the
Gates of Heaven or Hell?
Your future is not predestined for
tragedy.
"I t's never too late," said Lynne H.
(Dotson, acting director of the
ICPPC.
A student's sense of anxiety is undu
ly increased if he or she is not involved
in investment banking, consulting and
other financial companies who adver

tise in The Daily,
Dotson said.
Yet, jobs do
exist for humanities
majors; students
just have to use
alternative search

methods, according
to Dotson.

Start by contacting everyone
you know: your professors, your
friends, your dad. Network.
The CPPC is a good place to start
for contact addresses, which are locat
ed in binders divided by geographical
location and then job field. Some acad
emic departments may also have job
listings or alumni contacts.
After approaching alumni for infor
mation, ask them for two more refer
rals and branch off from there. You
may connect with someone who has an
open position.
And after you submit your resume,
keep calling human resources. Show
interest.
You're also more skilled than you
might think.
Teamwork, writing ability and ana
lytical thinking are central qualities
that hundreds of technical and liberal
arts companies seek. These attributes
can be a result of extracurricular activ
ities and coursework.
"Don't waste your time studying for

adver
tising," said |
Jeff lorillo, who
graduated from
Stanford in 1984

with an English major and is now
senior vice president and creative
director of Foote, Cone, & Belding, a
San Francisco advertising firm.
"Let the company pay you to learn
the ropes. Instead, learn how to think,
to understand," lorillo said.
Don't despair, however, if you lack
internship experience.
"Students could get an on-campus
internship or one in Palo Alto for a few
hours a week," Dotson said. Even after
graduation, students should look for an
internship which could turn into a job.
Knowledge about your field is cen
tral to your job search and during
interviews. Aside from online
resources, trade publications can give
you that keen edge.
"You wouldn't tell an employer, 'I
am interested in going into medicine'
— that could mean you want to be a
doctor, a nurse, a janitor," lorillo
said. "Know exactly what you want to
do, be focused, be specific. Jobs with
in an agency have distinct roles, with
different responsibilities and
demands."
Finally, don't be discouraged if your
doorway becomes plastered with rejec
tion letters. Margot Buck, a counselor
at the CPPC said, "There's a certain
element of luck involved. But you can
work on everything you can."
So get out there and present your
self.
