# Mirrielees hit by hate crime
## 
### Shoshana Deutschkron David Stein Staff writers 
One or more drunken individuals harassed resi
dents of Mirrielees two weekends ago, shouting re
marks that were derogatory toward homosexuals and
scribbling racial slurs.
In what the police are classifying as a "hate crime,"
one resident, whose name was not released by the police
or the Mirrielees staff, was confronted with cries of
"Fuck fags" and a note reading "Fuck Mexico" on his
neighbor's door.
The suspects tore down fliers and posters through
out the apartment complex, but only one resident's per
sonal items were vandalized in the attack.
"The residents are very ... concerned about this,"
said graduate student Liz Kopelman, resident fellow at
Mirrielees. "The friends of the resident (whose belong
ings were vandalized) were veiy concerned about his
safety."
Although police have no suspects in custody, they
have a physical description of the perpetrator, said
Stanford Police Lt. Del Bandy.

"We're looking for a white male, late 20s to early 30s,
dark hair to his collar, unshaven, about 6 feet 1 inch,
250 pounds, wearing a plaid shirt over a white T-shirt
with blue jeans," Bandy said.
At about 1:45 a.m. Oct. 13, a police officer arrived at
Mirrielees in response to a phone call from a resident.
According to Kopelman, the resident heard
"scratching and scribbling" outside his door. After
opening his door, the resident witnessed a man trying
to remove a "gay pride" flag and a Mexican flag from an
other door, Kopelman explained. Another "gay pride"
flag had already been ripped from the door.
Upon seeing the resident, the man allegedly shout
ed, "Fuck fags. Fuck you," before running away down
the third-floor hall. Kopelman added that the resident
also saw a man and a woman at the end of the hall, both
of whom allegedly were ducking suspiciously behind
doorways and appeared to be accompanying the perpe
trator.
Later the same morning, the resident awoke to dis
cover the note reading "Fuck Mexico" on his neighbor's
door. Bandy said the reporting party believes the same
person committed both crimes.
Resident assistant Juan Neria,
a senior who was present at the
house meetings following the inci
dent, said he was disturbed at the
suspects' complete lack of respect.
"My reaction is that I'm really
upset that this kind of stuff hap
pens in Mirrielees," Neria said.

"Being Mexican, I felt like this was
a personal insult."
In addition, senior Liz Warren,
another Mirrielees RA, said that
there is great concern about the in
cident.
"We're taking this very serious
ly. The residents are dismayed and
sad that it happened at our house,"
Warren said.
Fliers notifying the residents
that Mirrielees has been placed on
a top priority watch by the Stan

ford Police Department have been
posted around the apartment
house.
Although the fliers call for any
information concerning the
crimes, no one has come forward
to talk, Neria said.
The police continue to investi
gate the incidents and, said
Bandy, "would appreciate it if
anyone (who) did see anything
that night .. . would contact the
police department."
