## The
						Redemption of Public Service Careers Gratify Your Urges 
### David Engel 
What do you expect from life, and more
importantly, what does life expect
from you?
A year ago I was unhappy. Ostensibly, every
thing was fine. I was finishing my degree in
computer science; I had flown down to Trilogy
for an interview; I had gone to McKinsey for my
second round. A lot of people thought I was
heading for a sweet corporate job. But I wasn't.
I was asking myself the above question and
coming to terms with my answers.
It was not the first time that I had ever ques
tioned my goals. But with graduation looming, I
felt I was at a crossroads. I could either take a
step toward my convictions or away. I admitted
that being able to say I that I helped write
Microsoft Word 11.0 just wouldn't gratify me in
the end. I began to search for outlets that would
satisfy not my competitive side, but my con
science.
After I left school, I went not to Apple or
Anderson, but to the National
Organization for Women. I learned more
in my time there than I would have in any two
year analyst program.
All too often you can feel small at Stanford —
feel tracked, as if the only viable future direc
tions lie in more schooling or the corporations at
the Career Planning and Placement Center.
These are not your only choices. You should
realize that it is precisely because of your educa
tion that you have the option (and therefore the
responsibility) to make your choice be signifi
cant and to choose / accept / believe that you will
make an impact on this world.
Public service offers an alternative to the cor-

porate track. If consulting does not
interest you, if you don't see the impor
tance of investment banking, then the
solidity of working in a health care clin
ic, helping get legislation through
Congress or running a tutoring pro
gram through a public service organiza
tion may be more appealing.
I am not advocating public service as
a way to gain a broad and valuable
work experience. Nor do I want to por
tray it as cool — an up-and-coming
career option that will help guarantee a

fast-track route to success.
Success is something self-defined.
No one can give you a grade, finally, but
yourself. If you feel that you have a
responsibility to others and owe a debt
to a society that has given you much, if
you see flaws in our system and want
them fixed, or if you want to become an
active participant in the affairs of this
society, then public service is both an
honest and fulfilling career choice.
I do not expect that everyone will do
public service. But I hope that everyone

will think about the rationale and the
impact of their paths. For me, public
service has been an excellent way to
develop and act on what I think, is
important. Although at times I wish for
the solitary comforts of a computer
screen, I am glad that I have chosen a
life with less comfort and more ques
tions.
