## 
### Martin L. Yeung 
In an age of increasing cynicism
and dissatisfaction about govern
ment, Stanford continuously pro
duces students who enter public ser
vice to make a difference, impacting
the lives of millions of people.
Mark Hatfield is one such gradu
ate. After receiving his master's in
political science in 1948, Hatfield has
devoted his life to serving the public
good. This year, he ends a distin
guished 30-year career in the U.S.
Senate. But rather than calling it his
retirement, Hatfield said it will be an
opportunity to maximize his consider
able political experience by teaching in
his home state of Oregon and most
likely becoming a fellow at the Hoover
Institution.
Hatfield said the young people of
today should concentrate on the posi
tive side of public service and should
neither be discouraged by the nega
tivism nor be drawn in by the glamour
of working on Capitol Hill.
"There are many opportunities to

time for community service is an excel
lent way to start, said Hatfield. After
years of speaking with interns from his
office, Hatfield says experience "either
hooks them or drives them away."
There is also the value of the
Stanford name for those seek
ing a career in the public sector.
"Stanford" carries automatic prestige,
respect and connections, Hatfield said.
As a resident assistant in Encina Hall,
he came to know students who are
now famous and influential, such as
Derek Bok, former president of
Harvard University. Additionally,
Hatfield's office hired many Stanford
students who eventually became full
time staffers.
Finally, Hatfield offers hope to
those liberal arts majors who may
want to try a career track other than
politics. In addition to teaching,
Hatfield will be serving on the boards
of several corporations after he leaves
the Senate.
