# Sell Your Soul
## The
						Computer Science Industry Issues An Infernal Invitation 
### Tague Griffith 
You've spent your five years at
Stanford, and there's no way
you're heading back to lowa
after you graduate. Because
Stanford is right in the middle
Silicon Valley, the biggest area of
computer development, it's not
unlikely that you are going to end up
there.
Silicon Valley is a lot like Stanford,
only they pay you to attend. The dress
code at most companies leans toward
shorts and Birks, not suits. Benefits
include sleeping all day via flexible
work hours and often, telecommuting
for those accustomed to classes on
video tape. Fitness facilities or subsi
dized gym memberships will keep you
from missing Arrillaga Family Sports
Center.
So, what do I really need?
The days of whiz kid college
dropouts like Bill Gates making mil
lions are pretty much over.
Corporations such as Apple won't
hire someone without at least a
bachelor's degree, usually in a tech
nical field. There are exceptions —
mostly in startup companies; howev
er, finding them is not easy.
In addition to a degree, companies
expect that you will already be a pro
ficient programmer, independent of
whether you are a hardware or a
software engineer. Completing
CSIO6A won't qualify you for any
jobs.
A bachelor's degree is actually
sufficient for most industry jobs. A
master's is only necessary if you are
an engineer and interested in going
into a corporate research and devel
opment department. Occasionally,
companies have an unwritten
expectation that managers also
have a master's. A doctorate is gen
erally overkill except if you want to
work for corporate research centers
with a very academic bent like
IBM's Almaden Labs, Xerox PARC
or SRI International Corporate
Labs.
The key to landing a job is intern
ships. Networking— not of the
Internet variety— is very important.
Silicon Valley runs on connections.

Finding jobs straight out of college is
difficult if you haven't had at least
one internship. Besides, an intern
ship is a good excuse for not having
to head home for the summer.
To coterm or not to coterm?
The first thing to figure out is if
you can squeeze another Stanford
degree out of mommy and daddy.
Master's degrees aren't worthless,
but should be carefully considered.
Before you see a significant salary
increase because of your master's,
you will need two years of industry
experience. If you do go to work
before getting that second diploma,
ask your company about tuition
assistance.
If you plan on working before
going to graduate school, take your
GREs and subject exams prior to
graduation. It is easier to take the
GREs before leaving school than after
you have started working. Test scores
are good for five years, so get them
out of the way while you still remem
ber the material.
Great, but I'm a fuzzy
Don't eliminate Silicon Valley
from your career plans just because
ycu don't have a techie degree.
Engineers alone can't run the world.
Evangelism positions, which are
part marketing, part spokesmodel,
are essential. You get to convert the
heathen masses to using your com
pany's products.
With the growth of the Internet
and the World Wide Web, there is
also a great demand for writers and
designers to build Web sites.
Regardless of your degree or
interests, there is probably a job
available in Silicon Valley that will
suit you. You're already right in the
Bay Area — take advantage of all it
has to offer. Believe me, working in
Silicon Valley is easier than slaving
in the corn fields.
