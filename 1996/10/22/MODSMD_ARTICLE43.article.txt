# An Interview with Shirley Hufstedler An Alumna to Lionize
## 
### Elisabeth Morse 
Shirley Hufstedler, who graduated from
Stanford Law School in 1949, has had a
career that any Stanford student would envy.
In 1968, Hufstedler was the second woman
to be appointed to a judgeship as highly
placed as the U.S. Court of Appeals (for the
Ninth Circuit). In 1979, President Carter
created the Department of Education, and
Hufstedler left the bench to become the first
secretary of education. Hufstedler returned
to private practice as an attorney in 1981
(she is now with Los Angeles firm Morrison
& Foerster) and has argued before the
Supreme Court countless times. In 1992,
when wooed by President Clinton for the
position of attorney general, Hufstedler was

able to tell fellow Stanford alumnus Warren
Christopher that she was too old to be flying
all over the country and so was he.
Hufstedler's personal style is strictly no
nonsense. She does not say hello when
she picks up the phone and does not waste
time on pleasantries. Hufstedler is not
brusque; rather, she is time-efficient, which is
wonderfully beneficial to anyone with a busy
schedule. In our conversation, she answered
all questions clearly, intelligently and honest
ly The final impression she gives is of some
one who is convinced of herself, knows what
she wants and will work hard and seriously at
any project she dedicates her time to.
