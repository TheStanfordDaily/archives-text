# An Interview with Shirley Hufstedler An Alumna to Lionize
## 
### Elisabeth Morse 
Shirley Hufstedler, who graduated from
Stanford Law School in 1949, has had a
career that any Stanford student would envy.
In 1968, Hufstedler was the second woman
to be appointed to a judgeship as highly
placed as the U.S. Court of Appeals (for the
Ninth Circuit). In 1979, President Carter
created the Department of Education, and
Hufstedler left the bench to become the first
secretary of education. Hufstedler returned
to private practice as an attorney in 1981
(she is now with Los Angeles firm Morrison
& Foerster) and has argued before the
Supreme Court countless times. In 1992,
when wooed by President Clinton for the
position of attorney general, Hufstedler was

able to tell fellow Stanford alumnus Warren
Christopher that she was too old to be flying
all over the country and so was he.
Hufstedler's personal style is strictly no
nonsense. She does not say hello when
she picks up the phone and does not waste
time on pleasantries. Hufstedler is not
brusque; rather, she is time-efficient, which is
wonderfully beneficial to anyone with a busy
schedule. In our conversation, she answered
all questions clearly, intelligently and honest
ly The final impression she gives is of some
one who is convinced of herself, knows what
she wants and will work hard and seriously at
any project she dedicates her time to.

Shirley Hufstedler In her Carter days.
Morse: Do you have any particular mem
ories of Stanford which are particularly
vivid or important to you ?
Hufstedler: Oh, of course. The one most
outstanding memory is that that's where
I met my husband [Seth Hufstedler].
M: He was in your class at the Law
School?
H: We were in the same class and we
were both on the law review and we
knew each other from the very early
beginnings of law school. But we became
very close friends and ultimately roman
tic lovers by the time we had finished our
third year.

'Practicing law at high
levels is extremely diffi
cult and takes an enor
mous amount of labor.
That's true whether you
are male or female.'

Of course there are many other mem
ories of Stanford — of individual profes
sors, of my classmates, of all kinds of
long hours in the library, many walks
through the arches at all different times
of the night... many of them beautiful,
many of them exhausting, some of them
sopping wet.
And, of course of the Sundays when
the chapel snappers came by. I mean
people who kept taking photographs of
the chapel. The Law School at that time
was located on the Inner Quad.
Obviously, we saw a great many of them.
And since we worked every Sunday, we
wouldn't miss the tourists.
M: I know that you went to law school
when there weren't many women who
did. Did you find that difficult ?
H: No, I didn't think so. I was very well
treated. There was another woman in
my class.
M: So there were just two?
H: Yes, there were five of us who started
out in the largest class that was admitted
to Stanford Law School. It was the class
that entered just after the end of the sec
ond world war. More than half the class
was on terminal military leave.
It wasn't that women weren't admit
ted to Stanford; women just didn't apply.
Of the five who entered, three dropped
out — not because they were academical
ly disqualified, but because they decided
they didn't like it. And then there was

another woman I graduated with.
But of course that was sort of a moot
point anyway, because by the time I took
the bar the following October after grad
uation there were seven of us women in
the state of California who were admit
ted to the bar that year. So it was not an
occasion of being excluded, but rather
that the social dictates and the profes
sional dictates were extremely strong
that women should not go into the prac
tice of law.
M: Have you found it very difficult being
a "woman pioneer," having all of these
"first" positions . . . first woman to do
this, first woman to gain that. .. ?
H: No, I've not had a problem because I
was female. Practicing law at high levels
is extremely difficult and takes an enor
mous amount of labor. That's true
whether you are male or female.
M: I did some research about the kinds of
cases you have taken and found that you
are very active in terms of what you
believe in, what you think is right. How
do you feel about the "politically correct"
brand of activism that is so prevalent at
Stanford these days?
H: Well, I have not ever been fond of the
terminology of politically correct. I find
that attempting to revive both history
and the total vocabulary into an age that
is not my own is difficult. And 1 find it
hard to write in such a way that I have to
describe a group of people in terms of all
the various colors of the spectrum and to
find what is not offensive to any minority
group or to females. I think it has gone
too far, and yes the vocabulary is sexist,
but we can't erase hundreds of years of
history because it makes someone
uncomfortable.
M: It is interesting that we should dis
cuss what is appropriate to each of our
own eras. I watched the first presidential
debate, and I noted that one of the things
Bill Clinton talked about was that every
18-year-old should be able to use the
Internet. Do you think perhaps that is
going too far ?
H: I think it is definitely true that with
young people growing up today, it is as
important to literacy in the present sense
to be computer literate as it was in my
era to be literate with a pen and pencil.
However, that does not mean that I
think there is some educational nirvana
waiting there because someone can tune
into the Internet. There is, of course, a
lot of good material on it. But at the
same time, there is a lot of junk too. And
besides, there is just too much. It is not
sorted in a way which permits you —
without having to go through everything
— to sort out the wheat from the chaff.

So, a lot of the Internet time is simply
not particularly productive. Some things
are, but a person has to know what to
discard and how to edit what one is going
to look at. And that takes a lot more time
and incentive than I think it's worth.
M: Now would you say that about every
thing which is taught... that the educa
tional system should be more selective
about prioritizing ?
H: I'm not sure that one could say that.
Because what would be a priority to one
student is not necessarily going to be
another's. What you are trying to do in
education is to help people be able to
have access to the tools of learning one
will need for the rest of one's life. And
how each child learns depends very much
on that individual child's makeup. Some
youngsters are going to learn the so
called basics far better if they move into
it through the arts, for example. Others
are going to learn basics by learning
sports. ... So I don't think that the way
to say it is the blanket way. It is what is
the method that the teacher can use to
reach that child or that young adult.
Teaching is not really a skill, it's an art.
M: You actually taught at Stanford Law
School among other places. Do you enjoy
teaching?

'Well, the disadvantages of
having a very public posi
tion — not so much on the
bench but certainly in the
Cabinet — Ls that you have
no privacy at all.'

//. Yes. In fact, I have taught all over 'he
world from the elegant institutions like
Oxford and Stanford, to brown-back
schools, to sitting in camps at 16 or 17
thousand feet teaching children and
sometimes their parents to help me have
them teach me . . . lots of places. I've
taught all ages. I've taught in commer
cial schools, high schools, universities . . .
because I er\joy teaching, and I've spent a
lot of time teaching judges when I was on
the bench.
Because it is true, as you well know,
the old adage: "The teacher learns more
from whom she teaches." True. I always
learn more than I teach. And preparing
to teach and to respond to the questions
oft-times which are very original, it does
provoke a lot of thought. So yes, I've
always enjoyed it. I've tried to teach
someplace every year. I haven't made it
some years, but most years I have been
able to teach.
M: May I ask what qualities you feel
are important to becoming a good
judge?
II: Well, first, one has to have the basic
qualities of a good education and a
sense of curiosity, of course. But per
haps even more important than sharp
intellectual brilliance is to have an
appreciation for the quality of human
ness and what is loosely called judicial
temperament. With trial courtrooms, it
is critically important that the witness
es and the jurors, that everyone con
nected with it be treated with steady
courtesy. And with the kinds of things
you would expect with anybody — to be
polite, that judges should be on time,
that they should get their work done as
promptly as is practicable given their
case loads and the exigencies of other
matters that have come up when they
are on a trial bench, or on an appellate
bench for that matter.
You have to be able if you are going
to be a judge to make up your mind
because whether right or wrong it is
important to have people get the deci
sion. People can always understand it
much better even if they lose if judges
explain why that person lost. Some
people care a great deal about why they
won, but more people care more deeply
about why they lost.
M: When you were being perused by
President Clinton for the position of
attorney general, 1 noticed that you
said you were very happy in private
life. Would you please talk about the
advantages and disadvantages of hav
ing an extremely public existence ?
//. Well, the disadvantages of having a
very public position — not so much on
the bench but certainly in the Cabinet
— is that you have no privacy at all.
When you are on the Cabinet, you have
to be reachable by phone somehow at
all times. I couldn't walk from my
apartment to the corner drugstore on
Saturday without calling the White
House operator to let them know when
I was going and what time I would be
back. Because Cabinet officers can
never be out of pocket. I found that
very difficult because I have been
essentially a very private person.
You can be a much more private per
son except under very unusual circum
stances on the bench. I like to be with
my family, and I like to have my fami
ly's business my family's business and
not a matter of discussion generally.
I think the hot light of publicity on
public figures has reached the point
that too many able people simply will

not do it. I found that very difficult. I
found it very difficult in the Cabinet
not to be able to talk to a group of
staffers on issues I was considering and
having a Socratic debate. Because
when I was on the bench, those discus
sions were all confidential. But when I
was in Washington, I would see in the
trade papers the next morning that I
had made a decision that I had in fact
never made; I was just asking ques
tions.
In high political positions like the
Cabinet for example, one is under con
stant scrutiny by the press and it's dif
ficult to have the time for adequate
reflections. Apart from working very
hard on the bench, I always had
enough time for what I thought suffi
cient reflection to think carefully about
the most difficult issues.
But private life is wonderful.
Yet, I still lead a rather public life in
many ways. I have just undertaken
another job which indicates I haven't
turned into a shrinking violet. The
White House has asked me, and I
accepted, of taking over the chairman
ship of the United States Commission
on Immigration Reform.
M: Congratulations!
H: And condolences. But needless to
say those issues are very decisive. The
commission has been in existence since
1990. The late Barbara Jordan was
chair and then when Barbara died, the

White House asked me to do this, as
well as doing everything else I always
do. But at least I get to spend quiet
time with my family and close friends,
which is a blessing.
M: Finally, to bring this back to the
Stanford angle, I noticed that you were
on the board of Hewlett-Packard Co.,
which is a very Stanford-based corpo
ration. How did that happen ?
H: Well, Bill Hewlett and I had served
on several different committees togeth
er while I was still on the bench. That
is, we were both on the committee
choosing White House Fellows, we
were both on committees to choose
Rhodes Scholars. So we knew each
other, and we had worked together in a
number of intense sessions for some
long time.
Of course, HP like so many other
major companies didn't have any
women on the board, and they were
beginning to develop a lot of very good
female engineers and female human
resources people. And of course their
customers were increasingly female, as
well. So HP set out to look for somebody
and there weren't very many people
around who had national visibility and
understood a lot about government and
understood a lot about law and the judi
ciary, and who also was, of course, a
Stanford graduate. So I was invited to
join the board and I did. I just retired
and became emeritus this last spring.

a "woman pioneer," having all of these
"first" positions . . . first woman to do
this, first woman to gain that. .. ?
H: No, I've not had a problem because I
was female. Practicing law at high levels
is extremely difficult and takes an enor
mous amount of labor. That's true
whether you are male or female.
M: I did some research about the kinds of
cases you have taken and found that you
are very active in terms of what you
believe in, what you think is right. How
do you feel about the "politically correct"
brand of activism that is so prevalent at
Stanford these days?
H: Well, I have not ever been fond of the
terminology of politically correct. I find
that attempting to revive both history
and the total vocabulary into an age that
is not my own is difficult. And 1 find it
hard to write in such a way that I have to
describe a group of people in terms of all
the various colors of the spectrum and to
find what is not offensive to any minority
group or to females. I think it has gone
too far, and yes the vocabulary is sexist,
but we can't erase hundreds of years of
history because it makes someone
uncomfortable.
M: It is interesting that we should dis
cuss what is appropriate to each of our
own eras. I watched the first presidential
debate, and I noted that one of the things
Bill Clinton talked about was that every
18-year-old should be able to use the
Internet. Do you think perhaps that is
going too far ?
H: I think it is definitely true that with
young people growing up today, it is as
important to literacy in the present sense
to be computer literate as it was in my
era to be literate with a pen and pencil.
However, that does not mean that I
think there is some educational nirvana
waiting there because someone can tune
into the Internet. There is, of course, a
lot of good material on it. But at the
same time, there is a lot of junk too. And
besides, there is just too much. It is not
sorted in a way which permits you —
without having to go through everything
— to sort out the wheat from the chaff.

So, a lot of the Internet time is simply
not particularly productive. Some things
are, but a person has to know what to
discard and how to edit what one is going
to look at. And that takes a lot more time
and incentive than I think it's worth.
M: Now would you say that about every
thing which is taught... that the educa
tional system should be more selective
about prioritizing ?
H: I'm not sure that one could say that.
Because what would be a priority to one
student is not necessarily going to be
another's. What you are trying to do in
education is to help people be able to
have access to the tools of learning one
will need for the rest of one's life. And
how each child learns depends very much
on that individual child's makeup. Some
youngsters are going to learn the so
called basics far better if they move into
it through the arts, for example. Others
are going to learn basics by learning
sports. ... So I don't think that the way
to say it is the blanket way. It is what is
the method that the teacher can use to
reach that child or that young adult.
Teaching is not really a skill, it's an art.
M: You actually taught at Stanford Law
School among other places. Do you enjoy
teaching?

'Well, the disadvantages of
having a very public posi
tion — not so much on the
bench but certainly in the
Cabinet — Ls that you have
no privacy at all.'

//. Yes. In fact, I have taught all over 'he
world from the elegant institutions like
Oxford and Stanford, to brown-back
schools, to sitting in camps at 16 or 17
thousand feet teaching children and
sometimes their parents to help me have
them teach me . . . lots of places. I've
taught all ages. I've taught in commer
cial schools, high schools, universities . . .
because I er\joy teaching, and I've spent a
lot of time teaching judges when I was on
the bench.
Because it is true, as you well know,
the old adage: "The teacher learns more
from whom she teaches." True. I always
learn more than I teach. And preparing
to teach and to respond to the questions
oft-times which are very original, it does
provoke a lot of thought. So yes, I've
always enjoyed it. I've tried to teach
someplace every year. I haven't made it
some years, but most years I have been
able to teach.
M: May I ask what qualities you feel
are important to becoming a good
judge?
II: Well, first, one has to have the basic
qualities of a good education and a
sense of curiosity, of course. But per
haps even more important than sharp
intellectual brilliance is to have an
appreciation for the quality of human
ness and what is loosely called judicial
temperament. With trial courtrooms, it
is critically important that the witness
es and the jurors, that everyone con
nected with it be treated with steady
courtesy. And with the kinds of things
you would expect with anybody — to be
polite, that judges should be on time,
that they should get their work done as
promptly as is practicable given their
case loads and the exigencies of other
matters that have come up when they
are on a trial bench, or on an appellate
bench for that matter.
You have to be able if you are going
to be a judge to make up your mind
because whether right or wrong it is
important to have people get the deci
sion. People can always understand it
much better even if they lose if judges
explain why that person lost. Some
people care a great deal about why they
won, but more people care more deeply
about why they lost.
M: When you were being perused by
President Clinton for the position of
attorney general, 1 noticed that you
said you were very happy in private
life. Would you please talk about the
advantages and disadvantages of hav
ing an extremely public existence ?
//. Well, the disadvantages of having a
very public position — not so much on
the bench but certainly in the Cabinet
— is that you have no privacy at all.
When you are on the Cabinet, you have
to be reachable by phone somehow at
all times. I couldn't walk from my
apartment to the corner drugstore on
Saturday without calling the White
House operator to let them know when
I was going and what time I would be
back. Because Cabinet officers can
never be out of pocket. I found that
very difficult because I have been
essentially a very private person.
You can be a much more private per
son except under very unusual circum
stances on the bench. I like to be with
my family, and I like to have my fami
ly's business my family's business and
not a matter of discussion generally.
I think the hot light of publicity on
public figures has reached the point
that too many able people simply will

not do it. I found that very difficult. I
found it very difficult in the Cabinet
not to be able to talk to a group of
staffers on issues I was considering and
having a Socratic debate. Because
when I was on the bench, those discus
sions were all confidential. But when I
was in Washington, I would see in the
trade papers the next morning that I
had made a decision that I had in fact
never made; I was just asking ques
tions.
In high political positions like the
Cabinet for example, one is under con
stant scrutiny by the press and it's dif
ficult to have the time for adequate
reflections. Apart from working very
hard on the bench, I always had
enough time for what I thought suffi
cient reflection to think carefully about
the most difficult issues.
But private life is wonderful.
Yet, I still lead a rather public life in
many ways. I have just undertaken
another job which indicates I haven't
turned into a shrinking violet. The
White House has asked me, and I
accepted, of taking over the chairman
ship of the United States Commission
on Immigration Reform.
M: Congratulations!
H: And condolences. But needless to
say those issues are very decisive. The
commission has been in existence since
1990. The late Barbara Jordan was
chair and then when Barbara died, the

White House asked me to do this, as
well as doing everything else I always
do. But at least I get to spend quiet
time with my family and close friends,
which is a blessing.
M: Finally, to bring this back to the
Stanford angle, I noticed that you were
on the board of Hewlett-Packard Co.,
which is a very Stanford-based corpo
ration. How did that happen ?
H: Well, Bill Hewlett and I had served
on several different committees togeth
er while I was still on the bench. That
is, we were both on the committee
choosing White House Fellows, we
were both on committees to choose
Rhodes Scholars. So we knew each
other, and we had worked together in a
number of intense sessions for some
long time.
Of course, HP like so many other
major companies didn't have any
women on the board, and they were
beginning to develop a lot of very good
female engineers and female human
resources people. And of course their
customers were increasingly female, as
well. So HP set out to look for somebody
and there weren't very many people
around who had national visibility and
understood a lot about government and
understood a lot about law and the judi
ciary, and who also was, of course, a
Stanford graduate. So I was invited to
join the board and I did. I just retired
and became emeritus this last spring.
Shirley Hufstedler, who graduated from
Stanford Law School in 1949, has had a
career that any Stanford student would envy.
In 1968, Hufstedler was the second woman
to be appointed to a judgeship as highly
placed as the U.S. Court of Appeals (for the
Ninth Circuit). In 1979, President Carter
created the Department of Education, and
Hufstedler left the bench to become the first
secretary of education. Hufstedler returned
to private practice as an attorney in 1981
(she is now with Los Angeles firm Morrison
& Foerster) and has argued before the
Supreme Court countless times. In 1992,
when wooed by President Clinton for the
position of attorney general, Hufstedler was

able to tell fellow Stanford alumnus Warren
Christopher that she was too old to be flying
all over the country and so was he.
Hufstedler's personal style is strictly no
nonsense. She does not say hello when
she picks up the phone and does not waste
time on pleasantries. Hufstedler is not
brusque; rather, she is time-efficient, which is
wonderfully beneficial to anyone with a busy
schedule. In our conversation, she answered
all questions clearly, intelligently and honest
ly The final impression she gives is of some
one who is convinced of herself, knows what
she wants and will work hard and seriously at
any project she dedicates her time to.

Shirley Hufstedler In her Carter days.
Morse: Do you have any particular mem
ories of Stanford which are particularly
vivid or important to you ?
Hufstedler: Oh, of course. The one most
outstanding memory is that that's where
I met my husband [Seth Hufstedler].
M: He was in your class at the Law
School?
H: We were in the same class and we
were both on the law review and we
knew each other from the very early
beginnings of law school. But we became
very close friends and ultimately roman
tic lovers by the time we had finished our
third year.

'Practicing law at high
levels is extremely diffi
cult and takes an enor
mous amount of labor.
That's true whether you
are male or female.'

Of course there are many other mem
ories of Stanford — of individual profes
sors, of my classmates, of all kinds of
long hours in the library, many walks
through the arches at all different times
of the night... many of them beautiful,
many of them exhausting, some of them
sopping wet.
And, of course of the Sundays when
the chapel snappers came by. I mean
people who kept taking photographs of
the chapel. The Law School at that time
was located on the Inner Quad.
Obviously, we saw a great many of them.
And since we worked every Sunday, we
wouldn't miss the tourists.
M: I know that you went to law school
when there weren't many women who
did. Did you find that difficult ?
H: No, I didn't think so. I was very well
treated. There was another woman in
my class.
M: So there were just two?
H: Yes, there were five of us who started
out in the largest class that was admitted
to Stanford Law School. It was the class
that entered just after the end of the sec
ond world war. More than half the class
was on terminal military leave.
It wasn't that women weren't admit
ted to Stanford; women just didn't apply.
Of the five who entered, three dropped
out — not because they were academical
ly disqualified, but because they decided
they didn't like it. And then there was

another woman I graduated with.
But of course that was sort of a moot
point anyway, because by the time I took
the bar the following October after grad
uation there were seven of us women in
the state of California who were admit
ted to the bar that year. So it was not an
occasion of being excluded, but rather
that the social dictates and the profes
sional dictates were extremely strong
that women should not go into the prac
tice of law.
M: Have you found it very difficult being
a "woman pioneer," having all of these
"first" positions . . . first woman to do
this, first woman to gain that. .. ?

Because it is true, as you well know,
the old adage: "The teacher learns more
from whom she teaches." True. I always
learn more than I teach. And preparing
to teach and to respond to the questions
oft-times which are very original, it does
provoke a lot of thought. So yes, I've
always enjoyed it. I've tried to teach
someplace every year. I haven't made it
some years, but most years I have been
able to teach.
M: May I ask what qualities you feel
are important to becoming a good
judge?
II: Well, first, one has to have the basic
qualities of a good education and a
sense of curiosity, of course. But per
haps even more important than sharp
intellectual brilliance is to have an
appreciation for the quality of human
ness and what is loosely called judicial
temperament. With trial courtrooms, it
is critically important that the witness
es and the jurors, that everyone con
nected with it be treated with steady
courtesy. And with the kinds of things
you would expect with anybody — to be
polite, that judges should be on time,
that they should get their work done as
promptly as is practicable given their
case loads and the exigencies of other
matters that have come up when they
are on a trial bench, or on an appellate
bench for that matter.
You have to be able if you are going
to be a judge to make up your mind
because whether right or wrong it is
important to have people get the deci
sion. People can always understand it
much better even if they lose if judges
explain why that person lost. Some
people care a great deal about why they
won, but more people care more deeply
about why they lost.
M: When you were being perused by
President Clinton for the position of
attorney general, 1 noticed that you
said you were very happy in private
life. Would you please talk about the
advantages and disadvantages of hav
ing an extremely public existence ?
//. Well, the disadvantages of having a
very public position — not so much on
the bench but certainly in the Cabinet
— is that you have no privacy at all.
When you are on the Cabinet, you have
to be reachable by phone somehow at
all times. I couldn't walk from my
apartment to the corner drugstore on
Saturday without calling the White
House operator to let them know when
I was going and what time I would be
back. Because Cabinet officers can
never be out of pocket. I found that
very difficult because I have been
essentially a very private person.
You can be a much more private per
son except under very unusual circum
stances on the bench. I like to be with
my family, and I like to have my fami
ly's business my family's business and
not a matter of discussion generally.
I think the hot light of publicity on
public figures has reached the point
that too many able people simply will

not do it. I found that very difficult. I
found it very difficult in the Cabinet
not to be able to talk to a group of
staffers on issues I was considering and
having a Socratic debate. Because
when I was on the bench, those discus
sions were all confidential. But when I
was in Washington, I would see in the
trade papers the next morning that I
had made a decision that I had in fact
never made; I was just asking ques
tions.
In high political positions like the
Cabinet for example, one is under con
stant scrutiny by the press and it's dif
ficult to have the time for adequate
reflections. Apart from working very
hard on the bench, I always had
enough time for what I thought suffi
cient reflection to think carefully about
the most difficult issues.
But private life is wonderful.
Yet, I still lead a rather public life in
many ways. I have just undertaken
another job which indicates I haven't
turned into a shrinking violet. The
White House has asked me, and I
accepted, of taking over the chairman
ship of the United States Commission
on Immigration Reform.
M: Congratulations!
H: And condolences. But needless to
say those issues are very decisive. The
commission has been in existence since
1990. The late Barbara Jordan was
chair and then when Barbara died, the

White House asked me to do this, as
well as doing everything else I always
do. But at least I get to spend quiet
time with my family and close friends,
which is a blessing.
M: Finally, to bring this back to the
Stanford angle, I noticed that you were
on the board of Hewlett-Packard Co.,
which is a very Stanford-based corpo
ration. How did that happen ?
H: Well, Bill Hewlett and I had served
on several different committees togeth
er while I was still on the bench. That
is, we were both on the committee
choosing White House Fellows, we
were both on committees to choose
Rhodes Scholars. So we knew each
other, and we had worked together in a
number of intense sessions for some
long time.
Of course, HP like so many other
major companies didn't have any
women on the board, and they were
beginning to develop a lot of very good
female engineers and female human
resources people. And of course their
customers were increasingly female, as
well. So HP set out to look for somebody
and there weren't very many people
around who had national visibility and
understood a lot about government and
understood a lot about law and the judi
ciary, and who also was, of course, a
Stanford graduate. So I was invited to
join the board and I did. I just retired
and became emeritus this last spring.
Shirley Hufstedler, who graduated from
Stanford Law School in 1949, has had a
career that any Stanford student would envy.
In 1968, Hufstedler was the second woman
to be appointed to a judgeship as highly
placed as the U.S. Court of Appeals (for the
Ninth Circuit). In 1979, President Carter
created the Department of Education, and
Hufstedler left the bench to become the first
secretary of education. Hufstedler returned
to private practice as an attorney in 1981
(she is now with Los Angeles firm Morrison
& Foerster) and has argued before the
Supreme Court countless times. In 1992,
when wooed by President Clinton for the
position of attorney general, Hufstedler was

able to tell fellow Stanford alumnus Warren
Christopher that she was too old to be flying
all over the country and so was he.
Hufstedler's personal style is strictly no
nonsense. She does not say hello when
she picks up the phone and does not waste
time on pleasantries. Hufstedler is not
brusque; rather, she is time-efficient, which is
wonderfully beneficial to anyone with a busy
schedule. In our conversation, she answered
all questions clearly, intelligently and honest
ly The final impression she gives is of some
one who is convinced of herself, knows what
she wants and will work hard and seriously at
any project she dedicates her time to.

Shirley Hufstedler In her Carter days.
Morse: Do you have any particular mem
ories of Stanford which are particularly
vivid or important to you ?
Hufstedler: Oh, of course. The one most
outstanding memory is that that's where
I met my husband [Seth Hufstedler].
M: He was in your class at the Law
School?
H: We were in the same class and we
were both on the law review and we
knew each other from the very early
beginnings of law school. But we became
very close friends and ultimately roman
tic lovers by the time we had finished our
third year.

'Practicing law at high
levels is extremely diffi
cult and takes an enor
mous amount of labor.
That's true whether you
are male or female.'

Of course there are many other mem
ories of Stanford — of individual profes
sors, of my classmates, of all kinds of
long hours in the library, many walks
through the arches at all different times
of the night... many of them beautiful,
many of them exhausting, some of them
sopping wet.
And, of course of the Sundays when
the chapel snappers came by. I mean
people who kept taking photographs of
the chapel. The Law School at that time
was located on the Inner Quad.
Obviously, we saw a great many of them.
And since we worked every Sunday, we
wouldn't miss the tourists.
M: I know that you went to law school
when there weren't many women who
did. Did you find that difficult ?
H: No, I didn't think so. I was very well
treated. There was another woman in
my class.
M: So there were just two?
H: Yes, there were five of us who started
out in the largest class that was admitted
to Stanford Law School. It was the class
that entered just after the end of the sec
ond world war. More than half the class
was on terminal military leave.
It wasn't that women weren't admit
ted to Stanford; women just didn't apply.
Of the five who entered, three dropped
out — not because they were academical
ly disqualified, but because they decided
they didn't like it. And then there was

another woman I graduated with.
But of course that was sort of a moot
point anyway, because by the time I took
the bar the following October after grad
uation there were seven of us women in
the state of California who were admit
ted to the bar that year. So it was not an
occasion of being excluded, but rather
that the social dictates and the profes
sional dictates were extremely strong
that women should not go into the prac
tice of law.
M: Have you found it very difficult being
a "woman pioneer," having all of these
"first" positions . . . first woman to do
this, first woman to gain that. .. ?
H: No, I've not had a problem because I
was female. Practicing law at high levels
is extremely difficult and takes an enor
mous amount of labor. That's true
whether you are male or female.
M: I did some research about the kinds of
cases you have taken and found that you
are very active in terms of what you
believe in, what you think is right. How
do you feel about the "politically correct"
brand of activism that is so prevalent at
Stanford these days?
H: Well, I have not ever been fond of the
terminology of politically correct. I find
that attempting to revive both history
and the total vocabulary into an age that
is not my own is difficult. And 1 find it
hard to write in such a way that I have to
describe a group of people in terms of all
the various colors of the spectrum and to
find what is not offensive to any minority
group or to females. I think it has gone
too far, and yes the vocabulary is sexist,
but we can't erase hundreds of years of
history because it makes someone
uncomfortable.
M: It is interesting that we should dis
cuss what is appropriate to each of our
own eras. I watched the first presidential
debate, and I noted that one of the things
Bill Clinton talked about was that every
18-year-old should be able to use the
Internet. Do you think perhaps that is
going too far ?
H: I think it is definitely true that with
young people growing up today, it is as
important to literacy in the present sense
to be computer literate as it was in my
era to be literate with a pen and pencil.
However, that does not mean that I
think there is some educational nirvana
waiting there because someone can tune
into the Internet. There is, of course, a
lot of good material on it. But at the
same time, there is a lot of junk too. And
besides, there is just too much. It is not
sorted in a way which permits you —
without having to go through everything
— to sort out the wheat from the chaff.

So, a lot of the Internet time is simply
not particularly productive. Some things
are, but a person has to know what to
discard and how to edit what one is going
to look at. And that takes a lot more time
and incentive than I think it's worth.
M: Now would you say that about every
thing which is taught... that the educa
tional system should be more selective
about prioritizing ?
H: I'm not sure that one could say that.
Because what would be a priority to one
student is not necessarily going to be
another's. What you are trying to do in
education is to help people be able to
have access to the tools of learning one
will need for the rest of one's life. And
how each child learns depends very much
on that individual child's makeup. Some
youngsters are going to learn the so
called basics far better if they move into
it through the arts, for example. Others
are going to learn basics by learning
sports. ... So I don't think that the way
to say it is the blanket way. It is what is
the method that the teacher can use to
reach that child or that young adult.
Teaching is not really a skill, it's an art.
M: You actually taught at Stanford Law
School among other places. Do you enjoy
teaching?

'Well, the disadvantages of
having a very public posi
tion — not so much on the
bench but certainly in the
Cabinet — Ls that you have
no privacy at all.'

//. Yes. In fact, I have taught all over 'he
world from the elegant institutions like
Oxford and Stanford, to brown-back
schools, to sitting in camps at 16 or 17
thousand feet teaching children and
sometimes their parents to help me have
them teach me . . . lots of places. I've
taught all ages. I've taught in commer
cial schools, high schools, universities . . .
because I er\joy teaching, and I've spent a
lot of time teaching judges when I was on
the bench.
Because it is true, as you well know,
the old adage: "The teacher learns more
from whom she teaches." True. I always
learn more than I teach. And preparing
to teach and to respond to the questions
oft-times which are very original, it does
provoke a lot of thought. So yes, I've
always enjoyed it. I've tried to teach
someplace every year. I haven't made it
