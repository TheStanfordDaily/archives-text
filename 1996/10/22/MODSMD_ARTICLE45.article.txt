# Existentially Challenged:
## Living Without a Purpose

"We are the 'p'-word," M says.
"Poor?" I reply.
"You'll know the 'p'-word if you are the 'p'-word," M
retorts mischievously.
"The word is pathetic," E clarifies.
By any standard of success with which we are familiar,
my friends and I would likely be considered pathetic.
Neither are we employed with a salary greater than
the Stanford tuition, nor is any of us attending law school,
medical school or a prestigious doctoral program. Rather,
E and I are jobless housemates who seem forever Stanford
bound; M lives at home and toils uneventfully campus
side. The three of us have moved on, just not ahead. Not
very far away, even.
We aren't too pleased with the future that is becoming
our present, except maybe when we revel in one another's
complaints. We're entitled to feel jaded and gyped, unable
to explain why our Stanford degrees have left us with
empty pockets and a heavy nostalgia that makes our cur
rent situation seem all the more stagnant. It's about cause
and effect, with so little effect. Which is all the more excru
ciating, because after Stanford we're used to results.

Perhaps we've bought into the system of means and ends
so completely that we are too shortsighted to think about
our situation in any other way.
Chance gives an explanation to what we can't reason
away. I don't intend to sound fatalistic or to justify a slack
er ethic; rather, it just seems that the prevalence of chance
becomes all the more powerful when a structured life falls
apart.
These thoughts crystallized as my front bumper glanced
off unseen oncoming traffic. The events leading up to the
fender bender had no correlation to the accident itself —
uh, except for my carelessness. Everything came together
(my bumper and the other driver's side panel, for two) in
that instant — regardless of plot or plan, cause and effect.

'We aren't too pleased with the
future that is becoming our pre
sent, except maybe when we revel
in one another's complaints.
We're entitled to feel jaded and
gyped, unable to explain why our
Stanford degrees have left us with
empty pockets and a heavy nos
talgia that makes our current situ
ation seem all the more stagnant.'

Pondering the accident, I've come to recognize that my
aimless post-graduation existence has been defined by coin
cidences. I found a fiat in the bleak San Francisco housing
market by walking an extra block, exhorted by a realtor
looking for a tenant. I've found friends in crosswalks and
down the street in the span of one city block and run into
my favorite band eating in a restaurant half the world
away. E and I and another friend bumped into each other
on the Internet, an astounding coincidence because we
logged on from Dublin, Vienna and Stanford respectively.
"Huh?" M intones. "So what's this got to do with getting
jobs and making our lives un-pathetic?"
I can't give M an answer, because I'd be employed if
coming to terms with chance offered that sort of advice. If
there's a point to the pointlessness of blind chance, it's that
something lies outside of the plan, that something explodes
the plot. Stuff happens, and recognizing that is enough.

Arnold Pan, Class of '96, majored in modern thought and
literature. He's waiting for more stuff to happen.
