# Wage increase could raise taxes
## Study challenges benefit of boosting minimum wage 
### Connie Chang 
A proposition
on the California
ballot to raise the
minimum wage
would mean an
increase of more
than $1 billion in
sales tax each
year, according to
a study by a Stan
ford professor.

Economics Prof. Thomas
MaCurdy and economics doctoral
candidate Margaret O'Brien-Strain
released a study last Thursday
claiming the proposed increase of

minimum wage from $4.75 an hour
to $5.75 an hour would unfairly
burden a large proportion of fami
lies in California.
The minimum wage would be
raised by March 1998 if Proposition
210 is passed in the November elec
tion.
Proponents of the "Living Wage
Initiative" say the increase would
help the state's poorest families and
lift them out of poverty. But be
cause most low-income families do
not include a minimum wage work
er, only 27 percent of the lowest
fifth of the income distribution
would benefit from Prop. 210,
MaCurdv said.

MaCurdy said 26 percent of the
richest families also include a mini
mum wage worker and would bene
fit from passage of the proposition.
"Prop. 210 is being sold to voters
as in income support for working
poor families, and its proponents
also present the initiative as being
virtually free," said MaCurdy.
"Meanwhile all families in Califor
nia will have to pay for the minimu m
wage increase with higher prices,
with low-income families paving dis
proportionately high shares.
"Prop. 210 will cost everybody
through higher prices," he said.

O'Brien-Strain said the propo
nents of the measure "should not
claim that Prop. 210 will support
only people with families." Prop.
210 would also support teen-agers
and young adults who are working
at minimum wage but do not live in
poverty, she said.
According to MaCurdy, the price
increase necessary to pay for the

minimum wage increase will cause
"the demand for California prod
ucts to fall and low-wage workers to
become unemployed.
"If Californians want to pay an
additional $1.1 billion to support
poor families, there are clearly far
more effective options," he said.
The earned-income tax credit,
for example, would to add a 40 per
cent credit on top of earnings,
MaCurdy noted. The tax credit is
restricted to poor families with chil
dren and is paid for out of the feder
al government's general revenue.

"One hundred percent of the
benefit will go to low-income work
ers, and they won't have to pay in
come tax," said MaCurdy.
In a statement, Steve Hopcraft,
a spokesman for the Liveable Wage
Coalition, dismissed the study's au
thors as "libertarians" who rou
tinely oppose wage hikes.
He said raising the minimum
wage would pump money back into
the state's economy and prevent
many from turning to welfare.
Both MaCurdy and O'Brien-
Strain expect the measure to pass.
