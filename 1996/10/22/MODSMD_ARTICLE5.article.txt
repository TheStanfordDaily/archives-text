# Wage increase could raise taxes
## Study challenges benefit of boosting minimum wage 
### Connie Chang 
A proposition
on the California
ballot to raise the
minimum wage
would mean an
increase of more
than $1 billion in
sales tax each
year, according to
a study by a Stan
ford professor.

Economics Prof. Thomas
MaCurdy and economics doctoral
candidate Margaret O'Brien-Strain
released a study last Thursday
claiming the proposed increase of

minimum wage from $4.75 an hour
to $5.75 an hour would unfairly
burden a large proportion of fami
lies in California.
The minimum wage would be
raised by March 1998 if Proposition
210 is passed in the November elec
tion.
Proponents of the "Living Wage
Initiative" say the increase would
help the state's poorest families and
lift them out of poverty. But be
cause most low-income families do
not include a minimum wage work
er, only 27 percent of the lowest
fifth of the income distribution
would benefit from Prop. 210,
MaCurdv said.

MaCurdy said 26 percent of the
richest families also include a mini
mum wage worker and would bene
fit from passage of the proposition.
"Prop. 210 is being sold to voters
as in income support for working
poor families, and its proponents
also present the initiative as being
virtually free," said MaCurdy.
"Meanwhile all families in Califor
nia will have to pay for the minimu m
wage increase with higher prices,
with low-income families paving dis
proportionately high shares.
"Prop. 210 will cost everybody
through higher prices," he said.
