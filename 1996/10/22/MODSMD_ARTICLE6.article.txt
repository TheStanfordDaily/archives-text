### Tsung-Pei Chang Contributing writer 
A Stanford senior has set up a
new organization to "help build a
new united Stanford" in perform
ing public service in East Palo
Alto.
Friends of East Palo Alto has
two purposes, said Felipe Merino,
a double major in American Stud
ies and economics.
First, he hopes to increase in
teraction among Stanford stu
dents and to continue the school's
interaction with the community
of East Palo Alto. Members of the
organization also will participate
in a community service activity in
East Palo Alto twice per month
and take a camping trip once per
quarter to strengthen interaction.
"The primary goal of this
group is not to engage in commu
nity service outside of the Stan
ford community as a new entity
but to establish a continued inter
action primarily among individu
als from the various community
service groups on campus,
whether they serve outside com
munities or the Stanford commu
nity," Merino wrote in an invita
tion to join the group.
The idea for Friends of East
Palo Alto came from several expe
riences in the past two years,
Merino said.
After spending a summer in
Washington, D.C.. Merino said, he
learned how to accomplish tasks
more efficiently. He saw that goals
were not achieved unless people
worked together and listened to
each other's viewpoints.
The following year, due to his
prior involvement in the lYoject
AIYME mentorship program at

Stanford, he was invited to partic
ipate in a forum for community
leaders. The Public Service Pro
gram in Community leadership
included a number of workshops

which inspired Menno, he said.
"My feeling, and that of many
other students, is that when stu
dents come into Stanford, they

Senior Felipe Merino has organized a group to help coordinate
Stanford students' work in East Palo Alto
automatically become fragmented
because they are so involved in
their academics and pay attention
only to the groups they are a part
of," Merino said. "Individuals start
building a sphere around them
selves. They need to realize that
they are actually part of a larger
sphere encompassing the Stanford
community."
The Stanford community, Meri
no said, includes all areas sur
rounding the campus as well. He is
working with Manuel Herrera,
East Palo Alto's volunteer coordi
nator, to arrange service projects
for the group.
"With other groups, we get four
hours of service here or a day there
per year, while Friends of East Palo
Alto will be more dedicated to ongo
ing service," Herrera said.
Herrera also emphasized the
willingness of Merino's group to in
teract with members of the East
Palo Alto community.
"There is an undercurrent
among grass-roots people in East
Palo Alto of not feeling comfortable
about offers from people who have
no true sense of commitment,"

Herrera said. "The approach being
taken by this group really empha
sizes building a relationship."
"The residents of East Palo Alto
will have a say in what we do to help
them," Merino said. "For instance,
the Department of Parks and
Recreation just lost its funding, so
we am help the residents clean and
maintain the parks.
"I want members (of Friends of
East Palo Alto) to see how much dif
ference they can make working
with each other and with the resi
dents," he said.
To emphasize the idea of a uni
fied community, after each commu
nity service event members of the
group will gather to reflect on how
the activity influenced them.
The quarterly camping retreat
will emphasize the interdepen
dence of individuals within a com
munity by allowing members to
work together and rely on each
other, Merino said. In addition, the
Haas Center for Public Service will
facilitate workshops.
Merino also plans to create a
campus-wide newsletter that in
cludes not only the service activities
of Friends of East Palo Alto but also
those of the Haas Center, the
Women's Center, the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center,
the ethnic centers and other service

organizations on campus.
The newsletter, which will con
tain an all-inclusive calendar of
events, should eliminate any over
lap in purpose among the various
organizations, he said.
"I'm hoping that Friends of East
Palo Alto will be the answer to cre
ating a lasting network of student
groups," Merino explained. "I want
all the organization leaders on cam
pus to get involved and to unify
their purposes. By drawing on each
other's differences, we can all work
together as a coalition."
The projects will help students
to provide a better atmosphere at
Stanford and will positively reflect
upon Stanford's service organiza
tions, Merino said. Members of the
organization will also get experi
ence in interacting on a larger scale
within the community.
"Most importantly, we will es
tablish the points of commonality
that we share with each other, as
Stanford community members," he
said.

The next Friends of East Palo Alto
activity will take place on Oct. 26 —
Volunteer Day in East Palo Alto.
Members of the group will help
clean up parks in the community.
Anyone interested in participating
should contact Merino at 313-9624.
