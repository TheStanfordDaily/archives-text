A Stanford senior has set up a
new organization to "help build a
new united Stanford" in perform

service groups on campus,

munities or the Stanford commu
nity," Merino wrote in an invita

Palo Alto came from several expe

worked together and listened to
each other's viewpoints.

prior involvement in the lYoject
AIYME mentorship program at

Stanford, he was invited to partic

leaders. The Public Service Pro
gram in Community leadership
included a number of workshops

which inspired Menno, he said.
"My feeling, and that of many
other students, is that when stu
dents come into Stanford, they
