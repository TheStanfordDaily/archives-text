We're looking for people who
look at this glass and say:
"There's gotta be other
glasses of water."
We need people capable of going
beyond half-full or half-empty
thinking. People who see subtleties.
Who are quite frankly bored by easy
answers and off-the-shelf solutions.
People who are constantly
challenging their own thinking and
are thirsty for new ideas and
knowledge.
You'll have a degree from a top
school. Getting a job won't really be
an issue. The question is: which
job? Which industry?
You don't want to get locked
into one area and then discover
three to five years from now that
you don't like it. By then you've
invested too much.
Andersen Consulting offers you
the chance to work on a variety

of projects—with clients in a wide
range of industries.
We are the leader in helping
organizations apply information
technology to their business
advantage. Every hour of every
business day, we implement a
solution to help one of our more
than 5,000 clients worldwide.
What makes that possible is the
quality of our people. And the
quality of our training. We're known
for both.
Because business and
technology are ever-changing, we
see training
as a continuing process. And our
$123-million Center for Professional
Education in St. Charles, Illinois,
is just one measure of our
Andersen Consulting is an equal opportunity employer
commitment. We train you for a
career—not just a job.
Are you the kind of person we're
talking about? The kind of person
with an unquenchable desire for
challenge and professional growth?
If so, come talk to us. And
find out more about a career with
Andersen Consulting.
