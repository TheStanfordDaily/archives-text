# ASSU votes on requests for funding

The ASSU Senate considered
quarterly funding requests at its
meeting last night, ultimately deny
ing money for Stanford Students for
Life after a heated debate.
Senators also questioned Dean of
Students Marc Wais at their second
meeting of the year.
Controversy arose when ASSU
Senator Howard Loo, a senior, pro
posed to give Students for Life $113
in Community Service Board funds.

The Appropriations Committee, overturning the
board's recommendation, had ruled the group ineligi
ble for funding on the grounds that it was partisan.
"We are pro-life but we don't intermingle with po
litical groups," the group's president, sophomore
Becky Sauer, said in defense of the request. The
money "is for supplies to advertise the group and to
raise awareness about the issue."
Sauer went on to assure the senate that the money
allocated would be spent on women's health pam
phlets.
Under the ASSU Program Board Guideline's sec
tion titled "Groups We Generally Don't Fund," fund
ing can be denied "only if [a group] advocates a specif
ic party, candidate or piece of legislation. ... If they
only advocate a particular viewpoint, they're OK."
Many senators, however, thought Students for
Life's mission crossed that boundary.
"I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt,
but I don't think I can," said ASSU Senator Valerie
Oram, a sophomore.
The amendment, however, received support from
ASSU President Bill Shen, a self-described pro-choice
supporter.
"I support this not because of what my views are —
you all know what my views are — but because [Stu
dents for Life] can provide a valuable, nonpartisan
service to the Stanford community," he said.
The group was denied funding on a vote of 6-7 with
two abstentions.
The senate also was asked to provide Program
Board funds for SCBN. The student-run television
station originally requested $3,750 to purchase new
equipment, but the senate reduced that amount to
$660 earmarked for equipment repair and advertis
ing.
