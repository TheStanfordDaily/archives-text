# ASSU votes on requests for funding
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate considered
quarterly funding requests at its
meeting last night, ultimately deny
ing money for Stanford Students for
Life after a heated debate.
Senators also questioned Dean of
Students Marc Wais at their second
meeting of the year.
Controversy arose when ASSU
Senator Howard Loo, a senior, pro
posed to give Students for Life $113
in Community Service Board funds.

The Appropriations Committee, overturning the
board's recommendation, had ruled the group ineligi
ble for funding on the grounds that it was partisan.
"We are pro-life but we don't intermingle with po
litical groups," the group's president, sophomore
Becky Sauer, said in defense of the request. The
money "is for supplies to advertise the group and to
raise awareness about the issue."
Sauer went on to assure the senate that the money
allocated would be spent on women's health pam
phlets.
Under the ASSU Program Board Guideline's sec
tion titled "Groups We Generally Don't Fund," fund
ing can be denied "only if [a group] advocates a specif
ic party, candidate or piece of legislation. ... If they
only advocate a particular viewpoint, they're OK."
Many senators, however, thought Students for
Life's mission crossed that boundary.
"I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt,
but I don't think I can," said ASSU Senator Valerie
Oram, a sophomore.
The amendment, however, received support from
ASSU President Bill Shen, a self-described pro-choice
supporter.
"I support this not because of what my views are —
you all know what my views are — but because [Stu
dents for Life] can provide a valuable, nonpartisan
service to the Stanford community," he said.
The group was denied funding on a vote of 6-7 with
two abstentions.
The senate also was asked to provide Program
Board funds for SCBN. The student-run television
station originally requested $3,750 to purchase new
equipment, but the senate reduced that amount to
$660 earmarked for equipment repair and advertis
ing.
"We believe that no matter what equipment you


Wais
have, unless you have the viewer
ship, you don't provide a service to
students," said ASSU Senate
Deputy Chair Joe Freund, a
sophomore.
The senate hopes the advertis
ing allocation and its $3,600-per
quarter Teleflicks program will
generate the viewership necessary
for SCBN to attract outside un
derwriters.
During an open forum in the
meeting, Wais offered the senate
an explanation to a much-publi
cized incident involving Heather
Dunn, assistant director of the Of
fice of Student Activities.
At the beginning of this quar
ter, Dunn called police to an on
campus party and later told a
Daily reporter that the call was
made by an anonymous person.
According to Wais, Dunn ob
served a dangerous situation and
moved to correct it."It was a situ
ation where a staff member took
the appropriate action," he said.
"There was no intent to mislead or
deceive."
He denied that Dunn ever cited
an anonymous person as the
source of the call.
Wais added that the party plan
ning guidelines will be reviewed in
the spring.
Wais — addressing an issue
University President Gerhard
Casper was unable to answer dur
ing his recent appearance before
the senate — said "Big Game Bon

fire is not a possibility now or in
the near future" because a Califor
nia environmental impact state
ment has yet to be completed.
Wais also announced that he
will release a report detailing the
operations of his office next week.
Wais said he intends to issue a
similar report each year.
During the informal session
preceding the meeting, senators
were informed that bills will be in
troduced in the near future to
expel a number of graduate sena
tors who have yet to attend a
meeting.
Under the ASSU Constitution,
the senate can, by a two-thirds
vote, remove any member who has
exceeded a predetermined number
of unexcused absences. Vacant
seats will be filled in a special elec
tion.
In other business, the senate
appointed sophomore Lisa Liao
deputy chair of the ASSU Nomi
nations Commission. Junior Jae
Kwon and sophomores Joe El
Rady, Patricia Gachiengo and
David Wang also were named to
the commission.
The senate also confirmed the
nominations of several other stu
dents to University bodies, in
cluding committees of the Facul
ty Senate and the Board of
Trustees and various other per
manent and ad hoc committees
and task forces.
The meeting adjourned after
the senate failed a quorum call.
With several funding bills still un
decided, Shen said he intended to
call a special meeting of the senate
for next Tuesday.
