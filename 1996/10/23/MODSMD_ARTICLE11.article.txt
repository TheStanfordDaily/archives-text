## Dole rallies Midwest despite gloomy polls 
### 
TROY, Mich. (AP) - Faced
with a dwindling election calen
dar and gloomy polls, Bob Dole
wrapped up a 10-city Midwest
swing yesterday with a defiant
declaration that "I'm going to win
whether you like it or not!"
As he rolled through mostly
GOP strongholds, Dole told vot
ers outside his customized bus
cruiser that "We're on the road to
victory." But even some of his
supporters were unconvinced.
"He obviously doesn't have the
number of votes he needs," said
Walter Bleke, a retired
schoolteacher and committed
Republican in the tourist hamlet
of Frankenmuth. "If Franken
muth were bigger, maybe it would
make a difference — but it won't
be enough will it?"
Dole's turnout of several thou

sand in Frankenmuth and Grand
Blanc was helped by local schools,
which let students out of class to
attend his rallies.
Dole defied naysayers by liken
ing his underdog campaign to
Harry Truman's upset victory
over Thomas Dewey in 1948.
"I never did meet President
Dewey, did you? No. I'm like
Harry Truman. I'm from the
Midwest and I'm plainspoken,
and I'm going to win whether you
like it or not!" Dole boomed.
Despite a choked voice and
runny nose, Dole told reporters
Monday night that his weekend
cold had been "finished" off with
the help of a decongestant. And
by yesterday afternoon, he was
revving up his standard campaign
pitch that "I'm the most opti
mistic man in America."
