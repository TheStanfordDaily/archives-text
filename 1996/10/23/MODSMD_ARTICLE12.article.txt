CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) — Fleets of helicopters
and airplanes roared through Southern California
canyons yesterday, dropping water on erratic, wind
blown wildfires that have burned 92 houses and seri
ously injured five firefighters.
Helter-skelter Santa Ana winds turned dry brush
and oil-rich eucalyptus trees into blowtorches, spread
ing flames across 30,000 acres. By yesterday after
noon, the major fires were less than half contained and
some flared up again as the devil wind shifted and
gusted up to 41 mph.
Four firefighters working a flareup in Malibu were
seriously burned when their truck stalled and flames
roared over them in Corral Canyon. "This is life
threatening. These are very serious burns. We're look
ing at over 90 percent of their bodies," Glendale fire
Marshal Dave Starr said.
Another firefighter broke his neck in a traffic acci
dent while rushing to a blaze, and another man suf
fered burns over 45 percent of his body.
Thousands fled their homes, schools and business
es in four counties as flames exploded, propelled
through the canyons by winds as high as 71 mph.
