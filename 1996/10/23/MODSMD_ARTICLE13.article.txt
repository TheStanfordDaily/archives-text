# Hundreds of students protest in Burma
## Largest demonstration in years acts against police brutality

RANGOON, Burma (AP) — In
the largest street demonstration
in several years, hundreds of stu
dents gathered Monday night at a
major Rangoon intersection to
protest police brutality.
The gathering near Rangoon
University was peaceful, but
showed no signs of abating early
yesterday morning. No uniformed
security personnel were at the

scene, although university offi
cials were on hand to keep order.
The students said their protest
is not political. But any defiance
of the military regime, which took
power in 1988 after violently sup
pressing pro-democracy demon
strations, is anathema to the gen
erals who insist that law and
order prevail over democratic
rights.

Although there is an active, if
officially powerless, pro-democra
cy movement led by 1991 Nobel
Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi,
students have remained relatively
quiet in the past few years of mil
itary rule in Burma.
Traditionally, they had been at
the vanguard of political change, a
situation to which the military
paid a back-handed tribute in the

early 1960s when they blew up
Rangoon University's student
union.
Monday night's demonstra
tion, led by students from the
Yangon Institute of Technology
— eight miles from downtown
Rangoon — protested an incident
Saturday in which police arrested
students involved in a dispute
with a restaurant owner.
