Tobacco secrets uncovered
WASHINGTON (AP) — Although researchers didn't establish
the molecular link between a cigarette chemical and lung cancer
until last week, newly uncovered documents show a top Philip
Morris scientist argued 38 years ago to remove the suspected car
cinogen from or at least reduce it in Marlboros.
The memos by J.E. Lincoln, who later became Philip Morris'
vice president for research, are careful not to say tobacco scien
tists believe the chemical benzopyrene had actually hurt smokers.
