## Time for students 
### 
President's office hours
indicate an encouraging
trend toward accessibility

IT ISN'T EASY being Gerhard
Casper. In the course of any
one day, Stanford's president
must deal with everything from
irate alumni to nosy reporters.
One minute he must convince
Washington politicians that they
don't really want to chop research
funding in half, the next he must
soothe alumni who are still mad
that Stanford got rid of the Indian
mascot in the 19705.
And then there's the constant
scrutiny by U.S. News & World
Report and other media organiza
tions. Add 8,000 acres of land,
1,400 faculty members and a bizil
ion-dollar budget into the mix and
you've got more than a full day's
work.
Nevertheless, Casper can't
neglect his main responsibility â€”
the 14,000 students who come to
the Farm each year to learn. The
president is ultimately responsible
for ensuring that a student's expe
rience at Stanford is as meaningful
as possible, and he must realize
that this experience encompasses
both academic and non-academic
areas.
That's why it's encouraging to
see Casper's recent efforts to
make himself more accessible to
students. Casper's intention to
hold "fortnightly office hours"
shows he is making an effort to
seek out student feedback. Under
the new program, students indi
vidually and in groups can meet
with Casper for 15-minute ses
sions. All that's required is an
appointment.
The office-hour format is good
because students don't have to be
ASSU leaders or other campus big
wigs to get an appointment. It's
first come, first served, as access to
the president should be.
Other top administrators
should follow Casper's lead and set

aside time in their schedules to
meet regularly with students. Pro
fessors have office hours, why
shouldn't the provost or the deans
of the University's seven schools?
Administrators may have the best
intentions in the world, but often
times the hassles of day-to-day
business prevents them from
interacting with students on a reg
ular basis. The solution? Mark it
down on the calendar.
Though his "fortnightly office
hours" are a good start, Casper
should take further steps to
increase his accessibility to stu
dents.
For example, the president
should host "Tea and Cookies"
once a month, not just once or
twice a quarter. Since its inception
last spring, this hour-long session
in Tresidder Union has drawn at
least 100 students each time.
Students want (and rightfully
deserve) answers to such issues as
the lack of sorority housing on
campus, the status of the Univer
sity's alcohol policy and problems
with disabled access to community
centers.
Finally, Casper must make sure
to publicize his office hours and
other opportunities for students to
meet with him.
And publicity means more than
placing an advertisement in The
Daily or announcing it at an ASSU
Senate meeting. Though that's a
good place to start, Casper and
other administrators need to
examine alternative ways to get
the word out about these opportu
nities.
As it is now, many students
probably have never even heard of
"Tea and Cookies." And maybe
other administrators, such as the
provost and the seven deans, have
office hours, but most students
don't know about it.
Students must be informed
about these opportunities. After
all, if no one shows up, what's the
point of holding the events in the
first place?
Casper can't drink all that tea
by himself.
