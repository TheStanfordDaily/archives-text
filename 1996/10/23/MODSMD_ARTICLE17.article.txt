Administration, not U.S. News, needs to be challenged

I AGREE WITH the point that yes
terday's Daily editorial made about
the specious value of the U.S.
News & World Report rankings.
However, I have some problems
with the way people have chosen to
protest these rankings.
First of all, refusing to supply the
data to U.S. News & World Report is
not as effective as it may sound. As
University President Gerhard Casper
said in his address to the ASSU Senate,
almost all of the information printed in
the newsmagazine is in the public
domain. U.S. News & World Report
has access to this data whether Stan-

ford submits it or not.
Second of all, getting mad at U.S.
News & World Report for unduly influ
encing University decisions is a bit like
placing all the blame on the woman
with whom your boyfriend is having an
affair. Granted, your boyfriend is
someone you thought cared about you,
but if you really believe that he's
cheating on you, isn't it time to take a
second look at his trustworthiness?
Isn't it time to confront him and ask
him why he's doing you wrong?
So if the Casper and the faculty are
making decisions to try to increase
Stanford's ranking, isn't it time we stu

dents started asking them why they've
done the students wrong? Don't they
care about what their own students
think more than some floozy magazine?
President Casper has repeatedly said
the U.S. News & World Report rank
ings are not influential in University
policy decisions. The real question is:
Why don't we students believe him?
If students felt they had enough
voice in the decision-making process
that leads to such things as the addi
tion of an early admissions option and
the change in the grading policy, I
wonder if the U.S. News & World
Report ranking would be much of an

issue.
Even if the students succeed in get
ting rid of the U.S. News & World
Report ranking, another magazine with
a ranking system will crop up and we
will see history rewrite itself.
Getting rid of "the other woman" is
never the long-term solution. Getting
ourselves a trusting relationship with
the president and faculty is.
