# Replace rankings with peer reviews and full disclosure of statistics

### 
Students and faculty concerned
about the college rating game should
look to themselves — not the editors of
U.S. News & World Report, Money or
any other guides — for giving prospec
tive freshmen a better understanding of
their choices.
As Lafayette College President
Arthur Rothkopf put it last year: "Col
leges must take the lead in assuring
that accurate information is available to
applicants."
That would appear quite appropriate
for institutions committed to peer
review in such key areas as research
and faculty appointments. But it would
be Fiercely resisted by most presidents
and marketers, even at our most presti
gious institutions.
If Stanford's past experience is any
guide, universities devote a great deal of

effort — and expense — to collecting
information for accrediting agencies.
Some data are undoubtedly drawn from
public sources, but the resulting docu
ments are wrapped in secrecy worthy of
working drawings for the stealth
bomber.
Public reports are usually restricted
to simply stating whether or not a pro
gram has been accredited. Only when
some probationary status or conditions
are attached will the faculty, students
or alumni get any clues about possible
shortcomings. Critiques qu'ckly clog the
campus grapevine.
It would be far better for institutions
to make their own documentation pub
lic and to advise accrediting groups in
advance that their report will be pub
lished at the institution's expense. This
could be combined with a response from
the institution and a rejoinder from the
accrediting group, if warranted.
The result could be a blueprint for
seeking support to improve the institu
tion instead of the puffy smoke screens
that surround the temples of academe.
Prospective students, faculty and

donors might find less hype and more
honesty to be worthy of their support.
The editors of U.S. News & World
Report and other highly publicized
rankings could find themselves eclipsed
by comprehensive peer reviews.
Institutions also could encourage sys
tematic research on the impact of their
educational programs on both students
and faculty. Few universities, if any,
can match Stanford in this respect. But
faculty who conduct such studies are
usually viewed askance by their col
leagues. Even when families are shelling
out $100,000 or more for an undergrad
uate education, any attempt to system
atically view the "value added" for stu
dents is usually quietly derided by
administrators.
Aided and abetted by U.S. News &
World Report, Harvard, Stanford and a
handful of high-prestige institutions
battle fiercely for top prospective stu
dent talent. "It's easy to make butter
from cream," as one former Stanford
recruiter put it.
At the very least, academic institu
tions should systematically analyze —

and routinely publish — how students
(and alumni) appraise their education.
At Stanford in the late 1980s, the pro
portion of graduating seniors who
regarded their education as "excellent"
slipped a notch, although the over
whelming majority remained highly sat
isfied. Publication of alumni survey
data, once open to all, has come under
tight administrative control.
Graduating seniors have long com
plained of poor academic advising in
their first two years at Stanford to little
avail. Across the country, high schools
have slashed their advising staffs, with
little visible complaint from the college
community.
Until these trends are reversed, uni
versities should not be surprised to see
more and more people — including their
own alumni — looking to high-paid pri
vate counselors and entrepreneurial
journalists to help them place their
$100,000 bets on their children's
future.
