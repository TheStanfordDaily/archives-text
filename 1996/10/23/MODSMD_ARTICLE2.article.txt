# Project keeps eye on the road ahead

The Stanford Human Genome
Center has unveiled an interdisci
plinary genetics course for high
school students designed to fur
ther education about the ethics
and science of genetics.
In collaboration with a group of
teachers at New Valley High
School in the Santa Clara School
District, the program on "Investi
gation, Genes, Culture and
Choice" is being offered for four
weeks.
The class grew out of the
Human Genome Project, better
known for sequencing DNA rather
than debating culture and choice.
However, it is precisely the colli
sion of genes with cultures and
choices with which project mem
bers feel society needs to be famil
iarized.
According to Lane Conn, the
Stanford Human Genome Cen
ter's education director, "Differ
ent cultures can choose very differ
ent approaches to dealing with ge
netic problems."
The curriculum focuses on one
genetic disorder, lactose intoler
ance, and highlights the many dif
ferent choices people have when
dealing with this ailment.
"In the United States, people
choose a very technological solu
tion to lactose intolerance. They
often drink acidophilous milk or
take lactase tablets," Conn said.
"But we want students to think
about other options, for example,
not drinking milk or gene thera
py."
Gene therapy for lactose intol

erance is not available for humans,
but it can be done on the lactose-in
tolerant bacteria that the students
are using as a model organism in
their labs.
The program is very inquiry
driven, with no right or wrong an
swers, Conn said, so the students
can choose which experiments to
undertake.
"We expect many students will
choose to use gene therapy on their
model organism," he said.
A less technological solution to
lactose intolerance will be ex
plained with help from John Mu
gane, a Stanford Swahili instruc
tor.
Mugane hails from Kenya,
where folk knowledge has led to a
process of allowing milk to stand
for a few days while being stirred
with a special stick. The milk par
tially spoils and turns into a yo
gurt-like version of acidophilous
milk. The stick harbors microor
ganisms that actually digest the
lactose into two simpler sugars,
making the milk lactose-free.
"My principle task was to get rid
of conceptions that would not
apply to a typical Kenyan," Mu
gane said of his role in the project.
"One of the things I had to explain
was the importance of milk in
Kenya â€” cultural, educational and
political implications."
"I expect to visit Kenya soon
and I will get that stick .. . before
some biotech company patents it,"
Mugane joked.
The lactose intolerance curricu
lum has been used previously at
other schools and was introduced
