## Notes from CIV lecture ... 
### 
LAST MONTH, AS I was preparing
to drive back to school, I was greet
ed with the sad news that Allan
Malamud had been found dead in his
downtown Los Angeles apartment. Mala
mud was a columnist for the Los Angeles
Times. From sixth grade on, his column,
"Notes on a Scorecard," was the first
thing I and countless other Angelenos
read Monday through Thursday morn
ings. His style was simple, his observa
tions straightforward and his commen
tary was always enlightening and enter
taining. Weekday mornings just haven't
been the same since "Mud" passed. And
to that end, I've decided to write this col
umn as a tribute, copying his style. I now
present: "Notes from CIV lecture ..
On most American college campuses,
I'd expect the "nookie index" to go up
about 15 points during a major power
outage. Last week, I figure most people at
Stanford just went to bed early . . . alone.
Rumor has it that this was the first
weekend of fall quarter in which police
did not break up a fraternity party. If
administrators were truly concerned
about the health and well-being of Stan
ford students, they might not be so quick
to push undergraduates into cars for
bouts of off-campus drinking . . .
Now that the speech code is dead and
buried, I wonder what its supporters
thought of the scene in White Plaza last
week, where members of a student orga
nization hanged a heterosexual in effigy.
Was I the only one who was offended?

Harrah's sportsbook in Reno is listing
the odds for having a bonfire this year at
4-1, and time is running out for the Class
of 1997. The Axe Committee needs
approval within the next week or so if
they'll have time to build the huge wood
pile in Lake Lagunita . . .
Speaking of construction, whose bril
liant idea was the obstacle course which
sprung up on Mayfield Avenue this sum
mer between Tresidder Union and Flo
rence Moore Hall? Planners have some
how succeeded in making the single most
dangerous intersection on campus (the
left turn out of Tresidder) even more
dangerous.. .
Kudos to the Stanford Review for
dumping the smoke-signals caricature.
"Cowboy Ron" is a much nicer touch,
but "For the Record," you guys have a
long way to go before you should start
commenting on other papers' colum
nists . . .
Good for the ASSU and Stanford in
Government! This quarter, Stanford will
have five presidential candidates cam
paigning on campus, including Ross
Perot and Ralph Nader. Now if they
could only land a REAL contender.
Unfortunately, I hear Ken Griffey Jr.
has other engagements . . .
Best campaign button of the season: a
Ralph Nader button spotted on Nick
Thompson's chest which proclaims, "Bill
and Bob make me wanna RALPH . .
Government expenditures are way
out of control. "Bill" should really take

an accounting class. Clinton or Shen;
does it really matter?
It should come as no surprise to insid
ers that Sonny Bono, R-Palm Springs, is
currently enjoying a double-digit lead in
his bid for re-election to Congress, but if
you're looking for upsets, pay close
attention to the New Hampshire Senate
race, where Dick Swett (let me repeat:
Dick Swett) may replace Bob Smith . . .
I don't know what is more embarrass
ing: Stanford's two-touchdown loss to
Oregon State on Saturday (ending the
Beavers' 15-game losing streak) or
USC's loss to California two weeks ago,
which was the Trojans' first loss to the
Weenies in Los Angeles since the Nixon
administration .. .
I've always hoped that Big Game
might actually mean something besides
determining the worst football team in
California, so it's almost too bad that Cal
lost on a last-minute fumble this week
end at Washington State. On second
thought. . .
Well, now that football season is
almost over, does anyone have an extra
Sixth Man Club shirt?

Jim Finsten would probably read the
Chronicle every morning now that Mud
is gone, but all of their sportswriters
went to UC-Berkeley . . .
