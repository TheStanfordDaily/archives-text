## Coming to a computer cluster near you: The Assimilator 
### 
"Assimilating into the collective. Resis
tance is futile."
— the computer in the cluster
I'VE BEEN HAVING Orwellian flash
backs. On Sunday, Residential Com
puting (henceforth to be referred to as
"They") installed a program called "The
Assimilator" deep into the subconscious of
our cluster Macintoshes. This program, in
its attempt to update important applica
tions and eliminate extraneous flies, com
mandeers our cluster (and others) for two
hours a day as our Macs are "assimilating
into the collective."
Kind of trippy, huh?
No one seemed to notice as our loyal and
trusty computational compatriots were
forced to just sit there passively, enduring
the relentless, systematic brainwashing
and reprogramming. All I could do was
watch with restraint, holding my hands
high into the heavens, searching for
answers. But there were none to be had.
The Assimilator had worked its sick and
twisted magic. As the screen read: "Resis

tance is futile."
If this story sounds foreign to you, don't
feel that you are immune to The Assimila
tor's powers. If They haven't gotten to the
Macs in your cluster yet, They will. Ohhhh
yes, They most certainly will. He may be
about 12 years late, but Big Brother is
Watching You.
Or, well, Big Mac is Watching You.
The Computing Powers That Be will
tell you that assimilation is the perfect
solution to all computing problems, but we
must remember that in order to make
everything the same, individuality will be
emphatically crushed beneath the collec
tive weight of Residential Computing. As
our cluster is methodically regressed to the
mean, all of its quirks, charm and idiosyn
crasies that make it most distinctly and
passionately our cluster will be annihilated
beyond recognition.
(Orchestra swells.)
If Cultures, Ideas and Values has
taught us anything (besides the fact that
ClifY Notes are a good investment), it has
taught us that passive acceptance of such

thorough and unmitigated manipulation of
our vital resources must not go unchal
lenged. If CIV has taught us anything, it
has taught us to stand up and not allow the
dominant paradigm of centralized power
and hegemony to subjugate the masses. If
CIV has taught us ...
What am I talking about? I think I went
to CIV section twice.
Now, I'm not sure how upset I would be
if "that damn Assimilator" (as we fondly
refer to it) had just left our cluster in
roughly the same shape as it had found it.
You know what they say: "If it ain't broke,
don't submit a Fix-It." But instead, after
paralyzing communication lines for more
than two hours, it not only assimilated our
LaserWriter out of commission for days,
but Microsoft Word's spell-checker myste
riously disappeared as well.
The spell-checker? Why woold They
tayk aweigh owr spell-chequer?
This whole thing is more than just
bizarre. It's creepy. It sounds like the plot
of some bad '50s movie or new "X-Files"
rip-off: "The Assimilator — Cloning Algo

rithm Goes Haywire and Destroys Cluster
Spell-Checker!" Details at 11.
Now some of you computer-literate
types out there might be thinking, "Hey,
why don't you just throw the Assimilator
file into the Trash?" Good thinking, crime
fighters, and that's exactly what we tried
to do. We searched the entire hard drive for
that sucker. And then we searched some
more. And more. And more. It was abso
lutely nowhere to be found. And then we
realized:
The Assimilator — as we knew it — did
not exist!
Now, machines, in general, have never
really frightened me before. Sure, talking
co flee makers and beeping parking meters
are a little scary. And I never have come to
terms with the fact that dollar bill changers
near washing machines can eerily "decide"
if your bill is too crinkled or not. And I
guess I still have paralyzing nightmares
about those UPC scanners at the super
market charging me for Advil when I clear
ly decided to buy Safeway-brand Ibuprofen
in order to save myself the 35 cents.

OK, machines scare me. A little.
Nonetheless, in my pre-Assimilatoi
days, I had always tossed aside my worries
and pined away at e-mail without even ar
inkling of fear. I bravely fought through
Forsythe to boldly and confidently select
Axess. I've even found myself Fetch-m
every so often. But The Assimilator ha*
changed me. It has destroyed my innocent
and carefree days. I can no longer skip
freely through the fields of rye.
We are not alone any more. Somewhere
They are watching us. They collect behinc
blinking lights and giant television screens
and watch as The Assimilator slowly
breaks down the will of each cluster, one b)
one, and every Macintosh is firmly sup
pressed and homologized. Soon, they wil
achieve their fiendishly wicked goals: Tht
clusters will no longer ours! Printing
will no longer be allowed!
And everyone's spelling will eo to hel.
