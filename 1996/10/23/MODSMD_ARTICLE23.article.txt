## Owls, humans found to have similar memory processes 
### Julie Choe Contributing writer 
Barn owls use a similar kind of
memory process as primates —
including humans, a team of Stan
ford researchers has discovered.
Neurobiology Prof. Eric Knud
sen and his research assistant,
Phyllis Knudsen, raised three barn
owls at an aviary at the School of
Medicine as part of a pilot project
to determine the location of a spe
cific type of memory called audito
ry spatial working memory.
There are several types of mem
ory, one of which is working mem
ory. Working memory is either
auditory or visual. Knudsen chose
to study auditory working memo
ry, which includes both spatial and
identification varieties.
Working memory is short-term
memory used temporarily to store
information that senses detect.
According to Knudsen, "Barn
owls are extremely good at this
task, and their auditory system has
evolved for spatial problems.
"Their life depends on it"for
activities such as catching prey, he
said.
In studying the auditory spatial
working memory of the three barn
owls, the ultimate question was
where in the brain this information
is stored and processed.
Previous studies on primates
and their visual spatial working
memory gave some hints.
Primates store visual spatial
working memoiy in the prefrontal
cortex, part of the cerebral cortex,
or outer layer of the brain.
Although the brain of a barn
owl difTers greatly from that of a
primate, he said, "There is a part of
the owl brain that is connected
very much like that of our frontal

cortex."
A specific area in the owl's fore
brain, called the anterior archis
triatum, is made up of a group of
cells that are connected similarly to
the part of the brain that humans
use for visual spatial working
memory.
To test their hypothesis, the
researchers administered a drug to
a tiny part of this region.
As a result of the drug, the birds
lost their working memoir.
"They would only respond to
current sounds," Knudsen said. "If
the sound was persistent, they
would turn to the sound source
and fly to it."
As soon as they heard the sound,
the birds immediately turned their

heads toward that location. But,
when the researchers prevented
the owls from flying by forcing
them to wait for a zeroing light to
turn off, they did not respond.
"The waiting period was varied
... but within a few milliseconds
after the sound was turned off,
they forgot it," he said.
According to Knudsen, "It is
clear that this part of the [owl's]
brain is where memory is stored
while it is being worked on, or
information must pass through
this part of the brain to access
behavior."
Future studies will be directed
toward how auditory spatial work
ing memory is stored and pro
cessed.
