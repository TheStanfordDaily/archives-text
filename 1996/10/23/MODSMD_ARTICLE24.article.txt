# SLAC prof. promotes test ban treaty
## Drell leads research to convince U.S. to agree to end its nuclear testing 
### Laura Lane Editorial staff 
A Stanford professor led
research efforts that convinced
the United States to sign a
nuclear weapons test ban treaty
last month.
Fifty years after the nuclear
age was inaugurated when atom
ic bombs were dropped on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, more
than 150 nations have commit
ted to work to stop the prolifera
tion of nuclear weapons by sign
ing the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty.
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center Deputy Director Sidney
Drell led a committee of scien
tists in making a recommenda
tion on whether the United
States should agree to the
treaty, which he said bans all
nuclear testing "of any size, at
any and in any place."
Since 1945, five nations — the
United States, the United King
dom, Russia, France and China
— have been declared as major
nuclear powers, meaning they
have admitted to having a signif
icant stockpile of nuclear
weapons. Several other nations
also are equipped with nuclear
capability.
On Sept. 24, President Clin
ton, along with the other major
nuclear powers, signed the test
ban treaty at the United
Nations. Passed bv a 158- 3 vote

at the United Nations, most
countries approving the treaty
have already signed it.
Drell said SLAC's first direc
tor, Pief Panofsky, inspired him
to devote his services to the fed
eral government. Drell became
involved with the government in
the 1960s when he began work
on several issues, including
national security, intelligence
and arms control.
He has come to be in the fore
front as an adviser on nuclear
arms.
In May 1995, 181 countries
voted to extend the United
Nations' Non-Proliferation
Treaty of 1970 for a fifth time,

this time indefinitely. Under the
treaty, signatory nations — both
nuclear and non-nuclear — are
obligated to cooperate in pre
venting the spread of nuclear
weapons.
By signing the treaty, non
nuclear nations have been placed
in a discriminatory situation,
being without nuclear weapons
and having vowed not to develop
any, Drell said. To reduce the
discrimination, the Comprehen
sive Test Ban Treaty was writ
ten so nuclear nations are pro
hibited from testing the nuclear
weapons that they already have.
"What does it take to main-

test in the
effort... to reduce
nuclear danger.'

tain a safe and reliable enduring
stockpile?" was a question that
had to be answered before the
United States agreed to sign the
treaty, Drell explained.
Drell's research group found
that the current stockpile of
nuclear weapons could be main
tained as safe and reliable with
out the use of nuclear explosion
testing.

The treaty is a "culmination
of 40 years' effort," Drell said.
The Limited Test Ban Treaty,
the first nuclear test ban treaty,
was signed in 1963, restricting
nuclear testing to underground
testing. The second nuclear test
ban treaty, the Threshold Test
Ban Treaty, was signed in 1974
and prohibited the underground
test explosions exceeding 150
kilotons (about 10 times the size
of the bombs used on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki).
"It signifies the end of nuclear
nations continuing to improve
new nuclear weapons and a com
mitment by all nations who have
signed it to work together to
meet their obligation under the
Non-Proliferation Treaty to pre
vent the spread of nuclear
weapons and to decrease nuclear
danger," Drell explained.
"I view it as a litmus test in
the effort of the nuclear coun
tries to join with the non-nuclear
countries in an effort to reduce
nuclear danger," he added.
But the treaty does not mean
the threat of nuclear warfare is
gone. Among the signatories of
the test ban treaty, two coun
tries, Iraq and North Korea,
have proved to be questionable
in their commitment to the elim
ination of nuclear weapons.
The ultimate goal of complete
eradication of nuclear weapons
is "beyond a horizon that 1 can
see," Drell said.
