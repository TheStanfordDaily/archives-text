# Margin of error
## Bug explains why polls may not accurately reflect public opinion 
### Jessen Yu Staff writer 
Q. What does it mean when a
•poll has a margin of error
of 3 percent?
A. With the presidential elec
• tion coming up soon,
you've probably seen a lot of
polls telling you a lot of different
things about what a lot of other
people are thinking.
But how can the pollsters be
so absolutely sure that the few
people they polled are thinking
the same things as you and the
rest of America?
The answer is that they can't
— but that doesn't mean you
should lose all trust in the
American system and move into
a tiny wooden shack in the hills
and type up manifestos all day
long.
The pollsters actually do
have some semblance of a clue
as to what they're doing. It's
just a lot easier for them to say
there's a 3 percent margin of
error than it is for them to
explain the gory details of what
their results actually mean.
So the Bug has taken it upon
himself to define those strange
plus or minus things.
First of all, just because a poll
says the results have a margin of
error of a few percent doesn't
mean that the actual value lies
within those error margins.
For instance, if a pollster had
a very bad day and happened to
interview an inordinate number
of people who support Ross
Perot for president, the resulting
poll might show that 75 percent
of the population supported
Perot, with a 4 percent margin of
error. That poll would be as legit
imate as any other poll conduct
ed under the same conditions.
Now before you pack up your
bags because you think a crazy
little Texan is going to be the
next leader of the free world,
you have to understand that
pollsters expect to have errors in
their polls. That's why they
invented the magical, mysteri
ous "margin of error."
Fundamentally, the margin
of error expresses that, to the
best of the pollsters' knowledge,
there is a 95 percent chance that
if the entire population were
polled, the actual result would
lie within the margin of error.
This also means that one out
of every 20 times, the actual sen
timent of the population does
not lie within the margin of
error reported by a poll. Yep — if

you've looked at more than 20
polls in your lifetime, chances
are pretty good that you've seen
a poll where the results were
actually outside of the margin of
error.
Let's just hope it's the one
saving "Baywatch" is the most
popular TV show in the world.
The margins of error that
you typically see from polls are

based on a few assumptions on
the pollster's part. For one, they
assume that their polling sam
ple is representative of the popu
lation in general.
This is not always true, espe
cially for smaller samples. For
example, if you only call people
at around 3 p.m., you will get a
totally different sample than if
you called people around 3 a.m.
You'll also probably get a lot
more angry people in the latter
case.
Another assumption that
pollsters rely on is that people
answer questions without bias.
This can be especially hard to
guarantee because it has been
shown that the wording of a
question can drastically change
the outcome of the results.
Furthermore, some people
don't respond to questions
truthfully. When people are
asked whether they vote, 65 per
cent of eligible adults will say
yes, when only 50 percent of
them actually do.
In any case, the margin of
error remains a pood indication
of how accurate a poll is, and
you just have to keep in mind
that nothing's perfect. Except
for me
Well, only 95 percent of the
time.
