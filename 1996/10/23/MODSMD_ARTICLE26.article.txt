## Two basketball dreams hoping to reach success Women christen a new professional league 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
Professional women's basketball in
America? While many doubted it would
ever happen, the American Basketball
League recently joined the plethora of

new sports leagues recently created in
this country.
Skeptics and supporters alike wit
nessed the first game of the ABL in the
Bay Area Friday night in San Jose. The
home team, the San Jose Lasers, played
the Atlanta Glory to a 78-70 win.

The teams were marked by the pres
ence of high-profile Olympians — Jen
nifer Azzi and Teresa Edwards — and a
multitude of Stanford alumnae on the
San Jose team: Azzi (Class of '90), Anita
Kaplan ('95), Val Whiting ('93) and Sonja
Henning ('9l). A large Stanford contin
gent cheered on its old favorites.
The San Jose team could be thought of
as an extension of the Stanford women's
basketball team — four of the 10 players
went to Stanford, and more than half of
the front office has worked at Stanford or
for Hewlett-Packard Co. (see the connec
tion?). Even Tara VanDerveer, longtime
Stanford coach and gold medal-winning
Olympic coach, was honored for her illus
trious career at halftime.
Two of the three founding members of
the league once worked for the Stanford
Department of Athletics. Gary Cavalli,
one of the founders and former assistant
athletic director, claimed the league real
ized "a dream for millions of young girls
across the country — the dream of play
ing professional basketball in America."
In the postgame ceremonies Anne
Cribbs, the only woman founder, dedicat
ed the game "to all the women who have
played half-court in their lifetimes."
Both Cavalli and Cribbs, plus San
Jose Mayor Susan Hemmer, who called
the new league "the highlight of my life
so far," are season-ticket holders of Stan
ford women's basketball.
Spectators at last weekend's game
knew at once that the ABL is not the
NBA. The sellout crowd was 4,550, and
the first half felt more like a college game
than a professional one. The atmosphere
was mellow — the fans were pumped and
enthusiastic and roared at every basket,
but they weren't fanatical. When they
booed the ref, there was no heat in it.
(You couldn't imagine anyone threaten
ing his mother.) On one play, Whiting
was called for traveling; she nodded and
handed the ball over to the ref. (You can't
imagine Dennis Rodman doing that.)
The pace of the game picked up in the
second half though, and the hope for the
success of the league grew astronomical
ly. The defining moment of the game
came late in the fourth quarter as the
Glory was making its comeback. Azzi
drove down the court and into Edwards
where she was called for the charge. Azzi
jumped up angrily and after a few heated
words to the referee, headed down the
court as the crowd loudly booed the refs.
Some feel the lack of flamboyant per
sonalities like Rodman will hurt the
ABL; but then, a fledgling league is hard
ly in the position to harbor enormous
egos. More damaging might be the
game's pace; while it seems more precise,
orderly and skill-oriented than the NBA,
it is much slower than the men's game.
The women take time to set up prop
erly and actually run an offense; but
there's less explosive athleticism, and no
high-flying, crowd-pleasing high jumps.
On one beautiful play, Atlanta's
Edwards stole a pass, took it down the
court as the crowd roared — and made a
layup. No dunk.

For fans of the amazing jam
there's a sense of letdown, of anti
climax. Perhaps that will hurt the
new women's league. But consider
ing the success of the Stanford
team, perhaps not.
The biggest difference in this

production is the sense that
women matter. In the crowd,
mothers with babies alternated
with tall teen-agers and young girls
wearing Azzi No. 8 jerseys.
It was a celebration of women, a
statement of support and faith in
their abilities and hope for the
future. For the players, it was time
to hear the cheers, to get the
acclaim, to finally be a star at
home. Now it's the women's turn.
