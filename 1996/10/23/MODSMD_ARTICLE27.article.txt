# After high school glory, Mathiesen shoots for a spot on the men's team

At first glance, freshman Mike Math
iesen is no different than any other member
of the Stanford men's basketball team. He
wears the same practice clothes and runs
the same drills as the rest of the players. All
he is missing is a scholarship.
Mathiesen, a freshman from nearby
Cupertino, is attempting to walk on to the
Cardinal basketball squad this year. He is
spending this week practicing with the
team, vying for a possible spot with two
other players, hoping for nothing more
than a shot at an uncompensated seat on
the Stanford bench. He is driven by his pas
sion for the sport.
"I enjoy playing basketball," Mathiesen
said. "I love the game."
Despite his 6-foot-7 frame and a high
school career that included first-team all
league honors and selection to several
regional all-star teams, Mathiesen was not
seriously recruited out of high school. He
was accepted early-decision into Stanford
and declined to seek out a school where he
would have a guaranteed spot on a team.

"I wanted to go to school to go to school
and not let basketball be the driving force,"
Mathiesen said.
Going to Stanford, though, didn't mean
giving up on his basketball career. He
worked last spring to establish a relation
ship with the Cardinal coaching staff — vis
iting practice, calling assistant coaches,
even talking briefly with head coach Mike
Montgomery — in an effort to get a "foot in
the door."
When classes began last month, he
inquired about preseason workouts and
participated in several open gym sessions
with the team.
The coaching staff invited him to formal
practice on Oct. 14, as one of three potential
new walk-ons. He won't find out if he has
made the team until late this week or early
next week, but he has already begun to feel
accepted by the other Stanford players.
On the practice floor, Mathiesen said,
there are no distinctions made between
scholarship players and walk-ons.
"It's not like they treat walk-ons as sec-

ond-class citizens," Mathiesen
said. "We're accepted by the team
as a teammate. We're treated just
the same as (scholarship players)
are.
Mathiesen is also dealing with
the sharp contrast between high

school and NCAA Division I bas
ketball. He is working harder,
doing more, pushing his skills
every day and says he has never
been so tired after practice.
"It's a lot more serious," Math
iesen said. "It's still lots of fun,
but you realize this is Division I.
This is big time."
Hailing from the Bay Area,
Mathiesen has grown very famil

iar, from a fan's perspective, with
the players on the Stanford team.
At first, he said, it was difficult to
make the transition from watch
ing the team to playing with it.
Mathiesen has since become
more comfortable and learns
from their skills. He has also got
ten to know them better on a per
sonal level.
"You can tell that they're good

players, but they're still real peo
ple," he said.
Now, he has his eye trained on
making the final roster cut. Doing
so, he said, would be a dream come
true.
"Just to run out on the court
for warmups, with the Band play
ing and the fans cheering — that
would be a great adrenaline rush,"
Mathiesen said.
