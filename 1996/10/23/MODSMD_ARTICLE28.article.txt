# Hoover's curiosity has become full-time sport
## 
### Vanessa Arrington Editorial staff 
Biking by Roble Field in the
afternoon, it is hard to miss the
hordes of people playing what
looks to be organized frisbee.
Many west campus residents
often wonder, "What are these
people doing?"
As a curious freshman in
Lagunita Court three years ago,
Abby Hoover felt the same way.
"I would see them playing
every day I biked by the field,"
Hoover said. "The people play
ing always looked like they were
having fun, yet they also looked
in shape. It looked like an ath
letic sport, whatever it was."
After discovering the name of
the sport — ultimate frisbee —
Hoover decided to further satis
fy her curiosity. In the fall of
her sophomore year, she joined
Stanford's women's club team.
Two years later, Hoover is now
both an integral player and one
of the two team captains.
Hoover decided to join the
ultimate team after she stopped
running for Stanford's track
squad. She had competed in the
400-meter hurdles in her fresh
man year. According to Hoover,
her year spent running Stanford
Track was filled with injuries
and frustration with her perfor
mance, which prevented her
from being fulfilled.
"It was a really hard deci
sion," Hoover said. "I was so
used to being considered an ath
lete. But I finally thought, 'I
can't stay in a sport for that rea
son.' I didn't have that drive
anymore (for track specifically),

but at the same time, I knew I
had to keep doing a sport.
"I had my eye on ultimate all
freshman year, when I would
think, 'If I weren't doing track,
I'd do this.' In the fall (of sopho
more year), I signed up for ulti
mate and then just kept going."
Hoover's athletic pursuits
began well before college in her
hometown of Albuquerque,
N.M. In her early youth she
played soccer and took ballet
lessons, and by high school she
was heavily involved in four
sports — soccer, basketball,
track and cross country.
Track was Hoover's favorite
activity and the one she excelled
at the most, judging by the
number of state championships
she has under her belt. In her
junior year of high school,
Hoover was the state champion
in the 100-meter and 300-meter
hurdles, in which she broke the
state record. Hoover defended
both of these championships her
senior year as well as becoming
the state champion in the long
jump and breaking the state
record she had set in the 300-
ineter hurdle the year before.
Hoover's speed has con
tributed to her success at ulti
mate frisbee, which also
requires aggression, accurate
throwing and a good field sense.
Hoover's weakness comes in the
form of what she called "a loopy
forehand."
According to Hoover, virtual
ly anyone joining an ultimate
frisbee team in college is a
beginner. She said the average
person coming out for Stan
ford's team has never spent
much time throwing a frisbee,
though the sport does seem to
attract a lot of former athletes.
"I would say 99 percent of the
people on our team have all done
varsity sports in high school, if
not in college," Hoover said. "We
have some soccer and field hock
ey players who generally have a
really good field sense and play
well, and people who have
thrown things, such as softball
players.
"The men's and women's
teams are also filled with people
who have done crew, run track
and played lacrosse," Hoover
said.
The women's team, which
currently consists of about 45
members, will be split up into
two teams — an A and a B team
— once the season gets under
way.
Though the men's and
women's teams got together for
a coed tournament last Satur
day, the season does not official
ly begin until December, when
the women travel to Santa Cruz
for the first tournament.
Fall quarter consists of three
hour practices three times a
week. At practice the ultimate
frisbee players jog, stretch, work
on drills to help with throwing,
practice offense and defense,
scrimmage and run sprints.
Winter quarter for the women
ultimate frisbee players will be
filled with "local" tournaments,
consisting of competitors from
schools all over California as
well as Oregon and Colorado,
according to Hoover. And come
springtime, the team hopes to
compete at the regional and
national championships.

Since Hoover has been on the
team, the Stanford women have
placed second at national compe
tition. This year, the team is
aiming to be No. 1.
"We want the national cham
pionship," Hoover said. "We def-

'The people who
come out for ultimate
tend to be fun-loving,
crazy people. It's the
people that have kept
me going.'

initely have a chance."
Hoover said, individual goals
include "working on my throws
to the point where I can throw
anything" and "running hard
and making my defenders tired."
As a captain, Hoover, along
with junior co-captain Andrea
Johnson, is responsible for run
ning practices, teaching the
rookies, making travel arrange
ments, doing administrative
work and dealing with the
finances. As a club sport, the
team receives some funding
from Stanford Club Sports, but
the members also do a number
of fund-raisers.
Hoover is also keeping busy as
kitchen manager of an eating
club in the Suites, where she has
lived her sophomore, junior and
senior years, minus a quarter
spent overseas in Florence,
Italy. She is also working on fin
ishing her urban studies major,
in which she is focusing on
urban design and architecture.
After graduation, Hoover
plans to work for a couple years
and eventually go to architec
ture school. She also would like
to continue playing ultimate for

a club team.
Hoover's current goals as a
captain of Stanford's team
revolve around the team having
fun and being close-knit, as well
as helping individuals get a lot
out of being ultimate frisbee
players, both athletically and
socially.
"The people who come out for
ultimate tend to be fun-loving,
crazy people," Hoover said. "It's
the people that have kept me
going. The first day I went to
practice I thought, 'These are
the people I've been looking for
at Stanford; this is the group I
belong in.' The game itself is
also really addictive."
Hoover advises beginners at
ultimate frisbee to stick with it
and not get frustrated with the
throwing.

"Ultimate looks a lot easier
than it is," Hoover said, which
makes it more difficult for new
comers who think they will be
proficient at the game right
away.
"The improvement of the
rookies in the past three weeks
though has been huge," Hoover
said. "The first day they couldn't
play a game together, and now
they're tearing all over the
place."
Hoover encourages all ath
letes to give ultimate frisbee a
try.
"I think athletes at all levels
can find enjoyment out of ulti
mate frisbee," she said. "I want
ultimate to get as much expo
sure as possible. It's a growing
sport, and I want it to grow
more."

but at the same time, I knew I
had to keep doing a sport.
"I had my eye on ultimate all
freshman year, when I would
think, 'If I weren't doing track,
I'd do this.' In the fall (of sopho
more year), I signed up for ulti
mate and then just kept going."
Hoover's athletic pursuits
began well before college in her
hometown of Albuquerque,
N.M. In her early youth she
played soccer and took ballet
lessons, and by high school she
was heavily involved in four
sports — soccer, basketball,
track and cross country.
Track was Hoover's favorite
activity and the one she excelled
at the most, judging by the
number of state championships
she has under her belt. In her
junior year of high school,
Hoover was the state champion
in the 100-meter and 300-meter
hurdles, in which she broke the
state record. Hoover defended
both of these championships her
senior year as well as becoming
the state champion in the long
jump and breaking the state
record she had set in the 300-
ineter hurdle the year before.
Hoover's speed has con
tributed to her success at ulti
mate frisbee, which also
requires aggression, accurate
throwing and a good field sense.
Hoover's weakness comes in the
form of what she called "a loopy
forehand."
According to Hoover, virtual
ly anyone joining an ultimate
frisbee team in college is a
beginner. She said the average
person coming out for Stan
ford's team has never spent
much time throwing a frisbee,
though the sport does seem to
attract a lot of former athletes.
"I would say 99 percent of the
people on our team have all done
varsity sports in high school, if
not in college," Hoover said. "We
have some soccer and field hock
ey players who generally have a
really good field sense and play
well, and people who have
thrown things, such as softball
players.
"The men's and women's
teams are also filled with people
who have done crew, run track
and played lacrosse," Hoover
said.
The women's team, which
currently consists of about 45
members, will be split up into
two teams — an A and a B team
— once the season gets under
way.
Though the men's and
women's teams got together for
a coed tournament last Satur
day, the season does not official
ly begin until December, when
the women travel to Santa Cruz
for the first tournament.
Fall quarter consists of three
hour practices three times a
week. At practice the ultimate
frisbee players jog, stretch, work
on drills to help with throwing,
practice offense and defense,
scrimmage and run sprints.
Winter quarter for the women
ultimate frisbee players will be
filled with "local" tournaments,
consisting of competitors from
schools all over California as
well as Oregon and Colorado,
according to Hoover. And come
springtime, the team hopes to
compete at the regional and
national championships.

Since Hoover has been on the
team, the Stanford women have
placed second at national compe
tition. This year, the team is
aiming to be No. 1.
"We want the national cham
pionship," Hoover said. "We def-

'The people who
come out for ultimate
tend to be fun-loving,
crazy people. It's the
people that have kept
me going.'

initely have a chance."
Hoover said, individual goals
include "working on my throws
to the point where I can throw
anything" and "running hard
and making my defenders tired."
As a captain, Hoover, along
with junior co-captain Andrea
Johnson, is responsible for run
ning practices, teaching the
rookies, making travel arrange
ments, doing administrative
work and dealing with the
finances. As a club sport, the
team receives some funding
from Stanford Club Sports, but
the members also do a number
of fund-raisers.
Hoover is also keeping busy as
kitchen manager of an eating
club in the Suites, where she has
lived her sophomore, junior and
senior years, minus a quarter
spent overseas in Florence,
Italy. She is also working on fin
ishing her urban studies major,
in which she is focusing on
urban design and architecture.
After graduation, Hoover
plans to work for a couple years
and eventually go to architec
ture school. She also would like
to continue playing ultimate for

a club team.
Hoover's current goals as a
captain of Stanford's team
revolve around the team having
fun and being close-knit, as well
as helping individuals get a lot
out of being ultimate frisbee
players, both athletically and
socially.
"The people who come out for
ultimate tend to be fun-loving,
crazy people," Hoover said. "It's
the people that have kept me
going. The first day I went to
practice I thought, 'These are
the people I've been looking for
at Stanford; this is the group I
belong in.' The game itself is
also really addictive."
Hoover advises beginners at
ultimate frisbee to stick with it
and not get frustrated with the
throwing.

"Ultimate looks a lot easier
than it is," Hoover said, which
makes it more difficult for new
comers who think they will be
proficient at the game right
away.
"The improvement of the
rookies in the past three weeks
though has been huge," Hoover
said. "The first day they couldn't
play a game together, and now
they're tearing all over the
place."
Hoover encourages all ath
letes to give ultimate frisbee a
try.
"I think athletes at all levels
can find enjoyment out of ulti
mate frisbee," she said. "I want
ultimate to get as much expo
sure as possible. It's a growing
sport, and I want it to grow
more."

Biking by Roble Field in the
afternoon, it is hard to miss the
hordes of people playing what
looks to be organized frisbee.
Many west campus residents
often wonder, "What are these
people doing?"
As a curious freshman in
Lagunita Court three years ago,
Abby Hoover felt the same way.
"I would see them playing
every day I biked by the field,"
Hoover said. "The people play
ing always looked like they were
having fun, yet they also looked
in shape. It looked like an ath
letic sport, whatever it was."
After discovering the name of
the sport — ultimate frisbee —
Hoover decided to further satis
fy her curiosity. In the fall of
her sophomore year, she joined
Stanford's women's club team.
Two years later, Hoover is now
both an integral player and one
of the two team captains.
Hoover decided to join the
ultimate team after she stopped
running for Stanford's track
squad. She had competed in the
400-meter hurdles in her fresh
man year. According to Hoover,
her year spent running Stanford
Track was filled with injuries
and frustration with her perfor
mance, which prevented her
from being fulfilled.
"It was a really hard deci
sion," Hoover said. "I was so
used to being considered an ath
lete. But I finally thought, 'I
can't stay in a sport for that rea
son.' I didn't have that drive
anymore (for track specifically),

but at the same time, I knew I
had to keep doing a sport.
"I had my eye on ultimate all
freshman year, when I would
think, 'If I weren't doing track,
I'd do this.' In the fall (of sopho
