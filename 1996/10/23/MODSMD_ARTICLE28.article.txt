# Hoover's curiosity has become full-time sport

Biking by Roble Field in the
afternoon, it is hard to miss the
hordes of people playing what
looks to be organized frisbee.
Many west campus residents
often wonder, "What are these
people doing?"
As a curious freshman in
Lagunita Court three years ago,
Abby Hoover felt the same way.
"I would see them playing
every day I biked by the field,"
Hoover said. "The people play
ing always looked like they were
having fun, yet they also looked
in shape. It looked like an ath
letic sport, whatever it was."
After discovering the name of
the sport — ultimate frisbee —
Hoover decided to further satis
fy her curiosity. In the fall of
her sophomore year, she joined
Stanford's women's club team.
Two years later, Hoover is now
both an integral player and one
of the two team captains.
Hoover decided to join the
ultimate team after she stopped
running for Stanford's track
squad. She had competed in the
400-meter hurdles in her fresh
man year. According to Hoover,
her year spent running Stanford
Track was filled with injuries
and frustration with her perfor
mance, which prevented her
from being fulfilled.
"It was a really hard deci
sion," Hoover said. "I was so
used to being considered an ath
lete. But I finally thought, 'I
can't stay in a sport for that rea
son.' I didn't have that drive
anymore (for track specifically),

but at the same time, I knew I
had to keep doing a sport.
"I had my eye on ultimate all
freshman year, when I would
think, 'If I weren't doing track,
I'd do this.' In the fall (of sopho
more year), I signed up for ulti
mate and then just kept going."
Hoover's athletic pursuits
began well before college in her
hometown of Albuquerque,
N.M. In her early youth she
played soccer and took ballet
lessons, and by high school she
was heavily involved in four
sports — soccer, basketball,
track and cross country.
Track was Hoover's favorite
activity and the one she excelled
at the most, judging by the
number of state championships
she has under her belt. In her
junior year of high school,
Hoover was the state champion
in the 100-meter and 300-meter
hurdles, in which she broke the
state record. Hoover defended
both of these championships her
senior year as well as becoming
the state champion in the long
jump and breaking the state
record she had set in the 300-
ineter hurdle the year before.
Hoover's speed has con
tributed to her success at ulti
mate frisbee, which also
requires aggression, accurate
throwing and a good field sense.
Hoover's weakness comes in the
form of what she called "a loopy
forehand."
According to Hoover, virtual
ly anyone joining an ultimate
frisbee team in college is a
beginner. She said the average
