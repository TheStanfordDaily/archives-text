# Here's how you play it

According to ultimate fris
bee player and captain Abby
Hoover, ultimate frisbee
requires skills used in football,
basketball and soccer.
The field used for ultimate
frisbee is similar to a football
field in that it has an end zone.
Team members score by catch
ing the disc (the term for the
frisbee) in the end zone. No
one can run with the disc in
hand.
Generally, the team is made
up of players who specialize in
one of three positions â€” han
dlers, rovers and deeps. Han
dlers control the disc the most
and thus are usually able to
throw the disc far and accu
rately. Rovers help the han
dlers advance the disc toward

the end zone, but they can also
receive the disc, which puts
them playing all over the field.
Deeps stay closest to the end
zone and focus on catching the
disc.
As a non-contact sport, play
ers can block the disc but not
each other. Ultimate frisbee is
currently self-refereed, which
Hoover said makes it compara
ble to pick-up basketball but
with a more complex proce
dure.
"The self-refereeing system
is bound up with the rules of
the game," Hoover said.
If ultimate frisbee contin
ues to be a self-refereed sport,
it has fewer chances of becom
ing a varsity sport. But if ulti
mate frisbee ceases to be a
self-refereed sport, it would
really change the game,
Hoover said.
