# University prepared in case of disaster
## Power outage reminds officials of potential situations and need for emergency plans 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
The effects of disasters such as earth
quakes are obvious here at Stanford. One
look at campus sites such as the Art Muse
um, the Quad and Green Library — still
damaged seven years after the Loma Prieta
Earthquake — makes the potential devasta
tion readily apparent.
Earthquake preparedness is preached
constantly at Stanford. Students are recom
mended to have earthquake kits available
and are given booklets each year urging them
to be ready for"the big one."
However, not everybody is as prepared as
may be necessary, a problem highlighted by
the Oct. 10 power outage.
Several misguided rats plunged the Uni
versity into darkness and, although the
power was restored within a day, damage
was done. From the annoyance of missing
"Friends" to the effects on laboratory re
search samples, students and faculty won
dered if everyone is as prepared as necessary.
Over the next three days, The Daily will
examine the various procedures Stanford, its
departments and its communications media
have in place to deal with tragedies, how
these procedures succeeded or failed in the
recent power outage and what changes are
being made as a result.
Blessing in disguise
Blessings come in many forms. To some,
even the recent power outage was a blessing

in a dark disguise.
"This was a reminder," said Dan Smith,
the special services manager with the Stan
ford Department of Public Safety. "A disas
ter could hit at anytime, and now is the time
to prepare for the next disaster."
In case of such a disaster, Stanford has an
Emr ncy Operations Plan. The official
purpose of the plan is to "effectively coordi
nate the use of University and community
resources to protect life and property imme
diately following a major natural or acciden
tal disaster on the Stanford University cam
pus."

In the case of the power outage,
the plan was never activated.
"However," said Smith, "we were
ready to activate on Friday, if the
power was not restored."
The plan was designed to be used
in the case of a serious earthquake,
as that represents "the worst-case
scenario," according to Smith. "It
can be activated by anybody from
the police department. The reason
is, we're here 24 hours a day."
Top priorities
If the plan is called
into effect, members of the emer
gency policy and operations groups
meet at the Emergency Operations
Center on Serra Street.
The plan dictates three levels of
priorities. The first level priorities
include establishing a communica
tion network; suppressing fires; co
ordinating search and rescue ef
forts; evaluating utilities and
roads; controlling hazardous sub
stances; and directing available
rescue forces, medical teams and
facilities.
Not surprisingly, areas of cam
pus dealing with such concerns, in
cluding the Medical Center, are
most prepared in the case of an
emergency.
"We have all sorts of systems
built in at the Medical Center to
offer redundancy in case of failure,"
said Medical Center spokesman
Mike Goodkind. "For example, in
the 1989 earthquake there were op
erations in progress when the
power went down. It was restored
within seconds due to the backup
power supply."
Goodkind said the Medical Cen
ter's disaster plan is prepared for al
most any contingency.
"We deal with an entire range of
issues through a very detailed,
book-size disaster plan. We have a
full-time staff to continuously re
view it."
For example, the Medical Center
has plans in case the buildings are

severely damaged. Patients would
be transferred to other hospitals or
safer parts of damaged buildings.
"These plans are well-re
hearsed," Goodkind said. "You
have to operate always assuming
that the power could go down.
We're a hospital."
On the other side of campus,
Stanford's student-run radio sta
tion, KZSU, also plays a big role in
first-priority concerns. The station
would become a primary source of
communication to the Stanford
community in the event of a disas
ter.
According to Bob Vaughan, as
sistant to the chief engineer at
KZSU, the station has a 4,000-watt
generator that can keep it on the air
"as long as we have fuel for it."
In case of a large-scale emer
gency, the station has broadcast
equipment ready to go at the con
trol center, so information can be
broadcast directly. If the station's
Memorial Hall studios and the
emergency headquarters are unin
habitable, remote broadcast loca
tions can be set up at several points
around campus where the cable is
accessible.
The station also has basic equip
ment at the transmitter in the
Foothills and provisions to stay
there if necessary, said Vaughan.
KZSU General Manager Sean
Kennedy said he went to the emer
gency meeting point during the last
outage, but nobody was there. He
added that he takes KZSU's role in
an emergency very seriously.
"In the 1989 earthquake,
KZSU was one of the only sta
tions in the Bay Area on the air,"
Kennedy said. "To me, we're the
lifeline of the University's
voice."
Vaughan said that the station is
currently addressing one potential
problem: At the transmitter site,
the antenna is attached to a tall
wooden telephone pole, which
Vaughan said has become a target
for dry rot and woodpeckers over
the years.
"If it fell, it could also damage
the building with the transmitter,"
he said.

Lesser priorities
Second-level priorities include
surveying facilities to determine if
they are inhabitable, organizing
shelter, distributing food and
water, setting up a sewer system,
establishing better communica
tions, caring for animals used in ex
periments, controlling crime and
coordinating psychological assis
tance.
Housing and Dining Services Di
rector Keith Guy said the power
outage was valuable in helping de
termine what to do in the case of a
disaster.
"That kind of event is one that
we've had so little experience with,"
Guy said.
Ricker and Manzanita were
among dining halls closed during
the outage. However, students
were able to go to other dining halls.
"We had a plan in the works that
if we had no power, we would have
fed students outside" with barbe
cues, salads and cold cuts, Guy said,
adding that he feels Housing and
Dining Services is "relatively pre
pared" for a tragedy, although the
department does not have a crafted
plan in place.
Guy said one problem Dining
Services has is that it is totally de
pendent on electricity. He said after
three to four days of no power, Din
ing Services would encounter seri
ous problems, as he knew of no gen
erators available.
"We'd have food spoilage prob
lems," he said. "We would call on
our food providers to provide for us
and come up with an emergency
feeding plan based on the basic nu
trition model."
Third-level priorities include se
curing valuable materials and Uni
versity records, surveying require
ments to begin academic opera
tions, and renewing the flow of sup
plies and equipment from off cam
pus.
Dan Smith said the emergency
plan is a well-rehearsed, well-devel
oped program.
"We have an annual exercise
where we get together and test it,"
he said. "Plus, I have regular com
munications with all involved."

Lessons from Northridge
On Jan. 17, 1994, Carmen
Ramos Chandler was a reporter for
the Los Angeles Daily News. She,
like the rest of the Los Angeles Area,
got a rude awakening that day.
Early that morning, an earth
quake jolted the area, destroying
freeways and crumbling buildings.
Chandler covered the devastation
on the campus of Cal State-North
ridge.
"All 353 buildings on campus
were damaged or destroyed," said
Chandler, now the director of news
and information for Cal State-
Northridge. "We had only one
phone working on the entire cam
pus."
It was a scene that many Stan
ford administrators and students
could relate to, based on their expe
riences in the Loma Prieta Earth
quake.
The devastation was much
worse in Cal State-Northridge's
case. Fortunately, the school had a
disaster plan, too, and had regular
disaster preparedness drills.
"It worked wonderfully," Chan
dler said. "They managed to get
everybody out. The highest-rank
ing person took charge, and the
maintenance people took things
upon themselves the way they
should."
However, not even a good plan
can prepare people enough, she
said.
She also said that "remembering
the little things" is important. For
example, a variety of languages
must be used in warnings due to
foreign student populations. She
also said groups such as deaf stu
dents must be remembered, too.
"If warnings and instructions
are all made in sound, how do you
communicate with the deaf student
population?" she asked.
"I learned that disaster plans are
great drills, but they are nothing
like the real thing."

Tomorrow: Response plans from
individual facilities, groups and
departments around campus and
more lessons frotn the power out

In case of a large-scale emer
gency, the station has broadcast
equipment ready to go at the con
trol center, so information can be
broadcast directly. If the station's
Memorial Hall studios and the
emergency headquarters are unin
habitable, remote broadcast loca
tions can be set up at several points
around campus where the cable is
accessible.
The station also has basic equip
ment at the transmitter in the
Foothills and provisions to stay
there if necessary, said Vaughan.
KZSU General Manager Sean
Kennedy said he went to the emer
gency meeting point during the last
outage, but nobody was there. He
added that he takes KZSU's role in
an emergency very seriously.
"In the 1989 earthquake,
KZSU was one of the only sta
tions in the Bay Area on the air,"
Kennedy said. "To me, we're the
lifeline of the University's
voice."
Vaughan said that the station is
currently addressing one potential
problem: At the transmitter site,
the antenna is attached to a tall
wooden telephone pole, which
Vaughan said has become a target
for dry rot and woodpeckers over
the years.
"If it fell, it could also damage
the building with the transmitter,"
he said.

Lesser priorities
Second-level priorities include
surveying facilities to determine if
they are inhabitable, organizing
shelter, distributing food and
water, setting up a sewer system,
establishing better communica
tions, caring for animals used in ex
periments, controlling crime and
coordinating psychological assis
tance.
Housing and Dining Services Di
rector Keith Guy said the power
outage was valuable in helping de
termine what to do in the case of a
disaster.
"That kind of event is one that
we've had so little experience with,"
Guy said.
Ricker and Manzanita were
among dining halls closed during
the outage. However, students
were able to go to other dining halls.
"We had a plan in the works that
if we had no power, we would have
fed students outside" with barbe
cues, salads and cold cuts, Guy said,
adding that he feels Housing and
Dining Services is "relatively pre
pared" for a tragedy, although the
department does not have a crafted
plan in place.
Guy said one problem Dining
Services has is that it is totally de
pendent on electricity. He said after
three to four days of no power, Din
ing Services would encounter seri
ous problems, as he knew of no gen
erators available.
"We'd have food spoilage prob
lems," he said. "We would call on
our food providers to provide for us
and come up with an emergency
feeding plan based on the basic nu
trition model."
Third-level priorities include se
curing valuable materials and Uni
versity records, surveying require
ments to begin academic opera
tions, and renewing the flow of sup
plies and equipment from off cam
pus.
Dan Smith said the emergency
plan is a well-rehearsed, well-devel
oped program.
"We have an annual exercise
where we get together and test it,"
he said. "Plus, I have regular com
munications with all involved."

Lessons from Northridge
On Jan. 17, 1994, Carmen
Ramos Chandler was a reporter for
the Los Angeles Daily News. She,
like the rest of the Los Angeles Area,
got a rude awakening that day.
Early that morning, an earth
quake jolted the area, destroying
freeways and crumbling buildings.
Chandler covered the devastation
on the campus of Cal State-North
ridge.
"All 353 buildings on campus
were damaged or destroyed," said
Chandler, now the director of news
and information for Cal State-
Northridge. "We had only one
phone working on the entire cam
pus."
It was a scene that many Stan
ford administrators and students
could relate to, based on their expe
riences in the Loma Prieta Earth
quake.
The devastation was much
worse in Cal State-Northridge's
case. Fortunately, the school had a
disaster plan, too, and had regular
disaster preparedness drills.
"It worked wonderfully," Chan
dler said. "They managed to get
everybody out. The highest-rank
ing person took charge, and the
maintenance people took things
upon themselves the way they
should."
However, not even a good plan
can prepare people enough, she
said.
She also said that "remembering
the little things" is important. For
example, a variety of languages
must be used in warnings due to
foreign student populations. She
also said groups such as deaf stu
dents must be remembered, too.
"If warnings and instructions
are all made in sound, how do you
communicate with the deaf student
population?" she asked.
"I learned that disaster plans are
great drills, but they are nothing
like the real thing."

Tomorrow: Response plans from
individual facilities, groups and
departments around campus and
more lessons frotn the power out
age.
The effects of disasters such as earth
quakes are obvious here at Stanford. One
look at campus sites such as the Art Muse
um, the Quad and Green Library — still
damaged seven years after the Loma Prieta
Earthquake — makes the potential devasta
tion readily apparent.
Earthquake preparedness is preached
constantly at Stanford. Students are recom
mended to have earthquake kits available
and are given booklets each year urging them
to be ready for"the big one."
However, not everybody is as prepared as
may be necessary, a problem highlighted by
the Oct. 10 power outage.
Several misguided rats plunged the Uni
versity into darkness and, although the
power was restored within a day, damage
was done. From the annoyance of missing
"Friends" to the effects on laboratory re
search samples, students and faculty won
dered if everyone is as prepared as necessary.
Over the next three days, The Daily will
examine the various procedures Stanford, its
departments and its communications media
have in place to deal with tragedies, how
these procedures succeeded or failed in the
recent power outage and what changes are
being made as a result.
Blessing in disguise
Blessings come in many forms. To some,
even the recent power outage was a blessing

in a dark disguise.
"This was a reminder," said Dan Smith,
the special services manager with the Stan
ford Department of Public Safety. "A disas
ter could hit at anytime, and now is the time
to prepare for the next disaster."
In case of such a disaster, Stanford has an
Emr ncy Operations Plan. The official
purpose of the plan is to "effectively coordi
nate the use of University and community
resources to protect life and property imme
diately following a major natural or acciden
tal disaster on the Stanford University cam
pus."

In the case of the power outage,
the plan was never activated.
"However," said Smith, "we were
ready to activate on Friday, if the
power was not restored."
The plan was designed to be used
in the case of a serious earthquake,
as that represents "the worst-case
scenario," according to Smith. "It
can be activated by anybody from
the police department. The reason
is, we're here 24 hours a day."
Top priorities
If the plan is called
into effect, members of the emer
gency policy and operations groups
meet at the Emergency Operations
Center on Serra Street.
The plan dictates three levels of
priorities. The first level priorities
include establishing a communica
tion network; suppressing fires; co
ordinating search and rescue ef
forts; evaluating utilities and
roads; controlling hazardous sub
stances; and directing available
rescue forces, medical teams and
facilities.
Not surprisingly, areas of cam
pus dealing with such concerns, in
cluding the Medical Center, are
most prepared in the case of an
emergency.
"We have all sorts of systems
built in at the Medical Center to
offer redundancy in case of failure,"
said Medical Center spokesman
Mike Goodkind. "For example, in
the 1989 earthquake there were op
erations in progress when the
power went down. It was restored
within seconds due to the backup
power supply."
Goodkind said the Medical Cen
ter's disaster plan is prepared for al
most any contingency.
"We deal with an entire range of
issues through a very detailed,
book-size disaster plan. We have a
full-time staff to continuously re
view it."
For example, the Medical Center
has plans in case the buildings are

severely damaged. Patients would
be transferred to other hospitals or
safer parts of damaged buildings.
"These plans are well-re
hearsed," Goodkind said. "You
have to operate always assuming
that the power could go down.
We're a hospital."
On the other side of campus,
Stanford's student-run radio sta
tion, KZSU, also plays a big role in
first-priority concerns. The station
would become a primary source of
communication to the Stanford
community in the event of a disas
ter.
According to Bob Vaughan, as
sistant to the chief engineer at
KZSU, the station has a 4,000-watt
generator that can keep it on the air
"as long as we have fuel for it."
In case of a large-scale emer
gency, the station has broadcast
equipment ready to go at the con
trol center, so information can be
broadcast directly. If the station's
Memorial Hall studios and the
emergency headquarters are unin
habitable, remote broadcast loca
tions can be set up at several points
around campus where the cable is
accessible.
