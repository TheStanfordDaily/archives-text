# University prepared in case of disaster
## Power outage reminds officials of potential situations and need for emergency plans 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
The effects of disasters such as earth
quakes are obvious here at Stanford. One
look at campus sites such as the Art Muse
um, the Quad and Green Library — still
damaged seven years after the Loma Prieta
Earthquake — makes the potential devasta
tion readily apparent.
Earthquake preparedness is preached
constantly at Stanford. Students are recom
mended to have earthquake kits available
and are given booklets each year urging them
to be ready for"the big one."
However, not everybody is as prepared as
may be necessary, a problem highlighted by
the Oct. 10 power outage.
Several misguided rats plunged the Uni
versity into darkness and, although the
power was restored within a day, damage
was done. From the annoyance of missing
"Friends" to the effects on laboratory re
search samples, students and faculty won
dered if everyone is as prepared as necessary.
Over the next three days, The Daily will
examine the various procedures Stanford, its
departments and its communications media
have in place to deal with tragedies, how
these procedures succeeded or failed in the
recent power outage and what changes are
being made as a result.
Blessing in disguise
Blessings come in many forms. To some,
even the recent power outage was a blessing

in a dark disguise.
"This was a reminder," said Dan Smith,
the special services manager with the Stan
ford Department of Public Safety. "A disas
ter could hit at anytime, and now is the time
to prepare for the next disaster."
In case of such a disaster, Stanford has an
Emr ncy Operations Plan. The official
purpose of the plan is to "effectively coordi
nate the use of University and community
resources to protect life and property imme
diately following a major natural or acciden
tal disaster on the Stanford University cam
pus."
