### Hillary Stamm 
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi, inven
tor of the birth control pill, was present
ed with the 1996 Sovereign Fund award
yesterday for his "exceptional vision,
commitment and achievement in the
pursuit of individual freedom."
The 13th recipient of the award,
which includes a cash gift of $20,000, is

the first scientist ever to win.
"I cannot think of any scientist who
deserves the award as much as you,"
Kurt Simon, founder and chair of the
fund, told the professor at a presenta
tion ceremony in Djerassi's office.
Established in 1981, the Sovereign
Fund is a non-profit California founda
tion which is committed to rewarding
citizens who make unique contributions

to the cause of personal liberty. The
foundation's goal is "to inspire others to
cherish and protect those liberties which
are a part of our national heritage but
which need constant vigilance and sup
port," according to its mission state
ment.
The fund recognized Djerassi for his
unique and original contributions to sci
ence in his development of the birth con

trol pill.
Accordmg to a press release distrib
uted by fund officials, Djerassi "man
aged to develop a tiny caplet capable of
preventing what eons of magic potions,
powders, charms and spells could not
stop. Thanks in large part to his vision
and tenacity, an estimated 80 million
women currently use the pill and, in
the process, reduce their chances of
unplanned pregnancy to virtually
zero."
Djerassi was pleased to have his
work recognized. "I am honored to
receive the Sovereign Fund award,"
he said. "I am especially proud to be
the first research scientist to be
awarded this tribute to individual
freedom."
Although praised for his unique
scientific discovery, Djerassi said he
cannot take all the credit.

"Science is a cooperative but
competitive field," he said. "We step
on the shoulders of each other."
The Sovereign Fund award is
just one in the many accomplish
ments in Djerassi's long string of
achievements. An undergraduate
professor at Stanford, he is also a
renowned chemist and author of
four novels. In addition, Djerassi
writes poetry and is known as the
developer of many antihistamines.
Past Sovereign Fund Reward re
cipients include Jack Kevorkian —
the only doctor in the United States
who openly promotes physician-as
sisted suicide — and John Moss, au
thor of the federal Freedom of In
formation Act.
