## White Plaza fair introduces election candidates, issues 
### Kelly Thomas 
To prepare for the election in two
weeks, students had a chance to
gather information about various
candidates and propositions at a
campaign fair in White Plaza yes
terday.
Organized by Stanford In Gov
ernment, the campaign fair was the
first of its kind on campus.
Volunteers from the Republican

and Democratic parties, as well as from other political
parties such as the Green, Libertarian and Reform
parties, set up tables and passed out political litera
ture and souvenirs. Each party hoped to inform stu
dents about its presidential candidate and elicit sup
port for its campaign.
"We just want students to become more involved
and make educated decisions on Election Day," said
junior Danny Bramzon, president of the Stanford Re
publican Youth Majority. "We are asking for volun
teers to help the Dole campaign by participating in
precinct walks and telephone rallies."
Other groups tried to find volunteers for their can
didates or causes, but most of the representatives
were more concerned with trying to mobilize people to
vote in the election.
"We hope to get as many people as possible at the
polls on Election Day," said Liz Webber, a representa
tive of Freedom Fall '96.
Some local candidates also came to talk to students
about the upcoming election, including Stanford
alumnus Ted Lempert, who is running for an Assem
bly seat, and Patrick Shannon, a Senate candidate.
County supervisor candidate Joe Simitian, who
was also at White Plaza, said he thought the campaign
fair was a great way to educate students about the
candidates and their positions.
"I've eryoyed having the chance to talk directly
with students. Many don't even know what a county
supervisor does," Simitian said.

Even though he said the fair did
not attract as many students as he
would have liked, Simitian added
that he was "glad that people
didn't just glance at the tables but
actually came up to ask ques
tions."
Other tables sought to inform

students about various ballots
measures, including Proposition
209, sometimes known as the Cali
fornia Civil Rights Initiative. Cam
paigners hoped to publicize the
measures and their potential ram
ifications.
"We want students to have as
much information as possible so
that they can vote their conscience
on Election Day," said Harry
Tong, a volunteer working to gath
er support for Prop. 209.

Elizabeth Pianca, a sophomore
and SlG's director for campus
awareness, helped organize the
fair.
"There has never been an orga
nized effort to bring a collection of
people involved in political issues
to campus before," she said. : 'We
want students to be aware of
what's out there so they have some
ideas when they go to vote on Nov.
5."
Freshman Ritik Dholakia, a

volunteer for the Green Party,
agreed that the fair was a good
way to promote student political
awareness.
"With so many tables, the fair
offers all different perspectives so
students can have all their ques
tions answered and dispel any mis
conceptions they may have," he
said.
Pianca said SIG plans to contin
ue holding campaign fairs in the
future.
