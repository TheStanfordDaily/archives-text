## White Plaza fair introduces election candidates, issues 
### Kelly Thomas 
To prepare for the election in two
weeks, students had a chance to
gather information about various
candidates and propositions at a
campaign fair in White Plaza yes
terday.
Organized by Stanford In Gov
ernment, the campaign fair was the
first of its kind on campus.
Volunteers from the Republican

and Democratic parties, as well as from other political
parties such as the Green, Libertarian and Reform
parties, set up tables and passed out political litera
ture and souvenirs. Each party hoped to inform stu
dents about its presidential candidate and elicit sup
port for its campaign.
"We just want students to become more involved
and make educated decisions on Election Day," said
junior Danny Bramzon, president of the Stanford Re
publican Youth Majority. "We are asking for volun
teers to help the Dole campaign by participating in
precinct walks and telephone rallies."
Other groups tried to find volunteers for their can
didates or causes, but most of the representatives
were more concerned with trying to mobilize people to
vote in the election.
"We hope to get as many people as possible at the
polls on Election Day," said Liz Webber, a representa
tive of Freedom Fall '96.
Some local candidates also came to talk to students
about the upcoming election, including Stanford
alumnus Ted Lempert, who is running for an Assem
bly seat, and Patrick Shannon, a Senate candidate.
County supervisor candidate Joe Simitian, who
was also at White Plaza, said he thought the campaign
fair was a great way to educate students about the
candidates and their positions.
"I've eryoyed having the chance to talk directly
with students. Many don't even know what a county
supervisor does," Simitian said.
