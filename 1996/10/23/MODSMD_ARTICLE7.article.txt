### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
State Sen. Byron Sher brought an opti
mistic message to the Stanford Democrats
in an informal discussion last night at the
Haas Center for Public Service, arguing
that his prospects for retaining the seat
that he won in a special election last spring
"look good."

Sher, a professor emeritus at the Law
School, pointed to a 10-point victory in
that race with Republican candidate
Patrick Shannon, who will be Sher's oppo
nent once again in the Nov. 5 election.
He also trumpeted his work in the most
recent state Senate session. He called the
Senate a "bulwark agent" against legisla-

tion drafted in the state Assembly,
which Sher referred to as "Newt
west."
Sher served in the Assembly for
16 years before he left to run for his
Senate seat last March. He would
have been forced to leave the as
sembly at the end of that term due
to term-limit laws.
In particular, he praised the Sen
ate for its actions on environmental
issues. "We defeated a bunch of bills
that wanted to attack our basic en
vironmental laws," he said.
Most of Sher's time was devot
ed to answering the questions of
the dozen student Democrats in
attendance. He discussed several
of his own political beliefs, includ
ing his stance against the death
penalty. Although that opinion
puts him in the minorit) among
politicians, he said, he is commit

ted to it and not afraid to be frank
with the public.
"You have to (stand up for it),
even though you know it's not what
most voters favor," he said.
He also talked about his views on
a number of California's ballot ini
tiatives. He said he will vote yes on
Proposition 215 — which would le
galize marijuana for some medicinal
uses — and supports jail-bond
Proposition 204. He advised against
Proposition 211, which would make
securities lawsuits easier to file, say
ing the issue of securities fraud is
best left up to the legislature.
"We're trying to solve that prob
lem," he said. "I generally don't like
initiatives that try to solve complex
problems by asking voters to vote
yes or no."
He ended his hour-long discus
sion with words of encouragement
for the student group. "It's great
that you want to go out and work
for candidates and propositions,"
he said. "Don't be fooled by polls.
We need those voters to turn out."
