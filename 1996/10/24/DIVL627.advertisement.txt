Hey, Intermission writers
(even if you haven't written for us yet, as long as you've gone through 101X)
On Friday, Oct. 25th (tomorrow) at noon in The Daily, Paul Tullis and Zev Borow from Might
Magazine in San Francisco are coming to share their wisdom with you.
Might, a 3-year-old magazine for people in their 2()s, covers cultural and political issues with energy and biting wit. It has been
identified by The Chicago Tribune as "side-splitting and hilarious" and by The Washington Post as "the best of the crop." Paul and
Zev also freelance for magazines such as Spin and Details and will answer questions about freelancing, entertainment writing and
how they got to be so cool. Plus, we're providing free pizza.
Questions? Call 5-21 (X) and ask for Curtis.
