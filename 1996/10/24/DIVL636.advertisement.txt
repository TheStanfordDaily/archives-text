I )ear Stymied in Stern, Duh? You're
both drunk! Of course he's busting
a move. If the two of you were
sober, maybe he would just be
wanting to lean against you, but
leaning is definitely a sign, and if he
was sober, he'd know what he was
doing, so then you'd have to look at
other signs (what he's saying, where
he's touching and how, etc.) Aside
from being drunk, he probably
wants to bust a move ultimately,
but hasn't figured out how to while
sober yet. If you don't want his
move-busting, tell hint NOW be
fore he gets all worked up over it
and ends up embarrassing himself.
Guys appreciate it. â€” Experienced
