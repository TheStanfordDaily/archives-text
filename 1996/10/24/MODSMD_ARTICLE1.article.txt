# Debate among the third parties
## Candidates share views on government 
### Elise Lipkowitz 
Evoking the names and ideas
of America's founding fathers,
presidential candidates of the
U.S. Taxpayer's, Libertarian and
Natural Law parties shared their
visions for the nation's future in a
debate on campus last night.
The debate — organized by
ASSU President Bill Shen and
Stanford Libertarians President
Brian Singerman — allowed the
candidates to share their views
with an audience of about 300 at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, as well
as viewers of C-SPAN and local
stations.
Moderated by Shen, the de
bate gave Libertarian candidate
Harry Browne, Natural Law
Party candidate John Hagelin
and U.S. Taxpayer's Candidate
Howard Phillips the opportunity
to deliver opening statements, re

In addition, Browne advocated

United States."
When questioned about his
views on Defense Department ex
penditures, he emphasized that
they must be eliminated. "The
Department of Defense is the post
office in fatigues," he said.
He also advocated a retreat
from the United States' involve
ment in world politics. "If we are
responsible for the defense of Eu
rope, what are Europeans respon

Browne asked.
Advocating a more preven
tion-oriented approach, Hagelin
criticized the current govern
ment's responses to crises on a
case-by-case basis.
Hagelin focused on the need to
"uplift human behavior" by pro
moting education.
"Education is the cornerstone
of the Natural Law Party," he
said prior to the debate, adding
that "it is important to fund re
