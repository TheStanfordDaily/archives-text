# Debate among the third parties
## Candidates share views on government 
### Elise Lipkowitz 
Evoking the names and ideas
of America's founding fathers,
presidential candidates of the
U.S. Taxpayer's, Libertarian and
Natural Law parties shared their
visions for the nation's future in a
debate on campus last night.
The debate — organized by
ASSU President Bill Shen and
Stanford Libertarians President
Brian Singerman — allowed the
candidates to share their views
with an audience of about 300 at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, as well
as viewers of C-SPAN and local
stations.
Moderated by Shen, the de
bate gave Libertarian candidate
Harry Browne, Natural Law
Party candidate John Hagelin
and U.S. Taxpayer's Candidate
Howard Phillips the opportunity
to deliver opening statements, re
spond to a series of issues posed
by Shen and answer questions
asked by audience members.
Browne argued that excessive
government intervention in peo
ple's lives is the source of the na
tion's problems. Repeatedly stat
ing that government does not
work, he decried the current sys
tem of government which he
characterized as a "single party
divided into two wings."
In addition, Browne advocated
getting government out of busi

ness and repealing the federal in
come tax.
Furthermore, Browne pas
sionately argued that the solution
to immigration was not to close
the border but to "close down the
welcome wagon — the welfare
state that attracts people to the
United States."
When questioned about his
views on Defense Department ex
penditures, he emphasized that
they must be eliminated. "The
Department of Defense is the post
office in fatigues," he said.
He also advocated a retreat
from the United States' involve
ment in world politics. "If we are
responsible for the defense of Eu
rope, what are Europeans respon
sible for, the defense of Asia?"
Browne asked.
Advocating a more preven
tion-oriented approach, Hagelin
criticized the current govern
ment's responses to crises on a
case-by-case basis.
Hagelin focused on the need to
"uplift human behavior" by pro
moting education.
"Education is the cornerstone
of the Natural Law Party," he
said prior to the debate, adding
that "it is important to fund re
search as today's research is to
morrow's technology."
He added that education is a

means to promote harmony among
different racial and ethnic groups
and rehabilitate prisoners. He said
he strongly believes that every per
son who wants to obtain a college
education should have the ability to
afford to do so.
Phillips, the U.S. Taxpayer's

candidate, indicated the need to
limit government to its constitu
tionally prescribed roles.
"The current Republican Party
is divided over the issue of abortion
the way the Whig Party was divided
over the issue of slavery in the
1850s," he said before the debate.
He said he feels abortion is a viola
tion of a fetus' Fifth Amendment
rights and therefore should not be
performed for any reason.
On crime, he advocated the elim

ination of prisons, arguing for ex
tension of the death penalty and for
restitution as a solution for eco
nomic crimes. In order to deter ac
tivities such as prostitution,
Phillips proposed the reinstitution
of public humiliation.
He argued strongly against fed
eral funding for education, saying it
is "immoral for an able-bodied per
son, who may need to work twojobs
to support his family, to be forced to
finance the education of others."
