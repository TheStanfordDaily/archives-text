# Tiger tranforms the PGA
## 
### 
TULSA, Okla. (AP) - Thirty
five years ago the fairways shook
beneath the thundering feet of
Arnie's Army. Today the new wave
of fans sweeping over golf courses
could be called Tiger's Teens.
The sudden success of the 20-
year-old Woods in his first two
months as a professional has
focused attention on golf in a way
unseen since Arnold Palmer
proved to be the perfect partner for
golfs marriage with the relatively
new media of television.
The difference this time is that
Woods — barely removed from
being a teen-ager himself —
appears to be drawing teens and
pre-teens to the game in astonish
ing numbers.

Suddenly, kids see golf as cool,
not as an old-fogey game played by
elderly men in ugly plaid pants.
Nick Perez, 13, was watching
Woods play a practice round yes
terday for the elite Tour Champi
onship at Southern Hills Country
Club. It was the first time Perez
had attended a professional golf
tournament.
"Man, it's just incredible that
he's been able to do so well," Perez
said. "I've been following him the
whole day."
This new wave of fans is drawn
by a player whose perfectly crafted,
graceful swing routinely powers
the ball 40 yards farther than any
one else's. Woods stalks the course
wearing an icy stare of concentra

tion, then erupts with the fist
pumping, shouting enthusiasm of
a kid when a key putt drop.s.
"He's just so cool," said 12-year
old Derek Dickson, attending the
tournament with his school's 30-
member golf club. "It's really neat
that someone his age can beat
everybody."
Arid that is exactly what Woods
has done.
Since turning professional Aug.
27 after winning an unprecedent
ed third consecutive U.S. Amateur
Championship, Woods has played
in seven PGA Tour events, win
ning two, finishing third twice,
fifth once and 11th once.
He has won $734,794 in just
seven events — ranked 23rd on the

PGA Tour money list against play
ers who have played as many as 29
tournaments.
When he tees off' today in the
'J our Championship, the season
ending event limited to the top 30
money winners on tour, he will be
playing against Greg Norman and
Nick Faido, two of the top names
on the PGA Tour, for the first
time.
While it is too early to tell
whether more children are playing
golf or watching it on television, all
it takes is a quick look at the
crowds to see Woods' effect.
Dozens of young faces press
against the gallery ropes, small
hands offering pens to Woods and
pleading for an autograph.
