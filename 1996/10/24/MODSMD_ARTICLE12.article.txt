Task force must create
more frosh dorms, give
top priority to seniors

4 TERN? BUT WAIT!
I'm a senior! This isn't
Kj fair!"
"A four-class dorm? I asked for
all frosh! I haven't even gotten to
campus yet, and I'm already disap
pointed."
From gripes of annoyance to
downright anger, Stanford stu
dents are rarely satisfied with
their housing Draw results or
placement for freshman-year
housing.
To help ease some Draw-time
frustration and panic, University
President Gerhard Casper recent
ly called for the formation of the
Task Force on Residential Pro
grams and Student Housing for
Undergraduates. The task force,
which will be led by Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Education
Ramon Saldi'var, will look at the
proper relationship between resi
dential programs and undergradu
ate education and evaluate the
Draw. Hallelujah!
Casper has given the task force
some guidance by suggesting the
options of giving older students
priority in the Draw and ensuring
that more freshmen get their top
choices in housing.
With these options in mind, The
Daily would like to make a few
suggestions:
First, freshman year is the most
important year at Stanford in
terms of feeling comfortable in a
new environment and forming
lasting friendships.
Freshman dorms are some of
the most exciting, close-knit places
on campus in which these two cri
teria are often best met. Sadly, the
University has not been able to
accommodate all freshmen re
questing this option. In fact, the
shortage of spaces in all-freshman
dorms has reached 400 beds.
The task force must accommo

date more, if not all, of the fresh
men who opt for all-frosh housing.
This can be done simply by adjust
ing the configuration of a few
dorms. For example, East Florence
Moore Hall consists of three dorms
— Alondra, an all-frosh dorm, and
Cardenal and Faisan, four-class
dorms. Why not make Faisan an
all-freshman dorm and put those
would-be Faisan upperclassmen
into Cardenal or vice versa? This
way, the numbers of freshmen and
upperclassmen in East Flo Mo
would be roughly the same, but
more freshmen would be satisfied.
These three dorms — like several
other clusters of dorms on campus
— participate in activities together
so the upperclassmen and frosh
would still get to know each other
but would be more pleased with
their own living arrangements.
However, the task force must
also ensure that freshmen who
want to be placed in four-class
dorms still have that option. Some
students may want the experience
of older students or may not be
interested in the typical excite
ment and constant noise of an all
freshman dorm. Understandable.
Perhaps the second-most defin
ing year is the senior year, as stu
dents experience the one last
hoorah of college life. Who wants
to have that one last hoorah in
Lagunita? Seniors should be given
the top priority so they can experi
ence at least one blessed year.
Seniors have different needs
than younger students. They are
writing honors theses, applying
for jobs or graduate schools and
taking entrance exams. These can
be made next to impossible in a
large, loud dorm with strict hours
for eating meals. Therefore, the
task force should give seniors the
priority by ensuring that their
Draw numbers fall below 1000.
Oh, and one. more thing. Casper
recommended that the task force
submit its findings by the end of
spring quarter. But how about in
time for next year's Draw? A lot of
us are juniors . . . well, it's just a
thought.
