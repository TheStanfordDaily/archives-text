## Whatever doesn't kill you... 
### 
Although td experienced
it to some degree before, it
wasn't really until college that I
noticed how sad the racial issues discus
sion can be. As a black, Vermont board
ing school-educated woman, I'd been
used to feeling some degree of annoy
ance at the inevitable ignorance that
came from my mostly white colleagues
concerning who I was, where I came
from and how I defined myself. I have
been asked how I feel about being called
colored, and I have had people exclaim
to me, "Oh my GAWD! Your hands are
white!" People were surprised to learn
that yes, I tan.
Here at Stanford there is something
strange in the racial issues discussion-
It isn't just a personal and political
issue here, it's a fear issue. People start
rolling their eyes when you mention
race in any setting, or they start recit
ing a mantra about how they are not
black, can't understand and don't want
to talk about it.
A friend of mine told me once that
she felt an unwillingness to talk about
race with anyone besides her closest
friends because she was afraid of being
labeled a racist. She happens to have
two very good friends who are of differ
ent ethnic backgrounds. But what
about the rest of you? Most people at
Stanford hang out with people who
look, dress and talk just like them. How
are we to learn about another way of
looking at things if we don't even try to

educate ourselves?
During a dinner conversation my
freshman year, the question of ethnic
theme houses came up. The table quick
ly cleared, to the point where the only
people left were an upperclassman and
me. A passer-by, who was a year ahead
of me, had heard a version of the con
versation already. "Don't even bother,"
he cried over his shoulder. "This con
versation has been had a thousand
times before, and you won't get any
where!"
But he was wrong. I learned a great
deal from the conversation. I learned
that my companion in argument was
against ethnic theme houses because he
didn't feel comfortable going some
where where he would be
by a of people who had a different
notion of culture than he had. Because
HE wouldn't feel comfortable there, it
was an exclusionary place to have on
campus. He didn't want ethnic theme
houses to be on campus because he
didn't want to feel left out of some
thing. It hurts too much to be left out.
But what about us? Better yet, what
about multiracial students?
I think that the Stanford community
is chronically afraid of mental pain. It's
one thing to discuss what it must have
felt like to be relegated to churning but
ter in pre-colonial America, but it's
quite another thing to hear someone
who lives next door tell you that they
are constantly followed around in stores

because people are afraid they'll steal
something, or that people always
assume that they live in the ghetto or
don't know their father. The same way
that it's more difficult to watch a rape
in person than it is to watch a movie
about rape, it's more difficult to learn
about racial issues that affect the peo
ple that you (barely) know. It hurts.
What is education if it isn't learning
to deal with pain? Don't tell me that
you weren't just the slightest bit upset
when you found out where babies actu
ally come from. Don't try and make me
think that you every moment .of
your life here. Don't tell me that you
actually enjoy running. Ask your moth
er how good it felt to give birth to you.
Painful things, all. But the rewards
that come later are worth the initial
pain.
Wouldn't you rather have a little
mental agony now so that you can feel
some sort of calm later? If your answer
is no, you don't belong in college. Get
your ass into corporate Amerikkka
where you belong. If your answer is yes,
congratulations! You are an official
minority. Now take that foot off of your
neck and make an effort to meet your
people. You'll be better off for it.
