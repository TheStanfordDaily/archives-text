We cannot fairly judge other cultures by our morality

GARRY GRUNDY WRITES in
"Truth is not always relative"
(Tuesday's Daily) that Stanford's
curriculum contains nothing more than
"bullshit." But in refusing to consider the
values of other cultures, he reveals a nar
row-minded point of view that is glued to
an inflexible, even harmful moral abso
lutism.
Grundy calls discussions in Cultures,
Ideas and Values on ancient Greek ped
erasty "unbridled relativism." However,
he refuses to consider that ancient Greece
is not Phoenix, that the moral system of
the Greeks is not the same as his. Imme
diately denouncing the Greeks as "shame
less," he closes his mind to the study of a
different culture.
The problem lies in that he attempts to
apply today's moral standards to the
studv of ancient Greek culture. If a next

door neighbor were to indulge in ped
erasty, we could justifiably invoke our
"strong and rigid principles" and turn
him in to the police. However, to
denounce another culture for having
moral principles different from our own is
to engage in a dangerous sort of intoler
ance; for morality is not absolute.
He seems to think so, however. He
gives the example that two and two
always equal four. Therefore, he says,
what we consider "immoral" acts are
always immoral, no matter what the con
text. But beyond mathematical logic, little
is absolute, much less moral "truth." If
only one set of morals is absolute, if only
one point of view is the truth, then politi
cal and ethical debate would be meaning
less. Even in our own society, not to men
tion other societies, "truth" can be inter
preted in many ways, without the com-

promise of any rigid principles. To assert
that a moral absolute exists is to ask
everyone to conform to that absolute. It is
to claim that all people should think alike.
In essence, relativism is necessary in
our attitudes toward others. Conceivably,
using Grundy's logic, a vegetarian society
could call our meat-eating culture
"shameless" and even "evil." Is that the
absolute truth? For the vegetarians, yes.
For the majority of us, no. We can, like he
says, "deem certain behaviors intolera
ble." That is our prerogative. But we can
not say that our opinions and our moral
values are the absolute truth. Relativism
is not something we choose. We must take
it into account, lest we become intolerant
fascists hell-bent on converting everyone
to our own beliefs.
The purpose of an education is to
broaden our minds, to allow us to under

stand, if not accept, other beliefs and
other moral systems. By learning about
Greek pederasty, a student is not asked to
start believing that pederasty is good in
the modern world, but rather that it was
accepted in ancient Greek culture. No one
is asking Grundy to give up his values,
but rather to see that other people might
think differently. To close our minds tc
this and force ourselves to see our own
values as the only and absolute truth
would be a failing indeed.
We are fortunate that we attend a Uni
versity where "the winds of freedom
blow." Even if the air is hot, as Grundy
claims, fresh air would be far better for
the mind than a stale old "veritas" which
claims to be absolute. Far too often, a
claim of "veritas" means intolerance.
