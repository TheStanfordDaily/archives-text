# ASSU unfairly denied funds for pro-life group due to its conservatism
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate should be ashamed
of itself for the blatant double standard
displayed in its refusal to fund Students
for Life. I am not a member of the pro
life movement and had not even heard of
Students for Life until yesterday's arti
cle. However, the refusal to deny the
group's funding has little do with its pur
ported partisanship and is based more on
its non-politically correct stance. A ques
tion: Does the ASSU fund African-Amer
ican groups, Chicano groups and homo
sexual groups? Just as the pro-life move
ment is generally allied with the Republi
can arena, these special interest groups

stand firmly in the realm of the
Democrats. Yet we fund them and refuse
money to Students for Life.
I won't be personally affected by this
decision, as I long ago decided that the
pro-life movement was not in accord
with my personal beliefs. This move
ment, however, is a legitimate form of
expression and is no more partisan than
many other funded groups on campus.
While it will be argued by some feminists
that Students for Life is trying to push
its agenda on many who are unwilling to
accept it, the same would be argued by a
Southern Baptist in response to the
agenda of any gay rights group.
Apparently the senate believes in tol
erance and freedom of speech, but only
when the discussion conforms to specific,
proscribed standards. I only hope that
the senators realize the hypocrisy which
is inherent in their choices before it leads

to worse forms of intolerance.
