# Interconnections with outside world can do more harm than good
## 
### 
The juxtaposition Friday of James Sil
ver's article calling on Stanford students
to go out into the surrounding communi
ties and Dr. Hilton's letter calling for an
interconnection between power sources of
Stanford, PG&E and Palo Alto was fortu
itous.
Both interconnections bring the
advantage of adding support from the
outside world, but both also bring the
possibility of the outer world demanding
support from Stanford. The last big out

age we experienced, the one that
blacked out the West Coast, was as
severe and long-lasting as it was at least
in part because of interconnections and
because so much power was being
imported.
Since the Stanford plant probably has
little spare capacity to help out Palo Alto
or PG&E, the benefit of interconnection
would be one way and would carry a
price.
If California had listened to engineers
instead of Aquarians, we would have sev
eral dozen nuclear power plants running
down the coast supplying cheap power
and all the distilled water our coastal com
munities could use. Instead we have wind
mills and squirrels and far away dams try
ing to pull the state's economy. Saying no
can carry a price as onerous as saying yes.
