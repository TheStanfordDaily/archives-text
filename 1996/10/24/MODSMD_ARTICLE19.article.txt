# Carolyn Sleeth: From Russia with love
## A
						child prostitute puts Stanford life in perspective 
### 
Drinking instant Nescafe
coffee and smoking Bond
cigarettes with a veteran child
prostitute was the last place I expected to
find myself on Saturday.
But there I was, in Sergei's one-room
apartment on the northern edge of
Moscow, talking to a boy younger than I
am about his fear of AIDS, whether he
loved the most recent of his many "hus
bands" and if he had ever participated in
sadomasochistic acts. His stories were all
bitter, somewhat like my cigarette.
I had decided the weekend before that I
needed a job; I wanted to work and find
out the inside secrets of this sprawling and
dirty city. I applied to work as a reporter
for a tiny, English entertainment paper
here, and despite my pathetic Russian
skills, the editor hired me. He needed
someone gutsy (or stupid) enough to write
an article the paper had been meaning to
do for a while: child prostitution.
Naively, I agreed. The editor said he
knew a kid who might help me get started
and then gave me Sergei's phone number.

I called, and Sergei said he would meet me
on the platform of his metro station later
that afternoon.
Only 20, Sergei began prostituting him
self at the age of 11, after running away
from home — from a mother who drank
too much and was a prostitute herself. He
lived for a while in the abandoned train
cars outside the Moscow metro station but
was picked up one day by a man who asked
him, "Do you like me? Do you want to
learn to play a game?"
Since then, Sergei has gone by the
pseudonym of "Beliya Snezhka" which
translates as "Snow White." He showed
me a pop-up Hallmark card of Snow White
and the seven dwarfs as he explained this,
and he pointed to the figure of Snow
White. "See," Sergei said. "That's me, that
is how they call me."
The young male prostitutes hang out in
an area of downtown Moscow called Plesh
ka, in front of the major tourist hotels
near Red Square. Sergei said when he
a potential client, he winks and asks if the
man likes him and wants to spend the

night with him.
In his prime — age 15 for most boys —
Sergei made between $500 and $600 a
night, usually with three or four clients. "I
lived like a queen — I could go to McDon
ald's everyday," Sergei said, smiling at the
memory.
Once a customer becomes more regu
lar, the boys tease each other, pretending
their friend has "married" the man. Some
times, boys move into their husbands'
apartments for months at a time, which
gives them a place to sleep and regular
meals. I asked Sergei if he had ever loved
any of his husbands. He denied it, saying
he was not attracted to any of the men,
and he thought he had lost the ability to
ever love anyone.
The boys who work the Pleshka area
operate as either "girls" or "boys" —
meaning that they are either passive or
active lovers. Sergei said he insisted on
being a "girl" when he was with a client,
otherwise he refused to leave the park
with the potential client. Occasionally he
dressed up in women's clothes; the female

prostitutes he knew gave him old dresses
and shoes.
Sergei said his fear was strongest when
he got into the car with a new customer.
He feared venereal diseases; syphilis and
gonorrhea are rampant here. He was
afraid of gang bangs, or "suebotnik," that
the client is taking him to a dark apart
ment where sometimes more than 10 peo
ple are waiting. He hates the Moscow
police, who sometimes, under the guise of
checking for documents, force the boys
into the police station and rape them there.
Fighting back is never an option,
according to Sergei. "If you fight, they can
kill you, and no one ever knows what hap
pened," he said. "It is better to be passive."
All of this I listen to as calmly as possi
ble, sipping my lukewarm Nescafe and
sucking on my cigarette. I try to pretend to
myself that Sergei had a job, like anyone
else has a job. I also take it with a grain of
salt; I wonder if some of his stories are fab
ricated to impress me. Thinking he might
be lying makes the story easier to digest.
I compare myself with Sergei. I live in

my sheltered Stanford world; I take aca
demic classes, pondering the importance
of Peter the Great's reforms. Sergei pon
ders the number of people he will face in a
stranger's apartment that night. But 1
also realize I like talking to Sergei, and
that I am comfortable in his tiny apart
ment. I am tempted to be his friend, to
attempt a peer relationship and hang out
as equals.
But I think again. Despite our similar
age, Sergei is not my peer. I am not better
or worse, we are just too different to ever
empathize or understand each other's
problems. I could never be his friend. I like
my sheltered life and involving myself per
manently frightens me like suebotnik
frightens Sergei. If I am naive and blind to
reality, I want to stay that way.

Carolyn Sleeth is a junior studying at
Stanford in Moscow.
