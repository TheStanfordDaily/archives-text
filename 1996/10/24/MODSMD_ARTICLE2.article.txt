The Carnegie Foundation for the Advance
ment of Teaching has appointed Education Prof.
Lee Shulman as its new president and has
agreed to move its headquarters to Palo Alto as a
result of the appointment.
Shulman, the Charles E. Ducommun Profes
sor of Education, said he expects the foundation
to develop a symbiotic relationship with the
School of Education. It currently is located in
Princeton, N.J.

"It's a wonderful opportunity for everyone in
volved," he said. "I strongly believe that Stan
ford will benefit from the foundation's pres
ence."
An influential research and policy center, the
Carnegie Foundation focuses on educational
policy at all levels of instruction. Shulman has
worked with the foundation before, most no
tably on a project which contributed directly to
the creation of the National Board for Teaching
Standards.
Shulman will also maintain ties to the Uni

versity, retaining his official position in the
School of Education, although with more limited
responsibilities.
Shulman said he expects the foundation to as
sume a role similar to that of the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. The
center — also located in Palo Alto — is complete
ly independent of the University but interacts
regularly with the Psychology Department.
He added that the Carnegie Foundation will
present "definite opportunities for
research by Stanford students."
An expert on teaching and
teacher training, Shulman has cen
tered his work at Stanford on the
assessment of teaching at all levels
of education. He said he hopes to
continue his work on the impor
tance of emphasizing university
teaching rather than research.
Although Shulman said he sees
his future with the foundation as
"wide open," other possible pro
jects include studies on the transi

tions between high school, college
and graduate school, as well as re
search into the limiting effects of
the Advanced Placement system on
the high school curriculum.
When asked what influenced his
career move, Shulman emphasized
the foundation's esteemed position
in the field of education. The foun
dation's $90-million endowment
will give Shulman increased oppor
tunities to advance his cause of ed
ucational reform.
Shulman has been the recipient
of various honors in his field, includ
ing the 1995 American Psychologi
cal Association's E.L. Thorndike
Award for distinguished psychologi
cal contributions to education.
