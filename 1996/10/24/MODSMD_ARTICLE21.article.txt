## On the home front Men greet Anteaters, Gauchos 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
The men's soccer team matches up
against two UC rivals this weekend.
The team meets the UC-Irvine
Anteaters tomorrow and the UC-Santa
Barbara Gauchos on Sunday in noon
contests at Maloney Field.
Despite the Anteaters' mediocre
record of 6-5-2 (2-2-1 Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation), Irvine, like the
Cardinal (5-4-4, 1-2-1), has played sev
eral top-notch teams competitively but
had to settle for a tie or loss. The
Anteaters tied No. 2 California earlier
this season in overtime and narrowly
lost to UCLA 2-1 last week.
Irvine has a well-known tendency to
play around with the ball, using the
whole field and getting everyone
involved, rather than using a direct
attack approach. This strategy has
worked effectively for the team thus
far this season. Indeed, all but three
starters have scored so far for the
Anteaters.
Irvine players to watch for are
sophomore midfielder Michael Muci
no, who leads the Anteaters in scoring
with 14 points on five goals and four
assists, and sophomore midfielder
Patrick Lee, who is second with 12
points on five goals and two assists.
Junior forward Shandley Phillips is
playing particularly well of late, hav
ing scored a goal in each of the last
three games.

Although TJC-Irvine clearly is not a
soccer powerhouse of Cal's or Wash
ington's caliber, the Cardinal will nev
ertheless have to play smart soccer to
get the win. A good defensive effort
will again be key, but more important
ly, the Cardinal is going to have to find
the back of the net.
Stanford has recently been unable
to eke out wins against tough teams.

This weekend is a
tremendous opportunity
for us to get a great start
to the remaining five
games of the season.'

"Getting goals is part of the prob
lem, but we've also had a few unfortu
nate mental lapses, and a little bit of
bad luck, too," Stanford sophomore
defender Daniel Wytock said.
Of course, scoring will be equally
important against the Gauchos on
Sunday even though UC-Santa Bar
bara sports a dismal 3-9-2 (1-4-0
MPSF) record. While the Cardinal
clearly has been more successful this
season, the Gauchos are not to be
taken lightly.
"Both teams can play with anyone,"
coach Bobby Clark said. "Santa Bar

bara and Irvine are both capable
teams, but we should certainly be able
to beat them, provided we tackle them
properly. This weekend is a tremen
dous opportunity for us to get a great
start to the remaining five games of
the season."
The Gauchos have been playing
without their starting goalkeeper since
the second game of the season after he
suffered a season-ending injury. Red
shirt freshman Trent Ulicny has
stepped in and holds a 1.68 goals
against average. At least some of their
losses might then be attributed to the
lack of experience in the net, although
the Gauchos are on the whole a young
team. In fact, they have nine freshmen
and only four seniors.
Though UC-Santa Barbara does not
have any prolific scorers this year, two
forwards to watch are senior midfield
er Ryan Schomberg, who leads the
team in points with six, and junior for
ward Danny Mann, who is second on
the team with five points. As a team,
the Gauchos have only scored 12 goals
while accumulating 33 points.
By comparison, Stanford's leading
scorer, sophomore midfielder A.J.
Sauer, has eight goals and 18 points.
Stanford will use its same aggres
sive system of frequent counterattacks
against both teams. It will make the
required minor adjustments that are
needed to play with both teams but
will basically use the same style as
always.
