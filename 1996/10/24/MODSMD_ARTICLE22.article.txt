# Co-captain leads by example
## Cross country star Jimmerson breaks the mold 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
Most leaders are pictured as
people who guide their follow
ers with bold actions and inspir
ing words; trat for cross country
co-captain Greg Jimmerson,
the*best method
others is to quietly set a good
example.
Jimmerson, a senior product

design major, is in his fourth
year on the team and is perhaps
the fastest man on the squad.
He is also a three-time Ail-
American and Academic Ail-
American selection for the Car
dinal.
Jimmerson's running career
IfegoYi in" his tiYwn etown of

"I started running when I

was about 8 years old," Jim
merson said. "I used to run
with my dad. He would run like
3 or 4 miles and I'd bike with
him. After a while, I started try
ing to run with him. I'd make it
about halfway usually, but
after that, it got to where I
could keep up with him.
"I went and saw [the movie
'Running Brave' about a
Native-American runner] with
my dad one day and that got me
really pumped up about run
ning," Jimmerson said. "I
remember I came home and I
ran like 25 laps around my din
ing room because he did 25 laps
in the [10-kilometer race]."
Jimmerson's running career
flourished at Stevens High
School where he became the
state cross country champion
for three consecutive years. He
went on to take second place at
the Kinney Nationals Cross
Country Championships and
also competed in the 2-mile
races at the Keebler and Golden
West Track Invitationals. He
placed third at the Keebler
meet, where he was beaten by
future Cardinal teammate J.J.
White.
After a strong freshman year
at Stanford, when he placed
seventh in the Pacific 10 Con
ference and 11th in the District
VIII meet, he went on to com
pete in March 1993 for the
United States in the World
Junior Cross Country Champi
onships, where he finished
50th. He also represented
America at the World Track
and Field Championships in the
10,000-meter race in July 1993.
His sophomore year, Jim
merson helped lead the Cardi
nal to a sixth-place finish in the
NCAA Championships and to
second piace at the District VIII
meet. He was also the co-recipi
ent of the Block "S" outstand
ing male sophomore award with
basketball point guard Brevin
Knight.
Last year, the cross country
team won the District VIII
meet for the first time in school
history and finished fifth at the
NCAA meet, but Stanford still
took second in the Pac-10
behind Oregon.

Pac-10" this vear, Jimmerson

said. "It's kind of eluded us for
the past three years. Last year we
had a good shot at it and we could
have won it, but it just didn't
happen on that day.
"I'm still surprised sometimes
by how strong our team is," Jim
merson said. "It's the depth.
Some guys who'd be No. 1 run
ners on those teams are fighting
to be in the top seven (here). I
think we've got a pretty good shot
at it. All you can do is just try
your best."
Jimmerson has served an inte
gral role in the Cardinal's rise to
national contention in cross
country.
"In my freshman year, my goal
was just to be in the top seven
and be on the traveling team and
be able to contribute something
to the program," Jimmerson
said. "Fortunately, things have
gone really well and I've been
able to contribute.
"It's been really neat to see the
growth of the program. When I
came my freshman year, I think

we might have been ranked for
part of the season, but we
weren't really a national power
house or a national-caliber team.
It's been fun the past three years
just to be a part of that growing
and watching Stanford become
kind of a national distance-run
ning powerhouse."
Despite his tremendous natu
ral talent, Jimmerson is still
somewhat uncomfortable with
the thought of being a leader.
"I guess I try to be a leader,
just by my actions and by my ded
ication more than my words,"
Jimmerson said. "I'm not much
of a verbal leader. I don't have a
lot of motivational speeches or
anything like that for the team. I
just try to get out there and give
my best effort every time and
hopefully be a model more than
an inspirational leader.
"I've always thought that that's
a much more powerful tool than to
talk a lot. I try to kind of mold
myself that way. That can also be
kind of a hindrance to me. I'm just
not a very outgoing person, at least
not with groups. That's just the
point I've evolved to."
But Jimmerson's discomfort is

limited to his interactions off the
field. Once in a race, he does not
succumb to the anxiety created
by what other people expect of
him.
"I think I run best under a lot
of pressure," Jimmerson said.
"Pressure forces me to think
about how important it is to me.
It forces me to dig down deeper
and see what's inside of me.
"For the most part, I'm pretty
good at getting excited for the big
race. I get worried if I'm not real
ly nervous. I'd much rather be
nervous than to just go in and not
care or be like, 'Oh, it's just
another race.'
"The worst part of the race is
the morning of the race," Jim
merson said. "The race itself is
never as bad. I mean, it hurts,
but the anticipation of it is the
most stressful part of it. Physi
cally, we're prepared to go out
and run 4:50 per mile. You just
have to get mentally ready to go
out and make your body do that."
Jimmerson said he feels the
importance of his sport goes
beyond garnering team titles and
personal awards. He feels that his
teammates are what have made

his participation on the team
truly enjoyable.
"I think the thing that makes
it worth it for me is the cama
raderie of the team," Jimmerson
said. "I could go out and win
races or whatever but it wouldn't
be near as much fun without a
good bunch of guys around me.
Achieving the goal, I guess, is just
icing on the cake compared to
just working hard to get it."
Though he may be unsure of
what lies ahead of him after col
lege, Jimmerson is certain that
running will be a big part of his
immediate future.
"My only real definite plan is
that I'm going to try to keep run
ning and train for the 2000
Olympics," he said. "That's kind
of my long-term goal. Then I'll
decide from there and see if I
want to keep running.
"As far as a career goes ... I
enjoy product design, but I'm not
sure if that's where I want to
spend my energy. I just like the
creativity of [product design] a lot
more than the technical stuff of
engineering. I've always been
into art and drawing.
"When I was a little kid I

always wanted to be an artist. I
guess this is somewhat of a ful
fillment of that dream. I never
really pursued it much in high
school. I always liked to do it but
I never really practiced much
until I got here."
Jimmerson also spends his
spare time taking part in the
Christian ministry group Ath
letes in Action. His involvement
there has led him to take up
music as another hobby.
"I started playing guitar — it's
my latest little interest," he said.
"I've always been into music and
singing. I play the piano a little
bit. I'm not good enough to go
anywhere with it, but it's just
something I enjoy doing."
Jimmerson goes through his
days as any other normal stu
dent. He knows that he has spe
cial talents and responsibilities
which not everyone has, but he
does not let these things change
his personality into one with
which he is uncomfortable.
Quiet, subdued and humble
are generally not the words used
to describe an effective leader, yet
no words fit Jimmerson, who
breaks the mold, better.

Jimmerson said. "I'm not much
of a verbal leader. I don't have a
lot of motivational speeches or
anything like that for the team. I
just try to get out there and give
my best effort every time and
hopefully be a model more than
an inspirational leader.
"I've always thought that that's
a much more powerful tool than to
talk a lot. I try to kind of mold
myself that way. That can also be
kind of a hindrance to me. I'm just
not a very outgoing person, at least
not with groups. That's just the
point I've evolved to."
But Jimmerson's discomfort is

limited to his interactions off the
field. Once in a race, he does not
succumb to the anxiety created
by what other people expect of
him.
"I think I run best under a lot
of pressure," Jimmerson said.
"Pressure forces me to think
about how important it is to me.
It forces me to dig down deeper
and see what's inside of me.
"For the most part, I'm pretty
good at getting excited for the big
race. I get worried if I'm not real
ly nervous. I'd much rather be
nervous than to just go in and not
care or be like, 'Oh, it's just
another race.'
"The worst part of the race is
the morning of the race," Jim
merson said. "The race itself is
never as bad. I mean, it hurts,
but the anticipation of it is the
most stressful part of it. Physi
cally, we're prepared to go out
and run 4:50 per mile. You just
have to get mentally ready to go
out and make your body do that."
Jimmerson said he feels the
importance of his sport goes
beyond garnering team titles and
personal awards. He feels that his
teammates are what have made

his participation on the team
truly enjoyable.
"I think the thing that makes
it worth it for me is the cama
raderie of the team," Jimmerson
said. "I could go out and win
races or whatever but it wouldn't
be near as much fun without a
good bunch of guys around me.
Achieving the goal, I guess, is just
icing on the cake compared to
just working hard to get it."
Though he may be unsure of
what lies ahead of him after col
lege, Jimmerson is certain that
running will be a big part of his
immediate future.
"My only real definite plan is
that I'm going to try to keep run
ning and train for the 2000
Olympics," he said. "That's kind
of my long-term goal. Then I'll
decide from there and see if I
want to keep running.
"As far as a career goes ... I
enjoy product design, but I'm not
sure if that's where I want to
spend my energy. I just like the
creativity of [product design] a lot
more than the technical stuff of
engineering. I've always been
into art and drawing.
"When I was a little kid I

always wanted to be an artist. I
guess this is somewhat of a ful
fillment of that dream. I never
really pursued it much in high
school. I always liked to do it but
I never really practiced much
until I got here."
Jimmerson also spends his
spare time taking part in the
Christian ministry group Ath
letes in Action. His involvement
there has led him to take up
music as another hobby.
"I started playing guitar — it's
my latest little interest," he said.
"I've always been into music and
singing. I play the piano a little
bit. I'm not good enough to go
anywhere with it, but it's just
something I enjoy doing."
Jimmerson goes through his
days as any other normal stu
dent. He knows that he has spe
cial talents and responsibilities
which not everyone has, but he
does not let these things change
his personality into one with
which he is uncomfortable.
Quiet, subdued and humble
are generally not the words used
to describe an effective leader, yet
no words fit Jimmerson, who
breaks the mold, better.
Most leaders are pictured as
people who guide their follow

"I started running when I

was about 8 years old," Jim
merson said. "I used to run
with my dad. He would run like
3 or 4 miles and I'd bike with
him. After a while, I started try
ing to run with him. I'd make it
about halfway usually, but
after that, it got to where I
could keep up with him.
"I went and saw [the movie
'Running Brave' about a
Native-American runner] with
my dad one day and that got me
really pumped up about run
ning," Jimmerson said. "I
remember I came home and I
ran like 25 laps around my din
ing room because he did 25 laps
in the [10-kilometer race]."
Jimmerson's running career
flourished at Stevens High
School where he became the
state cross country champion
for three consecutive years. He
went on to take second place at
the Kinney Nationals Cross
Country Championships and
also competed in the 2-mile
races at the Keebler and Golden
West Track Invitationals. He
placed third at the Keebler
meet, where he was beaten by
future Cardinal teammate J.J.
White.
After a strong freshman year
at Stanford, when he placed
seventh in the Pacific 10 Con
ference and 11th in the District
VIII meet, he went on to com
pete in March 1993 for the
United States in the World
Junior Cross Country Champi
onships, where he finished
50th. He also represented
America at the World Track
and Field Championships in the
10,000-meter race in July 1993.
His sophomore year, Jim
merson helped lead the Cardi
nal to a sixth-place finish in the
NCAA Championships and to
second piace at the District VIII
meet. He was also the co-recipi
ent of the Block "S" outstand
ing male sophomore award with
basketball point guard Brevin
Knight.
Last year, the cross country
team won the District VIII
meet for the first time in school
history and finished fifth at the
NCAA meet, but Stanford still
took second in the Pac-10
behind Oregon.

said. "It's kind of eluded us for
the past three years. Last year we
had a good shot at it and we could
have won it, but it just didn't
happen on that day.
"I'm still surprised sometimes
by how strong our team is," Jim
merson said. "It's the depth.
Some guys who'd be No. 1 run
ners on those teams are fighting
to be in the top seven (here). I
think we've got a pretty good shot
at it. All you can do is just try
your best."
Jimmerson has served an inte
gral role in the Cardinal's rise to
national contention in cross
country.
"In my freshman year, my goal
was just to be in the top seven
and be on the traveling team and
be able to contribute something
to the program," Jimmerson
said. "Fortunately, things have
gone really well and I've been
able to contribute.
"It's been really neat to see the
growth of the program. When I
came my freshman year, I think

we might have been ranked for
part of the season, but we
weren't really a national power
house or a national-caliber team.
It's been fun the past three years
just to be a part of that growing
and watching Stanford become
kind of a national distance-run
ning powerhouse."
Despite his tremendous natu
ral talent, Jimmerson is still
somewhat uncomfortable with
the thought of being a leader.
"I guess I try to be a leader,
just by my actions and by my ded
ication more than my words,"
Jimmerson said. "I'm not much
of a verbal leader. I don't have a
lot of motivational speeches or
anything like that for the team. I
just try to get out there and give
