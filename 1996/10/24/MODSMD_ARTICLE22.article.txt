# Co-captain leads by example
## Cross country star Jimmerson breaks the mold 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
Most leaders are pictured as
people who guide their follow
ers with bold actions and inspir
ing words; trat for cross country
co-captain Greg Jimmerson,
the*best method
others is to quietly set a good
example.
Jimmerson, a senior product

design major, is in his fourth
year on the team and is perhaps
the fastest man on the squad.
He is also a three-time Ail-
American and Academic Ail-
American selection for the Car
dinal.
Jimmerson's running career
IfegoYi in" his tiYwn etown of
Grand Rapids, S.D., as a young
boy.
"I started running when I

was about 8 years old," Jim
merson said. "I used to run
with my dad. He would run like
3 or 4 miles and I'd bike with
him. After a while, I started try
ing to run with him. I'd make it
about halfway usually, but
after that, it got to where I
could keep up with him.
"I went and saw [the movie
'Running Brave' about a
Native-American runner] with
my dad one day and that got me
really pumped up about run
ning," Jimmerson said. "I
remember I came home and I
ran like 25 laps around my din
ing room because he did 25 laps
in the [10-kilometer race]."
Jimmerson's running career
flourished at Stevens High
School where he became the
state cross country champion
for three consecutive years. He
went on to take second place at
the Kinney Nationals Cross
Country Championships and
also competed in the 2-mile
races at the Keebler and Golden
West Track Invitationals. He
placed third at the Keebler
meet, where he was beaten by
future Cardinal teammate J.J.
White.
After a strong freshman year
at Stanford, when he placed
seventh in the Pacific 10 Con
ference and 11th in the District
VIII meet, he went on to com
pete in March 1993 for the
United States in the World
Junior Cross Country Champi
onships, where he finished
50th. He also represented
America at the World Track
and Field Championships in the
10,000-meter race in July 1993.
His sophomore year, Jim
merson helped lead the Cardi
nal to a sixth-place finish in the
NCAA Championships and to
second piace at the District VIII
meet. He was also the co-recipi
ent of the Block "S" outstand
ing male sophomore award with
basketball point guard Brevin
Knight.
Last year, the cross country
team won the District VIII
meet for the first time in school
history and finished fifth at the
NCAA meet, but Stanford still
took second in the Pac-10
behind Oregon.
"I'm really excited about the
Pac-10" this vear, Jimmerson
