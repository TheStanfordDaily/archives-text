## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The Stanford field hockey team, on a roll with a 10-
game winning streak, is off to the East Coast where it
will face the biggest challenges of the season so far
from three top-ranked teams in the nation.
The Cardinal flew into Washington, D C., late yes
terday afternoon and will compete in its first game
tonight against 17th-ranked James Madison.
The squad will then go on to play 13th-ranked
American (11-3, 4-1 Colonial Athletic Association) on
Sunday after a match against Ursinus College on Sat
urday.
"We've been working toward this weekend all sea
son," said coach Sheryl Johnson. "This is our week to
shine — we are ready and excited to play."
According to sophomore forward Monique Leroux,
the Card has had several good practices after its two
victories last weekend. Team members are fired up for
the trip and all three games, Leroux said.
The practice sessions focused on conditioning for
the expedition to the East, and developing offensive
and defensive strategies against the skillful teams.
Specifically, Stanford has been carefully and thor
oughly practicing the best strategies to contain Amer
ican center midfielder Stacev-Ann Siu Butt, the high
est scoring player in the nation. She has led the Eagles
to nine consecutive wins.
According to Johnson, if the point-getter is a factor
in the game, the team is now prepared to get around
her.
The Stanford squad will move sophomore forward
Sarah Medeiros back to midfield where she will pair
up with sophomore midfielder Justina Williams to
mark Siu Butt.
Usually, the squad has three forwards, midfielders
and defensive players plus the sweeper and goalie.
Moving Medeiros back will mean the Card will have

two forwards and four midfielders backed up by three
defensive players and the sweeper The team has
never executed this 2-4-4-1 formation in a game.
"We are going to go out with our own game first,"
said the Cardinal's point-getter, Leroux. "But if she's
having lots of shots on goal, we must change our strat
egy and try whatever gives us Lhe best ghance to win."
"We're hoping it won't Vtf a CRWnsfve
sophomore forward Sarah Medeiros said. According to
Medeiros. the squad's 2-4-4-1 lineup strategy is solely
meant to take the top scorer out and to prevent Amer
ican from using her. "Then we can work our offense
around her."
A quick walk-through practice this morning is all
the team members will have had to adjust to the time
difference and recover from their transcontinental
trip before facing their first opponent.
"We're playing really strong teams," Medeiros said.
"We just have to continue [our playing], not get intim
idated. I think the mental aspect is going to be a huge
factor."
The squad does not have many opportunities to
play the skilled and high-ranking teams on the East
Coast; this weekend is the Card's chance to prove its
ability and place itself among the nation's elite.
The squad does not question its skill and capability;
team members and the coach have full confidence that
Stanford will come home a winner.
"I can't see any reason why we can't beat all three
teams," Medeiros said. "We're hoping to come back
with three wins and a national ranking I see it (as)
totally attainable."
The Card has not played ranked teams this season,
but it was victorious over prestigious Providence,
which hovers just below the top-20 teams.
"We have to take each game as it comes," said
junior midfielder Paige Mader. "It's going to take our
complete concentration. I think if we play our best, we
will win."
