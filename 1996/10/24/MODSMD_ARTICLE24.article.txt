### Lindsay Amstutz 
Five members of the Stanford
women's tennis team will travel to
Southern California to compete in
the All-America Championship
beginning today.
This preseason tournament fea
tures the brightest collegiate ten
nis players in the nation. Partici
pants include those who were
named All-Americans at the end of
last season or those who are
ranked in the top 20 in the nation.
Among the representatives
from Stanford, seniors Sandra De
Silva and Katie Schlukebir and
junior Ania Bleszynski, who were
All-Americans at the end of last
season, all earned automatic
berths into the tournament.
Junior Julie Scott and freshman
Anne Kremer were also invited
"We're very excited to play our

first match," said Bleszynski. who
is seeded No. 1 in the singles com
petition. "It's a strong field, but
we're excited to play."
year we had two players,
and this year it's incredible that
we're sending five players." said
Frank Brennan. head coach of the
women's team. "Especially since
there are only 32 in the main draw,
it's unbelievable."
Stanford backs up its quantity
with quality. In the singles compe
tition, Bleszvnski is seeded No. 1,
while Schlukebir received a No. 8
seed. In addition to playing in the
singles competition, Bleszynski
and Schlukebir will participate in
the doubles tournament, in which
they are seeded No. 1.
Among the stars will be fresh
man Kremer, who received a wild
card berth based on her past suc
cess. Most impressive, the wild

card is given out to only one fresh
man in the country. With Kremer,
Scott and the three .'Mi-Americans,
Stanford looks strong.
"It's a tough draw, but we
expect to do well," De Silva said.
"It's exciting because it's the first
tournament, and it gives you a
chance to see where we stand as a
team."
De Silva also said a good finish
here plays a large role in determin
ing individual ranking for the regu
lar season. These games will also
be compiled into a player's overall
record which, in addition to a good
ranking, help determine what
tournaments players are invited to
compete in.
"This is an individual event, and
not a team event," said Brennan,
who was quick to point out that the
success of the team will be based on
many more events than just this
tournament. Nonetheless, Bren
nan is confident in his team's abili
ty to leave a good impression this
weekend.
Bleszynski and De Silva also
have another reason to look for
ward to the tournament. Both are
originally from Southern Califor
nia — Thousand Oaks and San
Marino, respectively. With the
tournament being held at the Riv
iera Country Club in Palisades,
they will enjoy somewhat of a
home-court advantage.
This weekend's event is only
one of four tournaments that make
up the collegiate grand slam. The
three other tournaments include
the National Clay Court Tourna
ment, held in Baltimore, the Rolex
Indoor Tournament and the
NCAA Championships.
After this weekend, the Cardi
nal women will take to the court
again on Nov. 7, when Stanford
hosts a regional qualifying round
of the Rolex tournament.
