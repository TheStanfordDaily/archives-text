## Setting up free-meal site for homeless goal for Spoon 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
For nine years, the Stanford Project on Nutrition
has been collecting leftover food from Stanford's cam
pus and donating it to the homeless and low-income
communities in Palo Alto and East Palo Alto.
Now the group's plans to provide an on-campus
meal for the homeless have been met with resistance
from Stanford Police and University administrators.
"We do enthusiastically support the idea of stu
dents doing good in the community," said Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais, "but the issue of bringing homeless
people onto the campus brings up so many concerns
that the idea is not worth pursuing."
Spoon started off as a small organization under the
auspices of the Haas Center for Public Service and
today boasts more than 80 volunteers. During the last
school year, members collected more than 33,000
pounds of leftover food from Stanford houses, dorms,
fraternities, eating clubs and Tresidder Union and do
nated it to the Urban Ministry of Palo Alto and the Ec
umenical Hunger Program of East Palo Alto.
Starting up a free meal for the low-income and
homeless community, either on or near Stanford's
campus, is the group's goal for this school year, said se
nior Dave Murphy, Spoon's operations manager.
The meal would be run entirely by Stanford stu
dents and would complement the meal program held
in churches in and around Palo Alto by the Urban Min
istry, which currently provides food for up to 70 people
every day except Wednesdays. The Urban Ministry ap
proached Spoon because it was unable to find a venue
for a Wednesday meal, said Murphy.
Although no formal proposal has been submitted to
the University so far, Spoon held an informal meeting
at the end of last spring quarter with Linguistics Prof.
Thomas Wasow, Dean of Memorial Church Robert
Gregg, minister Jim Burklo and Stanford Police Capt.
