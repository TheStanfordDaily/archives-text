## Setting up free-meal site for homeless goal for Spoon 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
For nine years, the Stanford Project on Nutrition
has been collecting leftover food from Stanford's cam
pus and donating it to the homeless and low-income
communities in Palo Alto and East Palo Alto.
Now the group's plans to provide an on-campus
meal for the homeless have been met with resistance
from Stanford Police and University administrators.
"We do enthusiastically support the idea of stu
dents doing good in the community," said Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais, "but the issue of bringing homeless
people onto the campus brings up so many concerns
that the idea is not worth pursuing."
Spoon started off as a small organization under the
auspices of the Haas Center for Public Service and
today boasts more than 80 volunteers. During the last
school year, members collected more than 33,000
pounds of leftover food from Stanford houses, dorms,
fraternities, eating clubs and Tresidder Union and do
nated it to the Urban Ministry of Palo Alto and the Ec
umenical Hunger Program of East Palo Alto.
Starting up a free meal for the low-income and
homeless community, either on or near Stanford's
campus, is the group's goal for this school year, said se
nior Dave Murphy, Spoon's operations manager.
The meal would be run entirely by Stanford stu
dents and would complement the meal program held
in churches in and around Palo Alto by the Urban Min
istry, which currently provides food for up to 70 people
every day except Wednesdays. The Urban Ministry ap
proached Spoon because it was unable to find a venue
for a Wednesday meal, said Murphy.
Although no formal proposal has been submitted to
the University so far, Spoon held an informal meeting
at the end of last spring quarter with Linguistics Prof.
Thomas Wasow, Dean of Memorial Church Robert
Gregg, minister Jim Burklo and Stanford Police Capt.

Marvin Moore in order to gauge
initial reactions to the proposal.
"The people we met with were
very supportive, but they had larg
er concerns," said Murphy.
According to Murphy, the first
hurdle is finding a suitable venue
where a meal could be cooked and
served and that would be easily ac
cessible by public transport.
One such venue was the Univer
sity Lutheran Church on Stanford
Avenue, just behind Escondido Vil
lage.
The Rev. Herb Schmidt said
Spoon had approached him with
the proposal. "We would be very
open to the idea," said Schmidt,
"but our kitchen facilities are just
too small. 1 wish the University
would allow the meal to take place
in student dorms or eating hous
es."
Murphy said another major
hurdle comes in challenging mis
conceptions about the homeless.
Moore was worried about the se
curity implications of Spoon's pro
posal.
"One of my concerns during
the meeting was that students are
sometimes a little naive and can be
taken advantage of," said Moore.
"They want to do a good deed
without looking at the implica
tions.
"I am not happy with the idea of
mixing the student population
with the homeless population," he

said. "There is a significant crimi
nal element among the transient
population. We can't just invite
people like this onto campus. This
is a closed campus."
University General Counsel
Michael Roster confirmed that the
Stanford campus is private prop
erty and the Board of Trustees has
the right to prevent people from
entering its premises or withdraw
an invitation at any time.
Burklo, who founded Palo
Alto's Urban Ministry, said he has
never experienced problems while
running homeless meal programs
in Palo Alto.
The programs ai e "not a contro
versial issue or neighborhood con
cern in Palo Alto, which I can as
sure you is a most vigilant neigh
borhood," he said.
According to Wais, there are
compelling reasons for Spoon's
meals to be kept off campus.
When asked if the University
would be receptive to the idea, Wais
said no.
"My office is inundated by stu
dent clubs with requests for meet
ing space," he said. "I think it
would give a confusing message if
we provided space for the homeless
instead of students."
"Stanford is not a soup kitchen
per se," said Wais. "It is an educa
tional enterpiiae, and the initiative
is not consistent with Stanford's
overall educational mission."
"It could set a precedent and
open the doors for other homeless
groups seeking space on campus
that we simply couldn't accommo
date," he said. "It would change the

environment on campus, having a
large influx of homeless folks."
Burklo pointed out, however,
that the soup kitchens he has run
in Palo Alto have offered profound
ly educational experiences for all
students involved.
"The University holds nonedu
cational feeding events all the
time," said Burklo, citing events
for alumni and fund-raisers.
"There's nothing educational
about that."
Security and liability are also
important concerns, Wais said.
"If homeless folks were to get
onto campus, they might get com
fortable here," he said. "We have a
very open campus, but we would
not like to have a large number of
homeless people taking up longer
tenure here. We're certainly not
prepared to provide homes for the
homeless."
If something were to happen to
them or the people brought into
contact with them, Wais said, the
University would potentially be li
able.
"Spoon's goals could be
achieved equally well by providing
a meal for the homeless off cam
pus," Wais maintained.
In the light of conversations
with Wais and others, Murphy said
Spoon will be forced to seek an off
campus venue in order to get the
program started by the end of this
school year.
"It's not to say that we wouldn't
want to pursue our original idea in
the future because it would be most
valuable to hold the meal on cam
pus," Murphy said.

trition, which donates it to local low-income communities.
Marvin Moore in order to gauge
initial reactions to the proposal.
"The people we met with were
very supportive, but they had larg
er concerns," said Murphy.
According to Murphy, the first
hurdle is finding a suitable venue
where a meal could be cooked and
served and that would be easily ac
cessible by public transport.
One such venue was the Univer
sity Lutheran Church on Stanford
Avenue, just behind Escondido Vil
lage.
The Rev. Herb Schmidt said
Spoon had approached him with
the proposal. "We would be very
open to the idea," said Schmidt,
"but our kitchen facilities are just
too small. 1 wish the University
would allow the meal to take place
in student dorms or eating hous
es."
Murphy said another major
hurdle comes in challenging mis
conceptions about the homeless.
Moore was worried about the se
curity implications of Spoon's pro
posal.
"One of my concerns during
the meeting was that students are
sometimes a little naive and can be
taken advantage of," said Moore.
"They want to do a good deed
without looking at the implica
tions.
"I am not happy with the idea of
mixing the student population
with the homeless population," he

said. "There is a significant crimi
nal element among the transient
population. We can't just invite
people like this onto campus. This
is a closed campus."
University General Counsel
Michael Roster confirmed that the
Stanford campus is private prop
erty and the Board of Trustees has
the right to prevent people from
entering its premises or withdraw
an invitation at any time.
Burklo, who founded Palo
Alto's Urban Ministry, said he has
never experienced problems while
running homeless meal programs
in Palo Alto.
The programs ai e "not a contro
versial issue or neighborhood con
cern in Palo Alto, which I can as
sure you is a most vigilant neigh
borhood," he said.
According to Wais, there are
compelling reasons for Spoon's
meals to be kept off campus.
When asked if the University
would be receptive to the idea, Wais
said no.
"My office is inundated by stu
dent clubs with requests for meet
ing space," he said. "I think it
would give a confusing message if
we provided space for the homeless
instead of students."
"Stanford is not a soup kitchen
per se," said Wais. "It is an educa
tional enterpiiae, and the initiative
is not consistent with Stanford's
overall educational mission."
"It could set a precedent and
open the doors for other homeless
groups seeking space on campus
that we simply couldn't accommo
date," he said. "It would change the

environment on campus, having a
large influx of homeless folks."
Burklo pointed out, however,
that the soup kitchens he has run
in Palo Alto have offered profound
ly educational experiences for all
students involved.
"The University holds nonedu
cational feeding events all the
time," said Burklo, citing events
for alumni and fund-raisers.
"There's nothing educational
about that."
Security and liability are also
important concerns, Wais said.
"If homeless folks were to get
onto campus, they might get com
fortable here," he said. "We have a
very open campus, but we would
not like to have a large number of
homeless people taking up longer
tenure here. We're certainly not
prepared to provide homes for the
homeless."
If something were to happen to
them or the people brought into
contact with them, Wais said, the
University would potentially be li
able.
"Spoon's goals could be
achieved equally well by providing
a meal for the homeless off cam
pus," Wais maintained.
In the light of conversations
with Wais and others, Murphy said
Spoon will be forced to seek an off
campus venue in order to get the
program started by the end of this
school year.
"It's not to say that we wouldn't
want to pursue our original idea in
the future because it would be most
valuable to hold the meal on cam
pus," Murphy said.
