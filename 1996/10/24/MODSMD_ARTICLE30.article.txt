## THEATER Talking hands 
### 
Stanford Lively Arts, after
delighting our theatrical
senses with "Tommy" last
week, brings to campus
another show likely to thrill,
"Curiouser and Curiouser."
But if "Tommy" enchanted
on the basis of its loud rock
opera score, "Curiouser
and Curiouser" should en
gage audiences in a differ
ent way. The National The
ater of the Deaf relies on
sign language and visual
speech to give hearing-im
paired audiences a chance
to enjoy live theater. The re
sults are often gorgeous,
and Saturday's show
should be no exception.
Catch it at 8 p.m. in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium. "Curi
ouser" offers a glimpse at
the life and works of Lewis
Carroll. Young Alice (Cone
Johnson) and her sister (Hi
lary Scarl) go through the
looking-class into Won
derland, and wonderful
things start to happen
