# Dorks, Hippies and Rock'n' Roll
## For the editor of BAM, the focus has always been the music 
### Jen Graves 
During the summer of love in the '60s,
Dennis Erokan was a dorky 15-year-old,
looking for a connection to the elusive world
of rock music. Thirty years later, his Bay Area
Music magazine (better known as BAM) and
the concomitant bash / awards ceremony, the
Bammies, celebrate their 20th anniversary.
"1 was watching all this incredible stuff
going on in San Francisco," said Erokan of his
days at Lynbrook High School in San Jose.
"We would come up to the corner of Haight
and Ashbury and try to look cool, hoping no
body would notice we were 15. 1 was day
dreaming about getting involved, probably
like a kid at Lynbrook High School is right
now."
After he graduated from high school,
Erokan did get involved. He played bass in a
band called Green Catherine. While his
friends were either in the army or in college,
his band toured the United State. Upon his
return to the Bay Area in 1975, Erokan need
ed a job.
Instead of a job, though, he found himself
with an idea.
"As a fan," he wondered, "how do you let
musicians know how important they are to
us?"
The answer: a magazine dedicated to pub
licizing as many Bay Area musicians as possi
ble.
Looking for advice, Erokan discovered
that the average magazine's start-up costs
were $2 million."I didn't have a penny, didn't
even have a bank account. I didn't even have
$1, let alone $2 million."
Erokan was not easily discouraged. As a
man who describes himself as "one of those
half-full type of people," he investigated the
use of that $2 million capital and found a cre
ative path around it.
Since most of the start-up money would
have been spent on expertise and advertising
for circulation, Erokan used himself and his
friends as writers and put the magazine on
the racks. There was only one catch — the
magazine was free. (BAM remains free to this
day, funded by advertisers instead of sub
scriptions.) Who, he thought, wouldn't pick
up a free magazine? He was right.
"People in the magazine business were
mad," he confessed. "They didn't want any
one doing things differently." But they turned
around.
"In '76, Rolling Stone did a feature on me.
Everybody read us. We were the coolest thing
around!"
BAM's popularity died down after that
year, according to Erokan. But its core read
ership remained, and the magazine has sur
vived the ages, from classic to punk to alter
na-rock and jazz.
Although most of BAM's circulation is in
and around California, the biweekly magazine
now has subscribers in Japan and has developed

its own Web
page. Erokan
also owns the
Seattle music
magazine, The
Rocket, which he
describes as
"more punky"
than BAM, and
the Micro Times,
a local computer
publication.
To complete
his BAM brain
child, Erokan
wanted to host a
huge annual
awards show

and party to celebrate all the Bay Area bands.
Now known as the Bammies, it began as a
farce.
"We were doing it as a joke because the
Grammys are so self-important and boring,"
he said. "But the musicians really cared — be
cause the fans were voting, not the record in
dustry."
Using the democratic approach, the
awards are presented every March. Musicians
are chosen in various categories according to
a number of readers' polls that appear in
BAM. Recently, bands like Green Day and the
Counting Crows have been at the podium.
Sammy Hagar and Jefferson Starship graced
the Bammies' first victory stand, and a 20-
something Bonnie Raitt was the presenter.
Erokan did not expect the success he has
achieved. "This year," he said of the Bammies,
"marks the 20th anniversary of a party that
was only supposed to happen once."
Aside from the fantastic quality of the Bay

Area music scene, Erokan attributes his sue
cess to the magazine's fair and honest treat
ment of rockers.
"At the time 1 started the magazine, every
one thought Bay Area music was declining,"
he said. "But 1 had been touring; I didn't
know. I just treated them with respect."
Late-'7os Bay Area bands like Jefferson
Starship and Steve Miller were starting to put
out huge albums.
"Whatever kind of music it was, we had the
best," he said. "Except during the punk era.
1..A. and New York had better punks than we
did."
Despite the "quality" of Bay Area punks,
Los Angeles punk pioneers The Knack gave
their first and only interview in 1982, the year
their breaking album came out, to BAM.
According to Erokan, the BAM office has
seen its share of crazy unknowns who go bar
reling into stardom. Long before Motley Crue
was a household name, Nikki Sixx barged into
Erokan's office and told him he wanted to be a
big star. Months later, a shirtless and un
known Axl Rose stopped by to put in an ad.
Erokan's dealings with musicians have not
always been smooth.
A nervous, new journalist, Erokan was in
terviewing a small punk band. When he en
tered the room, he walked up to the lead
singer and introduced himself. The lead
singer promptly put his pointer finger up his
nose — and left it there, without saying a
word to Erokan. Luckily, Erokan's sense of
humor saved him.
"My tape recorder, my notebook, my pen,
it all fell on the floor," he said. "Yup, I dropped
everything and we had a good laugh."
Erokan's own taste in music is all-encom
passing. 1 like almost every kind of music, and

I'm so surprised when other people don't," he
said. "I went to an 'old folks' band when I was
young and looked like a fool, just because I
wanted to hear the music."
He didn't, however, go to Altamont, the
West Coast version of Woodstock. Seemingly
immune to the sway of trends, Erokan said he
is actually glad he missed the hippie era.
"When you catch the end of an era, you can
really see it," mused Erokan. "They were ex
perimenting with everything, and there was
really nothing left to hold on to."
For Erokan, the movements outside the
music have never been important. "It would
always be the music," he said. "If anything else
was happening, it was never that interesting
to me. M
Likewise, he said, BAM runs negative
music reviews only if they are critical of the
music itself. "In terms of famous bands, we've
made as many enemies as friends," he said.
"But I don't like gratuitous slaps at musicians,
you know, their politics or the way they dress.
To me, it's music."
Erokan's easygoing, down-to-earth de
meanor mirrors the nature of the music scene
he works in."The Bay Area feels like a small
town," he said. "If you're in New York or L.A.,
the industry's all around you. You don't meet
anyone else. Here, you're seeing real life all
around you. Bay Area musicians in general
tend to be nice — you know, OK people to
hang out with."
The jolly, friendly 46-year-old looks the
part of an alert, more mainstream lerrv Gar
cia. Erokan is happily married and lives in
Danville with his wife and four kids. He is
content with his life and fully satisfied. "I've
gotten what I wanted," he said and smiled. "To
be a part of it."

"Squeeze the Dog:" The somewhat inebriated-looking band that went home with BAM's 20th anniversary Block Party Award for
Best South Bay Band.
During the summer of love in the '60s,
Dennis Erokan was a dorky 15-year-old,
looking for a connection to the elusive world
of rock music. Thirty years later, his Bay Area
Music magazine (better known as BAM) and
the concomitant bash / awards ceremony, the
Bammies, celebrate their 20th anniversary.
"1 was watching all this incredible stuff
going on in San Francisco," said Erokan of his
days at Lynbrook High School in San Jose.
"We would come up to the corner of Haight
and Ashbury and try to look cool, hoping no
body would notice we were 15. 1 was day
dreaming about getting involved, probably
like a kid at Lynbrook High School is right
now."
After he graduated from high school,
Erokan did get involved. He played bass in a
band called Green Catherine. While his
friends were either in the army or in college,
his band toured the United State. Upon his
return to the Bay Area in 1975, Erokan need
ed a job.
Instead of a job, though, he found himself
with an idea.
"As a fan," he wondered, "how do you let
musicians know how important they are to
us?"
The answer: a magazine dedicated to pub
licizing as many Bay Area musicians as possi
ble.
Looking for advice, Erokan discovered
that the average magazine's start-up costs
were $2 million."I didn't have a penny, didn't
even have a bank account. I didn't even have
$1, let alone $2 million."
Erokan was not easily discouraged. As a
man who describes himself as "one of those
half-full type of people," he investigated the
use of that $2 million capital and found a cre
ative path around it.
Since most of the start-up money would
have been spent on expertise and advertising
for circulation, Erokan used himself and his
friends as writers and put the magazine on
the racks. There was only one catch — the
magazine was free. (BAM remains free to this
day, funded by advertisers instead of sub
scriptions.) Who, he thought, wouldn't pick
up a free magazine? He was right.
"People in the magazine business were
mad," he confessed. "They didn't want any
one doing things differently." But they turned
around.
"In '76, Rolling Stone did a feature on me.
Everybody read us. We were the coolest thing
around!"
BAM's popularity died down after that
year, according to Erokan. But its core read
ership remained, and the magazine has sur
vived the ages, from classic to punk to alter
na-rock and jazz.
Although most of BAM's circulation is in
and around California, the biweekly magazine
now has subscribers in Japan and has developed

its own Web
page. Erokan
also owns the
Seattle music
magazine, The
Rocket, which he
describes as
"more punky"
than BAM, and
the Micro Times,
a local computer
publication.
To complete
his BAM brain
child, Erokan
wanted to host a
huge annual
awards show

and party to celebrate all the Bay Area bands.
Now known as the Bammies, it began as a
farce.
"We were doing it as a joke because the
Grammys are so self-important and boring,"
he said. "But the musicians really cared — be
cause the fans were voting, not the record in
dustry."
Using the democratic approach, the
awards are presented every March. Musicians
are chosen in various categories according to
a number of readers' polls that appear in
BAM. Recently, bands like Green Day and the
Counting Crows have been at the podium.
Sammy Hagar and Jefferson Starship graced
the Bammies' first victory stand, and a 20-
something Bonnie Raitt was the presenter.
Erokan did not expect the success he has
achieved. "This year," he said of the Bammies,
"marks the 20th anniversary of a party that
was only supposed to happen once."
Aside from the fantastic quality of the Bay

Area music scene, Erokan attributes his sue
cess to the magazine's fair and honest treat
ment of rockers.
"At the time 1 started the magazine, every
one thought Bay Area music was declining,"
he said. "But 1 had been touring; I didn't
know. I just treated them with respect."
Late-'7os Bay Area bands like Jefferson
Starship and Steve Miller were starting to put
out huge albums.
"Whatever kind of music it was, we had the
best," he said. "Except during the punk era.
1..A. and New York had better punks than we
did."
Despite the "quality" of Bay Area punks,
Los Angeles punk pioneers The Knack gave
their first and only interview in 1982, the year
their breaking album came out, to BAM.
According to Erokan, the BAM office has
seen its share of crazy unknowns who go bar
reling into stardom. Long before Motley Crue
was a household name, Nikki Sixx barged into
Erokan's office and told him he wanted to be a
big star. Months later, a shirtless and un
known Axl Rose stopped by to put in an ad.
Erokan's dealings with musicians have not
always been smooth.
A nervous, new journalist, Erokan was in
terviewing a small punk band. When he en
tered the room, he walked up to the lead
singer and introduced himself. The lead
singer promptly put his pointer finger up his
nose — and left it there, without saying a
word to Erokan. Luckily, Erokan's sense of
humor saved him.
"My tape recorder, my notebook, my pen,
it all fell on the floor," he said. "Yup, I dropped
everything and we had a good laugh."
Erokan's own taste in music is all-encom
passing. 1 like almost every kind of music, and

I'm so surprised when other people don't," he
said. "I went to an 'old folks' band when I was
young and looked like a fool, just because I
wanted to hear the music."
He didn't, however, go to Altamont, the
West Coast version of Woodstock. Seemingly
immune to the sway of trends, Erokan said he
is actually glad he missed the hippie era.
"When you catch the end of an era, you can
really see it," mused Erokan. "They were ex
perimenting with everything, and there was
really nothing left to hold on to."
For Erokan, the movements outside the
music have never been important. "It would
always be the music," he said. "If anything else
was happening, it was never that interesting
to me. M
Likewise, he said, BAM runs negative
music reviews only if they are critical of the
music itself. "In terms of famous bands, we've
made as many enemies as friends," he said.
"But I don't like gratuitous slaps at musicians,
you know, their politics or the way they dress.
To me, it's music."
Erokan's easygoing, down-to-earth de
meanor mirrors the nature of the music scene
he works in."The Bay Area feels like a small
town," he said. "If you're in New York or L.A.,
the industry's all around you. You don't meet
anyone else. Here, you're seeing real life all
around you. Bay Area musicians in general
tend to be nice — you know, OK people to
hang out with."
The jolly, friendly 46-year-old looks the
part of an alert, more mainstream lerrv Gar
cia. Erokan is happily married and lives in
Danville with his wife and four kids. He is
content with his life and fully satisfied. "I've
gotten what I wanted," he said and smiled. "To
be a part of it."
