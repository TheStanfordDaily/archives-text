Ah, to suck the blood of man.
The image of woman as vampire, argues
Bram Dijkstra in "Evil Sisters: The Threat of
Female Sexuality and the Cult of Manhood,"
(Knopf, $30) was the jumping off point for the
demon izing of women that became imbedded
in pseudo-scientific, political and social theo
ries at the beginning of the 2()th century.

BOOK REVIEW

Dijkstra goes on to assert that the monster
making of women as sexual predators directly
ties into the major racial prejudices of this cen
tury that ultimately led to such atrocities as
Hitler's organized genocide during World War
11. Using markers of popular culture, includ
ing silent films and the work of writers as di
vergent as Ernest Hemingway and E. T. A.
Hoffman, Dijkstra traces the chronology of
images and beliefs that he says intensified the
gender clash in this century.
I )i jkstra begins with an examination of the
silent film "A Fool There Was,"in which the
kohl-eyed, dark-haired star Theda Bara
(whose name, Dijkstra points out, was be
lieved to be an anagram of "Arab Death") lures
men to their moral and financial demise. This
example is the first of an abundance of filmic
and literary images delineating the sexual
woman as a "primitive, masculinized" being
who had to be domesticated and tamed if she
would not wreak havoc on the world.
After describing the pivotal scene in "A Fool
There Was,"in which Bara, called "the Vam
pire," bestows a purely sexual kiss on her prin
cipal victim, Dijkstra asserts that "clearly there
continues to be a direct connection between
the lurid, bestial intensity of that single kiss
and our own lingering suspicions about the
function of human sexuality in a civilized en
vironment. ... It showed vividly that to get in
volved with a sexual woman was equivalent to
death itself." Dijkstra later discusses the
French notion of sexual intercourse as "un
petit mort," particularly in terms of vampiris
tic bloodletting, or, more accurately in this
context, semen draining.
As one of the first in a long line of silent film
arguments, however, this one seems a little
weak when Dijkstra admits that even film his
torians are relatively unfamiliar with the work.
Not only that, but Dijkstra himself seems to
become mired in the melodramatic
metaphors of this kind of cinema, and it unfa
vorably affects his prose.
In speaking of the film's male protagonist, a
pillar of the community who falls prey to the
female vampire, Dijkstra says that to save his
marriage, "He should have thrust the stake of
manhood into the Vampire's breast instead of
abandoning himself to the dark ocean of her
eyes!" Even if the author is being facetious, this
kind of writing, in which he engages frequent
ly, grates.
Another early-century pattern of thought

Dijkstra lays out for his readers is the theory
that female sexual predators, in depriving men
of their semen, were actually depleting men's
mental powers and eventually causing the loss
of their financial means. According to early
"medical" theories, apparently, the male
human brain was actually believed to be com
posed of semen, so that "each seminal emis
sion quite literally caused one to spend one's
genetic endowment."
Dijkstra goes on to say that "the teen-ager,
or 'young adult,' today who still, in describing
a sexual encounter, brags of having 'screwed
his, her or the other's brains out' surely does
not have a clue that this expression had its jus

tification in the most serious researches of
early 20th-century medical science."
Women's robbing of men's sexual, mental
and financial powers was surely a force that
had to be stopped, at least in the minds of
many early 20th-century thinkers. Dijkstra
employs the term "vagina dentata" to evoke
the female persona of'the devouring maw of
reproductive nature" who was depicted "in a
wide variety of apposite juxtapositions that
were to become a standard feature of 20th
century pop-culture iconography." This pre
tentiousness — also exemplified by terms
like "spermatophore" — permeates the
book. In addition, many of Dijkstra's close

readings of contemporary writing and .irt
seem forced.
In his examination of the psychoanalyst
Sigmund Freud's famous case study of the fe
male hysteric, however, Dijkstra is fresh and
often devastatingly funny. Asserting that
Freud was actually suppressing his own desire
for his patient, an apparently attractive IK
year-old named Dora, Dijkstra depicts Freud's
justification of Dora's self-initiated termina
tion of therapy as the feelings of a "jilted
lover": "Was there anyone with a more capa
cious spermatophoric cranium [than Freud]?
Clearly it pleased Freud's ego mightily to have
come to the realization that Dora must have
been driven to distraction by thought of the
size of his own cigar."
By the time he gets to Hitler, though, Dijk
stra has calmed down into a sinister serious
ness. In picking apart "Mein Kampf," Hitler's
manifesto on the path to Aryan purification,
Dijkstra finds a relationship between the vil
lainizing of the Jew and the fear of the female
predator. In fact, according to Dijkstra's inter
pretation of Hitler's writing, it is the "effemi
nizing" of the Aryan race that was most to be
feared and conquered.
Dijkstra writes, "Hitler deliberately fused
the prevalent image of the fiendish, 'gold-con
suming' Jewish erotomane with that of the
semen-consuming, darkly erotic sexual
woman who depicted her man's bank account.
He used the cultural mechanisms o!
metaphoric gynecide to foment a mentality ot
genocide against a single alien 'bacillus' ot de
generation eating its way into the Aryan bod\
politic."
Fven here Dijkstra cannot resist a small jab
at "The Fiihrer"; he says that Hitler's encour
agement of men to develop "bodies hard as
steel" was a "suppressed homoerotic longing
for a 'truly masculine' beauty he himsell
patently did not possess.... He expressed lus
hope that the young Aryan male would learn
to shed his clothes more often in public."
Dijkstra concludes on a propagandistic
note of his own by saying that people "can es
cape from the fetishized gender imagery that
surrounds us only by refusing to accept the
mass media's lure of 'evil sister' stereotyp
ing. .. to remain complicit in the fetishization
of others as 'evil,' as 'alien,' and as 'inferior' | is]
to see difference as a disease."
While it is clear the author's message has
the best interests of humanity in mind, the
whole of his book, which was 10 years in the
making, seems to create a trajectory of other
writers' arguments linked by a sometimes
weak causality rather than a strong, consistent
argument on I >ijkstra's part. The 15-page bib
liography makes it seem as if those 10 years
were spent mainly on the accumulation of ma
terial, not on the formation of a new theory.
1 >ijkstra's book reads rather like a history of
much of the seminal thinking of this century,
and it is interesting in this respect; but it does
not make an impression as a shocking new
thesis on the evolution of human prejudices.

posed of semen, so that "each seminal emis
sion quite literally caused one to spend one's
genetic endowment."
Dijkstra goes on to say that "the teen-ager,
or 'young adult,' today who still, in describing
a sexual encounter, brags of having 'screwed
his, her or the other's brains out' surely does
not have a clue that this expression had its jus

tification in the most serious researches of
early 20th-century medical science."
Women's robbing of men's sexual, mental
and financial powers was surely a force that
had to be stopped, at least in the minds of
many early 20th-century thinkers. Dijkstra
employs the term "vagina dentata" to evoke
the female persona of'the devouring maw of
reproductive nature" who was depicted "in a
wide variety of apposite juxtapositions that
were to become a standard feature of 20th
century pop-culture iconography." This pre
tentiousness — also exemplified by terms
like "spermatophore" — permeates the
book. In addition, many of Dijkstra's close

readings of contemporary writing and .irt
seem forced.
In his examination of the psychoanalyst
Sigmund Freud's famous case study of the fe
male hysteric, however, Dijkstra is fresh and
often devastatingly funny. Asserting that
Freud was actually suppressing his own desire
for his patient, an apparently attractive IK
year-old named Dora, Dijkstra depicts Freud's
justification of Dora's self-initiated termina
tion of therapy as the feelings of a "jilted
lover": "Was there anyone with a more capa
cious spermatophoric cranium [than Freud]?
Clearly it pleased Freud's ego mightily to have
come to the realization that Dora must have
been driven to distraction by thought of the
size of his own cigar."
By the time he gets to Hitler, though, Dijk
stra has calmed down into a sinister serious
ness. In picking apart "Mein Kampf," Hitler's
manifesto on the path to Aryan purification,
Dijkstra finds a relationship between the vil
lainizing of the Jew and the fear of the female
predator. In fact, according to Dijkstra's inter
pretation of Hitler's writing, it is the "effemi
nizing" of the Aryan race that was most to be
feared and conquered.
Dijkstra writes, "Hitler deliberately fused
the prevalent image of the fiendish, 'gold-con
suming' Jewish erotomane with that of the
semen-consuming, darkly erotic sexual
woman who depicted her man's bank account.
He used the cultural mechanisms o!
metaphoric gynecide to foment a mentality ot
genocide against a single alien 'bacillus' ot de
generation eating its way into the Aryan bod\
politic."
Fven here Dijkstra cannot resist a small jab
at "The Fiihrer"; he says that Hitler's encour
agement of men to develop "bodies hard as
steel" was a "suppressed homoerotic longing
for a 'truly masculine' beauty he himsell
patently did not possess.... He expressed lus
hope that the young Aryan male would learn
to shed his clothes more often in public."
Dijkstra concludes on a propagandistic
note of his own by saying that people "can es
cape from the fetishized gender imagery that
surrounds us only by refusing to accept the
mass media's lure of 'evil sister' stereotyp
ing. .. to remain complicit in the fetishization
of others as 'evil,' as 'alien,' and as 'inferior' | is]
to see difference as a disease."
While it is clear the author's message has
the best interests of humanity in mind, the
whole of his book, which was 10 years in the
making, seems to create a trajectory of other
writers' arguments linked by a sometimes
weak causality rather than a strong, consistent
argument on I >ijkstra's part. The 15-page bib
liography makes it seem as if those 10 years
were spent mainly on the accumulation of ma
terial, not on the formation of a new theory.
1 >ijkstra's book reads rather like a history of
much of the seminal thinking of this century,
and it is interesting in this respect; but it does
not make an impression as a shocking new
thesis on the evolution of human prejudices.
Ah, to suck the blood of man.
The image of woman as vampire, argues
Bram Dijkstra in "Evil Sisters: The Threat of
Female Sexuality and the Cult of Manhood,"
(Knopf, $30) was the jumping off point for the
demon izing of women that became imbedded
in pseudo-scientific, political and social theo
ries at the beginning of the 2()th century.

BOOK REVIEW

Dijkstra goes on to assert that the monster
making of women as sexual predators directly
ties into the major racial prejudices of this cen
tury that ultimately led to such atrocities as
Hitler's organized genocide during World War
11. Using markers of popular culture, includ
ing silent films and the work of writers as di
vergent as Ernest Hemingway and E. T. A.
Hoffman, Dijkstra traces the chronology of
images and beliefs that he says intensified the
gender clash in this century.
I )i jkstra begins with an examination of the
silent film "A Fool There Was,"in which the
kohl-eyed, dark-haired star Theda Bara
(whose name, Dijkstra points out, was be
lieved to be an anagram of "Arab Death") lures
men to their moral and financial demise. This
example is the first of an abundance of filmic
and literary images delineating the sexual
woman as a "primitive, masculinized" being
who had to be domesticated and tamed if she
would not wreak havoc on the world.
After describing the pivotal scene in "A Fool
There Was,"in which Bara, called "the Vam
pire," bestows a purely sexual kiss on her prin
cipal victim, Dijkstra asserts that "clearly there
continues to be a direct connection between
the lurid, bestial intensity of that single kiss
and our own lingering suspicions about the
function of human sexuality in a civilized en
vironment. ... It showed vividly that to get in
volved with a sexual woman was equivalent to
death itself." Dijkstra later discusses the
French notion of sexual intercourse as "un
petit mort," particularly in terms of vampiris
tic bloodletting, or, more accurately in this
context, semen draining.
As one of the first in a long line of silent film
arguments, however, this one seems a little
weak when Dijkstra admits that even film his
torians are relatively unfamiliar with the work.
Not only that, but Dijkstra himself seems to
become mired in the melodramatic
metaphors of this kind of cinema, and it unfa
vorably affects his prose.
In speaking of the film's male protagonist, a
pillar of the community who falls prey to the
female vampire, Dijkstra says that to save his
marriage, "He should have thrust the stake of
manhood into the Vampire's breast instead of
abandoning himself to the dark ocean of her
eyes!" Even if the author is being facetious, this
kind of writing, in which he engages frequent
ly, grates.
Another early-century pattern of thought

Dijkstra lays out for his readers is the theory
that female sexual predators, in depriving men
of their semen, were actually depleting men's
mental powers and eventually causing the loss
of their financial means. According to early
"medical" theories, apparently, the male
human brain was actually believed to be com
posed of semen, so that "each seminal emis
sion quite literally caused one to spend one's
genetic endowment."
Dijkstra goes on to say that "the teen-ager,
or 'young adult,' today who still, in describing
a sexual encounter, brags of having 'screwed
his, her or the other's brains out' surely does
not have a clue that this expression had its jus

tification in the most serious researches of
