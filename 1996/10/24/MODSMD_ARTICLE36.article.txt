## A
						Guide to the Good Jazz Take a Personal Tour Through the San Francisco Jazz Festival 
### Seeta Gangadharan 
From the tradition of cutting con
tests between individuals trying out
a "new sound" to the subversion of
musical genres by a "new school" of
musicians to a listening public seek
ing "new lifestyles" through the
medium of music, jazz is beholden
to the concepts of invention and im
provisation.
New means jazz, jazz means new
and whether or not this results in the
creation of good or bad music, all
discussion of jazz seems obsessed
with the idea of the new.
As the San Francisco laz.z Festival
kicks off its two-week music extrava
ganza, writers and thinkers reflect
upon the unique nature of jazz in the
Bay Area. The figures for numbers of
jazz radio stations, the quality of
local music education programs, the
market size of jazz consumers, the
demographics of j.i// club-goers and
the strategies of jazz promoters are
unveiled and used as "evidence" to
prove that this place is happening
and new.
In an attempt to sort through the
barrage of opinion on the Bay Area
scene, I spoke with two artists who
will be performing at the SI Jazz Fes
tival in the coming week. The first
was Dave Fllis, a tenor saxophonist
whose solo career was preceded by
his collaboration with the popular
San Francisco Charlie Hunter Trio.
The second was Roy Nathanson, also
a tenor, from the downtown New
York experimentalists, the Jazz Pas
sengers.
Together, they shared their appre
hensions of "new scenes." More im
portantly, they helped bring into
focus what seems more exciting and
relevant to the discussion of jazz: the
pleasure of sound.
I lere is some of their advice:
How to appreciate jazz, (or what I
learned from Dave Fllis and Roy
Nathanson):
• Imagine yourself having a con
versation with the artist.
Before I spoke with Fllis, I asked if
he would evaluate and criticize my
performance as an interviewer and
bag on any of the questions I had
asked. The question of "What's it like

to perform in Europe?" got a thumbs
down because of the lame obvious
ness of the answer ("The difference
is Europeans have a greater appreci
ation")
However, he went on to describe
the level of appreciation for jazz he
senses in the Bay Area. "That's the
reason why San Ft ancisco is for some
reason odd. You care about what's
going on. It's not that San Francisco
is special and different. It's that peo
ple are paying attention."
Describing the rehearsals and
performances of the Jazz Passengers
and Debbie Harry, Nathanson artic
ulated his desire for a music that is
beautiful, extreme and funny. The
album on which the Passengers are
working, Nathanson said, attempts
to bring the listener into the fold of
the artists' world and create a lan
guage evocative of this beauty, ex
tremity and funniness.
Appreciation of attention and the
creation of a language by musicians
would imply that artists respond and
believe in their audiences. Jazz,
therefore, is not nearly as academic
or obscure as many people believe.
• Don't forget to listen to the
music when you're not at a jazz per
formance.
By sheer coincidence, I happened
to watch a short animation Film for
which Nathanson had written the
music. "Joy Street," made in 1994 by
animation Harvard Prof. Susan Pitt,
is a movie about a despondent and
suicidal woman and the mouse or
nament on her ashtray which brings
cheer into her life.
Having no dialogue, "Joy Street"
relies only on visual art and music
accompaniment to move the story
along from depressive tones to re
freshing mirth. Standing by the win
dow, smoking long and constant
drags from a cigarette, pouring a
glass of strong liquor, dialing the
phone and having the call go unan
swered, and finally retreating to her
room, the unhappy woman contem
plates her life to hypnotic and haunt
ing sax melodies which repeat them
selves with each scene change.
When she has gone, the mouse on
top of the ashtray magically comes to
lite, testing out his squishy-sounding
weak legs, climbing up a book shelf

and dancing to the radio ("What a Wonder
ful World"). After he exhausts himself, he
appears to realize his mission: to check out
the sad one in her room.
Without becoming yet another market
ing statistic, 1 found "Joy Street" to be an in
credibly moving and provocative instance of
music and art. And I didn't have to dress up
and leave the house to take advantage of it.
• Try not to think too deeply when in
volved in musical contemplation.
I relayed to Ellis the message which the
instructor of the history of jazz at Stanford,
Grover Sales, had written last winter about
the emancipatory powers of jazz.
Sales had argued that if China were to
become a democratic nation, it would ap
pear in the form of a jazz revolution. While
Ellis understood the nature of my question
— e.g. what are the political and social
ramifications of liberated melody, tone,
tempo? — he dismissed Sales' assertion,
adding that, despite historical necessity
which brings jazz into a political arena (like
Louis Armstrong dealing with racism), "I
don't see jazz as playing that kind of role."
lazz certainly has its profound historical
moments. However, the idea of listening to
Ellis play a number at the jazz festival and si
multaneously arriving at certain conclu
sions about the political consequences of
jazz in China seems rather ridiculous. While
it may be hypothetical!)' possible tor this
epiphany to happen, a hypercritical fascina
tion with the political import of jazz will sti
fle listening capacity as it may likely provoke
a member of the audience to space out en
tirely, record a thought or divulge an idea to
a neighboring concert-goer.
• Attend live performances when the op
portunity presents itself.
While this is obvious but not always
heeded advice, the habit of going to live
shows can lead to insightful familiarity with
musical foundations of an artist. In the early
'70s, Nathanson dropped out of Columbia
University and moved out West to join
Major Chung's Amazing Circus in Berkeley.
During the '80s, Ellis could be found on the
Stanford campus, jamming Monday nights
at the Stanford Coffee House.
Catching an artist in his formative years,
or at any point in his career, may prove more
than just a social event — it could cultivate a
musical memory, especially if it involves
such weird, interesting locations like the cir
cus or the Coffee House.
After all, that's when and where jazz of
fers the most pleasure.

This week marks the opening of the 14th annual San Francis
co Jazz Festival. Running from yesterday to Nov. 3, the festi
val will feature an impressive array of jazz musicians and
jazz genres — beginning with Sonny Rollins Quintet and ending

with B-3 organ summit with Jack Mac Duff, Shirley Scott and

Duke Jethro. Here is a rundown of the performances

with occasional commentary or historical info.

Tonight, the George Shearing Quin
tet will play at the Masonic Auditori-

um. The Diana Krall Trio will
open at 8 p.m.

Shearing has three claims to

fame: 1) distinct synthesis with the guitar and vibes, 2) composi-

tion of "Lullaby ofßirdland" and 3) adoration of and mention by
Jack Kerouac in "On the Road."
Also, tonight at 8:30 p.m., a concert titled "Asian Concepts in
Jazz" will take place at the Herbst Theater.
Zakir Hussain, whose mastery of the tabla can induce halluci
natory or trance-like effects, has played with sitarist Ravi Shankar,
the Grateful Dead's Mickey Hart and guitarist John McLaughlin.
He will join Mark Izu (piano), Francis Wong (tenor) and Miya
Masoaka (koto), three prominent Bay Area artists who carried oft
last May's Asian-American Jazz Festival.
Tomorrow, the Jazz Passengers with Deborah Harry will return tor
their first San Francisco performance in two years at Bimbo's. The Peter
Apfelbaum Sextet also plays at 8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
Straight from the experimental East Village scene, the lazz Pas
sengers present a psychedellic jazz in the tradition of the Lounge
Lizards, Albert Aylerand Sun Ra. Together with the haunting voice
of Debbie Harry, they magically, if not humorously, create
melodies and rhythms which both toy with and revere the sancti
ty of silence. The Peter Apflebaum Sextet, from the Bay Area, are
deconstructionist worldbeat musicians.
Also tomorrow, Dr. Billy Taylor, Al Casey, lay McShann, Dick
Hyman, Ralph Sutton and Mike Lipskin with special guests gui
tarist Al Casey and trumpeter Doc Cheatham will perform a trib
ute to seminal jazz artist Fats Waller. "The Piano Legacy of Fats
Waller" is at the Masonic Auditorium at 8:30 p.m.
Waller's contribution to the art of piano-playing and to iazz, in
general, is immeasurable. Although he lived only to 33 (and ar
guably, played himself to death), he made more than 500 record
ings, which display an unrivaled technical mastery of the piano
and his deceptively layered emotional intensity. A daunting event,
the tribute will bring together Harlem stride experts whose ac
complishments range from film scorer for Woody Allen (Dick
Hyman) to former guitarist on 230 of Waller's 500 recordings ( Al
Casey).
On Saturday at 8 p.m., another tribute will take place — this
time to Don Cherry. Charlie Haden, Dewey Redman, Nana Vas
concelos and Peter Apfelbaum will play at the Grace Cathedral.
Although the listening public might recall trumpeter Don
Cherry in relation to his buffalo-dancing stepdaughter, this tribute
performance may clue in listeners into Cherry's contributions to
jazz. Together with Ornette Coleman, Cherry laid the foundations
for experimental and "global" jazz in the '60s by crossing the East
ern-Western musical divide and reaching out to traditional folk
forms. This San Francisco tribute reunites Cherry's closest col
leagues — pre-eminent Brazilian percussionist, Nana Vasconce
los, tenor saxist Dewey Redman and bassist Charlie 1 laden — with
local pianist, Peter Apfelbaum.
Also, on Saturday, the David Sanborn Group will be at the Ma
sonic Auditorium at 8:30 p.m.
On Sunday, Dee Dee Bridgewater with Jacky Terrason and
Mark Murphy sings at the Herbst Theate at, 7 p.m.
Monday and Tuesday are slated for "Backyard Alchemy," a two
day series at Bimbo's featuring local and younger Bay Area artists.
Mingus Amungus, Grassy Knoll, Robert Stewart, losh Jones Quar
tet, Dogslyde and 1 )J Cheb i Sabbah perform on Monday. Dave Ellis

Quartet, Papa's Culture, Ann Dyer&
No Good Time Fairies, Oranj Sym-

phonette, Will Bernard Quartet
and DJ Andrew follow on Tuesday.

Both shows begin at 8 p.m.

On Wednesday at 8 p.m., the
\4.— A.. „

amazing Max Roach will do a solo perfor
mance at the Palace of Fine Arts Theater.
When Roach plays solo, his drum ki* becomes an

entire orchestra, so that each drum head or symbol has a voice
and space of its own. At 72, Roach is commandeering and spreads
i i . , i • 1 j . i • • : i • . . .1 I c:

no doubts as to his leadership in percussion and in the whole of jazz.

On Thursday, "New Orleans Halloween" with Michael Ray & the
Cosmic Krewe, BoGrumpus, Leroy Jones Quintet, I)) Cheb I Sab
bah and 1002 Nights will be at Palace of Fine Arts at 8 p.m.
Nov. 1, John Lee Hooker, Ruth Brown and Charlie Musselwhite
appear at Paramount Theatre in Oakland at 8 p.m.
Anyone with any inkling of the blues will not want to miss out on
Lee Hooker's appearance with great diva Brown and harmonic vir
tuoso Charlie Musselwhite. Fven though Lee Hooker may be thin
ning out his personality in his capacity as Pepsi spokesman, the in
digo munificence of his singing and guitar-playing has not dimin
ished.
Nov. 1-2, Chico O'Farrill Orchestra and Candi Sosa come to
Bimbo's, 8 and 10 p.m.
For those unaware of O'Farrill's contributions to the. spread o!
Latin jazz (together with Dizzy Gillespie, Machito and (iato Barbi
eri), his name is deceiving. Be prepared for fierce dancing and hea\ \
sweating, as O'Farrill orchestrates his big band and conspires with
young salsa phenomenon, Candi Sosa, tor an elaborate Atro-i üban
and (O'Farrill's 75th I birthday celebration.
Also, Nov. 2, "The Guitar Trio," an evening with Paco I )e Lucia,
Al DiMeola and John McLaughlin, will take place at Masonic, 8:30
p.m.
Each of these guitarists plays with a formidable bravado that
makes it difficult to imagine what will happen when the\ convene
on Nov. 2. McLaughlin, a seminal figure in jazz-rock fusion who has
played with Zakir Hussain and Jan (iabarek, will match wits with the
flamenco hero Paco De Lucia and the former guitarist for ('hick
Corea, Al DiMeola.
Nov. 3, "Ellington On The Bay," a iaz/ brunch and cruise with
Mary Stallingsand Paula West will depart from Pier 39 at 11 a.m.
Later that evening will be the last San 1 rancisco la/z Festival per for
mance: the"B-3 Organ Summit" with lack McDutt, Shirley s*.ott,
Duke Jethro. Bimbo's, 7 p.m.

issues in the jazz community, this series will bring together musical
professionals, critics and academicians from international and local
levels.
