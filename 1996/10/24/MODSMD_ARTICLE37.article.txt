# THE 						JAZZ ISSUE
## The 						Intimacy and the Ecstasy Local Performer and Teacher Anton Schwartz Explains Why 'Jazz is Some Funky-Ass Shit' 
### Eric Leventhal 
It is relatively rare to find a musician, artist
or writer who holds on to his dream of cre
ative enterprise and succeeds in molding
that dream into a lasting reality. Anticipating
their entrance into the post-graduate world
of rent payments and electric bills, many of
th ese c rea t i ve sou Is are co m pe I led to su pplan t
their dreams with more "realistic" goals for
the future.
Anton Schwartz is one man who refuses to
give up the dream.
Schwartz, who has been playing the saxo
phone since the age of 14, came to Stanford
hoping to obtain .1 doctorate in computer sci
ence. He had recently graduated magna cum
laude from Harvard University with bache
lor's degrees in philosophy and mathematics.
After completing his master's but before
receiving his doctorate, Schwartz, came to a
striking realization about where he was head
ed: "There was just a moment when 1 real
ized: Who am I doing this for? I don't have to
do this.
"Once I started offering myself a real
choice," he said, "I just gravitated toward
music."
Having pursued a course of study in both
"techie" and "fuzzy" academic disciplines,
Schwartz reconciles the two forms of educa
tion as "expressions of trying to come to grips
with being in the world."
In becoming a jazz saxophonist, Schwartz,
drew his inspiration from a number of
sources. He chose to study with New York
jazz artists Warne Marsh and Eddie Daniels,
both of whom he considers "master crafts
men" of jazz. The teaching styles of these two
mentors were distinct from one another in
that Marsh emphasized "a spiritual apprecia
tion of music. With Eddie (Daniels) it was
more technique — some of the finer points
of jazz."
Schwartz also enrolled in the Eastman
School of Music and went on to play in vari
ous jazz groups in New York and Boston.
Along the way he had the opportunity to play
with such jazz artists as Joshua Redman, Li
onel Hampton, I.arry Goldings and Peter
Bernstein.
Now, at 29, Schwartz has made a name for
himself as an up-and-coming jazz musician
in the Bay Area.
"I never really imagined that I would be
doing it full time," Schwartz remarked. "If I
had listened to everyone else, I would have
learned that there's |almost] no market for
what I'm doing."
In the past, jazz has tended to be an urban
art form, according to Schwartz. But its pop
ularity has risen steadily in recent years with

the significant media attention given to such
well-known figures as Wynton Marsalis, Lisa
Simpson and even the president himself (re
member Arsenio I lall?).
Schwartz maintains regular contact with
Stanford, both as a faculty member of the
Stanford Jazz Workshop — a three-week

summer program offering jazz training to
members of the Palo Alto community — and
as a teacher of beginning and advanced jazz
combos throughout the year.
As for jazz's presence at Stanford,
Schwartz noted that most of the interest
comes from individual students, rather than

from organized efforts.
Schwartz performs at all kinds of
events, formal and casual, but he prefers a
more relaxed atmosphere when he plays.
When choosing a setting for his perfor
mances, Schwartz looks for a certain close
ness with his audience. He loves to play for
"people who are actually listening to the
music."
"The music is an end in itself," he added.
"It's about intimacy. I love playing in inti
mate settings."
Why jazz as opposed to other forms of
music? Schwartz paused before replying very
deliberately, "It gives me an incredibly full
sense of being alive.... Jazz is some funky
ass shit."
According to Schwartz, jazz is one of the
least restrictive forms of performance art,
since much of the music is formed through
improvisation — twisting the original
sounds to fit the performer's vision. He de
scribed the form as "an exultation of life.
There's an incredible sense of willfulness
about it."
"In jazz you generally use a melody as a
framework to start out with, and the chord
changes as a framework for improvisation.
It's all a matter of pacing, creating an emo
tional How and ... judging when the perfor
mance needs a little Kick in the ass," Schwartz
said. "Sometimes the music takes off to the
extent thai you just go with it."
If you still find yourself unable to appreci
ate the beauty of this musical form, Schwartz
observed, "Try turning up the volume. You
find an incredible richness that's just churn
ing and moves the soul."
But jazz doesn't have to be fast and furious
to create an energy between the musicians
and the audience. "Some of the most intense
moments I've had were playing ballads,"
Schwartz explained. "Every note just be
comes a creation, an act of will."
When the pace of the music slows, ob
served Schwartz, the room may slip into "a
calm, but that doesn't imply a lack of energy,
(since you know) something very new and
unique is being created."
For Schwartz, some of this freshness
comes from playing with a variety of Bay
Area musicians, rather than just sticking to
one group. The selections themselves change
with each performance, depending on the
creative energy between the saxophonist and
a particular group of musicians.
"It's an absolutely thrilling thing to be on
stage," Schwartz said. "It's remarkable ...
that I play and people want to listen."

"It's about intimacy. I love playing in inti
mate settings."
Why jazz as opposed to other forms of
music? Schwartz paused before replying very
deliberately, "It gives me an incredibly full
sense of being alive.... Jazz is some funky
ass shit."
According to Schwartz, jazz is one of the
least restrictive forms of performance art,
since much of the music is formed through
improvisation — twisting the original
sounds to fit the performer's vision. He de
scribed the form as "an exultation of life.
There's an incredible sense of willfulness
about it."
"In jazz you generally use a melody as a
framework to start out with, and the chord
changes as a framework for improvisation.
It's all a matter of pacing, creating an emo
tional How and ... judging when the perfor
mance needs a little Kick in the ass," Schwartz
said. "Sometimes the music takes off to the
extent thai you just go with it."
If you still find yourself unable to appreci
ate the beauty of this musical form, Schwartz
observed, "Try turning up the volume. You
find an incredible richness that's just churn
ing and moves the soul."
But jazz doesn't have to be fast and furious
to create an energy between the musicians
and the audience. "Some of the most intense
moments I've had were playing ballads,"
Schwartz explained. "Every note just be
comes a creation, an act of will."
When the pace of the music slows, ob
served Schwartz, the room may slip into "a
calm, but that doesn't imply a lack of energy,
(since you know) something very new and
unique is being created."
For Schwartz, some of this freshness
comes from playing with a variety of Bay
Area musicians, rather than just sticking to
one group. The selections themselves change
with each performance, depending on the
creative energy between the saxophonist and
a particular group of musicians.
"It's an absolutely thrilling thing to be on
stage," Schwartz said. "It's remarkable ...
that I play and people want to listen."
