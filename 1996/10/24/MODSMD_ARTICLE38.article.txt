## Dance For Your Life Bill T. Jones Company interprets race, faith and sexuality 
### Michelle Chai 
Recognizing that Big Game is right around
the corner, I offer one good reason to visit
Berkeley before you have to — Bill T.
Jones.
The New York-based Bill T. Jones / Arnie
Zane Dance Company, known for its poignant
themes, abstract choreography and theatrical
bent, comes to UC-Berkeley this weekend for
the West Coast premiere of seven new and re
choreographed works.
Their performances, set to various litera
ture, music and visual media, drew sold-out
crowds last year and will undoubtedly do the
same again. This time, they innovatively inter
pret the works of various artists such as pho
tographer Robert Mapplethorpe, Dada poet
Kurt Schwitters, poet Dylan Thomas and
French singer Jacques Brel, to name a few.
It is Jones' talent to surprise, inspire and
even cause controversy among his audience all

via movement. And as the principal choreog
rapher of the company, he has the privilege of
choosing what to translate into movement.
Without exception, everything he chooses is
personally and deeply felt; the themes of race,
faith and sexuality, for example, figure strong
ly in many of his pieces.
Most notably, his latest evening-length
piece, "Still / Here," deals with the issue of
human mortality, brought painfully close to
home as a result of partner Arnie Zane's death
from AIDS as well as his own experience being
HIV-positive. But Jones expresses a hope for
the future, shown in his inclination to use
music and poetry with a sense of optimism.
Odile Reine-Adelaide, who recently won a
New York Dance and Performance (Bessie)
Award for her five years in the company, be
lieves such issues — discussed within the com
pany while creating a piece — have been in
trinsic to her personal growth.
"The fact that we as dancers have to perform

not just movement but deal with questions of
mortality is definitely a challenge. [It's] not just
a challenge but an enterprise that not many
dancers have to work with 1 just have a feel
ing that I grew up as a person."
And accompanying the emotional work
that goes into each piece is, of course, the phys
ical work. Many of the dance movements result
from Jones' personal improvisations, which he
captures on videotape, according to Reine-
Adelaide. After watching himself on tape, Jones
chooses which movements he wants to use and
has rehearsal director Janet Wong break them
down into their various components.
The moves are then taught to the dancers.
But, as the 11-member company knows better
than anyone else, everyone has his or her own
way of doing things. So it is always a challenge
to learn and look natural performing some
thing that "flows out of (Bill's) body," as Reine-
Adelaide put it, but not out of yours. "It's hard
to be real honest with the movement," said
Reine-Adelaide.
Even as a senior member, she hasn't found
that the technical and emotional process gets
easier. "Nothing comes naturally," she said.
But there is always room for individual
style, and the process of learning isn't unpleas
ant. It mav be meticulous, but it is never bor

ing. And the times the material comes more
naturally are always a bonus. Reine-Adelaide is
excited about being featured in "Sur La Place,"
for example, because of her French roots.
"I'm French and I love Jacques Brel. It just
reminds me of home ... it's just personal be
cause I happen to understand."
The freedom the dancers have to discuss
and express ideas is an opportunity extended
to the audience as well. Post-performance dis
cussions on Friday and Saturday with Jones
and the company openly encourage feedback.
So do come — it might be your last chance in
a while to talk about more than football al
Berkeley.
