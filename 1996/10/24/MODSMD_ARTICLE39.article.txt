## High on Life 'Mushroom Jazz' Offers a Trippy Sound in a Multimedia Context 
### 
Take a cup of deep bass rhythms, mix in a
few soulful vocals, a bit of hip hop and an oc
casional sax solo, shake vigorously and you'll
have "Mushroom Jazz," the latest set of music
to come out of the San Francisco under
ground club culture.
Continuously mixed by DJ Mark Farina,
this two-compact disc set places acid jazz in a
previously unexplored multimedia forum,
combining the jazzy hip hop beat of various
artists on an audio CD with the visual ex
pression of still art and video on CD-ROM.
Listen to the first disc and you'll get a
sense of what acid jazz really means. As
Julius Papp says in "Warm Chill:" "I think
music is an instrument. It can create the ini
tial thought patterns that can change the
thinking of people." The music itself doesn't
necessarily make you think, hut it gets you
in a groove.
Nor is the whole album a homogenous

stream of music. Paul Johnson punches out
Marvin Gaye-esque vocals on "If we lose
our way," while "In Hale," by Hydroponic
Groove Sessions, gets away with a fully in
strumental sound, with voice-overs remi
niscent of that early G + C Music Factory
version of dance music. The toned-down
Aretha Franklin-style melody of Lalomie
Washburn melds into Blue Boy's "Remem
ber Me," a grass-roots jam with a repetitive
but catchy melody line.
Although the audio disc is its own entity,
the CD-ROM is an almost essential comple
ment in experiencing the full richness of
Mushroom Jazz. Pop in the CD-ROM disc
to view jazz club art galleries, DJ interview
videos and the first Mushroom Jazz Mix
Station, which allows you to make your own
jazz mixes from embedded samples.
Although navigation through the pro
gram proves to be somewhat difficult, as the
main page "menu" has no labels (the finger
tips of a hand denote the different areas),
the CD is loaded with information that

meshes well with the music. Much of its

content is advertising for other OM al

bums, but some features, like

ShroomView (the art gallery and

video clips area), and the
Mushroom Jazz Mix
.>a . i M

Station are definitely
worth exploring.
The CD even pro
vides a link to the
OM Records web
page.

Although the multimedia \
aspect of this album may not ap
peal to listeners without CD-ROM
drives, there is no need to discount
the album because of it. The cost, as
OM Records says, is the "same as
that dusty Kenny Loggins CI) in
your garage." Besides, the extra
disc can always be passed on to a
friend or used as a coaster (they
work great!).
