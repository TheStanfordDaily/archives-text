# Responding to emergencies
## Campus contingency plans as varied as the services provided 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
With most members of the bio
chemistry lab on a retreat Oct. 10,
Mary Smith found herself alone
dealing with a serious dilemma:
She was in a lab full of samples
and research needing refrigera
tion but without power.
Smith was one of many people
around campus adversely affected
by the Oct. 10 power outage.
Along with other departments
and businesses, she discovered
how well disaster plans worked
when tested.
Plugging in the refrigeration
units into the emergency power
supply is normally no easy task
said Smith, the biochemistry labo
ratory manager. In a power out
age, the units must be moved

away from the wall, an extension
cord attached and the cords
plugged into sockets in the hall
way.
