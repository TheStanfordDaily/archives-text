# Responding to emergencies
## Campus contingency plans as varied as the services provided 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
With most members of the bio
chemistry lab on a retreat Oct. 10,
Mary Smith found herself alone
dealing with a serious dilemma:
She was in a lab full of samples
and research needing refrigera
tion but without power.
Smith was one of many people
around campus adversely affected
by the Oct. 10 power outage.
Along with other departments
and businesses, she discovered
how well disaster plans worked
when tested.
Plugging in the refrigeration
units into the emergency power
supply is normally no easy task
said Smith, the biochemistry labo
ratory manager. In a power out
age, the units must be moved

away from the wall, an extension
cord attached and the cords
plugged into sockets in the hall
way.


PART TWO OF A THREE-PART SERIES
Taking that action, however,
would have been worthless.
"We're supposed to have the
emergency backup power, which
did not come on," Smith said.
Because both the Cardinal Co
generation Facility, Stanford's
own power plant, and Pacific Gas
& Electric were cut off for a time
during the last power outage, the
backup system failed.
"If we cannot depend on Stan
ford or PG&E, then we are limited
in our options," she said.
Generators are not an alterna
tive, she said, because of logistical
problems. A gas generator would
be dangerous to run inside, and it
would be difficult to run a line be
tween the fourth-floor labs and an
outside generator.
She said she and other lab man
agers have been meeting to review
contingency plans.
In the case of a total outage, the
sole option is to use dry ice, which
could keep temperatures down to
about minus 20 degrees Celsius.
However, some samples need an
ultra-deep freeze, a temperature
of minus 80 degrees Celsius.
The managers also are consid
ering duplicating some crucial bac
terial strains and storing them at a
facility in a different state, Smith
added.
A long outage "would be a total
disaster," she said.
The power outage was enough
of a disaster, causing tempera
tures to rise in the refrigeration

units enough to damage or destroy
some enzymes, Smith said.
"More important than the
thousands and thousands of dol
lars it would cost to replace the en
zymes is the loss of years of re
search efforts that are stored in
the ultra-low freezers," she said.
Businesses and services
While Smith scrambled to save
the research, others found them
selves in the dark in places such as
the Bookstore.
Some students in the Bookstore
during the outage reported that
parts of the building were very
dark. Cashiers found themselves
counting down their registers by
flashlight.
According to Bookstore Direc
tor of Operations Ken Shark, who
was not at the store during the
outage, the Bookstore has battery
powered emergency lights in the
case of an outage.
"We don't have a generator,"
Shark said. "If we have a power
outage, we're going to close the
store."
In the case of an emergency,
Shark said the Bookstore assists
the customers out of the store.
"During the power outage, it was a
controlled, gentle evacuation," he
said.
The store is then locked up, and
campus police check in case of loot
ing, he said.
Operations in Tresidder Union
found themselves with a similar
problem, said Mary Clark, the dis
trict manager for Bon Appetit
Management Co.
While the main seating area in
Tresidder had a few emergency

lights, the Coffee House was
plunged into complete darkness,
as the emergency lights failed.
Clark said none of the Bon Ap
petit-operated eateries has either
generator power or a concrete
emergency plan. However, 10-
day food supplies have been pre
pared.
"There's not a really good plan
in place," she said. "We really need
to sit down and take a good look at
a plan for this space. It is a com
munity space. In the outage, some
people didn't know where to go,
and they came here, to the campus
center."
However, Dean of Students
Marc Wais said "there is no set
plan for Tresidder, unique from
any place here."
Unlike the Bookstore and
Tresidder, Stanford Shopping
Center does have a concrete emer
gency plan, said spokeswoman
Julie Pitt.
"We have a complete emer
gency plan," she said. "It covers a
basis from earthquakes to giant
wind storms and every potential
emergency."
She said that in the case of an
emergency, security officers will
go from store to store to check the
safety of employees and cus
tomers.
If there is serious damage, the
shopping center has agreements
with vendors such as lumber sup
pliers to help board up windows
"in a moment's notice." Also, she
said the center has agreements
with the police and fire depart
ments.
However, like most everywhere
else on campus, the center would

have serious problems in the case
of an extended outage, as Pitt said
most vendors do not have genera
tors.
"Some of the department stores
have generators for enough light
ing," she said.
"Most businesses are comput
er-driven and can't conduct busi
ness without power even if there is
a demand," she said. "Probably
the only big concern is for the food
merchants and their refrigeration
issues."
Almost a year ago, the emer
gency plan was put into effect dur
ing a brief three-alarm fire in the
space now occupied by Blooming
dale's.
"It was a minor emergency,"
Pitt said. "The response was so
great, and we got a trial run of the
emergency plan. We were able to
make changes where we needed."
The center has been closed in
the past due to emergencies, she
said, including the Loma Prieta
Earthquake and the Rodney King
verdict.
"It's always on our minds," Pitt
said.
Athletics
With the numerous sports the
University offers, the probability
of a sporting event being in
progress during a disaster is fairly
high.
Asst. Athletic Director Ray
Purpur said the Department of
Athletics has a similar plan to the
University. In the case of a serious
disaster, the first priority would
be life safety, followed by the
preservation of property and the
restoration of the athletic pro

gram.
"However, in the case of an ath
letic event in progress, everything
changes," Purpur said.
There is an emergency proce
dure for every athletics facility in
cluded in the 31-page plan. In most
cases, a public address announce
ment is made telling spectators to
remain calm. After a quick check
of emergency exits is made, the
events staff will proceed with evac
uation.
"All of our events staff is
trained at the beginning of the sea
son," he said.
The plan is centered around the
event of an earthquake or a bomb
threat, he added. However, the
same plan is designed to work in
case of a fire, a chemical spill, a
hostage situation or even an air
craft crash.
Facilities are equipped with ei
ther generators or battery-operat
ed lights in the case of power fail
ure, Purpur said.
During the power outage, there
were games scheduled, and none
were delayed or moved as a result.
In the case that the power was not
restored in time for Friday or Sat
urday, he said, only a water polo
game would have been in jeop
ardy.
"If we could not get the pumps
working several hours before the
game, we would have moved the
game," he said.
Even if power had not been re
stored in time for the homecoming
football game against Oregon,
Purpur said the game would have
gone on.
"We rented four or five genera
tors and had them staged around

the stadium," he said. "Our first
priority would have been to get the
restroom and concessions power
going.
"The second would have been to
get the press box power restored
and finally the power to the public
address system, the scoreboard
and the locker rooms."
After all, Purpur said that
scoreboards and even lighted
bathrooms are not necessary to
play a football game.
"Even if it would have hap
pened five hours before the game,
we would just go with it."
Lessons from the outage
Many Stanford laboratories,
businesses and other organiza
tions were able to take valuable
lessons away from the blackout, as
(excluding the case of the laborato
ries) there was little or no damage
as a result.
"The blackout was helpful in
sending an alert throughout the
campus that we are susceptible to
circumstances beyond our con
trol," said Wais. "There needs to
be a vigilance in maintaining
emergency protocols."
He added the outage was espe
cially helpful, as many people now
at Stanford were not around dur
ing the Loma Prieta Earthquake.
"This was a nonthreatening
wake-up call that people need to
pay attention," Wais said.
"In the '89 earthquake, we
were lucky in that we never even
lost electricity," Smith said. "Next
time, we may not be so lucky."

in place," she said. "We really need
to sit down and take a good look at
a plan for this space. It is a com
munity space. In the outage, some
people didn't know where to go,
and they came here, to the campus
center."
However, Dean of Students
Marc Wais said "there is no set
plan for Tresidder, unique from
any place here."
Unlike the Bookstore and
Tresidder, Stanford Shopping
Center does have a concrete emer
gency plan, said spokeswoman
Julie Pitt.
"We have a complete emer
gency plan," she said. "It covers a
basis from earthquakes to giant
wind storms and every potential
emergency."
She said that in the case of an
emergency, security officers will
go from store to store to check the
safety of employees and cus
tomers.
If there is serious damage, the
shopping center has agreements
with vendors such as lumber sup
pliers to help board up windows
"in a moment's notice." Also, she
said the center has agreements
with the police and fire depart
ments.
However, like most everywhere
else on campus, the center would

have serious problems in the case
of an extended outage, as Pitt said
most vendors do not have genera
tors.
"Some of the department stores
have generators for enough light
ing," she said.
"Most businesses are comput
er-driven and can't conduct busi
ness without power even if there is
a demand," she said. "Probably
the only big concern is for the food
merchants and their refrigeration
issues."
Almost a year ago, the emer
gency plan was put into effect dur
ing a brief three-alarm fire in the
space now occupied by Blooming
dale's.
"It was a minor emergency,"
Pitt said. "The response was so
great, and we got a trial run of the
emergency plan. We were able to
make changes where we needed."
The center has been closed in
the past due to emergencies, she
said, including the Loma Prieta
Earthquake and the Rodney King
verdict.
"It's always on our minds," Pitt
said.
Athletics
With the numerous sports the
University offers, the probability
of a sporting event being in
progress during a disaster is fairly
high.
Asst. Athletic Director Ray
Purpur said the Department of
Athletics has a similar plan to the
University. In the case of a serious
disaster, the first priority would
be life safety, followed by the
preservation of property and the
restoration of the athletic pro

gram.
"However, in the case of an ath
letic event in progress, everything
changes," Purpur said.
There is an emergency proce
dure for every athletics facility in
cluded in the 31-page plan. In most
cases, a public address announce
ment is made telling spectators to
remain calm. After a quick check
of emergency exits is made, the
events staff will proceed with evac
uation.
"All of our events staff is
trained at the beginning of the sea
son," he said.
The plan is centered around the
event of an earthquake or a bomb
threat, he added. However, the
same plan is designed to work in
case of a fire, a chemical spill, a
hostage situation or even an air
craft crash.
Facilities are equipped with ei
ther generators or battery-operat
ed lights in the case of power fail
ure, Purpur said.
During the power outage, there
were games scheduled, and none
were delayed or moved as a result.
In the case that the power was not
restored in time for Friday or Sat
urday, he said, only a water polo
game would have been in jeop
ardy.
"If we could not get the pumps
working several hours before the
game, we would have moved the
game," he said.
Even if power had not been re
stored in time for the homecoming
football game against Oregon,
Purpur said the game would have
gone on.
"We rented four or five genera
tors and had them staged around

the stadium," he said. "Our first
priority would have been to get the
restroom and concessions power
going.
"The second would have been to
get the press box power restored
and finally the power to the public
address system, the scoreboard
and the locker rooms."
After all, Purpur said that
scoreboards and even lighted
bathrooms are not necessary to
play a football game.
"Even if it would have hap
pened five hours before the game,
we would just go with it."
Lessons from the outage
Many Stanford laboratories,
businesses and other organiza
tions were able to take valuable
lessons away from the blackout, as
(excluding the case of the laborato
ries) there was little or no damage
as a result.
"The blackout was helpful in
sending an alert throughout the
campus that we are susceptible to
circumstances beyond our con
trol," said Wais. "There needs to
be a vigilance in maintaining
emergency protocols."
He added the outage was espe
cially helpful, as many people now
at Stanford were not around dur
ing the Loma Prieta Earthquake.
"This was a nonthreatening
wake-up call that people need to
pay attention," Wais said.
"In the '89 earthquake, we
were lucky in that we never even
lost electricity," Smith said. "Next
time, we may not be so lucky."

Tomorrow: Communication dur
ing a tragedy.
With most members of the bio
chemistry lab on a retreat Oct. 10,
Mary Smith found herself alone
dealing with a serious dilemma:
She was in a lab full of samples
and research needing refrigera
tion but without power.
Smith was one of many people
around campus adversely affected
by the Oct. 10 power outage.
Along with other departments
and businesses, she discovered
how well disaster plans worked
when tested.
Plugging in the refrigeration
units into the emergency power
supply is normally no easy task
said Smith, the biochemistry labo
ratory manager. In a power out
age, the units must be moved

away from the wall, an extension
cord attached and the cords
plugged into sockets in the hall
way.


PART TWO OF A THREE-PART SERIES
Taking that action, however,
would have been worthless.
"We're supposed to have the
emergency backup power, which
did not come on," Smith said.
Because both the Cardinal Co
generation Facility, Stanford's
own power plant, and Pacific Gas
& Electric were cut off for a time
during the last power outage, the
backup system failed.
"If we cannot depend on Stan
ford or PG&E, then we are limited
in our options," she said.
Generators are not an alterna
tive, she said, because of logistical
problems. A gas generator would
be dangerous to run inside, and it
would be difficult to run a line be
tween the fourth-floor labs and an
outside generator.
She said she and other lab man
agers have been meeting to review
contingency plans.
In the case of a total outage, the
sole option is to use dry ice, which
could keep temperatures down to
about minus 20 degrees Celsius.
However, some samples need an
ultra-deep freeze, a temperature
of minus 80 degrees Celsius.
The managers also are consid
ering duplicating some crucial bac
terial strains and storing them at a
facility in a different state, Smith
added.
A long outage "would be a total
disaster," she said.
The power outage was enough
of a disaster, causing tempera
tures to rise in the refrigeration

units enough to damage or destroy
some enzymes, Smith said.
"More important than the
thousands and thousands of dol
lars it would cost to replace the en
zymes is the loss of years of re
search efforts that are stored in
the ultra-low freezers," she said.
Businesses and services
While Smith scrambled to save
the research, others found them
selves in the dark in places such as
the Bookstore.
Some students in the Bookstore
during the outage reported that
parts of the building were very
dark. Cashiers found themselves
counting down their registers by
flashlight.
According to Bookstore Direc
tor of Operations Ken Shark, who
was not at the store during the
outage, the Bookstore has battery
powered emergency lights in the
case of an outage.
"We don't have a generator,"
Shark said. "If we have a power
outage, we're going to close the
store."
In the case of an emergency,
Shark said the Bookstore assists
the customers out of the store.
"During the power outage, it was a
controlled, gentle evacuation," he
said.
The store is then locked up, and
campus police check in case of loot
ing, he said.
Operations in Tresidder Union
found themselves with a similar
problem, said Mary Clark, the dis
trict manager for Bon Appetit
Management Co.
While the main seating area in
Tresidder had a few emergency

lights, the Coffee House was
plunged into complete darkness,
as the emergency lights failed.
Clark said none of the Bon Ap
petit-operated eateries has either
generator power or a concrete
emergency plan. However, 10-
day food supplies have been pre
pared.
"There's not a really good plan
in place," she said. "We really need
to sit down and take a good look at
a plan for this space. It is a com
munity space. In the outage, some
people didn't know where to go,
and they came here, to the campus
center."
