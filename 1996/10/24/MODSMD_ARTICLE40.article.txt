"fit The Shadow of
World War II"

Despite the prominence of Prokofiev,
Poulenc and Carter, none of their cello
sonatas has yet made it into mainstream

repertoire. But precisely for this reason,
these pieces still sound startlingly fresh. The
Joel Krosnick-Gilbert Kalish duo highlights
in a stylistically sensitive and cogent playing
the historical link that binds these seeming
ly unrelated works.
The Prokofiev Sonata is a late work dedi
cated to the then-young Rostropovich. Even
at the onset of Soviet persecution,
Prokofiev's idiom is identifiable. Only, this
time around, his unique rhythm and lyri
cism are framed in a more restrained and
classically inclined structure. The K-K duo
opts for a more down-to-earth approach

and seeks out the nationalistic flavor in
Prokofiev, where the formidable Ma-Ax duo
tends to indulge the nuances and subtler in
flections.
Poulenc shows a more serious side in this
sonata than in his usual instrumental en
deavors, where unrelated themes and phras
es are juxtaposed to create a kaleidoscopic
effect. In a less careful hand, Poulenc's
music can comes across as unbearably
cheesy. The K-K duo rightfully and cleverly
eschews giving in to sentimentality and de
livers a coherent rendition by adopting a
consistent tempo.
It is the Carter Sonata, though, that
brings out the best of the duo, who responds
to the work's distinctive Americanism. Ik* it
cross-rhythm, syncopation or jazzy effect,
the duo interprets this sonata with such a
unified vision and conviction that it seems
the work was tailor-made for them. This is
definitely the highlight of the album,
though it may also be the toughest piece for
an average audience to grasp.
With no obvious contenders in the cho
sen repertoire, this new release fills a unique
niche in the not yet jaded cello repertoire.
Krosnick has warm intonation and flowing
bow stroke, even though pianist Kalish at
times sounds stiff. But as a duo, their rap
port is indeed admirable.
