"Dilate"

Unlike the road album, the "relation
ship" album is not yet a standard in the

music biz. And perhaps for good reason.
While an album composed during a hard
lived road tour connotes good drugs, bad
nights and loyal roadies, an album dedicat
ed to the spiral of a single relationship — no
matter how gut-sucking — sounds terribly
touchy-feely.
But if there's any future for such a poten
tial album genre, there couldn't be a better
ambassador for it than Ani DiFranco's "Di
late." She's long been the darling of indepen
dent chick-rock, and I think she's ready to
bust into something really big any moment
now.
Although "Dilate" is not musically ad
venturous enough to set new standards for
folk or rock, the lyrics are raw, sterling and
as dead-on as DiFranco has ever been. I ike
other independent artists, she often sings
about the tensions between the music in
dustry and artistic integrity. Her music has
been produced by her own label for almost a
decade, even as DiFranco flirts with popular
recognition. More impressively, however,
DiFranco's work sweats with an honesty her
peers can barely conceive of. This newest re
lease ups the ante by yet another notch:
Never whiny or reactionary, "Dilate" is a
commitment not to commercialism or even
artistry but to the development of feeling.
"Dilate" progresses through the twists of
a wrenching relationship, beginning with
the reflective "Untouchable Face," including
a protracted cover of "Amazing Grace"
somewhere in the middle and ending with
the redemption of "Joyful Girl." Yet as trite
as that summary sounds, the album truly
does justice to the experience without di
minishing it.
DiFranco can do rageful angst with the
best of them. "Oulta Me, Onto You" and
"Done Wrong" brim with the cathartic en

ergy that Alanis Morrisette aspires to. But
DiFranco has a gift for the cutting metaphor
that is both dramatic and deep: "i wear (my
heart) underneath / my right pant
leg / strapped to my boot."
Best of all, DiFranco's lyrics are marked
by a poetess's striving to understand, not
merely to be understood. On the final track,
DiFranco brings the album to a satisfying
close, singing, "the bathroom mirror has
not budged / and the woman who lives
there .. . looks me in the eye / and says
would you prefer the easy way / no, well OK
then / don't cry."
Plumbing the nuances of personal
tragedies, Ani DiFranco is that person with
the rare courage not only to describe despair
but to then find the hidden pearl of hope be
neath. Don't make the mistake of lumping
DiFranco with the teeming herd of mourn
ful, angry grrl rockers that now dot the pop
music landscape. This is an artist who un
derstands that self-creation is a privilege, al
beit a difficult and complex one.
What more can 1 do to sing this woman's
praises? This album is cleansing as a cup of
Drano — and good for you, too.
