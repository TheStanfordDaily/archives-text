## DOWNSET "Do We Speak a Dead Language?" 
### 
The sticky death-metal crunch guitar of
Ares, the tempo cymbal saturation of Chris
l ee and the gurgling bass licks of James
Morris are not the best Downset has to offer
the listener. It's vocalist Rey Anthony
Oropeza's hollering and screaming that
packs a punch to Downset's latest release,
"Do We Speak A Dead Language?"
Downset's self-titled first album came out in
1994. With the exception of vacant ax
wielder Rogelio Lo/.ano, the lineup has re
mained intact.
The comparisons are easy to make: "Em
power," a groove about positive thinking,
sounds like Rage Against the Machine after
10 gallons of coffee. The vocals have a Sepul
tra-style growl, and the entire album has a
Deftones feel to it. Still, Downset does noth
ing wrong here. It's a solid album.
Make no mistake about it, Downset is a
hard-core straight edge (sXe) group. What is
sXe? In the simplest of terms, a branch of
punk rock that emerged in the 1980s con
demning the use of mind-altering drugs and
other substances deemed "abusive."
Minor Threat is the group widely accept
ed as the forefathers of sXe. Singer lan
MacKaye kick-started the movement with
the lyrics, "Don't drink, don't smoke, don't
fuck." Downset goes after beef, drugs and
sex. On "Ashes in Hand," Oropeza sings,
"Seconds of trembling flesh is not worth
years of inner suffering. Taken away! Sex
kills!"
Oropeza also wails against "satanic na
tions," "juice, coke, yeska, heroin, doses,"
"lovelessness," "subliminal racist, stereotyp
ical wak" and "millions of Mark Fuhrmans."
The best song of the album is the pound
ing punk rock of "Against the Spirits." 1 can't
identify with the words, "There is a God and

I will bow and you will hate me for it," but
it's a great number. Many of the things
Downset has to say will appear extremist to
most rock audiences, but a lot of it makes
perfect sense. The album starts with a sam
ple from a Martin Luther King |r. speech,
and the theme of the messages is one of pos
itivity — an end to violence, lies and racism.
More than anything, Downset calls for love.
"Dead Language" isn't ground-breaking.
The music begins to get predictable after a
few songs, which is a mixed blessing. But
what Downset lacks in diversity, it gains in
consistency. This album is recommended
for people who appreciate a traditional
hard-core sound; it's not for people listening
for a new approach to contemporary metal.
