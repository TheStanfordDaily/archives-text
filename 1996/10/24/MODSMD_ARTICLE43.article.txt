"Secret Swingers"

I've always thought of Versus as a music
critic's band, since on paper they look so ap
pealing: three brothers, Richard, Fd and
James Baluyut, and a female bassist by the
unlikely name of Fontaine Toups, raising a
well-mannered indie-rock racket in the style
of Helium or Unrest.
Versus' guitar clang is lifted straight out

of a Sonic Youth song, scrubbed clean of
distortion and distilled into a moody,
slightly dissonant jangle. Richard and
Fontaine share vocal duties, with
Richard's quavering, sometimes off-key
singing contrasting with Fontaine's
strong, clear voice. Versus' songs seem to
resonate with the beauty and innocence of
childhood but are tempered with the wis
dom of experience.
But even after listening to Versus' new
album "Secret Swingers" several times, it
still doesn't leave much of an impression. All
the ingredients for a truly great band are
present: a great guitar sound, distinctive
melodies and incisive lyricism, but it doesn't
quite pay off for me. It's the case of the whole
not quite being the sum of its parts.
"Secret Swingers" isn't much of a depar
ture from their 1994 college-radio staple
"The Stars Are Insane," although on the
whole the music sounds less like the work of
individuals and more like that of a full band.
"Secret Swingers" starts off promisingly
enough, with the lovesick swoon of "Lose
That Dress," the crunchy drive of "Yeah You"
and the epic sweep of "Glitter of Love." After
that, though, there were only a few moments
that brought my wandering attention back
to the album, such as the low-key acoustic
flavor of "Jealous" and the lush poppiness of
"One Million."
I really want to like "Secret Swingers," but

Versus' beauty seems too calculated and d
liberate to me to feel genuine. It's too obv
ous that their songs are well-written; tl
best songs are those where you don't noti
the work that goes into the song writin
Versus gets a gold star for effort, but they'
still got a long way to go before they turn o
something truly memorable.
