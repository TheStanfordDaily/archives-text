## Badfellas Three losers try to break into crime in 'Palookaville' 
### 
Director Alan Taylor's "Palookaville" is by
far the longest 92-minute movie that 1 have
ever seen. It putters along yet carefully weaves
together a story of three unemployed friends
that take up a temporary life of crime to make
extra money.
Please don't be confused. This is not a par
ticularly violent movie. Sid (William
Forsythe), Jerry (Adam Trese) and Russ
(Vincent Ciallo) are not bad guys. Actually,
they're more like big babies.
Taylor said in a press release, "In every rela
tionship we wanted to show that the men had
to evolve a little faster and a little further if they
were going to catch up with the women." Tay
lor's film illustrates his point.
Frances McDormand's prostitute, June,
adds the only breath of fresh air to an other
wise stock character lineup. All of the per
formances, however, are well-acted. They're
just fairly predictable. There is the naive,
gentle (erry, who doesn't want to hurt any
body; Sid, who cannot put an old relation
ship behind him; and Russ, the bad seed who
comes from a broken home and has a prob
lem with commitment. Entertaining yet
foreseeable.
The movie is inspired by Italo Calvino's
short stories. Calvino wrote in the 1940s
about the daily lives of ordinary Italian men.
However, Taylor sets his movie in New Jersey
in present time, a choice which causes con
fusion. Although the characters' crimes are
modern, their clothing and haircuts are a
thing of the past. Even the lighting, or lack
thereof, is reminiscent of a film noir. The
time warp appears fabricated because Taylor
does not complete the transition. He allows
elements like the lighting and appearances of

the past of survive.
Although they're far from the Three
Stooges, the friends have their comedic mo
ments. Russ' brother-in-law Ed (Gareth
Williams) is a bumbling cop whose life goal
is to arrest the three would-be criminals. His
revolting mannerisms and sheer lack of

brains are hilarious. Some of the crimes
themselves are funny, as well. Toward the be
ginning of the film, the three break through
a brick wall in an attempt to rob a jewelry
store but end up breaking into the bakery
next door. As the police arrive, Jerry gorges
himself on powdered doughnuts, happier

than if he'd snatched a thousand diamonds.
"Palookaville" won the 1995 Kodak Prize
for Best First Feature at the Venice Film Fes
tival. Flowever, it is neither surprisingly won
derful nor dreadfully awful. Try a matinee.

I wonder what they're talking about! Probably crime. Jerry (Adam Trese), Russ (Vincent Gallo) and Sid (William Forsythe) play rough
in "Palookaville."
