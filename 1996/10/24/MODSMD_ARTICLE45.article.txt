## Pacino's self-indulgent mess leaves audiences looking' for more 
### 
Al Pacino has made his own film, "Looking for 1
s
Richard," and we think he could've also writ- j
ten his own article for Intermission:
I'm going to write it. I'm going to direct, '
produce, star and be Shakespeare. It's going 1
to he all my film or nothing. I'm going to he s
experimental and unconventional. I'm £
going to create art, or something! This is my 1
t

Km*
chance, darn it.
Hollywood is so ... mainstream. I'll
choose a risky, fringe production company,
not a real one hut a good industrial off
shoot bandwagon one, like Fox Searchlight
Pictures. Nobody will try to argue me down
because it's Shakespeare; that's the best part.
Shakespeare is boring, sure, but that
hardly matters since the film really has
nothing to do with him. Only me! Bring in
some fresh and pretty superstars, get silly,
get somebody to explain iambic pentameter
to me. I'll even film the producers when
they tell me the whole idea is ridiculous,

though I don't know why I'll do that. I can
make any scene totally radical, as long as it's
filmed handheld. Fail-safe. A lot of blurry
nonsensical editing — works every time.
But it's really about me, come on. And
emotion! I've got emotion, heck. This is the
real Al Pacino. Who am I? I'm the great gen
eral in the war for the dramatic arts. I have
truth, humanity, love and money on my
side; I'm a king.
No. Really, who am I fooling? I can't play
Richard 111 — I barely understand the
blasted play. How am I, a high school
dropout, supposed to document cinemati

cally a dcconstruction of one of Shake
speare's most complex plays? All by myself
at that, I say it's impossible! 1 can't just wear
my cap backwards and be one with the kids.
Letting off like I have a great purpose at
hand while just leeching onto Shakespeare's
name — I mean that's so cheap! There's re
ally no grounds at all for me to be attempt
ing this. Well?
Please, as long as The Village Voice gives
me a decent review, I'll be okay. It's an art
film for Christ's sake, so I should be able to
do anything. 1 really should.
— James Copeland, not really Al Pacino
