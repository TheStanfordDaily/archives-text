## Party of Two Ghost story comes alive in heartwarming 'Gillian' 
### 
What's with Hollywood these days? It
seems that film titles keep on getting longer
and longer, while films get more and more
trite. Those were my thoughts before I saw di
rector Michael Pressman's "To Gillian on Her
37th Birthday," but 1 left the theater re-evalu
ating my initial judgment. This film was sur
prisingly well done.
The plot seems cliche enough. Two years
have passed since David Lewis' (Peter Gal
lagher) wife, Gillian (Michelle Pfeiffer), died
in a tragic boating accident on her birthday.
David, who has still not come to terms with

her death, lives as a recluse in Nantucket. His
16-year-old daughter Rachel (Claire Danes)
returns to the island on Labor Day weekend,
with her uncle Paul (Bruce Altman) and aunt
Esther (Kathy Baker), after spending the
summer with them.
Meddlesome and perhaps callous match
makers Paul and Esther bring along a
"friend" named Kevin (Wendy Crewson) in
the hopes of fixing David up with her. At this
point, it becomes rather apparent to the au
dience that a bizarre weekend is about to
ensue. Interspersed between the sand castle
competition and karaoke singing that David
does every year on Gillian's birthday are his
conversations on the beach with her chost.

Meanwhile, Paul and Esther, while debat
ing whether to take Rachel to live with them,
re-examine their own marriage. Their con
cern for Rachel grows as she experiences
much too quickly all that she has been miss
ing out on as a result of living with David —
alcohol, boys and her first kiss. When Rachel
wakes up in the middle of the night scream
ing about Gillian visiting her, Paul and 1 sther
decide that they must take Rachel to live with
them.
Only now does David realize that Ins ob
session with Gillian has damaged his rela
tionship with his daughter. In some very
poignant, heart-wrenching scenes David tells
Gillian that he must let her go for Rachel's

sake. At the end of the weekend, as Rachel is
leaving with Paul and Esther, David decides
to go as well.
Yes, OK I'll admit it — this does sort of
sound like a "chick flick." And, ves there
were women leaving the theater teary-eved.
Still, I wouldn't characterize this as a de
pressing movie. There are more than
enough lighthearted and heartwarming
moments, lhis film manages to transcend
the cliche nature of its plot b\ taking a com
mon theme and elevating it to a higher
level. It deals with letting go, embracing lite
and exploring love in all its forms in a re
freshing manner.
