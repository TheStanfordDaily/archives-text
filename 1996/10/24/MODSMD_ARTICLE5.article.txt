# University Press forced to lay off 9
## 
### Kelly E. Young Contributing writer 
University Budget Director Tim
Warner has announced the layoff of
nine employees of Stan ford Univer
sity Press, five of whom are union
members.
The layoff of six full-time, one
half-time and two temporary em
ployees comes at the heels of an an
nouncement Tuesday that an out
side vendor will take over the press
warehouse and order-fulfillment
operations. Warner said the Uni
versity is still in negotiations with
potential vendors.
According to Warner, Universi
ty officials have expressed interest
in transforming the current press
warehouse in Storke Publications
Building into academic facilities, in
part beoiuse of its prime location

near the center of campus,
WTien asked about the move,
Warner said keeping the ware
house on campus is "not cost effec
tive."
However, according to United
Stanford Workers union represen
tative Mcßride, maintaining
its own warehouse — on or off cam
pus — would be more expensive for
Stanford University Press than an
outside company, mainly due to re
location costs.
"When Stanford University
Press put in a bid, they were forced
to bid $100,000 over [the compet
ing institution] because Stanford is
kicking them out of the ware
house," Mcßride said.
The outside vendors have exist
ing facilities available, enabling
them to submit a lower bid, said
Norris Pope, director of Stanford
University Press. The press cur
rently operates with a University
subsidy of $200,000 to $250,000.
However, Mcßride disagreed
with the change.
"This press warehouse is one of
the most efficiently run in the
country," he argued. "They're liter
ally going to ship everything back
East."
Warner said the books are usual

ly printed somewhere in the Mid
west anyway and that only distribu
tion centers would have to relocate.
Referring to the layoffs,
Mcßride said, "It's really outra
geous and inhumane that they're
looking at dollar figures for every
thing."
"It's really 81/2 workers thrown
out on the street. What bothers me
is the callous way the Provost's Of
fice is just laying off these work
ers," he added. "They're saying,
'You've done a good job. Now get
the hell out.' "
Mcßride said the union is plan
ning to act on the announcement.
"I just met with the workers, and

we're really going to fight it."
With only 40 employees, Stan
ford University Press will definitely
feel the impact from the layoffs.
"I'm distressed about the job
losses," Pope said.
University officials have also ex
pressed concern for press employ
ees.
"We're certainly concerned with
the impact on these individuals,"
Warner said. "In addition, we have
a fortunate situation for them.
There's at least a few months for
people to find jobs either on or off
campus."
The layoffs are expected to take
effect sometime in March.
