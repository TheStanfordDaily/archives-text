# Health survey scores improve

Stanford Health Services received better than-av
erage marks in more than 90 areas of h< lit! care, ac
cording to surveys recently released by Cigna and
Health Net.
In addition, a separate Blue Cross California Care
survey ranked the Stanford Clinic 45th out of 117 med
ical groups â€” a significant increase from the clinic's
1994 ranking of 77th out of 81
According to Rachel Deming, quality manager 1
the clinic, the clinic's dramatic improvement in rank
ing is largely due to the "managers who reorganized of
fice operations to improve access and reduce wait
times, while ensuring that the staff is providing first
rate customer service."
In addition, SHS officials attributed the improve
ments to the continuous quality improvement process,
which is practiced by the Service Improvement Pro
gram at the cbnic.
Cigna and Health Net con.;u ted two annual
health-plan membership satisfaction surveys to mea
sure key quality improvement issues overall member
satisfaction and access to care.
The aspects in which Stanford far exceeded other
medical groups in the survey included satisfaction
with physicians, quality and outcome of care, and ac
cess to specialists.
The quality improvement process, two years in the
running, is a "scientific approach to improving man
agement which has been widely adopted into health
care within the last eight years." said SHS spokes
woman Judy Frabotta.
The process measures aspects that need improve
ment, such as telephone response times, and tests
every possible change that might help
According to Frabotta, the process may be "fairly
time-consuming," but it is extremely worthwhile in
that it "empowers the actual workers to make changes
and give them control over the process" rather than
just receiving orders from a super
visor.
The Service Improvement Pro
gram examines major problems
and complaints registered by pa
tient surveys on a regular basis in
order to see where improvements
should be made.
Patient Care Services Director
Linda Cook said the five factors
currently being addressed include
phone response time, appoint
ment availability, timely commu
nication with referring physician,

patient satisfaction and wait time.
In order to reinforce these im
provement techniques and main
tain steady levels of improvement,
"doctors are paid service incen
tives if they do well in executing
improvements in the five cate
gories," said Cook.
"Medical groups are also paid
incentives if they score high in pa
tient satisfaction surveys," she
added. Stanford is due to receive
such an incentive this time
around.
The clinic will continue to use
the results of the improvement
process "to identify opportunities
to improve our service," according
to Deming.
