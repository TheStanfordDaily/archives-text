Simpson civil trial begins
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) — Ronald Goldman "died with his
eyes open," and the last thing he saw as his life ebbed away was his
attacker, O.J. Simpson, a lawyer told a jury yesterday to open Simp
son's civil trial.
In his statement, plaintiff attorney Daniel Petrocelli tried to per
suade the panel to do what a criminal-trial jury didn't — conclude
that Simpson was responsible for the June 1994 knife slayings of his
ex-wife and her friend.
Petrocelli was the first of three plaintiff' attorneys to give opening
statements. The families of the victims are suing Simpson for
unspecified damages.
Petrocelli also promised to present to jurors evidence about three
areas not mentioned in the murder trial: Simpson's statement to
police the day after the killings, the infamous Bronco chase and
details of the note Simpson left in which he sounded suicidal.
Dozens of reporters but only a few supporters and opponents were
at the courthouse yesterday when Simpson arrived, just over a year
after millions watched a jury acquit him of criminal murder charges.
