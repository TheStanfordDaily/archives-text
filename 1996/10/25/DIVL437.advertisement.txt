QUEER MOON ON THE QUAD
Are you a Freshman who is:
• Feeling left out because "Full Moon on the Quad" is an
exclusively heterosexual event?
• Interested in taking part in this Stanford tradition, but
unsure if it provides a supportive environment for
same-sex kisses?
• Tired of being closeted at Stanford?
The LGBCC will provide QUEER SENIORS for QUEER
FROSH. Look for seniors wearing "QUEER" signs and
e tradition. Same time. Same place. And "Same-Sex"!!!
Come to
"Queer Moon on the Quad."
Midnight Saturday, October 26
pucker up for a smooch.
