do now. And that takes planning.
Hv starting to save now, you can take
advantage of lax deferral and give your
money time to compound and grow.

month beginning at age .">o and you can
accumulate oxer $172,10t)* l>y the time
vou reach age b.v Hut wait ten years and
you'll have to budget $2it) each month
