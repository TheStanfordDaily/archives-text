" AN INVITATION TO PRESIDENTS AND FINANCIAL MANAGERS
OF VOLUNTARY STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS
to the new academic year and congratulations on your selection
as an officer in your organization.
I truly appreciate the efforts voluntary student organizations make towards enhancing the
extracurricular experience for our students. As a student leader you have a special role,
and I would like to express my appreciation to you by inviting you to a reception on
Tuesday, October 29 — 4:00-5:30 p.m.
Oak Lounge at Tresidder Union
This will give me and the Student Affairs senior staff the opportunity to meet you and to let you
know what we can do to support your efforts. You will also have the opportunity to get to know
other students who are similarly involved as leaders.
I hope you can attend. If you have another commitment, please feel free to ask another officer
to represent your organization.
Mary McKinney Edmonds
Vice Provost and Dean for Student Affairs
