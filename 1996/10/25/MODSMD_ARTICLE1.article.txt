# Senate updated on language center
## New evaluation forms and UAC also discussed 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Debate focused on changes in foreign language in
struction and the development of a new teaching
evaluation form at yesterday's Faculty Senate meet
ing.
Elizabeth Bernhardt, who came to Stanford last
year to direct the new language center, reported on
changes in the foreign language requirement and
the progress of the center.
Bernhardt said the center was able to test stu
dents' language proficiency before Orientation this
year using an online placement test. Previously, stu
dents were tested by individual language depart
ments during Orientation.
"We were relieved beyond belief to get 30 percent
of our work done before Orientation week," she said.
Bernhardt said the center has also been confront
ed with the problem of trying to increase class time
for discussion.
"We have a dilemma of not being able to expand
infinitely into auricular space," she said.
To ease this problem, the center hopes to move all
foreign language tests online by spring quarter, free
ing up class time for discussion, she said.
Several professors raised concerns about the se
curity of the testing because the exams are closed
book.
"We will have some interesting security measures
built in to take the pressures off students," Bern
hardt said.
Under the new language requirements, incoming
students can meet the requirement through Ad
vanced Placement credit, a sufficient score on an
SAT II language test or University instruction. High
school instruction no longer fulfills the requirement.
Also at the meeting, Psychology Prof. Russell
Fernald, a member of the Senate's Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement, presented re
vised teaching evaluation forms for the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
"We hope to provide more differentiated informa
tion to the faculty," he said.
Senators stressed the importance of the forms,
both for departmental decisions and for their possi
ble use in the ASSU course guide.
"We take this seriously and we hope to convince
students that we expect them to take this seriously,"
said Dean of Humanities and Sciences John Shoven.
In other reports, Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ram6n Saldivar gave a status report on
advising and introduced the new director of under
graduate advising, Lori White, to the senate.
"As director of undergraduate advising, I'd like
advising to be more than something that happens at
Sweet Hall," White said.
White and Saldivar reported on
several new projects the Under
graduate Advising Center com
pleted this summer. The center
revised "Approaching Stanford,"
a guide to advising for incoming
students, and established an ad
vising hotline for students' use

during the summer.
"We'd like to strengthen the ad
vising safety net," White said.
"We'd like to make sure that every
student has quality advising."
Assoc. Psychology Prof. Anne
Fernald, chair of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, presented
the committee's annual report and
updated the senators on the time
table for interdisciplinary program
reviews.
Fernald said eight programs will
be reviewed this year, including the

East Asian Studies Program and the
Science, Technology and Society
Program — two majors whose ter
mination was recommended last
year.
The committee also will be deal
ing with the implementation of the
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity Program and a review of
the Cultures, Ideas and Values
Program this year.
Fernald said a final decision on
these programs will be postponed
until after reviews are completed.
