## Israelis mourn Rabin 
### 
; JERUSALEM (AP) - Mourn
ing the leader who had brought
peace within reach, Israelis wept
and prayed yesterday for Yitzhak
Rabin, marking a year since his
assassination by a Jewish extrem
ist.
"We are still swimming in a sea
of confusion ... looking for a way
out," Rabin's grandson said. "Our
world has changed. We are no
longer the same family, the same
people."
In the Tel Aviv square where
Rabin was gunned down, thou
sands lit memorial candles and
placed flowers on the pavement.
Some embraced. Others hummed
"To Cry for You," a ballad that has
become an anthem of lost hope,
especially for younger Israelis.
The prime minister's assassina
tion occurred Nov. 4, but according
to the Hebrew calendar, the
anniversary fell yesterday. The sor
row briefly covered up the poi
sonous divisions in Israel that have
deepened since the assassination.
But even yesterday's somber cere
monies were not without rancor.
Pointing an accusing finger,
Rabin's son, Yuval, said hard-line
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu must accept some of
the blame for creating the hate
filled political climate that led to
Rabin's murder.
Assassin Yigal Amir says he
shot Rabin to prevent him from
trading land God promised the
Jews for peace with the Arabs.
Netanyahu remained silent
during the graveside memorial at
the request of the Rabin family. In
a speech to parliament, he did not
address accusations that he bears
some responsibility for inciting the
assassination.
