# Perot rejects Dole
## Texan refuses to quit presidential race 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Suddenly hand
ed the campaign spotlight, Ross Perot reject
ed Bob Dole's entreaty to quit the presiden
tial race yesterday and said he was in "to the
bitter end." Republicans and Democrats
labeled Dole's move a desperate gambit.
Perot told reporters he would not discuss
details of his Wednesday meeting with Dole
campaign manager Scott Reed, calling the
session "weird and totally inconsequential."
Perot, in Washington for a National
Press Club speech, delivered a scathing
indictment of President Clinton's ethics
and said Dole and the Republicans also had
abused the campaign finance system and
traded favors for contributions.
"If you want this corruption stopped,
vote for the Reform Party in 1996," Perot
said. Later, he added, "Am I in this for the
long haul? Yes. Do I intend to campaign to
the bitter end? Yes."
Dole authorized Reed's overture to Perot
after a week of internal campaign debate
over whether there was any way to shake
Clinton's lead in national and critical state
polls.
But the GOP nominee was described by
aides as furious that word had leaked of

what was supposed to be a secret mission.
"A drowning man will grab onto any
log," said Texas Reform Party director Bill
Walker. White House press secretary Mike
McCurry, when asked the administration's
reaction, responded, "Mystification."
Campaigning in Florida, Dole admitted
he was frustrated by the polls and said testi
ly: "Wake up America! You're about to do
yourselves an injustice if you vote for Bill
Clinton. .. . If you want to see this country
go down the hill in the next four years, you
vote for Bill Clinton."
But it was Perot who held the cam
paign's center stage for a day, even though
he is mired in single digits in the national
polls four years after finishing third with 19
percent of the vote.
Specifically, Perot said Clinton had
abused his office by changing U.S. trade pol
icy in return for giant, possibly illegal cam
paign contributions from foreign interest,
and by accepting a $20,000 contribution
from a convicted drug dealer who was later
invited to a White House reception.
The $20,000 was returned, as was some
of the other money after being publicized in
news reports.
