# Company to sell genetic test
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Even as evi
dence of discrimination based on individu
als' genetic makeups arises, a company
announced yesterday that it soon will sell
the most comprehensive genetic test yet to
predict breast cancer.
The $2,400 test is the latest entry in a
race to bring to consumers the rapid discov
eries of disease-causing genes, even though
patients are struggling with the ramifica
tions of learning they have such genes when
there's little they can do about it.
A study published in today's edition of
the journal Science found that some 47 per
cent of people asked on health insurance
applications about genetic diseases were
subsequently rejected for coverage.
"This is what genetics is all about right
now, this contrast between rapid and excit
ing scientific advances that carry enormous

promise to alleviate suffering ... and yet
the potential for this information to be used
in ways that injure people," warned Dr.
Francis Collins, chief of the federal Human
Genome Project. Collins is a critic of selling
gene tests before doctors understand them
better.
The Human Genome Project, the gov
ernment's massive effort to identify the
body's 80,000 to 100,000 genes, is trying to
bridge that gap, spending $8 million next
year alone to study the ethical and social
implications of genetics research.
Scientists already have found genes that,
when mutated, can cause everything from
cancer to Alzheimer's disease. And some
laboratories are quietly offering tests to
indicate whether now-healthy Americans
could get those killer illnesses decades in the
future.
