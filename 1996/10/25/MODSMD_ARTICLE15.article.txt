## Simitian is the man 
### 
Local elections usual
ly do not draw a great deal
of attention. They have
neither the glamour nor prestige
associated with the national
races.
But in a year where every extra
Democratic seat won will partly
be looked upon as a backlash

against the "Republican
Revolution," local elec
tions stand out as key bat
tlegrounds for holding
onto the gains made by
the Grand Old Party in
the last election cycle.
Running for the seat of
Santa Clara County

supervisor are Barbara
Koppel and Joe Simitian. Both
carry previous political experi
ence — or baggage, depending on
whether voters are in another
anti-incumbent mood. Only one
candidate will emerge victorious
on the morning of Nov. 6. Joe
Simitian should be that candi
date.
Koppel, a community leader
who carries the endorsement of

many prominent Bay Area
Republicans such as U.S. Rep.
Tom Campbell and former San
Jose Mayor Tom McEnery as well
as law enforcement and firefight
ing organizations, has pledged a
pro-business, pro-family agenda.
However, Simitian's creden
tials and links to Stanford out-

weigh those of Koppel. In
addition to serving as a
public schools attorney and
putting forth a pro-family
platform, Simitian has a
proven track record of pro
tecting the environment.
Additionally, as a current
member of the Palo Alto

City Council, Simitian has
more relevant political experi
ence than his opponent. Finally,
Simitian has made an effort to
get Stanford's vote by appearing
on campus and talking with stu
dents just this last Tuesday in
White Plaza.
More experienced and more
concerned about Stanford — Joe
Simitian deserves your vote on
Nov. 5.
