# Voting for Sand Hill
## 
### 
FOR THE TWO available
seats on the Menlo Park
City Council, The Daily
supports R.P (Dee) Tolles and
Harry Harrison over Charles
Kinney and Paul Collacchi.
Tolles and Harrison support
the Sand Hill Road extension,
while Kinney and Collacchi have
expressed serious concerns over
the project's viability.
Aside from the Sand Hill issue,
Tolles in particular boasts
impressive credentials. He has
resided in Menlo Park for more
than 25 years and has served on
the city council the past four
years, including one as mayor.
What's more, he has volunteered
for numerous community service
projects in the area and has con
sistently instituted effective pro
jects.

The 73-year-old Harrison has
seen the Menlo Park area go
through many eras, first taking
up residence in the early 1950s
and moving there to stay in 1978.
The builder and teacher has
served on the Menlo Park Plan
ning Commission and retires this
month.
The young Collacchi, who
serves as Menlo Park transporta
tion commissioner, terms the Sand
Hill project as the beginning of a
harmful new wave of mega-pro
jects that unnecessarily threaten
the area's tranquility. Kinney also
feels the Sand Hill project exploits
the environment and also seeks an
alternative method.
If you ever want to see Sand
Hill Road connect to El Camino
Real, vote for Tolles and Harri-
