Calling all ethicists: Do absolute moral standards exist?

ROLLIN HU MAKES an important
point in "We cannot fairly judge
other cultures by our morality"
(yesterday's letter to the editor): The pur
pose of examining societies past and pre
sent is not to create a cultural scorecard
by which we can demonstrate the superi
ority of Western values. However, in
doing so, Hu wanders into dangerous
philosophical territory, declaring that
"morality is not absolute."
Hu's defense of relativism rests on the
argument that a morally absolute world
renders political and ethical debate

"meaningless," and such a world would
require others to conform to that stan
dard. That makes as much sense as argu
ing that there cannot be an absolute speed
of light on the basis that it would screw
up your concept of space and time. In
other words, the unsettling implications
of absolutism alone cannot justify one
rejecting it is a possibility.
Let's look at it from the other direc
tion. Assuming a world in which morality
is relative, how does one set standards for
any behavior? Granted, clans / nations/
societies can develop more or less conven

tional rules to govern their own actions,
but what's to stop a subgroup from justi
fying "intolerable" behavior on the
grounds that it's right for them? To pull
out perhaps overused examples, could you
not justify the Holocaust, apartheid or the
Jim Crow laws on the grounds that these
were cultures with "moral principles dif
ferent from our own"? I look at the cir
cumstances and the culture of the time,
and I still say, "No, these are unjustifiably
wrong." Perhaps that is my own irra
tionality showing, wanting a moral basis
for why these practices detest me. But I

believe I am by no means alone in want
ing that.
I freely admit that the road from "there
are moral absolutes" to "My morals are
absolutely right, and therefore you must
do what I say" is well-marked and well
traveled. That's the purpose of political
and ethical debate, and the importance of
higher education: the honest and uncom
promising pursuit of truth and the integri
ty to live by what we discover together.
