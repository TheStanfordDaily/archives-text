# MEChA urges Stanford students, faculty and staff to reject Prop. 209
## 
### 
We are MEChA, Movimiento Estudi
antil Chicano de Aztlan de Stanford, an
organization that for more than 27
years has worked to attain social justice,
equality and political power for our peo
ple. As an organization that works for
human rights and the betterment of our
Raza, we publicly oppose Proposition
209, the so-called California Civil Rights
Initiative on the November ballot.
If passed, this proposition would
eliminate affirmative action in educa
tion, business and the government sec
tor. This proposition aims to eliminate
the gains made by our predecessors over
the past 30 years to attain civil rights
for women and people of color and send
us back to the days when segregation
was a normal part of life.
We are once again facing a battle.
Prop. 209 is one of the most recent
attempts to make people of color and
women invisible in this country. For
centuries, our identity and history have

been ignored in our educational systems
and the traces that remain do not pro
vide much comfort. Policies such as aca
demic tracking and English only cam
paigns continue to push our youth out
of our schools.
Now, the move to eliminate affirma
tive action has become a more blatant
step to dismantling our educational
rights. Opponents of affirmative action
have based their arguments on inaccu
rate and unsubstantiated information.
Opponents argue:
1) Affirmative action requires quotas
and causes reverse discrimination.
2) Affirmative action gives prefer
ences to unqualified individuals.
If opponents bothered to read the
law, they would understand that under
the case California Regents vs. Bakke, it
was ruled that to have quotas for admis
sion to universities is an illegal activity.
Second, affirmative action policy does
not mandate that unqualified individu
als be given preference but rather that
employers and educational institutions
enact "narrowly tailored and highly reg
ulated" efforts to allow "qualified"
women and minorities to "compete
equally for jobs, education and promo
tional opportunities."

Prop. 209 attempts to erase our
American history. Prop. 209 attempts
to deny that people of color have been
discriminated against in this country
for as long as we have been here. As
MEChA, we will continue to fight
against attacks on our community,
such as Prop. 209, by continuing to
increase our representation in govern
ment through voter registration and
creating a proactive platform to address
Latino issues across the nation. We will
continue to develop and use the neces
sary strategies to fight for the future of
our education and the future of our
people. We stand firm on the principles
of our founding document which states,
"We will move against those forces
which have denied us freedom of
expression and human dignity."
MEChA at Stanford denounces Prop.
209 and pledges to work in our commu
nities, with our communities and for
our communities in an effort to defeat
the so-called California Civil Rights Ini
tiative. We strongly urge our fellow stu
dents, faculty and staff to VOTE NO on
Prop. 209.
