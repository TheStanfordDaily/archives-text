# New parking policy punishes volunteers
## 
### 
As a volunteer at the Bechtel Inter
national Center, I have had the oppor
tunity to assist foreign students in
improving their English language skills
for more than 10 years.
The procedure of issuing parking
permits for several months has been
very convenient for us. Recently I was
told that this procedure had been
changed by the Transportation Office
of the University. We now must park
first, go to the international center to
obtain a daily permit, then return to
our cars to display the permit (trust
ing that we have not already received a
parking ticket).
I sincerely hope that some consider
ation to change this new policy will be
pursued; the volunteers travel many
miles to offer their services and should
be provided with a more reasonable
approach to parking permits, especially
since we are usually on campus no
more than a couple of hours.
