In addition to juggling difficult course
loads and making it through White Plaza
alive at lunch time, Stanford students have
been issued a new challenge. Their mission,
should they choose to accept it: Stump new
Undergraduate Advising Director Lori
White.
According to White, "I'm a big college
sports fan. I can name just about every Di

vision I college mascot, so if students want
to stump me, they can try."
White's knowledge of college mascots
comes from first-hand experience. While
earning a doctorate in education policy
from Stanford, she served as head cheer
leading coach for three years.
White said the job was partly an exten
sion of days spent as a cheerleader while

lish and psychology from "that
school across the Bay." Being a
coach also served as a way to keep in
touch with undergraduates while
working on her dissertation on the
experiences of black students in
higher education.
Since her days as a cheerlead
ing coach, White has held posi
tions at UC-Irvine and, most re
cently, Georgetown University.
At Georgetown, White was the di
rector of student programs, but
she said she was always interested
in a position that would allow her
to be more closely connected with
the academic side of university
life.
White's position as director of

undergraduate advising at Stan
ford includes a teaching post in the
School of Education.
"My job at Stanford is one of
those rare opportunities for some
one to combine both administra
tion and teaching," she said.
"That's really not that common,
where it's actually built into the job
description."
White's interest in academic ad
vising has roots in her own under
graduate experience.
"I was one of those students who
went through college and got a de
gree without making one real con
nection with a professor," she said.
"As I look back, that's the one thing
I regret. I hope to somehow make a
difference for students who were
like me."
One way in which White hopes
to make a difference is by using un
dergraduate advising to emphasize

opportunities for students to "con
nect" with faculty through discus
sion and research.
"The bottom line is that whatev
er one does with advising it has to
be focused both on the needs of stu
dents and the interests of faculty,"
she said.
"If students are willing to take
some initiative, the can have some
incredible experiences here," she
added.
Besides testing White's afore
mentioned prowess in college mas
cot trivia, students dropping by the
center can trade notes with her on
favorite television shows.
"I don't have any free time,"
White joked. "But I have gotten
hooked on more TV shows than I'd
care to admit." White listed "Mel
rose Place," "Frasier," "Party of
Five" and "Seinfeld" as shows she
catches regularly.
