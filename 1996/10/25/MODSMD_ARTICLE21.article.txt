## Missing old folks and idiots 
### 
STANFORD TAKES DIVERSITY
seriously, as it should. I have
crashed bikes with bisexuals, flat
tened vegans on the intramural grid
iron and been outdone in class by Weez
er fans. Say it ain't so. In spite of this
variety, there are still two kinds of peo
ple that thrive in the outside world, but
that you'll never encounter at Stanford.
I am thinking of — you guessed it —
idiots and really, really old folks.
No idiots at Stanford, you say?
You're crazy — in fact, you're an idiot,
column boy. But no one at Stanford
could be considered an idiot by any
stretch. The word idiot usually refers to
a very stupid person (how I use it here),
but idiot once was a technical term for a
person with a mental age no greater
than 3 years. Imbeciles had mental ages
between 3 and 7 years; morons ran
between 8 and 12. My grandfather
taught me all of this when I was 9. "Is it
really true, Grandpa?" I asked him. "Of
course it is," he smiled, "you little
idiot."
Idiots can't bumble their way into
Stanford because of the hurdles posed
by the application process. An idiot
couldn't score well on the SAT. Actual
ly, an idiot probably could. With the
right combination of electric shocks and
bananas, Stanford psychologists could
probably train Bubbles the chimp to
pull a 1390.
What about the personal statement?
Idiots are especially suited for personal

statements, since personal statements
are designed to force us to write clearly
and simply about complex topics. "Pin
point the nature of human existence,"
they say, "in 65 words or less." Idiots
excel in situations like this because they
are simple people who think simply and
clearly. They write something like this:
"I eat, sleep and hit Boopsie in the
mouth. I hit him in the mouth again. It
is good. I wipe my hand on my face. It is
wet and good. The sun is bright and
clear and I wipe my nose. It is dirty and
I wipe it on my pants. Now it is clean
and it is good and I am happy." "Good
God," say the admissions officers.
"We've found the next Hemingway."
If idiots can beat the SAT and the
personal statement, all that remains
are extracurricular activities. Idiots are
great at activities; they are drawn to
them like bugs to zappers. Imagine For
rest Gump's college application: "Ran
across the country. Met the President
and almost pissed in my pants. Played
ping-pong against people from China.
Operated Bubba Gump Shrimp Compa
ny." That is exactly the kind of weird
stuff that admissions officers love to
read. Gump would be a shoo-in, possibly
a President's Scholar.
So maybe there are idiots here. But
there are definitely not any really old
people. Have you ever seen a truly
elderly person here, huffing through
the Quad with a walker? I think that
when professors reach a certain age,

they are taken to the Cardinal Cogener
ation Facility and "reassimilated into
the continuum." Though officials found
rats after the power outage earlier this
month, they also found dentures, a
toupee and melted tweed.
Stanford is not a friendly place for
seniors. I found this out the other week
while escorting the Librarian of
Congress, Daniel Boorstin, and his wife
around campus. They are both about
80. She had injured herself and couldn't
walk far, so I picked them up in a golf
cart and drove places. She commented
on the large size of our campus, and I
reflected on this until we came to some
bollards. It was a tight fit — maybe an
inch on either side of the cart — and I
resolved to thread the two bollards in
one, mighty burst. I gunned the cart to
its maximum 15 miles per hour and ran
straight into the right bollard — miss
ing Scylla, but kicking Charybdis right
in the ass.
It was quite a bang. I didn't look back
for a while. What was I going to say,
really? "Welcome to Stanford, Dr.
Boorstin. Sorry I killed your wife." But
it wasn't so bad. She actually laughed.
Then she spit out a few teeth.

James is just kidding. She didn't really
laugh.
