## Mia Sara Bruch Stanford's embrace of corporate values risks loss of integrity 
### 
Earlier this
month, Provost
Condoleezza Rice
announced that Stan
ford may end its tradi
tional policy of subsidiz
ing up to half of the col
lege tuition of the chil
dren of long-standing
staff and faculty mem-

bers. The re-evaluation of these benefits,
Rice explained, was prompted by the end
of partial federal support for the discount
ed tuition. Rice pointed out that this cut in
funding demanded that Stanford examine
the budgetary burden imposed by the
tuition subsidies. In this light, the move
can be seen as an unfortunate but neces
sary measure in an age of financial auster
ity for the University.
But Rice also offered a more disturbing
explanation for the possible termination of
benefits: Tuition discounts for college
bound children may not provide an effec
tive enough recruitment tool to attract
younger staff members to justify continu

ing to offer them as part of the University's
benefits package.
If the only value of the tuition discounts
was their efficacy in recruiting top staff to
the University, this sort of justification for
ending the benefits might be acceptable.
But the commitment of the University to
assist in the education of the children of its
employees is part of a larger vision of a uni
versity as a unique institution, guided by
values distinct from those of the expedien
cy of the free market.
The subsidy for staff members is not
merely an attempt to make employment at
Stanford attractive to prospective employ
ees and to efficiently recruit them. It
embodies the idea that Stanford's employ
ees are part of a community which cares
for its members rather than just pays
them.
Unfortunately, the provost's statement
is not an isolated one. The notion that a
university should be operated on principles
other than those of the bottom line has
been eroded over the past decade. Facing
declining enrollments, a downturn in eco

nomic growth and massive cuts in tradi
tional federal funding, universities across
the country have found themselves in a
position similar to that of for-profit corpo
rations, taking strategic steps to maintain
fiscal health.
This is a necessity of the economic
times. But Rice's comment reflects a grow
ing reliance on the rhetoric and ethics of
the free market to justify University deci
sions. Last year, the University announced
the closure of the world-renowned Food
Research Institute and the termination of
the East Asian Studies Program, moves
which were primarily justified on the
grounds of academic and economic efficien
cy. The intellectual value of the programs
did not appear to be a factor in the admin
istration's decision.
This sense that Stanford is being gov
erned with the rules and rhetoric of the
corporate world was confirmed in Septem
ber, when the University turned over man
agement of the campus Faculty Club to a
private company, Redwood City-based
TDS. According to the Stanford Report,

the transfer resulted in the layoff of 76
employees, whose prospects for rehire
under TDS's management are unclear.
The explanation for the decision was that
the Faculty Club was not making money.
And just this week, the University
announced the transfer of the distribution
duties of the Stanford University Press to
an outside vendor on the grounds of "cost
efficiency," resulting in the layoff of 20 per
cent of the Press' employees.
Is the purpose of a campus faculty club
or a university press to turn a profit?
Hardly. Could an improvement of their
finances have been accomplished by using
resources within the University? Certain
ly. These moves bear a disturbing resem
blance to out-sourcing, a procedure prac
ticed by many corporations. By transfer
ring control of certain components of its
work force to outside companies, Stanford
can avoid offering University pay and ben
efits.
The restructuring of the Faculty Club
and the University Press under the direc
tion of off-campus, for-profit corporations

reveals an increasing disregard for the dis
tinct character and obligations of a univer
sity. This use of the logic of the corporation
is an abdication of the vision of the Univer
sity as a unique institution which exists for
higher purposes than those of economic
performance and profit.
These choices are not merely details in
the University's Annual Report. They
determine the quality of the relationship
between the University and its con
stituents, both those who it employs and
those who it educates.
It is obvious that Rice and other top
administrators have been given a very dif
ficult job — to pave Stanford's transition
from an age of generous government sup
port to an age of what might be permanent
financial stringency. But it is not only pos
sible but absolutely necessary to complete
this transition without compromising the
integrity of the University as a community,
rather then recreating it as a business.
