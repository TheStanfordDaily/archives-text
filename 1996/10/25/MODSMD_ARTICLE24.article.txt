# Festival celebrates Stéphane Mallarmé
## Weekend events highlight French poet 
### Kori Wen 
The French and Italian Depart
ment will host a festival this week
end to celebrate 19th-century
French poet and essayist
Stephane Mallarme.
Free and open to the public, the
three-day event will highlight Mal
larme's contributions to modern
thought, including his influence
on music, dance, theater and the
visual arts.
The conference will feature lec
tures by Stanford professors and
outside speakers, as well as a
chamber concert of Mallarme's
poems, set to the music of Claude
Debussy and Maurice Ravel. A
stage reading of Mallarme's
"Herodiade" will conclude the
weekend.
Michel Deguy — a noted
French poet who is considered by
some to be the contemporary Mal
larme — will lecture on "Mallarme
and Later French Poets."
In addition to the presenta
tions, a Mallarmeana exhibit will
be on display this week in the
lobby of Green Library.
Born in Paris in 1842, Mallar
me taught English at provincial
schools while writing several
books on the resonance of English
words.
Close friends with the artist
Edouard Manet, Mallarme was in
trigued and influenced in his liter
ary style by impressionist art. He
sought to transform the language
and sounds of his words into an ex
pression of the poetry to better re
semble music.
"He brought in a harmonic di
mension, and the effect was that
each word was like a star in a con
stellation. It related to the many
words around it in a globular

rather than linear way," said festi
val organizer Robert Greer Cohn,
an emeritus professor of French
and Italian who has dedicated his
career to the study of Mallarme.
Initially regarded as the "mas
ter of obscurity" by critics of his
time who considered his work
"convoluted and eccentric," Mal
larme rose in later generations to
be regarded as the master of sym
bolism.
"Symbolists historically had
the lyric power of late Romantics,
and Mallarm6 combined that with
a strong classic element," Cohn
said. "Only a handful of geniuses,
like Dante and Goethe, had that
capacity."
"The critic George Steiner
wrote that Mallarme was the piv
otal figure of modern literature
and thought," Cohn added. "He
said his impact was greater than
World Wars I and II combined."
According to Cohn, "all of the
major French critics — Sartre,
Barthes, Foucait — assigned him
that same position. The period in
which he lived could easily be
called the Mallarme century."
Mallarme was equally esteemed
by Americans. Such writers as
T.S. Eliot considered him respon
sible for purifying the way people
talked about experience, according
to Assoc. French and Italian Prof.
Robert Harrison, another speaker
at the festival.
In his own words, Mallarme
sought to "purify the words of the
tribe," yet in the process, his work
escaped easy interpretation, Har
rison said.
According to Harrison, Mallar
me continues to be "one of the
most difficult poets to read" but at
the same time "the purest poet of
the modern era."
