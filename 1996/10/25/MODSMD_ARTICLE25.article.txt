## The challenge Men face No.2 UCLA Sunday
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
Stanford men's water polo
players have their work cut out
for them this weekend, as they
face the defending NCAA cham
pion and No. 2 UCLA Bruins at
noon Sunday.
Though the contest is not a
Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation game, it represents just
the second opportunity the No.
3 Cardinal has had to play a
team ranked in the top two.
One edge that Stanford has
going into the game is the fact
that UCLA faces top-ranked
USC tomorrow, while the only
action for the Cardinal tomor
row is a scrimmage with the
alumni at 10:30 a.m.
This year's squad has also
proven to play remarkably well
the second time it faces a given
opponent, and Sunday marks its
second matchup with the Bru

In its first meeting with
UCLA, the Cardinal took awhile
to adjust, allowing four goals by
the Bruins in the first quarter.
Stanford played competitively
throughout the next three quar

the Bruins still came out ahead

with a total of nine goals.
So despite the loss, the play
ers are confident that they can
play with the Bruins and look
forward to the rematch as a
chance to climb into the top two.
Indeed, that is the next logi
cal step for the Cardinal, as it
solidified its No. 3 ranking this
past Saturday with a 10-9 victo
ry over No. 4 California.
Sunday's contest marks the
beginning of a grueling three
week stretch as the Cardinal
will face USC and UCLA no less
than four times.
"This is definitely the hard
part of our season," Dettamanti
said. "We have to be consistent
and continue to play well."
The Cardinal team will cer
tainly need to play its best to
beat the Bruins, a very balanced
and talented team.
Graduating just two players
from last year's NCAA Champi
onship squad, the Bruins have
the 1995 NCAA MVP, goalie
Matt Swanson, and Olympic
team alternate Jim Toring.
Another unique challenge
which UCLA represents is that
while the team has its stars, it
also has demonstrated the abili

against Cal last weekend. Tomorrow, the water polo team hosts
its alumni team, and on Sunday it will play No. 2 UCLA.
