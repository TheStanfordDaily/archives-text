# It only gets tougher for football
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Stanford football has hit the midpoint of its sea
son with a subpar record, and the bad news is that
it only gets more difficult from here.
The challenge begins immediately as fourth
ranked Arizona State pays a visit to Stanford Sta
dium tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. The Sun Devils (7-0,
4-0 Pacific 10 Conference) splashed onto the
national scene with a 19-0 drubbing of back-to
back national champion Nebraska in September
and are currently the front-runner in the race for
the Rose Bowl.
Despite the Sun Devils' success and the Cardi
nal's own frustrations, head coach Tyrone Willing
ham remains upbeat, even after last weekend's loss
at Oregon State.
"I can be optimistic because we have a football
team that still has a desire to win," Willingham
said. "The other thing is that we have another ball
game this weekend. It's not an easy task to turn
around, but that's how we are going to approach it.
"Any time you suffer, it's difficult to get up and
be happy about yourself. But it's an opportunity to
get up and redeem ourselves. And not only does the
coaching staff have pride, but so do our young
men."
More than anything, the Sun Devils virtually
cannot find a way to not win. They trailed UCLA
28-7 before storming back to win 42-34. Last week
against USC in a game with huge Rose Bowl impli
cations, Arizona State erased a 14-0 deficit to earn
a 48-35 victory in double overtime.
The Sun Devils owe most of that success to one
person, Heisman trophy candidate Jake Plummer.
The senior Sun Devil quarterback has taken the
cliche "refuse to lose" to a whole new level. Plum
mer accounted for five touchdowns in the come
back against UCLA with three throws, one run and
a catch. For the season, Plummer is 127 for 220 for
1,728 yards, 18 touchdowns and just six intercep
tions.
"There is not a single player in college football
who means more to his team than Jake Plummer,"
