# It only gets tougher for football
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Stanford football has hit the midpoint of its sea
son with a subpar record, and the bad news is that
it only gets more difficult from here.
The challenge begins immediately as fourth
ranked Arizona State pays a visit to Stanford Sta
dium tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. The Sun Devils (7-0,
4-0 Pacific 10 Conference) splashed onto the
national scene with a 19-0 drubbing of back-to
back national champion Nebraska in September
and are currently the front-runner in the race for
the Rose Bowl.
Despite the Sun Devils' success and the Cardi
nal's own frustrations, head coach Tyrone Willing
ham remains upbeat, even after last weekend's loss
at Oregon State.
"I can be optimistic because we have a football
team that still has a desire to win," Willingham
said. "The other thing is that we have another ball
game this weekend. It's not an easy task to turn
around, but that's how we are going to approach it.
"Any time you suffer, it's difficult to get up and
be happy about yourself. But it's an opportunity to
get up and redeem ourselves. And not only does the
coaching staff have pride, but so do our young
men."
More than anything, the Sun Devils virtually
cannot find a way to not win. They trailed UCLA
28-7 before storming back to win 42-34. Last week
against USC in a game with huge Rose Bowl impli
cations, Arizona State erased a 14-0 deficit to earn
a 48-35 victory in double overtime.
The Sun Devils owe most of that success to one
person, Heisman trophy candidate Jake Plummer.
The senior Sun Devil quarterback has taken the
cliche "refuse to lose" to a whole new level. Plum
mer accounted for five touchdowns in the come
back against UCLA with three throws, one run and
a catch. For the season, Plummer is 127 for 220 for
1,728 yards, 18 touchdowns and just six intercep
tions.
"There is not a single player in college football
who means more to his team than Jake Plummer,"

runs with the ball In a game against San Jose State in September. The Cardinal will host
Arizona State tomorrow.
Arizona State head coach Bruce
Snyder said of the quarterback
who has started 35 straight games
since his freshman year. "He's a
heck of a football player. His team
loves him. He loves his team. He's
what it's all about in my opinion."
Without question, the Cardinal
defense will have its hands full
with Plummer, who is probably
more dangerous under pressure
than in the pocket.
"He's a great improviser," said
senior Stanford defensive end
Bryan Werner. "He just makes
things happen. We have to keep
him contained so he doesn't have
a chance to make those big plays."
Plummer has been attracting
Pac-10 attention for years now,
throwing to star wide receiver
Keith Poole. But the Sun Devil
attack is balanced this season. The
Arizona State running game is the
most productive attack in the con
ference, led by three backs who
rank in the conference's top 10 in
all purpose yardage, Terry Battle,
Michael Martin and J.R. Redmond.
Martin is out with a neck
injury, but Battle has taken up the
slack. Last week against USC,
Battle, who is ninth in the confer
ence in rushing, reached the end
zone four times for the Sun Dev
ils.
After solid performances
against the run early in the sea
son, the Stanford defense has
been susceptible as of late. Wash
ington's Corey Dillon gained 173
yards against the Cardinal and
Oregon State rushed the ball 57
times for 255 total yards on the
ground.
"We have to tackle," Werner
said. "We had people there but
didn't make the tackles. Everyone
needs to look in the mirror and
ask themselves what they can do
against ASU that they didn't
against Oregon State."
Willingham emphasizes that
those statistics are still a matter of
circumstance.
"A great deal of that has to do
with who you are playing," Will
ingham said. "If you run the ball
50 times like Oregon State did,
something good is going to happen
eventually."
On the other side of the ball,
the Cardinal has still not found
the answers to a productivity
problem that is putting up just 13

points on the board per game.
"That's the million dollar
coach's question," Willingham
said. After Oregon "we felt like we
really made strides and were get
ting in gear. Then all of a sudden
it's gone. I don't have an answer
for that. I am concerned but at the
same time I have confidence that
we can produce."
The answers will be difficult to
find against the Sun Devil
defense, however. After running
the ball 37 times for just 29 yards
last week, the Stanford ground
game faces the Pac-10's best rush
defense.
For the Cardinal passing game
to be successful, it will have to give
quarterback Chad Hutchinson
some more protection after invit
ing the Beaver defense into the

backfield for 11 sacks. The Stan
ford offensive line will have to con
tend with emerging superstar
Derrick Rodgers. The Sun Devil
rush end has five sacks and 15
tackles for loss.
"Derrick Rodgers is a prob
lem," Willingham said. "They
have some other problems as
well."
Despite their underdog status
and a bitter loss to the Beavers,
the Cardinal team members are
remaining optimistic along with
their coach.
"As a team, we are all kind of
frustrated," said sophomore free
safety Tim Smith. "But that is
part of football. We have to bounce
back. We know we have the talent
to do it."
Stanford is drawing positives
from last season's 30-28 win at
Sun Devil Stadium. Much of Ari
zona State's roster is the same.
"I think it does Igive us confi
dence]," Willingham said. "As this
game gets written up, that is
something that will be missed. We
went down there and won in their
stadium."
