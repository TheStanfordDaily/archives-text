The third-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team (16-1,
9-0 Pacific 10 Conference) takes
its 32-match conference win
ning streak to the state of Wash
ington this weekend. The Cardi
nal will face No. 14 Washington
(17-3, 7-2 Pac-10) tonight at 7
p.m. before traveling to 13th
ranked Washington State (15-4,
6-3) Sunday at noon.
This marks the second meet
ing between Stanford and Wash
ington, a team that has some
what surprisingly inched its way
up to second place in the Pac-10.
The Card, currently in sole pos
session of first place, will try to
extend its conference lead and
seal the lid on its third consecu
tive Pac-10 title.
"We expect as tough a week
end as we have had all year,"
Stanford coach Don Shaw said.
"The Pac-10 race is getting a lit
tle hotter now."
Washington visited Stanford
earlier in the year, losing to the
Card in three games. Stanford
played well, defeating the

Huskies with good passing and
strong hitting from outside hit
ters Kristin Folkl, a junior, and
Kerri Walsh, a freshman.
"I'm sure they will be spend
ing time thinking about Kerri
Walsh," Shaw said. "Last time
they came in more concerned
about Kristin, but this time I
think they are going to pay
equal attention to Kerri."
Both the Cardinal and the
Huskies enter Friday's contest
on a roll. Stanford defeated both
USC (15-6, 11-15, 16-14, 15-6)
and UCLA (10-15, 15-8, 15-12,
15-7) last weekend, while Wash
ington disposed of Arizona State
(15-5, 15-9, 15-4) and Arizona
(8-15, 16-14, 15-7, 17-15).
The Huskies lead the confer
ence in blocking and have
demonstrated that they have
the ability to seriously contend
for the Pac-10 crown.
"Clearly, to beat Stanford, we
have to have all our pistons fir
ing," Washington coach Bill
Neville said. "I think we are
capable of it, but it will require a
superb effort. I guess that is
what makes for great matches."
The Card will then travel to
Washington State for a noon
match Sunday against a Cougar
team that is also playing well.
Washington State handily
defeated both Arizona (12-15,
15-6, 15-7, 15-7) and Arizona
State (15-6, 15-3, 15-7) last
weekend.
The Cougars bring to the
match a diversified offense that
will attempt to keep the Cardi
nal defense off-balance. Howev
er, if Washington State wants to
win, it will have to find a solu
tion to the Stanford hitting
attack.
The last time these two teams
met, the Cardinal pounded the
Cougars for 59 kills en route to a
three-game win. Walsh led the
team with 17 kills, while Folkl
added 14.
Walsh earned her first colle

giate national honor this week
when she was named the AVCA
National Player of the Week.
Durinr that span Walsh record
ed 46 kills while hitting .422 to
go along with 12 blocks and
seven assists. She also received
conference player of the week
honors.
"I love playing for the away
crowd," Walsh said. "It pumps
me up to hear them yell at us a
little bit."
Both the Cougars and the
Huskies hope that Stanford will
play a little flat this weekend,
perhaps giving the
schools a chance to prove victori
ous.
"Maybe they are getting
bored of winning," Neville said.
"That is not what I expect, but
that is what I hope."
Shaw disagrees.
"I don't think we are getting
bored of winning," Shaw said.
"But as Washington is probably
noticing as well, it is hard to
maintain that same effort night
after night."
