# Women's soccer needs Pac-10 wins
## Kickers host Washington squads in two doubleheader finales 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Nobody ever likes to think of a game
as a must-win situation, but the
women's soccer team is starting to have
to.
At this point in the season, this week
end's bouts against the Washington
State Cougars and the Washington
Huskies are as close to must-win games
as a team is going to have.
With a record of 7-7, including two
losses to teams from its own region
(Santa Clara and San Diego), it is look
ing very improbable that unranked
Stanford will receive an invitation to the
NCAA tourney if it fails to win the Pacif
ic 10 Conference.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, this is
the first year that the Pac-10 receives an
automatic bid to the tournament, and
the team is 2-0 in the conference thus
far, posting wins over Arizona and Ore
gon State. At 2-0, the Cardinal is the
only undefeated team in Pac-10 play.
Stanford is also the defending league
champion, having compiled a perfect 7-0
mark against conference foes a year ago.
Hut there are a number of quality
teams in the conference and winning it
is far from automatic. No. 17 UCLA is 3-
1 in the Pac-10 after a loss to USC
Wednesday, and the Cardinal needs to
win all five of its remaining conference
games to guarantee itself a spot in the
postseason.
"The league is really our ticket now,"
said coach Steve Swanson. "The Pac-10

having an automatic bid gives us new
life. In many ways, it's like we have a
whole new season ahead of us, and we
need to take advantage of it."
The two home games against confer
ence rivals Washington and Washington
State are crucial.
"These games are key," said senior
forward Erin Martin. "If we don't win
the Pac-10, I don't know if we'll make
the playoffs. I'd definitely say that these
are must wins for us."
For the Card to fall short of the post
season would be shocking. Stanford
came into the season ranked No. 6 and
has made it to college soccer's biggest
event every year of the '90s.
"One of our goals every year is to win
the Pac-10 and make it to the tourna
ment," said senior co-captain Emily
Burt. "We need to come out strong in
these games and start finishing our
opportunities if we're going to win. And
we have to win."
Today at 2 p.m. on Maloney Field is
the scheduled kickoff for the Washing
ton State game, following the men's
game against UC-Irvine at noon. Stan
ford has beaten the Cougars two years
in a row, and holds a 4-1 lifetime edge
over its league rivals from the North.
The Cougars are 5-5-1 so far this season
with a 1-2 record in the Pac-10.
Although the Cardinal can't afford to
look past the Cougars, it will host a
much more difficult opponent Sunday at
2 p.m. in game two of a doubleheader.
The Huskies are, as their 8-5 record
suggests, a powerful soccer program.

Four of their losses came to teams which
were ranked in the top 20 at the time.
Washington is 2-1 in the Pac-10 (its only
loss came at the hands of UCLA) and
has been a tournament team the past
two years.
Stanford has owned the Huskies in
the past, beating them five of the six
times they faced each other and tying
the other one. Last year, the Cardinal
pounded Washington 3-1 in Seattle.
Swanson's squad will need more than
history to knock off the Huskies on Sun
day, however. Washington needs to win
as badly as the Cardinal does, so expect
an emotional and hard-fought game
from both sides.
"Both teams will be giving it all they
have," Burt said. "I expect it to be a good
soccer game, and hopefully, we can come
away with it."
So far, the year has been a disap
pointing one for Stanford. Not since
1988 has a Cardinal team lost more than
four games in one season, and with a
playoff berth in question, it is impera
tive that Stanford step up its play in the
coming games.
"We need to come out and establish
ourselves right away," Swanson said.
"We have to impose our style of play on
our opponents instead of adjusting to
their game. And we have to start get
ting more on the offensive, score a few
goals.
"The team has responded well (to the
recent losses). We're very resilient, and I
think we're ready and excited to get
back to Pac-10 games. "
