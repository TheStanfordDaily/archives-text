He's making his bid for
the Oval Office on the
promise of liberating
Americans from the chains of
government. Today, however,
Libertarian Party presidential
candidate Harry Browne is mak
ing a run for the highest-rank
ing office in the prognosticating
world by joining me in picking
the NCAA football games of the
week. You think he hates orga
nizational government now —
just wait until he finds out how
one feels being mocked by The
Oppressive System when one's
football predictions turn out to
be just a little off the mark.
Arizona State at Stanford
Just to clear the air - no. I'm
not voting for Ralph Nader. But
I am completely baffled by the
play of the Stanford football
squad. Now dubbed the Hester

Prynnes of the athletic world,
members of the Cardinal squad
bear the ignominious scarlet let
ters "OSU" on their bulging
chests. After losing to the
Beavers (who hadn't won a foot
ball game since the post-classic
period of the ancient Mayan civ
ilization), Stanford is reeling.
The Cardinal offense scores
fewer points per game than the
Atlanta Braves, and its defense
would have to hold the opponent
to negative points to give Stan
ford a shot at many games.
This weekend's contest is a
good example Most rational
people would assume that the
Sun Devils are going to beat the
living daylights out of the deflat •
ed Cardinal. And I am a rational
person. But I also know that
Stanford has a lot to gain tomor

row and nothing to lose, so I don't
think Stanford will be shellacked.
I'd say "beaten soundly" will be
a more appropriate description.
No amount of emotion and
energy will fire up the Stanford
offensive machine enough to cross
the goal line more than three
times. That machine, once dubbed
the Sony Play Station of college
football offenses, now looks like the
Commodore 5200 of the football
world. And against the conference
leading Sun Devils, the Cardinal
will have to score 28 points or more
to emerge victorious.
I'd put money on Louis Far
rakhan casting his ballot for David
Duke in the Louisiana gubernato
rial election before I'd bet on those
28 points showing up tomorrow.
Harry, playing the generic
politician's role, is attempting to
please all and insult none. Thus, he
has picked Stanford by a huge mar
gin. While his politics may be
crackpot, Mr. Browne is no sports
loony — he divulged to me (on the
record, for all you journalistic
police) that the true outcome "will
probably be reversed."

UClj\ at California
Both Harry and I are going with
the underdog in this matchup. I
like the Bruins only because I don't
like Cal. I have maintained my dis
dain for the overrated granolas
from across the Bay for more than
a month, and I'm not about to
abandon my gut feeling now. Now
that the silly undefeated record has
been flushed down the toilet, we
can find out exactly what this Cal
squad is made of. My hypothesis:
zilch. Pretty boy Steve Mariucci
has kept the team together with
his good looks, but the losses are
going to start piling up now.
Harry is also picking against
Cal; he probably doesn't like that
liberal university's obsession with
big government. As far as I'm con
cerned, it would take a federal reg
ulation banning a UCLA victory to
prevent Cal from dropping its sec
ond straight contest.

Washington at Oregon
Poor Rashaan Shehee. He
injured his foot last month and has

been Rashaan Peewee ever since.
What was the real cause of the
injury? Originally, the team said
Shehee hurt his foot during prac
tice. But last week officials admit
ted that the unfortunate incident
actually occurred during a party,
when Shehee jumped from a bal
cony after shots were fired in the
building. It's good to know com
mon sense is not a prerequisite for
becoming a college football star.
Fortunately for the Huskies,
there will be no bullets to dodge on
the field this weekend. The Ducks
have been firing blanks all season,
and if Oregon does get a shot off it
will be as harmless as a squirt from
a water gun. Not only is the lame
Ducks' offense sporadic, the
defense exists only in the minds of
Oregon coaches. Whether or not
Rashaan plays (Shehee or not She
hee, that is the question), Washing
ton should score more on Saturday
than Wilt Chamberlain claims to
have over his entire career.

USC at Washington State
Harry admits that he's not a
huge college football fan, but he
does like USC as an institution of
higher learning. That figures, see
ing how USC is private and isn't
run by what Harry thinks is our
slimy, dirty, corrupt government. I
guess every successful prognostica
tor should know that if you cannot
predict the outcome of a game
based on your knowledge of the
sport, your knowledge of the poli
tics of each institution is always
the second-best alternative.
I'm going to try to use my
knowledge of the sport to see the
future. A look into my cloudy,
smeared crystal ball produces a few
images: a cold, cloudy Saturday
afternoon in Pullman, a Washing
ton State squad that has won five
of six games, and a dejected, reeling
Trojan team. Together, these
images paint, a clear picture. Not
only will the Trojans not be stop
ping to smell the roses come Jan
uary, their third loss in a row may
leave them begging for an invita
tion to the cookie bowl.
