He's making his bid for
the Oval Office on the
promise of liberating
Americans from the chains of
government. Today, however,
Libertarian Party presidential
candidate Harry Browne is mak
ing a run for the highest-rank
ing office in the prognosticating
world by joining me in picking
the NCAA football games of the
week. You think he hates orga
nizational government now —
just wait until he finds out how
one feels being mocked by The
Oppressive System when one's
football predictions turn out to
be just a little off the mark.
Arizona State at Stanford
Just to clear the air - no. I'm
not voting for Ralph Nader. But
I am completely baffled by the
play of the Stanford football
squad. Now dubbed the Hester

Prynnes of the athletic world,
members of the Cardinal squad
bear the ignominious scarlet let
ters "OSU" on their bulging
chests. After losing to the
Beavers (who hadn't won a foot
ball game since the post-classic
period of the ancient Mayan civ
ilization), Stanford is reeling.
The Cardinal offense scores
fewer points per game than the
Atlanta Braves, and its defense
would have to hold the opponent
to negative points to give Stan
ford a shot at many games.
This weekend's contest is a
good example Most rational
people would assume that the
Sun Devils are going to beat the
living daylights out of the deflat •
ed Cardinal. And I am a rational
person. But I also know that
Stanford has a lot to gain tomor
