# Golf teams hope to improve records
## Men have a strong chance for success at Lexus Tourney 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
With the experience of three dif
ficult opening tournaments under
its belt, the Cardinal men's golf
team is anxious for a chance to
prove its worth today and tomor
row at the Lexus Invitational in
Fresno, Calif. Although the squad
has struggled in previous tourna
ments this year, with stiff competi
tion and a rookie-laden team, the
Lexus tournament will provide a
more moderate field for Stanford.
"The field (at Fresno) isn't as
strong as the first three weeks,"
said senior golfer Conrad Ray. "It's
tough sometimes to compete with
the big guns right out of the gate."
Actually, since the beginning of
the season the Stanford golf squad
has had to contend with champi
onship-caliber teams.
"These first three tournaments
we were in with the top 15 teams in
the country, which was way out of
our league," said coach Wally
Goodwin. "For the past three years
we've been expected to win every
thing. Although we hope to win, I
look for every player on every hole
to better his game."
"We knew we'd struggle against
the top teams (in the first few tour
naments), but we also beat some of
them," said junior Jake Poe. "For
example, we beat Texjis, and they
are ranked in the top 10."
Accompanying Ray and Poe to
Fresno this weekend will be sopho
mores Joel Kribel and Scott Wang
and freshmen Dusty Brett and
Andy Hastings. The tournament is
divided into two days of competi
tion, with 36 holes scheduled for
today and 18 holes tomorrow.
The Lexus tournament differs
from this year's previous competi
tions in that it employs a six-count
four scoring system. Teams enter
sLx golfers, and the team score con
sists of the sum of the top four
scores each day.
"It seems that with a six-count
four system it's easy for a team to
let down its guard, but we still have
to grind it out," Poe said.
"A six-count-four system can be
very positive because it is team ori
ented and anyone can contribute,"
Ray said. "On the flip side, the
other teams will have more players,
too, so it will definitely be a test of

depth. I feel that the six-count-four
system will be a good evaluation of
our team because we have good
depth and overall balance."
"There are seven or eight golfers
we could've taken; our squad is just
a reflection on how the qualifiers
went," Ray said. "Eri Crum will
definitely contribute this year,
along with freshmen Tylar Lunke
and Mike Weimer."
Although the youthfulness of
this year's team has yielded an
inexperienced squad (with two
returning varsity team members
and only one veteran senior), fresh
men Brett and Hastings are paving
a road for future success, both this
season and in upcoming years.
Collegiate competition "is a new

experience for me," Hastings said.
"This weekend, I hope I can take
my game to a new level, learn from
it and help the team as much as
possible. I think this tournament
can be a turning point for all of us."
Turning point or not, the tour
ney is important. With district
teams participating, the Lexus is
an excellent opportunity for Stan
ford to get ahead of other Pacific 10
Conference schools by establishing
a winning record against them.
Invitation to the regional tour
nament in the spring is based on a
school's head-to-head record with
other schools in its conference, so
the outcome of this tournament
will have many implications.
"We can't afford to fall behind

the other teams and play catch-up
in the spring; we need to get ahead
now," Poe said.
However, Ray also noted the
importance of focusing on the
team's own play rather than its
opponents. "We should be more
concerned about our own games
rather than the other teams
there," he said.
With a more moderate field,
Stanford should be looking at con
siderable improvement this week
end from previous finishes.
"We're all hoping to get on the
right track this weekend, beat
some teams and get this thing
turned around," Poe said. "We do
have a good team; we just have to
see things fall into place."
