# Women to golf at unique Rolex Tourney
## 
### Parker Hume 
Coming off a somewhat dis
appointing tournament last
weekend in which it finished
second behind rival San Jose
State, the Cardinal women's
golf team will look for a victory
in the desert this weekend.
The Rolex National Team
Match Play Championships on
Sunday and Monday looks to be
a great opportunity for the Car
dinal.
The tournament, in its inau
gural year, boasts the strongest
field the team has faced thus
far. Although there are only
eight teams playing, the event
organizers managed to bring all
of the top eight teams from last
year's final standings together.
Joining Stanford are the
Spartans. Arizona, Arizona
State and UCLA, as well as
Wake Forest, Texas and Duke.
The Tom Weiskopf Private
Course at PGA West in La
Quinta, Calif., is the backdrop
for what should be two compet
itive days of golf.
This tournament is unique
among college tournaments in
that it will be played in a match
play format, the same format
used in the Ryder Cup. Unlike
medal play, the typical format
for NCAA golf, match play is

not based upon the number of
strokes that an individual takes
over 18 holes, but rather upon
the number of holes won out of
18. Thus, it is possible to lose
the match while shooting a
score that is lower than an
opponent's.
The format that goes along
with match play is also quite
different from the usual NCAA
format. Rather than totaling
the scores of each five-woman
team, the Rolex will take the
results of five individual match
es between the Cardinal and an
opposing school to see who
advances in the tournament.
Essentially, there will be five
one-on-one matches, and
whichever team wins three or
more of the individual matches
will move on to the semifinal
round.
Despite the unique format of
the tournament, the Cardinal
team members have not done
anything differently in prepara
tion. Their goal is to play more
consistently than they did last
weekend, when they got off to a
great start on the first day,
shooting a course record, but
played mediocre golf the rest of
the way.
"In the past, we've been a
slow-starting team that came
from behind to finish strong, so

last weekend we tried to start
strong, which we did," said
coach Carolyn O'Connor. "But
we played pretty poorly the last
two days."
The team is really iooking
forward to the weekend, as it
will provide a real change from
the typical tournament format.
O'Connor said a winner other
than top teams San Jose State,
Arizona, Arizona State and
Stanford is certainly possible.
"Match play is so much more
wide open than stroke play; any
body can win," O'Connor said.
"The winner of this tournament
is not necessarily indicative of
who the best team is."
The Cardinal will play UCLA
in the first round of the tourna
ment on Sunday morning. If all
goes well, they will be back out
on the course Sunday afternoon
to play the winner of the San
Jose State-Wake Forest match.
The final round takes place
Monday morning.
Upon returning home on
Monday, the team will have the
following weekend off before
journeying to Hilton Head, S.C.,
to play in the Golf World Pal
metto Dunes Invitational Nov.
8-10. This tournament will also
have a strong field and is the
last tournament of the fall sea
son.
