Sailing
The Stanford sailing team
hosts the Intercollegiate Yacht
Racing Association women's
single-handed national cham
pionships this weekend in
Redwood City. The eighth
ranked Cardinal will try to
improve its ranking when
top-ranked teams such as
Navy and Tufts compete in
laser radial boats on San
Francisco Bay.
Stanford is hoping for
freshman Anika Leerssen
and sophomore Jessica
Knape to spark a successful
regatta. The team members
have their work cut out for
them, however, as laser sail
ing is not often practiced. For
directions to the regatta call
the Stanford sailing office at
3-2811.
