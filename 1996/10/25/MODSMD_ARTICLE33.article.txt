# Revolution for swimmers begins
## 
### Casey Harmon 
The men's swim team travels
to Stockton, Calif., this weekend
for the University of the Pacific
Collegiate Invitational, opening
a season that it hopes will be rev
olutionary.
Coming off a fourth-place fin
ish at last year's NCAA Champi
onships, the Cardinal is "swim
ming hungry" this year. With
"The Revolution Has Begun" as
its motto, there is no doubt that
the Cardinal means to reclaim
its place at the top of the NCAA.
Led by tri-captains Scott
Jones, Scott Claypool and Tom
Wilkens, this year's swimmers
are coming off an impressive
summer of swimming which cul
minated at the Summer Nation
al Championships in Fort Laud
erdale, Fla. In the summer, the
Stanford swimmers represented
different U.S. Swimming clubs
around the country competing in
the international standard 50-
meter pool. In Fort Lauderdale,
Stanford swimmers turned in a
multitude of fast performances
that promise to carry over to the
25-yard collegiate course as this
year's season gets under way.
Indeed, witnessing one anoth
er swim well at this summer's
big meets, as well as watching
former Stanford team members
Ray Carey, Kurt Grote, Joe
Hudepohl, Eddie Parenti and
Jeff Rouse swim in the Atlanta
Olympics, have excited the
waters of deGuerre Pool.
Last month the team gath
ered in San Diego and drove to
Stanford together, with a stop in
Los Angeles for an appearance
on "The Price is Right."
"With Bob Barker on our
side, you know we can't lose,"
said junior sprinter Chris Olson,
who gave the legendary game
show host a Stanford swimming
T-shirt when he appeared on
contestants' row. Look for the
episode to air on Nov. 12 at 10
a.m. on Channel 5.
The trip had a very positive
effect on team chemistrv. Most

importantly, it gave freshmen
Glenn Counts, Steve Neebe,
Kurt Spencer, Steve Ronson and
divers Mark Micheiin and
Andrew Harper, a chance to feel
their way into the team atmo
sphere.
"The whole point of the San
Diego trip was getting the fresh
men to become part of the team
before the year started," Jones
said.
The experience seems to liave
paid off for the freshmen, who
have been contributing to the
team already as they played a
major role in last weekend's
defeat of San Francisco State.
"The freshmen are really con
fident and are adapting very
well We're really feeding off
their enthusiasm," Olson said.
The Cardinal hopes to ride
the wave of positive feeling as it
enters this weekend's invite,
although the meet does not carry
the same weight as the dual
meets to come. Swimmers will be
swimming unusually high num
bers of events to gain racing
experience and get used to the
event format that they will
encounter at the Pac 10 and
NCAA Championships.
But even if the meet carries
little pressure, Stanford's inten
sity will be high. If the year is a
revolution, this weekend's meet
could be thought of as an early
battle, as the Cardinal hopes to
start a season that will take the
rest of the NCAA by storm.
The team's uncharacteristic
fourth-place finish at the NCAA
Championships last year has lit a
fire under the squad, and the
sense of mission seems to be
stronger than ever for Stanford.
"The events leading up to
right now have created a 25-man
team that is focused on doing
things for each other," said
sophomore butterflier Matt
Pierce. "I think that's the key.
(Head coach) Skip [Kenney]
always says, 'A hungry dog
hunts best.' Well, this year . ..
we're hungry'."
