# Bob Dole

### 
Bob Dole went to church every Sunday,
sometimes staying late to help pick up
grape juice containers after commu
nion. Boh Dole opened doors for the women of
his community, always remembering to pre
cede requests with "please and follow acts of
kindness with "thank you. Hob Dole stopped
at yellow lights. Hob Dole never lied. Hob
Dole was raised to be a good American citi
zen.
When Hob was 12 he ran away from home
to help ignite a grass-roots movement to end
racial hostility in the South. It was then that
he first made the acquaintance of the young
Martin Luther King.
Dole and King worked closely together
planning sit-ins and protests, toiling late into
the night for the cause of freedom and equali
ty. These goals burned like an eternal flame
inside young Hob Dole. His unswerving dedi
cation to peace inspired King to serve time in
prison, rather than give in to the man. He
knew then he must one day serve his brethren
as President of the United States.
Bob flew expensive aircraft and navigated

supersonic tanks in World War 11 battlefields.
He shot at men who were bad, sacrificing his
own body to preserve freedom. People felt
sorry for him and elected him to regional
office. His career supporting minorities and
underprivileged immigrants began.
As a legislator Bob Dole realized that not
all Americans were privileged enough to
attend college or have the educational experi
ences necessary to achieve the American
dream. Following an example set by Jesus, he
began donating one-tenth of his paycheck to
less fortunate humans. He now generously
contributes one half of all money received
from political action committees to the For
eign League — an organization dedicated to
helping Mexican and Cuban immigrants
assimilate into the U.S.
Bob Dole feels very strongly that family
values will save America. In a symbolic ges
ture, he adopted five emotionally traumatized
Bosnian orphans. They are now teen-agers at
a local public school. They don't drink and
they don't smoke marijuana because they
understand the dangers inherit in the use of
illicit substances. They volunteer at a hospice

center for victims of the AIDS virus. Bob Dole
set the example.
Boh Dole cares about animal rights. He
loves animals so much he refuses to eat them,
feeding on vegetation grown in his backyard
instead. He distributes pamphlets in
metropolitan areas detailing the tragedy of
animal experimentation. He set his dog and
cat free, declaring an end to animal subjuga
tion and anthropocentrism. Bob Dole does not
eat dolphin. Bob Dole does not sleep with ani
mals.
Bob Dole has character. Bob Dole should
be our President.
