# Sigma Chis hit with probation
## Penalties too stiff, frat head says 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Amid concerns that the rela
tionship between the Greek com
munity and the University is be
coming increasingly rocky, the
Sigma Chi fraternity was placed on
social probation for the duration of
fall quarter yesterday and was
banned from serving alcohol at any
of its functions until 1997.
In a letter presented to the
Sigma Chis by Dean of Students
Marc Wais, the fraternity was "for
mally censured" for the "lack of re
sponsible planning and on-site
management" at a party held Sept.
21 at which minors were served al
cohol.
"Based on the magnitude and
scope of the event in question, I felt
that the sanctions were appropri-

ate, fair and rea
sonable," Wais
said.
However,
Sigma Chi Presi
dent Christian
Nicks, a senior,
said he felt Wais'
penalties were far
from appropriate.
According to

Nicks, Wais appeared to disregard
the sanctions proposed by the
Greek Judicial Board, a body de
signed to consider Greek discipli
nary issues.
The board — which includes
students as well as administrators
— recommended only that the fra
ternity be required to publicize its
on-campus safe ride program
