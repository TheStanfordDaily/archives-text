# Sigma Chis hit with probation
## Penalties too stiff, frat head says 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Amid concerns that the rela
tionship between the Greek com
munity and the University is be
coming increasingly rocky, the
Sigma Chi fraternity was placed on
social probation for the duration of
fall quarter yesterday and was
banned from serving alcohol at any
of its functions until 1997.
In a letter presented to the
Sigma Chis by Dean of Students
Marc Wais, the fraternity was "for
mally censured" for the "lack of re
sponsible planning and on-site
management" at a party held Sept.
21 at which minors were served al
cohol.
"Based on the magnitude and
scope of the event in question, I felt
that the sanctions were appropri-

ate, fair and rea
sonable," Wais
said.
However,
Sigma Chi Presi
dent Christian
Nicks, a senior,
said he felt Wais'
penalties were far
from appropriate.
According to

Nicks, Wais appeared to disregard
the sanctions proposed by the
Greek Judicial Board, a body de
signed to consider Greek discipli
nary issues.
The board — which includes
students as well as administrators
— recommended only that the fra
ternity be required to publicize its
on-campus safe ride program


Wais
called Safe Van, organize a party
planning forum for other fraterni
ties and pledge to uphold its own
revised party-planning guidelines.
Although endorsing the board's
decision, Wais revised its recom
mendations, adding the formal
censure and the provision that the
fraternity may not serve alcohol at
any function, on or off campus,
until 1997.
Wais justified the additional
sanctions by stressing the magni
tude of the event."It put frosh and
the entire University at risk," said
Wais, who has the authority to dic
tate the final punishment regard
less of the judicial board's recom
mendation.
"The party was held on the sec
ond night that students were at
school, and for many of them this
was the first time they were away
from parental supervision," Wais
added. "Many people were vulner
able in that unsafe environment,
and that is the rationale I used in
handing down the sanctions."
Although Nicks disagreed with
Wais' assessment of the situation,
he said that his main concern rests
with the bureaucratic judicial
process which left him question
ing the University's trustworthi
ness.
Nicks said he believes Wais
placed greater weight on recom
mendations from Office of Student
Activities administrators than on
the views of the boaf d, which Nicks
described as a "jury of peers."
Although the judicial board had
recommended a lighter punish
ment than Wais ultimately decided
upon, both Office of Student Activ
ities Director Nanci Howe and
Asst. Director Heather Dunn had
advocated a tough stance, accord

ing to Nicks.
Wais defended his decision,
claiming he based his decision on
the board's recommendations, as
well as discussions with other Uni
versity officials and on a "historical
five-year review" of the ways Stan
ford has dealt with fraternity prob
lems in the past.
Wais added that he met with the
board following his revisions and
that the members were "very sup
portive" of his decision.
Furthermore, according to
Nicks, the Sigma Chis were given
contradictory information on the
day of the party, which occurred
during Orientation.
Nicks acknowledged that Dunn
had informed the fraternity that
no parties were to be thrown dur
ing Orientation but said that
Sigma Chi officers later learned
from the Dean of Students Office
that no such rule existed. It was
based upon this later information
that the fraternity went ahead
with its plans for the party.
Wais yesterday reiterated that
there was no prohibition against
parties during Orientation, ac
cording to Nicks.
Dunn disagreed with Nicks' as
sertion that there was no prohibi
tion.
"That's not true," she said, ex
plaining that while there was no
written ban, it had been made clear
that parties which conflicted with
Orientation events would not be
permitted.
"No one else seemed to have any
problems dealing with that," she
said.
Nicks, however, believes the
guidelines are unclear. "It is im
portant for students to have accu
rate information from the admin
istration," Nicks said. "Without in
formation that we can follow, [the
guidelines! become a trap which
we can fall into."
Nicks was also upset with

Dunn's conduct regarding the party.
The Daily reported that Dunn
informed the police of the under
age drinking at the party, yet origi
nally claimed the informant to be
an anonymous source.
"Heather Dunn's misrepre
senting herself to The Daily was a
horrible thing to do for a Universi
ty official who was supposed to be
our guide," Nicks said. "It was un
trustworthy and problematic."
The Dean of Students Office
has previously denied that Dunn
intended to conceal information
from The Daily, and Dunn said the
Sigma Chis were never unaware of
her role in breaking up the event.
Nicks "was well aware on that
night that I was the one who
called," Dunn said. "I spoke to sev
eral members and told them that I
was the one who called."
Dunn said that she only called
the police as a last resort when she
could not locate Sigma Chi leaders
on the night of the party.
"I made a real effort to get in
touch with the leadership before I
resorted to calling the police," she
said. "The last thing I wanted to do
was call."
Nicks' claims of the confusion
surrounding the recommenda
tions may be supported by the fact
that sophomore Ghazal Badioza
mani, the lone student selected last
year by the ASSU Nominations
Commission to serve on the board,
did not participate in the process.
"I was surprised when I heard
about [the board's decision | be
cause I was never even called," Ba
diozamani said.
During the same weekend in
which the Sigma Chis held their
party, a Delta Kappa Epsilon party
was broken up by police and
deemed to be in violation of Uni
versity party-planning guidelines..
Wais could not comment on the
status of the Dekes' fate, as it has
yet to be settled.

Sigma Chi fraternity was placed on
social probation for the duration of
fall quarter yesterday and was
banned from serving alcohol at any
of its functions until 1997.
In a letter presented to the
Sigma Chis by Dean of Students
Marc Wais, the fraternity was "for
mally censured" for the "lack of re
sponsible planning and on-site
management" at a party held Sept.
21 at which minors were served al
cohol.
"Based on the magnitude and
scope of the event in question, I felt
that the sanctions were appropri-

ate, fair and rea
sonable," Wais
said.
However,
Sigma Chi Presi
dent Christian
Nicks, a senior,
said he felt Wais'
penalties were far
from appropriate.
According to

Nicks, Wais appeared to disregard
the sanctions proposed by the
Greek Judicial Board, a body de
signed to consider Greek discipli
nary issues.
The board — which includes
students as well as administrators
— recommended only that the fra
ternity be required to publicize its
on-campus safe ride program


Wais
called Safe Van, organize a party
planning forum for other fraterni
ties and pledge to uphold its own
revised party-planning guidelines.
Although endorsing the board's
decision, Wais revised its recom
mendations, adding the formal
censure and the provision that the
fraternity may not serve alcohol at
any function, on or off campus,
until 1997.
Wais justified the additional
sanctions by stressing the magni
tude of the event."It put frosh and
the entire University at risk," said
Wais, who has the authority to dic
tate the final punishment regard
less of the judicial board's recom
mendation.
"The party was held on the sec
ond night that students were at
school, and for many of them this
was the first time they were away
from parental supervision," Wais
added. "Many people were vulner
able in that unsafe environment,
and that is the rationale I used in
handing down the sanctions."
Although Nicks disagreed with
Wais' assessment of the situation,
he said that his main concern rests
with the bureaucratic judicial
process which left him question
ing the University's trustworthi
ness.
Nicks said he believes Wais
placed greater weight on recom
mendations from Office of Student
Activities administrators than on
the views of the boaf d, which Nicks
described as a "jury of peers."
Although the judicial board had
recommended a lighter punish
ment than Wais ultimately decided
upon, both Office of Student Activ
ities Director Nanci Howe and
Asst. Director Heather Dunn had
advocated a tough stance, accord

ing to Nicks.
Wais defended his decision,
claiming he based his decision on
the board's recommendations, as
well as discussions with other Uni
versity officials and on a "historical
five-year review" of the ways Stan
ford has dealt with fraternity prob
lems in the past.
Wais added that he met with the
board following his revisions and
that the members were "very sup
portive" of his decision.
Furthermore, according to
Nicks, the Sigma Chis were given
contradictory information on the
day of the party, which occurred
during Orientation.
Nicks acknowledged that Dunn
had informed the fraternity that
no parties were to be thrown dur
ing Orientation but said that
Sigma Chi officers later learned
from the Dean of Students Office
that no such rule existed. It was
based upon this later information
that the fraternity went ahead
with its plans for the party.
Wais yesterday reiterated that
there was no prohibition against
parties during Orientation, ac
cording to Nicks.
Dunn disagreed with Nicks' as
sertion that there was no prohibi
tion.
"That's not true," she said, ex
plaining that while there was no
written ban, it had been made clear
that parties which conflicted with
Orientation events would not be
permitted.
"No one else seemed to have any
problems dealing with that," she
said.
Nicks, however, believes the
guidelines are unclear. "It is im
portant for students to have accu
rate information from the admin
istration," Nicks said. "Without in
formation that we can follow, [the
guidelines! become a trap which
we can fall into."
Nicks was also upset with

Dunn's conduct regarding the party.
The Daily reported that Dunn
informed the police of the under
age drinking at the party, yet origi
nally claimed the informant to be
an anonymous source.
"Heather Dunn's misrepre
senting herself to The Daily was a
horrible thing to do for a Universi
ty official who was supposed to be
our guide," Nicks said. "It was un
trustworthy and problematic."
The Dean of Students Office
has previously denied that Dunn
intended to conceal information
from The Daily, and Dunn said the
Sigma Chis were never unaware of
her role in breaking up the event.
Nicks "was well aware on that
night that I was the one who
called," Dunn said. "I spoke to sev
eral members and told them that I
was the one who called."
Dunn said that she only called
the police as a last resort when she
could not locate Sigma Chi leaders
on the night of the party.
"I made a real effort to get in
touch with the leadership before I
resorted to calling the police," she
said. "The last thing I wanted to do
was call."
Nicks' claims of the confusion
surrounding the recommenda
tions may be supported by the fact
that sophomore Ghazal Badioza
mani, the lone student selected last
year by the ASSU Nominations
Commission to serve on the board,
did not participate in the process.
"I was surprised when I heard
about [the board's decision | be
cause I was never even called," Ba
diozamani said.
During the same weekend in
which the Sigma Chis held their
party, a Delta Kappa Epsilon party
was broken up by police and
deemed to be in violation of Uni
versity party-planning guidelines..
Wais could not comment on the
status of the Dekes' fate, as it has
yet to be settled.
