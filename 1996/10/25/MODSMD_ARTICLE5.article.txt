# Communication is key during disaster
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
When the power went out on Oct.
10, people naturally wondered what
happened. Attempts to find out more
information proved futile, as emer
gency phone lines were often busy.
However, in the case of a more
serious situation, an inability to
get details about the situation
could cause problems for people
both on and off campus.
In the event of a disaster, the
role of the Stanford media is to in
form. The backup systems of the
Office of Distributed Computing
and Communication Systems, the
University News Service and The
Daily are varied in their content
and effectiveness.
Networking
As anybody attempting to use
e-mail during or shortly after the

power outage discovered, the net
working system went down, tak
ing with it outside networks.
"Our planning is organized
around events that are not cam
pus-wide, such as a failure in one

building," said Chip Haven, tech
nical manager for Distributed
Computing. "We depend on the
power."
In other words, what happened
in the last power outage was not a
fluke and would happen again.
"We've talked about the wis
dom of providing Ibackup power
sources]," he said. "It is a cost vs.
benefit analysis. If this only hap
pens every 12 years, is it worth
it?"
However, computing employ
ees have thought about some
changes in light of the outage,
when the second floor of Forsythe
Hall — where most of the crucial
network hubs are located — lost
power. Haven said he is speaking
with other groups that use the
same facilities to try to arrange a
backup power supply.
In addition, "We realized that
to transmit a network signal from
the [Department of] Public Safety
to Forsythe, it steps through sev
eral places where power is neces
sary," Haven said. "We need to
see what we can do to change
that."
Stanford's World Wide Web
site is a potential source for infor
mation in the case of a disaster.
Haven said that plans are being
developed to set up a Web site
based on a server outside Califor
nia so that people could get infor
mation there if the campus infra
structure were destroyed.
The change would be made by
rerouting all network communi
cations with "stanford.edu" to the
outside site, where information
could be sent in via satellite
phones or other means.
"During a major disaster, there
would be lots of people concerned
about the status of the campus,"
Haven said.
Communication services
The first place concerned peo
ple are likely to turn as a means of
getting more information is the
telephone.
While the outage did affect the
second floor of Forsythe, it did not
affect campus phone services.
Communications Systems
Asst. Director for Communica
tion Services Maureen Trimm

said the phone system was kept
running because of a multilevel
disaster backup plan employed by
the University.
Phones are kept active during
power outages with batteries and
automatic startup generators, she
said, in much the same manner as
local phone companies all around
the country.
The phone routes around cam
pus also have been set up in a cir
cular fashion rather than a direct
one, so calls can be rerouted
around problem areas in case of
spot failures, Trimm added.
In the case of a disaster wiping
out the emergency phone system,
there are systems of "red phones"
around campus, which are ser
viced by Pacific Bell.
"The hospital has about 150
red phones, and there are about
200 distributed around campus,
including at the Emergency Oper
ations Center," she said. "Of
course, this is assuming Pacific
Bell is still functioning, too."
The third level of back up
would be cellular phones, Trimm
said. Communication Systems
has a number of cell phones, but
even without dependence on
power, problems could arise be
cause of jammed lines.
"In the 1989 earthquake, it
took me a half-hour to get a dial
tone on my cell phone," Trimm re
called.
Beyond that, she said the only
resort would be to use radio fre
quencies, like the police and fire
departments.
News Service
Much like networking, Stan
ford News Service is currently de
veloping a high-technology disas
ter plan.
According to Jack Hubbard, as
sociate director of University
communications, News Service
would act as an independent enti
ty in the case of a serious disaster.
"We've got everything down on
paper," he said. "We know what
we want to do, and we've put in a
request to do that independently,
in the way of power and function
ality, so we don't encumber the
police, for example."
Although Hubbard declined to
disclose dollar amounts, he said
the plan would cost "a fair
amount."
"Anybody that does disaster
planning on campus will tell you

that you have to spend a chunk of
money, that things are not
cheap," he said.
The plan includes such tech
nology as generators, cellular
phones, satellite phones, portable
computers, digital cameras and a
trailer from which to work.
"News Service has historically
done well in emergencies," Hub
bard said. "This would allow us to
go to one place, open up a trailer,
break out the gear, set up shop
and work independently."
If the nearly complete plan is
approved by the President's Of
fice, it could be set in motion im
mediately, Hubbard added.
Hubbard also outlined the im
portance of a disaster plan, partic
ularly the need for backup power
supplies.
"Clearly, in any circumstance,
if you take some major hits and
you don't have an interrupted
power source, you don't have
much," he said.
The Daily
With no generators or battery
powered lights, The Daily's office
was sent into complete darkness
during the outage, sending edi
tors scrambling for flashlights
and bike lights. And because The
Daily's phone system is electron
ic, there was no way to place or re
ceive phone calls.
"We were completely scram
bling," said Editor in Chief Beth
Berselli.
To publish the following day's
newspaper, a temporary news
room was set up in the lounge of
Haus Mitteleuropa, one of a few
Row houses with power during
the outage and home to a Daily
staff member.
Although power returned in
time to produce printed material
to be sent to The Daily's printer in
San Jose, precautionary arrange
ments were made with the Palo
Alto Daily News to share printing
equipment had power not been
available.
However, in the case of a more
widespread outage, none of that
may have been an option.
"Our lack of a plan was some
thing I was aware of," Berselli
said.
Currently, a plan is being de
veloped, which Berselli said would
be discussed at the next Daily
Board of Directors meeting. She
said it would include purchases

ranging from flashlights and
phones that function without
electricity to higher-cost items
such as laptop computers, digital
cameras and possibly a generator.
Berselli also noted that she
would look into pursuing agree
ments with the Daily News and
the Palo Alto Weekly to help each
other in the case of a disaster.
"It is really important for The
Daily to have this plan worked
through," Berselli added. The
outage "wasn't anything we were
prepared for."
University assistance
Almost everybody agrees that
the University needs to help the
media, both internal and exter
nal, to get information as soon as
possible.
KZSU General Manager Sean
Kennedy said his staffs efforts to
get information about the outage
from University sources were in
vain, especially during the first
several hours of the outage.
"The only person we managed
to get ahold of was at the I Cardi
nal Cogeneration] Facility,"
Kennedy said. "He said, 'Yeah,
there's a power outage' and hung
up. About an hour and a half into
it, Communication Services called
and said it's OK to broadcast that
there's a power outage."
KZSU was not the alone in
failed attempts at getting infor
mation from University sources.
Officials from Bon Appetit and li
braries also reported unsuccess
ful attempts at getting through to
authorities.
"I don't know if they realize
there's a station here that can
broadcast information to all stu
dents," Kennedy said.
Thus, students and faculty
were left in the dark in more ways
than one.
Trimm said the outage spurred
Communication Systems to look
into ways to solve the problem.
She said staff members are work
ing on developing a phone number
to call and get updated informa
tion in the case of another cam
pus-wide disaster.
In addition, she said the Uni
versity is also looking into getting
an 1-800 number in an out-of-state
location to be used by those outside
Stanford desiring information.
Those concerned could call the
number without tying up lines in
the area affected by the disaster.
When the power went out on Oct.
10, people naturally wondered what
happened. Attempts to find out more
information proved futile, as emer
gency phone lines were often busy.

would act as an independent enti
ty in the case of a serious disaster.
"We've got everything down on
paper," he said. "We know what
we want to do, and we've put in a
request to do that independently,
in the way of power and function
ality, so we don't encumber the
police, for example."
Although Hubbard declined to
disclose dollar amounts, he said
the plan would cost "a fair
amount."
"Anybody that does disaster
planning on campus will tell you

that you have to spend a chunk of
money, that things are not
cheap," he said.
The plan includes such tech
nology as generators, cellular
phones, satellite phones, portable
computers, digital cameras and a
trailer from which to work.
"News Service has historically
done well in emergencies," Hub
bard said. "This would allow us to
go to one place, open up a trailer,
break out the gear, set up shop
and work independently."
If the nearly complete plan is
approved by the President's Of
fice, it could be set in motion im
mediately, Hubbard added.
Hubbard also outlined the im
portance of a disaster plan, partic
ularly the need for backup power
supplies.
"Clearly, in any circumstance,
if you take some major hits and
you don't have an interrupted
power source, you don't have
much," he said.
The Daily
With no generators or battery
powered lights, The Daily's office
was sent into complete darkness
during the outage, sending edi
tors scrambling for flashlights
and bike lights. And because The
Daily's phone system is electron
ic, there was no way to place or re
ceive phone calls.
"We were completely scram
bling," said Editor in Chief Beth
Berselli.
To publish the following day's
newspaper, a temporary news
room was set up in the lounge of
Haus Mitteleuropa, one of a few
Row houses with power during
the outage and home to a Daily
staff member.
Although power returned in
time to produce printed material
to be sent to The Daily's printer in
San Jose, precautionary arrange
ments were made with the Palo
Alto Daily News to share printing
equipment had power not been
available.
However, in the case of a more
widespread outage, none of that
may have been an option.
"Our lack of a plan was some
thing I was aware of," Berselli
said.
Currently, a plan is being de
veloped, which Berselli said would
be discussed at the next Daily
Board of Directors meeting. She
said it would include purchases

ranging from flashlights and
phones that function without
electricity to higher-cost items
such as laptop computers, digital
cameras and possibly a generator.
Berselli also noted that she
would look into pursuing agree
ments with the Daily News and
the Palo Alto Weekly to help each
other in the case of a disaster.
"It is really important for The
Daily to have this plan worked
through," Berselli added. The
outage "wasn't anything we were
prepared for."
University assistance
Almost everybody agrees that
the University needs to help the
media, both internal and exter
nal, to get information as soon as
possible.
KZSU General Manager Sean
Kennedy said his staffs efforts to
get information about the outage
from University sources were in
vain, especially during the first
several hours of the outage.
"The only person we managed
to get ahold of was at the I Cardi
nal Cogeneration] Facility,"
Kennedy said. "He said, 'Yeah,
there's a power outage' and hung
up. About an hour and a half into
it, Communication Services called
and said it's OK to broadcast that
there's a power outage."
KZSU was not the alone in
failed attempts at getting infor
mation from University sources.
Officials from Bon Appetit and li
braries also reported unsuccess
ful attempts at getting through to
authorities.
"I don't know if they realize
there's a station here that can
broadcast information to all stu
dents," Kennedy said.
Thus, students and faculty
were left in the dark in more ways
than one.
Trimm said the outage spurred
Communication Systems to look
into ways to solve the problem.
She said staff members are work
ing on developing a phone number
to call and get updated informa
tion in the case of another cam
pus-wide disaster.
In addition, she said the Uni
versity is also looking into getting
an 1-800 number in an out-of-state
location to be used by those outside
Stanford desiring information.
Those concerned could call the
number without tying up lines in
the area affected by the disaster.
When the power went out on Oct.
10, people naturally wondered what
happened. Attempts to find out more
information proved futile, as emer
gency phone lines were often busy.
However, in the case of a more
serious situation, an inability to
get details about the situation
could cause problems for people
both on and off campus.
In the event of a disaster, the
role of the Stanford media is to in
form. The backup systems of the
Office of Distributed Computing
and Communication Systems, the
University News Service and The
Daily are varied in their content
and effectiveness.
Networking
As anybody attempting to use
e-mail during or shortly after the

power outage discovered, the net
working system went down, tak
ing with it outside networks.
"Our planning is organized
around events that are not cam
pus-wide, such as a failure in one

building," said Chip Haven, tech
nical manager for Distributed
Computing. "We depend on the
power."
In other words, what happened
in the last power outage was not a
fluke and would happen again.
"We've talked about the wis
dom of providing Ibackup power
sources]," he said. "It is a cost vs.
benefit analysis. If this only hap
pens every 12 years, is it worth
it?"
However, computing employ
ees have thought about some
changes in light of the outage,
when the second floor of Forsythe
Hall — where most of the crucial
network hubs are located — lost
power. Haven said he is speaking
with other groups that use the
same facilities to try to arrange a
backup power supply.
In addition, "We realized that
to transmit a network signal from
the [Department of] Public Safety
to Forsythe, it steps through sev
eral places where power is neces
sary," Haven said. "We need to
see what we can do to change
that."
Stanford's World Wide Web
site is a potential source for infor
mation in the case of a disaster.
Haven said that plans are being
developed to set up a Web site
based on a server outside Califor
nia so that people could get infor
mation there if the campus infra
structure were destroyed.
The change would be made by
rerouting all network communi
cations with "stanford.edu" to the
outside site, where information
could be sent in via satellite
phones or other means.
"During a major disaster, there
would be lots of people concerned
about the status of the campus,"
Haven said.
Communication services
The first place concerned peo
ple are likely to turn as a means of
getting more information is the
telephone.
While the outage did affect the
second floor of Forsythe, it did not
affect campus phone services.
Communications Systems
Asst. Director for Communica
tion Services Maureen Trimm

said the phone system was kept
running because of a multilevel
disaster backup plan employed by
the University.
Phones are kept active during
power outages with batteries and
automatic startup generators, she
said, in much the same manner as
local phone companies all around
the country.
The phone routes around cam
pus also have been set up in a cir
cular fashion rather than a direct
one, so calls can be rerouted
around problem areas in case of
spot failures, Trimm added.
In the case of a disaster wiping
out the emergency phone system,
there are systems of "red phones"
around campus, which are ser
viced by Pacific Bell.
"The hospital has about 150
red phones, and there are about
200 distributed around campus,
including at the Emergency Oper
ations Center," she said. "Of
course, this is assuming Pacific
Bell is still functioning, too."
The third level of back up
would be cellular phones, Trimm
said. Communication Systems
has a number of cell phones, but
even without dependence on
power, problems could arise be
cause of jammed lines.
"In the 1989 earthquake, it
took me a half-hour to get a dial
tone on my cell phone," Trimm re
called.
Beyond that, she said the only
resort would be to use radio fre
quencies, like the police and fire
departments.

ford News Service is currently de
veloping a high-technology disas
ter plan.
