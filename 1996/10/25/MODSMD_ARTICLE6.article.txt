## 
### Kelly E. Young Contributing writer 
About 30 women brought their
lunches to the Women's Center yes
terday to hear Sally Dickson, direc
tor of the Office of Multicultural
Development.
But it was coffee, not lunch, that
turned out to be the center of the
discussion â€” or at least coffee cups.
At the beginning of her talk,
Dickson held up a coffee mug that a
student had given her.
"This is my life," she said.
"There is a word on the cup and it
says, 'evolve.' "
"You have to put something in
the cup," she said, pointing to her
mug. "There has to be a center or a

focal point. For me, that center has
always been people. . .. That center
is what you always have to be in

In terms of her center, Dickson
said she first knew she wanted to
spend her life helping people bring

of her typical Sunday cultural ex
cursions with her father as a 7-year -

ness."
She said she turned to her father
and asked, "Why is he doing that?"
Her father replied, " Tou never
know a person's story.' "
When she asked what that

meant, he said, " You never know
what a person's doing until you
know why he's doing it.'
"When he said that to me, :t real
ly began to create a center for me.
You find out his story first," she ex
plained. "and then you'll under
stand why he's doing it."
Dickson graduated from the
Rutgers University Law School. Al
though her family naturally expect
ed her to practice law, she instead
saw her law degree as a "tool for so
cial change."
The passion "comes from your
center," she said. "I'm not going to
compromise on that because I know
what excites me."
In addition to lecturing at the
