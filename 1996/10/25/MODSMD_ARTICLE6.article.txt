# Dickson encourages women to search for a 'center' in life
## 
### Kelly E. Young Contributing writer 
About 30 women brought their
lunches to the Women's Center yes
terday to hear Sally Dickson, direc
tor of the Office of Multicultural
Development.
But it was coffee, not lunch, that
turned out to be the center of the
discussion — or at least coffee cups.
At the beginning of her talk,
Dickson held up a coffee mug that a
student had given her.
"This is my life," she said.
"There is a word on the cup and it
says, 'evolve.' "
"You have to put something in
the cup," she said, pointing to her
mug. "There has to be a center or a

focal point. For me, that center has
always been people. . .. That center
is what you always have to be in
search for."
In terms of her center, Dickson
said she first knew she wanted to
spend her life helping people bring
about change when she was on one
of her typical Sunday cultural ex
cursions with her father as a 7-year -
old.
For the first time, she saw a man
eating out of a garbage can and de
scribed a feeling of "disconnected
ness."
She said she turned to her father
and asked, "Why is he doing that?"
Her father replied, " Tou never
know a person's story.' "
When she asked what that

meant, he said, " You never know
what a person's doing until you
know why he's doing it.'
"When he said that to me, :t real
ly began to create a center for me.
You find out his story first," she ex
plained. "and then you'll under
stand why he's doing it."
Dickson graduated from the
Rutgers University Law School. Al
though her family naturally expect
ed her to practice law, she instead
saw her law degree as a "tool for so
cial change."
The passion "comes from your
center," she said. "I'm not going to
compromise on that because I know
what excites me."
In addition to lecturing at the
Law School, Dickson has spent
much of her time at Stanford fo
cusing on gender and racial issues.
Not only is Dickson a sexual ha
rassment adviser on campus, but
she also serves on an affirmative
action council and the Committee
of 15.
Dickson emphasized that open
dialogue about racial and gender
issues takes effort.
Paraphrasing the work of les
bian activist-poet Audre Lorde,
she said that "when people talk
about race and they go away feel
ing good, they haven't really
talked about race.

"We have to be able to talk
about things that are painful.
Racism is a disease that affects us
all, both as the victims and vic
timizers," she added.
Throughout her life, she has
been conscientious of such pain.
Even as a 7-year-old, she saw the
man's pain while he was rum
maging through the garbage can.
"I think that [pain] has kind of
been my journey," she said.
While that walk with her fa
ther played a significant role in
her life, the era in which she grew
up also greatly influenced her,
she said.
"I'm proud to say, 'Yes, I am a
product of the '60s.' The '60s were
easy, in a way, because [change]
was in your face. You were either
going to the march or you were

going to sit at home by yourself."
Dickson's talk is the second of
the Women's Center's "Compos
ing a Life" brown-bag lunch se
ries. According to the center's ed
ucational program intern, senior
Melissa Hoover, the title comes
from a biography by Mary
Catherine Bateson on women in
tellectuals in the United States.
She said having the opportuni
ty to speak at the center was
"therapeutic" and called for her
to be reflective on how she has
composed her life.
"In many ways, I'm sharing
with you the process of compos
ing a life," she said. "You are
doing the same. As professional
women, we really don't have time
to think, 'How am I composing
my life?' "
