# Harris speaks on controversial logging practices in the state

Author and former Stanford student body president
David Harris discussed the controversy surrounding
the protection of the Headwaters Forest in Northern
California last night in the Eucalipto lounge.
Harris, author of "The Stand" and leader of the
student body in 1966, was speaking as part of a series
on social movements sponsored by West l^agunita
Harris, Class of '67, summarized the Headwaters
controversy as "the story of what happens when big
money comes to a small town with big trees."
The federal government, supported by President
Clinton, proposed a plan to buy 8,000 acres of the

60,000-acre Headwaters Forest from Maxxam and Pa
cific Lumber Co. for $380 million in an attempt to pre
serve the last existing redwood forest outside the na
tional parks system.
In order for this to happen, a wildlife management
plan must be accepted by Maxxam and Pacific Lumber
President Charles Hurwitz, as well as the state Fish
and Game Department, which would function to pre
serve the environment.
Proposals have been rejected twice in the past by
Hurwitz, who claims that government action will
destroy the logging industry in a town which de-
pends on it.
In contrast to the lumber com
pany, Harris and other activists feel
that the government proposal is in
sufficient in preserving the envi
ronment and assert that all 60,000
acres must be preserved.
Prior to 1985, the logging prac
tices of the company were accepted
as environmentally sound. Howev
er, a takeover in 1985 spurred a
shift in policy to make the company

more productive.
The Headwaters Forest, former
ly a reserve source for logging,
began to be seen as a potential
source of prosperity during this pe
riod, Harris said.
Although exact figures are not
available, Harris speculates that
Hurwitz doubled or even tripled
cutting in Humboldt County in an
attempt to boost profits, which pro
pelled him to a position among the
Fortune 500.
This dramatic increase in log
ging spurred opposition from many
area activists in 1986, who claimed
that this action would exterminate

the endangered species that resided
in the forest, Harris said.
Harris put the issue into a
broader perspective, saying the de
cision to save the forest represents
"a historical intersection where
American outlooks are going to be
shaped."
The acceptance of the plan
would imply a "radical attack on
Wall Street," foreshadowing strin
gent environmental regulations on
big business, said Harris.
Its rejection, on the other hand,
would provide big business with an
opportunity to weaken its environ
mental policy, he added.
