Can the world feed its people?
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” It's shaping into the great debate for
the 21st century: Can the world produce enough to feed another
few billion people?
Agronomists and other scientists say yes, and they want more
money to research everything from milk cows that also pull plows
to hybrid potatoes.
Population activists and some social scientists say no, and they
believe the only solution is to limit the mouths to feed.
The environmental research group Worldwatch said in a pes
simistic report last month that "food scarcity is emerging as the
defining issue of a new era" where future supplies will depend
more on family planners than fishermen and farmers.
The Consultative Group on International Agricultural
Research, with research labs around the world, issued its own
optimistic report on the future of world food production yesterday.
"Despite some gloom and doom predictions, the world has the
resources needed to feed the 8 billion-plus people who will be on
Earth in 2025," the report says.
