# Kemp blasts fleeing Republicans
## VP candidate scolds party members, urges Perot to support Dole 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Calling
Hob Dole a hero, Jack Kemp scold
ed fellow Republicans yesterday for
appearing to abandon Dole in his
"moment of need" to focus on
keeping control of Congress
instead.
With Election Day looming and
Dole still well behind President
Clinton in the polls, Kemp also
made another plea to Reform Party
candidate Ross Perot, beseeching
Perot to drop out and throw his
support to Dole.
"Ross, I beg you. You should be
supporting the one man who can
bring about these reforms in Amer
ica,"he said on CBS' "Face the
Nation."

Perot, who last week rebuffed a
direct endorsement overture from
the Dole campaign, stressed again
yesterday that he is in the race to
stay.
"I am urging them (the Ameri
can people) to vote for us, not for
anybody else," the Texan said on
NBC's "Meet the Press."
Perot spent nearly his entire
interview criticizing the Clinton
a< stration for what he said
Wuc ethical lapses, saying they
could turn into "Watergate II"and
divert attention from running the
nation.
Dole, campaigning in California,
latched onto the Perot comments
to launch vet another attack

against Clinton.
"It's the animal house; it's no
longer the White House. ... I ain't
believe any thinking American —
except the real partisans — want
four more years of this," Dole said
at an annual Steak and Oyster
Feed just outside Sacramento.
"Ross Perot suggests, indirectly,
it may not be four more years.
Maybe it's going to be so serious
next year, somebody might be in
real trouble. I didn't say that, Ross
Perot did — but I thought about
it," Dole said.
Dole has been telling Perot sup
porters to pick him and not "waste
your vote" because the Reform
Partv candidate "doesn't have a

chance."
In an all-out hid for California's
54 electoral votes — one-fifth of
the 270 needed to win the election
Dole was spending nearly four
days in the Golden State and hoped
to return for an election-even blitz,
according to his campaign. Opinion
polls show Dole from 8-20 points
behind Clinton in California, but
the state is critical to his comeback
hopes.
Kemp's displeasure with other
Republicans came amid indications
that some GOP leaders have writ
ten off Dole's chances of catching
Clinton and are shifting attention
to protecting the Republican
majority in Congress.
