## Lempert over Laliotis 
### 
THE CALIFORNIA STATE
Assembly has been a turbu
lent political institution since
1994 when Republicans gained a
majority of one. Since then, it has

labored under three speak
ers, as Republicans have
tried to bring their "revolu
tion" to the state house.
The delicate balance of
forces in the Assembly
makes every race particu
larly important this year.
Here in the 21st district,
the campaign is between
two strong candidates,

incumbent Democrat Ted Lempert
and Republican challenger Ted Lali
otis.
Lempert is a two-term incumbent
who has fought tirelessly for political
ethics legislation and succeeded in
passing the strongest ethics law in
California history.
He has been a strong proponent
for the environment and is a recipi
ent of many accolades from environ
mental organizations. In fact, before
the Republican takeover of the
Assembly, he served as chair of the
Select Committee on Marine

Resources and as a member of the
Committee on Environmental Safe
ty and Toxics.
Laliotis, the challenger, also has
impressive credentials. He is an engi-

neering executive at Hewlett-
Packard Co. and has served as
mayor and council member of
Los Altos. He is a strong pro
ponent of affordable housing
and wants to boost the econo
my via tax credits, reduced
state regulations and sales tax
exemptions for research and
development.
Laliotis is an attractive can-

didate, but Lempert will serve Stan
ford best in the coming two years.
Besides the fact that Lempert has
already proven himself an expert
and effective legislator in Sacra
mento, he has spent time on cam
pus listening to, and talking with,
Stanford students, giving us the
opportunity to speak to him one-on
one.
Recognizing the precarious bal
ance of power in the Assembly, Stan
ford community members should
make sure that Ted Lempert retains
his seat.
