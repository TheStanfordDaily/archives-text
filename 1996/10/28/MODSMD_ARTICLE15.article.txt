# Byron is a Sher thing

THE RACE FOR State Senate
District 11 is a little more
clear cut than the Assembly
race.
This seat is being contested by
incumbent Democrat Byron Sher
and Republican Patrick Shannon.
But there is only one true choice for
the Stanford community on Nov. 5
— Byron Sher.
Shannon is running on four
issues. He is in favor of Proposition
209 (the California Civil Rights Ini
tiative) that will for the most part
end affirmative action in all govern
ment agencies. He believes in term
limits for our legislators; he is pro
choice. And finally, he is a supporter
of "sensible" environmental protec
tion.
Sher, on the other hand, brings a
wealth of legislative experience to
this race. He served as an Assem

blyman, chairing the Natural
Resources Committee until this
year, when he was elected to fill a
vacancy in the Senate. Sher has
lived in the district since 1957 and
has had a long and effective involve
ment with city government. More
importantly, Sher was a Stanford
law professor and also served as
Faculty Senate chair and as a mem
ber of the Budget Priorities Adviso
ry Commission.
Sher has frequently visited cam
pus and met with students since
March. Moreover, as a former pro
fessor and Faculty Senate chair, he
has a knowledge of Stanford's con
cerns and interests that Shannon
cannot duplicate.
Sher, with his strong Stanford
connection and wealth of legislative
experience, should be re-elected to
the 11th District Senate seat.
