## Solicitors, leave us alone 
### 
People at Stanford seem to
have a lot of things other people
want. And I'm not talking about
our workloads or job prospects. The
solicitors that come to campus want our
money, our votes, our labor and even
our souls.
I personally have been confronted by
solicitors in White Plaza, in my room
and on the phone. People have tried to
sell me everything from bottled water to
salvation, and frankly, I'm sick of it.
These solicitors can be divided up
into four general categories: political
(the most common in this election year),
religious (the most prominent), com
mercial (gotta love those candy bar
kids!) and internal (henceforth referred
to as "moles"). These categories can be
further divided into two subgroups —
active and passive — based on their
method of solicitation.
I have no problem with the passive
solicitors. They set up tables in White
Plaza and hang banners and fliers all
over our residences. This subgroup is
only concerned with making others
aware of what they are offering. They
are easy to ignore, yet accessible for
interested parties.
But the active solicitors are a menace
to our society. They generally make me
shy away from the products or activities
they represent simply because the solic
itors themselves are annoying. Do you
want to change long distance compa
nies? Help out with a political cam

paign? Have a wet, silly time at Anchor
Splash? Join a religious cult? Maybe, I'll
let you know, now leave me alone.
Most members of the Stanford com
munity are fully capable of deciding
what to purchase and how to behave. If
I thought having spring water on tap in
my room was useful, surely I would call
the water man.
To deter solicitors, the University
should post "no soliciting" signs around
campus. This action might violate peo
ple's right to free speech, but nothing
valuable is being said, so why torment
us? The Revolution will not begin in
White Plaza, my friends.
"No soliciting / solicitar es prohibido"
signs seem to work well at fast food
restaurant chains, so I don't see any
thing wrong with having them at Stan
ford. Are we too proud to imitate the
behavior of a lowbrow burger joint? At
least I don't have to register to vote
every time I want some french fries.
This seems like an unlikely remedy,
so we must establish a common strategy
for dealing with solicitors. I recommend
using the foreign accent of your choice
and speaking in broken English when a
solicitor approaches you. Make sure to
keep a puzzled look on your face and to
use the phrase "uh, how do you say, um,
uh" intermittently.
This approach is especially effective
with the political solicitors because they
immediately assume that you are not
eligible to vote in the United States.

Most other solicitors will rapidly become
frustrated and give up. In the event you
run into an uncommonly brassbound
solicitor, you might want to try playing
the culture card ("In my culture this is a
bad, bad thing").
The one remaining problem you may
have is with the "moles." These are gen
erally people that you met freshman
year either in your dorm or Cultures,
Ideas and Values section and who now
are members of miscellaneous student
groups that interest you in no way. They
will approach you under the pretext of
reminiscent chitchat, patiently awaiting
the opportunity to insert their pitch —
"Oh, hey, (insert random campus group)
is having our little (insert event) on
(insert day). It should be fun. I was won
dering if you want to (help out / partici
pate / pay to attend)."
I've found that a quick kick to the
shin is the best way to get out of this
situation. You don't have to listen to the
person, and they'll probably never talk
to you again.
Whatever you do, be certain not to
give in to any active solicitors. Unlike
most of society's problems, ignoring
solicitors will make them go away.

wet, silly time at Anchor Splash.
