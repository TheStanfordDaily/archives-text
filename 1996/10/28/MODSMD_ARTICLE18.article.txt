Wais shows narrow view of University in rejecting Spoon

WE WERE APPALLED at the
comments made by Dean of
Students Marc Wais and Stan
ford Police Capt. Marvin Moore in last
Thursday's article, "Food For Life."
The reasons given by Wais and Moore
to dismiss Spoon Hunger Relief Net
work's proposal to host a weekly meal
on campus for the homeless reveal the
ignorance which this proposal seeks to
attack.
Wais has a narrow vision of Stan
ford's purpose; he states that the Uni
versity is an educational enterprise and
that Spoon's proposal is not consistent
with Stanford's overall educational mis
sion. We ask, "Then what is Stanford's
mission?"
According to the University Charter,
one of the key objectives is "to promote
public welfare by exercising an influ-

ence on behalf of humanity and civiliza
tion" (Bulletin, page 6). We fail to see
the inconsistency between this mission
and Spoon's proposal to encourage
interaction between two communities
by serving food on campus.
We think it unnecessary and unrea
sonable that Stanford should attempt
to isolate itself from the larger commu
nity. This separatist attitude fosters
fear and ignorance on all sides. We are
indeed ashamed that our University,
which prides itself on promoting "mul
ticultural education," has a police cap
tain who is "not happy with the idea of
mixing the student population with the
homeless population." Similar argu
ments such as his have been used in the
past to justify apartheid-like policies.
We object to Wais and Moore's impli
cation that the presence of homeless
people on campus would pose a security

risk. The only thing we risk is opening
students' eyes and minds to a pressing
social concern.
The fact of the matter is, Stanford is
an open campus — a fact attested to by
the Marguerite shuttle and public
buses. Anyone, even a criminal, is able
to come to campus. We believe this
inviting atmosphere is symbolic of the
high value Stanford claims to place on
the free exchange of ideas. An open
campus is something that should be
prized, not feared.
Dean Wais distorts the issue when
he misconstrues the implications of
adopting Spoon's proposal. An invita
tion to homeless people to share food
and thoughts with students is NOT an
offer to house them, as Wais seems to
think.
While we, as members of Stanford
Hornelessness Action Coalition, would

love to see some of Stanford's 8,180
acres of land devoted to low-income
housing, Spoon's initiative is but a
small request. All they have proposed is
that once a week leftover food collected
from dining halls is distributed some
where on campus. That's it.
Private universities are often criti
cized for their ivory tower mentality.
Comments by Dean Wais and our con
tinued isolation on the Farm help to
justify this embarrassing label. We
believe that misconceptions and igno
rance about hornelessness should be
challenged through exposure and dia
logue, not through avoidance and pas
sivity.
