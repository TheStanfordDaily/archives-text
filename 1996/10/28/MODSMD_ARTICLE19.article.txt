# RAs decry recent rash of police closures of on-campus parties
## 
### 
Over the past three weeks it seems
as if the Stanford Police have been
making the rounds in Stanford's social
scene with an unprecedented effort,
shutting down parties at Sigma Chi,
Delta Kappa Epsilon, Phi Sig, Okada,
Gavilan, the Suites and Lambda Nu
and handing out minor-in-possession
citations. Stanford's parties certainly
have not become more wild than those
seen in previous years nor have Stan
ford students become more destructive

Perhaps the new tension in the social
climate has been the result of changes
in police intervention policy.
While we all agree that promoting
the general safety of students on cam
pus is necessary and legally prudent,
the means by which this is being
accomplished are likely to be more
harmful than helpful to the Stanford
community. It is with shortsightedness
that alcohol-serving parties are being
shut down by the police in an effort to
reduce the probability of unsafe and
destructive acts. The reality is that if a
campus party is shut down, the party
ing continues through other means.
Students usually choose between sever
al venues of action:
• They go off campus to another
party, one where there are no sober

monitors, fewer watchful friends and
perhaps no arrangements for a desig
nated driver.
• They take the parties behind
closed doors, successfully avoiding the
police, but also excluding resident
assistants and other watchful friends.
• They turn to more discreet means
of getting a good buzz going, mainly,
through drugs or binge drinking.
For most students, shutting down a
party does not mean that the partying
stops. It just means that they take it
somewhere else, perhaps off campus or
to a less visible place where there are
even fewer controls and safety guide
lines. Certainly an off-campus party
which involves driving poses a greater
risk to students than an on-campus
party within walking distance.

We would like to emphasize that
police intervention does much more
than end a party early; it creates a sit
uation of COMMUNITY UNDER SUS
PICION. A community under suspicion
breeds animosity toward the police,
unwise alternatives to party shutdowns
and a general lowering of campus
morale.
