# Sigma Chi names a special sweetheart
## 
### Daniel Wolk 
In a heartfelt ceremony Saturday morn
ing, members of the Sigma Chi fraternity be
stowed the honor of "sweetheart" on Marcy
Jones, the mother of their late fraternity
brother, Bart J. McCormick.
McCormick, a victim of osteogenic sarco
ma — a type of bone cancer — died July 20,

1994. He was first diagnosed with the disease
in the spring of 1990, when he was a sopho
more in high school.
McCormick planned to enroll at Stanford
in the fall of 1992, but that was postponed a
year after the cancer was found to have
spread to his lungs. He spent the next sever
al months fighting the disease with
chemotherapy and five lung surgeries.

Determined, however, to overcome the de
bilitating condition of his health, McCormick
entered Stanford in the fall of 1993 and com
pleted one year. During that year he pledged
Sigma Chi but finally surrendered to cancer
before he could be initiated.
Members of the fraternity and his pledge
class, however, inducted him
posthumously into the fraterni
ty-
Members "wrote a letter to
the national fraternity organiza
tion, and they allowed him in,"
said senior Christian Nicks, cur
rent president of Sigma Chi and
a pledge brother of McCormick.
After McCormick's death,
members of the fraternity be
came close to his mother. Jones
has kept in touch with the frater
nity since her son passed away.
"She is very sweet," Nicks
said. "She once had a plane bear
ing a message to Sigma Chi mem
bers fly above the stadium dur
ing a football game."
Saturday's ceremony took
place on the front porch of the
Sigma Chi house, behind Braun
Music Center. The ceremony
consisted of a light breakfast, a
few words by Jones and others
and the singing of the "Sweet
heart Song." New Sigma Chi
pledges stood in a circle around
Jones to sing the song, based on a

popular tune of the 19405.
"This is wonderful," said
Jones, who is married to former
Sigma Chi Jess Jones.
The sweetheart is a tradition
al honor which has been given to
many women by the fraternity.
"It is an old tradition from a
more formal time," said Sigma
Chi Keith Light, Class of '78.
Most fraternities have a similar
designation, he said.
The role of sweetheart is
merely a symbolic role, and the
chosen woman receives a pin and
an esteemed place in the frater
nity.
The term of the sweetheart's
reign is one year, but according
to Nicks, the woman is sweet
heart "for one year legally and
forever in spirit."
After being given an honorary
fraternity pin, Jones said she felt
"most honored." She described
the ceremony as "one of the
nicest gestures I have ever
known."
When asked what McCormick
would think of his own mother
being named sweetheart, Jones
replied, "Bart would be so em
barrassed."
