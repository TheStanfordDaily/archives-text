# Sigma Chi names a special sweetheart
## 
### Daniel Wolk 
In a heartfelt ceremony Saturday morn
ing, members of the Sigma Chi fraternity be
stowed the honor of "sweetheart" on Marcy
Jones, the mother of their late fraternity
brother, Bart J. McCormick.
McCormick, a victim of osteogenic sarco
ma — a type of bone cancer — died July 20,

1994. He was first diagnosed with the disease
in the spring of 1990, when he was a sopho
more in high school.
McCormick planned to enroll at Stanford
in the fall of 1992, but that was postponed a
year after the cancer was found to have
spread to his lungs. He spent the next sever
al months fighting the disease with
chemotherapy and five lung surgeries.

Determined, however, to overcome the de
bilitating condition of his health, McCormick
entered Stanford in the fall of 1993 and com
pleted one year. During that year he pledged
Sigma Chi but finally surrendered to cancer
before he could be initiated.
