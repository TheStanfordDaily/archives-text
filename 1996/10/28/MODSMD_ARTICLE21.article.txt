## Soccer teams steal victories in two doubleheaders Women end three-game skid and scoreless drought 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
With key victories over Washington State
and Washington this weekend, the Cardinal
(9-7, 4-0 Pacific 10 Conference) set itself up
as the team to beat in the Pac-10 this season
Stanford knocked off Washington State
(5-6-1, 1-3) on Friday at Maloney Field in an
overtime battle, 1-0. Senior forward Emily
Burt ended a scoreless tie when she handled
a cross from junior midfielder Rita Hermiz
and blasted the ball past the Cougar keeper
and into the lower left corner of the net.
Burt, who is a co-captain along with
senior defender Kim Houkom, almost never
had a chance to win the game for Stanford.
Late in the second half, the Cougars got off a
shot which Cardinal sophomore goalie Erin
Bryla saved. After the save, however, the
sophomore keeper lay on the ground while
the ball continued to bounce freely. A Wash
ington State player made it to the ball and
drilled it in the direction of the cage, but
senior defender Suzie Boots alertly headed
the ball over the crossbar to keep the game
scoreless.
While the win was a major momentum
builder for the team, it was costly. Stanford
freshman midfielder Ronnie Fair injured her
ankle and will be out for the remainder of
the season.
Fair was starting at sweeper for Stanford
and took most of the free kicks, including
corners. She had three goals and two assists
on the season.
"I would have rather missed all the games
before the Pac-10 ones," Fair said. "These
are the games that count, and I really wish I
could help the team."
"We will definitely feel her absence," Burt
said. "Now we're looking for (freshman)
Natalie Kim to step up, and I know she can
do it. But Ronnie is a great player and we
could sure use her."
The Cardinal was back in top form yester
day against Washington. The Huskies (8-6,
3-2) are top contenders for the conference
title but, thanks to sophomore Tracye
Lawyer's hat trick, Stanford jumped to a 3-0
lead and won the game easily 3-1.
Coach Steve Swanson said before the
game that his team would have to come out
hard against a talented and physical Husky
squad. The Cardinal did just that.
Less than 5 minutes into the game, senior
Erin Martin, who played center midfielder in
the game, played a beautiful pass past Wash
ington's last line of defense. Lawyer outran
the defense and nailed the ball on a bounce
into the right side of the netting. Husky

keeper, I ina Thompson, a club teammate of
Martin's before college, didn't have a
chance.
That was the only goal of the half, but
Stanford came out hard at the beginning of
the second period and pounded in another
goal about 5 minutes in. For the second time
it was Martin assisting Lawyer.
This time Martin found a seam in the
Husky defense and firmly pushed the ball
through it. Lawyer used her speed to get to
the ball before Thompson could and then
dribbled past the keeper before pushing the
ball into the net.
Lawyer's third goal came on a header.
Senior midfielder Stacey Cook lofted a ball
high into the goal box, and Lawyer used her
5-foot-10 frame to nail a jumping header
over the goalie and into the goal.

"This was a team thing," Lawyer said
after the game in the midst of dozens of
autograph-seeking child soccer fans. "The
first goal got our adrenaline pumping, and
then we just started getting in a rhythm. We
were playing the way we know we can, as a
team."
"We definitely needed these wins," Burt
said. "We're back on the right track now."
Indeed, the Cardinal has put itself in a
position to lock up a spot in the NCAA tour
nament. The Pac-10 champions receive an
automatic berth into the post season tour
ney.
With three tough games on the road
against UCLA, USC and California, it won't
be easy, but Stanford showed this weekend
some of the brilliance that led it to an unde
feated Pac-10 season a year ago.
