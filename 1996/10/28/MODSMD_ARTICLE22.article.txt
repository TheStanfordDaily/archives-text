# Anteaters and Gauchos prove no match for Card
## 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's soccer
team defeated two University of
California rivals this weekend to
improve its record to 7-4-4 and 3-
2-1 in the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation. The Cardinal
topped UC-Irvine 2-1 on Friday

and disposed of UC-Santa Bar
bara 3-1 yesterday.
Though the Anteaters (6-6-1,
2-3-1 MPSF) played even with
the Cardinal in the first half,
Stanford broke through in the
second half when freshman mid
fielder Aaron Jones made a beau
tiful cross to the back post to
senior striker Steve Kirschbaum,
who beat the Irvine keeper for
the score. That goal would be the
only scoring by either team, end
ing the half with Stanford ahead
1-0.
With 15 minutes remaining in
the game, sophomore midfielder
A.J. Sauer split the defense to get
a one-on-one situation with the

keeper, depositing the ball in the
left corner of the net to put the
Cardinal up 2-0.
The Anteaters staged an
anthill of a comeback with 10
minutes remaining when sopho
more defender Don Icardo beat
Stanford junior keeper Kyan
Craig. Neither team was able to
convert in the final minutes of
the game.
Stanford continued its win
ning ways yesterday by knocking
off the Gauchos (3-10-2, 1-5) 3-1
on a hat trick by sophomore mid
fielder Jamie Clark.

"The wins this weekend defi
nitely give us some confidence
going into the remaining three
games of the season," Sauer said.
"It was our goal to win the last
five games of the season, and
with two down so far, we've got
some momentum."
Jamie Clark began the scoring
just 15 minutes into the game
when he crashed the net and
received a well-placed direct kick
from Sauer which he chested,
then ripped into the net for the
goal. That would be the only scor
ing in the first half by either
team, leaving the score 1-0 in
favor of the Cardinal at intermis
sion.
The Gauchos tied the game
just minutes into the second half
when Danny Mann headed the
ball past Craig into the net. Just
5 minutes later, junior forward
Erik Morrison put a great first
touch on a pass from a Stanford
defender but was fouled in the
box, giving the Cardinal a penalty
kick. Jamie Clark put Stanford
ahead 2-1 by blasting the penalty
kick past the diving Gaucho keep
er, freshman Trent Ulicny.
With 15 minutes remaining,
Jamie Clark scored his third goal
of the day, this time hammering a
direct kick from 30 yards out into
the upper right corner of the net.
That goal gave the Cardinal a
comfortable 3-1 edge. Though the
Gauchos had a few scoring oppor
tunities as the game concluded,
the Stanford defense was able to
effectively shut them down, end
ing the game with Stanford on
top 3-1.
The two victories this week
end come after a string of disap
pointing games in which the Car
dinal has played its opponents
well but has been unable to come
away with the victory.
"There is a fine line between
winning and losing," Stanford
coach Bobby Clark said of the
difference this weekend. "We've
been in every game this season,
but this weekend we were able to
get on the board first and were
able to play smart and control
the number of opportunities we
gave up to our opponents. We
are definitely playing smarter
than we were earlier in the sea
son."
Stanford next takes on Bay
Area rival San Jose State
Wednesday at 2 p.m. on Maloney
Field.
