# Sun Devils pound out easy 41-9 win
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The train whistles you heard coming from Stan
ford Stadium on Saturday afternoon were not, as
advertised, the Cardinal getting on the right track.
It was the steamroller better known as the Arizona
State Sun Devils.
The fourth-ranked Sun Devils (8-0 overall, 5-0
Pacific 10 Conference) lived up to their billing in
delivering Stanford (2-5, 1-3) an old-fashioned 41-
9 bludgeoning and maintained an unblemished
record in their quest for a Rose Bowl berth.
Arizona State put the game out of reach with
two touchdown scores in the first 5 minutes of the
second half. After Heisman Trophy candidate Jake
Plummer hooked up with wide receiver Keith
Poole seven times for 106 yards in the first half (all
in the opening quarter), the Sun Devils went
almost exclusively to the run to open the second
half, rushing eight times for 54 yards and a touch
down on the drive.
Moments later, the Sun Devils found them
selves with another opportunity to punch it in
when true freshman quarterback Todd Husak,
substituting for an injured sophomore Chad
Hutchinson, was intercepted at the Stanford 40-
yard line by Sun Devil cornerback Courtney Jack
son. Three plays later, Plummer ran for a 4-yard
score of his own, and the rout was on with the Sun
Devils up 35-9.
"In the third quarter, our goal was to go out and
stop them and get a chance to get some momen
tum, get something going, put a score on the board
and make it a real ball game where we've got a
chance to really get into it," said Stanford coach
Tyrone Willingham. "Unfortunately, we were
unable to do that."
The two quick strikes were especially back
breaking for the Cardinal, who had pulled to with
in 21-9 after being down by three touchdowns in
the first quarter.
After Hutchinson went down with a sprained
thumb in the second quarter, Husak came on in
his second series to put together an 89-yard touch
down drive of his own capped by a 45-yard strike to
senior tight end Greg Clark. Stanford ended the
half with a 27-yard field goal by junior place-kick
er Kevin Miller after the defense, which held Ari
zona State to just 54 net rushing yards in the first
half, forced Plummer and company off after three
plays.
"Things were going real well for me in the first
half," Husak said. "I was real calm, and I was see
ing things real clear. I felt real good at halftime,
real confident. But they made some adjustments,
and we weren't able to overcome those and that s
football. We weren't able to make some plays, and
I made some bad decisions."
Another Husak interception in the third quar
ter gave the Sun Devils favorable field position,
which they used to their advantage in the name of
a Robert Nycz field goal from 27 yards out.
"We continually seemed to shoot ourselves in
the foot with different penalties and different

things that we did," Willinghnm said.
A 25-yarder from Nycz pushed the lead to the
final margin.
The Arizona State offense was a model of effi
ciency on Saturday as it has been all season long.
After failing in the red zone for the first time all
season in the first half, the Sun Devils scored on
their next seven trips inside the Stanford 20, with
five touchdowns and two field goals. While Plum
mer threw for 316 yards and two touchdowns, the
running game resurfaced in the second half to fin
ish with 175 yards for the contest.
"I think the combination that they place on you
gradually has a tendency to force you to play a lot
of areas, and it opens up the ability to allow them
to do some things," Wtllingham said of the bal
anced Arizona State attack.
The Sun Devils also turned four Cardinal
turnovers into a total of 24 points. In addition to
