# Sun Devils pound out easy 41-9 win
## 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The train whistles you heard coming from Stan
ford Stadium on Saturday afternoon were not, as
advertised, the Cardinal getting on the right track.
It was the steamroller better known as the Arizona
State Sun Devils.
The fourth-ranked Sun Devils (8-0 overall, 5-0
Pacific 10 Conference) lived up to their billing in
delivering Stanford (2-5, 1-3) an old-fashioned 41-
9 bludgeoning and maintained an unblemished
record in their quest for a Rose Bowl berth.
Arizona State put the game out of reach with
two touchdown scores in the first 5 minutes of the
second half. After Heisman Trophy candidate Jake
Plummer hooked up with wide receiver Keith
Poole seven times for 106 yards in the first half (all
in the opening quarter), the Sun Devils went
almost exclusively to the run to open the second
half, rushing eight times for 54 yards and a touch
down on the drive.
Moments later, the Sun Devils found them
selves with another opportunity to punch it in
when true freshman quarterback Todd Husak,
substituting for an injured sophomore Chad
Hutchinson, was intercepted at the Stanford 40-
yard line by Sun Devil cornerback Courtney Jack
son. Three plays later, Plummer ran for a 4-yard
score of his own, and the rout was on with the Sun
Devils up 35-9.
"In the third quarter, our goal was to go out and
stop them and get a chance to get some momen
tum, get something going, put a score on the board
and make it a real ball game where we've got a
chance to really get into it," said Stanford coach
Tyrone Willingham. "Unfortunately, we were
unable to do that."
The two quick strikes were especially back
breaking for the Cardinal, who had pulled to with
in 21-9 after being down by three touchdowns in
the first quarter.
After Hutchinson went down with a sprained
thumb in the second quarter, Husak came on in
his second series to put together an 89-yard touch
down drive of his own capped by a 45-yard strike to
senior tight end Greg Clark. Stanford ended the
half with a 27-yard field goal by junior place-kick
er Kevin Miller after the defense, which held Ari
zona State to just 54 net rushing yards in the first
half, forced Plummer and company off after three
plays.
"Things were going real well for me in the first
half," Husak said. "I was real calm, and I was see
ing things real clear. I felt real good at halftime,
real confident. But they made some adjustments,
and we weren't able to overcome those and that s
football. We weren't able to make some plays, and
I made some bad decisions."
Another Husak interception in the third quar
ter gave the Sun Devils favorable field position,
which they used to their advantage in the name of
a Robert Nycz field goal from 27 yards out.
"We continually seemed to shoot ourselves in
the foot with different penalties and different

things that we did," Willinghnm said.
A 25-yarder from Nycz pushed the lead to the
final margin.
The Arizona State offense was a model of effi
ciency on Saturday as it has been all season long.
After failing in the red zone for the first time all
season in the first half, the Sun Devils scored on
their next seven trips inside the Stanford 20, with
five touchdowns and two field goals. While Plum
mer threw for 316 yards and two touchdowns, the
running game resurfaced in the second half to fin
ish with 175 yards for the contest.
"I think the combination that they place on you
gradually has a tendency to force you to play a lot
of areas, and it opens up the ability to allow them
to do some things," Wtllingham said of the bal
anced Arizona State attack.
The Sun Devils also turned four Cardinal
turnovers into a total of 24 points. In addition to

Husak's turnovers, Hutchinson
threw one of his own and fum
bled under pressure from the
Sun Devil defense.
"The sequence of events in the
first half really put us behind,"
Willingham said. "Our turn
overs, our inability to get good
field position and their ability to
score when they had the oppor
tunities placed us in a difficult
situation. One of the things you
cannot do against a very good
football team, which they are, is
get behind."
Husak looked good in the first
half, completing 9 of 13 attempts
for 100 yards, but the Arizona
State defense gave him some dif
ferent looks coming out of inter
mission.
"In the second half I made
some bad decisions, some bad
reads," Husak said. "They start
ed bringing up some more sec
ondary blitzes, and their guys up
front did a really .good job in the
second half. We weren't able to
adjust to those until later and
that threw us off a little bit."
The Cardinal offense stalled
after its two lone second-quarter
scores. In the second half, Stan
ford gained a total of just 93
yards and only 20 on the ground.
In fact, the Cardinal offense did
not earn a first down in the sec
ond half until under the 7-
minute mark of the fourth quar
ter, when the game was well out
of reach.
"They just made some big
plays and stepped it up when
they needed to," said senior
defensive end Bryan Werner.
"They are the toast of the Pac
-10. When you play a team of that
caliber, you really see how you
stack up. We are not there yet,
but I'd be lying if I said I didn't
see the potential for this team."
Hutchinson's status for next
week's contest against UCLA (3-
4, 2-2), which handed California
(5-2, 2-2) its second conference
loss in a row on Saturday, has
yet to be determined.
The loss dropped Stanford into
the role of spoiler for its four
remaining games. The Sun Dev
ils, on the other hand, are looking
to run the table with away games

at Oregon State and Arizona and
at home against the Bears.
While a bowl game may be out
of reach for Stanford, the Cardi
nal still has some big dates on the
schedule with Big Game looming
and Pac-10 contests with its
Southern California rivals.
"I'd really like to finish this
out with four wins and sweep the
state of California," Werner said.
"That was one of our goals com
ing into this season. Everything
is not out of the window yet for
us. We still have some big goals
left to accomplish."

almost exclusively to the run to open the second
half, rushing eight times for 54 yards and a touch
down on the drive.
Moments later, the Sun Devils found them
selves with another opportunity to punch it in
when true freshman quarterback Todd Husak,
substituting for an injured sophomore Chad
Hutchinson, was intercepted at the Stanford 40-
yard line by Sun Devil cornerback Courtney Jack
son. Three plays later, Plummer ran for a 4-yard
score of his own, and the rout was on with the Sun
Devils up 35-9.
"In the third quarter, our goal was to go out and
stop them and get a chance to get some momen
tum, get something going, put a score on the board
and make it a real ball game where we've got a
chance to really get into it," said Stanford coach
Tyrone Willingham. "Unfortunately, we were
unable to do that."
The two quick strikes were especially back
breaking for the Cardinal, who had pulled to with
in 21-9 after being down by three touchdowns in
the first quarter.
After Hutchinson went down with a sprained
thumb in the second quarter, Husak came on in
his second series to put together an 89-yard touch
down drive of his own capped by a 45-yard strike to
senior tight end Greg Clark. Stanford ended the
half with a 27-yard field goal by junior place-kick
er Kevin Miller after the defense, which held Ari
zona State to just 54 net rushing yards in the first
half, forced Plummer and company off after three
plays.
"Things were going real well for me in the first
half," Husak said. "I was real calm, and I was see
ing things real clear. I felt real good at halftime,
real confident. But they made some adjustments,
and we weren't able to overcome those and that s
football. We weren't able to make some plays, and
I made some bad decisions."
Another Husak interception in the third quar
ter gave the Sun Devils favorable field position,
which they used to their advantage in the name of
a Robert Nycz field goal from 27 yards out.
"We continually seemed to shoot ourselves in
the foot with different penalties and different

things that we did," Willinghnm said.
A 25-yarder from Nycz pushed the lead to the
final margin.
The Arizona State offense was a model of effi
ciency on Saturday as it has been all season long.
After failing in the red zone for the first time all
season in the first half, the Sun Devils scored on
their next seven trips inside the Stanford 20, with
five touchdowns and two field goals. While Plum
mer threw for 316 yards and two touchdowns, the
running game resurfaced in the second half to fin
ish with 175 yards for the contest.
"I think the combination that they place on you
gradually has a tendency to force you to play a lot
of areas, and it opens up the ability to allow them
to do some things," Wtllingham said of the bal
anced Arizona State attack.
The Sun Devils also turned four Cardinal
turnovers into a total of 24 points. In addition to

Husak's turnovers, Hutchinson
threw one of his own and fum
bled under pressure from the
Sun Devil defense.
"The sequence of events in the
first half really put us behind,"
Willingham said. "Our turn
overs, our inability to get good
field position and their ability to
score when they had the oppor
tunities placed us in a difficult
situation. One of the things you
cannot do against a very good
football team, which they are, is
get behind."
Husak looked good in the first
half, completing 9 of 13 attempts
for 100 yards, but the Arizona
State defense gave him some dif
ferent looks coming out of inter
mission.
"In the second half I made
some bad decisions, some bad
reads," Husak said. "They start
ed bringing up some more sec
ondary blitzes, and their guys up
front did a really .good job in the
second half. We weren't able to
adjust to those until later and
that threw us off a little bit."
The Cardinal offense stalled
after its two lone second-quarter
scores. In the second half, Stan
ford gained a total of just 93
yards and only 20 on the ground.
In fact, the Cardinal offense did
not earn a first down in the sec
ond half until under the 7-
minute mark of the fourth quar
ter, when the game was well out
of reach.
"They just made some big
plays and stepped it up when
they needed to," said senior
defensive end Bryan Werner.
"They are the toast of the Pac
-10. When you play a team of that
caliber, you really see how you
stack up. We are not there yet,
but I'd be lying if I said I didn't
see the potential for this team."
Hutchinson's status for next
week's contest against UCLA (3-
4, 2-2), which handed California
(5-2, 2-2) its second conference
loss in a row on Saturday, has
yet to be determined.
The loss dropped Stanford into
the role of spoiler for its four
remaining games. The Sun Dev
ils, on the other hand, are looking
to run the table with away games

at Oregon State and Arizona and
at home against the Bears.
While a bowl game may be out
of reach for Stanford, the Cardi
nal still has some big dates on the
schedule with Big Game looming
and Pac-10 contests with its
Southern California rivals.
"I'd really like to finish this
out with four wins and sweep the
state of California," Werner said.
"That was one of our goals com
ing into this season. Everything
is not out of the window yet for
us. We still have some big goals
left to accomplish."

True freshman Todd Husak took over the quarterback duties early in the game as a first-quarter injury
sidelined starter Chad Hutchinson.
The train whistles you heard coming from Stan
ford Stadium on Saturday afternoon were not, as
advertised, the Cardinal getting on the right track.
It was the steamroller better known as the Arizona
State Sun Devils.
The fourth-ranked Sun Devils (8-0 overall, 5-0
Pacific 10 Conference) lived up to their billing in
delivering Stanford (2-5, 1-3) an old-fashioned 41-
9 bludgeoning and maintained an unblemished
record in their quest for a Rose Bowl berth.
Arizona State put the game out of reach with
two touchdown scores in the first 5 minutes of the
second half. After Heisman Trophy candidate Jake
Plummer hooked up with wide receiver Keith
Poole seven times for 106 yards in the first half (all
in the opening quarter), the Sun Devils went
almost exclusively to the run to open the second
half, rushing eight times for 54 yards and a touch
down on the drive.
