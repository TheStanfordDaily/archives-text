# Plummer, Poole are great pair

Judging from the paltry
attendance at Stanford Stadi
um on Saturday, it seems
apparent that most Stanford
fans were expecting a
blowout and simply didn't
want to watch the fourth
ranked Sun Devils dismantle
the Cardinal.
Though you might think
that the absentee Cardinal
fans were the smart ones and
didn't miss out on anything
in the 41-9 Arizona State vic
tory, they did miss an oppor
tunity to see Jake Plummer
and Keith Poole, the best
quarterback / wide receiver
tandem this side of Florida.
Coming into the game,
Plummer had already com
pleted 128 of 205 passes this
season for 1,941 yards and 19
touchdowns but has continu
ally been overshadowed in
the national media by the
likes of Florida's Danny
Wuerffel and Tennessee's
Peyton Manning. The Cardi
nal, however, found out Sat
urday just how good Plum
mer is.
"I thought the same things
after the ball game that I
thought prior to the ball
game," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "I
said that {Plummer] is one of
the best quarterbacks that we
would face. He's talented, he
understands their system
and he makes things hap
pen."
Plummer proved Willing
ham right early on in the
game, leading the Sun Devils
on three first-quarter scoring
drives â€” two of which culmi
nated in Plummer touch
down passes.
The Heisman hopeful did
not let up, either, and fin
ished the game 21 of 34 for
316 yards, two touchdowns
and just one interception. It
is not only Plummer's pass
ing ability, though, that
makes him one of the best
