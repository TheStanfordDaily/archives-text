# Plummer, Poole are great pair
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
Judging from the paltry
attendance at Stanford Stadi
um on Saturday, it seems
apparent that most Stanford
fans were expecting a
blowout and simply didn't
want to watch the fourth
ranked Sun Devils dismantle
the Cardinal.
Though you might think
that the absentee Cardinal
fans were the smart ones and
didn't miss out on anything
in the 41-9 Arizona State vic
tory, they did miss an oppor
tunity to see Jake Plummer
and Keith Poole, the best
quarterback / wide receiver
tandem this side of Florida.
Coming into the game,
Plummer had already com
pleted 128 of 205 passes this
season for 1,941 yards and 19
touchdowns but has continu
ally been overshadowed in
the national media by the
likes of Florida's Danny
Wuerffel and Tennessee's
Peyton Manning. The Cardi
nal, however, found out Sat
urday just how good Plum
mer is.
"I thought the same things
after the ball game that I
thought prior to the ball
game," said Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "I
said that {Plummer] is one of
the best quarterbacks that we
would face. He's talented, he
understands their system
and he makes things hap
pen."
Plummer proved Willing
ham right early on in the
game, leading the Sun Devils
on three first-quarter scoring
drives — two of which culmi
nated in Plummer touch
down passes.
The Heisman hopeful did
not let up, either, and fin
ished the game 21 of 34 for
316 yards, two touchdowns
and just one interception. It
is not only Plummer's pass
ing ability, though, that
makes him one of the best
quarterbacks in the game today.
"It's a defensive back's night
mare to have a quarterback who
can throw the ball as well as he
can and run and scramble," said
senior Cardinal cornerback Alis
tair White.
Indeed, it is Plummer's abili
ty to scramble and buy himself
time in the pocket that makes
him so effective. Many times on
Saturday, Plummer scrambled
and allowed his receivers to have
extra time to get open.
"As a defensive back it's the
worst type of thing to have a
quarterback be able to scramble
like [Plummer] can because the
play is never over," White said.
"You think you have your man
covered, and when you look back
to see what the quarterback is
doing, he's airing out the ball or
scrambling around."
Stanford tried to mix up some
defensive schemes to attempt to
slow down the Plummer attack,
but nothing seemed to work.
"We tried to collapse the
pocket on him, and he got out
and scrambled," said Cardinal
senior free safety Josh Madsen.
"He's a great athlete, a great
competitor, and he adds a
dimension to their team that not
many other teams have."
The other half of the tandem is
wide receiver Keith Poole, a
senior who, over the last four sea
sons, has become one of the most
dangerous receivers in the nation.
Poole, who leads the Sun Dev
ils in receptions (38), yards
receiving (661) and touchdown
catches (9), used the Cardinal

defense to add to his impressive
numbers. In the first quarter
alone, Poole pulled in seven
receptions for 106 yards.
"We knew that we had to
respect his abilities coming in,
and he proved today that he's a
really good receiver," said Mad
sen, who has played against
Poole since high school.
Poole finished the game with
10 catches for 161 yards and
never really had to work that
hard for his catches. It is not
necessarily his athletic ability,
though, that makes him an
effective receiver.
Poole is "a good receiver —
you can't take anything away
from him," White said. "He and
Plummer have a good system,
and they know where the other
is going to be and where to put
the ball."
Both Plummer and Poole
have been Cardinal killers over
the years. Despite losing to Stan
ford last year, Plummer has
pulled out some last-minute vic
tories over the Cardinal in
recent years.
"I remember when we played
them [in 19941, and they con
verted four fourth downs to beat
us," said senior defensive end
Bryan Werner. "Plummer's just
a great player and competitor,
and he makes plays happen."
Plummer did, in fact, make a
lot of things happen on Satur
day, as did Poole, his favorite
receiver. However, most of you
probably missed the game and
still haven't seen the duo play.
Fear not, though, you'll get
another chance to see them on
television — most likely on Jan.
1, when they march into the
Rose Bowl to take on the Big 10
champion.
