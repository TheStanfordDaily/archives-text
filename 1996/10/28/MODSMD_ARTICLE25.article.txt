# Bruins' late scoring takes care of the Card
## 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
The third-ranked Cardinal
faced No. 2 UCLA yesterday,
and with 2 minutes, 11 seconds
to play everything was in order
for an upset as Stanford (12-4,
3-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) led 6-4.
But UCLA (17-1, 3-0), despite
playing an exhausting overtime
game against No. 4 California
Saturday, rallied to score three
quick goals and pull out the win
7-6 at deGuerre Pool.
With two teams that match
up so well in the offensive end of
the pool, the outcome of the
game proved to be determined
by defensive play.
Stanford sophomore goalie
Chris Aguilera and UCLA senior
cage man Matt Swanson proved
to be nearly unbeatable in the
first half, as just four goals were
scored.
Though each team had oppor

tunities early, UCLA managed
to capitalize first and carried a
3-1 lead into the locker room
after two quarters.
But Stanford kept pressing at
the offensive end, and goals
from senior holeman Brian
Wallin and sophomore forward
David Hay tied the game at 3-3
with 1:17 to play in the half.
That looked to be how the
quarter would come to a close,
but sophomore Arturo Rodelo
surprised Swanson. nailing a
cross-goal skip shot with just 20
seconds remaining to give Stan
ford its first lead of the game, 4-
3.
UCLA senior Corbin Graham
responded for the Bruins with a
goal early in the fourth quarter
to knot the game at 4-4.
Wallin gave Stanford another
lead just two minutes later, con
verting on a penalty shot to
make it 5-4.
The Cardinal looked to be
near victory when sophomore

holeman Crosby Grant added an
insurance goal on a tremendous
cross-goal shot.
Unfortunately, that was
when the Cardinal defense
began to crumble under the
weight of UCLA's attack

Just 6 seconds after Grant's
tally made it 6-4, UCLA's Steve
Covec beat Aguilera to make it 6-
5.
Stanford quickly turned the
ball over on its next possession,
and UCLA made the most of it,
scoring again to tie it 6-6 with
1:41 to play.
UCLA completed the aston
ishing comeback when senior
Randy Wright scored the game
winner with just 1:05 remain
ing.
The Cardinal had a final
opportunity to score, but
UCLA's defense proved solid,
and the Card did not manage
another shot attempt.
"We had a 3-minute lapse on
defense," Wallin said. "They
managed to capitalize on each
mistake, and it cost us the
game."
That proved to be the deter
mining factor, as UCLA made
better use of its chances on
offense, especially when it was
up a man.
"We scored on just two of our
10 man-up situations," head
coach Dante Dettamanti said
"UCLA scored on four of their
eight. That's the difference in
the game right there."
As frustrating as the outcome
of the game may be for the team,
captain Wallin remained posi
tive.
"Aguilera had a great game,"
Wallin said "The game showed
for us that we can definitely pla>
with them. We just need to capi
talize on our opportunities anc
avoid mistakes on defense."
