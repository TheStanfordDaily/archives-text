# A 						kiss is not just a kiss
## Alternative 'Full Moon' is successful 
### Kelly E. Young Contributing writer 
Another year, another Full Moon on the
Quad. Saturday night was once again a time
for seniors to transform freshmen into full
fledged Stanford men and women.
However, this year marked a new twist
to the tradition. The Lesbian, Gay and Bi
sexual Community Center sponsored
Queer Moon on the Quad, a homosexual
and bisexual alternative to the primarily
heterosexual Full Moon on the Quad.
The center held Queer Moon on the
Quad directly in front of Memorial Church
while the rest of the students were spread
from the church to the center of the Quad.
This year's homosexual and bisexual
freshmen may already be seeing some of the
same benefits as their heterosexual coun
terparts, said some participants in Queer
Moon on the Quad.
"Now, in my mind, I'm a true man," said
freshman Nick Kelley.
Participants admitted not everyone in
volved in the event was a freshman or se
nior.

"It's all about playing with gender iden
tity," said sophomore Brad Anderson. "It's
also about playing with class identity. You
can be a senior, or you can be a freshman."
Several participants wore stickers read
ing "Queer Senior / Frosh." Others simply
donned pink triangles or rainbow stickers on
their jackets, denoting their homosexuality.
Kelley said he had not experienced any
negative feedback from the rest of the het
erosexual population in the Quad.
"I [was! all ready to be a victim of a hate
crime," Kelley said. "There's strength in
numbers. I'msoglad the community's here
for me."
Community Center Program Coordina
tor Rene Zermeno, a junior, admitted
Queer Moon on the Quad was not a com
pletely new idea.
"We've done it in the past, but it hasn't
been as hyped as this year," Zermeno said.
Anderson remembered the low-key at
mosphere of last year's gathering.
"We were able to find each other without
any organization," Anderson explained.
This year, however, Zermeno
said he was approached by sever
al freshmen who expressed
some concern about the hetero
sexual tradition and wanted to
see "that they can partake in it
as queers."
Being more open may have
brought even more freshmen to
the event than before.
"I didn't hear about it; I saw

it," Kelley said as he pointed to
the group's "Kiss Me. I'm Queer"
banner.
Zermeno added he was pleased
with this year's turn out.
"A lot of freshman showed
up, and they're smiling," he
said.
Zermeno said the center in
tends to plan a similar event
next year. "It's just going to
keep growing," he said.
Earlier in the evening, about
eight people rode bicycles naked
through the Quad while the dance
group, JAM PAC'D, performed.
