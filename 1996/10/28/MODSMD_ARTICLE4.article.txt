### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
Maurice Grossman, professor emeritus
of psychiatry at the School of Medicine, died
Oct. 19 at Stanford Hospital. He was 88.
Grossman began his longtime affilia
tion with the Stanford Medical Center in
1952, working for the school in conjunc
tion with his private psychiatry practice in
Palo Alto. For many years, he helped lead
an effort to protect doctor-patient confi
dentiality, writing extensively on the sub
ject and testifying regularly at Congres
sional hearings.
He was a past president of the Nort hern
California Psychiatric Association and was
honored with that group's lifetime out
standing achievement award in 1983.
Grossman loved teaching and did it
well, according to Clinical Prof. Emeritus
Frank Matsumoto, one of his former col

leagues. He called Grossman "the teacher
of teachers."
"He had that quality of being able to ar
ticulate ideas in a way that you could feel
and accept," Matsumoto said.
Another former colleague, Psychiatry
Prof. Randy Weingarten, concurred, saying
that Grossman was kind and benevolent
with younger people. As a Stanford student
in the 19705, Weingarten found Grossman
to be a firm, unyielding teacher.
"We loved him, but we had a lot of trou
ble with him, too," he said. "He was difficult
to argue with."
Matsumoto remembered Grossman as a
man who gave freely of his time and energy.
In particular, he recalled Grossman's
part in the fight to include an in-patient
psychiatric ward in the Stanford Hospital
when it was constructed in the 19605.
Though such a ward was included
in the original plans for the Medical
Center, it was left out of the final
building.
His actions in that case and in
the fight to help preserve doctor-pa
tient confidentiality were bold and
slightly controversial, Matsumoto
said, calling Grossman "powerfully
supportive and a leader in the com

munity.
Born in Philadelphia in 1907,
Grossman was the son of Jewish
immigrants from Russia and
Poland. His family moved to
Mebane, N.C., when he was a teen
ager, and Grossman entered the
University of North Carolina-
Chapel Hill at age 16.
He is survived by his four chil
dren, 10 grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren. In lieu of do
nations, his family has requested
that parents tell their children they
love them.
