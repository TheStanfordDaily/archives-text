# A 						shaky bridge
## Presidential candidates quiet on research, higher education 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Whether Bill Clinton builds his
bridge to the 21st century or Bob
Dole constructs his to "an America
that only the unknowing call
myth," the bridge connecting high
er education, financial aid and uni
versity research to the future may
be a shaky one.
While both candidates propose
similar programs which may lead to
more students enrolling in college,
neither ofTers concrete plans on
how to curb the increasing scarcity
of federal research money.
Without such plans, Stanford of
ficials are worried about the possi
ble negative impact on university
research.
Clinton's official campaign

statement on
"Improving Ed
ucation" does
not mention his
position on re
search. And
while Dole's
campaign litera
ture says he "has
been a champion

of scientific research at our univer
sities . . . throughout his years in
Congress," it does not indicate how
he will deal with this issue if he is
elected president
However, both candidates favor
balancing the budget by the year
2002, a stand which may hurt re
search funding.
"Whatever party you back, the

problems [in funding research] are
with balancing the budget," said
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare, who
also chairs the National Science
Board.
"Both parties have agreed that
issues like defense and entitlements
are off the table, so that only leaves
the discretionary domestic budget,
where research funding comes
from, to be cut," Zare explained. "If
this attitude holds after the election,
it will be a bad time for science."
Physics Prof. Doug Osheroff re
cipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in
physics, said he is scared of what he
deems inevitable cuts in the discre
tionary budget.
"There is no question, if you
look at the projections for funding,
that research is going to be in line
for a big hurt," Osheroff said. He
said that by the year 2002, esti
mates of funding cuts range from 5
percent to 20 percent.
While other Stanford authori
ties were wary of supporting either

candidate in view of both men's
noncommittal stances, Osheroff
said he signed a letter endorsing
Clinton for president.
He attacked Dole's across-the
board tax cut as "completely unre
alistic" and damaging to research
funding, but he was not wholly en
thusiastic about Clinton's record
either.
"I do not appreciate all that the
Democrats have done," Osheroff
said. "They have taken money from
basic research and redirected it into
short-term applied research. ''
Osheroff described basic re
search as "contributing to the
knowledge of the nature of the uni
verse," while applied research is
"more limited" in scope. He added
that basic research is more impor
tant in the long run for the ad
vancement of science.
Osheroff also pointed out that
Republicans aim to dissolve the De
partment of Energy, which pro
vides many research grants to uni
versities around the country. He
said this loss would put a "tremen
dous strain on all researchers."
How these cuts will affect Stan
ford's own research programs is

still in doubt. According to Dean of
Earth Sciences Franklin Orr, Stan
ford should fare well, but how well
cannot be predicted.
"We like to think we can com
pete in any funding environment,"
Orr said. "However, when there is
no funding out there, we will feel
the effects."
Orr added that neither presi
dential candidate might make
much of a difference in the future
of research funding because "it's a
combination of the administration
and the Congress who make the de
cisions."
This difficulty in distinguishing
between candidates stretches be
yond the field of research into other
areas of higher education, namely
financial aid.
Clinton will offer tax credits of
up to $3,000 for entering college
students, increase Pell Grant val
ues by $170 and give tax deduc
tions on up to $10,000 worth of tu
ition.
Dole does not offer this deduc
tion, but he also favors the Pell
Grant increases and a variation on
the tax credit for college tuition
which would essentially equal the

$3,000 that Clinton proposes.
According to Economics Prof.
John Taylor, who also serves as
Dole's chief economic adviser, Dole
will offer an initial $500 credit and
then will allow an additional $500
to be saved tax-free each year for up
to five years.
"If you add up all these credits,
you will get $3,000, the same
amount Clinton is offering, just in
another fashion," Taylor said.
Taylor added that both candi
dates promote student loans, with
Dole favoring privately funded
loans and Clinton favoring govern
ment-backed loans.
"Although they differ in who's
making the loans, the total amount
of money being offered will proba
bly not be different," Taylor said.
According to Dean of Under
graduate Admissions and Finan
cial Aid James Montoya, students
will probably not benefit from the
proposals.
"Federal grants represent ap
proximately 8 percent of our schol
arship / grant aid budget; thus in
creased Pell grant values will not
have a significant impact on our
budget," Montoya said.
