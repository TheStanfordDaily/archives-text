Three years and 100 hours of"
footage later, a movie telling the
story of East Palo Alto through the
eyes of its own people has pre
miered.
More than 300 people from East
Palo Alto and surroundingcommu
nities filled the Ravenswood School
District's Cesar Chavez Academy
auditorium on Saturday night for
the first showing of a documentary
of the history of East Palo Alto.
"Dreams of a City: Creating
East Palo Alto," a collaboration be
tween Stanford and a task force in

East Palo Alto, was three years in
the making.
The documentary was co-pro
duced by Stanford's Committee on
Black Performing Arts and the
Stanford Libraries Academic Soft
ware Development Department. It
is the first of itkind to portray the
city's rich history and culture by
zooming in on the naked voices of
its diverse residents.
The East Palo Alto Project Task
Force, an advisory and resource
group of residents of the East Palo
Alto area and Stanford faculty,
staff and students, worked with the
Stanford groups to create the docu
mentary.
Unlike the prevalent media cov
erage that has focused on the low
income city's high crime, drug and
violence rates, "Dreams" walks its
viewers through the rich but dis
tressed history of East Palo Alto
with lively oral clips and colorful
scenes from cultural events.
Production of "Dreams" began
in 1993 with a partnership between
Michael Levin of academic soft
ware development, also the produc
er and director of "Dreams," and
Assoc. Drama Prof. Harry Elam,
the director of the Committee on
Black Performing Arts.
At the time, Levin was working
on a project involving what he saw
as East Palo Alto's wish to evolve
into a more stable community.

Elam had already started work on
several projects to reveal the city's
historical and regional dynamics.
"It feels really good," Elam said
at the premiere. "The great
turnout makes the effort of three
years to make the film worthwhile.
It reconfirms the fact that art can
make a difference, culturally and
socially, in a variety of different
ways."
The film goes back to the city's
settlement, including its agricul
tural and industrial stages, and ex
amines its history of regional in
equality, poverty, crime and drug
use through the eyes of residents
of various ages and backgrounds.
In the film, members of "Just
Us" proudly recalled their efforts to
physically occupy the street cor
ners to eliminate drug deals.
The group got together in the
1980s to take matters into its own
hands when the city was so crime
stricken that, in the words of a res
ident speaking in the documentary,

"You couldn't buy socks but could
buy drugs, guns and alcohol any
where."
Approximately a dozen Stanford
students were involved in the mak
ing of "Dreams," particularly in the
early stages of research, Levin said.
"It's been a lot of work, lots of
difficulties and day-to-day hard
ships," Levin said. "But it is differ
ent [watching the film) with an au
dience. It is a great feeling; it's ex
citing to get [the film] out there."
According to Levin, one of the
major tasks he faced was reducing
more than 100 hours of footage
into a cohesive one-hour story.
"There's no real way to trans
late the community on film,"
Levin said. "We did the best we
could, but there's a lot we left out.
A community is vast."
According to Stanford Li
braries Technical Manager Bar
bara Maliska, director of academ
ic software development and exec
utive producer of "Dreams,"

everyone had a lot to gain from
the Film-making process.
"We fell in love with this com
munity," she said. The movie "ed
ucated us [about] how rich East
Palo Alto is, and it was just impos
sible not to emotionally embrace
this community."
Although "Dreams" was origi
nally intended to be an archive of
oral history, it evolved into an
hour-long documentary.
"We just got deeper and deeper
into it, and before we knew it, we
were making a film," Maliska
said.
According to Kim Fowler, the
narrator of the film as well as the
program and fund-raising consul
tant for the Committee on Black
Performing Arts, the film will give
East Palo Alto children a sense of
identity.
"Definitely we will have it in
our library; definitely it will be
made available to the communi
ty," Fowler said.
