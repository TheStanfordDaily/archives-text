## Band accordionists add a quirky note to an ensemble that's already wacky

Accordion players have their own special place in
Hell — and at Stanford.
Mike Carter, Class of' 93, and junior Chris Saccheri
add another note of originality to the Stanford Band,
amid the sweet harmony and cacophony of instrumen
tal antics.
Since 1989, Carter has been an active member of the
Band. "I started drinking and then began playing
shortly thereafter," he said.
"I played the tenor sax for a few years," Carter said.
"Senior year, I became horribly sick on the ski trip. I
couldn't play for a while. Then I remembered the
musty old accordion in my grandfather's storage shed."
Carter tore through spider webs and memories to
find the accordion, in all its wheezing glory.
"I had played around with it as a kid, but I was too
small. Before, I used gravity to compress the bellows
and played with the keys on top. So I wasted winter
break learning how to play by ear."
Carter breathed new life into the lungs of the
squeezebox — by spring quarter, the accordion was
rocking along with the Band.
"My first song was 'Limelight,' by Rush. I modified
the part for the tenor sax and created a new part for the
accordion."
Reaction from the Band was muted. "No one could
hear me," Carter said.
The power of the accordion was soon experienced
through other sensory modes.
"No one ever searches the accordion," Carter ex
plained. "The instrument expands and can come apart.
It could, say, be filled with ice and beer. Of course, we'd
never do that at a home game."
Carter was alone in his musical odyssey until Sac
cheri came onto the scene.
"After chasing the band during Orientation, I decid
ed that I wanted to join," Saccheri said. "But I didn't
know how to play an instrument. So instead I took the
safe route and auditioned for Gaieties."
One of Saccheri's favorite memories of the experi
ence was dancing with the Band at the end of every
show. "That and wearing my Forrest Gump suit," he
said.
Saccheri saw Carter playing the accordion at a fall
football game and realized his destiny.
"I wanted to play the accordion," Saccheri said, "and
his presence confirmed that the Band would accept it."
Saccheri bided his time and then pounced upon an
