## Band accordionists add a quirky note to an ensemble that's already wacky 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
Accordion players have their own special place in
Hell — and at Stanford.
Mike Carter, Class of' 93, and junior Chris Saccheri
add another note of originality to the Stanford Band,
amid the sweet harmony and cacophony of instrumen
tal antics.
Since 1989, Carter has been an active member of the
Band. "I started drinking and then began playing
shortly thereafter," he said.
"I played the tenor sax for a few years," Carter said.
"Senior year, I became horribly sick on the ski trip. I
couldn't play for a while. Then I remembered the
musty old accordion in my grandfather's storage shed."
Carter tore through spider webs and memories to
find the accordion, in all its wheezing glory.
"I had played around with it as a kid, but I was too
small. Before, I used gravity to compress the bellows
and played with the keys on top. So I wasted winter
break learning how to play by ear."
Carter breathed new life into the lungs of the
squeezebox — by spring quarter, the accordion was
rocking along with the Band.
"My first song was 'Limelight,' by Rush. I modified
the part for the tenor sax and created a new part for the
accordion."
Reaction from the Band was muted. "No one could
hear me," Carter said.
The power of the accordion was soon experienced
through other sensory modes.
"No one ever searches the accordion," Carter ex
plained. "The instrument expands and can come apart.
It could, say, be filled with ice and beer. Of course, we'd
never do that at a home game."
Carter was alone in his musical odyssey until Sac
cheri came onto the scene.
"After chasing the band during Orientation, I decid
ed that I wanted to join," Saccheri said. "But I didn't
know how to play an instrument. So instead I took the
safe route and auditioned for Gaieties."
One of Saccheri's favorite memories of the experi
ence was dancing with the Band at the end of every
show. "That and wearing my Forrest Gump suit," he
said.
Saccheri saw Carter playing the accordion at a fall
football game and realized his destiny.
"I wanted to play the accordion," Saccheri said, "and
his presence confirmed that the Band would accept it."
Saccheri bided his time and then pounced upon an

accordion at the now defunct
Swain's House of Music on Univer
sity Avenue.
"I saw the accordion in the win
dow. It was small and cheap," Sac
cheri said. "I came back and fondled
it many times. I knew that the pur
chase of it was important, so I had
to wait until the stars were right."
Saccheri, who had experience
playing piano, spent spring break
learning how to play the fine old
standards.
"I learned how to play 'When the
Saints Go Marching In,' 'For He's a
Jolly Good Fellow' and 'Hava Nagi
la,' " Saccheri said.
The addition of the second accor
dion created a Renaissance of accor
dion players, resurrecting a tradi
tion that began long ago.
Edward M. Beaux was one of the
original inciters of the wacky Band.
He also was an accordion player.
"He's lost in the cobwebs of
time," Carter said.
"Though we revere him, no one
knows what happened to him," Sac
cheri said. "It's a mystery."
However, the Band has initiated
the two into other ways of the
world.
"Everything I learned about
music, I learned about in Band,"
Carter said.
"Everything I learned about ac
cordions, I learned from Mike,"
Saccheri said.
Last year, during the NCAA
men's basketball tournament,
Carter's experience and dexterity
proved key in fixing the keys of Sac
cheri's accordion.
"The baggage handlers tossed
my accordion around. All the but
tons were crushed in one side.
When I pushed the bellows, all the
chords played at once. It sounded
like a cow being strangled through
its own rib cage," Saccheri said.
"Mike showed me how to take it
apart and fix it," Saccheri said. "It
was like MacGyver. He used gum
and toothpicks to prop up the keys."
Their combined force on the
courts splashed them onto the front

page of the Providence Daily Jour
nal in Rhode Island.
Usually, though, Carter and
Saccheri are diffused into different
sections of the band.
"It's for security reasons,"
Carter said. "It's like critical mass.
They feared the combined force
would have a detrimental influence
on the morality of the Band."
Saccheri, the Band librarian, has
been implementing his plan for ac
cordion world domination.
"I've slowly been replacing the
music in the folders with accordion
music," Saccheri said. "I'll take
away the alto saxophone music
and put in different songs, like
'Lady of Spain,' and the 'Beer Bar
rel Polka.'"
Saccheri stocks his treasure
trove with booty from Haus Mit
teleuropa. "There's a whole shelf of
polka music, much of it written for
the accordion."
"My two major influences have
been John Linnell of They Might Be
Giants and Dick Contino, the teen
superstar, who made the Lady of
Spain famous, or infamous, de
pending on your viewpoint. He's
from Fresno, too," said Saccheri, a
fellow Raisin Capital native.
According to Saccheri, the accor
dion is experiencing a widespread
resurgence.
"It's all over the 'II Postino'
soundtrack. It's big in Cajun Zyde
co, Tejano. The accordion is big all
over the world, and now it's coming
here. It's like soccer. It's about
time, damn it."
Added Saccheri: "My purpose on
this Earth is to spawn a family of ac
cordionists. It's time to fight back
against natural selection."
Saccheri has been building up
his physique with Bruno, a bigger
accordion, that he purchased two
summers ago. "I thought, no more
of this child's play. My instrument
is not a toy. This investment vali
dated measatrueaccordion-nista."
Women have noticed.
"During Orientation, I was
playing in the Quad," Saccheri
said. "A woman and all her friends
surrounded me. She asked if she
could play my accordion. I told her
that, 'Well, I'm a little busy right
now.' "

"During Orientation, I was

Accordion players have their own special place in
Hell — and at Stanford.
Mike Carter, Class of' 93, and junior Chris Saccheri
add another note of originality to the Stanford Band,
amid the sweet harmony and cacophony of instrumen
tal antics.
Since 1989, Carter has been an active member of the
Band. "I started drinking and then began playing
shortly thereafter," he said.
"I played the tenor sax for a few years," Carter said.
"Senior year, I became horribly sick on the ski trip. I
couldn't play for a while. Then I remembered the
musty old accordion in my grandfather's storage shed."
Carter tore through spider webs and memories to
find the accordion, in all its wheezing glory.
"I had played around with it as a kid, but I was too
small. Before, I used gravity to compress the bellows
and played with the keys on top. So I wasted winter
break learning how to play by ear."
Carter breathed new life into the lungs of the
squeezebox — by spring quarter, the accordion was
rocking along with the Band.
"My first song was 'Limelight,' by Rush. I modified
the part for the tenor sax and created a new part for the
accordion."
Reaction from the Band was muted. "No one could
hear me," Carter said.
The power of the accordion was soon experienced
through other sensory modes.
"No one ever searches the accordion," Carter ex
plained. "The instrument expands and can come apart.
It could, say, be filled with ice and beer. Of course, we'd
never do that at a home game."
Carter was alone in his musical odyssey until Sac
cheri came onto the scene.
"After chasing the band during Orientation, I decid
ed that I wanted to join," Saccheri said. "But I didn't
know how to play an instrument. So instead I took the
safe route and auditioned for Gaieties."
One of Saccheri's favorite memories of the experi
ence was dancing with the Band at the end of every
show. "That and wearing my Forrest Gump suit," he
said.
Saccheri saw Carter playing the accordion at a fall
football game and realized his destiny.
"I wanted to play the accordion," Saccheri said, "and
his presence confirmed that the Band would accept it."
Saccheri bided his time and then pounced upon an

accordion at the now defunct
Swain's House of Music on Univer
sity Avenue.
"I saw the accordion in the win
dow. It was small and cheap," Sac
cheri said. "I came back and fondled
it many times. I knew that the pur
chase of it was important, so I had
to wait until the stars were right."
Saccheri, who had experience
playing piano, spent spring break
learning how to play the fine old
standards.
"I learned how to play 'When the
Saints Go Marching In,' 'For He's a
Jolly Good Fellow' and 'Hava Nagi
la,' " Saccheri said.
The addition of the second accor
dion created a Renaissance of accor
dion players, resurrecting a tradi
tion that began long ago.
Edward M. Beaux was one of the
original inciters of the wacky Band.
He also was an accordion player.
"He's lost in the cobwebs of
time," Carter said.
"Though we revere him, no one
knows what happened to him," Sac
cheri said. "It's a mystery."
However, the Band has initiated
the two into other ways of the
world.
"Everything I learned about
music, I learned about in Band,"
Carter said.
"Everything I learned about ac
cordions, I learned from Mike,"
Saccheri said.
Last year, during the NCAA
men's basketball tournament,
Carter's experience and dexterity
proved key in fixing the keys of Sac
cheri's accordion.
"The baggage handlers tossed
my accordion around. All the but
tons were crushed in one side.
When I pushed the bellows, all the
chords played at once. It sounded
like a cow being strangled through
its own rib cage," Saccheri said.
"Mike showed me how to take it
apart and fix it," Saccheri said. "It
was like MacGyver. He used gum
and toothpicks to prop up the keys."
Their combined force on the
courts splashed them onto the front

page of the Providence Daily Jour
nal in Rhode Island.
Usually, though, Carter and
Saccheri are diffused into different
sections of the band.
"It's for security reasons,"
Carter said. "It's like critical mass.
They feared the combined force
would have a detrimental influence
on the morality of the Band."
Saccheri, the Band librarian, has
been implementing his plan for ac
cordion world domination.
"I've slowly been replacing the
music in the folders with accordion
music," Saccheri said. "I'll take
away the alto saxophone music
and put in different songs, like
'Lady of Spain,' and the 'Beer Bar
rel Polka.'"
Saccheri stocks his treasure
trove with booty from Haus Mit
teleuropa. "There's a whole shelf of
polka music, much of it written for
the accordion."
"My two major influences have
been John Linnell of They Might Be
Giants and Dick Contino, the teen
superstar, who made the Lady of
Spain famous, or infamous, de
pending on your viewpoint. He's
from Fresno, too," said Saccheri, a
fellow Raisin Capital native.
