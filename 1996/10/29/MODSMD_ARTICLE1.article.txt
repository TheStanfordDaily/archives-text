# Prop. 209 played out at Mem Aud
## Jackson, D'Souza debate affirmative action ideals 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
Conservative author Dinesh D'Souza
and civil rights leader and Rev. Jesse Jack
son locked philosophical antlers in an in
tense debate last night over affirmative ac
tion and Proposition 209.

A responsive Memorial Auditorium audi
ence responded alternately with hisses and
applause.
D'Souza is a John M. Olin Research Fel
low at the American Enterprise Institute
and authored "The End of Racism" and "Il
liberal Education," books which include
case studies of the effects of affirmative ac

tion at institutions such as Stanford and
UC-Berkeley.
He supported Prop. 209, a piece of Cali
fornia legislation that would eliminate state
and local government affirmative action
programs if passed on Nov. 5.
D'Souza argued against a system that
perpetuated the "institution of race as a
basis for decision making." Affirmative ac
tion is the wrong way to go about moving in
"increments to a race-blind society," he
said.
"How can you fight discrimination by
practicing it?" D'Souza asked. "If you want
to treat people as equals, then you've got to
treat them differently."
Jackson pushed fo*- a diverse university
population that reflected the "real world
order."
"Most of the people in the world tonight
are nonwhite, young, poor and don't speak
English," Jackson said. "We must train our
youth to live in that world."
However, Jackson pointed out that affir
mative action is not simply a race issue.
Gender and disability had to be taken into
account.
"When the affirmative action debate is
seen as blacks taking advantage of whites, it
becomes a race debate," he said. "We can't
allow the race wedge to outdistance the
moral imperative."
Jackson, who is president of the Rainbow
Coalition, expressed a fundamental belief in
the equality of people, regardless of race.
Calling upon the athletic playing field as an
example, Jackson said, "When the playing
field is even, the goals are the same height
and the rules are public, we can make it.
"It's when the decisions are subjective
that laws are needed to protect us."
D'Souza attributed lopsided racial distri
bution in professional careers to "cultural
strategies."
He attributed the apparent success of
Asians over other minorities to the fact that
"they study harder." According to him, this is
due to the fact that Asians only have a 2 per
cent to 3 percent illegitimacy rate while the
African-American rate remains at 70 per
cent. Stronger families produce children that
are more likely to be high achievers, he said.
Jackson reminded his opponent that
during times of slaver, "our families were il
legal. We're still trying to put them togeth
er."
D'Souza repeatedly recalled statistics
that demonstrated what he believed to be
an academic superiority of Asians and white
Americans.
"Whites and Asians from families that
make less than $20,000 a year score higher
(on standardized tests) than African Amer
icans from families that make more than
$60,000," he said.
The reason that civil rights leaders will
not endorse an affirmative action system
based upon socio-economic status is that it
