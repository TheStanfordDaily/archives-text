# Dole lashes out at affirmative action

### 
SAN DIEGO (AP) - Bob Dole,
determined to win California sup
porters by seizing on a hotly debat
ed ballot issue, criticized affirma
tive action programs yesterday as
"a blind alley in the search for
equal justice."
In renewing his support for a
state proposition opposing race
and sex-based preferences, Dole
offered a broad indictment of affir
mative action programs overall.
"We cannot fight the evil of dis
crimination with more discrimina
tion, " Dole said in his most lengthy
explanation yet of his switch on the
subject. Until the presidential cam
paign, Dole had supported affirma
tive action programs.
"I changed my position. You
have the right to do that," Dole
said, adding: "Not every day, as the
White House does."
Dole has been on record in sup
port of Proposition 209, which
would end racial and sexual prefer
ences in state hiring and education,

but he has not spoken out forceful
ly on it until recently.
Trailing Clinton by double-digit
margins in polls in most regions of
the county, Dole is struggling to
boost his candidacy in the final
week of the campaign.
His latest effort came as House
Republicans released a new 30-sec
ond TV ad telling voters that elect
ing a Democratic Congress would
amount to a "blank check" for
Clinton — a tacit admission that
Dole is likely to lose.
Republican National Commit
tee Chairman Haley Barbour
sought to play down that aspect of
the ads, saying the TV spots
"remind people of why they are
against Clinton. . . . They talk
about what Clinton was like when
he had a Democratic Congress."
Many prominent Republicans
have been talking as if a Dole loss
were inevitable. For his part, Dole
told reporters, "I haven't heard
anv of them."
