Refugees flee war-torn Zaire
CYANGUGU, Rwanda (AP) — Tutsi rebels traded mortar and
small-arms fire yesterday with Zainan troops in eastern Zaire, as
500,000 refugees fled the fighting and warehouses of U.N. food were
reported looted.
Sporadic gunfire could be heard yesterday in Bukavu, a provincial
capital in Zaire. Fighting sent thousands of Bukavu residents stream
ing west and north, as the two sides clashed a few miles to the south.
The U.N. refugee agency said at least four people were killed and
100 wounded in that fighting Sunday. Witness reports that many
more had died could not be confirmed.
A struggle for land and power between ethnic Tutsis and Hutus
— which has left hundreds of thousands dead in the last three years
in neighboring Rwanda and Burundi — has spilled over into Zaire,
now home to many of the refugees.
U.N. officials say the developing situation in eastern Zaire could
rival the humanitarian disaster of 1994, when hundreds of thou
sands of Rwandan Hutus fled into Zaire after their compatriots
slaughtered 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis.
