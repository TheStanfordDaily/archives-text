Congresswoman deserves
re-election for her moves
to assist college students

IN AN INSTANT replay of the
last election cycle, Anna Eshoo
and Ben Brink are at it again,
competing for the honor to repre
sent the 14th Congressional district
in the U.S. House of Representa
tives. Two years ago, they faced off
in what Brink's campaign called an
extremely tight race, though it
ended with Eshoo securing 61 per
cent of the vote.
Now, Brink is back for more.
Thanks to the 104 th Congress,

we have seen what a radical
right-wing Congress can
accomplish. More important
ly, we have seen how mem
bers like Anna Eshoo can
counter an extremist right
wing agenda with a combina
tion of aggressive economic

initiatives and progressive social
policies.
Brink's ideas fall short of serving
Stanford best. Brink has resisted dis
cussing anything but economic
issues; his position papers don't even
mention his stances on social issues.
To his own detriment he avoids edu
cation and those issues that really
matter to students. Brink, other
wise, has an impressive resume and
a solid background in academia
including undergraduate study at
Stanford. The core of his election
strategy is to win over Silicon Valley
with this economic-heavy agenda.
But, Eshoo has checked him on
that front.
She has received the support of
many Silicon Valley business lead
ers to continue her economic poli
cies. This virtual laundry list of
who's who in the Valley includes the
CEO of Hewlett-Packard Co., the
vice president of Apple Computers,
the CEO of Silicon Graphics and the
CEO of Cirrus Logic, some of the
computer and technology indus
try's top leaders.
The Silicon Valley executives are

not the only beneficiaries of Eshoo's
efforts; she has also proven her
strong commitment to students.
Eshoo, a two-term representative
and one of the few congresswomen
on the Hill, has consistently and
repeatedly demonstrated her worth
to Stanford. For many Stanford stu
dents, a lack of federal aid would
mean a premature end to their edu
cation. Two years ago, amid the
Republican majority's battle over
financial aid, Eshoo fought her
opponents on campus and on the
House floor.
According to Congresswoman
Eshoo, California students received
more than $141 million from the
Stafford assistance program last
year. In a district that includes
Stanford and a slew of community

colleges, it's not surprising
that our district rakes in
more than $2.5 million
worth of this federal money.
Eshoo has demonstrated
a long commitment to the
students on this campus by
frequently visiting with

them and championing their con
cerns on the floor of the House. In
fact, one of her key proposals was to
create a program that gives parents
the ability to invest in their chil
dren's higher education through
special IRA-like savings accounts.
Unfortunately, the GOP Congress
shot down the idea early on. She
made this proposal long before
President Clinton turned college
tuition tax issues into a campaign
issue. She understands that stu
dents needing financial aid cannot
be sacrificed for a balanced budget.
Eshoo has proven her strength
and willpower by standing up to
those who oppose funding for edu
cation and research time and
again within the 104 th Congress,
always serving Stanford's best
interests.
Eshoo has proven her ability to
combine the dominate interests of
the business and academic commu
nity of her district and show them
to be mutually beneficial.
Anna Eshoo needs your vote this
Nov. 5 to continue her excellent ser
vice.
