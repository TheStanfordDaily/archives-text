## Toward political discussion 
### 
Last Tuesday morning, Stan
ford was not Stanford. It was as if
it had been taken over by people
from another world — the real world:
Republicans and Democrats; Proposition
209 supporters and opponents; every hot
political issue and candidate of the year
— showcased in White Plaza at the table
of brotherhood, soliciting support from
the best and brightest young America
has got to offer. Sponsored by Stanford
In Government, the campaign fair was
the first of its kind on the Stanford cam
pus and gave students the opportunity to
examine political issues from every angle.
Can a real forum for intelligent, polit
ical discussion be forming on the Stan
ford campus?
Initially, my plan for today's column
was to unmask the one-sided political
nature of this University's students: lib
eral. Now, that is not to say that I am
not liberal in some of my politics; I'm as
vehement a supporter of affirmative
action and welfare as any true-to-life lib
eral. However, thanks to the actions of
SIG and its leaders, the tide of blind,
unquestioned fidelity to liberal politics
is being given an overdue cost-benefit
analysis, thus issuing the first blow
against "the winds of freedom" here at
Stanford. SIG is changing the course of
a smug, uni-political climate that has
dominated our campus up until last
Tuesday.
Say it ain't so!
Little has been done to question the

liberal political environment of our Uni
versity — or any university for that mat
ter. Provocative publications like The
Stanford Review and The Thinker offer
some solace to thinking Stanford stu
dents interested in both sides of the
issue but all too often end up dismissed
as off-the-beaten track. However, the
same provocative spirit espoused by The
Thinker and The Review is rarely car
ried over into the classroom or dormito
ries.
There, provocative is bad. We can't
have anyone rock the boat; God forbid
anyone should be offended. Again, grace
a Residential Education and Cultures,
Ideas and Values, we are programmed in
an Orwellian fashion to go with the flow
— ooze political correctness and cease
thinking for ourselves.
Not any more!
SIG has brought us the Truth: There
is more than one political party in the
America. Questioning our political
tenets, SIG has put things in perspective
— no more half-truths. What good is
there in holding a belief, be it political or
religious, if it goes unchallenged, unex
amined? A genuinely liberal discussion
would explain why affirmative action is
right, why protecting the environment is
right, why protecting the lives of the
unborn is essential.
Though last Tuesday was a step in the
right direction, there is much more to be
done; we live in a politically lopsided
imaginarium. Take the ASSU — denying

funds to Students for Life, a pro-life
organization on campus, and stifling the
provocative political spirit this school so
desperately needs. Reminiscent of cen
sorship, the ASSU works contrary to
SIG, grounding the takeoff of any forum
faithful to intelligent political discussion.
The very word "discuss" is misunder
stood at Stanford. Discuss comes from
the Latin "discutere": "to crash or shake
apart." Too often, "discussions" are
mental masturbations, reaffirming what
everyone else "supposedly believes,"
with those differing finding their rock
and hiding beneath it. Going with the
flow, they are remiss about the world
around them.
Upon my graduation from high school,
our president boomed that an education
promotes liberal thinking, engaging us in
discussion that both informs and dis
turbs. Education means being offended;
it means being disturbed — as much as
Stanford would like you to believe, the
world doesn't cater to those of us with
weak stomachs. He then asserted that if
we enter the world comfortable with the
what happens about us, he had failed.
Well, that gives Stanford something to
work on.
