Crackdown on fraternity parties shows discrimination

The increasing disparity
between the University's treat
ment of Greeks and the treatment
of everyone else on campus has reached
sickening proportions. What do I mean? I
mean the obviously selective and discrim
inatory prosecution of fraternities for
"underage drinking" and "lack of respon
sible planning" compared to the total lack
of attention paid to identical "transgres
sions" occurring at almost every non-
Greek house on campus that throws a
party.
Asst. Director of Student Activities
Heather Dunn and her secret army of
shocked freshman spies — assuming such
freshmen even exist — are curiously pre
sent only at fraternity parties. Either
that or no other house on campus has
ever served minors alcohol in the pres
ence of such sensitive, eager-to-talk
young'uns.
Maybe we can settle this right now: If
there is anyone out there who has not
been to a non-fraternity party where

minors were served and / or a "lack of
responsible planning" occurred, please
phone me immediately. My number is
497-4191; I would love to hear about
such a party.
It is an indisputable fact of campus life
that such events occur at almost any
party. Further, at many campus parties,
none of the University's party protocols
are followed and no one in the adminis
tration so much as looks in that direction.
Fraternities, under the increased scrutiny
from the University as well as from their
national fraternal organizations, are far
more likely to try to comply with the pro
tocol than say, Synergy or the Enchanted
Broccoli Forest.
Yet all we ever read about are frater
nities being put on probation and frater
nities being punished. Strange. Two
years back, some drunk underage non-
Stanford idiot fell down three stories at
Roble Hall and was injured; last year
some thugs caused a fight at an Indian
culture night party — and the University

does nothing! The Sigma Chis "break"
an unwritten rule; Dunn hears about it
and then calls in the cops to frisk every
one at the party, after which the Sigma
Chis are severely punished. Ms. Dunn, if
you called the cops to storm any party —
and I do mean any party not directly run
by the University — some minor-in-pos
session citations will be given out. Don't
belittle our intelligence by making frater
nities seem like the lone black hats in
your crusade for a dry campus because
they're not.
Am I asking the University to crack
down on every campus party? Absolutely
not. That would be absurd, and the Uni
versity has no intention of doing that, I
am sure. If it wanted to break up every
party on this campus, it could — every
body knows that. (There are a variety of
reasons why it won't do this, but the
most important is probably that students
would hop into cars in search of alcohol,
with predictably devastating and tragic
consequences.)

What I am asking the University to
do is to be up front about its distaste
for the Greeks, to be clear about its
insidious efforts to remove them from
collective campus housing and to make
public the hidden agenda regarding the
attempted abolition of the storied
Greek tradition here at Stanford. Make
it official, Dunn, (Director of Student
Activities Nanci) Howe and (Dean of
Students Marc) Wais — let the Greek
alumni know that this is the case, the
same alumni who give a far larger per
centage of money to this campus than
one would expect from their sheer
numerical proportion of alumni, and
then let's see how it plays out. Perhaps
the University is right in its witch
hunt. But I think it's about time that
people not under the University's
thumb (read: alumni) get a chance to
make that judgment.
Fair enough?
