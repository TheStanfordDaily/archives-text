# Film looks at homosexuality in movies

### Connie Chang 
The screening of the movie "The Celluloid
Closet" last night on campus allowed students
to examine their attitudes about homosexuali
ty and sex roles in society.
The feature-length documentary was
shown in the Annenberg Auditorium to an au
dience of 300, including its co-directors and
producers Jeffrey Friedman and Rob Epstein.
Blending film clips and interviews with sig
nificant figures of the movie industry, such as
Tom Hanks and Gore Vidal, the film, narrated
by actress Lily Tomlin, examines the portrayal
of homosexuality in Hollywood.
The film traces the path that portrayals of
homosexuality in the movies has taken. Until
the 19605, any depiction of this so-called "sex
perversion" was banned from the screen.
The success of movies like "The Birdcage"
and "Philadelphia" are representative of the
great strides that gay activists have made in
Hollywood and in American culture, said
Friedman.
In a question-and-answer session after the

screening, Friedman expanded on the impor
tance of Hanks' starring role as a gay man with
AIDS in "Philadelphia."
"People are more willing to accept a gay
character because it's just [Hanks]," Friedman
said. "He's nonthreatening."
Hollywood "made it easy for the audience,
and they made a lot of money," added Epstein
Many of the issues discussed in"The Cellu
loid Closet" came to light in the making of the
film itself. Friedman said he and Epstein ap
proached several filmmakers and television
stations in the United States unsuccessfully
before they found backing from European sta
tions and private donors.
Friedman stressed, however, that the film
deals with Hollywood films rather than inde
pendent ones.
"I'm not interested in making films for a
gay audience only," Epstein said. "I feel really
great about how the film has played. It's play
ing all over the world."
"The next step is more gay filmmakers
working in Hollywood," he added.
"There is hope," Friedman agreed, "and it's

from independent filmmakers, from gay film
makers. Whether these filmmakers will make
it into Hollywood remains to be seen. It's too
soon to say."
Commenting on more general issues, Fried
man said that "education, openly gay elected
public officials and gay activism have a great
deal to do with the advancement of gays in so
ciety."
He also credited Patrick Buchanan — who
was a contender for this year's Republican
presidential nomination — for publicly vilify
ing and demonizing gay people and conse
quently making the issue "much more a part of
the national conversation."
The screening initially was intended for
graduate students in film as part of a collo
quium, said Communication Teaching Prof.
Jan Krawitz. But the opportunity was ex
tended to the entire campus as a great chance
to "bring the film to the community," she
said.
The film was released last April and is based
on a 1981 book by Vito Russo who died of an
ATDS-related illness in 1991.
