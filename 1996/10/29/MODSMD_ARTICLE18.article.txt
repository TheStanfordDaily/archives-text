E-mail pornography hits campus
On Oct. 21, yet another person at Stanford received copies of an e
mail message offering child pornography.
According to University Information Systems Specialist Stephen
Hansen, the most recent victim is the 326 th person with a Leland sys
tem e-mail account to receive the pornographic message.
The victim, a research associate, said "apparently thousands of people
all over the country received the same message. These people were picked
for no apparent reason and came from many different mailing lists."
The message begins, "Hi! I sent you this letter because your e-mail
address was on a list that fit this category. I am a fan of child pornogra
phy, and for the past four years, I have been able to gather quite a col
lection of it."
It goes on to describe in detail materials available from the sender's
collection, prices of different items and the content of some of the ma
terials.
The sender also asks recipients for materials they may have and
comments that he is "willing to trade big, or pay a lot."
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer described the sender of the
message as "supposedly incredibly stupid" and said that the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and America Online — from whose service the
message was allegedly sent — are both investigating.

Residents in Palo Alto and Mountain View have also received the
message, which includes a name and address, presumably of the sender.
Niemeyer comments that it is unclear whether the message is "the
real deal or a prank. It is pretty bizarre."
Student arrested for drug possession
Michael Attocknie, a 21-year-old Stanford student, was booked in
the Santa Clara County Jail Oct. 20 for possession of marijuana, pos
session of psilocybin mushrooms and being under the influence of alco
hol and controlled substances.
Attocknie, who was handcuffed by the police, slapped a technician
who was called to take samples of his blood when the police removed his
handcuffs to facilitate the blood drawing, Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said.
Officers had been patrolling Lomita Court on Saturday night be
cause of parties in the area when they noticed Attocknie sitting in a
car.
Upon approaching the car, according to Niemeyer, the officer "noted
a strong odor of marijuana smoke emanating from the vehicle."
In addition to having baggies of psilocybin mushrooms and marijua
na in his pocket, Attocknie also had burnt marijuana butts beside him
on the rear car seat, Niemeyer said.
