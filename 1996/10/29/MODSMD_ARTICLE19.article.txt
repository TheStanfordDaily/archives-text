### Kelly E. Young Contributing writer 
Some Stanford women will be
getting a jump-start on Halloween
tonight at the Fire Truck House.
The Sisters Program, a new pro
gram that pairs upperclass women
with freshmen and transfer
women, will host a Halloween party
for the new sisters.
The "big and li'l sisters" are en
couraged to coordinate their cos
tumes for the party, which will fea
ture traditional bobbing for apples.
The women's a cappella group,
Counterpoint, is also scheduled to
make an appearance.
But many of the big sisters may
find themselves without families if
more freshman and transfer
women don't join the program.
Sophomore Colleen Bazdarich, so
cial program intern for the
Women's Center, said 24 upper
class women were paired with
freshmen or transfers for the Sis
ters Program, but there still is a
waiting list.
"We still have another 20 upper
classmen that need little sisters,"
Bazdarich said. "We're still actively
recruiting freshmen. Every big sis
ter should have a (little) sister."
Prospective sisters turned in ap
plications by Oct. 4 and were noti
fied of their matches last Wednes
day.
"We matched sisters based on in
terest and anything else they might
have in mind based on prefer
ences," said junior Katy Chow, the
center's program coordinator.
"We have a pretty diverse group
of people signed up," Bazdarich
added.
Chow said she got the idea
for the Sisters Program after
participating in another upper
class / freshman program.
"When I was a frosh, I was a
part of the Asian-American big

sib / little sib program. I found
that to be a valuable experience."
Chow became involved in the
Women's Center later that year.
Bazdarich also said she was
jealous when her freshman
friends planned activities with
their big sibs.
"This is an opportunity for
those who aren't necessarily in
volved in those communities to do
it through our center," Bazdarich
said. "I think it will also help get
freshmen involved in the
Women's Center."
Freshman and little sister
Rachel Churner said she would
enjoy having an upperclass
woman to show her around and
answer questions she might have.
"I thought it would be a good
way to meet older students at the
school," said Churner, who has
also attended some of the
Women's Collective meetings.
Tonight's Halloween party be
gins at 7:30. Bazdarich encour
aged freshman and transfer
women to make an appearance,
even if they have not officially
signed up for the program.
"If there are freshman who are
interested, they're welcome to
come. We're working really hard
to make sure everyone has a fun
time," Bazdarich said.
Other social events planned
for this quarter include a trip to
the tactile dome at the Explorato
rium in San Francisco. She also
suggested the sisters might meet
at the Women's Center before a
speech relevant to women's is
sues and attend the speech to
gether.
Both big and little sisters are
encouraged to plan events on a
one-on-one basis.
"We're going to be having a
night where we just say,' Get to
gether with your sister tonight,' "
Bazdarich said.
