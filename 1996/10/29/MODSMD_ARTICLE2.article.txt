# New liberal magazine seeks to aid discourse
## 
### Jennifer West 
A summit is the highest point
attainable in a journey — essen
tially, it is the peak of the climb.
Summit, a new publication
being launched at Stanford, is a
self-described liberal magazine
which its editors hope will aid in
the mental and social climb past
Stanford's "palm tree barriers"
into issues involving the nation
and world.
Sophomore Atiba Pertilla, one
of the magazine's founders, said
the first issue, due in dorm rooms
Friday, will "be a mixed bag."
The articles will range in topics
from the possible end of the
British monarchy to military
spending to the consumption of
environmental resources to the
University administration's atti
tude toward fraternities on cam
pus.
Although the magazine hopes
to cover issues on international,
national, state and local issues,
the primary focus will be broader
concerns facing the world.
Editor in Chief Paul Bodnar, a
sophomore, said Summit aims to
provide a forum for debate on na
tional and international issues,
where writers "analyze interest
ini ide.i and brim: tbrir own fla

vor to it.
Bodnar hopes to juxtapose
viewpoints and provide articles
which might be "half dogma and
half fact — but not sensationalist
or radical."
The idea for the bimonthly
magazine was generated last
spring.
Bodnar and Pertilla, disap
pointed with what they called "su
perficial coverage" of larger social
and political issues in The Stan
ford Review and The Daily, decid
ed to take their ideas and previous
journalism experience to organize
Summit.
"We hope to balance out The
Review and its conservative cover
age," Bodnar said.
Review Editor in Chief Jeff
Giesea, a senior, called Summit "a
good thing."
Any student organization that
will help curb the problem of stu
dent apathy on campus is worth
while, he said.
" I am all for having more polit
ical voices on campus," he said.
"Let the winds of freedom blow "
To get the first issue published,
Bodnar and Pertilla approached
the ASSU Publications Board and
Dean ot Students Marc Wais.
Wais was instrumental in allo
cating funds for printing costs, a
large portion of which came from
the Christian Johnson Memorial
Fund, Bodnar said. The fund was
set up by Johnson's parents after he
died as an undergraduate to support
campus or student initiatives which
promote discussion of social issues.
With a positive response from
the Publications Board and fund
ing from the Dean of Students Of
fice, the editorial team has grown
to four editors, a business manag
er and volunteer writers from
across the student body.
If the magazine is well-re
ceived, it may expand to include
advertising, Bodnar said.
Bodnar said the magazine is
written specifically for the Stan
ford audience.
"I am excited about writing for
this paper," he said. "I look at the
list of article ideas, and I think, '1
would love to write any of these.' "
