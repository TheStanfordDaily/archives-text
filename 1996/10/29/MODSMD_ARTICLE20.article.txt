## Manard finishes second in nation 
### David McGee 
Sometimes second place feels
like a loss. But last weekend at
the Intercollegiate Yacht Racing
Association women's single
handed national championships
in Redwood City, second place
almost felt like a victory.
Senior Alice Manard was run
ner-up to St. Mary's senior jug
gernaut Danielle Brennan at
last weekend's regatta hosted by
the Stanford sailing team.
Brennan won 12 of the 16

at this event in the

finally have a good
regatta.'

races, finishing out of the top
four places only once on her way
to totaling just 30 points. Man
ard's second place total was 68,
followed by Navy junior Julie
Younger at 74.
Other Pacific Coast division
finishers were California sopho
more Annelise Moore in 11th
place and Oregon junior Ingrid
van Heeckeren in 15th place.
Brennan was in control from
the start, winning the first 10
races.
"There was going to be no
beating her," Stanford head
coach Steve Bourdow said. "She

was best at these conditions."
Friday and Saturday were
marked by extremely high
winds, even to the point of post
poning races on Saturday morn
ing. According to Bourdow,
Brennan excels in high wind but
does not at normal conditions.
"When you're really good in
one condition, you can domi
nate," he said.
"She had better boat speed
and just crushed everybody,"
Manard said. "But on Sunday
(when the wind was not as
strong) she was not as competi
tive."
Manard, though, was able to
confront her sailing ghosts with
the performance, overcoming
previous disappointments at the
single-handed championships.
"I haven't sailed well at this
event in the past," she said. "I'm
glad to finally have a good regat
ta."
"It's by far her best nation
als," Bourdow said.
Manard finished in the top
five 13 times in 16 races. Her
second-place finish did not come
without a good share of drama,
however. After a solid Friday
and Saturday she had built a 30-
43 lead over third-place
Younger.
In Sunday's first race,
though, she made a mistake try
ing to re-rig a line and lost con
trol of her sail. She lost a full
minute regaining control and
finished 14th. Her lead had van
ished.

Senior Katie Schlukebir charged to the finals of
the All-American doubles competition with junior
Ania Bleszynski.
"Steve kept me calm," Man
ard said. "I just thought about
the next race, not about choking
my lead."
Going into the 15th race,
Younger had taken over second
place from Manard. Manard
decided to take a risk in the 15th
race and sail a previously unde
sirable side of the course in an
attempt to catch the changing
winds.
"She was at home," Bourdow
said. "And she guessed it right
on."
Manard's second-place finish
and Younger's llth-place show
ing in the 15th race sealed the
overall second-place finish for
Manard.
"I knew she was capable of a
finish like this," Bourdow said.
"But she hadn't sailed up to her
ability in past years here. This is
a real good finish for her."
"I wasn't sure how well I
would do," Manard said. "My
goal was to get in the top three,
but when I saw how windy it
was, I knew I would do well."
