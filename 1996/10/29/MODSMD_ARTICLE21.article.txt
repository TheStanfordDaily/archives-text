# Washington State tops the Card
## Volleyball drops first conference match in two years 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
Some things just can't last
forever.
The third-ranked Stanford

women's volleyball team (17-2,
10-1 Pacific 10 Conference)
defeated No. 14 Washington (17-
4, 8-3) but lost to No. 9 Wash
ington State (15-4, 8-3) this
weekend. The loss to the

Cougars ended the Cardinal's
32-match conference winning
streak. Stanford had never
before lost to Washington State
in women's volleyball.
Stanford entered Friday's
contest against Washington at
Hec Edmundson Pavilion on top
of the Pac-10 but with the
Huskies in hot pursuit. With a
victory over the Card, Washing
ton could have moved to within
just one match of the two-time
defending conference champs.
To the Huskies' dismay,
Stanford experienced none of
the flatness that Washington
had hoped for. The Cardinal
jumped out of the blocks with a
spirited performance, coming up
with extraordinary defensive
plays en route to a convincing
15-5 first game win. The Card
hit .313 while holding the
Huskies to -.028.
"Our defense played really
well," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "We came up with some
great digs which we were then
able to convert into offensive
plays."
The Card continued its offen
sive barrage in game two,
recording a 15-9 victory with a
.395 hitting percentage. Fresh
man Jaimi Gregory- helped pro
vide another excellent team
defensive effort. She finished
the match with 11 digs.
In the third game, the Cardi
nal started to struggle a bit,
committing some hitting errors
that may have resulted from
overaggressiveness. However,
the Cardinal defense remained
true, guiding Stanford to a 15-12
victory.
"Sometimes we tried to kill

balls we should have tried to just
keep in play," Shaw said. "But
we played very well against
Washington. It was a big match
for us."
Stanford then visited Pull
man on Sunday to face the high
ly ranked Cougars. Washington
State dominated the first game
of the match, winning it handily
15-6.
But the Cardinal bounced
back, finding its rhythm and
earning a 15-11 game-two victo
ry that put the Card back in the
match.
The Stanford women rode
their momentum into the third
game, jumping out to an early 4-
1 lead. But things went downhill
from there as the Cougars
stormed back and rolled over the
Card 15-7.
"I think if we could have con
tinued to build upon our lead
and win game three, we would
have been able to carry that
momentum and win in four
games," Shaw said.
Instead, the Cougars contin
ued to play well, extending their
lead to 13-4 in the fourth game.
But the Card would not go down
easily. Stanford roared back to
score 10 of the next 11 points,
tying the game 14-14 but even
tually fell 17-15 before a huge
crowd at Bohler Gym.
The defeat marked the first
time Stanford has lost to a con
ference opponent since the end
of the 1994 campaign.
"Walsh and Folkl had off
nights, and when that happens,
we will struggle," Shaw said.
"But [Washington State] played
unbelievably well. They are an
outstanding team."
