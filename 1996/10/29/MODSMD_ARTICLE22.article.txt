## Tennis competes in Ail-American 
### David Lee 
Senior Katie Schlukebir and
junior Ania Bleszynski, the top
seeded doubles team, were upset
in the final round of the Riviera
Women's Ail-American Tennis
Championships last weekend in
Los Angeles. Both players
reached the quarterfinal round of
the singles competition before
being upset by the competition.
"None of the matches were
easy," Bleszynski said. "Katie and
I had a good chance to win, and I
think we did pretty well consider
ing that we start practice later
than most schools."
Bleszynski and Schlukebir had
a difficult first-round match
against unseeded Laura Olave
and Susanna Rodriguez of
Louisiana State, dropping the
first set 6-4, before storming back
in the final two sets to win 6-0, 6-
3. Bleszynski and Schlukebir
then breezed into the third round
with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Kylie
Hunt and Christine Sim of
Kansas.
The duo battled off another
first-set loss in the semifinals to

beat Mississippi's Courtney
Chapman and Agnes Muzamel in
a third-set tie-breaker and win 3-
6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). But in the final
they jumped to a one-set lead but
could not hang on and lost to
Texas' Christina Moros and Far
ley Taylor 2-6, 6-3, 7-5.
Bleszynski, who was also the
No. 1 seed in the singles portion of
the tournament, was upset in the
quarterfinal round by seventh-seed
Melissa Zimpfer of Wisconsin 6- 1 ,
6-3. Bleszynski only had one close
match prior to the loss in a three
set win over Pacific 10 Conference
rival Reka Cseresnyes of Arizona
State 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. She breezed in
her first-round match 6-0, 6-4 over
Karolina Bakalarova of USC.
Schlukebir's advance to the
quarterfinals was composed of two
straight-set victories. She cruised
past UCLA's Elizabeth Schmidt in
round one 6-3, 6-1 and then beat
Romano Tediakusuma of Nicholls
State 6-2, 6-1. But despite an early
lead over Marianne Vallin of
UNLV, Schlukebir fell in the quar
terfinals 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.
