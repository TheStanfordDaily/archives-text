## Tennis competes in Ail-American 
### David Lee 
Senior Katie Schlukebir and
junior Ania Bleszynski, the top
seeded doubles team, were upset
in the final round of the Riviera
Women's Ail-American Tennis
Championships last weekend in
Los Angeles. Both players
reached the quarterfinal round of
the singles competition before
being upset by the competition.
"None of the matches were
easy," Bleszynski said. "Katie and
I had a good chance to win, and I
think we did pretty well consider
ing that we start practice later
than most schools."
Bleszynski and Schlukebir had
a difficult first-round match
against unseeded Laura Olave
and Susanna Rodriguez of
Louisiana State, dropping the
first set 6-4, before storming back
in the final two sets to win 6-0, 6-
3. Bleszynski and Schlukebir
then breezed into the third round
with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Kylie
Hunt and Christine Sim of
Kansas.
The duo battled off another
first-set loss in the semifinals to

beat Mississippi's Courtney
Chapman and Agnes Muzamel in
a third-set tie-breaker and win 3-
6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). But in the final
they jumped to a one-set lead but
could not hang on and lost to
Texas' Christina Moros and Far
ley Taylor 2-6, 6-3, 7-5.
Bleszynski, who was also the
No. 1 seed in the singles portion of
the tournament, was upset in the
quarterfinal round by seventh-seed
Melissa Zimpfer of Wisconsin 6- 1 ,
6-3. Bleszynski only had one close
match prior to the loss in a three
set win over Pacific 10 Conference
rival Reka Cseresnyes of Arizona
State 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. She breezed in
her first-round match 6-0, 6-4 over
Karolina Bakalarova of USC.
Schlukebir's advance to the
quarterfinals was composed of two
straight-set victories. She cruised
past UCLA's Elizabeth Schmidt in
round one 6-3, 6-1 and then beat
Romano Tediakusuma of Nicholls
State 6-2, 6-1. But despite an early
lead over Marianne Vallin of
UNLV, Schlukebir fell in the quar
terfinals 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.
Junior Julie Scott and fresh
man Anne Kremer also qualified
to play in the tournament in addi
tion to the three returning All-
Americans Bleszynski, Schluke
bir and junior Sandra De Silva
who were automatically invited
based on last year's perfor
mances.
The big Stanford win came
from Scott, the only Stanford
player to lose in the first round of
the singles tournament. She
plowed through to the final
round of the consolation bracket
where she won a tight match
against her longtime rival and
best friend Schmidt, UCLA's No.
2 player.
Scott "played better in that
match than I've ever seen her
play," Bleszynski said.
After losing the first set 6-3,
Scott came back 6-2 to even the
score. Scott increased the pres
sure in the third set, and Schmidt
finally succumbed, giving up the
set to Scott 7-6 (7-2).
"It was extraordinary that
Julie got in [to the tournament],"

said Frank Brennan, head coach
of the women's team. "I was real
ly pleased with her perfor
mance."
The friendly rivalry between
Scott and Schmidt has been going
on for six years, having started in
their hometown, Austin, Texas.
They played for rival high school
teams and consequently faced
each other many times. In Scott's
memory, however, she has beaten
Schmidt every time they have
played, although she admits that
Schmidt has been "getting clos
er" recently. The last time they
played each other prior to the
tournament was last summer.
Scott won the single set 6-4 in
that encounter.
"I was nervous in the begin
ning even though we've played
tons of times before," Scott said.
"It was a close match, and I hated
that one of us had to win."
De Silva and Kremer both
dropped out in the second round,
losing to Duke's Vanessa Webb 6-
3, 6-4 and Muzamel 7-6 (7-2), 6-3
respectively.
"We didn't set the world on
fire, but I thought it was a good
tournament for us," Brennan
said.
