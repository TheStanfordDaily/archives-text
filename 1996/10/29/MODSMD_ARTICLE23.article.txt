# Swimmers battle weather and Pacific
## Card takes second at UOP, gets set for next meet with Cal 
### Casey Harmon 
The Stanford men's swim team
placed second behind California at last
weekend's Pacific Intercollegiate Invita
tional in Stockton, Calif.
After a very hard week of training and
only swimming one day of the meet, the
Cardinal swimmers do not see the loss to
a more rested Golden Bear team as wor
risome.
"This weekend was an indicator of
how hard we're working right now," said
senior co-captain Scott Jones.
The Cardinal was coming off its first
week of a full training schedule that
includes three weight sessions and nine
water workouts a week. In swimming,
athletes orient their training toward fast
performances at the end of the season in
meets such as the NCAA Champi
onships.
As a consequence, early perfor
mances such as the ones turned in last
weekend by all the teams in Stockton
are rarely personal bests for the swim
mers.
Battling cold and windy conditions at
Pacific's outdoor pool, the Cardinal
swimmers concentrated on being techni
cally and strategically sound in their
races. Fast times were less of a concern.
"Everyone, especially the freshmen,
raced really well, and that is what is

important right now," said junior co-cap
tain Scott Claypool.
The next meet for the Cardinal is
Thursday at 2 p.m. at deGuerre Pool. In
its first home dual meet of the year, the
Stanford team will face California again
in a "double-distance" meet that promis
es to be one of the more grueling of the
season.
Normally in dual meets, the schedule
of events includes the 50-, 100-, 200-,
500- and 1,000-yard freestyles, a 200-
yard race of each stroke (butterfly, back
stroke and breaststroke), the 200 indi
vidual medley, and two relays: the 400
freestyle and 400 medley.
Thursday's meet against Cal will have
the same schedule of events except that
the athletes will be covering twice the
normal distance in every race, and the
double-distance meet promises to show
case some aerobic feats that will amaze
fans used to seeing normal swimming
competitions.
Considering the distances typically
traveled underwater by such national
and world-class swimmers as are on the
Stanford and Cal teams, the swimmers
in the 400 breaststroke and 400 back
stroke could very well spend almost half
of the race underwater. Breath control
and aerobic capacities will be on display
as Stanford and Cal do battle.
"The meet will be different for differ

ent people," said sophomore sprinter
Dodd Wales. "Sprinters will not have to
adjust that much because they will be
swimming shorter events. It will be a
much bigger change for the distance
swimmers."
Indeed, the Cardinal distance swim
mers, seniors Kevin Radvanny and Jon
Lischke and sophomore Matt O'Mara,
will be tested by Cal in their 80-lap race,
the 2,000-yard freestyle.
The sprinters — freshmen Glenn
Counts and Kurt Spencer, sophomore
Wales, juniors Chris Olson, Jed Crowe
and Claypool and senior Jones — will be
swimming the 100 and 200 freestvles
rather than their normal 50s and 100s.
The Cal meet will also be the first
meet in which the Cardinal will come to
the blocks with its full roster. Last week
end, sophomores Pierce and Tate Blah
nik, junior Tom Wilkens and assistant
coach Ted Knapp were not in Stockton,
as they were participating in National
Team camps.
Knapp, Wilkens and Rlahnik were in
San Diego with the U.S. National A and
R teams, while Pierce was in Colorado
Springs as part of the Sydney 2000
Olympic Development program.
The addition of Wilkens, Pierce, Rlah
nik and Knapp will give the rest of the
NCAA its first look at this year's
undoubtedly powerful Stanford team.
