### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
After three difficult tournaments, the
Cardinal men's golf team finally gave fans
something to cheer about at the Fresno
Lexus Golf Classic on Friday and Saturday.
Although adverse weather conditions hin
dered play on Friday, the Stanford golfers
displayed both individual skill and strong
team depth to finish seventh in the team
standings.
Leading the team was sophomore Joel
Kribel, who tied for seventh place in indi
vidual standings with Matt Murray of San
Diego State and Brian Helton of UC-Santa
Barbara. Although Kribel started out tied
for second after the first round when he
shot a 71, he fell to fourth after shooting a
73 in the second round. He posted a 73
again in the final round to finish with a
combined score of 217.
The next highest-placing Stanford golfer
was senior Conrad Rav, who tied for 22nd

with Chris Janson of Oregon State, D.J.
Powers of San Jose State and Naoya Take
moto of UC-Santa Barbara. Although the
tournament started a bit rocky for Ray, he
performed well with an incredible comeback
in the final round, shooting four birdies and
four pars in the last eight holes of the tour
nament. Not only did Ray raise his individ
ual standings from 48th place to his final
finish at 22nd, he also helped solidify the
Cardinal's final team rankings.
"I was disappointed with my play on the
first day," Ray said. "However, I played
pretty solid on the back — 1 started hitting
the way I wanted to, got the putter working,
had a few good iron shots and held togeth
er."
Shooting 75 and 77 in the first two
rounds of play, Ray's four birdies helped
him post a final score of 71 to end up with a
total score of 223.
Freshman Dusty Brett was next for the
Card, tying for 38th place with
Jason Watney of Fresno State,
John Mercer of New Mexico State
and Mike Samoles of San Diego
State. Brett posted scores of 76, 74
and 76 to finish with a combined
score of 226.
"I felt good about the first day,"
Brett said. "But on the last day I
hit a bunch of bogeys and didn't
finish as strong."
In addition, sophomore Scott
Wang tied for 50th place, junior
Jake Poe finished for a tie at 79th
and freshman Andy Hastings tied

at 86th.
Strategically, this was a very
important tournament for the

Stanford team, which was matched
against other squads in its division
for the first time.
According to the new rules set

forth this year, a team's eligibility
for the regional tournament at the
end of the spring season is deter
mined by its head-to-head record
against other teams in its district
with the top 12 schools entering
the competition.
In this tournament, the Cardi
nal finished above district rivals
UC-Santa Barbara, UCLA, Pacific
and New Mexico State, which
placed ninth, 12th, 13th, and 14th,
respectively.
Although the Cardinal lost to
district opponents Oregon (first
place), Oregon State (second place),
and San Jose State (sixth place),
coach Wally Goodwin said his team
can beat both Oregon State and
San Jose State in the future.
