# Win streak ends in the East
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Contributing writer 
The Stanford field hockey team (9-3, 6-
1 North Pacific Conference) survived an
intense East Coast trip after three nail
biting matches against the top teams in
the nation. The Cardinal players came
home late Sunday night with a victory
over Ursinus and two close losses to 13th
ranked American and No. 17 James Madi
son.
The team's loss to the Bulldogs of James
Madison snapped its 10-game winning
streak. The Stanford team now holds an
overall record of 12-3 including exhibition

games that do not count toward the season
record.
"I think we gave a great name to Califor
nia hockey," senior tri-captain Baochi
Nguyen said. "Usually the East Coast
teams don't expect much from [West Coast
teams], but we definitely gave them a run
for their money."
The squad put up an amazing fight
against the American Eagles, extending the
game to overtime play.
Stanford opened up the heated match
just 112 minutes into the game with senior
tn-captain Amv Marfil's goal. The shot,

assisted by junior midfielder Paige
Mader and sophomore midfielder
Justina Williams, was off of a
penalty corner.
The squad wrapped up the first
half of the match with the 1-0 lead.
But in the second-half of the
game American's freshman Sage
Asteak evened the score at the
24:21 mark when she lifted a
rebound off a shot made by the
Eagles' Virginia Casabo.
An intense 34 scoreless minutes
passed before American's Jonie
Lees finally put one in the net off of
a penalty corner with 4 minutes
remaining in the first overtime
period.
The Card matched the presti
gious Eagles in skill, and in some
cases excelled as junior goalie Kel
ley Naylor made 10 Cardinal saves,
compared to American keeper
Michelle Thornhill's five, but Stan
ford was unable to take control in
overtime.
American took three of its 13

shots on goal and six of its 17
penalty shots during overtime. The
Cardinal had eight shots on the
American goal and forced six
penalty corners total.
American "was a very aggres
sive team. We adjusted well and
stayed focused, and I think we still
had a pretty offensive game,"
Nguyen said. "I don't think anyone
is disappointed in the way we
played. The outcome is just a bit
unfortunate."
After the match, coach Sheryl
Johnson greeted her players off the
field, telling them she was very
pleased with the way they played.
The Stanford team had gone
into the American match after a
win over Ursinus. The two teams
did not budge as scoreless minutes
ticked by, and it was not until
freshman Mallory Chambers
scored in the second half of the
game that Stanford finally was in
the lead. The Card kept the lead
until the final whistle to win the
game 1-0.
The squad played the nth
ranked James Madison Bulldogs
on Thursday after flying into
Washington late Wednesday night.

Although the Card outshot the
Bulldogs 18-15 and had more
penalty shots, James Madison's
Dianne Cegielski finally put one in
the net with 10 minutes left in the
game. The Card fought back with a
stinging penalty stroke with 6 min
utes remaining but was unable to
score. The Stanford team suffered
a nail-biting 1-0 loss.
"We played intensely to the very
end," Nguyen said. According to
the tri-captain, the Card was able
to dominate most of the match as
every other number but the final
score indicates that the team had
"won in stats."
The Card is not let down by
the two losses it experienced. If
anything, the members are as
fired up and focused for the
remainder of the season as they
ever were before. According to
Nguyen, the half-week trip was a
growing experience for the team,
although winning all three games
would have been even more
rewarding.
"It's just always disappointing
to lose, especially having played as
well as wo did," Nguyen said. "I'd
say we played pretty well."
