# Equestrian opens home slate

### Erin Reilly 
The Cardinal equestrians'
competitive focus was challenged
by minor complications at their
first home competition at the
Red Barn on Sunday.
The late arrival of two open
division horses from Fresno
caused a delayed start and last
minute adjustments. In addi
tion, the riders balanced con
flicting responsibilities of host
ing the full-day competition with
riding against top regional
teams.
Fresno State won champion
and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
won reserve champion honors.
"Sometimes it's a sacrifice to
run the show well," said Stan
ford sophomore Amanda Hoche,
team president. "People think it
is a competitive advantage to
host a show, but we're not only
thinking of riding, we're pulling
all [the organization] together.
And we only use two team hors
es; the rest are borrowed."
The competition horses
included two team horses, two
Fresno horses and 12 horses
loaned by the Stanford lesson
horse program. The Intercolle
giate Horse Show Association
requires all shows to be com
pletely student-organized and
run.
Stanford's highlight was a
first place win by sophomore
Kathleen Gilbert in the second
section of the novice flat compe
tition. The novice division split

into two sections because it was a
large group composed of 19 rid
ers.
"I've been working on every
thing that (English coach) Bar
bara Close drills in practice, and
it feels really good," Gilbert said.
"Now I only need a few more
points to [move up) to the inter
mediate flat division."
Sophomore Vanessa Bartsch
received second place in the first
section.
Close said the team's strength
is its self-sufficiency and cited a
lack of practice time as a deficit.
"So much is done the day of
the show; it's a lot of work,"
Close said. "The riders have
about three lessons per four
weeks and it's not enough."
Close, who is a full-time grad
uate student at Santa Clara,
sometimes gives up to six one
hour lessons per day. Close said
access to horses is also a consid
erable challenge with a team of
16 using four team horses.
Close, the IHSA regional pres
ident, plans to introduce two new
rule changes. In addition to a
change in judging a technical
maneuver known as "switching
leads," Close wants competitors
to have a warmup ride before the
competition (but not on the
horse they will compete on). Cur
rent rules require riders to go
into the arena cold on a horse
they have never ridden.
"I like the level playing field of
drawing horses, but I feel that
riders should be able to warm up

and stretch their legs," Close
said.
"This type of show is difficult
to judge because riders draw
their mounts, and it is hard to
tell when a mistake is the horse
or rider," said horse show judge
Eileen Maxinowski.
At one point, Maxinowski
asked for a re-ride because she
felt the rider did not have a fair
chance due to a difficult horse.
Other competition highlights
included a second-place finish by
sophomore Chandra Christenson
and third place by freshman Lau
ren Patty in the walk-trot class,
as well as a third place by
Bartsch and fifth place by sopho
more Ann Carney in the novice
over fences class. Hoche placed
sixth in the open fences and fifth
in the open flat class.
"With all the new riders and
this being the second show of the
season, today was a lot of good
experience for the next show in
two weeks," Hoche said. "And of
course we couldn't have done it
without the help of the alumni
and the western team."
Former team manager Emily
Jones and former team president
Christina Russell served as show
stewards, and the western team
members assisted in preparing
the horses for competition and
standing by as needed through
out the day. There was no west
ern element to the show.
Stanford will host its next
competition Nov. 11 at the Red
Barn.
