### David Stein Staff writer 
For the first time in Stanford
history, the Dean of Students Of
fice last week issued a report detail
ing various student programs and
services and highlighting the ac
complishments of the past year.
According to Dean of Students
Marc Wais, the document was de
signed to let students "know who
we are and what we do and how we
impact the quality of life for Stan
ford students."
The "we" to which Wais referred
includes 13 separate administra
tive units, from the four ethnic cen
ters to the Women's Center to the
Offices of Judicial Affairs and Stu
dent Activities.
Among the many achievements
Wais indicated, the Stanford Part
nership, a program which gives
funding to campus organizations in
exchange for work by students, re
ceived special attention.
Described by Wais as a "great
success story," the partnership
provided $50,000 from the Stan
ford Fund each quarter last year to
help support student groups. Wais
said that the amount offered each
quarter will be raised to $75,000

this year.
Nanci Howe,
director of the Of
fice of Student Ac
tivities, said the
partnership was
one accomplish
ment which stood
out among many.
"With the
money supplied

by the Stanford Partnership, we
were able to fund leadership con
ferences as well as purchasing sup
plies for various organizations, "
Howe said.
Wais also mentioned the in
creased efficiency of Judicial Af
fairs as a major step in affecting
students' lives.
According to the report, the time
it takes for one case, which usually
involves a violation of the Honor
Code or Fundamental Standard, to
wind its way through the judicial
pathways decreased by 64 percent
last year.
"W r e have been able to go
through the cases more quickly, al
though we've still had time for
some reflection on the cases," Judi
