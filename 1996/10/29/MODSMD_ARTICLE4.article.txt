# Divisive issues
## Local experts see wide gulf in candidates on tax, environment 
### Matt Spence Contributing writer 
Although Stanford voters may
believe they're seeing double
when looking at this year's presi
dential offerings, a deep gulf di
vides Bill Clinton and Bob Dole on
several issues. On tax policies and
the environment, each candidate
offers a clearly different vision for
Stanford voters.
Tax plans
Differences in economic plans
underscore the policy gap between
the candidates. Dole and Clinton
present fundamentally different
tax policies.
Under the banner of supply
side economics, Dole has made a
15 percent across-the-board tax
cut the centerpiece of his cam
paign. Clinton disagrees, favoring
targeted tax cuts instead.
"The purpose of the Dole plan is

to increase eco
nomic growth
and raise income
for Americans,
especially low
and middle-in
come Ameri
cans," said Eco
nomics Prof.
John Taylor, the

architect of Dole's economic plan.
Citing declining wages and a
widening of the income distribu
tion that is hurting middle-income
workers, Taylor argued that "the
Dole program tries to raise the
productivity of these workers by
having greater education, better
skills and more innovation in busi
nesses."
Simplification of the tax sys
tem. a balanced-budget amend
ment and regulatory reform in the
Dole plan would further promote

growth, Taylor added.
Taylor distinguished the Dole
plan from a proposed Clinton tax
cut that is more limited in scope.
Despite Taylor's optimism,
many other noted economists, in
cluding Economics Prof. Emeritus
Kenneth Arrow, winner of the
1972 Nobel Prize in economics, re
mained critical of the Dole propos
al.
"I think at the present stage of
things, when the economy is fairly
close to full employment, a tax cut
of the Dole type is really quite irre
sponsible," Arrow explained. "The
United States in fact is one of the
least tax-advanced nations in the
world. We're not suffering with
any large tax burden."
Arrow believes that spending
cuts to offset the tax would prove
politically unfeasible. The result
ing loss of tax revenue would dras
tically inflate the deficit.
"The federal reserve would
unquestionable raise interest
rates and curtail growth. . . .You
choke off possibilities of making
our industries better and more

competitive.
Taylor disagreed, reasserting
the need for further economic
growth.
"Even though the economy is
at full employment, many people
are hurting," Taylor argued.
"This low-growth, slow wage
growth is the problem. ... Full
employment is not good enough
right now."
Environment
Behind environmental poster
boy A 1 Gore, Clinton earned the
favor of green voters early in his
administration and has held their
general support ever since.
Environmental expert and Bi
ology Prof. Paul Ehrlich praised
Clinton's continued service to en
vironment through vetoing Re
publican efforts to weaken the
Clean Water Act and other such
protections.
Literature from the Clinton
campaign reports that his second
administration would continue to
oppose abolishing the Department
of Energy, cutting the depart
ment's energy efficiency act or at
tempting to weaken the Endan
gered Species Act.
Nature lovers find Bob Dole's
environmental record less glow

ing. In the past year, the former
Senate Majority Leader voted for
limiting classification of new en
dangered species, opening nation
al wildlife preserves to federal
drilling and reducing pollution
regulations for businesses
"I'm a Republican, but there's
no comparison at all," Ehrlich
said. "The record of the Clinton
administration is incomparably
better. ... If one is comparing
Clinton and Dole and one has the
slightest concern for the future of
the planet and our children,
there's no choice."
Yet Dole does not purport to be
a tree-hugger. Instead, the Dole
campaign favors a market-based
approach to environmentalism
and insists that unnecessary regu
lations hurt the U.S. economy.
Taylor praised the economic
benefits of a closer scrutiny of en
vironmental regulations.
"The idea is not to introduce a
regulation where the costs are
greater than the benefits," Taylor
explained. "This is mainly to pre
vent senseless types of regulations
that have negligible benefit to the
environment but have high cost to
society. It makes sure that you put
your environmental policy in the
area where it does the most good."

The Dole campaign promises
funding and personnel cuts in the
Environmental Protection
Agency and the return of more
environmental control to the
states.
Arrow remained skeptical
about the economic and environ
mental impact of Dole's policy.
"If you want to scrap environ
mental regulations, [Dole's pro
gram is] the way to do it," Arrow
said. "You don't act like you're
going to preserve the environment
and enact deregulation at the
same time"
Arrow further concluded that
the economic advantages of Dole's
"deregulation will be quite mini
mal."
Despite his approval of the
Clinton record, Ehrlich cites key
environmental issues that "both
politicians have been generally
chicken to address."
"I would like to see the Clinton
administration institute carbon
taxes, raising the price of gasoline
above bottled water," Ehrlich
said, referring to the need to re
duce pollution.
Ehrlich added population con
tainment and reduced consump
tion policies to his wish list for the
new administration.
