Police have apprehended
three suspects in a burglary that
occurred at Larkin last Tues
day. The three juveniles were
caught when they returned to
Stern Hall yesterday, after
being recognized by several stu
dents
Stanford Police Sgt. Tim
Hanrahan said the three sus
pects were arrested after a brief
chase and later released pending
a decision by the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Of
fice on how to handle the case.
He said police came to the
scene after a call from students
around 3:45 p.m..
Room 125 in Larkin was ran
sacked last Tuesday and both
residents, freshmen Eric Laufer
and Marc Dee, lost a consider
able number of possessions.
Among the long list of stolen
goods were two laptop comput
ers, a CD player, two calcula
tors, a pocket organizer, shoes
and two bottles of Snapple,
Laufer said.

Hanrahan said the suspects
are also thought to have been in
volved in several other recent
robberies in dormitories and
other campus buildings
Laufer said several residents
saw three suspicious-looking
people inside Larkin last week
No one saw the suspects going in
or coming out of the room, but
people remembered seeing juve

hands.
The three juveniles were
spotted again outside Larkin
yesterday by several residents in
the computer cluster who sub
sequently called 911, according
to senior Andy Josephson, a res
ident assistant in Larkin.
The fact that one of the sus
pects was wearing the victim's
shoes was another clinching fac
tor in the identification of the
suspects, Laufer said.
Josephson said Larkin resi
dents realize the theft was "one
isolated incident" and are no
