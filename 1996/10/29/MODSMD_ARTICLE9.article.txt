## Redeemed Jewell cleared of July bombing 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) — For 88 days, Richard
Jewell stoically stood his ground, profess
ing his innocence while he was branded the
FBl's chief suspect in the Olympic park
pipe bombing. Finally cleared by prosecu
tors, the weight of suspicion lifted, he let
his guard down and cried.
The tears came yesterday as he recalled
the bodies of friends injured by the blast,
and when he turned to his mother, who
buried her head in her hand. "Mom, thanks
for standing by me and believing in me," he
said, his voice choking. "I love you."
Another emotion — anger — came out
as he lashed out at reporters and investiga
tors who had depicted him as the man who
brought the specter of terrorism to the
Summer Olympics.
But at the end of the press conference,
he calmly delivered a message.
"I thank God that it has now ended and
that you now know what I have known all
along," he said in a firm voice. "I am an
innocent man."
The July 27 bomb blast at Centennial
Olympic Park — the informal gathering
place for spectators at the Games — killed
one woman outright, was blamed for a
cameraman's death and injured more than
100.
Jewell initially was hailed as a hero for
alerting authorities to a suspicious knap
sack and helping to evacuate the area. He
gave numerous interviews until, three days
after the bombing, The Atlanta Journal-
Constitution reported he was a suspect.
Reporters staked out his apartment
complex for days and followed his every
move, while Jewell refused to comment.
His mother, Barbara, in August tearfully
begged President Clinton to "end this
nightmare."
"I felt like a hunted animal, followed
constantly, waiting to be killed," Jewell
said. "The media said I fit the profile of a
lone bomber. That was a lie. The media
said I was a frustrated police wanna-be.
That was a lie. I was, then and now, a law
enforcement officer."
On Saturday, federal prosecutors gave

Jewell's attorneys a letter clearing him as a
suspect. To Jewell and his attorneys, the
letter is a weak attempt at an apology.
"While the government can tell you that
I am an innocent man, the government's

letter cannot give me back my good name
or my reputation," Jewell said.
"In their mad rush to fulfill their own
personal agendas, the FBI and the media
almost destroyed me and my mother."
