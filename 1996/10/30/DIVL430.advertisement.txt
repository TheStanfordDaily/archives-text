Do you take all of your tests without preparing? Probably not, right?
However, most people take standard I zed tests such as the SAT, (IRK and
GMAT without preparing. They don't consider how much can be gained
through proper counsel and practice. That's where Olin Center Test
Prep comes in. We have seen students with initial diagnostic test scores
in the 50th percentile finish our course in the 90th. What our students
have proven again and again is that test-taking is a skill that you can
master.
We offer a fully comprehensive and personalized educational program
that will increase your chances of gaining acceptance into the
undergraduate or graduate program of your choice. Our courses are 30
hours and cost just a fraction of the price of the mass-market
companies.
