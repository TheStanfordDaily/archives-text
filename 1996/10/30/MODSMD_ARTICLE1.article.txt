# Students for Life garners ASSU funds
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Meeting in a special session, the ASSU Senate
unanimously reversed a contentious decision it
made last week and approved funding for Stanford
Students for Life.
At its meeting, while considering allocations of
Publication Board funds, the senate rejected an
amendment to provide $113 to Students for Life.
The senate's Appropriations Committee had re
moved the money from the allocations bill on the
grounds that Students for Life engaged in partisan
political activities.
This week, ASSU Senator Harris Shapiro, a doc
toral student, made a motion that the senate recon
sider that decision. The senate agreed.
Shapiro and ASSU Senator Mallory Roberts said
they had examined the group's constitution and
statement of purpose.
The senators reported that the documents indi
cated no partisan political goals, restricting the
group's mission to "encouraging" women to examine
alternatives to abortion.
Elizabeth Kerr, an ex officio member of the senate
and a master's student, reminded members that
Students for Life had, in the past, sponsored decid
edly partisan programming.
She offered an amendment suggesting "that be
fore money is transferred to Students for Life, this
group bring before the senate for approval the text of
pamphlets and fliers to be released."
The senate, however, was not swayed.
"Can we really hold current members of the group
responsible for the indiscretions of former members
of the group?" asked Senate Deputy Chair Joe Fre
und, a sophomore.
"I think the argument that years ago this group
did something (controversial] is not entirely valid,"
said ASSU Senator Doug Natelson, a doctoral stu
dent. "The number of students currently in the
group that were here at that time is very small."
ASSU Senator Alane Murdock, a master's stu
dent and the most outspoken critic of Students for
Life during last week's debate, did not attend last
night's meeting.
The senate also approved $12,737.55 in fall quar
ter Community Service Board and Publications
Board funding.
It will meet again next Tuesday to complete the
fall quarter allocations.
