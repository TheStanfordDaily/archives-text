WASHINGTON (AP) - Belea
guered Democratic fund-raiser
John Huang, caught up in a con
troversy over foreign-linked dona
tions to the party, said yesterday
he"was not trying to hide" from
testifying in a federal civil suit.
"I was really trying to stay
away from the harassment of the
media," Huang said in a deposi
tion, repeating several times that
his friends and relatives in the
Washington area had been
"harassed by the media."
Huang, an Asian American
who held a high-ranking position
at the Department of Commerce
before going to the Democratic
National Committee, testified as
part of a civil suit against that
agency.
Among other things, Huang
said, friends reported to him that
Hillary Rodham Clinton had
noted their friendship during an
appearance last Monday at a fund
raiser for Washington state guber
natorial candidate Gary Locke.
Republicans have been hitting
hard at connections between
Huang and the Clintons and have
questioned whether they or the
Democratic Party benefited from
contributions from foreign
sources.
