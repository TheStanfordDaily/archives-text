BEIJING (AP) - Wang Dan,
one of China's best-known dissi
dents and a leader of the 1989
Tiananmen pro-democracy pro
tests, was convicted yesterday of
trying to overthrow the govern
ment.
Wang, 27, was sentenced to 11
year's imprisonment for "conspir
ing to subvert the Chinese govern
ment," the state-run Xinhua
News Agency said in a brief state
ment.
Wang spent 3 1/2 years in
prison for his activities in 1989,
when he was a student leader of
the protests in Tiananmen

Square. After his release, he con
tinued to call for more freedom
and tolerance.
The guilty verdict was almost a
foregone conclusion because most
criminal trials in China result in
convictions.
Ignoring international pro
tests, the government kept the
trial secret, refusing to allow
international observers.
Police cordoned off the court
house early yesterday morning.
They confiscated videotapes from
at least two foreign cameramen
and threatened an Associated
Press reporter with expulsion

from China if he returned.
A court official, contacted by
phone, would say only that the
trial had begun. He would not give
his name. Court and other govern
ment officials have refused to pro
vide more information.
"Every country handles cases
according to its own national
laws," Foreign Ministry spokes
man Shen Guofang told reporters
Monday.
Last December, Wei Jingsheng,
one of the boldest advocates of
democracy and human rights, was
convicted of trying to overthrow
the government and sentenced to

14 years in prison.
The government has crushed
the dissident movement in recent
years. Most active dissidents have
been tried and sentenced to prison
or detained for up to three years in
labor camps without trials.
The police presence outside the
courthouse yesterday was unusu
ally heavy and unusually unpleas
ant, even for China.
Wang was charged and formal
ly arrested Oct. 3, according to a
copy of an indictment released by
Human Rights Watch-Asia.
Authorities told Wang's family on
Oct. 11 to hire a lawyer.
