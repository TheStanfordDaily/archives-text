# Proposition 209 ad wars continue

SACRAMENTO, Calif. <AP) -
Opponents of a campaign to dis
mantle affirmative action pro
grams in California began run
ning a television ad yesterday
showing former Klan leader David
Duke in a white robe in front of a
burning cross.
The ad was unveiled a day
after Bob Dole delivered an
impassioned defense of Proposi
tion 209 and a week after the
state GOP, bowing to legal
threats, pulled a clip of Martin
Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a
Dream" speech from ads support
ing the ballot measure.
Yesterday's $1 million ad cam
paign features Duke at a debate
last month at Cal State-
Northridge, where he argued in
favor of the initiative to abolish
race- and sex-based preferences in
state hiring.
"He's not just another guy in a
business suit," the narrator says.

"Don't be fooled. David Duke
didn't come to California to end
discrimination."
The ad also pictures Duke with
Newt Gingrich and Pat Buchanan
as others who support the mea
sure, as well as showing President
Clinton and Colin Powell as
opposing the initiative.
Supporters of the proposition,
which polls indicate will pass next
week, condemned the commercial
as an act of "pathetic despera
tion." They have always dis
avowed any connection to Duke.
Supporters say the measure is
the next step in creating a color
blind society, while opponents say
it is a thinly veiled attempt to
scuttle affirmative action.
Legal experts caution that the
actual effects of the initiative
won't be known until its constitu
tionality is tested in the courts.
Legal challenges are expected
to delay implementation for years.
