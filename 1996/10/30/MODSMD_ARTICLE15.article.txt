# Gates donates millions
## Harvard to have a new computer center 
### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -
What's $25 million between
friends? If you're Bill Gates, it's
enough to build a new computer
science center at Harvard Uni
versity with one of your best
pals.
The contribution from Gates
and Harvard classmate Steve
Ballmer is the fifth-largest in the
school's history. The building —
named for their mothers — will
house the computer science and
electrical engineering programs.
"What Harvard had as a facili
ty — and I can say this because I
was there a lot — was not a great
facility," Gates said yesterday
from Seattle. "It's gotten better
over the last years, but it's not as
strong as some of the other

departments in the school.
The gift "underscores the
growing importance of comput
ers and information technology
in education as well as in soci
ety," said Harvard President Neil
Rudenstine.
Gates, 41, is the nation's rich
est man, with an estimated for
tune of $14.8 billion. Ballmer, 40,
Microsoft's executive vice presi
dent for sales and support,
reportedly is worth $3.7 billion.
Ballmer and Gates, 41, lived in
the same residence hall in 1973.
While Gates dropped out to start
Microsoft, Ballmer graduated.
"I was sorry to have to leave,"
Gates said. "But the Microsoft
opportunity was one that had to
be seized."
