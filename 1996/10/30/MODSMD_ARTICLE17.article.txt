## Proposition 215: No 
### 
Voters should not try
to bypass the FDA's
drug licensing process

For people blessed
with good health, it may be
hard to imagine the suffering
and pain of those who have life
threatening and perhaps fatal dis
eases such as cancer, glaucoma or
AIDS.

However, voters should
not allow their compassion
for those who have debilitat
ing illnesses to cloud the
right choice on Proposition
215. Voters should vote no on
the initiative to legalize mar
ijuana for medical purposes.
Proponents of the mea-

sure cite a list of medical benefits
stemming from the use of marijua
na. These include:
• Relief of the extreme nausea
brought about by the effects of dis
eases like cancer and AIDS.
• Improvement of appetite in
patients who become violently ill
when they try to ingest any food.
• Relief from abnormally high
pressure on the eye brought about
by glaucoma.
The central tenet of Prop. 215
gives people "the right to use mari
juana where medical use is deemed
appropriate and has been recom
mended by a physician." The bill
would effectively remove the crimi
nal element involved with the
smoking of marijuana by giving the
cannabis plant de facto endorse
ment as a curative drug.
But the medicinal and healing
benefits of marijuana have yet to be
proven scientifically. If the initiative
passes, the state of California, in
bypassing the Food and Drug
Administration and its rigorous
process of drug testing, sets a dan
gerous precedent for other untested
drugs which may have some initial
benefits but may also have harmful
side effects.
As such, the citizens of California
have no business overriding the fed

eral laws designed to protect the
public from bogus or erroneous
claims. It is because the effects of
marijuana, a potent narcotic which
may have salutary tendencies, are
not fully known that not one major
medical or doctor organization,
such as the American Medical Asso
ciation, has come out in support of
the initiative.
The bill is also plagued with
vagaries and weakness of language.
What would the limits of prescrib-

ing marijuana be? Someone
with the flu could light up a
joint on the grounds they are
"seriously" ill and it was
deemed "appropriate" by a
primary care giver.
Additionally, what would be
the limits of where people
could smoke marijuana?

Smoking pot in a restaurant or
other public place could be allowed
as the person can claim he is merely
ingesting "medicine." More trou
bling still, would the state be expect
ed to cover marijuana purchases for
indigents because marijuana would
be classified as medicine?
But perhaps the greatest contro
versy stems from the section allow
ing patients and doctors to grow
their own pot in unlimited quanti
ties. How could any marijuana laws
be enforced if citizens were allowed
to grow their own marijuana?
Indeed, this bill sounds more
like a segue for the full legalization
of drugs than it does for the medi
cal use of marijuana. If the authors
of the bill wanted to create a loop
hole in the current laws for the
sake of opening a greater dialogue
on the contentious issue of illegal
drugs in this country, they should
have done it without the sub
terfuge of this bill.
It is unfortunate the initiative
has neither the medical establish
ment's unqualified backing or the
approval of the FDA. Also, the
vagueness of the language opens up
far too many loopholes that could be
exploited with those who have less
than noble intentions. Vote no on
Prop. 215.
