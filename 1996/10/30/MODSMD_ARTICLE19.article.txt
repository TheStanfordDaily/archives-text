## A 						sad day for the Reverend 
### 
Monday night marked one
of the most interesting occa
sions I've witnessed on this
campus. For those of you who were not
among the packed house in Memorial
Auditorium, I'd urge you to check
tomorrow's Intermission section to find
out when SCBN is airing the replay.
I'll be honest — I believed that the
Rev. Jesse Jackson would completely dis
mantle Dinesh D'Souza on the basis of
his supreme rhetorical skills. Jackson is
one of the most powerful speakers of the
late 20th century, and on countless occa
sions (including last year on this cam
pus), he has proven his ability to connect
with his audience in a way reserved for
the most spectacular of orators.
Boy did he get his ass kicked. It was
nothing short of embarrassing. Jackson
was ill-prepared, appeared tired and vir
tually ignored the fact that he was par
ticipating in a debate instead of a one
man show. Even the strongest oppo
nents of Proposition 209 would have a
difficult time claiming anything except
that Jackson was soundly beaten.
After a gimmicky opening statement,
Jackson repeatedly ignored the ques
tions, apparently believing that the
audience wouldn't notice. For example,
when asked to justify how Jews and
Asians (two minority groups which
have historically faced discrimination)
could be excluded from affirmative
action programs and yet still find them
selves "statistically overrepresented" at

universities, Jackson ducked hard. He
declared his love for Asian Americans
and then awkwardly discussed "the
Indonesian Connection," an apparent
reference to the ongoing Clinton admin
istration campaign finance scandal. So
Jesse, do Asian Americans deserve affir
mative action programs or not?
D'Souza was at times combative and
rude, but he answered every difficult
question, often provoking a bitter
response from members of the audi
ence. At one point, he was asked why
minority voters should trust an initia
tive backed by the Republican Party, a
group not recently known for its com
mitment to the civil rights movement.
D'Souza flatly condemned past Republi
cans who opposed the civil rights legis
lation of the 19605, but he urged the
audience to "move on and face the new,
more complex challenges of the day."
Later, when questioned about elimina
tion of current diversity-ensuring sys
tems, D'Souza declared the need for
socioeconomic preferences as a replace
ment for racial preferences.
Meanwhile, Jackson seemed stuck in
the past. His repeated references to
Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr.
and the 1960s offered nothing new to
the debate. His tired "big tent"
response to charges that racial prefer
ences replace one form of discrimina
tion with another left me wondering if
he believes that "two wrongs make a
right."

At one point he read off the familiar
litany of statistics regarding the num
ber of white male CEOs, professional
sports team owners and former U.S.
Presidents (a quote which I remember
verbatim from his speech in White
Plaza last year). D'Souza responded by
pointing out that most of today's CEOs
were educated in the 1950s when segre
gation was still legal and that women
educated in the last few decades are on
their way to equaling the outcomes.
To put it bluntly, D'Souza said
things many of us don't enjoy hearing
while Jackson said things that we've
already heard. If as D'Souza claims,
"Jesse Jackson defended affirmative
action about as well as it can be defend
ed," I'd say opponents of Prop. 209 are
in deep doo-doo. Who would have
thought that D'Souza would receive
almost as many cheers as Jackson at
the conclusion of the debate? Not on
THIS campus! Judging from the
crowd's reaction, I'd say that this cam
pus and community is far more divided
over the issue than we might have
believed before.

Jim Finsten, a senior majoring in pub
lic policy, believes that Garry Grundy
would have made a far better opponent
for Dinesh D'Souza.
