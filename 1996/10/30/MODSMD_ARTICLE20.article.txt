Take another look at Sand Hill before it's too late

AS MEMBERS OF a public who the
Stanford Daily editorial board believes
will benefit from the widening of Sand
Hill Road (editorial, Oct. 21), may we
have a word?
Your editorial shows how misleading
a cursory reading of the draft environ
mental impact report for the proposed
Sand Hill projects can be. Measuring
projected traffic volumes is not for the
faint hearted, and as traffic specialists
are quick to admit, traffic models oper
ate in a world of prognostication — not
scientific prediction. Look around and
see the effectiveness of traffic models.
It is clear that they have their prob
lems!
For the first time, the city of Palo
Alto is using a dynamic rather than a
static traffic model to justify an opin
ion on a development project. And
already the figures for traffic flow
along University Avenue and at Uni
versity Avenue and Middlefield Road
are shown to be flawed (Crescent Park
Report). But this is a minor detail,
hardly a mitigatable circumstance, as
they say. The fact that the environ-

mental impact report does not ade
quately explain the traffic impact on
Sand Hill Road when the 400,000-
square foot expansion of Stanford Hos
pital is complete in the year 2010 gives
us pause. And the fact that the traffic
report for the Palo Alto Medical Center
expansion on the El Camino Real does
not include traffic flows form the
expanded shopping center is also a
source of concern.
The housing units intended for the
Stanford community are not going to
help poor students with their housing
problems, as you suggest. A few subsi
dized units for junior faculty in the
short run will not make a justifiable
difference. However, if you support the
moratorium on demolition of older
houses in Palo Alto you may be able to
preserve some possible rental units.
When you revisit the environmental
impact report you may want to edit
your comment on the "marginal
increase of mall (sic) space" and see the
950,000 square feet of parking needed
for the increase.
Are we looking at poor management

and irresponsible behavior? No, we are
looking at a human environment.
There is a component in this complex
problem that the new traffic model can
not accommodate — the set of assump
tions around which the data points are
strung. We need to examine the degree
of acceptance of all parties who consider
that they have a stake in the outcome of
their neighbor's intentions.
The cavalier manner in which The
Daily dismisses the arguments of those
of us who have studied the environ
mental impact report as "a small and
determined group of opponents . . .
with a desire to preserve a more small
town feel (sic)" illustrates how out of
touch you are with the problems of city
life and the civic process that must be
examined before decisions are made
which can inalterably change the land
scape for future generations.
Believe those of us who live and
own property in Palo Alto and Menlo
Park when we tell you that nobody
here claims there is any rural atmo
sphere to preserve any more. The car
is king.

You also err when you speak of "the
citizens of Stanford." Stanford is a com
pany town, and residents do not share
the right to examine the employers'
intentions nor those of the directors.
Finally, forgive us if we add that
your insularity is not to be commended
in this case. Try to see the larger argu
ment and address the limitations
inherent in the environmental impact
report process. Better yet, do us all a
service and devise a dynamic traffic
model that illustrates regional traffic
patterns based on Stanford's plans for
long-term future development, as well
as those of all adjacent cities. This is
not an idle request. There is a genuine
need for a toll that we can all under
stand, based on principals, upon which
all the affected parties agree.
