# Editorial was unfair to Patrick Shannon
## 
### 
I was dismayed by Monday's editorial
endorsing Byron Sher for our State Sen
ate seat. Of course, The Daily's editorial
board is entitled to endorse whomever it
pleases; however, your coverage was so
erroneous as to border on blatant bias. I
would like to correct some of The Daily 's
misconceptions about Patrick Shannon
(Sher's opponent).

First, The Daily misrepresented
Patrick Shannon's platform. Although he
is pro-choice and considered environ
ment-friendly, he is not running on
Proposition 209. Mr. Shannon's greatest
concerns deal with criminal prevention
and punishment / rehabilitation.
Second, although The Daily cited
Sher's former faculty position as a con
nection to the Stanford community, The
Daily failed to acknowledge that Shan
non graduated from Stanford in 1986,
was a student leader in his senior year
and still volunteers for the University.

The Daily should be more careful con
cerning the facts before writing an edito
rial.
The Daily mentioned Sher has come
to campus numerous times — well, so
has Shannon. He has spoken on more
than one occasion to the College Republi
cans and Republican Youth Majority. He
also recently visited our campus to man a
booth at the Stanford In Government
Campaign Fair. I do not know about
Sher's volunteer corps, but Shannon had
nearly 50 Stanford students working on
his campaign. Now, who is the candidate

who is closer to the Stanford communi
ty?
Why did The Daily fail to mention all
these facts? Was it a lack of appropriate
investigative skills? A simple call to Shan
non's headquarters, which are coinciden
tally located immediately across Stanford
campus, could have solved any questions
regarding Shannon. Such blatantly
biased editorials make me wonder if The
Daily is a newspaper dedicated to the
facts or a mere tool of a certain agenda.
