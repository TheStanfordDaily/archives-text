# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Halloween vs. Election Day: Voice your choice 
### 
SAD, BUT TRUE. By this time next
week, more students on this campus
will have dressed themselves up in
silly costumes than will have cast votes for
the next President of these United States.
This is a fact. A fact that cannot be disput
ed because I made it up.
Statistics don't lie, and neither do I,
gentle reader, for this is what I have come
to believe, based on what I have observed
on our campus. The most important deci
sion this nation will make in four years is
less than a week away, and all people can
talk about is an annual pagan festival.
"Are you dressing up for Halloween?"
Blah blah blah. "What are you wearing?"
Blah blah blah. "What are you wearing to
the Mausoleum?" Blah blah blah.
Not one person — not one — has asked
me what I'm wearing on Election Day.
They don't ask, and 1 don't tell because
they are not concerned themselves. Most
people know who's running, and almost all
know when Nov. 5 is. But they don't know
if they're going to vote.
Now, none of this dearth of duty is read

ily visible to an outsider. Those who do care
have done their best to make this a voter
friendly environment. Anyone with eyes
now knows that "Prop" (as in Proposition
209) rhymes with "Stop." Also, the ASSU
has done a commendable job hosting
third-, fourth-, fifth-, sixth- and seventh
party candidates. And how 'bout those
Stanford Democrats? (Now there's an
underrepresented group!) Their highly
successful voter registration drive guaran
tees that many more students will be cast
ing liberal ballots in California — instead
of the crucial Midwestern battleground
states.
And while this isn't the '60s, radical
political voices on campus are anything but
silent. Following a natural lull in idealism
that sociologists refer to as "the 1980s,"
political activists at Stanford are once
again on the march. I mean, you are look
ing at the student body that single-handed
ly brought PepsiCo to its knees — to its
kneesl Not to mention, it was here and
nowhere else where one fine spring day
around noon, the world record was set for

the largest group of people ever to watch
other people bare their buns.
So, obviously, I'm not trying to general
ize and make the point that all Stanford
students are apathetic. (I don't need to
make that point.) And I'm not even trying
to say that voter apathy is any more
(a)pathetic here than on other campuses.
In fact, we'll probably have a higher voting
turnout than any other college outside the
Electoral College.
But still, I know a lot of people who
aren't going to vote. That's ironic on a
campus where people are passionate about
not being just a number — an ideal, I
guess, embodied by that special Halloween
costume. It's all about being an individual,
about being seen and being heard. So why
won't we "Rock the Vote"? Don't we all
realize that it's "Choose or Lose"?
Well, many just forgot to register. But
some sincerely fail to see the significance of
their single vote. Others fail to see the sig
nificance of the process, dismissing the
notion that they are electing someone to
"our nation's highest office." And since the

White House is only two stories high, they
have a point.
Despite MTV's media blitzes, our age
group is still the least likely to register or
vote. And if Tabitha Soren can't arouse the
moral and political consciences of our
nation's young people, then who am I to
even try?
But then again, who are we to discard
this wonderful privilege when there are so
many people in this cruel world who are
denied the opportunity?
There are people like my drawmate,
whose recently delivered ballot declared
itself void unless co-signed by a qualified
witness, someone who must be a resident
of his home county. "But this is an absen
tee ballot," he lamented to me. "I'm not
supposed to be in my home county. I'm
supposed to be absent."
Most students may not understand my
friend's dilemma. For most, "politics"
means that you think you are for some
thing and that you know you are against
something else. The Stanford I know and
love is a place where political lines are

drawn acrimoniously between those who
read The Stanford Review and those who
do not — a place where to be called a "con
servative" is a curse, but where a "progres
sive" is merely a social function in an over
crowded dorm hallway.
Therefore, the ballot box is the closest
thing we have to a bully pulpit. The least
we can do is use it.
Now, I could say here that you should
go out and vote so that you can make a real
difference, but as someone voting against
Dole in Kansas, I know better. The truth
is, unless you are one of those few
straight-down-the-ticket Natural Law loy
alists, the candidate behind who you
throw your support may never even know
your name.
So when you vote on Tuesday, don't
necessarily do it for any cause. Do it for
yourself, to hear your own voice.
Oh. and HanDV Halloween.
