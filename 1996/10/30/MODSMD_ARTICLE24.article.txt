## Experts differ in medical marijuana debate Legalization potentially benefits AIDS, cancer and glaucoma patients but has drawbacks 
### Anne Ruimy 
Physicians, scientists and drug experts
associated with Stanford are divided on the
potential benefits of smoking marijuana as
a medicine, which would become legal if
Proposition 215 passes in the November
election.
If the Medical Marijuana Initiative pass
es on the California ballot, patients will be
allowed to smoke marijuana, as long as
they have a recommendation from a physi
cian to use it in the treatment of "cancer,
anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity,
glaucoma, arthritis, migraine or any other
illness for which marijuana provides
relief," according to the text of the proposi
tion.
But not everyone believes marijuana is
safe.
Opponents to the proposition claim that
smoking marijuana may cause "cancer,
addiction, coordination and perception
impairment, a number of mental disor
ders, including depression, hostility and

increased aggressive
ness, general apathy,
memory loss, repro
ductive disabilities,
impairment to the
immune system,
numerous airway

injuries and other seri
ous problems," accord
ing to a statement
issued by Citizens for
a Drug-Free America,
a coalition against

Prop. 215.
Local experts do not

agree on the usefulness of
marijuana for the treatment

of glaucoma and chronic
pain. While physicians can

already prescribe marijuana

tablets, they do not agree on the
need for marijuana to be in a smok
able form.

There is a general agreement among
specialists, however, that marijuana

may De use
ful in the
treatment of

cancer and
AIDS, that it has

low potential for
physical addiction

and that the main physi
cal threat of marijuana

lies in the effects of the
smoke itself.

Potential benefits
Marijuana may be effective in the treat
ment of cancer and AIDS because it stimu
lates the appetite and reduces nausea.
Cancer and AIDS patients often lose a
lot of weight, due directly to their illness or
indirectly to the treatment of the illness.
Dramatic weight loss puts their lives in

even more danger.
The primary treatment for AIDS and
cancer sometimes makes patients violently
ill — in extreme cases they can't keep food
down. For AIDS patients, nausea is some
times worsened by "wasting syndrome:"
With a depressed immune system, the
body does not metabolize food normally
and "wastes away."
Dr. William Rogoway, a specialist in
oncology and a clinical professor at Stan
ford, is skeptical about the effectiveness of
marijuana as a medication to combat nau
sea. He describes it as "rather weak, some
what effective."
But he said he does not discourage his
patients from using it."I have no problem
letting cancer patients use marijuana or
any nonconventional drug if it is not harm-

ful to them and if they feel that it is ben
eficial to them," he said.
In addition to helping terminally ill
patients maintain their weight, mari
juana has the potential to make the
patients' lives more comfortable by

reducing pain.
Experts on both sides admit that
users report a reduction in pain. But
the efficacy of marijuana as a medi

cation for chronic pain
"remains to be seen," said
Asst. Anesthesia Prof. Ray
mond Gaeta, director of Stan

ford's Pain Management
Clinic.
According to Gaeta,
patients who report a
benefit from smoking
marijuana "only have the
impression they do. ... It

is a form of
escapism."
Instead, doctors at
the clinic treat chron

ic pain with approved drugs, which
"work fine," combined with psychologi

cal treatment, Gaeta said.
Marijuana and the brain

Bruce O'Hara, a senior
research scientist who studies
the neurobiology of drugs,
explained that the central ner
vous system probably mediates
the effects of marijuana on
appetite, nausea and pain, as
well as the drug's psychoactive
effects.
Discoveries related to the

effects of marijuana in the brain
have been made relatively recently.
In 1990, a group of scientists published
the first structure of a cannabinoid recep
tor in the brain.
Cannabinoid receptors are the receptors
for tetrahydrocannabinol or THC — the
main psychoactive and medicinal con
stituent of marijuana.
In 1992, another group of scientists
published for the first time the structure of
a molecule produced by the organism that
binds to the same receptors as maryuana.
They inferred that this molecule is proba
bly the "marijuana" naturally occurring in
the body and named it "anandamide,"
from the Sanskrit word "ananda," mean
ing bliss.
O'Hara said the cannabinoid receptor
is part of a large family of receptors in

the brain, which bind the majority of
neurotransmitters (produced natural
ly by the body) and many drugs,
including opiates. When a neuro
transmitter or drug binds to a

receptor, it starts a chain of sig
nals, which eventually causes the
physiological or psychological
effects observed.

According to O'Hara,
there is a wide gap between the
knowledge of how marijuana
interacts with the brain and
how this interaction results in

the reported effects.
"If you look at the
research done before the
19705, you could think

that people smoked mari

juana to get red eyes
and lower their blood
pressure," said
Charles Tart, a former
Stanford postdoctoral
fellow in psychology,

Johnny Zannis — Daily
now a professor emeritus of psycholo
gy at UC-Davis.

Tart conducted a survey of experienced
marijuana users in 1970. More than 150

students and educat
ed professionals
familiar with marijua
na responded to a
questionnaire on their
experience during
intoxication. Some of
the reported effects
are the ones sought by
cancer and AIDS
patients.
A majority of
respondents
answered, in particu
lar, that they "enjoy
eating very much and
eat a lot;" that they
"crave sweet things to
eat like chocolate,
more than other
foods;" that "pain is
easy to tolerate if
[they] keep [their]
attention elsewhere;"
and that they "almost
invariably feel good
when [they] turn on,
regardless of whether
[they] felt bad before
turning on."

Treating glaucoma
The direct physiological effects of mari
juana, particularly for the treatment of ill
nesses such as glaucoma, are even more
poorly understood them the indirect effects
involving the brain.
Glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness,
is caused by abnormally high fluid pres
sure in the eye. Marijuana has been shown
to lower the eye pressure.
However, for Asst. Ophthalmology
Prof. Kuldev Singh, director of the glauco
ma service at the Medical Center, marijua
na is not useful in the treatment of glauco
ma for most patients.
"You would need to smoke it every two
hours or eat it every two hours to lower the
eye pressure. And there are side effects,"
Singh said.
According to Chris Conrad, author of
books on medical marijuana, a certain type
of glaucoma is episodic. Patients with
episodic glaucoma can smoke marijuana
only when needed.

"They see auras. They

feel that they're

about to have an
episode. They
can smoke then,"

Conrad said.
Adverse effects

On Tuesday,
California voters will
be asked to
chose between
the possibility

ofleaving terminally ill
patients without a

medicine in which they find relief
and the risk that loopholes in the
law would lead to increased abuse of

a potent drug, particularly among
teen-agers.
Indeed, more than a medicine, marijua

na is a psychoactive
drug used for recre
ational purposes.
Chronic mari

juana use — continued
use for at least six

months — may cause
"amotivation syndrome and

numbing of a person's ability
to feel," said Asst. Psychiatry

Prof. Robert Matano, director of
the Drug and Alcohol Treatment

Program at the Medical Center.
"When [chronic users] stop taking mar

ijuana, they experience three to four weeks
of withdrawal, of feeling unreal, of being
overwhelmed with feelings of sadness," he
said.
But most specialists agree that marijua
na has relatively low abuse and addiction
potential, and that, if there is addiction, it
is more psychological than physical.
Abuse is defined as continued use of a
drug despite negative consequences. When
a person becomes tolerant of the drug and
experiences withdrawal symptoms in addi
tion to abusing the drug, it is known as
addiction.

"Addiction seems to be linked with the
activation of the reward center in the
brain," O'Hara said. "Marijuana does not
seem to activate the reward center as much
as other drugs, such as cocaine, opiates,
nicotine and even alcohol."
Further controversy surrounds the
need to prescribe "crude marijuana" when
the drug already can be prescribed in the
form of tablets.
Marijuana tablets, with the brand name
Marinol, contain pure THC. Smokable
marijuana is made from the raw leaves and
flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant and
can contain more than 400 different com
pounds.
The complexity of the raw plant is
viewed by some as a disadvantage because
the quantity of THC absorbed cannot be
controlled.
In addition, most experts agree that
smoking any plant material has adverse
effects on the bronchiae, just as smoking
tobacco does.
Others view the complexity of the raw
plant as an advantage because the minor

constituents of the plant may also be bene
ficial. For instance, cannabidiol, a nonpsy
choactive compound in marijuana, may be
useful for muscle control in the treatment
of spasticity, epilepsy and other disorders.
Smoking is also one of the fastest ways
to deliver compounds to the brain — it
does so in a matter of seconds — so that
experienced marijuana smokers are able
to regulate their intake to achieve a
desired effect.
Marijuana, research and the law
One of the reasons for the lack of scien
tific evidence and the present controversy
is that marijuana is placed in "Schedule I"
by the federal government, meaning scien
tists and doctors need a license from the
Drug Enforcement Agency in order to pur
chase it for research purposes.
Drugs placed in Schedule 1 are recog
nized to "have high potential for abuse, no
currently accepted medical use and lack
safety even under medical supervision."
If Prop. 215 becomes state law, marijua
na will not be reclassified. Despite the fact
that there is no known toxic amount of
THC and that at least anecdotal evidence
indicates that it may have some medical
benefits, marijuana will remain in the
same category as heroin and LSD.
Schedule II drugs, that doctors can pre
scribe legally, include morphine (an opiate)
and Marinol (svnthetic THC).
