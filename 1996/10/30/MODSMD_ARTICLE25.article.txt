Q # How do anti-lock brakes
• work?
A. People don't appreciate the
• brakes on their cars
enough.
If you think about it, there are
really not that many ways to slow
down 2,000 pounds of speeding
metal. And if you add the extra
stipulation that it has to be done
safely, your options become quite
limited.
Conventional brakes slow
down a car by using friction to
absorb the energy in the moving
vehicle. This can bo accomplished

a number of ways, but in general,
the point of the braking mecha
nism is to slow down the wheel's
spin.
As the wheels slow down, the
friction between the tires and the
road slows down the car. The
force of friction which the road
can exert on the tires determines
how quickly a car can come to a
stop.
Under normal conditions, a
car operates best when the tires
do not slip on the road. This
means that the parts of the tire
which are touching the road do
not actually move with respect to
the road.
If you look carefully at a car in
motion, you'll see that the bottom
of the tire is actually not moving
forward or backward. If you do
try, though, look from the side,

and try it out in a parking lot, a*
opposed to, say, the freeway.
The reason why slipping is not
good for the car is it allows the
road to exert the greatest friction
al force on the tires. (Both acceler
ation and braking require friction
between the road and the car.)
For two surfaces in contact
with each other but not moving
with respect to each other, the
maximum frictional force is char
acterized by the coefficient of stat
ic friction.
However, when the two sur
faces begin to slip past each other,
the frictional force is then
described by the coefficient of
kinetic friction. Typically, the
coefficient of kinetic friction is
smaller than the coefficient of
static friction.
This means that for the tires

to work optimally, static friction
is good — so slipping is not good.
Unless all of the country's free
way systems were converted into
giant Slip 'n' Slides, you proba
bly wouldn't want your tires to
slip.
Another bad thing about slip
ping is that you lose control of
steering because your tires lose
their grip on the surface, just like
on the Slip 'n' Slide.
So how do anti-lock brakes pre
vent slippage?
Anti-lock brakes work by mon
itoring the speed at which the
wheels are spinning. When the
brake pressure on a wheel
becomes too great, the wheel will
"lock up" and stop spinning. You
know t his has happened when the
tire begins to skid and leave those
nasty black marks on the road

The anti-lock braking system
detects when a tire begins to skid
and releases the brake pressure
slightly. This prevents the brakes
from locking up and sending you
into a calamitous skid.
The brakes are then reapplied
to increase the brake pressure
back up to the skidding point,
where the process starts over
again.
The braking and releasing
cycle can be repeated many times
a second, much faster than a
human can pump and release the
brakes. The net result is that
braking power is increased and
your car can stop in a shorter dis
tance.
Of course, this only applies if
my Slip V Slide idea doesn't
make it through the National
Transportation Safety Board
