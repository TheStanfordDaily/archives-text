# Casper holds first office hours

### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper opened his office doors for an
hour yesterday, giving a handful of
students a unique opportunity to
talk with him one-on-one.
The students each met privately
with Casper in his office in Building
310 between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. The
hour of discussion marked the inau
guration of "Casper's Fortnightly
Office Hours," a program that sets

aside an hour of the president's time every two weeks
for student appointments.
Casper appeared relaxed, with his sleeves slightly
pushed up and his tie loosened. With a wide grin, he
deemed the initial set of meetings a success.
"It is so difficult in my existence, given the de
mand on my schedule, to meet students one-on-one,"
he said "From my point of view, this is very refresh
ing and wonderful. I enjoy it."
The student participants seemed equally
pleased with the chance to briefly have the ear of
the president. Senior Linda Prieto said she enjoyed
her time with Casper and felt her voice had been
heard.
Before her appointment, Prieto set out what she

hoped the meeting would accomplish.
She wanted to talk about higher education admin
istration, a field that she is considering entering. She
said she hoped to ask Casper about his pre-Stanford
experiences and what he sees as the current job mar
ket in university administration.
In addition, Prieto, a resident assistant at Casa
Zapata, said she wished to inform the president
about her house and invite him to visit.
She emerged from her 15-minute session with a
smile on her face. "It was really good," she said, not
ing that Casper had been responsive to each of the is
sues she raised.
Along with answering her questions, Casper
pledged to visit Casa Zapata next quarter, Prieto
said. She said she was most impressed, though, by his
demonstrated interest in what she had to say.
"He's listening," she said. "You can tell by the
questions he asks that he is interested."
Prieto added that she had talked with Casper dur
ing her sophomore year, so she felt little pressure
conversing with him yesterday. She conceded that
the experience could be a bit intimidating for stu
dents who have never met the president but said fear
should not prevent others from signing up.
"I would definitely recommend it to other people,"
she said.
Appointments for future sessions may be made by
calling Casper's secretary at 723-2481.
