## They meet again Cardinal to visit Cal 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford women's
volleyball team (17-2, 10-1 Pacific 10
Conference) will visit archrival Califor
nia (5-14, 1-10) tonight to play the Bears
at 7 p.m. Although Cal has won only one
out of 11 conference matches, the Cardi
nal has good reason not to take the
Golden Bears lightly.
The last time these two squads met,
Stanford was finishing a homestand
during which it dismantled highly
ranked Washington State and Washing
ton. The Card had won 38 straight
matches at Maples Pavilion while Cal
had dropped its first four conference
matches.
What happened next almost provided
the biggest upset in women's volleyball
this season. After falling behind two
games to one, the Golden Bears erased a
13-8 deficit to win game four. Cal con
tinued the momentum, building an 8-1
lead over Stanford in the fifth game.
But Stanford then proved its mettle,
bearing down and mounting a heroic
comeback that ended with a kill from
freshman outside hitter Kerri Walsh,
giving Stanford the deciding fifth game
18-16.
"They thought they were robbed,"
Stanford coach Don Shaw said. "But we
let them off the hook, we should have
finished them off earlier."

The Cardinal will gear itself up for
the Bears, especially because Stanford
dropped its first Pac-10 match of the
season Sunday against Washington
State. The Cougars beat the Card for the
first time ever, ending Stanford's 21-
match winning streak against them.
"We are coming off a loss, and so the
team is definitely going to come out
ready to play," Shaw said.
This time around the Card will also
have junior starting setter Lisa Sharp
ley back in the lineup. Sharpley did not
play against the Golden Bears in the
first meeting because of a sprained
ankle she suffered in practice.
In the first match, 5-foot-8 senior set
ter Catherine Juillard recorded a career
high 63 assists and also added 11 digs.
However, Cal tried to take advantage of
Juillard's size, looking to attack the
areas she was assigned to block.
"Catherine is an excellent setter,"
Shaw said. "But at the net, she does not
have the defensive presence that Lisa
has."
Cal's scrappy play and excellent
defensive capabilities have caused other
teams beside the Cardinal some fits.
Seven of the 14 losses that Cal has
racked up this season have come in five
games. Despite the Golden Bears' dis
mal record, Stanford knows that Cal will
most definitely not give up.
"We have seen what they can do, and
we will respect them," Shaw said.
