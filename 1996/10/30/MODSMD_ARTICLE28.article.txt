# Determination defines Martin
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Erin Martin lives in a small one
room double in Cedro.
Here is a woman who is currently
the third all-time leading scorer in
Stanford women's soccer history, a
woman who scored a national-record
288 goals in her high school career.
Couldn't the University find the senior
star a better room?
"We had to draw unpreferred this
year," said Martin, a finalist for college
soccer's player of the year award. "The
Draw doesn't make exceptions for any
body, you know that."
Martin and her roommate of four
years, Maria Ochoa, have adorned their
door with an array of Halloween deco
rations. Inside that door is a perfectly
made room. No wrinkles on the beds,
no crumbs on the carpet. It looks more
like a doctor's office than a college
dorm room.
Of course, if you know Martin, the
appearance of her room isn't very sur
prising.
"Erin is an incredibly dedicated, dili
gent and disciplined person," said
senior Alyze Lowen, a teammate of
Martin's in both high school and col
lege, and one of her best friends. "She
doesn't drink; she doesn't go crazy at
parties. She's always doing what is
right."
Covering the walls of Martin's half
of the room are soccer posters, two of
them of Pele. "He's as close as I have to
a hero," Martin said, staring at the pic
ture of the greatest player ever to play
the game.
"I mean, he was just amazing, and
what I hear is that he pretty much
taught himself how to play," Martin
said. "That's sort of how I did it too. I
used to just go out in the backyard and
practice moves. I'd do weird things,
funky things, just anything to get to be
able to do more with the ball."
Bill Martin, Erin's father, high
school coach and teacher, marvels at
his daughter's work ethic.
"Erin has very high standards in
everything she does," he said. "She is
extremely self-motivated. Sometimes I
think Erin can be too hard on herself,
too intense, too determined, too
demanding. If anything, she could
stand to relax a little. Some parents
and coaches try to get their kids to
push harder. With Erin it was almost
the opposite."
It has been Martin's work ethic and
skills that have made her a leader on
the Stanford team.
"Erin is going to be a leader on any
team she plays on because she is so
demanding of herself and she expects a
lot out of her game," said Cardinal
coach Steve Swanson. "People see how
hard she works, and they see the flair
and excitement she brings to the field.
I'd love for my daughters to emulate
the way Erin plays on the field."
Martin's astounding numbers say
all there is to know about her playmak
ing ability. Her 288 goals for Temple
City High School in Arcadia, Calif.,
broke former national team player

Karen Jennings' record by 58. She
averaged better than three goals a
game over her four-year career, and
once poured in 11 goals in a single
match. In addition, she set the Califor
nia state record for assists. At Stan
ford, Martin is third all-time in points
(120), goals (46) and assists (28). She
has scored three goals in one game five
times.
"Soccer is terribly important to
Erin," said Martin's mother, Mary,
who has been to every game in which
her daughter has played over the past
eight years. "But I think you can see
how important her education is to her
also. She was offered a scholarship to
North Carolina, which was at the time

the best program in the country. She
chose Stanford because it has the best
mix of academics and soccer for her."
But Stanford fans won't get to see
Martin for much longer. Her collegiate
career is coming to a close.
"I wish I had a few more years;
these have been the best of my life,"
she said. "I'm hoping to keep playing
soccer, maybe in the professional
league in Japan. I'd like to play for as
long as I can, then maybe go back to
school."
But while the future may be uncer
tain for this premedical student with a
major in human biology, Martin still

carries a confident and calming
presence to the field with her.
"E-Mart always has every
thing under control," said
sophomore goalie Erin Bryla.
"When we've been in close
games, Erin Martin has always
stepped up when we needed her.
We'd be struggling, and then
Erin would score a goal and
everything would be all right
again. Or they'd be attacking
and then Erin would get the ball
and juke the pants off somebody
and we'd start to say, 'Hey,
we're a great team, now let's get
it going.' "
In fact, Martin's calming pres
ence follows her off the field as
well. "Erin is a loyal, dedicated
and trustworthy friend," Lowen
said of her long-term pal.
"My dad passed away when I
was a junior in high school. It
was the hardest time of my life,
and Erin was always there, sup
porting me, talking to me. If
there was one person who really
pulled me through that time, it
was her," Lowen said.
Perhaps the hardest moment
of Martin's life came during her
freshman year of high school.
"One of the most frightening
things we've ever gone through
was when Erin broke her leg,"
said her father. "Our first ques
tion was, 'Is she going to be able
to play soccer?' Already soccer
was so important. The doctors
said they didn't know if her leg
would grow back properly.
"Well, to see the dedication
and months and months of work
it took for Erin to get back into

top form was just amazing. She
was in a cast up to her hip for six
or seven weeks, but she worked
all the way back to where she

was.
"When she puts her mind to
something, Erin always does the
absolute best job she can. If she

were painting a fence, she'd
make sure she did it just right."
Or if she were cleaning her
room.
