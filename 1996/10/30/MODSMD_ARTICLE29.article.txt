The Stanford women put in
yet another impressive showing
on the links on Sunday and Mon
day, marching through the draw
to an impressive win in the Rolex
National Intercollegiate Match
Play Team Championships.
The tournament, held on the
Tom Weiskopf Private Course in
La Quinta, Calif., featured the
top eight teams from last year's
NCAA tournament. Although
the match-play format uses a
point scoring system different
than that used in other NCAA
competition, the Cardinal golfers
were not fazed.
The road to the tourney title
began Sunday with a win over the
UCLA Bruins by a margin of 3-2
in the best-of-five match. Seniors
Mhairi McKay and Andrea Baxter
were unflappable; both of them
won matches which were not
decided until the final hole.

McKay's and Baxter's match
es were both decided by a margin
of 1-up, which means the winner
won one more hole after a round
of 18. Combined with the win of
freshman JaeJean Ro, who won
by a convincing margin of 6 and
4, which means six holes up with
four left to play, the matches
propelled the Cardinal into the
semifinal round later in the
afternoon.
In the semifinals, the team
squared off against the Lady
Longhorns from Texas. Texas,
fresh off a morning win over a
very talented Arizona team,
proved to be a real test of Stan
ford's mettle. Ro once again
gained a victory, this time by the
margin of 3 and 1, as did sopho
more Michelle Sperry, also win
ning 3 and 1.
Freshman Julie Dunn's
match ended in a stalemate, giv
ing the Cardinal an additional
half-point and a tie in the match.
However, due to a tie-breaker
based on overall team scoring,
Stanford prevailed, advancing to
the championship final against
chief rival San Jose State.
On Monday morning, it was
clear that the Stanford team had
come to play, looking to avenge
last week's loss to the Spartans.

The Cardinal only dropped one
match on Monday, as Baxter,
Dunn and Ro all notched victo
ries by margins of 4 and 3, 5 and
4, and 1 up, respectively. McKay
picked up the other half-point
for the Cardinal, halving her
match.
All told, it was a good two
days for the team members, as
they not only got back to their
winning ways but also proved for
the first time this year that
Stanford is a team that must be
reckoned with come NCAAs.
