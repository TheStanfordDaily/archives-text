# Carson disputes Prop. 209 commercial
## History professor says message misinterprets Martin Luther King Jr.'s words 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
A controversial ad using the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.'s words to support California's
Proposition 209 misrepresents the civil rights
leader's position on affirmative action, a Stanford
professor said.
A TV commercial, which was broadcast last
Thursday and has since been pulled, featured an

eight-second clip of King's "I Have a Dream"
speech, the historic 1963 address in which he
looked forward to an America where people
would not be judged by the color of their skin.
The ad prompted the heated debates over the
interpretation of King's beliefs and the California
Republican Party eventually decided to cease
broadcasting it.
Prop. 209 — also known as the California Civil
Rights Initiative — proposes to eliminate afifir

mative action programs in the state.
According to History Prof. Clayborne Carson,
director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers
Project, the ad's creators used King's words with
out regard to his life work.
"If you look at King's work, he favors much
more far-reaching programs than affirmative ac
tion," he said. "To assume that he would have
been reluctant to adopt affirmative
action because it would somehow
contradict meritocracy may be
[Prop. 209 supporters'] belief, but it
is not King*s."
Carson was hand-picked by
King's widow, Coretta Scott King,
to be the senior editor and director
of a 14-volume edition of King's
most significant writings. As a re
sult of Carson's selection, the pro
ject became a cooperative venture
with Stanford in 1985.
Emory University and the King
Center for Nonviolent Social
Change in Atlanta are also involved
in the joint project.
According to Carson, King's
speeches during his later years ad
vocated major economic reform that
went far beyond the kind of affirma

tive action programs that are so con
troversial today.
King advocated large expendi
tures of governmental funds to rem
edy the setbacks of the past, warn
ing that racial justice would be
achieved only when the "whirl
winds of revolt" shook "the founda
tions of our nation."
Affirmative action programs
were actually established in the af
termath of King's assassination to
serve as a "safety valve for fester
ing black resentment," Carson
said.
According to Carson, affirmative
action is the most conservative pro
gram of all and the "least that
should be done." If instead unequal
public education at the elementary
school level were rectified, the de
mand for affirmative action would
be less.
But society believes such pro
grams are too costly, Carson said.
