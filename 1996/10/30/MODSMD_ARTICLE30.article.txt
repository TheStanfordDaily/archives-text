# Kickers greet Spartans
## 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Men's soccer looks to extend
its two-game winning streak
today as the team takes on San
Jose State to conclude its three
game homestand before heading
to Moraga to take on St. Mary's
Nov. 7.
The Cardinal (7-4-4, 3-2-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) has won its last two games,
beating UC-Irvine on Friday 2-1
and UC-Santa Barbara 3-1 on
Sunday. After weeks of playing
well without winning, these con
tests were particularly satisfying
for the Card.
"We're pretty happy with the

results of last weekend," said
senior midfielder Steve
Kirschbaum, "but there is
always room for improvement.
We would like to win our third
game in a row and finish out the
season strong."
Perennial rival San Jose
State (7-4-3, 2-1-2 Western Ath
letic Conference) is also looking
for a victory to improve on an
already impressive season which
includes handing No. 3 Califor
nia its first loss of the season.
The Spartans, known to play
aggressive and smart ball defen
sively and utilize a short and
physical game offensively, will
not give anything away to the
Cardinal.
San Jose State players to
watch for are its two premier
goal scorers, sophomore striker
Arnan Kebreab, who leads the
team with nine goals and four
assists, and freshman forward
Chad Harper, who is second on
the team with eight goals and 18
total points.
Also watch sophomore mid
fielder Adriano Allain, who has

been able to use his 6-foot-3
frame to collect four assists this
season, and junior goalkeeper
Brandon Main, who has a
respectable 1.50 goals-against
average.
Though San Jose State has
two real scoring threats, the Card
will stick to its normal game plan,
making no major adjustments for
the Spartans' style of play. The
team will use no special markups,
but will try to play smart defen
sively and counterattack fre
quently to catch the Spartan
defense off guard.
One crucial element of the
Cardinal victories last weekend

was getting on the board first,
which set the tone for the
remainder of both games.
Though Stanford will clearly be
at an advantage if it can score
first against San Jose State, the
Spartans are known to fight
hard for all 90 minutes.
"San Jose State is always pret
ty physical," Kirschbaum said.
"They are always a really tough
team to beat. It will surely be a
close and hard-fought matchup."
The Cardinal is hungry for
this victory, which would give
the team three wins toward its
goal of winning its last five
games.

"It's going to be a tough
game," said sophomore midfield
er A.J. Sauer. "San Jose State is
one of our biggest rivals. Since
they are now ranked higher than
us in the West Coast rankings,
there is added incentive to bring
home a win."
If the Cardinal does accom-;
plish its goal of winning the last
five games of the season, Stan
ford will end up 10-4-4, which
would leave the team with dou
ble the victories it earned last
season. It might also give the
team a slight chance of receiving
an invitation to the NCAA tour
nament.
