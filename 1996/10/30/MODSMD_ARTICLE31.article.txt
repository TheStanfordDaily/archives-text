No parallel could have been sweeter for Cardinal soccer this weekend, as both the men's and women's teams garnered two
victories apiece at home douhleheader games. Ironically enough, both the men's and women's teams won their second games
with hat tricks
In the men's second weekend game against UC-Santa Barbara, the Cardinal defeated the Gauchos 3-1. Those three goals
were all made by sophomore midfielder Jamie Clark, a transfer from North Carolina. Clark scored the only goal of the first half
in the first 15 minutes of the game, then scored on a penalty kick and then finally notched his final goal in the last 15 minutes
of the game.
Similarly, sophomore midfielder Tracye Lawyer brought the women's team to a 3-1 victory in the weekend game against the
Washington Huskies. Lawyer, who also competes on Stanford's track and field team, made the first goal within 5 minutes of
the game's start. This was the only goal of the first half, as it was for the men. In the second half, lawyer waited just 5 min
utes before racking up another point and then finished off the Huskies with her third goal
