# Jewish community discusses Hillel leadership

Almost seven months after the retirement of
20-year Hillel Rabbi Ari Cartun, the Stanford
Jewish community met last night in the School
of Education to discuss the current state of Hillel
leadership and student involvement.
The crowd consisted of staff members of Hil
lel, the Jewish student organization, joined by
board members, community representatives and
students. Attendees seemed generally satisfied
with the programming and leadership of the in
stitution, but there was concern over the denom
ination of religious services and the role in the
Hillel community of Patricia Karlin-Neumann,
one of three new associate deans for religious life
at Stanford.
Only about a dozen people attended, but se
nior Seth Yoskowitz, chair of the Hillel Pro
gramming Committee, said he feels the low
turnout is evidence that Jewish students on cam
pus are satisfied with their religious experiences.
"Last year, there was some uncertainty about

'I think people need the opportu
nity to get to know the new rabbi
in a personal setting.'

the future of the Jewish community, and the
meeting allowed people to express their con
cerns," he said.
According to Yoskowitz, Jewish students
might be more at ease with the religious activities
being provided because the transfer of Hillel lead
ership was completed without incident. Deborah
Sloss-Kelman has been serving as interim execu
tive director at Hillel since Cartun's departure.
Board member Edith Gelles, a senior scholar
at the Institute for Research on Women and
Gender, also expressed satisfaction with the way
that Hillel has been run so far this year.
However, she said she does see a split between
Jewish students and the new rabbi.

"I think people need the opportunity to get to
know the new rabbi in a personal setting," Gelles
said.
According to some at the meeting, Jewish stu
dents do not have a specific rabbi to call their own
in the current setup. In order to remedy the ap
parent void in religious and scholarly connec
tion, Hillel officials said they plan to include Kar
lin-Neumann in more Jewish events so that "she
is more accessible and less intimidating," Gelles
said.
However, there was concern over how much
time the rabbi could contribute to the Hillel since
her primary responsibilities are with the campus
ministry.
Also at the meeting, senior Gina Warnick
questioned the kinds of services being offered at
Hillel.
"The fact that conservative services are held
once a week while reform services are only held
once a month sends a signal to reform Jews that
they need not pray together as frequently," said
Warnick.
