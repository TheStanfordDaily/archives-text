# Panel looks at future of IDPs
## Involvement, review process discussed 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
Faculty involvement and pro
gram review were among the major
topics discussed yesterday as a panel
of faculty and students convened to
talk about the future of interdisci
plinary programs.
More than 25 percent of under
graduates receive degrees in such
programs, said ASSU Special Pro
jects Director Michael Putnam, who
moderated the discussion. Now a se
nior in science, technology and soci
ety, Putnam was very active in the
movement to save the program after
elimination of the STS major was
proposed last spring.
It is good to see "students are tak
ing control of their own education,"
said Vice Provost for Undergradu
ate Education Ramon Saldivar.
"They are not just passive recipients
of knowledge."
The review process for interdisci
plinary programs came up early in
the meeting.
Human Biology Program Chair

Russell Fernald, a psychology pro
fessor, praised the rigorous review
that these programs are subjected to
regularly Duringthe meeting at the
Braun Geology Corner, he displayed
overhead charts showing the high
ratings students gave to the Human
Biology Program when rating
teaching quality.
"It's overdue for departments to
get the same kind of scrutiny," he
said.
But Symbolic Systems Program
Chairman and Linguistics Prof.
Tom Wasow pointed out that inter
disciplinaiy programs have no facul
ty appointments. All faculty in these
programs belong to specific depart
ments and choose to devote time to
teaching interdisciplinary courses.
This fact played a role in Fer
nald's statistics, he said.
Interdisciplinary programs
"tend to attract faculty who are
committed to undergraduate educa
tion," Wasow said.
In addition, the panel was heavi
ly concerned with the difficulty of
maintaining faculty involvement
for extended periods of time.
According to Materials Science
and Engineering Prof. John Brav
man, senior associate dean for stu
dent affairs at the School of Engi
neering, a critical problem for STS
was the "revitalization of faculty in
volvement. Many early participants
had moved on."
Fernald pointed out that the
Human Biology Program is not in
vulnerable.
"The generation of people that
founded it have consistently con
tributed (to the curriculum)," he
said. But when a generational tran
sition takes place, and the program
is "without new faculty, we would
have the same problem as STS."
Wasow said he believes the
bitfiiest obstacle hindering faculty

from joining interdisciplinary pro
grams is incentive.
"Most faculty are a part of inter
national scholarly communities,"
he said. "The work that we do in [ in
terdisciplinary programs 1 is unlike
ly to get recognition from that com
munity."
Wasow also said he feels the Uni
versity did not allot enough re
sources to supply that incentive.
Bravman disagreed with that as
sertion.
"At least from the Engineering
School's point of view, we're a pret
ty damn entrepreneurial place," he
said. Both faculty and students
have a great degree of freedom to do
what they want, although they are
"sometimes thwarted by institu
tional barriers," he added.
"If a group of three to five peo
ple had significant interest in sav
ing STS, it would have happened,"
Bravman said. "We put the re
sources on the table. The [amount
of] resources is an issue, but facul
ty involvement is also an issue."

Saldivar discounted the notion
that money is the incentive for
teaching interdisciplinary courses.
"It's a chance to take part in some
thing that is really cutting-edge," he
said.
Interdisciplinary programs are
likewise a positive experience for
students, according to Teri Stein, a
senior in modern thought and liter
ature.
"I was surprised and pleased by
the intellectual support 1 found,"
she said, adding that she has found
her academic environment to be
very "nurturing," much in part be
cause "all the faculty teach what
they want to teach. Each brings in
their own perspective."
Overall, the members of the
panel said they felt very positive
about the future of interdiscipli
nary programs. "I predict that we
are entering a period where Ithe
programs] will become more sta
ble and [established] depart
ments become less so," Bravman
said.
