Stanford Police are looking for
four suspects involved in at least one
assault and a strong-arm robbery
early Sunday morning.
Shortly after midnight, four men
unaffiliated with the University at
tempted to enter a party at Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said. Afler
they were refused entry, the men al
legedly argued with those control
ling access before walking off.
Freshman Rudy Ruiz and sopho
more Francisco Ruiz, both mem
bers of the Stanford wrestling team,
were approaching the party when,
according to Rudy Ruiz, they no
ticed the argument in progress.
At first, he said, they thought
that the argument was a joke. As the
four men passed the students, one
asked Rudy Ruiz, "What are you
looking at?"
Ruiz said he was walking away
when he was shoved twice. "I fell
down the second time," he said. "I
must have been kicked more than

once because I
have more than
one injury."
He was taken to
the hospital and
received six stitch
es for a laceration
to his right eye
brow.
The men also
chased Francisco

Ruiz, but he escaped injury
Police arrived at the scene three
minutes after the assault because
they had been called during the ar
gument, Xiemeyer said, but the sus
pects had already run ofT.
Only two hours later, a man re
turning to his parked car in the
Roble lot was accosted by four indi
viduals who were attempting to hot
wire his car, Niemeyer said.
The victim, who is not affiliated
with the University, had driven
three friends in his restored 1969
Mustang to a dance party at Tresid
der Union.
