## 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Contributing writer 
Stanford Police are looking for
four suspects involved in at least one
assault and a strong-arm robbery
early Sunday morning.
Shortly after midnight, four men
unaffiliated with the University at
tempted to enter a party at Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said. Afler
they were refused entry, the men al
legedly argued with those control
ling access before walking off.
Freshman Rudy Ruiz and sopho
more Francisco Ruiz, both mem
bers of the Stanford wrestling team,
were approaching the party when,
according to Rudy Ruiz, they no
ticed the argument in progress.
At first, he said, they thought
that the argument was a joke. As the
four men passed the students, one
asked Rudy Ruiz, "What are you
looking at?"
Ruiz said he was walking away
when he was shoved twice. "I fell
down the second time," he said. "I
must have been kicked more than

once because I
have more than
one injury."
He was taken to
the hospital and
received six stitch
es for a laceration
to his right eye
brow.
The men also
chased Francisco

Ruiz, but he escaped injury
Police arrived at the scene three
minutes after the assault because
they had been called during the ar
gument, Xiemeyer said, but the sus
pects had already run ofT.
Only two hours later, a man re
turning to his parked car in the
Roble lot was accosted by four indi
viduals who were attempting to hot
wire his car, Niemeyer said.
The victim, who is not affiliated
with the University, had driven
three friends in his restored 1969
Mustang to a dance party at Tresid
der Union.
According to N'iemever, w hen


Niemeye
the man and his friends walked
back to Roble Hall, they noticed sev
eral individuals in and around the
car.
One individual was under the
hood, attempting to hot-wire the
Mustang. Anot her individual was in
the driver's seat trying to get the car
started.
As the group approached the car,
they could hear the car's engine
revving and could see that the dri
ver's side window was broken.
Niemeyer said that when the
Mustang's owner approached the
suspect in the driver's seat, the pri
mary suspect allegedly got out of
the car and punched the owner.
After being punched, the victim
slammed the Mustang's hood in an
attempt to thwart the suspects. The
primary suspect, however, got back
into the driver's seat and attempted
to start the Mustang again,
Niemeyer said.
The victim and his friends ran to
find a phone and saw the suspects
reopen the hood. While the owner
and his friends were searching for
help, the suspects managed to steal
a stereo from the Mustang and
"jump all over the car, causing con
siderable damage," said Niemeyer.

While his friends continued to
search for a phone, the Mustang's
owner returned to his car armed
with a beer bottle. The primary sus
pect, still in the front seat, then al
legedly threatened the owner.
The owner then threw the bottle,
after which, according to Niemeyer,
the four suspects descended on
him.
Niemeyer said someone hit the
victim on the head with a metal ob
ject, possibly the door frame.
The primary suspect got back
into the Mustang, succeeded in
starting it and backed out.
One of the victim's friends, how
ever, found a phone. The sound of
breaking glass and loud noises com
ing from the commotion apparently
caused some confusion and, accord
ing to Niemeyer, police reported to
the scene thinking shots had been
fired.
Police pulled up as the primary
suspect was backing the Mustang
out. The suspect subsequently
backed into another parked car in
the Roble lot before finally aban
doning his attempt to take the Mus
tang, ju raping out of the vehicle and
driving off in a white Oldsmobile
Cutlass with the other suspects.
A responding officer chased the
Cutlass, but the suspect refused to
obey the officer's commands to pull
over until he reached the Kappa
Sigma parking lot.

After pulling over in front of
Kappa Sig, the primary suspect
jumped out of the Cutlass and took
off on foot. He is described as being
20 to 25 years old, weighing 180
pounds and wearing a blue jacket
with light colored pants.
The suspect's street name is
thought to be "Face," and Nicmey
er joked that police are currently
trying to "put a name to the Face."
According to Rudy Ruiz, his as
sailants were four black men, all
around 6 feet tall.
One suspect had bushy hair,
while another, who was the largest
of the four, had a shaved head and
wore a short-sleeve tan shirt, he
said. The third suspect was skinny.
When told the description of the
primary suspect in the Roble inci
dent, Ruiz said it sounded like one of
the suspects involved in his assault.
Niemeyer said it is possible there
is a connection between the assault
and the incident at Roble.
The other suspects who were in
the Cutlass claimed not to know
anything concerning the Roble inci
dent. Two juvenile girls have since
been picked up and brought to Stan
ford for questioning concerning the
Roble incident.
Anyone who saw anything or
knows the identities of individuals
involved with the assaults is asked
to contact the Stanford Police at
723-9633.
