# The 						challenger
## Brink puts focus on education 
### Emily Richmond Contributing writer 
Ben Brink believes he is representative of Silicon
Valley, and he's asking the voters of the 14th District
to give him an opportunity to prove it.
A Palo Alto resident, business executive and Repub
lican, Brink is challenging the Democratic incumbent,
Anna Eshoo.
Brink graduated from Stanford in 1974 with a bach
elor's in math and master's in operations research and
then went on to Harvard University for his MBA.
While his opponent has a long history of political
representation, Brink's experience is largely as a man-

ager in the technology industry. He
currently is chief operating officer
of the Engineering Consortium,
which manufactures computer
chips for the hearing industry.
Brink's lack of legislative experi
ence isn't reason for concern, ac
cording to sophomore Jonathan
Russell, president of the Stanford
College Republicans.

"I wouldn't describe Eshoo's four years in Congress
as a tremendous amount of experience," said Russell.

"Ben Brink has real-world experi
ence that he has acquired right
here in Silicon Valley."
The main focus of Brink's sec
ond campaign for Congress — he
was defeated by Eshoo in 1994 —
has been demonstrating his knowl
edge and concern about technology
and education.
Brink said he believes the pro
hibitive cost of higher education
should not be the motivating factor
in reducing the requirements for a
degree.
"I don't think we should lower
the standards because the cost is
too high. I've had a lot of benefits of
education, and I know how impor
tant it has been in my life," Brink
said.

Society is moving toward a
stronger emphasis on knowledge,
said Brink.
"We're moving from the indus
trial age into the knowledge age. ..
where the acuity of mind and
knowledge becomes the absolute
most important factor for success
and a meaningful life," he said.
Brink also expressed concern for
the future of American technology
and the ability of the United States
to compete on the open market,
which has greatly expanded in re
cent years.
"We're in a world today where
an Indian computer programmer
at a 10th of the cost can produce a
computer code every bit as good as
that produced in Silicon Valley,
and they can communicate with
the customer over the Internet,"
said Brink. "They are competitive,
and the only way we can stay
ahead is to try to get (Americans)

the best education."
Brink, who is a member of the
Naval Reserve, remarked that his
enlistment was unusual for the
time.
"I started Stanford at a time
when you were not going into the
Reserves as a way to pay for
school," Brink said. "In 1971, there
was such incredible pressure in my
generation to have nothing to do
with the military."
Brink said joining the Navy was
a rebellion against his peers.
"It was the way I felt I could
serve my countiy," he said. "My re
bellion was against my own genera
tion, not against my parents.'"
His political interests began at
an early age and continued through
his high school and college years.
"I was very active politically at
Stanford. I was president of the
Young Republicans," Brink said.
Brink, who considers himself a

Goldwater Republican, admitted
that such a description contradicts
the standard party definition of a
Republican.
"The moderates consider me an
acceptable conservative, and the
conservatives consider me an ac
ceptable moderate," Brink said. "I
don't really fit in the current politi
cal camps within my political
party."
Restructuring how students fi
nance their education is among the
educational issues Brink would like
to tackle as a congressman.
"I am big believer in loans, as
opposed to grants. I would like to
see a universal system which is not
based on economic status of the
student's parents but rather
based on the student's needs for
their particular education," said
Brink.
"It would then be paid back out
of their earnings. The ability to pay

based on the benefit received
should be the basis of the repay
ment of the loan, rather than the
way it's currently done," he said.
Brink added that his universal
loan concept is still in its formative
stages and that the details have yet
to be laid out. However, Brink feels
strongly that the premise of his
plan is valid.
"Essentially, I like the idea that
students could receive a loan for 80
percent of their costs. For every $1
received, they would pay back $2.
That would be the only interest
rate they would accrue," Brink ex
plained.
"The amount that they would
pay back would be a percentage of
their income, which would be larg
er for a person who made a lot of
money and less for a person who
made a little money. We could do
away with all the deferments and
all the administration."

Such changes would simplify a
complex system, Brink argued.
