## Brink puts focus on education

Ben Brink believes he is representative of Silicon
Valley, and he's asking the voters of the 14th District
to give him an opportunity to prove it.
A Palo Alto resident, business executive and Repub
lican, Brink is challenging the Democratic incumbent,
Anna Eshoo.
Brink graduated from Stanford in 1974 with a bach
elor's in math and master's in operations research and
then went on to Harvard University for his MBA.
While his opponent has a long history of political
representation, Brink's experience is largely as a man-

ager in the technology industry. He
currently is chief operating officer
of the Engineering Consortium,
which manufactures computer
chips for the hearing industry.
Brink's lack of legislative experi
ence isn't reason for concern, ac
cording to sophomore Jonathan
Russell, president of the Stanford
College Republicans.

"I wouldn't describe Eshoo's four years in Congress
as a tremendous amount of experience," said Russell.
