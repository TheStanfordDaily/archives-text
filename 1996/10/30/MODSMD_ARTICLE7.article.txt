## Eshoo fights for research funds 
### Emily Richmond Contributing writer 
U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo says she
has represented the 14th District,
which includes Stanford, with a clear
understanding of her constituents'
needs and concerns.
Those have ranged from federal
funding for scientific research to ed
ucation to women's health. Eshoo is
prepared to continue her work for a
third term.

These sentiments were made clear last week as
Eshoo spoke before a group of almost 100 Stanford sci
entists.
Eshoo, a Democrat, was elected to Congress in 1992.
She has also served on the San Mateo Board of Supervi
sors and as the chair of the San Mateo County Democ
ratic Party and received numerous awards for her work.
As she discussed the diminishing budget for Ameri
can science and technology research, Eshoo emphasized
that she will continue to fight for increased funding.
Eshoo said she wants a revised federal budget to re-

fleet a renewed concern for nurtur
ing the scientific community.
"In 1995, $11 billion was added
on to the (Department of) Defense
budget — $11 billion more than the
Pentagon even requested," she said.
Jennifer Love, a master's stu
dent in chemistry who attended the
speech, said, "I'm really interested
in what the outlook for science and
research funding is." Love added
that she will probably vote for Eshoo
on Tuesday.
Michael Chabinyc, also a chem
istry master's student, endorsed
Eshoo as well, although he ex

pressed some reservations.
"I think everyone agrees that
there's a problem, and they should
increase funding. But... she lacked
specifics," he said. "I'll probably
vote for her. Obviously, she's going
to vote for science, and this is a high
tech district."
According to Eshoo, a critical
component of her constituency is
women.
"There are 435 (representatives)
in the House and 48 women," she
said in an interview. "The fullness of
a democracy can't be enjoyed — or
the promise of a nation — unless
every citizen is optimized."
"Whether in academics, in poli
tics or in the corporate community,
women are going to continue to
enter all of these institutions in

greater and greater numbers, which
says to me that it's going to keep
pushing the edges of the envelope
out," she said. "Unless and until
there are women at the top who will
reach down into the rungs to bring
women up, the glass ceiling won't be
shattered once and for all."
Eshoo said she is concerned
about the rising cost of education.
Such concerns motivated Eshoo
to introduce the Higher Education
Appreciation Plan to Congress,
which would reward parents who
begin saving for their children's ed
ucation early and prohibit penalties
for withdrawing those savings to
pay for educational needs.
"Our students are incurring
greater and greater debt burdens,"
she said. "What I've introduced in

the Congress recognizes the increas
ing cost of both public and private
education and would reward, as a
nation, especially from the begin
ning, parents saving for their chil
dren's education."
Eshoo hopes to get the bill
through Congress and noted that it
has received public support from the
Clintons.
In addition to science, technology
and education, Eshoo sees women's
health as a major area of concern for
citizens in her district.
"Women's health issues have not
been dealt with for the longest
time," she said. "And so the incre
mental advancements that we now
see (in more equal funding for re
searching women's health), women
in the Congress changed that. And

we have to keep building on that."
" The Bay Area has a higher rate
of breast cancer than any other re
gion in the country, and we need to
know why. We need to invest more
in order to bring about the cures,"
Eshoo added.
Eshoo sees such issues as evi
dence of the continued and expand
ed presence of women in govern
ment.
"Men will say to me, 'Why do you
think it's important? What's the dif
ference between having women and
men (in Congress)? Is it just to raise
the numbers?'
"And my response is always this:
It's not because we're better.... It's
because we have different life expe
riences, and we speak to those,"
Eshoo explained.
