Last week in this section, there was a classified that re
ferred to being a "fat, pimply, disgusting creature." While we
dearly love the person who wrote that (no, in fact, the editors
of Intermission don't write everything) we nonetheless would
like to go on the record as saying there is absolutely nothing
wrong with being fat or pimply or disgusting. We're OK, you're
OK. That's all for this week.
To join the self-esteem fiesta, send classies to intermis
sion @ daily or leave them in the box in our office. A few ground
rules: 1) get them in by midnight on the Sunday before the
Thursday you want them to run; 2) we don't censor unless you
mention us or unless there isn't enough space â€” and that's not
called censorship, that's called editing; 3) no last names, ex
cept Bill Shen's because he's a public figure.
