Editor's note: This is the first
installment in a two-part series fo
cusing on four student political
leaders at Stanford.
According to Rudy Delson,
president of Stanford's Progres
sive Student Network, the atti
tude toward politics at Stanford is
like the 19th century attitude to
ward sex — everybody talks about
it, but nobody wants to initiate it.
In order to rouse Stanford stu
dents from their political apathy,
Delson founded the Progressive
Student Network at the beginning
of fall quarter. Since then, the net
work has run a campus-wide in
formation campaign in support of
Ralph Nader and the Green Party,
culminating in Nader's Oct. 16
visit to Stanford, jointly sponsored
by the ASSU President's Office
and Speakers Bureau.
Delson said Nader became a
presidential candidate for the
Green Party in order to organize
people interested in progressive
politics both now and beyond the
Tuesday election, a goal Delson
shares for the Stanford campus.
Delson used to be a Democrat.
After working on Clinton's 1992
presidential campaign, he saw the
Democrats working against a lot of
the issues he believed in. He said
he wanted to share that disillu
sionment with others.
"The chances are, if you are

voting for Clinton, that he does
not represent your ideals and the
Green Party does," said DeLson.
"There is a lot of unanalyzed sup
port for Clinton on campus."
"The Green Party genuinely

advocates social and economic jus
tice in a way that no mainstream
party has done in 30 years," he
said. "They have an impeccable
platform on the necessity to pre
serve the land, air, water and

ecosystems of our country and
state in a way that our children
can grow up healthy."
