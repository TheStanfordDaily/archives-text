# In support of third parties
## Green, Libertarian student activists cite writers as inspiration for political views 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
Editor's note: This is the first
installment in a two-part series fo
cusing on four student political
leaders at Stanford.
According to Rudy Delson,
president of Stanford's Progres
sive Student Network, the atti
tude toward politics at Stanford is
like the 19th century attitude to
ward sex — everybody talks about
it, but nobody wants to initiate it.
In order to rouse Stanford stu
dents from their political apathy,
Delson founded the Progressive
Student Network at the beginning
of fall quarter. Since then, the net
work has run a campus-wide in
formation campaign in support of
Ralph Nader and the Green Party,
culminating in Nader's Oct. 16
visit to Stanford, jointly sponsored
by the ASSU President's Office
and Speakers Bureau.
Delson said Nader became a
presidential candidate for the
Green Party in order to organize
people interested in progressive
politics both now and beyond the
Tuesday election, a goal Delson
shares for the Stanford campus.
Delson used to be a Democrat.
After working on Clinton's 1992
presidential campaign, he saw the
Democrats working against a lot of
the issues he believed in. He said
he wanted to share that disillu
sionment with others.
"The chances are, if you are

voting for Clinton, that he does
not represent your ideals and the
Green Party does," said DeLson.
"There is a lot of unanalyzed sup
port for Clinton on campus."
"The Green Party genuinely

advocates social and economic jus
tice in a way that no mainstream
party has done in 30 years," he
said. "They have an impeccable
platform on the necessity to pre
serve the land, air, water and

ecosystems of our country and
state in a way that our children
can grow up healthy."

Senior Rudy Delson and sophomore Brian Singerman, presidents of the Progressive Student Net
work and the Stanford Libertarians, respectively, are continuing to pursue their long-held interests in
politics.
studying math and linguistics, grew
up in Mountain View and San Jose.
Although his grandmother told him
over lunch one day that he would
become a politician, he has no ambi
tion to hold elected office.
"The most important figures in
American history have been non
elected," he said.
He traces the dawning of his own
political consciousness back to the
Gulf War, when he became a paci
fist and began to read Noam Chom
sky texts given to him by his father.
His mother, who was born in
Germany in 1942, was opposed to
all violence as a result of the first
years of her own life being marred
by war and banned military toys
from the household.
One of Delson's proudest politi
cal achievements to date is convinc
ing both of his parents, whom he de
scribes alternately as "staunch De
mocrats" and "old lefties," to vote
for Nader.
Brian Singerman, president of
the Stanford Libertarians, is less
reticent than Delson about his own
political ambitions. "One of these
days, I'll be governor of California,"
he said.
Like Delson, his neighbor at
Synergy, Singerman is far from po
litically apathetic. He said he rec
ognized the need for a libertarian
group on campus that focused on
civil liberties rather than right
wing economics and set up the
Stanford Libertarians this quar
ter.
"At the first meeting of the Stan
ford Libertarians, we met our pres
idential candidate," he said, refer
ring to Harry Browne's visit to cam
pus last week to participate in a de
bate.
"My thing is promoting third
party politics," he said. "I think a lot
of people are going to vote third

party at Stanford."
Singerman believes Ralph
Nader's Green Party, Harry
Browne's Libertarian Party, John
Hagelin's Natural Law Party and
Howard Phillips' U.S. Taxpayers
Party will win a combined 7 percent
to 8 percent of the vote on Tuesday.
Like Delson, Singerman also
supported the Clinton campaign
during 1992 but became disillu
sioned by the Democrats' policies,
particularly regarding the Defense
of Marriage Act.
While reading Ralph Waldo
Emerson in his lOth-grade Eng
lish class, Singerman became con
vinced that individuals should be
responsible for their own actions
and live their own lives, without
interference from the government.
This includes telling people
what to say, what to do with their
money and whom to sleep with,
Singerman said. The only areas
where government should inter
vene, according to Singerman, are
defending the country, setting up
police forces and fire departments,
building roads and making traffic
laws.
Singerman admits that his liber
tarian views made him a difficult
teen-ager. But his involvement in
politics started at a much younger
age.
"In the third grade, I was graded
'S' in social responsibility," said the
19-year-old sophomore computer
science major from Tarzana, Calif.
On the whole, he said, his par
ents — both "regular Democrats"
— have been supportive of his polit
ical views, particularly regarding
civil liberties.
"My mom's not too into legaliz
ing drugs," he said. "But she agrees
with me that prostitution, gam
bling and smoking marijuana
should be legalized."

Tomorrow: President of the Stan
ford Republican Youth Majority
Danny Bramzon and Stanford De
mocrats Chair David Thomas.
