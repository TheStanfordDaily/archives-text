PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti
(AP) â€” Jean-Bertrand Aristide is
taking his biggest step back into
Haitian politics since he left the
presidency, creating a grass-roots
movement that he says will
"democratize our democracy."
Aristide, whose Lavalas coali
tion of political parties, labor
unions and grass-roots groups
swept him into power in 1990, said
Lavalas needs to be reinvigorated
to bring democracy back to the peo
ple.

He spoke in an interview with
The Associated Press at his subur
ban Port-au-Prince home yester
day.
Aristide plans to unveil the new
movement, to be called the Lavalas
Family, at a community meeting
Sunday in the southern port of
Jacmel. He declined to call it a
political party, preferring instead
the term "dynamic" to emphasize
its connection with Haiti's poor.
Haitians "have to have a good
way, a better way, to channel their

JL
concerns, and those leading the
movement will not make decisions
without those living in the country
side," Aristide said. "For that, the
family will have to have better
organization."
Aristide insisted the move isn't
a challenge to President Rene
Preval, a friend and Lavalas
activist whom Aristide belatedly
endorsed for president last year. By
law, Aristide could not seek a con
secutive term, and Preval succeed
ed him in February.
