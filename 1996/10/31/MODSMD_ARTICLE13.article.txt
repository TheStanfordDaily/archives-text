# GOP fears low turnout
## Early Clinton win may keep Western voters home 
### 
SAN DIEGO (AP) - An early
TV call of the presidential race
could prompt Bernie Tanner to
stay home Tuesday night and skip
voting entirely, a thought that dis
mays Republicans worried about
close Senate and House races
throughout the West.
"If they told me the (presiden
tial) election had been won, I
wouldn't go out after 6 o'clock to
vote," said Tanner, 77, of San
Diego, who did not disclose her
political preferences in an inter
view.
"Why should I if my vote
doesn't count?"
It's not only Tanner, of course,
but the fact that there are literally
millions more like her who might
skip their Election Day right if it's
the end of the day and the televi
sion networks have made it abun

dantly clear that the presidential
race has been settled without
them.
Republicans and Democrats
alike remember all too well the
example of 1980, when then-presi
dent Jimmy Carter conceded
defeat to Ronald Reagan with the
polls still open out West. It's an
article of faith among Democrats
that Carter's comments caused
turnout to plunge and cost the
party seats in Congress.
This year, polls close nationwide
at varying times — from 6 p.m.
EST to midnight EST. In Califor
nia, the polls close at 11 p.m. EST.
Network policy is not to declare
a presidential winner in a state
until a majority of polls in that
state have closed. But this year, if
the race is as one-sided as opinion
polls indicate, Clinton could clinch

the magic 270 electoral votes need
ed to win two hours before voting is
done out West.
Lane Venardos, a CBS News
vice president, discounts such wor
ries. "We have uncovered not one
whit of actual evidence that
l>ecause some TV network called a
presidential race before the polls
closed anybody ever decided not to
go to the poll or to leave the poll
before casting his vote," he said.
But Stanley Moore, a political
science professor at Pepperdine
University, said there could be
repercussions in close candidate
and issues battles.
"We are likely to see some very
close races in California. In some
districts, if Republicans get dis
couraged and don't show up at the
polls, it could hurt them," Moore
