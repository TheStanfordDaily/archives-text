Affirmative action is not
perfect, but Proposition
209 is the wrong answer

£ "\T EITHER THE STATE
or any of its political
A. subdivisions or agents
shall use race, sex, color, ethnicity
or national origin as a criterion for
either discriminating against, or
granting preferential treatment
to, any individual or group in the

operation of the State's
system for public employ
ment, public education or
public contracting."
As the main section of
Proposition 209, which will
appear on the California
state ballot on Election

Day, this sounds fine. Hey,
it's called the Civil Rights Initia
tive; it couldn't be all bad. But,
that's the point. The conservative
authors of this proposition are
very good writers. Their subtlety
and cleverness, though, mask the
real harms that will result if Cali
fornia voters pass this proposi
tion.
Granted, affirmative action is
not perfect in that it is somewhat
arbitrary. Certain minority groups
likes Asian Americans and Jewish
people who have suffered past dis
crimination do not benefit from
and may even be harmed by affir
mative action policies. Also, poor
whites whose chances for success
are surely more limited than
wealthy minorities are ignored by
affirmative action. Some also
argue that those minorities who
qualify for college admission or
jobs without affirmative action
are branded as undeserving of the
position, despite their qualifica
tions.
That said, Proposition 209
would completely eliminate affir
mative action, which we can not
afford. Affirmative action is
imperfect, but its benefits far out
weigh its costs.
Passage of this proposition

O
would eliminate minority scholar
ships and diversity programs at
state schools. Such scholarships
are necessary, making it much
easier for minorities and women
to pursue higher education. And,
despite some people's claims,
unqualified minorities and
women are not being admitted to
state schools. Would UC-Berkeley
admit a student with low SAT
scores and a low grade-point aver
age just because of the color of his
skin? No. Affirmative action in

state schools merely gives
qualified minorities and
women that extra boost
they may not otherwise be
granted by the typically
white admissions officers.
Those minorities and
women outside the ivory
tower would also be greatly

affected should this proposition
pass. California law currently
allows affirmative action pro
grams to prepare minorities and
women for success in education,
business and other areas. Such
programs include tutoring, men
toring, outreach, recruitment and
counseling. So essentially, minori
ties and women will not be given a
boost in admission to colleges or
jobs, but they will also not be
given the support to improve
themselves in preparation for
these college and job spots. This is
clearly a lose-lose situation.
But affirmative action doesn't
just benefit minorities and women.
The diversity it helps to create ben
efits all of us. Students, imagine a
Cultures, Ideas and Values-section
discussion or informal dorm meet
ing between all middle-class white
males who all have generally the
same beliefs. Faculty, imagine try
ing to spark interest and debate
among such a group. You get the
picture . . . boring.
So when will we not need affir
mative action? When all groups
have an equal chance of success.
Will we ever reach this ideal? Who
knows, but we're certainly not
there yet.
