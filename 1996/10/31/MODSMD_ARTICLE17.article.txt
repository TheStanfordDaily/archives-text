Stanford must open its eyes to reality of homelessness

IT MADE THE front page of The New
York Times. The Russian govern
ment was shipping homeless people
out of Moscow. The reasons were simple:
Moscow does not portray itself as a capi
tal (with all those homeless people run
ning around). As horrific (yet practical)
as this may sound, this reality is not far
from our campus or from our lives.
Monday's letter opened my eyes to it.
By rejecting the presence of homeless peo
ple on campus, the school administration
is following an economically sound deci
sion. We do not want our potential stu
dents to see the homeless when they
arrive to visit the campus. Neither do we
want our corporate sponsors to feel

uneasy by thinking the Economics
Department has something to do with
helping the homeless on campus. It is sort
of like visiting Cuba. You are only allowed
to see the good part of town, so when you
leave Cuba (if you do not read the news)
you will remember it as a great place.
Nobody will remember that people on the
other side are surviving on chicken broth.
At Stanford, we want people to
remember us as a high-quality place of
learning. For if we have homeless people
running around campus, our reputation
as an elite shcool might decrease and so
will our salaries and high regard of our
selves. I believe there is nothing wrong in
securing our self-interest. We are, indeed,

paying a lot of money and spending a lot
of time studying.
What are we to gain then from feeding
the homeless on campus? It occurred to
me that maybe, just maybe, early on a
Monday morning before Econ 111, some
economics student will pass by, and the
presence of the homeless man will
remind him that poverty and inequality
are the most important issues in the field.
Or maybe a sociology major will see in
the face of a homeless woman a reason to
change her research plans on the theories
of corporate behavior and will reach out
for solutions to homelessness.
But above all, maybe one day on our
campus, someone will see in the dark side

of our society a reflection of ourselves
and will strive to change our universal
attitude toward our own fellow human
beings.
If we lose this potential opportunity,
we probably won't notice. In the grand
scale of things, we are better off without
the homeless as long as we are not them.
The worst that can happen is that we, in
the Americas, make shipping the home
less a common practice and sedate our
consciousness with our own economically
sound decisions. But again, we won't
notice.
