# Isolating students from world's harsh realities deters higher learning
## 
### 
"Stanford University officials are
debating a proposal to build a wire fence
along Highway 101 in order to isolate
Palo Alto and the University from its East
Palo Alto neighbors." Does this headline
strike you as outrageous? Well, it should
not, as the recent comments from Dean of
Students Marc Wais demonstrate.

In an article in last Thursday's Daily
which reported the activities of a stu
dent group dedicated to providing food
for the homeless, the University official
states that he is "not happy with the
idea of mixing the student population
with the homeless population." He later
adds that "there is a significant criminal
element among the transient population
We can't just invite people like this onto
campus. This is a closed campus." In
other words, we don't want poor people
(let alone homeless) hanging around
Stanford. Let them stay where they are,
after all this is Stanford!

Is there any better proof of the openly
segregational ideology underlying many
of the University so-called "educational
policies"? It seems that the "diverse"
educational experience that Stanford
attempts to provide is that of diversity
within the well-off, the educated elites
west of Highway 101. I am not arguing
about the specifics of the matter report
ed in the article (whether to provide the
food for the homeless on or off campus),
but rather pointing to the overtly elitist
ideology beneath Wais' comments.
"Students are sometimes a little naive
and can be taken advantage of by the

homeless, added Wais. Another good
reason to keep the Stanford campus
poor-free: Students are stupid. It seems
that the purpose of higher education,
according to Wais, is not to provide stu
dents with a comprehensive life experi
ence, but to isolate them from the "dan
gerous world out there" and prepare
them to enter the country's exclusive
elite, which of course do not talk about
poor or homeless people in cocktail par
ties. If so, the wire fence does not seem
to be a bad idea at all.
