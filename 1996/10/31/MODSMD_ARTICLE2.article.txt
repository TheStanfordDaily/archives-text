# Prop. 215 serves as focus in psych course
## 
### Anne Ruimy Contributing writer 
"The American Drinking and Drug Culture,"
a psychology course offered at Stanford this fall,
doesn't just educate students about current is
sues concerning alcohol and drugs.
It also serves as a stage for the state-wide
drama over Proposition 215, also known as the
Medical Marijuana Initiative, which will be pre
sented to Californian voters on the Nov. 5 ballot.
The cast of people involved with the class can
indeed be viewed as a representative sample of

the personalities revolving around the debate on
legalizing, for medical uses, a drug now primari
ly used for recreational, purposes.
There is Jane Marcus as "the concerned citi
zen," Officer Ron Brooks as the "anti-drug cru
sader," Steve Heiligas "the doctor," Elise Lenox
as "the drug abuse counselor" and approximate
ly 50 students representing "the voters."
If passed, Prop. 215 would allow patients and
physicians a legal defense in court if the physi
cian recommended the use of marijuana to the
patient. In practical terms, many people believe
this would effectively legalize marijuana.

Lenox, director of the Alco
hol and Other Drug Abuse
Prevention Program at Cow
ell Student Health Center, has
been teaching the class since
1988.
The class has tackled sub
jects in the past including nee
dle-exchange programs, binge

babies born to crack-addicted mothers. This fall,

the class is discussing "medical"
marijuana.
Lenox declined to state her posi
tion on the issue, but she did say
that the initiative is clearly about
medical use only and not about
recreational use.
"A number of people... suggest
that this issue should be decided be
tween a patient and his physician,"
Lenox said. "I am looking at this as
a compassionate law. There are
loopholes; they concern a lot of vot
ers. But there is a downside of pre
scription drugs. Morphine, for ex
ample, has physical dependency."
Marcus, a computing infosys
tems analyst at Information Tech
nology Systems and Services, was
the speaker who inaugurated the
series on medical marijuana for the
class.
She has a longtime interest in

drug policy. A participant in a con
tinuing studies program course on
U.S drug policy, she helped gather
signatures to put the medical mari
juana initiative on the ballot.
Marcus came to address the stu
dents as a "concerned citizen."
"One point I made in the lecture
is that, prior to 1937, marijuana
was not illegal. In fact, it was a med
icine," she said. "Since then, we
have lost that whole body of evi
dence. ... What this referendum
says now is: 'In the cases of people
who are ill, let's take it out of the
hands of the police and judges.' "
Brooks, another class speaker
and a narcotics officer for 17 years,
was president of the California Nar
cotics Officers Association in 1995.
He is now involved in training offi
cers and educating the public about
the dangers of drugs.
The most important thing about
the initiative, he said, "is that it is
powdered as a medical marijuana
initiative, when it is truly a legaliza
tion of marijuana initiative. It is

written so loosely. It will for the
first time ever allow [physicians] to
recommend marijuana — not pre
scribe it — without quality control,
without written prescription. It
would be regulating medicine by
popular voters."
He cited a long list of the dangers
of smoking marijuana, associating
it in particular with road accidents
and domestic violence, and stressed
the lack of scientific evidence that it
is a safe and useful drug.
"But, if the American Medical
Association said, 'Well, we need
crude marijuana in our bag of tools
because we think it is effective,'
then I'd say, 'Let's do it,' " Brooks
said.
The American Medical Associa
tion, one of the biggest associations
of physicians in the country, has
joined Citizens for a Drug-Free
America in standing opposed to
Prop. 215.
Heilig, the director of Health Ed
ucation at the San Francisco Med
ical Society, one of the few medical

associations to have endorsed Prop.
215, is a practicing doctor at the
Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic. He
brought a medical perspective to
the students.
"I work every Monday at-a hos
pice. I see dying people. Some of
them smoke pot; some of them
swear by it,"he said. "I don't think
there is much wrong with it."
Heilig agrees with Brooks that
the initiative is written loosely, but
he said doctors will self-regulate
their recommendation of medical
marijuana. He said doctors also will
probably release directives on how
to prescribe and distribute marijua
na to patients, should the proposi
tion pass.
"Any doctor is going to be care
ful. They risk their license," he said.
At the end of last week's class,
Heilig asked the students how they
intend to vote. About half said they
were going to vote yes on Prop. 215,
while a few said they were going to
vote no. The others were undecided
or didn't raise their hands.
