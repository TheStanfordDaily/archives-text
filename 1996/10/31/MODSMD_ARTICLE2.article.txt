# Prop. 215 serves as focus in psych course

"The American Drinking and Drug Culture,"
a psychology course offered at Stanford this fall,
doesn't just educate students about current is
sues concerning alcohol and drugs.
It also serves as a stage for the state-wide
drama over Proposition 215, also known as the
Medical Marijuana Initiative, which will be pre
sented to Californian voters on the Nov. 5 ballot.
The cast of people involved with the class can
indeed be viewed as a representative sample of

the personalities revolving around the debate on
legalizing, for medical uses, a drug now primari
ly used for recreational, purposes.
There is Jane Marcus as "the concerned citi
zen," Officer Ron Brooks as the "anti-drug cru
sader," Steve Heiligas "the doctor," Elise Lenox
as "the drug abuse counselor" and approximate
ly 50 students representing "the voters."
If passed, Prop. 215 would allow patients and
physicians a legal defense in court if the physi
cian recommended the use of marijuana to the
patient. In practical terms, many people believe
this would effectively legalize marijuana.

Lenox, director of the Alco
hol and Other Drug Abuse
Prevention Program at Cow
ell Student Health Center, has
been teaching the class since
1988.
