						little less vomit, please

STANFORD COULD USE a little
bit of reverence. I'm talking to
the people who feel the pressing
need to start rustling their papers and
slamming their books closed about 10
seconds before class ends, even if the
professor isn't finished speaking. I'm
speaking to the people who sit in the
very front row of the classroom and
accompany the titillating lecture with a
chorus of snores. You know who you
are, all of you I'm-sure-the-cleaning
staff-won't-mind-if-I-leave-a-rotting-
tray-full-of-food-outside-of-my-door
chanters. And let's not even talk about
the toilet seat smear people. Disrespect
is in every room of this University.
There's a difference between getting
the full value out of your tuition and
treating the faculty and staff like lack
eys. No one owes it to you to be a per
sonal servant.
Very few people work at the Univer
sity for our sakes. Nine times out of 10
(probably even more), staff are here
because they have to support them
selves and their families. A good deal of
the faculty just enjoy their subject mat
ter, and teaching is a good excuse to be
paid for what they like. The potential
comfort of Stanford students, especially
awkward undergraduate students, is at
the very bottom of the "why I work
here" list.
Don't get me wrong. Sweeping the
floor is fine. Mopping — fine. Wiping off
tables and vacuuming — fine. Listening

to our absurd and uninformed ques
tions about reading we didn't do — fine.
These things come with the job. But not
Monday morning vomit duty. Vomit is
where one should draw the line.
When I applied to college, one of the
places that I applied was Bryn Mawr, a
tiny women's college in Philadelphia. I
was lucky enough to get in, and when I
told my grandmother, she just about
jumped out of her skin. For the next
month, she made it her personal mis
sion to convince me to go to Bryn Mawr.
I obviously didn't end up going, but I
later found out that the reason she was
so excited for me to go to Bryn Mawr
was that before she'd become a nurse
she'd been one of the cleaning staff
there. It had meant a great deal to her
that I'd had the option of becoming a
member of a community of people
whose messes she had had to clean up.
My going would have made her having
to take that job worthwhile.
I don't mean to imply that my grand
mother is somehow less for having had
to clean up after others. I am trying to
illustrate that none of us here are so
many steps away from having to work
for a living that we can justify treating
others as if they are not our equals.
How many of you have ever done physi
cal labor? Spoken in front of a group of
strangers?
We've been coddled and cooed at so
much that we have forgotten that oth
ers inhabit the earth with us. So much

so that when they clean up after our
outrageous and unnecessary messes, we
don't even say thank you. Respect is
earned. If it isn't earned by yourself,
then your ancestors have done it for
you. Stanford isn't the end of a journey
to becoming a mover and a shaker. It
isn't even necessarily the beginning.
Most of us aren't much more than three
generations from the ghetto. Keep that
in mind. There's no way of knowing
what occupation you or a relative will
have next.
In my mother's household, it's not
OK to leave anything that assails the
senses in a place where it can assail
them even more. It's not an option to
fall asleep while my mother is telling
me about the world. I'd be severely
taken to task if I decided to smear any
thing, even something pleasant, on the
toilet seat. Even if you don't consider
Stanford your home and don't think of
its inhabitants and upkeepers as family,
we all need to show some respect for the
people who work here. Because they are
individuals who do not need to be
demeaned.

Nkomo wants everyone to know that
Proposition 209, among other atrocities,
has it in its power to shut down rape cri
sis centers.
