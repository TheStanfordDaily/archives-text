# Brian Singer: First impressions
## Only the names have changed in Russia's political cycle

THE FIRING OF Security Chief
Alexander Lebed two weeks ago
only reinforced in my mind the
similarities between the post-Communist
era and the post-Leninist era.
Lenin, on his deathbed, wrote a final
letter to Congress, in which he blasted top
Communist officials for their inadequa
cies and deficiencies, praising only a few.
Now it is Boris Yeltsin, using not the
power of Congress but the power of the
media to hire, fire, insult or compliment
whomever he feels is competent or incom
petent within his own administration.
No doubt even Yeltsin has written
some final words as he prepares for his
operation which will reportedly occur at
the end of this month. Finding a copy of
Lenin's testament, I realized the similari
ties between his situation and Yeltsin's.
Only the names were changed to bring
history up to the present.
Oct. 16, 1996
Letter to the Russian People:
I would urge strongly that at this time
in Russia a number of changes be made in

our political structure.
I want to tell you of the considerations
to which I attach the most importance . . .
I have in mind stability as a guarantee
against a split in the immediate future,
and I intend to deal here with a few ideas
concerning personal qualities. I think that
from this standpoint the prime factors in
the question of stability are such mem
bers of my cabinet as Lebed and Chubais.
I think relations between them make up
the greater part of the danger of a split,
which could be avoided . ..
Comrade Lebed, having become secre
tary of the Security Council, has unlimit
ed authority concentrated in his hands,
and I am not sure whether he will always
be capable of using that authority with
sufficient caution. Comrade Kulikov, on
the other hand, as his struggle ... has
proved, is distinguished not only by out
standing ability. He is personally perhaps
the most capable man in the present Cab
inet, but he has displayed excessive self
assurance and shown excessive preoccu
pation with the purely administrative
sided of the work.

The qualities of the two outstanding
leaders of the present Cabinet can inad
vertently lead to a split, and if our country
does not take steps to avert this, split may
come unexpectedly .. .
Speaking of the other Cabinet mem
bers, I'll say a few words about Chubais
and Chernomyrdin. They are, in my opin
ion, the most outstanding figures, and the
following must be borne in mind about
them: Chubais is not only a most valuable
and major theorist of economics; he is also
rightly considered the favorite ... but his
theoretical views can be classified as fully
capitalist only with great reserve . ..
As for Chernomyrdin, he is unques
tionably a man of outstanding will and
outstanding ability, but shows too much
zeal for administrating and the adminis
trative side of the work to be relied upon
in a serious political matter. Lebed is too
rude and this defect, although quite tol
erable in our midst and in dealings
among us, becomes intolerable in a secu
rity chief. That is why I suggest that the
comrades think about a way of removing
Lebed from that post and appointing

another man instead who in all other
respects differs from Comrade Lebed in
having only one advantage, namely, that
of being more tolerant, more loyal, more
polite and more considerate to the com
rades, less capricious, etc. This circum
stance may appear to be a negligible
detail. But I think that from the stand
point of the safeguards against a split and
from the standpoint of what I wrote
about, the relationship between Lebed
and Kulikov, it is not a detail, or it is a
detail which can assume decisive impor
tance.
Yeltsin
Stalin, although only the general secre
tary of the Communist Party at the time,
was able to maneuver himself to the top.
Until Gorbachev, the general secretary,
led Russia, not the president.
In the United States, the vice president
is the most powerful up-and-coming posi
tion. In Russia, just as in the post-Lenin
ist period, there is no one — or everyone
— who is in the best position to succeed
Yeltsin. Like Stalin. Russia's politicians

are trying to create that second rung of
the ladder. The Interior Ministry, headed
by Gen. Kulikov, can be credited for help
ing evict Lebed from the Yeltsin adminis
tration. Similarly, the bureaucratic but
dependable Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
technical second in command, is also
jostling his position for position.
Lebed, who allegedly asked to resign
from his security post shortly before being
fired, appears to be the next Boris Yeltsin.
With the people behind him, he now has a
maximum of four years to continue his
forceful albeit monotonous critique of the
government and its foreign policy.
Russian politics is a series of compar
isons and circles. Being in Russia has
allowed me to see that the political circles
are a given. Only the names have been
changed.
