## Todd's picks Marks now in for NFL midseason 
### 
As many of you might know,
I wrote a midseason report
card for the Stanford foot
ball team in last Saturday's Cardi
nal Today. Actually, judging by the
game's attendance, most of you
probably missed it and will have to
take my word for it.

Seeing as I don't want to write
about the Yankees, the upcoming
NBA season, Tiger Woods or the
Cardinal football team this week, I
am once again forced to resort to
the midseason report. This week
yours truly will break down the
first half of the NFL season, only
this time I'll leave out the grades.
Biggest Surprises: When
most people think of the biggest
surprises in a league, they general
ly focus on the teams who have
played much better than anyone
expected. Yes, it is true that the
Carolina Panthers, Denver Bron
cos and Washington Redskins have
far exceeded the expectations of
most fans, but I think the biggest
surprises thus far are the teams
that have played well below presea
son expectations.
To start with the powerhouses,
Dallas and San Francisco are
among the top underachievers this
year. I know that the Niners have
been saddled with injuries and that
various Cowboys have been hin
dered by those things we call laws,
but I am still unimpressed with
both teams at this point in the sea
son. While the Niners, whose
record stands at 6-2, could easily be
7-1 right now, the teams they have
beaten — New Orleans, St. Louis
(twice), Atlanta, Cincinnati and
Houston — are not exactly the

cream of the NFL crop.
The Cowboys, who are now 5-3,
seem to be regrouping, and after
routing the Dolphins this week,
Dallas appears to be heading in the
right direction again. Both teams
will continue to improve and will
make it to the playoffs, but neither
appears to have the mark of a
champion yet.
Other underachievers this year
that show no signs of making a
late-season turnaround are the
Jets, Bengals, Bears and Falcons.
While the Bears have the injury
excuse, the others are simply left
with the "we just suck" excuse.
Most Valuable Player: With
out a doubt, the NFL MVP thus far
is Green Bay Packer Brett Favre.
Favre, who won the award last
year, has put his Packers atop the
NFL Central and in the driver's
seat for home field advantage in
the playoffs. Favre has already
thrown more touchdown passes
than most teams and has led the
Pack to big wins over the Niners
and the Bears.
Favre is going to have a long sec
ond half of the season, though, as
his wide-receiving corps is quickly
dwindling. Both Robert Brooks
and Antonio Freeman are out with
injuries, and judging by the Pack's
unimpressive 13-7 win over Tampa
Bay Sunday, Green Bay could slip a
bit in the second half of the season.
Runners-up for the MVP award,
in my mind, are Denver's John
Elway, who has led the Broncos
back to the top of the AFC West
and Terry Allen, who has given the
Redskins a running game and rea
son to believe the Skins can make it
back to the playoffs.
Rookie of the Year: This easi
ly goes to Eddie George of the Oil
ers. George has run the ball effec
tively since day one for Houston
and will run away with the rookie
of the year award. However, the
most interesting development
among rookies is the play of
Lawrence Phillips. Phillips fum
bled on his first NFL carry and has
been struggling ever since. The


Todd
Bernstein
fourth pick in last year's draft,
Phillips still hasn't proven that he
can rack up yardage, hold on to the
football or catch balls coming out of
the backfleld. And while he alone
cannot be blamed for the Rams'
horrific 2-6 start, he is definitely
not the star St. Louis anticipated.
Predictions: While the above
list is by no means exhaustive, I
only have space for one more cate
gory. And since I have a big ego and
like making predictions so I can say
"told you so" later in the year when
you've long forgotten my picks, I
will spend the rest of my column
telling you how the playoffs will
take shape.
The NFC playoffs will feature

the Packers, Niners and Cowboys
as division champions. I don't
think Washington can hold on to
the division lead but I think the
Skins will take a playoff spot along
with the Philadelphia Eagles and
the Carolina Panthers. The Skins
will beat the Panthers and lose to
the Packers, while the Niners will
knock off Dallas, who beat the
Eagles, and then beat the Packers
to head to the Super Bowl.
In the AFC, Denver, New Eng
land and Pittsburgh will take their
respective divisions and Indianapo
lis, Kansas City and Houston will
edge up to take the wild cards. Indy
beats New England then loses to
Denver. Kansas City beats Pitts
burgh after upending Houston.
Then Denver beats Kansas City
and goes to the Super Bowl, where
they lose to the Niners 27-10.
Yeah, right.
