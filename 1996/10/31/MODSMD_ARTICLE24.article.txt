# Hungarian native is right at home

At first glance, he appears to be the typical Califor
nian collegiate water polo player. Blond hair, a
healthy tan and an easygoing demeanor complete the
illusion.
But Daniel Lehoczky is anything but typical. As a
native of Budapest, Hungary, Lehoczky has traveled
a unique road to reach Stanford and become a colle
giate water polo player.
Lehoczky was first introduced to water polo at age
7. "My father played polo, and he took me down to
the pool when I was young," Lehoczky said. "It's a
very popular sport in Hungary and has a big tradi
tion."
Indeed it has, as Hungary's dominance in
Olympic water polo dates back nearly a century,
and club leagues proliferate there today. It is in the
pool as a child that Lehoczky gained a love for the
water and first experienced the thrill of competitive
sports.
"I've always liked ball games and team competi
tion," Lehoczky said. "And with water polo, the game
isn't over until time runs out."
It is that enthusiasm toward the sport that caused
Daniel's mother Scilla to take note of the opportuni
ties that he might have in the United States while she
was working as a guest professor for Stanford's Law
School.
Impressed by the wealth of talented water polo
players and coaches, she encouraged him to travel
here to spend a summer practicing the sport. With
that in mind, Lehoczky — then a member of the Hun
garian National Youth Team — made the decision to
travel to the United States after his junior year of
high school to practice at Stanford.
Lehoczky flourished in California — a state that in
recent history has become home to the top collegiate
water polo programs in the world — and as the sum
mer came to a close, he knew that he wanted to con
tinue playing in the United States. He entered a stu
dent exchange program, canceled his return trip
home and enrolled as a senior at Harbor High School
in Santa Cruz, where he first crossed paths with the
Swansons, his American host family.
"When I first arrived here, I spoke very little
English," Lehoczky said. "They helped to me to get
oriented and to make me feel comfortable, and their
son, who was also a senior, played with me on the
water polo team."
The Swansons' hospitality and encouragement
provided an environment which allowed Lehoczky to
excel, and he did. Garnering such honors as first-team
Ail-American, Central Coast Section Player of the
Year and Northern California Player of the Year, he
certainly had a successful season.
In fact, it was Neal and Kathy Swanson that
encouraged Lehoczky to apply to Stanford. Now,
nearly six years later, the Swansons remain close to
his heart.
"They come to nearly all of my games — they're
my No. 1 fans," Lehoczky said. "They have become a
