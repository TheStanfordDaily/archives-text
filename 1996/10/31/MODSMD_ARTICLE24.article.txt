# Hungarian native is right at home
## 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
At first glance, he appears to be the typical Califor
nian collegiate water polo player. Blond hair, a
healthy tan and an easygoing demeanor complete the
illusion.
But Daniel Lehoczky is anything but typical. As a
native of Budapest, Hungary, Lehoczky has traveled
a unique road to reach Stanford and become a colle
giate water polo player.
Lehoczky was first introduced to water polo at age
7. "My father played polo, and he took me down to
the pool when I was young," Lehoczky said. "It's a
very popular sport in Hungary and has a big tradi
tion."
Indeed it has, as Hungary's dominance in
Olympic water polo dates back nearly a century,
and club leagues proliferate there today. It is in the
pool as a child that Lehoczky gained a love for the
water and first experienced the thrill of competitive
sports.
"I've always liked ball games and team competi
tion," Lehoczky said. "And with water polo, the game
isn't over until time runs out."
It is that enthusiasm toward the sport that caused
Daniel's mother Scilla to take note of the opportuni
ties that he might have in the United States while she
was working as a guest professor for Stanford's Law
School.
Impressed by the wealth of talented water polo
players and coaches, she encouraged him to travel
here to spend a summer practicing the sport. With
that in mind, Lehoczky — then a member of the Hun
garian National Youth Team — made the decision to
travel to the United States after his junior year of
high school to practice at Stanford.
Lehoczky flourished in California — a state that in
recent history has become home to the top collegiate
water polo programs in the world — and as the sum
mer came to a close, he knew that he wanted to con
tinue playing in the United States. He entered a stu
dent exchange program, canceled his return trip
home and enrolled as a senior at Harbor High School
in Santa Cruz, where he first crossed paths with the
Swansons, his American host family.
"When I first arrived here, I spoke very little
English," Lehoczky said. "They helped to me to get
oriented and to make me feel comfortable, and their
son, who was also a senior, played with me on the
water polo team."
The Swansons' hospitality and encouragement
provided an environment which allowed Lehoczky to
excel, and he did. Garnering such honors as first-team
Ail-American, Central Coast Section Player of the
Year and Northern California Player of the Year, he
certainly had a successful season.
In fact, it was Neal and Kathy Swanson that
encouraged Lehoczky to apply to Stanford. Now,
nearly six years later, the Swansons remain close to
his heart.
"They come to nearly all of my games — they're
my No. 1 fans," Lehoczky said. "They have become a

second family to me."
Now starting for the Cardinal as
a senior, Lehoczky has continued
to excel in the pool. In Stanford's
last meeting with No. 4 California,
Lehoczky scored an astonishing
four goals to spark the Cardinal to
victory. He is currently the second
leading scorer on the team with 25
goals.
Already a playing member of
two NCAA championship teams,
Lehoczky remains driven to suc
ceed on both a personal and a team
level in his last season at Stanford.
"It took us (the Stanford water
polo players) awhile to get used to
one another, to become a true
team," Lehoczky said. "Now we're
the third-ranked team in the coun
try, and the reality is that we are
just a few wins away from the top.
"My dream would be to make it
to the NCAA finals," Lehoczky
said. "Winning a third champi
onship would be very special to me,

and win or lose I would love to end
my career playing for the title."
With the water polo season con
cluding in just six more weeks,
Lehoczky is planning for the
future. As time-consuming as
water polo can be, he has managed
to thrive in the academic arena and
studied abroad at Stanford in
Berlin last year. Lehoczky will
graduate with a bachelor's degree
in economics this spring.
"Right now I'm looking for a job
here in the U.S., and I hope to do
financial consulting," Lehoczky
said.
While Lehoczky looks forward
to a career in America, family
remains a priority. "I definitely
want to go home at some point," he
said. "My whole family is there: my
parents, my brother and my twin
sister. I have friends that I would
love to see again."
Whether Lehoczky returns to
Hungary or remains in the United
States, one can rest assured that
he'll do his best. And after spend
ing nearly seven years in Califor
nia, he just might be mistaken for
one of the natives.
