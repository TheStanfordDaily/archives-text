# Spikers exert dominance
## Stanford swiftly polishes off Golden Bears 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The fourth-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team (18-2, 11-1
Pacific 10 Conference) made sure that
there was no drama in its match against
California (5-14, 1-11) last night, win
ning 15-12, 15-12, 15-3.
The Cardinal pounded the Golden
Bears in front of a meager crowd at
Harmon Arena. A contingent of Bran
ner Hall residents, out to support fel
low freshman outside hitter Kerri
Walsh and the rest of the Stanford
squad, provided most of the noise from
the stands.
The match opened with the two
teams trading points, leading to a 3-3 tie.
Bear freshman Brook Coulter and junior
Michelle Wickman allowed Cal to keep
the match close. But Cardinal freshman
Jaimi Gregory and junior Kristin Folkl
helped provide some powerful offense,
helping the team gain a 10-6 advantage.
Senior Eileen Murfee and junior Bar
bara Ifejika added some excellent
defense, making it difficult for Cal
attackers to find places to put the ball.
With Stanford enjoying a 11-7 advan
tage, Murfee then took over, recording
three kills to give the Cardinal a 13-9
advantage and finally guiding Stanford
to 15-12 game-one win.
In the second game, Coulter gave Cal
a quick 4-0 lead, including two service
aces and some strong blocking from
Wickman and freshman Kellie Alva.
However, Stanford fought back, as
Folkl and Ifejika helped the Card even
the score at 5-5. Gregoiy then served for
three consecutive points, giving Stan
ford an 8-5 lead. Freshman setter Jen
nifer Kriste would not let the Bears go
down easily though, running Cal s
offense and adding some hitting of her
own, closing the gap to 8-6 in favor of
the Card.
Stanford proved its superior power

though, increasing the margin to 12-8
before closing out the second game 15-
12.
Stanford continued its hot hitting in
game three, jumping out to an early 3-1
lead and providing some spirited
defense, particularly from Walsh, who
made two impressive digs. Walsh also
carried the bulk of the offense, helping
the Card attack continue to roll, and giv
ing Stanford a 6-2 advantage.
Junior Lisa Sharpley's precise set
ting gave the Stanford hitters great
opportunities to make plays, and indeed
they did. Murfee and Folkl allowed the
Card to extend its lead to 11-3 with pow
erful kills and some fme serving.
"I give a lot of credit to Cal," Folkl
said on KZSU. "They are a great team,
but we were really fired up. We felt like
we had something to prove."
Freshman Sarah Clark came off the
bench to demonstrate some explosive
ability of her own, giving Stanford a 13-
3 advantage. Senior Sarah Neal then
served for the match, finishing off Cal
15-3.
The Golden Bears did not offer near
ly as much resistance as they did in the
first meeting between these two squads,
when Cal extended Stanford to five
games before barely losing to the Cardi
nal.
Much of that resulted from some
excellent hitting from Stanford's usual
sources. Murfee and Ifejika continued to
give the Card consistent play in the mid
dle, racking up six kills each.
Walsh led the team with 12 kills
while Folkl recorded 10 of her own and
hit .311. The strong performances from
Walsh and Folkl seem especially reas
suring for Stanford since both players
struggled in Sunday's loss to Washing
ton State.
"We worked on speeding up our sets
to get things going more quickly," Folkl
said. "We had a really good pract ice yes
terday, and we felt really prepared."
