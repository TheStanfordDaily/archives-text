# Spartans fall prey to soccer's streak
## 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Despite wet conditions from
periodic rain showers, the Stan
ford men's soccer squad contin
ued its excellent play as it
blanked the San Jose State Spar
tans yesterday 2-0 to improve its
record to 8-4-4.
With the victory over the Spar
tans (7-5-3), Stanford has won
three in a row and is now more
than halfway toward its goal of
winning its last five games. The
Cardinal will enjoy a week off
before heading to Moraga to take
on St. Mary's on Nov. 7.
Though the field was wet and
slippery, Stanford managed to
control much of the first half of
play, keeping the ball primarily in
San Jose State's half of the field.
The Cardinal got several good
scoring opportunities throughout
the first half of play but was
unable to convert on any of its
eight shots on goal. San Jose
State was able to manage six
shots but came up empty as well,
leaving the game scoreless at the
half.
Just 6 minutes into the second
half, senior defender and team
captain Brad Davies scored his
first goal of the campaign after a
scramble in front of the net.
"Brad's goal was great," said
senior forward Erik Morrison. "It
lifted the team and really pumped
us up for the rest of the game."
Once again, the Card was able
to score first and set the tone for
the remainder of the game. San
Jose State shot the ball only twice
in the second half as the Cardinal
defense played some of its best
soccer.
Along with scoring his first

career goal, defensive leader
Davies was particularly effective
in shutting down the San Jose
State attack.
"Brad Davies played great,"
said sophomore midfielder Jamie
Clark. "Not only did he score the
first goal of his career which was
a tremendous lift for the team,
but he was brilliant defensively.
He shut down (the Spartans)
every time they attacked. Every
one played well today, but I think
he was definitely the standout."
Though the Card had a few
lapses during a 20-minute span

today, but I think

early in the second half, San Jose
State was unable to capitalize.
Stanford recovered quickly and
began to dominate as the game
progressed.
The first half was played
cleanly overall, yet the second
half got more intense as the rain
continued and the field became
muddier. The weather was cer
tainly not pretty, and at times,
neither was the soccer. Several
missed traps and errant passes
resulted from the slick condi-
tions, but none resulted in goals
against Stanford.
In the final seconds of th[e
game, sophomore midfielder
Adam Siegman connected for his
fourth goal of the season froip
about 35 yards out on a wejl
struck low ball that caught the

feeling like we
should. We have
come a long, long
way since the begin
ning of the season.'

San Jose State keeper Brandon
Main off guard.
"We're definitely on a bit of a
roll," Clark said. "We're finally
beating the teams that are almost
as good or as good as we are. We
lost several games of that sort ear
lier in the season, so we're gaining
a lot of confidence with these vic
tories. It's even possible with wins
in our next two games to make it
into the playoffs."
Finishing an impressive 3-0 on
the recent homestand has given
the team confidence in its ability
to defeat high-quality teams as
well as the sweet feeling of victory
that was absent far too much last
season.
"We went into the locker room
today feeling like we should," Mor
rison said. "We have come a long,
long way since the beginning of
the season, and now we're really
starting to play the type of soccer
we always knew we were capable
of playing."
