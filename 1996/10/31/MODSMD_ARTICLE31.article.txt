# Stanford adjusts Sand Hill plan
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
The Palo Alto Planning Commission met last
night to consider some small changes to the contro
versial Sand Hill Road project proposed by the Uni
versity.
But a group of Palo Alto and Menlo Park residents
took advantage of the public comment period to voice
sharp criticisms of the project as a whole.
The project includes the construction of Stanford
West Senior Housing and Stanford West Apart
ments, an expansion of the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter and an extension and widening of Sand Hill Road.
The adjustments presented by the University last
night were made in response to suggestions from the
city's Architectural Review Board.
Rob Steinberg, an architect working on the project
for Stanford, addressed the changes the University
suggested for the proposed structures.
"We want to balance [the functional require
ments] with the individuality and the personality of
the users," he said.
Prompted by the review board, the University
proposed replacing the three-story senior housing
complex with two buildings, a two-story assisted liv
ing section and a one-story skilled nursing section.
Discussion between the representatives of the
University and the planning commission also dealt
with issues of parking, pool location and requests for
a community retail area.
At the public comment portion of the proceedings,
however, discussion focused not on the specific pro

posals but rat her on the project itself. All the speak
ers criticized the project and urged Palo Alto to take
more time before approving them.
Camas Hubenthal, a representative of the Com
mittee for Green Foothills, an organization seeking
to protect open space on the Peninsula, said the pro
jects will further complicate an "already congested
and ecologically sensitive [Sand Hill Road] corridor."
She urged Palo Alto to halt its progress in approving
the projects until alternative sites have been fully ex
plored.
Judith Maxwell of the Crescent Park Neighbor
hood Association echoed that sentiment and suggest
ed putting "the planning horse before the action
cart."
Menlo Park resident Anita Dippery questioned
"what kind of a neighbor Palo Alto truly is." Al
though the project borders Menlo Park, many resi
dents of that city believe it has been given an insuffi
cient role in the approval process
The project may attract traffic that will affect
Menlo Park streets already filled to capacity, said
Menlo Park resident John Shaffer. He called for a re
gional assessment of the project's consequences.
Claudio Martinez drew the commission's attention
to the value of artifacts found in the area, which may be
"more archeologicallv sensitive than people realize."
After the meeting, Gail Sredanovic, a Menlo Park
resident and member of Stanford's Class of '66, ex
pressed skepticism about the University's position.
"The nifty projections and assumptions in the
Stanford presentations are often unfounded and mis
leading," she said.
