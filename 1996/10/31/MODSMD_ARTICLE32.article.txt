Business Prof. James Howell recently earned
the first ever Robert T. Davis Faculty Award for
his work in reforming business education.
Howell holds the Theodore J. Kreps Professor
ship in economics, has directed the Graduate
School of Business executive education program,
has served as an associate dean of the school and
has taught a variety of MBA, doctoral and execu
tive courses.
Howell once estimated that he has taught more
than 10,000 alumni since his arrival at Stanford in
1958.
Presented by the dean of the Business School,
the award memorializes the accomplishments of
Robert T. Davis, who was a professor of marketing
from 1959 until his death last year.
Davis' family established the award to recog
nize the lifetime achievements of current faculty
members who embody the academic values Davis
embraced, including research and teaching, active
participation in executive education and innova
tion in the classroom.
"I'm very pleased to have received the award be
cause I knew and admired Prof. Davis," Howell
said. "An award like this is valuable for the faculty

because it gives them some idea of the history of
the school."
According to Business Prof. Bob Flanagan,
"James Howell embodies the kind of academic val
ues that Robert Davis espoused, in terms of what a
first-rate business school should be."
Much of Howell's research has been centered
around improving the curriculum of business
schools both nationally and internationally.
"James' most important legacy was his involve
ment in the Ford report," said Business Prof.
James Van Home.
The Ford Foundation Report, which was pub
lished in 1959, was instrumental in changing man
agement education by suggesting increased rigor
and more emphasis on mathematics in business
education.
"Business schools prior to the report were often
practitioners in business without theory or con
ceptual base," said Flanagan.
Howell co-authored the Ford report, which
blueprinted sweeping changes adopted by top busi
ness schools, including Stanford.
"I think that [Howell] is a great choice," Van
Home said. "He's made remarkable contributions
to management education and to the Business
School."
