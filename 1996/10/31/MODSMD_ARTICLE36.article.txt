# THEATER

### Jen Graves 
Hanging from thin strings over the stage of the Magic The
ater is the furniture of our lives: a full dish rack, a yellow um
brella, a trumpet, a trench coat, a bicycle and layers and layers
of quilts ready to be tied together. The lights dim and then
brighten and the players appear out of the dark.
"Pieces of the Quilt" has begun its stitching.
With plays from such incredible artists as Edward Albee,
Lanford Wilson, Sandra Bernhard, Migdalia Cruz, Danny
Hoch, Philip Kan Gotanda, Tony Kushner, Ntozake Shange,
Octavio Solis and Erin Wilson, "Pieces" is a collection of sto
ries loosely gathered around the common center of the Amer
ican AIDS epidemic.
Art pour l'art aside, interaction between arts and social
policy has always been one of the most fruitful venues for cul
tural awakening. As the brainchild of 28-year-old Sean San
lose Blackman, "Pieces" as art form takes on the additional re
sponsibility of AIDS awareness, and the aesthetics suffer
nothing.
"The only reason to do theater is for a new language and
new voices, a way of telling things for now," Blackman said. He
himself said he performs only new plays.
Blackman, originally from San Francisco, thought of the
idea for an AIDS benefit production after the death of his
mother and father to the disease.
"I lost the most precious thing in my life," he said slowly. "I
realized that losing someone to AIDS, I am just one of count
less people. What are we doing with all this rage and grief?
"I wanted to do something communal and possibly thera
peutic. The state of AIDS funding is so ridiculously tied into
red tape, it's lame."
Blackman and his partner, Jordan Winer, formed a theater
group, the Alma Delfina Group. They took their idea to the
Magic and plans began to take shape.
Blackman emphasized that "all I did was come up with a
seed, an idea. The only way it can work is for people to give to
it."
An Oct. 16 celebrity benefit featuring Robin Williams
raised enough money to produce seven "Pieces' plays at the
Magic for a month. All ticket proceeds go directly to AIDS or
ganizations Project Open Hand and the NAMES Project.
Seven plays of the total "Pieces" collection will be shown at
the Magic through November. Blackman, who acts in the
plays, said that he hopes this will be only the beginning. "We
want to bring the plays everywhere — everywhere that [they
are] needed, and unfortunately, that is everywhere."
Playwright Dannv Hoch wrote one of the plavs, "Clinic

Con Class." Hoch, who has been performing in jails and alter
native high schools in Brooklyn, said this project calls for a
delicate balance in the writing.
"I think a lot of times when people try to do theater with a
social theme, they patronize and they spoon feed and they dic
tate," Hoch said. "I guess the challenge and the key is to ask
questions and to respect people and not to pretend you know
more than anybody else does just because you're a writer."
"Clinic Con Class" features two young guys at the neigh
borhood clinic, one black and one Latino. A rich, white
woman walks in and the story unfolds.
Hoch said he writes in language that people can under
stand.
"It is not elite, not exclusive, not avant-garde," Hoch said.
"It's real. Because of that, Sean and the 'Pieces of the Quilt'
asked me to write a play because they knew it would be some
thing that they could take to young people and that young
people wouldn't turn off from as they do to most theater be
cause it's horrible."
Playwright Erin Wilson, who was Blackman's drama
teacher in high school, wrote "My Girl is in Front," which
throws the spotlight on a 16-year-old girl in her first sexual
forays.
"I was interested in focusing on what it's like to become
sexually active and only know a world where making love
might kill you," Wilson said.
Wilson has written collaboratively before, but she said it
has never worked out as well as "Pieces."
"Often, there is a sense of competition," Wilson said. "This
naturally erases that possibility. This is pieces of a quilt. Pieces
of a quilt don't compete."
In addition to the performances at the Magic, "Pieces" will
be presented elsewhere. Blackman calls for "a communal con
frontation of the disease."
"There is a twofold mission in these plays," he said. "We
want to do this as theater, and then we want to go beyond the
theater. We want this to go into hospitals, libraries, schools,
community centers, women's groups. From there we can real
ly start to talk about it."
Any group or institution can contact the Alma Delfina
Group and have one or more of these plays read tor them.
"The Alma Delfina Group is working at hospitals, and I
think it's very exciting to do these things outside ot the regu
lar institutionalized thing that is American theater," Wilson
said.
Playwright Migdalia Cruz, whose play "So ... will be per
formed at the Magic, stressed that the production is not just a
social gesture.
