### 
"Just because it's political," Cruz said, "it also has to be
artistic. This show has honesty and wonderful performances
by the six actors. What it really is about is paying respect to the
past, to the memory."
As dead characters reappear onstage in almost every
"Pieces" play at the Magic, they speak and dance and cry for
themselves. Cruz's suggestion becomes a reality.
"Don't trample on the memory of your own ancestors and
our specialness," shouts a dead father in Gotanda's "Beans."
The emotional power in the show comes from the intense and
alive interactions between the characters and those who in
habit their memories.
l or Blackman, the project rests on its power to speak to the
community and the community's ability to respond. Like the
quilt, these pieces have to be tied together by those left living
and used to commemorate the past and to change the present.
"The only way to do something communal," he said, "is to
gether."
