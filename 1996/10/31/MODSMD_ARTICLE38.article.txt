## Back after two years, Chuck D disappoints 
### 
"In 1995 you'll twist to this," Public
Enemy frontman Chuck D declared on the
1989 rap anthem "Fight the Power." It was a
lyric meant to illustrate just how quickly the
musical climate of a genre as young as rap
can change, spoken with the assumption
that Public Enemy would, a mere six years
later, remain at the forefront of those
changes.
Not so. In 1994, after a three-year ab
sence during which gangsta rap took over
the charts, PE delivered a well-intentioned
but tediously titled misstep ("Muse Sick N
Hour Mess Age") that led to talk of Chuck I)
and company falling off.
The release of Chuck D's debut solo ef
fort, "Autobiography of Mistachuck," does
nothing but confirm this hypothesis. Song
after song finds Chuck bitterly lamenting
the state of the record industry and mutter
ing about "Big Willies" — black artists who
are unaware that "entertaining is today's
way of picking cotton."
Without PF's Flavor I lav to play jester to
('huck's king, politics like these quickly be
come unbearable. And when Professor Griff
— the PE member dismissed in 1989 after
some high-profile anti-Semitic comments
— resurfaces on "Horizontal Heroin,"
things get downright offensive. Griff's guest
appearance comes out of nowhere, taking
on the form of a I 1/2 minute telephone

schmooze that says essentially nothing and
seems crafted solely for the sake of contro
versy.
The music, constructed by the Bomb
Squad's Eric Sadler and Gary G. Wiz, is ad
equate if slightly spare, focusing on a few
steady beats and an occasional guitar riff —
a dense soundscape worthy of "Fear of a
Black Planet" this is not. Lyrically, Chuck
seems to be on autopilot, presenting a har
assed imitation of himself and referencing
Pete Rose — yes, that Pete Rose — as often
as "The Bell Curve."
"Mistachuck" does contain a few memo
rable moments, but they only serve as re
minders of what used to be. When Chuck
boasts that he "Never drank beer with the
boyz / But the love we shared was for the art
of noise," one can't help but think of the raw
emotion that used to inspire all of Chuck's
lyrics. These days, we get clumsy rhetoric
instead.
Anyone persistent enough to make it to
"Mistachuck's" final, hidden track, in which
Chuck catalogs his complaints against the
entertainment industry in a digitally altered
voice, knows all too well the level to which
Chuck has sunk. "Star spelled backwards is
Rats!" he embarrassingly bellows, revealing
a once great artist paranoid about his
shrinking role in the rap world today. Is this
how the career of a rap legend ends, bitter
and painfully out of step at age 35? Say it
ain't so, Chuck.
