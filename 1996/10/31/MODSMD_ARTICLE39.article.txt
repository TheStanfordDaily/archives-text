## "Billy Breathes" 
### 
I don't wear hemp jewelry. I don't trade
bootleg tapes. I've never been on tour.
Maybe that's why I still love the new Phish
album "Hilly Breathes."
Word via the Net is that this latest album
caters to radio listeners with short-attention
spans and an appetite for catchy lyrics. As a
recently converted Phishhead, I am not yet
prepared to address whether "Billy Breathes"
sells out to mainstream listeners; I'm just
down to hear some good music, and good,
clean music is what Phish's latest release is all
about.
Instead of a musical talent exhibition,
"Billy Breathes" presents a loosely connected
collection of simple songs. A favorite of
mine, "Talk," characterizes the mellow
mood of the album with its elementary
melody and sparse lyrics, "I can talk my talk
with you / Nothing's ever soaking
through / the filter that surrounds / your
thoughts /and holds out lessons left un
taught / I can sing my song with you." And
that's all folks — the words are repeated over

and over.
It may sound trite, but the band seems to
be making a statement here: Simplicity, or
more specifically, lucidity can elicit feeling
and thought just as profound as any Dylan
tune. Besides, when you're not focusing on
obscure, convoluted lyrics, the actual music
comes to the forefront of the album.
Some would call it simple; I'd prefer to
call it refined. "Cars Trucks Buses" exudes a
more typical Phishy sound. It's the token in
strumental piece on the album, thrown in
for the appeasement of the more critical
Phishhead. This song provides a freeform
exposition of Page McConnell's gospelly
keyboards, Fish man's funky beat and off-kil
ter riffs by Trey Anastasio and Mike Gordon.
"Billy Breathes" is definitely a tamer
album than what one normally equates with
Phish. You'll hear no vacuum cleaner accom
paniments or 15-minute acoustic jams, but
what this album lacks in eccentricity is made
up for with its sweet, whimsical sound.
This is not Phish on acid — it's Phish on
X. Touchy-feely, man. So, for all you Phish
virgins out there, this is the perfect gentle
album for your first time. And to the die
hards, quit the hard-core overanalyzing and
just sing along with Trey. The words are easy
to learn.
