The University's Academic
Planning Project advisory board
listened to a preliminary data re
port and discussed the project's
priorities for the next two years at
a meeting Friday.
Vice Provost for Institutional
Planning Geoffrey Cox has said
the project gathers and studies
data for University officials who
do not have the time or the re
sources to study issues in depth.
"When you're trying to make a
decision or advise a decision
maker, you'll want — but rarely
will have — the time or the staff
resources to investigate an issue
as thoroughly as you'd like," said
project director Eric Broque, who
compiled the report.

"The idea behind the project
has been to augment, for a couple
of years, the campus resources to
do that kind of investigation," he
added.
Examining the University's ap
proach to budgeting is among the
project's primary goals. Current
ly, decisions regarding the budget
and the endowment are made in
different areas of the University
with no meaningful linkage.
The original project proposal
also highlighted one example of
poor communication on issues of
long-term development.
Facilities, it said, are built ei
ther "as donors become available
or as needs become critical, with
out long-range infrastructure
planning."
