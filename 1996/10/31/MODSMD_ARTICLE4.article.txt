### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
The University's Academic
Planning Project advisory board
listened to a preliminary data re
port and discussed the project's
priorities for the next two years at
a meeting Friday.
Vice Provost for Institutional
Planning Geoffrey Cox has said
the project gathers and studies
data for University officials who
do not have the time or the re
sources to study issues in depth.
"When you're trying to make a
decision or advise a decision
maker, you'll want — but rarely
will have — the time or the staff
resources to investigate an issue
as thoroughly as you'd like," said
project director Eric Broque, who
compiled the report.

"The idea behind the project
has been to augment, for a couple
of years, the campus resources to
do that kind of investigation," he
added.
Examining the University's ap
proach to budgeting is among the
project's primary goals. Current
ly, decisions regarding the budget
and the endowment are made in
different areas of the University
with no meaningful linkage.
The original project proposal
also highlighted one example of
poor communication on issues of
long-term development.
Facilities, it said, are built ei
ther "as donors become available
or as needs become critical, with
out long-range infrastructure
planning."
Broque said he also hopes to
fine tune the"cost model" that
has been under development in
the Provost's Office. The model
will provide an economic profile of
each academic department and
program.
Once prepared, the model will
allow administrators to make in
formed decisions about investing
in academic programs.
"There's an endless supply of
great ideas at a place like this, and
the very, very hard part is sorting
out which ones to pursue,"

Broque said.
The project was launched in
January to assist in long-term in
stitutional decision making. It is
funded by an $800,000 grant from
the Jame6 Irvine Foundation and
falls under Cox's jurisdiction.
The project will study the way
in which academic programs —
especially first- and second-year
undergraduate programs — are
evaluated, examining how incen
tives affect faculty attitude to
ward teaching.
In addition, Broque and his
team of two analysts are gather
ing data on tuition pricing and fi
nancial aid policy, working closely
with the staff in the Financial
Aids Office.
