# NEW WORLD SPIRITS
## "Fortune Cookie" MORE MUSIC 
### 
You might think that a group named New
World Spirits would have something to do
with the New Age genre of music. Seeing a
picture of the Buddha on the hack cover of
the liner notes might further lead you to be
lieve that the allium in your hand could help
you reach some form of enlightenment. But
one glance at the title, "Fortune Cookie," and
you would have to know that this was indeed
an American album, made by an American
band and what you'd be listening to, had you
decided to bring it home and pop it in your
stereo, would be good old contemporary "al
ternative" American music.
By "alternative" 1, of course, mean main
stream and in this case "unoriginal." Taking
up the straightforward guitar and drums
sound of every other new rock band out
there, the album sounds less like the effort of
a single band and more like a compilation of
various artists.
The first song, "Rat Backwards," begins
with a guitar riff similar to the beginning of
"Peaches," by The Presidents of the United

States of America, while the rest of the mm'
takes on a loud "I'm pissed at the world and
I'm going to sing really loud now" tone, rem
iniscent of a few of Lives melodies.
With "Bed," the band stages a style war he
tween Blues Traveler and Better than E/ra,
with the former falling behind because ot
lack of harmonica riffs.
The next band that New World Spirits im
itates is Everclear, pounding out "Words tor
Trees" with airy lightness.
The album's only attempt at a fully "soft
song begins with a Beatles / Oasis melody,
mixing in what appear to be a few original
stylistic moments.
Interwoven in other songs are vocal dis
courses reminiscent of the likes of Bare
Naked Ladies and Seven Mary Three. Despite
the album's lack of originality, however, it
definitely has one major plus: If you happen
to like any of the other bands mentioned,
you'd probably like this album.
Besides that bonus, the CI) comes with a
fortune, which I assume is different for each
CD. Of course, I wouldn't go around buying
multiple copies just to check, but if that kind
of incentive impresses you, go for it.
Unfortunately for New World Spirits, in a
country where so many new bands are com
ing into the mass market every day, any real
attempt at "making it big" has to be accorn
