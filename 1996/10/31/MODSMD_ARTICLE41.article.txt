# BATTERY ACID
## "Rita" 
### 
Let's get right to the point: This CD sucks.
Vocalist Gretchen Seager has absolutely no
business with a microphone in her hand.
On the brighter side, the instrumental are
pretty good. Seager, bass player Chris Wagn
er and guitarist Louis Gutierrez all played to
gether in Mary's Danish, and this time
around, Wagner forms a respectable rhythm
section with drummer David Harte. Gutier
rez, an ex-Circle Jerks roadie, carries the
group throughout the entire album with his
dynamic chords, riffs and solos. However, let
Battery Acid set an example for the rest of the
rock world; it takes more than a good guitar
player to keep a group from going under.
To break the album down song by song,
the first single, "Crown on My Head," begins

with a catchy Gutierrez riff. It's
not a bad song. Next is "The
Break," a mediocre track. Every
thing goes downhill with the third
song, "Full Circle." Next, every
thing goes wrong on "Make it
Right."
"Superstar" is a good one.
Gutierrez takes full control of the
band, and his dynamic work sim
ply drowns Seager out. What next?
A slow song. Seager sings loudly
and off key, and the tempo of the
album grinds to a halt.
"With You" features
wanna-be Grace Slick vocals over
a psychedelic guitar. Gutierrez,
Harte and Wagner try to breathe
life back into the album with the
fast-paced "Drip Away," but the
harder the band plays, the more
Seager blows it. "Dirty Paper Bag"
is a dull acoustic nightmare, and

the album is finally brought to a close with
"Sweetheart," one of the better Battery Acid
songs.
A bit of advice for the brilliant Louis
Gutierrez: For goodness sakes, man, quit the
band. Your wife is a lousy singer, and your tal
ent is going down the drain. Hopefully the
next Battery Acid album, to be released on
another new label, Bigg Truck Records, will
have a different singer (hint, hint).
