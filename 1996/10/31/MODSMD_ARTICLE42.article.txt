# DUB NARCOTIC SOUND SYSTEM FEATURING LOIS
## "Ship To Shore" 
### 
If I were asked to sum up Dub Narcotic
Sound System in one sentence, my answer
would probably be something like "White
boys got the funk." Led by Calvin Johnson,
formerly of Beat Happening, Dub Narcotic
are indie rockers from the Olympia, Wash.,
dirty T-shirt sect who decided they were
going to play funk music. On "Ship To
Shore," their new EP, they expand their hori
zons, incorporating a trip-hop sound and
bringing in K Records indie chanteuse Lois
on guest vocals.
"Ship To Shore" is really just a single: four
mixes of one track plus a B-side. "Rougher,"
the B-side, is actually my favorite here. The
mellow guitar and fluid, understated bass
line complement Lois' vocals well. The first
mix of "Ship To Shore" is the most interest
ing; a good beat and harmonic synths in a
minor key create an undeniable groove. This
is adequate trip-hop, particularly since at
least the main mix of each song is played by a
live band. Not Tricky or Massive Attack, by
any means, but a listenable effort.
When I saw Dub Narcotic live last year,
there was no denying that they dished up ser
viceable funk. Yet the focus of the evening
didn't seem to be the music they played as
much as the identity of its players. It was as if
Calvin and Co., by playing groovy dance
music, were somehow tweaking the often
strident tone and rigid politics of many bands
in their community and proving that indie

rockers can dance, too.
That's an admirable goal, I guess — I'd
love to see some of the more humorless bands
around today lighten up and bust a move.
However, the quality of the music often feels
secondary, almost like an afterthought, as if
the band were just part of some indie inside
joke I didn't quite get. Once again, no prob
lem — but if that's the real point of the whole
exercise, why bother releasing CDs?
