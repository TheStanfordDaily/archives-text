# THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS
## "Factory Showroom" 
### 
After being a big fan for several years, my
adoration for They Might Be Giants flagged
considerably when founding members John
Linnell and John Flansburgh began employ
ing a full-time backing band, and their
recorded material began sounding more like
their live performances. To me, part of
TMBG's charm was the variety in instrumen
tation they displayed on their albums; on
"John Henry," their last album, the distinc
tiveness of each song was lost in the continu
ous wash of guitar chords. But I grew to ap
preciate "John Henry" and tried to ignore
their slow assimilation into the mass of gui
tar-heavy alt-rock.
Of course, J don't think TMBG could ever
become a bastion of dull modern-rock suck
dom; they're too intrinsically weird for that
to ever happen. But the weirdness becomes
stale when it's being continually recycled, a

trend I fear is continuing on their sixth
album, "Factory Showroom."
This album is mostly a portent that Linnell
and Flansburgh are running short on new
ideas. For one thing, this is TMBG's shortest
album at 13 songs (to compare, "John Henry"
has 20 tracks). I can only wonder what they
were thinking when they included "James K.
Polk," a 6-year-old B-side, on this album.
They also cover "New York City," a song by
cuddlecore pop band Cub, but if you don't
know who Cub is you'll wonder why TM BG is
playing such a straight-up pop song.
Keep in mind that these are the harpings
of a person who was raised on TMBG's first
three albums. In the musical netherworld of
the late '80s, TMBG was a breath of manic
fresh air, with their goony anti-rock aesthet
ic, macabre lyricism and geeky appeal. 1 don't
mind that they ditched some of that weird
ness in favor of writing loony, bouncy pop
songs, but on "Factory Showroom" they
aren't even capable of keeping up the energy
needed to sustain the songs.
A few tracks on "Factory Showroom"
merit mention: the first single "S-E-X-X-Y"
is a disco-funk throwdown of all things, com
plete with string section and wah-wah guitar;
"Till My Head Falls Off" is a breezy "John
Henry"-ish rocker; and "Metal Detector" has
cool burbling synths reminiscent of the Mag
netic Fields.
Unfortunately, three or four good songs
do not a good TMBG album make. People
who got to know TMBG through "John
Henry" will probably find something on this
album for them. As a longtime fan, though, I
can only mourn the decline and mainstream
ization of what was once a truly revolution
ary band.
