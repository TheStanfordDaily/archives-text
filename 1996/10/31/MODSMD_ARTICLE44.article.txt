# The
						explosive new 'Romeo & Juliet' features tommy guns, fast cars and lovers on acid. Is this an update of the classic or pure travesty?
## Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang!

It looks like Southern California, sounds like
MTV, feels like manic depression, tastes like hard
liquor and smells like teen spirit.
But as evidenced in the self-conscious title, it's
actually a Shakespeare classic.
In fact, the makers of this film even go as far as
to say that their aspirations were to make the kind
of movie the Bard himself would've made were he
still alive.
"My favorite response to that," said English Prof.
Jennifer Summit, "is if Shakespeare were alive
today, he would be very old."
Four hundred and thirty-two years to be exact.
But the point in making a Shakespeare film real
ly isn't to be the most Shakespeare-like, since by
the medium's very nature any movie will be vastly
different from any stage production.
"The point of doing a Shakespeare film is not to
try to capture some original essence of it but to
make an interesting contribution to an ongoing pro-

ject of adaptation and col
laboration," said Summit,
who will teach a course on
Shakespeare and film next
year.
Adaptation, interpretation
and reinvention is definitely
what you get with this pro
duction.
Director, co-writer and co
producer Baz Luhrmann
broughttothis project much
of the same creative team
as that of his first feature,
"Strictly Ballroom." His
team managed to maintain
much of the flair but none of
the garishness. The notori
ous sequined Rumba dress
es from that flick have been
replaced by Dolce & Gab
bana shirts and Prada suits.
For the backdrop of the
story they invented "Verona
Beach," a "created world"
inspired by Florida and shot
in Mexico City.
Co-writer Craig Pearce de
scribes this place as "a uni
verse that is recognizably
modern but has a little dis
tance. It's like a fairy tale
world, a world of stories
which really parallels the
movies.
"The 'reality' we see in the

movies is always a bit magnified, even when it's
supposedly realistic."
Magnified, for sure. More like blown out of the
water in this case.
Despite this far-out setting, the words are all
Shakespeare's but spoken in American accents.
Luhrmann explains that the plays "were written for
an accent that is much more ... like an American
sound" than the standard phony English accents
that Americans often use in Shakespeare perfor
mances.
However, English Prof. Ron Rebholz disagrees.
"Nobody pronounces English today the way it
was pronounced in Elizabethan England," he ar
gued, exempting an isolated colony in the Ap
palachians of West Virginia.
Since we can't re-create the original pronuncia
tion, Rebholz champions performing Shakespeare
in one's native accent.
"I hate it when Americans try to pronounce
Shakespeare's language as if it were being read by
a 20th-century Englishman," he said. "I also hate
the reverse; I hate it when the English try to do Ten
nessee Williams with an American accent."
Ten points for pronunciation.
However,

Shakespeare
fanatics are
bound to be dis
traught by this
production's
accent and
other modern
izations.

"There will be the standard hand-wringing and
people saying this isn't faithful to the original text,"
Summit said.
But Luhrmann and Pearce have a greater agen
da in mind: "to make it accessible" to a broad audi
ence.
Summit predicted that some people will be
grateful since "at least this will get 15-year-olds to
watch Shakespeare. As if this is going to elevate

15-year-olds I think it's a bogus argu
ment that Shakespeare is somehow
good for you."
Good, healthy and wholesome are def
initely not the gist of this movie. Sex, vio
lence and rock 'n' roll are more like it. In
fact, it seems that a lot of the sexuality we
tend to associate with the play has been

sublimated to hard-core aggression in
this version. No nudity but tons of gore.
"I wonder if this is an attempt to make
it marketable to a male audience," Sum
mit said. That might explain the gratu
itous butt shots of girls in bikinis on
Verona Beach.
There seems to be a conscious effort
to make this film sell. Premiere maga

zine, for instance, began receiving
weekly postcards advertising the movie
in September. How thoughtful.
This month I began to notice that all
the billboards and advertisements in
clude the URL for the "Romeo & Juliet"
Web site (www.romeoandjuliet.com).
How impressive. And at the film's press
screening, I was given a tall, orange hur
ricane candle complete with the heart
and dagger emblem — what bribery!
Perhaps marketing considerations also
had an impact on the casting of this film.
For while Verona Beach may be in part a
teen-age wasteland, it is also the land of
the beautiful people. Leonardo DiCaprio
(Romeo), Claire Danes (Juliet), Tybalt
(John Leguizamo) and Mercutio (Harold
Perrineau) are the cream of Hollywood's
gorgeous crop, making this film lustfest'96.
So the question we're all wondering
is, does remaking Shakespeare into a hot
new film with hot new actors somehow
prove the immortality of his works — that
Shakespeare's plays ring true for all peo
ple at all times?

Summit agrees with this

in part, but also
points out the flip ar
gument, that "be
cause [the play] is
subject to such

dramatic re
visions
i t

proves anything but this kind of univer
sality." After all, changing the play so
much turns it into a new story.
The truth may be in the middle. For
while Shakespeare's genius conceived
of the famous love scene in the play on a
balcony, Luhrmann re-enacts it in a pool.
And it's a whole new view from under
water.
