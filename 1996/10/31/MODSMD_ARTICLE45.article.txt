## DiCaprio and Co. bring 'Romeo' into the '90s 
### 
This is not what you're thinking.
No period costumes, no Baroque ar
chitecture, no funny accents, no men in
tights.
Think not of your ninth-grade English
class, not of Cliffs' Notes. Instead think
"Boyz 'N the Hood" meets "The Piano,"
think Shakespeare on ecstasy.
Literally. In the party scene, Romeo is
truly tripping. Yet aside from all the gim
micks — Romeo doing drugs, Mercutio
dressing up in drag, Tybalt demonstrat
ing flashy gunplay — the words are all
genuine Shakespeare.
But unlike stereotypical snobby
Shakespearean actors, this cast is so
young, hip and real, it's frightening.
Leonardo DiCaprio is thoroughly in
tense as Romeo, such that I can hardly
conceive of his infamous clowning
around on the set.
Claire Danes is a perfectly passion
ate Juliet, with her characteristic angst
ridden expression that you may remem
ber from "My So-Called Life." Both of
them can cry like angels and the chem
istry between them is explosive.
Equally impressive is the supporting
cast: The nasty Tybalt (John Leguizamo)
heightens the drama and ups the vol
ume, and the fun-loving Mercutio
(Harold Perrineau) adds a needed dose
of comic relief.

I have to admit, at the beginning of the
movie the combination of Romeo be
moaning his loss of love set against a
backdrop of urban grunge seemed a little
awkward. But quickly I became acclimat
ed to the world of Verona Beach, where
16th-century sociocuttural values meet
20th-century icons and aesthetics. Once
accustomed, the effect was mesmerizing
The set and scene perfectly and in
geniously complement the story and
even aid the understanding of the plot.
My only complaint is that the visuals are
so flamboyant and enticing to look at
low riders, neon crosses, altars, graffiti
— that at one point I almost stopped lis
tening to the words.
Equally innovative as the visuals is
the soundtrack. The variety of music
helps to set up the emotional effect of
the scenes: Rap for the aggressive guys
on the streets, Des'ree's sweet theme
song for the tender moments and gospel
for the pious religious scenes.
While female audiences are likely to
get a rise from the emotional poignancy
of "William Shakespeare's Romeo &
Juliet," you can drop all misconceptions
of it as a nice girly romance. This is a
bad-ass film. Smooch scenes aside, the
guns, cars and tattoos should be
enough to give any male viewer a suffi
cient testosterone rush.
Just beware. It is a tragedy, so don't
forget some Kleenex for the ending
