# FILM ARTS FESTIVAL
## Survival of the Coolest The 						Film Arts Festival puts the spotlight on much-neglected Northern California indie filmmaking 
### Story by Seeta Ganghadaran Graphics by Johnny Zannis 
This week's opening of the 12th annual
Film Arts Festival brings with it much antic
ipation and optimism for the Northern Cali
fornia independent film industry. At the
same time, it raises questions about the last
ing impact of the community.
For if independent film is to be taken seri
ously as a powerful alternative to its com
mercial counterpoint, then why hasn't the

local presence of independent filmmaking
and filmgoing been scrutinized?
After all, there arc more than 3,000 people
involved in independent filmmaking in San
Francisco. Yet, independent works garner the
attention of the community of filmgoers in
minuscule amounts.
During last year's festival, there were 200
screenings of independent works (5,000 peo
ple attended throughout the week). By com
parison, Paramount Pictures' "The First
Wives Club" has played on an average week
end at approximately 2,400 theaters. With an
estimate of 28 screenings per week for each
movie theater, this translates roughly into
70,000 screenings per week nationwide.

According to festival director Mark Tay
lor, the difference between audience atten
dance stems from people's inability to see the
full potential of film and video media.
"Film audiences are accustomed to being
told how to feel. Filmgoing is thought of as a
recreational activity, like you're being taken
for a ride," Taylor said. "People are so willing
to give away power to think, understand and
feel to movie stars."
But because the focus of independent film
moves beyond an entertainment-only for
mat, viewers are forced to engage themselves
with what's happening on the screen.
This, according to Taylor, may bring up
the realization of two things: One, that
movies can be produced with a modest bud
get; two, that they can present an alternative
vision of the world that can in turn influence
viewers to believe in their own capacity as
media makers.
"If I'm watching an independent film ...
the question which arises is, 'Why am I not
making something as aesthetically or politi
cally challenging?' It's an issue of social re-

sponsibility," Taylor said.
Taylor argued that
Hollywood filmgoers
"don't have the time to
be challenged by either
form or content." The
audiences of indepen
dents, in contrast, are
always involved.
"People who at
tend [the Film Arts
Foundation's) events
like them and say, '1
want to be there for the
next one.' [The founda
tion's] mission is to in
crease public awareness
via the innovative con
tent and form used by
independent Filmmak
ers and to teach that
Film is an art," Taylor
said.
While the cre
ative and productive
capacity of the inde
pendent scene suggests
that the foundation
has been successful (it
has 3,200 members),
the attention paid to
the independent Film
community is incom
plete.
"The Film Arts
Festival is considered
at the forefront in ex
perimentation and

documentation," Taylor said. "We have a
reputation for presenting the best docu
mentary films. This festival serves as a
clearinghouse for international and na
tional distribution."
This year's program features approxi
mately 80 works created by artists from
Northern California. Committed to the ex
ploration of social and political issues
through the media of film and video, these
filmmakers present an impressive array of
images.
From Michael Smith's "Jesse's Cone," a
piece about the controversial death of Oak
land rapper Jesse Rahim Hall, or Grace
Lee's "Camp Arirang," a glimpse into the
Korean prostitution rings that surround
U.S. military bases, to the experimental
and spooky "Tuning the Sleeping Ma
chine" by David Sherman, the selection at
the Film Arts Festival offers a variety of cel
luloid alternatives.
However, "locally, there's more of a
struggle to have the local press pay atten
tion to what's going on. For one, the distri
bution venues are not very visible," Taylor
said. "About 20 regular [San Francisco]
venues feature indie works — like Artists
for Television Access, SF Cinematheque,
Center for the Arts [ Yerba Buena Gardens].
But they don't get a lot of press."
While the foundation would like to see
members get more exposure in the local
community, its provisions are somewhat
scarce. Allotting $40,000 of their annual
budget for the festival, the foundation has
only $5,000 for remaining exhibition
events.
As a result, the foundation only plans
events once or twice a month, according to
Taylor, and this low frequency of events is
an object of concern.
"It's really important that we don't for
get the audience," said Taylor. "The films
made through [the foundation], or any
where else are not meant to sit in their
boxes and cans. They're meant to be seen
again and again. Every piece should be
brought back for multiple screenings. The
idea that we have to convince the main
stream press that independent film is a
newsworthy item is ludicrous."

The Film Arts Festival runs through Nov. 10,
with screenings at the Roxie Cinema (3117
16th St.), The Marsh (1062 Valencia St.) and
the Kabuki Theater (1881 Post St.) in San
Francisco. For film titles, screening times and
ticket information, call 552-FILM. Tickets cost
$5-8, and are available at the theaters' box of
fices. For additional information on the Film
Arts Foundation, call their office at 552-8760.

According to festival director Mark Tay
lor, the difference between audience atten
dance stems from people's inability to see the
full potential of film and video media.
"Film audiences are accustomed to being
told how to feel. Filmgoing is thought of as a
recreational activity, like you're being taken
for a ride," Taylor said. "People are so willing
to give away power to think, understand and
feel to movie stars."
But because the focus of independent film
moves beyond an entertainment-only for
mat, viewers are forced to engage themselves
with what's happening on the screen.
This, according to Taylor, may bring up
the realization of two things: One, that
movies can be produced with a modest bud
get; two, that they can present an alternative
vision of the world that can in turn influence
viewers to believe in their own capacity as
media makers.
"If I'm watching an independent film ...
the question which arises is, 'Why am I not
making something as aesthetically or politi
cally challenging?' It's an issue of social re-

sponsibility," Taylor said.
Taylor argued that
Hollywood filmgoers
"don't have the time to
be challenged by either
form or content." The
audiences of indepen
dents, in contrast, are
always involved.
"People who at
tend [the Film Arts
Foundation's) events
like them and say, '1
want to be there for the
next one.' [The founda
tion's] mission is to in
crease public awareness
via the innovative con
tent and form used by
independent Filmmak
ers and to teach that
Film is an art," Taylor
said.
While the cre
ative and productive
capacity of the inde
pendent scene suggests
that the foundation
has been successful (it
has 3,200 members),
the attention paid to
the independent Film
community is incom
plete.
"The Film Arts
Festival is considered
at the forefront in ex
perimentation and

documentation," Taylor said. "We have a
reputation for presenting the best docu
mentary films. This festival serves as a
clearinghouse for international and na
tional distribution."
This year's program features approxi
mately 80 works created by artists from
Northern California. Committed to the ex
ploration of social and political issues
through the media of film and video, these
filmmakers present an impressive array of
images.
From Michael Smith's "Jesse's Cone," a
piece about the controversial death of Oak
land rapper Jesse Rahim Hall, or Grace
Lee's "Camp Arirang," a glimpse into the
Korean prostitution rings that surround
U.S. military bases, to the experimental
and spooky "Tuning the Sleeping Ma
chine" by David Sherman, the selection at
the Film Arts Festival offers a variety of cel
luloid alternatives.
However, "locally, there's more of a
struggle to have the local press pay atten
tion to what's going on. For one, the distri
bution venues are not very visible," Taylor
said. "About 20 regular [San Francisco]
venues feature indie works — like Artists
for Television Access, SF Cinematheque,
Center for the Arts [ Yerba Buena Gardens].
But they don't get a lot of press."
While the foundation would like to see
members get more exposure in the local
community, its provisions are somewhat
scarce. Allotting $40,000 of their annual
budget for the festival, the foundation has
only $5,000 for remaining exhibition
events.
As a result, the foundation only plans
events once or twice a month, according to
Taylor, and this low frequency of events is
an object of concern.
"It's really important that we don't for
get the audience," said Taylor. "The films
made through [the foundation], or any
where else are not meant to sit in their
boxes and cans. They're meant to be seen
again and again. Every piece should be
brought back for multiple screenings. The
idea that we have to convince the main
stream press that independent film is a
newsworthy item is ludicrous."

The Film Arts Festival runs through Nov. 10,
with screenings at the Roxie Cinema (3117
16th St.), The Marsh (1062 Valencia St.) and
the Kabuki Theater (1881 Post St.) in San
Francisco. For film titles, screening times and
ticket information, call 552-FILM. Tickets cost
$5-8, and are available at the theaters' box of
fices. For additional information on the Film
Arts Foundation, call their office at 552-8760.
