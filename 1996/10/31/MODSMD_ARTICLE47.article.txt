best-remembered
phrase from PBS docu
mentaries

"Documentary" isn't
a cool word. Besides
possessing far more syl
lables than its competi-

tors "party" and "movie,
"documentary" recalls im

ages of a sleepy National

Geographic world: fish

spawning, bugs staring, time
elapsed photos of flowers
blooming.

But childhood memories aren't
.ill that accurate, and the world oftho

documentary isn't all that boring — it
can actually be all that and a bag of chips.

Unlike narrative for fiction-bas>cd) iUins,
documentaries are made with com pa rati'Wf

dinky resources, budgets usually made up of
grants and the filmmaker's own purse (they
don't have much) and the star power of real
people like you and me (we don't have any).
The exceptions are few.
However, documentaries often deal with
original topics and do more with them than
their fictional counterparts.
Just ask Jan Krawitz, Jacquie Jones, Kent
Sugnet, Johnny Symons or Banks Tarver, five
filmmakers affili?*'"! the masters' pro
gram in documentary film at Stanford. All
are showing their works at the Film Arts
Foundation Festival this week.
Their films and videos span a wide range
of topics and styles, but the filmmakers all
share two things — a fascination with reality
and a loyalty to the program that helped
them to capture it.
Krawitz, a Communication professor, be
lieves stories in the real world are "infinitely
richer than fiction stories" and possess an in
trinsic suspense and excitement just waiting
to be harnessed.
And although her films explore issues in
spired by personal curiosity, their ability to
speak beyond the subject matter is what al
lows the audience to find a meaningful
"point of intersection" to their lives within
the film.
The 27-minute work she is showing at the
festival, "In Harm's Way," though a reflective
piece on her experience as a victim of vio-

lence,
is meant

to resonate not

onlv with other victims but with "anyone
who's a human member of society," she said.
Using archival and original footage as well
as one especially eerie song, Krawitz decon
structs her childhood socialization to certain
views about safety and challenges people to
re-evaluate their own assumptions about
crime.
Class of' 96 alumnus Sugnet hopes to send
a more explicit message through "Compas
sionate Use," his video about the recently
busted San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club.
Sugnet, who finds it "more challenging to
deal with the existing reality," wanted to
make something that educated society — in
this case, in time for Tuesday's vote on Prop.
215 regarding the legalization of marijuana
for medical use.
To this end, he simply hung out at the
club, where he met members willing to share
their stories. Although his video, con
strained by the requirements of a class as
signment, is only 17 minutes long, he says he
could have made an hour-long documentary
about the history and medical use of mari
juana alone.
Granted slightly more leeway from Stan
ford, master's student Tarver was able to take
three cameras to Texas for his thesis film
"Watch Me Jumpstart" about the inspira
tional rock band "Guided By Voices."
Having already made three music videos
for the band, one of which ("I am a Scien

tist") played oxi MTV, the piece is a natural
extension of his personal friendship with
and admiration tor the Dayton, Ohio,

band, vvhich has only recently entered
the public eye.

A 36-year-old lawyer
turned-filmmaker, Tarver finds en
omragement in the band's com
mitment to follow their bliss.
"The music has so mud

integrity to it. ... It is literally a
person (singer Robert Pollard)
who had all this music inside of
him and had to get it out," Tarver
said. "He wouldn't be sane if he
didn't."

As for the collage-style of the
film, Tarver says it is "not a straight
documentary... it's just sort of like a
big messy film, which is the only way
ycu can make a film about these guys."
Class of 95 alumna (ones also used

music as a backdrop for her film
"Freestyle," which explores the participa
tion of black women in the world of rap
music.
But while mellow waxings move the piece
to a definite rhythm, she is clear to point out
that "it's not a film about rap music."
"It's about females who find their own
voice in a society that does not represent
them," Jones said.

Communication Prof. Jan Krawitz
believes stories in the real world
are "infinitely richer than fiction
stories" and possess an intrinsic
suspense and excitement just
waiting to be harnessed.

She is referring to white male society, of
course, hut also hlack male society, whose
music is often infused with misogyny and
homophobia. As told by various rap artists
and concert promoters she interviews, in
cluding Conscious Daughters, respect for
females and their music has been slow in
coming.
As a black female and former cultural crit
ic, Jones has alwavs been interested in "what

the production of culture meant as opposed
to its consumption." This interest, as well as
her desire to have a hand in that production,
led her to make the film.
"It's pretty easy to complain about other
people's films," Jones said, "but it becomes
'put up or shut up' after awhile."
While documentaries like lones' can be
original purely by virtue of subject matter,
others are original because of their ability to
cast an old subject in a new light.
Take, for example, student Symon's 7-
minute short, "Four F.yes." The film casually
traces the "coming of coolness" of eyeglasses,
starting from its beginnings as a cause for
teen-age angst.
Intentionally "fickle" — as he describes it
— compared to his past films, it was for him
an exercise in form rather than content; in it,
he combines personal narration, archival
footage and cinema verite inter\ iews to cre
ate a humorous, if not revelational, insight
into the eyeglass-wearing experience.
Will documentaries ever become cool?
Only time will tell, but in the meantime,
the Stanford documentary film program
will keep on keepin' on, mining the moth
er lode of reality for fresh stories and pei
spectives and producing more and more
quality entertainment just waiting to be
discovered.

The Film Arts Foundation's 12th annual Film
Festival goes through Nov. 10. "( ompasstonate

To this end, he simply hung out at the

Granted slightly more leeway from Stan

three cameras to Texas for his thesis film
"Watch Me Jumpstart" about the inspira

Having already made three music videos
for the band, one of which ("I am a Scien

the public eye.

"The music has so mud

integrity to it. ... It is literally a
person (singer Robert Pollard)
who had all this music inside of
him and had to get it out," Tarver
said. "He wouldn't be sane if he
didn't."

As for the collage-style of the
film, Tarver says it is "not a straight
documentary... it's just sort of like a
big messy film, which is the only way

"Freestyle," which explores the participa

music.
But while mellow waxings move the piece
to a definite rhythm, she is clear to point out
that "it's not a film about rap music."
"It's about females who find their own
voice in a society that does not represent
them," Jones said.

Communication Prof. Jan Krawitz
believes stories in the real world
are "infinitely richer than fiction
stories" and possess an intrinsic
suspense and excitement just
waiting to be harnessed.

She is referring to white male society, of
course, hut also hlack male society, whose
music is often infused with misogyny and
homophobia. As told by various rap artists
and concert promoters she interviews, in
cluding Conscious Daughters, respect for
females and their music has been slow in
coming.
As a black female and former cultural crit
ic, Jones has alwavs been interested in "what

the production of culture meant as opposed
to its consumption." This interest, as well as
her desire to have a hand in that production,
led her to make the film.
"It's pretty easy to complain about other
people's films," Jones said, "but it becomes
'put up or shut up' after awhile."
While documentaries like lones' can be
original purely by virtue of subject matter,
others are original because of their ability to
cast an old subject in a new light.
Take, for example, student Symon's 7-
minute short, "Four F.yes." The film casually
traces the "coming of coolness" of eyeglasses,
starting from its beginnings as a cause for
teen-age angst.
Intentionally "fickle" — as he describes it
— compared to his past films, it was for him

into the eyeglass-wearing experience.
Will documentaries ever become cool?

the Stanford documentary film program

■— Mv
best-remembered
phrase from PBS docu
mentaries

"Documentary" isn't
a cool word. Besides
possessing far more syl
lables than its competi-

tors "party" and "movie,
"documentary" recalls im

ages of a sleepy National

Geographic world: fish

spawning, bugs staring, time
elapsed photos of flowers
blooming.

But childhood memories aren't
.ill that accurate, and the world oftho

documentary isn't all that boring — it
can actually be all that and a bag of chips.

Unlike narrative for fiction-bas>cd) iUins,
documentaries are made with com pa rati'Wf

dinky resources, budgets usually made up of
grants and the filmmaker's own purse (they
don't have much) and the star power of real
people like you and me (we don't have any).
The exceptions are few.
However, documentaries often deal with
original topics and do more with them than
their fictional counterparts.
Just ask Jan Krawitz, Jacquie Jones, Kent
Sugnet, Johnny Symons or Banks Tarver, five
filmmakers affili?*'"! the masters' pro
gram in documentary film at Stanford. All
are showing their works at the Film Arts
Foundation Festival this week.
Their films and videos span a wide range
of topics and styles, but the filmmakers all
share two things — a fascination with reality
and a loyalty to the program that helped
them to capture it.
Krawitz, a Communication professor, be
lieves stories in the real world are "infinitely
richer than fiction stories" and possess an in
trinsic suspense and excitement just waiting
to be harnessed.
And although her films explore issues in
spired by personal curiosity, their ability to
speak beyond the subject matter is what al
lows the audience to find a meaningful
"point of intersection" to their lives within
the film.
The 27-minute work she is showing at the
festival, "In Harm's Way," though a reflective
piece on her experience as a victim of vio-

lence,
is meant

to resonate not

onlv with other victims but with "anyone
who's a human member of society," she said.
Using archival and original footage as well
as one especially eerie song, Krawitz decon
structs her childhood socialization to certain
views about safety and challenges people to
re-evaluate their own assumptions about
crime.
Class of' 96 alumnus Sugnet hopes to send
a more explicit message through "Compas
sionate Use," his video about the recently
busted San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club.
Sugnet, who finds it "more challenging to
deal with the existing reality," wanted to
make something that educated society — in
this case, in time for Tuesday's vote on Prop.
