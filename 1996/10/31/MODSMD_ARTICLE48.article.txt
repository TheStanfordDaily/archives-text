## Hero Masterpiece turns 'Collins' into hero and Neeson into star 
### 
Writer / director Neil Jordan's explosive
drama "Michael Collins" is a masterpiece of
epic proportions. Jordan vilifies neither the
British nor the Irish freedom fighters as he
captures on film Collins' struggle for Irish in
dependence.
Led by Liam Neeson in the title role — a
role he was destined to play — the accom
plished cast includes Aidan Quinn (best
friend Harry Boland), Stephen Rea (infor
mant Ned Broy), Alan Rickman (Presidentof
the Irish Republic Eamon De Valera) and
Julia Roberts (love interest Kitty Kiernan).
Amid the foul-proof armor of success
there are a few weak links. The film dives into
the story at such a breakneck pace it is virtu
ally impossible to follow. The editing is
shockingly abrupt. Jordan does not lead the
viewer by the hand. Rather, he assumes a
vaster knowledge of Irish history than most
Americans possess. He also neglects to con
nect the modern day Irish Republican Army
and other groups to those he portrays. It
takes the viewer's full attention to follow the
action.
Jordan's crowning achievement is casting

Neeson as Collins.
According to Jor
dan, when he began
writing the script
13 years ago, he had
Neeson in mind for
the role. Neeson's
Collins is a force to
be reckoned with.
Although fre
quently his drawl
stands in the way of
understanding the
dialogue, Neeson's
subtle facial expres
sions and sweeping
movements com
municate Collins'
passion and mag
netic presence with
ease. Whether he is

harshly barking out orders to his soldiers or
firmly pleading with Robert's Kitty to follow
him to safety, Neeson is capable of nailing
every scene almost flawlessly.
The film makes a point of using the word
"paradoxically" in one of Collins' speeches
and then again in the end titles. Collins truly
is a paradox. He is the founder of the IRA and

a leader of guerrilla tactics divisions that, in
the end, fights for peace. Jordan has immense
bravery to tackle this controversial and
bloody story.
Jordan's dedication was rewarded with the
Golden Lion Award for Best Film at the 1996
Venice Film Festival. Neeson brought home
the award for Best Actor.
Although "Michael Collins" is definitely

not a "let's wind down after midterms" kind
of movie, it's a superb film well worth the
money and the mental effort needed to fol
low the subtleties. It reflects the heart and
dedication that poured into its making as
well as a plea for more education on this
taboo topic and period of British and Irish
history.
