# Bring Back the 'F'
## Even funny-man Lovitz can't save 'High' from failure 
### 
When a person goes to see a film with the
name Zucker attached to it, he or she is expect
ing great slapstick comedy. Successful movies
like "Airplane" and"The Naked Gun" put the
Zucker brothers on the forefront of the
spoof / slapstick genre.
On the other hand, David and lerry have
had their duds. "High School High," produced
and written in part by David Zucker, is one of
them.
"High School High" is a direct spoof of last
year's hit "Dangerous Minds." Our hero is the
bumbling Richard Clark (Jon Lovitz), a wildly
optimistic teacher who leaves his position at
his father's boarding school to educate inner
city kids at Marion Barry High.
W hen he gets there he quickly discovers the
bad state of things — students selling jewelry
in the hall, teachers chaining their cars to the
ground and a principal who likes to whack stu
dents on the head as they walk by — and be
comes determined to make the school a better
place.
He meets the lovely Victoria Chapell (Tia
Carrere), an administrative assistant (nobodv

likes being called a secretary) who supports his
noble efforts, and establishes the token ro
mance. Naturally, Clark eventually reaches
the kids and miraculously turns the school
(and the surrounding neighborhood) into a

beautiful, friendly place. The students even
take an achievement test to prove how smart
they've become. Along the way, trouble comes
in the form of a local gang and Principal Doyle
(Louise Fletcher), who bears a grudge against
Clark.
Now one might argue that a movie like
this is meant to have a silly plot. 1 agree, and
I believe that this story has a lot of potential.
Flicks about school and revolutionary teach
ers are always grave impressions of a failing
society; somebody's got to break the ice. Be

sides, it's always amusing to poke fun at the
way today's kids dress, act and socialize;
"Clueless" did that, and with commendable
flair.
The problem with "High School High" is
that it doesn't roll for 90 straight minutes the
way it's supposed to. Too many of the serious
points from other movies rub off here; Clark
has to stop a drug ring, teach kids who literally
don't know how to open a book and get one
student into (dare I say it?) college. These little
plot twists make the movie very cheesy very
fast.
The sad thing is, the movie does no justice
to Lovitz, who is a great comedian. The dia
logue is poorly structured, and it's apparent in
his sarcastic tone. The sex scene between Clark
and Chapell is more bad lines than full frontal
comedy. Worse still, the whole cast comes off
looking like a batch of bad actors.
The movie is also unsure of its target audi
ence. Many spoofs are aimed at young to mid
dle-aged viewers, and other age groups can
pick off bits of the slapstick. Unfortunately,
there are plenty of people who hardly under
stand their own teen-agers, much less a come
dy about them. Kids might relate to the char
acters but will most likely fail to enjoy the
"older" humor.
Thus, "High School High" is an interesting
idea, but its tragic flaw is the plot basis itself. It
simply fails to fit the Zucker brothers' formula.
Even if the writing was substantially better, the
whole thing would be a flop waiting to happen.
