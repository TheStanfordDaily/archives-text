# Low-fat?
## Dining Services nets 6th in survey 
### Robert Chiles 
According to a recent national
study, Stanford ranks sixth
among 40 colleges and universi
ties surveyed in the availability
of low-fat and vegetarian foods
in dining services.
The ranking — conducted by
the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine — was
based on the daily allowances of
varied, healthy, low-fat, low
cholesterol and vegetarian foods
at breakfast and dinner.
Schools with do-it-yourself
bars and a daily choice of low-fat
entrees scored higher than those
with plain salad bars and
steamed vegetables, according to

the survey.
"We contacted the top univer
sities in the country — their food
service managers — and they
provided us with sample
menus," said Kathy Savory,
media coordinator for the group
that conducted the survey.
"We're hoping to let people know
what's going on and influence
their eating decisions."
Savory maintained that the
infamous "freshman 15" — the
weight-gain many first-year stu
dents can expect — is not a myth.
"We hear from students all the
time complaining about the
weight-gain," she said.
