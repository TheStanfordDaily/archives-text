# Low-fat?
## Dining Services nets 6th in survey 
### Robert Chiles 
According to a recent national
study, Stanford ranks sixth
among 40 colleges and universi
ties surveyed in the availability
of low-fat and vegetarian foods
in dining services.
The ranking — conducted by
the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine — was
based on the daily allowances of
varied, healthy, low-fat, low
cholesterol and vegetarian foods
at breakfast and dinner.
Schools with do-it-yourself
bars and a daily choice of low-fat
entrees scored higher than those
with plain salad bars and
steamed vegetables, according to

the survey.
"We contacted the top univer
sities in the country — their food
service managers — and they
provided us with sample
menus," said Kathy Savory,
media coordinator for the group
that conducted the survey.
"We're hoping to let people know
what's going on and influence
their eating decisions."
Savory maintained that the
infamous "freshman 15" — the
weight-gain many first-year stu
dents can expect — is not a myth.
"We hear from students all the
time complaining about the
weight-gain," she said.
Andrew Nicholson, director of
preventive medicine at the
Physicians Committee for Re
sponsible Medicine, said he be
lieves nutrition patterns formed
early in life will be maintained
throughout adulthood.
"Students required to partici
pate in a meal plan shouldn't be
sentenced to unhealthy eating,"
Nicholson said. "Developing
healthy eating habits in college
is a lesson that will last a life
time."
Shirley Everett, associate di
rector of Housing and Dining
Services, explained how resi
dence meals are balanced. "We
provide low-fat food items, fresh
baked bread, fresh salad bar and

fruit at every meal, steamed veg
etables, low-fat dressings, low
fat cheese, vegetarian and vegan
entrees," she said.
"We are continually upgrad
ing our offerings to make sure
meals are nutritious, but stu
dents continually ask for french
fries, hamburgers, pizza, etc., so
we try to provide a well-balanced
meal," she added.
According to Everett, Hous
ing and Dining Services works
closely with Cowell Student
Health Center and keeps regis
tered dietitians on its staff.
Scoring first in the study was
Duke University, and the bottom
three spots were filled by the
three military academies. Stan
dard West Point meals include
high-cholesterol servings of fried
chicken, ham, steak, hot dogs
and peanut butter and jelly sand
wiches, the study reported.
