## Stanford prof anticipates a 'polyracial' future in California 
### Rollin Hu 
In the beginning conservatives created Proposition 187.
And they said, "Let there he intolerance in the land." And
conservatives made the California Civil Rights Initiative.
They said, "Let there be an end to affirmative action to sep
arate the rich from the disenfranchised." But like manna in
the forest, defying the all-powerful conservative machine,
comes Stanford lecturer Dale Maharidges new hook, "The
Coming White Minority: California's Eruptions and the
Nations Future"( Random House, $25).

BOOK REVIEW

Winner of the 1990 Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, Ma
haridge continues his excellent writing in offering an accu
rate, astute criticism of intolerance. His book focuses on the
fact that between 1998 and 2000, "California will make new
history when whites officially fall to less than half its total
population." Within the next 50 years after that point, the
nation will follow suit and become "polyracial."
No predominantly white industrial society, writes Ma
haridge, has ever evolved into a "mixed culture." California
will set the stage for what will happen throughout America
as the nation enters this critical transition period. Unless
people, especially (lalifornians, can learn to understand and
cope with differences, the nation could become violently
balkanized.
"The Coming White Minority" is a refreshing call for
common ground in a debate that all too often swings to the
extremes, following extremist, racially intolerant books like
Charles Murray's "The bell Curve" and Peter Brimelow's
"Alien Nation," Maharidge's book urges people ofall ethnic
ities to re-examine their beliefs and find a more tolerant po
sition in a rapidly changing population.
"By its sheer size and unique nature," Maharidge writes,
"California can be the testing ground" of multiethnicity. Ac
cording to one politician quoted by Maharidge, "If Califor
nia is successful, the country can be successful." but if we fail
now to establish harmony in our changing culture, we might
as well become "the Balkans or be the northern version of a
banana republic."
Despite its serious topic, Maharidge's book is written in
flowing, everyday language, with humor interspersed
throughout. Maharidge avoids fusty academic pretentious
ness and thus injects his arguments with vitality and a rele
vance to today's society. The book is a compelling, persua
sive reinstatement of the values of tolerance and equality.
Maharidge centers his book around the lives and predica
ments of four people, each representing one of the major
racial groups in California. Bill Shepherd, a conservative
white Orange County businessman, Don Northcross, a
black sheriff from Sacramento, Maria Ha, an Asian-Ameri
can student at UC-Berkeley and Martha Escutia, a Latino
state representative from Los Angeles, all confront the racial
currents underlying California's transition. Through exam
ining each side of California's multifaceted population, Ma
haridge clearly and fairly explores how each has responded
to society's move toward a white minority state.
Using interesting historical digressions, Maharidge es
tablishes that this move from an almost all-white society —
in 1900, California was 90 percent white — to today's poly
ethnic society has not been a smooth one. I le describes cy
cles of racial intolerance from the lynching of Chinese im
migrants in the late 19th century to the 1992 Los Angeles
riots. Unfortunately, even in "liberal" California, intoler
ance continues to this day, manifested in the current debate
over immigration and affirmative action.
Maharidge sees the current anti-immigration, anti-affir

mativc action hysteria as a dangerous warning sign ot fur
ther racial polarization. Initiative legislation like Proposi
tions 187 and 209, he writes, are the products of "a handful
of right-wingers" who exploit middle-class insecurities to
push racist ideologies into the mainstream. He uses the au
thors of Proposition 187 as an example of how the extrem
ist right-wing can induce a majority to vote for their ideas.
Kven though these paranoid authors claimed that "the Unit
ed Nations will use unrest in Mexico as an excuse to invade
the United States," many moderates still voted for the
proposition.
Maharidge is relentless in his criticism of the right, con
tinuing his attack on conservatism by verbally bombarding
Governor Pete Wilson. "As these extremists gained power,"
he writes, "they were bolstered by the state's governor, Pete
Wilson, a supposedly moderate Republican who latched on
to their success and used the backlash for political gain."
but Maharidge also decries the actions and ideology of
the far left. Racial separatists and radical college students, he
asserts, have worsened race relations by justifying many oth
erwise unfounded fears of the conservative white commu
nity.
Activists who seek the creation of a separate, minority
state and "ethnic elitists" who consider whites "outsiders,"
for example, lend support to many conservatives' fears that
their society is being taken over by minority extremists. Eth
nocentrists, Maharidge claims, cause as much racial friction
as their conservative counterparts.
Furthermore, according to Maharidge, liberals are partly
to blame for allowing the right to dominate the debate. The
left has failed to provide moderates with an alternative to the
conservative agenda and is often uncoordinated in its resis
tance to legislation like Proposition 187. With regard to
Proposition 187, Maharidge writes that "Democrats were
committing suicide for the Republicans."
In the end, suggests Maharidge, people of all races need
the same things: stability, jobs, education and safe neigh
borhoods. The only way to get them is to have everyone
work together. Unless California can make it peacefully
through these difficult transition years, the fate of the nation
is in jeopardy.

Governor Pete Wilson. "As these extremists gained power,"
he writes, "they were bolstered by the state's governor, Pete
Wilson, a supposedly moderate Republican who latched on
to their success and used the backlash for political gain."
but Maharidge also decries the actions and ideology of
the far left. Racial separatists and radical college students, he
asserts, have worsened race relations by justifying many oth
erwise unfounded fears of the conservative white commu
nity.
Activists who seek the creation of a separate, minority
state and "ethnic elitists" who consider whites "outsiders,"
for example, lend support to many conservatives' fears that
their society is being taken over by minority extremists. Eth
nocentrists, Maharidge claims, cause as much racial friction
as their conservative counterparts.
Furthermore, according to Maharidge, liberals are partly
to blame for allowing the right to dominate the debate. The
left has failed to provide moderates with an alternative to the
conservative agenda and is often uncoordinated in its resis
tance to legislation like Proposition 187. With regard to
Proposition 187, Maharidge writes that "Democrats were
committing suicide for the Republicans."
In the end, suggests Maharidge, people of all races need
the same things: stability, jobs, education and safe neigh
borhoods. The only way to get them is to have everyone
work together. Unless California can make it peacefully
through these difficult transition years, the fate of the nation
is in jeopardy.
