# Maharidge, Minorities and the Middle Ground

### 
Dale Maharidge, who once quit a tenured position at Cor
nell University to write about the 1992 Los Angeles riots, has
come out with a new book after studying cultural change in
California for five years.
"The Coming White Minority: California's Eruptions and
the Nation's Future," represents a point of view developed
from years of experience and observation. Maharidge, a for
mer reporter for the Sacramento Bee and current lecturer in
the Stanford Communication Department, finds the concept
of cultural change to be fascinating. After reading a newspaper
article about the declining white population of California, a
moment of inspiration struck him.
"1 realized all 1 had been writing about [for the Bee) for 11
years was about cultural change," he said in an interview.
"Everything I wrote about — poverty, residential patterns, dif
ferent conflicts — it was about cultural change. So I thought,
that's my next book."
Maharidge recently shared some of his thoughts with Inter
mission.
On ultraconservative writers:
"You know Peter Brimclow's book ("Alien Nation"]? That guy
should be sunk in the ocean! Here he says, only good immi
grants should come, meaning British immigrants. You know,
who says you're the best immigrant? 1 hate that. He takes this
polar right-wing extreme view, and he gets a lot of ink. 1 don't
want to do that. 1 talk about both the left and the right. 1 take
both groups to task. I don't believe either group should get off
scot free."
On how critical it is for California to establish a smooth transi
tion to a polyracial society.
"It's vital. If California doesn't work, the nation won't work.
Take Massachusetts. Have you ever been to Massachusetts?
Massachusetts, in particular, is a very racist place — polarized
black and white relations. Eighty-some percent white in Mass
achusetts, maybe 85, 90 percent white. If you took California's
mix right now and stuck it in Massachusetts, there'd be war.
There's so much that works here, there's a lot working. But that
part of the country has to learn from us, and they better learn
quickly because society is going to change no matter what."
On racist right-wing extremists:
"There are people who say we should be a white country. Well,
we shouldn't have brought slaves in from Africa. We shouldn't
have brought Chinese workers to work on the Transcontinen
tal Railroad. All those things create immigration, and there's
nothing wrong with it. Who said this country was supposed to
be founded by European immigrants? The same pressure came
from Asia at the same time. But the Europeans were bigger and
stronger and kept them out. So, California would have been a
multiracial society a long time ago if it weren't for a white
backlash. So, this has been an inevitable pressure on our soci
ety. And now, it's unstoppable. So either you live with it, or you
basically are part of the problem."
On why people should get along.
"I was on a hate radio show [a few days ago). The guy wanted
me to be a typical liberal and say, 'We should all hold hands
