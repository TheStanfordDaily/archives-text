# Brink talks politics with students at Flo Mo
## Republican candidate emphasizes need for technology perspective in government 
### Nadia Elghobashi Contributing writer 
Ben Brink, the Republican hop
ing to represent Stanford in Con
gress, discussed his political views
and fielded questions from a small
group of students during an ap
pearance last night at Loro.
Brink, who is challenging U.S.
Rep. Anna Eshoo, the Democratic
incumbent, emphasized his busi
ness acumen and leadership expe
rience, saying a representative
from Silicon Valley should "un
derstand Silicon Valley."
Brink, the chief operating offi
cer of the Engineering Consor
tium computer chip manufactur
er, said his experience over the last
15 years in the technology indus
try made him realize the impor
tance of legislation which has no
"perverse and unintentional con
sequences.
"I began to feel that nobody in
Congress had run a technological
company," Brink said.
Brink graduated from Stanford
in 1974, after having served as the
president of the Young Republi
cans. He also actively campaigned
for Richard Nixon in the 1972
presidential election.
Brink, who ran to represent the
14th district in 1994 but was de
feated by Eshoo, said he had to
overcome the issue of arrogance
before he felt comfortable running
for Congress.
"I thought it was arrogant for
a businessman to try to run for a
big office because he thought he
had some ideas," he said. "But
then I realized that representa
tives are just average folks repre

senting their people and their dis
tricts."
And Brink says that's exactly
what he would like to do.
"We need somebody who has an
industry perspective and who's
not out to rape the environment,"
Brink said.
Although Brink favors deregu
lation, he stressed the importance
of efficient regulation.
"The idea isn't that regulation
is wrong and inappropriate,"
Brink said. "The question is, 'How
do we create regulations which are
appropriate?' Regulators need
more flexibility."
Brink called himself a "libertar
ian, with a little 'I,' " saying the
greatness of the country is based
on the people and on the limita
tions of the government.
"We need to see ways to de
politicize the arguments — spend
less of the country's resources on
documentation and silly stuff and
more on actually solving prob
lems," Brink said.
Calling social security and
Medicare "fundamentally flawed,"
Brink said many federal problems,
including the growing national
deficit, could be solved by a reduc
tion in the size of the federal gov
ernment.
"The federal government has
many duplicative and counterpro
ductive activities which would be
solved with a smaller govern
ment," Brink said.
Brink, a proponent of Proposi
tion 209, also known as the Cali
fornia Civil Rights Initiative, said
the piece of legislation is "very lim
ited."
"I don't believe it hurts an afTir

mative action effort which assists
people to achieve certain stan
dards," Brink said.
Brink said the birth of his first
child seven weeks ago has had a
distinct impact on his political
views, making him "more emo

tionally tied to the future than be
fore."
"It has become very important
to me that the generations which
follow me have the same opportu
nities which I have had," the can
didate said.
