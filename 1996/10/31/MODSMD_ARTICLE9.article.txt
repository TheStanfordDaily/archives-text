# Research associate dies of skin cancer
## 
### Dan Downey 
Tracy Tingle, a research asso
ciate in the Center for Materials
Research and the Department of
Geological and Environmental
Sciences, died Oct. 19 of metasta
tic malignant melanoma, a form
of skin cancer. He was 39.
Tingle came to Stanford in
1993 after completing his mas
ter's and doctoral work at UC-
Davis. While at Stanford, Tingle
worked as laboratory director of
both the electron microprobe lab
oratory and the X-ray photoelec
tron spectroscopy facility. Both
laboratories are used to reveal the
chemical composition of materi
als.
Tingle's colleagues said they
were uniformly impressed and in
spired by him. Turgut Gur, tech
nical director of the materials re
search center, called Tingle a
"monument to human strength
in the face of pain."
Those who knew Tingle de
scribed him as a free spirit with a
zest for life. This passion was per
haps most manifested in Tingle's
love of the outdoor. He was a cer
tified guide in both kayaking and
river rafting and often biked to
campus from his home in Half
Moon Bay.
His friends and colleagues also
described him as a man who was
excited about entering a new
phase of his life: He married
Martha Sample Tingle just two
months ago.
"He was highly professional,
but he just had these very charm
ing, human qualities that made
you feel good," said Malcolm
Beasley, director of the Center for
Materials Research.

The passion which permeated
Tingle's life had a great influence
on his work, according to Dennis
Bird, an associate professor of ge
ological and environmental sci
ences. Tingle had "an insatiable
curiosity that was contagious and
complimented his love of the out
doors," he said.
Gur described Tingle as "a bril
liant scientist with a high level of
energy, a real problem-solver."
When Tingle arrived at Stanford
the electron microprobe facility
was"in need of a great deal of
work," Gur said, "and Tracy real
ly turned it around."
In a characteristic fashion,
Tingle did not let his illness stand
in the way of his work. Although
he began chemotherapy in Au
gust, he continued to research ar
senic and pyrite in the Mother
Lode Mining District until very
recently.
Glen Waychunas, who collabo
rated with Tingle, Bird and Peggy
O'Day, a researcher at Arizona
State University, will present
that study to the Geological Soci
ety of America in Denver today.
Last week, family, friends and
colleagues from across the coun
try gathered at the Lumsden
Campground near the Tuolumne
River in the Sierra Nevadas to cel
ebrate Tingle's life. A memorial
service for the Stanford commu
nity is being planned.
In addition to his widow, Tin
gle is survived by his stepchil
dren Gerrit and Mara Veneman,
both of Half Moon Bay; his sister,
Deborah Allen; his brother-in
law, Chuck Allen; his father, Ted
Tingle; and nieces Jaime and
Shannon Fusell, all of North
Carolina.
