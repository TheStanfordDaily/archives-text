# Taking the traditional route
## Student leaders in touch with major parties 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
Editor's note: This is the second
installment in a two-part series fo
cusing on four student political
leaders at Stanford.
During his three years at Stan
ford, Republican Youth President
Danny Bramzon has witnessed
what he calls a "liberal tyranny"
on campus.
"There are Republicans on
campus," said Bramzon, a senior.
"But it's hard to find them."
For this reason, Bramzon chose
to focus his energies during the '96
campaign on helping out local Re
publican candidates, such as Ben
Brink, rather than pursuing a
voter registration drive at Stan
ford.
The Stanford Democrats, on
the other hand, held a vigorous re
cruitment campaign on campus.
Of the 1,050 students who regis
tered to vote during the recent
ASSU registration campaign,
about 680 were Democrats. The
Stanford Democrats were reward
ed $700 for their efforts.
Junior Dave Thomas, chair of
the Stanford Democrats, conceded
that most people on campus who
label themselves are probably De
mocrats.

Senior Danny Bramzon, Republican Youth President, (left) and junior Dave Thomas, chair of the Stan
ford Democrats, put aside their opposing political views yesterday to share a friendly moment.
