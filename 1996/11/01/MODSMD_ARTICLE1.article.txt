# Taking the traditional route
## Student leaders in touch with major parties 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
Editor's note: This is the second
installment in a two-part series fo
cusing on four student political
leaders at Stanford.
During his three years at Stan
ford, Republican Youth President
Danny Bramzon has witnessed
what he calls a "liberal tyranny"
on campus.
"There are Republicans on
campus," said Bramzon, a senior.
"But it's hard to find them."
For this reason, Bramzon chose
to focus his energies during the '96
campaign on helping out local Re
publican candidates, such as Ben
Brink, rather than pursuing a
voter registration drive at Stan
ford.
The Stanford Democrats, on
the other hand, held a vigorous re
cruitment campaign on campus.
Of the 1,050 students who regis
tered to vote during the recent
ASSU registration campaign,
about 680 were Democrats. The
Stanford Democrats were reward
ed $700 for their efforts.
Junior Dave Thomas, chair of
the Stanford Democrats, conceded
that most people on campus who
label themselves are probably De
mocrats.


Chad Bennett — Daily
Senior Danny Bramzon, Republican Youth President, (left) and junior Dave Thomas, chair of the Stan
ford Democrats, put aside their opposing political views yesterday to share a friendly moment.
But Thomas' Democrats still
had to work hard to combat what he
perceives as the lack of connection
many students feel toward political
parties. "Apathy has been our
biggest problem," he said. "It's per
vasive over most college campuses."
He attributed that in part to a
general level of contentment among
students.
Thomas' upbringing in Manhat
tan had a lasting impact on his po
litical ideology, he said.
"New York City is overwhelm
ingly Democratic," he said. "If I had
grown up somewhere else, maybe I
would have seen things differently.
"It seemed to me that the De
mocrats were the party of the un
derdog and the disenfranchised,"
he said. "They seemed to be the best
vehicle for social change."
In 1992, his junior year at high
school, Thomas volunteered and
canvassed for Clinton's campaign
and became involved in local politi
cal campaigns.
When Thomas came to Stan
ford, there was no active Democrat
ic student group on campus. To
gether with fellow-freshmen Bill
Shen and Maria Bleavins, he found
ed the Stanford Democrats in Janu
ary 1995.
"It was an uphill battle as a
bunch of freshmen trying to con
vince people we were serious," said
Thomas.
Thomas has been impressed by
Clinton's 1996 presidential cam
paign and predicted that he will still
be president of the United States
after the polls close on Tuesday.
"Clinton has been more attuned
to the needs of the middle class... .
He has captured the center. Our
country is essentially a moderate
Republican country," he said.
"I have to like Dole because he's
a Kappa Sig," said Thomas, a fellow
fraternity member. "Dole was re
spectable and talented as a senator,
but he has shown himself to be an
inept [candidate for] president."
Thomas, a public policy major,
wants to go into politics in the fu
ture, but only after he has learned a
profession and gained experience in
the private sector.
"I don't think just anyone can
waltz in there and govern," he said.
"Some people are adept at govern
ing. ... Some parts of politics are
sleazy, but politics is a noble profes

sion."
Bramzon, president of Stanford
Republican Youth, has political am
bitions of his own. Since the second
grade, his teachers have told him
that he should become the first
Mexican-American Jewish presi
dent of the United States, he said.
My parents have "always want
ed me to get involved in politics," he
said. "People have always liked me
and listened to what I say."
Twenty-year-old Bramzon, a
history major, is applying for law
school this year, and after that
training he plans to go into the po
litical arena.
He grew up in Miami and lived in
Guadalajara, Mexico for four years.
His high school in Miami was racial
ly divided — one-third of the stu
dents were black, one-third were
white and one-third were Chicano.
"I was raised seeing racial differ
ences and how people connect," said
Bramzon. This experience con
trasts strongly with the "ethnic en
claves" he has witnessed in Califor
nia, he said.
"People should be seen as indi
viduals, not as a group," he said.
"Just because I'm a Mexican
doesn't mean I'm going to follow a
group consciousness."
As a freshman, Bramzon set up
the Stanford chapter of the moder
ate Republican Youth, which dif
fers from the College Republicans
and the Republican Party in its pro
choice platform.
"I don't agree with Bob Dole's
lineor Bill Clinton's view: I'm in the
middle," he said.
"It has been difficult at Stanford
because I'm a Mexican Republi
can," said Bramzon. "It's difficult
to be in the middle. You think both
sides will like you, but both sides
end up not liking you. My Mexican
friends call me a traitor and the Re
publicans call me a squish."
The terrible social conditions
Bramzon saw some of his high
school friends experience attuned
him to the problems faced by mi
norities in this country.
"Republicans are helping the
underdogs to rise up on their own,"
he said. "The liberals are asking for
handouts." Bramzon is a firm be
liever that people should work their
own way up and only ask for help
when they need it.
When asked who he thinks will
be president of the United States on
Tuesday night, Bramzon said, "I'm
supposed to say Bob Dole." But se
cretly he is hedging his bets on Clin
ton.
