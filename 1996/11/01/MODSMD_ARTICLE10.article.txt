# Record turnout?
## 89 percent of 18- to 24-year olds plan to vote on Election Day 
### Kelly E. Young Contributing writer 
The young adults of America
are more politically active than the
public perceives — at least, ac
cording to the number of regis
tered voters. Even the most stu
dious Stanford students will be
crawling out of their study nooks
next Tuesday to vote.
According to a national survey
conducted by Global Strategy
Group, Inc., 89 percent of young
people surveyed said they are like
ly to vote in the upcoming presi
dential election. A turnout of this
magnitude on Tuesday would be
much higher than the young-voter
turnout in the 1992 election.
In 1992, only 42.8 percent of el
igible 18- to 24-year-old voters
showed up at the polls — the high
est voter turnout for this age
bracket since 18-year-olds became
eligible to vote in 1972.
Experts say the World Wide
Web, campus registration drives
and the "Motor Voter" registra
tion enacted under 1993's Nation
al Voter Registration Act were
major factors in registering stu
dents this year.
The Internet's information ex
plosion has helped candidates and
campaigns to reach young voters.

Youth Vote '96, a coalition of
about 25 grass-roots organiza
tions that have registered more
than 1 million young voters, has
used its Web page extensively to
reach young voters.
"At Youth Vote '96 we have
been averaging over 120 hits per
week for the last few weeks," said
Coalition Coordinator Erik Cole.
"We are a part of Netstock which
begins [today], and we expect
usage to skyrocket. The Internet
has been a really effective tool in
our organizing."
MCI and MTV's Rock the Vote,
another organization trying to
motivate young voters, sponsored
Net Vote '96 which registered
1,000 voters online in its first 24
hours.
Although the Internet may be
an effective way of registering vot
ers, according to Communication
Prof. Steven Chaffee, a very small
percentage of Americans rely on
the Internet for political informa
tion. He said the number may in
crease in the future as more people
gain access.
Chaffee categorized voters into
four categories: Democrats, Re
publicans, swing voters and apa
thetic voters.
