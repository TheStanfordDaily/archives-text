# Record turnout?
## 89 percent of 18- to 24-year olds plan to vote on Election Day 
### Kelly E. Young Contributing writer 
The young adults of America
are more politically active than the
public perceives — at least, ac
cording to the number of regis
tered voters. Even the most stu
dious Stanford students will be
crawling out of their study nooks
next Tuesday to vote.
According to a national survey
conducted by Global Strategy
Group, Inc., 89 percent of young
people surveyed said they are like
ly to vote in the upcoming presi
dential election. A turnout of this
magnitude on Tuesday would be
much higher than the young-voter
turnout in the 1992 election.
In 1992, only 42.8 percent of el
igible 18- to 24-year-old voters
showed up at the polls — the high
est voter turnout for this age
bracket since 18-year-olds became
eligible to vote in 1972.
Experts say the World Wide
Web, campus registration drives
and the "Motor Voter" registra
tion enacted under 1993's Nation
al Voter Registration Act were
major factors in registering stu
dents this year.
The Internet's information ex
plosion has helped candidates and
campaigns to reach young voters.

Youth Vote '96, a coalition of
about 25 grass-roots organiza
tions that have registered more
than 1 million young voters, has
used its Web page extensively to
reach young voters.
"At Youth Vote '96 we have
been averaging over 120 hits per
week for the last few weeks," said
Coalition Coordinator Erik Cole.
"We are a part of Netstock which
begins [today], and we expect
usage to skyrocket. The Internet
has been a really effective tool in
our organizing."
MCI and MTV's Rock the Vote,
another organization trying to
motivate young voters, sponsored
Net Vote '96 which registered
1,000 voters online in its first 24
hours.
Although the Internet may be
an effective way of registering vot
ers, according to Communication
Prof. Steven Chaffee, a very small
percentage of Americans rely on
the Internet for political informa
tion. He said the number may in
crease in the future as more people
gain access.
Chaffee categorized voters into
four categories: Democrats, Re
publicans, swing voters and apa
thetic voters.
"Young voters tend to be more
in the [swing voter and apathetic]
categories," he said. "In a given
year, young voters tend to be at
tracted to the party that's in
power at the moment."
According to junior Dave
Thomas, chair of the Stanford De
mocrats, "Stanford, overall, is no
more apathetic compared to other
campuses in the United States."
Students' hectic schedules may
play a part in apparent apathy on
campus, said ASSU President Bill
Shen.
"I think we're apathetic be
cause we're busy," Shen said.
"People on this campus are very
reactionary. If [an issue] comes
up, they'll react to it.
"Why are students apathetic?
Maybe they're just turned off" by
mainstream politics, Shen added.
National statistics certainly
point in that direction. Of the
400,000 18- to 24-year-olds regis
tered by the Rock the Vote cam
paign, most declined to register
with a party.
According to Shen, the purpose
of the ASSU's "Voice Your
Choice" campaign, which brought
third-party candidates to campus,
among other activities, was to "ex
pose students to all issues that are
out there."
Despite an awareness of the di
versity of candidates, students
may still opt for mainstream can
didates.
"Young people this year will
probably vote Democrat because
that's how everybody's voting,"
Chaffee predicted.
But Thomas said the politi
cians' stance on the issues are part
of what draws students to the De

mocratic Party.
"The positions of Bill Clinton
and the Democratic Party tend to
be a lot more in line with what col
lege students are concerned about
— the environment, stance on
abortion, education," Thomas said.
"Especially with this election,
Bill Clinton is really seen as a pres
ident of youth, for youth, of this
country," he said. "In contrast,
Bob Dole just looks too old."
College Republicans Chair
Jonathan Russell, a sophomore,
disagreed.
"Bob Dole has done a lot to ap
peal to young voters," Russell
said. "His Web page is perhaps the
most symbolic of his actions, while
school choice and his tax plan
would deal with issues that con
cern us directly. If implemented,
Dole's budget plan very likely
would reign in the deficit and re
move the burden of Clinton's huge
tax hike."
Political preferences aside,
both Thomas and Russell agreed
on the importance of registering
in California.
Thomas, whose group has reg
istered more than 1,000 voters on
campus since Sept. 20, encour
aged students to register here in
stead of filling out an absentee bal
lot for two reasons.
"First, it's easier to vote here,"
he said. "Second, you're going to
be here for four years."
He said students might lose
touch with their home state and
district issues during their time at
Stanford.
Russell said he thinks students
registered in California may have
more incentive to vote because
they are more aware of the local is
sues.
"For those of us that are regis
tered in California," he said,
"Propositions 209 and 215 will be
what drives students to the polls."

tered by the Rock the Vote cam
paign, most declined to register
with a party.
According to Shen, the purpose
of the ASSU's "Voice Your
Choice" campaign, which brought
third-party candidates to campus,
among other activities, was to "ex
pose students to all issues that are
out there."
Despite an awareness of the di
versity of candidates, students
may still opt for mainstream can
didates.
"Young people this year will
probably vote Democrat because
that's how everybody's voting,"
Chaffee predicted.
But Thomas said the politi
cians' stance on the issues are part
of what draws students to the De

mocratic Party.
"The positions of Bill Clinton
and the Democratic Party tend to
be a lot more in line with what col
lege students are concerned about
— the environment, stance on
abortion, education," Thomas said.
"Especially with this election,
Bill Clinton is really seen as a pres
ident of youth, for youth, of this
country," he said. "In contrast,
Bob Dole just looks too old."
College Republicans Chair
Jonathan Russell, a sophomore,
disagreed.
"Bob Dole has done a lot to ap
peal to young voters," Russell
said. "His Web page is perhaps the
most symbolic of his actions, while
school choice and his tax plan
would deal with issues that con
cern us directly. If implemented,
Dole's budget plan very likely
would reign in the deficit and re
move the burden of Clinton's huge
tax hike."
Political preferences aside,
both Thomas and Russell agreed
on the importance of registering
in California.
Thomas, whose group has reg
istered more than 1,000 voters on
campus since Sept. 20, encour
aged students to register here in
stead of filling out an absentee bal
lot for two reasons.
"First, it's easier to vote here,"
he said. "Second, you're going to
be here for four years."
He said students might lose
touch with their home state and
district issues during their time at
Stanford.
Russell said he thinks students
registered in California may have
more incentive to vote because
they are more aware of the local is
sues.
"For those of us that are regis
tered in California," he said,
"Propositions 209 and 215 will be
what drives students to the polls."
