civil defense official said all 95 people on board were

U.S. consulate in Sao Paulo said.

Tobolla, a financial director at the company. His
hometown was not released. A second passenger
was identified as David Andrews, 49, of San Jose,
Calif., a vice president of Behring Diagnostics
Inc.-Americas, a subsidiary of the Hoescht phar

maceutical group.
There was no word on the nationalities of others

Odwalla drinks recalled
SEATTLE (AP) — A popular brand of fruit
juices was pulled off store shelves in seven Western
states and Canada after health officials linked the
product to an outbreak of E. coli bacterial poisoning.
As of Wednesday, health officials in Washington
state had confirmed 13 cases of E. coli infection
and at least 10 of them involved Odwalla fruit
juices. At least eight possible cases were also being
investigated.
Thirteen types of juice were being taken off the
shelves, Odwalla said. While they all contain some
apple juice, most of them, like Blackberry Fruit
shake and Mango Tango, do not have "apple" in
their names.
