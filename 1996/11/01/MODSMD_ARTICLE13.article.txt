### 
PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -
Jenny Jones denied knowing yes
terday whether one of her talk
show guests had been deceived
about appearing on a show about
gay crushes, but noted, "The
premise of the show was that it
was a surprise."
Jones testified in the murder
trial of former guest Jonathan
Schmitz, who claims he was driv
en to kill after Scott Amedure
confronted him on the"The
Jenny Jones" show with
"whipped cream and champagne"
fantasies of gay sex.
"This was ambush television
wasn't it?" defense attorney Fred
Gibson asked.
"No,' Jones said in a soft voice.
Later, when asked if she had
ever objected to a topic on her

show, she gave a familiar answer:
"I don't recall."
Jones also said she sometimes
doesn't know the topic of each
day's show until she receives a
folder of background, a script and
other information the night
before. She said she has no knowl
edge of any conversations her
producers have with guests
before shows.
Defense lawyers don't deny
Schmitz, 26, shot Amedure, 32,
three days after the March 1995
taping. But they say he has a his
tory of mental problems, and the
humiliation of the show pushed
him over the edge and kept him
from forming the intent neces
sary to commit first-degree mur
der.
The defense claims the show

led Schmitz, a heterosexual, to
believe he would meet a female
admirer.
Under grilling from Gibson,
Jones acknowledged that a show
participation form Schmitz
signed before his appearance
made no reference to the topic —
"Same-Sex Crushes."
The show never aired, but
about two weeks after it was
taped, Jones read a statement on
the air saying she wanted to set
the record straight "about a show
involving secret admirers."
Jones denied misleading the
public by failing to mention in the
statement that the show was
about same-sex crushes and that
the admirers were gay.
"The premise of the show was
that it was a surprise," she said.
