President has students
in mind as he sets the
course for next century

Four more years of Bill
Clinton in the White House
seemed an unlikely sce
nario just two years ago. But now
Clinton has emerged as the clear
cut superior candidate to lead
America until the next millenni
um.
Amid concerns about his char-

acter and his ability to
make the leap from gover
nor of a small state to the
presidency, Clinton has
shown time and again he is
up to the task of leading
the most powerful country
on earth. Although con
fronted with a Republican

Congress for the last two years of
his term, he refused to back down
and maintained his effective lead
ership.
Clinton benefits from his com
petition's shortcomings. Bob Dole
has made terrific contributions to
America, but his character
strengths fail to offset a woeful
campaign strategy filled with
gross exaggerations and attacks
on Clinton. A vote for Ross Perot
may register one's frustration,
but Perot has no chance to win
and insufficient political experi
ence.
While Dole assaults Clinton for
his lack of political backbone and
laments the economy's abysmal
state, the Dow Jones index has
climbed to record heights, interest
rates are down and the economy
has continued growing steadily.
Clinton has taken steps toward
reducing the deficit and has
assisted those who need economic
assistance at the same time.
Clinton's plans to make post
secondary education more afford
able demonstrate his concern for
today's students, while Dole and
his Republican cronies are largely
responsible for slashing education

funding. Clinton has consistently
identified with the troubles of stu
dents while Dole has lobbied for
the abolition of the Department of
Education.
The president has improved at
his job throughout his four years,
learning from his failures and
earning respect from peers and
outsiders. Even in the biggest fail
ure of his term, the health care
debacle, he pointed the political
agenda in the right direction;
most Americans desire some form
of universal health care. On the

other hand, Dole has made
no secret of his plans to
reduce much-needed Medi
care expenditure increases.
Dole pledges to cut taxes
15 percent if elected; if vot
ers believed him, he should
have moved closer to Clin
ton in the polls. But he

hasn't, indicating that while Clin
ton may not be the most outstand
ing citizen ever to reside in the
White House, voters are not nec
essarily more willing to trust Dole
than Clinton.
Clinton has earned a reputation
as a Teflon man; the various
potentially embarrassing situa
tions which have arisen during his
presidency have managed not to
stick to him. If elected, Clinton
should endeavor to address this
concern in his second term. Most
would agree that the character
issue is the biggest thorn in Clin
ton's side.
But Dole is hindered by numer
ous thorns. Questions about his
age, ability to compromise, eco
nomic plans and allegiance to
Republican bigwigs have followed
him throughout his campaign, and
he has been unable to shake them.
While Dole has been quick to assail
Clinton as a poor excuse for a pres
ident, he has failed to convince
most that he can do better.
In light of the available alterna
tives. a second term of Clinton has
the best chance at providing
America sound presidential lead
ership.
