## Stanford-speak uncovered 
### 
THE STANFORD DIALECT of
abbreviation: Many use it, most
hate it, but it still gives the slow
er kids chuckles. I think we should stop
using it immediately, and this is why:
First, the rest of society correlates intel
ligence with the use of polysyllabic
words; second, let's look at the structure
of these abbreviations. Fro Yo. Flo Mo.
Hoo Tow. Co Ho. Two syllables ending
in vowel sounds. What else sounds like
this in everyday speech? Let's see. Doo
doo? Pee pee? Ka ka? Wee wee? We've
given our campus landmarks names
reminiscent of childhood terms for
excretory functions. Honey!!! Junior
just Mu Fuued all over the ottoman. Uh
oh. Smells like Co Po in here.
But more interesting than the ques
tion of why using abbreviations makes
us seem juvenile is the question of how
these abbreviations came to be in the
first place. Maybe you think they let us
communicate faster, more efficiently.
Maybe you also notice the difference
between 99 and 100 nanoseconds.
Maybe you should telnet to the forest
and spend some time with the trees.
I will offer the real reason lying
behind our slang: Every abbreviation is
actually the link between each build
ing's false and real identity.
Confused? Let me explain. Consider
Hoo Tow. You think it stands for
Hoover Tower, but you are wrong. You
think Hoover Tower is full of conserva
tive economists, and there you are

wrong again. Everyone in Hoo Tow is
secretly engaged in a sinister plot to
take over the world through soulless
music — ladies and gentlemen, Hoo Tow
is actually the secret recording studio
for HOOTie and the blOWfish. "No
bootlegging," says Milton Friedman.
Really — if economists made music,
wouldn't it sound like Hootie?
And now we turn our scrutiny on
another campus icon — Lag. "But that
stands for Lagunita," you say. "It's the
old dorm, that charming one close to the
lake." But you lie . . . because Lagunita
does not mean lake, especially not at
Stanford. It really means big-dry-hole
in- t he-ground-for-most-of-the-y ear.
And you did not live there, either. You
did not have to share an 8-foot-by-14-
foot box with another full-sized human,
and so you could never understand that
Lag is really Stanford's guLAG, a "facil
ity" where Stanford sends its "problem
freshmen." I lost fifteen pounds that
year. And I still couldn't stretch out in
the room.
There is yet another secret I must
share, lest you be exposed to health
risks from unawareness. You have been
to "Tres Ex," haven't you? It is the sort
of place where one can walk in late on a
Tuesday night and buy a pack of gum
for $8. But it is not just a horrendously
overpriced market. No, Tres Ex is not
only Tresidder Express but the Stanford
cenTRE for drugs and SEX. I know, I
didn't buy it myself until a friend visit

ing from off campus said, "Man, there
are a lot of uptight folks strutting
around here. I bet a brothel or opium
den would do real well in these parts."
Oh, was he ever right.
And finally the Co Ho, that chicest of
campus hangouts, where people watch
people watch people study. But there, in
the corner, lurks a pack of subversives.
They huddle suspiciously, dunking their
goatees in pricey Burmese quadra-lat
tes, shuffling pink pamphlets and a pack
of smokes between them.
"I love your new leather coat," one
purrs. "It's the same shade of black as
your turtleneck." _ .
"Thanks," says the other. "Daddy
bought it in the City. From each accord
ing to his abilities, to each according to
his needs."
"Ha ha. You are most clever, Dieter."
And suddenly it all becomes clear.
These are not your typical cafe squat
ters — these are Commies, Stanford
style. By lounging in the COmmunist
HOpeful training center, smack in the
middle of Stanford University / Country
Club, they send a message about as
mixed as a get-well-soon card from Dr.
Kevorkian.
Posers of the world, unite!
