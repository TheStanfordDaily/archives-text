Prop. 215 is key to starting dialogue on drug legalization

WEDNESDAY'S EDITORIAL
titled "Proposition 215: No" can
be summed up as easily as its
suggested vote: wrong. While the editors
did manage to pick away at the bill and
uncover its "true" objective — legalizing
marijuana — they fail to acknowledge
both the important benefits of the bill at
face value and the crucial first step it
takes in ending the illogical and ineffec
tive policy of drug prohibition.
There are numerous reasons why all
drugs should be legal — the most impor
tant being the elimination of the prosper
ous black market that is currently
destroying our inner cities and filling our
jails — but that is a different, although
related, issue. Prop. 215, despite having
"questionable" side effects concerning
legalization, mainly focuses on a very real
and very pertinent problem: easing the

pain of those suffering from serious, often
incurable, illnesses without forcing them
to turn to the streets to find their
"medicine."
The editors maintain that it is not
right to circumvent the Food and Drug
Administration and the traditional means
to regulate drugs. This sounds reasonable
on the surface, but I'd like to see any one
of the authors of Wednesday's editorial
look an AIDS or cancer patient in the eye
and tell t hem to wait for the government
to gather evidence .and approve his or her
treatment and then watch as the patient
answers with the pain of knowing he or
she will most likely pass away before that
judgment has arrived.
The system is a Catch-22; in order to
go through the FDA — as the editorial
suggests — endless research must be per
formed, research that is currently not

allowed or extremely difficult to perform
due to the government's "Schedule 1"
classification of most illegal substances.
Such contradictory policy takes a ballot
measure such as Prop. 215 to break the
cycle and create the initiative to begin
seriously reviewing marijuana and other
drugs that deserve more medical and legal
attention.
The bill also will not create the anarchic
drug use (i.e., smoking pot in restaurants)
that the editorial seems to suggest. Section
1.C(2) of the proposition reads, "Nothing
in this section shall be construed to super
sede legislation prohibiting persons from
engaging in conduct that endangers oth
ers. .which effectively eliminates the
fear of "smoking and driving" and the
aforementioned restaurant issue.
It is true that there is not yet signifi
cant scientific proof showing the healing

effects of marijuana, but people suffering
from horrible diseases deserve this benefit
of the doubt, even if a few drug addicts
with "migraines" will also gain in the pro
cess.
The government has no business
depriving sick patients with "medicine"
that already has enough significant back
ing to suggest that it will help. Further
more, the bill represents the first brave
step in ending the most costly, ineffective,
and immoral war that the United States
government has waged since Prohibition.
It's about time for people to realize
that legalizing drugs is not the same as
condoning drug use. It's time for a
change, and if it takes helping sick people
to start the process, that is just something
the public will have to live with.
