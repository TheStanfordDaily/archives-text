# Prop. 209 supporters and critics trivialize the legacy of MLK
## 
### 
Recently, organizers in favor of Proposi
tion 209 cited Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr.'s "I have a dream" speech as one more
reason to vote for the initiative. Dr. King
would have agreed with us, they say, and
so our effort is validated.
As interesting as it might be to challenge
the legitimacy of this assumption, it is
imperative that this not become the focus
of any effort to resist Prop. 209. The ad
campaign mentioned above engages in a
simplistic objectification of Dr. King. Either
side might use him to support their posi
tion, but the truth of the matter is, we will
never know what Dr. King would have said.
The use of his image, his words or his
name as a tool, by either side, is dangerous
and destructive. It results in the tnvLaljza
tion of Dr. King and consequently damages
the integrity of the dream he espoused and

belittles the complexity both of thought
and action, involved in achieving that
dream.
But beyond all this, and beyond Prop.
209 even, I think that the controversy says
a lot about the social change movement
today. Dr. King worked directly to abolish
legal discrimination against African Amer
icans. His actions sprang from a deep
desire to create a just world of true equal
opportunity, and it is all too tempting to
fall back on the words and actions of Dr.
King and others in the civil rights move
ment of the 19605.
But we need to l<x>k forward. Tremen
dous strides have been taken toward a
world of social equality, and, on the surface
things are decidedly more fair than they
were some 40 years ago. The more deeply
rooted causes of discrimination, though,
till need attention, and it is the duty of
people now to engage in that struggle.
We need to find the new voice, the new
movement. This does not mean that we
forget the ideology of Dr. King, nor that we
discredit the vision that he held. We must
not, however, use the movements of the

past as the sole motivating factor or legit
imizing element of our efforts.
It is citizens of today who best under
stand the needs of this world here and
now. It is we who must create the new
vision, we who must divine how to best
address the needs of the present.
