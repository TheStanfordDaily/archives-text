# Dean Waits responds to criticism about the homeless issue
## 
### 
In my 15 years working in higher
education, I have never responded to a
letter to the editor. However, the letter
which appeared in yesterday's Daily
from Hernan Galperin has compelled me
to write.
Simply stated, Galperin includes four
quotes in his letter regarding the issue
of feeding the homeless on campus
which he attributes personally to me.

Galperin goes on to utilize these quotes
to make completely absurd and mean
spirited assertions, again, attributable to
me.
If Galperin, a doctoral student in com
munication, took the time to read the arti
cle in question carefully, he would have
realized that all four of these quotations
were provided by another University offi
cial. I sincerely hope that Galperin care
fully reviews the text of any article before
he publicly attacks someone.
Moreover, I do not believe that this
particular article accurately portrayed
the context in which I explained some of
the University's concerns regarding this
issue. Stanford enthusiastically supports
student community service on and off
campus and believes strongly that these
types of initiatives, on and off campus,
certainly contribute to the educational
process.
I would be delighted to discuss this
matter personally with any member of the
campus community seeking clarification.
