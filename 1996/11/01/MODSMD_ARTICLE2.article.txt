# Ranking crusade gains more support
## 
### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
The crusade against U.S.
News & World Report's annu
al college rankings, launched
by ASSU Vice President Nick
Thompson, is picking up
speed on campuses across the
nation. In the past week, stu
dent leaders at 10 more col
leges and universities have
come on board, bringing the

total number of schools involved to 35.
Thompson' 9 action group, called the "For
get U.S. News Coalition," encourages univer
sity student governments to pass resolutions
denouncing the magazine's ratings and ask
ing their administrations to withhold data
from U.S. News until changes are made.
Four schools — Albion College, University
of Michigan, University of Pittsburgh and
Rice University — have joined Stanford in
passing resolutions of this sort.
Similar proposals will soon be considered
by the student governments at Yale Universi

ty, Caltech, UC-Berkeley, Smith College, Mt.
Holyoke College, Harvard University, MIT,
Syracuse University, Wesleyan University,
Carnegie Mellon University, the University of
Chicago, the University of Wisconsin, UC-
Santa Cruz, Claremont McKenna College and
Princeton University.
Within the next three weeks, the resolu
tion will also be voted upon by the entire Uni
versity of California Student Association, the
Ivy Council and possibly the Oklahoma Stu-


Thompson
dent Government Association.
"I'm over-awed by how quickly
people have been mobilized by
this," said junior Amanda At
wood, an assistant to Thompson.
"It's absolutely amazing,"
Thompson said. "We had no idea
that so many schools would jump
on board."
Since launching the campaign
earlier this month, Thompson
has been hard at work soliciting
support for the program. He has
enlisted students from around
the country in his efforts, includ
ing 20 winners of the Harry S.

Truman Scholarship. Thompson
is a Truman scholar.
Thompson also wrote a col
umn that was published in the
Los Angeles Times, in which he
explained his motivation for the
anti-U.S. News campaign.
"These rankings have had an
enormous negative impact both
on prospective college applicants
and the colleges themselves," he
wrote.
Though Thompson has been
the movement's prime instigator,
students at other schools have be
come deeply involved. At Rice, for
example, students took only two
weeks after first hearing Thomp
son's appeal to pass a resolution
condemning the rankings. Stu
dent leaders at that school are

now actively involved in advanc
ing the cause.
Charles Klein, vice president
for external affairs of the Rice
student organization, said that in
only 2 1/2 weeks, he has become a
firm believer.
"Over the past few years these
rankings have become more and
more important to prospective
students," he said. "Obviously,
these numbers cannot reflect the
type of education that you are
getting at any institution."
Klein said Rice plans to pitch
the program to fellow Western
Athletic Conference schools and
other universities in the Houston
area. Given the campaign's cur
rent rate of growth, he believes
that 100 schools could well be in

volved within a month.
Stanford leadership has simi
lar feelings about that number,
Atwood said. In the near future,
the activist group is aiming to
broaden its support base in order
to add to its credibility. Having
the student government at Yale
— this year's No. 1-ranked school
in U.S. News — pass a resolution,
for example, would be a huge
boost to the program.
The group is also drafting a
concrete proposal to send to the
magazine outlining the changes
in ranking format being demand
ed.
Thompson said he thinks the
group's chances of influencing a
change in the magazine's ranking
system are "extremely good."
