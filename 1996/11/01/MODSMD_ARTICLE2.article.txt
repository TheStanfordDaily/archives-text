### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
The crusade against U.S.
News & World Report's annu
al college rankings, launched
by ASSU Vice President Nick
Thompson, is picking up
speed on campuses across the
nation. In the past week, stu
dent leaders at 10 more col
leges and universities have
come on board, bringing the

total number of schools involved to 35.
Thompson' 9 action group, called the "For
get U.S. News Coalition," encourages univer
sity student governments to pass resolutions
denouncing the magazine's ratings and ask
ing their administrations to withhold data
from U.S. News until changes are made.
Four schools — Albion College, University
of Michigan, University of Pittsburgh and
Rice University — have joined Stanford in
passing resolutions of this sort.
Similar proposals will soon be considered
by the student governments at Yale Universi

ty, Caltech, UC-Berkeley, Smith College, Mt.
Holyoke College, Harvard University, MIT,
Syracuse University, Wesleyan University,
Carnegie Mellon University, the University of
Chicago, the University of Wisconsin, UC-
Santa Cruz, Claremont McKenna College and
Princeton University.
Within the next three weeks, the resolu
tion will also be voted upon by the entire Uni
versity of California Student Association, the
Ivy Council and possibly the Oklahoma Stu-
