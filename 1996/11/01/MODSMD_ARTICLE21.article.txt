## Joe Freund Stanford administration is caught in a 'stag hunt' by U.S. News 
### 
IN THE OCT. 23
issue of The Daily,
Mallory Roberts and
Susan Owen argued that
the students concerned
with the influence the
U.S. News & World
Report college rankings
have over the decisions of
Stanford's administra
tion should take the issue

up with the administration and not
directly deal with U.S. News or with
other colleges.
In doing so, they used an analogy
depicting the Stanford administration
as the "boyfriend" of Stanford students.
This "boyfriend," they stated, was "hav
ing an affair" with U.S. News, thus
breaking the trust they had with the
students. Of course, the blame for an
affair can not be placed entirely upon
the mistress, so according to the analo
gy, the administration is responsible for
its policies and should be confronted
accordingly.

This analogy is completely incorrect.
An affair, as Owen and Roberts describe
the relationship between the administra
tion and the magazine, is a consensual
relationship, an encounter where the dis
loyal partner places his desire for self
gratification over the relationship she
has with her mate.
The relationship between the admin
istration and U.S. News is far from con
sensual. Just last month, President
Casper wrote a four-page letter to the
U.S. News editorial board, lambasting
them for their brazen assumptions and
irresponsible data and algorithms.
Casper eloquently stated, "I am extreme
ly skeptical that the quality of a universi
ty — any more than the quality of a mag
azine — can be measured statistically.
However, even if it can, the producers of
the U.S. News rankings remain far from
discovering the method." No Don Juan
would treat his mistress in such a fash
ion.
In my Political Science 35 class last
year, we learned about a variation of the

famous Prisoner's Dilemma called the
Stag Hunt. The Stag Hunt refers to a sit
uation where a group of hunters form a
ring around a deer and several rabbits. At
once, the rabbits and deer all try to
escape the circle. Each hunter must
choose either to cooperate by raising his
hands and stop the deer from escaping, or
betray his fellows, duck and grab a rabbit,
thus allowing the deer to escape by
bounding over his head.
Were all the hunters to cooperate, the
deer would be caught, and its meat would
be more than enough to satisfy all
hunger, while the meat provided by one
rabbit would be much less sustaining. If
even one hunter were to grab a rabbit,
however, the stag would escape, leaving
those who tried to cooperate hungry and
betrayed.
Stanford is experiencing such a Stag
Hunt. We all are in agreement that if
there was no pressure to conform to arbi
trary standards set by a magazine such
as U.S. News, each college and each col
lege applicant would be more free to

make their own decisions, and all would
be better off.
Hut the Stanford administration can
not risk leaving its students hungry and
betrayed; were it to follow the example of
Reed and stop submitting data to U.S.
News, the magazine would simply fabri
cate all data it could not find for itself,
and its approximations would be less
than generous. Reed fell to 38th place
after it stopped submitting data. Presi
dent Casper already has received phone
calls from hordes of alumni angry over
Stanford's decline from fourth to sixth
place, and it would be unreasonable to
expect the administration to act alone,
defy U.S. News and suffer further
decline in status and alumni anger.
One might ask, then, why the ASSU
Senate recently passed a bill calling for
the administration to withhold data from
the magazine.
The answer to this lies in the penulti
mate clause of the bill — a clause that
stated that the senate should encourage
other campuses to do so as well. At this

point, it would be detrimental to Stanford
to fight U.S. News directly, but our state
ment that we would be willing to do so
were we not acting alone is necessary to
encourage other institutions to adopt
similar policies. This seems to be the
case, for since our resolution passed,
more than 10 other colleges have passed
similar resolutions or have such legisla
tion pending approval by their student
governments.
Thus, to find a solution to this prob
lem we must look beyond Stanford's
walls. If other major universities —
including those treated favorably by the
ratings system — also resist the influence
of U.S. News and all work together to
reform the ratings system, U.S. News
will have to reform its system to avoid a
huge loss in credibility. And we will
achieve this, when we, the university stu
dents accross America, all raise our
hands together.

Joe Freund, a sophomore, is the deputy
chair of the ASSU Senate.
