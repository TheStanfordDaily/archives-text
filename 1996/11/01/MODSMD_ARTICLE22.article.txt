## Stanford hosts cross country Pac-10 Championships 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
After a successful season filled with
victory, the cross country teams will
enter the championship part of the
year as they host the 1996 Pacific 10
Conference Championships tomorrow
at the Stanford Golf Course.
Tomorrow's race will be the 28th
annually for the men, who are current
ly ranked second in the nation, and the
llth-annual Pac-10 Championships
for the No. 3 women.
The men runners will attempt to
capture their first conference title
since 1985. Their most formidable
competition figures to be returning
champion Oregon, who edged the team
last year by five points to take the title.
Tomorrow will be the first opportunity
this season for the Cardinal to meet
the fourth-ranked Ducks.
"That's really a big matchup —
we're obviously the two archrivals in
the Pac-10," said senior Rob Reeder.
"Our main focus is to win a Pac-10
championship, which is something
which has certainly eluded us the num
ber of years I've been here."
Despite the obvious rivalry between
the Cardinal and the Ducks, the Stan
ford team members are intent on
remaining focused on winning the race
themselves and not being concerned
with the performance of others.
"We try not to focus on everyone
else and just focus on ourselves,
because that's basically the only thing
we can control: our own race," said
senior J.J. White. "That's the only way
we're going to find our most effective
strategy."
After finishing sixth and fifth in the
nation in 1994 and 1995, respectively,
the men's team has its best opportuni
ty this season to end its decade-long
drought without a conference title.
"I think everyone's really excited
about |the conference title]," White
said. "I think that's probably what's on
a lot of people's minds. But. . . it's not
the end-all. We're just using it as a
stepping stone toward nationals."
Oregon is led by senior Karl Keska,
who won the individual Pac-10 title
last year with a time of 24 minutes, 14
seconds, the second-fastest time ever
run on the Stanford course. But the
Ducks must run without an inured
Matt Davis, last year's fourth-place
finisher.
Keska, junior Bob Keino of Arizona,
Mebrahtom Keflezighi of UCLA and
Cardinal senior Greg Jimmerson all
figure to win the individual title. Jim
merson finished seventh at last year's
championships but went on to take
fourth in the District VIII race.
Keska, who remains unbeaten this

season, will attempt to become the sev
enth man in conference history to take
back-to-back championships. Keino
finished second last year with the
third-fastest time ever on this course.
Keflezighi finished fifth in individual
competition last season but has
already proven himself on the Cardinal
course by winning this year's Stanford
Invitational.
"I think that we're going to put our
best foot forward and see what hap
pens," said head coach Vin Lananna.
"Oregon will have to defend their title,
but they're going to have to come to
our place to do it. I think that it will be
a close race. Our guys are well pre
pared and should do a good job."
The third-ranked women will
attempt to regain the title they lost to
Oregon last season after garnering
consecutive championships in the 1993
and 1994 competitions. Last year, the
team finished third, one point behind
Arizona and six behind the Ducks, the
closest finish in conference history.
Eleventh-ranked Arizona should be
the toughest opponent for the women,
but they have already had the chance
to meet the Wildcats at the Murray
Keating Cross Country Invitational in
Maine on Oct. 12, where the Cardinal
beat Arizona by 11 points. Arizona is
led by sophomore Amy Skieresz, last
year's champion and course record
holder with a time of 16:45.
"I think [the opportunity to meet
the Wildcats] was good just because we
didn't realize that Arizona was going to
be as strong as they are," said junior
Kortney Dunscombe.
"I think [the victory) gives us a lot
of confidence going into this weekend,"
said junior Sarna Renfro. "We've never
had our full team run together all at
once so this will be really good for us. It
gives us confidence, but it's one of
those things where t he line is the great
equalizer. At the starting line, it's any
body's race."
After losing key runners to gradua
tion and injury, defending champion
Oregon, ranked 20th in the nation,
does not figure to be in the race for the
conference title. No. 18 Washington is
also expected to be strong but probably
will not threaten Stanford or Arizona
for the title.
"They're both good teams, but I
.think lagt Stronger,"
said junior Monal Chokshi. "As
[teams] they just don't have the depth
that we do."
Like the men's, the women's indi
vidual competition also figures to be
close. Stanford sophomore Mary Cobb
will be in contention after her third
place finish last year. Skieresz will try
to become the second women in confer
ence history to win consecutive titles.

UCLA freshman Kim Mortensen will
also be in the hunt after winning the
Stanford Invitational this year in
16:52, the second-fastest time ever on
the Cardinal route.
"Our women are poised for a good
race," Lananna said. "We've been
thinking about this the whole year.

But it's not just Arizona. The Pac-10 is
balanced between Oregon, Washington
and Arizona. All three of them are
actually pretty similar teams. So I
think where one goes the other goes."
The men's 8,000-meter race will
begin at 3:30 p.m., and the women will
race at 4:15 p.m.

annually for the men, who are current
ly ranked second in the nation, and the
llth-annual Pac-10 Championships
for the No. 3 women.
The men runners will attempt to
capture their first conference title
since 1985. Their most formidable
competition figures to be returning
champion Oregon, who edged the team
last year by five points to take the title.
Tomorrow will be the first opportunity
this season for the Cardinal to meet
the fourth-ranked Ducks.
"That's really a big matchup —
we're obviously the two archrivals in
the Pac-10," said senior Rob Reeder.
"Our main focus is to win a Pac-10
championship, which is something
which has certainly eluded us the num
ber of years I've been here."
Despite the obvious rivalry between
the Cardinal and the Ducks, the Stan
ford team members are intent on
remaining focused on winning the race
themselves and not being concerned
with the performance of others.
"We try not to focus on everyone
else and just focus on ourselves,
because that's basically the only thing
we can control: our own race," said
senior J.J. White. "That's the only way
we're going to find our most effective
strategy."
After finishing sixth and fifth in the
nation in 1994 and 1995, respectively,
the men's team has its best opportuni
ty this season to end its decade-long
drought without a conference title.
"I think everyone's really excited
about |the conference title]," White
said. "I think that's probably what's on
a lot of people's minds. But. . . it's not
the end-all. We're just using it as a
stepping stone toward nationals."
Oregon is led by senior Karl Keska,
who won the individual Pac-10 title
last year with a time of 24 minutes, 14
seconds, the second-fastest time ever
run on the Stanford course. But the
Ducks must run without an inured
Matt Davis, last year's fourth-place
finisher.
Keska, junior Bob Keino of Arizona,
Mebrahtom Keflezighi of UCLA and
Cardinal senior Greg Jimmerson all
figure to win the individual title. Jim
merson finished seventh at last year's
championships but went on to take
fourth in the District VIII race.
Keska, who remains unbeaten this

season, will attempt to become the sev
enth man in conference history to take
back-to-back championships. Keino
finished second last year with the
third-fastest time ever on this course.
Keflezighi finished fifth in individual
competition last season but has
already proven himself on the Cardinal
course by winning this year's Stanford
Invitational.
"I think that we're going to put our
best foot forward and see what hap
pens," said head coach Vin Lananna.
"Oregon will have to defend their title,
but they're going to have to come to
our place to do it. I think that it will be
a close race. Our guys are well pre
pared and should do a good job."
The third-ranked women will
attempt to regain the title they lost to
Oregon last season after garnering
consecutive championships in the 1993
and 1994 competitions. Last year, the
team finished third, one point behind
Arizona and six behind the Ducks, the
closest finish in conference history.
Eleventh-ranked Arizona should be
the toughest opponent for the women,
but they have already had the chance
to meet the Wildcats at the Murray
Keating Cross Country Invitational in
Maine on Oct. 12, where the Cardinal
beat Arizona by 11 points. Arizona is
led by sophomore Amy Skieresz, last
year's champion and course record
holder with a time of 16:45.
"I think [the opportunity to meet
the Wildcats] was good just because we
didn't realize that Arizona was going to
be as strong as they are," said junior
Kortney Dunscombe.
"I think [the victory) gives us a lot
of confidence going into this weekend,"
said junior Sarna Renfro. "We've never
had our full team run together all at
once so this will be really good for us. It
gives us confidence, but it's one of
those things where t he line is the great
equalizer. At the starting line, it's any
body's race."
After losing key runners to gradua
tion and injury, defending champion
Oregon, ranked 20th in the nation,
does not figure to be in the race for the
conference title. No. 18 Washington is
also expected to be strong but probably
will not threaten Stanford or Arizona
for the title.
"They're both good teams, but I
.think lagt Stronger,"
said junior Monal Chokshi. "As
[teams] they just don't have the depth
that we do."
Like the men's, the women's indi
vidual competition also figures to be
close. Stanford sophomore Mary Cobb
will be in contention after her third
place finish last year. Skieresz will try
to become the second women in confer
ence history to win consecutive titles.

UCLA freshman Kim Mortensen will
also be in the hunt after winning the
Stanford Invitational this year in
16:52, the second-fastest time ever on
the Cardinal route.
"Our women are poised for a good
race," Lananna said. "We've been
thinking about this the whole year.

But it's not just Arizona. The Pac-10 is
balanced between Oregon, Washington
and Arizona. All three of them are
actually pretty similar teams. So I
think where one goes the other goes."
The men's 8,000-meter race will
begin at 3:30 p.m., and the women will
race at 4:15 p.m.
