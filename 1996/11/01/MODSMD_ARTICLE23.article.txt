# Here's how it works:
## 
### 
The Race
The men's competition will feature
eight teams. The women's race will
feature nine.
The Runners
Each team consists of seven mem
bers. The first five runners from
each team to cross the finish line
garner points for their team.
The Scoring
The points earned by a runner are
equivalent to the overall place that
he or she takes. (For example, first
place earns one point, second place
earns two, etc.)

The Cardinal Runners
Men
Brad Hauser
Brent Hauser
Greg Jimmerson
Jason Lunn
Nathan Nutter
Jason Perscheid
Rob Reeder
J.J. White
Women
Leila Burr
Monal Chokshi
Mary Cobb
Kortney Dunscombe
Jessica Fry
Sally Glynn
Sara Moore
Sarna Renfro
(Seven of the eight on each
list will race tomorrow.)

Displacement
Even though the sixth and seventh
runners on a team do not earn
points, they can still help their
squad by finishing ahead of the
other team's top five runners. By
doing this, they increase the num
ber of points the other runners
earn.
The Winner
The points earned by the top five
runners on a team are added togeth
er to determine the team's score.
The team with the lowest score
wins the meet.
