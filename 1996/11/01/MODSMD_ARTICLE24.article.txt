# Spikers meet match
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
For the first time this year
the No. 4 Stanford women's vol
leyball team (18-2) will enter a
match as the underdog.
The Cardinal will face the
No. 1 team in the nation, the
Hawaii Rainbows (22-0), a
squad that has occupied the top
spot of the polls all season long.
"I hope that we kind of enjoy
it," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "We should go out there
and be a little looser knowing
that we are not the team to
beat."
Stanford will have its hands
full against a Hawaii team load
ed with talent. The Rainbows
bring to the match All-Aineri
can Angela Ljungquist, who
leads the nation in blocks per
game and is fifth in the country
in hitting percentage.
But the Card is not without
its own weapons, with junior

Ail-Americans Lisa Sharpley at
setter and Kristin Folkl at out
side hitter. Folkl and freshman
outside hitter Kerri Walsh have
carried most of the hitting
duties for Stanford this season,
but they only represent the
most prolific hitters on a well
rounded Cardinal squad.
Senior middle blocker Eileen
Murfee and junior middle block
er Barbar" Ifejika have given
the Cardinal a potent and con
sistent offensive and defensive
effort all season. Ifejika is one of
the leaders in the conference in
hitting percentage.
Stanford will also go into the
match with some momentum
after defeating California
Wednesday night.
"We ended the Cal match on
a very positive note," Folkl said.
"It will give us a little extra con
fidence."
