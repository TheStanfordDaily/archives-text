# Spikers meet match
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
For the first time this year
the No. 4 Stanford women's vol
leyball team (18-2) will enter a
match as the underdog.
The Cardinal will face the
No. 1 team in the nation, the
Hawaii Rainbows (22-0), a
squad that has occupied the top
spot of the polls all season long.
"I hope that we kind of enjoy
it," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "We should go out there
and be a little looser knowing
that we are not the team to
beat."
Stanford will have its hands
full against a Hawaii team load
ed with talent. The Rainbows
bring to the match All-Aineri
can Angela Ljungquist, who
leads the nation in blocks per
game and is fifth in the country
in hitting percentage.
But the Card is not without
its own weapons, with junior

Ail-Americans Lisa Sharpley at
setter and Kristin Folkl at out
side hitter. Folkl and freshman
outside hitter Kerri Walsh have
carried most of the hitting
duties for Stanford this season,
but they only represent the
most prolific hitters on a well
rounded Cardinal squad.
Senior middle blocker Eileen
Murfee and junior middle block
er Barbar" Ifejika have given
the Cardinal a potent and con
sistent offensive and defensive
effort all season. Ifejika is one of
the leaders in the conference in
hitting percentage.
Stanford will also go into the
match with some momentum
after defeating California
Wednesday night.
"We ended the Cal match on
a very positive note," Folkl said.
"It will give us a little extra con
fidence."
The match against Hawaii
will likely take place before a capac
ity crowd of more than 10,000 fans
that has waited anxiously for Stan
ford to visit. Although the Card has
consistently played top-25 teams
throughout the 1996 campaign,
Hawaii has played a relatively soft
schedule so far this season. The
Rainbow fans will definitely look
forward to watching two of the best
teams in the country square off.

"They haven't been in any close
matches," Shaw said. "They
haven't really played many great
teams. They haven't played us."
Even the national champi
onship will probably not draw as
many people as Saturday night's
match. The contest against Hawaii
will represent the largest crowd
that Stanford has ever played in
front of. As the underdog, Stanford
will also have something to prove.
"Athletically, we can match up
with anyone in the country," Folkl
said. "We just have to make sure
we are up for it mentally."
