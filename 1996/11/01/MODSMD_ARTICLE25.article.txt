## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Stanford field hockey team
(12-3, 6-1 North Pacific Confer
ence), current leader of the Nor-
Pac, will play its last two home
games of the season this weekend.
UC-Santa Barbara will challenge
the Cardinal squad at 1 p.nv
tomorrow, and UC-Davis will
come to play Stanford at 2 p.m. on
Sunday. Both matches will be held
at the varsity field hockey ground.
The squad returned from an
East Coast trip Sunday, and
according to coach Sheryl John
son, team practices this week have
focused on conditioning Players
are also tightening up offensive
skills such as passing in front of
the goal and executing more cor
ner options to increase scoring

opportunities, Johnson said.
Although a 1-0 loss to James
Madison in the East last Thursday
snapped the team's 10-game win
ning streak — which started in
early September — players are
still fired up and ready to take on
the two UC schools.
"We are very confident about
both of our games this weekend,"
junior midfielder Paige Mader
said. "We are ready to play."
According to senior tri-captain
Baochi Nguyen, the losses have
not affected the team's confidence
level at all.
"If anything, we are more
aggressive attackers (after the
East Coast trip)," Nguyen said.
"We expect to win this weekend,
and we expect to take the NorPac
title."
Coach Sheryl Johnson is confi
dent about the team's ability to
carry through the remaining
games with the skill and power it
has executed throughout the sea
son so far.
"The team knows it's been real
ly successful this year," Johnson
said. The players "know what
we've been doing is still all on
track. The experience we had in the
East was very good for everybody;
it definitely added to our skills and
intensity."
Although UC-Santa Barbara
and UC-Davis are both club teams

and defeating them will not
improve the Card's official record,
players are focused on performing
their best; the Card members have
not let down their guard.
"We usually don't concen
trate so much on our opponent's
skill level," Nguyen said. Accord
ing to Nguyen, the Cardinal pri
marily focuses on its own perfor
mance.
According to Johnson, the Gau
chos have stepped up this year
under their new coach. Both of the
UC teams are aiming to be upgrad
ed to varsity status and are expect
ed to put up a good fight against
the Card.
"It will be much closer [than
we think]," Johnson said. "Davis
has always been a very good
team."
