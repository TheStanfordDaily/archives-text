# Football to take on UCLA tomorrow
## Cardinal hopes to reverse its two-game losing streak 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
On the brink of extinction from
bowl contention, the Stanford foot
ball team looks to rebound from a
disheartening loss last weekend
and a two-game losing streak.
That challenge will occur on the
road at the Rose Bowl where the
Cardinal (2-5, 1-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) will meet UCLA (3-4, 2-2)
in the Bruins' Homecoming game,
its first home game since Oct. 12.
The 3:30 p.m. affair will be tele
vised on fX (STV Channel 45).
The biggest question facing
Stanford head coach Tyrone Will

ingham and his squad coming into
the game involves the quarterback
position. The starter has yet to be
named, due to an injury to starting
quarterback Chad Hutchinson last
week against Arizona State in the
second quarter.
"It all depends on what Chad's
situation is," Willingham said.
"It's the progression, where does
Chad go by the end of the week.
Maybe there are certain things he
can do today, maybe there aren't.
We will factor all those things into
a decision when we figure out what
he can do entirely."
If Hutchinson's sprained right
thumb is not ready to go tomor

row, the Cardinal will go with
backup Todd Husak.
This true freshman made some
noise in the second quarter last
week, engineering an 89-yard
touchdown drive which ended in
his first touchdown pass, a 45-yard
strike to tight end Greg Clark.
Husak filled in admirably in
that quarter, completing nine of
his 13 passes for 100 yards and a
touchdown. Yet two Husak inter
ceptions and no offensive execu
tion allowed the Sun Devils to put
the game awav earlv in the second
half.
"I think when you look at
Todd's play, you had to be very

pleased with how he operated in
the second quarter," Willingham
said. "He stepped right in cold ofT"
the bench and did some very good
things to give our offense some
life."
Regardless of who is taking
snaps for the Cardinal, the Stan*
ford offense must be up for the
challenge of the UCLA defense.
Whether it is a banged-up
Hutchinson or an inexperienced
Ilusak, the Bruins should be bring*
ing eventhing but the kitchen sink
on the pass rush, much like Oregon
State did in recording 11 quarter*
back sacks against Stanford two
weeks ago.
"We don't have a very big defen
sive line," UCLA head coach Bob
Toledo said. "What we are doing is
a lot of blitzing and attacking peo
ple and trying to confuse offensive
blocking schemes."
The Cardinal is expecting that
and will be attempting to turn it
into its advantage.
"If I was their defensive coordi
nator, that would be a strong con
sideration," Willingham said. "But
when you do that, you also open
yourself up for some things to hap
pen. We have to be able to capital
ize on their vulnerability and make
some plays."
The UCLA pass rush registered
seven sacks last week against Cali
fornia, which had only given up
nine total coming into the game.
The Bruins have been extreme
ly impressive against the run this
season, holding four of their seven
opponents to under 80 yards rush
ing. UCLA ranks third in the Pac
-10 in rush defense (116 yards per
game).
In order to take the pressure off
the Stanford playcaller, the Cardi
nal must be effective running the
football. Much of that load will fall
upon the shoulders of senior run

ning back Mike Mitchell, who has
been a bright spot in the Stanford
attack as of late.
In Stanford's last four games,
Mitchell has accounted for 338
yards rushing, 143 yards receiving
and three touchdowns.
On the other side of the ball, it is
the UCLA running game with
which the Cardinal needs to con
cern itself. Junior tailback Skip
Hicks, leading the Pac-10 in scor
ing, has reached the end zone four
more times by himself than the
Cardinal has all season. week,
Hicks piled up 259 all-purpose
yards (146 rushing, 113 receiving)
while scoring four touchdowns.
"Skip is really starting to come
into his own," Toledo said. "He can
do it all. He can run with power, he
has great speed, he can make some
big plays and he is a good receiver
coming out of the backfield. He is
really an all-purpose back."
The Bruins will be looking to
establish Hicks early and often,
especially after last season's con
test in which UCLA tailback Karim
Abdul-Jabbar rushed for 261 yards
on 42 carries.
"I think Skip Hicks is a big con
cern," Willingham said. "He is the
ingredient that has given their
team a chance to be successful. If
you have the luxury of being able to
run it and throw it, that makes you
an extremely potent offense. If we
can take away Hicks' ability to run,
we can put more pressure on their

passing game."
Hicks has provided the
offense with some much-needed
balance and taken the pressure off
sophomore quarterback Cade
McNown. A true freshman last
season, McNown struggled, but he
has since matured into a consistent
performer for the Bruins.
"Last year that was one of our
goals, to exploit him and get on
him," senior Stanford outside
linebacker Brian Batson said. "I
know that even this year he has
struggled at times, but regardless,
in the last few games I think he has
been very productive."
Last week in UCLA's 38-29 win
over Cal, McNown completed 16 of
28 passes for 273 yards and a
touchdown.
The Cardinal will be bringing a
full house defensively as well since
UCLA puts an inexperienced offen
sive line on the field. The Bruins
graduated four of their five start
ing linemen, including first-round
draft pick and Outland Trophy
winner Jonathan Ogden.
The Cardinal is hoping to
exploit UCLA's inexperienced line
in order to stop Hicks and to bring
an effective pass rush.
"They are very similar to us in
that respect," Batson said. "A lot of
teams in the Pac-10 have very
young lines this year. I think we
can do some good things against
them. I think we will definitely run
some stuff at them and try to see

how they pick them up."
The Bruins' sub-.500 record is a
bit deceiving. UCLA's schedule is
considered the toughest in the Pac
-10 and among the most difficult
nationally. The Bruins have
already played four top-25 teams in
seven games, including then-No. 2
Tennessee, No. 4 Arizona State,
then-No. 6 Michigan, and No. 22
Washington. UCLA has also played
five of its seven games away from
the Rose Bowl.
"Our season has been a very dif
ficult one," Toledo said. "We have
one of the toughest schedules in
the nation. We started out with a
very young and inexperienced foot
ball team. After seven games, we're
still a young team but we're gain
ing experience. As a coach, you
would like to win more than what
our record shows, but realistically,
we're probably about where we
thought we'd be."
UCLA has won the past three
contests against the Cardinal and
six of the last nine. The Bruins lead
the overall series 36-27-3.
Despite the disheartening 41-9
performance against the Sun Dev
ils, the Stanford squad is remain
ing optimistic.
"It's not written in stone that
we have to lose the last four
games," sophomore wide receiver
Damon Dunn said. "It's not writ
ten in stone that we have to win
them either, but you have to play
them, so why not win."

"It's not written in stone that
we have to lose the last four
games," sophomore wide receiver
Damon Dunn said. "It's not writ
ten in stone that we have to win
them either, but you have to play
them, so why not win."
On the brink of extinction from
bowl contention, the Stanford foot
ball team looks to rebound from a
disheartening loss last weekend
and a two-game losing streak.
That challenge will occur on the
road at the Rose Bowl where the
Cardinal (2-5, 1-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) will meet UCLA (3-4, 2-2)
in the Bruins' Homecoming game,
its first home game since Oct. 12.
The 3:30 p.m. affair will be tele
vised on fX (STV Channel 45).
The biggest question facing
Stanford head coach Tyrone Will

ingham and his squad coming into
the game involves the quarterback
position. The starter has yet to be
named, due to an injury to starting
quarterback Chad Hutchinson last
week against Arizona State in the
second quarter.
"It all depends on what Chad's
situation is," Willingham said.
"It's the progression, where does
Chad go by the end of the week.
Maybe there are certain things he
can do today, maybe there aren't.
We will factor all those things into
a decision when we figure out what
he can do entirely."
If Hutchinson's sprained right
thumb is not ready to go tomor

row, the Cardinal will go with
backup Todd Husak.
This true freshman made some
noise in the second quarter last
week, engineering an 89-yard
touchdown drive which ended in
his first touchdown pass, a 45-yard
strike to tight end Greg Clark.
Husak filled in admirably in
that quarter, completing nine of
his 13 passes for 100 yards and a
touchdown. Yet two Husak inter
ceptions and no offensive execu
tion allowed the Sun Devils to put
the game awav earlv in the second
half.
"I think when you look at
Todd's play, you had to be very

pleased with how he operated in
the second quarter," Willingham
said. "He stepped right in cold ofT"
the bench and did some very good
things to give our offense some
life."
Regardless of who is taking
snaps for the Cardinal, the Stan*
ford offense must be up for the
challenge of the UCLA defense.
Whether it is a banged-up
Hutchinson or an inexperienced
Ilusak, the Bruins should be bring*
ing eventhing but the kitchen sink
on the pass rush, much like Oregon
State did in recording 11 quarter*
back sacks against Stanford two
weeks ago.
"We don't have a very big defen
sive line," UCLA head coach Bob
Toledo said. "What we are doing is
a lot of blitzing and attacking peo
ple and trying to confuse offensive
blocking schemes."
The Cardinal is expecting that
and will be attempting to turn it
into its advantage.
"If I was their defensive coordi
nator, that would be a strong con
sideration," Willingham said. "But
when you do that, you also open
yourself up for some things to hap
pen. We have to be able to capital
ize on their vulnerability and make
some plays."
The UCLA pass rush registered
seven sacks last week against Cali
fornia, which had only given up
nine total coming into the game.
The Bruins have been extreme
ly impressive against the run this
season, holding four of their seven
opponents to under 80 yards rush
ing. UCLA ranks third in the Pac
-10 in rush defense (116 yards per
game).
In order to take the pressure off
the Stanford playcaller, the Cardi
nal must be effective running the
football. Much of that load will fall
upon the shoulders of senior run

ning back Mike Mitchell, who has
been a bright spot in the Stanford
attack as of late.
In Stanford's last four games,
Mitchell has accounted for 338
yards rushing, 143 yards receiving
and three touchdowns.
On the other side of the ball, it is
the UCLA running game with
which the Cardinal needs to con
cern itself. Junior tailback Skip
Hicks, leading the Pac-10 in scor
ing, has reached the end zone four
more times by himself than the
Cardinal has all season. week,
Hicks piled up 259 all-purpose
yards (146 rushing, 113 receiving)
while scoring four touchdowns.
"Skip is really starting to come
into his own," Toledo said. "He can
do it all. He can run with power, he
has great speed, he can make some
big plays and he is a good receiver
coming out of the backfield. He is
really an all-purpose back."
The Bruins will be looking to
establish Hicks early and often,
especially after last season's con
test in which UCLA tailback Karim
Abdul-Jabbar rushed for 261 yards
on 42 carries.
"I think Skip Hicks is a big con
cern," Willingham said. "He is the
ingredient that has given their
team a chance to be successful. If
you have the luxury of being able to
run it and throw it, that makes you
an extremely potent offense. If we
can take away Hicks' ability to run,
we can put more pressure on their

passing game."
Hicks has provided the
offense with some much-needed
balance and taken the pressure off
sophomore quarterback Cade
McNown. A true freshman last
season, McNown struggled, but he
has since matured into a consistent
performer for the Bruins.
"Last year that was one of our
goals, to exploit him and get on
him," senior Stanford outside
linebacker Brian Batson said. "I
know that even this year he has
struggled at times, but regardless,
in the last few games I think he has
been very productive."
Last week in UCLA's 38-29 win
over Cal, McNown completed 16 of
28 passes for 273 yards and a
touchdown.
The Cardinal will be bringing a
full house defensively as well since
UCLA puts an inexperienced offen
sive line on the field. The Bruins
graduated four of their five start
ing linemen, including first-round
draft pick and Outland Trophy
winner Jonathan Ogden.
The Cardinal is hoping to
exploit UCLA's inexperienced line
in order to stop Hicks and to bring
an effective pass rush.
"They are very similar to us in
that respect," Batson said. "A lot of
teams in the Pac-10 have very
young lines this year. I think we
can do some good things against
them. I think we will definitely run
some stuff at them and try to see

how they pick them up."
The Bruins' sub-.500 record is a
bit deceiving. UCLA's schedule is
considered the toughest in the Pac
-10 and among the most difficult
nationally. The Bruins have
already played four top-25 teams in
seven games, including then-No. 2
Tennessee, No. 4 Arizona State,
then-No. 6 Michigan, and No. 22
Washington. UCLA has also played
five of its seven games away from
the Rose Bowl.
"Our season has been a very dif
ficult one," Toledo said. "We have
one of the toughest schedules in
the nation. We started out with a
very young and inexperienced foot
ball team. After seven games, we're
still a young team but we're gain
ing experience. As a coach, you
would like to win more than what
our record shows, but realistically,
we're probably about where we
thought we'd be."
UCLA has won the past three
contests against the Cardinal and
six of the last nine. The Bruins lead
the overall series 36-27-3.
Despite the disheartening 41-9
performance against the Sun Dev
ils, the Stanford squad is remain
ing optimistic.
"It's not written in stone that
we have to lose the last four
games," sophomore wide receiver
Damon Dunn said. "It's not writ
ten in stone that we have to win
them either, but you have to play
them, so why not win."
