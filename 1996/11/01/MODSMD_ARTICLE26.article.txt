# Football to take on UCLA tomorrow
## Cardinal hopes to reverse its two-game losing streak 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
On the brink of extinction from
bowl contention, the Stanford foot
ball team looks to rebound from a
disheartening loss last weekend
and a two-game losing streak.
That challenge will occur on the
road at the Rose Bowl where the
Cardinal (2-5, 1-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) will meet UCLA (3-4, 2-2)
in the Bruins' Homecoming game,
its first home game since Oct. 12.
The 3:30 p.m. affair will be tele
vised on fX (STV Channel 45).
The biggest question facing
Stanford head coach Tyrone Will

ingham and his squad coming into
the game involves the quarterback
position. The starter has yet to be
named, due to an injury to starting
quarterback Chad Hutchinson last
week against Arizona State in the
second quarter.
"It all depends on what Chad's
situation is," Willingham said.
"It's the progression, where does
Chad go by the end of the week.
Maybe there are certain things he
can do today, maybe there aren't.
We will factor all those things into
a decision when we figure out what
he can do entirely."
If Hutchinson's sprained right
thumb is not ready to go tomor

row, the Cardinal will go with
backup Todd Husak.
This true freshman made some
noise in the second quarter last
week, engineering an 89-yard
touchdown drive which ended in
his first touchdown pass, a 45-yard
strike to tight end Greg Clark.
Husak filled in admirably in
that quarter, completing nine of
his 13 passes for 100 yards and a
touchdown. Yet two Husak inter
ceptions and no offensive execu
tion allowed the Sun Devils to put
the game awav earlv in the second
half.
"I think when you look at
Todd's play, you had to be very

pleased with how he operated in
the second quarter," Willingham
said. "He stepped right in cold ofT"
the bench and did some very good
things to give our offense some
life."
Regardless of who is taking
snaps for the Cardinal, the Stan*
ford offense must be up for the
challenge of the UCLA defense.
Whether it is a banged-up
Hutchinson or an inexperienced
Ilusak, the Bruins should be bring*
ing eventhing but the kitchen sink
on the pass rush, much like Oregon
State did in recording 11 quarter*
