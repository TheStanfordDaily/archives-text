# Water polo team anticipates big weekend
## 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
This weekend represents the
turning point of the season for
the 1996 Stanford men's water
polo team, as it faces Pepper
dine today, No. 2 UCLA tomor
row and top-ranked USC on
Sunday.
The No. 3 Cardinal (14-4, 3-1
Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation) knocked off Pepperdine
in their two meetings earlier in
the season, but only today's
contest counts toward the all
important conference stand
ings.
"We've beaten them already
two times this year," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti. "But
because it's a conference game,
we have to be very careful not to
look ahead to UCLA "
While the Card remains
focused on Pepperdine, it's diffi
cult not to look forward to
tomorrow's matchup The battle
with UCIxA represents the sin
gle most important game for the
Cardinal, as it too counts toward
the conference standings.

ranked No. 2 and No. 3, respec

teams at the conclusion of the
season go to the NCAA Champi
onships in San Diego, the Card
has the opportunity to gain
excellent seeding with a win.
UCLA has defeated Stan
ford's squad in both meetings
thus far, 9-6 in the Northern
California Tournament and last
weekend 7-6 in an amazing
comeback at deGuerre Pool.
Both times the outcome of the
game was determined by execu
tion errors upon which UCLA
capitalized.
In tomorrow's game, the Card
hopes to bring it all together.
"We have spent this week
concentrating on UCLA," Detta
manti said. "We have been
focusing on the two things that
really let us down last weekend,
our 6-5 offense and our defense

against the counterattack."
In last week's game with the
Bruins, the Card held a 6-4 lead
with just 2 minutes remaining
before UCLA stormed back to
score on three consecutive pos
sessions. So despite the loss, the
squad members proved that they
can defeat UCLA if they can
limit their errors.
"We did a good job defensively
against them last weekend,"
Dettamanti said. "We have to
continue to play the same kind
of defense and minimize our
turnovers and mistakes. If we
can execute in the defensive en d
while taking better shots on
offense, we can definitely win."
While the UCLA game is the
focal point of the weekend for
the Card, Sunday's contest
against the USC represents an
excellent opportunity. It is the
team's first chance to play the
top-ranked team in the country,
but it is a nonconference game.
The team members can put their

strategies to the test, learn what
approach USC will take to stop
ping the Stanford offense and
simply adjust to a playing style
they haven't seen without
putting the season on the line.
"We cannot worry ourselves
with our game with USC," Det
tamanti said. "After back-to
back conference games, we're
just going to do the best we can."
Indeed, with the conference
game against USC being played
next week at Stanford, the Car
dinal will have plenty of time to
recover and to re-evaluate before
they meet again.
The contests mark a chal
lenge for Stanford, and the team
members look to them with con
fidence and enthusiasm.
"Being third is just as good as
being fifth," said senior Daniel
Lehoczkv. "We have proven that
we can play with the top two
teams. Now we have to make the
next step — show that we are
one of those two."
