So you missed the intense
debate Monday between the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and
Dinesh D'Souza in Memorial Audi
torium over Proposition 209? No
problem. It was merely a warmup
session for the true clash of these
two ideological titans.
Politics and ideologies aside —
today, Jackson and D'Souza butt
heads in a battle of picks instead of
wits, where they put forth their
sports predictions instead of their
social prescriptions.
Keep reading, no matter who
you are, because there are no bind
ing racial quotas or affirmative
action policies at work to stop you
from perusing this week's NCAA
football picks.
Oh, and please, hold your
applause and hisses until the end
of the debate.
Stanford at UCLA
A few Doubting Thomases out
there have interrogated me recent
ly about the validity of this column.
"Do you really interview those peo
ple?" they ask. To set your frisky
minds at ease, of course I do. If I
was simply making up the words
and opinions of people, I'd be fight
ing libel lawsuits left and right.

Although I'm not legally culpa
ble for the contents of this column,
I am socially and reputation ally
liable. I've made some gains on my
opponents in the past few weeks (it
is clear that political candidacy for
president and college football don't
mix well), and I hope that by the
end of the season I will have sur
passed them in overall prognosti
cating proficiency. But my oppo
nents this week are skilled debaters
and crafty in confrontations.
If I agree with anything Jesse
says, it is that UCLA is going to
beat Stanford tomorrow in the
Rose Bowl. Assuming Jesse's picks
are as full of truth as his speeches
are full of symbolism and rhetoric,
there's no way the Bruins can lose.
As much as I hate to say it, this
could be the worst Stanford foot
ball squad in a decade. While the
defense still has potential, even its
consistency has slacked off consid
erably in the past few weeks. With
out the ability to score points
against most teams, Stanford has
saddled its defense with burdens
even Atlas couldn't shoulder. The
result is a streaky Cardinal squad
that Jesse (who played football on
scholarship in college) doesn't
think has Holyfield's chance

against Tyson to beat UCLA.
Brushing aside the fact that he
admittedly doesn't know the first
thing about college football, Dinesh
is siding with the Cardinal. I guess
he doesn't want to get the natives
restless by predicting the only
rational outcome.

Arizona at California
Yech. Stomaching this game is
going to be like drinking curdled
milk and eating raw beef while
watching Roseanne do toe-touches
in a tutu. Both the Wildcats and
the Golden Bears are sorry, and the
winner won't have much to brag
about at dinner tomorrow.
For the first time in history,
Jesse and Dinesh actually agree on
something — an Arizona victory.
Who knows, maybe this is the
beginning of an emotional reconcil
iation between these two politicos.
I doubt it. I'm dubious about
Arizona's prospects at Cal. As sad
as I think Cal is, the Wildcats stink
a bit more, especially in Berkeley
(of course, everybody stinks more


Jesse
Jackson


Reagan
Demas


Dinesh
D'Souza
in Berkeley; it's that renowned
personal hygiene problem).
I feel a bit uncouth going
against Jesse's intuition. Jesse told
me he was invited to give a pre
game pep talk to the Wisconsin
squad last year before its huge
game against Ohio State. The Bad
gers actually won.
Moral of the story? Not much.
Jesse was invited back before the
Ohio State contest this year and
graciously accepted. But Wisconsin
lost and has managed only three
wins all season. Go figure.

Washington at USC
The Huskies ran down Oregon's
throat last week in a deadly perfor
mance that left the taste of cyanide

lingering in the Ducks' mouths.
Washington's Corey Dillon alone
racked up 259 yards in a ground
operation that made Normandy
look like a stroll on the beach.
The Trojans barely returned to
sunny Los Angeles with a win at
frigid Washington State last week.
Dinesh thinks, once again, that the
Trojans of yore will show up in
Memorial Coliseum tomorrow.
Jesse and I both think the Tro
jans of today will make an appear
ance, which will likely doom USC's
chances of emerging victorious.
Jesse: Washington by 6
Dinesh: USC by 3
Me: Washington by 13
Northwestern at Penn State
I haven't found the verse in the
Bible where it says the Lord
promised to look down upon the
Northwestern football team at all
times until He comes again. But
let's face it, Northwestern has the
Divine on its side. The Wildcats are
7-1, but they have won their last

four games by a combined 10
points and could easily be 4-4.
"That's a really great academic
institution, and in the past few
years they have also fielded a great
football team," Jesse said. "You've
got to love that."
If Jesse's approach to the
dynamics of this game could be
considered liberal, then Dinesh, in
his typical conservative fashion, is
sticking on the side of history. He's
picking the traditional football
powerhouse in Penn State over the
new blossoms from Evanston.
I'm going with the "right" side
on this one; that is, both the con
servative and the correct choice.

is clear that political candidacy for
president and college football don't
mix well), and I hope that by the
end of the season I will have sur
passed them in overall prognosti
cating proficiency. But my oppo
nents this week are skilled debaters
and crafty in confrontations.
If I agree with anything Jesse
says, it is that UCLA is going to
beat Stanford tomorrow in the
Rose Bowl. Assuming Jesse's picks
are as full of truth as his speeches
are full of symbolism and rhetoric,
there's no way the Bruins can lose.
As much as I hate to say it, this
could be the worst Stanford foot
ball squad in a decade. While the
defense still has potential, even its
consistency has slacked off consid
erably in the past few weeks. With
out the ability to score points
against most teams, Stanford has
saddled its defense with burdens
even Atlas couldn't shoulder. The
result is a streaky Cardinal squad
that Jesse (who played football on
scholarship in college) doesn't
think has Holyfield's chance

against Tyson to beat UCLA.
Brushing aside the fact that he
admittedly doesn't know the first
thing about college football, Dinesh
is siding with the Cardinal. I guess
he doesn't want to get the natives
restless by predicting the only
rational outcome.

Arizona at California
Yech. Stomaching this game is
going to be like drinking curdled
milk and eating raw beef while
watching Roseanne do toe-touches
in a tutu. Both the Wildcats and
the Golden Bears are sorry, and the
winner won't have much to brag
about at dinner tomorrow.
For the first time in history,
Jesse and Dinesh actually agree on
something — an Arizona victory.
Who knows, maybe this is the
beginning of an emotional reconcil
iation between these two politicos.
I doubt it. I'm dubious about
Arizona's prospects at Cal. As sad
as I think Cal is, the Wildcats stink
a bit more, especially in Berkeley
(of course, everybody stinks more

in Berkeley; it's that renowned
personal hygiene problem).
I feel a bit uncouth going
against Jesse's intuition. Jesse told
me he was invited to give a pre
game pep talk to the Wisconsin
squad last year before its huge
game against Ohio State. The Bad
gers actually won.
Moral of the story? Not much.
Jesse was invited back before the
Ohio State contest this year and
graciously accepted. But Wisconsin
lost and has managed only three
wins all season. Go figure.

Washington at USC
The Huskies ran down Oregon's
throat last week in a deadly perfor
mance that left the taste of cyanide

lingering in the Ducks' mouths.
Washington's Corey Dillon alone
racked up 259 yards in a ground
operation that made Normandy
look like a stroll on the beach.
The Trojans barely returned to
sunny Los Angeles with a win at
frigid Washington State last week.
Dinesh thinks, once again, that the
Trojans of yore will show up in
Memorial Coliseum tomorrow.
Jesse and I both think the Tro
jans of today will make an appear
ance, which will likely doom USC's
chances of emerging victorious.

Northwestern at Penn State
I haven't found the verse in the
Bible where it says the Lord
promised to look down upon the
Northwestern football team at all
times until He comes again. But
let's face it, Northwestern has the
Divine on its side. The Wildcats are
7-1, but they have won their last

four games by a combined 10
points and could easily be 4-4.
"That's a really great academic
institution, and in the past few
years they have also fielded a great
football team," Jesse said. "You've
got to love that."
If Jesse's approach to the
dynamics of this game could be
considered liberal, then Dinesh, in
his typical conservative fashion, is
sticking on the side of history. He's
picking the traditional football
powerhouse in Penn State over the
new blossoms from Evanston.
I'm going with the "right" side
on this one; that is, both the con
servative and the correct choice.
