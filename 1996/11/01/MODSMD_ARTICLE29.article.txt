# Women's soccer hopes to stay strong in Los Angeles
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Coming oft' its most successful
weekend of the year, the Stanford
women's soccer team (9-7, 4-0
Pacific 10 Conference) heads
south for Los Angeles this week
end to clash with league rivals
USC and UCLA.
The Cardinal is unbeaten in
the conference with only three
Pac-10 matches remaining on its
schedule (this weekend's bouts
and California on Nov. 10). All
other teams in the conference
have at least two losses, so if Stan
ford can sweep this weekend, it
will assure itself the conference
championship and, more impor
tantly, a berth into the NCAA
tournament.
"Winning the Pac-10 has been
our goal from the very beginning
of the season," said Cardinal coach
Steve Swanson. "Any time you're
in a league as good as our confer
ence is, you have to focus on win
ning it game by game."
Stanford has played its best
soccer when it has counted most
so far this season, in Pac-10 play.
Last weekend Stanford knocked
off Washington 3-1 and Washing
ton State 1-0 in overtime in two
crucial, must-win games.
"I think we've finally got some

momentum," Swanson said. "We
persevered against Washington
State and for once got a good
result. Then on Sunday (against
Washington), we put together
maybe our best game of the sea
son. We moved the ball quite welJ,
scored early and gained confidence
throughout the game. If we can
put that kind of effort together
this weekend, I think we'll be
pleased with the results."
Last year, the Cardinal defeat
ed both the Women of Troy and
the Bruins on its way to an unde
feated Pac-10 season. Both USC
(4-2 Pac-10) and UCLA (3-2 Pac
-10) still have a shot at the confer
ence championship and probably
need the crown if they are to
make it to the postseason. With
so much on the line, Stanford can
expect two very emotional and
intense games in Los Angeles.
Swanson thinks his team is
ready for the challenge. "Good
teams go through tough stretches
sometimes," said Swanson, refer
ring to a span over which the Car
dinal lost four of five games. "I'm
really proud of how positive we
have stayed through it all and how
hard we keep playing. It would
have been easy to get down, but
this team has never done that."
Indeed, Stanford has had many
reasons to be frustrated. Injuries

have plagued Stanford all season
long. Sophomore Kelly Adamson,
an All-Pac-10 selection as a fresh
man, has been out for the season
due to knee surgery, and fresh
man Ronnie Fair, who had been
starting at sweeper, hurt her
ankle in the Washington State
game and will miss the rest of the
season as well.
In addition, for a period of
about five or six games, Stanford
consistently outplayed its oppo
nents, but for some reason was
unable to finish off any of its
opportunities and as a result lost a
few games which it could have eas
ily pulled out.
"I feel like we're finally moving
in the right direction," said junior
midfielder Elie Foster. "When you
get things going well and start
scoring, everything seems to click
a little better."
Right now, Swanson just
wants his team to keep clicking.
"We know what we have to do
[today] against USC and Sunday
against UCLA," he said. "We
need to impose our style of play
on our opponents, we need to
come out strong and hopefully
put in an early goal. We've got to
win some tackles, control the air
balls and maintain possession on
offense. We're ready to do that,
and I'm looking forward to it."
