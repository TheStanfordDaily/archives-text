Early applications for admis
sion to Stanford must be post
marked by today. Katie Nelson, a
senior at Richard Montgomery
High School in Silver Spring, Md.,
is almost certain that Stanford is
her first choice, yet her applica
tion is not among the 1,000 or so
that will arrive over the next few
days at Old Union. The reasons
for this absence, according to
Katie, are entirely financial.
"Even if I know Stanford is my
first choice and I want to go there,
I can't apply," Katie said. Because
early acceptances from Stanford
are now binding, if Katie were ac
cepted but received an inadequate
financial aid package, she would
be trapped with nowhere at all to
go.
"Everyone I know is applying
early somewhere. It scares me be

cause they'll have everything set
in a month, and I won't," Katie
said. Although some of her high
school classmates will need finan
cial aid, "Their parents have told
them, 'We'll pay if you get in.' My
parents can't do that."
While Katie's peers apply early
to various colleges and universi
ties, she is waiting for regular ad
mission deadlines, when she will
apply to eight schools. She antici
pates that at least one will provide
sufficient financial aid. However,
she is aware that by waiting, she
might be hurting her chances of
acceptance at Stanford. Last year
Stanford accepted more than 300
students early, for a class that
would total about 1,600.
"You have a much better
chance of getting in applying

early, and I know people from my
class will apply (to Stanford), and
a school will only take a certain
number of students from my
school. My chances are de
creased," Katie said.
Katie is not the only one
wrestling with this paradox.
"It's incredibly frustrating all
the way around," said her father,
John Nelson.
John works as a parent in
volvement specialist in the public
school system and is an English as
a second language instructor at
the University of Maryland.
Katie's mother, Susan, is self-em
ployed as a craftsperson of chil
dren's clothes and is also an ad
ministrator and aerobics teacher
at the YMCA. Katie is their only
child.
John said he finds the applica
tion process both confusing and
exciting. "You don't know what
you're shopping for, you don't
know where Katie will be accept
ed, you don't know what Katie
will like and you still don't know if
you can afford it. It's outrageous
ly expensive.
"You're making one of the
biggest investments of your life,
and you don't know where you
stand. On the other hand, it's fun
to visit the schools. The facilities
are amazing, especially at small
schools."
John said one place that partic
ularly impressed him was David
son College in Davidson, N.C.
"They have a sports facility the
