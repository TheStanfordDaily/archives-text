# Random dialogue from a Halloween party
## 
### 
Our hero, dressed for the costume party
as a really cool-looking Zombie, takes a
beer from the fridge and heads toward
a dark room illuminated by black lights.
Inside he spots a small group standing near a
lantern.
Praying Mantis: Well Freud fails to take
into account a will to feebleness that, left
unexpressed, compels the neurotic into com
puter science.
Werewolf: Yes, that's true. But you have
to agree with Jung. Jung is right, he says . . .
Unsatisfied, our protagonist Zombie turns
abruptly and leaves the room. Soon he comes
upon an enclave decorated with blue Christ
inas wrapping paper folded into the shape of a
donkey corpse. Before him is a young group of
girls dressed as Brownies. One girl, apparent
ly the leader of the troop, begins to chant.
Leader of Brownies: Serpents . . . spi
ders . . . tale of a rat . . . awaken the spirits,
wherever they're at. Goblins and ghoulies
from last Halloween, awaken the spirits with
your tambourine!
Brownies (eyes closed, fingers dangling

toward center, chanting in unison): Yes lead
er, yes . . . you are our leader . . . and we'll fol
low you — your will is best.
Zombie (interrupting circle): This party is
stupid! Hey everyone, (turns toward crowd)
I .ft s Party!!
Crowd in room: Yeaaahhh! (loud cheers
and applause) Hoot, there it is! Hoot hoot,
there it is! PARTY in the pants, PA-PA
PARTY in the pants!
Encouraged, our protagonist Zombie leaves
the room and heads toward a bathroom. The
bathroom, illuminated by only a neon green
light and incense burner, is shaped like an
rusty old toenail. Undeterred, Zombie finishes
his business and heads back into the living
room where he encounters a bird of prey and
a tree by product.
Eagle on Fire: Hey man, your costume is
really dumb, (laughing between coughs)
Index Card: Yeah, it's stu-u-pid! (looks
over at Eagle on Fire while laughing)
Eagle on Fire: I bet your mother is a
dumb woman and she is ugly also.
Index Card: She's stupid and you're

stupid! Yeah, (stares at Zombie and raises
clinched fist)
Eagle on Fire: You're both dumb and
you're stupid, (pointing index finger)
Index Card: Yeah.
Zombie: You people are crazy and weird. I
don't like it here. I'm leaving!
Zombie (lees the party. On the way back to
his dorm his bike is snarled in traffic caused
by a raccoon corpse lying in the road. Zombie
gains perspective, sobers up and promises to
fight crime, vote and give to homeless shelters
when he's old.
The End.
