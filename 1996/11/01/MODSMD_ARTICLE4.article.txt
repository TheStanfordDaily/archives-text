# Polls show 209's gap is narrowing

With Election
Day right around
the corner, a new
Field Poll re
leased Wednes
day showed that
Proposition 209
has finally be
come a true con
test.

The recent study indicates that
the ballot measure's lead has dwin
dled from the 15 points it savored in
early October to a mere five points.
The tightening race reflects the
newfound attention devoted to the
affirmative action issue in the pres
idential race. Until fairly recently,
the measure has received little at
tention, but now Republican presi
dential candidate Bob Dole — and a
pro-209 television ad featuring
Martin Luther King, Jr. — havt

96
VOTE

brought the issue to the fore
ground.
While President Bill Clinton has
said that he is against the initiative,
he has avoided making the issue a
prominent one in his campaign.
With Dole trailing by only 10 points
in California, Clinton does not want
to run the risk of alienating voters.
The survey also found that vot
ers' stands on the measure are
closely linked to presidential choice.
Dole endorses the initiative; Clin
ton opposes it. If Clinton did choose
to divert political capital into fight
ing Prop 209, it would make a sig
nificant difference, the study indi
cates.
Opponents have suggested that
the complexity of the proposition's
wording ha* contributed to much
voter confusion and subsequent
support for the measure, which
they contend would put an end to
useful affirmative action programs.
Proponents believe the measure
will end unfair racial and gender
preferences.
In the past two years, 17 states
have had similar propositions on the
ballot and nine bills similar in con
tent have gone before Congress.
None have passed.
The text of the California proposi
tion states: "The state shall not dis
criminate against, or grant preferen
tial treatment to, any individual or
group on the basis of race, sex, color,
ethnicity, or national origin in the
operation of public employment,
public education, or public contract
ing."
Worded much like the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, the measure
would affect areas of public employ
ment, public education and public
contracting.
Specific programs affected would
depend largely on existing federal
law and future court rulings defin
ing "preferential treatment."
Affirmative action
Affirmative action has its roots in
the civil rights movements of the
19605, which produced the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
Government-mandated affirma
tive action began in 1965 with an ex
ecutive order issued by President
Lyndon Johnson that required fed
eral contractors to conduct affirma
tive action programs to increase the
number of minorities that they em
ployed.
In 1969, President Nixon intro
duced a system of "goals and timeta
bles" to evaluate federal construc
tion companies, and President Ford
extended affirmative action to peo
ple with disabilities and Vietnam
veterans.
President Carter created the Of
fice of Federal Contract Compliance
Programs in 1978 to assess compli
ance with affirmative action policies.
Affirmative action does not just
constitute preferences in hiring and
promotion. It also encompasses
scholarship, tutoring, outreach and
mentoring programs aimed at mi
nority groups, including women. Ad
vocates of Prop. 209 say this mea
sure will not affect these programs,
but only those that show evidence of
"reverse discrimination."
Opponents argue that court rul
ings will have to determine what
types of activities are considered re

verse discrimination. Specific chal
lenges to the initiative may clog up
the courts considerably.
However, legal experts are al
ready cautioning voters that the ac
tual effects of Prop. 209 will not be
known until its constitutionality is
tested in the courts. Like Proposi
tion 187, which was passed two years
ago but has yet to go into effect as
court battles proceed, this could be
stuck in court for years.
Some proponents also say that
quotas, preferences and set-asides
imposed by affirmative action pro
grams are unfair. They argue that
not all minorities or women are nec
essarily disadvantaged. However, es
tablished quotas do not exist; they
were found unconstitutional in the
1978Bakkevs. University of Califor
nia Regents decision.
Many fighting against Prop. 209
believe that affirmative action is not
"preferential treatment," but an ef
fective way to increase opportunities
for women and members of minority
groups. They say affirmative action
programs are necessary to fight in
stitutional racism.
Student action
The media has portrayed the ini
tiative as largely a partisan issue, po
larizing voters along the party-line
spectrum. Sophomore Jonathan
Russell, College Republicans presi
dent, said, "It is upsetting that the
discourse concerning Proposition
209 has been forced into the realm of
politics because it is not a partisan
issue. Women Eire split, as are minor
ity groups and liberals."
Other students on campus feel
likewise. A group called Save The
Dream was formed at the beginning
of the year to fight the initiative.
Freshman Thomas Soule, an active
member, said the initiative was "di
visive" and a ploy by the state to " not
talk about issues by putting the
blame (for economic problems) on
certain sectors of America."
The group has scheduled a walk
out of classes at 11:30 a.m. Monday
to protest the measure. Soule recog
nized the potential comparison that
may be drawn to the protests two
years ago against Prop. 187.
"One thing we want to do with
our walkout is to bring people to
gether," Soule said. "We don't expect
to use inflammatory remarks. We're
not out to alienate voters. If we
wanted to do that, we might as well
stay home.
"Divisive tactics just don't work,"
he added. "They don't work in life.
They don't work in politics."

Russell does not see the measure
as a scapegoating mechanism, but
an effective step toward a more just
society. "If 209 passes, [eventually]
reverse racism will be done away
with and alternative programs that
go to the heart of the program will be
enacted at all levels," he said.
"I think we will reach Martin L.
King's dream much faster than
would ever be thought possible
under the present system," he
added.
Stanford faculty
As a government contractor,
Stanford is required under federal
law to have an affirmative action
plan. It employs goals and timetables
in the hiring and recruitment of fac
ulty.
"Departments are encouraged
and required to make extra efforts to
identify outstanding minority and
women candidates" for faculty posi
tions, said Law Prof. Robert Weis
berg, vice provost for faculty recruit
ment and retention. "Extra re
sources are provided to make that
more feasible."
However, affirmative action is
"voluntary" in the admissions
process, meaning that it is not man
dated by the government. If Prop.
209 is ever implemented, it will have
no direct effect on the University,
since it is a private institution.
However, according to the Office
of Multicultural Development Direc
tor Saliy Dickson, "In terms of cli
mate and how the issue is being de
bated ... 209 is a real wedge issue. I
don't think it will help at all in terms
of race relations. It doesn't address
the issue of unequal opportunity."
University President Gerhard
Casper delivered a speech to the Fac
ulty Senate last fall, stating his en
dorsement of affirmative action.
"Barriers continue to exist in so
ciety, and therefore affirmative ac
tion asks us to cast our net more
widely to broaden the competition
and to engage in more active efforts
for locating and recruiting appli
cants," he said.
Dickson vouches for the effective
ness of affirmative action. "If you
look back 20 years, Stanford, in
terms of diversity of population, was
nowhere near where it is today," she
said. The University now has 30 per
cent minority faculty members.
"What affirmative action pro
vides is an opportunity for talented
people who may not have had the ac
cess to such opportunities," she
added. "It makes employers really
aware of talent among other

groups."
Many students complain of "mul
ticultural" overload. The Universi
ty's apparent preoccupation with
"valuing diversity" often turns peo
ple off. However, Prop. 209 pushes
the discourse on this issue to take
center stage.
"I think students will lose most of
all" without affirmative action,
Dickson said. In a global economy,
having a diverse college community
"really enriches the whole academic
experience of students," she said.
Stanford admissions
Affirmative action in the under
graduate admissions process, as ac
cording to the selection criteria ap
proved by the senate in 1986, gives
"special consideration" to African
Americans, Mexican Americans, Na
tive Americans and children of Stan
ford alumni, faculty and staff.
However, they must "meet basic
requirements of academic excellence
and personal achievement." The De
partment of Athletics may also "des
ignate outstanding athletes for spe
cial attention." The policy does not
address the issue of gender.
"What is important to note here is
that there are no quotas, and all stu
dents meet the University's stan
dard of excellence," said James Mon
toya, dean of undergraduate admis
sion and financial aids.
"We certainly do our best to be
sensitive to individual circum
stances that may have had an impact
on their academic record in sec
ondary school," hp added.
The greatest impact that affirma
tive action programs have on the ad
missions process, said Montoya, is in
his office's recruitment efforts. The
West Coast setting of the campus
also works to diversify the pool.
"Once you have a diverse applicant
pool, one is able to focus on individu
als," he said.
"Given my philosophy that a di
verse student body enhances the ed
ucational environment, I think we
all benefit" from affirmative action,
Montoya said.
In the end, a citizen's vote may
not be determined so much by one's
belief in whether the current system
of affirmative action is effective or
fair, but by the assessment of what
the social climate resulting from the
passage of Prop. 209 will be: either a
state that no longer practices unfair
preferences, or a state that no longer
has a program to increase opportu
nities for any group, regardless of
race, gender or socio-economic sta
tus.
