With Election
Day right around
the corner, a new
Field Poll re
leased Wednes
day showed that
Proposition 209
has finally be
come a true con
test.

The recent study indicates that
the ballot measure's lead has dwin
dled from the 15 points it savored in
early October to a mere five points.
The tightening race reflects the
newfound attention devoted to the
affirmative action issue in the pres
idential race. Until fairly recently,
the measure has received little at
tention, but now Republican presi
dential candidate Bob Dole — and a
pro-209 television ad featuring
Martin Luther King, Jr. — havt

brought the issue to the fore
ground.
While President Bill Clinton has
said that he is against the initiative,
he has avoided making the issue a
prominent one in his campaign.
With Dole trailing by only 10 points
in California, Clinton does not want
to run the risk of alienating voters.
The survey also found that vot
ers' stands on the measure are
closely linked to presidential choice.
Dole endorses the initiative; Clin
ton opposes it. If Clinton did choose
to divert political capital into fight
ing Prop 209, it would make a sig
nificant difference, the study indi
cates.
Opponents have suggested that
the complexity of the proposition's
wording ha* contributed to much
voter confusion and subsequent
support for the measure, which
they contend would put an end to
useful affirmative action programs.
