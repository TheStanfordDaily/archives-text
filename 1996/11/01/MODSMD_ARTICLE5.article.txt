# Tough senate race is repeat of March

If it seems like Yogi Berra's
famed deja vu all over again, it's
for good reason: Byron Sher and
Patrick Shannon, the two candi
dates vying to represent Stan
ford's district in the state Senate,
faced off last March in a special
election to fill the same seat now
being contested.
Sher, a Democratic assembly
man since 1980 who would have
lost his seat this year under new
term-limit regulations, won the
election in March by about 10 per
centage points. But Shannon, a
former adviser to Gov. Pete Wil
son, is still very optimistic.
A new matchup
"In March, it was the first time
I'd ever been on a ballot," Shan
non said, "and we only had a two
month election period. Now peo
ple are beginning to appreciate the
differences between us over time."

In fact, far
from giving up
after the last
election, Shan
non has been |
campaigning
actively

paign, he said. 'I participated in
over 30 community forums with
Byron where we have outlined our
competing visions for California,
and I have been conducting active
precinct-walking I've visited tens
of thousands of homes, and I've
spoken with individuals directly."
But it's not clear that Shannon
can pull into the lead. In March,
the Republican lost even though
he had an advantage because the
special election was held on the
same ballot as the presidential pri
maries. President Clinton faced
no serious challenger, so there was
