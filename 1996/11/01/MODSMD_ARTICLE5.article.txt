# Tough senate race is repeat of March
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Editorial staff 
If it seems like Yogi Berra's
famed deja vu all over again, it's
for good reason: Byron Sher and
Patrick Shannon, the two candi
dates vying to represent Stan
ford's district in the state Senate,
faced off last March in a special
election to fill the same seat now
being contested.
Sher, a Democratic assembly
man since 1980 who would have
lost his seat this year under new
term-limit regulations, won the
election in March by about 10 per
centage points. But Shannon, a
former adviser to Gov. Pete Wil
son, is still very optimistic.
A new matchup
"In March, it was the first time
I'd ever been on a ballot," Shan
non said, "and we only had a two
month election period. Now peo
ple are beginning to appreciate the
differences between us over time."

In fact, far
from giving up
after the last
election, Shan
non has been |
campaigning
actively
"We're run
ning a grass- j
roots cam

paign, he said. 'I participated in
over 30 community forums with
Byron where we have outlined our
competing visions for California,
and I have been conducting active
precinct-walking I've visited tens
of thousands of homes, and I've
spoken with individuals directly."
But it's not clear that Shannon
can pull into the lead. In March,
the Republican lost even though
he had an advantage because the
special election was held on the
same ballot as the presidential pri
maries. President Clinton faced
no serious challenger, so there was

96
VOTE
less reason for Democrats to vote
than for Republicans in the midst
of a heated primary season.
In Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties — the two in which Sen
ate District 11 is located — only 40
percent of registered Democrats
voted in that special election, com
pared to 47 percent of registered
Republicans. Still, Democrats en
joyed higher total turnout because
so many voters in those counties
are registered with that party.
In this election, Shannon will
be without that advantage. Also,
in this campaign he is being signif
icantly overspent by Sher.
According to the most recent
spending reports filed with the
Secretary of State's Office, Sher
has spent $335,449 to Shannon's
$212,325 — 57 percent more. In
the special election, Sher spent
only 8 percent more than Shan
non, according to papers filed im
mediately before that election.
Those papers document only
expenditures made by the cam
paign itself, however, and Sher
said that expenditures by so-called
"independent committees" allied
with Shannon make it necessary
for his campaign to spend more in
response.
Dirty politics in March
In the last days of the March
campaign, a mailer went out to
75,000 voters accusing Sher of
"deadly toxic law violations" on
his El Dorado County pear ranch.
The charges — which the San
Jose Mercury News later called
"lies and misrepresentations" —
hit close to home because Sher
has long been considered a key en
vironmental leader in Sacramen
to.
That mailer was funded by Citi
zens for a Responsible Representa
tion, a political action committee
with no connection to the Shannon
campaign. It was later determined
that Wilson had contributed most
of the money to the PAC and that
other funding had come from state

Sen. Rob Hurtt, an Orange County
Republican who is his party's
leader in the Senate.
Thus, when Shannon proposed
that both candidates voluntarily
follow the campaign-finance regu
lations contained in Proposition
208 — which will come before vot
ers next week — Sher did not ac
cept. Prop. 208 does not limit ex
penditures by "independent com
mittees."
"His proposal, frankly, was full
of loopholes," Sher said. "Even
though he says 'I'm going to stay
within these limits,' Gov. Wilson
could still put a hunk of money
into this independent campaign to
put out the same kind of mail.
"Sen. Hurtt, who is the Repub
lican leader in the Senate, put
money into that independent com
mittee, and so I said to him and to
the world that I need to be pre
pared to answer those kinds of
mailings that are not subject to the
limits that he's imposed on him
self."
Beyond that, the plan had be
come unworkable, Sher said, be
cause there was no mechanism for
compliance after Common Cause
— the organization sponsoring the
measure — said that it "wouldn't
and couldn't monitor compliance."
Shannon's proposal had called for
monitoring by the government-re
form group.
Limiting expenses?
Regardless, Shannon said, his
campaign will voluntarily and uni
laterally stick to the requirements
of Prop. 208. To that end, his cam
paign will not accept any donations
from corporations or PACs in ex
cess of $500, which is the top
amount individuals can con
tribute.
"I'm following Prop. 208, the
California Political Reform Initia
tive, to its letter," he said, "unlike
my opponent who's taken hundred
of thousands of dollars from the
irial lawyers and the unions."
Sher, for his part, said he does
plan to spend less than the
$400,000 at which Prop. 208
would cap expenses for a state Sen
ate race but that he cannot be
bound by what he calls "new rules

under a measure that hasn't even
been approved by the voters yet."
He also said he expects to see a re
peat of the March "hit piece."
"In the San Francisco Examin
er on Sunday there was an article
on how Gov. Wilson has been out
in kind of a stealth way raising
money for these state legislative
races and had raised $500,000 for
the competitive Senate races plus
another $200,000 which he gave to
Sen. Hurtt for the Republican cau
cus," he said. "So frankly, as we
speak I'm anticipating that we're
going to see that kind of mail here
at the end."
Similarities, with differences
It may be that so much mud was
slung and will be slung in this cam
paign because the candidates
themselves are not dissimilar.
Both men have Stanford connec
tions: Sher, 68, is an emeritus pro
fessor of law and Shannon, 32, is a
1986 graduate. Both list as top pri
orities environmental protection
and additional funding for educa
tion. Both support abortion rights.
At the same time, though,
Shannon generally stakes out
slightly more conservative turf
than his opponent.
In discussing his record in the
Senate since his election in March,
Sher pointed with pride to "trying
to help the public schools reduce
the size of classes in the early
grades, and we did that in the bud
get this year."
Shannon, on the other hand,
while acknowledging that "we def
initely need more money for our
public schools," also stressed that
he'll "make sure that money is
being well spent.
"Over half of our budget goes to
education, and we are not getting a
good return on our dollar," Shan
non said. "We're 50th in reading
proficiency in the nation, of all the
states, 50th in technology in the
classroom. So I want to vote for
more ways to innovate, to get more
resources directly into the class
room, and for me that means more
local control."
But Shannon never strays too
far from the center. Even though
he calls his a tough-on-crime cam

paign — he, unlike his opponent,
favors the death penalty — the Re
publican also sometimes sounds
like an old-time liberal on crime
prevention.
"I'm fighting for prevention
measures which will help us im
prove education and help at-risk
youth and prevent them from lead
ing a life of crime," he said. "But
also protection measures which
will protect us from the worst of
the worst: rapists, serial molesters
and murders. So tough penalties
for them."
New blood vs. stability
Ultimately, though, what Shan
non's campaign seems to be about
is change. Though he did spend
four years in Sacramento as an ad
viser to Wilson on criminal policy,
Shannon has never held elective
office. Sher was in his eighth two
year Assembly term when he won
the March election.
"I represent a change; I'm a po
litical newcomer, coming in with
an independent mind and with no
association with special interests,
to break the gridlock," Shannon
said. "The legislature is character
ized by gridlock and partisanship;
three out of four voters have said
that they want a change in Cali
fornia and that California is on the
wrong track and that their legisla
tors aren't doing a good job. Part
of the problem is that the ex
tremes have dominated the legis
lature and so have the special in
terests."
Sher, though r sees a real need
for experienced legislators in a
time when new term-limits laws
will be creating an entirely neo
phyte Assembly.
"I think that particularly in this
year of term limits — after this
election, there'll be nobody in the
Assembly who was there when the
voters approved term limits in
1990 — that background and expe
rience is helpful," he said. "The
voters can decide whether their
legislator is being effective and
doing a good job, and frankly I
think that in my case, I'll be more
effective representing this area
than a young guy who's running
for his first office."

in this campaign he is being signif
icantly overspent by Sher.
According to the most recent
spending reports filed with the
Secretary of State's Office, Sher
has spent $335,449 to Shannon's
$212,325 — 57 percent more. In
the special election, Sher spent
only 8 percent more than Shan
non, according to papers filed im
mediately before that election.
Those papers document only
expenditures made by the cam
paign itself, however, and Sher
said that expenditures by so-called
"independent committees" allied
with Shannon make it necessary
for his campaign to spend more in
response.
Dirty politics in March
In the last days of the March
campaign, a mailer went out to
75,000 voters accusing Sher of
"deadly toxic law violations" on
his El Dorado County pear ranch.
The charges — which the San
Jose Mercury News later called
"lies and misrepresentations" —
hit close to home because Sher
has long been considered a key en
vironmental leader in Sacramen
to.
That mailer was funded by Citi
zens for a Responsible Representa
tion, a political action committee
with no connection to the Shannon
campaign. It was later determined
that Wilson had contributed most
of the money to the PAC and that
other funding had come from state

Sen. Rob Hurtt, an Orange County
Republican who is his party's
leader in the Senate.
Thus, when Shannon proposed
that both candidates voluntarily
follow the campaign-finance regu
lations contained in Proposition
208 — which will come before vot
ers next week — Sher did not ac
cept. Prop. 208 does not limit ex
penditures by "independent com
mittees."
"His proposal, frankly, was full
of loopholes," Sher said. "Even
though he says 'I'm going to stay
within these limits,' Gov. Wilson
could still put a hunk of money
into this independent campaign to
put out the same kind of mail.
"Sen. Hurtt, who is the Repub
lican leader in the Senate, put
money into that independent com
mittee, and so I said to him and to
the world that I need to be pre
pared to answer those kinds of
mailings that are not subject to the
limits that he's imposed on him
self."
Beyond that, the plan had be
come unworkable, Sher said, be
cause there was no mechanism for
compliance after Common Cause
— the organization sponsoring the
measure — said that it "wouldn't
and couldn't monitor compliance."
Shannon's proposal had called for
monitoring by the government-re
form group.
Limiting expenses?
Regardless, Shannon said, his
campaign will voluntarily and uni
laterally stick to the requirements
of Prop. 208. To that end, his cam
paign will not accept any donations
from corporations or PACs in ex
cess of $500, which is the top
amount individuals can con
tribute.
"I'm following Prop. 208, the
California Political Reform Initia
tive, to its letter," he said, "unlike
my opponent who's taken hundred
of thousands of dollars from the
irial lawyers and the unions."
Sher, for his part, said he does
plan to spend less than the
$400,000 at which Prop. 208
would cap expenses for a state Sen
ate race but that he cannot be
bound by what he calls "new rules

under a measure that hasn't even
been approved by the voters yet."
He also said he expects to see a re
peat of the March "hit piece."
"In the San Francisco Examin
er on Sunday there was an article
on how Gov. Wilson has been out
in kind of a stealth way raising
money for these state legislative
races and had raised $500,000 for
the competitive Senate races plus
another $200,000 which he gave to
Sen. Hurtt for the Republican cau
cus," he said. "So frankly, as we
speak I'm anticipating that we're
going to see that kind of mail here
at the end."
Similarities, with differences
It may be that so much mud was
slung and will be slung in this cam
paign because the candidates
themselves are not dissimilar.
Both men have Stanford connec
tions: Sher, 68, is an emeritus pro
fessor of law and Shannon, 32, is a
1986 graduate. Both list as top pri
orities environmental protection
and additional funding for educa
tion. Both support abortion rights.
At the same time, though,
Shannon generally stakes out
slightly more conservative turf
than his opponent.
In discussing his record in the
Senate since his election in March,
Sher pointed with pride to "trying
to help the public schools reduce
the size of classes in the early
grades, and we did that in the bud
get this year."
Shannon, on the other hand,
while acknowledging that "we def
initely need more money for our
public schools," also stressed that
he'll "make sure that money is
being well spent.
"Over half of our budget goes to
education, and we are not getting a
good return on our dollar," Shan
non said. "We're 50th in reading
proficiency in the nation, of all the
states, 50th in technology in the
classroom. So I want to vote for
more ways to innovate, to get more
resources directly into the class
room, and for me that means more
local control."
But Shannon never strays too
far from the center. Even though
he calls his a tough-on-crime cam

paign — he, unlike his opponent,
favors the death penalty — the Re
publican also sometimes sounds
like an old-time liberal on crime
prevention.
"I'm fighting for prevention
measures which will help us im
prove education and help at-risk
youth and prevent them from lead
ing a life of crime," he said. "But
also protection measures which
will protect us from the worst of
the worst: rapists, serial molesters
and murders. So tough penalties
for them."
New blood vs. stability
Ultimately, though, what Shan
non's campaign seems to be about
is change. Though he did spend
four years in Sacramento as an ad
viser to Wilson on criminal policy,
Shannon has never held elective
office. Sher was in his eighth two
year Assembly term when he won
the March election.
"I represent a change; I'm a po
litical newcomer, coming in with
an independent mind and with no
association with special interests,
to break the gridlock," Shannon
said. "The legislature is character
ized by gridlock and partisanship;
three out of four voters have said
that they want a change in Cali
fornia and that California is on the
wrong track and that their legisla
tors aren't doing a good job. Part
of the problem is that the ex
tremes have dominated the legis
lature and so have the special in
terests."
Sher, though r sees a real need
for experienced legislators in a
time when new term-limits laws
will be creating an entirely neo
phyte Assembly.
"I think that particularly in this
year of term limits — after this
election, there'll be nobody in the
Assembly who was there when the
voters approved term limits in
1990 — that background and expe
rience is helpful," he said. "The
voters can decide whether their
legislator is being effective and
doing a good job, and frankly I
think that in my case, I'll be more
effective representing this area
than a young guy who's running
for his first office."
If it seems like Yogi Berra's
famed deja vu all over again, it's
for good reason: Byron Sher and
Patrick Shannon, the two candi
dates vying to represent Stan
ford's district in the state Senate,
faced off last March in a special
election to fill the same seat now
being contested.
Sher, a Democratic assembly
man since 1980 who would have
lost his seat this year under new
term-limit regulations, won the
election in March by about 10 per
centage points. But Shannon, a
former adviser to Gov. Pete Wil
son, is still very optimistic.
A new matchup
"In March, it was the first time
I'd ever been on a ballot," Shan
non said, "and we only had a two
month election period. Now peo
ple are beginning to appreciate the
differences between us over time."

In fact, far
from giving up
after the last
election, Shan
non has been |
campaigning
actively
"We're run
ning a grass- j
roots cam

paign, he said. 'I participated in
over 30 community forums with
Byron where we have outlined our
competing visions for California,
and I have been conducting active
precinct-walking I've visited tens
of thousands of homes, and I've
spoken with individuals directly."
But it's not clear that Shannon
can pull into the lead. In March,
the Republican lost even though
he had an advantage because the
special election was held on the
same ballot as the presidential pri
maries. President Clinton faced
no serious challenger, so there was

96
VOTE
less reason for Democrats to vote
than for Republicans in the midst
of a heated primary season.
In Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties — the two in which Sen
ate District 11 is located — only 40
percent of registered Democrats
voted in that special election, com
pared to 47 percent of registered
Republicans. Still, Democrats en
joyed higher total turnout because
so many voters in those counties
are registered with that party.
In this election, Shannon will
be without that advantage. Also,
in this campaign he is being signif
icantly overspent by Sher.
According to the most recent
spending reports filed with the
Secretary of State's Office, Sher
