# Less debt?
## University receives $8.8 million bond 
### Jeanhee Hong Contributing writer 
Stanford has been issued an
$8.8 million private-placement
bond that provides the Universi
ty with a low-cost method of pay
ing off its fixed-rate bond debt as
it matures.
State Treasurer Matt Fong
announced the sale of the bond
on Tuesday.
"This program is a low-cost
and efficient way for Stanford to
manage its debt [and] allows one
of the most important education
al institutions in this state to
maximize low cost, tax-exempt
borrowing, while minimizing is
suance and interest costs," Fong
said in a statement.
According to Fong, the policy
helps universities pay off their
debt in a way that can free up rev
enue for other purposes.
Roger Wildermuth, Fong's
press manager, said the policy is
indicative of effective financial
management.
"This particular refinancing
shows that Stanford is doing
everything it can and using its
debt dollars wisely," Wildermuth
said.

According to Wildermuth, fed
eral debt ceilings cap the amount
of non-taxable debt that a univer
sity can accumulate at $150 mil
lion. The longer a university has
been established, the more likely
it is to be near the debt cap.
"When they get close to the cap
of debt, schools are forced to look
at creative ways to expand their
debt dollars," Wildermuth said.
"This private placement bond is
helping Stanford in just that man
ner, helping the University re
structure [its] debt in a way that
frees up resources and still com
plies with federal debt ceilings."
Simone Dickstein, financial
analyst in Stanford's Office of
the Chief Financial Officer, said
the program is a way to "main
tain our current debt structure."
"When the (non-taxable) debt
matures... we pay off the old debt
and refinance it, reissue it. It's not
new (debt), it just has a new time
line," Dickstein said. "It's prudent
financial management."
The financing is the fourth in a
six-part series refunding program
initiated in 1993. The bonds were
issued through the California
Educational Facilities Authority,
of which Fong is the chair.
