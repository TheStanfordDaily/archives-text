# Perot calls for students to vote
## 
### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
Galvanizing a receptive audi
ence in Memorial Auditorium
Friday, presidential candidate
and Texas billionaire Ross Perot
urged students to "vote your
conscience" tomorrow.
Perot, who garnered almost
20 percent of the popular vote in
1992, is running with vice presi
dential nominee Pat Choate on
the Reform Party ticket. His
speech was one of several fea
tured in a third-party series
hosted by the ASSU President's
Office and Stanford In Govern
ment.
Perot's stance on many sig
nificant issues stems from his

prosperity as a businessman.
Saying he has "lived the Ameri
can Dream," Perot said he has
devoted the last five years of his
life trying to ensure the same op
portunities for others.
A graduate of the U.S. Naval
Academy, Perot founded both
Electronic Data Systems and
Perot Systems, a computer sys
tems company. Perot spoke of
the beginning of his business ca
reer, when he had to borrow
$1,000 from his wife, Margot,
and was his company's sole em
ployee. Only in America, Perot
said, can someone start from
such a humble beginning and
rise to such heights.

Reform Party presidential candidate Ross Perot calls on stu
dents to vote at a speech Friday at Memorial Auditorium.
A staunch defender of American
jobs and a vocal opponent of the
North American Free Trade Agree
ment, Perot cited figures from eco
nomic reports indicating a net
trade deficit for the United States.
"Every other industrialized
nation in the world has a trade
surplus. Our total trade deficit
with NAFTA is $70 billion," Perot
said.
Saying "we need more R-O-A-
D scholars — scholars with com
mon sense — in the White
House," Perot, in his reference to
Clinton's status as a Rhodes
Scholar, made it clear that his ur
gency is rooted in his fear of eco
nomic upheaval during the up
coming years.
"Any debtor is at the mercy of
his creditor," Perot said. "This
great nation will be a liability. If
anything were to happen in our
country, I could insulate my fami
ly and my immediate loved ones,
but the only way to insulate all of
you is if we pick up a shovel and go
to work in 1996. We can't wait
four more years."
Perot distanced himself from
President Clinton and Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole in
his call for changes in trade poli
cies, as well in his opposition to
drugs.
Citing an increase in marijua
na use among teen-agers during
the Clinton administration, Perot
likened the trend to "chemical
warfare against children."
The candidate expressed his
aggressive attitude toward drug
use among teen-agers in terms of
a course of action he would take if
he were president.
"If I am president, we will have
one war — a war against drugs,"
Perot said.
Perot, despite presenting a
comprehensive review of the

faults in the current system,
failed to offer specific plans for
combating the problems.
In discussing campaign finance
reform, Perot listed the trans
gressions of the Democratic Party
but got no further than alerting
the audience to the situation.
"Wake up! That's all I'm trying
to say," Perot said.
When speaking of crime and
the prison system, Perot's advice
consisted of "If you can't do the
time, don't commit the crime."
Posing a series of rhetorical
questions to the audience, Perot
drew laughter throughout his
speech. However, he was also ar
restingly serious at several mo
ments, forcing the audience into
somber thought.
Referring to the working con
ditions in Indonesia and China,
Perot reminded the audience that
America's purchasing habits af
fect the lives of millions.
"The fact that you don't know
the people doesn't matter; they're
human," Perot said. "They have
as much value as the most gifted
one of you in this room. Can we
agree on that?"
However, in his attempt to rally
for the rights of exploited workers,
Perot only weakly emphasized his
humanitarian efforts.
Saying that a loss in American
jobs results in an increase in jobs
in third-world countries, Perot
blurred the distinction between
America's economic well-being
and international labor stan
dards.
Perot concluded his speech by
reminding the audience of his
steadfastness and encouraging
students to vote.
"You know where I stand. I
don't move around and wiggle,"
Perot said. "Starting [tomorrow],
you've got to make an informed
vote. You've got to vote your con
science. Whatever you feel, you've
got to do it. I would be crushed if
every single student in this uni
versity didn't vote."
