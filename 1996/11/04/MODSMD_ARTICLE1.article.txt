Galvanizing a receptive audi
ence in Memorial Auditorium
Friday, presidential candidate
and Texas billionaire Ross Perot
urged students to "vote your
conscience" tomorrow.
Perot, who garnered almost
20 percent of the popular vote in
1992, is running with vice presi
dential nominee Pat Choate on
the Reform Party ticket. His
speech was one of several fea
tured in a third-party series
hosted by the ASSU President's
Office and Stanford In Govern
ment.
Perot's stance on many sig
nificant issues stems from his

prosperity as a businessman.
Saying he has "lived the Ameri
can Dream," Perot said he has
devoted the last five years of his
life trying to ensure the same op
portunities for others.
A graduate of the U.S. Naval
Academy, Perot founded both
Electronic Data Systems and
Perot Systems, a computer sys
tems company. Perot spoke of
the beginning of his business ca
reer, when he had to borrow
$1,000 from his wife, Margot,
and was his company's sole em
ployee. Only in America, Perot
said, can someone start from
such a humble beginning and
rise to such heights.
