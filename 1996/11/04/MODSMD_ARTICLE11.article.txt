## Presidential race draws to a close Perot to make appeal on TV 
### 
DALLAS (AP) — Ross Perot is spending
some of the final hours of his presidential
campaign on familiar ground — in the
television studio.
"Tt's saturation bombing," he said of
the 120 minutes of advertising he's bought
to air on election eve.
The quartet of 30-minute-long infomer
cials cost the Perot campaign nearly $2
million, campaign coordinator Russ Ver
ney said yesterday.
Two of the broadcasts will run back-to
back on ABC tonight, with two others
showing on CBS and NBC.
Not every affiliate must carry the pro
grams, but the networks guarantee most
will or the Perot campaign won't have to
pay.
Perot, who made a more traditional
style campaign swing to college campuses

last week, used most of his speeches to
broadly attack Clinton's character.
Although Clinton will not appear with him
on TV, Perot plans to spend some of the
shows on the same subject.
"Wake up!" Perot has been telling his
audiences. "If I had broken my word again
and again and again, you wouldn't want
me as county coroner let alone the most
important job in the world."
The Texas billionaire's stepped-up cam
paign attacks on funding of both political
parties seems to be resonating with some
voters. After months of single digit opin
ion poll support, Perot has seen a recent
uptick.
A Los Angeles Times poll last week put
Perot's support at 12 percent nationally. A
CNN-USA Today-Gallup tracking survey
had him at 11 percent.
