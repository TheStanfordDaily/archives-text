OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A pre-dawn
coffee fix, a breakfast rendezvous with
Colin Powell, a wee-hours Las Vegas
gamble. Winding up his 35th hour of
nonstop stumping this weekend, Bob
Dole called the all-day, all-night adven
tures his "last option" for winning the
White House.
Underlying the jumble of appearances
was the singular message he hopes will
stick by tomorrow: President Clinton
cannot be trusted.
"We've had enough of Bill Clinton —
not a bad fella, but it's time to go back to

Arkansas," said the Republican hopeful,
looking robust and rakish in a brand
new leather bomber jacket.
"We've had literally a scandal a week
in this administration in the last several
weeks," Dole said. "I believe the Ameri
can people — Democrats, Republicans
and independents — are saying we've
had enough."
Projecting as much confidence as a
consistently trailing candidate can, Dole
predicted victory wherever he went

polling data that found Dole's numbers
improving in states key to his electoral
math.
Still, none of the numbers that the
campaign boasted — in Colorado, Geor
gia, Kentucky, Nevada, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee and Texas — gave Dole a solid
lead. He was still running behind or
nearly even with Clinton in those states.
All day, Dole said he caught just an
hour's sleep here and there on the plane.
"So far, so good," he told reporters who
asked how he was holding up.
