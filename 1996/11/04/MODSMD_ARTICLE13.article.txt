# No honeymoon for Clinton
## 
### 
(AP) — President Clinton
battled to break Florida's GOP
tradition and crush Bob Dole's
comeback hopes yesterday while
the challenger asserted he had
the "better compass" to lead
America into a new century.
Republicans voiced growing con
fidence they would keep control
of Congress and warned Clinton
there would be no second-term
honeymoon.
"There are big troubles ahead
for this president," said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, all
but conceding the White House
race as he vowed tough investi
gations of questionable Demo
cratic Party fund-raising.
Two days before America
votes, the presidential rivals
focused on states critical to the
other's success. Dole spent the
day in California, fighting
against the odds for the 54 elec
toral votes that anchor Clinton's
re-election strategy.
The president had two stops
in Florida before flying up the
East Coast to New Jersey, Mas
sachusetts, Maine and finally
New Hampshire. Florida last
voted Democrat for president 20
years ago, but the race was a

dead heat in the closing days.
"As we get closer and closer to
the election, the work passes
from my hands to yours," Clin
ton told a black congregation in
Tampa, Fla. His simple closing
message: Americans were better
off than they were four years ago
— and Republicans are a threat
to Medicare and education. "We
need you, New Jersey," Clinton
said as he made his way up the
coast.
Tomorrow's ballot features
contests for 34 Senate seats and
435 in the House, as well as 11
gubernatorial elections. Demo
cratic leaders predicted they
would get the 18-seat gain nec
essary to retake the House and
put the odds of the three-seat
Senate gain needed for a majori
ty at 50-50. But party pollsters
and operatives were less opti
mistic, and most late polling
suggested Republicans would
keep control.
Final weekend presidential
polling showed a tightening race,
but Clinton still had a decided
edge. Several new national sur
veys showed Clinton leading
Dole by 10 points; one put the
lead at 13 points.
