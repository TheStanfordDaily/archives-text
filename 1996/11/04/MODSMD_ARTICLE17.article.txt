## All I really needed to know ... 
### 
BEING A SENIOR at Stanford is
strange. Younger students inex
plicably look up to you and value
your opinion, everyone at home begins
to place expectations on your future
success and you start getting e-mails
that begin with the phrase "Dear Stu
dent Leader."
For some reason, the people around
you assume you have become wise in
your three-plus years on the Farm.
Somehow all the late nights, long days
and drawn-out dusks have taught you
the secrets of life at Stanford.
So your subordinates begin to turn to
you for advice on all sorts of matters.
They don't generally ask you about
your qualifications, they just ask you
about their problems ("How will I know
if she really loves me?" "Do you think I
can still get into med school if I only
take 14 units this quarter?" "Can you
tell me where Florence Moore Hall is?"
etc.).
I'm not sure how much I've learned
about life at Stanford in my time here,
but I am sure that everything I really
needed to know I learned in Branner
Hall.
Don't eat the fish. Warm milk and
cookies are good for you, but you have
to go to house meeting to get them.
Going to house meeting is bad.
There's always someone playing
piano when you want to watch TV.
Avoid the pretentiously verbose for
they are deplorable.

Stealing is OK as long as you steal
from the dining hall. Never do group
projects with a close friend because
your friends know where to find you.
Take pictures of your resident assistant
when he / she is intoxicated. Limited
doses of a cappella are enjoyable. Jack
in the Box treats you!
You can get extensions by placing
blame on a third party (computer, dog,
death, etc.). The Stanford Directory is
an important source of information; use
of its coupons is financially beneficial.
Naptime is 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. You get
more attention if you cry a lot.
Flicks passes can be rented to your
friends for a tidy profit. Mailing lists
are good because you always have "new
mail." Mailing lists are bad because you
always get "crappy mail."
People who smile a lot are mentally
unstable. Sleep is more important than
breakfast.
You can do homework and you can do
drugs, but it's hard to do homework and
do drugs at the same time. If you put
your plates and dishes outside your
door, they will go away.
Walking to midterms is nice. Never
enter the housing Draw with a friend of
a friend. Spend a quarter off campus or
overseas.
Your roommate is kind of like your
little brother — it's fine to hit him to
get what you want. Instead of going to
Cowell, have some aspirin and wait a
week. Your parents miss you more than

you ever thought possible. It's OK to
get B's and W's. Your parents will miss
you less if you get C's and W's.
It is better to sit alone at lunch than
it is to sit with someone you don't like.
If you are sitting alone at lunch, some
one you don't like will sit next to you.
You don't have to do the reading.
You can always find someone you
know at the post office. If you play
SEGA when you're drunk, don't bet on
the outcome. Pictures last longer than
memories.
"Screw your roommate" is a tradi
tion that began in a fraternity whose
members tried to find horrible dates for
each other — this tradition is alive and
well in Stanford's dormitories. Playing
Monopoly will not help you on your eco
nomics midterm. If it smells clean, wear
it.
Learn to share because someone will
steal your soap anyway. You don't have
to be nice to someone just because he or
she is having a bad day. Dating exists at
Stanford, you just have to ask someone
out. Using fire extinguishers for any
reason besides putting out a fire is not
funny the next day.
Branner sucks.
