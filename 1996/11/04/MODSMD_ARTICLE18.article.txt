Clinton is no progressive

WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL
election a few days away, I
would like to share my decision
to not vote to re-elect President Clinton
with The Daily's readers; I hope that
more people will think critically about
two of the Clinton administration's
most recent atrocities.
Clinton's welfare bill retracts the fed
eral guarantee of food assistance to poor
women and their children, deprives dis
abled children of the aid on which they
rely and penalizes legal immigrants by
cutting off disability aid and food
stamps. Ironically, the welfare bill is
likely to result in a level of desperation
and need that the United States hasn't
experienced since the 1930s when mass
poverty prompted the government to
institute the welfare system.
On a more international scale, Clin
ton's inappropriate and utterly immoral
missile strike on Iraq in early September
disgusted me. The president yet again
ordered an act of war undeclared by
Congress, unapproved by the U.N. Secu

rity Council and unsupported by U.S.
allies.
The United Nations reports that
600,000 Iraqi children have died from
malnutrition or inadequate health care
since the humanitarian embargo against
Iraq began. It is sickening that such an
assault on children is the direct result of
Clinton's pandering to right-wing
domestic pressures, in particular Dole's
attack on Clinton's military policy.
Clinton does not represent the Demo
cratic Party that I signed up for when I
registered to vote. And the party's pres
idential ticket is not one that I could,
with a clear conscience, support.
I encourage other Democrats to re
evaluate their association with the Clin
ton administration and to seek out the
many alternatives to four more years of
right-wing Democrats selling us out for
big money interests and conservative
pressures.
