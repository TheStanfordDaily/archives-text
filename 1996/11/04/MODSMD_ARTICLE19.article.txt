# Koppel over Simitian
## 
### 
Stanford voters should understand
why The Daily's endorsement of county
supervisor candidate Joe Simitian over
Barbara Koppel is ill-advised.
Simitian touts his UC-Berkeley law
degree, but his use of it to attack his
opponent through legal complaints
hardly recommends him. (Besides,
should Stanford really be represented
by a Berkeley guy?) By contrast, Koppel,
with a more modest education, has
achieved far more as a community lead
er.
Koppel has served both her city and
our region during her eight years as
councilwoman and mayor of Cupertino.
Her experience in her city, as well as on
the boards of regional water, trans
portation and air-quality agencies, has

prepared her well for responsibilities as
a supervisor.
More important are Koppel's person
al qualities as a leader and a consensus
builder. She has worked hard to encour
age cooperation between cities on
regional matters. She chaired the cam
paign to save the county library system.
She led the campaign to preserve Black
berry Farm as open space. In addition,
she co-founded the Super Schools Foun
dation to provide computers and science
equipment to local schools.
Lastly, while Simitian has been
endorsed by the other county supervi
sors and will be part of the in-group in
San Jose, Koppel represents the tradi
tion of independence that the Peninsula
expects of its representatives.
