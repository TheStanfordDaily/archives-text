# Democratic candidates favored
## Poll of campus voters finds support for Prop. 215, little for Prop. 209 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
The Stanford student popula
tion will be out in force tomorrow
to vote for Democrats and Democ
ratic-supported propositions, ac
cording to The Daily's election
poll.
Every Democratic candidate
easily outdistanced his or her Re
publican competitor among the
411 students polled, some by as
large as a six-to-one margin, mir
roring the results of Daily polls for
the 1992 and 1994 elections.
Polling also found students
knew little about the races for
local offices.
Presidential election
Of the 275 students polled who
said they intended to vote tomor
row, Bill Clinton and A 1 Gore eas
ily gained a majority of support
with 64.4 percent. This was al
most four times the 16.7 percent
for Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
Four years ago, when Clinton
beat George Bush, a Daily poll re
sulted in almost exactly the same
figures, with Clinton receiving 67
percent, Bush receiving 17 per
cent and Ross Perot 10 percent.
Green Party candidates Ralph
Nader and Winona LaDuke came
in a strong third place with 9.8
percent. Perot and Pat Choate,
the Reform Party candidates, gar
nered only 4 percent in the poll,

which was held before
Perot's appearance on
campus on Friday.
The Libertarian
ticket of Harry Browne
and Jo Jorgenson re
ceived less than 1 per
cent. The designation
of "other" received the
remaining 4.4 percent.
A gender gap show
ing women to be more
supportive of Clinton
than men was evident.
While 55.6 percent of
men polled supported
Clinton, 66.9 percent
of women — more than
two-thirds — support
ed him. In contrast,
18.3 percent of men
said they would vote
for Dole, while only
12.7 percent of women
would.
California proposi
tions
The Daily also asked

how students intended to vote on
two of the most contentious Cali
fornia ballot propositions.
The much-debated Proposition
209, sometimes known as the Cal
ifornia Civil Rights Initiative, was
overwhelmingly rejected by stu
dents.
Of the 214 students registered
in California and intending to
vote, 59.3 percent said they were

against the proposition, which
would end state affirmative action
programs. Only 19.6 percent said
they supported the initiative,
while 21 percent remained unde
cided.
Statewide polls show that
Prop. 209 is favored by about 5
percentage points, counter to
Stanford's overall strong opposi
tion. However, the gap has nar

rowed significantly in recent
weeks.
A gender gap was apparent in
Prop. 209 voting as well. While
only 50.4 percent of men intended
to vote against the measure, 70.1
percent of women intended to
vote no. Opponents of Prop. 209
say the measure would take away
