# Democratic candidates favored
## Poll of campus voters finds support for Prop. 215, little for Prop. 209 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
The Stanford student popula
tion will be out in force tomorrow
to vote for Democrats and Democ
ratic-supported propositions, ac
cording to The Daily's election
poll.
Every Democratic candidate
easily outdistanced his or her Re
publican competitor among the
411 students polled, some by as
large as a six-to-one margin, mir
roring the results of Daily polls for
the 1992 and 1994 elections.
Polling also found students
knew little about the races for
local offices.
Presidential election
Of the 275 students polled who
said they intended to vote tomor
row, Bill Clinton and A 1 Gore eas
ily gained a majority of support
with 64.4 percent. This was al
most four times the 16.7 percent
for Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.
Four years ago, when Clinton
beat George Bush, a Daily poll re
sulted in almost exactly the same
figures, with Clinton receiving 67
percent, Bush receiving 17 per
cent and Ross Perot 10 percent.
Green Party candidates Ralph
Nader and Winona LaDuke came
in a strong third place with 9.8
percent. Perot and Pat Choate,
the Reform Party candidates, gar
nered only 4 percent in the poll,

which was held before
Perot's appearance on
campus on Friday.
The Libertarian
ticket of Harry Browne
and Jo Jorgenson re
ceived less than 1 per
cent. The designation
of "other" received the
remaining 4.4 percent.
A gender gap show
ing women to be more
supportive of Clinton
than men was evident.
While 55.6 percent of
men polled supported
Clinton, 66.9 percent
of women — more than
two-thirds — support
ed him. In contrast,
18.3 percent of men
said they would vote
for Dole, while only
12.7 percent of women
would.
California proposi
tions
The Daily also asked

how students intended to vote on
two of the most contentious Cali
fornia ballot propositions.
The much-debated Proposition
209, sometimes known as the Cal
ifornia Civil Rights Initiative, was
overwhelmingly rejected by stu
dents.
Of the 214 students registered
in California and intending to
vote, 59.3 percent said they were

against the proposition, which
would end state affirmative action
programs. Only 19.6 percent said
they supported the initiative,
while 21 percent remained unde
cided.
Statewide polls show that
Prop. 209 is favored by about 5
percentage points, counter to
Stanford's overall strong opposi
tion. However, the gap has nar

rowed significantly in recent
weeks.
A gender gap was apparent in
Prop. 209 voting as well. While
only 50.4 percent of men intended
to vote against the measure, 70.1
percent of women intended to
vote no. Opponents of Prop. 209
say the measure would take away

opportunities for women.
Proposition 215, which would
legalize marijuana for medical
purposes, was strongly supported.
Almost 59 percent said they would
vote for the measure, while 24.3
percent said they would vote
against it, and 16.8 percent were
undecided.
Regional offices
Among the more localized
races, the pattern of strong Demo
cratic support continued. Howev
er, another pattern — lack of
awareness about candidates —
emerged among the 95 students
polled who are registered to vote
in the Stanford area.
In the race for U.S. representa
tive in District 14, Democratic in
cumbent Anna Eshoo received
56.8 percent of the support. Ben
Brink, her Republican counter
part, garnered only 7.4 percent.
However, more than one-third
of those surveyed — 35.8 percent
— were undecided about there

match between Eshoo and Brink,
who ran against each other in
1994. A 1994 Daily poll showed
Eshoo with 36.1 percent of sup
port, compared to Brink's 7.1 per
cent.
In a rematch of last March's spe
cial election, Democrat and Law
Prof. Emeritus Byron Sher re
ceived 44.2 percent in the race for
the District 11 California State
Senate seat. Stanford alumnus
Patrick Shannon, a Republican, got
only 9.5 percent. However, "unde
cided" garnered the most poll re
sponses, earning 46.3 percent.
"Undecided" was also the big
winner in the state Assembly race
for District 21. A vast majority,
61.1 percent of those polled, did
not yet know for whom they would
vote.
Democrat Ted Lempert got the
support of 32.6 percent, while Re
publican Ted Laliotis garnered a
meager 5.3 percent.
Almost three-quarters of those
polled, 72.6 percent, said they
were undecided about the race for
Santa Clara County supervisor
for District 5. An even 20 percent
said they intended to vote for for
mer Palo Alto mayor and Democ

rat Joe Simitian, while 7.4 percent
said they intended to vote for for
mer Cupertino mayor and Repub
lican Barbara Koppel.
Sophomore Jonathan Russell,
chair of the Stanford College Re
publicans, said the large amount
of undecided voters can be traced
to the newness of the community
for most Stanford students.
"It's really hard for people to
jump right into the political scene
of a new community," Russell
said. "The more local the position
is, the less people are going to
know about the candidates. Stu
dents don't have a lot of time on
their hands to find out about cam
paigns they don't know about
until they see the ballot."
Campus response
Few were surprised when told
the results of The Daily's poll.
"Overall, the data give me and
other Democrats some reassur
ance for our optimism about the
outcome of the voting on Election
Day," said junior Dave Thomas,
chair of the Stanford Democrats.
"Nonetheless, if we do not get a
good turnout [tomorrow], the
good results indicated in the poll
will not be realized. This is espe
cially true for Prop. 209, where
every last vote against the mea
sure will be needed."
Russell said the overall results
were no surprise.
"It is no surprise to find out
that liberalism pervades Stan
ford," Russell said. "College cam
puses are traditionally bastions of
Democratic hope and idealism."
He also said that name recogni

tion and the candidates' portrayal
in The Daily was important to the
poll's outcome.
"The Daily — for better or for
worse — has tremendous influ
ence on which candidates receive
student support," he said. "The
candidates who had more feature
stories or were recommended in
editorials all came out ahead. If
that is all a student hears, what
else can a decision be based
upon?"
Senior Rudy Delson, the presi
dent of the Progressive Student
Network, which supports Nader,

POLL METHODOLOGY

• The Stanford Daily poll is
based on telephone interviews
with 411 Stanford students ran
domly selected from a draft
copy of the Stanford Directory.
• The poll was conducted by
paid interviewers between 6
p.m. and 10 p.m. on Oct. 28
through Oct. 30.
• The respondents consisted
of 237 graduate students and
174 undergraduates. Of those
polled, 275 said they intended
to vote in next week's election.
Of those intending to vote, 214
were registered to vote in Cali
fornia and 95 were registered to
vote in the Stanford area.
• The questions have a margin
of error of approximately 5 per
cent at a 95-percent confi
dence.

said he was surprised by how
poorly Dole fared.
The explanation for why "so
many students should support
Clinton and so few Dole is myste
rious in light of how nearly identi
cal the two candidates' respective
platforms are, especially on eco
nomic issues," Delson said.
He also criticized the voter reg
istration drive put on by the Stan
ford Democrats and the student
population's strong Democratic
support.

"I am very sad that so much ef
fort was put into registering stu
dents only to have them throw
their votes toward the continuing
decay of American democracy by
supporting corporate America's
favorite son, Clinton," Delson
said.
Despite all of the political con
troversy, Russell summed up the
poll, and specifically the numbers
on Prop. 209, succinctly.
"I'm waiting for the real poll on
Tuesday," he said.
