# 150 students join in community service day
## 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
A group of Stanford students chose to spend
Saturday away from their hooks, in-line skates
and intramural games by volunteering as a part
of Reach Out Today, an annual Stanford event
devoted to community service.
In its 13th year, Reach Out Today is de
signed to give students a taste of community
service through dorm-organized projects, ac
cording to senior Neville Anderson, chair of
Stanford Volunteer Network, which sponsors
the event.
The University-wide project has been in the
planning stages since summer. Juniors Jane
Lee and Melissa Mills, special projects directors
for the volunteer network, contacted dozens of
Bay Area agencies dealing with a wide range of
issues, including homelessness, the environ
ment, the elderly and AIDS. On Saturday,
about 150 students volunteered at 15 of those
agencies.
Among the wide range of activities were
painting walls at a drug treatment center, par
ticipating in a political campaign for the Sierra

Club and doing construction work for Habitat
for Humanity.
Although the project will only be a one-day
experience for many students, Mills stressed
the importance of Reach Out Today. "It's im
portant to get outside of Stanford because we
are part of a larger community," she said. "It
shows students that there's a lot of need out
there."
A group from Serra, in Stern Hall, spent the
afternoon painting walls at Free at Last, a sub
stance prevention and treatment center in East
Palo Alto.
It was freshman Michele Chung's first expe
rience with East Palo Alto. "It's crazy how
when you cross the line from Palo Alto to East
Palo Alto, the whole city changes," she said.
Senior Olivia Wang, a resident assistant in
Serra, noted that most students purposely
avoid going into East Palo Alto.
"People tend to get isolated here," she said.
"Until you step out of this bubble called Stan
ford, you don't realize you're in it."
Free at Last Executive Director Priya Haji
stepped out of the bubble when she was a stu
dent at Stanford. Her volunteer experiences as

an undergraduate eventually grew into a career
when she founded the organization with local
resident David Lewis three years ago.
Htyi received a national award for her com
munity leadership and was featured in Made
moiselle magazine and on MTV last September.
Wang said she admires Htyi. "Stanford grad
uates are expected to go on to grad school and
make a lot of money," she said. "Just because
we go to this school doesn't mean we have to
pursue high-paying professions.
"A good education involves much more than
what you learn sitting inside the classroom,"
Wang said.
Not only does Mills hope Reach Out Today
will educate students about the array of volun
teer opportunities in the larger community, but
she also hopes they will gain personal satisfac
tion by helping others.
"Maybe the students will get involved with
the same agency again or just develop an inter
est in doing more community service in the fu
ture," she said.
As a result of Reach Out Today, the students
from Serra are planning dorm-sponsored pro
jects with Free at Last throughout the year.
