## Women find pot of gold in win over Rainbows 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
How do you make 10,000
rowdy people quiet down in a
hurry?
The fourth-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team (19-2)
figured out just how to do that
by dismantling the top-ranked
Hawaii Rainbows (23-1) in front
of more than 10,000 fans in
Honolulu Saturday night.
The Cardinal silenced all
doubters by stunning the high
est* ranked team in the nation in
front of college volleyball's most
intimidating audience.
Hawaii roared out of the
blocks in the first game, run
ning all over a somewhat bewil
dered Stanford squad. The
Rainbows demonstrated why
they are the No. 1 team in the
nation, showing offensive and
defensive prowess. Rainbow
senior middle blocker Angela
Ljungquist took perfect sets
from senior setter Robin Amo
and led Hawaii to an easy 15-5
first-game victory. Stanford
never found its rhythm, and the
situation appeared bleak for the
Cardinal.
"The girls knew that we
weren't keeping the ball in
play," Stanford assistant coach

Rob Patrick said on KZSU.
"We were not as fluid as we
normally are. They came back
to the bench and said, 'Let's get
going; let's keep the ball in
play.' "
Stanford certainly showed
up for the second game, refus
ing to succumb to the Rain
bows or their fans, opening up
the game with an 8-5 lead.
Junior outside hitter Debbie
Lambert, a native of Hawaii,
led the Stanford attack, con
tributing key kills off the
bench. The Rainbows rallied
to tie the score at 8-8, but the
Cardinal countered with six
consecutive points of its own
behind the serving of fresh
man outside hitter Jaimi Gre
gory. The Rainbows would not
go down easily, slowly chip
ping away at the lead but final
ly falling to the Card 15-11.
"I was just trying to mix it up
out there since I have been
struggling with my hitting late
ly," Lambert said.
The third game opened with
Ijambert continuing where she
left off, helping Stanford to a 3-
2 lead. Some exciting hitting
and digging on both sides of the
net entertained the fans and
showed why these two squads are
among the best in the nation. The
Cardinal extended its lead on the
of Ail-American outside
hitter Kristin Folkl, hitting balls
off the Rainbow hitters and finding
holes in the Hawaii defense, guid
ing the Card to a 9-6 advantage.
Walsh and Lambert also con
tributed to the Stanford momen
tum, helping the Cardinal stun the
Rainbows for a 15-6 game-three
victory. The Cardinal over
whelmed the Rainbows, taking
advantage of Hawaii mistakes and
playing with a level of inspiration
usually reserved for the postsea
son.
Stanford continued to blitz
Hawaii in game four, as Folkl pro
vided a kill and Lambert gave the
Card a key block to allow Stanford
to race to a 4-0 lead. Freshman
outside hitter Kerri Walsh also
punished the Rainbow defense as
Stanford extended the lead to 8-1
while Lambert spearheaded the
relentless Cardinal attack, racking
up kill after kill.
But the Rainbows rallied,
behind Ljungquist, bringing the
score to 9-6 in favor of the Cardi
nal. The two teams then went back
and forth, moving the score to 11-8
with Stanford ahead. But Walsh
proved her dominance from the
back row, shooting kills through
the vulnerable Rainbow defense.
The Card finally finished what it
started, pulling the upset over top
ranked Hawaii 15-9.
Even Ljungquist's fiery attitude
and her continual yelling and
pointing at Stanford players could
not save the overmatched Rain
bows. For the Cardinal, Lambert
played one of the best matches of
her career, racking up 12 kills in 24
attempts.
"We knew what we had to do,"
Lambert said. "We came out here
to do one thing and that was to
beat Hawaii."
