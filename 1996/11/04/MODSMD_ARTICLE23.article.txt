# Runners sweep conference titles
## Men and women teams win Pac-10 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
Both the men's and women's cross country teams
dominated their conference competition en route to
capturing both Pacific 10 Conference titles Saturday at
the Stanford Golf Course.
The title is the first for the men since 1985. And
after winning consecutive championships in 1993 and
1994 but losing to Oregon last season, the women ful
filled their year-long goal to "take the Pac back."
"This is a great day for the Stanford cross country
and track and field programs," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "In 1992, when I sat down with the adminis
tration ... and talked about what the goals might be
for the program, this is the day that we hoped would
come. It's been a lot hard work for the coaching staff.
It's been a lot of hard work for the athletes. Every
body's had this dream and vision that this could all
happen for us. It's nice to be able to pull it together in
one year.
"I think that all of our athletes have worked so hard
to make it happen. It's not just seven athletes compet
ing on either team. It's the whole team, the whole pro
gram. That's what's so rewarding about it. It's a good
program with good leadership. That's really what
makes us go, both on the women's side and the men's
side," Lananna said.
Despite strong individual performances from other
teams, the men, ranked second in the nation, proved to
be too deep in talent for anyone else to compete. All five
of the Cardinal point-earners finished before any other
team had two men across the line, and fourth-ranked
Oregon was the only other team with more than one
runner in when the sixth and seventh Stanford run
ners had finished.
UCLA junior Mebrahtom Keflezighi won the race
with a time of 23 minutes, 45 seconds, shattering the
race record set by Arizona's Martin Keino in 1994.

The Cardinal easily sealed the
victory, finishing with 29 team
points, half of second-place Ore
gon's 58. UCLA finished third with
93.
"I think we've got to put thih in
perspective," said sophomore
Brent Hauser. "It's just the Pac
10s. We've got a long way to go still.
It's still almost a month to nation
als. We're just trying to set our
selves for a good race, and I think
this was a very good race for us."

Amy Skieresz (16:36) beat her own
record of 16:45 to take her second
Pac-10 title in as many years.
Freshman Kim Mortensen of
UCLA was not much of a threat to
Skieresz and took second with a
time of 16:54. USC senior Emebet
Shiferaw (17:07) finished third.

Davis at the finish line to take
fourth, as both women finish**!
with times of 17:15. Sophomore

Mary Cobb and junior Sarna Ren
fro both finished with times of
17:25 to take sixth and seventh,
respectively.
"We've accomplished the
biggest goal that we've had up to
this point in this season, which was
to 'take the Pac back,' " Fry said.
"Now we go to districts and show
people what's going on, and I think
that today we've shown that we're
for real. We're not just No. 1 on a
piece of paper, we're deep.
"I think that as a team we're
just going to have to do the same
things we were doing to get here —
those are hard work and working
together as a team. That is the
biggest thing. This team is so
together. We are the best of
friends; nothing could hurt that. I
think our closeness is why we
accomplish the things we do. We're
so supportive of each other," Fry
said.
Seniors Monal Chokshi (17:31)
and Leila Burr (17:38) gathered
the rest of the Cardinal's points by
finishing 10th and 11th, respec
tively.
The third-ranked Cardinal com
bined for 38 points, well ahead of
18th-ranked Washington's 82. Ari
zona, which is ranked 11th in the
nation and figured to be Stanford's
toughest competition going into
the race, finished a disappointing
third place with 92 points.
"I felt our women were heavily
favored going into this meet, and I
think they handled that pressure
very well," said assistant coach
Beth A 1 ford-Sullivan. "They kept
their cool out there. Those are the
factors that are going to play a part
in the districts and the nationals —
being confident, being in control
and keeping our cool. Our women
were very composed athletes."
