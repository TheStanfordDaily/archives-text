# Runners sweep conference titles
## Men and women teams win Pac-10 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
Both the men's and women's cross country teams
dominated their conference competition en route to
capturing both Pacific 10 Conference titles Saturday at
the Stanford Golf Course.
The title is the first for the men since 1985. And
after winning consecutive championships in 1993 and
1994 but losing to Oregon last season, the women ful
filled their year-long goal to "take the Pac back."
"This is a great day for the Stanford cross country
and track and field programs," said head coach Vin
Lananna. "In 1992, when I sat down with the adminis
tration ... and talked about what the goals might be
for the program, this is the day that we hoped would
come. It's been a lot hard work for the coaching staff.
It's been a lot of hard work for the athletes. Every
body's had this dream and vision that this could all
happen for us. It's nice to be able to pull it together in
one year.
"I think that all of our athletes have worked so hard
to make it happen. It's not just seven athletes compet
ing on either team. It's the whole team, the whole pro
gram. That's what's so rewarding about it. It's a good
program with good leadership. That's really what
makes us go, both on the women's side and the men's
side," Lananna said.
Despite strong individual performances from other
teams, the men, ranked second in the nation, proved to
be too deep in talent for anyone else to compete. All five
of the Cardinal point-earners finished before any other
team had two men across the line, and fourth-ranked
Oregon was the only other team with more than one
runner in when the sixth and seventh Stanford run
ners had finished.
UCLA junior Mebrahtom Keflezighi won the race
with a time of 23 minutes, 45 seconds, shattering the
race record set by Arizona's Martin Keino in 1994.
