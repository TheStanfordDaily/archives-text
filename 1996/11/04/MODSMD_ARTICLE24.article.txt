## Card declaws Bruins 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
PASADENA, Calif. - Going
into Saturday's contest with a
two-game losing streak and miser
able performances against Oregon
State and Arizona State, most
thought it would take a miracle for
Stanford (3-5, 2-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) to upend the UCLA Bru
ins (3-5, 2-3) at the Rose Bowl.
The much-maligned Cardinal
gave Stanford fans its version of a
miracle on a 10-play, 80-yard
touchdown drive which gave the
Cardinal a 21-20 advantage with
under a minute to play.
Battered redshirt freshman
quarterback Chad Hutchinson
delivered the game-winning score
to senior flanker Brian Manning
on a perfect strike from the 10-
yard line. On first and goal,
Hutchinson dropped back to pass
and found Manning on a fade to
the left corner of the end zone.
"It was an attitude of, 'We've
had enough of this. We're tired of
losing. Let's go make this hap
pen,' " Hutchinson said. "It was
perfect timing."
The clinching score would
probably not have occurred, how
ever, without the extra effort of
senior running back Mike
Mitchell. Three plays earlier, on
third and three from the UCLA
39-yard line, a Hutchinson pass to
Mitchell in the flat seemed
doomed for failure as the Bruin
defense read it perfectly. Yet
Mitchell broke a tackle and dove
down the sideline for a gain of 5
vards and a first down, thus sus

taining the winning drive.
"I was just trying to pull out of
the tackle," Mitchell said of the
third-down conversion. "When I
got away from him, I looked up
and there was no one there. I was
just trying to get those 3 yards
after I got away from him."
In addition, the Cardinal nar
rowly avoided overtime as the
extra-point attempt did not go
smoothly. A poor snap forced
senior holder Josh Madsen into a
tough hold, but junior place-kicker
Kevin Miller put it through the
uprights for the win.
"Josh had to reach back and get
it and swing it around front, but
he got it back in the right position
for me," Miller said.
On the final drive, Hutchinson
completed all seven pass attempts
for 76 yards. The quarterback,
still nursing a sprained thumb,
also distributed the ball around,
hitting five different receivers.
"We knew we needed seven
[points] to win," said redshirt
freshman wide receiver Troy Wal
ters. "We just took our time and
took what they gave us, the under
neath stuff. We tried to make the
short plays into long plays. Hutch
just had great composure. He was
getting hit all day, but he just
bounced back on that drive. The
whole offense bounced back on
that drive."
Walters was a huge factor all
day for the Cardinal, recording
career highs in catches (eight) and
yards receiving (144). It was the
second 100-yard receiving game of

edge over UCLA.
the year by a Stanford player. The
5-foot-8 receiver caught two pass
es for 31 yards on the final scoring
drive as well.
"Troy really stepped in and
made some big football plays,"
head coach Tyrone Willingham
said. "His catch on the sideline
was what you talk about big-time
players doing. He just had a big
ball game. He was one of the play
ers that just stepped up at the
appropriate times.
In addition to the receivers,
Hutchinson praised his offensive
line after the game for the pro
tection throughout the 4 min
utes, 38 seconds of the final

touchdown march.
"I had all the time in the
world," Hutchinson said. "They
came up huge. It all starts with
them. When they give me protec
tion, I can see the field better."
An interception by Madsen,
the defense's third pick of the
afternoon, ended the ballgame
and gave the Cardinal its first
road win of the season and its
first win over the Bruins since
1992.
It was the defense once again
that kept Stanford in a position
to win. While the offense strug
gled in the third quarter, UCLA
was only able to put up three
points on a Bjorn Merten 27-yard
field goal. The Bruins earned just
three first downs in the entire
quarter.
"It was exciting to watch our

guys play defense — the way
Kailee Wong stepped up, the way
our linebackers stepped up, the
way our secondary played," Will
ingham said. "They were very
aggressive and very sure of them
selves. It was exciting watching
them play football today."
The Cardinal defense held
both aspects of a well-rounded
UCLA offense in check. Running
back Skip Hicks, who leads the
Pac-10 in scoring and collected
259 all-purpose yards against
California last week, was held to
just 94 yards rushing, 5 yards
receiving and one first-quarter
touchdown.
Stanford was also effective
against the pass, forcing Bruin
quarterback Cade McNown into
completing just 14 of his 34 pass
attempts for 156 yards and one

touchdown. Stanford recorded
three sacks (two by Wong) and
broke up 10 passes.
However, UCLA was effective
on the offensive end in the fourth
quarter, putting 10 points on the
board. A scrambling McNown
connected with freshman run
ning back Keith Brown on a 37-
yard touchdown pass to take the
lead 17-14. A Merten field goal
from 47 yards out then extended
the lead to six, setting Hutchin
son up for the culminating drive.
Hicks put UCLA in front early
in the game, breaking a tackle by
junior defensive tackle Carl
Hansen and running all the way
across the field for a 5-yard score
and a 7-0 lead. On the other side
of the ball, the Cardinal struggled
yet again. One first down, one
completion and a Hutchinson
interception were the results of
only eight offensive plays in the
quarter.
Stanford got it together in the
second frame, however, putting
together a 56-yard drive that
ended in a 10-yard Mitchell
touchdown, his fourth trip across
the goal line in the last five
games.
Stanford then took a seven
point advantage into halftime on
a tremendous play by Walters.
Closing in on the end of the half,
the Cardinal was in position to
move the ball into field-goal
range.
Hutchinson lofted a pass in
Walters' direction on the right
sideline, and the Stanford red
shirt freshman out-jumped
UCLA free safety Glenn Thomp
son for the catch. After coming
down in bounds, Walters raced
down the sideline for the score.
"It was a deep route and the
defender had his back to the ball,
so I thought I had an advantage
since he couldn't see the ball,"

Walters said. "So I just went up,
and thank God I made the play."
Hutchinson also put up big
numbers despite the injury and
the defensive pressure from the
Bruins, who registered five sacks.
The Stanford playcaller complet
ed 22 of 32 for 268 yards and two
touchdowns.
"I thought his performance
was a winning performance,"
Willingham said of his quarter
back. "That doesn't always mean
that everything there is what you
want to see, but he did what a
quarterback has to do. He pro
duced a win."
Ironically, of all the receivers
it was Manning who hauled in the
game-winner. After starting the
first four games of the season,
Manning was replaced by senior
Andre Kirwan. Since then, Man
ning, who ranks eighth on Stan
ford's all-time receiving list, has
caught just eight balls.
"The last couple of weeks,
[Manning] has not been strug
gling; he has been playing pretty
good," Willingham said. "We
have said all along that we will
count on [Manning], and we did
count on him. We made the call,
and he made the catch."
Hutchinson, half of the win
ning connection, was not sur
prised that Manning was there for
the Cardinal when they called on
him.
Manning "is known for his
clutch plays, and he came up big
again," Hutchinson said. "He
really has handled everything
better than anyone could handle
it. He's' out there helping the
team even when it's just blocking
or whatever. It's nice that he got
this because he's worked really
hard. He deserves it."
With the goal of sweeping the
California schools still intact, the
Cardinal returns home with a

game against USC (5-4, 3-3) at
7:15 p.m. Saturday.
"For the last four games that
we have, this is a good start to a
positive finish for this football
team," said Willingham.
Mathematically, Stanford still
has a shot at a postseason bid if it
runs the table this month.

Walters' direction on the right
sideline, and the Stanford red
shirt freshman out-jumped
UCLA free safety Glenn Thomp
son for the catch. After coming
down in bounds, Walters raced
down the sideline for the score.
"It was a deep route and the
defender had his back to the ball,
so I thought I had an advantage
since he couldn't see the ball,"

Walters said. "So I just went up,
and thank God I made the play."
Hutchinson also put up big
numbers despite the injury and
the defensive pressure from the
Bruins, who registered five sacks.
The Stanford playcaller complet
ed 22 of 32 for 268 yards and two
touchdowns.
"I thought his performance
was a winning performance,"
Willingham said of his quarter
back. "That doesn't always mean
that everything there is what you
want to see, but he did what a
quarterback has to do. He pro
duced a win."
Ironically, of all the receivers
it was Manning who hauled in the
game-winner. After starting the
first four games of the season,
Manning was replaced by senior
Andre Kirwan. Since then, Man
ning, who ranks eighth on Stan
ford's all-time receiving list, has
caught just eight balls.
"The last couple of weeks,
[Manning] has not been strug
gling; he has been playing pretty
good," Willingham said. "We
have said all along that we will
count on [Manning], and we did
count on him. We made the call,
and he made the catch."
Hutchinson, half of the win
ning connection, was not sur
prised that Manning was there for
the Cardinal when they called on
him.
Manning "is known for his
clutch plays, and he came up big
again," Hutchinson said. "He
really has handled everything
better than anyone could handle
it. He's' out there helping the
team even when it's just blocking
or whatever. It's nice that he got
this because he's worked really
hard. He deserves it."
With the goal of sweeping the
California schools still intact, the
Cardinal returns home with a

game against USC (5-4, 3-3) at
7:15 p.m. Saturday.
"For the last four games that
we have, this is a good start to a
positive finish for this football
team," said Willingham.
Mathematically, Stanford still
has a shot at a postseason bid if it
runs the table this month.

Matt Garlinghouse — Daily
The Bruins lined up against Stanford on Saturday but could not hold off the Cardinal drive in the end.
PASADENA, Calif. - Going
into Saturday's contest with a
two-game losing streak and miser
able performances against Oregon
State and Arizona State, most
thought it would take a miracle for
Stanford (3-5, 2-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) to upend the UCLA Bru
ins (3-5, 2-3) at the Rose Bowl.
The much-maligned Cardinal
gave Stanford fans its version of a
miracle on a 10-play, 80-yard
touchdown drive which gave the
Cardinal a 21-20 advantage with
under a minute to play.
Battered redshirt freshman
quarterback Chad Hutchinson
delivered the game-winning score
to senior flanker Brian Manning
on a perfect strike from the 10-
yard line. On first and goal,
Hutchinson dropped back to pass
and found Manning on a fade to
the left corner of the end zone.
"It was an attitude of, 'We've
had enough of this. We're tired of
losing. Let's go make this hap
pen,' " Hutchinson said. "It was
perfect timing."
The clinching score would
probably not have occurred, how
ever, without the extra effort of
senior running back Mike
Mitchell. Three plays earlier, on
third and three from the UCLA
39-yard line, a Hutchinson pass to
Mitchell in the flat seemed
doomed for failure as the Bruin
defense read it perfectly. Yet
Mitchell broke a tackle and dove
down the sideline for a gain of 5
vards and a first down, thus sus

taining the winning drive.
"I was just trying to pull out of
the tackle," Mitchell said of the
third-down conversion. "When I
got away from him, I looked up
and there was no one there. I was
just trying to get those 3 yards
after I got away from him."
In addition, the Cardinal nar
rowly avoided overtime as the
extra-point attempt did not go
smoothly. A poor snap forced
senior holder Josh Madsen into a
tough hold, but junior place-kicker
Kevin Miller put it through the
uprights for the win.
"Josh had to reach back and get
it and swing it around front, but
he got it back in the right position
for me," Miller said.
On the final drive, Hutchinson
completed all seven pass attempts
for 76 yards. The quarterback,
still nursing a sprained thumb,
also distributed the ball around,
hitting five different receivers.
"We knew we needed seven
[points] to win," said redshirt
freshman wide receiver Troy Wal
ters. "We just took our time and
took what they gave us, the under
neath stuff. We tried to make the
short plays into long plays. Hutch
just had great composure. He was
getting hit all day, but he just
bounced back on that drive. The
whole offense bounced back on
that drive."
Walters was a huge factor all
day for the Cardinal, recording
career highs in catches (eight) and
yards receiving (144). It was the
second 100-yard receiving game of

Redshirt freshman quarterback Chad Hutchinson orchestrated the
final offensive drive of the game that gave Stanford a one point
edge over UCLA.
the year by a Stanford player. The
5-foot-8 receiver caught two pass
es for 31 yards on the final scoring
drive as well.
"Troy really stepped in and
made some big football plays,"
head coach Tyrone Willingham
said. "His catch on the sideline
was what you talk about big-time
players doing. He just had a big
ball game. He was one of the play
ers that just stepped up at the
appropriate times.
In addition to the receivers,
Hutchinson praised his offensive
line after the game for the pro
tection throughout the 4 min
utes, 38 seconds of the final

touchdown march.
"I had all the time in the
world," Hutchinson said. "They
came up huge. It all starts with
them. When they give me protec
tion, I can see the field better."
An interception by Madsen,
the defense's third pick of the
afternoon, ended the ballgame
and gave the Cardinal its first
road win of the season and its
first win over the Bruins since
1992.
It was the defense once again
that kept Stanford in a position
to win. While the offense strug
gled in the third quarter, UCLA
was only able to put up three
points on a Bjorn Merten 27-yard
field goal. The Bruins earned just
three first downs in the entire
quarter.
"It was exciting to watch our

guys play defense — the way
Kailee Wong stepped up, the way
our linebackers stepped up, the
way our secondary played," Will
ingham said. "They were very
aggressive and very sure of them
selves. It was exciting watching
them play football today."
The Cardinal defense held
both aspects of a well-rounded
UCLA offense in check. Running
back Skip Hicks, who leads the
Pac-10 in scoring and collected
259 all-purpose yards against
California last week, was held to
just 94 yards rushing, 5 yards
receiving and one first-quarter
touchdown.
Stanford was also effective
against the pass, forcing Bruin
quarterback Cade McNown into
completing just 14 of his 34 pass
attempts for 156 yards and one

touchdown. Stanford recorded
three sacks (two by Wong) and
broke up 10 passes.
However, UCLA was effective
on the offensive end in the fourth
quarter, putting 10 points on the
board. A scrambling McNown
connected with freshman run
ning back Keith Brown on a 37-
yard touchdown pass to take the
lead 17-14. A Merten field goal
from 47 yards out then extended
the lead to six, setting Hutchin
son up for the culminating drive.
Hicks put UCLA in front early
in the game, breaking a tackle by
junior defensive tackle Carl
Hansen and running all the way
across the field for a 5-yard score
and a 7-0 lead. On the other side
of the ball, the Cardinal struggled
yet again. One first down, one
completion and a Hutchinson
interception were the results of
only eight offensive plays in the
quarter.
Stanford got it together in the
second frame, however, putting
together a 56-yard drive that
ended in a 10-yard Mitchell
touchdown, his fourth trip across
the goal line in the last five
games.
Stanford then took a seven
point advantage into halftime on
a tremendous play by Walters.
Closing in on the end of the half,
the Cardinal was in position to
move the ball into field-goal
range.
Hutchinson lofted a pass in
Walters' direction on the right
sideline, and the Stanford red
shirt freshman out-jumped
UCLA free safety Glenn Thomp
son for the catch. After coming
down in bounds, Walters raced
down the sideline for the score.
"It was a deep route and the
defender had his back to the ball,

since he couldn't see the ball,"

Walters said. "So I just went up,
and thank God I made the play."
Hutchinson also put up big
numbers despite the injury and
the defensive pressure from the
Bruins, who registered five sacks.

The clinching score would
probably not have occurred, how
ever, without the extra effort of
senior running back Mike
Mitchell. Three plays earlier, on
third and three from the UCLA
39-yard line, a Hutchinson pass to
Mitchell in the flat seemed
doomed for failure as the Bruin
defense read it perfectly. Yet
Mitchell broke a tackle and dove
down the sideline for a gain of 5
vards and a first down, thus sus

taining the winning drive.
"I was just trying to pull out of
the tackle," Mitchell said of the
third-down conversion. "When I
got away from him, I looked up
and there was no one there. I was
just trying to get those 3 yards
after I got away from him."
In addition, the Cardinal nar
rowly avoided overtime as the
extra-point attempt did not go
smoothly. A poor snap forced
senior holder Josh Madsen into a
tough hold, but junior place-kicker
Kevin Miller put it through the
uprights for the win.
"Josh had to reach back and get
it and swing it around front, but
he got it back in the right position
for me," Miller said.
On the final drive, Hutchinson
completed all seven pass attempts
for 76 yards. The quarterback,
still nursing a sprained thumb,
also distributed the ball around,
hitting five different receivers.
"We knew we needed seven
[points] to win," said redshirt
freshman wide receiver Troy Wal
ters. "We just took our time and
took what they gave us, the under
neath stuff. We tried to make the
short plays into long plays. Hutch
just had great composure. He was
getting hit all day, but he just
bounced back on that drive. The
whole offense bounced back on
that drive."
Walters was a huge factor all
day for the Cardinal, recording
career highs in catches (eight) and
yards receiving (144). It was the
second 100-yard receiving game of

Redshirt freshman quarterback Chad Hutchinson orchestrated the
final offensive drive of the game that gave Stanford a one point
edge over UCLA.
the year by a Stanford player. The
5-foot-8 receiver caught two pass
es for 31 yards on the final scoring
drive as well.
"Troy really stepped in and
made some big football plays,"
head coach Tyrone Willingham
said. "His catch on the sideline
was what you talk about big-time
players doing. He just had a big
ball game. He was one of the play
ers that just stepped up at the
appropriate times.
In addition to the receivers,
Hutchinson praised his offensive
line after the game for the pro
tection throughout the 4 min
utes, 38 seconds of the final

touchdown march.
"I had all the time in the
world," Hutchinson said. "They
came up huge. It all starts with
them. When they give me protec
tion, I can see the field better."
An interception by Madsen,
the defense's third pick of the
afternoon, ended the ballgame
and gave the Cardinal its first
road win of the season and its
first win over the Bruins since
1992.
It was the defense once again
that kept Stanford in a position
to win. While the offense strug
gled in the third quarter, UCLA
was only able to put up three
points on a Bjorn Merten 27-yard
field goal. The Bruins earned just
three first downs in the entire
quarter.
"It was exciting to watch our

guys play defense — the way
Kailee Wong stepped up, the way
our linebackers stepped up, the
way our secondary played," Will
ingham said. "They were very
aggressive and very sure of them
selves. It was exciting watching
them play football today."
The Cardinal defense held
both aspects of a well-rounded
UCLA offense in check. Running
back Skip Hicks, who leads the
Pac-10 in scoring and collected
259 all-purpose yards against
California last week, was held to
just 94 yards rushing, 5 yards
receiving and one first-quarter
touchdown.
Stanford was also effective
against the pass, forcing Bruin
quarterback Cade McNown into
completing just 14 of his 34 pass
attempts for 156 yards and one

touchdown. Stanford recorded
three sacks (two by Wong) and
broke up 10 passes.
However, UCLA was effective
on the offensive end in the fourth
quarter, putting 10 points on the
board. A scrambling McNown
connected with freshman run
ning back Keith Brown on a 37-
yard touchdown pass to take the
lead 17-14. A Merten field goal
from 47 yards out then extended
the lead to six, setting Hutchin
son up for the culminating drive.
Hicks put UCLA in front early
in the game, breaking a tackle by
junior defensive tackle Carl
Hansen and running all the way
across the field for a 5-yard score
and a 7-0 lead. On the other side
of the ball, the Cardinal struggled
yet again. One first down, one
completion and a Hutchinson
interception were the results of
only eight offensive plays in the
quarter.
Stanford got it together in the
second frame, however, putting
together a 56-yard drive that
ended in a 10-yard Mitchell
touchdown, his fourth trip across
the goal line in the last five
games.
Stanford then took a seven
point advantage into halftime on
a tremendous play by Walters.
Closing in on the end of the half,
the Cardinal was in position to
move the ball into field-goal
range.
Hutchinson lofted a pass in
Walters' direction on the right
sideline, and the Stanford red
shirt freshman out-jumped
UCLA free safety Glenn Thomp
son for the catch. After coming
down in bounds, Walters raced
down the sideline for the score.
"It was a deep route and the
defender had his back to the ball,
so I thought I had an advantage
since he couldn't see the ball,"

Walters said. "So I just went up,
and thank God I made the play."
Hutchinson also put up big
numbers despite the injury and
the defensive pressure from the
Bruins, who registered five sacks.
The Stanford playcaller complet
ed 22 of 32 for 268 yards and two
touchdowns.
"I thought his performance
was a winning performance,"
Willingham said of his quarter
back. "That doesn't always mean
that everything there is what you
want to see, but he did what a
quarterback has to do. He pro
duced a win."
Ironically, of all the receivers
it was Manning who hauled in the
game-winner. After starting the
first four games of the season,
Manning was replaced by senior
Andre Kirwan. Since then, Man
ning, who ranks eighth on Stan
ford's all-time receiving list, has
caught just eight balls.
"The last couple of weeks,
[Manning] has not been strug
gling; he has been playing pretty
good," Willingham said. "We
have said all along that we will
count on [Manning], and we did
count on him. We made the call,
and he made the catch."
Hutchinson, half of the win
ning connection, was not sur
prised that Manning was there for
the Cardinal when they called on
him.
Manning "is known for his
clutch plays, and he came up big
again," Hutchinson said. "He
really has handled everything
better than anyone could handle
it. He's' out there helping the
team even when it's just blocking
or whatever. It's nice that he got
this because he's worked really
hard. He deserves it."
With the goal of sweeping the
California schools still intact, the
Cardinal returns home with a

game against USC (5-4, 3-3) at
7:15 p.m. Saturday.
"For the last four games that
we have, this is a good start to a
positive finish for this football
team," said Willingham.
Mathematically, Stanford still
has a shot at a postseason bid if it
runs the table this month.
