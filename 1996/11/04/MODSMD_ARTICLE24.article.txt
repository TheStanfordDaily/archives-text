## Card declaws Bruins

PASADENA, Calif. - Going
into Saturday's contest with a
two-game losing streak and miser
able performances against Oregon
State and Arizona State, most
thought it would take a miracle for
Stanford (3-5, 2-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) to upend the UCLA Bru
ins (3-5, 2-3) at the Rose Bowl.
The much-maligned Cardinal
gave Stanford fans its version of a
miracle on a 10-play, 80-yard
touchdown drive which gave the
Cardinal a 21-20 advantage with
under a minute to play.
Battered redshirt freshman
quarterback Chad Hutchinson
delivered the game-winning score
to senior flanker Brian Manning
on a perfect strike from the 10-
yard line. On first and goal,
Hutchinson dropped back to pass
and found Manning on a fade to
the left corner of the end zone.
"It was an attitude of, 'We've
had enough of this. We're tired of
losing. Let's go make this hap
pen,' " Hutchinson said. "It was
perfect timing."
The clinching score would
probably not have occurred, how
ever, without the extra effort of
senior running back Mike
Mitchell. Three plays earlier, on
third and three from the UCLA
39-yard line, a Hutchinson pass to
Mitchell in the flat seemed
doomed for failure as the Bruin
defense read it perfectly. Yet
Mitchell broke a tackle and dove
down the sideline for a gain of 5
vards and a first down, thus sus

taining the winning drive.
"I was just trying to pull out of
the tackle," Mitchell said of the
third-down conversion. "When I
got away from him, I looked up
and there was no one there. I was
just trying to get those 3 yards
after I got away from him."
In addition, the Cardinal nar
rowly avoided overtime as the
extra-point attempt did not go
smoothly. A poor snap forced
senior holder Josh Madsen into a
tough hold, but junior place-kicker
Kevin Miller put it through the
uprights for the win.
"Josh had to reach back and get
it and swing it around front, but
he got it back in the right position
for me," Miller said.
On the final drive, Hutchinson
completed all seven pass attempts
for 76 yards. The quarterback,
still nursing a sprained thumb,
also distributed the ball around,
hitting five different receivers.
"We knew we needed seven
[points] to win," said redshirt
freshman wide receiver Troy Wal
ters. "We just took our time and
took what they gave us, the under
neath stuff. We tried to make the
short plays into long plays. Hutch
just had great composure. He was
getting hit all day, but he just
bounced back on that drive. The
whole offense bounced back on
that drive."
Walters was a huge factor all
day for the Cardinal, recording
career highs in catches (eight) and
yards receiving (144). It was the
second 100-yard receiving game of

Redshirt freshman quarterback Chad Hutchinson orchestrated the
final offensive drive of the game that gave Stanford a one point
edge over UCLA.
