# Swimmers out-distance Cal

### Casey Harmon 
In an unorthodox, unscored meet that
saw four records broken in seven events,
the Stanford men's swim team outswam
the California Golden Bears at deGuerre
Pool Thursday.
The meet, held every few years
between the two teams, featured longer
races that are usually not part of the col
lege dual meet schedule.
After swimming very well against the
Cardinal in winning last weekend's Uni
versity of Pacific Invitational, the Golden
Bears came into deGuerre hoping to
show Stanford up again in head-to-head
competition. The Card had other things
planned however, as it opened the meet
by taking the first through third spots in
both the 2,000- and 400-yard freestyles.
The 2,000 free featured Stanford's
junior Kevin Radvany cruising to a victo
ry in 18 minutes, 47.5 seconds. Sopho
more Matt O'Mara (19:02.47) was sec
ond, and a late-charging senior Jon Lis
chke overtook Cal's fastest swimmer in
the last 500 yards of the race to lock up
the third spot for the Cardinal.
Stanford finished 1-2-3 in the follow
ing event, the 400 freestyle, with senior
Scott Jones clocking in at 3:34 80, just
nine one-hundredths of a second off the

meet record. Sophomore Dodd Wales,
who impressively came on in the second
half of his race, finished second for the
Cardinal, while junior Scott Claypool
touched third.
After two events, Cal had yet to place
a swimmer in the top three. But in the
800-yard individual medley, Nuk
Sirisanont, a freshman for the Bears,
touched out Stanford junior Tom
Wilkens (8:09.19 to 8:09.43) for Cal's
first win. Both swimmers were well
under the old meet record of 8:27.85, set
in 1989 by Stanford's Jeff Kostoff.
In the grueling 400-yard butterfly,
Stanford sophomore Matt Pierce blazed
out under record pace for the first 200
yards, turning in 1:55.5 at the halfway
point. Followed closely by Dominic Galic
from Cal, Pierce pulled away over the
second half of the race for the win
(3:58.10) but finished just off the meet
record (3:57.41) set bv Stanford's Jason
Plummer in 1989.
Perhaps Cal's best performance of the
meet was the 400 backstroke, in which
sophomore Bart Sikora knocked 5 sec
onds off the meet record, touching in
3:46.38. Cardinal sophomore Tate Blah
nik was swimming with Sikora through
