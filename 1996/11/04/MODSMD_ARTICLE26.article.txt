# Swimmers out-distance Cal
## 
### Casey Harmon 
In an unorthodox, unscored meet that
saw four records broken in seven events,
the Stanford men's swim team outswam
the California Golden Bears at deGuerre
Pool Thursday.
The meet, held every few years
between the two teams, featured longer
races that are usually not part of the col
lege dual meet schedule.
After swimming very well against the
Cardinal in winning last weekend's Uni
versity of Pacific Invitational, the Golden
Bears came into deGuerre hoping to
show Stanford up again in head-to-head
competition. The Card had other things
planned however, as it opened the meet
by taking the first through third spots in
both the 2,000- and 400-yard freestyles.
The 2,000 free featured Stanford's
junior Kevin Radvany cruising to a victo
ry in 18 minutes, 47.5 seconds. Sopho
more Matt O'Mara (19:02.47) was sec
ond, and a late-charging senior Jon Lis
chke overtook Cal's fastest swimmer in
the last 500 yards of the race to lock up
the third spot for the Cardinal.
Stanford finished 1-2-3 in the follow
ing event, the 400 freestyle, with senior
Scott Jones clocking in at 3:34 80, just
nine one-hundredths of a second off the

meet record. Sophomore Dodd Wales,
who impressively came on in the second
half of his race, finished second for the
Cardinal, while junior Scott Claypool
touched third.
After two events, Cal had yet to place
a swimmer in the top three. But in the
800-yard individual medley, Nuk
Sirisanont, a freshman for the Bears,
touched out Stanford junior Tom
Wilkens (8:09.19 to 8:09.43) for Cal's
first win. Both swimmers were well
under the old meet record of 8:27.85, set
in 1989 by Stanford's Jeff Kostoff.
In the grueling 400-yard butterfly,
Stanford sophomore Matt Pierce blazed
out under record pace for the first 200
yards, turning in 1:55.5 at the halfway
point. Followed closely by Dominic Galic
from Cal, Pierce pulled away over the
second half of the race for the win
(3:58.10) but finished just off the meet
record (3:57.41) set bv Stanford's Jason
Plummer in 1989.
Perhaps Cal's best performance of the
meet was the 400 backstroke, in which
sophomore Bart Sikora knocked 5 sec
onds off the meet record, touching in
3:46.38. Cardinal sophomore Tate Blah
nik was swimming with Sikora through
150 yards but faded to touch sec
ond in 3:51.
The final individual event pro
duced another meet record, with
Cal junior Christian Claytor
eclipsing Olympian Roque San
tos' 7-year-old mark (4:28.47) by
stroking to a 4:22.47 in the 400
breaststroke. Cardinal swim
mers Blake Holden, a sopho
more, and freshman Steve Ron

son placed second and third,
respectively.
After six events, Stanford and
Cal had each won three,
although the depth of the Cardi
nal showed as Stanford only let
Cal take two of the top four spots
once. Cal's wins were almost
always followed by Stanford
swimmers in the second, third
and fourth spots which would
have converted into big points
for the Cardinal had the meet
been scored.
The final race of the meet was
the 4x200-yard freestyle relay.

An actual event in the NCAA and
Pacific 10 Championship meets,
the relay featured a glimpse of
how the two teams might match
up in when they meet again in
March. Stanford's A team of
Jones, Wales, Claypool, and
sophomore Justin Ewers
grabbed the lead from Cal at the
300-yard mark and never looked
back. The foursome lengthened
their lead with each lap, eclipsing
the only meet record not held by
Stanford going into the meet.
Stanford's time of 6:45.87 erased
Cal's record of 6:48.04 from the

1989 meet.
Seven events, four wins and a
whole lot of "depth points" made
the meet look very good from
Stanford's side of the pool. In
light of the win by Cal at last
weekend's invitational (of which
Stanford only attended one day),
yesterday's meet was sprinkled
with a bit of redemption for the
Cardinal.
"After Cal swam so well last
weekend at Pacific, we wanted to
come in today and put them in
their place," said sophomore
Casey Ketterling.
