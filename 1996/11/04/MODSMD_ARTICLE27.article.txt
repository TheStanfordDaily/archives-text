nal members took turns play
ing different positions in
order to gain better under
standing of the game by expe
riencing it from different per

Kramer's goal, which shat

tered the long lull in the game,
was a beautifully executed
"loopy shot," which passed
over the heads of the defen
sive line and Aggie goalie Di
Norman to land deep into the
net.
Davis coach Susan Beaton
said she was proud of her play
ers for putting up a good fight
against the Cardinal.
"Stanford is obviously the
best collegiate team on the
West Coast now," said Beaton.
"They're fast, they're accu
rate, they're great. I'm really
proud of how well we adjusted
to the game, especially after
the first two goals."
According to Beaton, the
Davis players are looking for
ward to a rematch against the
Card next week, this time at
the Aggies' home grounds.
