# The 						triumph of joy over sadness
## El Día de los Muertos celebration dedicated to Burciaga 
### Anne Ruimy Contributing writer 
Although Friday night's celebration of El
Dfa de los Muertos was dedicated to the late
Jose Antonio Burciaga, the evening's events
were characterized more by joy than sadness.
Burciaga, an artist, cultural rights activist
and former resident fellow of Casa Zapata, died
three weeks ago of pancreatic cancer.
The celebrations in the Old Union court
yard included performances by the musical en
semble Mariachi Cardenal de Stanford, the

ater troupe Teatro Xicano and dance troupe
Ballet Folklorico de Stanford.
Some of Burciaga's work was read, as were
several original poems by students. After the
performances, Mariachi Cardenal led a proces
sion to Casa Zapata, where hot chocolate and
pan de muerto were served to a group glad to be
warmed after the walk through the cold night
air.
The Rev. Patrick Laßelle, a Dominican
priest serving the Stanford Catholic communi
ty, explained why El Dfa de los Muertos — the
Day of the Dead or All Souls' Day — is not

tainted by as much sadness in the
Chicano / Latino tradition as in other cultures.
"You may dance with skeletons or with
faces painted white," Laßelle said. "It is not a
denial. It is an affirmation, not of death but of
death passing through tomorrow."
All Souls." Day is celebrated m the Christian
tradition on Nov. 2, a dav alter All Saints Day.
While the first day is dedicated to saints and in
nocents, the second day is dedicated to those
who have been baptized but died with the guilt
of lesser sins on their souls. These
are believed to be in purgatory,
awaiting to go to heaven.
Being remembered by relatives
and friends, along with the food,
music, dances and other arts, is
supposed to help the souls in this
transition phase.
Also true to Di'a de los Muertos
tradition — although a more re
cent tradition — the artistic pro
gram Friday night was closely in
termingled with politics.
Cecilia Burciaga, Tony Burcia
ga's widow, was the honored
guest. She recalled her late hus
band's artistic work, including a
mural he painted in the dining
hall of Casa Zapata and the strong
links he had with Chicano stu
dents, which helped create a sense
offamilia in the community.
She said she is bitter over the
couple's dismissal from Stanford
in March 1994. She said she be
lieves their dismissal was a factor
in her husband's illness and sub
sequent death.
The cancer which led to the
57-year-old Tony Burciaga's
death was discovered only nine
months after the couple's depar
ture from Stanford.

"You don't know how difficult
it is for me to come back on this
Farm. It is only because of the stu
dents that I am here," Cecilia
Burciaga said.
She also exhorted the students
to hold on to their culture.
The reason the Burciagas' dis
missal continues to disturb the
Stanford community, she said, is
"because the roots went deep.
Whatever your culture, keep it
close. Don't melt. Don't accultur
ate."
Her words were echoed by the
artistic representations featured.
Junior Maribel Ledezma read
three original poems, one about
racism, one about the exile of chil
dren of Mexican heritage and one
urging the Chicanos to reconquer
North America.
Later, Teatro Xicano present
ed a short play on Proposition
209, sometimes called the Califor
nia Civil Rights Initiative, which
will go before voters in tomor
row's election.
In the play, an undecided voter
is torn between a devil reading
Prop. 209 (which proposes to end
programs of racial preference,
such as affirmative action) and an
angel showing that affirmative ac
tion helps Chicanos and Latinos
become doctors, lawyers and polit
ical leaders instead of manual la
borers.
