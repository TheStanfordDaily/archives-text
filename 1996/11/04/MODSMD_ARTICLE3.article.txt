# The
						triumph of joy over sadness
## El Día de los Muertos celebration dedicated to Burciaga 
### Anne Ruimy Contributing writer 
Although Friday night's celebration of El
Dfa de los Muertos was dedicated to the late
Jose Antonio Burciaga, the evening's events
were characterized more by joy than sadness.
Burciaga, an artist, cultural rights activist
and former resident fellow of Casa Zapata, died
three weeks ago of pancreatic cancer.
The celebrations in the Old Union court
yard included performances by the musical en
semble Mariachi Cardenal de Stanford, the

ater troupe Teatro Xicano and dance troupe
Ballet Folklorico de Stanford.
Some of Burciaga's work was read, as were
several original poems by students. After the
performances, Mariachi Cardenal led a proces
sion to Casa Zapata, where hot chocolate and
pan de muerto were served to a group glad to be
warmed after the walk through the cold night
air.
The Rev. Patrick Laßelle, a Dominican
priest serving the Stanford Catholic communi
ty, explained why El Dfa de los Muertos — the
Day of the Dead or All Souls' Day — is not

tainted by as much sadness in the
Chicano / Latino tradition as in other cultures.
"You may dance with skeletons or with
faces painted white," Laßelle said. "It is not a
denial. It is an affirmation, not of death but of
death passing through tomorrow."
All Souls." Day is celebrated m the Christian
tradition on Nov. 2, a dav alter All Saints Day.
While the first day is dedicated to saints and in
nocents, the second day is dedicated to those
who have been baptized but died with the guilt
