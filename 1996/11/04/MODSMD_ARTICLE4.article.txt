# Presidential candidates mocked in mock debate

### Yi-Wyn Yen 
Ross Perot wasn't the
only presidential candidate
who came to speak on cam
pus Friday. Bill Clinton,
Bob Dole and Ralph Nader
were all at White Plaza, too
â€” sort of.
The Progressive Stu
dent Network, a campus
group that promotes third
party candidates, spon-

sored a mock presidential debate at noon to
garner support for Green Party candidate
Nader.
The debate, which was scheduled two
months in advance, lost much of its potential
audience when Perot came to campus at the
same time to speak at Memorial Auditorium.
There were about 50 people at White Plaza.
"It was devastating because we knew a
lot of people would go to the Perot rally in
stead," said senior Rudy Delson, president

of the Progressive Student Network.
Delson and others said they were pleased
with the handful of students who did at
tend.
ASSU Vice President Nick Thompson
parodied Dole, speaking in monotone sound
bites that made the crowd laugh. Junior
Ally Field gave a comical representation of
Clinton with a wavering Southern accent,
while Delson, decked in a tie and a white
button-collar shirt, depicted an articulate
Nader.
The 15-minute debate touched on issues
such as the environment, campaign finance
reform and crime.
When asked about environmental issues,
Delson-turned-Nader said, "We have to
think about our long-term natural re
sources. We have the right to take the ini
tiative on these issues. We can't let the tim
ber companies take control of the national
parks."
