# Running for president
## Stanford In Government organizes election toget EPA students excited about politics 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
With Stanford In Government's assis
tance, East Pulo Alto schoolchildren will get
their first taste of the American political
process as they participate in student coun
cil elections modeled after the national elec
tions tomorrow. In their first voting experi
ence, the students will elect their peers to be
student officers.
Members of SIG — an organization that

brings political speakers to campus and pro
vides fellowships for public service intern
ships — are overseeing the whole process,
from voter registration to writing speeches
to proctoring voting booths tomorrow.
Three hundred wide-eyed students in
kindergarten through fourth grade piled
into the Green Oaks Elementary School
cafeteria on Friday morning to listen to the
candidates introduce themselves. Before
this year, the school had no stu
dent government.
According to junior Darron
Evans, SlG's community out
reach committee director, the or
ganization hopes to affect local
communities by helping kids "get
excited about the political process
and get involved in public service
later on."
So far, the project is showing
signs of success. In one fourth
grade class, more than half the

students are running for office.
SIG also registered more than 80
percent of the student body to vote
last week.
At first, many students were
confused about the voting process,
Evans said.
"Some came to our table every
day at recess or lunch and regis
tered more than once just because
they liked filling out the form," he
said.
In the few days leading up the
election, the candidates have been
busy making speeches in class
rooms, coming up with slogans
and putting up posters. The candi
dates' platforms are basically the

same: no drugs, more computers
and books and even harder home
work.
Fourth-grader Juan Sepulveda
said he is running for president
because he wants "to keep kids
from problems because they
might already have problems at
home."
Hector Saulsandoval, another
fourth-grader, said simply, "I
want to keep kids out of drugs, out
of fighting and make a good
school."
Tomorrow, only the students
who registered will be allowed to
vote. Those who do will receive a
sticker to show they have voted,

just as in a real election.
Because the platforms of the
candidates are so similar, Evans
said he fears that the election will
be a popularity contest. But what
the students learn about politics
and the sense of confidence and
leadership skills they gain, he be
lieves, are well worth the effort.
SIG also created a student
council at Castano Elementary
five years ago and teaches a public
speaking class at Los Altos High
School with Stanford Youth
Forensics. The group is looking
for volunteers to act as liaisons be
tween the elected officers and fac
ulty at Green Oaks.
