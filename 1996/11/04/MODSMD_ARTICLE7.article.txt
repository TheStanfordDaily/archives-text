### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
If you're ever out near Cowell Cluster
and you get a craving to eat jamhalaya and
chocolate-butterscotch brownies while
discussing politics, the Giants, Norway or
the inimitable excellence of Bruce Spring
steen, a good person to look for would
probably be Helge Ternsten.
The cook in Alpha Sigma for the last 17
years, Ternsten is one of those rare indi

stance is well-known among Alpha Sig res

social issues, the more Democratic you be
come."
As a Norwegian citizen, Ternsten is not

Ternsten's conversations with stu
