# The 						Boss, the Giants and Norway
## Alpha Sig residents treated to stories, antics of cook Helge Ternsten 
### Curtis Sittenfeld Editorial staff 
If you're ever out near Cowell Cluster
and you get a craving to eat jamhalaya and
chocolate-butterscotch brownies while
discussing politics, the Giants, Norway or
the inimitable excellence of Bruce Spring
steen, a good person to look for would
probably be Helge Ternsten.
The cook in Alpha Sigma for the last 17
years, Ternsten is one of those rare indi
viduals who manages to be beloved with
out being patronized.
According to Chris Sandoval, a senior
who lived in Alpha Sig hist year and regu
larly returns to visit, "Helge's just a great
guy. He knows everyone He's got such a

great sense of taste. He's so cultured."
"I never think of myself as just the cook
here," Ternsten said. "Reality tells me oth
erwise. I like to think I would always be
here if one of [the students) needed me."
To facilitate being there for students,
upon his arrival in 1979, Ternsten ac
quired bar stools to encircle the chopping
block in the kitchen. "It encourages people
to sit down here and makes them feel at
home in their own kitchen," Ternsten ex
plained.
In such a comfortable environment,
while Ternsten prepares meals and stu
dents pass through the kitchen, a variety
of discussions take place — about Tern
sten 's adventures in the Norwegian Mer
chant Marines, about Alpha Sig's history

as a former fraternity or about the fact
that "people are born Republican and be
come Democratic."
According to Ternsten, whose liberal
stance is well-known among Alpha Sig res
idents, "The more you know about life and
social issues, the more Democratic you be
come."
As a Norwegian citizen, Ternsten is not
eligible to vote. "That's why I'm so outspo
ken about politics, so I can influence oth
ers."
Ternsten's conversations with stu
dents usually occur over the noise of his
compact disc player.
Music has always been important to
Ternsten, who was born in 1950.
As a schoolboy in Notodden, Nor
way, he took song titles from Elvis
Presley and The Beatles to school
for his teacher to translate.
Now, Ternsten estimates that
he owns 1,000 CDs and 1,000
records. His first CD player was a
Christmas gift from the residents
of Alpha Sig in 1984. He used to at
tend concerts, Ternsten said, "but
not anymore. I'm too old for a
mosh pit."
Above all, Ternsten is a Spring
steen fan. "When I first heard his
second album, I felt he sang for
me. What he sang about were
things I felt, his honesty and his
humbleness," he said. "He doesn't
only go for the common denomina
tor. He takes the high road."
Ternsten said he and Spring
steen share the same birthday, ex
cept "he's a year older."
His favorite Springsteen song,
Ternsten said, is "Thunder Road."
"It symbolized to me what it
meant to be young and drive
around in your first car."
Ternsten himself actually
spent little of his youth driving
around in a car because he joined
the merchant marine the day he
turned 16.
"I was the youngest of four
brothers who were all sailors," he
said. "Norway has one of the
largest fleets in the world. Most
people in Norway have someone in
the family who's a sailor."
Because he was so young, Tern
sten had three options on board:
being galley boy, deck boy or en
gine boy. He chose galley boy be
cause it paid more than the other
two positions.
"I never thought it would be a
career," he said. "I had practically
never cooked an egg in my life."
Yet Ternsten ascended the
ranks quickly, in part because the
second cook on the ship acquired
syphilis in the Persian Gulf. Tern
sten was given a trial run as sec
ond cook and then promoted to
the position. To his surprise,
Ternsten said, "I realized I liked
[cooking] and I realized I had a tal
ent for it."
Over the course of the next six
years, Ternsten worked on a series

of ships. His favorite parts were
"the camaraderie and the crazi
ness. Everybody expects you to see
the world, but what you really see
is the whorehouses and bars.
"There were a lot of parties.
There was nothing else to do ex
cept work and shower and party."
During this period of "crazi
ness," Ternsten acquired two tat
toos on his right arm: a dagger
whose handle is an embracing cou
ple who, according to Ternsten, ap
pear to be having sex when he flex
es his forearm, and a witch.
"She was supposed to be coming
out of fire, but [the fire) was too
painful. I had to tell the tattooist to
stop," Ternsten said.
Ternsten's time in the mer
chant marine was not all tattoos
and parties, however — he often
worked seven days a week, and he
twice left the ship for a year to at

tend cooking school, the tuition of
which was partly paid by the ship
ping industry.
At cooking school, Ternsten
took classes on subjects such as
math, as well as "food history,
where certain spices come from
[and] how to cut up meat."
In 1972, Ternsten returned
home to Notodden, a town of about
7,000 nearly two hours southwest
of Oslo. He no longer worked as a
cook. "There were five restaurants.
I would have to kill one of the cooks
to cook there," Ternsten said.
He worked briefly as a construc
tion worker, then followed his
brothers to the United States.
Like many other people who
end up on the Farm, Ternsten was
initially drawn here because of the
weather. While staying with two of
his brothers in Aberdeen, Wash.,
("Kurt Cobain's home place")

Ternsten talked to a friend who
was a student at Stanford.
"The whole time I was in Wash
ington, it was raining. She said,
'We've been waiting for it to rain
for three years.' There was a seri
ous drought."
Upon his arrival in sunny Palo
Alto, Ternsten worked at a series
of different restaurants. Initially,
he said, "I wasn't used to the
American way of things. I was used
to kilos and liters. I didn't know
how much to order."
Ternsten first worked on cam
pus in the cafeteria at Tresidder
Union and came to Alpha Sig in
1979, preferring a residential
house to a restaurant.
Working with students "keeps
me somewhat young," said Tern
sten. "Not to look at it but in spirit.
It keeps me in touch with what you
(students) care about."
Ternsten's daily schedule is
fractured in that he works from
6:15 a.m. to 9 a.m., 10 a.m. to noon
and 2:30 to 6 p.m. However, he
likes having breaks.
"I wouldn't want it any differ
ent," he said. Between shifts, he
drives to his home in"the slums of
Porto la Valley," which he shares
with a roommate and a dog.
Starting in 1991, Ternsten lev
eled his existing house and de
signed and built a new house. "I
built it in my lunchbreaks and the
weekends and summer vacation,"
he said.
Starting by taking an introduc
tory architecture class at Canada
College, he ultimately did all the
carpentry, electricity and plumb
ing on his own. In the interim, he
stayed in a shed in the backyard for
1 1/2 years.
"I'm very proud. I've been a
cook my whole life, and this was
something totally different," he
said.
Naturally, the house-building
experience has made its way into
Ternsten's on-the-job stories. Ac
cording to Sandoval, those stories
are why Ternsten is "such a quin
tessential part of Alpha Sig."
Alex Kulungowski, a junior and
the current kitchen manager of
Alpha Sig, echoes this sentiment.
"I don't eat breakfast," he said.
"I don't like to eat breakfast. [But]
whenever I pull an all-nighter, I al
ways end up eating breakfast. I al
ways talk to Helge. That's why I do
it."

Alpha Sig cook Helge Ternsten creates a delectable meal while en
tertaining students at the Cowell Cluster house.
If you're ever out near Cowell Cluster
and you get a craving to eat jamhalaya and
chocolate-butterscotch brownies while
discussing politics, the Giants, Norway or
the inimitable excellence of Bruce Spring
steen, a good person to look for would
probably be Helge Ternsten.
The cook in Alpha Sigma for the last 17
years, Ternsten is one of those rare indi
viduals who manages to be beloved with
out being patronized.
According to Chris Sandoval, a senior
who lived in Alpha Sig hist year and regu
larly returns to visit, "Helge's just a great
guy. He knows everyone He's got such a

great sense of taste. He's so cultured."
"I never think of myself as just the cook
here," Ternsten said. "Reality tells me oth
erwise. I like to think I would always be
here if one of [the students) needed me."
To facilitate being there for students,
upon his arrival in 1979, Ternsten ac
quired bar stools to encircle the chopping
block in the kitchen. "It encourages people
to sit down here and makes them feel at
home in their own kitchen," Ternsten ex
plained.
In such a comfortable environment,
while Ternsten prepares meals and stu
dents pass through the kitchen, a variety
of discussions take place — about Tern
sten 's adventures in the Norwegian Mer
chant Marines, about Alpha Sig's history

as a former fraternity or about the fact
that "people are born Republican and be
come Democratic."
According to Ternsten, whose liberal
stance is well-known among Alpha Sig res
idents, "The more you know about life and
social issues, the more Democratic you be
come."
As a Norwegian citizen, Ternsten is not
eligible to vote. "That's why I'm so outspo
ken about politics, so I can influence oth
ers."
Ternsten's conversations with stu
dents usually occur over the noise of his
compact disc player.
Music has always been important to
Ternsten, who was born in 1950.
As a schoolboy in Notodden, Nor
way, he took song titles from Elvis
Presley and The Beatles to school
for his teacher to translate.
Now, Ternsten estimates that
he owns 1,000 CDs and 1,000
records. His first CD player was a
Christmas gift from the residents
of Alpha Sig in 1984. He used to at
tend concerts, Ternsten said, "but
not anymore. I'm too old for a
mosh pit."
Above all, Ternsten is a Spring
steen fan. "When I first heard his
second album, I felt he sang for
me. What he sang about were
things I felt, his honesty and his
humbleness," he said. "He doesn't
only go for the common denomina
tor. He takes the high road."
Ternsten said he and Spring
steen share the same birthday, ex
cept "he's a year older."
His favorite Springsteen song,
Ternsten said, is "Thunder Road."
"It symbolized to me what it
meant to be young and drive
around in your first car."
Ternsten himself actually
spent little of his youth driving
around in a car because he joined
the merchant marine the day he
turned 16.
"I was the youngest of four
brothers who were all sailors," he
said. "Norway has one of the
largest fleets in the world. Most
people in Norway have someone in
the family who's a sailor."
Because he was so young, Tern
sten had three options on board:
being galley boy, deck boy or en
gine boy. He chose galley boy be
cause it paid more than the other
two positions.
"I never thought it would be a
career," he said. "I had practically
never cooked an egg in my life."
Yet Ternsten ascended the
ranks quickly, in part because the
second cook on the ship acquired
syphilis in the Persian Gulf. Tern
sten was given a trial run as sec
ond cook and then promoted to
the position. To his surprise,
Ternsten said, "I realized I liked
[cooking] and I realized I had a tal
ent for it."
Over the course of the next six
years, Ternsten worked on a series

of ships. His favorite parts were
"the camaraderie and the crazi
ness. Everybody expects you to see
the world, but what you really see
is the whorehouses and bars.
"There were a lot of parties.
There was nothing else to do ex
cept work and shower and party."
During this period of "crazi
ness," Ternsten acquired two tat
toos on his right arm: a dagger
whose handle is an embracing cou
ple who, according to Ternsten, ap
pear to be having sex when he flex
es his forearm, and a witch.
"She was supposed to be coming
out of fire, but [the fire) was too
painful. I had to tell the tattooist to
stop," Ternsten said.
Ternsten's time in the mer
chant marine was not all tattoos
and parties, however — he often
worked seven days a week, and he
twice left the ship for a year to at

tend cooking school, the tuition of
which was partly paid by the ship
ping industry.
At cooking school, Ternsten
took classes on subjects such as
math, as well as "food history,
where certain spices come from
[and] how to cut up meat."
In 1972, Ternsten returned
home to Notodden, a town of about
7,000 nearly two hours southwest
of Oslo. He no longer worked as a
cook. "There were five restaurants.
I would have to kill one of the cooks
to cook there," Ternsten said.
He worked briefly as a construc
tion worker, then followed his
brothers to the United States.
Like many other people who
end up on the Farm, Ternsten was
initially drawn here because of the
weather. While staying with two of
his brothers in Aberdeen, Wash.,
("Kurt Cobain's home place")

Ternsten talked to a friend who
was a student at Stanford.
"The whole time I was in Wash
ington, it was raining. She said,
'We've been waiting for it to rain
for three years.' There was a seri
ous drought."
Upon his arrival in sunny Palo
Alto, Ternsten worked at a series
of different restaurants. Initially,
he said, "I wasn't used to the
American way of things. I was used
to kilos and liters. I didn't know
how much to order."
Ternsten first worked on cam
pus in the cafeteria at Tresidder
Union and came to Alpha Sig in
1979, preferring a residential
house to a restaurant.
Working with students "keeps
me somewhat young," said Tern
sten. "Not to look at it but in spirit.

fractured in that he works from

and 2:30 to 6 p.m. However, he
likes having breaks.
"I wouldn't want it any differ
ent," he said. Between shifts, he
drives to his home in"the slums of
Porto la Valley," which he shares
with a roommate and a dog.
Starting in 1991, Ternsten lev
eled his existing house and de
signed and built a new house. "I

weekends and summer vacation,"

Starting by taking an introduc
tory architecture class at Canada
College, he ultimately did all the
carpentry, electricity and plumb
ing on his own. In the interim, he
stayed in a shed in the backyard for
1 1/2 years.
"I'm very proud. I've been a

something totally different," he
said.
