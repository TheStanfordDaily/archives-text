Dave Levine suspected his
decision to attend Stanford
probably meant the end of his varsi
basketball career. When
Levine inquired about
walking on to the men's
team his freshman year,
the coaches confirmed his
hunch. Then Dave got a
lucky bounce. A friend told
him the Cardinal women's basketball team was in need of a
new manager. Levine was the man for the job.
The manager's duties go well beyond taking stats, preparing
the gym for practice, and getting water; the job also involves
playing against one of the top women's teams in the nation for
four hours a day during practice. The senior creative writing and
English major says he enjoys playing with some of the top
female athletes in the nation, and being a part
of a team again. He even got a Final Four ring
when the women played in the NCAA
Tournament last year —a dream come true
for any player.

Women: Do you feel sale running
alone at night on campus? On November
6. let's don our NIKK's for the first-ever women's
night run. Meet me in front of the post office at
7:30 p.m. for a leisurely jog around campus. . . Stanford's rivalry with the Bears from
across the Bay continues on November 23 in Berkeley. All students seated in the Stanford
section will receive NIKK megaphones Help cheer the Cardinal to victory
and keep the Ax where it belongs: at Stanford!
Tiger's Time
When 20-year-old Tiger Woods turned pro in late August, he
had in mind a modest goal: to earn enough money in the
remaining two months of the season to automatically qualify
for the PC]A tour again next spring. Anything beyond that
would be gravy. Well, pass the gravy.
The first weekend in October. Woods won tht. Las
Vegas Invitational. The win clinched an auto
matic spot on the tour for the next two years and a
check for $297.(KK). Two weeks later. Woods won the
Walt Disney World/Oldsmobile Classic and $216,(XX).
Woods has a chance to load up on even more gravy
Thanksgiving weekend, and not just at the din
ner table. The Skins Game is an
annual made-for- tele vision
(ABC, specifically)
event pitting four mar
quee golfers against each
other in an unorthodox format that
rewards clutch play. Tiger'll be the tine
pumping his fist.
Flag football players: Think you're read\ to
take your game to the national level? The NIKE College
Flag Football regional tournament w ill be held
November 22-24 at the University of San Diego. Winners receive an
