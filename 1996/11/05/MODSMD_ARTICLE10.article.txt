## Clinton, Dole make final pleas to voters 
### 
(AP) — President Clinton appealed for a
second term yesterday by taking credit for
a revived economy and promising that if
given four more years, "we'll be better off
still." Battling the (Kids on election eve, Hob
Dole countered that Clinton faced mount
ing ethical woes and declared: "America
deserves better."
Control of Congress was at stake, too, as
Americans prepared to cast ballots in the
last presidential election of the 1900s. ('lin
ton maintained the upper hand in the race
against Dole and Reform Party candidate
Ross Perot, while Republicans were
favored to keep their House and Senate
majorities.
"I'm not optimistic on a national basis
at all on the presidential race," said Florida
Republican Chairman Tom Slade. "It truly
would be a political miracle if Dole can pull
this out."
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, on the
other hand, voiced confidence he would not
have to hand his gavel over to Democrats
come January.
"I'm currently planning on what we'll
do next year in the majority," Gingrich said
as he campaigned back home in Georgia.
Still, strategists in both parties said
dozens of races were too close to predict on
the final day of a campaign that was both a
referendum on the incumbent Democratic
president and the Republican Congress.

"There are going to be a lot of close
races, and that's just a fact," said Republi
can National Committee Chairman Haley
Barbour.
Given that, the candidates were up
early, or, in Dole's case, didn't bother sleep
ing at all.
Clinton began in New Hampshire, once
firm Republican territory but now part of
the president's solid Northeast base.
"We're one day away from victory," Elaine
Krasker told him inside a Manchester
restaurant.
"It's hard to believe, isn't it?" Clinton
replied, at age 50 setting out confidently for
the final day of what is likely to be his final
political campaign.
in Cleveland, Clinton said the
economy had created nearly 11 million jobs
and the deficit had been cut by 60 percent
since he took office. "We're better ofT than
we were four years ago," Clinton said.
He noted Dole's Senate opposition to the
family leave law and said his Republican
opponent wanted to abolish the Education
Department and enact a "risky scheme" to
cut taxes that Clinton said would imperil
Medicare.
"Seize the day to keep your country
moving in the right direction," Clinton said
in urging supporters to get to the polls
today. "I have done all I can do. It is in your
mrnpr now "
