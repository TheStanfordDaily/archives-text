ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -
The president dismissed Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto's govern
ment yesterday and called for new
elections, bowing to longtime pres
sure from political rivals who
accuse Bhutto of corruption and
mismanagement.
Four provincial legislatures
have been dismissed, and the pres
ident has named a former stalwart
of Bhutto's pjirty, Miraj Khalid, as
interim prime minister.
Soldiers, rifles slung over their
shoulders, stood guard outside
Bhutto's residence and spilled into
the white marble Parliament build
ing in Islamabad, the capital.
Troops also sealed the country's
airports and stood guard outside
the Pakistan Television building

several blocks from the legislature.
There were initial reports that
Bhutto's husband and investment
minister, Asif Ali Zardari, had been
arrested in the provincial Punjab
capital, Lahore, where the army
was also deployed. Zardari has
been at the center of the scandals.
A former ally of Bhutto's, Presi
dent Farooq Leghari called for new
elections to be held Feb. 3. "An
appeal to the electorate is neces
sary," the president said in a state
ment carried by Pakistan's state
run news
T&utto h ;ia denif* Wshe ch argee
against ber. She recently h»d
warned of "a conspiracy agairist
democracy in Pakistan" and had
vowed to complete her term due to
end in 1998.

Opposition parties have repeat
edly urged the president to appoint
a neutral caretaker government
and call fresh elections. They criti
cize Bhutto for not curbing ethnic
and religious violence and for fail
ing to rein in special interest
groups.
In his statement, the president
accused Bhutto of attacking the
country's judicial system. For sev
eral months she has been fighting a
recent Supreme Court decision
that gives the president the power
to {appoint judges rather than the
prime minister and Parliament.
Bhutto called an emergency
meeting of her dismissed National
Assembly members yesterday in
Islamabad.
"The prime minister has

received this letter from the presi
dent informing her that the nation
al assembly has been dissolved,"
said her spokesman, Farhatullah
Babar.
This is the second time Bhutto
has been dismissed from power.
Her first term ended in 1990 after
only 20 months in office — then,
too, she was accused of runaway
corruption and incompetence. She
used mass demonstrations to
orchestrate the early dismissal of
her successor, Nawaz Sharif, and
regained office in 1993.
Since then, she has faced sectar
ian violence, her own brother's
death in a hail of police bullets and
the relentless violence in Karachi,
the country's biggest city and
financial capital.
