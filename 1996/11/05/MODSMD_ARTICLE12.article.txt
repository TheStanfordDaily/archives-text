Republicans seek majority
WASHINGTON (AP) - Republicans,
led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
closed out the election campaign yesterday
with a final push for their first back-to
back House majority in 66 years. "We're
going to keep control of the House," Gin
grich declared.
Democrats pressed their attacks on the
GOP freshmen who came aboard in the Gin
grich wave two years ago. But on Election
Eve, dozens of races remained too close to
call.
Gingrich, at a campaign event in Smyrna,
Ga., contended his party could actually pad
its 236-198 majority. There is one indepen
dent in the 435-member House.
It would take a net shift of 18 seats to the
Democrats to transfer control of the House.

School prayer rejected
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court, dodging a grenade in the battle over
school prayer, rejected Mississippi's bid yes
terday to let students lead group prayers in
public school classrooms, and at assemblies.
But confusion still reigns over just what
the Constitution allows, and school officials
nationwide remain caught in the middle of
what the National School Boards Association
calls "religious warfare."
The justices, acting without comment, let
stand rulings that declared the 1994 Missis
sippi law a violation of the constitutionally
required separation of church and state.
Yesterday's action was not a ruling on the
merits of the Mississippi law and set no
national precedent. But it was a defeat for
officials who hoped to revive the law.

First Madonna, now ...
LOS ANGELES (AP) - It's a thriller, all
right: Michael Jackson's longtime friend is
pregnant with his child.
And contrary to a tabloid report, there
were no test tubes involved and she's not
getting paid, the pop superstar said yester
day.
"I am thrilled that I will soon be a father
and am looking forward, with great anticipa
tion, to having this child," Jackson said in a
statement.
"This is my dream come true."
The mother is Debbie Rowe, a 37-year-old
divorced nurse who has been a friend for 15
years, according to the statement released by
Christine Holevas, Jackson's spokeswoman.
There are no marriage plans and Jackson
will raise the child himself, the tabloid said.
