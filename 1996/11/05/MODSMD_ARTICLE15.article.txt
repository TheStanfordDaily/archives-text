Though he is far from the perfect
candidate and has had his troubles
as president, Bill Clinton has
proven to be an effective leader on
the most pressing issues facing this
country's future. His commitment
to education, in stark contrast to
his Republican opponent Bob Dole,

puts Clinton over the top.

Voters should not be fooled by
this cleverly written ballot initia-
tive. While it bills itself as the Cal-
ifornia Civil Rights Initiative,
every major civil rights organiza-
tions in the state opposes it. The
issue of affirmative action is com
plex and deserves spirited debate,
but this proposition would put a

premature end to a variety of nec

While the bill's ostensible goal is
to allow seriously ill people to use
marijuana for medical purposes, the
language of the initiative text is so
broad that it would result in the vir
tual decriminalization of all marijua
na production and use in California.
If marijuana is really the curative
drug proponents claim, then it is up

Democrat Anna Eshoo has
drawn rave reviews from both cor-
porate bigwigs and progressive stu-
dents for her performance as repre-
sentative of California's 14th Con-
gressional District. Her Republican
opponent Ben Brink has been cam-
paigning hard on economic issues
and is a moderate on social issues,
but he cannot match Eshoo's leg-

While both candidates present
impressive credentials, Democrat
Ted Lempert has already proven
his efficacy in the Assembly by
pushing through the toughest
political ethics legislation in Cali-
fornia history. Republican Ted
Laliotis, a former mayor of Los
Altos and an engineering execu-
tive at Hewlett-Packard Co.,
would bring his managerial exper-
tise to the Assembly, but voters

should recognize the precarious
balance of power in the Assembly
and cast their votes for Democrat
Lempert.

Democrat Byron Sher's
impressive legislative history in
the Assembly and deep connec-
tion with Stanford makes him the
obvious choice for the 11th Dis-
trict Senate seat. His Republican
opponent Patrick Shannon
deserves credit for coming to
campus and getting students
involved in his campaign, but he

simply cannot match the experi

While both candidates have
run afoul of campaign finance
laws .Democrat Joe Simitian
should be elected over Republican
Barbara Koppel. As a current
member of the Palo Alto City
Council and a frequent visitor to
campus, Simitian understands
the concerns of the Stanford com
munity better than Koppel. Vot
ers should remember that much
of the Stanford campus is official-

The big issue in this race is Stan-
ford's proposal to extend and devel-
op the Sand Hill Road corridor.
Menlo Park City Council members
have dragged their feet on this pro-
posal for years. R.P (Dee) Tolles
and Harry Harrison appear willing
to deal with Stanford to get the
Sand Hill Road projects rolling
while the other two candidates —
Charles Kinney and Paul Collacchi
— continue to raise old objections
to this sensible development. If you
