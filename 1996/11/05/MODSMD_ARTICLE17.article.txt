## Black Democrat chooses Dole 
### 
MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER
made certain that all his kids
would register and vote a
straight Democratic ticket. My grand
mother did likewise and made certain
each of her kids stood beside the Demo
cratic Party: "They're the only ones that
care about us black folks. Republicans
don't care about us." With my parents
eschewing a similar philosophy, I grew
up thinking the same way: Democrats
are the only hope for people of color, the
poor and the environment.
Not any more.
I am supporting Bob Dole for presi
dent of the United States — not because
of his promised 15 percent tax cut, not
because of his vision for America, not
even because of his stance on abortion —
but because in order for justice to prevail,
William Jefferson Clinton must lose
today's presidential election to Sen. Dole,
the only candidate with a chance of
defeating Clinton.
Under Clinton's leadership, the
Democratic Party has been transformed
from the party for the people to the party
of the prosperous. The new party mes
sage: The rich can get richer, the poor
can go to hell. Clinton deserves all the
credit for restructuring the makeup of
the "big tent" that once characterized the
party of my parents and grandparents. I
find nothing more asinine, nothing more
perplexing, nothing more incomprehen
sible than why we should re-elect Clinton
as president of these United States. Any

intelligent person would realize what the
hell is going on: Clinton has betrayed the
people who elected him.
And you want to elect him again?
Think cf Clinton as a mechanic. After
12 years of abuse and neglect at the
hands of clueless Republicans, the Amer
ican people decided in 1992 that it was
time to change mechanics. Promising a
grip of progressive reforms — universal
health care, a middle-class tax cut,
expanded rights to gays — Bill and A 1
whirled into the White House on cloud
nine. But instead of "Bill and Al's Auto
Shop" fixing up our run-down Toyota,
they've traded it in for a Yugo while at
the same time managing to wreck the
fender, the alternator and the muffler of
this already second-class vehicle — all
this with the intention that the car
owner will return and solicit the mechan
ics' help once again.
The shocking welfare reform Clinton
signed into law is a fine example of this —
Bill and A 1 promising to fix the mistakes
they've fashioned if we give them anoth
er term. Convinced Dole is worse than
Clinton, we are unwilling to send this
slick little grease-monkey back beneath
the little rock from which he crawled.
But is Clinton really better than Dole?
Four years ago, we took Clinton on
faith; now there is a record. And what we
see is a political chameleon, as loyal to
the American people as Ganelon was to
the Franks.
Consider welfare. Who would have

ever thought a Democrat would end wel
fare? What about Clinton's loyalty to the
gay community, a group largely respon
sible for his victory in 1992? His weak
"don't ask, don't tell" and signing of the
Defense of Marriage Act clearly demon
strate confused allegiances. What about
the environment? Sierra Club board
member David Browser claims, "Presi
dent Clinton has done more to harm the
environment and to weaken environ
mental regulations in three years than
Presidents Bush and Reagan did in 12
years." Clinton cares about children; he
cares about them so much that he vetoed
a ban on late-term abortions twice.
Whatever happened to the lesser of two
evils?
And for his infidelity, we want to
reward him with another term. I know
nothing more absurd.
Does Clinton stand for the rich or the
poor, the environment or the corpora
tions; is he for gays or against them?
Does our president have a firm stand on
anything or has he abandoned everyone
and everything to satisfy the next Gallup
Poll.
Had Hillary been grossly unpopular,
he might have dropped her too.
