A liberal questions 209

LAST MONDAY NIGHT'S debate
between Dinesh D'Souza and
Jesse Jackson brought up many
excellent points in the affirmative action
debate. I was particularly impressed by
D'Souza's well-articulated defense of
Proposition 209. From previous dialogue
on campus and in The Daily, I had been
convinced that Prop. 209 was untenable;
unfair inequalities along racial lines still
exist as historical carry-overs, and affir
mative action, though flawed, works to
rectify these inequalities.
D'Souza pointed out a major flaw in
this line of thinking, namely that the
historical racial oppressor, the white
male, is now less successful than both
Jewish and Asian Americans in terms of
academics and average income. The rea
son for this, stated D'Souza, is that
racial discrimination is no longer the
determining factor it once was. More
important than race is what D'Souza
calls a group's culture of achievement,
which is basically its work ethic. Because
this culture is determined more along
socioeconomic lines than racial ones,
D'Souza advocates replacing racial pref
erence with preference to the equally
qualified but poorer job or college appli
cant. D'Souza also suggests that we
should focus our energies toward pro
moting change at the socioeconomic
level, on problems such as drastically
unequal school systems, instead of along
racial lines. Jackson strangely failed to
address this argument.
D'Souza's arguments, however, are
far from unassailable. One of the
strongest points against D'Souza's posi
tion is our lack of success in addressing
socioeconomic inequalities and our lack

of knowledge in how to better approach
them. D'Souza endorsed school vouchers
as one solution, but the voucher pro
gram is far from noncontroversial and
far from being implemented. In truth,
neither party has much of a grip on solu
tions to these problems. To therefore
encourage the abolition of affirmative
action without actively promoting an
improved alternative suggests a disin
genuous commitment to the goals of
social justice. For example, why doesn't
Prop. 209 initiate socioeconomic prefer
ence at the same time that it destroys
racial preference?
D'Souza also fails to take into account
affirmative action's longer-run benefits.
African Americans and Hispanics suffer
the most from socioeconomic inequali
ties, yet current policy-makers and other
power holders are white. Affirmative
action helps these minority groups to
reach positions of power more quickly
and thus, in the long run, facilitates new
and more effective approaches to socioe
conomic problems, the problems which
D'Souza rightly considers most impor
tant.
D'Souza forced me to replace my lib
eral instinct with deeper thinking. He
also pointed out many of the flaws in
affirmative action as it now stands. In
the end, however, D'Souza proves lack
ing in real commitment to the goals of
social justice. Despite increasingly obvi
ous costs, it is affirmative action's bene
fits that still hold the most weight. Prop.
209 and all efforts to end affirmative
action should be voted down until a bet
ter alternative is ready to be implement
ed.

Asian-American group
calls for vote against
Proposition 209
WE, THE OFFICER core of the
Asian American Students
Association, are writing to
inform you of our opposition to Propo
sition 209. As officers of Stanford's
largest Asian-Pacific American politi
cal, cultural and social organization, we
believe that Prop. 209 poses an imme
diate threat to the Asian-Pacific Ameri
can community and the community at
large through eliminating equal oppor
tunity programs in the public sector.
Because the wording of Prop. 209 is
vague, its full effects are not yet clearly
understood, but it will eliminate all
affirmative action and outreach pro
grams to women and minorities. This
could also potentially include the elimi
nation of funding for women's and eth
nic centers and women's and ethnic
studies programs in California univer
sities and colleges.
As a community that has tradition
ally remained silent on political issues,
we must now speak out against this
attack on civil rights. Nationwide, civil
rights leaders and organizations,
women's groups and other communi
ties of color are publicly expressing
their opposition to Prop. 209.
We have chosen to denounce Prop.
209 despite the divisiveness of the
issue of affirmative action within the
Asian-Pacific American community for
several reasons. We strongly believe
that Prop. 209 will do nothing to reme
dy the underrepresentation of Asian-
Pacific Americans in higher education,
employment and government contract
ing.
Many Asian Americans claim that
affirmative action offers admission to
less qualified students from other
minority groups, in effect excluding
Asians or "taking away our spots."
Contrary to popular belief, affirmative
action is not quotas or the hiring or
admission of unqualified applicants
simply because of the color of their
skin. Affirmative action programs seek
to provide women and minorities with
the opportunity to gain access to
schools, employment and government
contracts.
While it may appear that affirmative
action harms Asians in the school
admissions process, we must note the
overall representation of Asians in
higher education. For example, at
Stanford, Asians make up about 25

percent of the total student population,
and in schools such as UC-Berkeley, 45
percent of the student body is of Asian-
Pacific Islander descent. Despite these
high numbers, groups such as Pacific
Islanders and Southeast Asians are
still underrepresented. Also, at the
graduate level, Asian-Pacific Americans
make up only 15 percent of graduate
students at UC-Berkeley and are
underrepresented in many graduate
fields. Asian-Pacific Americans make
up only 10 percent of tenure track fac
ulty within California's public universi
ties and colleges. Affirmative action
programs in the past have doubled the
graduate student population within the
UC system and sought to increase the
number of Asian-Pacific Americans fac
ulty on UC campuses.
But that's not all. Affirmative action
extends far beyond the admissions pro
cess. It also affects employment and
government contracting, areas in
which Asian-Pacific Americans are still
underrepresented. For example, U.S.-
born Asian-American men are 7 per
cent to 11 percent less likely to be in
managerial positions than white men
with the same education, work experi
ence, English ability and industry
work. Asian-Pacific Americans with
college degrees make 11 percent less
than their white counterparts, and
Asian-Pacific American women make,
on average, 40 percent less than simi
larly educated white men.
Furthermore, Prop. 209 has a lot of
consequences that cannot be seen with
in the language of the proposition. Eth
nic resource centers and ethnic studies
programs, such as Asian-American
resource centers and Asian-American
studies programs at state colleges and
universities, could be eliminated if
Prop. 209 passes.
Finally, some detractors of affirma
tive action argue that such programs
should not be based upon race but
rather on socioeconomic status. How
ever, these individuals fail to recognize
that there are more cases of racial dis
crimination than socioeconomic dis
crimination. Racial discrimination
occurs to people of color, regardless of
socioeconomic background, as most of
us in the Asian-Pacific American com
munity are acutely aware. Prop. 209
eliminates programs which ensure that
such discrimination in the school
admissions process, hiring practices
and governmental contracting do not
occur.
Clearly, it is important that the
Asian-Pacific American community
unite to defeat Proposition 209. We
strongly urge you to join us in opposing

this attack on equal opportunity and to
vote against Prop. 209 today.

The Daily showed
skewed views of
affirmative action
While I was not surprised that the
left-leaning Daily editorial board did
not endorse Proposition 209, the Cali
fornia Civil Rights Initiative, I was
taken aback by the misconceptions fur
thered by Thursday's article, "Keep
our Civil Rights."
First, The Daily says that "Proposi
tion 209 would completely eliminate
affirmative action, which we can not
afford." If the CCRI is passed by the
voters (polls show more than two
thirds favor the initiative with few
undecided), it will send a strong mes
sage that voters reject all discrimina
tion and all preferences on the basis of
race, sex or ethnicity in public employ
ment, public education and public con
tracting. The passing of the CCRI will
also serve as a sign that laws which dis
criminate against minority-owned busi
ness, such as Davis-Bacon, must be
repealed. While the initiative may
affect business decisions, the CCRI cov
ers only the public sector and any such
decisions in the private sectoi will be
purely voluntary.
The Daily, equating civil rights with
racial preferences, also believes that 30
years of progress in civil rights would
be suddenly reversed. The CCRI would
leave all existing federal and state civil
rights protections intact. The burden
of proof that California's public
employers, educational institutions and
public contractors must meet when fac
ing civil-rights challenges to their prac
tices also would remain unchanged.
The Daily's idea of a Stanford with
Cultures, Ideas and Values sections
filled with "all middle-class white
males who all have generally the same
beliefs" is fundamentally flawed, as
well as implicitly racist. The CCRI does
not prevent the public school system or
employers from actively seeking diver
sity (geographic and cultural, as well as
racial) in the classroom and workplace,
respectively, through outreach and
recruiting programs.
Many believe that the CCRI will in

fact help race relations in California.
Currently, the public is frustrated
because civil-rights laws are not
applied consistently. The CCRI will
eliminate the growing divisiveness
because it will require the government
to be fair.
Pressing for equality under the law,
Dole and Kemp present an alternative:
"real" affirmative action. Dole, a dis
abled veteran, has an exemplary civil
rights voting record. While he has sup
ported affirmative action in the past,
he now believes that we must focus on
building equal opportunity, not equal
outcome of results. He understands
that many have benefited from affir
mative action but that it was created
30 years ago "as a temporary program
only," not as a permanent solution.
Republicans believe that capital, credit,
jobs and quality education must be
opened up to all Americans, focusing
on individuals in need and not those of
a particular skin color. We believe in
equal rights, equal justice and equal
opportunity for all, regardless of race,
creed, sex or national origin.
While we don't have a colorblind
society, the CCRI is a step in that
direction: "Government can't make us
equal; it can only make us equal before
the law."

Proposition 211 is
bad for California
businesses, citizens
Don't let the deceptively worded
Proposition 211 fool you. It is not
about protecting us from fraud —
Prop. 211 encourages frivolous securi
ties lawsuits! The federal government
passed a law to outlaw these lawsuits.
If Prop. 211 is passed, it will make Cal
ifornia the only state to allow them to
go to trial. This is a serious blow to
small businesses and taxpayers in Cali
fornia.
According to a nonpartisan analysis
in the California Journal, Prop. 211
grew out of federal tort reforms. Last
year's federal bill makers overhauled
securities litigation law to cut down on
"opportunistic strike suits" that target
companies with volatile stock. Prop.
211, heavily funded by tort attorney
William Lerach and other plaintiffs'
lawyers, would make it easier for
shareholders to file these opportunistic
suits in California. The effect of legal
izing frivolous lawsuits in California is

that all of these lawsuits from other
states will find their way into our
courtrooms, at our expense.
Arthur Levitt, chair of the Securities
Exchange Commission, said congres
sional reforms encourage companies to
"provide investors with valuable for
ward-looking information." With Prop.
211, "Companies will likely refrain
from providing important projections
due to an increased fear of frivolous lit
igation. That would be a step backward
for the one in three American.house
holds that invest in our markets."
It would also be step backward for
the small businesses at the heart of Sil
icon Valley, which will not be able to
succeed because they will not be able to
entice investors with predictions for
fear of litigation.
Four critical points are hidden in
Prop. 211. One, Prop. 211 allows
investors to sue companies if their
stock does not perform exactly as they
predicted. These lawsuits have been
brought up against half of the top 150
Silicon Valley firms including Sun
Microsystems, Silicon Graphics and
Apple Computer. Are half of America's
high-tech firms fraudulent? No, the
reason so many of these suits are filed
against them is that the high-tech field
is risky and volatile. It is easy for stock
prices not to track a firm's expecta
tions. Prop. 211 allows investors to sue
companies if the investors' risky
investments do not pay off.
Two, Prop. 211 shifts the burden of
proof in these cases to the defendant!
Therefore, Prop. 211 is overriding the
"innocent until proven guilty" rule
that is key to the American legal sys
tem.
Three, the proposition does not
allow companies to pay the costs if
their executives are sued. This will
cause companies to move their head
quarters to other states to avoid losing
top executives.
Four, only lawyers get any money
from awarded punitive damages, not
retirees.
Current law already allows retire
ment groups and plans to sue for fraud
through their third-party investors. We
are already protected. If Prop. 211 is
supposed to protect us, why do only
lawyers get any money from awarded
punitive damages? Why does the propo
sition contain a clause that prohibits
the state from limiting attorney fees?
Prop. 211 does not protect us from
securities fraud, it makes us vulnerable
to tort attorney fraud. Vote no on
Prop. 211.

Asian-American group
calls for vote against
Proposition 209
WE, THE OFFICER core of the
Asian American Students
Association, are writing to
inform you of our opposition to Propo
sition 209. As officers of Stanford's
largest Asian-Pacific American politi
cal, cultural and social organization, we
believe that Prop. 209 poses an imme
diate threat to the Asian-Pacific Ameri
can community and the community at
large through eliminating equal oppor
tunity programs in the public sector.
Because the wording of Prop. 209 is
vague, its full effects are not yet clearly
understood, but it will eliminate all
affirmative action and outreach pro
grams to women and minorities. This
could also potentially include the elimi
nation of funding for women's and eth
nic centers and women's and ethnic
studies programs in California univer
sities and colleges.
As a community that has tradition
ally remained silent on political issues,
we must now speak out against this
attack on civil rights. Nationwide, civil
rights leaders and organizations,
women's groups and other communi
ties of color are publicly expressing
their opposition to Prop. 209.
We have chosen to denounce Prop.
209 despite the divisiveness of the
issue of affirmative action within the
Asian-Pacific American community for
several reasons. We strongly believe
that Prop. 209 will do nothing to reme
dy the underrepresentation of Asian-
Pacific Americans in higher education,
employment and government contract
ing.
Many Asian Americans claim that
affirmative action offers admission to
less qualified students from other
minority groups, in effect excluding
Asians or "taking away our spots."
Contrary to popular belief, affirmative
action is not quotas or the hiring or
admission of unqualified applicants
simply because of the color of their
skin. Affirmative action programs seek
to provide women and minorities with
the opportunity to gain access to
schools, employment and government
contracts.
While it may appear that affirmative
action harms Asians in the school
admissions process, we must note the
overall representation of Asians in
higher education. For example, at
Stanford, Asians make up about 25

percent of the total student population,
and in schools such as UC-Berkeley, 45
percent of the student body is of Asian-
Pacific Islander descent. Despite these
high numbers, groups such as Pacific
Islanders and Southeast Asians are
still underrepresented. Also, at the
graduate level, Asian-Pacific Americans
make up only 15 percent of graduate
students at UC-Berkeley and are
underrepresented in many graduate
fields. Asian-Pacific Americans make
up only 10 percent of tenure track fac
ulty within California's public universi
ties and colleges. Affirmative action
programs in the past have doubled the
graduate student population within the
UC system and sought to increase the
number of Asian-Pacific Americans fac
ulty on UC campuses.
But that's not all. Affirmative action
extends far beyond the admissions pro
cess. It also affects employment and
government contracting, areas in
which Asian-Pacific Americans are still
underrepresented. For example, U.S.-
born Asian-American men are 7 per
cent to 11 percent less likely to be in
managerial positions than white men
with the same education, work experi
ence, English ability and industry
work. Asian-Pacific Americans with
college degrees make 11 percent less
than their white counterparts, and
Asian-Pacific American women make,
on average, 40 percent less than simi
larly educated white men.
Furthermore, Prop. 209 has a lot of
consequences that cannot be seen with
in the language of the proposition. Eth
nic resource centers and ethnic studies
programs, such as Asian-American
resource centers and Asian-American
studies programs at state colleges and
universities, could be eliminated if
Prop. 209 passes.
Finally, some detractors of affirma
tive action argue that such programs
should not be based upon race but
rather on socioeconomic status. How
ever, these individuals fail to recognize
that there are more cases of racial dis
crimination than socioeconomic dis
crimination. Racial discrimination
occurs to people of color, regardless of
socioeconomic background, as most of
us in the Asian-Pacific American com
munity are acutely aware. Prop. 209
eliminates programs which ensure that
such discrimination in the school
admissions process, hiring practices
and governmental contracting do not
occur.
Clearly, it is important that the
Asian-Pacific American community
unite to defeat Proposition 209. We
strongly urge you to join us in opposing

this attack on equal opportunity and to
vote against Prop. 209 today.

The Daily showed
skewed views of
affirmative action
While I was not surprised that the
left-leaning Daily editorial board did
not endorse Proposition 209, the Cali
fornia Civil Rights Initiative, I was
taken aback by the misconceptions fur
thered by Thursday's article, "Keep
our Civil Rights."
First, The Daily says that "Proposi
tion 209 would completely eliminate
affirmative action, which we can not
afford." If the CCRI is passed by the
voters (polls show more than two
thirds favor the initiative with few
undecided), it will send a strong mes
sage that voters reject all discrimina
tion and all preferences on the basis of
race, sex or ethnicity in public employ
ment, public education and public con
tracting. The passing of the CCRI will
also serve as a sign that laws which dis
criminate against minority-owned busi
ness, such as Davis-Bacon, must be
repealed. While the initiative may
affect business decisions, the CCRI cov
ers only the public sector and any such
decisions in the private sectoi will be
purely voluntary.
The Daily, equating civil rights with
racial preferences, also believes that 30
years of progress in civil rights would
be suddenly reversed. The CCRI would
leave all existing federal and state civil
rights protections intact. The burden
of proof that California's public
employers, educational institutions and
public contractors must meet when fac
ing civil-rights challenges to their prac
tices also would remain unchanged.
The Daily's idea of a Stanford with
Cultures, Ideas and Values sections
filled with "all middle-class white
males who all have generally the same
beliefs" is fundamentally flawed, as
well as implicitly racist. The CCRI does
not prevent the public school system or
employers from actively seeking diver
sity (geographic and cultural, as well as
racial) in the classroom and workplace,
respectively, through outreach and
recruiting programs.
Many believe that the CCRI will in

fact help race relations in California.
Currently, the public is frustrated
because civil-rights laws are not
applied consistently. The CCRI will
eliminate the growing divisiveness
because it will require the government
to be fair.
Pressing for equality under the law,
Dole and Kemp present an alternative:
"real" affirmative action. Dole, a dis
abled veteran, has an exemplary civil
rights voting record. While he has sup
ported affirmative action in the past,
he now believes that we must focus on
building equal opportunity, not equal
outcome of results. He understands
that many have benefited from affir
mative action but that it was created
30 years ago "as a temporary program
only," not as a permanent solution.
Republicans believe that capital, credit,
jobs and quality education must be
opened up to all Americans, focusing
on individuals in need and not those of
a particular skin color. We believe in
equal rights, equal justice and equal
opportunity for all, regardless of race,
creed, sex or national origin.
While we don't have a colorblind
society, the CCRI is a step in that
direction: "Government can't make us
equal; it can only make us equal before
the law."

Proposition 211 is
bad for California
businesses, citizens
Don't let the deceptively worded
Proposition 211 fool you. It is not
about protecting us from fraud —
Prop. 211 encourages frivolous securi
ties lawsuits! The federal government
passed a law to outlaw these lawsuits.
If Prop. 211 is passed, it will make Cal
ifornia the only state to allow them to
go to trial. This is a serious blow to
small businesses and taxpayers in Cali
fornia.
According to a nonpartisan analysis
in the California Journal, Prop. 211
grew out of federal tort reforms. Last
year's federal bill makers overhauled
securities litigation law to cut down on
"opportunistic strike suits" that target
companies with volatile stock. Prop.
211, heavily funded by tort attorney
William Lerach and other plaintiffs'
lawyers, would make it easier for
shareholders to file these opportunistic
suits in California. The effect of legal
izing frivolous lawsuits in California is

that all of these lawsuits from other
states will find their way into our
courtrooms, at our expense.
Arthur Levitt, chair of the Securities
Exchange Commission, said congres
sional reforms encourage companies to
"provide investors with valuable for
ward-looking information." With Prop.
211, "Companies will likely refrain
from providing important projections
due to an increased fear of frivolous lit
igation. That would be a step backward
for the one in three American.house
holds that invest in our markets."
It would also be step backward for
the small businesses at the heart of Sil
icon Valley, which will not be able to
succeed because they will not be able to
entice investors with predictions for
fear of litigation.
Four critical points are hidden in
Prop. 211. One, Prop. 211 allows
investors to sue companies if their
stock does not perform exactly as they
predicted. These lawsuits have been
brought up against half of the top 150
Silicon Valley firms including Sun
Microsystems, Silicon Graphics and
Apple Computer. Are half of America's
high-tech firms fraudulent? No, the
reason so many of these suits are filed
against them is that the high-tech field
is risky and volatile. It is easy for stock
prices not to track a firm's expecta
tions. Prop. 211 allows investors to sue
companies if the investors' risky
investments do not pay off.
Two, Prop. 211 shifts the burden of
proof in these cases to the defendant!
Therefore, Prop. 211 is overriding the
"innocent until proven guilty" rule
that is key to the American legal sys
tem.
Three, the proposition does not
allow companies to pay the costs if
their executives are sued. This will
cause companies to move their head
quarters to other states to avoid losing
top executives.
Four, only lawyers get any money
from awarded punitive damages, not
retirees.
Current law already allows retire
ment groups and plans to sue for fraud
through their third-party investors. We
are already protected. If Prop. 211 is
supposed to protect us, why do only
lawyers get any money from awarded
punitive damages? Why does the propo
sition contain a clause that prohibits
the state from limiting attorney fees?
Prop. 211 does not protect us from
securities fraud, it makes us vulnerable
to tort attorney fraud. Vote no on
Prop. 211.

LAST MONDAY NIGHT'S debate
between Dinesh D'Souza and
Jesse Jackson brought up many
excellent points in the affirmative action
debate. I was particularly impressed by
D'Souza's well-articulated defense of
Proposition 209. From previous dialogue
on campus and in The Daily, I had been
convinced that Prop. 209 was untenable;
unfair inequalities along racial lines still
exist as historical carry-overs, and affir
mative action, though flawed, works to
rectify these inequalities.
D'Souza pointed out a major flaw in
this line of thinking, namely that the
historical racial oppressor, the white
male, is now less successful than both
Jewish and Asian Americans in terms of
academics and average income. The rea
son for this, stated D'Souza, is that
racial discrimination is no longer the
determining factor it once was. More
important than race is what D'Souza
calls a group's culture of achievement,
which is basically its work ethic. Because
this culture is determined more along
socioeconomic lines than racial ones,
D'Souza advocates replacing racial pref
erence with preference to the equally
qualified but poorer job or college appli
cant. D'Souza also suggests that we
should focus our energies toward pro
moting change at the socioeconomic
level, on problems such as drastically
unequal school systems, instead of along
racial lines. Jackson strangely failed to
address this argument.
D'Souza's arguments, however, are
far from unassailable. One of the
strongest points against D'Souza's posi
tion is our lack of success in addressing
socioeconomic inequalities and our lack

of knowledge in how to better approach
them. D'Souza endorsed school vouchers
as one solution, but the voucher pro
gram is far from noncontroversial and
far from being implemented. In truth,
neither party has much of a grip on solu
tions to these problems. To therefore
encourage the abolition of affirmative
action without actively promoting an
improved alternative suggests a disin
genuous commitment to the goals of
social justice. For example, why doesn't
Prop. 209 initiate socioeconomic prefer
ence at the same time that it destroys
racial preference?
D'Souza also fails to take into account
affirmative action's longer-run benefits.
African Americans and Hispanics suffer
the most from socioeconomic inequali
ties, yet current policy-makers and other
power holders are white. Affirmative
action helps these minority groups to
reach positions of power more quickly
and thus, in the long run, facilitates new
and more effective approaches to socioe
conomic problems, the problems which
D'Souza rightly considers most impor
tant.
D'Souza forced me to replace my lib
eral instinct with deeper thinking. He
also pointed out many of the flaws in
affirmative action as it now stands. In
the end, however, D'Souza proves lack
ing in real commitment to the goals of
social justice. Despite increasingly obvi
ous costs, it is affirmative action's bene
fits that still hold the most weight. Prop.
209 and all efforts to end affirmative
action should be voted down until a bet

programs in the past have doubled the
graduate student population within the
UC system and sought to increase the
number of Asian-Pacific Americans fac
ulty on UC campuses.
But that's not all. Affirmative action
extends far beyond the admissions pro
cess. It also affects employment and
government contracting, areas in
which Asian-Pacific Americans are still
underrepresented. For example, U.S.-
born Asian-American men are 7 per
cent to 11 percent less likely to be in
managerial positions than white men
with the same education, work experi
ence, English ability and industry
work. Asian-Pacific Americans with
college degrees make 11 percent less
than their white counterparts, and
Asian-Pacific American women make,
on average, 40 percent less than simi
larly educated white men.
Furthermore, Prop. 209 has a lot of
consequences that cannot be seen with
in the language of the proposition. Eth
nic resource centers and ethnic studies
programs, such as Asian-American
resource centers and Asian-American
studies programs at state colleges and
universities, could be eliminated if
Prop. 209 passes.
Finally, some detractors of affirma
tive action argue that such programs
should not be based upon race but
rather on socioeconomic status. How
ever, these individuals fail to recognize
that there are more cases of racial dis
crimination than socioeconomic dis
crimination. Racial discrimination
occurs to people of color, regardless of
socioeconomic background, as most of
us in the Asian-Pacific American com
munity are acutely aware. Prop. 209
eliminates programs which ensure that
such discrimination in the school
admissions process, hiring practices
and governmental contracting do not
occur.
Clearly, it is important that the
Asian-Pacific American community
unite to defeat Proposition 209. We
strongly urge you to join us in opposing

this attack on equal opportunity and to
vote against Prop. 209 today.

The Daily showed
skewed views of
affirmative action
While I was not surprised that the
left-leaning Daily editorial board did
not endorse Proposition 209, the Cali
fornia Civil Rights Initiative, I was
taken aback by the misconceptions fur
thered by Thursday's article, "Keep
our Civil Rights."
First, The Daily says that "Proposi
tion 209 would completely eliminate
affirmative action, which we can not
afford." If the CCRI is passed by the
voters (polls show more than two
thirds favor the initiative with few
undecided), it will send a strong mes
sage that voters reject all discrimina
tion and all preferences on the basis of
race, sex or ethnicity in public employ
ment, public education and public con
tracting. The passing of the CCRI will
also serve as a sign that laws which dis
criminate against minority-owned busi
ness, such as Davis-Bacon, must be
repealed. While the initiative may
affect business decisions, the CCRI cov
ers only the public sector and any such
decisions in the private sectoi will be
purely voluntary.
The Daily, equating civil rights with
racial preferences, also believes that 30
years of progress in civil rights would
be suddenly reversed. The CCRI would
leave all existing federal and state civil
rights protections intact. The burden
of proof that California's public
employers, educational institutions and
public contractors must meet when fac
ing civil-rights challenges to their prac
tices also would remain unchanged.
The Daily's idea of a Stanford with
Cultures, Ideas and Values sections
filled with "all middle-class white
males who all have generally the same
beliefs" is fundamentally flawed, as
well as implicitly racist. The CCRI does
not prevent the public school system or
employers from actively seeking diver
sity (geographic and cultural, as well as
racial) in the classroom and workplace,
respectively, through outreach and
recruiting programs.
Many believe that the CCRI will in

fact help race relations in California.
Currently, the public is frustrated
because civil-rights laws are not
applied consistently. The CCRI will
eliminate the growing divisiveness
because it will require the government
to be fair.
Pressing for equality under the law,
Dole and Kemp present an alternative:
"real" affirmative action. Dole, a dis
abled veteran, has an exemplary civil
rights voting record. While he has sup
ported affirmative action in the past,
he now believes that we must focus on
building equal opportunity, not equal
outcome of results. He understands
that many have benefited from affir
mative action but that it was created
30 years ago "as a temporary program
only," not as a permanent solution.
Republicans believe that capital, credit,
jobs and quality education must be
opened up to all Americans, focusing
on individuals in need and not those of
a particular skin color. We believe in
equal rights, equal justice and equal
opportunity for all, regardless of race,
creed, sex or national origin.
While we don't have a colorblind
society, the CCRI is a step in that
direction: "Government can't make us
equal; it can only make us equal before
the law."

Proposition 211 is
bad for California
businesses, citizens
Don't let the deceptively worded
Proposition 211 fool you. It is not
about protecting us from fraud —
Prop. 211 encourages frivolous securi
ties lawsuits! The federal government
passed a law to outlaw these lawsuits.
If Prop. 211 is passed, it will make Cal
ifornia the only state to allow them to
go to trial. This is a serious blow to
small businesses and taxpayers in Cali
fornia.
According to a nonpartisan analysis
in the California Journal, Prop. 211
grew out of federal tort reforms. Last
year's federal bill makers overhauled
securities litigation law to cut down on
"opportunistic strike suits" that target
companies with volatile stock. Prop.
211, heavily funded by tort attorney
William Lerach and other plaintiffs'
lawyers, would make it easier for
shareholders to file these opportunistic
suits in California. The effect of legal
izing frivolous lawsuits in California is

that all of these lawsuits from other
states will find their way into our
courtrooms, at our expense.
Arthur Levitt, chair of the Securities
Exchange Commission, said congres
sional reforms encourage companies to
"provide investors with valuable for
ward-looking information." With Prop.
211, "Companies will likely refrain
from providing important projections
due to an increased fear of frivolous lit
igation. That would be a step backward
for the one in three American.house
holds that invest in our markets."
It would also be step backward for
the small businesses at the heart of Sil
icon Valley, which will not be able to
succeed because they will not be able to
entice investors with predictions for
fear of litigation.
Four critical points are hidden in
Prop. 211. One, Prop. 211 allows
investors to sue companies if their
stock does not perform exactly as they
predicted. These lawsuits have been
brought up against half of the top 150
Silicon Valley firms including Sun
Microsystems, Silicon Graphics and
Apple Computer. Are half of America's
high-tech firms fraudulent? No, the
reason so many of these suits are filed
against them is that the high-tech field
is risky and volatile. It is easy for stock
prices not to track a firm's expecta
tions. Prop. 211 allows investors to sue
companies if the investors' risky
investments do not pay off.
Two, Prop. 211 shifts the burden of
proof in these cases to the defendant!
Therefore, Prop. 211 is overriding the
"innocent until proven guilty" rule
that is key to the American legal sys
tem.
Three, the proposition does not
allow companies to pay the costs if
their executives are sued. This will
cause companies to move their head
quarters to other states to avoid losing
top executives.
Four, only lawyers get any money
from awarded punitive damages, not
retirees.
Current law already allows retire
ment groups and plans to sue for fraud
through their third-party investors. We
are already protected. If Prop. 211 is
supposed to protect us, why do only
lawyers get any money from awarded
punitive damages? Why does the propo
sition contain a clause that prohibits
the state from limiting attorney fees?
Prop. 211 does not protect us from
securities fraud, it makes us vulnerable
to tort attorney fraud. Vote no on
Prop. 211.

A liberal questions 209

LAST MONDAY NIGHT'S debate
between Dinesh D'Souza and
Jesse Jackson brought up many
excellent points in the affirmative action
debate. I was particularly impressed by
D'Souza's well-articulated defense of
Proposition 209. From previous dialogue
on campus and in The Daily, I had been
convinced that Prop. 209 was untenable;
unfair inequalities along racial lines still
exist as historical carry-overs, and affir
mative action, though flawed, works to
rectify these inequalities.
D'Souza pointed out a major flaw in
this line of thinking, namely that the
historical racial oppressor, the white
male, is now less successful than both
Jewish and Asian Americans in terms of
academics and average income. The rea
son for this, stated D'Souza, is that
racial discrimination is no longer the
determining factor it once was. More
important than race is what D'Souza
calls a group's culture of achievement,
which is basically its work ethic. Because
this culture is determined more along
socioeconomic lines than racial ones,
D'Souza advocates replacing racial pref
erence with preference to the equally
qualified but poorer job or college appli
cant. D'Souza also suggests that we
should focus our energies toward pro
moting change at the socioeconomic
level, on problems such as drastically
unequal school systems, instead of along
racial lines. Jackson strangely failed to
address this argument.
D'Souza's arguments, however, are
far from unassailable. One of the
strongest points against D'Souza's posi
tion is our lack of success in addressing
socioeconomic inequalities and our lack

of knowledge in how to better approach
them. D'Souza endorsed school vouchers
as one solution, but the voucher pro
gram is far from noncontroversial and
far from being implemented. In truth,
neither party has much of a grip on solu
tions to these problems. To therefore
encourage the abolition of affirmative
action without actively promoting an
improved alternative suggests a disin
genuous commitment to the goals of
social justice. For example, why doesn't
Prop. 209 initiate socioeconomic prefer
ence at the same time that it destroys
racial preference?
D'Souza also fails to take into account
affirmative action's longer-run benefits.
African Americans and Hispanics suffer
the most from socioeconomic inequali
ties, yet current policy-makers and other
power holders are white. Affirmative
action helps these minority groups to
reach positions of power more quickly
and thus, in the long run, facilitates new
and more effective approaches to socioe
conomic problems, the problems which
D'Souza rightly considers most impor
tant.
D'Souza forced me to replace my lib
eral instinct with deeper thinking. He
also pointed out many of the flaws in
affirmative action as it now stands. In
the end, however, D'Souza proves lack
ing in real commitment to the goals of
social justice. Despite increasingly obvi
ous costs, it is affirmative action's bene
fits that still hold the most weight. Prop.
209 and all efforts to end affirmative
action should be voted down until a bet
ter alternative is ready to be implement
ed.

Asian-American group
calls for vote against
Proposition 209
WE, THE OFFICER core of the
Asian American Students
Association, are writing to
inform you of our opposition to Propo
sition 209. As officers of Stanford's
largest Asian-Pacific American politi
cal, cultural and social organization, we
believe that Prop. 209 poses an imme
diate threat to the Asian-Pacific Ameri
can community and the community at
large through eliminating equal oppor
tunity programs in the public sector.
Because the wording of Prop. 209 is
vague, its full effects are not yet clearly
understood, but it will eliminate all
affirmative action and outreach pro
grams to women and minorities. This
could also potentially include the elimi
nation of funding for women's and eth
nic centers and women's and ethnic
studies programs in California univer
sities and colleges.
As a community that has tradition
ally remained silent on political issues,
we must now speak out against this
attack on civil rights. Nationwide, civil
rights leaders and organizations,
women's groups and other communi
ties of color are publicly expressing
their opposition to Prop. 209.
We have chosen to denounce Prop.
209 despite the divisiveness of the
issue of affirmative action within the
Asian-Pacific American community for
several reasons. We strongly believe
that Prop. 209 will do nothing to reme
dy the underrepresentation of Asian-
Pacific Americans in higher education,
employment and government contract
ing.
Many Asian Americans claim that
affirmative action offers admission to
less qualified students from other
minority groups, in effect excluding
Asians or "taking away our spots."
Contrary to popular belief, affirmative
action is not quotas or the hiring or
admission of unqualified applicants
simply because of the color of their
skin. Affirmative action programs seek
to provide women and minorities with
the opportunity to gain access to
schools, employment and government
contracts.
While it may appear that affirmative
action harms Asians in the school
admissions process, we must note the
overall representation of Asians in
higher education. For example, at
Stanford, Asians make up about 25

percent of the total student population,
and in schools such as UC-Berkeley, 45
percent of the student body is of Asian-
Pacific Islander descent. Despite these
high numbers, groups such as Pacific
Islanders and Southeast Asians are
still underrepresented. Also, at the
graduate level, Asian-Pacific Americans
make up only 15 percent of graduate
students at UC-Berkeley and are
underrepresented in many graduate
fields. Asian-Pacific Americans make
up only 10 percent of tenure track fac
ulty within California's public universi
ties and colleges. Affirmative action
programs in the past have doubled the
graduate student population within the
UC system and sought to increase the
number of Asian-Pacific Americans fac
ulty on UC campuses.
But that's not all. Affirmative action
extends far beyond the admissions pro
cess. It also affects employment and
government contracting, areas in
which Asian-Pacific Americans are still
underrepresented. For example, U.S.-
born Asian-American men are 7 per
cent to 11 percent less likely to be in
managerial positions than white men
with the same education, work experi
ence, English ability and industry
work. Asian-Pacific Americans with
college degrees make 11 percent less
than their white counterparts, and
Asian-Pacific American women make,
on average, 40 percent less than simi
larly educated white men.
Furthermore, Prop. 209 has a lot of
consequences that cannot be seen with

nic resource centers and ethnic studies
programs, such as Asian-American
resource centers and Asian-American
studies programs at state colleges and
