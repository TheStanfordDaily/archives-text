A liberal questions 209

LAST MONDAY NIGHT'S debate
between Dinesh D'Souza and
Jesse Jackson brought up many
excellent points in the affirmative action
debate. I was particularly impressed by
D'Souza's well-articulated defense of
Proposition 209. From previous dialogue
on campus and in The Daily, I had been
convinced that Prop. 209 was untenable;
unfair inequalities along racial lines still
exist as historical carry-overs, and affir
mative action, though flawed, works to
rectify these inequalities.
D'Souza pointed out a major flaw in
this line of thinking, namely that the
historical racial oppressor, the white
male, is now less successful than both
Jewish and Asian Americans in terms of
academics and average income. The rea
son for this, stated D'Souza, is that
racial discrimination is no longer the
determining factor it once was. More
important than race is what D'Souza
calls a group's culture of achievement,
which is basically its work ethic. Because
this culture is determined more along
socioeconomic lines than racial ones,
D'Souza advocates replacing racial pref
erence with preference to the equally
qualified but poorer job or college appli
cant. D'Souza also suggests that we
should focus our energies toward pro
moting change at the socioeconomic
level, on problems such as drastically
unequal school systems, instead of along
racial lines. Jackson strangely failed to
address this argument.
D'Souza's arguments, however, are
far from unassailable. One of the
strongest points against D'Souza's posi
tion is our lack of success in addressing
socioeconomic inequalities and our lack

of knowledge in how to better approach
them. D'Souza endorsed school vouchers
as one solution, but the voucher pro
gram is far from noncontroversial and
far from being implemented. In truth,
neither party has much of a grip on solu
tions to these problems. To therefore
encourage the abolition of affirmative
action without actively promoting an
improved alternative suggests a disin
genuous commitment to the goals of
social justice. For example, why doesn't
Prop. 209 initiate socioeconomic prefer
ence at the same time that it destroys
racial preference?
D'Souza also fails to take into account
affirmative action's longer-run benefits.
African Americans and Hispanics suffer
the most from socioeconomic inequali
ties, yet current policy-makers and other
power holders are white. Affirmative
action helps these minority groups to
reach positions of power more quickly
and thus, in the long run, facilitates new
and more effective approaches to socioe
conomic problems, the problems which
D'Souza rightly considers most impor
tant.
D'Souza forced me to replace my lib
eral instinct with deeper thinking. He
also pointed out many of the flaws in
affirmative action as it now stands. In
the end, however, D'Souza proves lack
ing in real commitment to the goals of
social justice. Despite increasingly obvi
ous costs, it is affirmative action's bene
fits that still hold the most weight. Prop.
209 and all efforts to end affirmative
action should be voted down until a bet
ter alternative is ready to be implement
ed.
