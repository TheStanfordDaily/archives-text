# Members of Greek community say probation has few effects

"No Party Tonight" read the banners hang
ing from the windows of the Sigma Chi fraterni
ty house on Mayfield Avenue. The sign went up
last week and will stay there until the Sigma
Chis' social probation ends Dec. 31, according to
senior Christian Nicks, the fraternity's presi
dent.
The fraternity was placed on probation Sept.
22 after throwing a party during Orientation. In
a letter written last month to the fraternity,
Dean of Students Marc Wais cited the Sigma
Chis' "lack of responsible planning and on-site

management" at the party.
The sanctions against the Sigma Chis, many
fraternity members feel, are harsher than sanc
tions have been against other fraternities in the
past. The effects of probation, fraternity mem
bers say, aside from the obvious — that they
can't throw parties — are few.
"In the past probation hasn't really affected
Rush numbers," said senior Craig Thomas,
president of the Interfraternity Council and a
Sigma Chi. "In my opinion, it helps a fraternity
come together internally."
Putting a fraternity on probation, gives its
members a chance to improve areas of concern,
according to Heather Dunn, assistant director

of the Office of Student Activities.
"I think that a fraternity gets out of it what
they put into it," Dunn said. "It's a time of self
reflection. The chapters I have talked to said
that it was an opportunity to build brotherhood
and become better fraternities."
After sending the Sigma Chis' case to the
Greek Judicial Board — a group of students and
administrators set up several years ago to evalu
ate Greek disciplinary issues — Wais told The
Daily that he carefully considered the board's
recommendation. The board suggested the fra
ternity organize a party-planning forum for
other fraternities, promise to fol
low the party-planning guidelines
and promote Safe Van, the Sigma
Chis' on-campus safe ride pro
gram.
Wais felt, however, that more
needed to be done, so he placed the
Sigma Chis on a form of social pro
bation which bans them from serv
ing alcohol at any on- or off-campus
functions.
"I want to reiterate that I ac
cepted the entire report and recom
mendation of the Greek [Judicial]
Board," Wais said. "I added to it,
but it's not as though I did it in a
vacuum. Afier putting a lot of
thought into it, I talked with vari
ous officials in the University and I
conducted a review the (judicial 1
board's decisions over the last five
years. 1 did not act impulsively—
the Sigma Chis' response is to be
outraged, but it was a careful,
thoughtful, deliberate decision."
Wais added that the students on
the Greek Judicial Board were very
accepting of his decision to add on
to their recommendation for disci
plinary action against the Sigma
Chis.
"They felt that the sanctions ap
plied were fair, reasonable and ap-
DroDriate " he said.

Fraternity members, however,
feel that the punishment was too
harsh and worry about the kind of
message it sends to the University
community regarding the Greek
Judicial Board.
" I think it says a lot about the re
spect the administration has for
the judicial board and the IKC as a
body," Thomas said. "It sends a
message that the administration is
going to take a harder look at sanc
tions when fraternities mess up
and that they are going to be more
severe."
Wais explained that although
many Greeks felt the sanctions
were too severe, other members of
the University community worried
the Sigma Chis were let off the
hook too easily.
"The probation could have been
that the fraternity could not have
any activities at all," Wais said.
Being on probation, Nicks said
won't have a long-term negative
impact on the fraternity.
"The letter of the law is that
there is to be no alcohol at any
events on or off campus," Nicks
said. "It's not really going to hurt
us; it's just inconvenient."
While their fraternity may not
have been hurt this time, Nicks
said, he worries about what is going
to happen in the future.
"The rules have changed,"
Nicks said. "We're angry at the ad
ministration. We feel it was an un

just response. We are living in a
community under suspicion, and
it's been this way for a long time,
but now it's more intense."
Further, Nicks questioned the
Office of Student Activities' new
party-planning guidelines.
"The way they are called party
planning guidelines is confusing,"
Nicks said. "Are they guidelines or
rules? The Office of Student Activ
ities needs to say explicitly. In real
ity, they sound more like rules."
Both Nicks and Thomas ex
pressed concern that with fewer
on-campus parties more students
will chose to go off campus to drink.
"In my opinion, the University
is cracking down on drinking in
general," Thomas said. "Social pro
bation means that people will look
for things to do outside campus and
may [either] drink and drive 0r...
get into other kinds of trouble. The
campus is a sheltered place with
people around to look out for the
students' well-being."
The University clearly recog
nizes such concerns, Wais said, and
is working on a plan to better ad
dress them.
"There is a lot of concern and
frustration concerning three is
sues — alcohol, parties and police
intervention," Wais said. "We are
looking at a variety of strategies to
better address them. It's hard
when there is a law that allows
people to get married, to go to war

for their country and to vote but
not to drink alcohol. I cannot
guarantee that students will not
be cited or arrested on this cam
pus."
Contrary to rumors, Wais said,
the University feels that the Greek
system is important to Stanford.
"A lot of people think that the
administration is out to get the
Greeks, and that is simply not
true," he said. "We have stated di
rectly in a variety of forms that we
want to strengthen Greek life on
the campus."
With tension building between
administrators and Greeks, the
Sigma Chis' banner, Nicks said, is
their way of reminding people the
sanctions against their fraternity
were simply too harsh.
"It's unfortunate," Dunn said.
"It just perpetuates the stereotypes
that all fraternities are interested
in is parties. I know that this fra
ternity does a lot of other really
great things but this puts the focus
on parties."
Dunn added that she hopes to
talk more with the Sigma Chis and
move forward.
The purpose of the sign, howev
er, Nicks said is to attract the cam
pus' attention to their situation.
"We don't want people to forget
about what happened to us," Nicks
said. "It's really just a small thing
— we're exercising our right of free
speech."
