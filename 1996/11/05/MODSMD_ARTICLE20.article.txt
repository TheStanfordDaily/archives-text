# Tuesday Thoughts: Alcohol Policy
## Dean strives for safety 
### 
Recently,
use of
alcohol
and other impor
tant related
issues (such as
on-campus par
ties, police inter
vention and
Greek life) have

received extensive media coverage
and have been the subject of much
student discussion at Stanford. I
am hoping this commentary can
perhaps clarify my position on
these subjects as dean of students.
As dean, let me begin by saying
I am very concerned by the current
student perception of these alco
hol-related issues. I am also con
cerned that policies and practices
affecting these issues may not
have been clearly articulated and
implemented. It is my belief that
many members of the campus
community are receiving inaccu
rate and sometimes confusing
messages from various sources
throughout the campus communi
ty-
It seems to me that a number of
developments which have taken
place at roughly the same time
have brought these issues to the
forefront and contributed to the
growing sense of confusion and
frustration for students, student
stafT and University staff.
Many people believe that the
recent focus on these issues actual
ly began with a shooting incident
at a party held at Tresidder Union
in February. I note for the record
that it was later discovered that
the overwhelming majority of peo
ple attending this party were not
Stanford students, and in fact, the
shooter and his victim were not
Stanford students. In response to
the overall concerns raised by this
event, Vice Provost and Dean for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds
convened a committee made up of
students, faculty and staff (and co
chaired by a student), to review
and modify the Party Planning
Guidelines. The primary intent of
the committee was to address how
large parties were planned and
promoted and to create a process
and environment conducive to safe
and successful on-campus parties.
This process produced the cur
rent Party Planning Guidelines
which went into effect this quar
ter. These guidelines classified par
ties, based on their magnitude and
venue, into five distinct levels. The
new guidelines also now require
hosts of parties classified in the
second to fifth levels to attend
required Party Planning Work
shops and notify Stanford Police
and / or the Office of Student
Activities of campus parties within
two days or two weeks of the event,
depending on the size of the party.
While these new guidelines
were being articulated on campus,
students were made aware of other

major initiatives. An Alcohol Task
Force and a Greek Life Task Force
were convened last year with the
hope of completing the majority of
their work by the end of this quar
ter. Although these task forces
have tried to engage the campus
community in public dialogue con
cerning their respective charges,
are well-represented with students
and have not generated or made
public any formal recommenda
tions, it is my opinion that some
students view their establishment
with some degree of skepticism
and suspicion.
It appears to me that these feel
ings of suspicion held by some stu
dents have been heightened by the
involvement of Student Affairs
staff and Stanford Police in closing
down two high-profile Greek par
ties — hosted by Sigma Chi and
Delta Kappa Epsilon — very early
in the quarter before classes even
began. Moreover, it is my opinion,
after many discussions with resi
dent students, resident assistants
and University staff, in addition to
reviewing documented incidents,

that Stanford Police have been
more visible and active in mon
itoring and intervening in

dorm house parties.

All of these aforemen
tioned forces have con

verged at one time to cre
ate a degree of tension

between Stanford and
some of its students that
makes me very uneasy.

I personally believe
that the overwhelming
majority of Stanford
students who choose
to drink, drink
responsibly and act
responsibly. The Uni
versity is emphatic in
not seeking to drive
drinking behind
closed doors or off
campus. Moreover,
we do not want to
compromise the role
of the resident assis
tant and the relation
ship between the RA
and his or her com
munity. However, stu
dents need to recog
nize they are not

immune to the law on
the Stanford campus. If

they engage in any activ
ity that violates the law,
they are subject to being
cited or arrested, just as

are faculty, staff and visi
tors to the campus. Stanford
cannot and should not con

done or facilitate underage
drinking. As an educational
institution, this would be inap

propriate, irresponsible and just
plain wrong.
However, I realize that some
underage college students will

IT IS THE policy of the University to
maintain a drug-free workplace and cam
pus. The unlawful manufacture, distribu
tion, dispensation, possession and / or use of
controlled substances or the unlawful posses
sion, use or distribution of alcohol is prohib
ited on the Stanford campus, in the work
place or as part of any of the University's
activities. The workplace and campus are pre
sumed to include all Stanford premises where
the activities of the University are conducted.
Violation of this policy may result in disci
plinary sanctions up to and including termi
nation of employment or expulsion of stu
dents. Violations may also be referred to the
appropriate authorities for prosecution. This
policy will be reviewed at least biennially.

Substances and Alcohol"


drink. Stanford is not unique in this
regard. As an educational institu
tion, it seems to me that we should
focus our primary attention on edu
cating students regarding alcohol
use while also preventing alcohol
abuse. This, in fact, has always been
a Stanford priority and is clearly ar
ticulated within its policy state
ment.
It is my personal belief that the
concerns underpinning our cur
rent situation can best be ad
dressed as a community issue. All
of us (students, faculty, RAs, resi
dent fellows, police, residence
deans, Student Affairs staff and
others), need to work together to
better understand our respective
roles in creating an environment
on campus in which students can
host and participate in safe and

successful parties without police
intervention. I believe all of us
would like to see this as a final out
come of this situation.
In order to achieve this end, the
University will be implementing a
variety of initiatives, including a re
view of the current Party Planning
Guidelines (which were never writ
ten in stone), a review of the role of
University stafT and police in artic
ulating, implementing and enforc
ing the Party Planning Guidelines
and an extensive outreach effort to
better communicate with students
on these important issues.
As dean, I would like to ask for
the help of all concerned students,
faculty and staff in working togeth
er to achieve the aforementioned
final outcome regarding this mat
ter. In doing so, I believe we would
also be reaffirming Stanford as a
caring, trusting and respectful com
munity.

Marc Wais is the dean of students.
