DUNN.WAIS AND HOWE:
It sounds like a law firm,
but the closest they've
come to justice is law enforce
ment.
Between Asst. Director of the
Office of Student Activities
Heather Dunn, who has a bad
habit r,f calling the police and then
pretending it was someone else
(what she meant to say was she
"wished" it was an anonymous
phone call), and Dean of Students
Marc Wais, who still maintains he
is not cracking down on fraterni
ties despite giving Sigma Chi a
completely out-of-proportion pun
ishment for breaking an imaginary
"rule," who even needs Nanci
Howe, director of the Office of Stu
dent Activities?
Well, I have a message for
Dunn, Wais and Howe from the
student body: Stop insulting our
intelligence; you're not fooling any
one.
Contrary to existing Universi
ty alcohol policy, there are only
two ways to deal with the alco

hoi "problem": 1) Erect such
strict punishments — such

as expulsion — that fear
will eliminate the incen

tive to drink (or really, to
get caught drinking), or

2) Be realistic and
accept the fact that it is

impossible to control
alcohol consumption
and then find the

best way to mini

mize the problems
that alcohol can
bring about.

The first option,
affectionately
known as "Stupid
Idea," is the only

way to effectively
stop underage
drinking. Under
the current policy,
each time the
police invade a fra
ternity party, four
or five people —
students that are
no different from

any other inebriat
ed minor in atten
dance — are arbi
trarily singled out
and given minor in

possession citations.
All the other fresh
men run for cover and

return to the safety of
their dorms where they
have unsupervised

access to hard alcohol
instead of the barely
potent Natural Light.

Interesting. Is this what the
University really intended?

This happens because the
_• 1 A * • 1 __ . A 1 V

f punishment is simply not harsh
enough to discourage the act,

which in essence makes it com
pletely useless. However, if the
penalty for getting caught drinking

was receiving the
title of "ex-Stan
ford student,"
then not only
would people stop
drinking on the
Farm, they
wouldn't even
bring alcohol any
where near their
dorms. Instead,

they would go ofT-campus and out
of the University's sight, ensuring
both a dramatic reduction in the
sense of community (it's hard to
mix and meet people if you leave
with a few friends to go to the local
mght club) and a tragic increase in
drunk-driving accidents.
In light of this and the clear
inequity of the prescribed punish
ment, it becomes obvious that
despite the goal of an alcohol-free
campus, the University should
instead address the second option
and start reviving a positive social
life for its students.
The administration should focus
on expanding the SURE Escort
Service and spending more time
educating students about the dan
gers of alcohol and acting irrespon
sibly at parties. This means doing a
lot more than posting some fliers
around campus; it is a painful pro
cess, as most people have no desire
to listen to speakers or attend
workshops, but little by little, as
they become more and more inun
dated with information, it will
make a difference.
Fraternity parties will continue
and occasionally the system will
break down, but the alternatives to
accepting reality have conse
quences that make the "moral
stand against alcohol" impractical.
Students cannot be forced to
change their ways by an overzeal
ous policy that will only make
things worse; behavior will only
change if students make that deci
sion on their own, a possibility that
is not out of reach-
Basically, people will drink; the
only way to effectively combat this
perceived social "ill" is to preach
responsibility and educate the stu
dent population so that the detri
mental effects of alcohol consump
tion are minimized; the answer is
not to embrace a half-hearted
attempt of deterrence with rules
and regulations that accomplish
nothing but inadvertent, inconsis
tent punishment and negative
feelings toward the administra
tion.
It's time to return to reason and
understand that it is impossible to
stop all underage drinking. Educa
tion and emphasizing responsibili
ty, however, are realistic goals to
curb alcohol abuse and related
issues, which is the true way to cre
ate a more responsible — and satis
fying — social life.
