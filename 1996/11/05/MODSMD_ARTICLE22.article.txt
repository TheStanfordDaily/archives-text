# American policy: Drink to get drunk
## 
### 
WHEN I FIRST arrived at
this University from Eng
land, I was amazed by
America's strange drinking policy.
The disparity between the drink
ing age and the voting age seems to
indicate that America considers
political decisions that shape the
world to be less important than
the decision to drink until bubbles

" come out of your ears. This prud
ish attitude toward alcohol is mirrored in Stan
ford's administration, an attitude that ultimately
harms the people it means to protect.
The real sacrifice America makes in deciding
when its youth can drink is social drinking. Once
alcohol becomes forbidden, it and its physical
effects become special. Drinking becomes an ends,
not a means, since people don't have any other
activity to attach it to.
The American drinking tale typically emphasizes
the extent to which the storyteller was drunk, as evi
denced by the accompanying vomiting and subse
quent hangover. The main flaw with such experiences
is that they can be easily replicated — much less
expensively — by sticking two fingers down your
throat and hitting yourself over the head with a crow
bar. I don't claim that in England drinking to get
drunk never happens, but at least an alternative use
of alcohol is offered. A tight drinking policy oflen only
results in binge drinking — drink as much as you can
of whatever you can get.
My relationship with alcohol changes every time
I cross the Atlantic as a direct result of the differ

ent legal drinking ages. My youth in England was
never marked by a craving for alcohol as much as
American youths seem to be, mainly because it was
never entirely prohibited. From age 16 on, I was
able to drink at my high school's pub. The head
master's farewell party to the seniors was accom
panied by gin cocktails — hardly wild, but it does
make University President Gerhard Casper's "Tea
and Cookies" look distinctly matronly. As a direct
result, I didn't see alcohol as anything special. The
drinking was never as important as the people I
was drinking with. This is precisely what I have
lost by choosing to be educated at Stanford.
I don't miss beer in general. I miss having just
the one beer — having one beer with dinner, over a
conversation, before starting homework. Here,
drinking in moderation is not only out of the ques
tion, it is entirely besides the point.
If Stanford's tightening of the drinking policy is
aimed at increasing compliance to the law, it is
impossible to fault it. However, if it is aimed to
encourage a more responsible attitude to alcohol, it
is flawed. For every student it prevents from drink
ing, it will exacerbate another's already harmful
attitude toward alcohol. The University should
limit alcohol, but at the same time make sure it is
constantly available, not provided for one occasion
to be entirely consumed on that occasion. Happy
hours, connecting alcohol with sociability and not
with inebriation, should be encouraged. The Uni
versity would greatly benefit from associating alco
hol with responsibility, not with criminality.
