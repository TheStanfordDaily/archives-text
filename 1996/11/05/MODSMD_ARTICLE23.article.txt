# Non-drinkers ignored in dorm votes
## 
### 
I DON'T LIKE alcohol. I'll admit it. I don't
need it. I don't need it to be cool, to have fun
at parties; I don't need it to "lower my inhibi
tions." It serves me no purpose. I think it's about
as cool as smoking crack.
I also don't like to see other Stanford students
drink. I don't like to see them get drunk. I don't
like to see them stumble, I don't like to see them
fall, I don't like to see them throw up, I don't like
to see them get raped, and I don't like to see them
try to pick fights with me. (I have seen or been
aware of all of these things happening to me or to
people I know.)
Seeing as how I clearly dislike alcohol, it would
seem obvious that I would rather not purchase it.
I'm sure that I am not the only Stanford student
who feels this way. The unfortunate truth is that
many times people just like me are forced to pur
chase alcohol against our will.
This injustice happens at the beginning of
every year here at Stanford, in almost every dorm.
The occurrence is so commonplace that we have
gotten used to it, and we even have a name for it.
The name? Why, "voting on the dorm alcohol pol
icy," of course.
I believe the procedures used for determining
whether or not dorms should purchase alcohol
using social-fund moneys is unfair. I have been at
Stanford two years, and both years my dorms
have voted to purchase alcohol. These votes were
said to be "majority rules." Both times, more than

50 percent of the dorm has voted
to use house funds to purchase
alcohol.
Both times, I told everyone
that this was not fair, but both
times I was ignored. Although I
acknowledge the fact that stu
dents have the right to drink,
they don't have the right to do so
using my money.

I don't like knowing that my money is purchas
ing a product which will allow students to drown
their worries, to get taken advantage of and to
regret it all the next morning.
I have no delusions of grandeur; all I want is for
University alcohol policy to be slightly changed.
Instead of doing a "majority rules" vote, why not
have a separate, voluntary alcohol fund, so stu
dents can contribute if they choose to and not be
forced to do so? This system worked at Xanadu a
couple years ago, and I'm sure it could work else
where, too. To some this might sound like an
unnecessary hassle, but it is the only way to
respect the rights of all parties involved: those
who want to buy alcohol and those who would
rather not, for whatever reason. It is time to learn
to respect the wishes of all students, even those of
us whose voices are often drowned by the majori
ty.
