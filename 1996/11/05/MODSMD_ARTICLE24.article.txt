Resident assistants fear role will include policing students' drinking

IN RESPONSE TO recent police
involvement at a variety of campus
parties and the resulting change in
social atmosphere, we would like to express
our concern about the ramifications on the
role of resident assistants within the Uni
versity. The administration and Stanford
Police purport to maintain the best inter
est of students as their highest priority.
RAs are the University's emissaries in this
pursuit; we have the unique perspective of
understanding student concerns while we
attempt to create the best possible living
and working environment.

However, this task has become increas
ingly difficult. We have heard what the
University says about alcohol policies and
enforcement not changing, but we have
also seen that there has been a fundamen
tal shift in police activity on campus. This
has led to increasing student frustration
and fear which we share. We can tell our
residents of Police Chief Marv Herring
ton's assurances to the Row RAs that
nothing is different, but we are experienc
ing a different reality. The University
needs to be honest about these changes.
This vear the Office of Student Activi

ties published a set of Party Planning
"Guidelines" that now appear to have
become "Rules." We were led to under
stand that the objective of these guidelines
was to inform students about how to plan
safe parties. Student Activities now asks
that we report any party that occurs out
side of a student room at least 48 hours in
advance (for a "members only" party) to 14
days (for parties open to all Stanford stu
dents). The office then passes this informa
tion on to the police, who recently appear
to have been using these reports as invita
tions to enter parties to ensure control.

Even more disturbing is the talk of unre
ported parties that have been reprimanded
for not following Student Activities' "sug
gestion" to report. If these guidelines are
just that, suggestions, then we cannot be
faulted for not reporting. If a party is safe
but unreported, will that soon become rea
son enough for the police to intervene?
RAs are University employees and as
such are expected to abide by and educate
students about University policy. But we
cannot do so blindly, without understand
ing what we supposedly espouse. The
greatest tragedy of all would be a change in

the RA role from community builder to
policeman. At Stanford, RAs have the
opportunity to develop student trust; if the
situation continues on its present track,
forcing us to assume an enforcer role, we
will no longer have that chance.
