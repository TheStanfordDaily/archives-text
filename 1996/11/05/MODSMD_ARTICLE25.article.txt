## Waves, Bruins, fall to Card, USC holds up 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's water
polo team (14-5, 5-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation)
traveled to Los Angeles last
weekend with one goal in mind
— to conquer the likes of No. 7
Pepperdine (5-11, 1-5) and No.
2 UCLA (18-2, 4-1) in crucial
conference matchups.
Mission accomplished. The
Cardinal overcame an inspired
Pepperdine squad to vanquish
the Waves 9-8 in triple over
time, then avenged last week's
loss to UCLA with a stunning

7-6 victory.
With its primary objective
complete, the Card faced No. 1
USC Sunday. Less than one
week before the MPSF show
down between the two schools,
the nonconference matchup
provided the Cardinal its first
opportunity to challenge the
Trojans so far this season. The
Stanford men made the most of
it, nearly pulling off the upset
as they lost 6-5.
"We really accomplished all
of our goals — and then some,"
said junior Nathan Osborn.

Stanford won two out of three games in Southern California
this weekend.
"We really proved to ourselves
that we can beat the top teams."
Facing off against Pepperdine
on Friday, the Cardinal struggled
to get going, as both teams failed
to score in the first quarter. While
the Card was narrowly missing
shots in the second quarter, the
Waves were putting it in the net,
and Pepperdine carried a 3-1 lead
into the second half.
Stanford responded in the
third quarter, outscoring the
Waves 4-1. And when sophomore
forward David Hay added a two
point goal early in the fourth
quarter to make it 8-5, it appeared
that the Cardinal would win easi
ly. But Pepperdine freshman hole
man Chris Tilden scored three
goals in the final 2 minutes, 27
seconds to tie the game and send a
shocked Stanford squad to over
time.
After two overtime periods and
a sudden-death period, senior
holeman Brian Wallin ended all
hopes of a Pepperdine upset when
he scored on a penalty shot to give
the Card the win 9-8.
"A lot of our shots just weren't
dropping," Osborn said. "We just
couldn't pull away, though we felt
that we were doing a very good job
at both ends of the pool."
Senior Daniel Lehoczky put the
game into perspective: "Whether
we win big or pull out a sudden

death win, either way its a point
and we're happy to have it."
After a gut-wrenching 7-6 loss
to the Bruins just one week ago,
the Stanford men were hungry for
retribution.
Senior Tyrone Miller took the
initiative at the outset, finding the
back of the net with a quick back
hand shot to give the Cardinal a 1-
0 lead it carried into the second
quarter.
"That goal set the tone for the
rest of the game," said head coach
Dante Dettamanti. "It gave us a
lead which we held nearly the
whole game and put the pressure
on UCLA."
The Stanford squad main
tained that pressure and played
the solid, mistake-free defense
that the situation required.
Up 6-4 with just a few minutes
remaining, the game appeared
remarkably similar to that of last
week, which also had the Cardinal
ahead 6-4 with 2 minutes to play.
But this time Stanford played
conservatively in the offensive
end while containing the Bruins'
counterattack on defense, and
the Card held on to win 7-6.
"The big difference in the game
was our 6-5 play," Dettamanti
said. "We converted four of seven
UCLA ejections to goals, while
holding them to just two of eight."
Despite the temporary loss of
two starters to injury at the hands
of UCLA (sophomore forward
David Hay due to a dislocated fin
ger and freshman Brian Heifferon
due to an ear injury), the Card

challenged top-ranked USC, set
ting the stage for an inspired
MPSF battle this weekend.
"This is the No. 1 team in the
nation," Dettamanti said. "We
briefly held a 3-2 lead and had a
chance to tie it at the end with a
two-point goal."
Stanford had a man-advantage
with under a minute to play in
the final quarter, down 6-4.
Looking to score a two-point goal,
their hopes of tying the game
were lost when USC's Marko
Zagar made the heady play of
interfering with the free throw
following his ejection. The infrac
tion resulted in a penalty shot for
the Cardinal, which is only worth
one point. Though senior Brian
Wallin converted, USC retained
possession of the ball for the
remaining seconds and captured
the victory 6-5.
Key to the Card's success in
Los Angeles was the outstanding
play of sophomore goalie Chris
Aguilera, which garnered him the
honor of MPSF player of the
week.
Over three games against top
ranked opponents, Aguilera com
piled a remarkable 37 saves,
including 14 each against No. 7
Pepperdine and No. 2 UCLA.
"Aguilera was simply phenom
enal," Dettamanti said. "He really
kept us in the games."
"Chris was on fire on defense
— absolutely amazing," Osborn
said. "It does a lot for the defen
sive confidence to have someone
like that behind you in goal."

holding them to just two of eight."
Despite the temporary loss of
two starters to injury at the hands
of UCLA (sophomore forward
David Hay due to a dislocated fin
ger and freshman Brian Heifferon
due to an ear injury), the Card

challenged top-ranked USC, set
ting the stage for an inspired
MPSF battle this weekend.
"This is the No. 1 team in the
nation," Dettamanti said. "We
briefly held a 3-2 lead and had a
chance to tie it at the end with a
two-point goal."
Stanford had a man-advantage
with under a minute to play in
the final quarter, down 6-4.
Looking to score a two-point goal,
their hopes of tying the game
were lost when USC's Marko
Zagar made the heady play of
interfering with the free throw
following his ejection. The infrac
tion resulted in a penalty shot for
the Cardinal, which is only worth
one point. Though senior Brian
Wallin converted, USC retained
possession of the ball for the
remaining seconds and captured
the victory 6-5.
Key to the Card's success in
Los Angeles was the outstanding
play of sophomore goalie Chris
Aguilera, which garnered him the
honor of MPSF player of the
week.
Over three games against top
ranked opponents, Aguilera com
piled a remarkable 37 saves,
including 14 each against No. 7
Pepperdine and No. 2 UCLA.
"Aguilera was simply phenom
enal," Dettamanti said. "He really
kept us in the games."
"Chris was on fire on defense
— absolutely amazing," Osborn
said. "It does a lot for the defen
sive confidence to have someone
like that behind you in goal."
