## Waves, Bruins, fall to Card, USC holds up 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's water
polo team (14-5, 5-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation)
traveled to Los Angeles last
weekend with one goal in mind
— to conquer the likes of No. 7
Pepperdine (5-11, 1-5) and No.
2 UCLA (18-2, 4-1) in crucial
conference matchups.
Mission accomplished. The
Cardinal overcame an inspired
Pepperdine squad to vanquish
the Waves 9-8 in triple over
time, then avenged last week's
loss to UCLA with a stunning

7-6 victory.
With its primary objective
complete, the Card faced No. 1
USC Sunday. Less than one
week before the MPSF show
down between the two schools,
the nonconference matchup
provided the Cardinal its first
opportunity to challenge the
Trojans so far this season. The
Stanford men made the most of
it, nearly pulling off the upset
as they lost 6-5.
"We really accomplished all
of our goals — and then some,"
said junior Nathan Osborn.
