# Soccer wins Pac-10, earns NCAA berth
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
The turnaround is complete.
Two weeks ago, the Stanford women's
soccer team was 7-7, coming off its third
consecutive loss, and in danger of not mak
ing the postseason for the first time in the
'90s.
But that was two weeks ago. Since then,
the Cardinal (11-7, 6-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) has run off four straight victories, all
over Pac-10 opponents, to clinch the con
ference title and a berth in the NCAA tour
nament.
With big wins over rivals USC and
UCLA in Los Angeles last weekend, Stan
ford reasserted itself as the premier pro
gram in the conference. Friday afternoon,
the Cardinal knocked off the Women of
Troy 1-0. Sophomore forward Charmaine
Le√ülanc ended the scoreless tie with under
15 minutes left in the final period on an
unassisted score.
Stanford followed up that effort with a
2-1 overtime win Sunday in front of hun
dreds of Bruins fans. This time it was
senior forwards Emily Burt and Erin Mar
tin pacing the Cardinal.
"We've definitely struggled at times
during the year," said coach Steve Swan
son. "But this team is very resilient, and it
has a lot of character. I knew we'd start
winning, and the great thing about the last
four games is that we're winning as a team.
Everybody is contributing."
Swanson owes his defense and goalie for
much of his team's recent success. The
Cardinal allowed only one goal in two away
games against the most potent teams in
the conference. USC boasts the top goal

scorer in the conference in Isabelle Harvey,
and UCLA's Traci Arkenberg is second.
"Suzie Boots played out of her mind this
weekend," said sophomore midfielder
Christy Stoffel. "She completely shut down
the top two scorers in the Pac-10."
"I think our seniors stepped up on
defense," Swanson said. "Boots, Kim
Houkom and Wendy Latimer all played
very well in the back for us," Swanson said.
Sophomore goalie Erin Bryla was "tough
for us also. If she hadn't come up with a
few great saves, we wouldn't have won
these games."
The offense has also finally started com
ing through for the Cardinal.
"I think the biggest difference between
now and earlier in the season is that we're
scoring on more of our chances," said
senior co-captain Houkom. "That's giving
us more confidence in each other and more
faith in what we're doing."
In addition, with each game counting
for more and more, the whole team seems
to be playing harder.
"We're playing with a lot of intensity for
the whole game now," Martin said. "I'm
not sure we were doing that as much earli
er on."
Against UCLA, the Cardinal came out
very strong. Burt's goal came in the first 15
minutes and gave Stanford an extra push
for the rest of the half. In the second half,
however, the Card tended to sit on its lead
and got away from its attacking style of
play. UCLA took advantage of the passive
Stanford squad and netted the tying goal.
"We played a very good first half,"
Swanson said. "In the second we just tried


Junior midfielder Rita Hermiz and the rest of the
Card claimed the Pac-10 title and earned a berth
to the NCAA tournament with two conference wins
over the weekend.
