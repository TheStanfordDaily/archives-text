# Who talked me into taking this job?

### 
OK, I'll answer that lingering question
you've all wanted to know: Who am I
and why does my face keep appearing on
the sports page with my rambling opinions on
fans, sports and whatever else I choose to write
about?

Here it is — I'm a sports editor and although
the job is not a glamorous one, being able to
write your own columns is one of the perks that
supposedly makes up for the lousy pay.
But seriously, what's really the point? For
some it's a chance to stroke their own egos or
brag about their favorite professional sports
teams, but does anybody really care?
I could easily write week after week about

the incredible farm system of the Atlanta
Braves or their unstoppable pitching rotation or
Andruw Jones, but I won't kid myself into
believing any of you actually care about my
biased opinions on the best baseball team of the
'90s (even if they didn't win the World Series
this time).
However, as a sports editor, it is my right.
But as a caring Stanford student I've vowed not
to force that land of crap on any of my readers
(at least not intentionally).
Seriously though, how often does a sports
column actually say something profound or
Pulitzer-worthy? (I can tell you, it's rare.) So
why bother? Well, the truth of the matter is that
deep down we just love to write. We take enor
mous pride in seeing our mug shot in the paper
accompanying our own words and opinions.
Some of us just have that urge to express to
the masses what's really important in our own
world of sports. OK, maybe not. Usually we just
need something to take up space in the middle
of the week, and this is about the easiest way to
do that.
Don't get me wrong; columns are more valu
able than space filler and being able to write
now and then takes away from the monotonv of

constantly editing other writers' work. But let's
face it, sports columnists are not the deep and
meaningful authority on sports we often like to
think they are.
OK, now that I've gotten that out of my sys
tem, we'll continue. There are some perks to
editing other than writing my own columns.
For example, I no longer have to sneak hidden
messages into my stories, something that's
never an easy task.
I mean, you try starting a paragraph in a
softball story with "Newly tanned ..." just to
get an "N" in the right place. I'm telling you my
editors probably thought I didn't have a clue.
But it's something that I was quite guilty of
in my days as a beat writer. The encouragement
of a good friend prompted me to insert my first
message, and it soon became a ritual. I spent
valuable time rewording and reworking my sto
ries just to get a message across to one invalu
able member of the team.
But I'm proud to say that even with hideous
phrases like the one above, only one message
got corrupted by the editing process. So here it
is, finallv in print after all these months, the one


Robin
Davidson
that got away — "Lindsay plays or
else."
Not that it has tiny relevance in
the present. Lindsay no longer
plays, and I couldn't be taken that
seriously when the sport is not
even in season. But I felt it was
something I had to do.
By now most of you who don't
know who Lindsay is or what this
has to do with anything have prob
ably tuned out. But for those of you
still with me, I'll continue with my
comparison of being a beat writer
vs. an editor.
Editor: Has the abilitv to screw

up any accurate fact in the story
when the writer turns it in and
probably not take the heat.
Writer: Has the ability to
blame any mistake of his own
doing on the idiocy of his editor.
Editor: Knows what's happen
ing in all sports but rarely gets to
see any of them.
Writer: Knows only what's
happening in his own sport but has
interaction with sports figures
other than his computer and the
photos that run in the paper.
Editor: Doesn't have to deal
with the food at Ricker.
Writer: Doesn't have 800
points left on meal plan for the
quarter.
Editor: Has a complete
understanding of the workings

of a newspaper.
Writer: Doesn't have to spend
eight hours a day at The Daily
learning about the workings of a
newspaper.
Editor: Knows Martin Yeung.
Writer: Knows Martin Yeung.
Editor: Gets an office with a
comfortable chair and desk.
Writer: Doesn't need an office
with a comfortable chair.
Editor: Doesn't have to read
The Daily to find out what's in the
paper.
Writer: Reads other stories
only after checking to make sure
his story is just like he wanted it.
Editor: Isn't in it for the
money.
Writer: Definitely isn't in it for
the money.
