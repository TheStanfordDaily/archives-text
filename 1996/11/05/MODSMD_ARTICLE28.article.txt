# Von der Ahe takes his tricks to the water
## 
### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
The water is not blue and
sparkling but dull gray, opaque
and punishingly cold. It is 7
a.m., a time when only fanatics
are awake: swimmers, rowers
and . . . water skiers.
Matt Von der Ahe (pro
nounced von-der-AY), a member
of the Stanford water-ski team,
moves around a small wooden
dock in San Mateo with quick
competence, getting things
ready. The Stanford boat, a
shiny top-of-the-line Master
Craft, was in the shop for two
weeks; now Von der Ahe is eager
to get in the water.

For Von der Ahe, a senior
communication major from San
Juan Capistrano, water skiing is
a family affair. He started at age
6, on the mountain lake where
his grandparents had a cabin.
At first, water skiing was
"just something the family did
for fun," but that changed after
many years of summer vaca
tions.
"I really started skiing a lot —
it was always something I really
loved to do," Von der Ahe said.
He remembers skiing with his
family, including younger broth
er Andy, a junior and his hall
mate in Theta Delta Chi.
"Basically we just tried to
jump the wake as much as we

could," he said.
Some things don't change:
Von der Ahe is still trying to
jump the wake, only higher,
faster and more spectacularly
than any 6-year-old ever could.
On a recent chilly Monday morn
ing, Von der Ahe showed what
he's learned in all those years of
being in the water: a dazzling
display of jumps, flips, turns and
tricks that he's working on for
competition.
Competitive water skiing has
three events: slalom, where the
skier swings wide from the wake
to circle buoys in the water;
jump, where the skier is pulled
at high speeds over and off a
floating ramp; and trick, where

the skier has 20 seconds to be a
hot dog.
For the moment, Von der Ahe
is focusing on tricks and ignor
ing the other two events. He
wears a wetsuit to keep out the
frigid water and rides a wake
board, a cross between a skate
board and a snowboard with
squared-off, angular edges.
As the boat roars into high
speed, Von der Ahe stands up
and begins his routine; he jumps
the wake, "gets air" high above
the water, changes the direction
of his board in midair, rides the
crest of the wake and then
launches into a series of flips,
spectacular laid-out somersaults
off the wake that end with him
standing upright in the water.
It's tremendously exciting to
watch.
"Matt's the best wake boarder
we have," said Todd Takken, a
graduate student and fellow
member of the Stanford team,
who was driving the boat. "He's
the only one I've ever seen who
can land that thing."
For the next several runs,
Von der Ahe works on a bel air, a
"laid-out backflip done off the
surface instead of the wake,"
where the skier takes off from
the back side edge of the board.
The trick looks hellaciously diffi
cult, and Von der Ahe falls, land
ing hard with a big splash on the
first try. And the second. And
the third. And the fourth.
Each time, he considers the
move in the water, analyzing
what he did and how to improve
it. He gets some advice from the
boat about his takeoff and his
position in the air; then he gets
up and tries it again And again.
And again.
This tenacious persistence is
what makes Von der Ahe so

good. In explaining how to
improve as a water skier, he
says, "You have to do it a lot,
and listen to people who can tell
you what you're doing. But try
ing is a big thing — you can't
stick to what you know, and you
can't be afraid to fall."
He certainly is not afraid to
fall. Von der Ahe goes water ski
ing "as much as I can — right
now, about four times a week."
He's gone four times this

weekend alone, skiing for hours
at a time and trying new tricks
each day. He hits one flip consis
tently, a stunning front somer
sault done off the curve of the
wake; he learned it Saturday.
"I usually work on about five
tricks at a time," Von der Ahe
said. "I just keep trying a trick
until I know I have it — then I
move on."
Von der Ahe doesn't know
exactly what he'll do next year:
"maybe freelance, write or work
for a board company." He's flirt
ed with the idea of joining the
pro water-skiing tour or the
fledgling pro wake boarding

tour.
"It's definitely an idea that's
in the back of my head, but at
this point it's more of a pipe
dream," he said.
If he feels like he can improve
consistently and ski enough to
get to that level, the pipe dream
may begin to appear a more solid
reality. Until then, however,
Von der Ahe will continue to
come out to this finger-shaped
tributary, where pelicans flap by
weeping willows to the sound of
the traffic on Highway 101 and
keep doing what he loves to do:
take risks, try hard and throw
spectacular jumps.
