# Water-skiing anyone?

People at Stanford have
such a wide variety of talents
and interests that it shouldn't
surprise anyone to learn that
Stanford has its own water-ski
team.
For many years, however,
Stanford didn't have a club for
people who loved this sport.
Before Adrian Osborn, Class
of '96, established the club
three years ago, there hadn't
been any water skiing at Stan
ford since the '70s, when peo
ple practiced on Lake Laguni
ta. Now the club has grown,
and Stanford competes regu
larly in tournaments in the
region.
Water-ski tournaments con
sist of three events. The first is
slalom. The boat follows a set
course and pulls a 3kier who
must weave in and out of six
buoys.
After each successful trip,
the boat increases its speed
until it reaches the maximum
speed (34 mph for women, 36
mph for men). At this point,
the rope is shortened, and
then the skier does another
series of faster and faster
runs.
The second event is trick
skiing. In this event, the con
testants have 20 seconds to do
a routine of 360-degree jumps,
wake jumps, toe holds or any
assortment of dexterity-com
manding moves.
In recent years, wake
boarding, a mixture of water

skiing and surfing, has
become popular, and trick
skiers have the option of using
a wake board in competition
instead of a trick ski if they
wish. Generally, a wake board
allows for more aerials and
rolls while a trick ski allows
for more tricks requiring a
free back foot.
The third event is jumping.
Skiers are pulled at high
speeds toward a 12-foot ramp
and then must jump as far as
possible and land safely.
This event requires the
most nerve and has "the
biggest rush," according to
junior Chad Hegle. Jumping is
known for causing the most
water-skiing accidents. In
fact, Hegle was injured this
summer in a jumping acci
dent.
Tournaments take up
whole weekends and consist of
lots of sun and water. As
Hegle said, the circuit is like a
"traveling party" of 200 peo
ple who enjoy water skiing.
The water-ski season starts
in the spring and continues
until the fall. There are usual
ly about eight tournaments in
the spring and five in the fall.
However, since classes at
Stanford start so late, school is
only in session for two or three
of those fall tournaments.
Stanford is a member of the
National Collegiate Water-ski
Association, and competes
with other schools in the west
