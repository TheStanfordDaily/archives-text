# Water-skiing anyone?
## Sport growing fast here on the Farm

People at Stanford have
such a wide variety of talents
and interests that it shouldn't
surprise anyone to learn that
Stanford has its own water-ski
team.
For many years, however,
Stanford didn't have a club for
people who loved this sport.
Before Adrian Osborn, Class
of '96, established the club
three years ago, there hadn't
been any water skiing at Stan
ford since the '70s, when peo
ple practiced on Lake Laguni
ta. Now the club has grown,
and Stanford competes regu
larly in tournaments in the
region.
Water-ski tournaments con
sist of three events. The first is
slalom. The boat follows a set
course and pulls a 3kier who
must weave in and out of six
buoys.
After each successful trip,
the boat increases its speed
until it reaches the maximum
speed (34 mph for women, 36
mph for men). At this point,
the rope is shortened, and
then the skier does another
series of faster and faster
runs.
The second event is trick
skiing. In this event, the con
testants have 20 seconds to do
a routine of 360-degree jumps,
wake jumps, toe holds or any
assortment of dexterity-com
manding moves.
In recent years, wake
boarding, a mixture of water

skiing and surfing, has
become popular, and trick
skiers have the option of using
a wake board in competition
instead of a trick ski if they
wish. Generally, a wake board
allows for more aerials and
rolls while a trick ski allows
for more tricks requiring a
free back foot.
The third event is jumping.
Skiers are pulled at high
speeds toward a 12-foot ramp
and then must jump as far as
possible and land safely.
This event requires the
most nerve and has "the
biggest rush," according to
junior Chad Hegle. Jumping is
known for causing the most
water-skiing accidents. In
fact, Hegle was injured this
summer in a jumping acci
dent.
Tournaments take up
whole weekends and consist of
lots of sun and water. As
Hegle said, the circuit is like a
"traveling party" of 200 peo
ple who enjoy water skiing.
The water-ski season starts
in the spring and continues
until the fall. There are usual
ly about eight tournaments in
the spring and five in the fall.
However, since classes at
Stanford start so late, school is
only in session for two or three
of those fall tournaments.
Stanford is a member of the
National Collegiate Water-ski
Association, and competes
with other schools in the west
ern region. This region includes
19 teams from Washington, Ore
gon, Arizona and California. Ari
zona State is usually the high
est-ranked school in the region,
as it has the strongest program
and even offers scholarships for
water skiing.
Recently, the Stanford team
attended a tournament held in
Bel Aqua and hosted by UC-
Davis. Both the men's and
women's teams made a good
showing. The men placed sixth
in slalom, fifth in tricks, sixth in
jumping and seventh overall.
Senior Matt Von der Ahe did
extremely well, placing third in
tricks and fifth overall. The
women's squad finished fourth
in slalom, third in tricks, fifth in
jumping and third overall.
Junior Erin Thompson, a con
ference all-star last year, put in
an excellent performance placing

second overall — fifth in slalom,
fifth in tricks, fourth in jumping.
However, most of the people
in the club water ski recreation
ally, and many had never skied
before joining. Most of those
that do ski in competitions did
not do so before coming to col
lege. Von der Ahe described the
team as "young and energetic."
Membership varies every
quarter. Right now there are 29
members. This is likely to drop
in the winter but then jump up
to 40-plus members in the
spring, the main season.
The team is "talented, consid
ering the fact that it is not even
an official club sport," Thomp
son said.
Both undergraduate and
graduate students are involved
in this club, and faculty mem
bers have been involved, too.
The team practices year-round
in Marina Lagoon in San Mateo,
just off Highway 101. During
practices, there are three or four
people in the boat who take
turns skiing for 15 minutes at a

time. They coach each other, as
they have no active coaching
staff other than the profession
als that are hired to run clinics.
The water-ski team gets no
financial support from Stanford
and is not even acknowledged as
a club sport by the University. It
is entirely student-run. Even
though water skiing gets fewer
injuries than the varsity and
intramural sports which Stan
ford supports, it involves a
motorized vehicle and is there
fore too much of a liability.
Instead, the wa{er-ski squad
is sponsored by Cope and
McPhetre's, a speed boat dealer
ship in Santa Clara that supplies
the squad with a new water boat
every year. Caring for this
$20,000-plus piece of equipment
is one of the main responsibili
ties of Hegle, who is president of
the team. In addition to making
sure people can water ski suc
cessfully now, he hopes that
foundations are being laid so
that the team will last far into
the future.

The team is "talented, consid
ering the fact that it is not even
an official club sport," Thomp
son said.
Both undergraduate and
graduate students are involved
in this club, and faculty mem
bers have been involved, too.
The team practices year-round
in Marina Lagoon in San Mateo,
just off Highway 101. During
practices, there are three or four
people in the boat who take
turns skiing for 15 minutes at a

time. They coach each other, as
they have no active coaching
staff other than the profession
als that are hired to run clinics.
The water-ski team gets no
financial support from Stanford
and is not even acknowledged as
a club sport by the University. It
is entirely student-run. Even
though water skiing gets fewer
injuries than the varsity and
intramural sports which Stan
ford supports, it involves a
motorized vehicle and is there
fore too much of a liability.
Instead, the wa{er-ski squad
is sponsored by Cope and
McPhetre's, a speed boat dealer
ship in Santa Clara that supplies
the squad with a new water boat
every year. Caring for this
$20,000-plus piece of equipment
is one of the main responsibili
ties of Hegle, who is president of
the team. In addition to making
sure people can water ski suc
cessfully now, he hopes that
foundations are being laid so
that the team will last far into
the future.
