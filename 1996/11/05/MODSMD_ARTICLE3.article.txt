### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
The long-awaited Polio Rey restaurant will open
in Tresidder Union Monday, allowing Stanford stu
dents to satisfy their cravings for Mexican food with
out leaving the Farm.
Polio's will be located behind The Pulse and ASSU
Lecture Notes on the first floor of Tresidder. Its front
door will open to the courtyard.
Still undergoing finishing touches before its open
ing, Polio's will seat about 100 people. The restau
rant also boasts a "community room" in the rear of
the building which will offer students a place to relax
and watch television.
Walking in, one is greeted by bright-colored pat
terned walls, tables and chairs. Hardwood floors and
cushioned booths give the restaurant a homey at
mosphere.
Not only is Polio's hoping to provide the Stanford
community with quality food service, it is also trying

to work closely with students in
various activities and sporting
events, Dean of Students Marc
Wais said yesterday.
Currently Polio's is looking
into providing food for students on
some 20 buses heading for Big
Game. The restaurant has also
helped sponsor several Stanford
athletic teams.
Wais said Polio's cooperation
will make the restaurant "a very
good member of the Stanford com
munity.
"Polio's will be very responsive
to student needs," he said.
Polio's, which will offer a re
duced menu to accommodate stu
dents' budgets and extended
hours to appeal to varied sched
ules, is a perfect example of what
Wais said is "the kind of vendor
Tresidder wants to have.
"We're bringing in vendors
who will meet the needs of stu
dents, faculty and staff," Wais
said. "We are looking for vendors
who have a willingness to be flexi
ble in their menus, work collabo
ratively with students on activi
ties (and) programs and simply be
good members of the Stanford
community and culture. This isn't
strictly a business deal."
According to Wais, the opening
of Polio's is one of many steps in a
large project of revamping the

first floor of Tresidder.
With the recent expansion of
Bon Appetit's Asian cuisine offer
ings, Tresidder will have an exten
sive array of international foods
from which to choose. Also, Bon
Appetit has improved its lighting
in an effort to encourage more
students to study there, Wais
said.
"We are clearly making Tresid
der a campus hub for student ac
tivity," Wais said.
The current barber, Stanford
Hairstyling, which is located on
the first floor of Tresidder adja
cent to the Coffee House, will be
moving next to Polio's by Dec. 1.
Owner Newell Whitford said the
shop will be extending its hours to
be open on Sundays and will
change its name to Stanford Hair.
Although Stanford Hairstyling
will have a smaller operating space
after the move, Wais said the tran
sition will enhance the atmos
phere of Tresidder.
"I am delighted that we're able
to continue the tradition of having
a barber shop on campus — that
it's moving in sync with students'
needs and budgets," Wais said.
Additionally, a juice bar expect
ed to open by spring quarter will
make Tresidder a place toward
which "students will gravitate,"
Wais said.
Wais said he is hoping to an
nounce the choice of a vendor be
fore Thanksgiving. Odwalla, Juice
It and Jamba Juice have been
named as finalists.
