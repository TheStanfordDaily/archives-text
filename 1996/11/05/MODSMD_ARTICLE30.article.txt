# A 						DAY AT THE RACES
## 
### 
WHEN VOTERS HEAD to the polls today, they
will find themselves confronted with a bevy of
choices, not only between people running for
offices from president of the United States to Santa
Clara County supervisor, but also on issues from lim
ited legalization of marijuana to the future of state
sponsored affirmative action in California.
Sure, everyone knows that Bill Clinton and Bob
Dole are running for president, but how many know
the names of the candidates vying to represent Stan
ford's district in the U.S. House of Representatives?
Most everyone knows that Proposition 209 will affect

affirmative action programs governing state jobs and
admittance to state schools, but how many have infor
mation on the other 14 ballot propositions facing Cal
ifornia voters this Election Day?
In its never-ceasing effort to help its readers un
derstand the world around them, The Daily is at
tempting to ameliorate the above-mentioned situa
tion by printing the following guide to candidates and
issues on Stanford ballots. (We also encourage you to
visit the California Secretary of State's Vote '96 Web
site at http://vote96. ss.ca.gov/ for some really com
prehensive information.)
