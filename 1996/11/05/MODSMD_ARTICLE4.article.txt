## Vigil, day of activities organized to fight CCRI

Many students only attended the first half
of their 11 a.m. classes yesterday before walk
ing out in protest of Proposition 209.
The walk-out, to encourage people to vote
no on the California ballot initiative that
would end state-sponsored affirmative action
programs, was followed by a rally in White
Plaza.
Sophomore Natasha Dwamena walked
out of her Spanish class at 11:30 a.m. About
15 students attended the class, she said, and
they all walked out.
"One of the students mentioned the walk
out and what it was about. The professor
didn't seem to mind," Dwamena said.
Freshman Jacquie Pratt, who walked out
of her Chemistry3l lecture, said she had not
been involved in any anti-209 efforts before
yesterday.
"Today there's an organized rally when
everyone's doing it, and it can make more of
an impact," Pratt said.
Although Pratt said she was the only one

to walk out of chemistry, many students
walked out of other large lectures.
"Apparently, a lot of people walked out of
Econ 1," said senior Marianna Aue, a rally or
ganizer.
Students were not the only ones partici
pating in the walk-out. Stewart Hyland, an
employee in the Registrar's Office, also left
his work.
"I tried to get some other people to come
with me," Hyland said, "but they were like,
'Nah, I'm breaking early for lunch.' "
"I agree with this (rally) totally. It's really
good to see students active and taking a
voice," he said.
Latecomers to the rally were welcomed
with chants of "Discrimination is a crime.
Vote no on 209" and "Hey, hey, vote no! 209
has got to go!"
About 200 people attended the beginning
of the rally, with others coming and going
throughout the hour-long event. Students,
faculty and community volunteers then
spoke against Prop. 209, sometimes called

the California Civil Rights Initia
tive.
Linguistics Prof. John Rickford,
speaking at his first political rally
in 25 years, noted that the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to a
predominantly white male audi
ence when he rallied here in the
19605. Diversity at Stanford may
have changed, he said, but people

still hold racist views.
"People feel that as long as they
don't see someone with a hood over
their head, racism no longer ex
ists," he said.
Rickford said racism and sexism
are still rampant in the workplace.
He added that not one of 150
prominent Silicon Valley compa
nies is run by a woman.
Rally organizers also recruited
volunteers in a last-minute at
tempt to canvass East Palo Alto.
Those attending the rally were
also invited to place their painted

Hand on a cloth mural.
In between the rally and a 7 p.m.
candlelight vigil, volunteers passed
time by decorating White Plaza
with sidewalk chalk slogans oppos
ing the proposition. Other volun
teers took scraps and began creat
ing "a structure of resistance."
"We basically wanted to build
something to have a physical sym
bol of protest," Aue said. "Another
thing was to have it be something
that connects Prop. 209 with other
issues."
Amid an ice cube tray, a grill and

miscellaneous wood and metal
scraps symbolizing resistance
hung fliers and newspaper articles
against Prop. 209, affirmative ac
tion pamphlets and the Disorienta
tion Guide, a guide for campus ac
tivism produced by Resistance Ac
tion Grassroots Organizing Educa
tion.
Throughout the afternoon, stu
dent groups including Sanskriti,
the Filipino American Student
Union and Everyday People per
formed and spoke against Prop.
209.
