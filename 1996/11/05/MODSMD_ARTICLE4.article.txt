Many students only attended the first half
of their 11 a.m. classes yesterday before walk
ing out in protest of Proposition 209.
The walk-out, to encourage people to vote
no on the California ballot initiative that
would end state-sponsored affirmative action
programs, was followed by a rally in White
Plaza.
Sophomore Natasha Dwamena walked
out of her Spanish class at 11:30 a.m. About
15 students attended the class, she said, and
they all walked out.
"One of the students mentioned the walk
out and what it was about. The professor
didn't seem to mind," Dwamena said.
Freshman Jacquie Pratt, who walked out
of her Chemistry3l lecture, said she had not
been involved in any anti-209 efforts before
yesterday.
"Today there's an organized rally when
everyone's doing it, and it can make more of
an impact," Pratt said.
Although Pratt said she was the only one

to walk out of chemistry, many students
walked out of other large lectures.
"Apparently, a lot of people walked out of
Econ 1," said senior Marianna Aue, a rally or
ganizer.
Students were not the only ones partici
pating in the walk-out. Stewart Hyland, an
employee in the Registrar's Office, also left
his work.
"I tried to get some other people to come
with me," Hyland said, "but they were like,
'Nah, I'm breaking early for lunch.' "
"I agree with this (rally) totally. It's really
good to see students active and taking a
voice," he said.
Latecomers to the rally were welcomed
with chants of "Discrimination is a crime.
Vote no on 209" and "Hey, hey, vote no! 209
has got to go!"
About 200 people attended the beginning
of the rally, with others coming and going
throughout the hour-long event. Students,
faculty and community volunteers then
spoke against Prop. 209, sometimes called
