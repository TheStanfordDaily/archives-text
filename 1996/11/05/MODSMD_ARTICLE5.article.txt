# Environmentalism drives Knight fellow
## 
### Jen Graves Staff writer 
People in Kaduna, Nigeria, do
not know why their soil is infertile
and many of their fish are dying.
They do not yet understand that
corporate dumping causes their
water to be soapy and oily.
A journalist who has taken it
upon himself to expose these and
other environmental problems in
Nigeria is studying at Stanford
this year as a Knight fellow.
As an environmental journal
ist in Nigeria, the most populous
country in Africa with about 100
million people, Ephraims Sheyin
writes for one of the most undere
ducated cultures in the world in
terms of environmental concerns.
While at Stanford, Sheyin
said he wants to use an Ameri
can perspective in studying the
environmental problems his
country shares with many Third

World nations.
This year's trip to Stanford is
only Sheyin's second out of Africa,
but he said he feels comfortable
here despite the culture shock.
"The thing I find part icularly
fascinating about this area is the
general friendliness," said
Sheyin. "In people seem so
busy. Here, people will even take
time from what they're doing to
help you."
In Nigeria, Sheyin works for
the News Agency of Nigeria, a
wire service similar to the Associ
ated Press in the United States.
The 29-year-old calls the environ
ment "the most underreported
problem in Nigeria."

ronmental and human rights ac
tivists.
Sheyin is reluctant to speak di
rectly about the political side of
environmental issues in Nigeria.
According to Sheyin, industrial
pollution from multinational
companies like Shell is the mtyor
threat to the Nigerian environ
ment. Shell and other companies
harvest oil-rich Nigeria and leave
their waste carelessly in the rivers
and soil, he said.
Since the government of Nige
ria profits from taxes paid by
these companies, environmental
safety measures have not been
implemented at all.
"A lot of companies like Shell
leave our communities disadvan
taged," said Sheyin. "It's a symbi
otic relationship. The federal gov
ernment gets from Shell; Shell
gets from the federal government.
Together, they make it very diffi
cult for the people. If you must
benefit from our community, com
pensate us for our literal losses."
In December of this year, Shell
signed a major new contract with
Nigeria for a $3.8 billion natural
gas project.
Despite Nigeria's vast array of
environmental problems, such as
overpopulation, deforestation
and automobile pollution, Sheyin
has a positive attitude about the
level of environmental education
in Nigeria.
"I think the ideas are starting
to make sense to people," he said.
His optimism extends to his
government as well. Although
Nigeria is now run by military dic
tator Abacha, Sheyin maintains
hope for a democracy.
"There's a process toward de
mocratic governance," he said.
"They are talking about conduct
ing elections next year. If that
happens, it will be a civilian gov
ernment. But we are used to being
disappointed by the military gov
ernment. We're just adopting a

wait-and-see attitude."
Of Abacha, Sheyin said, "He
has shown some commitment so
Nigerians are confident that this
one is actually going to be useful
to all of us."
Not everyone is as optimistic.
Ijeoma Ikoku, a senior from Nigeria
said she does not plan on returning
to Nigeria in the near future.
"I think all the elections are
rigged in Nigeria," Ikoku said.
"They've gone to civilian govern
ments before, but the military
just picks who they want to win."
Like many .Third World na
tions under military rule, the gov
ernment controls almost all areas
of life. There is no freedom of the
press, and many journalists find it
a challenge to keep both their in
tegrity and their safety.
"Africa is an area where jour
nalism can use some help,"
Knight Fellow Program Director
James Risser said.
Sheyin addressed his own ex
perience with regard to free
speech and free press.
"I've had one or two brushes
with authority but no major
clashes," he said. "I think if I was
reporting politically, it would be
different. I just stick to my envi
ronmental beat."
When pressed on the issue of
politics and the environment,
Sheyin denied that the two were
closely connected.
Sheyin's ability to avoid con
flict is likely due to his easygoing
manner and flexibility, which
Risser said are helping him adjust
to life in the United States.
"He has a wonderful sense of
curiosity and wanting to learn,"
Risser said, "and that is key for
any journalist."
Although Sheyin has not had
time yet to make many close
friends, he is held in high esteem
by many of his American col
leagues at Stanford.
"I have special respect," said
Andrew Zajac, also a Knight fel
low, "for a journalist in any part of
the world where speaking the
truth as you know it can get you in
trouble with the government."

reporting politically, it would be
different. I just stick to my envi
ronmental beat."
When pressed on the issue of
politics and the environment,
Sheyin denied that the two were
closely connected.
Sheyin's ability to avoid con
flict is likely due to his easygoing
manner and flexibility, which
Risser said are helping him adjust
to life in the United States.
"He has a wonderful sense of
curiosity and wanting to learn,"
Risser said, "and that is key for
any journalist."
Although Sheyin has not had
time yet to make many close
friends, he is held in high esteem
by many of his American col
leagues at Stanford.
"I have special respect," said
Andrew Zajac, also a Knight fel
low, "for a journalist in any part of
the world where speaking the
truth as you know it can get you in
trouble with the government."
