People in Kaduna, Nigeria, do
not know why their soil is infertile
and many of their fish are dying.
They do not yet understand that
corporate dumping causes their
water to be soapy and oily.
A journalist who has taken it
upon himself to expose these and
other environmental problems in
Nigeria is studying at Stanford
this year as a Knight fellow.
As an environmental journal
ist in Nigeria, the most populous
country in Africa with about 100
million people, Ephraims Sheyin
writes for one of the most undere
ducated cultures in the world in
terms of environmental concerns.
While at Stanford, Sheyin
said he wants to use an Ameri
can perspective in studying the
environmental problems his
country shares with many Third

World nations.
This year's trip to Stanford is
only Sheyin's second out of Africa,
but he said he feels comfortable
here despite the culture shock.
"The thing I find part icularly
fascinating about this area is the
general friendliness," said
Sheyin. "In people seem so
busy. Here, people will even take
time from what they're doing to
help you."
In Nigeria, Sheyin works for
the News Agency of Nigeria, a
wire service similar to the Associ
ated Press in the United States.
The 29-year-old calls the environ
ment "the most underreported
problem in Nigeria."
