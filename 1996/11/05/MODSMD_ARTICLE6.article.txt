# SHS-UCSF merger deemed a good move
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
In a major step toward complet
ing the merger between the Stan
ford and UC-San Francisco med
ical centers, a third-party review
team has concluded that the union
is a "sound business decision."
The merger has been called a
response to the economic pres
sures of the competitive Northern
California health care market and
the pressure to consolidate. The
review team's report supports the
theory that the medical centers
stand to benefit from the alliance.
The review team's conclusion
removes one of the last major ob
stacles to the merger and positive
action from the UC Regents is ex
pected in the next few weeks. The
proposed combined entity is provi
sionally named NEWCO.
The Regents commissioned the
report in August and will discuss it
at a meeting on Friday. Both Stan
ford and UC officials declined to
comment until the meeting.
Chaired by investment expert
Warren Hellman, the review team
included former Harvard Busi

ness School Dean John McArthur
and Harvard Medical School Prof.
Samuel Thier. Bain & Co., a man
agement consulting firm, provided
analytic support for the report.
While calling the performance
of the UCSF Medical Center suc
cessful so far, the report concluded
that funding other than what the
hospital earns in the course of its
regular operations ls "expected to
decline in the future."
The report forecasted signifi
cant reliance on such non-operat
ing funding as investment income,
gifts and clinical teaching support
if the merger does not take place.
The review team suggested that
UC "may not have the option to
negotiate as favorable a position in
this merger in the future as the
UCSF Medical Center's financial
position continues to decline."
According to the report, the al
liance offers the potential benefits
of revenue enhancement and cost
reduction. Even if the actual bene
fits of are only half of those pre
dicted, the merger will leave the
UCSF Medical Center financially
stronger, the report predicted.
Highlighting the connection be
tween the UCSF Medical Center's
clinical services and the UCSF
School of Medicine's academic
role, the review team also stressed
the importance of financial health
to the teaching mission.
In response to anxiety over the
merger's impact on low-income pa
tients, the report said, "NEWCO
formation should not significantly
impact the current levels of indi
gent care."
The report also found that the
merger will improve UCSF's com
petitive advantage by coordinating
programs with Stanford Health Ser
vices, the body that oversees the clin
ical operations of the Stanford Hos
pital and the School of Medicine.

It cited "coordinating depart
ments and faculty chair recruit
ment packages, sharing program
investments and coordinating
teaching programs" as possible av
enues of cooperation.
Expecting NEWCO to become
"the market leader in 20 out of 26
medical diagnostic categories," the
review team forecasted improve
ments in both the merged entity's
cost position and its customer ser
vice.
The review team conducted
analysis of the merger in order to
evaluate its soundness as a busi
ness decision. According to the re
port, no additional analysis of
NEWCO is required to assess its fi
nancial viability at this point.
Citing the adequacy of available
information and the costs of delay
ing the decision process, the report
urged the UC Regents to act on the
merger. "The time to decide has ar
rived," it said.
