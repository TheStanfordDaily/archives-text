## Alumnus Robert Hass discusses influences with Kresge audience 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
U.S. Poet Laureate and Stan
ford alumnus Robert Hass shared
original and translated works
with a packed house at Kresge Au
ditorium last night.
Introduced as "a man who has
read, remembered and formed an
opinion about eventhing," Hass,
who received his doctorate from
Stanford in 1976, has authored
several collections of poems es
says. Along the way, he has gar
nered numerous awards including
a Guggenheim Fellowship and a

Mac Arthur Fellowship. His an
thology, "Field Guide," was
awarded the Yale University
Younger Poets First Book Award
Influenced by Buddhist
philosophies — enough, he said, to
have gone through a "vegetarian
stage" in life — Haas' poetry dis
cusses everything from love and
children to despondency, failure
and loss, in a style that ranges
from political to erotic.
Hass also spoke of his interest
in the ancient Japanese poetic
form of haiku. Because he is not
fluent in Japanese, Hass said he
used several dictionaries in his at
tempt to translate works by such
notables as Bashu, Buson and Issa.
What resulted is "The Essential
Haiku," which he called "a book of
versions," rather than transla
tions.
At his public reading, Hass
drew most of his material from his
recently published collection,
"Sun Under Wood."
Hass told the story of his inspi
ration for one of the poems, "Hap

piness." He said it came from his
view from a cafe in Northern Cali
fornia. And because, he said, "Mj'
wife whispered in my ear that
morning: 'Write me a poem with
three kinds of animals in it.' "
Other poems in "Sun Under
Wood" discuss experiences with an
alcoholic mother, the struggles of
the Californian Native Americans
and political strife in Poland.
In the collection, Hass also
challenges the threat of the beliefs
that science is an objective truth
and that every species lives in its
own sensory world. In response to
scientific egotism, a line in the
poem "Notes on lowa City" reads,
"I do not know. I cannot know."
