# Clinton re-elected; GOP holds Congress
## Few students follow results of election 
### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
As the clock ticked past 8 o'clock last
night, polls were closing across California.
Tired from 96 hours of non-stop cam
paigning and battered in the electoral
count, Bob Dole prepared to give his con
cession speech. Reports from local
precincts began to trickle in, showing the
majority of the state's ballot measures
hanging in the balance.
The moment was tense and filled with
emotion.
Stanford students, true to form, gave
an apathetic shrug and went back to
their studies.
As Dole made his way to the podium
in Washington, D.C., he was greeted by a
cheering crowd. In the Roble Hall
lounge, two students stretched out on
couches and watched the speech on tele
vision. Just up Mayfield Avenue, several
dorm televisions in the Florence Moore
cluster sat turned off.
Even campus political groups felt the
wave of indifference. Around 8 p.m.,
only three College Republicans had
shown up for the group's election-night
party. More campus Democrats gath
ered to attend a San Jose party but that
group too noted a low level of enthusi
asm.
"I sense that there was a lot of apa
thy," said freshman Democrat Tom
Soule. "But I harken back to the 209
rally, and there were a lot of people who
gave a damn about politics."
In fact, it was difficult to find a siz
able group of students watching mid
evening election results in all but a few
Stanford residences. One explanation
for that could be seen in the somewhat
predictable presidential race. Television
networks declared Bill Clinton the win

ner just after 6 p.m., and student inter
est trailed off soon after.
Antoine Picard, a senior who
watched the returns in Roble, saw a
packed lounge quickly vacate as Clinton
was named the victor. A crowd of "near
ly 40" had been reduced to only Picard
and junior Alan Taber. For their part,
those two were watching with keen in
terest.
Picard, who hails from France,
watched with an outsider's perspective.

The results, he said, were more or less
what he had expected. He said he
planned to continue watching as the Cal
ifornia propositions began to show re
sults.
Taber, a Dole supporter, was "sad to
say" that the election had turned out as he
expected it would. Although he was en
couraged by the Republican Party's ap
parent ability to keep control of both hous-

es of Congress, Taber said he was
upset that Clinton had won.
Taber did express optimism that
a Democratic president coupled
with a GOP Congress would create
enough gridlock to keep the govern
ment from doing "unimportant"
things, however.
Another Republican, junior
Timmy Lee, a Lagunita resident,
said although he expected a Dole
loss, he was encouraged by the GOP
candidate's seemingly strong show
ing in the popular vote. He said he
was also surprised by the weak De
mocratic showing in congressional
races.
More liberal sentiments could be
found in Paloma. A vocal group of
about 10 students camped out in
front of the television in the Paloma
lounge, catching returns while
reading.
One possible reason for the high

interest in that dorm is that several
residents are students in Political
Science 1 and recently completed an
in-depth look at the election.
"It's interesting to look at just
because we studied it so much in
Poli Sci 1," said freshman Erin
Bouchler.

'I think it's a victory
for the status quo.
No one who ran on
positions of great
change won.'

Regardless of their motivation
for watching the election, most
Paloma residents found it easy to
speculate on the evening's impact
Freshman Sarah McMullen, for ex
ample, theorized that President

Clinton will be more active in his
second term.
"I think he wants to get some
thing done now," she said. "Four
more years of stalwart opposition
isn't going to do anything for any
body."
Democrats on campus had simi
lar reactions but focused more on
the role of Congress. "If the House is
Republican, I think you're going to
see fairly moderate legislation be
cause I think the Republicans have
learned that the extremist agenda
they sought to implement after 1994
really was not representative of
common sense and what the voters
wanted," said junior Dave Thomas,
chair of the Stanford Democrats.
Some Stanford Republicans
seemed disappointed with the elec
tion results. "I think it's a victory for
the status quo," said graduate stu
dent Gregory Besharov. "No one who
ran on positions of great change
won."
