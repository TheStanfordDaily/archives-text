# Clinton re-elected; GOP holds Congress
## Few students follow results of election

As the clock ticked past 8 o'clock last
night, polls were closing across California.
Tired from 96 hours of non-stop cam
paigning and battered in the electoral
count, Bob Dole prepared to give his con
cession speech. Reports from local
precincts began to trickle in, showing the
majority of the state's ballot measures
hanging in the balance.
The moment was tense and filled with
emotion.
Stanford students, true to form, gave
an apathetic shrug and went back to
their studies.
As Dole made his way to the podium
in Washington, D.C., he was greeted by a
cheering crowd. In the Roble Hall
lounge, two students stretched out on
couches and watched the speech on tele
vision. Just up Mayfield Avenue, several
dorm televisions in the Florence Moore
cluster sat turned off.
Even campus political groups felt the
wave of indifference. Around 8 p.m.,
only three College Republicans had
shown up for the group's election-night
party. More campus Democrats gath
ered to attend a San Jose party but that
group too noted a low level of enthusi
asm.
"I sense that there was a lot of apa
thy," said freshman Democrat Tom
Soule. "But I harken back to the 209
rally, and there were a lot of people who
gave a damn about politics."
In fact, it was difficult to find a siz
able group of students watching mid
evening election results in all but a few
Stanford residences. One explanation
for that could be seen in the somewhat
predictable presidential race. Television
networks declared Bill Clinton the win

ner just after 6 p.m., and student inter
est trailed off soon after.
Antoine Picard, a senior who
watched the returns in Roble, saw a
packed lounge quickly vacate as Clinton
was named the victor. A crowd of "near
ly 40" had been reduced to only Picard
and junior Alan Taber. For their part,
those two were watching with keen in
terest.
Picard, who hails from France,
watched with an outsider's perspective.

The results, he said, were more or less
what he had expected. He said he
planned to continue watching as the Cal
ifornia propositions began to show re
sults.
Taber, a Dole supporter, was "sad to
say" that the election had turned out as he
expected it would. Although he was en
couraged by the Republican Party's ap
parent ability to keep control of both hous-
