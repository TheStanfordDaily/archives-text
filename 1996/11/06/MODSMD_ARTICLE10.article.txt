ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) â€” Benazir
Bhutto was under virtual house arrest yester
day after being dismissed as prime minister by
the president, who said he was forced to act
because of accusations that she was corrupt
and undemocratic.
Soldiers with assault rifles guarded the
gates to Bhutto's home. Her husband, Invest
ment Minister Asif Ali Zardari, was arrested
earlier in the day along with 20 other members
of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party. Zardari
has been implicated in a number of scandals.
Bhutto "wants to meet with her party people,
her central committee, the press, but she can't,"
said Aftab Sherpao, a People's Party member.
President Farooq Leghari named retired
politician Miraj Khalid as interim prime minis
ter and set new elections for Feb. 3, nearly two
years before Bhutto's term was to have ended.
The National Assembly was dismissed Mon
day along with Bhutto. Khalid, a former Peo
ple's Party stalwart, had stepped down as
speaker of the National Assembly after clash
ing with Bhutto.
Sherpao said Bhutto hasn't decided whether
to challenge her dismissal in the Supreme
Court. She fought off a similar dismissal in
1990, eventually regaining power in 1993.
As Sherpao drove from the president's resi
dence to Bhutto's official home just 100 yards
away, the sound of the national anthem could
be heard as Leghari prepared to swear in
Khalid.
