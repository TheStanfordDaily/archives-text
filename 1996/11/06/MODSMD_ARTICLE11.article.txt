KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) — Thousands of stu

stolen vehicles yesterday, defying a government
ban on public demonstrations and demanding the
resignation of the prime minister.
Some students attacked foreign journalists cov
ering the unrest, accusing their governments of
supporting the Rwandan rebels who have taken
over parts of eastern Zaire.
The students gathered at the University of Kin
shasa in more than 25 buses and dozens of cars that
had been stolen the night before, just hours after
the government decreed a ban on public rallies.
More than 10,000 students took to the streets,
stealing cars and trucks and trashing homes and
businesses of ethnic Tutsis. They demanded the
resignation of Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo,
whose mother is a Rwandan Tutsi, angry that he
had not declared war against Rwanda and Burun
di.
Zaire accuses the two neighbors of aiding the
ethnic Tutsi rebels fighting government troops in
eastern Zaire.
Also yesterday, the Voice of Zaire radio accused
the American and South African governments of
supplying arms to the Rwandan army and rebels
in eastern Zaire and said Israel was helping to
train the Rwandan military.
