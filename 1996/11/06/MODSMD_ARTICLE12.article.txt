Are you decent?
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An appeals court ruled yesterday that
a 1990 law tying decency standards to federal arts funding was
unconstitutional.
The law was passed during a furor over the National Endowment
for the Arts' role in funding such works as the homoerotic images of
Robert Mapplethorpe. It required the NEA to consider "decency and
respect" for American values when granting money to artists.
In a 2-1 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the law
was overly vague and discriminated on the basis of an artist's view
point.
"Government funding of the arts, in the circumstances of this
case, must be viewpoint-neutral," said Judge James Browning.
Knight labeled a threat
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Marion "Suge" Knight, head of rap label
Death Row Records, should stay in jail without bail because he's a
threat to the community and may flee, a probation officer says.
Knight, who was grazed in the shooting in which rapper Tupac
Shakur was fatally wounded, was jailed last month for allegedly vio
lating probation.
In a report filed earlier this week, a probation officer said a secu
rity videotape from the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas appears to
show Knight and several others beating up a man on Sept. 7, hours
before Shakur was shot.
Knight's attorney, David Kenner, disputed the allegation.
