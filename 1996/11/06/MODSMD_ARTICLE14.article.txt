## Free market principle? 
### 
Economics Department's
planning does not meet
some students' needs

Remember that snap
py Stanford application
boasting about increasingly
attentive classes as students pro
gressed beyond introductory
courses in their major? Some
where along the line, the principle
got lost in the bureaucratic shuffle
that is the Economics Department.
Many large departments are
renown for being less than atten
tive to their undergraduate stu
dents, but economics has to rank
near, if not at, the top of the pool.
In what has to be the mother of all
ironies, a department filled with
professors pushing for free market
principles and open competition is
mired in bureaucracy and has a
lackadaisical support staff reminis
cent of the communist govern
ments of some former Eastern Bloc
nations.
Indeed, while some professors
are off formulating economic
policies for developing nations or
sweeping tax-cut plans to get can
didates elected, students are sit
ting on the floor in Prof. Michael
Boskin's public finance class and
many seniors won't be able to
take a cornerstone economics
class — "Financial Economics"
— until spring, when most corpo
rate recruiters have come and
gone.
Those who are sitting on the
ifloor should consider themselves
lucky to have gotten into the class
at all. Flipping through the Stan
ford Bulletin, one finds that many
popular or required courses are not
being offered this year. Listings for
courses above the 100 level in the
department have dropped signifi
cantly overall, by as much as 20
percent in some estimates.
David Starrett, chair of the Eco
nomics Department, said the drop
in offerings this year was due to
several factors. First, the closure of

the Food Research Institute elimi
nated several cross-listed classes
which would count for credit in the
department. Secondly, there were
several sections of Economics 103
and 104 which had so few students
that the department decided to
scrap some of those extra sections.
And finally, the reorganization of
the department brought about by
the closure of the institute put
many positions in flux. Even so,
some popular classes, such as
Urban Economics, will not be given
because the department was
unable — either from poor plan
ning, shortage of funds or outright
lack of willpower— to find faculty
willing or able to teach them.
But while the Economics
Department can be cited for lack of
foresight, economics majors must
also partly share in the blame for
their fate of having to sit in crowd
ed classes. Economics students,
usually a politically passive group,
seem to have the attitude that
their department — perhaps
because of its size or fame — has
limitless resources and as a conse
quence they need never worry
about getting the classes needed to
graduate.
Economics students did not take
an interest in the events leading up
to the cutting of classes, such as
the closure of the institute; oppo
nents warned the closure would
affect course offerings in the
department overall.
Fortunately, some students
raised sufficient concern to prod
the department into offering
"Financial Economics" and
"Antitrust and Regulation" nggip t
albeit at a less than convenient or
apropos time.
Starrett says he does not antici
pate another scheduling problem
such as this to occur. Even so, he
and the department should take
the initiative and address some of
the other basic complaints stu
dents have with the department
and counter much of the apathy
many undergraduates feel toward
the department.
