U.S. News rankings broaden students' college choices

THE RECENT "RANKINGS cru
sade" seems a bit silly. Has Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
really received "phone calls from hordes
of angry alumni over Stanford's decline
from fourth to sixth place, as suggested
in Joe Freund's article on Friday? This is
ludicrous. Can you really be upset to see
Stanford ranked right up there with
MIT, Harvard, Princeton and Yale? Does
Stanford (or anyone for that matter)
really have a right to be called No. 1? I
don't think so.
So should the rankings be scrapped? I
don't think so because it is useful for stu
dents to see what the top schools are. For
one thing, rankings such as U.S. News &

World Report, as well as the Gourman
report, though a bit flawed, help students
to realize that you don't have to go to
Harvard (no offense to the Crimson) to
get a good education. The most impor
tant lesson I learned by perusing those
rankings is the strength of state schools
around the nation. Also, great colleges
such as Rice and Duke have strong show
ings. If you poll people around the coun
try as to what the top schools are, more
often than not I believe that Harvard will
appear rather than Duke or Rice. That
unfortunate predisposition occurs among
the brightest students, as well. When I
applied to college, I had only heard of
Stanford from a football game on ABC.

These rankings would have encouraged
me to put Stanford on top of my list,
along with MIT, Harvard and Dart
mouth.
Now if the top high school students
around the country are reading this like
the Bible, I am afraid for the future of
this nation. In my four years at MIT and
two-plus years at Stanford, I hadn't
heard of anyone who "carried around a
dog-eared copy" of the U.S. News rank
ings (paraphrased from a recent San Jose
Mercury News article) until recently. I
would really have appreciated a general
sketch of the top schools when I was
applying to college. I would hope that
high school students and their guidance

counselors would be able to realize the
inherent imperfections in any rankings
system and take it for what it is: a rough,
but useful sketch.
If the current brouhaha produces a
"better" rankings system (I guess that
will be determined by whomever comes in
first) then great. I think that the impor
tant message to get out to students is
that they have to find the right environ
ment for them, whether they go to U.S.
News' No. 1-ranked school or a great
state school. No matter what rankings
are settled on, the important issue is how
to get students to read them effectively.
