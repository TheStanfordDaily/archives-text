# Message to columnist: You can't always get what you want

In response to Javier Torres' column
in Tuesday's Daily, "Non-drinkers
ignored in dorm votes":
I don't like roast beef. I'll admit it. I
don't need it. I don't need it to make a
sandwich taste good, and I don't need it
for protein. For that, I eat peanut butter.
I think eating roast beef is about as cool as
... I don't know, eating a pig's kidneys.
I also don't like to see other Stanford
students eat roast beef. It gives them gas
and increases the risk of heart disease.
Gas smells bad, and heart disease makes
health insurance go up.
Seeing as how I clearly dislike roast
beef, it would seem obvious that I would
rather not purchase it. But the horrible

truth is that people like me are often
forced to purchase huge quantities of roast
beef AGAINST OUR WILL. The perpetra
tor of this injustice? None other than
Stanford University Dining Services.
I asked the people in charge of the din
ing services at Ricker, my dining hall,
why they purchase roast beef using my
meal plan dollars. They told me that it
seems many students like roast beef. I
replied that this was unfair â€” that if stu
dents want to consume food that makes
them fart, they have no right to purchase
it with my money.
I have no delusions of grandeur; all I
want is to be able to ensure that the Uni
versity doesn't spend money on anything
I don't like. Instead of just buying food
that SOME people like, why not have a
separate, voluntary roast beef fund? It
might sound like a little bit of hassle, but
it is the only way to respect the irrecon
cilable rights of roast beef eaters and

non-roast beef eaters. It is time to learn
to respect the wishes of all students and
put the concept of collective decision
making to rest forever.
