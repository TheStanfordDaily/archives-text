# Dean Montoya dispels myths concerning some early decision policies
## 
### 
I am concerned that Friday's story,
"Admission dilemmas," reinforced three
myths about the admission process:
Myth I: Early decision is not an option
for financial aid applicants. This is not
the case. Preliminary financial aid
awards are sent to admitted early deci
sion applicants approximately one week
after letters of admission are mailed.
Admitted early decision candidates apply

ing for aid are not required to withdraw
applications to other colleges and univer
sities until they receive preliminary
financial aid awards.
Myth II: The majority df the class is
filled through the early decision pro
gram. Last year 22 percent of the admit
ted class was early decision candidates.
The rate of admission for early decision
candidates was about 2 percent higher
than for regular review applicants.
Myth III: Stanford limits the number
of students from any one high school.
There are no quotas on the number of
applicants admitted from any one high
school. Last year we admitted as many as
21 students from each of two high
schools and at least 10 students from
each of 11 high schools.
Thankyou for your attention.

Dean of undergraduate admission and
financial aids
