## First election reflections 
### 
THERE, I FEEL better already. It
is the"Day After." It feels so
good to have finally voted, to
have gotten something off of my chest.
Yesterday was the first time that most
of us undergraduates have cast a ballot
in a presidential election. Whether my
man wins or loses seems almost sec
ondary.
This morning, as you read this col
umn, we are in a slightly different world
than we were in yesterday. As I write
this column, well before any ballots
have been counted, I am nonetheless
confident that several things have hap
pened:
I know that many of the candidates
and initiatives I voted for have passed
and that quite a few have failed, as well.
I know that few people afe completely
happy with the election results? yrat aa *
few are completely miserable. is*-
mixed bag of results for us all, but there
is clearly enough change for us all to
rejoice and to reconcile.
America is much larger than the
results of one election. I guarantee that
the world will not end because Proposi
tion 209 passed or failed, nor shall the
sky fall now that Bill Clinton has been
re-elected, nor will we enter a new era
of peace and harmony now that Newt
Gingrich or Dick Gephardt (or Bill
Thomas) will be our speaker. We have
all had the opportunity to get things off
our chest, and now it's time to heal the
wounds and congratulate the victors.

Perhaps the greatest thing about
American democracy is its consistency.
For me, George Bush's finest hour
came immediately following his defeat
four years ago. The president was gra
cious and honorably stepped off histo
ry's podium, understanding all too well
that no single person can contribute
more to democracy than the will of the
collective. Richard Nixon showed more
class the day he resigned office and left
Washington than he did at any other
point of his presidency.
Those of you who doubt the singular
importance of transitions, consider
Burma, where 80 percent of the public
can be denied their choice by a small
group of militaristic thugs who can be
described as nothing short of evil. For
those who suggest is dif
"iferent or aomehow superior to develop
ing democracies, I'd suggest you study
the election of 1860. Lincoln's victory
was overshadowed by the subsequent
secession of several states, the precipi
tating event to the American Civil War.
Sore losers generally do not make good
policy.
When we disagree with the majori
ty's verdict, we must work hard within
the system to change that majority,
rather than reject its decision. While it
is true that there are historical excep
tions (for instance, Hitler became chan
cellor of Germany through a fair elec
tion), we see that most of the time, the
public chooses wisely. When we lose, we

must continue the struggle from within
the system, rather than from the out
side.
As I write this, I can not predict all
outcomes, but there are several con
stants that reassure me tremendously. I
know that tomorrow I will awake and
the sun will still rise, it will probably be
warmer here than in Cambridge and
that Cal will still suck.
I know that I will be disappointed by
some results today as will just about
everyone else in this country. I also
know that in those races which I find
myself to be among the minority, I will
.working tomorrow to ensure that
I'll be in the majority the next time
around.
In this wonderful marketplace of
ideas, when we lose, we must either
accept that our ideas are flawed or our
presentation is ineffective. We must
consider BOTH possibilities — we must
all reconcile ourselves with today's real
ity, we must re-evaluate our own deci
sions, and finally, we must prepare for
the next time. The year 2000 begins 38
months from now . . .

Jim Finsten observes that only in Cali
fornia would voters eliminate affirma
tive action and legalize pot on the same
day.
