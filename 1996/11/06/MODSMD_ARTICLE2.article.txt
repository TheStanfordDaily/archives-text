# Economy major issue in president's success
## 
### 
(AP) — Voters tend to disapprove of the Republi
can Congress but still say in exit polls they're more
concerned about Democrats being too liberal than
they are about Republicans being too conservative.
The economy drove President Clinton's re-elec
tion, and yet congressional Democrats were not
swept far by the president's electoral landslide.
Every race in the Stanford district, however, was
won by a Democrat.
Republicans expanded their majority in the Sen
ate and were re-elected to control of the House for
the first time in more than six decades.
"The challenges we face, they're not Democratic
or Republican challenges," Clinton said in his ac
ceptance speech in Little Rock, Ark. "They're Amer
ican challenges."
Clinton's victory speech reflected the mixed Elec
tion Day results. While he was the first Democratic
president re-elected since Franklin Roosevelt, vot
ers returned Republicans to control of the House for
the first time in 66 years.
The GOP also will continue to control the Senate,
thereby keeping a rein on Clinton appointments —
to the Supreme Court, as well as to his own Cabinet.
"They are sending us a message: Work together,
meet our challenges, put aside the politics of divi
sion and build America's community together,"
Clinton said.
Those who voted Republican in House races
rated taxes, the deficit and the economy together as
the most important issues. Those who went for De
mocrats put the economy at the top, followed bj
Medicare, Social Security and education.
Clinton's policies were "verv important" ir
choosing congressional candi
dates for 47 percent of voters, and
that group mostly voted for Democ
rats for Congress. Just 28 percent
said House Speaker Newt Gin
grich's policies were critical to their
votes, and they tended to vote
against the Republicans in their dis
tricts.
By a slim margin, voters said a
Congress controlled by Democrats
would be too liberal. A solid majori
ty, 55 percent, said they weren't
worried that a GOP Congress
would be too conservative.
Nearly half of the voters sur
veyed wanted a Republican Con
gress to check Clinton, while 46 per
cent preferred that Democrats con
trol Capitol Hill. Most said govern
ment is doing "too many things bet
ter left to businesses and individu
als."
Despite the AFL-ClO's spending
$35 million in a political campaign
highly critical of incumbent Repub
licans, 34 percent of voters from
union households said they cast
their ballots for Republicans in
House races. That was down slight
ly from 1994, when about 39 per
cent voted Republican.
Clinton benefited from an even
larger gender gap than in 1992, ac

cording to exit poll results. Fifty
four percent of women voted for
Clinton, while men split their votes
about evenly between him and
Dole.
In House races, men favored Re
publicans, 51 percent to 47 percent,
while women voted for Democrats,

Nearly half of the voters surveyed wanted a Re
publican Congress to check Clinton, while 46 per
cent preferred that Democrats control Capitol Hill.
Most said government is doing too many things
better left to businesses and individuals.

55 percent to 43 percent.
Californians voted to stop the
clock on 30 years of race- and gen
der-based affirmative action yester
day, passing a measure that bans
such considerations in public hiring,
contracting and education.
With 20,420 of 25,348 precincts
reporting, or 81 percent, Proposi
tion 209 had 3,109,824 yes votes to
3,109,824 no votes, or 55 percent to
45 percent in unofficial returns.
Proponents claimed the measure
would usher in a new era of equal op
portunity by wiping out discrimina
tion and banning preferences they
claim only feed racial ill-will.
Opponents were reluctant to

concede defeat.
"We're determined to have the
last word on the issue," said Kathy
Spillar, Southern California cam
paign coordinator for Stop Prop.
209. "No matter what happens, this
is only the beginning of what we be
lieve will be a nationwide battle."

A legal challenge to the measure
was all but certain, perhaps as early
as today.
At a Democratic gathering in
downtown Los Angeles, Lorna
Wiley, who had worked against the
measure, struggled for composure
as she assessed the potential impact
of defeat.
"Once you lose something, it's
hard to get it back," she said.
Proposition 215, which legalizes
medical marijuana, passed 56 to 44
percent with 80 percent of precincts
reporting. Prop. 212, a campaign re
form initiative, was at 49 percent to
51 percent with the same number of
precinct returns.

Republican Bob Dole and his wife, Elizabeth, wave to supporters after Dole formally conceded defeat to
President Clinton yesterday. Dole told supporters to stay involved and keep fighting the good fight,
adding: "I'm still the most optimistic man in America."
