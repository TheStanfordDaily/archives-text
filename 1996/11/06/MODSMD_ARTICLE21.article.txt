# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## A 						political allegory: May the best caveman win 
### 
IN THE BEGINNING, there were
cavemen. They sat on rocks, ate
Mastodon and drew cave paintings.
One day, caveman Og grunted that if
everyone worked together they could sit
on more rocks, eat more Mastodon and
draw more cave paintings than they could
if they worked alone. Everyone thought
Og was nuts.
But they all went along with him. And
soon enough, their caveman town was
the most advanced of all. They had so
many rocks and Mastodons and cave
paintings that they found themselves
with leisure time left over.
So they invented politicians.
Politicians were just like every other
caveman, but it was their job to solve the
problems associated with having a whole
bunch of cavemen working together.
Problems such as which cavemen could
sit on which rocks, what types of paint
ings were inappropriate for baby cave
men and whether it was politically cor
rect to call everyone a caveman — since,
after all, caveman geneticists had discov

ered that not all cavemen were the same
beneath their loincloths.
One day, caveperson Og decided that
he wanted to be a politician because he
didn't like what he perceived to be the
current trends in cave painting. Og
enjoyed painting progressive things such
as sunsets and wildflowers, while his
archenemy Ugh enjoyed painting more
traditional pieces such as spears and
dinosaurs.
So, Og and Ugh decided to hold an
election. Everyone in town was to be
given two rocks, one rock for Og and one
rock for Ugh. They would then place
their rock of choice into a big pile and the
election commissioner would count the
rocks. Whoever had the most rocks wins.
Og thought he was clever when he told
people to "Rock the Vote." The people
laughed and Og went up 10 points in the
polls.
Ugh then countered by saying that Og
was a bleeding-heart liberal attempting
to undermine the integrity of cave society
with "gratuitous sunset and wildflower"

paintings. Ugh said all the "wildflowers
in the media" were a major cause of the
increase in opium use among cave chil
dren.
Og pointed out that the cave paintings
were merely a reflection of society. Then
he told everyone that he wore boxers and
played the saxophone on the Arsenio Hall
Show. Arsenio got canceled, but Og went
up another 10 points in the polls.
Ugh then pointed out that Og and his
slimy Southern accent, liberal bent and
effusive charm and wit were too slick for
voters and that they should vote for Ugh
instead because he grew up on a small
farm in Kansas. Ugh said Slick Oggie
"most likely has never even driven a trac
tor." Then Ugh fell off a stage and people
laughed about it for months.
When it came time for the debates,
most cave voters had already decided for
whom to cast their stone. The debates
came and went but not without Ugh try
ing to reel in the young cave voters by giv
ing out his URL address (http;//
www.ughvote.com).

There were other candidates, too. Lug
was libertarian and felt that government
intervention was unnecessary for suc
cessful cave allocation. Nug felt that the
continued concentration of power within
corporations was at fault for the shoddy
collection of cave paintings currently in
production. Smug was a Texan who
owned the free world and figured he
might as well run the military, too. He
was also very short and out of his mind.
Og and Ugh laughed at these lowly
candidates. Then they invented the word
"two-party system" and laughed some
more.
On Election Day, all the good cave cit
izens went to the voting pile and threw in
the rock which corresponded to the
monosyllabic candidate of their choice.
Ail throughout the day, broadcast jour
nalists stood near the voting pile and
polled cave voters as they exited. These
were called "leaving polls." By listening
to these exciting reports, cave voters
from everywhere could hear whether Og
or Ugh was projected to win in Oogalooga

County with "12 prcent of the precincts
reporting." Some places were judged "too
close to call."
Everyone waited nervously as the
rocks were counted. More than just cave
paintings were at stake here. This was
about making their voice heard among
the cacophony of conflicting grunts and
groans. This was about choosing or los
ing, plunging forward and shaping the
landscape of their cave walls or letting
the winds of change whip on unchal
lenged. This was about democracy and
freedom and "building a bridge to the
next century" even though cave people
hadn't invented bridges yet.
The results eventually came in, and
Og was declared the victor. Soon all of the
cave people were painting sunsets and
wildflowers, and poor Ugh's spear and
dinosaur paintings were relegated to
small caves in very out-of-the-way places.
