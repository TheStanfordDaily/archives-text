## Voters re-elect Eshoo Eshoo will lead 'the charge against that Gingrich' 
### Dana Hangai Staff writer 
Voters yesterday once again chose U.S.
Rep. Anna Eshoo, a Democrat, over Re
publican challenger Ben Brink to repre
sent Stanford's district in the House of
Representatives.
Running on a platform of deficit reduc
tion, environmental concern, abortion
rights and support of Silicon Valley busi
nesses, Eshoo easily defeated Brink, a Re
publican with moderate social views and a
fiscally conservative standpoint.
With 78 percent of the precincts report
ing at midnight, Eshoo had won 65.2 per
cent of the vote to Brink's 30.9 percent.
Facing a cheering throng of support
ers at the Los Altos Democratic head
quarters, Eshoo thanked them for their
time and effort, attributing both Presi
dent Clinton's and her victory to their
support.
"You have given your lifeblood," Eshoo
said. "By walking precincts and keeping
the faith, you've made history. You have
elected the first Democratic president to a
second term since Franklin D. Roosevelt."
Eshoo also discussed her plans for the
future, advocating a future Congress con
cerned with the environment, health care
for all and "an economy the Democrats
know how to produce, where everyone has
more and more share in it."
Concerning the passage of Proposition
209, Eshoo expressed her opposition to

the California Civil Rights Initiative, say
ing that at the national level, "We need to
demonstrate how well and effective affir
mative action is working for the country."
At 9:15 p.m., Brink conceded his de
feat. "We will do what the wise soldier
does: We shall fight again another day,"

you have given your life
blood. By walking precincts
and keeping the faith, you've
made history- You have elect
ed the first Democratic presi
dent to a second term since
Franklin D. Roosevelt'
— Anna Eshoo

Brink told an intimate gathering of about
20 supporters in Sunnyvale.
This race is the second time Brink has
run against Eshoo, who defeated him in
the 1994 elections.
"I've committed to run three times,"
Brink saidj "as long as my support builds
and it was reasonable to do it." He looked
toward 1998 as a more strategically ad
vantageous year, when he would have the

opportunity to rebuild local Republican
Party organization and not face presiden
tial coattails.
A member of Stanford's Class of '74
and a former president of the Stanford
Young Republicans, Brink turned to his
Stanford connections for support
throughout the race.
Eshoo also discussed the importance of
Stanford as a constituency and pledged
her assistance to both students and facul
ty.
"I've met many of the doctoral stu
dents at Stanford," Eshoo said. "The mys
teries of today will be unlocked by the re
search of those students. (Government
funding of research) is an absolute must."
Ron Sundergill, a coordinator of the
Santa Clara County Democrats, said the
14th District chose well at the polls.
"Anna Eshoo is clearly a leader in U.S.
Congress and this area is really lucky to
have someone of her caliber to represent
them in Washington," Sundergill said.
"She can go toe-to-toe with Newt Gin
grich."
Despite the Democrats' failure to re
take the House from the Republicans,
Eshoo expressed optimism in her party's
ability to fight the opposition.
"You know who's going to be leading
the charge against that Gingrich," Eshoo
told a cheering crowd.
