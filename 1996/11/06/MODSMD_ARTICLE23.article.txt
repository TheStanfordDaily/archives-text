# Lempert wins state Assembly position
## Laliotis says he was 'not suprised' or disappointed by the loss 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
The battle to represent Stanford's district
in the state Assembly turned into a one-sided
contest yesterday as Democrat Ted Lempert
beat Republican Ted Laliotis, earning nearly
two-thirds of the votes cast.
With 94 percent of the precincts reporting,
Laliotis had won only 33.8 percent of the vote.
Lempert, who served in the Assembly from
1988 to 1992, said he was "veiy excited" when
he arrived at the Democratic headquarters in
Los Altos around 10 p.m. At that time, returns
showed him to have 65 percent of the vote,
while Laliotis had only 31 percent.
Laliotis said he was "not surprised" he did
not win, nor was he disappointed with the loss.
"Whether I win or lose is not important,"
he said. "To have come here as a first-genera
tion, naturalized citizen ... to raise a family,
to succeed in business . . . the American
Dream is alive and well."
Lempert, whose campaign boasted the
backing of more than 75 percent of the dis
trict's Republican city council and school
board members, pushed education, environ
mental issues and ethics reform to the fore
front of the race.
Furthermore, his election "keeps the office
in the hands of a Stanford grad," Lempert said
with a smile.
Lempert, a 1986 Law School graduate, said
education has been one of his primary focuses
in this campaign, not just for Stanford but for
all California schools.
"Everyone has talked education, but un
fortunately, not everyone in California in the
legislature has been [active in fighting for it],"
he said.
Lempert has also made an effort to help
bring technology into classrooms.
"It's an embarrassment that California is
near the bottom of technology" in its school
systems, he said.
"We tend to focus on pilot projects," Lem
pert said. "We need to make a commitment
and work on all schools and make a true com

mitment in getting excellence back in educa
tion."
Laliotis made a distinction between him
self and Lempert by noting that very few Cal
ifornia legislators have an adequate knowl
edge of high technology.
"The big difference is that [Lempert] is a
career politician. It's about time we had some
one who understands anything about high
technology," Laliotis said of his of own busi

ness background at Hewlett-Packard Co.
Campaign finance reform will be Lem
pert's first project in office. "I would like to
have a constitutional amendment to limit
campaign spending" because spending has
gotten out of hand, he said.
This amendment, if passed, will reintro
duce the final point in his five-point ethics re
form package last put before the state legisla
ture in 1992.
