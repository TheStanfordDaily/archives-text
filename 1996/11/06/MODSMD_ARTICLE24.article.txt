## 
### Matt Spence Contributing writer 
In the bitterly fought race to rep
resent Stanford's district on the
Santa Clara County Board of Su
pervisors, Democrat Joe Simitian
claimed a narrow victory over Re
publican Barbara Koppel last night.
Although late returns showed
Simitian holding a 13-point lead
over Koppel, both candidates were
reluctant to declare an end to the
contest.
"It's going to be a long night,"
Koppel said, rallying her supporters
at 11 p.m. "You got your sleeping
bags?"
Simitian, who made a brief
showing at the Democratic Head
quarters in Los Altos early in the
evening before heading to a private
party, said he did not want to call
the race until after midnight.
"We expect it will be close one
way or the other," he said. "It's
going to be a long night though."
The outcome seemed clear by
midnight with about half of the
precincts reporting. Simitian boast
ed a 56.5 percent showing with
23,428 votes, while Koppel re
mained at 43.5 percent, totaling
18,036 votes.
Despite discouraging late re
turns, 40 upbeat supporters gath
ered at Koppel's campaign head
quarters in a cocktail party-like at
mosphere. Koppel pledged that she
would wait late into the night before
conceding the race.
Hours after polls closed, the in
tensely negative tenor of the cam
paign remained. The race drew
media attention in recent weeks as
Simitian and Koppel exchanged

personal attacks and charges of ille
gal fund raising.
"I think it shows if you run a
sleaze campaign, you can win,"
Koppel said with resignation. "I'm
very proud of the kind of campaign
we ran."
Koppel conceded that a lack of
money, publicity and poor response
to Simitian's attacks caused her
trouble late in the race.
In contrast, Simitian cited a
strong campaign organization as
key to his campaign's success.
Simitian had nothing but praise
for the Stanford Democrats' effort
to recruit voters by calling regis
tered voters and distributing 2,500
door hangers. The hangers, distrib
uted Monday night, highlighted en
dorsements of Simitian from The
Stanford Daily and ASSU Presi
dent Bill Shen, alongside the en
dorsements of Vice President A 1
Gore and the San Jose Mercury
News.
During the March primary — in
which he finished second to Koppel
— many students did not vote be
cause they were away for spring
break, Simitian said. He said he was
not let down this time.
"Win, lose or draw, Stanford
couldn't have done better," Simit
ian said.
Since there is strong Democratic
support in the area, Koppel conced
ed Palo Alto to Simitian, a Palo Alto
City Council member, early in the
evening. Koppel, who served two
terms as mayor of Cupertino, had
counted on support from Saratoga
and surrounding areas.
