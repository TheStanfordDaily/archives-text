# Sher triumphs over Shannon in race for state Senate
## Democrat and emeritus law professor, in rematch of March special election, says student vote helped his victory 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
For the second time this year, voters in
the 11th state Senate district had a choice be
tween Democrat Byron Sher and Republican
Patrick Shannon.
They once again chose Sher, whose mar
gin of victory last night was double that in
the March special election.
With 95 percent of precincts reporting,
Sher had received 147,755 votes, 58.3 per
cent of those cast, while Shannon had re
ceived 38 percent, or 96,517 votes.
Before the March election, Sher — an
emeritus Stanford law professor — had been
a member of the state Assembly since 1980.

He noted that his margin in March was wider
than he had expected and gave him an excel
lent base for this election.
"It was decided in March, 55 percent to 45
percent," Sher said. "I think it was impor
tant to have won the special election"
Shannon, who graduated from Stanford
in 1986, attributed the increase in Sher's
margin to two factors: voter apathy and
Sher's having outspent him heavily.
Shannon said voter turnout was at a his
toric low and noted that many of the people
who voted yesterday but did not vote in
March voted largely on the basis of Sher's
higher name recognition.
He also identified trial lawyers and labor
unions as major Sher backers. He said that,

as a strong supporter of Proposition 208,
which seeks to regulate campaign contribu
tions, he had voluntarily observed the pro
posed regulations, which Sher had not
agreed to do.
"I was outspent ... because I practiced
what I preached," he said. "People weren't
that aware of the difference" between the
two candidates, he added.
During the election, Sher repeatedly em
phasized educational policy. He called Stan
ford "a very important constituent" and said
during the campaign that since he had joined
it, the senate had passed budget legislation
that would help reduce class sizes in the pub
lic schools.
According to Shannon, the chief differ

, ences between him and Sher lay in their vi
sion for government's role and in their views
on how to deal with crime.
t Shannon called himself a "fiscal conserv
ative" and identified Sher with a bigger,
1 more intrusive philosophy of government,
t On crime, both candidates stressed preven
; tative measures, but unlike Sher, Shannon
supports the death penalty.
Looking at the results of other elections,
both candidates saw cause for optimism.
1 "In 1998, we're going to have a Democra
-1 tic government," Sher predicted.
i Shannon, on the other hand, was pleased
with Republican prospects for gaining con
trol of the state Senate in the next election.
"Control is not an issue in this race. Con

trol will be an issue for 1998," Shannon said,
noting that many more incumbents will find
themselves unable to run in 1998 because of
term limits.
"The status quo won tonight," Shannon
said, but he predicted that the passage of
Prop. 208 and the effects of term limitation
will give candidates better opportunities to
unseat incumbents.
Regarding his future plans. Shannon said
he would "definitely stay involved in the pub
lic debate," although he was not sure what
his role would be, suggesting further election
bids and community activism as possibilities.
