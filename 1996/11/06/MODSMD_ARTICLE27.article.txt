# 'It hurts to lose an election'

### 
(AP) — Bob Dole didn't beat around the bush. "It's
a lot more fun winning," he told his deflated support
ers, his voice tight as a clenched fist. "It hurts to lose an
election."
If they didn't already know it, half the candidates in
America had the opportunity to find that out last night.
The other half, the lucky half, got to bask in the spine
tingling glory that keeps politicians running, year after
year after speech-filled year.
And, as Dole quite correctly pointed out, it was gen
erally more fun to win.
Sen. Strom Thurmond fairly bounded up to the
podium at the South Carolina State Fairgrounds in Co
lumbia, rejuvenated once again by his personal Foun
tain of Youth — the voters of South Carolina, who had
just granted him his eighth term in the Senate and the
chance to become the oldest man ever to serve.
There were gracious winners, of course, and gra
cious losers. Sometimes, they could be found in the
same race.
In Boston, Massachusetts Gov. William Weld smiled
throughout a speech in which he conceded defeat in the
U.S. Senate race to Denwcratic incumbent John Kerry.
He praised Kerry for sticking to his principles, say
ing: "He has prevailed in a fair and equal fight if ever
there was one."
Two miles awav, at anot her balloon-filled hotel ball

room, Kerry claimed victory and thanked Weld for "an
extraordinarily gracious and I think courageous con
cession." He then promised to get together with him for
a couple of beers sometime soon.
Perhaps the biggest contrast could be seen in one of
the most emotional races in the country, between De
mocrat Carolyn McCarthy and Republican incumbent
Daniel Frisa for a congressional seat on New York's
Ixmg Island.
McCarthy entered the race as a gun-control advo
cate three years after her husband was shot to death in
a massacre aboard the Long Island Rail Road.
"All we wanted to do was make something good
come out of a horrible situation," the soft-spoken Mc-
Carthy announced in a victory speech at Adelphi Uni
versity.
Not far away, the scene at Fnsa's headquarters in an
American l>egion Hall was a still life There were signs,
balloons, a podium with radio and television micro
phones. four television cameras and a handful of re
porters — but no sign of the candidate or any support
ers.
Tracked down later outside a restaurant, Frisa was
terse, bordering on belligerent.
"We told the truth. Sometimes it gets through, and
sometimes it does not," he said
Bob Dole said it: It hurts to lose
