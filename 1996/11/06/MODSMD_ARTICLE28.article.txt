Guilty genes?
Private detectives may have their methods of finding criminals,
but Genetics Prof. Neil Risch has developed mathematical models to

| find culprit disease genes. He studied the effectiveness
of two different methods in identifying genes that pre
dispose certain people to disease. He compared the
I more commonly used technique of linkage analysis to
the relatively unused technique of association analy
sis.

Risch determined that association analysis can be especially use
ful in understanding the genetics of complex disorders which involve
multiple genetic factors. Its advantage over the traditional linkage
analysis is that far fewer people need to be sampled to obtain the
same results.
Although linkage analysis can identify genes strongly implicated
in a disease, Risch argued that "there are a lot more genes with small
effects on disease." Association analysis can detect genes which are
more subtly involved in disease manifestation.
Closed heart surgeiy: The wave of the future?
Open heart surgery may not be so open anymore. On Oct. 7,
the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of instru-

ments that can be used to perform less invasive
heart surgeries. Doctors can now be trained to learn
this new technique, which was developed by John
Stevens, an acting assistant professor of cardiotho
racic surgery.
The equipment needed to perform "closed-chest"

heart surgeries is slowly being introduced into the market. The FDA
has just approved Heartport's endovascular cardiopulmonary bypass
system.
The system employs a method of threading five catheters through
a groin artery to the heart, after which the patient is put on a heart
lung machine in preparation for the surgery. The actual operation is
conducted through small incisions.
Now that the equipment is available, the next goal is to train doc
tors in performing closed-heart surgeries.
Breast cancer and genetic testing
Advances in genetic testing for breast cancer are raising ethical,
legal and social issues regarding the implications of the tests. In an

effort to explore these issues, a Stanford working
group led by Law Prof. Henry Greely is preparing rec
ommendations to be discussed at a meeting in San
Francisco on Nov. 23.
The conference on "Genetic Testing for Breast
Cancer Susceptibility: The Science, the Ethics, the

Future" will be held in conjunction with the Third World Congress
of the International Association of Bioethics. Speakers will discuss
topics such as the genetics of breast cancer, the role of the biotech
nology industry and ethical dilemmas in genetic counseling.
More information on the conference is available at a World Wide
Web site (http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/bioethics/world
congress.html).
