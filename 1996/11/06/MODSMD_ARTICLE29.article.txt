# Stanford group improving testing
## Cellular phones, televisions and computers depend on defect-free chips

With the explosive growth of the
Internet and computer technolo
gies in the last few years, computer
chips are becoming faster and
more complicated.
Thus, it is becoming increasing
ly difficult for manufacturers to
locate defective chips in their prod
ucts.
That's why Stanford's Center
for Reliable Computing and LSI
Logic Corp. of Milpitas have joined
forces on a three-year effort to
design and build a chip with only
one purpose: to be tested in order
to improve methods of testing
chips.
Technology such as cellular
phones, televisions and personal
computers rely on semiconductors
to produce chips for power. Ten
years ago, chips relied on thou
sands of transistors, which operat
ed at a few million cycles per sec
ond.
Today's technology has given
rise to chips that contain tens of
millions of transistors and operate
at hundreds of millions of cycles
per second.
These numbers will undoubted
ly continue to climb in the future,
which poses a serious problem for
companies that want to weed out
defective chips. In the past, the
solution was to build bigger and
faster testing devices. However,
this has become extremely difficult
and expensive.
"When you manufacture chips
... a lot of them are not good, and
you have to identify the bad ones.
There are different ways to do that,
and they are all inadequate or too
expensive," said center director
and Electrical Engineering Prof.
Edward McCluskey.
McCluskey and electrical engi
neering doctoral students Tsung-
Yung Chang, Yi-Chin Chu and
Sanjay Wattal have designed a chip
whose sole purpose is to be tested
in many different ways.
The improved testing tech
niques that the study finds should
make it much easier for companies
to spot defective chips in their
products and reduce the strain on
companies to build bigger and
faster testers.

According to McCluskey, sever
al companies have already
embraced the technology that
resulted from a previous study of
the same nature. Researchers can
also use the center's experimental
data to validate theoretical data.
The circuits on the test chip are
representative of what one would
find on commercial circuits in
order to make the tests more real
istic and accurate. "We wanted to
make the chip real," explained
Chang. , „ - i »>
One of the newer methods that
computer chip manufacturers

have designed to make chips oper
ate faster is called deep submicron
technology. It has presented a chal
lenge for electronic testing tech
niques.
"People want to have faster
chips, and the way to have a faster
chip is to shrink the device," Chang
said. "The other advantage is that
there are more device [compo
nents] on the chip so it's faster and
denser."
Another unique aspect of this
research is the time response of
chips.
In the past, chips could contain

defects as long as they weren't
operated at very high speeds.
McCluskey and his colleagues are
incorporating time response as one
of their testing methods. Other
methods that they are examining
include logic, memory, other mixed
signal circuits and very low-voltage
testing.
The partnership between LSI
Logic and Stanford is a unique
relationship between industry
and academia. After Chang and
his team design the model, LSI
Logic will manufacture the actual
chip.
