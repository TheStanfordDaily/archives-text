# Controversial Prop. 209 passes
## 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
California voters chose to support
the end of nearly 30 years of affirmative
action yesterday, approving the contro
versial Proposition 209 by a margin of
10 percent.
If Prop. 209 withstands the judicial
scrutiny which legal experts say may
begin as early as today, it would elimi
nate preferential treatment in the
state's public sector. This includes pub
lic employment, public education and
public contracting.
Often compared to Proposition 187
— which denied public benefits to illegal
immigrants and passed two years ago by
a 59-41 margin — Prop. 209 has gained
nationwide attention. This is the first
time that such an initiative has passed.
In the past two years, similar proposi
tions to end affirmative action have
failed in 17 states and nine times before
Congress.
Sophomore Jonathan Russell, Stan
ford College Republicans president, said
"testing (affirmative action) on a small
scale basis" is a step forward. This will
offer people concrete evidence as to
whether such programs are necessary,

he said.
"Personally, I really hope this exper
iment works," Russell said. "If people
are allowed to test the other hypothesis
(a society without affirmative action),
then we don't have to focus on race to
solve our racial problems.
"If [the experiment] doesn't work,
then people hopefully will accept that
affirmative action is what is needed,"
Russell said.
"Just the fact that (it] passed says
something about California in particu
lar," said junior Julie Johnson, former
College Republicans president. "People
are willing to move beyond group rights
to solve the problems of disadvantaged
people in our society."
Worded much like the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, many opponents of the ini
tiative said that deception played a large
factor in its passage.
"I'm really disappointed that this ini
tiative was really deceptive in nature,"
said senior Felipe Barragan, a MEChA
officer."The actual ballot didn't men
tion anything on the elimination of af
firmative action."
Junior Migdalia Gamboa, MEChA
co-chair, agreed. "A lot of us put a lot of
effort into educating people" and mak

ing sure people knew what the passage
of the initiative would mean, she said.
The Asian / Pacific Islander commu
nity also suffers from misconceptions
stemming from lack of information,
said Asian American Students Associa
tion Issues Chair Bianca Ling, a sopho
more.
"There is no recognition of how un
derrepresented (Asian / Pacific Is
landers) are still in the workplace and in
terms of government contracting," she
said. "With the passage of 209, I don't
think the representation of Asians in
those areas will be improved. In fact it
will probably be worsened."
Ultimately, the success of the initia
tive at the polls came as no surprise to
people. Up until the last week, field polls
have indicated a wide lead for the propo
sition.
"My reaction is one of numbness,"
said junior Cindy Urquidez, an organiz
er of Monday's campus protest against
Prop. 209. "At the same time, I think I
anticipated that 209 was going to pass
because of the mentality permeating so
ciety at this moment."
Urquidez said she did not see the suc-
