# Gene therapy tested to treat cystic fibrosis
## 
### Laura Lane Editorial staff 
Stanford investigators have
announced results of a recent
clinical trial which offers
promise toward finding a future
cure for cystic fibrosis.
At a meeting of the Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation on Oct. 25,
researchers discussed their
findings in a study funded by
the National Institutes of
Health. Researchers treated 10
patients at Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital,
showing significant findings
from an experimental treat
ment for the fatal disease called
gene therapy.
Capitalizing on the problems
that surfaced from earlier stud
ies by other groups, the Stanford

researchers were able to obtain
results that stand out as a major
breakthrough.
In gene therapy, normal
genes are transferred into a
patient's cells to compensate for
disease-causing defective genes.
Because cystic fibrosis
patients lack the ability to
secrete chloride into the crucial
secretory lumenal pathways, or
"pipelines," of the body, they are
also unable to secrete water and
sodium that normally follow
chloride.
Without water in the lumenal
pathways, patients suffer from
mucus buildup and blockage in
the pancreas, gastrointestinal
tract, sweat glands, reproductive
tracts and, most importantly,
the lungs.
The major source of death

among cystic fibrosis sufferers is
infections that result from the
mucus buildup in the lungs. The
average age of survival is about
29 or 30.

'Gene therapy is a
completely new
approach in med
icine It could be a
dramatic shift in the
way we treat disease.'
- Phyllis Gardner

"Since it's a single gene defect
and because we know we can
complement the defect with

transfection of the normal gene
and since you can target the
major source of morbidity by
aerosolization to the lung, then
it's regarded as a good proof of
principle disease for gene thera
py," said Assoc. Molecular Phar
macology Prof. Phyllis Gardner,
director of the study.
The researchers used a modi
fied virus which carried func
tional copies of the gene as a
delivery vehicle, or vector.
Once in the body, by its own
natural mechanisms, the virus
shuttles these passenger genes
into diseased cells. The cell may
then begin to produce the pro
tein required for normal trans
port of chloride and water into
the many secretory pathways
the body requires to function
properly.
While researchers hope to
ultimately target the lungs, they
chose the sinuses as the site of
treatment for this study.
The sinuses retain "the char
acteristics of cystic fibrosis
affected tissue," Gardner
explained. "We like to use it
because it provides a localized,
easy-to-access and contained
area in which we can instill vec
tor and follow up various param
eters, including direct visualiza
tion by endoscopy to follow the
recurrence of infection."
While inefficient gene delivery
has traditionally been a great
obstacle in gene therapy, three
patients in this study who were
given the highest level of treat
ment were found to have cells
containing an average of one
copy of the virus-shuttled gene.
"This trial is notable for its
demonstration of safety, gene
transfer and gene persistence,
even in the setting of repeat vec
tor / gene administration," Gard
ner said.
With cystic fibrosis being the
most common genetic disease
within the white population, the
success of this clinical trial will
serve as momentum for further
research to establish gene thera
py as a viable option to treat cys
tic fibrosis patients.
"Gene therapy is a completely
new approach in medicine,"
Gardner said. "The efficacy
remains to be proven. But if it
does prove to be effective, it
could be a dramatic shift in the
way we treat disease."
