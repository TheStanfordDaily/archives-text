a. How do those glow-in
• the-dark light sticks
?
A. If you've ever looked very
• closely at a light stick,
you've probably noticed there is
a small capsule inside. When
you bend the light stick to acti
vate it, the capsule breaks open,
and all of a sudden there's light!
Obviously, the chemicals
inside of the capsule mix with
the chemicals outside of the cap
sule to produce light. This pro
cess is known as chemilumines-

cence, referring
to the process of
creating light
from a chemical
reaction, usually
with virtually no

heat produced.
In everyday light bulbs,
though, things are different. If
you have ever looked carefully at
a normal incandescent light
bulb, it probably hurt your eyes a
lot.
Besides that, you probably
felt a lot of heat from the bulb.
In an incandescent bulb, the
light is generated by heating a
small filament inside of the bulb
to very high temperatures so it
starts giving off light.
This is not a very efficient
process. For example, in your
typical 60-watt light bulb, only
about two of those 60 watts that
the light bulb uses are given off

as visible light. When you think
about it, that really sucks.
Chemiluminescence, howev
er, doesn't suck half as much.
It can convert chemical ener
gy to light more efficiently
because almost no energy is
given off as heat. Chemilumi
nescence is also used in many
biological systems to produce
light.

The problem
is that chemilu
minescence and
it's biological
equivalent, bio
luminescence,

usually produce dimmer, cooler
lights, as opposed to the
brighter, warmer lights that
people seem to prefer. That's
why modern society is more
dependent on electrically pow
ered incandescent light bulbs
than on jars filled with fireflies.
There are three important
parts to a light stick.
The first two are an ester of
oxalic acid and an oxidizing
agent.
The oxidizing agent oxidizes
the oxalate ester. (Try saying
that five times fast.) This same
type of reaction causes things to
burn and iron to rust.
The product of the reaction is
the third component — a cyclic
peroxy, which is extremely
unstable.
This third component in a
light stick is a fluorescent dye.
The term fluorescent means that
when the dye is excited, or when
it has excess energy, it emits that
energy as visible light, unlike
other chemicals which typically
dissipate the energy as heat. The
cyclic peroxy reacts with the fluo
rescent dye and excites it, subse
quently causing it to release visi
ble light.The type of reaction
which is used in chemical light
sticks was discovered in 1960 and
can be up to 23 percent efficient.
On the other hand, biolumines
cent reactions such as those that
fireflies and glowing sea-plank
ton use are significantly more
efficient, approaching 100 per
cent efficiency.
If only we could harness the
power of the mighty firefly ...
