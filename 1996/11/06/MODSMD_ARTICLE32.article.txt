## Crossing barriers Gundersen takes reins 
### Erin M. Reilly 
Mark Gundersen's Florence Moore
Hall room suits him. Immaculate but
funky, the decor reveals his alternative
side.
The Stetson cowboy hat on the table
seems out of place among the second
hand furniture, tapestries and colored
Christmas lights, but Gundersen is a guy
who wears many hats.
The Anchorage, Alaska, native used to
be found wearing a baseball cap, but he
traded it for the cowboy hat after he was
roped into the 20-member Stanford
equestrian team last year.
The Stanford sophomore was recruit
ed by equestrian team members Vanessa
Bartsch and Kathleen Gilbert last win
ter. The two riders were Gundersen's
neighbors in Branner Hall and liked the
country music they heard coming from
his room. Sophomores Bartsch, the cur
rent Western team captain, and Gilbert,
a current team horse manager, cajoled
him into a visit to the Stanford Red Barn.
"Actually, they knew I wanted to go
riding, and I remember the first time I
went, Vanessa and Kathleen — they led
me around," Gundersen said. "They got
me on the horse but wouldn't let me go
— maybe it was a plan to make me come
back."
Now, with his improving record and
increasing points, Gundersen is consid
ered a key member of the team. Gunder
sen's improvement from last year is evi
dent in the move from sixth place to win
ning second place at the season opener at
Fresno State last month.
"Mark has a real enviable intensity —
he can just set his mind to something and

do it, and do it well," said Chris Balonek,
a friend and drawmate of Gundersen.
Gundersen rides in the beginning
Western walk/jog division along with
three other Stanford riders. Gundersen
and freshman Hyman Scott are the only
two men on the team.
Gundersen admits that his equestrian
teammates tease him.
"Yeah, I get the jokes, but it is
inevitable since I am one of the only
guys," he said. "It was strange to start
out as one of two guys on the team last
year, however, especially traveling — I
was stuck on a cot in a room full of
women. But thank God for the cot, or
else it would've been the floor."
The Stanford equestrian team has two
components, the Western team and the
English team. Although the styles of rid
ing are separate, both English and West
ern riders are judged on their presence,
style and effectiveness while riding a
horse they have never ridden before.
Horses are drawn by lottery at compe
titions. The judge evaluates the riders in
a group or may require the riders to indi
vidually perform a memorized pattern.
"The competitions are tough because
it is a matter of thinking about every
thing [coach Karine Boudoin] has taught
me and how to do it all at once," Gunder
sen said. "I like the competitions. I like it
when they [the judges] make us ride pat
terns. I like it when they are watching
you and only you."
Gundersen was not interested in rid
ing English style.
"I wasn't going to wear those tight
pants — no way," he said. Instead, he

Sophomore Mark Gundersen picked up riding just last year, but already he's making
a name for himself in the equestrian world.
wears jeans and a black pair of
cowboy boots. The boots aren't
Gundersen's campus fashion
statement though. They are
reserved for riding only.
"At home I wear my boots all
the time, but here I only wear
them at the barn," Gundersen
said.
You won't catch Gundersen in
his cowboy hat on campus
either. He is a jeans-and-flannel
kind of guy. And the music of
George Strait, Brooks & Dunn
and Alabama is only played in
his retro-Mirlo room when
roommate Jordan Branch isn't
there.
In the summertime, Gunder
sen wears another hat — a fish
ing hat. Gundersen's father, the
newly elected mayor of Sand
Point, Alaska, owns three fish
ing boats. For three months a
year, Gundersen works with his
father, grandfather and cousins
on their fishing boat in Sand
Point.
Gundersen said he likes Cali
fornia and its sunshine, but he
misses Alaska and its winter
snow. "I went from skiing 30
times per season to maybe
twice," Gundersen said. "I just
talked to my mom, and already
there's 2 feet of snow in Anchor
age.
"Since I haven't spent much
time at home since last spring
break, I'm eager to return home
for Christmas for both the skiing
and to spend time with my mom
and sister."

When not busy riding or doing
his science / math course load,
Gundersen keeps busy with
intramural basketball, movies
and the Stanford social scene.
Gundersen, a member of
Delta Tau Delta, said his friends
think "it's cool" that he rides,
but since there are no home
shows, Gundersen's friends do
not have the chance to see him
compete.
A former high school basket
ball player, Gundersen said his
second year on the riding team
differs fundamentally from his
first.
"I am more competitive
because I want to win my class
and I want to go to nationals,"
he said. "Last year I only wanted
to place."
Gundersen and the team have
more to deal with than just the
shows, however. The team has a
very limited number of horses.
"We were having to drive to
Cupertino for training, but now
we are able to use the English
horses [at the Red Barn] for
lessons," Gundersen said.
Riders are responsible for
equipment upkeep, feeding,
grooming and riding the horses
as well.
"I have things to work on,"
Gundersen said. "Mainly, being
able to adjust to a horse I have
never ridden and being able to
tell when it is going to break
[stride] and how to correct it."
Gundersen will have his
chance at the Western competi
tion next month. Meanwhile,
Gundersen's dedication to aca
demics and athletics at Stanford
proves that he is at home both
on the Farm and on the range.
