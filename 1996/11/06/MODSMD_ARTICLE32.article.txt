## Crossing barriers Gundersen takes reins

Mark Gundersen's Florence Moore
Hall room suits him. Immaculate but
funky, the decor reveals his alternative
side.
The Stetson cowboy hat on the table
seems out of place among the second
hand furniture, tapestries and colored
Christmas lights, but Gundersen is a guy
who wears many hats.
The Anchorage, Alaska, native used to
be found wearing a baseball cap, but he
traded it for the cowboy hat after he was
roped into the 20-member Stanford
equestrian team last year.
The Stanford sophomore was recruit
ed by equestrian team members Vanessa
Bartsch and Kathleen Gilbert last win
ter. The two riders were Gundersen's
neighbors in Branner Hall and liked the
country music they heard coming from
his room. Sophomores Bartsch, the cur
rent Western team captain, and Gilbert,
a current team horse manager, cajoled
him into a visit to the Stanford Red Barn.
"Actually, they knew I wanted to go
riding, and I remember the first time I
went, Vanessa and Kathleen — they led
me around," Gundersen said. "They got
me on the horse but wouldn't let me go
— maybe it was a plan to make me come
back."
Now, with his improving record and
increasing points, Gundersen is consid
ered a key member of the team. Gunder
sen's improvement from last year is evi
dent in the move from sixth place to win
ning second place at the season opener at
Fresno State last month.
"Mark has a real enviable intensity —
he can just set his mind to something and

do it, and do it well," said Chris Balonek,
a friend and drawmate of Gundersen.
Gundersen rides in the beginning
Western walk/jog division along with
three other Stanford riders. Gundersen
and freshman Hyman Scott are the only
two men on the team.
Gundersen admits that his equestrian
teammates tease him.
"Yeah, I get the jokes, but it is
inevitable since I am one of the only
guys," he said. "It was strange to start
out as one of two guys on the team last
year, however, especially traveling — I
was stuck on a cot in a room full of
women. But thank God for the cot, or
else it would've been the floor."
The Stanford equestrian team has two
components, the Western team and the
English team. Although the styles of rid
ing are separate, both English and West
ern riders are judged on their presence,
style and effectiveness while riding a
horse they have never ridden before.
Horses are drawn by lottery at compe
titions. The judge evaluates the riders in
a group or may require the riders to indi
vidually perform a memorized pattern.
"The competitions are tough because
it is a matter of thinking about every
thing [coach Karine Boudoin] has taught
me and how to do it all at once," Gunder
sen said. "I like the competitions. I like it
when they [the judges] make us ride pat
terns. I like it when they are watching
you and only you."
Gundersen was not interested in rid
ing English style.
"I wasn't going to wear those tight
pants — no way," he said. Instead, he

Sophomore Mark Gundersen picked up riding just last year, but already he's making
a name for himself in the equestrian world.
