# Now healthy, running back Mike Mitchell proves himself
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
Despite watching senior running
back Mike Mitchell rush for 1,040 yards,
average 4.7 yards per carry and score 13
touchdowns in his first three seasons at
Stanford, Cardinal fans entered this sea
son still wondering if the Phoenix native
would ever live up to the expectations
placed on him when he arrived here in
1993.
Cardinal fans need wonder no more.
After a slow start to the season, Mitchell
has steadily become the Cardinal's most
lethal offensive weapon and the running
back that everyone has been waiting to
see.
"He's stepped it up big time for us
this season, and he's doing what we all
kind of expected he would do," said
sophomore quarterback Chad Hutchin
son. "He's a big-time player, and we
knew it was a matter of time."
Mitchell arrived on the Farm as a
consensus high school Ail-American and
arguably the top running back prospect
in America. During his freshman cam
paign, Mitchell performed well for the
Cardinal, leading the team in all-pur
pose yardage with 85.7 yards per game.
However, in his sophomore and
junior seasons, injuries began to plague
Mitchell, and he slowly began to be crit
icized by the media for his lack of tough
ness and proneness to injury. He missed
all but the first three games his sopho
more year (which he took as a redshirt
year) due to an ankle injury and sat out
two games last season with a dislocated
elbow.
Even though Mitchell returned from
his elbow injury two weeks sooner than
doctors expected, he was still hearing it
from the press about his injuries.
"I don't really care what other people
say," Mitchell said, responding to the
criticism. "I want my teammates to
respect me, and if they didn't, that
would hurt me.
"I think I am tough; I have played
through a lot of injuries. [Last] year, I
dislocated my elbow and couldn't play
for the rest of the season. It was a fluke
accident that I don't think anyone could
play through." .
After working out this past $14 miner,
Mitchell put his injury demons behind
him and entered this season with the
confidence that he could lead the Stan
ford team. But like the entire Cardinal
offense, Mitchell had a slow start to the
season, rushing for only 105 yards on 29
carries (3.6 yards per carry) in the first
three games of the season. In addition,
he failed to find the end zone in all three
games.
However, since the opening of Pacific
10 Conference play five games ago,
Mitchell has taken his play to a new
level, rushing for 376 yards in his last
five games (75.2 yards per game). He

has also racked up 189 receiving yards
on the year, surpassing his season totals
from the past three years.
"The running game has developed all
season, and luckily it has been my turn
to carry the ball," said Mitchell, who has
scored four of the last seven Stanford
touchdowns. "I just feel like it is some
thing I have to do for the team. Every
time you go out there you try to make

plays, and lately it's been happening for
me."
The development of the running
game that Mitchell speaks of has been a
slow and sometimes painful process to
watch this year. Both Mitchell and
junior Anthony Bookman have been
running behind an inexperienced offen-

sive line that has needed time to
jell and mature.
"Week in and week out they
have improved so much, and it was
great to see how they performed on
Saturday," Mitchell said.
It is no accident, either, that as
the line has improved so has
Mitchell. Regardless, it has been
his ability to break tackles and
make people miss that people are

starting to notice.
"It's a tremendous lift when it
takes two or three guys to bring
him down, and you know that one
guy can't tackle him," Hutchinson
said. "Watching him run hard
gives us all a lift."
However, Mitchell doesn't feel
his running game has changed that
much this year. "I have always
been able to do different things; I
just haven't been able to do it con
sistently for a long period of time,"
he said. "I think in these last four
games I was able to do my job
throughout the entire game."

Consistency is the key to
Mitchell's game. If he stays on pace
with his current statistics, he will
have the best season of his career.
Yet he is not quite satisfied.
"You always try to make every
play your best play, and I really
haven't done that yet," he said.
"You are always striving for that
perfect game and I haven't had
that game since I have been at
Stanford."
There's no doubt, however, that
with three games left in this season
and all of next year, Mitchell will
eventually have that perfect game.
