In addition to completing 22 of 32 passes for 268 yards
and two touchdowns, sophomore quarterback Chad
Hutchinson directed the final drive that led the Cardinal
to a surprising 21-20 road win over on Saturday.
He completed all seven of his passes for 76 yards, includ
ing the game-winning, 10-yard lob to senior flanker Brian
Manning, exciting those Cardinal fans who made the trip
to the Rose Bowl.

Ten thousand fans in one's home state might intimi
date some people, but for junior outside hitter Debbie
a native of Hawaii, the large crowd at the
women's volleyball game in Honolulu Saturday just
sparked her fire. She contributed key kills to pull a star
tled Stanford squad out of a tough 15-5 first-game loss to
eventually dismantle the top-ranked team in the country
with wins in three consecutive games, 15-11, 15-6, 15-9.
