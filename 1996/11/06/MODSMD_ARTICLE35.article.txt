# Walk-on proud to earn soot on squad
## Mathieson polishes hoops skills

The Stanford men's basketball
team has been practicing for less
than a month, but already its
members are gaining prominence
in the Bay Area press. Last week,
for example, the front page of the
San Jose Mercury News sports
section featured an immense pho
tograph of. . . Mike Mathiesen?
Sure enough, there was Math
iesen, a freshman walk-on from
Cupertino, gracing the section
cover. Granted, he was guarding
Cardinal star Tim Young, the
subject of the accompanying
story. But the shot nevertheless
showed Mathiesen, all 6-foot-7 of
him, straining to play low-post
defense in full color.
The picture could well be taken
as a symbol of things to come for
Mathiesen. Having learned last
week that he had succeeded in his
attempt to walk on to the team.
Mathiesen is beginning to
to his role as a varsity player
That job includes a heavy dose of
post defense, and Mathiesen can
expect that page one scene to
repeat itself thousands of times
over the course of the season.
The young man from Cuperti
no High School understands this.
He knows that he is on the team
mainly to fill out a practice roster.
He is well aware that his head
coach, Mike Montgomery, says
chances are slim that Mathiesen
will ever find himself playing in a
game.
He doesn't seem to care.
"Just being a part of Stanford

basketball is a dream come true,"
he said.
That attitude, Montgomery
said, is shared by all four of the
non-scholarship players on this
year's team. Each walk-on takes
the approach of "How am we help
this basketball team?" according
to Montgomery.
"With that kind of mindset, we
all benefit," Montgomery said.
A positive outlook is crucial
due to the nature of the walk-on
role. Montgomery said his pro-

gram uses non-scholarship play
ers to fill holes on the practice
roster. Having walk-ons allows
for three full teams, with no play
ers practicing out of position. And
while the role of the walk-on is
usually confined to practice, in
some cases it extends to the play
ing court.
Three years ago, walk-on point
guard Warren Gravely played
"quality minutes" behind then
freshman Brevin Knight, Mont
gomery said. In one game in par
ticular, Gravely played an extend
