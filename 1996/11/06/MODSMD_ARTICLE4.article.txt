## Big Game Bonfire moved from Arrillaga to Wilbur Field 
### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
The Big Game Bonfire will burn
on Wilbur Field this year, but the
head of the Axe Committee said
chances are good for the event to re
turn to Lake Lagunita by next year.
The Nov. 22 bonfire, which is ex
pected to be approved by the Santa
Clara County fire marshal soon, will
move to the field behind Wilbur Hall
this year. For the past two years, its
home has been Arrillaga Plaza.

According to Axe Comm Chair Jeremy Schreiber,
a junior,the move will allow for a larger blaze and a
location more convenient for students.
Schreiber noted that the Arrillaga location is on
the edge of campus. The more central Wilbur site

has the potential of attracting students who might
not have planned to go to the bonfire. "We're hoping
for a little more of a walk-up crowd," he said.
And while Schreiber was enthusiastic about the
Wilbur blaze, he said he is looking forward to the
possibility of returning the bonfire to lake for the
100 th anniversary of Big Game next year. The com
mittee did not push for a return to the lake this year,
though, for fear of jeopardizing the long-term
chances of having the huge bonfire again, he said.
Axe Comm Adviser Jon Erickson, the Universi
ty's bursar, stressed that the ultimate goal is still to
return to the lake. "Anything short of Lagunita is
less than acceptable," he said. "I say that every year,
and the Axe Committee over the past three years has
said that, too."
Erickson praised Schreiber for being patient with


Erickson
the situation. He said Wilbur
Field was the "best alternative
option available."
Schreiber said a two-part
study focusing on the habitat of
the tiger salamander must be
completed before plans to move
the bonfire back to the lake can

proceed. The first half, a biologi
cal study that charted the where
abouts and overall population of
the salamanders, has already
been done.
The second half, a feasibility
study that looks at what can be
done without harming the habi
tat, is yet to be finished. Once the
entire survey is complete, though,
Schreiber feels that "things look
very good" for the move.
"We're definitely not out to

hurt salamanders or habitat, but
if things are OK, like they look
like they will be, we don't want to
wait anymore," Schreiber said,
noting that the Class of 1997 has
already suffered as a result of the
slow process.
"It pains me to know that
there is a class that will go four
years" without a Lagunita bon
fire, he said. "But (the Wilbur
Field) event will still bring out the
Big Game spirit."
