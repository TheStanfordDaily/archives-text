# Senate discusses proposed changes in judicial system
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback, ch ur of the Com
mittee of 15, emphasized the need for n form in the
process of adjudicating 1 lonor Code and fundamental
Standard violations at the ASSU Senate meeting last
night.
After considering the recommendations of stu
dents, faculty and staff, the committee has prepared
its draft recommendat ions, which Zoback presented at
last night's senate meeting.
Zoback highlighted several proposed changes in the
judicial system that he said would ensure greater stu
dent control of the process.
"With the major elements defined, we thought this

was a good time for you to see (the pro
posal |, for the Faculty Senate to see it
and to get your opinions," Zoback said
in his opening statement. The recom
mendations will be presented to the
Faculty Senate at its meeting tomor
row.
"Of all the current problems with
the judicial system, the most egre
gious is that judicial procedures, as

they occur today, are administrative
procedures," Zoback said. "Decisions are made by Uni
versity administrators rather than by the students."
Under the draft recommendations, "even- single


Zoback
case that is brought forward will
be heard by a judicial panel made
up of mostly students and chaired
by a student," Zoback said. Those
panels "will require near unanimi
ty to reach a decision — only one
dissenting vote will be allowed."
The recommendations also in
clude the creation of a new Univer
sity position to alleviate a problem
of "ambiguous and conflicting
roles."
Currently, Judicial Affairs Offi
cer Jennifer Perkins is charged
with advising those students
brought up on judicial charges and
gathering evidence regarding their
cases, including evidence against
them.
The committee's recommenda
tions divide those duties between
two positions — the judicial advis
er and the judicial officer. The for
mer will server as neutral adviser
to all parties, and the latter will act
as investigator.
Zoback also suggested that it
takes too long to conclude a case.
"It was commonly taking six
months to adjudicate cases in
which the facts were not in dis
pute," he said, indicating that
cases requiring a review of the
facts often dragged out longer.
Zoback was extensively ques
tioned on the burden of proof
issue. The committee has suggest
ed that the current burden of proof
— beyond a reasonable doubt — is
inappropriate for an administra
tive panel. He advocated a reduc
tion to the "more reasonable"
clear and convincing evidence
standard.
Zoback said that his committee
would refer the decision to the stu
dent body.
He asked the senate to "return
to [the Committee of 151 by the

end of fall quarter or by the begin
ning of winter quarter a sense of
the senate resolution on what [itj
thinks the burden of proof should
be."
Many in the senate, however,
voiced strong concern over the
issue. The senate must approve
any changes in the judicial char
ter.
"This discussion really does
threaten to derail the whole
process," ASSU President Bill
Shen said. "I am strongly opposed
too any lowering of the burden of
proof."
The president has the power to
veto a resolution of the senate ap
proving a modified burden of
proof. Shen was hesitant to com
mit to using his executive authori
ty, but he said that he would fight
the proposed changes.
Zoback, however, wanted to
avoid a confrontation.
"In a great majority of cases,
whether or not the burden of proof
is beyond a reasonable doubt or
clear and convincing evidence; it's
not that important," Zoback ar
gued. "This process should not be
hijacked by an issue that is not
critical to most of cases that are in
the system."
Controversy also arose over a
bill appointing ASSU Senate as
sociates — freshmen and transfer
students who serve as ex officio
senators representing those pop
ulations. Shen raised a concern
that the associates had been se
lected by ASSU Senate Deputy
Chair Joe Freund rather than the
ASSU Nominations Commission,
as mandated by the ASSU By
laws.
ASSU Senate Chair Don Aing
worth agreed and ruled the bill out
of order.
Tempers flared during an ex
change of parliamentary maneu
vers between Shen and Aing
worth. The confrontation culmi
nated when Shen directed ASSU

Vice President Nick Thompson to
exercise his constitutional author
ity to oust the chair, preside over
the senate and reverse Aing
worth's controversial ruling.
The senate vindicated Aing
worth, however, supporting the
initial ruling even with Thompson
in the chair.
Also approved was an ASSU
Publications Board request for
$3,818.93 to purchase additional
computer hardware. The board
had requested an additional
$1,791.23 for software, but the
senate withheld a decision on that
question until it could determine if
some of the requested software
could be obtained free of charge
through a Stanford site license.
The senate also approved
Thompson's resolution in support
a progressive endowment fund,
calling upon the administration,
the Stanford Management Co. and
the Stanford Fund to assist
Thompson "to bring this plan to
fruition as soon as possible."
In other business, the senate
suspended three of its graduate
members — Josh Becker, Michael
Peterson and Sabrina Tardy. All
three have yet to attend a meeting.
Another absence this quarter will
constitute grounds for their expul
sion, Aingworth said.
Jewell Hudson, director of
ASSU Legal Counseling, asked
senators to warn their con
stituents of telephone con-artists
that requests victims' credit card
numbers in exchange for informa
tion about a free trip.
"Don't give anyone your credit
card number over the phone un
less you initiated the call," Jewell
warned, stating that a surprising
number of students — especially
graduate students — had fallen
prey to the scam.
The senate will again take up
consideration of the proposed judi
cial reform at its next meeting on
Nov. 19.
