## Five bypasses? Yeltsin surgery successful 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) - Boris
Yeltsin's heart bypass surgery
was pronounced a success yester
day and surgeons predicted a full
recovery, easing anxiety that has
hobbled Russia for months.
Yeltsin could take back his
powers and the nuclear button in
two days but may not go back to
his office until the new year. The
operation lasted seven hours and
involved five bypasses.
Yeltsin regained consciousness
about five hours later, was heavi
ly sedated and was still on a respi
rator to guard against postopera
tive complications. Doctors said
they couldn't predict when he
could leave the hospital.
Dr. Renat Akchurin, leader of
the 12-man surgical team that
conducted the coronary artery
bypass operation, would not spec
ify the number of bypasses, saying
only it "significantly exceeded"
the three or four doctors initially
had speculated might be neces
sary.
Dr. George Noon of Houston,
who was among the consultants
who flew to Moscow to observe
the surgery, said early yesterday
that Yeltsin had five bypasses.
Doctors said Yeltsin's blood
circulation had been improved

significantly.
Yeltsin's long illness has left
Russia with a part-time leader at
best and spawned power struggles
among presidential wannabes.
Financial markets trembled at
rumors about his health and the
government, by many accounts,
was near paralysis.
Dr. Yevgeny Chazov, head of
the Moscow Cardiological Center
where the operation was per
formed, said there were not any
complications during the sur
gery.
Dr. Michael Deßakey, the
American heart surgery pioneer
who is a consultant on the case
and who trained Akchurin,
declared it a success.
"I would predict the president
to be able to return to his office
and perform his duty in perfectly
normal fashion," said Deßakey,
who watched the operation on a
monitor outside the operating
room with a team of American
and German consultants.
It could be a day or two before
Yeltsin, 65, is well enough to
reclaim the presidential powers,
including control over Russia's
immense nuclear arsenal, that he
handed off to Prime Minister Vik
tor Chernomyrdin before the

surgery.
"He is going to decide that for
himself," a weary Akchurin told
reporters. "Most probably it will
happen tomorrow or the day
after."
President Clinton's press sec
retary, Mike McCurry, said Cher
nomyrdin called Clinton to report
that the operation "had gone well
and President Yeltsin is doing
well."
Clinton expressed "the very
best wishes of the American peo
ple to President Yeltsin," McCur
ry said.
Akchurin said Yeltsin would
likely remain on a respirator
overnight to minimize the chance
of complications. The president's
postoperative treatment depends
on how soon Yeltsin is breathing
on his own, he said.
A presidential spokesman said
Yeltsin regained consciousness
but was heavily sedated.
Yeltsin was on a heart-lung
machine for 68 minutes during
surgery, Akchurin said.
The president's illness has
tested the frankness of the Krem
lin, a hulking fortress that for
centuries has hoarded informa
tion about Russia's leaders with
an implacable zeal.
