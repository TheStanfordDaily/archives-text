YOU ARE NOT WHAT THEY THINK
It's in there. Somewhere. That double secret part of
you. The part that dreams and smolders in anticipation.,.
The part that's itching and writhing with the need to

Well join the club. We mean it. Because that's just the kind of energy it
takes to create the world's best internetworking products.
Look in. Is there a character inside you who can't sleep because

That's the part of you we want to know. The Cisco that's inside you.
