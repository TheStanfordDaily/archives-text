This week, I am In a bad mood. A bad, bad, bad mood. It
must only be the weather or midterms or something equally
temporary and inconsequential, but it feels big and permanent
and I think it might be your fault. In order to explain things,

intermission@daily. (Oh, and due to a computer glitch, all the
ones people sent last week will go in next week. Sorry. But let's
not allow it to get in the way of our friendship, eh, Spartacus?)
