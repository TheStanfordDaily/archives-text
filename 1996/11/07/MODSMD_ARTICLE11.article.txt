## Cabinet secretaries resign Many Clinton advisers will return to private life 
### 
'.WASHINGTON (AP) - The
anchors of President Clinton's national
security team — Warren Christopher
a(id William Perry — led a snowballing
exodus of at least six Cabinet officials
Wednesday in a sweeping second-term
staff shakeup.
Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor
told Clinton he intended to resign to

return to California.
Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary, out of
favor, also was quit
ting, officials said.
Transportation
Secretary Federico
Pena and Housing
Secretary Henry Cis
neros were expected to
leave, as well, admin
istration officials said.

White House officials were waging a
behind-the-scenes campaign for Attor
ney General Janet Reno to go; she
wants to stay.
As the president returned tri
umphantly to the White House from
victory celebrations in Arkansas,
Washington buzzed with leaks about
resignations and speculation about
successors. No formal announcements
were expected before a Cabinet meet
ing on Friday.
There were varying reasons for the
staff reshuffling. Some, like presiden
tial senior adviser George
Stephanopoulos, made no secret of the
fact they are worn out. Outgoing chief
of staff Leon Panetta is considering
running for governor of California.
Some officials — O'Leary, Reno — were
nudged toward the door. In general,
Clinton wants to reinvigorate his presi
dency.
Christopher, 71, and Perry, 69, are
highly regarded but, after countless
trips to world trouble spots, have tired
of the job.
Kantor, a political warrior who
helped engineer Clinton's 1992 victo
ry, is bored at Commerce. He was
believed to be interested in becoming
White House chief of staff or attorney

general, but now is said to have
dropped those ideas.
Reno upset the White House over
seeing Waco and Whitewater. Popular
in Washington, she is not considered a
team player. Recognizing she would be
tough to shove aside, White House offi
cials are waging campaign of leaks
against her, noting her battle with
Parkinson's disease. Her doctors say
she has a mild case and it is not a prob
lem.
Labor Secretary Robert Reich is wel
come to stay, officials said, but appears
inclined to leave. Reich told associates
he'll talk about his future over the
weekend with his family, which has
moved back to Boston.
Pena wounded himself by mishan
dling the ValuJet crash. Chicago Mayor
Richard Daley's brother, Bill, is a possi
ble successor.
Cisneros, while popular with Clin
ton, is under investigation for allegedly
concealing information about payments
to a former mistress.
Republicans, strengthening their
grip on the Senate, will have veto power
over all Cabinet replacements. That
raises the possibility that Clinton, in a
bipartisan gesture, would install some

Republicans in high
administration posi
tions.
"It's a chance for
him to reach out and
be very bipartisan and
even appoint some
Republicans in a way
which indicates a real
willingness to work
together," House
Speaker Newt Gin-

grich said.
Clinton's former political strategist,
Dick Morris, also said it would be good
idea to put Republicans in the Cabinet.
The president also could try to avoid
ugly confirmation battles by turning to
readily acceptable choices, such as
retiring senators. For example, Demo
crat Sam Nunn of Georgia and Republi
can William Cohen of Maine both have

backgrounds in defense issues. Former
Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell also is available.
A few Cabinet secretaries appear
likely to stay: Donna Shalala at Health
and Human Services, Robert Rubin at
Treasury, Dan Glickman at Agriculture
and Bruce Babbitt at Interior. CIA
Director John Deutch is a leading can-

didate for the Pen
tagon job.
Education Secretary
Richard Riley said he
is "tired but happy"
and intends to speak
with Clinton about his
future. His job is safe
if he wants to stay,
White House officials
said. So is Veterans
Secretary Jesse

Brown's, they said.
Christopher informed Clinton of his
decision Tuesday night as they savored
the president's re-election. Even so, the
secretary plans to go to Cairo, Egypt,
and Paris next week for conferences on
economic development in the Middle
East and on Bosnia's recovery from
war.
Speculation about the next secretary
of state has centered on Anthony Lake,
the president's national security assis
tant; Madeleine Albright, the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations; and
Mitchell.
Other possibilities: Richard Hol
brooke, who helped negotiate a settle
ment of the war in Bosnia, retired Gen.
Colin Powell, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, a longtime Clinton friend.
Former White House deputy chief of
staff Erskine Bowles is considered a top
candidate to replace Panetta, but he is
reluctant to leave North Carolina.
Deputy national security adviser Sandy
Berger and deputy chief of staff Harold
Ickes also are candidates.
Democratic National Committee
Chairman Christopher Dodd also said
he will be leaving that post, probably in
January.
