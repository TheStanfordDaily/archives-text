GOP majority sets goals
WASHINGTON (AP) - Savoring their
renewed majority, Republican congressional lead
ers spoke optimistically yesterday of cooperation
with President Clinton on their agenda of tax cuts
and smaller government.
"We don't have to live in a world of confronta
tion," said Speaker Newt Gingrich.
At the same time, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott promised a probe into the allegations
of Democratic campaign Financial misdeeds that
Bob Dole raised in his losing bid for the White
House. "We have a responsibility in a variety of
ways to take a look at .. . what appears to be
wrongdoing," he said.
Republicans are expected to take a few weeks to
sort out their plans for the Congress that con
venes in January, but some elements were clear
even before the final votes were counted in Tues
day's undecided congressional races.
In an interview, Gingrich renewed his promise
to have a constitutional amendment on term lim
its as the first substantive issue on the House
floor next year.
Lott, at a news conference, suggested a bal
anced budget amendment to the Constitution
might be voted on early, as well. That passed the
House in 1995 but failed by a single vote in the
Senate, with Clinton lobbying lawmakers to

oppose it.
It marked the first time in 66 years that Repub
licans had held onto a House majority. Even so,
the loss of a few seats is likely to strengthen the
hand of moderates in both political parties — the
Republicans who want to sand down the sharper
edges of their own party's agenda and the
Democrats who are willing to reach across the
aisle on key issues.
209 headed to court
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The fight over affirma
tive action moved from the voting booth to the
courthouse yesterday, with both sides filing suit
over Proposition 209, the measure banning race
and gender considerations in public hiring, con
tracting and education.
In Sacramento, the conservative Pacific Legal
Foundation filed suit in Superior Court seeking to
enforce the newly approved proposition.
The suit asks for a court order stopping three
government agencies from granting preferential
treatment on the basis of race and sex. The agen
cies are the Board of Governors of the California
Community Colleges, the State Lottery Commis
sion and the Department of General Services.
Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union
filed suit in U.S. District Court in San Francisco,
challenging the proposition as unconstitutional.

At stake was the question both sides had bat
tled over throughout the campaign: Exactly what
will Proposition 209 do?
Supporters said the vote opened the door to
equality and erased programs that pit race against
race.
But opponents said the measure would slam
doors shut, affecting everything from diversity
hiring programs to outreach aimed at minority
youth.
Backers of the initiative said in advance that
they were prepared for a court fight.
"Unlike what happened with Prop. 187, when
we were basically caught sleeping, this time we're
ready for them," said Robert Corry of the Pacific
Legal Foundation.
Proposition 187, passed in 1994, was intended
to cut off most state services to illegal aliens, but
it remains tied up in court.
Democrats seize statehouse
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Assembly Democrats,
running as the minority party and without master
strategist Willie Brown, have apparently regained
the lower house and its powerful speakership.
With some of Tuesday's races for seats thrown
open by term limits separated by as few as 20
votes, Democrats took what appeared to be a 44-
36 majority. However, numbers could change

when thousands of absentees ballots are counted
in seven close races.
Republicans two years ago surprised them
selves and Democrats by emerging with a 41-39
majority, their first since 1968, and setting off a
year of chaos over control of the Assembly.
Senate Democrats, meanwhile, not only
retained their majority, but picked up a seat for a
24-15 lead, with one independent, depending on
the final counts in two close races.
The Assembly had 31 and the Senate 10 open
seats, mostly caused by term limits. That 1990 ini
tiative, limiting Assembly members to three two
year terms and senators to two four-year terms,
hit hard for the first time this year
Perot made no difference
(AP) — It looks like President Clinton would
have beaten Bob Dole by about the same margin if
Ross Perot hadn't been on the ballot.
The Election Day results, with 99 percent of
precincts reporting, were: Clinton, 49 percent;
Dole, 41 percent; Perot, 8 percent Other third
party candidates got a combined 2 percent.
Asked who they would have voted for if only
Clinton and Dole had been on the ballot, 30 per
cent of Perot's voters said they would have backed
Clinton, 30 percent said they would have backed
Dole and 36 percent said they wouldn't have voted.
