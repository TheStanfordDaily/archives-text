## Investing responsibly 
### 
ASSU bill to encourage
progressive endowment
is an important first step

The long struggle for
investment responsibility
at Stanford took a new turn
Tuesday night when the ASSU
Senate passed a bill urging the
administration, the Stanford Man
agement Co. and the Stanford
Fund to set up a progressive
endowment fund to be invested
only in companies that meet very
specific ethical criteria.
The senate should be applaud
ed for focusing student attention
onto an area of University policy
— the investment decisions of
the Stanford Management Co. —
that all too often goes unchal
lenged.
Investment responsibility:
What does it really mean? Funda
mentally, the idea is that compa
nies must look beyond pure profit
maximization and take some
responsibility for the conse
quences of their investments. It
means injecting a moral factor
into decisions normally made on
the basis of pure economic ratio
nality. It means, in short, a will
ingness to sacrifice marginal
short-term gains in investment
return for the long-term better
ment of society.
Needless to say, it is not an idea
wholeheartedly embraced by most
commercial corporations or invest
ment banks.
Investment responsibility is,
however, an ideal that Stanford
has pledged itself to support.
While the most radical laissez
faire ideologues argue that compa
nies have no responsibility beyond
maximizing profits, the Stanford
Board of Trustees has recognized
that Stanford's stature as an edu
cational institution requires that
it pay special attention to the
moral factors involved in investing
its roughly $4 billion endowment;
hence, the creation in 1977 of the

Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility.
So while the debate over invest
ment responsibility appears to pit
idealistic college students against
callous corporate managers, the
fact is that neither side is sticking
to a very extreme position. The
senate is not asking the Stanford
Management Co. to invest exclu
sively in politically correct compa
nies, profits be damned; nor is the
Stanford Management Co. insist
ing that it have free reign to invest
the endowment however it pleas
es, society be damned.
The debate is over how best to
go about the delicate task of mak
ing Stanford's investment portfo
lio both more profitable and more
responsible, and the proposal to
set up a progressive endowment
fund is a very reasonable step in
the right direction.
There are, of course, some
important details, both theoretical
and practical, that have yet to be
worked out. One immediate con
cern is the issue of what consti
tutes a "socially responsible" com
pany; conservatives have good rea
son to fear that the fund would be
biased toward companies that tow
the liberal line on contentious
social issues like abortion.
What's more, it is not yet clear
how the progressive fund can be
built up through alumni solicita
tion. The Stanford Fund appears
to be the obvious means of pro
moting the new fund, but the
Stanford Fund director is afraid
that a progressive endowment
solicitation would muddy its cur
rently successful marketing mes
sage.
What is needed to get the pro
posal rolling is a push from the
top, a public endorsement by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper.
Surely, the bright people in the
administration, the management
company and the Stanford Fund
can find a reasonable way to set up
an investment fund that would
further Stanford's claim to invest
ment responsibility.
