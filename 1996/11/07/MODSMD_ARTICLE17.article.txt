4 "T") OLITICAL CORRECTNESS"
is a burr in my ass. And a
JL mighty big and encompassing
burr it is.
You're being PC if you don't want
Christmas decorations in your dorm
because you know people who are Jew
ish.
You are being PC if you say African
American when you really want to say
nigger.
You are being PC if you whine about
tiny insignificant jokes in the dorm like
those of the "Mommy, Mommy" vari
ety.
You are being PC if you don't give a
flying fig what the people next door feel
when you jump them in line at the ATM
and call them "chinks," but you use the
term Asian American / Pacific Islander
in your papers.
You are being PC if you seriously
object to being called a "flaming whore"
or if you don't like that the guy next
door has a picture of a woman on his
wall.
There is something wrong with the
political atmosphere in America if polit
ical talk has gotten to the point where
people with legitimate complaints and
people who simply have a lack of humor
can both be referred to using the same
terminology.
The activists are being confused with
the "whine by night, whine by day" peo
ple.
Politically correct, in my under

standing of the term, refers to people
who are acting or talking a specific way
just so their politics seem correct. A
politically correct person is not a correct
person. A politically correct person sim
ply seems correct. But we don't use the
term that way.
Instead, we apply it to anyone who
seems to care just a little bit about any
one besides themselves. You are politi
cally correct if you believe in affirma
tive action, no matter that you are a
direct beneficiary of it. You are politi
cally correct if you are pro-choice, no
matter that you have a friend who was
raped and got pregnant.
Those of you who have gripes with
informed activists who actually try to
solve problems should take a good hard
look at what you are actually griping
about.
It may be a popular thing right now
to actually care that the commonly
accepted paradigm is completely
untrue, but it is far from a new belief.
Those of us who have been oppressed in
the past have been protesting all along.
Equal rights isn't a new idea.
The term politically correct is a gift
from The Man. The very purpose of the
term is to make the legitimate seem ille
gitimate.
And we are all helping.
We add coals to the flame by com
plaining vehemently about tiny things
like whether someone feels offended by
a Claudia Schiffer picture on the wall or

the song "The Titanic."
Instead of spending our energy try
ing to say, help out at the Women's
Center with Rape Awareness Week, we
whine. Instead of trying to help victims
of Traumatic Stress Syndrome by work
ing at a VA hospital, we whine. We are
making it damn hard for those who
truly don't care about what we stand
for to tell us from those who just want
something to say.
The power to name is the most
potent power a person can have. It's
even traceable to the Bible.
Just take a look at who is naming
who. We wouldn't have had to cam
paign against Proposition 209 if its
writers had mentioned that it would kill
affirmative action. So the writers made
sure to call it preferential treatment
because it sounds more menacing.
Naming is empowering. Not so long
ago, it was not acceptable to be called
black or queer or Chicano.
But communities have taken over
the terminology and made it their own
by changing the meaning. Let's change
the meaning of politically correct; let's
apply it to those who do not give a
damn.
