Letter condemning Clinton was exaggerated, incorrect

I WRITE IN response to Ally Field's
letter which was printed in Mon
day's Daily. Field's letter used very
hyperbolic, emotional language in
deploring two actions undertaken by
President Clinton. Disguised by her
rhetoric is the fact that her logic and
reasoning have very little factual basis
to stand on.
When dealing with the welfare bill,
Field shies away from the contextual
facts of the bill. She neglects to mention
that President Clinton has promised to
undo some of the bill's harsher mea
sures, and that many liberal Democrats,
such as Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, feel
that shifting welfare to states and locali
ties may be beneficial in the long run.
The Clinton administration has already
had remarkable success in moving 1.8
million people off welfare. Proposals
such as targeted tax cuts for businesses
that hire welfare recipients, the raising

of the minimum wage and the guarantee
of child care contained in the welfare bill
may serve to move many more welfare
recipients into the work force to stay.
Field states that our bombing of Iraq
went unsupported by our allies when, in
fact, our actions were endorsed by
Britain, Germany, Japan, Israel, Canada,
the NATO alliance and, after some time,
France. The fact that it was not endorsed
by Congress is irrelevant; Congressional
approval of such an action is not consti
tutionally required. Furthermore, there
is no doubt that, had Congress voted,
they would have approved a military
response, perhaps one more forceful than
the one we implemented.
I am very disturbed by Field's classifi
cation of our actions. As someone famil
iar with the Middle East, she must know
of the terrible actions which Saddam
Hussein has committed against the Kur
dish people and that America and its

allies have pledged themselves to protect
the Kurds of Northern Iraq from his
aggression. According to witnesses,
when Saddam's troops invaded Kurdis
tan last August, they killed hundreds of
Kurds. The Iraqi actions represented a
clear threat to the Kurds and demanded
a swifl response. It is regrettable that
we had to use force, but it is the only
way to stop Saddam. It is ludicrous to
call our limited strikes on isolated mili
tary targets em atrocity when reacting
forcefully to the Iraqi aggression may
have saved hundreds or thousands of
Kurdish lives.
Finally, it is a common misperception
in the West that the United Nations
embargo has kept food away from the
Iraqi people. T.D. Allman, a writer for
The New Yorker magazine, originally
believed that but came to a different
conclusion after visiting Iraq. Allman
found "no evidence that people were suf

fering and dying because of the embar
go." The embargo, in fact, allows "a wide
scope of humanitarian intervention." He
observed that malnutrition in Iraq is
instead due to "Saddam's willful
destructiveness." Hunger in Iraq is due
to the actions of Saddam. He controls
the supply of food in Iraq and is able to
deny it from those who oppose him. Sad
dam has also drained marshes in the
southern part of Iraq, essentially
"destroying the lives of 2 million people
for control purposes" while he builds
monuments to himself.
If anything, Field's argument has
much more to do with misinformation
than justified moral outrage. President
Clinton's actions deserve much more
consideration than a cursory, biased
analysis laden with errors and half
truths.
