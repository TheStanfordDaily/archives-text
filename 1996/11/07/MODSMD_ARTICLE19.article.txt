# Recent reunion proved a great success except for the Stanford Band
## 
### 
Several weeks ago it was our privilege
to attend our 40th graduation celebra
tion. Being old alumni on campus again
was a distinct treat, and there is much to
commend. The showcases were very
good, and so were most of the mini-cours
es. The undergraduates who were servers
went out of their way to make us old-

timers feel at home. More than a few
engaged us in good conversations both
about their own careers and about the
"good old days" on the Farm. The weath
er cooperated magnificently, and the
Stanford football team even squeaked by,
as you know, in the overtime period to
win against Oregon to make that a spe
cial event for us all. Provost Condoleezza
Rice had very insightful remarks to make
Sunday morning which should really be
printed and shared, and even the service
at Memorial Church was quite fine. We
will not comment on the electrical black
out Thursday evening — it provided us

all with good jokes, and University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper covered up well at
the Friday morning panel discussion.
About the only negative remark most
of us would have made is about the
Stanford Band. It was frankly pathetic,
not just compared with Oregon's but
compared to what we remember. We all
like the rebellious spirit of the Band, and
in the past the Band has done some very
clever maneuvers. But when members
don't bother to wear uniforms or march
in step, it comes across as ineptitude,
not innovation. And playing a tribute to
Jackie Chan and Philip Zimbardo?

C'mon, give us a break!
That said, the effort of Stanford to
host alumni groups was tremendous,
and the organizers — not just of our
Class of '56 but of all the years — were
outstanding. It is a real tribute to a
great University that we can have this
kind of gathering at all, and that it was
carried out with such panache and style
is a credit to all concerned.
Many thanks again! It was a great
weekend for all from the early classes of
'36 down to that of '91. Keep it up!
