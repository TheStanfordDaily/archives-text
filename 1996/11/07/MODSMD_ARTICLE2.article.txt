# Service program expands
## 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
Encouraged by a major award and new funding,
Stanford's Alternative Spring Break program is ex
panding and adding new features, including a class
room component and a program to help participants
stay involved in community service.
Each year, Alternative Spring Break gives nearly

100 students the chance to spend their vacation doing
public service projects ranging from helping the home
less in Ix)s Angeles to doing environmental work.
year, Alternative Spring Break was chosen for
the "Program of the Year" award by Break Away, a
nonprofit organization that coordinates alternative
spring break programs nationwide.
Senior Paul Kim, the program's
adviser, said he was excited both by
the award and by the opportunities
to expand the program that have
resulted from approval of its ASSU
special-fee request last spring.
He said the program last year
sponsored eight groups, each con
sisting of 12 students. This year

that figure will be expanded to 11
groups.
According to Kim, there were
about 150 applicants for the 96
spots last year. "We turned so
many people away last year. We
felt really terrible," he said.
The 132 students expected to
participate this year will find sev
eral notable changes to the pro
gram. Students in four of the 11
groups will take a two-unit course
during winter quarter that relates
to the group's planned activities.

Kim said there would be courses
focusing on homelessness in Los
Angeles, environmental policy,
AIDS in San Francisco and youth
issues in East Palo Alto.
Each of the 11 groups starts out
with an area to focus on, such as
environmental policy or homeless
ness, but, Kim said, the specifics of
where the work will be done are de
termined later based on the inter
ests of the group.
Kim said organizers were also
looking into different ways to train

the leaders of the groups, hoping to
bring in participation from the Of
fice of Residential Education and
the Center for Teaching and
Learning. Currently the Office of
Student Activities is assisting in
training leaders, he added.
He said a key aspect of the job is
leading the discussion sessions
that the participants have every
night during the project. During
the discussions, Kim said, the stu
dents get a chance to "challenge
each other" and break down

stereotypes.
Kim identified three things he
thought particularly impressed
Break Away. One was the special
fee, which he said reflected the
high level of student respect and
interest for the program.
The other two factors Kim iden
tified as distinguishing Stanford's
program were two of the group
projects. One group worked with
the homeless in Los Angeles and
made a video account of their expe
riences. Another group, in con

junction with Volunteers in Asia,
worked with 20 students from
Tokyo Medical College to put to
gether a seminar on ethics at the
Stanford Medical Center.
For this year's expanded pro
gram, the three new groups will
focus on women's issues, chil
dren's issues and environmental
policy. Applications for the pro
gram are being accepted until the
end of this week and are available
at the Haas Center for Public Ser
vice.
