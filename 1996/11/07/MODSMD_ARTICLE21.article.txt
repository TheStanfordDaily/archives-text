# Carolyn Sleeth: From Russia with love
## Americans and Russians must take pride in own cultures 
### 
THE WOMAN STANDING next to
me on the metro has eight bul
bous, wart-looking things on her
face.
We are all shoved up against each
other, crushed in the morning rush to
get to work. I barely squeezed onto the
car, and the slamming of the doors
directly in my face has a fast, sucking
sound that threatens to catch me in
them.
The woman with the warts asks me if
I am getting out at the next stop, and
when I tell her I am not, she asks me
why I don't move away from the door.
Since it was impossible to move in any
direction, I explain bitterly and in bro
ken Russian that I can't.
She tirades in loud Russian about
how I should try to move anyway.
Other people who aren't getting off
have also been pushed against the doors
and are unable to move anywhere, but
she doesn't spout off at them.
I push my way to the back, angry,
tripping over the multitude of porno

graphically decorated plastic bags that
everyone here carries, confining myself
to a corner.
Did she decide to pick on me because
I look like a foreigner? I have a long
black overcoat that I hide in, and every
morning I wrap my head in a dark hand
kerchief, trying desperately to blend
into the crowd. I own a plastic bag with
a photograph of a blonde in a red
leather miniskirt.
Sometimes, I even look in the mirror
and wish I had a bulbous thing on my
nose.
But even if I try to copy everything I
see Russians doing, I still speak with an
accent and I still walk differently. I am
an American, and even living here for
years wouldn't make me Russian.
Maybe I don't know anything about
Russian culture and metro etiquette,
but I am trying my hardest to fit in. The
reason I wish for a bulbous is because it
is normal — all the women have them,
and I want to be accepted.
Strangely, just as I want to be Rus

sian, Muscovites possess an idealized
image of the West which they try to
copy. Kirill, the 8-year-old boy in my
host family, likes to sit in my room and
watch me type American words on my
computer.
In the evening, he tries out new
words at dinner, saying "please" and
"sit down" in English and then later,
when his parents aren't around, begs
me to teach him the dirtiest American
swear words I know. Skippy peanut but
ter is Kirill's favorite food. He asks for
pieces of Trident gum and likes to listen
to my Tom Petty tapes. He and his
brother watch Home Alone and Juman
ji with Russian dubbed over the
English.
Children aren't the only ones who
seem to adore the West. Almost every
adult carries one of those pornographic
plastic bags with scantily clad women
and English sayings on them. Women
dye their hair and starve themselves to
look like Western models, and McDon
ald's is one of the most popular restau

rants.
Russians ignore the beauty their own
country possesses — it is a vibrant,
extreme mix of techno music, casinos,
larch trees, vodka, icons, black tea,
steppes and peasants, dyed hair and
whitewashed churches.
The woman on the metro seems
angry that she has to be on a sweaty,
crammed metro, be part of this society,
forced to face both its ugly and beautiful
sides. She doesn't want to accept the
Russia she lives in.
On the bus yesterday, the man sit
ting in front of me heard me speaking
English and turned to talk with us. He
said had never seen foreigners before
and had no chance to learn English. He
asked if I was rich in America, what my
life was like and if life in America was
better than life in Russia. He asked
about Bill Clinton and if we thought he
was a good president. His tone revealed
that from what he had heard, America
was second only to heaven.
But if being American is that great,

why am I trying too hard to be a Rus
sian? When I laugh out loud in public or
accidentally smile at a cute guy on the
metro, I am embarrassed by my brash
foreignness. But if I stick out because I
am different, it is because I am natural
ly an American and shouldn't try to be
anyone else. Can I celebrate my own
nationality when I am in Russia, inse
cure and estranged from the country I
belong in?
Russians, although their ways are
different from the Europeans who sur
round them, must be proud of them
selves and respect their history. Despite
its mix of Eastern and Western quali
ties, Russian should accept themselves.
And if I am not Russian, I need to accept
that too.
