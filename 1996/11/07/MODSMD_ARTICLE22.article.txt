### Blake Thompson 
After dominating a number of
California schools two weekends
ago, the men's and women's var
sity crew teams will face stiffer
challenges this weekend.
This weekend's regatta, the
Head of the Lake in Seattle, will
give the Cardinal a chance to
face the top Pacific 10 Confer-

ence schools in both the men's
and women's competitions. Both
teams are hoping to build on this
weekend and gain confidence
heading into the more important
spring season.
The men's team is led by a
core of four experienced upper
classmen who returned last year
from a team that lost nine
seniors to graduation. Senior
captains Matt Miller and Mark
Thomas are joined by juniors
Matt Jolley and Jamie Mac-
Quarrie to form what coach
Wieslaw Kujda calls "the stan

dard for other guys to measure
up to."
These four already led the
squad to an easy victory in
Sacramento at Lake Natomas
last month, where the team cap
tured the varsity, junior varsity
and varsity four-man champi
onships, defeating mostly Cali
fornia schools. This was a solid
first step for the team, although
they did not face California, who
looks to be, as usual, a huge
rival.
Kujda characterized Stan
ford's team this year as a good
combination of experience and
youth, and he emphasized the
importance of the leadership
which the top four men have
been providing.
This weekend's regatta
should definitely be more of a
challenge for the rowers, as they
will face all of their biggest Pac
-10 rivals. Defending conference
champion Washington, as well
as last year's third-place finisher
Oregon State, will be there to
push the men harder than in
their first regatta.
The men's team has devel
oped quite a rivalry with Oregon
State. Senior co-captain Thomas
admits he is especially looking
forward to meeting the Beavers
this weekend. The regatta will
also include Washington State
and a strong non-conference foe,
the University of Victoria, as
well as a host of other schools
from the Northwest.
Kujda predicts the Card will
crack the top five in Seattle,
although co-captain Miller said
the squad was "just pretty excit
ed to race and not sure what to
expect."
The real goals of the year are
directed toward the spring sea
son, when the race shifts to a
shorter distance of 2,000 meters,
and the intensity picks up dra
matically. The Pac-10 Champi
onships in the spring are always
the No. 1 goal for the team, so in
the fall, the team is only begin
ning to put in the training which
could propel them to the top in
