## Crew faces big foes in Seattle 
### Blake Thompson 
After dominating a number of
California schools two weekends
ago, the men's and women's var
sity crew teams will face stiffer
challenges this weekend.
This weekend's regatta, the
Head of the Lake in Seattle, will
give the Cardinal a chance to
face the top Pacific 10 Confer-

Race participants

ence schools in both the men's
and women's competitions. Both
teams are hoping to build on this
weekend and gain confidence
heading into the more important
spring season.
The men's team is led by a
core of four experienced upper
classmen who returned last year
from a team that lost nine
seniors to graduation. Senior
captains Matt Miller and Mark
Thomas are joined by juniors
Matt Jolley and Jamie Mac-
Quarrie to form what coach
Wieslaw Kujda calls "the stan

dard for other guys to measure
up to."
These four already led the
squad to an easy victory in
Sacramento at Lake Natomas
last month, where the team cap
tured the varsity, junior varsity
and varsity four-man champi
onships, defeating mostly Cali
fornia schools. This was a solid
first step for the team, although
they did not face California, who
looks to be, as usual, a huge
rival.
Kujda characterized Stan
ford's team this year as a good
combination of experience and
youth, and he emphasized the
importance of the leadership
which the top four men have
been providing.
This weekend's regatta
should definitely be more of a
challenge for the rowers, as they
will face all of their biggest Pac
-10 rivals. Defending conference
champion Washington, as well
as last year's third-place finisher
Oregon State, will be there to
push the men harder than in
their first regatta.
The men's team has devel
oped quite a rivalry with Oregon
State. Senior co-captain Thomas
admits he is especially looking
forward to meeting the Beavers
this weekend. The regatta will
also include Washington State
and a strong non-conference foe,
the University of Victoria, as
well as a host of other schools
from the Northwest.
Kujda predicts the Card will
crack the top five in Seattle,
although co-captain Miller said
the squad was "just pretty excit
ed to race and not sure what to
expect."
The real goals of the year are
directed toward the spring sea
son, when the race shifts to a
shorter distance of 2,000 meters,
and the intensity picks up dra
matically. The Pac-10 Champi
onships in the spring are always
the No. 1 goal for the team, so in
the fall, the team is only begin
ning to put in the training which
could propel them to the top in
these races.
The Card finished only 4 sec
onds away from the top boat in last
spring's Pac-10 competition, and
Kiyda acknowledges that the team
"must focus now on the technical
improvements" so that once spring
comes, the squad will be prepared
for the stiff competition.
The men's team should also be
bolstered by the return of a num
ber of rowers not currently practic
ing with the team because of
injuries, eligibility problems and
athletes spending quarters abroad.
The men will send an eight-man
boat of upperclassmen to Seattle.
The team also has three full eights
of freshmen currently in training
who will not travel this weekend,
bt t Stanford is still looking for new
members.
The team will not face Cal this
weekend, either, but will get its
first glimpse of the Bears Nov. 24
at the San Mateo Regatta, where
the Cardinal will get its first
chance to find out how they stack
up with the 1996 conference run
ners-up.
The team races a number of dif
ferent arrangements of four-man
and eight-man boats in the fall, but
in the spring the primary commit
ment is to the eights, since "most
of the competition in collegiate
rowing is there," Thomas said.
The women's team has taken a
similar course this year â€” not fac
ing much stiff competition so far,
but looking forward to this week
end Two weekends ago, the team
raced a junioi varsity boat in the
open division and rowed well,
according t< coach Aimee Baker.
The team rowed only 20 seconds
behind the top boat despite rowing
against tht irsity boats of the
other school>.
The next day at the Lake of the

Estuary in Oakland, the women,
entering a varsity eight, defeated
Cal in a tight race for the title. The
Bears stayed within 5 or 10 sec
onds of the Cardinal throughout
the race, and the Card finished
only 5 seconds in front, which was
"not much for a 23-minute race,"
according to Baker.
"I would have preferred for us
to be a lot faster than Cal, but it
was good to be tested the whole
way," Baker said.
Baker and the rowers are excit
ed about what is to come this year.
Unlike the men, the women gradu
ated only two seniors from last
year's varsity team, and a number
of seniors return to lead the team
this year. Co-captains Bess
Kennedy and Nancy Bergsteins
son, coxswain, have headed the
charge for the Cardinal thus far.
They have been helped by a num
ber of other returning varsity row
ers, as well as the return of 10 row
ers from last year's novice team,
increasing the depth of the team
significantly.
This weekend's regatta will be a
strong test for the women, as they,
too, go up against defending con
ference champion Washington,
runner-up Washington State and a
strong team from Victoria, which
has dominated races in the North
west so far this fall.
All these teams should give the
Card "a good idea of what we have
to do for the spring," Kennedy said.
After this weekend in Seattle, the
team will travel to San Mateo to
meet Cal again, which is "really
what we're focusing on," Baker
said. That race will conclude the
fall season and give Stanford an
indication of what the spring might
bring for the women's team.
The women plan to shoot for a
top-two finish at the Pac-lOs,
which would qualify them for the
NCAA Championships.
Baker is looking forward to this
year as "our year and a chance to
do something special."
