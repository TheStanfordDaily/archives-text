# Senior women persevere with crew
## Six rowers who have shaped the team mark the end of an era 
### Vanessa Arrington Editorial staff 
Ambitious freshmen looking to find their niche
adorn the Stanford campus every fall quarter. The
search for some is fruitless, while others fmd their pas
sion and decide to dedicate the rest of their Stanford
career and perhaps beyond to their chosen activity.
Many female freshmen, usually athletes in high
school who were not recruited to Stanford for a sport,
decide to pick up crew during their first quarter here.
Few of them continue past fall quarter, and even fewer
stay with the sport for more than a season.
It is practically unheard of for novice rowers to stick
with the sport for all four of their college years.
This phenomenon is so unique that most rowing
programs have a specific plaque honoring four-year
oarswomen. Stanford women's crew's plaque, referred
to as "the legacy" by coach Aimee Baker, generally
sports just a few names each year. But this year is dif
ferent.
At season's end in 1997, Stanford women's crew will
say goodbye to the first set of six seniors in Stanford
history who have participated in crew for four years.
The graduation of co-captain Bess Kennedy, Jen
Brown, Janet Bucher, Ann Dubinsky, Maria Klemper
er-Johnson and Erin Sweeney will signify the end of an
era
"The six of them will leave a big space to fill next
year," Baker said. "They're definitely a strong spirit on
the team. We owe a lot of success to this group that has
sustained this level of commitment. They have set the
mark for the future."
That's not to mention the sacrifices and endurance
required of rowers. All Stanford athletics demand
immeasurable levels of commitment, but crew seems to
require a special breed — one that doesn't mind waking
up at 5:45 a.m. to go rowing, one that can handle the
sheer physicality of the sport.
"You also need mental toughness," Brown said.
"Ninety-nine percent of crew is mental, because [near
the end of the race] you have nothing left physically,"
Brown said.
What else does crew require?
"It takes a lot of teamwork. You have to have confi
dence that everyone is rowing as hard as you are,"
Dubinsky said.
"You have to be willing to lift heavy weights,"
Kennedy said. "Some people don't want to bulk up;l
that's a hard thing for a women's team to do."
"You have to stay focused, be on top of things,"
Klemperer-Johnson said. "Whatever you do that early
in the morning is going to affect your whole day. It is
physically painful to get up at 5:45 a.m., but it is nice to
be back at 8:30 a.m. and feel refreshed, ready for your
day."
"She's my alarm clock when she comes homeat/&:30
a.m.," said senior Erin Graves, who has lived with
Klemperer-Johnson since their sophomore year. "It
amazes me that she has two practices a day. But she
loves it."
Despite its rigorous demands, rowing crew does have
its benefits.
"There is an amazing feeling of togetherness (in a

boat) with eight people in exact
unison," Kennedy said.
"The best thing is the sunrise on
the water," Brown said.
"Watching the sunrise when
you already have a sweat," Dubin
sky added.
And these women certainly
sweat. They work out every day at
least once, whether it be rowing on
the water, erging, lifting weights or
running stadiums.
"We spend five hours a day in
practice and two hours in class,"
Brown said. "Classes have not been
our first priority. But what I'll
remember is my experiences with
these guys."
"My mom tells me I'm major
ing in crew and minoring in com
puter science," Klemperer-John
son said.
All six were athletic in high
school, with activities ranging from
track to soccer to skiing to horse
back riding. Yet, nothing they did
quite compared to crew.
"1 didn't know how far I could
push myself until I did crew,"

Kennedy said. "You find new limits
every week."
Brown was on the Stanford
track team for a few weeks her
freshman year but then switched
to crew when she realized she was
more willing to commit to a team
than push herself individually.
"What I found though was that
being on the team made me push
myself even farther," Brown said.
"Crew is 100 percent commitment.
"It's a lot of sacrifice. There are
few sports that require you to give
up your weekends. You go to sleep
early, when everyone else is just
starting to hang out. Thursday
night parties? Not since freshman
year."
"Senior pub nights?" Dubinsky
said. " I have yet to make it to one of
those."
These sacrifices and immense
time commitment are what gener
ally turn off novice rowers. And
once they stop ...
"Once you take a year off,
there's generally no coming back.
You see the other side," Brown said.
"The fact that they've stuck
with crew for all four years is a tes
tament to their mental character,"
said Brooke Lyons, who competed
for the crew team her freshman

year. "I don't think people realize
how intense crew is — not only the
time but the mental concentration
it requires. It's also not very sup
ported by the Athletic Department
or the student body."
"As much as crew sounds
hellish, we're a fun group," Brown
said.
The women have definitely
bonded. Beginning with their
freshman year, they were the
trendsetters, often influencing
other novice teams to wear ban
danas and rose tattoos in competi
tion or play music during warmups
at regattas. They all rowed topless
together at last year's Class Day at
Stanford. And they've all picked up
crocheting as a hobby.
"It's such a paradox," Kennedy
said. "Here you have these strong
women always with their crochet
ing needles in hand."
"We take care of each other,"
Brown said. "Crew is a challenge.
There's always someone feeling
really good about crew, and then
someone with five midterms and
personal problems. If there's any
problem, you can turn to your
teammates as more than team
mates, and they will understand
what you're going through."

"If you're willing to commit to
the team, they'll give you any
thing," Sweeney said. "You'll get
that commitment back on and off
the water.
"It's a lot about perseverance,"
she said. "We can't be static, we
have to endeavor to do better than
our best."
"You need to keep proving your
self," Dubinsky said. "I feel like I'm
always pushing to keep up."
The efforts of these six women,
as well as their teammates over the
years, have paid off. They have
seen the team evolve from being
perceived as the underdog to
becoming the team to beat.
"We've become a more athletic
team — we are stronger, faster on
the water," Sweeney said.
"The team has become more
competitive — there's a new type of
Stanford crew," Brown said. Not
only are the women aiming to send
both their varsity and junior varsi
ty boats to nationals, some of them
are even toying with the idea of
attending selection camp for the
women's national crew team.
"Crew is a mature sport — you
start it when you're in your 205,"
Klemperer-Johnson said. "This is
just the beginning."

It is practically unheard of for novice rowers to stick
with the sport for all four of their college years.
This phenomenon is so unique that most rowing
programs have a specific plaque honoring four-year
oarswomen. Stanford women's crew's plaque, referred
to as "the legacy" by coach Aimee Baker, generally
sports just a few names each year. But this year is dif
ferent.
At season's end in 1997, Stanford women's crew will
say goodbye to the first set of six seniors in Stanford
history who have participated in crew for four years.
The graduation of co-captain Bess Kennedy, Jen
Brown, Janet Bucher, Ann Dubinsky, Maria Klemper
er-Johnson and Erin Sweeney will signify the end of an
era
"The six of them will leave a big space to fill next
year," Baker said. "They're definitely a strong spirit on
the team. We owe a lot of success to this group that has
sustained this level of commitment. They have set the
mark for the future."
That's not to mention the sacrifices and endurance
required of rowers. All Stanford athletics demand
immeasurable levels of commitment, but crew seems to
require a special breed — one that doesn't mind waking
up at 5:45 a.m. to go rowing, one that can handle the
sheer physicality of the sport.
"You also need mental toughness," Brown said.
"Ninety-nine percent of crew is mental, because [near
the end of the race] you have nothing left physically,"
Brown said.
What else does crew require?
"It takes a lot of teamwork. You have to have confi
dence that everyone is rowing as hard as you are,"
Dubinsky said.
"You have to be willing to lift heavy weights,"
Kennedy said. "Some people don't want to bulk up;l
that's a hard thing for a women's team to do."
"You have to stay focused, be on top of things,"
Klemperer-Johnson said. "Whatever you do that early
in the morning is going to affect your whole day. It is
physically painful to get up at 5:45 a.m., but it is nice to
be back at 8:30 a.m. and feel refreshed, ready for your
day."
"She's my alarm clock when she comes homeat/&:30
a.m.," said senior Erin Graves, who has lived with
Klemperer-Johnson since their sophomore year. "It
amazes me that she has two practices a day. But she
loves it."
Despite its rigorous demands, rowing crew does have
its benefits.
"There is an amazing feeling of togetherness (in a

boat) with eight people in exact
unison," Kennedy said.
"The best thing is the sunrise on
the water," Brown said.
"Watching the sunrise when
you already have a sweat," Dubin
sky added.
And these women certainly
sweat. They work out every day at
least once, whether it be rowing on
the water, erging, lifting weights or
running stadiums.
"We spend five hours a day in
practice and two hours in class,"
Brown said. "Classes have not been
our first priority. But what I'll
remember is my experiences with
these guys."
"My mom tells me I'm major
ing in crew and minoring in com
puter science," Klemperer-John
son said.
All six were athletic in high
school, with activities ranging from
track to soccer to skiing to horse
back riding. Yet, nothing they did
quite compared to crew.
"1 didn't know how far I could
push myself until I did crew,"

Kennedy said. "You find new limits
every week."
Brown was on the Stanford
track team for a few weeks her
freshman year but then switched
to crew when she realized she was
more willing to commit to a team
than push herself individually.
"What I found though was that
being on the team made me push
myself even farther," Brown said.
"Crew is 100 percent commitment.
"It's a lot of sacrifice. There are
few sports that require you to give
up your weekends. You go to sleep
early, when everyone else is just
starting to hang out. Thursday
night parties? Not since freshman
year."
"Senior pub nights?" Dubinsky
said. " I have yet to make it to one of
those."
These sacrifices and immense
time commitment are what gener
ally turn off novice rowers. And
once they stop ...
"Once you take a year off,
there's generally no coming back.
You see the other side," Brown said.
"The fact that they've stuck
with crew for all four years is a tes
tament to their mental character,"
said Brooke Lyons, who competed
for the crew team her freshman

year. "I don't think people realize
how intense crew is — not only the
time but the mental concentration
it requires. It's also not very sup
ported by the Athletic Department
or the student body."
"As much as crew sounds
hellish, we're a fun group," Brown
said.
The women have definitely
bonded. Beginning with their
freshman year, they were the
trendsetters, often influencing
other novice teams to wear ban
danas and rose tattoos in competi
tion or play music during warmups
at regattas. They all rowed topless
together at last year's Class Day at
Stanford. And they've all picked up
crocheting as a hobby.
"It's such a paradox," Kennedy
said. "Here you have these strong
women always with their crochet
ing needles in hand."
"We take care of each other,"
Brown said. "Crew is a challenge.
There's always someone feeling
really good about crew, and then
someone with five midterms and
personal problems. If there's any
problem, you can turn to your
teammates as more than team
mates, and they will understand
what you're going through."

"If you're willing to commit to
the team, they'll give you any
thing," Sweeney said. "You'll get
that commitment back on and off
the water.
"It's a lot about perseverance,"
she said. "We can't be static, we
have to endeavor to do better than
our best."
"You need to keep proving your
self," Dubinsky said. "I feel like I'm
always pushing to keep up."
The efforts of these six women,
as well as their teammates over the
years, have paid off. They have
seen the team evolve from being
perceived as the underdog to
becoming the team to beat.
"We've become a more athletic
team — we are stronger, faster on
the water," Sweeney said.
"The team has become more
competitive — there's a new type of
Stanford crew," Brown said. Not
only are the women aiming to send
both their varsity and junior varsi
ty boats to nationals, some of them
are even toying with the idea of
attending selection camp for the
women's national crew team.
"Crew is a mature sport — you
start it when you're in your 205,"
Klemperer-Johnson said. "This is
just the beginning."
Ambitious freshmen looking to find their niche
adorn the Stanford campus every fall quarter. The
search for some is fruitless, while others fmd their pas
sion and decide to dedicate the rest of their Stanford
career and perhaps beyond to their chosen activity.
Many female freshmen, usually athletes in high
school who were not recruited to Stanford for a sport,
decide to pick up crew during their first quarter here.
Few of them continue past fall quarter, and even fewer
stay with the sport for more than a season.
