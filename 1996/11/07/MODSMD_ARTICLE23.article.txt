# Senior women persevere with crew
## Six rowers who have shaped the team mark the end of an era 
### Vanessa Arrington Editorial staff 
Ambitious freshmen looking to find their niche
adorn the Stanford campus every fall quarter. The
search for some is fruitless, while others fmd their pas
sion and decide to dedicate the rest of their Stanford
career and perhaps beyond to their chosen activity.
Many female freshmen, usually athletes in high
school who were not recruited to Stanford for a sport,
decide to pick up crew during their first quarter here.
Few of them continue past fall quarter, and even fewer
stay with the sport for more than a season.
It is practically unheard of for novice rowers to stick
with the sport for all four of their college years.
This phenomenon is so unique that most rowing
programs have a specific plaque honoring four-year
oarswomen. Stanford women's crew's plaque, referred
to as "the legacy" by coach Aimee Baker, generally
sports just a few names each year. But this year is dif
ferent.
At season's end in 1997, Stanford women's crew will
say goodbye to the first set of six seniors in Stanford
history who have participated in crew for four years.
The graduation of co-captain Bess Kennedy, Jen
Brown, Janet Bucher, Ann Dubinsky, Maria Klemper
er-Johnson and Erin Sweeney will signify the end of an
era
"The six of them will leave a big space to fill next
year," Baker said. "They're definitely a strong spirit on
the team. We owe a lot of success to this group that has
sustained this level of commitment. They have set the
mark for the future."
That's not to mention the sacrifices and endurance
required of rowers. All Stanford athletics demand
immeasurable levels of commitment, but crew seems to
require a special breed — one that doesn't mind waking
up at 5:45 a.m. to go rowing, one that can handle the
sheer physicality of the sport.
"You also need mental toughness," Brown said.
"Ninety-nine percent of crew is mental, because [near
the end of the race] you have nothing left physically,"
Brown said.
What else does crew require?
"It takes a lot of teamwork. You have to have confi
dence that everyone is rowing as hard as you are,"
Dubinsky said.
"You have to be willing to lift heavy weights,"
Kennedy said. "Some people don't want to bulk up;l
that's a hard thing for a women's team to do."
"You have to stay focused, be on top of things,"
Klemperer-Johnson said. "Whatever you do that early
in the morning is going to affect your whole day. It is
physically painful to get up at 5:45 a.m., but it is nice to
be back at 8:30 a.m. and feel refreshed, ready for your
day."
"She's my alarm clock when she comes homeat/&:30
a.m.," said senior Erin Graves, who has lived with
Klemperer-Johnson since their sophomore year. "It
amazes me that she has two practices a day. But she
loves it."
Despite its rigorous demands, rowing crew does have
its benefits.
"There is an amazing feeling of togetherness (in a
