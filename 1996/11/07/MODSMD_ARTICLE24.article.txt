# Soccer's challenge continues
## Men head to St. Mary's with confidence 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
The men's soccer team has waited a long time
to play in a late-season game of significance.
Today, Stanford does just that as it takes on the
St. Mary's Gaels at 2:30 p.m. in Moraga in a game
that may decide the postseason fate of the Cardi
nal.
With an impressive turnaround from a slow
start this season, the Cardinal has improved its
record to 8-4-4 (3-2-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation ) and put itself in a position to make a
strong bid for a berth into the NCAA tournament.
The Cardinal has won its last three games,
defeating UC-Irvine 2-1, UC-Santa Barbara 3-1
and San Jose State 2-0. Although the Gaels have
lost their last two games, they have proven they
can play competitively against top-notch ball
clubs, as their narrow 2-1 loss to fourth-ranked
Washington indicates.
"St. Mary's has been a thorn in our side since
I've been here," said senior striker Erik Morrison.
"When we matched up against them in years past,
we usually felt that they were finally a team that
we could beat, but we frequently were unable to
beat them. While we obviously feel that we can
beat them this year, we know that we must beat
them."
The Gaels (6-9-1, 1-3-0 West Coast Conference)
have gotten the best of Stanford in their last two
matchups, defeating the Cardinal 3-1 both times.
However, Stanford has a 12-5-1 edge in the series
history. The Cardinal looks to build on the confi
dence of its three-game winning streak, as well as
the excitement of its post-season possibilities.
"The biggest difference in the team at thu?
stage in the season is our confidence level," Mor
rison said. "We've had our ups and downs, but we
all feel that we have improved. We all know how

important these games are."
The Gaels are known to con
cede nothing to their opponents,
especially on their home field,
where they have only lost two
games this year. Stanford coach
Bobby Clark said St. Mary's is

"technically quite good and a bit
scrappy." That will clearly work to
St. Mary's advantage on their
home field, which is 5 yards nar
rower than Stanford's Maloney
Field.
Gael players to watch for
include sophomore striker Devin
Ebright, who leads the team with
seven goals aned 19 points and
senior striker JefT Canarelli, who
is second on the team with four

goals and 10 points. Also of note is
junior goalkeeper Chris Beatty,
who posts a respectable 1.65 goals -
against average.
The Gaels use two markers
and a sweeper on the defensive
end, five midfielders and two
strikers offensively, which will
cause the Cardinal to make some
minor adjustments. Along with
the narrower field, the Gaels'
strategy will probably create a

tight game with plenty of con
tact.
Stanford will stick to its usual
game plan of smart defense and
quick counterattacks to try to
wear down the Gaels. The shorter
field will force the Cardinal to play
precise and mistake-free soccer,
though it may prove to the team's
benefit if the Gaels cannot handle
the pressure defense of the Cardi
nal.

If Stanford can win its remain
ing two games and finish out the
season with a 10-4-4 record, Stan
ford will put itself in a good posi
tion to receive a bid in the NCAA
tournament.
The soccer tournament begins
with 32 teams which are chosen
on the basis of record, difficulty of
schedule and performance against
top-ranked teams. Working in
favor of the Cardinal are its dra

matic late-season improvement
and impressive showings against
top-10 teams such as California
and Washington.
"There's no magic to win
ning," Morrison said. "This
matchup has a big-time game
atmosphere. This is what we play
for, this is what it's all about
We're in it to the end, but we hope
we can postpone the end as much
as possible."
