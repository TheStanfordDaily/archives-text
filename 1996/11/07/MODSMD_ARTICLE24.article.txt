# Soccer's challenge continues
## Men head to St. Mary's with confidence 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
The men's soccer team has waited a long time
to play in a late-season game of significance.
Today, Stanford does just that as it takes on the
St. Mary's Gaels at 2:30 p.m. in Moraga in a game
that may decide the postseason fate of the Cardi
nal.
With an impressive turnaround from a slow
start this season, the Cardinal has improved its
record to 8-4-4 (3-2-1 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation ) and put itself in a position to make a
strong bid for a berth into the NCAA tournament.
The Cardinal has won its last three games,
defeating UC-Irvine 2-1, UC-Santa Barbara 3-1
and San Jose State 2-0. Although the Gaels have
lost their last two games, they have proven they
can play competitively against top-notch ball
clubs, as their narrow 2-1 loss to fourth-ranked
Washington indicates.
"St. Mary's has been a thorn in our side since
I've been here," said senior striker Erik Morrison.
"When we matched up against them in years past,
we usually felt that they were finally a team that
we could beat, but we frequently were unable to
beat them. While we obviously feel that we can
beat them this year, we know that we must beat
them."
The Gaels (6-9-1, 1-3-0 West Coast Conference)
have gotten the best of Stanford in their last two
matchups, defeating the Cardinal 3-1 both times.
However, Stanford has a 12-5-1 edge in the series
history. The Cardinal looks to build on the confi
dence of its three-game winning streak, as well as
the excitement of its post-season possibilities.
"The biggest difference in the team at thu?
stage in the season is our confidence level," Mor
rison said. "We've had our ups and downs, but we
all feel that we have improved. We all know how
