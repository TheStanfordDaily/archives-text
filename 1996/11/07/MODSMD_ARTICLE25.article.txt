# Women's soccer greets Sac State
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
This afternoon may be the
last time for Stanford fans to see
this year's Cardinal seniors play
on Malonev Field.
Seven seniors will play in
their final regular season home
field game against Sacramento
State at 2:30 p.m. It is possible
that Stanford will return to Mal
onev Field at some point during
the NCAA tournament, but not
certain.
"The seniors have had some
great years at Stanford," said
coach Steve Swanson.
Erin Martin, Kim Houkom,
Suzie Boots, Mandv Tucker,
Alvze Lowen. Emily Burt and
Wendy Latimer have combined
to play in 373 games in which
they have scored 71 goals and
tallied 54 assists for a total of
196 points.
The Cardinal (11-7,6-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) has rattled off
four consecutive wins, and is
hoping to put together a similar
effort against the Hornets.
While today's game is not a must
win — Stanford clinched the
Pac-10 championship and a
berth into the NCAA tourna

ment with a 2-1 overtime win
over UCLA on Sunday — Swan
son insists that it is vital for his
team to maintain the momen
tum it has picked up over the
past two weeks.
"We have to continue to hone
what we've been doing," Swan
son said. "This an important
game for us, especially coming
ofT last weekend (when the Car
dinal beat USC and UCLA in
Los Angeles). It's really impor
tant for us to keep the momen
tum going into the last games of
the season."
Stanford, which holds a 4-0
edge all-time over Sacramento
State, will be a heavy favorite
against its neighbors to the
north. A year ago, the Cardinal
convincingly beat the Hornets 8-
0. Swanson said he expects a
much tighter game this after
noon, however.
"I know that Sacramento
State is a much improved team
from a year ago," he said. "This
is not a game we should take
lightly."
This year's graduating class
wants to make sure that it walks
off Maloney Field, potentially for
the last time, as winners, so expect
an intense and emotional effort
from the streaking squad.
There will be a short ceremony
before the game to honor this
year's graduating class.
It has been an interesting ride
for the seniors over the years.
Swanson is Stanford's third
coach since early 1993, and a few
seniors took last year off from

soccer.
"It's been hard for them to get
adjusted with so much change
going on," Swanson said. "But
they've all stuck together well and
really have been an inspiration to
the whole team."
"They suffered through some
adversity earlier in the season
(when the Cardinal hit a three
game losing streak) and have really
helped push the team forward.
They are my first class, and I want
them to enjoy the rest of this sea
son as much as possible."
