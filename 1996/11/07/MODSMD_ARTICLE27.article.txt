# Golfers move step by step
## Men to host Nelson Invitational this weekend 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
Men's golf coach Wally Good
win's goal for his team never
changes, and it has not since he
became head golf coach at Stanford
10 years ago.
"We play every day to prepare
for tomorrow," Goodwin said. "My
goal for my team and players is
always the same — that every play
er plays every hole and makes
every shot as well as he can and
that we are always improving for
the next time."
Goodwin's approach appears to
be working. With his team improv
ing its finish at every tournament,
the golf squad enters the Nelson
Invitational Tournament this
weekend with confidence and
momentum.
The 54-hole tournament will be
held tomorrow, Saturday and Sun
day at the Stanford Golf Course,
with 18-hole rounds played on each
day of competition. Stanford's line
up will consist of senior Conrad
Ray, freshman Dusty Brett, fresh
man Andy Hastings, junior Jake
Foe and sophomore Scott Wang.

One of the most notable
absences at this tournament will
be sophomore phenom Joel Kribel
who, like Tiger Woods before him,
will represent the United States
this week in the World Amateur
Golf Tournament in Manila,
Philippines. Kribel will join the
team of the four men and four
women selected as outstanding
U.S. amateur golfers. Although
Kribel's team leadership will be
missed, Goodwin pointed out that
having Kribel gone for a tourna
ment will help give the team a dif
ferent look at itself as a whole.
"We're going to lose [Kribel's]
good play and leadership, but this
will also be a chance for us to see
some of the other guys play,"
Goodwin said. "We're getting bet
ter, so we'll just see what happens.
After this tournament, we'll know
where we rank and what we have
to do."
"It's time for us to prove our
selves, and we're not afraid to do
it," Brett said. The Nelson is the
last tournament of the fall season,
and Stanford's performance will
partially establish the Cardinal's
standing for the upcoming months

before the next tournament in
February.
"It's always easier playing at
home with the home court advan
tage, so it's expected that we'll play
better this weekend," Wang said.
However, the course will not be
easy. With faster greens and the
rough nearly twice as long as
usual, the Stanford Golf Course
this weekend will be a "true test of
good golf," Goodwin said. With
these obstacles, the already chal
lenging course will definitely favor
controlled play and straight fair
way shots.
"It's an excellent tournament to
end on," Brett said. "Playing on
our home course, we can go out of
the fall season with a confident
feeling. We've been working hard;
we know the course well by now,
but we need all the fan support we
can get."
The tournament will begin at 8
a.m. tomorrow, Saturday and Sun
day, and competition will last all
day.
"If you want to see what [a golf
tournament] is like, come out and
see us," Wang said. "This will be
one of your few chances."
