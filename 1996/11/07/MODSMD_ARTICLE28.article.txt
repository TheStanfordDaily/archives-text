## Ice hockey confronts USC with renewed pride 
### Ben Freda 
This is the season that wasn't supposed to happen.
Alter losing the most experienced players of last year's
crop to graduation, this year's Stanford ice hockey
team (3-2-2,3-0-2 Pacific 8 Conference) was supposed
to spend a year rebuilding and finding itself. Instead,
the new players have ignited the team to an undefeat
ed league record and national championship hopes.
The Cardinal will test its newfound prowess when
it faces USC tomorrow and Saturday.
"We've already beaten them once," said freshman
Philip Enan. "It won't be tough to do it again."
USC's strong front line and experience make the
Trojans a challenge. "If we can stop the line, we can
beat them," said team president and goal tender Sami
Jo Small, a junior. Stanford's only other matchup
with the Trojans was in Los Angeles, where the Car
dinal was able to put the game away in overtime, 5-4.
The Cardinal's other league victories this season
came against Utah State and California. The only
time the Cardinal has been dealt a loss this season was
in Tucson, Ariz., where the Division I Arizona Wild
cats dumped them twice, 15-0 and 8-1.

Not to be alarmed, said team captain Tom Terbell,
because the Wildcats are in a tougher division, and
losses to Division I teams won't affect Stanford's
chance of winning the national Division II title.
The surprisingly strong play of the team has mem
bers already pining for a national championship.
"To go to nationals, we have to be in the top four of
our region," Small said. "We've already beaten Utah
State, which was going to be a strong competitor, and
we're 1-0-1 against Cal, another competitor. So we're
in a good position."
Last season's brilliant Pac-8 championship team
sported it all: power, skill and experience. But with
experience comes age, and with age comes graduation.
"At the end of last year, we lost 10 veterans," Small
said. "We didn't know what we would get this year to
replace them. We thought this would be a rebuilding
year."
Instead, the team finds itself in strong competition
for March's national championships in St. Louis.
"We lost a very strong forward and a very strong
defender," Terbell said. "But we've had enough guys
to fill in for the line and the defense. We were lucky to
get such a strong crop of new players."
