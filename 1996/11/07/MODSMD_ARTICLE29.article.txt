Seven members of the Stanford women's ten
nis team, including three freshmen, will start play
today in the four-day Women's Northwest
Regional Rolex Intercollegiate Championship at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The tournament, which the Cardinal won in
both singles and doubles rounds last year, fea
tures the best college players from West Coast
teams as they compete for entrance to the Nation
al Rolex Indoor Championships, which will be
held in Dallas in February.
The outlook for the Card looks bright as junior
Ania Bleszynski, seniors Katie Schlukebir and
Sandra De Silva and freshman Lilia Osterloh
occupy the top four seeds in the tournament in
that order. Two more freshmen — seventh-seeded
Teryn Ashley and unseeded Jen Heiser — along
with unseeded junior Heidi Stalla bring the total
number of Stanford players to seven out of a huge
draw of 96 in the singles bracket.
In the first round, Heiser will face unseeded
Jamie Martin from Oregon. The rest of the Cardi
nal players will start in the second round later in
the day.
The Cardinal will play four doubles teams.
Top-seeded Schlukebir and Osterloh, third-seeded
Bleszynski and junior Julie Scott, and fifth-seeded
Ashley and freshman Anne Kremer will not play
in the first round. Unseeded Heiser and Stalla
also won a bye into the second round.
Scott, who won the doubles finals last year
with then-senior Kim Shasby, has never played
with Bleszynski at Stanford. However, they
played together before college in junior tourna
ments, making the quarterfinals of the Junior
U.S. Open and winning the bronze medal at the
Olympic Festival in San Antonio.
"We'll be trying to woi k together, and I think
we have a good chance to qualify," Scott said.
Scott was also optimistic for the rest of the
team as well. "We have the most talent since I've
been at Stanford," she said. "Everyone is compet
itive and focused, and I can already see that it's
going to be a great year just looking at how well
the freshmen are doing."
Scott has already qualified for the nationals
with her final-round win in the consolation round
at the Ail-American Championships last month
and will not play in the singles portion of the tour
nament. Kremer will also not play in singles
because she will be playing in the Australian Open
in February and will be unable to attend the
