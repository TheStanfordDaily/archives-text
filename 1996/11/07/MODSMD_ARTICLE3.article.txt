There are people who are good at
conflict resolution, and there are
people whose official job is to re
solve conflicts.
For a stretch of 15 months,
many faculty, staff and students at
the School of Medicine brought
their problems to their ombudsper
son, Ellen Waxman, whose task
was to handle their complaints and
help people toward conflict resolu
tion.
"The ombuds is a confidential
resource on campus," said Wax
man. "Sometimes people find the
ombuds helpful because the om
buds is impartial, so they know the
role of the ombuds is to look out for
issues of fairness, not to take any
one's side."
Waxman, who was the Medical
School ombudsperson from March
1995 to June 1996, now serves as
the ombudsperson and mediation
coordinator for the entire Universi
ty, replacing Leah Kaplan, who re
tired.
"Since I've come to the main
campus, people have raised more is
sues that relat â€¢ to what I would call
'bureaucrat 1 c-type concerns,' "
Waxman said, adding that many
people have come to her because
they had gotten caught up in red
tape. Waxman said such issues
rarely came up when she was at the
Medical School.

The Medical School has had an
ombudsperson for 10 years, and
Waxman was the first woman to
take the position, starting her job
after the school had been without
anyone in the position for four
years. Apart from the Medical
School, the main campus has had
an Ombudsperson's Office for the
last 26 years.
"I very much enjoyed being the
ombudsperson at the Medical
School, and I really am eryoying
and looking forward to working
with even more people on the main
campus," she said.
What makes the ombudsperson
different from other advising
sources on campus is that he or she
is completely impartial, confiden
tial and independent of regular
school and administrative struc
tures, according to a brochure pro
vided by the Ombudsperson's Of
fice.
"The hope is that by having an
ombuds, you intervene in disputes
earlier, before things blow up, so
that they can be resolved by people
agreeing, rather than through
grievances," Waxman said.
She added that the essential
function of the ombudsperson is
the same in the main campus as in
the Medical School.
"The [only] difference is that
the job on the main campus is
much broader," she said. "A much
wider variety of subject matters
