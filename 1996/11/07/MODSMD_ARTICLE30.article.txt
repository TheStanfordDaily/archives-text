Consequential matches that may declare
the Stanford field hockey team Northern
Pacific Athletic Conference champions of the
1996 season await the Cardinal (14-3, 6-1
NorPac) this weekend. Two games against
California and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo in
the Western Collegiate Tournament at Pacif
ic and a match against UC-Davis will wrap up

the season for the Cardinal.
The Stanford team will travel to Davis for
its match against the Aggies tomorrow, and
Cal Poly will challenge the Card Saturday at
UOP. The Sunday match against the Bears
marks the end of the regular season.
"I'm glad we are finishing (the season)
with the Cal game," said coach Sheryl John
son. "We've been focusing on it."
Stanford has lost only one game to a West
Coast team this year. In an overtime contest

at the beginning of the season, the squad
suffered a nail-biting 1-0 loss to the Bearb
However, three weeks later, the Card defeat
ed Cal 2-1 in a home game. Now, the two
leaders of the NorPac must meet again to
break the seasonal tie and decide which team
will come out on top to take the conference
title.
The match will be on grass, where junior
goalkeeper Kelly Naylor said Stanford's
skills "are best executed."
"Cal is not an easy game," Naylor said
The match against Cal "will be a game of
mind. We've definitely come a long way since
the beginning of the season. The game will be
about who is more mentally prepared."
Senior tri-captain Baochi Nguyen said the
squad has started conditioning early in
preparation for the Bears game and is in top
condition to play this weekend. Although the
season is drawing to a close for the Cardinal,
team members are still gaining momentum
and continue to build on each game, Nguyen
said. The two matches against Davis and Cal
Poly will fire up the Card for Cal
"We are confident about |the upcoming
gamesl," Nguyen said. "But we are not tak
ing them lightly. Cal Poly will be a decent
game, and we always want to make sure we
play pretty hockey."
Davis and Cal Poly are club teams aiming
to turn varsity in the near future. Playing
time with the Cardinal this weekend will help
the two teams achieve this goal.
The Stanford squad has enjoyed a remark
able season with a winning streak that lasted
10 games, as well as victories over prestigiuu.-
teams such as Providence and Ursinus. Play
ers are more than ready to take the title t<,
mark the end of their impressive year.
"We want to uphold that title, we want to
be NorPac champions," Nguyen said. "When
we do take the title, and we have every expec
tation to do so, we will know we have worked
hard for it. It was not a fluke that we have
done so well this season."
"We're going to give [the Cal game] all
we've got," Naylor said "It's our last gaim
and it'll be a close one. We definitely need t<
stay focused the whole time; we need to con
centrate on the plays that got us to where we
are."
