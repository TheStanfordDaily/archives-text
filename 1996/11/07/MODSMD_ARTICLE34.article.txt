Body found near Jasper Ridge
The corpse of a mail who had died of a gunshot
wound was found on a horse path near Stanford's
Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve Saturday morn
ing. Police have identified the man as William
Crenshaw Kennedy, a resident of Atherton.
Police have not determined whether Kennedy's
death was suicide or murder. Det. Rick Babwin of
the San Mateo County Sheriffs Office said Kennedy
had family in Atherton and lived both there and at
another residence in Northern California.
At the time of his death, Crenshaw was working
"part-time, doing odd jobs," Babwin added.

Babwin said someone horseback riding on the
path found the body and reported it at about 11:30
a.m. The horse path is 100 feet north of the junc
tion of Whiskey Hill Road and Sand Hill Road,
where there is an entrance to Jasper Ridge.
Babwin said the police still gathering forensic
evidence and contacting people in order to gather
enough evidence to determine whether or not
Kennedy took his own life.
"At this point in time, it's not appropriate to
call it a suicide or a homicide," Babwin explained.
"There's not enough evidence to point either
way."
