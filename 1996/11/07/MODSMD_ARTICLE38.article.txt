## Taylor is no prom queen in 'Girls' 
### 
TUES/12 & FRI/15
The Stanford Film Society presents one of last summer s
indie hits, "Girls' Town." To crib from Entertainment Weekly,
"The trio of feisty high school seniors at the center of this
grrrl-affirming drama live in a world where socioeconomic
differences wash away in the warmth of girlfriend-hood and
where young women are raped but afraid to tell their friends.
... There's a nice sisterly spirit, boosted by an earnest cast
led by the tough and compelling Lili Tayloi." Directed by Jim
McKay, much of the film's dialogue was improvised by the

actors.
As part of the show, the Film Society is organizing post
screening discussions, encouraging high school students to
participate. "Girls' Town," after all, confronts issues that may be
familiar to them, such as sexual violence and gender roles
"We have found that film can be a very powerful tool for con
fronting these tough issues and learning more about each
other," said junior Jonathan Levitt, the Film Society's President
Tickets cost $3 at the door, $2 in advance in White Plaza
The film shows at 8 p.m. Tuesday, and 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Fri
day in Cubberley Auditorium.
