# Susie Sexpert Liberates Stanford
## Tips for the repressed and underage 
### 
An outspoken advocate of sexual libera
tion since adolescence, Susie Bright is the au
thor of "Susie Bright s Sexual Reality: A Vir
tual Sex World Reader," "Susie Sexpert's Les
bian Sex World" and "Sexwise." In 1981, she
began working at Good Vibrations, a San
Francisco vibrator and sex toy shop, where
she created the first progressive feminist
erotic library. She also co-founded and edit
ed "On Our Backs," a magazine for the "ad
venturous lesbian." She now lives in Santa
Cruz.
Below, the woman identified by The New
York Times Book Review as "the voice of
sweet reason and literacy" makes fun of In
termission's dumb questions, tries to get to
the root of the no-dating myth at Stanford
and explains why the elbow is the one body
part that just doesn't do it for her.

Intermission: What arc the various parts o)
your career? How did you arrive at each part?
Susie Bright: I 'm an all-dancing, all-singing,
sex machine! Sorry, I was up late last night
watching an old MGM musical. I write
books of personal essays and political sexual
commentary, I edit books of erotica, I work
as a journalist for various periodicals on hot
issues that come up, I teach classes about my
interests, like pornography or sex education,
I do workshops on erotic writing, I lecture, I
write and act and even produce various
movies, from porn to art underground to
Hollywood, I do various online and audio
projects.
It sounds more ambitious than it really is.
It's just that like most artists today, it's easier
to work in various mediums than to avoid
them. I like to express myself, and I have a
gift with my voice and my pen, so I use it.
Intermission: I read in an introduction you
wrote for an erotica anthology that you used to
write erotic stories, I think as a teen-ager.
When did sexuality become something you felt
comfortable discussing openly and publicly?
5.8.: No, I didn't write erotic stories when I
was a teen-ager, unless you count the mushy,
lust-crazed love letters I sent to my various
lovers at the time. But I did read a lot of erot
ica when I was a teen-ager, both highbrow
and 'plain brown wrapper and everything in
between.
I was also a passionate activist at my high
school in all things radical at the time, which
certainly included feminism, gay liberation,
sex education. At one point, a handful of my
friends and I took over a janitors' closet and
turned it into a birth control and abortion
referral center.
We staged a gay pride week, which in 1974
was pretty out there. I got "comfortable"
talking about sex in my various arguments
that I had at the top of my lungs with the
high school principal or inside my women's
consciousness-raising group, which was a
big center of my life, or just trying to con
vince people at school and where I worked
that sex was a political and personal issue.

Intermission: I)o you
feel our culture is different sexually
than it was when you were 20? II so, how?
S.B.: Hmm, I'm trying to think what I was
doing when I was 20.1 had this great fake II)
that I had manufactured on one of the first
color Xerox machines, because I worked in a
print shop. It worked like a dream until I got
busted at that wretched chain, "Hoolihans"
— is that still around? It's like Marie Calen
dars with a bar.
When I was 20, feminists were not dis
cussing porn and the term "sex-positive"
didn't even exist. Everyone who was a gay ac
tivist thought we all had the same opinion
and strategy about everything.
It was the Reagan years, I believe. Disco
was big, gay bars got routinely raided, I
snorted a lot of poppers without thinking
twice about it. There was this horrible ho
mophobic politician at the time, John Brig

'You're not necessarily going to fall in love with
someone who's conventionally attractive or scores
high on their SATs. This was one of my hardest
lessons about lust and love — it is
not rational, it is not about how many points you
have on the worthwhile-citizen meter.'

gs, who was trying to get anyone who was
homosexual or a friend of a homosexual, out
of the school system — he actually got this
notion on the ballot, and it was a real turning
point for the gay movement, because we had
to kick ass in order to defeat that proposition.
I literally went door to door in South Cen
tral LA. and said, "Hi, I'm gay and I really
need you to vote no on Prop. 6." That was a
great opening line. Everyone would start
spilling out their whole confidential sex his-

Tory to me.

Intermission: What s your
personal life like, in terms
of a significant other
children, etc.? (I think
you have a daughter?)
S.B.: I have a 6-year-old
daughter who is learn
ing how to read this
very minute. I hat's
very exciting. I have a
close family, most of
whom are not related to
me by blood, but who
I've shared my life with
for many years. That in
cludes my present main
squeeze and a few ex's.
Intermission: What's an
average day like for you ?
S.B.: Oh, you know, a

little masturbation, a
little hot chocolate, a
little hot tub, a quick

Susie Bright,
sexual visionary Intermission: What
projects are you working
on now?
S.B.M'm working on a novel based on my un
believable experiences as a teen-age girl
communist. I've got a new book of my vari
ous manifestos coming out this spring,
called "Susie Bright's Sexual State of the
Union," and I'm still recovering from my
most recent two books, a photo album called
"Nothing But the Girl: the Blatant Lesbian
Image" — which I think is the best thing I've
ever done — and a new edition of "Best
American Erotica 1996."
Intermission: How do you define erotica?

How do you define pornography?
5.8.: See the introduction to "Best American
Erotica 1996." 1 think I reached my highest
articulation on that subject. That question is
dead as a doornail. It's not relevant to where
sexual expression is at these days, and it was
always a prissy question to begin with,
loaded with class anxiety and not much else.
Intermission: Now, buck to Stanford students:
What advice would you give to 14,000 young

adults living on a campus where the idea per
sists that no one dales?
5.8.: Well, that's crap, for starters. And what
on earth is "dating"? Is that a euphemism tor
fucking? It implies that students at Stanford
are not social and sexual human beings,
which is ridiculous. Just because von don't
have endless hours to go to the soda fountain
and play out some version of "Happy |).i\s
doesn't mean that you aren't in touch with
your intimate needs.
Here's some realistic things that Stanford
students do, just like other students, else
where: hanging out with your friends doing
nothing in particular, getting high, watching
videos, playing games, pulling stunts, mat
ing out, doing it in those tiny dormitory beds
that really only fit one person, masturbating,
yakking up your phone bill to the ones you
miss "back home," trying to use your fake ID
to get into clubs, getting sick of clubs, driving
around and cruising, fantasizing, occasion
ally getting the hell out of town to refresh
your soul.
The pressure ot school is intense, and a lot
of people feel shy and inept or that they will
be "punished" for enjoying themselves, but
these are feelings that people will spend the
rest of their life dealing with.
Instead of living with your parents' neu
roses, you get to stare at your own tor the
first time. When you graduate and begin
your post academic life, stress is not going to
disappear, and neither are your yearnings for
companionship, sex, etc. You really have to
take the whole school experience with a
major grain of salt. It is not the be-all and
end-all.
Intermission: For students unfamiliar with
erotica, are there any particular ways (certain
hook, etc.) you'd recommend to get acquainted
with it?
5.8.: Any of the "Best American Erotica'
books, or for women authors, the "Herotica"
series. Better yet, write your own! It makes
you the most excited.
Intermission: How can an individual student
make him or herself sexy?
5.8.: Stop worrying about what everyone
else is thinking, get off the conformist band
wagon. Give a damn about something. I )on't
hide. Sexiness is creativity personified.
Intermission: What physical quality do you
think is most sexy?
5.8.: That changes every minute, depending
on who I'm looking at. I can be the most
hopeless romantic, where a person's eyes are
everything, or I can just become fixated on
somebody else's perfect round butt. Beauti
ful soft skin that you can imagine caressing,
that's nice. Hands, breasts, lips — really, 1
think I've objectified every aspect of the
human body except maybe elbows.
Intermission: What persona! quality?
5.8.: Good grief, this is like being on "The

Dating Game." I don't have a "list" of things
1 look for — I either click with someone or I
don't. Later I can have hindsight and analyze
why they attracted me. I'm not necessarily
aroused by "good" attributes — I've been at
tracted to total bastards, as well as angels.
Intermission: Who's the sexiest person you've
ever met, and why was that person sexy?
5.8.: There are a few of those constellations
in the sky. It's truly more a question of timing
than it is of that particular person. There's a

moment, when I meet someone new that I
like, and I'm filled with anticipation, but I
don't really know them yet, so it's mysteri
ous. 1 don't even know yet if we're going to
bed, there's just that question mark in the air.
That's when my libido is going crazy.
Intermission: What was the best advice any
one ever gave you regarding sex?
' 5.8.: Finding out what and where my clit
was. Getting my first vibrator. Not suppress
ing my fantasies anymore. Being adventur
! ous about sex, trying things out without a lot
i of pressure.

Intermission: A lot of students here worry that
if they're on this campus hopping with bright,
reasonably attractive people their own age who
share their interests, ami they still can't find
someone, then they never will ami getting out
into the "real world" will only be lonelier. I low
would you respond to this?
5.8.: Um, the real world is lonely and excuse
me, but you're already soaking in it. And
you're not necessarily going to fall in love
with someone who's conventionally attrac
tive or scores high on their SATs. This was
one of mv hardest lessons about lust and love

— it is riot rational, it is not about how mam
points you have on the worthwhilc-citi/en
meter. You might end up with the biggest
pair of wet panties over someone who is not
a Barbie or Ken doll. In ta^t that is probablv
what is going to happen.
I think connecting with lovers and friends
is not about "finding" something, like a lost
shoe, it's about expressing yourself and find
ing out what is meaningful to you about lite,
what makes you feel joy or passion, and as
you do that, people will iust come in your
life. You don't have to "do" anything to get
them there.
