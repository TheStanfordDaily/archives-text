# Do Me in the Wind Tunnel:
## The 						Top 10 Places on Campus to Have Sex 
### Elisabeth Morse 
Listening to the radio really sucks.
Going to a school where sex tends to be
about as infrequent as Halley's Comet
also really sucks. And to make it worse,
there is now a song which gets played
constantly which aptly illuminates and
combines the two unfortunate facts: "I
can do it in the water. I can do it on dry
land. I can do it with instruments. I can
do it with my own bare hands."
I don't know who sings this mon
strosity, but they probably didn't go to
Stanford. Any patron of our wonder
ful University knows that the smallest
inanimate objects on campus tend to
get sexualized because none of us
have that much experience with the
real thing as long as we are trapped on
the Farm (and, please, no sheep
jokes).
Not that I'm bitter. Anyway, for
those people lucky enough to have a re
cipient of their sexual frustrations
somewhere near Stanford, the de
praved minds of Intermission now
bring you the Top Ten Places on Cam
pus to Have Sex.
10 If you are aroused by the ele
ments or by Dilbert's sexy sexy haircut,
then boy, do we have a location for you.
It's got engineers, it's got wind ... it's
the wind tunnel in Terman Engineer
ing Center. We came across this weird
device entirely by accident in a lab next
to a friend's and made the mistake of
calling it a "big fan." Now the engineers
won't let us near the department, but
before the deportation we noticed that
there's crawl space under it, over it and
through it. This brings entirely new
meaning to the word "blow."
9 We've all heard about the rats that
live in the palm trees, and many of us
are scared by the fact that these promi
nent Californian emblems on campus
tend to look a bit unhealthy around
the frond areas (oooh, fronds), but se
riously, we wouldn't recommend sex

in the palm trees; one might fall and
imagine explaining that injury to the
understanding folks at Cowell. How
ever, lor those of you out there who
prefer tropical climates, who fantasize
about Brazil, who salivate at Duran
Duran's "Rio" video, we suggest the
big round plant-filled things in the
Quad. The bushes mean you'll be
pleasantly shielded from the ultimate
frisbee players and the philosophy
majors lurking about. Jungle love was
never so good.

O This is going to seem a bit boring,
but how about your dorm / house
rooms? You know, there are a lot of
people out there who can't get any
nooky (word attribution goes to
Michael Green) and don't appreciate
your public shows of affection. In fact,
it's kind of nauseating to see people
traipsing through the Bookstore slob
bering all over each other as well as the
sweatshirts (the whole idea of the re
bate is enough to make some people
horny). So please do a favor to the peo
ple who can't, won't or rarely get any
(yes, long-distance relationships to San
Francisco count) and try to at least oc
casionally use a bit of discretion and
privacy.
7 This entry may be a myth as it has
been spread only by word of mouth
and your faithful reporter has never
been there. It's not exactly on campus
either. But a beautiful concept is the
Faculty Ghetto Swimming Pool. Ap
parently, getting in requires a bit of
breaking and entering and may not ex
actly be legal, but if you're into the
aquatic thing, this could be wet and
wild.
6 Everyone denies it, but who doesn't
like to be tied up and tormented? Ckime
on, you know you chose a school by

San Francisco for all of the bondage
possibilities lurking about. So then, it
you do admit to the darker side of your
sex life, how about the Undergraduate
Machine Shop, located by Tresidder
Union? All we have to say is "toys, toys,
toys."
5 The Daily Lounge. If you're hot and
available, come by. We have a whole of
fice of repressed people who never leave
Storke Publications Building and are
not afraid to try to draw in the unsus
pecting with otters of fame and fortune.
We'll even let you look through back is
sues (bet you never thought journalism
could be that exciting).
4 Hven though this is rather straight,
boringand unimaginative, the I iish is .1
pretty damned good location. You've
got the hills, the moon, the sun, the bay
and a big techie thing that attracts
aliens, lust watch out for freshman
dorm groups.
3 Some more perversions our Univer
sity will so nicely cater to are voyeurism
and exhibitionism. Just head over to
the Meyer l ibrary multimedia room,
where you can film yourselves doing it
and then show copies to your friends
and professors.
2 People who have had sex at the
Mausoleum say it's pretty uncomfort
able (the choice is between hard marble
and hard ground), but just being able
to say that you desecrated Jane and Ice
land's grave in such a manner has got to
get you some points in the cosmic
swing of things.
1 We know that you think Hoover
Tower is going to be No. I, but you are
wrongwrongwrong. Hoover Tower is
the epitome of everything phallic and
male. It looks like a penis and it is
tilled by conservative old men. Sorry,
but no turn-on there. Instead, we
think it's time for Stanford to find a
new sexual icon, a female emblem to
match Hoover. We propose the Oval:
it's soft and round, it's got pretty flow
ers in the middle and even benches to
sprawl upon. It gets misty, mysterious
and wet at night, and glorious and
welcoming during the day. Like Eve, it
is the beginning of our campus, and
we think it's high time it got the
recognition and pagan worship it de
serves.
