# And a dissenting voice:
## Why you should calm your bad self down and be abstinent 
### Jimmy Boegle 
II aliens invaded Earth today, they would find that after
centuries of civilization, humankind has evolved to the point
that it is obsessed with one thing: sex.
Am I the only person even mildly embarrassed hy this'
I mean, sex is everywhere. "Friends" are fighting over con
donis. We do not discuss political issues, we discuss politi
cians' sex lives. "The X-Files" did a show about incest (incest
is ickv, but is it paranormal?). "Baywatch" is the most popu
lar show on the freaking planet. And even Intermission
"Stanford's Fntertainment Weekly," is dedicating an issue to
it.
Well, I guess sex is a form of entertainment. Hut really
At least, I've heard sex is entertainment. You see, I am ha\
ing nothing to do with sex. Yes, by choice. Believe it or not, I
am not the only one practicing voluntary abstinence.
While some people do not have sex due to general unat
tractiveness or hygiene problems 11 do not classify myself
in either of these categories, and if you believe that I
should, don't tell me), others are willingly just s,i\ ing no to
sex.
There are numerous reasons that a lot of people are ab
staining. One of them is morality. Sexual morality is about as
revered at Stanford as athlete's foot. Sexual freedom instead
is all the rage, hut some just do not buy into it. As premarital
sex is against my religion, which I happen to deeply believe
in, I don't buy the idea of sexual freedom, either.
However, with sex here, there and everywhere these days,
some are starting to lose hold on their beliefs, which to those
who value the freedom and integrity of beliefs, is bod (I
learned that in CIV). I have had friends who are deeply reli
gious sit there with me and rationalize their sexual escapades
when, in a society not so obsessed with whoopee, they would
never be having sex. They're compromising themselves, and
it's sad. Fortunately, not everyone is losing a grip on their be
liefs, but many are.
Another reason that people are saying no to sex is that
these days sex is flat-out dangerous. Herpes and gonorrhea
and syphilis and other nasties have always been .1 problem,
but AIDS just complicates everything more.
You do it, you die. Sounds like something out of an
Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, hut instead it is realit\ 111 the
bedroom. Yes, there are condoms and other funny-looking
devices around that help protect you from diseases, but these
things still fail. You want to place your life in the hands of
some poor guy working for peanuts somewhere 111 a latex
plant? If you do, I have some Odwalla here for you to drink.
There is also the third problem of the possibility ot preg
p ncy. I will not even touch this, as anything I sav ma\ bring
a bag of letters from people on either side of the abortion
issue, not to mention others.
So in other words, not everybody that could be having sex
is having sex these days. For some, abstinence is morally tor
rect; for others,it is just smart. Personally, lam sick of the oh
session with sex. Maybe society should direct some efforts
toward coming up with something else to be obsessed with
— it would make an alien invasion that much less embar
rassing.
