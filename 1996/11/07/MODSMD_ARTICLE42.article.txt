# The
						50 Most beautiful exiest Men Alive of the Year at stanford

It began as a joke. But then it
gathered speed, took on a life of its own
and materialized full-blown at the doors
of the office of Intermission, begging to
be published: a compendium of sexy
men at Stanford. Is this uncomfortably
reminiscent of that subscription to YM
you had in ninth grade? Yes. Are there
really 50 people? No. Does this objecti
fy men? Maybe. Now, stop us if we seem
defensive, but our thinking was that
featuring women as sex objects is
merely the status quo. Forget Playboy;
just turn to Rolling Stone or Esquire.
But featuring men as sex objects illus
trates exactly how ridiculous this phe
nomenon is. Say what you will about In
termission,- at least we'll never feature
lennifer Aniston naked and prostrate on
our cover.
