## Bourgeois Misery and Everything After The
						Counting Crows release a depressing sophomore album 
### 
Even before the Counting Crows album
"August and Everything After" was released
three years ago, an enormous buzz surround
ed the band. They opened for Bob Dylan,
they filled in for Van Morrison at his Rock 'n'
Roll Hall of Fame induction, they were the
next big thing. "August and Everything After,"
a folksy mixture of R.E.M. and yes, Bob Dylan
and Van Morrison, went on to be one of the
great albums of the year, and even had a high
ly successful single in the song "Mr. Jones."
Here was a band with potential.
Unfortunately, Counting Crows' new
album "Recovering the Satellites" does not live
up to that potential. In the years since the last
album, they've traded in their acoustic guitars
for that loud, fuzzy guitar sound that renders
them completely indistinguishable from
every other alterna-rock band around. The
first two songs are perfect examples of this:
"Catapult" is all muddy chords and angst,
while "Angels of the Silences," with its refer
ences to sin, innocence and death sounds like
something by Live.
However, it's not all bad. The Crows excel

on this album when they experiment with
sounds: the jazzy scat of "Another Horse
dreamer's Blues," the blues harmonica on
"Mercury" and the playful piano of "Monkey."
Also, the more folksy songs such as "Good
night Elisabeth," "Daylight Fading" and "A
Long December" are nice and play to the
band's strengths.
Another weakness in "August and Every
thing After" which ought to have been ad
dressed is the overwhelmingly depressing na
ture of lead singer Adam Duritz' lyrics. He has
a gift for poetic imagery but wastes it on dour
moaning.
Sadly, things haven't changed on "Recover
ing the Satellites." In "Monkey," he sings, "I'm
all messed up — that's nothing new," and in
"Goodnight Elisabeth" he declares himself
"the king of the rain." However, the album's ab
solute low point is the dreadful "Miller's An
gels," which is like the last album's melancholy
"Round Here" on downers. He wails, "Won't
you leave leave leave leave leave me alone!" as if
playing that game where a word sounds really
silly when you repeat it
So basically, this is a decent album that fails
to live up to the potential of "August and
Everything After." If you absolutely loved that

album and felt that Duritz was talking direct
ly to you, then you should run out and buy
the new one. If you thought that "August" was
a good album but that the band could do bet

ter, you still might like "Recovering the Satel
lites," but you'll be disappointed that they
didn't try harder.
