# CARL PERKINS "Go Cat Go" and ALLEN GINSBERG "The Ballad of the Skeletons"
## 
### 
Because rock 'n' roll is now such an old mu
sical form, having reached its fourth genera
tion in the '90s, a large portion of its audience
has painfully little knowledge of its roots and
history. Thus, a number of established rock
stars have donated their names and talents to
the newer works of some of the seminal figures
of rock's history, perhaps hoping to stir up in
terest in these largely forgotten performers. In
the past, artists as diverse as Frank Sinatra,
John Lee Hooker and Chuck Berry have all re
leased albums noticeable for this form of
"celebrity charity."
Now, two legends from the '50s, Carl
Perkins and Allen Ginsberg, have both re
leased new music which falls under this very
category. Surprisingly, both works are fresh
and dynamic, showing no signs of weariness
from old age.
Of the two, Perkins is particularly in need
of some celebrity charity. Along with Bo Did
dley, Perkins is one of the most undervalued
founding fathers of rock 'n' roll. His "Blue
Suede Shoes" is one of the few essential rock
anthems. Indeed, his version of the songs was
the first single to simultaneously top the pop,

country, and rhythm and blues charts, per
haps providing the most obvious evidence in
1956 that a new musical style was developing,
one which was not country or pop or R&B.
Unfortunately, Perkins never again
achieved a similar level of popularity, regard
less of a productive career as a
rockabilly / country artist. Now, however,
Perkins has assembled an unbelievable assort
ment of rock legends to help create a new
album, "Go Cat Go," made in celebration of
the 40th anniversary of "Blue Suede Shoes."
Recording new and old music from every

decade of his career, Perkins is joined by Paul
McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr,
Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Tom Petty, John
Fogerty, Paul Simon and Bono on various
tracks.
Even more remarkable than his stellar sup
porting cast is the fact that the album fits to
gether as a seamless whole. Alternating be
tween country, rockabilly, and rock 'n' roll,
"Go Cat Go" is a lesson in the very birth of
rock itself.
On "Honey Don't" with Paul Simon,
"Matchbox" with Willie Nelson and "Go Cat
Go," Perkins flashes his exuberant view of rock
as a strong backbeat with a country quiver. In
particular, on "One More Shot" with Tom
Petty, Perkins sounds absolutely vital, as if he
is begging audiences to give him just one more
chance.
However, Perkins may display his best side
on the album's pure country tracks, whether
on the gorgeous "Distance Makes No Differ
ence With Love" with George Harrison or on
the simmering "Rockabilly Music" with Paul
Simon.
Indeed, there is little reason to believe that
the overall excellence of the album is a result of
Perkins' collaboration with modern musi
cians, as his solo tracks are in no way inferior
to the rest of the work. Perkins has created a
living time capsule back to the beginning of
rock 'n' roll, one as enjoyable as it is enlighten
ing.
In stark contrast to Perkins' album is Allen
Ginsberg's powerful new single "The Ballad of
the Skeletons." If Perkins, the son of a Ten
nessee sharecropper, helped created rock 'n'
roll's heart, Ginsberg helped create its mind.
Grouped with William Burroughs and Jack

Keroauc in the triumvirate of essential poets
from the Beat generation, Ginsberg was on the
cutting edge of the values which rock and roll
soon absorbed: rebellion, sex, drugs and a love
of trying to express the inexpressible.
Working with Patti Smyth-producer Lenny
Kaye, avant-garde composer Phillip Glass, and
longtime friend Paul McCartney, Ginsberg
has turned his recent poem, "The Ballad of the
Skeletons" into a rock 'n' roll single.
Emphasizing the ideological extremes of
our age, Ginsberg presents a series of rhymed
couplets, often representing diametrically op
posed views. Employing his acerbic wit, the
work aims to provoke: "Said the Buddha
skeleton, 'Compassion is wealth.' / Said the
corporate skeleton, 'It's bad for your health.'
.. . Said the neo-conservative skeleton,
'Homeless off the streets!' / Said the free-mar
ket skeleton, 'Use them up for meat.'"
Although liberation politics is an old story
for Ginsberg, the surprise is the strength of the
music. The musicians play an organically hyp
notic form of primal rock 'n' roll, recalling the
power of John Lennon's "Plastic Ono Band"
album. In particular, McCartney's organ and
percussion provides a strong rhythmic coun
terpoint to Ginsberg's vocals which is so com
pelling that the song delivers a physical as well
as mental release.
Indeed, one aspect both albums share is an
appreciation for the importance of rhythmic
swing within rock and roll. Whether people
find themselves to be too intellectual for
Perkins or too conservative for Ginsberg, the
music itself is a force of natural rhythm, which
is the essential joy of rock 'n' roll.
