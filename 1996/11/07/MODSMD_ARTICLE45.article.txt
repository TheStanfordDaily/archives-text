## ULRIKE-ANIMA MATHÉ "Four Sonatas for Unaccompanied Violin" 
### 
It recordings for accompanied violin
music are far from scarce, then those for solo
violin are rare by comparison. One can al
most count on one hand the composers
whose solo violin music are in the active
repertoire: Bach, Paganini and Bartok. F.ven
solo sonatas by Ysaye are still considered nov
elties, let alone those by lesser-known com
posers.
This album is the second of a two-CD an
thology of Max Reger's seven sonatas for solo
violin, Op. 91. With Bach being the harbinger
of this genre, all such compositions by subse
quent composers are inevitably held up for
comparison.
It is surprising though that Reger, whose
music is notorious tor its sheer complexity
and polyphony, should have turned to this
genre. Cranted, the violin can produce poly
phonic textures far better than flute or oboe.
But it still cannot rival piano or organ in the
ability to sustain multiple voices. Nonethe
less, Reger strives to instill the same type of
complicated structure into these solo pieces,
though the texture is considerably leaner and
smoother.
Mathe's technique is solid, though not im
peccable. Aside from her attempt to maintain
a fluid transition from one phrase to another,
she occasionally sounds strained. Her main
strength lies in the unhurried pacing, thus
letting the music unfold naturally. This is not
music that pleases the ear upon first listening,
and she certainly deserves credit for playing
as melodically as she can.
Mathe is a relatively unknown violinist in
the concert arena, but her foray into this
tricky and uncharted repertoire is laudable.
In these days when violinists go in droves to
record the same Mendelssohn and
Tchaikovsky concertos, it is refreshing to

hear works such as the Reger sonatas.
Whether or not they will ever make it into the
standard repertoire ultimately depends on
the championship of major violinists. At least
its comforting to know somebody out there
is trying.
