# VARIOUS ARTISTS
## "Shared Vision 2" 
### 
Let me begin by saying that I'm not really
a big Stones tan. But, with covers clone by
Cinderella, Tom Jones, The Neville Brothers
and Joe Cocker how could anyone not be
drawn to this latest Rolling Stones antholo
gy? This CI) takes the listener on a walk down
memory lane and back, with its well-selected
blend ot both classic and contemporary hits
by the Stones. It literally has something for
everyone.
Of course, nothing is perfect. The "No Ex
pectations" cover by Johnny Cash left some
thing to be desired. The title is obviously a
disclaimer. How shall I say this. . . Johnny,
stick to country music. As Johnny continued
to drone on and on I was praying for this song
to end.
I really like the song "(1 Can't Cet No) Sat
isfaction," or at least I did until I heard Tom
Jones' version. Nothing against Tom Jones
personally — he's a great guy and I love most
of his stuff. But, his version of this song was
pathetic and watered down, transmogrified
into easy listening music.
Aside from these two anomalies, this CD
rocked. "Paint It Black," done by The Feelies,
was perhaps even better than the original.
Their lead vocalist gives the lyrics a sexy, al
most haunting quality. I'his is by far the best
cover on the entire album. The other excep
tional cover on the CD is a live version of
"Sympathy for the Devil" by Thrashing
Doves, performed with the arrogance and
unctuousness that it requires.
"Shared Vision 2" also contains three pre
viously unreleased tracks, all of which are
well worth listening to. Taking you back to
the '80s, Cinderella adds a heavy metal/
thrasher element, albeit toned down, to the
CD in its cover of "Jumping Jack Flash.'' This
version is live and feels "live," as well.
Most of the other songs fall into the
mediocre category. Although "Sister Mor
phine" is perversely romantic, Marianne
Faithfull's extreme vocal fluctuations made
me think I was having a bad acid (mor
phine?) trip. The Pogues' cover of "Honky
Tonk Woman" is decent, but their lead vocal
ist tries too hard to be lagger.
Rod Stewart singing "Street Fighting
Man" is a bit of an oxymoron. On the
brighter side, this track has great bass lines.
Unfortunately, Stewart's annoying, raspy
voice "adult-contemporizes" this track.
But hey, he does look like Keith Richards,
right?
So, what does this all mean? Should or
shouldn't you spend 15 bucks on this CD?
Let me first say that "a portion of the pro
ceeds from the sale of this album will be do
nated to benefit people who are blind or
partially sighted" (hence the title). So, if tor
no other reason, you should buy it tor al

truistic purposes. But, and a huge but at
that, there definitely are plenty of other rea
sons to purchase this album. It successfully
combines the talents of artists from vastly
different genres into a great tribute to the
Rolling Stones.
