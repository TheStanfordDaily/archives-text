# LEMONHEADS
## "car button cloth" 
### 
It's hard to pin
down where the
Lemon heads have
wandered to from
the band that
made "It's a
Shame about
Ray," but they def
initely do not
sound like the
group that drove
teen-age girls wild
and begging for
more.
It's still the
same steady
rhythm, upbeat
melodies and low,
raspy-at-the-cor
ners voice of lead
singer Evan
Dando, but this

band has an entirely different sound. Un
doubtedly, this difference can be partly at
tributed to members changing; some even
consider the "Lemonheads" to have broken
up after the 1993 album, "Come on Feel the
Lemonheads," with the loss of Juliana Hat
field who featured prominently on bass and
backup vocals and David Ryan on drums.
The new members include Patrick Mur
phy, formerly of Dinosaur Jr. on drums,
Dina Waxman from the group Three and
Yuichi replacing Hatfield, and Bill Gibson
on guitars and bass.
"Car button cloth" doesn't have the char
acteristic Lemonheads edge. Instead, it com
bines country, folk, rock and brash pop, as if
by including widely different categories of
music, it will attract more listeners. In fact, it
gives the album the impression that songs
have been thrown in without deliberation and
that the band does not know which direction
it's going.
At one point, "car button cloth" abruptly
switches from the very country, monotonous
"KnoxvilleCiirl" to a heavy metal-esque "6i\"
to straight-out-of-a-lounge-act "C'mon
Daddy," so that you're left confused and un
balanced.
The album begins with the track, "Its All
True" which rings of the Lemonheads of
old. Then, in the third song, Dando's char
acteristic raspy voice disappears behind the
overriding instrumental parts. It almost
seems like the separate sections have noth
mg to do with one another; the drums pulse

their own beat, the bass and guitars spin
into personal rifts and 1 )ando softl\ sings as
it off in another world. What was addi
tionally odd about this album were the
weird sound effects of bird chirpings, beat
ing on cans and bells hapha/ardlv tossed in.
"Car button cloth' leaves the staunchest of
tans shaking their heads and thinking, as

Dando himself says in one song, "Je ne sais
quoi."

Is Evan Dando criminally stupid or does he just seem that way in
interviews?
