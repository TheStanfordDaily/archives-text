## "See" 
### 
It doesn't mean much to call this "alterna
tive rock," hut that would he its description.
This Pennsylvania-based rock band has
recorded some catchy but not particular!)
memorable tunes on "See' â€” they sound
kind of like Green Day, 111st slightly more
pensive, with less screaming and more ot a
melody. Oh. and with an affected British at.
cent.
All of the lyrics sound like the\ re being
sung to a girl, which is also common but not
bad. So the themes aren't that deep, and from
the looks of the liner photo ot this voung
band, it's not hard to imagine that the onlv
major song meriting experiences the\ ve had
are crushes, breakups and other relational
rough bumps.
Nonetheless, their naive, playful whining
feels good to listen to. The\ have the same
lulling effect as The Beatles; the\ have a nice
tune and pleasant vocals, accompanied h\
words that don't matter as much.
