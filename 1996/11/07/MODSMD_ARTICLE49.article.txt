# Young Poets' Society
## Ethan Hawke's first novel is harder to make fun of than you'd imagine 
### Rito Trevino 
It's always fun to see a celebrity try some
thing new. Tom Hanks just gave writing and
directing a commendable shot in "That
Thing You Do!" A couple of action-movie
stars (namely Stallone, Schwarzenegger and
Willis) have become restaurant entrepre
neurs; now there's a Planet Hollywood in
every major city. Michael Jordan, after a few
bouts with TV commercials, is doing the
whole acting bit by taking the starring role in
"Space Jam" (well, technically he's still play
ing basketball).

BOOK REVIEW

Given all these role changes in and out of
Hollywood, it should come as no surprise
that Ethan Hawke has decided to try his hand
at writing fiction. We all know Hawke from
his starring roles in "Reality Bites" and "Be
fore Sunrise," and some might remember
movies from earlier in his acting career like
"Dead Poets Society" and one of my person
al favorites, "The Explorers."
But enough about movies. Let's move on
to the burning question: Can an actor really
write? Or perhaps the better question is can
an actor write fiction? When celebrities sit
down to write a book, they usually do noth
ing more than reflect upon their own lives
and purposes — O.J. Simpson defending his
innocence or Howard Stern proclaiming his
craziness.
Creative writing is not always so easy. Nev
ertheless, Hawke is taking his chances with
"The Hottest State" (l ittle, Brown; $19.95), a
modern love story which should turn the
heads of readers and literary critics if only be
cause of 1 lawke's presence in 1 lollywood.
"The Hottest State" is a fairly well-written
book. Hawke has an interesting style that
mixes fast-paced dialogue with introspective
passages. 1 was impressed with his efficiency

in describing action;
you can read a short
passage and develop
a clear understand
ing of what is hap
pening, perhaps
without realizing
that most of the pic
ture has been left to
your own imagina
tion.
On the other
hand, a major prob
lem with the novel is
that the plot lacks
originality. "The
Hottest State" is, to
put it simply, the
story of William and
Sarah, a New York
couple who meet in a
bar, have a wild, pas
sionate relationship
and break up. The

conclusion is nothing surprising, either. In
fact, Hawke makes a point of describing the
outcome of certain events before they hap
pen. But he is able to save the book from self
destruction by adding depth to his characters.
William narrates the story. He has
dropped out of college, taken up acting in
New York and is on the verge of turning 21.
He begins by describing his first encounter
with Sarah, a naive, Cornell-educated gal
who dreams of making a career out of
singing. As luck would have it, they hit it off
instantly.
What follows is a mad whirlwind of emo
tion. Hawke can do little to prevent the
cheesiness that develops as William and
Sarah build their relationship. They go on
dates to the zoo, run into former lovers at
parties, kiss in the rain and move in together
for a few days. They recite lines from "Romeo
and Juliet," and William shouts at her win
dow in the middle of the night. William also

counts the days they
have been together
and fawns over her
with enough fervor to
make one gag. At
times it seems like
Hawke is just spewing
the script to one of his
movies.
Then again, the
book contains a few
passages with genuine
charm. Hawke cap
tures brief points of
happiness the way we
often do in our own
lives — with wild ex
aggeration. William's
idle habit of staring
out the window is rev
olutionized when he
realizes that Sarah
lives in the building
next to him. Later,

when they arc living together and he is
watching Sarah sleep, he remarks, "This
must be what praying is like."
Hawke also mixes random tidbits of wis
dom into the dialogue. The two are having a
rather serious conversation about Sarahs
past, for example, when she observes that
children are praised for having dreams but
adults are practically scorned for doing the
same.
William's ultimate goal, it seems, is to get
Sarah to have sex with him. Yet Sarah is a
puzzle to him, as she is willing to do just
about anything but that ultimate act.
Her hesitance helps to show that Sarah is
emotionally indecisive. She refuses to com
pletely express her emotions to William, sug
gesting that she doesn't truly love him. When
they break up, she shrugs the whole thing off
rather easily and expects him to do the same.
William, however, is unwilling to let go of
her; he's reached a level of tenderness that he

never experienced in his previous relation
ships. As Sarah discovers, he has his own
flaw: He handles life as it it were one grand
drama.
Hawke uses a series of sad anecdotes to
mold William's past into something with
which the reader can relate. Most anecdotes
deal with his parents' broken marriage.
William also explains his relationship with
his first girlfriend, Samantha, who had two
abortions during their teen-age years.
The love between William and Sarah cul
minates m a trip to Paris. 1 )uring their week
long stay together, they finally have sex. I hc\
briefly consider getting married there, but
Sarah backs out. Sarah goes home while
William stays in France for a few weeks to
complete a movie role. When he returns,
Sarah has decided that she doesn't really want
a relationship.
William becomes obsessed with winning
Sarah back. When he begins to leave count
less messages on her answering machine,
Sarah becomes frightened and threatens to
report him to the police.
Barred from Sarah completely, William
becomes violent, throwing things out of his
window, smashing his telephone and other
wise destroying his apartment. Weare moved
to sympathize with him as his life turns to
shambles.
In the end, Sarah and William are both
forced to reassess their lives and accept who
they are. As they go their separate ways, we
can see their new vision of hope. In this re
spect, the novel is really a story about a ma
turity through the uncertain stage of young
adulthood.
"The Hottest State" seems to be more of a
tool to express Ethan Hawke's opinions
about life and love than a serious attempt at
breakthrough fiction. Still, I think it's won
derful to see an entertainer demonstrate such
versatility. Now, if he can develop a more in
spirational plot tor a novel, Ill be sure to pick
the next one up.
