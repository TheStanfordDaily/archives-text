# Faculty Senate to hear C-15 recommendations
## State of University address also on Casper's agenda 
### Crystal Carreon Contributing writer 
Students should determine the level of burden of
proof in the revised judicial charter, Committee of 15
Chair Mark Zoback said yesterday.
The issue of burden of proof needs to be clarified,
the geophysics professor said, leading into discussion
of the committee's proposed revisions at a Faculty
Senate meeting today.
Contrary to public perception, he said, proposed
changes to the charter do not advocate a reduction of

the standard of evidence needed to
convict a student from "beyond a rea
sonable doubt" to "clear and con vine
ing.
The Faculty Senate is getting its
first look at a draft report of the com
mittee's recommendations and will
not vote today. The Faculty Senate,
ASSU Senate and Casper must all ap
prove a final proposal.


Casper
Following the discussion, Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
will discuss fund raising and Stan
ford's future at his annual State of
the University address to the Aca
demic Council.
About 50 possible Honor Code
or Fundamental Standard viola
tions were tried hist year and not
one case went through the Stan
ford Judicial Council, according to
Zoback. Instead, the cases were
adjudicated by the dean of stu
dents. The judicial affairs process
consequently "evolved into a
purely administrative system," he
said.
The committee has recom
mended the creation of a 15-mem
ber standing board to review the
judicial affair policies, composed
of six students, six faculty mem
bers and three staff members.
In addition, recommendations
include formulating a six-member
judicial panel to hear all cases. A

student will chair the panel,
which is responsible for making
all the decisions about guilt and
sanctions.
Members of the judicial panel
will be appointed by the judicial
adviser. Additionally, the judicial
adviser will act as the chief Uni
versity administrator, counsel
and reporter of judicial affairs, as
well as serve as a neutral party.
A student may appeal the judi
cial panel's sanction within 14
days of the decision. An appeals
panel consisting of four students
and two staff members who did
not serve on the original judicial
panel may rehear a case if the stu
dent can prove that a significant
procedural error occurred, com
pelling new evidence exists or
that he or she received an inap
propriate sanction for the of
fense.
Overall, Zoback said the char
ter is "long overdue for revision."
After the meeting, University
President Gerhard Casper will de
liver his annual State of the Uni
versity address. The speech is
scheduled for 4 p.m. in Kresge Au

ditorium and is open to the com
munity.
Casper will address issues
ranging from alumni contribu
tions and the importance of fund
raising to evolving programs such
as introductory studies.
According to University Com
munications Director Terry Shep
ard, Casper will use statistical in
formation to gauge the relative
strengths and weaknesses of the
University's assets, including peo
ple, financial resources, reputa
tion and construction and utility.
According to a preliminary
draft of his speech, Casper will
first focus on the University's
$1.4-billion budget and $3.6-bil
lion endowment. It is expected
that he will stress the continued
importance of fund-raising efforts
to build on the University's com
petitiveness and quality.
Shepard said the speech will
cover a lot of ground, while avoid
ing specific details and cliches.
"He's not a bumper-sticker
man; he wants to get into issues of
substance, not slogans," Shepard
said.
