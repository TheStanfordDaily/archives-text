# CATHERINE
## "Hot Saki and Bedtime Stories" 
### 
Take Smashing Pumpkins, squeeze out
some of the deep-rooted hatred for the world,
tone down the thick guitars a notch and you've
got C Catherine's "Hot Saki and Bedtime Stories,"
ready to rile your senses and put you to bed. But
fear not, this is a good thing.
With their 1993 album, "Sleepy," produced
by Billy Corgan (lead vocals for Smashing
Pumpkins), and this album recorded on the
apple farm of D'Arcy Brown (Smashing
Pumpkins) and drummer Kerry Brown,
(Catherine has definite stylistic influences from
the now megastar Pumpkins.
Like the Pumpkins, (Catherine are not so
very cheerful but bring their own slightly di
luted version of the alternative / metal move
ment. Despite the overall pessimism of the

album, you can tell the band has tun with its
grinding guitars and vocals, sporting songs
with titles like "Cotton Candy High," "Milk
shake," and "Good Luck Charm." Still, even in
these songs, the album is about as mellow as
they get, with heavy feedback in only a few se
lections.
In "It's gonna get worse," vocalist Mark Rew
sets the tone for the album with the lines,
"When your love has come and gone, and
everything that you know has come undone,
better have fun." The song is a bit repetitive,
but it boasts a compelling combination of
chords that makes you want to sway with the
music.
The band gets a little wilder on "Cotton
Candy High," with heavy guitar rifts reminis
cent of Nirvana's "Nevermind" album. The
melody line is simple, and the lyrics don't make
a whole lot of sense (i.e. "Go on seduce me, you
can't reduce me"), but it's a fun tune, almost
Weezer-esque.
"Sign of the Cross," which Rew composed
for his son, is a bit disturbing with its eerie un
dertones and guitar feedback. "The song came

about one morning when he was waking up...
It's just me singing to my son," he has ex
plained.
Rew admits the song is "slightly creepy," and
I'd have to agree, considering that 1 haven't a
clue as to what the lines, "There's a tiger on the
pillow, and a head is on the tiger might mean
It's definitely not your traditional lullaby.
In another mellow tune, "Pink Floyd
Poster," the band pays tribute to "l)ark Side of
the Moon" while alternating between heaw
guitar and the mellow tones of that legendar\
group. (etching the spirit of the drug-induced
lyrics ot that era, Rew sings, "I forgot how to
smile /1 forgot how to kill /1 forgot how to feel
anything that's real /1 forgot how to say 1 love
you." Again, slightly repetitive, but a soothing
tune.
Definitely a versatile band that an\ true "al
ternative" listener would enioy, ( atherine pre
sents just the right mix of hard hitting num
bers and soft, calm melodies to show the stark
contrast of the title, "Hot Saki and Bedtime
Stories."
