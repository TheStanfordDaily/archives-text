## Father of the Year Gibson a strong reason to see Howard's 'Ransom' 
### 
rhe somber and sometimes gruesome "Ran
som" is ncH director Ron Howard's usual happy
slice-of-Americana. Something happened since
Howard put together the uplifting "Apollo 13,"
namely Quentin Tarantino.
"Ransom" focuses on Tom Mullen (Mel Ciih
son), the man who has everything: a beautiful
wife, an extraordinarily well-behaved kid and his
[>wn airline, "Endeavor."
All goes to hell when his son is kidnapped, and
Mullen must confront an unscrupulous business
deal from his past. After the FBI messes up the
ransom dropoff, Mullen takes things into his own
hands and offers up $2 million as a bounty for
whoever can turn over the kidnapper.
The kidnapper is Jimmy Shaker (Clary Sinise)
11 New York City cop! Ile and his goons, which
include ex-New Kid on the Block Donnie
U'ahlberg (Clubby) in a surprisingly good perfor
mance, outmaneuver the FBI. But Mullen, with
\iller business instincts, literally gives them a run
for their money.
The pillar of the movie is Mullen and his
struggle with the ethics of his actions. Gibson
does a nice job with a character who is part fam
ily man, part ambitious businessman and part
action hero. Crying, veiling, clenching his jaw or

contemplating suicide, Gibson does it all believ
ably.
As Mullen's wife, Rene Russo is unfortunate
enough to be the movie's window dressing. Her
hair sure does look pretty as she cries and stands
by her man.
Most disappointing, however, is Sinise. It's as
if he's so conscious of trying not to overplay the
villain that he underplays it. Sure he's got Jack
Nicholson eyebrows and can make his voice
sound pretty creepy, but he didn't really give his
character anything memorable.
After sitting through 1 1/2 hours of intense
emotional turmoil shown in Howard's usual
clear and fluid style, the bloody shootout ending
is a shocker. I felt like I was watching the ending
of'"Reservoir Dogs." I can't think of Ron Howard
as Opie anymore.
As if Tarantino-esque violence wasn't enough,
Howard adds in a dash of Steven Spielberg. The
very last scene is in black and white except for a
few red accents — exactly what Spielberg did in
"Schindler's l ist." I'm sure he had some thematic
purpose behind it, but the switch was so distract
ing that it took away from the emotional impact
of the scene.
Despite Howard's momentary lapses, Gib
son's portrayal of a very interesting and believ
able character makes this a worthwhile film.
