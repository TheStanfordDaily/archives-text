# Sentimental Education
## Winslet and Eccleston find love and tragedy in classic 'Jude' 
### 
"Sense and Sensibility" this is not. A peri
od drama this is; an adaptation ofone ofEng
lish literature's great novels this is; a story of
love and social status this is, and a tlick with
Kate Winslet this is. But a sweet I9th-centur\
British romantic comedy this definitely is
not.
Enter tragic hero. Christopher Eccleston
( hide), best known in America for his role in
the black comedy "Shallow Grave," brings di
rector Michael Winterbottom's romantically
bleak "Jude" to life, playing the determined
stonemason who patiently longs for a univer
sity education.
Enter first tragic conflict. Despite warn
ings from his dowager Aunt Drusilla ("Ab
solutely Fabulous" s June Whitfield) that his
family isn't the marrying kind, Jude embarks
upon a passionate hut disastrous marriage to
a pig farmer's flirtatiously wild daughter
("Muriel's Wedding" 's Rachel Griffiths).
Starting anew, Jude seeks his way toward the
university, knowledge and his dreams only to
meet und tall in love with his cousin.

Enter tragic love interest. Goodbye Mari
anne Dashwood, hello Sue Bridehead.
Winslet, fresh from "Sense and Sensibility'
Oscar-mania, takes a personality turn to play
Jude's startlingly modern and intelligent
cousin and later love, delivering her lines
with an alternately sharp wit and mature res
onance.
Enter second tragic conflict. The unre
quited romantic tension between the two i?,
simultaneously wonderful and painful to
watch as is the progression of their subse
quent love story, which ultimately ends —
surprise! — not on the happiest of notes.
Enter tragic ending. By the end of the film,
it's apparent that Hardy and Winterbottom
have a knack for destroying love and beauty.
But cinematographs Eduardo Serra's pho
tography is so rich you can't help but want
more. And Winslet and Eccleston's chemistry
is inviting, passionate and sensitive as they
drive one another toward ruin. And it's only
fair to admit that Winterbottom pulls "Jude'
off with such style and grace that you can't
blame him for making such a wonderful
tragedy or doing it with such pleasure.

Christopher Eccleston (Jude) falls in love with Kate Winslet (Sue), a move that leads
to a very Hardy-ian ending.
