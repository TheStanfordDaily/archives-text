For about two weeks, while the cast of the
Drama Department's production of "The
Inspector General" found themselves in a

shots behind the scenes. Here's a glimpse of
theater in the making and art in the wings, an

Nikolai Gogol's "The Inspector General,"
directed by Aleksandra Wolska and with sets
and costumes by Judith Dolan, is a satire on
human vanity and political production. It
runs through Saturday at 8 p.m. at Little

ulty/staff and $10 general. They can be pur
chased at the door or at the Tresidder box of
fice. Call 725-ARTS for more information.
