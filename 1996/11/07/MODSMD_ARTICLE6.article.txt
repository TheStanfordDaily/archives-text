## Campus precincts report 70.2% of voters reelect president 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
The votes are in at Stanford, and the
percentage cast for President Clinton
on campus was well above the national
average.
According to results released by the
Santa Clara County Registrar's Office,
the 11 campus precincts reported that
President Clinton garnered 70.2 per
cent of the popular vote. Bob Dole
trailed at 13.6 percent, with Green
Party candidate Ralph Nader close be
hind at 10.4 percent. The results do not
include absentee ballots.
Nationwide, Clinton only received
49 percent of the popular vote, with
Dole receiving 41 percent after 99 per
cent of the precincts had reported.
Clinton's high figures came as no
surprise to most student leaders.
"I think that Stanford students
tend to be more liberal and more De
mocratic than the rest of the country.
That's just intuitive," said junior Dave
Thomas, chair of the Stanford Democ
rats.
ASSU President Bill Shen was also
enthusiastic about the support for
Clinton. "I'm pleasantly surprised by it
all. Seventy is a good number," he said.
Meanwhile, campus Republicans
conceded to Clinton's landslide victory
at Stanford.
"I'm not surprised by the over
whelming majority on the Stanford
campus voting for Clinton," said
sophomore Jonathan Russell, chair of
the Stanford College Republicans.
Thomas reiterated that students

had difficulty relating to Dole be
cause of his age. "I think especially
the fact that we're college students
had an impact on students' feelings
on Dole," Thomas said.
Third-party candidates received
the remaining 16.2 percent of the
campus vote.
"I'm extraordinarily pleased to
get into the double digits," said se
nior Rudy Delson, president of the
Progressive Student Network,

which supported Nader's Candida
cy.
While Nader did not beat Clinton,
both Delson and sophomore Brian
Singerman, president of the Stan
ford Libertarians, were satisfied
with how third-party candidates
fared in the election.
"I'm glad [Libertarian candidate
Harry BrowneJ got a percentage
point. That's what he got nation
wide. I'm glad lialph Nader did so
well," said Singerman, adding that it
said a lot for third-party candidates.
Of the 6,919 people who were reg
istered with one of the campus
precincts, 3,378 voters turned out to

vole m the presidential race, produc
ing a 48.8 percent voter turnout rate.
The local percentage is consistent
with state and national figures.
Russell remained optimistic
about the turnout.
"At least half the people are vot
ing, which is at least a start," he said.
Singerman said the lack of choic
es in the race may have accounted lor
low turnout at Stanford
"This whole thing was decided a
long time ago. Unless you were going
to vote for a third-party candidate,
there wasn't much of a reason" to
vote in the presidential race, he said.
Shen and Thomas pointed to po

tential discrepancies in the turnout
rate.
"One thing to consider about the
figure is that there are a lot of people
that live overseas or no longer live
here. It's not wholly accurate,"
Thomas said.
Shen added that students change
addresses frequently, which he said
can cause some confusion and some
inaccuracy in polling.
"I'd be curious to see what the
double-registered figures are," said
Shen, who admitted he is registered
in two different places. "1 don't
think that reflects the number of
students voting."
