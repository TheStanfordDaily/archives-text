# A 						true Warrior
## English professor brings light to modern Native American history in recent books 
### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
It's hard to believe that 33-year
old Robert Allen Warrior, often
dressed in jeans with his long hair
neatly tied in a ponytail, has already
secured a national reputat ion and is
deemed by a colleague to be the
"best Native American scholar out
there."
Warrior, an assistant professor
in the English Department since
1992, teaches courses in American
and American Indian literature and
intellectual history.
He has written two books. The
first, "Tribal Secrets: Recovering
American Indian Intellectual Tra
ditions," was published in 1995; the
most recent, published this year, is
"Like a Hurricane: The Indian
Movement from Alcatraz to
Wounded Knee."
"I was too young at the time of
these events but curious about
these stories," Warrior said, ex
plaining what convinced him to
write the second book "I'd hear
people talking about events and
movements in a shorthand, but the
stories I'd hear were compressed. I
wanted to give a longer version and
view of the story and give a sense of
what it was like to be there."
In "Like A Hurricane," Warrior
and co-author Paul Chaat Smith re
count nuyor events for contempo
rary Native Americans. The seizure
of Alcatraz in 1969 by Indian ac
tivists, the storming of the Bureau

of Indian Affairs budding in Wash
ington, D.C., in 1972 and the
seizure of Wounded Knee by the
Oglala Sioux in 1973 are all little
documented but significant histori
cal episodes brought to light in War
rior's book.
Warrior met Smith, a Co
manche, in 1990 while he was living
in New York City Smith had read
some of Warrior's work in maga
zines and journals, and a year later,
they decided to cooperate in writing
about the Indian movement of the
1960s and 19705.
The two scholars spent four
years working on the book, trying to
give a narrative of some of the cru
cial events of Native American his
tory from the pcrspect ive of the peo
pie who participated in them
Although Wamor was too young
to be an active contributor to the
movement, Smith was witness to
parts of it.
Working together, they expand
ed the focus of the book. Because of
their age differences and their own
experiences, each had different ref
erence points which made them ask
each other questions.
They also attempted to explain
things so that the information
would be accessible to college stu
dents.
"I really like this book a lot be
cause of its story-telling style of
writing," said senior Patty Fergu
son, member of the Houma tribe
and one of Warrior's advisees. "It
tells of a period that is not written
much about, but people need to
know about it."
In their research, the co-authors
had to track down both the story
and the people who were a part of it.
Warrior found it a rewarding — but
difficult and frustrating — project.
"It's a dark story with some dark
aspects almost from the start,"
Warrior said. "We were recon
structing and reliving these darker
events, like when people died. It re
quired a psychological connection."
Warrior explained that under
standing the people who struggled
and worked so hard wears on the
soul.
"Trying to stand in their place,
you come to like them as a character
and then watch them make a tragic
misstep," Warrior said. "This re
quires a level of emotion and feel
ing. As someone once said, 'Writing
is easy: You just open up a vein and
bleed.' "
Still, Warrior hopes to write as
many books as he can.
He has worked as journalist
since high school, writing for the
Wichita Eagle, the Reader, the Pro
gressive and the Village Voice. Jour
nalistic style shows through in War
rior's books and lectures.
"Prof. Warrior has a way of writ
ing and teaching that doesn't put
blame on anyone," said Ferguson.
"He just presents the facts and
doesn't try and bias or force an
opinion on his students."
Born and raised in Marion City,
Kan., as a member of the Osage
tribe, Warrior values traditional
Osage cultural life and discloses no
information on the private aspects
of tribal culture.

"It's a personal and integral part
in my life," Warrior said. "Every
year, we'd go back to [Osage Coun
ty], Okla., for the tribe's ceremonies
to participate and spend time with
the family."
Growing up as a tribe member,
Warrior said he had ample opportu
nity to learn about discrimination
and injustice.
"I watched my father deal with
issues of racism," Warrior said. "He
was passed over for promotions. I
saw other men unable to have a
check cashed because they were In
dian. I had a white landlord who
had no hesitation in cheating me
out of my deposit money."
Although the Osage people were
sometimes labeled by non-tribe
members as "lazy" or "good-for
nothing," Warrior said they have
established themselves as an excep
tional tribe. Three members are
Rhodes Scholars, and many are doc
tors, lawyers and educators.
Warrior earned his bachelor's
from Pepperdine University, his
master's at Yale University and his
doctorate in the relationship of reli
gion, politics and literature at
Union Theological Seminary in
New York.
A critical moment in Warrior's
life occurred four years ago when
his only brother died of AIDS.
"After my brother died, it redou
bled my commitment to help fulfill
that need for people to understand
Indians in contemporary exis
tence," Warrior said.
Warrior has been providing such
a fulfillment through Stanford's
Native American programs. In past
years, Native American studies
courses have focused on the litera
ture instead of history.
This quarter, Warrior is teach
ing the first introductory Native
American studies course on cam
pus. He teaches this class to better
serve the interests and needs of the

students, he said.
"This course is appealing to the
overall population of Indians on
campus," said Ferguson. "It's ap
plicable to Indians now and teaches
what Indians are interested in."
Warrior's lectures are much like
his books. They're conducted very
casually, like he's tellinga story. His
relaxed, unpretentious nature
strongly shows through whether
listening to him lecture or talking
with him in his plain office, filled
mostly with shelves and shelves of
books.
"He is intellectually ambitious
but not for personal renown," said
Jay Fliegelman, a fellow English
professor.
"His presence, along with other
programs, make Stanford the best
place for graduate Native American
studies," Fliegelman said. "He's
been extremely successful and pro
ductive. He's a player in the depart
ment in his intellectual presence."
In addition to his academic con
tributions to the Native American
studies program, Warrior provides
a strong presence and is a great
asset to the Native American com
munity on campus, students said.
"Prof. Warrior participates in
the community activities," said Fer
guson, also co-chair of the Stanford
American Indian Organization.
"He has spoken at Indigenous Peo
ple's Day. He makes pancakes for
the pro fros at the breakfasts pro
vided by the Indian staff and facul
ty. He reads papers for the writing
contests, and he goes to the Stan
ford Powwow."
With all his outstanding accom
plishments, Warrior still blends in
with his students and community.
"I think he's been a real strong
force in guiding students through
(the Native American studies pro
gram)," said senior Clay Akiwenzie,
an advisee of Warrior's and a mem
ber of the Ojibway tribe.
