# A
						true Warrior
## English professor brings light to modern Native American history in recent books 
### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
It's hard to believe that 33-year
old Robert Allen Warrior, often
dressed in jeans with his long hair
neatly tied in a ponytail, has already
secured a national reputat ion and is
deemed by a colleague to be the
"best Native American scholar out
there."
Warrior, an assistant professor
in the English Department since
1992, teaches courses in American
and American Indian literature and
intellectual history.
He has written two books. The
first, "Tribal Secrets: Recovering
American Indian Intellectual Tra
ditions," was published in 1995; the
most recent, published this year, is
"Like a Hurricane: The Indian
Movement from Alcatraz to
Wounded Knee."
"I was too young at the time of
these events but curious about
these stories," Warrior said, ex
plaining what convinced him to
write the second book "I'd hear
people talking about events and
movements in a shorthand, but the
stories I'd hear were compressed. I
wanted to give a longer version and
view of the story and give a sense of
what it was like to be there."
In "Like A Hurricane," Warrior
and co-author Paul Chaat Smith re
count nuyor events for contempo
rary Native Americans. The seizure
of Alcatraz in 1969 by Indian ac
tivists, the storming of the Bureau

of Indian Affairs budding in Wash
ington, D.C., in 1972 and the
seizure of Wounded Knee by the
Oglala Sioux in 1973 are all little
documented but significant histori
cal episodes brought to light in War
rior's book.
Warrior met Smith, a Co
manche, in 1990 while he was living
in New York City Smith had read
some of Warrior's work in maga
zines and journals, and a year later,
they decided to cooperate in writing
about the Indian movement of the
1960s and 19705.
The two scholars spent four
years working on the book, trying to
give a narrative of some of the cru
cial events of Native American his
tory from the pcrspect ive of the peo
pie who participated in them
Although Wamor was too young
to be an active contributor to the
movement, Smith was witness to
parts of it.
Working together, they expand
ed the focus of the book. Because of
their age differences and their own
experiences, each had different ref
erence points which made them ask
each other questions.
They also attempted to explain
things so that the information
would be accessible to college stu
dents.
"I really like this book a lot be
cause of its story-telling style of
writing," said senior Patty Fergu
son, member of the Houma tribe
