# Resources key in annual address
## President focuses on finances and physical structure 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
In his annual State of the
University address yesterday,
University President Gerhard
Casper emphasized the need to
watch over and maintain Stan
ford's current resources, in
cluding its endowment and
physical state.
Speaking before a large Kres
ge Auditorium crowd and using
numerous charts and visual
aids, Casper used his address, ti
tled "Say It With Figures," to
focus on four important assets
of the University: people, finan
cial resources, physical struc
ture and reputation.
Stanford's $3.6-million en
dowment was at the forefront of
Casper's concerns. The endow
ment, "while clearly large, is less
than half that of Harvard and
only three-quarters that of Yale
or Princeton," he said. "Com
pared to our competitors, we
have done more with less."
According to Casper, the
challenge is to refrain from
spending this endowment in the
face of belt-tightening in Stan
ford's two main sources of rev
enue — tuition, and government
grants and contracts.
111 the face of constrained rev
enue, Stanford must increasing
ly depend upon self-reliance and
fund-raising mechanisms such
as the Stanford Fund, he said.
"I fear for middle-class and
even upper middle-class families
who do not make enough to pay
the full bill but make too much
to qualify for sufficient financial
aid. In response to that, Stan
ford has tried to restrain tuition
increases," he said.
Casper also stressed the im
portance of keeping up Stan

ford's physical endowment, in
addition to its financial endow
ment.
"As measured by expendi
tures, even adjusted for infla
tion, we are in the most intense
period of construction in the his
tory of Stanford University, in
cluding its founding," he said.
Casper said this construction

was prompted by the demands of
a modern university and the
need for constant upkeep and
renovation.
"Renewing our physical re
sources is one of the key ways in
which, having found the best
possible faculty and students,
we can draw them here and give
them all possible support,"

Casper said.
Regarding people, Casper
reaffirmed the University's ded
ication to excellence through an
examination of several types of
data. He pointed out that in
1995, Stanford led the nation in
the production of doctorates
