# Lawyers accused of 'judge-shopping'

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Gov. Pete Wilson's chief legal
adviser derided a lawsuit chal
lenging Proposition 209 yester
day and accused lawyers in the
suit of "judge-shopping."
Daniel Kolkey, Wilson's legal
affairs secretary, referred to a
request by civil rights attorneys
Wednesday to reassign their case
from conservative U.S. District
Judge Vaughn Walker to liberal
Chief U.S. District Judge Thelton
Henderson.
Henderson has been the judge
in a series of suits challenging a
San Francisco program giving
preference to minorities and
women in city contracts. One
such suit is pending before him.
Plaintiffs in the Prop. 209 suit
contend Henderson should also
hear their case, under court rules
requiring a single judge to handle
all related cases.
"What the plaintiffs are doing
is judge-shopping," Kolkey told
reporters by telephone from
Sacramento. "They apparently
want'a different jud£e'
Attorney Brad Seligman, a
consultant for the plaintiffs in the
case, disagreed. He said the
request to consolidate the suits
before Henderson was filed before
the plaintiffs knew that Walker
had been chosen for the case by
random draw.
"We could have pulled another
liberal judge and that notice of
related case would still have been

filed" as required by court rules,
Seligman said.
He said the main reason the
suit was filed in San Francisco
was that the city's minority con
tracting program, already upheld
by both Henderson and an appel
late court, illustrates one of the
chief points in the case: that "209
stops a city that truly wants to do
good to remedy a (racial) prob
lem."
Henderson has given Attorney
General Dan Lungren's office
until Tuesday to respond to the
request to transfer the suit.
The initiative, approved Tuesday
by 54 percent of the voters, forbids
government preferences or discrimi
nation based on race or gender.
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of
minority and female contractors,
other businesses, labor unions
and students in targeted pro
grams, argued that Prop. 209 is
itself discriminatory.
The measure outlaws prefer
ences for women and minorities
while maintaining them for other
groups — children of ' college
alumni, for example, or veterans
seeking jobs — violating their
right to equal treatment and
access to government, the suit
said.
Kolkey called the argument
"an affront to common sense."
The plaintiffs are arguing, in
effect, that "the state cannot pro
hibit discrimination against all
races,"he said.
