# Shrinking Cabinet
## 
### 
WASHINGTON <AP)
With gaping holes in his staff
and Cabinet, President Clinton
pledged yesterday to "cast a wide
net" for his second-term team,
suggesting that he may land a
Republican or two.
Even as Clinton made the
promise, Transportation Secre
tary Federico Pena told the
White House he was resigning
— making him the fifth Cabinet
secretary who plans to leave.
Three more could announce sim
ilar plans soon, and the presi
dent might lose half his Cabinet.
Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, who formally
resigned in a White House cere
mony yesterday, told The Asso
ciated Press: "The time simply
has come for someone else to
pick up the baton."
Chief of Staff Leon Panetta
will announce his resignation

any day now, and North Caroli
na businessman Erskine Bowles
is the clear front-runner to
replace him. Clinton's decision is
expected soon; aides hoped it
would be made m time for a
news conference today.
Three advisers, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said
Clinton and Bowles discussed
yesterday the prospect of Bowles
taking the job, and the business
man asked to think about it
overnight.
Bowles, former deputy White
House chief of staff, is •ehactant
to replace Panatta —< and is
proposing certain conditions
regarding the sweep of his
authority that may not be
acceptable to Clinton, a senior
official said.
"The price might be too
high," said the aide, who did not
know the precise conditions.

House yesterday after President Bill Clinton announced
Christopher's resignation, which takes effect Jan. 20.
