Sigma Chi punishment
illustrates need for
clearer party policy

SO THERE'S NO more beer
to be served at the Sigma Chi
fraternity house until the
new year. That much is clear.
Unfortunately, that's where the
clarity ends.
It all began that fateful Saturday
night when the fraternity held a
party, which they — kind of —
weren't supposed to hold. It was,
after all, during Orientation.
Granted, freshmen probably
should not be introduced to the fra
ternity system and its infamous
parties on their second day on the
Farm. But there was no written
rule stating such a no-parties limi
tation for the weekend. An oral
warning to the fraternity was sup
posed to suffice.
Step No. 1 toward reaching clar
ity: Next time, the administration
should have written, specific rules
regarding Orientation. Only those
rules — regardless of what they
contain — should be enforced.
Then, due to its lack of obedi
ence, Sigma Chi faced probation.
Their fate rested — sort of — in the
hands of the Greek Judicial Board,
a body composed of students and
Director of the Office of Student
Activities Nanci Howe which was
designed to consider Greek disci
plinary issues.
Obviously, fraternity members
and non-Greek students should be
an active part of this board as they
may often be more in tune with the
activities of the Greek system than
administrators. However, the lone
non-Greek student who was select
ed last year by the ASSU Nomina
tions Commission to serve on the
board — sophomore Ghazal
Badiozamani — said she was not
involved in this recent decision
making process.
Step No. 2 toward reaching clar
ity: Next time, all members of the
board, especially all students,

should be involved in designing the
appropriate probation.
Regardless of the lack of student
participation in the board's meet
ings, conclusions as to an appropri
ate probation for Sigma Chi were
reached. The board suggested that
the fraternity organize a party
planning forum for other fraterni
ties, promise to follow the party
planning guidelines and promote
Safe Van, the fraternity's on-cam
pus safe-ride program.
These suggestions were imple
mented as part of Sigma Chi's pro
bation, but Dean of Students Marc
Wais felt these were not strong
enough. He added that the fraterni
ty may not serve alcohol at any on
or off-campus functions until the
group's social probation ends on
Dec. 31.
While Wais does have the author
ity to change or add to the board's
suggestions and seems to have
thoughtfully discussed the addition
with several other University offi
cials, this addition lessens the
importance of the board and calls
into question the purpose of its exis
tence. Much of the Greek system, as
well as other students, had the
impression that fraternity proba
tions were under the ultimate con
trol of the board, rather than one
member of the administration.
Step No. 3 toward reaching clar
ity: Next time, the power and pur
pose of the board should be clarified
from the beginning.
Neither Sigma Chi's party nor
the resulting probation are really
all that big of a deal in the scheme
of things — so the fraternity threw
a party, and now they can't serve
alcohol for a few weeks. (Most of
their probation falls under Thanks
giving, Dead Week, finals week and
winter break anyway.)
However, with the rocky rela
tionship between the Greek system
and the administration, unclear
rules and probations just serve to
heighten the tension between the
two groups. Perhaps a little clarity
from both sides would help ease the
shared aggravation.
