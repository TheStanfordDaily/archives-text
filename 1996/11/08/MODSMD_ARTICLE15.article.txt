U.S. News editor responds to criticisms of rankings

IN YOUR OCT. 22 editorial ("Rank
ings too powerful"), you declare that
the recent anti-rankings student ini
tiative deserves attention and that U.S.
News would "do well to listen to the crit
icisms and advice of the Stanford stu
dents and University President Gerhard
Casper." We completely agree and have
been following the students' campaign
with great interest. We would like to take
this opportunity, however, to clarify our
position as well as address the argu
ments that have been made to date.
We have no objections to constructive
criticism based on thorough research and
analysis. Indeed, we welcome it. Howev
er, your contention that our rankings are

"idiosyncratic," "deleterious" and "sub
jective" does not meet that criterion.
In fact, from the very beginning our
methodology was developed in coopera
tion with college authorities and research
experts. This month, for example, 18
deans of admission will spend a day and
a half in our offices discussing our
methodology and offering their sugges
tions for its improvement. Similarly,
each year we welcome in our offices
scores of college presidents and deans
who are not shy about suggesting ways
to change the way we determine our
rankings.
As a matter of fundamental policy, we
have always taken suggestions like these

seriously, and if they prove relevant and
"do-able," they are incorporated in the
methodology. This is far from "irrespon
sible" or "arbitrary" journalism, as
ASSU Vice President Nick Thompson
has declared.
In a recent letter to our editor Jim
Fallows, Casper made some interesting
and thoughtful comments about our
rankings and methodology. These have
already been the subject of several
lengthy meetings and will certainly be
added to the agenda of our continuing
discussion aimed at finding new ways to
serve our readers.
As for the changes in Stanford policy
to which you, ASSU President Bill Shen

and Thompson object, we think it very
unlikely that they are driven by the U.S.
News rankings. We think your objections
on that score are best addressed to the
Stanford administration and not to U.S.
News.
We pride ourselves on having an open
door and keeping an open mind. We will
take Shen's and Thompson's comments
into account as we develop next year's
survey. Perhaps we can contextualize the
rankings much more effectively than we
have been doing. Certainly, that is an
issue we will be examining.
