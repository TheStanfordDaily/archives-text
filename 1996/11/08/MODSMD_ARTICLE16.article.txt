# Economics professor defends department's relation with students
## 
### 
Your Wednesday editorial ("Free
market principle?") paints a misleading
picture of the Economics Department.
One-time events such as the closing of
the Food Research Institute led the
department to offer fewer undergradu
ate courses than we should. Students
rightfully complained, and the depart
ment added several courses.
Registration-week office hours this
year were not a lot of fun in the depart
ment, if my experience is typical. Stu
dents I like and respect argued forcefully
that the department was serving them
badly. The department's "lackadaisical
support staff" — where did you come up
with that one? — heard even more of
those arguments than faculty and were
important agents for student concerns.
The point is the Economics Department

increased course offerings when stu
dents made their case. The students
were right.
The tone of the editorial is troubling.
It implies that the current relationship
between students and faculty is one of
angry confrontation, and it even encour
ages students to turn to confrontation as
a way to influence faculty, department
and University decision making. This is
a mistake.
First, at the department or individual
faculty level, student visits to faculty or
administrator offices are a far better
mechanism for change. This worked
effectively in the present instance, and it
works generally.
Second, while it is true that the Uni
versity has not yet developed a policy
that effectively puts teaching resources
where students are, your editorial does
not move us toward a sound policy.
Let me expand a bit. Economics has
been doing more than 10 percent of
overall undergraduate teaching at Stan
ford with well less than 1 percent of
total faculty for a very long time. Does

this mean that the University is indif
ferent to student concerns, at least in
its resource allocation rules? I don't
think that is the main cause. Student
pre-professionalism means that a great
many students pick among just a few
majors. This creates congestion prob
lems in the larger majors like eco
nomics. And it leaves the smaller majors
without enough students to be cost
effective. I can't see how polarizing stu
dent / faculty relationships is going to
solve this knotty problem. Should we
ask the University to cut staffing in all
the small majors to add faculty in the
large ones? That would make my work
week a lot easier, and it would mean the
Economics Department could offer the
courses you want in the quarter you
want more frequently, a major concern
of the editorial. But which departments
would you cut? The Department of
Fraud and Waste has already been pret
ty well cleaned out.
You also complain that economics fac
ulty sometimes are active in public poli
cy and thus away from campus. This can

be a problem in the short run. I was in
charge of teaching assignments one
year, and lost two Economics 1 teachers
to the President's Council of Economic
Advisers without much notice. Short
run headache? You bet. Long-run
enrichment of our undergraduate cur
riculum? Absolutely. It would be short
sighted to try to prevent this activity.
This fall's acute shortage of eco
nomics courses and this year's some
what tight course scheduling do raise
real policy issues, just not ones that are
usefully addressed by harangues or by
polarizing student / faculty relations.
One last thing. I'll be team-teaching
an extra course in computer science and
economics in the winter and teaching an
extra course in the Economics Depart
ment in the spring. Neither of these
offerings was on the course list on Sept.
1. Before you insult the staff and my col
leagues again, look me in the eye and tell
me we don't respond to student con
cerns.
