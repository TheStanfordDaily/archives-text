## Partying the Stanford way 
### 
LAST WEEK'S SYNERGY party
was sorely needed. People from all
over campus climbed to the house
to engage in that toughest Stanford activ
ity — living in the moment. Whether they
stayed a few hours and saw old friends or
stayed too long and "saw God," Satur
day's revelers proved that Stanford is
more than just a place to study.
Unfortunately, few Stanford commu
nities have the character needed for a
memorable party. Let's imagine what
would happen if the following Stanford
institutions threw parties based on their
"characters."
Mirrielees party: Guests enter a large
hall full of cubicles. Each partygoer occu
pies his or her own cubicle and blasts his
or her own music. No one needs to leave
the cubicle because each cubicle has its
own bathroom and shower inside of it. No
one talks to anyone else except to borrow
appliances. Occasionally, some athletes
set things on fire.
Lagunita party: At first, partygoers
chat about the courtyard's natural beau
ty. The oaks, the bricks — so peaceful!
Later, most retire to dark corners and
cry.
Suites party: Sorority women com
plain that they never meet anyone "dif
ferent." Then they return to their six
person suite and shut the door. Occasion
ally, some athletes set things on fire.
Roble party: Hundreds line up in
Roble's famed panopticon halls, exactly 4
feet apart from each other. They look

around but say nothing. All are fright
ened by the sheer number of people in the
same, disturbingly long hall. They are
reminded of the hotel in"The Shining."
Later, some seem surprised, remarking
that they "didn't meet anyone."
The Donner party: Fifty freshmen
from east of the Mississippi are led into a
cold lounge filled with snow. There is no
food in the lounge. On the wall is a sign
that reads, "This way to Sacramento."
The arrow on the sign points straight
down. All doors are sealed until spring
quarter.
Florence Moore party: Enthusiastic
resident assistants brainstorm ideas of
"what is special about Flo Mo." Five
hours later, exasperated, all concede that
the only thing special about Florence
Moore is that it is "close to Tresidder."
Later, a lone Res Ed zealot adds that,
because of its newfangled architecture,
Florence Moore is also "easy to get out
of."
Castano party: After playing five min
utes of techno music, the DJ is accosted
by a pre-med who demands that he lower
the volume. The DJ explains that it is Sat
urday night. The pre-med stammers, red
dens and stabs the DJ in the neck with his
model butane molecule.
Toyon party: All guests are divided
into groups of three and asked to socialize
among themselves. Through one-way
mirrors, Stanford psychologists watch to
see which of the three will become "the
unhappy one." Initially, guests marvel at

the quality of Toyon's eating clubs. Better
than food service — and student-run too!
They eat well and enjoy themselves until
the University arrives and forces all
guests to eat food service's "pink fet
tucine."
Gates Building party: Bill Gates greets
a crowd of technophiles happy to finally
be united under one roof. In the distance,
disgruntled humanities professors heckle
Bill, asking why he won't buy them a
building. One lobs an antique copy of
"The Misanthrope," hitting Bill squarely
in the eyeglasses. Bill laughs, joking that
he has 60 pairs of glasses. The humanities
professor, flustered, asks if he can have
his book back.
Post office party: Long lines of guests
file into a room. A large, angry man
behind a counter humiliates each guest,
one by one, in front of all the others. He
orders them to do absurd things, picking
apart their psyches and revealing their
deepest fears until they are reduced to
quivering, whimpering heaps. After each
success, the large man laughs loudly.
Suddenly he produces a shotgun from
behind the counter and kills everyone.
The following week, he receives a pay
raise.

day is a party.
