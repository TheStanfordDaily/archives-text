Students of all levels of computer experi
ence will have the opportunity to increase their
techno-skills starting next Monday with Stan
ford's very first Web Week.
The event, which runs through next Friday,
is aimed at "educating the Stanford communi
ty about the World Wide Web, what it is and
how it works," said Web Week Planning Com
mittee Chair Sarah Imbach.
The workshops will cover a variety of Web
related topics and are offered at beginning and
intermediate levels.
"For first-time users who are interested in

finding out more about the Web, we have in
cluded several introductory seminars and ses
sions," said Imbach.
Entrepreneurial Web users will benefit
from sessions such as "Using the Web to Find
a Job" and "Starting Your Own Web Busi
ness." Other experienced members of the Web
community can check out "Enhancing Your
Web Pages Workshop" and "Using Your
IMAGE-nation: Graphics on the Web," along
with numerous other options.
Residence drop-in sessions will be featured
from 6:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through
Thursday at the various dorm clusters. These
individualized sessions will cover everything
from Web-related societal issues to creating a

home page.
Faculty and staff members who want learn
how to put up a Web site or teach a class
through the Web will also benefit from the
week-long extravaganza of guest speakers, ses
sions and presentations, Imbach added.
Ambitious Web page owners can submit
their handiwork to be judged in Web design
contests under the categories of Best Personal
Page, Best Department Page, Best Organiza
tion Page and Best Class Page. Web Week will
also be a chance to "acknowledge great Stan
ford sites," Imbach said.
The events of Web Week are free for Stan-
lord faculty, staff and students,
but preregistration is required for
the individual sessions. Access to
registration, class descriptions,
contest submissions and a sched
ule of events is available from the
