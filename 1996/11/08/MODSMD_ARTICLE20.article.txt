## Men's soccer blows out the competition 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
The men's soccer team continued its
excellent play yesterday by handily
defeating the St. Mary's Gaels on the
road 5-1. The victory improved the
Cardinal record to 9-4-4 and kept its
three-game winning streak alive.
Stanford began the scoring early in
the first half when junior midfielder
Shan Gaw converted on a penalty kick.
The Gaels were able to counter later in
the half when junior forward Michael
Weinstein slid the ball by Stanford
senior keeper Ryan Craig. The Gaels
played even with the Cardinal for the
remainder of the half, leaving the score
tied 1-1 at intermission.
Despite the field being muddy and
messy from a season of wear, the Car
dinal was able to get it together in the
second half and dominate St. Mary's on
the Gael turf.
The scoring began just minutes into
the second half when sophomore mid
fielder A.J. Sauer was taken down from
behind in the box, earning Stanford a
penalty kick. Sophomore midfielder
Jamie Clark blasted the penalty kick
into back of the net past the diving
Gael goalkeeper. Minutes later Clark
got into the action again, looping the
ball from about 20 yards out into the
lower right corner.
"All I remember was winning a tack
le about 20 yards out," Clark said.
"The ball just bent around the keeper
and luckily went into the net."
The Cardinal scored again when
Gaw sent a beautiful corner kick near
post, finding the head of sophomore
striker Adam Siegman. Siegman scored
his second goal of the day when he was
able to control a cross by senior for
ward Erik Morrison and deposit the
ball in the back of the net.
"I was just in the right place at the
right time today," Siegman said. "I
think it was the back four who really

set the tempo of this game, Brad Davies
and Dan Wytock in particular."
With its fourth victory in a row,
Stanford is doing everything in its
power to convince the NCAA selection
committee to give the Cardinal its first
bid to the tourney in four years.
"Our goal at the beginning of the
season was to have the games at the
end of the season mean something,"
Siegman said. "These games will clear
ly decide our fate with the tournament,
making Sunday's game a must, must
win against Santa Clara."
Santa Clara will need the victory
against Stanford, however, to secure a
position in the NCAA tournament as
well. The Broncos (8-3-3, 4-1 West
Coast Conference) are now once again
ranked, holding steady at No. 25.
The Broncos also bring to Stanford
their impressive 5-1-2 road record.
Like the Cardinal, Santa Clara is play
ing solid soccer, having won five of its
last six games since the return of goal
keeper Joe Cannon. Since his return,
Cannon has been phenomenal in goal,
allowing just .60 goals per game.
Santa Clara does not have any
superstars but is a solid team that
plays unselfish offense and smart
defense. In fact, the last eight goals for
the Broncos have been scored by eight
different players, and only one player,
junior midfielder Derrick Harris, has
scored more than one goal since the
month of October.
In a preseason exhibition game on
Aug. 24, Stanford defeated the Broncos
by a narrow 1-0 margin. However, this
game is not preseason and, though it
may be a warmup for later games, it
can probably only be a warmup for one
team. In other words, if Stanford wins,
it may go to the tourney. If the Card
loses, it's the end of the season.
"Playing a game like this one
against Santa Clara is what we all live
for," Morrison said. "This is what it's
all about."
