## Volleyball looks to crush Beavers, Ducks 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
(19-2, 11-1 Pacific 10 Conference) will
return to its conference schedule by host
ing Oregon (8-15, 2-11) tonight at 7 p.m.
and Oregon State (16-8, 5-8) noon Sunday
at Maples Pavilion.
The last time the Cardinal faced the
Ducks the young Oregon team struggled to
get going. The Ducks dropped the first two
games in Eugene, losing to Stanford 15-4
and 15-2 while hitting a paltry minus
.oB9, compared to the Cardinal's .533
mark. However, Oregon showed signs of
life in the third game, beating Stanford 15-
9, before eventually losing the match in
four games.
"I think at this point in time everyone is
trying to do the best they can," Stanford
coach Don Shaw said. "Oregon is a pro
gram that wants to get better, and they
will give a strong effort."
Although the Ducks no longer have a
chance to qualify for the NCAA tourna
ment, Oregon State still does. At the
beginning of the season, the Beavers
appeared ready to emerge as one of the
nation's elite teams, winning 13 of their
first 14 matches and earning a ranking in
the top 25.
However, by the time the Cardinal visit
ed Corvallis to face the Beavers for the

first time this season, Oregon State had
started to slip, a trend that has continued
since then. The unranked Beavers now
reside in seventh place in the Pac-10 and
will need an exceptionally strong run at
the end of the 1996 campaign if it wants to
continue playing in the postseason.
Oregon State "has lost some matches
lately and is on the brink," Shaw said.
"They can't afford to lose."
The Cardinal on the other hand, is com
ing off one of its biggest wins of the sea
son, defeating then-No. 1 Hawaii. After
losing the first game 15-5, Stanford
stormed back and clobbered the Rainbows
in the next three games.
Despite playing the top-ranked team in
the nation in front of more than 10,000
people last week, the Cardinal players do
not expect a letdown.
"I don't think there will be a letdown,"
said junior outside hitter Kristin Folkl. "If
anything, we are more focused now. The
win against Hawaii just gave us more con
fidence that we are capable of beating top
teams."
Stanford will continue to work on its
blocking tactics, focusing on the opposi
tion's key hitters. Both players and coach
es realize that in the Pac-10, anything can
happen.
"They will be fired up and ready for us,"
Folkl said. "It is coming down to crunch
time now."
