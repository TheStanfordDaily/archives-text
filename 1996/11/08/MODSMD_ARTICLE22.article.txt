# Women win the home closer
## Soccer knocks off Sacramento State 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
It was a happy send-off for the seven seniors who
may have played in their last home game yesterday
afternoon.
The Cardinal women's soccer team (12-7, 6-0
Pacific 10 Conference) absolutely dismantled an
overmatched Sacramento State squad (7-11-2) 3-1
on Maloney Field.
The game wasn't even as close as the score sug
gests. Stanford controlled the ball for nearly the
entire game, and only rarely did the Hornets carry
the ball into the Cardinal defensive half of the field.
Sacramento State's only goal came with less than 2
minutes remaining in a game that was decided much
earlier.
Stanford, which started all seven of its seniors,
set the tone for the game and asserted its dominance
very early on, taking lots of shots and creating many
opportunities. But, despite excellent play, the Cardi
nal failed to finish any of its chances in the first 30
minutes of the half.
Finally, after senior forward and team co-captain
Emily Burt was fouled, fellow senior Erin Martin
nailed a free kick from about 20 yards out into the
upper left corner of the cage. Hornets goalie Stacy
Himes never had a chance.
"I had taken a shot similar to that one a week
ago," Martin said. "That one missed just outside,
and I wanted to be sure I put this one on the goal."
She did and the score "had a calming effect on the
whole team," Swanson said. "That goal definitely
settled us down, and I think we started relaxing and
playing better after that."
While they may have been calmer and more
relaxed with the lead, Stanford players came out
with a lot of fire in the second half. Less than 10
minutes in, Burt beat a Hornet defender down the
right side and perfectly centered a ball to a streaking
Martin in the middle of the goal box. Martin scored
her second of the day by heading Burt's cross past
the outstretched arms of Himes.
Later on in the half, Martin and Burt hooked up
again for a goal. This time Martin played Burt a ball

to her feet out of the midfield.
Burt took the pass and beat two
defenders before slotting the ball
into the left side-netting for Stan
ford's third and final goal.
"I knew this was the last time
I would get to play in front of
Stanford fans, so I wanted to
have a good game," said Martin,
who now leads the Cardinal with
17 points (six goals, five assists).
"I'm glad I had an impact on a
win."
"I feel really good about the
game, but it is a little sad having
maybe played for the last time
here," said Burt, who because she
took last season off has one more
year of eligibility and could play
for the Cardinal again next sea
son. "It's especially sad to know
that I don't have many games left
with the girls in my class."
Burt wasn't the only nostalgic
senior after the game. Suzie
Boots, who has played 68 games
in a Cardinal uniform, said, "I
can't believe it's almost over. I
guess I have had my time, but I'm
definitely a little sad."
Martin shared Boots' disbelief.
"It only started hitting me today
that there really isn't much time
left," said the third all-time lead
ing scorer in Stanford history.
"You never think that you're
going to be the one walking off
the field with a flower (all seniors
were given a rose at the game's
conclusion). I guess I never
thought I'd actually be playing in
my last game at Stanford. But
here I am."
Swanson said he was glad to be
able to play all of the seniors in
their final home stand.
"These girls have done so
much for the program," he said.
"As a class they deserve a lot of
credit. They've enhanced the pro
gram, and most of all they've left
a very high standard for others to
follow in the coming years."
The home season is over, but
Stanford has the most important
part of its season coming up and

players are well aware of that.
The team travels to Cal on Sun
day, and while the Card have
locked up the Pac-10 champi
onship and a berth into the
NCAA tournament already, "Big
Game" is still just that, a big
game.
Cal (12-3-2, 4-2 Pac-10) is
coming off a 0-0 tie to Santa
Clara, the No. 6 team in the coun
try. Cal, ranked 25th nationally,
is also ahead of the Cardinal in
the regional rankings, so Sun
day's game could play a signifi
cant factor in terms of the NCAA
tourney seedings. A win would
increase Stanford's chances of
playing a home game in the early
rounds.
"Cal works hard and plays
very tough," Swanson said. "This
should be an exciting soccer
game. We have similar styles of
play, and this is, literally, a big
game."
Cal coach Andy Bonchonsky, a
friend of Swanson's, said, "It's
Cal-Stanford, that's all there is to
it. This is the biggest game of the
year, and I'm just looking for
ward to getting Steve (who is in
his first season at the helm of the
Cardinal) involved."
The game is also important in
terms of momentum going into
the postseason. Stanford is ridinp
its longest winning streak of th( j
year at five games, and many
players say that the team's confi
dence is at an all-time high.
"This game is really important
for our confidence and momen
turn," Burt said.
"We have a lot of momentum
and I feel very confident
into Sunday's game," Swanson
said. "There's no reason to fee
anything else. I'm not overconfi
dent because I've seen Cal pla}
and they are a very good team
but I think we will do well."
The Cal game is at 1 p.m. Sun
day in Berkeley. On Monday, th»
NCAA tournament committe<
will announce the field, seeding:
and sites for the 1996 tourney
The Final Four will be at Sant?

It was a happy send-off for the seven seniors who
may have played in their last home game yesterday
afternoon.
The Cardinal women's soccer team (12-7, 6-0
Pacific 10 Conference) absolutely dismantled an
overmatched Sacramento State squad (7-11-2) 3-1
on Maloney Field.
The game wasn't even as close as the score sug
gests. Stanford controlled the ball for nearly the
entire game, and only rarely did the Hornets carry
the ball into the Cardinal defensive half of the field.
Sacramento State's only goal came with less than 2
minutes remaining in a game that was decided much
earlier.
Stanford, which started all seven of its seniors,
set the tone for the game and asserted its dominance
very early on, taking lots of shots and creating many
opportunities. But, despite excellent play, the Cardi
nal failed to finish any of its chances in the first 30
minutes of the half.
Finally, after senior forward and team co-captain
Emily Burt was fouled, fellow senior Erin Martin
nailed a free kick from about 20 yards out into the
upper left corner of the cage. Hornets goalie Stacy
Himes never had a chance.
"I had taken a shot similar to that one a week
ago," Martin said. "That one missed just outside,
and I wanted to be sure I put this one on the goal."
She did and the score "had a calming effect on the
whole team," Swanson said. "That goal definitely
settled us down, and I think we started relaxing and
playing better after that."
While they may have been calmer and more
relaxed with the lead, Stanford players came out
with a lot of fire in the second half. Less than 10
minutes in, Burt beat a Hornet defender down the
right side and perfectly centered a ball to a streaking
Martin in the middle of the goal box. Martin scored
her second of the day by heading Burt's cross past
the outstretched arms of Himes.
Later on in the half, Martin and Burt hooked up
again for a goal. This time Martin played Burt a ball

to her feet out of the midfield.
Burt took the pass and beat two
defenders before slotting the ball
into the left side-netting for Stan
ford's third and final goal.
"I knew this was the last time
I would get to play in front of
Stanford fans, so I wanted to
have a good game," said Martin,
who now leads the Cardinal with
17 points (six goals, five assists).
"I'm glad I had an impact on a
win."
"I feel really good about the
game, but it is a little sad having
maybe played for the last time
here," said Burt, who because she
took last season off has one more
year of eligibility and could play
for the Cardinal again next sea
son. "It's especially sad to know
that I don't have many games left
with the girls in my class."
Burt wasn't the only nostalgic
senior after the game. Suzie
Boots, who has played 68 games
in a Cardinal uniform, said, "I
can't believe it's almost over. I
guess I have had my time, but I'm
definitely a little sad."
Martin shared Boots' disbelief.
"It only started hitting me today
that there really isn't much time
left," said the third all-time lead
ing scorer in Stanford history.
"You never think that you're
going to be the one walking off
the field with a flower (all seniors
were given a rose at the game's
conclusion). I guess I never
thought I'd actually be playing in
my last game at Stanford. But
here I am."
Swanson said he was glad to be
able to play all of the seniors in
their final home stand.
"These girls have done so
much for the program," he said.
"As a class they deserve a lot of
credit. They've enhanced the pro
gram, and most of all they've left
a very high standard for others to
follow in the coming years."
The home season is over, but
Stanford has the most important
part of its season coming up and

players are well aware of that.
The team travels to Cal on Sun
day, and while the Card have
locked up the Pac-10 champi
onship and a berth into the
NCAA tournament already, "Big
Game" is still just that, a big
game.
Cal (12-3-2, 4-2 Pac-10) is
coming off a 0-0 tie to Santa
Clara, the No. 6 team in the coun
try. Cal, ranked 25th nationally,
is also ahead of the Cardinal in
the regional rankings, so Sun
day's game could play a signifi
cant factor in terms of the NCAA
tourney seedings. A win would
increase Stanford's chances of
playing a home game in the early
rounds.
"Cal works hard and plays
very tough," Swanson said. "This
should be an exciting soccer
game. We have similar styles of
play, and this is, literally, a big
game."
Cal coach Andy Bonchonsky, a
friend of Swanson's, said, "It's
Cal-Stanford, that's all there is to
it. This is the biggest game of the
year, and I'm just looking for
ward to getting Steve (who is in
his first season at the helm of the
Cardinal) involved."
The game is also important in
terms of momentum going into
the postseason. Stanford is ridinp
its longest winning streak of th( j
year at five games, and many
players say that the team's confi
dence is at an all-time high.
"This game is really important
for our confidence and momen

said. "There's no reason to fee
