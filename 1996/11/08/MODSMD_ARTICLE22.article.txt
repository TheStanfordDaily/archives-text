# Women win the home closer
## Soccer knocks off Sacramento State 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
It was a happy send-off for the seven seniors who
may have played in their last home game yesterday
afternoon.
The Cardinal women's soccer team (12-7, 6-0
Pacific 10 Conference) absolutely dismantled an
overmatched Sacramento State squad (7-11-2) 3-1
on Maloney Field.
The game wasn't even as close as the score sug
gests. Stanford controlled the ball for nearly the
entire game, and only rarely did the Hornets carry
the ball into the Cardinal defensive half of the field.
Sacramento State's only goal came with less than 2
minutes remaining in a game that was decided much
earlier.
Stanford, which started all seven of its seniors,
set the tone for the game and asserted its dominance
very early on, taking lots of shots and creating many
opportunities. But, despite excellent play, the Cardi
nal failed to finish any of its chances in the first 30
minutes of the half.
Finally, after senior forward and team co-captain
Emily Burt was fouled, fellow senior Erin Martin
nailed a free kick from about 20 yards out into the
upper left corner of the cage. Hornets goalie Stacy
Himes never had a chance.
"I had taken a shot similar to that one a week
ago," Martin said. "That one missed just outside,
and I wanted to be sure I put this one on the goal."
She did and the score "had a calming effect on the
whole team," Swanson said. "That goal definitely
settled us down, and I think we started relaxing and
playing better after that."
While they may have been calmer and more
relaxed with the lead, Stanford players came out
with a lot of fire in the second half. Less than 10
minutes in, Burt beat a Hornet defender down the
right side and perfectly centered a ball to a streaking
Martin in the middle of the goal box. Martin scored
her second of the day by heading Burt's cross past
the outstretched arms of Himes.
Later on in the half, Martin and Burt hooked up
again for a goal. This time Martin played Burt a ball
