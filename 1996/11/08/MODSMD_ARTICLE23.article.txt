## Football faces USC in night game 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Stanford football looks to make it two
in a row over its Southern California
rivals as the USC Trojans come to town
for a rare night game at Stanford Stadi
um tomorrow.
After shocking UCLA on the road last
weekend, the Cardinal (3-5 overall, 2-3
Pacific 10 Conference) has the opportuni
ty to even up its conference record and
inch closer to getting back in the hunt for
a bowl bid with a win over USC.
The Trojans (5-4,3-3) are reeling after
a 21-10 loss to Washington last week.
USC now needs to take two of its last
three games — at Stanford, at UCLA and
at home against Notre Dame — in order
to avoid a bowl-less season for the first
time since 1991 and for just the second
time in 13 years.
"I think we need to win for more per
sonal reasons than that," USC head
coach John Robinson said. "We need to
win just to do the thing right."
After starting the season 3-1, the Tro
jans have dropped three of their last five
games and have fallen into filth place in
the Pac-10. Furthermore, tight end John
Allred, who is tied for second on the
squad with 26 receptions, will likely miss
his second straight start.
"Things aren't very positive right
now," Robinson said. "Our game last Sat
urday was very disappointing to us. It
took us out of contention for any
bowl."
As for the Cardinal, despite two lack

luster losses which virtually took Stan
ford out of bowl contention, Tyrone Will
ingham's squad posted a 21-20 win over
UCLA last Saturday, and suddenly the

Cardinal has restored life.
