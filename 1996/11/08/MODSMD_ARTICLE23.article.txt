## Football faces USC in night game 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Stanford football looks to make it two
in a row over its Southern California
rivals as the USC Trojans come to town
for a rare night game at Stanford Stadi
um tomorrow.
After shocking UCLA on the road last
weekend, the Cardinal (3-5 overall, 2-3
Pacific 10 Conference) has the opportuni
ty to even up its conference record and
inch closer to getting back in the hunt for
a bowl bid with a win over USC.
The Trojans (5-4,3-3) are reeling after
a 21-10 loss to Washington last week.
USC now needs to take two of its last
three games — at Stanford, at UCLA and
at home against Notre Dame — in order
to avoid a bowl-less season for the first
time since 1991 and for just the second
time in 13 years.
"I think we need to win for more per
sonal reasons than that," USC head
coach John Robinson said. "We need to
win just to do the thing right."
After starting the season 3-1, the Tro
jans have dropped three of their last five
games and have fallen into filth place in
the Pac-10. Furthermore, tight end John
Allred, who is tied for second on the
squad with 26 receptions, will likely miss
his second straight start.
"Things aren't very positive right
now," Robinson said. "Our game last Sat
urday was very disappointing to us. It
took us out of contention for any
bowl."
As for the Cardinal, despite two lack

luster losses which virtually took Stan
ford out of bowl contention, Tyrone Will
ingham's squad posted a 21-20 win over
UCLA last Saturday, and suddenly the

Cardinal has restored life.
"I think there are a lot of things we can

carry over from that ball game —
the way we finished the ball game,
the way we played 60 minutes,"
coach Willingham said. "I think a
win over a Southern California
school is a big thing in the Stanford
community. We want it to be."
Still, Stanford is trying to main
tain a one-game-at-a-time mentali
ty.
"There is some talk about the
big picture," said junior defensive
end Kailee Wong. "But we're really
trying to focus on one game
because I think that is one thing
that hurt us early on. We were
looking at the big picture, and we
overlooked certain opponents. So
now we just want to beat USC."
The Stanford offense finally
broke out of its doldrums last week
with the pressure on. Down 20-14
with just more than 5 minutes left
in the game, sophomore quarter
back Chad Hutchinson and the
Cardinal offense marched 80 yards
down the field for the necessary
touchdown.
The squad is hoping that the
drive is a symbol of an offensive
turnaround.
"I think that last drive was
something we can build on," said
sophomore flanker Troy Walters,
who had eight catches for 144
yards and a touchdown against
UCLA. "We needed seven points,
and we went and got it. So this
week in practice we can look at that

and say we're on the right track. If
we just continue to execute and
play like we did on that last drive,
we'll be all right."
Despite the success under pres
sure last week against UCLA, the
offense still has plenty of room for
improvement. The Bruin defense
held Stanford to just 26 net yards
rushing, and the offensive line
allowed five sacks. In fact, outside
of the final drive, Hutchinson was
under heavy duress all afternoon
against the Bruins.
"The thing that we've got to do
is obvious," Willingham said. "We
have got to protect better. That has
been a sore spot with us all year. I
don't think you can tell your quar
terback to suck it up and take some
shots. That's not a real good mes
sage. We have to manufacture the
best we can within our scheme to
give him the maximum protec
tion."
USC will no doubt be bringing
the heat this weekend, especially
from the defensive line. The Tro
jans boast two of the Pac-10's best
tackles in junior Darrell Russell
and senior Matt Keneley. Russell
leads the Trojan defense in sacks
(6) and tackles for losses (14).
Keneley follows with 50 tackles,
seven for losses, and three sacks.
The Trojans get no weaker
behind the line with linebacker
Sammy Knight, who is third in the
Pac-10 in tackles with an average
of 10.3 per game. The USC sec
ondary, which has allowed just
nine touchdown passes this season,
is anchored by cornerback Daylon
McCutcheon (who has three inter

ceptions).
"Their two tackles, Russell arid
Keneley, are outstanding players,"
Willingham said. "They are very
good. Knight and McCutcheon are
very good. The overall defensive
teem is big, physical and active."
On the other side of the ball, the
USC offense has run into the same
problems as the Cardinal. A young
offensive line has led to problems
running the football. Last week
against the Huskies, the Trojan
offense failed to score in the second
half and moved backwards in its
run game with minus-14 total
yards rushing.
"In the second half, our offense
pretty much disappeared on us,"
Robinson said. "It was an even first
half, especially defensively. We
pretty much stopped them, and
they pretty much stopped us. We
thought we had some things that
we could do in the second half, but
we failed miserably at it."
It is no secret that USC will be
out to re-establish its rushing
attack this weekend, and the Car
dinal defense will be expecting it.
"I'm sure they are basically
going to try and run it down our
throats," Wong said. "You know
they are going to try and get their
tailbacks off. That's always been
what USC does. I think we pretty
much know what they are going to
try to do. We just have to go out
and execute and try to stop it."
Willingham is expecting much
of the same from the Trojan attack.
"I will anticipate that they will
be trying to do what USC is known
for, which is get their running

game back in gear," Willingham
said. "Any time that is something
they are demanding of themselves,
that makes it awful difficult for
their opponent. So we will have to
be at our best defensively."
In a similar situation last week
against the Pac-10 co-leader in
scoring, running back Skip Hicks,
the Cardinal defense held Hicks to
just one score and 97 yards rush
ing.
Last season, the Cardinal made
a strong upset bid against USC in
the Coliseum by jumping out to a
16-0 lead in the first half, but a late
touchdown by USC receiver
Keyshawn Johnson put the Tro
jans over the edge 31-30.
"I don't think we are necessarily
looking at last year," Wong said.
"But there is a lot of motivation to
beat USC. I have not beaten them
since I've been here and a lot of the
older guys have never beaten them,
so we always get up to play USC."
As for the night-game format,
the Cardinal doesn't seem to be
concerned about the adjustment.
"It'll be crazy," Wong said. "I
love playing at night; I wish we
could play all of our games at night.
It's kind of like being back in the
high school days."
Stanford last beat USC in 1992,
and the Trojans lead the overall
series 51-20-3.
Prior to the 7:15 p.m. kickoff, all
Sixth Man Club members should
drop by Maples Pavilion to get a
first, look at the 1996-97 men's
hoops squad in action. The all-out
scrimmage begins at 4:15 p.m. and
will run approximately two hours.

jans over the edge 31-30.
"I don't think we are necessarily
looking at last year," Wong said.
"But there is a lot of motivation to
beat USC. I have not beaten them
since I've been here and a lot of the
older guys have never beaten them,
so we always get up to play USC."
As for the night-game format,
the Cardinal doesn't seem to be
concerned about the adjustment.
"It'll be crazy," Wong said. "I
love playing at night; I wish we
could play all of our games at night.
It's kind of like being back in the
high school days."
Stanford last beat USC in 1992,
and the Trojans lead the overall
series 51-20-3.
Prior to the 7:15 p.m. kickoff, all
Sixth Man Club members should

will run approximately two hours.
Stanford football looks to make it two
in a row over its Southern California
rivals as the USC Trojans come to town
for a rare night game at Stanford Stadi
um tomorrow.
After shocking UCLA on the road last
weekend, the Cardinal (3-5 overall, 2-3
Pacific 10 Conference) has the opportuni
ty to even up its conference record and
inch closer to getting back in the hunt for
a bowl bid with a win over USC.
The Trojans (5-4,3-3) are reeling after
a 21-10 loss to Washington last week.
USC now needs to take two of its last
three games — at Stanford, at UCLA and
at home against Notre Dame — in order
to avoid a bowl-less season for the first
time since 1991 and for just the second
time in 13 years.
"I think we need to win for more per
sonal reasons than that," USC head
coach John Robinson said. "We need to
win just to do the thing right."
After starting the season 3-1, the Tro
jans have dropped three of their last five
games and have fallen into filth place in
the Pac-10. Furthermore, tight end John
Allred, who is tied for second on the
squad with 26 receptions, will likely miss
his second straight start.
"Things aren't very positive right
now," Robinson said. "Our game last Sat
urday was very disappointing to us. It
took us out of contention for any
bowl."
As for the Cardinal, despite two lack

luster losses which virtually took Stan
ford out of bowl contention, Tyrone Will
ingham's squad posted a 21-20 win over
UCLA last Saturday, and suddenly the

Cardinal has restored life.
"I think there are a lot of things we can

against UCLA. The Card faces USC tomorrow night.
carry over from that ball game —
the way we finished the ball game,
the way we played 60 minutes,"
coach Willingham said. "I think a
win over a Southern California
school is a big thing in the Stanford
community. We want it to be."
Still, Stanford is trying to main
tain a one-game-at-a-time mentali
ty.
"There is some talk about the
big picture," said junior defensive
end Kailee Wong. "But we're really
trying to focus on one game
because I think that is one thing
that hurt us early on. We were
looking at the big picture, and we
overlooked certain opponents. So
now we just want to beat USC."
The Stanford offense finally
broke out of its doldrums last week
with the pressure on. Down 20-14
with just more than 5 minutes left
in the game, sophomore quarter
back Chad Hutchinson and the
Cardinal offense marched 80 yards
down the field for the necessary
touchdown.
The squad is hoping that the
drive is a symbol of an offensive
turnaround.
"I think that last drive was
something we can build on," said
sophomore flanker Troy Walters,
who had eight catches for 144
yards and a touchdown against
UCLA. "We needed seven points,
and we went and got it. So this
week in practice we can look at that

and say we're on the right track. If
we just continue to execute and
play like we did on that last drive,
we'll be all right."
Despite the success under pres
sure last week against UCLA, the
offense still has plenty of room for
improvement. The Bruin defense
held Stanford to just 26 net yards
rushing, and the offensive line
allowed five sacks. In fact, outside
of the final drive, Hutchinson was
under heavy duress all afternoon
against the Bruins.
"The thing that we've got to do
is obvious," Willingham said. "We
have got to protect better. That has
been a sore spot with us all year. I
don't think you can tell your quar
terback to suck it up and take some
shots. That's not a real good mes
sage. We have to manufacture the
best we can within our scheme to
give him the maximum protec
tion."
USC will no doubt be bringing
the heat this weekend, especially
from the defensive line. The Tro
jans boast two of the Pac-10's best
tackles in junior Darrell Russell
and senior Matt Keneley. Russell
leads the Trojan defense in sacks
(6) and tackles for losses (14).
Keneley follows with 50 tackles,
seven for losses, and three sacks.
The Trojans get no weaker
behind the line with linebacker
Sammy Knight, who is third in the
Pac-10 in tackles with an average
of 10.3 per game. The USC sec
ondary, which has allowed just
nine touchdown passes this season,
is anchored by cornerback Daylon
McCutcheon (who has three inter

ceptions).
"Their two tackles, Russell arid
Keneley, are outstanding players,"
Willingham said. "They are very
good. Knight and McCutcheon are
very good. The overall defensive
teem is big, physical and active."
On the other side of the ball, the
USC offense has run into the same
problems as the Cardinal. A young
offensive line has led to problems
running the football. Last week
against the Huskies, the Trojan
offense failed to score in the second
half and moved backwards in its
run game with minus-14 total
yards rushing.
"In the second half, our offense
pretty much disappeared on us,"
Robinson said. "It was an even first
half, especially defensively. We
pretty much stopped them, and
they pretty much stopped us. We
thought we had some things that
we could do in the second half, but
we failed miserably at it."
It is no secret that USC will be
out to re-establish its rushing
attack this weekend, and the Car
dinal defense will be expecting it.
"I'm sure they are basically
going to try and run it down our
throats," Wong said. "You know
they are going to try and get their
tailbacks off. That's always been
what USC does. I think we pretty
much know what they are going to
try to do. We just have to go out
and execute and try to stop it."
Willingham is expecting much
of the same from the Trojan attack.
"I will anticipate that they will
be trying to do what USC is known
for, which is get their running

game back in gear," Willingham
said. "Any time that is something
they are demanding of themselves,
that makes it awful difficult for
their opponent. So we will have to
be at our best defensively."
In a similar situation last week
against the Pac-10 co-leader in
scoring, running back Skip Hicks,
the Cardinal defense held Hicks to
just one score and 97 yards rush
ing.
Last season, the Cardinal made
a strong upset bid against USC in
the Coliseum by jumping out to a
16-0 lead in the first half, but a late
touchdown by USC receiver
Keyshawn Johnson put the Tro
jans over the edge 31-30.
"I don't think we are necessarily
looking at last year," Wong said.
"But there is a lot of motivation to
beat USC. I have not beaten them
since I've been here and a lot of the
older guys have never beaten them,
