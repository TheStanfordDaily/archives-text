# Water polo is ready for USC rematch
## 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
Last weekend an exhausted
Stanford men's water polo
squad nearly upset No. 1 USC in
a hard-fought 7-6 loss. Tomor
row at 2 p.m. at deGuerre Pool,
the Cardinal faces USC again in
an all-important Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation game.
With just three weeks remain
ing in the season, seeding for the
MPSF tournament is beginning
to take shape. As it stands, USC
is undefeated in conference play
at 6-0 while the Cardinal owns a
5-1 record. A win tomorrow
would place Stanford in a first
place tie.
The team is excited, and it
should be. The end of last season
marked the graduation of many
key players, while other top
teams retained most of their
stars.
"We lost a lot of players who
played mj\jor roles in our success
in recent years," head coach
Dante Oettamanti said before
the 1996 season began "I would

rank us among the top five in
the nation but moving up will
really be tough. USC, Cal, UCLA
and UC-Irvine return most of
their players from last year
while Pepperdine, Long Beach
and Pacific will also provide stiff
competition."
In that light, what the team
achieved this season was in the
hands of the players. With high
ly experienced and talented
opposition permeating the con
ference, the comparably inexpe
rienced team has had to make
the most out of each opportuni
ty.
Working with intensity in
practice and making every effort
to play as a team rather than as
individuals are the steps that
the Stanford men needed to fol
low this season in order to com
pete with the other top teams.
"We redshirted seven players
last year," Dettamanti said.
"They are all excellent players,
but as of now they have very lit
tle college-level game experi
ence. Juniors and seniors make
up one-third of the team, two

thirds are only freshmen and
sophomores. We are going to
have to gain experience in a
hurry if we are going to be suc
cessful."
Now, two months later, the
squad has achieved nearly every
thing it set out to accomplish.
The players have compensated
for the relative lack of experi
ence by maturing at a phenome
nal pace.
After dropping a game to UC-
Irvine early in the season, the
team proceeded to win nine
straight games, all against top
-10 opponents. They capped the
streak with a rematch victory
against UC-Irvine.
And the Cardinal has contin
ued to improve. After losing
their first two meetings with the
1995 NCAA champion UCLA
Bruins, the squad handed the
Bruins their first conference loss
in two years
Tomorrow the Card has a
shot to knock off the top-ranked
team in the country, and one can
rest assured the squad will give
USC a run for its monev.
