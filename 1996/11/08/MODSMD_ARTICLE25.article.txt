You may not recognize his
face if you saw him. Heck,
he could be sitting next to
you right now, and you wouldn't
even know it.
He's like Paul Harvey. Or
that announcer who shouts
"gooooooaaaaaaaallllllllll" after
every Mexican League soccer
goal. Or anybody else you've
ever heard but not seen.
He's Troy Clardy, the official
voice of Stanford Cardinal foot
ball on KZSU, and this week
he's putting aside the micro
phone in favor of a crystal ball
and ouiji board. Instead of call
ing the game as the events tran
spire, Troy is attempting to call
the game BEFORE it happens
in this week's NCAA football
picks of the week.
By the way, I hope nobody
voted for Ross Perot last Tues
day. I have no qualms with his
politics, but can you believe he
refused to pick the NCAA games
with me while he was on cam
pus? I was snubbed by the little
Texan tike. Ouch. Hooray for
the two-party system.
Don't touch that tuner.
We're officially on the air in
5...4...3...2...1...
Stanford at USC
Perhaps it is appropriate that
on the weekend Stanford plays
the squad from USC my guest
prophet is a young man named
Troy. Puns aside, there is noth
ing funny about the offensive
capabilities of these two teams.
In fact, they are pretty sad. Give
credit to Stanford's passing
game last week, which broke
loose for 268 yards on 22-for-32
passing. But having picked up
only 26 yards on 32 rushes, the
Cardinal will need 13 downs per
series to have any chance at gar
nering a first down on the
ground.
The USC offense smells just

as foul, as Troy points out:
"USC's got no heart and no
offense." You thought a Trojan
was supposed to provide an
assurance of protection in times
of need, right? Wrong. USC's
offensive line provided as much
protection for quarterback Brad
Otton as a steel automobile
airbag. Otton was hounded the
entire game last week and was
sacked seven times for losses of
58 yards.
On defense, Stanford has
been dependable for the most
part. But the Cardinal has given
up more than 60 points in its
last two games. With the excep
tion of the Trojan secondary,
which could be the worst in the
conference, USC will prove to be
a tough barrier for Stanford.
My prediction: If Cardinal
quarterback Chad Hutchinson
can throw for more than 230
yards, Stanford will win. That
will require that Stanford take
advantage of a USC pass
defense that is so slow getting to
receivers it looks like it learned
its coverage tactics from Barney
on crutches.
As easy as it sounds, I
wouldn't put my money on a
Cardinal victory. There is too
much pride in Troy (the school)
to let the prediction of Troy (my
guest prognosticator) come true.

California at Arizona State
Troy and I harbor similar
feelings about the football pro
gram over in Berkeley.
"I thought Cal was the worst
5-1 team in the nation," Troy
said. "Now I think they are the
worst 6-2 team in the nation."

tion 209 rallies down the scum

Troy
Clardy
laden streets of Bezerkeley have
taken the focus off of football,
which is a blessing from heaven for
the Cal squad. Now that the team
has started its fall toward .500, it
probably hopes Bear fans will
remember only the first half of the
season once it's all over.
If Cal did hope to win another
game this season, this weekend is
not the time to expect it. New
coach Steve Mariucci has brought
some new ideas to the Cal pro
gram, and there are institutional
improvements. But most of those
football ideas are about as brilliant
and creative as a submarine screen
door. Besides, those ideas that do
work aren't going to work against

the fourth-ranked team in the
country.

Arizona at Oregon
After starting the season 3-0,
the Ducks have flown south for the
winter. Oregon's defense is a farce,
but its offense can chug out
impressive numbers. Troy recog
nizes that Oregon's faults match
up well with Arizona's shortcom
ings; he thinks the Ducks will win
"only because Oregon has no
defense and Arizona has no
offense."
Unfortunately for the Wildcats,
the Arizona defense is nothing to
write home about either. Against
Cal last week the squad gave up 56
points (coincidentally, the com
bined IQ of the Berkeley squad)

and has shown no signs of bucking
this dubious monkey off its back.
If you happen to see this game
on cable tape-delayed late Saturday
night, feel more than free to pick
up the TV controller and turn back
over to CHIPs.

Washington State at UCLA
I really like the Cougars. I'll
admit it. Washington State is a
quality passing squad (27 for 44
last week for 314 yards) with a
decent ground game. As Troy says,
"WSU doesn't have to run the ball
to win."
UCIJV is a different story. The
Bruins depend on their rush to
win, and as we saw last week they
sometimes need even more than
that.

You know you've hit a season
low when you lose to Stanford at
home. That's exactly what Pasade
na has been dealing with for the
past week. It's a shock. It's like
finding out your wife is leaving you
or your kid is using drugs. It hurts,
but you've got to move on.
I don't think UCLA will be over
it in time to paste together a victo
ry over the Cougars. The pain just
runs too deep.
