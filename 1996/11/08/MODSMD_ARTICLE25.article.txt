You may not recognize his
face if you saw him. Heck,
he could be sitting next to
you right now, and you wouldn't
even know it.
He's like Paul Harvey. Or
that announcer who shouts
"gooooooaaaaaaaallllllllll" after
every Mexican League soccer
goal. Or anybody else you've
ever heard but not seen.
He's Troy Clardy, the official
voice of Stanford Cardinal foot
ball on KZSU, and this week
he's putting aside the micro
phone in favor of a crystal ball
and ouiji board. Instead of call
ing the game as the events tran
spire, Troy is attempting to call
the game BEFORE it happens
in this week's NCAA football
picks of the week.
By the way, I hope nobody
voted for Ross Perot last Tues
day. I have no qualms with his
politics, but can you believe he
refused to pick the NCAA games
with me while he was on cam
pus? I was snubbed by the little
Texan tike. Ouch. Hooray for
the two-party system.
Don't touch that tuner.
We're officially on the air in
5...4...3...2...1...
Stanford at USC
Perhaps it is appropriate that
on the weekend Stanford plays
the squad from USC my guest
prophet is a young man named
Troy. Puns aside, there is noth
ing funny about the offensive
capabilities of these two teams.
In fact, they are pretty sad. Give
credit to Stanford's passing
game last week, which broke
loose for 268 yards on 22-for-32
passing. But having picked up
only 26 yards on 32 rushes, the
Cardinal will need 13 downs per
series to have any chance at gar
nering a first down on the
ground.
The USC offense smells just

as foul, as Troy points out:
"USC's got no heart and no
offense." You thought a Trojan
was supposed to provide an
assurance of protection in times
of need, right? Wrong. USC's
offensive line provided as much
protection for quarterback Brad
Otton as a steel automobile
airbag. Otton was hounded the
entire game last week and was
sacked seven times for losses of
58 yards.
On defense, Stanford has
been dependable for the most
part. But the Cardinal has given
up more than 60 points in its
last two games. With the excep
tion of the Trojan secondary,
which could be the worst in the
conference, USC will prove to be
a tough barrier for Stanford.
My prediction: If Cardinal
quarterback Chad Hutchinson
can throw for more than 230
yards, Stanford will win. That
will require that Stanford take
advantage of a USC pass
defense that is so slow getting to
receivers it looks like it learned
its coverage tactics from Barney
on crutches.
As easy as it sounds, I
wouldn't put my money on a
Cardinal victory. There is too
much pride in Troy (the school)
to let the prediction of Troy (my
guest prognosticator) come true.
Troy: Stanford by 4
Me: USC by 6
California at Arizona State
Troy and I harbor similar
feelings about the football pro
gram over in Berkeley.
"I thought Cal was the worst
5-1 team in the nation," Troy
said. "Now I think they are the
worst 6-2 team in the nation."
I guess all those anti-Proposi
tion 209 rallies down the scum
