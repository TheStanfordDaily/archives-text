# Meade and Zimbaldi take on nationals
## 
### David McGee Contributing writer 
The Stanford sailing team is
looking to fare well from coast to
coast this weekend when it com
petes in the Freshman / Sopho
more and Women's Fall Champi
onships in Marina del Hey,
Calif., hosted by Pepperdine.
The team will also send juniors
John Meade and Danny Zimbaldi
to the Intercollegiate Yacht
Racing Association national sin
gle-handed championships in
Charleston, S.C.
Meade qualified for nationals
by winning the district champi
onship three weeks ago and
thought he would be making the
trip east by himself. Zimbaldi
had placed third in the district,
one place out of qualifying. How
ever, when San Diego State's
Brian Camet, the second-place
finisher, withdrew from nation

als for personal reasons, Zimbal
di was named the replacement.
Meade and Zimbaldi are excit
ed about the opportunity to sail
with each other at the national
championships.
"It's more productive to have
a teammate with you," Zimbaldi
said. "He is there to help tune
and figure things out. A friend
might also give you some
breaks."
"It's a really positive thing,"
Meade said. "It's easier to have a
teammate there; we are always
helping each other out."
Meade will be making his first
appearance at nationals, while
Zimbaldi has been there before.
"I finished seventh last year,"
Zimbaldi said, "But this year I'd
like to do better."
Head coach Steve Bourdow
feels both Meade and Zimbaldi
have a chance to perform well.
"I fully expect them both to

finish in the top half," he said.
"If either makes a good start and
doesn't make mistakes, I'd
expect a finish in the top three."
Competition will be stiff,
though, with some sailors com
ing off Olympic campaigns. Har
vard's Brett Paris and Old
Dominion's John Torguson took
a year off from studies to con
centrate on racing lasers, the
boat of choice at single-handed
events.
"Everyone will be real tough,"
Meade said. "But I think I'm one
of those tough people too."
Sailing at Charleston provides
many challenges in itself. There
are three different rivers that
empty into the harbor where the
sailing takes place. The harbor
then empties into the ocean,
making the current troublesome
to many sailors.
"I don't know what to
expect," Zimbaldi said. "Every

one says it's like sailing in a toi
let bowl."
The rest of the Stanford sail
ing team will be concentrating
on the Freshman / Sophomore
and Women's Fall Champi
onships in Marina del Rey.
The regatta consists of two
divisions: one for first- and sec
ond-year sailors and the other
for women. It is not a major
event, but Bourdow still expects
a strong performance.
"I think we'll dominate for
sure," he said.
Stanford senior Alice Manard
is coming off a second-place fin
ish in the national women's sin
gle-handed championships two
weeks ago and is a favorite in the
women's division.
"Alice is definitely the top
woman out there," said fresh
man Anika Leerssen. "Sailing
against her will be a learning
experience."
