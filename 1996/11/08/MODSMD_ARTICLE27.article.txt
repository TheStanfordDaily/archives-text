# Tennis faces regional competition
## 
### Jennifer Splansky 
This weekend, the Stanford
men's tennis team looks to contin
ue its reign over the Northern Cal
ifornia Intercollegiate Champi
onship at Berkeley. The No. 1 Card
has won this tournament's team
title eight years in a row, the sin
gles championship three years run
ning and the doubles champi
onship the past six years.
Leading this year's squad into
the tournament are sophomore
Ryan Wolters, senior Grant Elliott
and freshman Bob Bryan. Stanford
is sending 10 players to compete in
singles play and will enter four
doubles pairs into the doubles com
petition.
"This is a nice event to have at
this time of year," said head coach
Dick Gould. "It is the first chance
to get a full team in competition."
Stanford will be playing without
last year's singles champion and
two-time defending doubles cham
pion, junior Paul Goldstein.
Goldstein will not be participat
ing in the tournament due to a
family engagement. As Goldstein
will be unable to defend his title,
the door is open for other members
of the Cardinal squad to uphold
Stanford's tradition of excellence.
"Last year I had a good tourna

ment, but I lost to Paul [Goldstein]
in the finals," Wolters said. "We
also have a lot of good guys on our
team this year."
Aside from members of their

own squad, Stanford's main com
petition is expected to come from
the states of Washington and Cali
fornia. All Division I schools in
Northern California, Oregon and
Washington are entered in the
tournament.
Stanford freshman Mike Bryan
will be unable to participate in the
tournament because of tendonitis
in his wrist. Due to this withdraw
al, Bob Bryan and Wolters will be
Stanford's No. 1 doubles entry, as
well as the top seed in the doubles
tournament. Aside from the
French Open and Wimbeldon this
past summer when Bob Bryan
competed with Stanford teammate
freshman Geoff Abrams, his only

partner since age 6 has been his
brother Mike.
"It will be different playing with
Ryan [Wolters]," said Bob Bryan.
"My brother and I don't need sig
nals when we play, we just know.
With Ryan it is more uncomfort
able, but we have played well in
practice matches."
Juniors Misha Palecek, Charles
Hollever and Ross Inouye, fresh
men David Hauser and Vijay
Sekhon and sophomore Aleem
Choudhry are also representing
the Cardinal in the tournament.
The four doubles pairs competing
for Stanford are Wolters and Bob
Bryan, Abrams and Elliot, Palecek
and Hollever, and Hauser and
Sekhon.
Aside from being the most pres
tigious tournament of the West,
the Northern California Intercolle
giate Championship also acts as a
qualifying tournament for the
Rolex Individual Indoor Champi
onship. The winner of the singles
and the winner of the doubles tour
nament automatically qualify to
represent the western region at the
Rolex tournament in February.
"This is not the most important
tournament, but I am really look
ing forward to it and the guys are
looking forward to playing," Gould
said.
