Burglaries occur in grove lots
The grove parking lots, on Lasuen Street between
Arboretum Road and Campus Drive, have been
plagued recently by auto burglaries.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, the burglar or burglars are targeting
Volkswagens because they are relatively easy to
break into and come equipped with quality ra
dios.
Two auto burglaries occurred in the lots on Oct.
28, between approximately 10 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.
Niemeyer said it is likely the burglaries were per
petrated by the same individual because the method
of operation was identical. The rear window of each
automobile was smashed, and the compact disc
audio equipment was stolen.
There will have to be heightened awareness in pa
trolling the parking lots, said Niemeyer. There are no
suspects at this time.
Transient requests audience
A transient who is under a restraining order to
stay off the Stanford campus called the Stanford Po
lice on Oct. 30 and requested an audience with Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper.

According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, permission for the audience was denied.
Thirty-five year-old Michael Wollen-Weber, said
Niemeyer, "had been hanging around campus, act
ing in a bizarre manner, off and on for some time,"
until the restraining order. Currently, he is not al
lowed to step on campus unless given special permis
sion by the Stanford Police.
On Feb. 28, Wollen-Weber was reported for acting
suspiciously at the Center for Integrated Systems
building. Two deputies responded to the call, and
Wollen-Weber reportedly pulled a 14-inch knife on
the female deputy.
Niemeyer said the restraining order on Wollen-
Weber, who "has been in and out of jail," is a result of
this incident. Wollen-Weber was also charged with
carry ing a dangerous weapon and assault with a dan
gerous weapon.
Prior to calling the Stanford Police, Wollen-
Weber reportedly visited a Palo Alto school, deliver
ing a letter and hand-carved wooden toy.
Niemeyer described the contents of the letter as
nonsensical. It seems, said Niemeyer, that Wollen-
Weber is requesting an ordinance somehow related
to Santa Claus and the wooden toy.
