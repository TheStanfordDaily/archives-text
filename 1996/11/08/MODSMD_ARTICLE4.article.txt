# Casper vows no changes in store after 209
## Senate also ponders judicial system 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
University President Gerhard
Casper announced before the Fac
ulty Senate yesterday that Stan
ford's affirmative action policies
would remain unchanged despite
the passage of Proposition 209 on
Tuesday.
The measure, which eliminates
affirmative action in California's
public sector, does not apply to pri
vate institutions.
While Casper did not comment
on the controversial initiative itself,
he did address the affirmative ac
tion issue within the context of Uni
versity policy. He referred to his en
dorsement of affirmative action be
fore the senate last fall and main
tained that the University's posi
tion on the matter will not change.
"The passage of Prop. 209 reaf
firms the importance of freedom of
private universities to choose their
own ideals, standards and goals,"

he said. "Stanford is committed to
pursuing the policies it has had be
fore Prop. 209."
Provost Condoleezza Rice
echoed Casper's sentiments. "We
have the right to determine our
own processes" with regard to ad
mission, tenure and other issues,
she said "Our policies have worked
well for us."
Turning to its main business of
the day, the senate discussed pro
posed revisions to the University's
judicial system.
One of the problems addressed
concerned the lack of public discus
sion about the judicial process. Po
litical Science Prof. David Aber
nethy said he believes students
would take the Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard more seri
ously if they are more aware of the
consequences of violations.
"All judicial affairs are handled
so confidentially that no one ever
knows anything about them," said
Geophysics Prof. Mark Zoback,
chair of the Committee of 15, the
group of faculty and students

charged with reviewing the current
judicial system. He said the student
media report on occurrences such
as convictions so that "at least peo
ple know the judicial system is
working."
Discussion also centered around
the burden of proof issue.
"This issue was handed to us as a

hot potato," Zoback said. "We
would have rather not dealt with it,
but we had to."
He suggested that the student
body be allowed to decide whether
they want to lower the burden of
proof from "beyond a reasonable
doubt" to "clear and convincing."
"Students have to feel a part of

the system," Zoback said. "Discus
sion and debate among the student
body" would accomplish the higher
purpose of educating them on judi
cial affairs, he added.
The ASSU is currently working
on soliciting student opinion on the
matter, said ASSU President Bill
Shen.

Many students view lowering
the burden of proof as increasing
the risk of wrongful convictions,
said Law Prof. Robert Weisberg.
This mindset comes from compar
isons drawn to the existing Univer
sity standard, as opposed to a situa
tion where the policies were being
written from scratch.

"Virtually all other colleges have
lower standards of proof," he said.
"We have to convince people that
there are a fair number of cases
where the guilt is really clear but
can't be legally established under
the high standard because it's too
easy to suggest something is in rea
sonable doubt," he added.
