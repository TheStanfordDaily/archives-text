# Sand Hill project faces tough road
## 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
Debate over Stanford's proposed
Sand Hill Road project may heat up
with the Tuesday election of
Charles Kinney and Paul Collachi
to the Menlo Park City Council.
Both men are opposed to the pro
ject.
Kinney, a 55-year-old archi
tect, and Collachi, a 33-year-old
transportation commission mem
ber and computer engineer, gar
nered the most votes in the four
person race. R.P. "Dee" Tolles, an
incumbent and supporter of the
project, came in third. Kinney and
Collachi received 31 percent and
28 percent of the vote, respective
ly, while Tolles came in a close
third at 23 percent. Harry Harri
son placed last.
The election of Kinney and Col
lachi has led some to believe that
Menlo Park residents are against
the project, which was a major issue
during the campaign and dominat
ed much of the political dialogue
from all candidates.
The Sand Hill Road project was
first proposed by University offi

cials to the Palo Alto Litv Council m
1992. At that time, the council sug
gested that Stanford hold a series of
community meetings and work
shops in both Palo Alto and Menlo
Park.
Last July, a draft environmental
impact report was released for pub
lic comment. Both Kinney and Col
lachi have sawtthey are skeptical of
the project.
"The draft [report] is deficient,"
said Kinney.
Kinney argued for supplement
ing the report so it takes into ac
count other issues, including the
change in noise and air quality from
the additional traffic and the possi
bility of San Francisquito Creek
flooding.
"There are traffic and environ
mental impacts" that must be dealt
with, added Kinney.
Stanford's Government and
Community Relations Director
Larry Horton, however, disagreed.
"We think it's an excellent [re
port]," said Horton, adding that
most comments made against
the project were not completely
accurate.
The $342-million proposed de
velopment along Sand Hill Road
would widen the road and extend it
to El Camino Real. The project in
cludes a 630-unit apartment com
plex, a senior housing development
with 388 condominiums, a health
care center and assisted-living
units, as well as the expansion of the
Stanford Shopping Center. The
project would generate an estimat
ed $1.2 million in tax revenue for
Palo Alto, according to proponents
of the plan.
University planners said the
outcome of the election will not
substantially alter the project.
"Stanford never takes part in
any political campaign by any can

didate for office," said Horton. "We
deal with the results of the elec
tion."
Horton went on to say that Uni
versity planners are "enthusiasti
cally" looking forward to working
with the newly elected officials.
"We warmly congratulate them,"
he said.
People "feel confident in the pro
ject," said Horton. "We've been
meeting with small groups and in
neighborhoods. Generally, people
are supportive of ending the ridicu
lous bottleneck."
The Menlo Park City Council has
scheduled a meeting with the Palo
Alto City Council in December to
discuss the issue. A final vote on the
project is expected to come from the
Palo Alto City Council on Jan. 10.
Speculating that the project will
be approved, Horton said, "We will
be going forward in January and
February."
