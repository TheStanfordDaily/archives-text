Debate over Stanford's proposed
Sand Hill Road project may heat up
with the Tuesday election of
Charles Kinney and Paul Collachi
to the Menlo Park City Council.
Both men are opposed to the pro

Kinney, a 55-year-old archi
tect, and Collachi, a 33-year-old
transportation commission mem
ber and computer engineer, gar
nered the most votes in the four

Park.

lachi have sawtthey are skeptical of

said Kinney.
Kinney argued for supplement

count other issues, including the
change in noise and air quality from
the additional traffic and the possi

flooding.
"There are traffic and environ
mental impacts" that must be dealt
with, added Kinney.
Stanford's Government and
Community Relations Director
Larry Horton, however, disagreed.
"We think it's an excellent [re

most comments made against
the project were not completely
