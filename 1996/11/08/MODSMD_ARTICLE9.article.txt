## Texaco business as usual Stocks stable despite executives' racist remarks 
### 
DALLAS (AP) - Adam Nelson
had heard the talk about racist lan
guage in Texaco's executive suites
before he got to a Dallas Texaco
station yesterday. But he wasn't
angry enough to take his business
elsewhere.
"This is corporate America.
These folks just happened to get
caught on tape," the 26-year-old
black man said as he filled his tank.
At a Mobil station across the
street, Kason Delaney, a 42-year
old black dentist, said he felt forced
to stop buying at Texaco. "I like
Texaco. I don't want to boycott...
but I really feel like they don't

deserve to have my money," he
said.
This week, it was disclosed that
high-level Texaco executives were
captured on tape making racist
remarks about black employees
and talking about destroying docu
ments in a discrimination lawsuit.
The tapes were turned over to one
of the lawyers suing the White
Plains, N.Y.-based company for
discrimination.
A grand jury is investigating
whether the executives illegally
destroyed the documents.
Texaco chairman Peter I. Bijur
issued an apology Wednesday and

announced that two executives
were suspended.
"If they apologized, then I think
we can't hold a grudge," said Her
bert Wright, a 47-year-old black
salesman. "I'm sick of black people
feeling like they have to hold a
grudge forever. God calls us all to
forgive."
He added: "I've called white people
some things I probably wouldn't want
to be caught on tape saying and I
would hope they wouldn't hold it
against me forever."
The company's stock initially
fell about 5 percent after the tapes
became public, though it has since

recovered a bit. Yesterday, share
holders sued Texaco and the four
people recorded on the tape.
But business has shown no
signs of dropping off, employees
said. A Texaco spokesman said the
company could not immediately
characterize sales since the
remarks were reported Monday.
"People come in here talking
about it, but they don't say that
they're not going to come back,"
said one black attendant, who
would identify himself only as
Chris. "This is not something new.
I get called 'nigger' three to four
times a day."
