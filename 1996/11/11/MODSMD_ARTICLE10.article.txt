## India cleans up, searches for missing after cyclone 
### 
AMALAPURAM, India (AP) - At a
makeshift crematorium on the edge of
what remained of a coconut grove,
Guruva Swamy lit a heap of car and
bicycle tires under his father's body.
Firewood is too scarce and expensive
to build proper funeral pyres in this
southern Indian coastal region, where a
cyclone last week killed at least 1,000
people and destroyed homes, crops and
livestock. Another 1,000 people were
missing and presumed dead.
"I know this is terrible," Swamy, 25,
said as he struck the match. "I have
been looking for firewood since Friday,
but I could afford none. Today, one of
my friends told me people are burning
dead bodies with tires.
"I cannot keep my father's dead body
any longer."
Black ash and dark smoke belching
out of other pyres in this fishing town of

50,000 indicated Swamy was not alone.
Rescuers, aided by helicopters and
motorboats, searched the coastal waters
of the Bay of Bengal yesterday for 1,000
missing fishermen.
The men went fishing for shark
before the cyclone's torrential rain and
112-mph wind struck Wednesday. All
are presumed dead.
"We have prayers on our lips, but
hope is surely receding," Phanandra
Reddy, a senior relief official, said of the
missing fishermen.
Coast guard vessels picked up 50 bod
ies Saturday, believed to be some of the
fishermen, and spotted 45 more yester
day.
Relief crews also delivered food,
drinking water and medicine yesterday
to an estimated 500,000 people cut off
by the storm, said A.M. Reddy, a state
government official.
