## Instructors accused of rape also made death threats, report says 
### 
BALTIMORE (AP) - Army
instructors charged with raping and
harassing female recruits at a training
center are also accused of threatening
them — sometimes with death — to
keep quiet.
"I'm going to knock your teeth out
and get away with it," one drill sergeant
told a trainee, according to newly
released Army documents.
Four drill instructors and a captain at
the Army Ordnance Center have been
charged, three with criminal charges
and two on administrative counts. They
and 15 others have been suspended in
the widening investigation.
The five men facing charges, which
range from rape to sending improper
love letters to the trainees, were accused
of harassing at least a dozen women in
their first weeks of training. The average
age of the women was 21.
According to documents detailing
the charges released late Saturday,
one of the defendants, Staff Sgt. Del
mar Simpson, threatened to kill
women if they told anyone he was hav

ing sex with them.
He is accused of grabbing one
woman's hair and jerking her head
back after threatening to knock out her
teeth.
The official charges provided the
most detailed information yet of the alle
gations at the training center, at the
Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground 30
miles northeast of Baltimore.
Maj. Susan Gibson, deputy staff judge
advocate at the post, refused to com
ment on whether any of the defendants
tried to carry out the alleged threats.
Another defendant, Capt. Derrick
Robertson, is accused of trying to dis
charge a female soldier after sexually
assaulting her, the documents said. He
is charged with telling the woman to lie
about their sexual relationship, forcing
her to engage in sodomy and engaging in
an improper sexual relationship with the
soldier.
Sgt. Nathaniel Beach is charged with
defying orders to stay away from
trainees while his conduct was being
investigated, the documents said.

The two instructors facing adminis
trative rather than criminal charges
were not mentioned in the charges
released Saturday, said Ed Stames, a
post spokesman.
The Army is looking into whether
similar incidents occurred at any of its
other installations.
There was no comment yesterday
from military defense lawyers. Chief
Defense Counsel Lt. Col. Wayne Price,
of the Trial Defense Service in Arling
ton, Va., did not answer office calls and
has an unlisted home number.
No charges had been filed against the
additional 15 instructors and drill
sergeants whose suspensions were
announced Saturday.
Army investigators plan to interview
as many as 1,000 women who were
trained at the post since the beginning of
1995.
After the charges were announced
Thursday, the Army set up a hot line for
anyone wanting to report sexual abuse
at the post, and 1,528 calls were received
