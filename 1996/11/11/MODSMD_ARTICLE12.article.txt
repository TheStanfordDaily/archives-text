Why has it taken three
years to study the fire's
effect on salamanders?

IT LOOKS LIKE another Big
Game is going to pass without
a "real" bonfire. Once again,
those pesky tiger salamanders are
keeping Stanford revelers from
fully partaking in the Big Game
experience — at least, the "old"
Big Game experience.
Imagine this: The year is 1992.
The place is Lake Lagunita.
Thousands of students and alum
ni gather at the lake to pay
homage to the Axe and all that is
Stanford and generally feel supe
rior to those slackers across the
Bay. The blaze shoots 300 feet in
the air, burning so hot that the
crowd is forced to back away from
the flames. Welcome to the annu
al pre-game weenie roast.
But, as they say, those were the
good old days.
The last three Novembers have
seen a drastically different pic
ture. In 1993, after the emer
gence of the salamanders, a laser
light show was held in the bon
fire's place. Even the Axe Com
mittee admits that was a mistake.
For the last two years, a small
er version of the bonfire has been
held behind Arrillaga Family
Sports Center. That was
marginally more successful; about
400 people attended last year's
event.
This year the Axe Committee
wants to hold the bonfire on
Wilbur Field. The new venue will
allow for a larger blaze — about
30 feet high — and a more conve
nient location for students,
according to Axe Comm Chair
Jeremy Schreiber.
While the Axe Comm should be
commended for its efforts to
increase the event's appeal, the
new location is a temporary solu
tion at best. The Axe Comm
knows it; everybody knows it.
The only way to truly satisfy the

desires of the Stanford communi
ty is to bring back the "real" bon
fire in Lake Lagunita.
Obviously no one wants to hurt
the salamanders, but really, how
much can an annual fire hurt
them? The University seems to
think they're pretty resilient;
after all, it coughed up around
$15 million to build a new gradu
ate student dormitory smack in
the middle of their habitat. If the
housing project got the green
light go-ahead, why didn't the
bonfire?
According to Schreiber, a two
part study focusing on the habitat
of the salamander must be fin
ished before plans to move the
bonfire back to its original loca
tion can proceed. The first half, a
biological study that charted the
whereabouts and overall popula
tion of the amphibians, was com
pleted this summer. The second
part, a feasibility study that
determines the impact of human
land usage, should be done any
day now.
However, the timing of these
studies is questionable. How can
it take three years to determine if
an annual bonfire will endanger
these poor creatures? What kind
of bureaucracy is this? And who's
responsible for the hold up — is it
the state's Fish and Game
Department or Stanford's Plan
ning Office?
Students are tired of excuses
and promises of "maybe next
year." Seniors won't get another
chance. It's sad that a class will
graduate without ever experienc
ing a true bonfire.
University President Gerhard
Casper is always talking about
the importance of alumni giving
— well, here's a small tip: If you
want to ensure contented, gener
ous alumni, you'd better make
sure you have happy students . . .
and that means a "real" bonfire.
There's no better way to make
students feel a sense of belonging
or to create a true Stanford spir
it.
