## Savoring Halloween's spirit 
### 
Although we're just a cou
ple of weeks away from Thanks
giving's gluttonous turkeyfest,
Hanukkah's eight days of giving, stock
ings full of Christmas cheer and the
inevitable New Year's Eve hookup, I am
sad. You see, my favorite holiday has
already passed.
While most people are rewinding
"Miracle on 34th Street" and buying
ties for their fathers, I sit in solitude,
mourning the passing of Halloween.
Halloween deserves a lot more credit
than it gets. It is one of the few holidays
that all people can celebrate together,
regardless of their national, ethnic or
religious backgrounds. Instead of criti
cizing one another's differences, people
suddenly embrace each other because of
their differences. How many times a
year do you get to see Michael Jackson
doing the Macarena with a spatula and
a werewolf? OK, maybe that's a bad
example.
Not only does Halloween bridge the
differences between people, it erases
them. Through costumes, everyone
achieves a certain level of anonymity.
You can't be sure if the person dressed
as Gene Simmons is your roommate or
a complete stranger, and they can't be
sure who you are. The result of this sit
uation is a completely open social envi
ronment where random people can
interact freely.
Halloween also has an unparalleled
spirit of giving. Normally, the "spirit of

giving" is associated with Christmas â€”
a holiday where you exchange gifts with
only your relatives and close friends.
On Halloween, you give precious candy
treats to anyone who knocks on your
door. The practice of indiscriminate
gift-giving is quite refreshing. You
don't have to worry about which friends
are worthy of receiving your gifts, and
because nobody who gave you candy
was thinking of you specifically, you
don't have to write thank-you notes.
The jack-o'-lantern is another perk
Halloween offers. It combines the vege
tative and decorative aspects of the
Christmas tree with the flammable
aspect of the Menorah to create a
uniquely orange icon. While Christmas
trees reside in stuffy living rooms, jack
o'-lanterns displayed publicly for
everyone's enjoyment. Jack-o'-lanterns
also have the ability to be "cool" where
as the world's greatest Menorah or
Christmas tree can only achieve the sta
tus of being "nice."
There are, of course, those skeptics
who dismiss Halloween as a "Hallmark
holiday," placing it alongside St.
Patrick's Day and Mother's Day on the
depth chart.
But the strong Halloween spirit pre
vails over all of its detractors. This
year, Halloween fell on a Thursday, but
Stanford students freaked out to the
spooky vibe like they were getting cred
it for it.
I was one of only 10 in attendance in

a normally full computer science class.
Later that night, I encountered thou
sands of grown-up ghouls and goblins at
various gatherings around campus.
There were more people out having a
good time on Halloween than there are
on the most boisterous Stanford Friday.
Aye, the spirit of Halloween is not to
be reckoned with. It forces some people
to don wild costumes on lay days for no
apparent reason. Last week, I encoun
tered a spirited soul at Tresidder Union
who was wearing a cranberry-colored
tuxedo. When I approached him to let
him know that Halloween had actually
bean the previous Thursday, he looked
at me disapprovingly and spouted, "Hey
man, you just don't understand. This is
an H thing."
I think I do understand, though. Hal
loween shouldn't be confined to a single
day each year. We should all recognize
and learn to appreciate its customs and
ethics.
Although the pumpkins have rotted
and the costumes have made their way
into the back of our closets, we
shouldn't discard the lessons Hal
loween teaches us.

with his cousin Charlie awaiting the
return of the Great Pumpkin.
