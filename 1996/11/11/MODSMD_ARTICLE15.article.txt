'Stanford 9 s sexiest 9 not the parody it should have been

THE E-MAIL COULD have been a
hoax. Headed "an unusual
request" and asking for my partic
ipation in a photo shoot of "the sexiest
men at Stanford," I laughed when I first
received it. I was uncertain of the motiva
tion of the authors of the message, "We
the editors of Intermission," but they
reassured me that "this is a parody" and
is "meant in good fun."
After speaking with friends who knew
both of the Intermission editors, I accept
ed their request, convinced that the pro
ject was headed by two responsible and
creative individuals who would handle
this "parody" with the proper ironic
touch and, in so doing, reveal the absur
dity of such "sexy" lists.
But this was not the case. While this
initial e-mail was not a hoax, to call this
project "parody" was deceptive. On the
surface the editors certainly referred to it
as parody, but on the Stanford campus,

this bastion of stylish liberalism, these
editors could not have organized a "sexi
est" anything unless it was under the
guise of parody. Calling it parody made
the project feasible. Which is not to say
that the editors called it parody to mask
their true aims. I believe the problem is
in the way that "parody" has come to be
defined in our society, not with any hid
den motivations on the part of the edi
tors.
I have numerous problems with these
lists when made by People and other sim
ilar entertainment magazines, problems
many of you have probably heard
expressed before and with which many of
you might agree. I oppose objectification
through commodification; i.e., the dehu
manizing of individuals by offering their
bodies as incentive for the sale of a maga
zine and for the benefit of shallow enter
tainment. While there has been a long
history of using women for this purpose

(continued to this day on the cover of
almost any magazine), men can just as
easily be used as objects.
Participation in a parody that would
potentially unveil such problems
appeared to be a worthwhile venture.
While still a form of objectification, this
would be in service of an ideal, rather
than for the sale of a magazine.
Unfortunately, I learned upon arriving
at the photo shoot that the editors did
not consider their project critical, in a
sociopolitical sense, but simply an "enter
taining parody." After talking to them
further I learned that what they had in
mind was not a parody at all.
For something to be a parody, it can
not merely replicate its subject exactly,
driven by the same motivations, using
the same standards of evaluation for con
tent, and then simply rename itself. For
example, "People's 50 most beautiful" list
would still be buying into the same false

categories of evaluation even if it began
to refer to itself as "The parody of Peo
ple's 50 most beautiful" list, the content
remaining the same.
No parody occurs in simple replication,
especially not replication which merely
adjusts to satisfy the potential criticisms
of its audience, criticisms that (as parody)
it should be encouraging, not defusing.
To be successful, a parody must manipu
late the genre and cause the foundation
on which it stands to crumble.
Simply taking pictures of men that a
private poll has deemed sexy and then
offering them for public appreciation is
not satire. It is sexism; it is objectifica
tion, and it reinforces the status quo. For
these reasons, I did not participate. An
article about "sexy men" isn't funny; it's
tragic. In retrospect, I might have
laughed had it been a hoax.
