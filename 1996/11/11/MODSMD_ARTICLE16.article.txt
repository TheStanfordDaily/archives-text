# Spray-paint advocacy against Prop. 209 was disservice to the cause
## 
### 
Some overenthusiastic opponents of
Proposition 209 have changed Stanford's
traffic signs into political statements by
spraypainting "209" beneath the word
"Stop." Irrespective of the merits of their
position, I urge these people to clean up
their mess and avoid such acts in the

future. This destructive advertising is inef
fective, counterproductive and ethically
questionable.
Spray-paint advocacy at Stanford can
not possibly be effective. If a person looks
at a "STOP ... 209" sign and says, "Hmm.
That's a cogent argument. I think I'll
change my vote," then he or she is proba
bly at the wrong university.
Spray-paint advocacy is counterproduc
tive. It creates the impression that affirma
tive action advocates are willing to appro
priate and mar public property to maintain
the status quo. This is not the sort of mes

sage a policy proponent should want to
send to law-abiding, civic-minded voters.
Spray painting is ethically questionable.
Since the act is ineffective, counterproduc
tive and destructive, its only available
defense is that it is needed to arouse the
passions of sympathetically inclined but
apathetic voters. This smacks of the "ends
justify the means" excuse that rational
people find abhorrent. If this line of rea
soning is, in fact, valid, then the 209-
sprayers should not be unhappy if The
Stanford Review crowd comes by every
dorm on campus some night and spray

paints "No!" on the door of any room num
bered 210 or 214 through 218.
I suspect that we will see an initiative to
repeal Prop. 209 at the next election, and I
may, in fact, vote for it. But proponents of
such a repeal should take it upon them
selves to clean up the mess that their
enthusiastic but short-sighted comrades
have made around the campus, and they
should resolve to avoid such destructive
behavior in the future.
