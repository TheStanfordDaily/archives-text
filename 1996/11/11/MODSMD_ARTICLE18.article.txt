## Water polo sinks top-ranked USC in pool rematch 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
In last week's matchup
against No. 1 USC, two of
Stanford's starters were miss
ing in action. At the hands of
UCLA the day before, sopho
more forward David Hay suf
fered a dislocated finger, and
redshirt freshman Brian Heif
feron sustained a blow to the
ear. Both players returned
Saturday, and in Trojan-horse
fashion led the Stanford
attack which would ultimately
cause USC's downfall.
Hay exploded for a career
high three goals, while Heif
feron controlled three of the
four swimoffs and scored a
crucial goal, leading the Cardi
nal to an astonishing 11-10
upset.
Stanford improved its
record to 15-5 (6-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation)
while USC dropped to 16-2 (6-
1 MPSF). The victory effec
tively places the Cardinal in a
four-way tie for first place in
the conference. With wins
over USC and UCLA, Stanford
has set itself in excellent posi
tion to be given the top seed in
the MPSF 1 tournament.
"This victory is huge," said
senior Daniel Lehoczky. "We

have beaten all of the top-10
teams, and we are still improv
ing."
Head coach Dante Detta
mnnti is also impressed by
the team's remarkably quick
improvement.
"The good teams come
through in the tough games.
I'm amazed by their improve
ment," Dettamanti said.
"They have grown up pretty
darn fast."
Perhaps the reason that
this young team has matured
at such an rapid pace is the
wealth of senior veterans who
continue to dominate the
opposition.
Senior defender and hole
man Tyrone Miller scored the
first goal of the game to give
the Cardinal the early 1-0 lead
and help build momentum
while playing exceptional
defense throughout the game.
Senior holeman and captain
Brian Wallin — the scoring
leader for the Cardinal — pro
duced a key goal while garner
ing several assists. And
Lehoczky scored two goals of
his own.
Many individuals stood out
at various points in the game,
but the ultimate impetus for
the win proved to be Stanford's
excellent ability to work togeth
er effectively as a team.
In man-up situations (where
a player on the opposing team is
ejected for 20 seconds as a penal
ty) the Cardinal converted to
score on an incredible five of six
opportunities.
The offense also worked well
together in even-strength situa
tions, where the Cardinal capi
talized on nearly all of its scoring
opportunities.
"We beat them as a team,"
Hay said. "Every time we got a
chance to score, someone put it
away."
Stanford also outplayed USC
in the defensive end, holding the
Trojans to just one conversion in
eight man-up opportunities and
causing USC's Marko Zagar,
who victimized the Cardinal for
five goals, to foul out of the game
in the middle of the fourth quar
ter.
Sophomore standout Chris
Aguilera, arguably the best col

lege goalie in the country, clear
ly outplayed USC's cageman,
stopping 15 shots to hold an out
standing Trojan offense to just
10 goals.
Despite the extraordinary
play of the Cardinal, the Trojans
did not surrender quietly. In
fact, the Trojans had several
opportunities offensively to tie
the game as the clock wound
down, but an offensive foul with
just a few seconds remaining
gave Stanford the ball and the
win.
Stanford now looks toward its
final conference matchup, sched
uled for noon Saturday at
deGuerre Pool against sixth
ranked Pacific.
"We need to make sure that
we play well against UOP,"
Wallin said. "They are capable of
beating anyone, so we really
need to play well. Most impor
tantly, we can't have a letdown."
The Waves have proven to be
a worthy opponent for the Cardi
nal this season. In the last meet
ing between the two schools, the
Cardinal orchestrated an amaz
ing comeback to beat UOP in
double overtime 13-11.
