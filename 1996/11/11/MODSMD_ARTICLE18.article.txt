## Water polo sinks top-ranked USC in pool rematch 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
In last week's matchup
against No. 1 USC, two of
Stanford's starters were miss
ing in action. At the hands of
UCLA the day before, sopho
more forward David Hay suf
fered a dislocated finger, and
redshirt freshman Brian Heif
feron sustained a blow to the
ear. Both players returned
Saturday, and in Trojan-horse
fashion led the Stanford
attack which would ultimately
cause USC's downfall.
Hay exploded for a career
high three goals, while Heif
feron controlled three of the
four swimoffs and scored a
crucial goal, leading the Cardi

upset.
Stanford improved its
record to 15-5 (6-1 Mountain

four-way tie for first place in
the conference. With wins
over USC and UCLA, Stanford
has set itself in excellent posi

the MPSF 1 tournament.

senior Daniel Lehoczky. "We

have beaten all of the top-10

Head coach Dante Detta

the team's remarkably quick
improvement.
"The good teams come
through in the tough games.
I'm amazed by their improve

"They have grown up pretty
darn fast."
Perhaps the reason that
this young team has matured
at such an rapid pace is the
wealth of senior veterans who
continue to dominate the
opposition.
Senior defender and hole
man Tyrone Miller scored the
first goal of the game to give
the Cardinal the early 1-0 lead
and help build momentum
while playing exceptional
defense throughout the game.
Senior holeman and captain
Brian Wallin — the scoring
leader for the Cardinal — pro
duced a key goal while garner
ing several assists. And
Lehoczky scored two goals of
his own.
Many individuals stood out
at various points in the game,
but the ultimate impetus for
