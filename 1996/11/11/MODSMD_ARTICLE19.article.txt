# Volleyball wins two
## Cardinal drowns the Ducks, dams the Beavers at home 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team (21-2, 13-1 Pacific 10
Conference) took care of business
this weekend, quickly disman
tling Oregon (8-16, 2-12) Friday
and Oregon State (16-10, 5-10)
yesterday.
The Ducks visited the Farm
hoping to catch the Cardinal off
guard. In the first game, Oregon
gave Stanford a spirited effort, as
the team recorded 14 kills but
lost to the talented Card 15-8,
who had 21 kills and hit .326 as a
team.
However, that would be as
close as the Ducks came all
evening. In the second game,
Stanford roared to 15-5 victory,
foreshadowing the 15-3 thump
ing that the Card gave Oregon in
game three.
Junior outside hitter Kristin
Folkl led the way for Stanford,
recording 15 kills while hitting a
scorching .480. Freshman out
side hitter Kerri Walsh also pro
vided a great performance, rack
ing up 11 kills, while hitting .421.
Senior middle blocker Eileen
Murfee and junior middle blocker

Barbara Ifejika gave the Cardinal
the consistent, solid play that has
been the backbone of the Stan
ford squad, adding 17 kills
between them.
"What was so encouraging
about this game was that we
picked up our level of play as the
match went on," said Stanford
coach Don Shaw. "We need to
play at a high level no matter who
our opponent is."
On Sunday afternoon, the
Card faced an Oregon State team
struggling to escape from a
slump. The once highly ranked
Beavers came into their match
against Stanford after suffering
yet another setback, losing to
California on Friday in five
games.
The Cardinal found itself in a
tight opening game against Ore
gon State, as the Beavers realized
that their postseason hopes hung
in the balance. The two teams
found themselves deadlocked at
3-3, before the Cardinal offense
took control. Powerful kills from
junior outside hitter Debbie Lam
bert and Walsh led Stanford to an
8-5 lead. Oregon State's junior
outside hitter Pia Ahlengard kept
the Beavers close, but the Card's
power proved too much for Ore
gon State to handle as Stanford
jumped out to a 15-6 victory.
In the second game, Stanford
fell behind early as the Beavers'
defense slowed the Cardinal

attack. Senior middle blocker
Stacie Hintze and sophomore
middle blocker Sarah Bjeldanes
provided some blocking up the
middle, guiding the Beavers to a
6-4 lead. The Cardinal then
demonstrated some defense of its
own, as Murfee and Walsh both
recorded blocks, pulling the Car
dinal even at 8-8.
Folkl and Ifejika then fueled a
Cardinal rally that gave Stanford
a 13-10 advantage. Oregon State

fought back but eventually fell
short as Murfee made a block for
a 15-13 game-two win.
"I didn't think we would lose
it," Lambert said. "I was a little
nervous but not worried. I knew
we would not let up."
In game three, the Beavers
proved that they would not give
up, racing out to an early 3-0 lead
as senior outside hitter Rachel
Hochgesang provided the offen
sive spark for Oregon State.

However, Folkl and Murfee led
the Card back, helping Stanford
gain the lead 8-5. Freshman out
side hitter Jaimi Gregory also
showed some impressive play
both offensively and defensively
as Stanford rolled to an easy 15-6
game-three victory.
"I think we will be ready for
the postseason," Walsh said. "We
are getting better at every prac
tice and through every match. We
just have to keep on improving."
