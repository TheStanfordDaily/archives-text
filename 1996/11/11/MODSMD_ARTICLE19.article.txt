### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team (21-2, 13-1 Pacific 10
Conference) took care of business
this weekend, quickly disman
tling Oregon (8-16, 2-12) Friday
and Oregon State (16-10, 5-10)
yesterday.
The Ducks visited the Farm
hoping to catch the Cardinal off
guard. In the first game, Oregon
gave Stanford a spirited effort, as
the team recorded 14 kills but
lost to the talented Card 15-8,
who had 21 kills and hit .326 as a
team.
However, that would be as
close as the Ducks came all

Stanford roared to 15-5 victory,
foreshadowing the 15-3 thump
ing that the Card gave Oregon in
game three.
Junior outside hitter Kristin
Folkl led the way for Stanford,
recording 15 kills while hitting a
scorching .480. Freshman out
side hitter Kerri Walsh also pro
vided a great performance, rack
ing up 11 kills, while hitting .421.

between them.

about this game was that we
picked up our level of play as the
match went on," said Stanford
coach Don Shaw. "We need to
play at a high level no matter who
our opponent is."

Beavers came into their match
against Stanford after suffering
yet another setback, losing to
California on Friday in five
games.
The Cardinal found itself in a
tight opening game against Ore
gon State, as the Beavers realized
that their postseason hopes hung
in the balance. The two teams
found themselves deadlocked at
3-3, before the Cardinal offense
took control. Powerful kills from
junior outside hitter Debbie Lam
bert and Walsh led Stanford to an
8-5 lead. Oregon State's junior
