# Strength in unity
## Free Burma leader rallies for activism 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
"When spiders unite, they can
tie down a lion."
The words of this Ethiopian
proverb embellished the back of the
shirt of Zarni, a leader of the Free
Burma Coalition, who came to
speak in Branner Hall Friday.
Zarni has dedicated his life to the
attainment of freedom and democ
racy in Burma. As a child, he said,
he grew up having no conception of
freedom. In 1988, he left his home
to fight for this freedom and democ
racy by becoming a political activist.
"A democratic forum is a symbol
of what Burma could become if we
work freely and unite," said Zarni.
Since leaving his home of Man

dalay, Burma, for the United States
nine years ago, Zarni has not seen
his family. Yet the strides he has
made toward helping those in his
country have proven worthwhile,
he said.
The Free Burma Coalition, com
posed of various organizations
worldwide, seeks to establish free
dom and democracy in Burma by
building "a grass-roots movement
inspired and modeled alter the anti
apartheid movement in South
Africa," according to its mission
statement.
The two main objectives of the
coalition are to loosen the laws cre
ated by the State Law and Order
Restoration Council (SLORC) in
Burma by curtailing the flow of for
eign currency to the government
via American companies such as
Unocal, Texaco, ARCO, Total and
PepsiCo, and to create a strong de
mocratic contingent within Burma
that will seek to end the authoritar
ian rule of the SLORC.
Zarni urged students to help in
the fight against a totalitarian
regime by becoming active and
aware of how American companies
aid governments such as Burma's.
"For you, civil rights, freedom
and democracy are taught to you by
your family and environment,"
Zarni explained. "At the same time,
millions and millions of children
who don't know how to spell
democracy are fighting for values,
freedom and justice that you take
for granted."

Zarni stressed that organiza
tions such as the Free Burma Coali
tion could have an impact through
activism and education, not just for
Burma but worldwide.
"If we can't find ethics and
morals in schools, where can we
find them?" Zarni asked.
Currently, more than 100 cam
puses and 26 countries are partici
pating the Free Burma Coalition.
Many campuses have been active
in banning products that provide
economic support for the Burmese
government. Zarni pointed to the
petition signed by Stanford stu
dents last year to keep Taco Bell
from opening on campus as an ex
ample of students becoming active
in Burmese politics.
Zarni hopes that such activism
on college campuses and awareness
via the Internet will create success
ful results for the oppressed in
Burma. He urged students to ab
stain from consuming such prod
ucts as Pepsi and Texaco gasoline.
