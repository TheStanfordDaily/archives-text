### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Stanford battled hard for 90 minutes on Sunday,
but lost against archrival California 1-0 at Berkeley's
Witter Field on Sunday.
Despite the loss, Stanford (12-8) ends its regular
season as Pacific 10 Conference champions on the
strength of its 6-1 conference record. The conference
title grants the squad an automatic berth into the
NCAA tourney. Later this afternoon, the field, sites
and brackets for the Division I tournament will be
announced.
The Bears (13-3-2), who are ranked 25th national
ly, finish the season one game behind the Cardinal
with a Pac-10 record of 5-2. Washington and Wash
ington State, both teams which Stanford beat, handed
Cal its only Pac-10 losses. The Bears have not received
an automatic berth into the postseason and are hoping
that the selection committee will award them an at
large bid.
Stanford played well against the Bears yesterday,
but as happened all too often during the earlier stages
of the season, the Cardinal was unable to finish any of
its opportunities.
Neither team could take control of the game during
the first half, as both squads traded scoring chances
and defensive stands. The game remained scoreless
throughout the first half, as Cardinal goalkeeper
sophomore Erin Bryla and Bears goalie Karen Cook
refused to let the ball into the cage.
Finally, in the 68th minute of play, Cal got on the
board. Bear senior midfielder AUie Kemp and Bryla
