# Soccer falls to Cal in 1-0 bout
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Stanford battled hard for 90 minutes on Sunday,
but lost against archrival California 1-0 at Berkeley's
Witter Field on Sunday.
Despite the loss, Stanford (12-8) ends its regular
season as Pacific 10 Conference champions on the
strength of its 6-1 conference record. The conference
title grants the squad an automatic berth into the
NCAA tourney. Later this afternoon, the field, sites
and brackets for the Division I tournament will be
announced.
The Bears (13-3-2), who are ranked 25th national
ly, finish the season one game behind the Cardinal
with a Pac-10 record of 5-2. Washington and Wash
ington State, both teams which Stanford beat, handed
Cal its only Pac-10 losses. The Bears have not received
an automatic berth into the postseason and are hoping
that the selection committee will award them an at
large bid.
Stanford played well against the Bears yesterday,
but as happened all too often during the earlier stages
of the season, the Cardinal was unable to finish any of
its opportunities.
Neither team could take control of the game during
the first half, as both squads traded scoring chances
and defensive stands. The game remained scoreless
throughout the first half, as Cardinal goalkeeper
sophomore Erin Bryla and Bears goalie Karen Cook
refused to let the ball into the cage.
Finally, in the 68th minute of play, Cal got on the
board. Bear senior midfielder AUie Kemp and Bryla

both chased after a ball on the left
side of the 18-yard-box, and the
sprinting Kemp beat the Cardinal
keeper to it. Kemp played a center
ing pass to fellow senior midfielder
Alisha Lopez. Lopez headed the
ball out of the air and into the open
net from about five feet out.
That goal was all the Bears
would need, as in spite of outshoot
ing its foes 14 to 12, the Cardinal
couldn't equalize.
"This team doesn't have the
best record of any team I've played
on here," said Stanford senior for
ward Erin Martin, the Cardinal's
leading scorer. "In fact, this team
has the worst record. But none of
that matters now. We're in the
tournament, and that's what
counts. Everyone has a chance,
and we've got as good a shot as
anyone."
Last year the Card lost in the
first round to Santa Clara 3-2 in
triple overtime. Stanford's best
finish came in 1993 when lost to
George Mason 3-1 on penalty kicks
in the Final Four.
