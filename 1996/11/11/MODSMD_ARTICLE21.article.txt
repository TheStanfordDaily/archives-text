# Football topples the Trojans 24-20

As USC senior quarterback
Brad Otton let fly one final, des
perate pass from the Stanford 34-
yard line into the evening sky at
Stanford Stadium, 41,980 specta
tors and two teams collectively
held their breath. Could this be
the year the Cardinal finally beat
those hated Trojans or was it
going to be yet another near-miss,
almost if not more nauseating
than last year's 31-30 result?
As the ball was batted in the
air, two teams' fortunes hung in
the balance. For Stanford (4-5, 3-3
Pacific 10 Conference), it was a
shot at inching closer to .500 and
respectability while USC (5-5, 3-4
Pac-10) was trying to grab glory
lost long ago. When the dust
cleared, Stanford sophomore free

safety Tim Smith had the ball in
his hands and more importantly,
the Cardinal had conquered the
men of Troy 24-20 for their first
victory over Southern California in
four years.
Several heroes shone brightly
for the Cardinal. There was junior
Damon Dunn's electrifying 93-
yard kickofT return. There was the
gutsy effort of the offensive line,
holding the immensely talented
Trojan defensive front at bay
while in the process opening big
holes for senior running back
Mike Mitchell (a season-high 147
yards rushing) and giving sopho
more quarterback Chad Hutchin
son (20 of 35, 166 yards and only
two sacks) time to look downfield.
"That's the best they've played

so far," Mitchell said. "When you
face a defensive front like USC's,
they had to play the way they did."
There was also the goal-line
rushing of senior fullback Greg
Cornelia, who dragged four would
be tacklers along with his team's
sagging fortunes into the end zone
for a third-quarter lead Stanford
would not relinquish.
But perhaps the biggest heroes
of all were the Cardinal defenders,
who held USC scoreless in the sec
ond half after it charged out to a
20-7 halftime lead. The defense,
led by junior defensive end Kailee
Wong (six tackles and one sack),
senior strong safety Eliel Swinton
(a team-high 12 tackles) and
senior nose tackle Pete Swanson
(his critical first career intercep
tion), held the Trojans to only 107
net yards in the final two quar
ters, including 19 yards rushing.
More importantly, the defense
conquered the third-down demons

that have haunted them all year,
as the Trojans were only able to
convert on one of six third down
attempts.
"We're quite pleased with ...
the character our young men dis
played in coming from behind,"
said Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "We consider it a
tribute to them and also to the
coaches."
With the hoopla surrounding
the first night game at Stanford
Stadium since 1993, the opening
moments made for an under
whelming start. The Trojans had
a three-and-out series, while 22
yards in penalties forced the Car
dinal to give the ball back near
midfield. John Robinson's squad
quickly capitalized, as Otton
found true freshman receiver R.
Jay Soward over the middle.
Soward got good blocking, cut
toward the near sideline and dove
in for the game's opening score
with 9 minutes, 40 seconds left in
the opening frame.
The lead lasted only 14 sec
onds.
On the ensuing kickoff, fresh
man kicker David Bell squibbed a
kick fielded by Dunn at the 7-yard
line. Using good moves and mas
terful blocking, the junior kick
returner ran up the left sideline
through a maze of Trojans and
then cut back toward the middle
of the field untouched. Dunn's
third career kickoff return for a
touchdown evened matters and
momentarily kept the USC band
from playing "Conquest."
Unfortunately, the momentum
was short-lived as the Trojans
took the ensuing kickoff to their
47-yard line. Two key Otton
strikes and some strong running
from junior running back LaVale
Woods moved the ball down to the
Stanford 10, with the drive result
ing in a 27-yard field goal by
sophomore Adam Abrams that
regained the lead.
The shift in momentum
seemed to become more decided
on the next Stanford possession as
the Cardinal drove to the USC 36.
Facing a fourth-and-seven, Will
ingham elected to go for it as
Hutchinson faded back and lofted
a pass over the middle for senior
tight end Greg Clark. Hounded by
double coverage, the pass fell
incomplete and the Trojans took
over on downs with 4:50 left in the
first quarter.
USC took the ball and went on
its most impressive drive of the
game, taking 11 plays and eating

up nearly 5 minutes of the clock.
On a crucial third-and-15 for the
Trojans at the Stanford 34, USC
somehow converted. Otton rolled
right and hit Soward standing all
alone at the 11-yard line. Three
plays later, senior wide receiver
Chris Miller hauled in a 4-yard
pass over the middle to put the
Trojans up 17-7 just 4 seconds
into the second quarter.
After a missed 36-yard field
goal by Kevin Miller, USC went on
another sustained drive starting
at its 21 with 8:29 left in the half.
With Otton finding sophomore
wide receiver Mike Bastianelli
three times for 38 yards and the
Woods churning out yardage, the
Trojans were able to convert two
key third downs and take more
than 5 minutes off the clock. How
ever, after 14 plays, the drive
bogged down, and USC had to set
tle for a another 27-yarder from
Abrams to stretch the lead to 20-7
with three minutes left.
The Cardinal offense had one
last shot before halftime, and that
was almost bungled by the offi
cials. On a fourth-down punt at
the Stanford 35 with a minute
left, USC was flagged for holding.
However, it took the zebras 7 min
utes to figure out it was a first
down for Willingham's team.
Working in a hurry-up, Hutchin
son completed three straight pass
es for first downs, guiding them to
the Trojan 20. But on third down,
the sophomore signal-caller hit
senior Trojan linebacker Sammy
Knight with a pass over the mid
dle, killing the drive and ending
the half.
"A key was to remember that
we had limited success but that we
shot ourselves in the foot and
couldn't get the ball in the end
zone," Willingham said. "We put
ourselves in position, but we had
some bad penalties."
Trailing by 13, things looked
grim for the Cardinal. To make
matters worse, Stanford had only
scored two points in the critical
third quarter all year. But there
may have been a sense of urgency
this time around.
"Basically, it was a must-win
situation. I mean, our season was
on the line," Mitchell said.
With that in mind, Stanford
took the opening kickoff and
marched down the field. After two
first downs worked the ball to the
USC 44, Mitchell took a handoff
and rushed up the middle, broke
an arm tackle and veered up the
left sideline before getting dragged

down at the 4-yard line. Two plays
later, Mitchell punched it in for a
score. Miller's point after made it
20-14 only 2:33 into the third
quarter.
"That was the turning point of
the game," Hutchinson said. "Just
going out there and taking the
opening drive and scoring."
Six minutes later with USC
driving, senior cornerback Leroy
Pruitt picked off Otton's errant
throw at the Stanford 35. Rejuve
nated, the Cardinal offense drove
down the field again, as Hutchin
son found Dunn and Kirwan on
third-down pass plays, the latter
good for 22 yards to the USC 10.
Cornelia did the rest.
The senior fullback took a
handoff and bulldozed through
the line of scrimmage. Seemingly
stopped, he kept churning and
seemed to get stronger as more
tacklers piled on. Finally brought
down at the 2, it only delayed the
inevitable. Cornelia got the call
again and scored to knot matters
at 20-20. Miller's kick was good,
and Stanford had its first lead of
the night with under 2 minutes
left in the third period.
A 52-yard run by Mitchell 3
minutes into the final quarter set
up another scoring chance for
Stanford. Miller's 29-yard field
goal attempt was wide right as the
Cardinal continued to cling to a
one-point advantage. But the
Stanford defense came up huge,
forcing the beleaguered Otton to
complete only 8 of 20 passes in the
second half while the running
attack crumbled around him.
However, the Stanford offense
could not run much time off as two
series took only 3:09 off the clock.
So, USC still had one final
chance to steal yet another victory
from the Cardinal. Starting at the
Trojan 22 with 2:48 remaining,
Otton moved the team 12 yards in
two plays. Then, not facing a
severe amount of pressure, Otton
decided to split the nine and the
seven on a surprised Pete Swan
son's jersey. The senior nose tack
le hauled in the interception and
returned it 10 yards to the 27-vard
line with about 2 minutes left.
"The pick gave us a chance to
see if we could run off the majori
ty of the clock down, and we were
fortunate enough to do that,"
Willingham said.
Mitchell got the call on five
straight running plays, gaining 12
yards. Called on once again. Miller
delivered this time, splitting the
uprights on a 32-yard boot with 32

seconds left for a 24-20 lead.
On the final Trojan drive,
Otton found Miller and junior
running back Rodney Sermons for
18 and 19 yards, respectively, set
ting up Otton's failed attempt at
late-game heroics.
"I think we were in control in
the first half," said flabbergasted
USC head coach John Robinson.
"We didn't do much in the second
half and lost the game. Stanford
made the plays, and we did not."
Coupled with last week's win
over UCLA, Stanford swept the
Southern California schools for
the first time since the 1992 sea
son. But for the moment, conquer
ing the Trojans was good enough
for the team.
"It feels really great to finally
beat them. Last year, we played a
great game for 59 minutes, and we
gave it away at the end," Mitchell
said. "This year, we talked about
playing for 60 minutes."
If this keeps up, they may be
talking about playing in a 12th
game.

convert on one of six third down
attempts.
"We're quite pleased with ...
the character our young men dis
played in coming from behind,"
said Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "We consider it a
tribute to them and also to the
coaches."
With the hoopla surrounding
the first night game at Stanford
Stadium since 1993, the opening
moments made for an under
whelming start. The Trojans had
a three-and-out series, while 22
yards in penalties forced the Car
dinal to give the ball back near
midfield. John Robinson's squad
quickly capitalized, as Otton
found true freshman receiver R.
Jay Soward over the middle.
Soward got good blocking, cut
toward the near sideline and dove
in for the game's opening score
with 9 minutes, 40 seconds left in
the opening frame.
The lead lasted only 14 sec
onds.
On the ensuing kickoff, fresh
man kicker David Bell squibbed a
kick fielded by Dunn at the 7-yard
line. Using good moves and mas
terful blocking, the junior kick
returner ran up the left sideline
through a maze of Trojans and
then cut back toward the middle
of the field untouched. Dunn's
third career kickoff return for a
touchdown evened matters and
momentarily kept the USC band
from playing "Conquest."
Unfortunately, the momentum
was short-lived as the Trojans
took the ensuing kickoff to their
47-yard line. Two key Otton
strikes and some strong running
from junior running back LaVale
Woods moved the ball down to the
Stanford 10, with the drive result
ing in a 27-yard field goal by
sophomore Adam Abrams that
regained the lead.
The shift in momentum
seemed to become more decided
on the next Stanford possession as
the Cardinal drove to the USC 36.
Facing a fourth-and-seven, Will
ingham elected to go for it as
Hutchinson faded back and lofted
a pass over the middle for senior
tight end Greg Clark. Hounded by
double coverage, the pass fell
incomplete and the Trojans took
over on downs with 4:50 left in the
first quarter.
USC took the ball and went on
its most impressive drive of the
game, taking 11 plays and eating

up nearly 5 minutes of the clock.
On a crucial third-and-15 for the
Trojans at the Stanford 34, USC
somehow converted. Otton rolled
right and hit Soward standing all
alone at the 11-yard line. Three
plays later, senior wide receiver
Chris Miller hauled in a 4-yard
pass over the middle to put the
Trojans up 17-7 just 4 seconds
into the second quarter.
After a missed 36-yard field
goal by Kevin Miller, USC went on
another sustained drive starting
at its 21 with 8:29 left in the half.
With Otton finding sophomore
wide receiver Mike Bastianelli
three times for 38 yards and the
Woods churning out yardage, the
Trojans were able to convert two
key third downs and take more
than 5 minutes off the clock. How
ever, after 14 plays, the drive
bogged down, and USC had to set
tle for a another 27-yarder from
Abrams to stretch the lead to 20-7
with three minutes left.
The Cardinal offense had one
last shot before halftime, and that
was almost bungled by the offi
cials. On a fourth-down punt at
the Stanford 35 with a minute
left, USC was flagged for holding.
However, it took the zebras 7 min
utes to figure out it was a first
down for Willingham's team.
Working in a hurry-up, Hutchin
son completed three straight pass
es for first downs, guiding them to
the Trojan 20. But on third down,
the sophomore signal-caller hit
senior Trojan linebacker Sammy
Knight with a pass over the mid
dle, killing the drive and ending
the half.
"A key was to remember that
we had limited success but that we
shot ourselves in the foot and
couldn't get the ball in the end
zone," Willingham said. "We put
ourselves in position, but we had
some bad penalties."
Trailing by 13, things looked
grim for the Cardinal. To make
matters worse, Stanford had only
scored two points in the critical
third quarter all year. But there
may have been a sense of urgency
this time around.
"Basically, it was a must-win
situation. I mean, our season was
on the line," Mitchell said.
With that in mind, Stanford
took the opening kickoff and
marched down the field. After two
first downs worked the ball to the
USC 44, Mitchell took a handoff
and rushed up the middle, broke
an arm tackle and veered up the
left sideline before getting dragged

down at the 4-yard line. Two plays
later, Mitchell punched it in for a
score. Miller's point after made it
20-14 only 2:33 into the third
quarter.
"That was the turning point of
the game," Hutchinson said. "Just
going out there and taking the
opening drive and scoring."
Six minutes later with USC
driving, senior cornerback Leroy
Pruitt picked off Otton's errant
throw at the Stanford 35. Rejuve
nated, the Cardinal offense drove
down the field again, as Hutchin
son found Dunn and Kirwan on
third-down pass plays, the latter
good for 22 yards to the USC 10.
Cornelia did the rest.
The senior fullback took a
handoff and bulldozed through
the line of scrimmage. Seemingly
stopped, he kept churning and
seemed to get stronger as more
tacklers piled on. Finally brought
down at the 2, it only delayed the
inevitable. Cornelia got the call
again and scored to knot matters
at 20-20. Miller's kick was good,
and Stanford had its first lead of
the night with under 2 minutes
left in the third period.
A 52-yard run by Mitchell 3
minutes into the final quarter set
up another scoring chance for
Stanford. Miller's 29-yard field
goal attempt was wide right as the
Cardinal continued to cling to a
one-point advantage. But the
Stanford defense came up huge,
forcing the beleaguered Otton to
complete only 8 of 20 passes in the
second half while the running
attack crumbled around him.
However, the Stanford offense
could not run much time off as two
series took only 3:09 off the clock.
So, USC still had one final
chance to steal yet another victory
from the Cardinal. Starting at the
Trojan 22 with 2:48 remaining,
Otton moved the team 12 yards in
two plays. Then, not facing a
severe amount of pressure, Otton
decided to split the nine and the
seven on a surprised Pete Swan
son's jersey. The senior nose tack
le hauled in the interception and
returned it 10 yards to the 27-vard
line with about 2 minutes left.
"The pick gave us a chance to
see if we could run off the majori
ty of the clock down, and we were
fortunate enough to do that,"
Willingham said.
Mitchell got the call on five
straight running plays, gaining 12
yards. Called on once again. Miller
delivered this time, splitting the
uprights on a 32-yard boot with 32

seconds left for a 24-20 lead.
On the final Trojan drive,
Otton found Miller and junior
running back Rodney Sermons for
18 and 19 yards, respectively, set
ting up Otton's failed attempt at
late-game heroics.
"I think we were in control in
the first half," said flabbergasted
USC head coach John Robinson.
"We didn't do much in the second
half and lost the game. Stanford
made the plays, and we did not."
Coupled with last week's win
over UCLA, Stanford swept the
Southern California schools for
the first time since the 1992 sea
son. But for the moment, conquer
ing the Trojans was good enough
for the team.
"It feels really great to finally
beat them. Last year, we played a
great game for 59 minutes, and we
gave it away at the end," Mitchell
said. "This year, we talked about
playing for 60 minutes."
If this keeps up, they may be
talking about playing in a 12th
game.

Senior Brian Manning stretches out for the pass from sophomore

As USC senior quarterback
Brad Otton let fly one final, des

yard line into the evening sky at
Stanford Stadium, 41,980 specta

held their breath. Could this be

those hated Trojans or was it
going to be yet another near-miss,
almost if not more nauseating
than last year's 31-30 result?
As the ball was batted in the

the balance. For Stanford (4-5, 3-3
Pacific 10 Conference), it was a
shot at inching closer to .500 and

safety Tim Smith had the ball in
his hands and more importantly,
the Cardinal had conquered the
men of Troy 24-20 for their first
victory over Southern California in
four years.
Several heroes shone brightly
for the Cardinal. There was junior
Damon Dunn's electrifying 93-
yard kickofT return. There was the
gutsy effort of the offensive line,
holding the immensely talented
Trojan defensive front at bay
while in the process opening big
holes for senior running back
Mike Mitchell (a season-high 147
yards rushing) and giving sopho
more quarterback Chad Hutchin
son (20 of 35, 166 yards and only
two sacks) time to look downfield.
"That's the best they've played

so far," Mitchell said. "When you
face a defensive front like USC's,
they had to play the way they did."
There was also the goal-line
rushing of senior fullback Greg
Cornelia, who dragged four would
be tacklers along with his team's
sagging fortunes into the end zone
for a third-quarter lead Stanford
would not relinquish.
But perhaps the biggest heroes
of all were the Cardinal defenders,
who held USC scoreless in the sec
ond half after it charged out to a
20-7 halftime lead. The defense,
led by junior defensive end Kailee
Wong (six tackles and one sack),
senior strong safety Eliel Swinton
(a team-high 12 tackles) and
senior nose tackle Pete Swanson
(his critical first career intercep
tion), held the Trojans to only 107
net yards in the final two quar
ters, including 19 yards rushing.
More importantly, the defense
conquered the third-down demons

goal by Kevin Miller, USC went on
another sustained drive starting
at its 21 with 8:29 left in the half.
With Otton finding sophomore
wide receiver Mike Bastianelli
three times for 38 yards and the
Woods churning out yardage, the
Trojans were able to convert two
key third downs and take more
than 5 minutes off the clock. How
ever, after 14 plays, the drive
bogged down, and USC had to set
tle for a another 27-yarder from
Abrams to stretch the lead to 20-7
with three minutes left.
The Cardinal offense had one
last shot before halftime, and that
was almost bungled by the offi
cials. On a fourth-down punt at
the Stanford 35 with a minute
left, USC was flagged for holding.
However, it took the zebras 7 min
utes to figure out it was a first
down for Willingham's team.
Working in a hurry-up, Hutchin
son completed three straight pass
es for first downs, guiding them to
the Trojan 20. But on third down,
the sophomore signal-caller hit
senior Trojan linebacker Sammy
Knight with a pass over the mid
dle, killing the drive and ending
the half.
"A key was to remember that
we had limited success but that we
shot ourselves in the foot and
couldn't get the ball in the end
zone," Willingham said. "We put
ourselves in position, but we had
some bad penalties."
Trailing by 13, things looked
grim for the Cardinal. To make
matters worse, Stanford had only
scored two points in the critical
third quarter all year. But there
may have been a sense of urgency
this time around.
"Basically, it was a must-win
situation. I mean, our season was
on the line," Mitchell said.
With that in mind, Stanford
took the opening kickoff and
marched down the field. After two
first downs worked the ball to the
USC 44, Mitchell took a handoff
and rushed up the middle, broke
an arm tackle and veered up the
left sideline before getting dragged

down at the 4-yard line. Two plays
later, Mitchell punched it in for a
score. Miller's point after made it
20-14 only 2:33 into the third
quarter.
"That was the turning point of
the game," Hutchinson said. "Just
going out there and taking the
opening drive and scoring."
Six minutes later with USC
driving, senior cornerback Leroy
Pruitt picked off Otton's errant
throw at the Stanford 35. Rejuve
nated, the Cardinal offense drove
down the field again, as Hutchin
son found Dunn and Kirwan on
third-down pass plays, the latter
good for 22 yards to the USC 10.
Cornelia did the rest.
The senior fullback took a
handoff and bulldozed through
the line of scrimmage. Seemingly
stopped, he kept churning and
seemed to get stronger as more
tacklers piled on. Finally brought
down at the 2, it only delayed the
inevitable. Cornelia got the call
again and scored to knot matters
at 20-20. Miller's kick was good,
and Stanford had its first lead of
the night with under 2 minutes
left in the third period.
A 52-yard run by Mitchell 3
minutes into the final quarter set
up another scoring chance for
Stanford. Miller's 29-yard field
goal attempt was wide right as the
Cardinal continued to cling to a
one-point advantage. But the
Stanford defense came up huge,
forcing the beleaguered Otton to
complete only 8 of 20 passes in the
second half while the running
attack crumbled around him.
However, the Stanford offense
could not run much time off as two
series took only 3:09 off the clock.
So, USC still had one final
chance to steal yet another victory
from the Cardinal. Starting at the
Trojan 22 with 2:48 remaining,
Otton moved the team 12 yards in
two plays. Then, not facing a
severe amount of pressure, Otton
decided to split the nine and the
seven on a surprised Pete Swan
son's jersey. The senior nose tack
le hauled in the interception and
returned it 10 yards to the 27-vard
line with about 2 minutes left.
"The pick gave us a chance to
see if we could run off the majori
ty of the clock down, and we were
fortunate enough to do that,"
Willingham said.
Mitchell got the call on five
straight running plays, gaining 12
yards. Called on once again. Miller
delivered this time, splitting the
uprights on a 32-yard boot with 32

seconds left for a 24-20 lead.
On the final Trojan drive,
Otton found Miller and junior
running back Rodney Sermons for
18 and 19 yards, respectively, set
ting up Otton's failed attempt at
late-game heroics.
"I think we were in control in
the first half," said flabbergasted
USC head coach John Robinson.
"We didn't do much in the second
half and lost the game. Stanford
made the plays, and we did not."
Coupled with last week's win
over UCLA, Stanford swept the
Southern California schools for
the first time since the 1992 sea
son. But for the moment, conquer
ing the Trojans was good enough
for the team.
"It feels really great to finally
beat them. Last year, we played a
great game for 59 minutes, and we
gave it away at the end," Mitchell
said. "This year, we talked about
playing for 60 minutes."
If this keeps up, they may be
talking about playing in a 12th
game.

Frederick Vallaeys — Daily
Senior Brian Manning stretches out for the pass from sophomore
quarterback Chad Hutchinson.
As USC senior quarterback
Brad Otton let fly one final, des
perate pass from the Stanford 34-
yard line into the evening sky at
Stanford Stadium, 41,980 specta
tors and two teams collectively
held their breath. Could this be
the year the Cardinal finally beat
those hated Trojans or was it
going to be yet another near-miss,
almost if not more nauseating
than last year's 31-30 result?
As the ball was batted in the
air, two teams' fortunes hung in
the balance. For Stanford (4-5, 3-3
Pacific 10 Conference), it was a
shot at inching closer to .500 and
respectability while USC (5-5, 3-4
Pac-10) was trying to grab glory
lost long ago. When the dust
cleared, Stanford sophomore free

safety Tim Smith had the ball in
his hands and more importantly,
the Cardinal had conquered the
men of Troy 24-20 for their first
victory over Southern California in
four years.
Several heroes shone brightly
for the Cardinal. There was junior
Damon Dunn's electrifying 93-
yard kickofT return. There was the
gutsy effort of the offensive line,
holding the immensely talented
Trojan defensive front at bay
while in the process opening big
holes for senior running back
Mike Mitchell (a season-high 147
yards rushing) and giving sopho
more quarterback Chad Hutchin
son (20 of 35, 166 yards and only
two sacks) time to look downfield.
"That's the best they've played

so far," Mitchell said. "When you
face a defensive front like USC's,
they had to play the way they did."
There was also the goal-line
rushing of senior fullback Greg
Cornelia, who dragged four would
be tacklers along with his team's
sagging fortunes into the end zone
for a third-quarter lead Stanford
would not relinquish.
But perhaps the biggest heroes
of all were the Cardinal defenders,
who held USC scoreless in the sec
ond half after it charged out to a
20-7 halftime lead. The defense,
led by junior defensive end Kailee
Wong (six tackles and one sack),
senior strong safety Eliel Swinton
(a team-high 12 tackles) and
senior nose tackle Pete Swanson
(his critical first career intercep
tion), held the Trojans to only 107
net yards in the final two quar
ters, including 19 yards rushing.
More importantly, the defense
conquered the third-down demons

that have haunted them all year,
as the Trojans were only able to
convert on one of six third down
attempts.
"We're quite pleased with ...
the character our young men dis
played in coming from behind,"
said Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham. "We consider it a
tribute to them and also to the
coaches."
With the hoopla surrounding
the first night game at Stanford
Stadium since 1993, the opening
moments made for an under
whelming start. The Trojans had
a three-and-out series, while 22
yards in penalties forced the Car
dinal to give the ball back near
midfield. John Robinson's squad
quickly capitalized, as Otton
found true freshman receiver R.
Jay Soward over the middle.
Soward got good blocking, cut
toward the near sideline and dove
in for the game's opening score
with 9 minutes, 40 seconds left in
the opening frame.
The lead lasted only 14 sec
onds.
On the ensuing kickoff, fresh
man kicker David Bell squibbed a
kick fielded by Dunn at the 7-yard
line. Using good moves and mas
terful blocking, the junior kick
returner ran up the left sideline
through a maze of Trojans and
then cut back toward the middle
of the field untouched. Dunn's
third career kickoff return for a
touchdown evened matters and
momentarily kept the USC band
from playing "Conquest."
Unfortunately, the momentum
was short-lived as the Trojans
took the ensuing kickoff to their
47-yard line. Two key Otton
strikes and some strong running
from junior running back LaVale
Woods moved the ball down to the
Stanford 10, with the drive result
ing in a 27-yard field goal by
sophomore Adam Abrams that
regained the lead.
The shift in momentum
seemed to become more decided
on the next Stanford possession as
the Cardinal drove to the USC 36.
Facing a fourth-and-seven, Will
ingham elected to go for it as
Hutchinson faded back and lofted
a pass over the middle for senior
tight end Greg Clark. Hounded by
double coverage, the pass fell
incomplete and the Trojans took
over on downs with 4:50 left in the
first quarter.
USC took the ball and went on
its most impressive drive of the
game, taking 11 plays and eating

up nearly 5 minutes of the clock.
On a crucial third-and-15 for the
Trojans at the Stanford 34, USC
somehow converted. Otton rolled
right and hit Soward standing all
alone at the 11-yard line. Three
plays later, senior wide receiver
Chris Miller hauled in a 4-yard
pass over the middle to put the
Trojans up 17-7 just 4 seconds
into the second quarter.
After a missed 36-yard field
goal by Kevin Miller, USC went on
another sustained drive starting
at its 21 with 8:29 left in the half.
With Otton finding sophomore
wide receiver Mike Bastianelli
three times for 38 yards and the
Woods churning out yardage, the
Trojans were able to convert two
key third downs and take more
