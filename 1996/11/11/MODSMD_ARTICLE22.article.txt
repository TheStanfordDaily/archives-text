# WHAT THE WIN MEANS
## 
### 
If Stanford wins its two
remaining games and UCLA
loses either at Arizona or to
USC, the Cardinal will receive
an invitation to the Norwest
Sun Bowl on New Year's Eve as
the highest-remaining team in
the Pac-IO standings besides
Arizona State (Rose Bowl) and
Washington (Cotton or Holiday
Bowl).
If UCLA wins its final two
games, the Sun Bowl will
choose between the Bruins and
the Cardinal. If it selects
UCLA, the Cardinal will fall
into a battle with California
and possibly Washington State
(if it defeats Washington) and
Oregon (if it defeats Cal and
Oregon State) for a bid to the
Jeep-Eagle Aloha Bowl on
Christmas Day. The Aloha
Bowl does not have to take
Stanford despite its superior
conference record.
