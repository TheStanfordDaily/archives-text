7:15 p.m.: University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper schmoozes
in the VIP box. He wears his spe

press box wonder out loud if he is

aware yellow and maroon are
USC's colors.
7:17 p.m.: Rocket Man deliv
ers the game ball to Blooming
dale's representatives. His rock
et pack deafens the entire crowd

Stanford hasn't run a kickoff
back for a touchdown vet this

yards. USC 7, Stanford 7.
7:47 p.m.: Field goal by
USC's Adam Abrams (yes, it's
his brother). USC 10, Stanford 7.
7:48 p.m.: I turn to Ed Guz

Stanford has only run a kickoff
back for a touchdown once this
season. "It's about time," I say.
7:49 p.m.: Senior Marlon
Evans returns a kickoff 35 yards
to the Stanford 46. Hey, at least I

8:49 p.m. to 8:56 p.m.: Refs
confused as to whether Stanford
should get a first down on a USC
penalty because they forgot
where the ball was lined up.
Casper gets up and leaves for a
while. Fans boo. They finally
decide it's a Stanford first down
— what everybody else already
knew.
9:03 p.m.: Somewhere, Daily

about yet another of their own
calls. Odds lower of Taco Bell

USC and Stanford share a
moment of love.

eight USC defenders (and about
eight Stanford players as well) 8
yards to the USC 2. Hired after

10 p.m.: Cornelia finishes the
job, as Stanford scores. After
Miller makes the extra point,
Stanford leads! Stanford 21,
USC 20.
10:02 p.m.: Biggest shock of
game: Refs call a penalty without
confusion.
10:09 p.m.: After a USC
punt, Stanford gets the ball on
its own 1. Cornelia barely makes

quarter.

Audible whooshing sound com

10:56 p.m.: With USC driving
at the Stanford 34, the Trojans
line up for the final play of the
game. A "Hail Mary" pass is
thrown to corner of end zone into
a mass of USC and Stanford bod
ies. Crowd has collective heart
attack. Ref lifts hands like he is
about to signal touchdown.
Instead, he waives his arms and
points upfield. Stanford inter
ception by sophomore Tim
Smith. Final score: Stanford 24,
USC 20.
10:59 p.m.: Stanford players
join the I3and to celebrate the
Cardinal's first win over USC
since 1992 — when this year's

10:09 p.m.: After a USC
punt, Stanford gets the ball on

points upfield. Stanford inter

Smith. Final score: Stanford 24,
USC 20.
10:59 p.m.: Stanford players
