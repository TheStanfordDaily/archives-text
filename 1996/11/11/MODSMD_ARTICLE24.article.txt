## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Stanford field hockey
team is champion.
In its final game of the sea
son, the Cardinal defeated Cali
fornia in a triple-overtime match
to take the Northern Pacific
Conference title at the Western
Collegiate Championships this
weekend, held at the University
of the Pacific. The Cardinal went
into yesterday's big game after a
4-0 win Saturday over Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo and a 3-0 victo
ry over UC-Davis the day before.
The long match against the
Bears, which lasted nearly three
hours, called for a stroke-battle
ending as the game was still
scoreless after two overtime
periods, each lasting 15 minutes.
The Card's five strokers
included sophomore sweeper
Lissy Goralnik, freshman mid
fielder Julie Gwozdz, sophomore
midfielders Jordyn Kramer and
Justina Williams and sophomore
forward Monique Leroux.
First up was Goralnik. who
executed a beautifully calculated

low shot into the Bears' net.
Tension mounted as Cal scored
on a penalty, and the Card's fol
lowing three shots were saved by
the Bears' keeper.
Cardinal keeper Kelly Naylor
technically did not let a single
shot pass her; the Bears' only
goal came from a foul that
resulted in a penalty score for
Cal.
A stroke-session rule calls for
the goalkeeper's foot to be on the
white line that separates the
goal from the rest of the field.
According to the referees, Nay
lor's foot was not. Although the
shot was not even in scoring
range — the ball went off wide,
rolling onto the grass to the side
of Naylor's goal — it neverthe
less killed the Card's crucial
lead, bringing the long game
back to the start.
Although the 1-1 count put
final stroker Leroux on the spot,
the forward showed no sign of
discomfiture.
"I was pumped up for my
stroke," Leroux said. "Because
of Kelly's amazing saves, it was
lexecutedl on a hich. I shot it

feeling an adrenaline rush."
Leroux's clean shot into the
Cal goal once again gave the
Card a 2-1 stroke lead. Naylor's
final save decided the game for
the Cardinal and crowned the
Stanford team NorPac Champi
ons with a 1-0 victory.
According to Leroux, Naylor's
saves were "unbelievable."
"I don't think any other
goalie could have made those
saves," Leroux said. "They were
just amazing."
The forward attributed the
win to the squad's hard work
and collective effort throughout
the season.
"It felt great to be able to con
tribute to the win by scoring the
last stroke, but it was such a
team effort to get there," Leroux
said. "Everybody contributed;
we got there as a team."
After the great victory, Cardi
nal players followed the tradi
tion of dumping water on head
coach Sheryl Johnson. Accord
ing to players, Johnson good
naturedly accepted the role and
let herself be drenched.
"The title is kind of like icing

on the cake after such a success
ful season," Johnson said. "I was
very proud of the team today.
We were very focused. Our team
played hard up to the very last
second. I definitely thought we
were a better team, but their
keeper played extremely well. I
wasn't expecting it to be such a
close game."
The Cardinal team at last has
capped off its victorious season
with what it deserves; the play
ers have lived up to the goal that
they set for themselves at the
beginning of the season — to be
champions and win the NorPac
title.
"It didn't really start to sink
in until we were back at school,"
said junior midfielder Paige
Mader. "It feels great, and it
proves to everyone that the
Stanford field hockey program is
very- strong."
"It feels incredible," said
sophomore defense Stephanie
Finklestein. "It's always been
kind of iffy with Cal because we
both want [the title] so bad, but
we gave it our all and we came
out on top."
