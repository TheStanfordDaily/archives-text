The Stanford men's soccer team defeated No. 25
Santa Clara (8-4-3) 1-0 yesterday in a hard-fought
overtime battle, keeping its four-game winning streak
alive and achieving its goal of winning the last five
games of the season. With the win, the Card improved
its record to 10-4-4 and kept its hopes alive for a berth
in the NCAA tournament.
The first half of action began quickly for the Card
with several good scoring opportunities early. Stan
ford pressed the Bronco defense for much of the first
half but wad unable to convert.
Midway through the first half, freshman midfielder
Gerard Davis received the ball in the middle of the field
He took the ball right at the Bronco defense and blast
ed a shot from about 25 yards out that the keeper was
unable to control. No Stanford players were around to
crash the keeper, so the opportunity was lost.
Minutes later, junior midfielder Shan Gaw received
the ball near the 18-yard line and was able to dribble
past the Bronco keeper. He flicked the ball toward the
right post, but a Bronco defender intercepted the shot.
Though the Broncos had a few good scoring
chances in the first half, they too were unable to con
vert, leaving the game scoreless at the half
The second half began slowly for the Cardinal as
the Broncos applied intense pressure on the Stanford
defense. Minutes into the half, the Broncos had an
excellent scoring opportunity when they shot the ball
with senior Stanford goalkeeper Ryan Craig out of the
goal Senior captain Brad Davies, however, was in
position and was able to block the
shot.
With 20 minutes remaining,
the intensity level was switched
up a notch as each team realized
its postseason hopes lay in the
balance with this game. Though
each keeper saw a flurry of action
in the final minutes of regula
tion, neither team was able to
score.
The early minutes of the first
overtime were uneventful until
sophomore midfielder Jamie Clark
sent a long ball crossfield to the
senior striker Erik Morrison. He
controlled the ball, beat a defender
and forced the keeper out of the
net. As the keeper charged at him,
Morrison drilled the ball past the
Bronco keeper and into the net.

"I don't actually know what
happened," Morrison said. "I
remember getting the ball and see
ing the keeper coming at me. The
next thing the ball was in the net.
In those situations, you're not
really thinking too much —
instincts just take over."
The Card was able to fend off
several attacks by the Broncos in
the second overtime session to win
its fifth game in a row. Its postsea
son fate rests in the hands of the
NCAA tournament selection com
mittee, which will announce the
tournament field Nov. 18.
As in all close matches, the Car
dinal defense was a key factor in
yesterday's victory.
"Defensively, we were trying to
knock the ball in behind the Bron
co defense," Davies said. "Though
in general I think the defense
played pretty well, it was definitely
the team effort that pulled us
through in the end."
