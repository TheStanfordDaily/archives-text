# New program targets 'intellectual' students 'Life of the Mind' involves alumni in admissions process

Stanford has a reputation for valuing the
"well-rounded" student above the "intellectual
leader," according to James Montoya, dean of un
dergraduate admission and financial aid.
To dispel this myth, a pilot programs called
"Life of the Mind" was launched last spring quar
ter, in an attempt to reach out to high school
sophomores and juniors who "set the intellectual
tone" at their schools.
"We can always be doing more to attract intel
lectual leaders," said Montoya, when asked
whether he thought that the academic caliber of
prospective students was declining.
"I think it's Stanford's responsibility to en
courage [these students] in high school and to
support them because all too often they are not
the ones who get recognition at high school for
their many accomplishments and talents."
The program has targeted a selection of "ex
traordinarily talented" students from 25 schools
in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas, ex
plained Holly Haley Knapp, coordinator of Stan
ford's alumni involvement program.
Nearly 100 sophomores and juniors were in
vited to participate on the basis of PSAT scores,
self-reported grades and recommendations from
high school counselors.
Last spring, faculty members and Stanford
alumni were flown to a reception in Los Angeles
to tell prospective students and their parents

about the academic opportunities available at
Stanford.
According to Montoya, this was not a typical
recruitment drive.
"It focused on the intellectual journeys of fac
ulty and students, rather than facts about Stan
ford or a description of the admissions process,"
he said.
"The benefit of the program comes from rein
forcing the image of Stanford as an intellectual
community," Montoya said. "Often students in
Southern California know more about our ath
letics programs, which get a lot of visibility on
television."
Thirty-four percent of the 1,614 freshmen ad
mitted to Stanford this fall had verbal and math
SAT scores each above 750, while 8 percent failed
to score above 600 points, according to a prelimi
nary profile of Stanford's new undergraduate
class.
An overwhelming 43 percent of 1996 fresh
men come from California, although a total of 48
states and 1,004 high schools are represented.
Assoc. Chemistry Prof. Robert Way mouth,
one of two faculty members invited to take part in
the program, said he had not witnessed a decline
in the intellectual caliber of Stanford students in
the eight years that he has taught here.
"I am constantly amazed by the caliber of stu
dents," he said.
English Prof. Diane Middlebrook, another
participant, said, "I don't think it's the caliber so
much as the culture" that's declining.

According to Middlebrook, humanities stu
dents complain that they are regarded as second
class citizens in the binary world of "techies" and
"fuzzies" at Stanford.
Techies are the scientists, who have hard
edges and hard goals, explained Middlebrook,
whereas the fuzzies are the students of liberal
arts and social sciences whose goals are less clear
ly defined, and whose edges are, well, more fuzzy.
One of the priorities of the admissions pro
gram as she sees it is to present the perspectives
of two faculty members from different disciplines
and to give students and their parents a positive
experience of the "personable-ness" of profes
sors.
Life of the Mind is just one pilot program with
in a three-year pilot plan that aims to involve
more alumni and parents in the Stanford admis
sion process in cities across the country.
"We have found that it is very helpful to have
parents talking to parents," said Montoya, "par
ticularly the further we get away from the West
Coast, when there is a level of anxiety about send
ing a child 3,000 miles away."
Alumni networks have been established in
Dallas, Chicago and New York.
Follow-up phone calls from alumni are a fea
ture of the Life of the Mind program. Prospective
students who are now seniors were encouraged to
visit the campus this fall and to send in their ap
plication forms. Juniors will likely be invited to
participate in a special admission session in next
spring.
