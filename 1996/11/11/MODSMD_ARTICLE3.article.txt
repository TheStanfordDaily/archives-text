# Regents examine report
## Business side of medical merger discussed 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
Both the UC Board of Regents
and public speakers sought to clari
fy issues in a report on the feasibili
ty of a proposed merger between
Stanford Health Services and the
UC-San Francisco Medical Center
at a special meeting of the Regents
Friday.
Although the Regents took no
action, a final vote on the merger,
may take place as soon as this Fri
day. Meanwhile, the Regents'
health and finance committees will
meet Wednesday to consider the
proposed merger.
The merger seeks to unite the

two Bay Area medical centers in re
sponse to increasingly competitive
pressures of the Northern Califor
nia health care market. It would
create a new organization, tenta
tively called NEWCO. Improved fi
nancial health of the clinical facili
ties would support the academic
missions of the Stanford and UCSF
medical schools.
A third-party review team head
ed by San Francisco investment
banker Warren Hell man compiled
the report, which was commis
sioned by the Regents in August.
Hellman was quest ioned on the de
tails of his assessment in open and
closed sessions of the meeting.
Using operating profit as the
measure of financial health, the re
port found that UCSF would be bet
ter off as part of NEWCO than on a
stand-alone basis. Without the
merger, Hellman forecast a "weak
operating performance" that would
rely heavily on nonoperating in
come.
"UCSF is in a better, stronger
competitive position in NEWCO
than it is by itself," he said.
Operating profit does not in
clude one-time charges, benefits of
over-funded pension or nonoperat
ing income, such as net investment
income, gifts or clinical teaching
support.
Since the Stanford Medical Cen
ter is not a public corporation like
UCSF, much of the discussion of its
finances did not take place in open

session. Still, Hellman acknowl
edged that SHS and Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital would be "at
least as financially healthy" as
UCSF on a stand-alone basis.
According to the report, the ben
efits of the merger result from in
creased specialty care revenues, re
duced operating expenses and
avoided capital expenditures.
Hellman argued that NEWCO
will bring an opportunity to lower
prices for specialty care and im
prove customer service through
broader geographical coverage.
This, in turn, would lead to a
greater relative market share and
additional specialty cases.
In a public comment period that
preceded the presentation of the re
port, a series of 10 speakers either
openly criticised the merger or con
tributed suggestions. The objectivity
of the report, the economic benefits
of NEWCO and its impacts on labor
were the main points of contention.
In addition, Mark Richmond, ex
ecutive director of the Associated

Students of UCSF, urged the Re
gents to seek more student involve
ment in merger discussions and to
increase representation of medical
professionals in the NEWCO gov
erning board.
Addressing the labor issues
posed by NEWCO, Hcllman stated
that the merger makes future net
increases in employment possible.
The outlook for labor is less opti
mistic if UCSF continues to func
tion on a stand-alone basis, he said.
The merger will also "not ad
versely impact the levels of indigent
care at UCSF," argued Hellman,
targeting another aspect of public
anxiety.
In the open session, Lt. Gov.
Gray Davis, an ex officio Regent,
questioned what the Regents can do
to address the concerns of employ
ees and ensure indigent care. In re
sponse, Hellman stressed the im
portance of the financial health of
fered by NEWCO to both issues.
Hellman acknowledged that the
report does not address the legal is

sues related to the merger, such as
the authority of the Regents to cre
ate NEWCO and the impact of com
plaints filed by the Public Employ
ment Relations Board.
"Management issue is the
biggest risk," stated Regent David
Lee, pointing to a variety of perspec
tives on who will take charge of
NEWCO.
Hellman responded by remind
ing the Regents that there is no lack
of individual leaders in the institu
tions involved and that the teams
from Stanford and UCSF are "very
comfortable working with each
other."
In a related matter, UC President
Richard Atkinson announced that
UCSF Chancellor Joseph Martin
will leave his position in July to be
come dean of the faculty of medicine
at Harvard University. Atkinson ex
pressed confidence in"the ability of
the strong team (Martini has put in
place on the lUCSF] campus to pro
vide the continuity necessary to de
velop the proposed merger."
