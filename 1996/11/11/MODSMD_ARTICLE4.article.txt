# Budget stable, provost says
## No more trimming needed after three years of cuts 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
After three years of trimming, the University bud
get has been stabilized, Provost Condoleezza Rice said
in a recent interview.
Rice also highlighted upcoming initiatives from
her office, including a review of housing issues.
Over the past three years, the University has cut
$16.8 million from its budget. However, last year, due
to unexpectedly high revenue, it was only necessary to
cut $3.1 million — less than the targeted amount.
"We have achieved what we wanted to achieve,"
Rice said. "Our expenses and revenues are aligned.
We should be able to balance from year to year."
Rice added that "the budget stabilization plan
seems to have worked. The challenge is to keep bring
ing down costs."
One obstacle to that process is the ongoing costs of
seismic reconstruction.
"We are using some debt to finance that program,"
she said. "We have put significant input in from fund
raising and the program is well underway."
Recent controversial changes, such as the con
tracting out of management of the Faculty Club and
the Stanford University Press, have saved valuable
dollars, Rice added.
"I am often asked if [in contracting out], we are try
ing to run Stanford like a business. The answer is no.
We have to look at ways to cut costs," Rice said.
The provost stressed that the only way to ensure a

stable budget is to be very watchful.
"We are very pleased with the stable situation, but
we have to be very vigilant and constantly looking for
ways to cut costs," she said. "Every dollar that subsi
dizes an activity is a dollar taken away from teaching
and research, which are the central purposes of a uni
versity."
In other areas, both the review of Housing and
Dining Services and the Task Force on Resident Pro
grams and Student Housing for Undergraduates will
report to Rice. The dining service task force is sched
uled to report in a few weeks, and the housing task
force should have recommendations by the end spring
quarter.
The task force on housing, which was convened at
the request of University President Gerhard Casper,
will evaluate the system of housing assignment and
the relationship between residential education pro
grams and undergraduate housing.
The committee will examine a number of housing
issues, including giving upperclassmen priority in the
Draw as they progress toward graduation and creat
ing more all-freshman dorms, Rice said. Currently,
she added, the demand for all-freshman housing ex
ceeds availability by more than 300 beds.
"This is a major review," she said. "It will look at
the cost structure of how we are organized and take a
look at all elements of the Draw."
The task force is chaired bv Vice Provost for Un-
dergraduate Education Ramon
Saldivar and includes three staff
members, three faculty members
and three students.
The task force on Housing and
Dining Services, which was creat
ed at the request of the provost last
winter, is examining such issues as
the price of student meals and cap
ital improvements of dormitories.
The Provost's Office has also
been involved with the develop
ment of the Academic Planning
Project advisory board.
The board, created last Janu
ary, assists in long-range planning
for the University and studies a
number of issues, including the
University's approach to budget
ing.
Rice said that the board has
paid particular attention to tuition
issues.
"We have to worry about people
who are paying tuition and not
have tuition outpace people's abili
ty to pay," she said.
