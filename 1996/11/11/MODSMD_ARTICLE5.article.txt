# Students react to 209 vote

### Kori Wen 
Dissatisfaction and unrest circulated through
campus last week in response to the passage of
Proposition 209, which eliminates preferential treat
ment in California's public sector.
To college students, Prop. 209 means an end to the
use of race, ethnicity, sex or national origin as one of
the supplemental criteria for selecting public univer
sity members from a pool of eligible students.
Seventy-six percent of voters at the 11 Stanford
polling stations voted against Prop. 209, leaving a
small minority in favor of it. This large discrepancy
did not reflect the rest of Santa Clara County, in
which 50.3 percent of the 462,312 ballots were cast
against the legislation.
"I'm glad that Stanford students see the benefits
of affirmative action," said junior Cindy Urquidez, a
strong proponent of campus-wide activism and a
member of the Stop Prop. 209 group. "Unfortunate
ly, this was not true on the state level. I hope [those]
students continue with the mentality that they voted

with.
Responding to the outcome of Stanford students
voting, senior Felipe Barragan, a MEChA officer
said, "That's great. It's an indication of the work
done by students to get the truth out about the
proposition. It's not only the women and minorities
who are affected."
The proposition "was deceptive," he said, "and
once people saw the truth underneath the wording,
they voted against it."
University President Gerhard Casper reaffirmed
Thursday that as a private school, Stanford's policies
will not be affected in anv way bv the passage of Prop.
209.
However, fully aware of the repercussions of the
legislation, concerned students assembled in the
basement of Casa Zapata late Thursday night to or
ganize action against the implementation of Prop.
209.
