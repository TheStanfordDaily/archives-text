# LGB visibility, use of symbols debated

Controversy surrounding what seemed to be
a harmless Monday night social for gays, les
bians and bisexuals at the Coffee House was the
subject of a Friday forum put on by the Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Community Center.
The weekly Monday night social, which is not

sponsored by the center, "was just an idea to
meet people," said graduate student Benjamin
Lawrance, who orchestrated the event early in
the quarter. He later realized people had a diffi
cult time finding the social in the crowded Cof
fee House, so he attempted to make the group
more visible.
"All I could find was this pink paper. I just
folded it into a triangle and put it on the table. I

realized people couldn't find [the social] and
that's what I did," Lawrance said.
One member of the community, who did not
attend the forum, was very upset by the display
of the pink triangle at the social and sent an e
mail to the community center's mailing list last
week condemning it. This began a barrage of e-
mail on the list debating the issue.
"I saw the Monday night social
as maybe not the most comfortable
place," said junior Courtney Lake,
volunteer coordinator for the cen
ter. "But was it viable for someone
to say, 'Can you be less visible?' "
A medical student, who pre
ferred to remain anonymous, tried
to make the group understand why
gays, lesbians and bisexuals may
not want to be visible in the com
munity.
"They're not visible so [they
think] they're not good enough to
sit with you," he said. "I know that
was never the intention. Having
gone through this paranoid phase, I
can see where some people wouldn't
want to be associated with the pink
triangle."
The discussion turned toward
the use of the word "queer" as a
label, as well as other symbols de
noting homo- or bisexuality, like
the pink triangle and the rainbow.
"Symbols are also misappropri
ated," Lawrance said. "We really
don't know how many people at
Stanford know what the pink tri
angle means or what the rainbow
means.
"It's just a matter of choosing
something that someone in the

know can recognize," he said.
The discussion later expanded
to the overall visibility of gays, les
bians and bisexuals on campus.
"With every person, there's a
gradient of visibility," Lawrance
said. "I'm certainly not comfortable
being visible in church. Comfort at
all costs is the most important
thing."
The center's adviser, Troy
Gilbert, disagreed.
"I don't think that comfort at all
costs is the most important thing.
The only reason I can go to a gay
bar whenever I want to is because
people have chosen to go before me
visibly in uncomfortable ways,"
Gilbert said.
Assoc. Dean for Religious Life
Maurice Charles, who also was at
the meeting, said he had to decide
whether it was an ethical impera
tive to be visible and open about his
sexuality.
"In my profession, the second I
walk through the door [of the cen
ter], I become an activist. Being out
I think in some respects is a privi
lege. Some people don't have that
privilege.
"I still feel pushed by an impera
tive that it is necessary to do this,"
Charles said. "I'm not sure that
personal comfort is the only criteri
on."
The socials will still be held
Monday nights at the Coffee
House, minus the pink triangle.
