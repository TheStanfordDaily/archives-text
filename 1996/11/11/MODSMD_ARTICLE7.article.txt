Bloomingdale's has arrived.
The store — an upscale
mecca of designer labels and cut
ting-edge fashion that hails
from New York — opened with
much fanfare Friday in the
Stanford Shopping Center,
drawing eager shoppers from as
far away as Seattle. It is the first
branch of the department store
to open on the West Coast.
Even before the doors opened
at 10 a.m., shoppers mobbed the
main entrance, and hundreds
more were lined up at the east
and west-side entrances.
Spirits were high as 30-foot
streamers sailed in the air, life
size "big brown hags" danced and
the Menlo-Atherton High School
Jazz Band provided live music for
the enthusiastic crowd.
Bloomingdale's President


Michelle Liu - Daily
Nick Graham, more commonly known as Joe Boxer, makes a special appearance at the opening of the
first Northern California Bloomingdale's at the Stanford Shopping Center Friday.
JefTSherman, California Gov. Pete
Wilson's wife, Gail, Palo Alto
Mayor Lanie Wheeler and Store
Manager Lorraine O'Conner all
spoke briefly at the ribbon-cutting
ceremony that took place in front of
the main entrance before the doors
opened.
"I know you are all anxious to get
inside," Sherman said as he wel
comed and thanked all present.

Sherman told the crowd that the
"Bloomingdale's experience of New
York" will be an exciting one for
California shoppers.
Bloomingdale's is a store that
will "offer you everything you need
and has a staff of employees to
reach you and take care of you," he
said.
The Bloomingdale's at Stanford
is the first of five Bloomingdale's
scheduled to open in the West by
next March.
In her brief speech, Wilson wel
comed the department store to Cal
ifornia and commented that the

coming of Bloomingdale's to the
state gave her "great confidence
about the Californian economy."
Wheeler also expressed a hearty
welcome to the emporium.
"I am delighted to welcome
Bloomingdale's to our city," she
said. "Palo Alto is a very special
community; it is now even more
special because of Bloomingdale's."
O'Conner closed her short
speech with a cheerful shout,
"Today is our Superbowl," and the
crowd poured in the doors as the
ribbon was finally cut. The jazz
band, dressed in grand opening T

shirts and Bloomingdale's boxers
over their trousers, drummed up a
happy note for the shoppers.
"We came because the Stanford
Band canceled out," Menlo-Ather
ton senior Tylor Baron said. He
added that he was ready to check
out the store after the performance.
Customers seemed satisfied
with what they found inside.
"This is kind of neat," said Mal
lory Lee, as she picked up a mint
green cashmere sweater with a dan
gling price tag for $480. Lee had
come shopping with her friends.
"It's nice," shopper Lydia Lopez

said. "It's open, it's friendly, and the
prices are about average."
"We were going to fly down here
last week to see our daughter and
grandchildren," said shoppers
Michael and Diana Sawyer, who
flew in to San Francisco yesterday
from their home in Seattle. "But we
decided to delay it a week because
we heard Bloomingdale's was open
ing this weekend."
Together with the new J. Crew
store in the mall, which opened
Thursday, Bloomingdale's hopes to
be a main attraction for Stanford
shoppers.
