# Time to fill lots of big brown bags

Bloomingdale's has arrived.
The store — an upscale
mecca of designer labels and cut
ting-edge fashion that hails
from New York — opened with
much fanfare Friday in the
Stanford Shopping Center,
drawing eager shoppers from as
far away as Seattle. It is the first
branch of the department store
to open on the West Coast.
Even before the doors opened
at 10 a.m., shoppers mobbed the
main entrance, and hundreds
more were lined up at the east
and west-side entrances.
Spirits were high as 30-foot
streamers sailed in the air, life
size "big brown hags" danced and
the Menlo-Atherton High School
Jazz Band provided live music for
the enthusiastic crowd.
