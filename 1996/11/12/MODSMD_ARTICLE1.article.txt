### David Stein Staff writer 
The future of Stanford fast food is here after Polio
Rey, the Mexican restaurant which promises to spice
up Tresidder Union, celebrated its grand openingyes
terday.
Amid the blaring of the Stanford Band and the
eager clucking of a man dressed as a yellow chicken,
Polio's opened its doors to throngs of students hungry
for reasonably priced Mexican food.
Although the restaurant opened Saturday, Polio's
marked yesterday as its official entry into the Stan
ford community. It will be open 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sun

day through Thursday and will extend its closing time
to 2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday.
At noon yesterday, a ribbon-cutting ceremony toot
place in the Tresidder courtyard in front of Polio's
Throughout the day, coupons for free food were hand
ed out, while movie passes were distributed to the firsi
50 customers.
Dan Zemanek, president of Santa Fe Chicken Inc.
the company that created Polio's, could barely con
tain his enthusiasm before the restaurant's opening.
"We're really excited about all of this," said Ze
manek, waving his hand to indicate the restaurant's

brightly-colored, Mexico-inspired
interior. "Everyone has worked so
hard for this day and we're so happy
about becoming part of the Stan
ford community."
Zemanek said he has already re
ceived inquiries about using Polio's
for parties and study sessions.
"We aim to provide an atmos
phere of fun, wholesome food and
good times for everyone," Zemanek
said.
Senior Josh Elman and sopho
more Kevin Stults, who waited out
side Polio's before the opening, ex
pressed the same level of excite
ment as Zemanek.
"The food is a lot better than you
can get at dining halls and at a much
lower price than you can get at a lot
of restaurants," Elman said.
Stults added that a Polio's meal
can be purchased for less than $3,
while most options at the Coffee
House, another food provider at
Tresidder, cost about $5.
"Food here (at Polio's) is cheap,
and that's important for college
kids," Stults said.
Zemanek agreed, saying Polio's

has altered its menu to accommo
date the budgets of Stanford stu
dents. Polio's offers tamales for 99
cents, and part of its menu is called
"El Cheapos."
In addition to the value items on
the menu, Polio's offers a range of
traditional Mexican cuisine includ
ing burritos, tacos, quesadillas and
nachos. Beer and wine will also be
served but not until the end of the
week, according to a sign on the
front counter.
Polio's hopes to attract students
through its student-friendly envi
ronment, Zemanek said.
He explained that the large room
in the rear of the restaurant, com
plete with two cable televisions,
would be an ideal place for students
to gather.
Elman was thrilled to watch
ESPN's Sports Center while enjoy
ing his first breakfast at Polio's yes
terday.
"Polio's is great, much better
than Taco Bell," he said.
In fact, plans had been made to
open a Taco Bell in Tresidder. Stu
dent protests and financial consid
erations contributed to the decision
to bring Polio's to campus instead.
Polio's opening signals another
step in the ongoing face-lift of
Tresidder.
