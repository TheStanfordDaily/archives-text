That naughty 'n-word'
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Then-word used by a Texaco
Inc. executive was "Nicholas" and not a racial slur, an investiga
tor hired by the company to electronically enhance a tape of the
conversation said yesterday.
Company Chairman Peter Bijur said the finding doesn't
change the "unacceptable context and tone" of the recorded con
versation.
Plaintiffs in a $520 million discrimination lawsuit against
Texaco claim former Texaco treasurer Robert Ulrich said "(exple
tive) niggers" during a 1994 discussion of the suit among compa
ny executives.
The comments have brought withering criticism against Tex
aco, and black leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, have
threatened a boycott unless they remedy the discrimination
alleged by the 1,400 minority employees.
A federal grand jury is investigating whether executives ille
gally destroyed documents on minority hiring — a plan discussed
during the tape-recorded conversation, according to the lawsuit.
