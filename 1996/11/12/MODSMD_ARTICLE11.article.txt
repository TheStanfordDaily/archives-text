# Rebel leader allows aid into Zaire
## 
### 
GOMA, Zaire (AP) — After long
delays at the Zaire-Rwanda border,
16 trucks and jeeps packed with
food and medicine arrived yester
day at the local soccer stadium,
where aid workers haggled with
rebel leaders over which supplies
should go to each of Goma's three
hospitals.
Just across the road, at the
main hospital, doctors were desper
ate for any drugs or medical equip
ment — and despairing that what
ever aid they do receive cannot pos
sibly be enough.
"We're in a sad state," said Dr.
Patrick Baluba, the hospital's tech
nical director. "More than half my
staff has fled into the forests, and
I'm having to turn away many
patients because I don't have the

right drugs to treat them."
Shelling wrecked his last ambu
lance. He's running out of antibi
otics. And wounded Rwandan
refugees fleeing a rebel offensive
two weeks ago looted his remaining
stretchers, wheelchairs and operat
ing tables.
Rebel leader Laurent Kabila
agreed over the weekend to allow
aid agencies into Zaire, where
fighting between Tutsi rebels and
Zairian troops has uprooted more
than 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu
refugees, nearly 150,000 Burundi
an Hutu refugees and an unknown
number of Zairians.
The aid arriving yesterday was
enough to feed 2,500 people for a
week, a fraction of Goma's 80,000
remaining residents, manv of

whom have had no access to fresh
food for 10 days. And without mili
tary protection, there was no hope
of getting aid to the hundreds of
thousands of refugees who fled
west without food or water.
"The longer we wait, the more
serious it gets," said Samantha
Bolton, spokeswoman for Doctors
Without Borders, one of 12 groups
that managed to get supplies in
yesterday after a long delay at the
Rwandan-Zairian border. Many
foreign aid workers fled the region
more than a week ago.
Townsfolk were selling
bananas, onions and cabbages at a
roadside market, and bread rolls in
plastic sacks were strung up in
rickety kiosks. But prices were too
high for most.

"We still have clients, but
nobody has money to buy much
more than bread and beans," said
Alain Bailly at the Chez Greg bak
ery. "The situation is catastrophic."
Go ma's main hospital has no
electricity or running water. Its 40
patients lie in rancid-smelling
wards, their dressings grubby,
their faces lined with expressions
of despair.
"I'm having to turn people away
because I have not even anti
malaria or anti-diarrhea drugs,"
Baluba said. "We'll accept any help
— we have no choice now but to
live from aid."
Baluba said only 80 of his 180
stafT had not fled the fighting, and
those working have not been paid
for months.
