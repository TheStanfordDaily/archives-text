Polio's is very promising,
but Tresidder needs more
work to be a 'real' union

WELL, THE SAGA is finally
over. After more than
three years of failed nego
tiations and missed deadlines,
Tresidder Union is at last home to a
fast-food Mexican restaurant — and
what a restaurant it is.
Tresidder's newest addition, the
"original Mexican rotisserie"
known as Polio Rey, celebrated its
grand opening yesterday amid
much fanfare and free food. A
human-size yellow chicken handed
out complimentary T-shirts and
water bottles while the Stanford
Band staged an impromptu
lunchtime concert.
Patrons oohed and aahed over
the restaurant's funky, colorful
decor and enthusiastically taste
tested the menu's offerings. Burri
tos, quesadillas and soft tacos flew
off the grill and into customers'
eager hands.
The mood was festive, to say the
least, and rightly so.
The Stanford community has
waited years for this marvelous
event.
Seniors, think back to your
freshman year and remember the
repeated promises you heard of
"Oh, Taco Bell will open any day
now," and then later: "Well, maybe
next month ..." Juniors probably
heard the Taco Bell myth early in
their Stanford career, but even then
the chances of getting the restau
rant on campus looked pretty dim.
And sophomores certainly remem
ber the hoopla last spring when
student environmental leaders
organized a protest against the pro
posed Taco Bell because its parent
company, PepsiCo, invested in
Burma.
In short, it's about time Tresid
der got a fast-food Mexican restau
rant. The Tresidder Advisory
Board, Dean of Students Marc Wais
and the Stanford Management Co.

deserve credit for following through
on this project and finally bringing
it to fruition.
Polio's will add a lot to the
Tresidder experience. Obviously, it
will give patrons more dining
options — after all, how many Cof
fee House sandwiches can any one
person eat in a lifetime, no matter
how good they may be?
The new restaurant will also
improve the union's social atmo
sphere: Tresidder can finally
become a "real" student union — a
place that entices students with
good food and a collegial atmo
sphere, all for an affordable price.
Polio's is obviously trying to ful
fill this mission, and it looks like the
restaurant's efforts will meet with
success. The televisions in the back
of the restaurant should draw a
healthy crowd for Monday Night
Football, "Friends" and other popu
lar weekly programs. And if man
agers bring good bands to the
restaurant, that will further draw
'em in.
The restaurant has other pluses,
as well. The food is reasonably
priced and it's fairly healthy. And
the restaurant's late hours — until
2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday and
11 p.m. every other night — will
appeal to students' hectic schedules.
But before we get too busy pat
ting ourselves on the back, let's not
forget that the makeover of Tresid
der is nowhere near done. What
about the promised juice bar? When
is Juice Club (our preferred choice)
going to open? The timeline had
better not mirror the ill-fated Taco
Bell's.
Also, the advisory board needs to
figure out what to do with the area
that Pulse Copy Center previously
occupied. The board might want to
consider a bagel shop, such as
Noah's. While the combination of
Polio's, Juice Club and Noah's
might be a little too "yuppie" for
some to bear, you have to admit that
is where most students go.
So, here's the bottom line: Good
job with Polio's but don't forget that
there's more to be done.
