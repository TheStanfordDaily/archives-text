## In search of a caring prof 
### 
Last Friday evening, i was
privileged enough to be invited to a
reception honoring stellar profes
sors for stellar professing. The ceremony
began with: "This professor truly values
the student." Followed by: "With professor
X, students are key players in his
research." Then we have: "Professor Y
cares about the undergraduate; he's really
made a mark on students' lives."
Bizarre. Stanford professors that actu
ally care about undergraduates? Many stu
dents would argue that the only marks
that professors leave on our lives come in
the forms of A's, B's and C's. So where on
this God-forsaken campus are all those
dynamic, full-fledged, tenured professors
that actually give a damn about under
graduates?
Perhaps we disinterest them. We
undergraduates must appear as simple
tons to these intellectual giants, concerned
with silly things like law school rankings
and cheap beer — while they figure out
ways of making office hours as confusing
and incomprehensible as the overly erudite
language in their latest book.
How many times have you gone to your
professor's office hours and felt like you
were on a totally different wavelength?
Often considered the hope for student-fac
ulty relations, office hours serve as a
forum for one-on-one interaction between
the student and one of Stanford's best and
brightest stars.
I'd say it's more of a sadist's wet dream.
As soon as the discussion shifts from

aggregate demand curves or Hobbesian
philosophies to say ... real-world issues,
the torture begins: "So, professor, do ya'
think the Suns can eclipse the Rockets this
year?"
"I beg your pardon, Mr. Grundy?" he
replies. "I don't believe there will be a solar
eclipse this year."
"Uhh, never mind," I reply. "It's all
good!"
I'll save that bit for the teaching assis
tants.
Much like saints serve as intermedi
aries between the pious and the divine,
TAs act as the go-betweens with regard to
students and professors. Closer to the
undergraduate than the stuffy, esoteric
academic, TAs are not merely teaching
assistants; they are our professors.
Professors should ask themselves:
"Who do I know better: my students or my
publishers?" And students should ask:
"Who do I know better: my professor or my
TA?" In either case, if it is the latter, then
there is something seriously wrong with
that wonderful faculty-student relation
ship that is so nicely packaged in
"Approaching Stanford."
Hell, I don't even know who will write
my law school recommendations next year.
Most schools demand at least three, and
I can only think of one post-CIV professor
on this entire campus that really knows
Garry Grundy. Only one. And she will tell
you that I am hardly an introvert.
This makes me question the value of a
professor's recommendation. Does it really

mean anything? What can a prof, say: "He
came to class; he spoke up; I gave him a
B+; for more information, contact
Okhmed the TA." So what seems to occu
py the time of our world-class faculty to
the point that they don't even know their
students anymore?
Publishing.
Rather than demanding that our pro
fessors crank out a cutting-edge text
every week, Stanford should require that
professors get to really know students —
not just how they write, but what their
feelings are toward politics, music ...
even sports. I want proof that professors
are human!
I must admit, I've been fairly lucky. I
have at least one friend and mentor on the
Stanford faculty. Many students don't
even have that. Working with the TA, my
special prof, develops relationships with
students that can never be confused. It's
even customary for her to have students
over to her house for Thanksgiving dinner
— all this and she manages to publish too!
She is never so caught up in the academic
role that she forgets her primary obliga
tion.
It sure as hell ain't Cambridge Univer
sity Press.
