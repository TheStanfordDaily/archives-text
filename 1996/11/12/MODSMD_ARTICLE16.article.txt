Daily editorial inaccurately portrays Econ Dept.

I WOULD LIKE the opportunity to
respond to Wednesday's editorial
concerning the Economics Depart
ment. While I appreciate your willing
ness to contact me and take into
account some of the points I made, I
feel your editorial mischaracterizes the
situation in our department and conse
quently does a disservice to your read
ers.
First, you give the impression that
relations between students and faculty
are adversarial and that the depart
ment is not responsive to students'
needs. This is simply not true. As I
explained, we did face some one-time
uncertainties that made it difficult to
serve students optimally this year,
particularly in the fall quarter. Howev
er, when students came to us with par

ticular requests we made every effort
to accommodate them. In addition to
adding the two courses you mention,
we created an extra section of Econ
101 in the fall as we have done in
every recent case where there was
excess demand.
Second, I would like to point out a
number of factors beyond our control
that have made it particularly difficult
for the department to carry out its mis
sion. We are a very popular major and
must deal with large class sizes. Much
as we might like to expand our teach
ing faculty (and we are always pushing
our case!), the potential is quite limited
for reasons exposited by my colleague,
Economics Prof. Tim Bresnahan, on
this page last Friday.
One of our strategies to deal with
large numbers is to create a few limit-

Ed-enrollment classes so that majors
will have access to at least one or two
small-group experiences. Naturally,
such classes are quite demanding on
our resources, and it is very costly to
us if they are undersubscribed. These
factors interact with institutional pecu
liarities at Stanford in a way that may
sometimes make us look unresponsive.
Because Stanford does not have prereg
istration, it is extremely difficult for us
to predict enrollments. Further, the
University has a shortage of class
rooms, particularly of the size large
enough for our classes and at the times
that both students and faculty prefer.
Consequently we have problems, par
ticularly in fall quarter, in scheduling
the right number of offerings and get
ting them into the right-sized class
rooms. If students want to lobby the

University on these dimensions, we
would be delighted to join the cam
paign.
Finally, I must take issue with your
criticism of our staff. They are a dedi
cated group who work hard and really
care about students. They do the best
they can to serve the department
under trying conditions, some of which
I have outlined above. If you pop into
the economics office at a random
moment, you may find a chaotic frenzy
of activity, but I have never heard any
one call it "lackadaisical." In any case,
if there are particular complaints about
staff, I would expect to have them
brought to the chair's office rather
than read about them first in a Daily
editorial.
