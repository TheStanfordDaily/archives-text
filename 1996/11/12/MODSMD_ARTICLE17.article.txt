# Dean of students owed thanks for beginning to overhaul Tresidder
## 
### 
I was just sitting in my chair think
ing and realized that someone has been
taking a little too much punishment
lately. Even though he is completely
inept when it comes to forming a real
istic alcohol policy, Dean of Students
Marc Wais is not a waste of life or even
a waste of a job; he has indeed succeed
ed where others have failed.
Hard to believe? Maybe, but it
should be even easier to swallow (liter
ally) now that Polio's has opened in
Tresidder Union — something that
should even please the "we-have-to
protest-EVERYTHING"-Burma-"Taco-
Bell-sucks" advocates.
When I first visited Stanford, Tresid
der looked so cool, but it didn't take one
week of Orientation to learn only to go

there if I missed weekend brunch due to
a late-night / late-morning sleep. How
ever, this year, largely credited to Wais'
efforts, Tresidder is finally becoming
that cool hang out that only months
before was no more than a dream.
Just in case you haven't missed brunch
yet, the new and improved Tresidder fea
tures better lighting and more seats;
granted, half of them are fold-out plastic
things, but still, it's not that bad. Polio's
is there now and a juice bar should arrive
soon. If I didn't know any better, I would
think that this was actually progress
we're witnessing.
I would go on to list more of Wais'
accomplishments, but to be honest, I have
no idea what else he does on campus. But
hey: One for two isn't bad, is it? It even
gets us by in most classes with a curve.
I guess the thing to remember is to
thank Wais and the other people of
Stanford that help make it the special
place that it really is. Of course, if
Odwalla beats out Juice Club for the
smoothie spot I'll be the first one after

him with a bat, but the odds are that
won't happen now, will it?
So until then, we should all try to be
gracious for what we have and those
that provide it.
