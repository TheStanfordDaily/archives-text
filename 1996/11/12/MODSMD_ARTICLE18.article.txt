# Casper's pledge to keep affirmative action is a model for other schools
## 
### 
Dear President Casper,
In the aftermath of the passage of
Proposition 209, we would like to thank
you for your efforts and actions in favor
of affirmative action. Your words assured
us that the University supports our
efforts at maintaining minority represen
tation in the academic and professional
levels of our society. We never felt that
we were at odds with our University, as

we did with the conservative factions of
society. Last fall you voiced your support
for affirmative action, and you reaf
firmed the University's position last
week. On both occasions you were never
compelled to defend affirmative action
policies on campus but did so on your
own integrity. Although we acknowledge
that you cannot directly influence other
universities, Stanford's position demon
strated that the UC regents' stance is
not unanimous among California univer
sities. We hope that other universities
look to Stanford as a role model against
social pressures. We trust that Stanford
will continue its commitment to diversity
in education beyond your tenure as pres
ident.
In gratitude,
