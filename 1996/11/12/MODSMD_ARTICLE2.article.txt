# Students want less of special fee back
## Refund rate drops 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
The total amount requested to
be refunded from ASSU special
fees for fall quarter declined
sharply from last year, according
to figures released yesterday.
This quarter's refund requests
amounted to 6.06 percent, or
$18,886.60 of the special-fee
funds given to student groups.
This represents a significant drop
in refund requests from last year,
when 13.9 percent was refunded.
The decrease in fees occurred
because of the reduction in the
number of groups receiving fund
ing, according to ASSU Financial
Manager John Hall.
Special fees, which appear
quarterly on each student's tu
ition bill, are used to subsidize
student groups that request fund
ing from the student population.
The requests are voted on during
the ASSU general elections in the

spring. Each quarter, students
can choose to have fees refunded
from any groups they do not wish
to support financially.
Total fees this year are signifi
cantly lower than they were last
fall. Instead of $35 — last year's
quarterly total — fees are $28 for
undergraduates and $20 for grad
uate students. Total fees request
ed have decreased from
$432,837.62 to $311,419.73.
Groups that lost funding dur
ing the election last year included
some of the pricier organizations:
KZSU, which requested a total of
$94,252.44 for the year, and the
Stanford Concert Network, which
requested a total of $55,546.43.
The Daily, which had previously
received a total of $55,505, chose
not to request a fee last year.
Refund money is paid out of
the refund buffer, which is includ
ed as part of each group's special
