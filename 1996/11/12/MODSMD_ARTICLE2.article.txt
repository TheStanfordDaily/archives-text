# Students want less of special fee back
## Refund rate drops 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
The total amount requested to
be refunded from ASSU special
fees for fall quarter declined
sharply from last year, according
to figures released yesterday.
This quarter's refund requests
amounted to 6.06 percent, or
$18,886.60 of the special-fee
funds given to student groups.
This represents a significant drop
in refund requests from last year,
when 13.9 percent was refunded.
The decrease in fees occurred
because of the reduction in the
number of groups receiving fund
ing, according to ASSU Financial
Manager John Hall.
Special fees, which appear
quarterly on each student's tu
ition bill, are used to subsidize
student groups that request fund
ing from the student population.
The requests are voted on during
the ASSU general elections in the

spring. Each quarter, students
can choose to have fees refunded
from any groups they do not wish
to support financially.
Total fees this year are signifi
cantly lower than they were last
fall. Instead of $35 — last year's
quarterly total — fees are $28 for
undergraduates and $20 for grad
uate students. Total fees request
ed have decreased from
$432,837.62 to $311,419.73.
Groups that lost funding dur
ing the election last year included
some of the pricier organizations:
KZSU, which requested a total of
$94,252.44 for the year, and the
Stanford Concert Network, which
requested a total of $55,546.43.
The Daily, which had previously
received a total of $55,505, chose
not to request a fee last year.
Refund money is paid out of
the refund buffer, which is includ
ed as part of each group's special
fee request. Buffer rates are cal
culated based on refund rates
from previous years. The refund
buffer can not constitute more
than 25 percent of an organiza
tion's fee request.
More students ask for more re
funds when student groups are
highly visible and are addressing
controversial issues, according to
Hall.
"The refund rate often fluctu
ates according to political activi
ty," he said.
This year also marked the first

time groups were allowed to
choose to request fees from the
undergraduate and graduate pop
ulations independently or from
both populations.
Graduate students traditionally
request fee refunds in higher num
bers than undergraduates. Gradu
ate students made up 79 percent of
students asking for refunds this
year and 80.3 percent last year.
"When you take into account
changes in the funding system
and the reduced number of
groups [receiving funding], the
refund rates are comparable to
last year," said Hall.
The most refunded groups this
year were the Stanford Band,
Club Sports and the ASSU Pro

gram Board. However, the refund
rate for the Band, 7.6 percent, is
actually less than the least-re
funded group last year, ASSU
Legal Counseling, which had a
8.37 percent refund rate.
Despite the Band's position as
the most-refunded group, Stan
ford Band Manager Josh Schiller
remained optimistic
"I'm glad to see that refunds
are down this year," said Schiller,
a senior. "Decrease is an indicator
that more people are enjoying
what we do, and we're funny to
more people than just ourselves.
"Someone has to come in last, I
just wish it wasn't us. But, our
performance this fall will warrant
fewer refunds next quarter."
