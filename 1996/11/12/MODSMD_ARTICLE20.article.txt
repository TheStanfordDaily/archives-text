"Girls Town," a film involving young women in
New York confronted with complicated issues of
friendship, violence, victimization and isolationism,
is coming to Stanford tonight.
The film, an October Films motion picture, will be
shown in Cubberley Auditorium at 8 p.m. It is spon
sored by the Stanford Film Society.
Following the preview, high school students from
Menlo Park and East Palo Alto involved with the
Stanford Upward Bound and Educational Studies
programs will join dorm discussion groups.
The critically acclaimed film won an award at the
Sundance Film Festival but was only in a theaters for
a very brief time, said senior Debra Solomon, a fdm
society board member.
Solomon said "Girls Town" was an ideal film to
bring to Stanford because "a lot of students who
would've liked to see the movie didn't get a chance."
Junior Jonathan Levitt, president of the Film So
ciety, agreed that "Girls Town" is an important pic

ture to watch and reflect on. He described violence in
"Girls Town" as the most important topic of the film.
"This is an issue in the fdm pertaining to high
school girls, but this is obviously also just as much of
an issue for college women," he said.
Levitt said the interaction between the three
main characters is the most significant aspect of the
film. "We hope that people think about the impor
tant issues brought up in the film, not only in the or
ganized discussions but also in informal discussions
which will hopefully occur," he added.
Last year, the film society received positive feed
back after screening the movie "Kids."
"We're hoping to do a similar thing," said
Solomon.
"Girls Town" is just one in a series of films the
film society plans to bring to campus this year.
"Generation Exodus," a film involving young Jew
ish adults feeling detached from religion, will be
screened by the films society in Building 300,
Room 300 on Thursday at 7 p.m. The film's direc
tor, Aaron Lubarsky, is scheduled to make an ap
pearance.
