## Water everywhere Crew challenged in Seattle regatta 
### Blake Thompson 
The men's and women's var
sity crew teams continued to
improve their positions at the
Head of the Lake regatta in
Seattle last weekend. A few
minor adjustments on both
sides, and the teams look to be in
good position for their final reg
ular season regatta in San Mateo
and for the spring season.
After a two-hour delay on
Sunday, the women's varsity
eight team placed third in the
12-team race, finishing only
three seconds behind Pacific 10
Conference rival Oregon State.
The women finished in a time of
18 minutes, 33 seconds over the
5,000-meter course, behind
defending Pac-10 champions
Washington in 18:04 and Ore
gon State in second in 18:30.
The University of British
Columbia was fourth in 18:37,
and Washington State finished
fifth in 18:43.
The Cardinal started behind
Oregon State and in front of
Washington State. The boats are
supposed to start 15 seconds
apart but are not always on
time, which sometimes makes it
harder for the boat that happens
to start late.
The women gave chase to the
Beavers and were pushed by
Washington State from behind
to finish in the top three.

"I was hoping to race at least
for second and maybe push
Washington a little," said coach
Aimee Baker. But the Cardinal
was rowing at a lower stroke
rate than the other teams in the
field, about two to four beats
lower than most of the boats,
according to Baker. The Card
only does this low stroke rate in
the fall season.
Come spring, when the Cardi
nal employs its higher stroke
rate, the Cardinal should have a
better chance to finish ahead of
Oregon State and challenge
Washington.
The women showed dramatic
improvement over last year's
results against these same
teams. They closed the gap on
Washington from 43 seconds
last year to 29 seconds this year
and defeated Washington State
by 10 seconds on Sunday after
finishing 12 seconds behind the
Cougars last year.
"I feel pretty good, consider
ing the stroke rate and fog and
everything," Baker said. "We'll
get them in the spring."
The women race again in San
Mateo on Nov. 24 in the race
they've really been focusing on
this year. Stanford will face Cal
ifornia, who the Cardinal defeat
ed by only 5 seconds late last
month in Oakland. Baker is hop
ing to "put a little distance"
between the Stanford boat and
the Bears' boat to build confi
dence heading into winter train
ing and the spring season.
At the regatta in Seattle, the
men looked to be headed toward
a similarly good race and an
excellent duel with rival Oregon
State when they ran into some
bad luck. The Card started in the
fourth position behind Washing
ton, the University of Victoria
and Oregon State, but after
gaining water on Oregon State
at the 1,000-meter mark, the
skeg of the boat completely dis
lodged.
The skeg is the part of the
boat which controls the steering,
so once it was dislodged the boat
lost its ability to steer. After
veering off track, the team had
to stop rowing for the coxswain
to get the boat back on track,
and once they started again it
was "like driving a car without a
steering wheel," according to co
captain Matt Miller.
"We finished with an OK

time, but we had the ability to do
a lot better," he said.
Up to that point, the team
had felt optimistic as the men
were in the midst of one of the
best rows they had enjoyed all
year, according to Miller. The
team was moving smoothly with
good rhythm while gaining
water on Oregon State?
"Up until the time when we
had breakage, we were feeling
pretty solid," said junior Jamie
MacQuarrie.
With a young boat and not a
lot of racing experience, the
team was looking for its first
indicator of what this year's
crew could do. "It was kind of
disappointing this weekend, but
you have to take the good things
and move on," MacQuarrie said.
The men look to San Mateo
on Nov. 24 for their only true
indicator of the fall season. Cali
fornia remains the men's biggest
rival, and San Mateo will give
the Cardinal its first glimpse of
the Bears this year. The team is
not expecting to be discouraged
by this weekend's performance.
"We knew we were going to do
well and we were rowing well, it
was just a freak thing," Miller
said.
