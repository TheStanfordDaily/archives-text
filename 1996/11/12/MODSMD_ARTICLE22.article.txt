# Wrestlers start off on right track

### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
The wrestling team began its
season at home Friday by solidly
defeating UC-Davis by a score of
35-6, which included three major
decisions (victory by eight or more
points) and two pins.
UC-Davis got off to an early
lead when Tim Lee recorded a 7-4
win at 118 pounds over Stanford
freshman Rudy Ruiz. The Cardi
nal bounced back quickly, howev
er, with pins by sophomore Zac
Zimmerman at 126 pounds and
sophomore Beau Weiner at 142
pounds.
Zimmerman's match was fairly
even until his opponent made a
crucial mistake that gave the
scrappy 126-pounder an opening,
which Zimmerman capitalized on
by pinning his Aggie opponent.
"I just threw him to his back
and stuck him," Zimmerman said.
"As a team, I think we put UC-
Davis through a lot of mental
pain."
Werner's match remained close
into the third round, until UC-
Davis' Oliver Salud shot in on
Weiner's legs, going for the take
down. Thinking he had received
the points on Weiner, Salud
relaxed for a split second, allowing
Weiner to scramble, throw Salud
down and pin him.
"I'm not really sure what I did
to pin him," Weiner said. "It was a
weird scramble situation, definite
ly not something I've done before."
The victory for Weiner, a trans
fer from UC-Davis, was a huge lift
for the Cardinal, setting the tone
for the rest of the match. It was

also a personal victory for Weiner
to beat a former teammate and
UC-Davis' best wrestler.
Other Stanford winners who
won by major decisions were junior
Robert Hatta at 134 pounds, 13-5;
sophomore B.J. Sanchez at 150
pounds, 11-3; and junior Scott
Chapman at 177 pounds, 12-2.
Senior Ryan Barnes beat his oppo
nent at 158 pounds by a decision of
11-7, and senior Bryan Vaniman
eked out a close one at 190 pounds,
4-3.
At 167 pounds, junior Jeff
Grant got a technical fall over his
opponent 18-3, and at heavy
weight, senior Chris Serjak lost a
close match 3-1.
This season Stanford brings a
young team to the mat but one
which looks to surprise opponents
with its untapped talent.
Although Zimmerman did not
start for Stanford last season, he is
a three-time state champion in
Montana and epitomizes the young
talent that is looking to define the
Cardinal this year.
"It's good just to get the first
match of the season under my

belt," Zimmerman said. "As a new
guy on the team, it's really nice to
be a part of such domination."
Though the Cardinal whipped
UC-Davis on Friday, the team is
young and inexperienced overall
and still has to prove itself. Last
yejir's graduating class included
four NCAA qualifiers, two Pacific
10 Conference champions arid one
All-American, leaving many of the
younger players who saw only lim
ited action last year to carry a lot of
the weight for the team.
"This is the first year in over a
decade that we return no NCAA
qualifiers or Pac-10 place winners
from the previous season," said
Stanford coach Chris Horpel.
"This would normally give me
some cause for concern, but our
team is really coming together.
They are working very hard and
have so much enthusiasm that I
fully expect them to win most of
their matches this fall."
The solid win against UC-Davis
was the first step in the direction
that the wrestlers expect to head.
"We're a team that's relatively
young," Weiner said. "But we've
got a lot of talent and potential. If
everyone wrestles as well as they
have in practice, we could have a
very successful season."
