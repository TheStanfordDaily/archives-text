The wrestling team began its
season at home Friday by solidly
defeating UC-Davis by a score of
35-6, which included three major
decisions (victory by eight or more
points) and two pins.
UC-Davis got off to an early
lead when Tim Lee recorded a 7-4
win at 118 pounds over Stanford
freshman Rudy Ruiz. The Cardi
nal bounced back quickly, howev
er, with pins by sophomore Zac
Zimmerman at 126 pounds and
sophomore Beau Weiner at 142
pounds.
Zimmerman's match was fairly
even until his opponent made a
crucial mistake that gave the
scrappy 126-pounder an opening,
which Zimmerman capitalized on
by pinning his Aggie opponent.
"I just threw him to his back
and stuck him," Zimmerman said.
"As a team, I think we put UC-
Davis through a lot of mental
pain."
Werner's match remained close
into the third round, until UC-
Davis' Oliver Salud shot in on
Weiner's legs, going for the take
down. Thinking he had received
the points on Weiner, Salud
relaxed for a split second, allowing
Weiner to scramble, throw Salud
down and pin him.
"I'm not really sure what I did
to pin him," Weiner said. "It was a
weird scramble situation, definite
ly not something I've done before."
The victory for Weiner, a trans
fer from UC-Davis, was a huge lift
for the Cardinal, setting the tone
for the rest of the match. It was
