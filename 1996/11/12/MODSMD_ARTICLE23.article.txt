# Men golfers capture 12th at Nelson
## 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
Although the Stanford golf
team stood solidly in seventh
place with a combined score of
299 after round one of the Nel
son Invitational on Friday, the
team slipped in the last two
rounds to tie Auburn for 12th
place with a final score of 903 in
the tourney ending Sunday at
the Stanford Golf Course.
"The toughest thing about a
golf tournament is that immedi

ately after you score, your name
goes up on the scoreboard," said
coach Wally Goodwin. "You can
hide in football or basketball if
something goes wrong, but you
can't hide in golf."
"It was a mentally frustrat
ing tournament," said fresh
man Dusty Brett. "When you're
playing at home, you expect to
play well. We had hoped to fin
ish better, and we know we're
capable."
Despite a disappointing fin
ish for some squad members,

senior Conrad Ray stepped up
to lead the team, finishing fifth
in the tournament with two
even-par scores on separate
rounds of play.
"I pretty much hit the same
as I have all fall, but I was able
to avoid the high scores — I
didn't have any double bogeys
— and it helps to get rid of the
big numbers," Ray said.
"Although I had a slow start,
shooting bogeys on the first two
holes, I was happy with the way
I managed my game."

Ray was playing first in the
Cardinal lineup in the absence
of sophomore Joel Kribel. who
is competing in the prestigious
World Amateur Tournament in
the Philippines this week.
"Anytime you lose a guy like
Joel, it's going to create a real
dent in the team," Ray said.
"With Joel gone, we all had to
pick up our game, and I think
this was in the back of our
heads all weekend. I think being
first in the lineup also helped my
game because I play better when
I'm playing with better players."
"If Joel had been here, we
might have had a good chance of
winning the tournament," said
junior Jake Poe. "We were there
after the first day, but in the last
two days we struggled."
Perhaps one of the most diffi
cult aspects of the golf tourna
ment was the setup, which pre
sented problems for many
golfers.
"With the way the course was
set up, you could pretty much
add on a couple of strokes any
time you put the ball in the
rough, and if you missed the fair
way, sometimes you couldn't hit
the green," Brett said. However,
the conditions could not have
been better.
"I've probably played more
rounds on this course than any
one on the team, and the course
was in better shape for a tourna
ment than I've ever seen it," Ray
said. The weather was also near
perfect, without any strong
winds.
With a three-month break
before their next tournament,
the Cardinal golfers know what
they have to accomplish in the
off season.
"This time of year it doesn't
make much of a difference how
we do, but it's good to get a look
at what we can do," Goodwin
said.
In sharp contrast to last sea
son, the success of this year's
team depends much less on star
players and more on a group
effort. The fourth and fifth men
on the squad play a much larger
role in the team's outcome this
year.
"All things considered, our
supporting cast is much better
than last year," Poe said. "As a
team, our luck hasn't been as
good, but we'll save it for the
spring."
With the continually improv

ing freshman class of golfers,
this squad may not need Poe's
prophesied luck to win in the
spring.
"It was good to see players like
Dusty Brett and Michael Weimer
finish strong in this tourna
ment," Goodwin said. "Jake Poe
and Andy Hastings had a couple
tough breaks, but they're coming
around. This is a team that real
ly wants to get better, and now
that recruiting time and fall com
petition are over, we'll have
much more time to work on our
games individually."
The team plans to work hard
to stay in good shape this winter
and will be practicing as much as
NCAA regulations will allow,
which is eight hours per week.
"We're going to work hard to
stay in good shape in the offsea
son — our team is known for its
short game, and we're going to
work on it this winter," Ray said.
"In order for us to be successful
in the spring, all five team mem
bers are going to have to con
tribute."
Although it is not yet settled
who these five final team mem
bers will be, one thing is for sure:
Every golfer is ready to work
hard to improve certain aspects
of his game.
"We're not quite satisfied with
the way we did this fall," Brett
said. "There's a silent fury that's
going to be driving us through
out the offseason."

"It was good to see players like
Dusty Brett and Michael Weimer
finish strong in this tourna
ment," Goodwin said. "Jake Poe
and Andy Hastings had a couple
tough breaks, but they're coming
around. This is a team that real
ly wants to get better, and now
that recruiting time and fall com
petition are over, we'll have
much more time to work on our
games individually."
The team plans to work hard
to stay in good shape this winter
and will be practicing as much as
NCAA regulations will allow,
which is eight hours per week.
"We're going to work hard to
stay in good shape in the offsea
son — our team is known for its
short game, and we're going to
work on it this winter," Ray said.
"In order for us to be successful
in the spring, all five team mem
bers are going to have to con
tribute."
Although it is not yet settled
who these five final team mem
bers will be, one thing is for sure:
Every golfer is ready to work
hard to improve certain aspects
of his game.
"We're not quite satisfied with
the way we did this fall," Brett
said. "There's a silent fury that's
going to be driving us through
out the offseason."

Senior Conrad Ray drives the ball in a tournament last year. This
weekend, Ray led the Cardinal in the Nelson Invitational, which
Stanford hosted.
Although the Stanford golf
team stood solidly in seventh
place with a combined score of
299 after round one of the Nel
son Invitational on Friday, the
team slipped in the last two
rounds to tie Auburn for 12th
place with a final score of 903 in
the tourney ending Sunday at
the Stanford Golf Course.
"The toughest thing about a
golf tournament is that immedi

ately after you score, your name
goes up on the scoreboard," said
coach Wally Goodwin. "You can
hide in football or basketball if
something goes wrong, but you
can't hide in golf."
"It was a mentally frustrat
ing tournament," said fresh
man Dusty Brett. "When you're
playing at home, you expect to
play well. We had hoped to fin
ish better, and we know we're
capable."
Despite a disappointing fin
ish for some squad members,

senior Conrad Ray stepped up
to lead the team, finishing fifth
in the tournament with two
even-par scores on separate
rounds of play.
"I pretty much hit the same
as I have all fall, but I was able
to avoid the high scores — I
didn't have any double bogeys
— and it helps to get rid of the
big numbers," Ray said.
"Although I had a slow start,
shooting bogeys on the first two
holes, I was happy with the way
I managed my game."

Ray was playing first in the
Cardinal lineup in the absence
of sophomore Joel Kribel. who
is competing in the prestigious
World Amateur Tournament in
the Philippines this week.
"Anytime you lose a guy like
Joel, it's going to create a real
dent in the team," Ray said.
"With Joel gone, we all had to
pick up our game, and I think
this was in the back of our
heads all weekend. I think being
first in the lineup also helped my
game because I play better when
I'm playing with better players."
"If Joel had been here, we
might have had a good chance of
winning the tournament," said
junior Jake Poe. "We were there
after the first day, but in the last
two days we struggled."
Perhaps one of the most diffi
cult aspects of the golf tourna
ment was the setup, which pre
sented problems for many
golfers.
"With the way the course was
set up, you could pretty much
add on a couple of strokes any
time you put the ball in the
rough, and if you missed the fair
way, sometimes you couldn't hit
the green," Brett said. However,
the conditions could not have
been better.
"I've probably played more
rounds on this course than any
one on the team, and the course
was in better shape for a tourna
ment than I've ever seen it," Ray
said. The weather was also near
perfect, without any strong
winds.
With a three-month break
before their next tournament,
the Cardinal golfers know what
they have to accomplish in the
off season.
"This time of year it doesn't
make much of a difference how
we do, but it's good to get a look
at what we can do," Goodwin
said.
In sharp contrast to last sea
son, the success of this year's
team depends much less on star
players and more on a group
effort. The fourth and fifth men
on the squad play a much larger
role in the team's outcome this
year.
"All things considered, our
supporting cast is much better
than last year," Poe said. "As a
team, our luck hasn't been as
good, but we'll save it for the
spring."
With the continually improv

ing freshman class of golfers,
this squad may not need Poe's
prophesied luck to win in the
spring.
"It was good to see players like
Dusty Brett and Michael Weimer
finish strong in this tourna
ment," Goodwin said. "Jake Poe
and Andy Hastings had a couple
tough breaks, but they're coming
around. This is a team that real
ly wants to get better, and now
that recruiting time and fall com
petition are over, we'll have
much more time to work on our
