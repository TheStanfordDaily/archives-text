### David J. Lee 
If the results of the Women's Northwest Regional
Rolex Intercollegiate Tennis Championships held last
weekend at Stanford are any indication of things to
come, then expect a whole lot from the Stanford
women's tennis team.
Stanford, the second-best team in the country
according to the Rolex Intercollegiate Rankings, com
pletely dominated the tournament, winning both the
singles and doubles finals as well as the consolation
round. No. 2 seed senior Katie Schlukebir won the
singles, and the top-seeded team of Schlukebir and
freshman Lilia Osterloh won the doubles.
The singles round of 16, in which both Stanford
and California had five players each, looked strangely
similar to last year's situation, which had eventually
resulted in two Cardinal-Bear matches in the semifi
nals.
Fear of Cal disappeared as all five Cardinal players
easily made their way to the quarterfinals along with
only three non-Stanford players â€” fifth-seeded Aman
da Augustus of Cal, sixth-seeded Dora Djilinova of
Fresno State and eighth-seeded Francesca La'O of
Cal. And this time no Bears even got to the semifinal
round.
One Cardinal, three Bulldogs and three Bears
dropped out before the semifinals. It was the Card vs.
Card in both singles matches of the semifinals: sev
enth-seeded freshman Teryn Ashley squared off
against fourth-seeded Osterloh, and second-seeded
senior Katie Schlukebir battled third-seeded senior
Sandra De Silva.
After upsetting top-seeded senior Ania Bleszynski
in the quarterfinals 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 and Osterloh in the
semifinals 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 (7-2), Ashley faced Schlukebir,
who had handily topped Djilianova in the quarterfi
nals 6-4, 6-2 and De Silva in the semifinals 6-2, 7-6 (7-
3). On Sunday, Schlukebir defeated Ashley in the
finals 6-4, 6-2.
On the doubles side, the Card featured three seed
ed and one unseeded teams Fifth-seeded Ashley and
freshman Anne Kremer upset fourth-seeded Kori Sos
nowy and Katherine Cos tain from Washington in a
tough three-set match 2-6, 7-5,6-3 on their way to the
semifinals. Here they faced Schlukebir and Osterloh.
who had not lost a single game until the fourth round
of competition.
Schlukebir and Osterloh won the first set against
Ashley and Kremer 6-1 only to give up the next set 6-
3. But Schlukebir and Osterloh came back strong to
take the third set 6-1 and went on to the finals

Senior Katie Schlukebir works her forehand last spring. This weekend, she won both
singles and doubles (with teammate Lilia Osterloh) in the Rolex Tournament, hosted
by Stanford.
"It's hard any time that you
have to play your friends, but when
we got on the court it was all busi
ness," Osterloh said. "Stanford is
the strongest team in the Pac-10,
and we basically knew that it
would end up something like this."
In the other half of the doubles
draw, No. 2 seed Augustus and
La'O of Cal climbed quickly past

unseeded Cardinal freshman Jen
Heiser and junior Heidi Stalle in
the quarterfinals and third-seeded
Bleszynski and junior Julie Scott in
the semifinals. As a result, it was
Stanford vs. Cal in the finals.
Schlukebir and Osterloh defeat
ed Augustus and La'O 6-3, 6-4.
Stanford also won the consola
tion round of the tournament. After
losing in the second round of the
singles bracket, Heiser went on to
defeat three players to get to the
finals, where she won 6-4, 7-5
against Leanne Maitland of Nevada.
