# Golfers hold own
## Baxter stars, women come in eighth at Palmetto Dunes

This weekend at the Golf
World / Palmetto Dunes Invita
tional the Stanford women's golf
team put in yet another strong
showing against the nation's top
collegiate golf teams. The field was
the strongest the Cardinal has
faced this year, consisting of Ari
zona, Arizona State, UCLA, Texas,
Tulsa, Wake Forest, Furman, New
Mexico, Duke and Louisiana State.
Although the women finished
only eighth out of a field of 12, they
were without their top golfer,
senior Mhairi McKay. McKay
missed the event because she was
in the Philippines representing her
native Scotland in an international
tournament.
Senior Andrea Baxter fared bet
ter in the individual competition,
coming from behind in the final
round to post the third victory of
her career.
It was clear after the first day
that the Cardinal sorely needed
McKay's talents, as it shot a team
score of 321, leaving the team in a
tie with Wake Forest for ninth
place. Although Stanford struggled
as a whole, Baxter shot a 2-over
par 74, putting her in sole posses
sion of fourth place, just two shots
behind the leaders and in the hunt
for the individual title.
Dav two saw an improvement

by the entire team. Each of the five
golfers lowered their day-one
scores. The result was a 13-stroke
improvement and a composite
score of 308 for the day. The effort
moved Stanford out of its ninth
place tie into sole possession of
eighth place, 20 strokes behind sec
ond-round leaders Louisiana State
and Duke. Baxter also continued
her fine play, shooting a 1-over-par
73 to move into second place, just
one stroke off the pace set by lead
er Laura Moore of LSU.
Going into the final day, it was
clear that the team's chances for
victory were slim, but Baxter's
prospects were very promising.
While the team was not able to
improve upon its previous day's
score — instead shooting a 312 to
finish in eighth place, 19 strokes
behind winner Arizona State —
Baxter was up to the task.
The senior standout fired a 1-
under-par 71 to capture the indi
vidual title with a three-round
score of 218, 2 over par and three
shots ahead of second-place finish
er Je'ne-Marie Busuttil of Arizona
State. The title was her second this
year and the third of her caieer.
Clearly, though, she would have
preferred to have won the team
title.
"Individual awards mean very
little in college golf," Baxter said.
"It is all about the team's perfor
mance."
Although the team did not come
out victorious, it was a very solid
effort in McKay's absence. The
event reaffirmed the belief that, at
full strength, the Cardinal is as
good a team as any in the land. The
team has nearly three months to
get ready to make a charge for the

NCAA crown, as Stanford does not
play another tournament until the
Regional Challenge from Feb. 7-9.
