# Women's soccer draws Santa Clara in NCAAs
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
For the second consecutive
year, Stanford will play Santa
Clara at the Broncos' home field in
the first round of the NCAA tour
nament.
The match will take place at
Buck Shaw Stadium next week
end. It is up to the two schools to
decide on the exact day and time
for the game.
But while the date is uncertain,
one thing is for sure: The game will
be as emotional and intense as col
lege soccer gets. The Broncos and
the Cardinal are longtime rivals.
This will be the teams' 16th meet
ing overall and their fourth in the
NCAA tournament.
Santa Clara, which gets to host
the match because it is seeded
fifth, holds a 9-5-2 edge all-time
over Stanford, including a 2-1 post
season advantage.
Last year, the Broncos sent
Stanford home packing after the
first round with an incredibly close
3-2 victory in triple overtime.
Santa Clara played Stanford
earlier thus season and defeated the

Cardinal at Maloney Field 2-1. The
game was very close, and many
Cardinal players felt they should
have won it.
The Cardinal, which received
an automatic berth into the
tournament by winning the
Pacific 10 Conference, has also
played at Buck Shaw Stadium
twice this year. In the Santa
Clara Invitational tournament,
Stanford lost two tough games
to Notre Dame 4-0 and Colorado
College 2-0.
Should the Cardinal upset the
Broncos, they will play the winner
of the Penn State-George Mason
match. The location for that game
will be announced later.
North Carolina received the No.
1 seed in the tournament, as the
Atlantic Coast Conference champi
ons finished off the season with a
20-1 record. UNC's only loss came
to second-seeded Notre Dame,
which is also 20-1, with its lone set
back coming at the hands of Santa
Clara.
