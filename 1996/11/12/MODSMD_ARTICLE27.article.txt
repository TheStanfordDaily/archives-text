# Stanford ice hockey sweeps USC
## 
### Ben Freda 
This weekend, Stanford's ice
hockey team added another ingredi
ent to the steaming, bubbling pot of
national playoff hopes: two wins
over Pacific 8 Conference rival USC
at the Ice Oasis in Redwood City.
The wins brought the hopes of a
championship from a slow, warm
boil to a vigorous, chortling mix
ture.
"After strong performances at
USC and Cal, our chances look very
good for nationals this year," said
junior Matt Blythe.
On Friday, the Cardinal (5-2-2,
5-0-2 Pac-8) played stubborn USC
(4-4, 2-4). After jumping ahead
with two goals in the first 10 min
utes, Stanford's scoring dried up.
"The first and second lines were
struggling," said team president
Sami Jo Small. "They couldn't put
the puck in the net." Neither of the
first two goals were representative
of those lines, either. Both were
scored by the third line, anchored
by center Christian Leone.
Although the Cardinal contin
ued to dominate both of the final
quarters, USC capitalized on what
little chance it had by netting the
puck twice, tying the game at 2-2.
Regulation ended on that note.
The beleaguered Cardinal crew,
who had been winning the game in
every category except score, headed
out onto the ice for another period.
But they were quickly saved as
freshman defender Ben D'Ewart,
just 10 seconds after the opening
bell, slapped the puck hard and fast
at the USC goalie. His shot was
barely tipped by freshman Gabe
Miller, sending the puck home. The
team erupted, victorious.
With Friday's game under its
belt, the Cardinal made short work
of the Trojans on Saturday.
USC scored a quick goal to open
the first period, and the score
remained that way for the next 10
minutes. Then, during the waning
minutes of the first period, Stan
ford scored three quick goals,
putting the game out of reach early

for USC.
"We basically had to move the
fourth line up to third, but we were
still able to win," said freshman
Phil Enan.
As the Trojans began to fall far
ther behind, "They started to play a
lot scrappier, more violent and
rough," Enan said. "There were

more penalties."
More USC penalties meant
more power plays for the Card.
This was an area where the Cardi
nal needed work. But Stanford
turned in a stellar performance.
"We were trying out our power
play more, and working on our
lead," Small said. "This time, we

really capitalized on our scoring
chances."
By the middle of the second peri
od, the Cardinal was up 5-2 and in
no imminent danger of losing. By
the end of the game, the score was
6-3, and the Cardinal was on its
way to another win in its quest for
nationals.
