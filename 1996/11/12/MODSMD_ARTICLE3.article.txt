Reforming America's health
care system is a task for Generation
X, Sara Singer told a crowd in
Tresidder Union last night.
Singer, Business School Prof.
Alain Enthoven's research assis
tant, spoke about "The Medicare
Mess" on behalf of Enthoven, who
was called away by a personal
emergency.
According to Singer, the
Medicare program is currently fac
ing a crisis.
"Particularly with the aging of
the baby boom population, the
Medicare program as it is currently
structured is unsustainable,"
Singer said. "We recommend struc
turing Medicare more like health
care benefits are structured in the
private sector."
According to their analyses, pro
jected growth rates suggest that
Medicare costs will almost double

as a share of gross domestic prod
uct by the year 2010, "crowding
out" spending on other necessary
public programs and / or requiring
large tax increases.
Enthoven advocates a two
pronged approach to the Medicare
crisis, Singer said.
The first is termed "managed
care," which would, among other
things, provide incentives to select
health care providers on the basis
of quality, give incentives for both
doctors and insurance agencies to
provide appropriate care and call
for negotiated fees and quality
management.
The second, "managed competi
tion," aims to create price-elastic
demand for health aire by provid
ing Medicare beneficiaries with a
choice of plans, by giving them in
formation on quality of health care,
by making both Medicare benefi
ciaries and employers responsible
