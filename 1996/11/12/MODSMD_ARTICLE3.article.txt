# Gen X called on to reform health care

### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
Reforming America's health
care system is a task for Generation
X, Sara Singer told a crowd in
Tresidder Union last night.
Singer, Business School Prof.
Alain Enthoven's research assis
tant, spoke about "The Medicare
Mess" on behalf of Enthoven, who
was called away by a personal
emergency.
According to Singer, the
Medicare program is currently fac
ing a crisis.
"Particularly with the aging of
the baby boom population, the
Medicare program as it is currently
structured is unsustainable,"
Singer said. "We recommend struc
turing Medicare more like health
care benefits are structured in the
private sector."
According to their analyses, pro
jected growth rates suggest that
Medicare costs will almost double

as a share of gross domestic prod
uct by the year 2010, "crowding
out" spending on other necessary
public programs and / or requiring
large tax increases.
Enthoven advocates a two
pronged approach to the Medicare
crisis, Singer said.
The first is termed "managed
care," which would, among other
things, provide incentives to select
health care providers on the basis
of quality, give incentives for both
doctors and insurance agencies to
provide appropriate care and call
for negotiated fees and quality
management.
The second, "managed competi
tion," aims to create price-elastic
demand for health aire by provid
ing Medicare beneficiaries with a
choice of plans, by giving them in
formation on quality of health care,
by making both Medicare benefi
ciaries and employers responsible
for premium differences and by
standardizing coverage contracts.
"We think the cost-sharing re
quirements are extremely impor
tant to maintain individuals' ex
pectations, and to encourage pa
tients not to expect more care than

they need," Singer said.
According to a paper written by
Enthoven and Singer, their pro
posed plan consists of some give
and-take between beneficiaries
and providers.
"In a grand trade, beneficiaries
would be asked to accept the limi
tations of managed care in ex
change for small premiums for the
plan of their choice, an entitlement
to an adequate package of benefits

and the preservation of the
Medicare program without making
the drastic cutbacks that will be
necessary under any other sce
nario," Enthoven and Singer wrote
in the paper.
But steps must be taken soon if
the reform of Medicare is to have
any impact, Singer said.
"If we wait until the year 2010
when the baby boom Igeneration]
hits 65, it will be too late," she said.

Singer, who recently accompa
nied Enthoven to Washington,
D.C., to discuss health care issues
with Hillary Clinton, said it is im
portant that people of younger gen
erations take action.
"The taxes from Generation X
are going to have to support all the
aged baby boomers in a really ex
pensive Medicare program, and
everyone in government is too old
to feel that urgency," she said.
