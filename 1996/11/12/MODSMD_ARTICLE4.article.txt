# Earth Systems launches energy track

Economics and geophysics do not have
much in common, at least at first glance.
However, a new track in the School of Earth
Sciences' Earth Systems Program will study
something that involves both: energy.
The new track will study issues related to
the science and technology of energy. Civil
Engineering Prof. Gil Masters stressed the
interdisciplinary aspect of the project, which
he said is the first of its kind in the country.
"Energy is an interdisciplinary problem.
There's no single place where it should exist,"
he said. "We can throw away the bound

aries." Masters is one of the many Stanford
professors — drawn from such diverse disci
plines as biology and law — teaching in the
program.
He is teaching several courses that are of
fered in the track, including a course on elec
tric power generation and an introductory
course on environmental science and technol
ogy.
For present and future generations, the
"No. 1 issue of concern next to population is
energy," said Jonathan Roughgarden, a pro
fessor of biology and geophysics and director
of the Earth Systems Program.
"We have a very good blend of courses that

cover everything from the production and
consumption of energy to the development of
alternate sources of energy," Roughgarden
said.
Students in the track, which started this
quarter, take courses in petroleum engineer
ing, civil engineering, earth science and engi
neering-economic systems, among others.
The track requires seven set courses and
three electives.
"Students learn the social and institution
al context in which energy is produced,"
Roughgarden added. "They will have a broad-
er picture that the existing de
partments provide."
"Certain problems such as
global warming are so complicat
ed that you can only understand
them through a multidiscipli
nary approach," said Jane
Kennedy, academic coordinator
for the Earth Systems Program.
"If you're interested in prob
lem-solving, it's an extremely
good track," she added, "because
you learn problem-solving skills
in a wide variety of areas includ
ing economics, ecology and geo
logical sciences."
People who obtain degrees
through the track will be quali
fied to join government institu
tions that legislate energy policy
or be consultants in the private
sector, Kennedy said.
She added that about six stu
dents have already declared
their intention to take the track.
