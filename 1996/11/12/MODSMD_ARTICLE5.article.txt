"Hey! This is Erik with a K and Scott. If
you're having a bad quarter, cheer up, be

cause you've got to be having a better quarter
than we are."
Yes, if you have not already guessed from
their answering machine message, junior
Erik Nordhagen and sophomore Scott Dollar

will not be chalking this quarter up as
the best of their lives. Neither, it
seems, will fellow Real Worlders, ju
niors Arthur Chang and Mark Lo.
First Flower, the resident stuffed
skunk, mysteriously disappeared
from her cardboard box in Erik and
Scott's room. So distraught was Erik
that he didn't sleep for the next 65
hours.
The blame, according to Erik,
falls upon a certain Synner who was
terrified of Flower and decided that
she could not trust Erik with the
skunk. Explaining the skunknap
per's fright, Erik related how every
once in a while Flower would "some
how escape my arms and go flying in
her direction."
Ultimately Flower was missing
for three weeks and was only re
turned after Erik made a solemn
vow to skunknapper Jen Brown
"not to touch Flower as long as [she]
is in the room." Relieved and reunit-

Ed with his dear skunk, Erik said,
"All is right with our room once
again."
Meanwhile, Scott reported he
had difficulties trying to bake bread
for the house.
While mixing his bread dough,
Scott managed to break the Hobart
mixer, encrust all of the kitchen sur
faces with flour and track flour
throughout the house while desper
ately seeking the aid of others. At
one point, he forgot the dough in the
machine until it rose over the bowl
and had to be rescued by a more as
tute resident.
Total preparation time for the
whole wheat dough, to which Scott
decided to add chocolate chips, was
four hours. Exasperated and out of
time, Scott departed for soccer prac
tice without actually getting the
chance to bake the bread, leaving
that task to others.
All four have felt pressure
throughout the quarter. Academics,
friendships, activities and taking
the time to become part of the Syn
ergy community have all made de
mands.

One time, to relieve some of the
pressures he was feeling, Scott de
cided to join in a house expedition.
"There I was, sitting all innocent
and pretty, when someone asked me
if I wanted to go with everyone to
Lake Lusty," he said. "They said
they were going for a walk, so I de
cided to go with. At Lake Lusty,
there was a little ladder everyone
had to climb down to get to the
lake."
Always the gentleman, Scott saw
to it that everyone else made it down
the ladder safely and then followed.
"I could hear splashing as I
climbed down and I thought, 'This is
crazy! They're all swimming with
their clothes on!'" said Scott. "Then
I looked and saw some people strip
ping and the rest already in the lake
naked.
"I had no idea what to do. I knew
that I didn't want to do it, not to
mention that it was freezing, so I de
cided to check out the scenery."
Reflecting on the experience,
Scott is a bit bashful as to his naivete,
admitting that the name Lake Lusty
could perhaps have clued him in to

the group's plans.
The group still doesn't feel com
pletely comfortable as part of the
Synergy experience.
As a whole, we aren't really bond
ed," Arthur said. "This is a cause for
concern. It's a close house, and a lot of
the residents have been here before.
Some people still don't think we be
long. That means hard times for all of
us because it is a source of frustration
not feeling a part of the community.
"But there are a lot of things I
like," he added. "I don't feel like
everyone is a weirdo anymore, and it
is good getting to know people."
Mark has recently begun to help
cook, which makes him feel more at
home.
"Before, I was cleaning up after
the mess the people who cooked
made. Milking the mess is a lot more
fun," he said. "We hangout and talk
while trying to feed the house. I'm
still inept at cooking, but they're
teaching me.
"Synergy — making friends here
— has been on my mind a lot. I am
happy because that is starting to
happen."

Scott said he can "always go back
to Synergy and vent," to which Erik
and Mark added that Synergy feels a
lot like a family and a household. The
house, said Scott, "is detached, re
moved and nestled from the rest of
Stanford. Well, except for during the
Halloween party."
They described how three bands
played to a crowd of people at the
party, some naked, some dressed in
costumes.
Mark explained that party-goers
became increasingly comfortable as
the night progressed, and, at one
point, a resident encouraged the
crowd to unwind and have fun by
saying, "Come on folks, let it all
hang."
Erik joked that he wasn't at the
party long because he ate "one too
many magic cookies." The cookies
were obviously the food item which
impressed them the most.
Mark, who "worked the door"
checking IDs, said the party was
"pretty crazy. It was definitely the
most alternative party I have ever
been to. It actually wasn't wild like a
frat party, though."
