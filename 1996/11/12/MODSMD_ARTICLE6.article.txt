Knight fellow Maria Ronderos, a Colombian jour
nalist, has received the prestigious Premio Iberoamer
icano de Periodismo Rev de Espanol for capturing the
story of a country plagued by ding trafficking, corrupt
politicians and a sometimes apathetic media.
The King of Spain Prize will be presented to her in
March by the Spanish king.
"The King of Spain award is the equivalent of the
Pulitzer Prize here in the United States. It is consid
ered the most important journalism prize in the world
for Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking nations," said
Knight Fellowship Program Director James Risser.
"We think that we're choosing very pood journalists...
the best in the world, and this just validates what we're
doing."
As one of six international Knight fellows, Ronderos
is attending classes and seminars at Stanford for one
year.
Ronderos received t he award along with another re
porter, Ernesto Fierro, for their three-part series, pub

Colombia. The series reported on the media's poor han
dling of the relationship between drug trafficking and
corrupt politicians during the administration of
Ernesto Samper, the current Colombian president.
"There had been some talk in 1994 about the Sam
per campaign and how it had received money from the
drug cartel," Ronderos said, adding that her investiga
tion stemmed from an incident in which the media ob
tained a list, confiscated from drug cartel houses, of
politician's names.
She said tapes of talks between a well-known jour
nalist and the head of a drug cartel about giving money
