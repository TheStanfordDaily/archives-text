Knight fellow Maria Ronderos, a Colombian jour
nalist, has received the prestigious Premio Iberoamer
icano de Periodismo Rev de Espanol for capturing the
story of a country plagued by ding trafficking, corrupt
politicians and a sometimes apathetic media.
The King of Spain Prize will be presented to her in
March by the Spanish king.
"The King of Spain award is the equivalent of the
Pulitzer Prize here in the United States. It is consid
ered the most important journalism prize in the world
for Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking nations," said
Knight Fellowship Program Director James Risser.
"We think that we're choosing very pood journalists...
the best in the world, and this just validates what we're
doing."
As one of six international Knight fellows, Ronderos
is attending classes and seminars at Stanford for one
year.
Ronderos received t he award along with another re
porter, Ernesto Fierro, for their three-part series, pub
lished last May in El Tiempo, a leading newspaper in
Colombia. The series reported on the media's poor han
dling of the relationship between drug trafficking and
corrupt politicians during the administration of
Ernesto Samper, the current Colombian president.
"There had been some talk in 1994 about the Sam
per campaign and how it had received money from the
drug cartel," Ronderos said, adding that her investiga
tion stemmed from an incident in which the media ob
tained a list, confiscated from drug cartel houses, of
politician's names.
She said tapes of talks between a well-known jour
nalist and the head of a drug cartel about giving money
to the campaign were received by
the media the day before the elec
tion but were never made public be
cause the "press didn't believe
them."
"There we were sitting on the top
of a Watergate and saying, 'Oh no,
the president is too nice and he's our
friend,' " Ronderos said. "Half the
scandals wouldn't have happened if
it weren't for the media."
Ronderos' articles were largely
critical of her own profession, expos
ing the lack of media investigation
into the scandal. She believes she
won the award because her stories
were "auto-critical."
Risser pointed out the dangers of
being a journalist in Colombia, say
ing, "It takes a lot of courage to write
about the relationship between the
narcotics trade and government."

Over the last two decades about
110 journalists have been murdered
in Colombia, according to Ronderos.
Although neither she nor Fierro
has received any threats for their
award-winning series, Ronderos re
calls that happening during her 13
years of media work.
"In 1989, there was an attempt
to bomb our TV station because of a
story we aired that I directed, but se
curity stopped them," she said. "We
have too many dangerous people in
Colombia, and when they don't like
a story, you don't know how they're
going to react."
She added that the more success
ful a journalist becomes, the more
dangerous life is.
"Some have to go around in bul
let-proofed cars," she said. "And
their wives and kids go to the gro
cery store and school with body
guards. You are dealing with un
known dangers. Who knows, proba
bly with this story I got in five (hit]
lists."

Ronderos also faced other diffi
culties while writing the story, espe
cially when she had to interview col
leagues.
"One was to look at my own pro
fession with some distance," she
said. "Here I am interviewing peo
ple with three times as much experi
ence as me and I'm trying to ques
tion their ability. It was also very
hard to pin them down; you had to
be tough," Ronderos said. "I came
out of those interviews exhausted."
Interviews also posed another
problem.
"If you interviewed someone
from the government, you'd get one
story. If you interviewed someone
from the media you'd get a different
story," she said, adding that it was
also difficult to organize all the in
formation.
"I had been covering it for a
whole year, so I had so much. To
make things reachable and clear
was very hard," she said.
Ronderos describes her articles

as simply an "attempt to organize"
the facts for people.
"This is not the great detective
story; it is more analytical," she
said. "We (the press) were too un
critical for too long."
Now on leave from her job as a
staff writer and columnist for El In
spectador, a newspaper in Bogota,
Ronderos said attending Stanford is
a "humongous opportunity" in her
life.
"I just applied and I got the fel
lowship, which for my life was much
more important than winning the
prize," Ronderos said. "What I want
is for my work to really change
things and here I'm able to reflect
and study and compare and con
trast. If I'm able to do that, then my
work will probably be much better."
The 37-year-old added that she
has not yet reached her peak profes
sionally.
"This is just the incentive to keep
going and to do much more," Ron
deros said. "I've just started."
