### 
CHARKHI DADRI, India (AP) - A
Saudi jumbo jet climbing from New Delhi's
airport collided with a Ka/.ak plane coming
in for landing yesterday, creating twin fire
balls that turned the sky red as dawn and
scattered the bodies of up to 351 people
over farmland below.
If the death toll is confirmed, the crash
would be the third-deadliest in aviation his
tory.
Wreckage dropping from the sky gouged
big craters and left body parts, baggage and
clothes strewn across six miles of wheat
and mustard fields near the town of
Charkhi Dadri, about 60 miles west of New
Delhi. The first people to arrive at the scene
said the dusk air was filled with the unbear
able stench of burning flesh.
"I saw 60 or 70 bodies, but only about 15
were identifiable," said Manjit Singh, a 19-
year-old college student who sped to the site
on his motorcycle after seeing the collision
from his home. The faces of the rest of the
victims were horribly disfigured and
charred, he said.
Rescue vehicles tried to navigate the
area's poor roads, arriving at the crash site
after the first curious villagers. Within a
few hours, thousands of people gathered in
the dark and solemnly watched the search.
"We have collected 200 bodies so far
from all over the field," said Mohammed
Akhil, the police officer in charge of the
operations.
The Saudi Arabian Airlines jet with 312
passengers and crew members had been in

the air for only seven minutes when it col
lided with a Kazakstan Airlines Ilyushin-76
cargo plane, which was on a landing
approach, aviation officials said.
Seventeen foreigners were on board the
Saudi Arabia-bound jetliner, including two
Americans and a Briton, Press Trust of
India news agency reported.
The plane arriving from Shymkent in
the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan
was carrying 39 people â€” 28 Kazaks and an
11 -member Russian crew. It had been char
tered by a clothing company.
All aboard the two planes were believed
killed. There were no reports that anyone
on the ground died.
Hours afler the crash, the fuselage of the
Kazak plane rested in a field. The jet's
wings had been sliced off" in the crash. A few
charred bodies lay on the ground.
Local district administrator T.V.S.L.
Prasad said workers were trying to extri
cate bodies from the plane.
The American pilot of a C-141 Air Force
transport plane who was bringing in sup
plies for the U S Kmbassy in New Delhi
witnessed the crash's fiery aftermath from
20,000 feet.
"We noticed out of our right-hand (side
of the planet a large cloud lit up with an
orange glow, from within the clouds," the
30-year-old captain told reporters in a con
ference call from the Indian capital.
"The glow intensity of the cloud became
dimmer and the two fireballs descended,"
the pilot said.
