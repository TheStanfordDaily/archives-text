# Clinton softens opposition to balanced-budget amendment

WASHINGTON (AP)
Exploring agendas with the Repub
lican-dominated Congress, Presi
dent Clinton softened his once
firm opposition yesterday to a bal
anced-budget constitutional
amendment that appears increas
ingly likely to pass.
"He seems to bo coming around
to the idea that something will hap
pen," Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said. The
White House acknowledged that an
amendment probably will pass and
be sent to the states for ratifica
tion.

One week after the election, the
president met with the returning
leaders of Congress for 1 1/2 hours
in the Oval Office to begin planning
for talks on how to balance the
budget and to pass campaign
finance reform. Republicans, still
irritated by Clinton's attacks dur
ing the campaign, took the position
that the president should go first in
presenting budget suggestions.
Both sides emphasized coopera
tion, but lines of confrontation
were obvious.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich
said that Republicans, in pursuing

campaign finance reform, will
press for answers about question
able contributions â€” an issue that
dogged Clinton in the closing days
of the presidential campaign.
"We need to lay out clearly what
are the contours of campaign
spending," Gingrich told reporters
in the White House driveway after
the talks. "There was an amazing
amount of money this year spent
outside the campaigns."
Even so, House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, R-Texas, said there
would be a post-election reprieve
from partisan warfare. "We all

agreed that we have now at least a
year where we can turn our atten
tion away from politics and to poli
cy"
Clinton made a pitch for balanc
ing the budget by picking up the
legislative plan that was aban
doned when negotiations broke up
a year ago.
Lott said it was up to Clinton to
take the lead. "The president will
need to make it clear that we have
important and tough decisions we
need to make in that area," the
senator said. "And when he
out the problem and suggests some

solutions, we're certainly going to
be prepared to work with him then
to come to the proper results."
Clinton said he still believes a
balanced-budget amendment is
unnecessary, but then he began
stipulating conditions. "If we have
it, it ought to be implemented in a
way that actually works and gives
the country what it needs to man
age a recession," he said.
White House aides said the pres
ident's change of tone on an
amendment was a bow to political
reality alter Republicans gained
two seats in the Senate for a 55-4")

advantage over Democrats.
"It looks like they're going to do
it," presidential spokesman Mike
McCurry said. "The question is
how they're going to do it."
Soothing words of bipartisan
ship are flowing from Democrats
and Republicans alike in the post
election season.
"We're in this boat together and
we have to paddle it together," the
president said at a midmorning
signing ceremony for a popular
parks bill affecting 41 states.
"That's what the American people
want."
