Army faces second scandal
FORT LEONARD WOOD, Mo. (AP) - In the
second Army sex scandal in less than a week, a male
drill sergeant at one of the nation's biggest basic
training posts pleaded guilty yesterday to having
sex with three female soldiers.
Two other male officers at Fort Leonard Wood
faced charges of improperly touching female
trainees, and seven drill sergeants were suspended,
but not charged, as the Army investigates allega
tions ranging from giving cigarettes to trainees to
improper touching or kissing.
The charges were announced five days after a sex
scandal broke at the military's Aberdeen Proving
Ground in Maryland. The Army said the two cases
are unrelated.
U.S. military to assist Zaire
WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. militaiy will
take part in an international effort to assist the
swarms of refugees in Eastern Zaire, but the precise
nature of the American role is still undecided, an
administration official said yesterday.
The official, who asked not to be identified,
raised the possibility that ground troops would be

sent but said an announcement probably is a few
days off.
A 40-member U.S. military team will be flown to
Central Africa from Italy today to assess the
humanitarian situation, the Pentagon announced.
Also, a team from the U.S. Agency for Internation
al Development was attempting to cross into Zaire
from Rwanda yesterday.
Children of thalidomide, again?
WASHINGTON (AP) — Thalidomide, which
became the world's most infamous drug after caus
ing thousands of horrific birth defects more than 30
years ago, may soon be sold in the United States —
perhaps as early as next year.
While the dnig shows promise in fighting some
AIDS-related disorders, leprosy and other devastat
ing diseases, the Food and Drug Administration
already is taking steps to protect women who could
bear children with no limbs or tiny flipper-like arms
and legs after taking just one pill in early pregnan
cy.
"We never thought there would be another gen
eration of thalidomides," said Canadian Randy
Warren, his voice choked with emotion, who was
born with no hips and malformed legs.
