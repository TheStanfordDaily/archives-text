## Editorial Calendar decisions 
### 
Veterans Day ought
to be a University-wide
holiday like MLK Day

Holidays are a rare
occurrence at Stanford.
Take this past Monday.
While government offices, the
postal service, public secondary
schools and some banks closed in
observance of Veterans Day, Stan
ford stayed open.
The issue of University holidays
is a sticky one. Stanford students
can take pride, yet heap scorn, on
the oft-cited reason for Stanford's
lack of time off — the quarter sys
tem.
The quarter system allows for
greater academic choice, the possi
bility of completing a non-related
double major in four years and for
some students, a quicker route to
graduation. These benefits are
certainly reasons why some stu
dents and administrators would
like to keep the calendar the way
it is.
However, the quarter system
has a major drawback, that being
the relentless schedule needed to
teach the same amount and quali
ty of material comparable to
schools on semester systems.
Another objection related to
time has been raised by some pro
fessors who teach classes on Mon
day. Given that the calendar, in
their opinion, is too short as it is,
the observance of holidays falling
on Monday — as a vast majority of
them do — imposes considerable
inconvenience on them in terms of
time lost and ability to cover
enough material.
Moving Stanford to a semester
system for the sake of a few extra
days off during the year and longer
holidays would be excessive. How
ever, University administrators
should somehow try to schedule in
major holidays like Veterans Day
for observance.
There must be some way of rec
onciling time conflicts and restric

tions of the quarter system.
According to University Registrar
Roger Printup, the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment — which makes recommen
dations to the Faculty Senate on
which holidays should be observed
and how many days students
should get to take off — will be
opening the academic calendar to
changes some time this year, decid
ing which holidays should be con
sidered for University-wide obser
vance.
Once those recommendations
are made, they will be forwarded
to and voted on by the senate,
which has the power to declare as
many holidays as it sees fit.
Rather than keeping the calen
dar as it stands now, the senate
and the committee should defi
nitely add Veterans Day to the cal
endar next year. Honoring soldiers
who fought for America should be
a priority for a university which
cherishes and teaches the rights
and freedoms America's veterans
went to war to defend.
If losing that extra day is such a
detriment to some professors,
then perhaps the senate can have
students start classes a day early
in the fall.
The status quo, in which some
federal holidays — Martin Luther
King Jr. Day — are observed while
others — such as Veterans Day
and Columbus Day — are not,
leads one to wonder whether these
calendar decisions are motivated
more by fear of protest than any
thing else.
Additionally, fall quarter is
longer than winter or spring. By
that very fact, the objections of los
ing time should be negated
because there is actually an extra
week of instruction in the fall.
To be fair, it should also be
mentioned that UC-Berkeley did
not get Veterans Day off either.
However, Stanford can once again
be at the forefront of change by
giving its students Veterans Day
off next year and all subsequent
years.
