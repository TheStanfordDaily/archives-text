## Business prof wins award for research 
### Arthur Hu 
The American Marketing As
sociation this year has given Busi
ness Prof. V. "Seenu" Srinivasan
its highest award in the field of
market research.
At its annual marketing re
search conference on Sept. 30, the
association presented Srinivasan,
a member of the Stanford faculty
since 1974, the prestigious 1996
Charles Coolidge Parlin Award.
The award — given annually
since 1945 — was based on Srini
vasan's trailblazing ideas and pro
cedures in "measuring, under
standing and using consumer
preference information."

"I'm really delighted to be rec
ognized as a leader in the area,"
Srinivasan said. "It is very impor
tant to me because when I was a
grad student, I had no idea I
would go into marketing. . . . This
whole set of things gave me the
opportunity to see that marketing
is really a useful thing."
James Lattin, associate profes
sor of marketing and manage
ment sciences, said Srinivasan "is
a well-known scholar who is held
in high esteem in his field" and
who also takes teaching seriously.
Lattin said students at the
Graduate School of Business
rated Srinivasan an excellent
teacher who explains difficult
concepts well.
Srinivasan's area of specialty
is conjoint analysis, a subdivision
within marketing focused on pre
dicting how customers will react
to certain products and then tai
loring and producing products so
customers will react favorably.
The premise behind the field is
"to see how customers react and
then give them what they want
rather than trying to shove a
product down their throats,"
Srinivasan said.
His work in the field is not
merely theoretical, however.
Conjoint analysis, which is being
studied by other researchers, is
often applied in business market
ing companies and helps improve

customer welfare, said Srini
vasan.
According to Lattin, Srini
vasan "does fundamental re
search but also teaches people
how it is valuable."
The recent award from the as
sociation is only the latest in a
long string of honors for Srini
vasan. He has received the Presi
dent's Gold Medal of the Indian
Institute of Technology, the supe
rior teaching award from the Uni
versity of Rochester's MBA pro
gram and several notable awards
for the best published research
paper in his field.
When asked what the future
holds, Srinivasan said, "I will con
tinue to work in this area for a
longtime."
He currently is researching
different methods of collecting
data from products that contain
many variants — such as comput
ers and electronics — as well as
refining his older ideas.
