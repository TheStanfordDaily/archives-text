## Business prof wins award for research 
### Arthur Hu 
The American Marketing As
sociation this year has given Busi
ness Prof. V. "Seenu" Srinivasan
its highest award in the field of
market research.
At its annual marketing re
search conference on Sept. 30, the
association presented Srinivasan,
a member of the Stanford faculty
since 1974, the prestigious 1996
Charles Coolidge Parlin Award.
The award — given annually
since 1945 — was based on Srini
vasan's trailblazing ideas and pro
cedures in "measuring, under
standing and using consumer
preference information."

"I'm really delighted to be rec
ognized as a leader in the area,"
Srinivasan said. "It is very impor
tant to me because when I was a
grad student, I had no idea I
would go into marketing. . . . This
whole set of things gave me the
opportunity to see that marketing
is really a useful thing."
James Lattin, associate profes
sor of marketing and manage
ment sciences, said Srinivasan "is
a well-known scholar who is held
in high esteem in his field" and
who also takes teaching seriously.
Lattin said students at the
Graduate School of Business
