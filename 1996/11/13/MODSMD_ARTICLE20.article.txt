## Stanford's finest month 
### 
ALL OF A sudden, it seems a bit
brighter out. Midterms are almost
done, the birds are singing and for
the first time in quite a while, I'm not writ
ing about politics ...
I love November more than any other
month. It's a damn good time to be on the
Farm, and here are a few reasons why:
1. Bon Appetit = Standard Oil
About a week into fall quarter of my
freshman year, The Daily ran a story pro
claiming that Taco Bell would open its
doors in Tresidder by the end of the quar
ter. So they were off by three years....
With fanfare and free T-shirts, Polio Rey is
finally open.
Has anyone else noticed that Dean of
Students Marc Wais looks a lot like Teddy
Roosevelt? Alcohol policy problems aside,
our dean of students sure knows how to
bust a trust. It's not a bit too soon, but the
Bon Appetit monopoly is finally history.
Students have suffered from the Tresidder
cartel for far too long, and if it were ever in
doubt that price fixing exists in our stu
dent union, did you notice that the Coffee
House is selling bottles of Corona for $1.50
all of a sudden?
2. Meet me at Maples
The United Center. Pauley Pavilion.
Madison Square Garden. MAPLES
PAVILION. They all belong together, and
if you don't know why, you should trans
fer. BASKETBALL SEASON starts
tonight, with the men hosting the German

national team at 7:30 p.m. The women
host the Slovakian national team tomor
row night, but the real season starts Sun
day morning when the No. 1 Stanford
women host No. 2 Alabama in a rematch of
last year's NCAA West Regional Semifinal.
Between our men's and women's
teams, Stanford has more talent than any
other school in the country, bar none.
Expectations for our men's team are the
highest in more than 50 years; Brevin
Knight is generally considered the top
point guard in the country, and we have
the potential to start three players taller
than 6-foot-9. A Pacific 10 Conference
championship is certainly within reach.
The women's team ain't all bad either.
Last year's squad came within two games
of the national title, and the only personnel
change this year is in the coaching staff —
we get our Olympic champion coach back
after losing one healthy player to gradua
tion. Let Vanessa Nygaard's chest-bump
ing festival begin ...
Bottom line: If the masterminds in the
Department of Athletics' marketing divi
sion don't fmd a way to sell out Maples all
year, they couldn't sell free ice in hell.
3. There is nothing offensive about
offense
After failing to score a single point dur
ing the third quarter all year, Stanford's
offense finally got its act together, just in
time to make football season exciting.
Somehow, Stanford fmds itself in bowl
contention, and after an abysmal 2-5 start,

Big Game may actually have postseason
ramifications for BOTH teams.
Unless you were at the Dave Matthews
concert or were in Tibet this weekend, you
probably know that our football team beat
USC. The real story isn't that we won, but
that we beat them on the ground. Football
teams cannot win consistently without a
running game, and Mike Mitchell's 147-
yard masterpiece gives me hope that our
offense may continue to improve all the
way to the Sun Bowl.
In order for Big Game to mean some
thing, we MUST beat Washington State
this Saturday. University President Ger
hard Casper considers it a "moral obliga*
tion" for students to donate money to their
alma mater after graduation. I consider it
an equally important obligation for stu
dents to go to the game this weekend.
By the way, a note about the USC band:
They don't play one song, they play two.
"Conquest" is not the song which the band
played 49 times last Saturday; that's
"Tribute to Troy." The band only plays
"Conquest" after the Trojans score. In
other words, "Conquest" was not played at
all after halflime.

Jim Finsten's sister Beth plays the cymbals
in the USC marching band. He'd like to
remind her not to play when Stanford has
the ball.

ALL OF A sudden, it seems a bit
brighter out. Midterms are almost
done, the birds are singing and for
