RAs were sent into battle without the proper equipment

WHILE IT IS encouraging to see
Dean of Students Marc Wais and
Director of Residential Educa
tion Jane Camarillo now taking steps to
address resident assistants' concerns
about party planning and alcohol policy
enforcement, I cannot easily ignore the
fact that, given a few simple actions on
their part, much of this commotion could
have been avoided.
To be sure, what we are seeing today is
crisis management in lieu of genuine lead
ership. Had real leadership prevailed, our
residence staffs would not have been
asked to fulfill such a large, ambiguous
mandate while being given only a meager
show of support. The RAs clearly did not
understand the new policy guidelines, did
not endorse them and never had a legiti
mate chance to make them work as their
input was not solicited. If Camarillo and
Wais were military generals, they would
be guilty of sending their troops into bat
tle armed with cheap Super Soakers.
In his Nov. 5 Daily column, Wais point
ed his finger at "various sources through
out the campus community" for spread-

ing "inaccurate and sometimes confusing
messages" about the alcohol policy. This
is nonsense. The real source of this confu
sion is the dean's failure to communicate
in honest and direct terms with the resi
dence staffs who were charged with imple
menting this policy. For him to say other
wise is akin to a tank commander blaming
the enemy for leading his troops into a
crossfire. Make no mistake: When we ask
RAs to do a job, to pitch a plan, to go out
on the proverbial limb, they deserve all
the information and support we can give
them. Instead of pointing fingers, the
dean should pause and consider why his
residence staffs must read The Daily to
get the answers they need.
If this had been the first time RAs
were asked to complete a mission without
adequate communication and support,
Camarillo and Wais would deserve to be
let off with a simple warning. But this is
not their first offense. Having served as
an RA last year, I know of at least one
other important occasion where residence
staffs were treated like lemmings — we
were herded together in training, handed

a new "grape policy" and forced to go run
ning off a cliff without a lifeline. And
when we spun into action to offer
improvements to the policy, we met the
same quiet resistance, the same lack of
support, the same frustrating paralysis
that RAs are experiencing today. Indeed,
the grape policy was promoted to us like a
Nike commercial: Just do it. And do it we
did.
Now that this latest group of RAs has
taken the big cliff plunge, it is time for
Camarillo, Wais and other supporters of
residential education to recognize that
real leadership does not consist of pushing
the herd from behind. For the last six
weeks, the RAs have been fighting on the
front lines trying to make these party
planning guidelines work. For their
efforts, they were rewarded with a paltry
show of support. To be sure, if military
generals forced their troops to find
answers in school newspapers, they would
all be dragged into court and promptly
shot.
Now I happen to like Dean Wais, and I
am certainly no stranger to those who

work in the Office of Residential Educa
tion — it gives me no pleasure to stand
here and cry "foul." It seems fair to say,
however, that the RAs have been taken
for granted while fighting this little war
against alcohol abuse. They deserve more
and so do we.
Instead of treating RAs like lemmings
whenever there is a new policy initiative,
we ought to solicit their input as valued
experts who have em important role to
play. To have done so before RA training
would have been an exercise of real lead
ership. Now, however, in calling for a
review five weeks after the plan has hit
the fan, Wais and Camarillo are simply
managing a crisis.
Stopping alcohol abuse is noble goal,
and the dean deserves credit for tackling
such a complex issue. But as long as we
continue to give mandates without sup
port, create policies without honest com
munication and use crisis management in
place of leadership, we will always fall
short of our goals.
