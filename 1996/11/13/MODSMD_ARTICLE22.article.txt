# Bloomie's opening: A missed opportunity for social criticism
## 
### 
I hope I wasn't one of the only Stan
ford students who didn't know whether
to laugh or cry at the article "Time to fill
lots of big brown bags," Monday's front
page article detailing Bloomingdale's
grand opening. This ridiculous ode to
consumer capitalism reduced people to
blundering idiots as they marveled at
"30-foot streamers" and "life-size 'big
brown bags.' "
Instead of condemning this ridiculous

newfound status quo, the article com
ments on important people like the Cali
fornia governor's wife and the mayor of
Palo Alto festively cutting the ribbon.
Instead of commenting on the absurdity
of important political figures attending a
Bloomingdale's inauguration in the face
of proposition crises and other social
problems, the article goes on to spew a
wonderful selection of banal quotes.
The best quote was from Palo Alto
Mayor Lanie Wheeler: "Palo Alto is a
very special community; it is now even
more special because of Bloomingdale's."
Everybody knows Palo Alto is a "special"
community; the wonderful fence that sep
arates East Palo Alto from the Mercedes
driving bourgeoisie should tell us that

much. But to attach social self-worth to a
store that sells overpriced passe Euro
trash imitation garments to people who
aren't cultured enough to know the dif
ference is a crime.
I especially liked the little "personal
stories" about random people who picked
up "mint green cashmere sweaters with
dangling price tags for $480" or the
Sawyers who decided to fly out a week
later to visit their daughter so they could
hit the Bloomingdale's inauguration
(wow, they know how to kill two birds
with one stone, don't you think?).
All the material for criticism is there,
hut these potentially ironic stories go
uncriticized and thus seem to further
commend the new consumer meoca of

Palo Alto.
On the other hand, maybe we should
commend this article and be grateful to
Bloomingdale's. After all, they did proud
ly sponsor our football game (maybe we
shoula've been cheering for the "big
brown bag" instead) and seem to have
some rather "sketchy" connections with
Stanford.
Yet, however idealistic as this may
sound, I still have faith that there are
some people out there aware enough to
realize that parading around the Stanford
Shopping Center with a "big brown bag"
will not redeem you for past social sins or
make you a morally better person.
