# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Playing The Game: If you try, you too can win 
### 
AH, YOUNG LOVE. It all seemed
like a scene from some movie,
framed as it was in the window of
my room. A little boy, a little girl, both
probably about 12. He offers her a flower,
and she compensates him with a kiss, a
little peck on the cheek. It was all like a
photo on one of those cute and corny
Hallmark cards, only not in black and
white.
How silly, I thought. Such romance at
Stanford. I looked around for a camera
crew, maybe one filming the opening
scenes of "My Girl 3." But none was to be
found. So, the courtship playing out
before me was really real. Arid the little
boy and the little girl looked really happy.
Ah, and they don't know anything
about The Game.
You know what I mean. The Game
that none of us are very good at,
because none of us really knows the
rules — at least, all of the rules. Of
course, there are those people out there
who seem good at it. They make up
their own rules, so they know how to

play. They are called Players.
No, at their young age, they're not
nearly immature enough yet to under
stand how it all happens, how it's all
supposed to work. And here, by "sup
posed to," I mean "shouldn't happen
but does."
Unless you've spent your formative
years (ages 3 and up) trapped in a tar pit,
none of what I'm referring to here should
be new to you. Of course, I'm sure that
some of us, especially those of us in
"healthy-type relationships," will insist
that we're above it all. "I'm too old to play
these silly games," you might say, mean
ing, of course, The Game. And some of us
(currently) sitting on the sidelines may
feel that we're not even in The Game at
all. But we are . ..
Look at the telephone. Yes, the one on
your desk. You are sitting at your desk.
The telephone is within arm's reach. It
rings. Do you answer it?
No! Not yet. Wait. It rings again and
you pick it up. Sure, I know that it's only
the UPS woman calling to let you know

they found your computer somewhere
near East Lansing, Mich., but that's not
the point. The point is that you wouldn't
dare answer the phone on the first ring,
lest anyone — even Shirley in customer
service — be led to believe that your life is
so boring and so empty and so hopeless
that you have nothing better to do than
sit around and answer the phone on the
first ring.
Don't worry — you're not the only
one. Pick up the phone and call some
people you know. Call some people you
don't know. Make note of how many
times the other side answers right in
the middle of the second ring. Assuming
you've controlled for answering
machines and "screening," your results
should be statistically significant.
Of course, that's just some evolution
ary evidence for The Game, a little proof
that it's innate behavior in all of us.
There's always room for individual
deviations. Some people are less prac
ticed than others. Some are late
starters. Some take a little longer.

Take for example, a friend of mine
who came complaining about her
boyfriend of eight months (that is, the
relationship was eight months old, not
the boyfriend). I told her I was there for
her if she wanted to talk about it. She
smiled and summed up her problem con
cisely in one sentence:
"Basically it seems like we should take
that next step but I don't know what that
means after all we haven't reached that
next step because what is that next step I
mean it's not like we're getting married
or anything because actually I could see
us getting married but of course we're
not because I'm not marrying anyone
right now but if I were and I'm not who
knows what would happen but of course
that's not going to happen so nothing's
going to happen and I think he finds that
boring."
Apparently, he craves The Game (See
also: The Pursuit, The Chase). Maybe he
wanted to be a Player but wasn't quite
suited for it. For him, winning isn't
everything, it's the end of things.

"These things take time," I think I
said to her, not sure what I was thinking.
The Game can be an evil, ridiculously
unnecessary means to a happy end in our
lives. It causes conflict and complication
and then thrives on the confusion it cre
ates. What keeps us going is the fact —
and I do believe with all my heart and ail
my soul that it is a fact — that The Game
can be overcome. It can be won, even if it
may require several overtimes.
Those little kids I saw outside my win
dow know that The Game is no match for
the simple things in life, like love. People
can agree to stop playing The Game. All
it takes is for someone or something to
cut through all the nonsense.
Something as simple as a flower and a
peck on the cheek.

The Game is not to be confused with Big
Game.
