## Computers essential in future of biological research 
### Arthur Hu 
A melding of the most recent
computer technology with the lat
est research in biology has fueled
the growth of the field of study
called bioinformatics.
Bioinformatics is "the applica
tion of information technology to
problems in biology or bio
medicine," according to Asst.
Medicine and Computer Science
Prof. Russ Altman.
"We look at problems, the basic
information contained and how we
can computerize it and represent it
in such a way that it can be used for
multiple purposes," Altman
explained.
In part because of the promi
nence of the Human Genome Pro
ject — which seeks to sequence all
human chromosomes — bioinfor
matics has received a lot of atten
tion. Chromosome mapping
requires computational technolo
gy-
Bioinformatics has also been
instrumental in aiding research of
the structure of bacterial ribo
somes and predicting three-dimen
sional structures based on the
DNA sequence. Determining the
relationships between sequence
and function among genes has
been greatly aided by bioinformat
ics.
Bioinformatics began in the
early 1980s as part of a large
research program at the National

Library of Medicine that focused
on information retrieval and
access. Toward the end of the

1980s, the burgeoning flow of
information in large protein and
DNA databases forced bioinfor

matics into the limelight.
Around that time, Stanford
began to add bioinformatics course
work to the Medical Information
Sciences Program, a program with
in the School of Medicine. Stan
ford's is currently one of fewer
than 10 programs nationwide.
Medicine Prof. Ted Shortliffe,
director of the information sciences
program, emphasized the key role
of bioinformatics. Paraphrasing
Francis Collins, the head of the
Human Genome Project at the
National Institutes of Health, he
said, "People can no longer do
molecular biology without bioinfor
matics. Nobody should fail to be
exposed to bioinformatics projects.
Understanding the tools and how
to use them is very effective."
"The goal [of bioinformatics] is
to understand how living things
function," said Assoc. Biochem
istry Prof. Doug Brutlag. "We
study the flow of information from
the genome to the phenotype. It
has a lot to do with molecular biol
ogy, which is in essence also an
informational science, in that it
wants to understand the flow of
information on a molecular level."
In addition, use of the Internet
tremendously speeds up the rate of
information dispersal within the
field.
"Today, biological information,
new genes, new proteins, new
structures are all published on the
World Wide Web first. By the time

something finds its way into a jour
nal or book, it's already relatively
old," Brutlag said.
Brutlag demonstrated his point
by showing that any user with a
computer, access to the Internet
and a knowledge of the field has
mountains of digital information
about biological fields available.

The field also
holds great pot
ential in the med
ical world.
Among the areas
under research in
the field are diag
nostic DNA
probes, which
allow diagnoses
to examine more
closely the root
cause in the
genome, rather
than the sec
ondary and visi
ble effects.
Researchers also
are looking for
quicker and more
effective diag
noses of more
common ail
ments, such as
sore throats.
At Stanford,
bioinformatics is
an interdisci
plinary program
involving many
elements from

fields such as genomics, computa
tional biology and population biolo

sciences program.
Brutlag said bioinformatics is
definitely moving in the direction
of becoming a well-defined disci
pline and that there is the possi
bility of an interdisciplinary
bioinformatics in the fu
ture.
"Job interest is very strong. At
a time when other medical scien

tists and biologists have trouble
getting academic positions, our
grad students are getting multiple
offers," Shortliffe said.
Although the information sci
ences program only offers gradu
ate degrees, undergraduates may
take courses within it.
