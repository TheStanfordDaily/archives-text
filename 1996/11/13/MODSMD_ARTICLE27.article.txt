Weather report from Mars ...
While Electrical Engineering Prof. Len Tyler will not be taking
a trip to Mars anytime soon, he will be fulfilling a long-awaited
goal of conducting daily weather reports from the planet.
Tyler is leading the international radio science team for the
Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which contains instruments

designed to orbit Mars and send back data for one
year.
Tyler and his team are expecting to obtain the
most precise measurements ever of pressure and
temperature changes on Mars.
Among the various methods involved in measur
ing these changes is the radio occultation tech
nique, which was both invented and developed at
Stanford. Using this, researchers hope to gather

weather data more accurate than any about Earth.
The radio occultation technique was first suggested by Von R.
Eschleman, professor emeritus of electrical engineering, and his
student Gunnar Fjeldbo in the 19605. It has been perfected only
recently, and scientists have already begun to apply the technique
to Earth.
Originally, the first project developed by the radio science team
was the Mars Observer satellite. Unfortunately, NASA lost com
munication with the satellite only three days before it would have
reached Mars. The current Mars Global Surveyor was approved
by NASA as a low-cost "recovery" program to make up for the
loss.
'Two-for-one' liver transplants
The first successful "two-for-one" liver transplant in the Bay
Area was performed by a trio of surgeons at the Stanford Medical
Center.
The method calls for portions of one donor liver

to be transplanted into two patients. It was only the
12th split transplant to be attempted at Stanford in
nearly three years.
. The two recipients of the transplant were an 11-
| month-old baby boy with a congenital illness and a
l()3-year-old woman suffering from an incurable
'liver tumor.
The operation consisted of a complex three-wav

procedure that involved a large team, including three surgeons:
Acting Asst. Surgery Prof. Waldo Concepcion, Liver Transplant
Program Director and Surgery Prof. Carlos Esquivel and Acting
Assoc. Surgery Prof. Samuel So.
The operations were conducted simultaneously in order to
minimize any damage from the prolonged preservation of the
donor liver. Because the liver is one of the few organs that can
regenerate itself, the transplanted liver segments are expected to
grow to normal size in both patients.
Split transplants are important procedures that can alleviate
the problems of a limited donor pool.
"The essential message is that this procedure can increase a
critically scarce donor pool," So said in a press release.
