# Alternative immune boosters examined
## No agreement on efficacy of supplements in increasing immunity to flu and colds 
### Mignon Fogarty Contributing writer 
Unconventional forms of thera
py — such as vitamin supplements
— are becoming increasingly popu
lar in the United States. But clini
cal proof of the effectiveness of
such supplements in boosting the
immune system is scant.
"Most things taken in orally are
ignored by the immune system,"
said Asst. Immunology and
Rheumatology Prof. Ron Van Vol
lenhoven. "Claims of immune
enhancement are very diffuse and
don't mean very much. In fact, you
probably wouldn't even want
excessive stimulation of the
immune system because it could
lead to autoimmune disease."
Following is a summary of the
claims and proof for four common
remedies for colds and flu.
Vitamin C
Perhaps the least disputed rem
edy and most commonly taken
vitamin, this antioxidant is water
soluble and therefore needs to be
taken throughout the day to keep
body levels constant.
"It has been clinically proven
that high doses of vitamin C can
decrease your risk of getting a
cold," Van Vollenhoven said.
However, he doubts that vita
min C acts by any direct immune
system stimulation. "Vitamin C's
effects are probably due to stimula
tion of nonspecific host defenses
and probably not related to the
immune system," he said.
Even the benefits of vitamin C
are not without controversy. The
Mayo Clinic site on the World Wide
Web advises that the long-term
risks of taking high doses of vita
min C are not known and that
there is no proof it prevents colds.
Garlic (Allium sativum)
Garlic is quite possibly the most
studied herb, and researchers have
found it to be central to numerous
immune responses.
According to a review in the
Journal of the National Medical
Association, garlic enhances the
activity of macrophages and cyto
toxic T-cells in cell cultures.
Both are critical elements of the
immune system. Macrophages
engulf and eliminate pathogens
such as bacteria from the body, and
cytotoxic T-cells kill cells in the

body that have already become
infected.
Additionally, studies with mice
have revealed that garlic protects
against intranasal inoculation with
influenza viruses.
It is not known whether garlic
affects humans in the same way.
Scientists still are studying
whether garlic acts directly on
immune cells or whether it stimu
lates other factors that then act on
the cells.

Few large clinical studies have
been conducted in humans. How
ever, a recent National Cancer
Institute study of 4,000 people
from Italy and China, showed that
those who recalled eating diets
high in garlic or onions had a sub

stantially lower incidence of stom
ach cancer than those who
abstained from this pungent herb.
But don't get carried away. In
addition to potential social draw
backs of excessive garlic consump
tion, there have been a few report
ed cases of bleeding problems m
people taking very large amounts
of garlic (more than 10 raw cloves a
day), presumably because of anti
coagulant activity in the herb.
In addition, some herbalists

claim too much garlic can deplete
your intestinal flora and make it
harder to absorb nutrients.

versity Medical Center.
Echinacea (Echinacea pur
purea)
It is against General Nutrition
Center policy to endorse the bene
fits of any supplements. However,
Bill Akell, manager of the center's
store in the Stanford Shopping
Center pointed to echinacea as his
best-selling purported immune
booster.
"We can't really say that it does
something because you can't prove
that it does." Akell said.
However, he added, "I wouldn't
be without it this time of year I
think it works great."
Echinacea, a member of the
sunflower family, is native to the
central United States and hails
back to a Native American herbal
tradition. Proponents claim that it
increases the number of circulat
ing immune cells.
Very little research has been
done in the United States on echi
nacea; however, it is very popular
in Germany where more than 300
echinacea products are available.
Cordula Schultz, a German
postdoctoral fellow in the Develop
mental Biology Department, con
firmed that many people in Ger
many take echinacea to enhance
their immune system.
Schultz's experiences also show
that no supplement can be taken
without risk. When she took echi
nacea for a cold, she experienced an
allergic reaction
"I started to feel like my cold
was getting worse right after tak
ing echinacea I went upstairs, and
the next thing I knew, I was on the
floor." she said "For a few seconds,
I had lost consciousness."
Two studies reported in jour
nals not typically reviewed by the
U.S. medical community claim
that patients taking echinacea sup
plements experienced fewer infec
tions than those taking a placebo, a
sugar pill control. When patients
did get sick, taking echinacea
had less severe symptoms and were
sick for fewer days.
Zinc

College researchers in 1991 creat

eral by reporting that a zinc
