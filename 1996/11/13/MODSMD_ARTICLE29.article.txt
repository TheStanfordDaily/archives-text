Q.How do radar guns work?
• How can I avoid them?
A .Radar guns are based on a
• simple physical principle
called the Doppler effect.
The Doppler effect is most easi
ly observed in the change in pitch
of a passing siren. You've probably
noticed that when an ambulance or
fire truck passes you with its sirens
blaring, the pitch of the sound
changes. It starts out high-pitched
and shrill, and then as the siren

passes you, the pitch becomes
lower.
This change in the pitch, or fre
quency, of a sound is called the
Doppler frequency shift. Constant
pitched sounds reflected or gener
ated by objects approaching a lis
tener are higher-pitched than the
original sounds. Conversely,
objects moving away have lower
pitches.
The pitch of a sound that you
hear is directly related to the fre
quency of the sound that hits your
ears. The frequency is the number
of wave fronts that hit your ear in a
certain amount of time.

It's a lot like standing at the
beach and seeing how often the
waves wash up around your feet
— it's a periodic process, meaning
you can stand there and count the
number of waves that hit your
feet within one minute.
Imagine that instead of just
standing on the beach, you were on
"Baywatch" and you had to run in
toward the water to save a drown
ing person's life.
The waves would hit you more
often because you are running
toward them. The time between
waves will decrease, so the number
of waves per minute you encounter

will increase. This means that the
frequency of waves goes up, as long
as you continue to move closer to
the ocean.
Now, after you save the drown
ing person's life, you have to bring
the lucky soul back to the beach so
all the scantily clad people on the
beach can gather around you and
gasp and look worried as you per
form CPR.
As you run out of the water, the
frequency of waves that hit you
goes down because you are running
away from the waves. That is
essentially how the Doppler effect
works.

The radar gun emits a constant
frequency of radio waves while a
receiver detects reflections of the
radio waves from passing objects.
Using the change in frequency of
the radio waves reflected back to
the gun, the speed of the object can
be determined using the Doppler
principle
So, to avoid detection by a radar
gun, you have to prevent your car
from reflecting radio waves back to
the detector
This is extremely hard to do, as
radio waves are reflected by the
metal frame and engine block in
most cars. In order to prevent radio

waves from bouncing oft those sur
faces. you would have to cover your
car with something that absorbed
or diverted the radio waves.
Stealth planes are covered in
radio-absorbing materials. But it
would cost upward of a quarter of
a million dollars to cover your car
in the same stuff. And if you do
the math, you'd see that you'd
have to avoid a whole lot of speed
ing tickets to make it worth the
expense.
Oh well, at least you know how
radar guns work.
And you thought "Baywatch"
wasn't educational ..
