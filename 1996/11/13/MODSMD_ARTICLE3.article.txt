# Immigration laws may pack heavy blow

New federal immigration legis
lation may have a significant im
pact on the lives of international
students in the United States —
and most of them are not even
aware of it.
The Illegal Immigration Re
form and Immigrant Responsibil
ity Act of 1996 puts new restric
tions on the time that interna
tional students can spend in the
United States.
One of the major changes deals
with visa overstays. As a result of
recent federal legislation, foreign
students could face severe penal
ties if they forget to renew their
visa and fail to maintain appropri
ate status.

Although the law will not take
effect until April 1,1997, "It could
obviously have serious conse
quences," Bechtel International
Center Director John Pearson
said in an e-mail message sent to
international students.
According to the new law, if
students overstay more than six
months but less than a year, they
will be barred from re-entering
the United States for three years.
If they overstay more than a year,
the time is extended to 10 years.
However, waivers are available if
the student is the spouse or child
of a U.S. citizen or permanent res
ident.
Currently, most people who
fail to renew their visas in time
usually travel to Mexico, Canada
or somewhere near the United
States in order to obtain a new
visa. However, Pearson said, "It
may become harder to do so in
countries other than students'
own. In fact this provision of the
bill might become the first to be
implemented."
According to the Association of
International Educators, one
third of the world's 1.2 million in
ternational students choose to
study in the United States. Al
most 450,000 foreign students
are currently enrolled in U.S. col
leges and universities.
At Stanford, about 2,500 stu
dents, most of whom are graduate
students, hail from a different
country. According to the Bechtel
International Center, Chinese,
Indian, Canadian, Korean and
Japanese students make up the
largest portion.
Doctoral student Lin Yong
Tang, chair of the Association of
Chinese Students and Scholars at
Stanford, said, "I didn't know
anything about it. I think the law
is ludicrous and too strict because
it happens a lot. I have to notify
students as soon as possible. It
could cause a big damage on our
research."
Graduate student Nobuteru
Takeda, chair of the Japanese As
sociation, admitted he didn't
know about the law either. "I'm
so surprised; it is going to be pan
icky," he said.
According to law student
Emma Luevano, the tricky part is
that the new law does not seem
realistic until somebody falls vic
tim to it.
The law could cause damage
not only to research but also "dev
astate families economically and

emotionally because some fami
lies could be separated," said Lue
vano, who works as a student peer
adviser at the international cen
ter. "This is something that inter
national students must know
about."
Pearson added that he thinks
the law reflects current attitudes
toward immigration.
"As we are all aware there has
been plenty of discussion in the
media concerning immigration —
probably it all comes down to who
should be allowed to come to the
United States and in what num
bers," he said. "Within these dis
cussions and resulting legislation
are aspects that will affect inter
national students."
Rolando Villalobos, assistant
director at the international cen
ter, said he sees the visa restric
tion part of the law as positive.
"It will force students to look
at their documents," he said. The
international center "does more
than most for students and we are
beyond the call. We even check
when the students' visas expire
and notify them through e-mail.
Students must be more responsi
ble for their own documents."
He added that the law is going
to be harsher only if students for
get to renew their visas.
However, in addition to the
stricter law for overstaying the
visa, Villalobos said the govern
ment is going to control interna
tional students much more tight
ly-
Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Services "is re-engineering
the controlling of international
students. They want to track stu
dents. They want to know what
they are doing from the day they
requested their visa to the day
they physically enter the United
States," Villalobos said.
Explaining the cause for the
law, Bill Strassberger, public af
fairs officer at the INS headquar
ters in Washington, D.C., said,

"We consider that everybody who
comes to the U.S. as potential im
migrants. Foreign students are
not the exception."
According to the new law, INS
will initially track all students
and scholars from five countries
beginning Jan. 1, 1998. By the
year 2001, this tracking will ex
tend to all foreign countries. The
original five countries are yet to
be determined.
In addition, academic institu
tions will be required to collect in
formation such as student identi
ty, date of visa issued, academic
status and any disciplinary action
taken by the institution as a re
sult of any criminal conviction by
the student. Schools also will be
required to report this informa
tion to INS electronically.
The law also requires interna
tional students to pay close to
$100 as a "document fee" to the
institution where they intend to
study.
"It might not be too much, and
students will never know the fact
that they are paying additional
cost because it is going to be just
added to other fees," Villalobos
said. "But it means that students
are going to pay to have someone
collect data on them."
Villalobos predicted that the
major problem is going to be the
process.
"We don't know how we are
going to collect this data and send
them electronically to INS," he
said. "Some small schools don't
even have capabilities that we
have. Usually bigger institution
are better equipped electronical
ly. It's going to be mostly a nega
tive impact on the administrators
rather than on the students."
Villalobos said he thinks these
changes happened for a reason.
"It has a foundation in phobia,
the traditional scapegoat mental
ity that American politicians use
to blame nonimmigrants in the
U. 5.," he said.
