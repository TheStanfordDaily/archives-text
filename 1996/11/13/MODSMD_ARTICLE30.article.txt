## Busy weekend Sailors have mixed luck 
### David McGee Contributing writer 
It was a tale of two regattas this weekend for the
Stanford sailing team.
It was the best of times for the sailors who competed
at the Freshman / Sophomore and Women's Fall
Championships at Marina del Rey, Calif., while for
juniors John Meade and Danny Ziinbaldi, who compet
ed at the Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association sin
gle-handed national championships in Charleston, S.C.,
the times weren't so great.
The Stanford participants in the freshman / sopho
more division dominated the 22-boat field of first- and
second-year sailors, finishing with three boats in the top
four places.
Sophomore skipper Tyler Doyle and freshman crew
Alexis Krivkovich finished first with eight points.
Freshmen Matt Addison and Brooke Morrill placed sec
ond, and freshman Martin Fichtner and sophomore
Allison Arnold took fourth with 10 and 16 points,
respectively.
"It's nice to finish the fall season strong," Doyle said.
"I had been sailing pretty well this year, but this is the
first time I could pull it all together."
According to Doyle, the absence of Stanford juniors
and seniors in the event made his victory much more
obtainable.
"It's easier to not have to worry about the older kids
beating you," he said.
The results were just as bright in the women's divi
sion, where freshman skipper Anika Leersson and
freshman crew Sage Cooke took first place after a tie
breaker with California's Annelise Moore. The sailors
were tied with 11 points after the
fourth and final race, but because
Leersson defeated Moore in that
race, Leersson claimed the victory.
Sophomore skipper Taylor
Robinson and freshman crew
Katie Gregg placed third with 12
points.
"This is not a big surprise," said
head coach Steve Bourdow.
"Anika already has all the skills
and is now learning how to nail
these boats."
"It was a lot of fun," Leersson
said. "When (Stanford senior)
Alice (Manard) decided not to go, I
knew I had a good chance to win.
"It shows how much more
depth we have when you can look
down the result sheet and almost
every third boat is from Stanford.
We're the most dominant team
out here."
The regatta was plagued by
very light winds, usually resting
between 0-2 knots throughout the
weekend. Due to the lack of wind,
only four races were completed.
It was a different story at the
single-handed national champi
onships in Charleston, however,
where extremely high winds
made the notoriously difficult
Charleston Harbor even more
troublesome.
Zimbaldi and Meade faced
winds ranging from 15-30 knots
throughout the weekend en
route to finishing seventh and
eighth, respectively, in the 16-
boat field.
"Finishing eighth was below
my goal," Meade said. "But consid
ering the conditions, I'm not too
unhappy."
Old Dominion's John Torger
son finished first, followed by Har
vard's Brett Davis. Both took a
year off from studies to compete
on the Olympic sailing circuit and
were the favorites going into the
regatta.
The high winds forced a differ
ent type of sailing than Meade is
used to.
"There was not a lot of strategy
or tactical knowledge involved," he
said. "It just came down to tech
nique and endurance. The other
guys had it; I didn't."
Meade and Zimbaldi were also
sailing in lasers, boats not often
practiced in by the Stanford squad.
"It's a hard regatta for them,"
Bourdow said. "It's good that
they finished in the top half, but
to go out there and grind like
that without training would be
difficult."
"I wasn't used to anything I
was doing out there," Meade said.
