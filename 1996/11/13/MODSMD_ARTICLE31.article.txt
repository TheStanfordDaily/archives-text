# Equestrians, Hoche excel

An aggressive ride earned Stanford sophomore
Amanda Hoche the high-point rider award Sunday
at the Stanford Red Barn.
! Hoche's honor capped a successful day for the
entire equestrian team as the Stanford women
topped riders from Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, UC-
Davis, Fresno State and Bakersfield College in the
open, intermediate and novice divisions. Fresno
won overall high-point team and Cal Poly took sec
ond.
Team president Hoche said the riders' success
resulted from focusing on the competition rather
than running the show. Riders must balance compe
tition with the Intercollegiate Horse Show Associa
tion rule that requires shows to be completely stu
dent-organized and run.
"It was a big improvement over last time," Hoche
said. "I went in with a plan and made it work. I had
a lot of determination."
Winning first place in the open fences division
and third on the flat wasn't the hardest part for
Hoche, who shared her riding gear with teammate
Lauren Patty.
"Sharing boots is hard," joked Hoche, referring
to her quick switch from rider to head show admin
istrator.
