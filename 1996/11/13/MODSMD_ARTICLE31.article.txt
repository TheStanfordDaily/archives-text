# Equestrians, Hoche excel
## 
### Erin M. Reilly Contributing writer 
An aggressive ride earned Stanford sophomore
Amanda Hoche the high-point rider award Sunday
at the Stanford Red Barn.
! Hoche's honor capped a successful day for the
entire equestrian team as the Stanford women
topped riders from Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, UC-
Davis, Fresno State and Bakersfield College in the
open, intermediate and novice divisions. Fresno
won overall high-point team and Cal Poly took sec
ond.
Team president Hoche said the riders' success
resulted from focusing on the competition rather
than running the show. Riders must balance compe
tition with the Intercollegiate Horse Show Associa
tion rule that requires shows to be completely stu
dent-organized and run.
"It was a big improvement over last time," Hoche
said. "I went in with a plan and made it work. I had
a lot of determination."
Winning first place in the open fences division
and third on the flat wasn't the hardest part for
Hoche, who shared her riding gear with teammate
Lauren Patty.
"Sharing boots is hard," joked Hoche, referring
to her quick switch from rider to head show admin
istrator.
Sophomore London Davies
resumed her winning way with a
first place in the flat novice
class. Davies, a newcomer to the
division and the team's "all-time
winning rider," said the main
challenge is competing aboard a
strange horse.
"I have to work a lot harder
now," Davies said of individual
competition. "But the team is
doing amazing — once we get
going we do really well."
Stanford coach Barbara Close
said the riders' achievements are
directly related to their training
over the last few weeks.
"We fixed a lot of things,"
Close said. "I gave a survey
inquiring what [the team] really
wanted from the team experi
ence, and I got a lot of insight.
We have gotten into what we
need to do to succeed."
The riders used one team
horse and several horses bor
rowed from the Stanford Eques
trian Center, Fresno State and
Stanford staff member Nancy
von Zwol, a manager and techni
cal administrator of the biology
technology laboratory at Stan
ford who donated four horses
from her Shoestring Farm in
Portola Valley. They jumped in
the advanced and intermediate
divisions.
"It is my first time to be
involved in the IHSA, and I
think it is a very good program,"
von Zwol said.
Sophomores Mandy Gillett
and Kathleen Gilbert captured
second place in their respective
divisions.
"I am very satisfied," said
Gilbert of her place in novice

over-fences. "But I always get a
little nervous. Sometimes you
have to remember to breathe."
Gilbert was surrounded by
fans, including her parents, who
traveled from Phoenix for the
competition.
"We saw her last year at a
show in [Los Angeles], and we
always think she looks great,"
said Cindy Gilbert, Kathleen's
mom. "We are impressed with
her improvement since last
year."
Gillett said her ribbon was
won by remembering her weak
ness, keeping her hands still and
the luck of the draw.
"I needed to stay organized
and be positive," said Gillett of
her over-fences round.
Sophomore Amanda Boyd was
bounding with positive energy
after her first time competing
over fences.
"To jump in one show in col
lege was my dream as an eques
trian," Boyd said.
Show stewards and team
alumni Emily Jones and Christi
na Russell were pleased with the
show, as was Close.
"It's been Amanda (Hoche),"
Close said. "She has done an
incredible job of organizing the
team."
Judge Kelly McKnight ex
pressed his support of the IHSA
program.
"This type of show is a great
idea. There is great equilibrium
[drawing horses to ride from a
hat], and it's a fabulous opportu
nity to ride," McKnight said.
McKnight, a trainer and pro
fessional rider from Pescadero,
said the show was refreshing
because "it isn't cutthroat or
absolute. It's about team sports
manship." The only drawback
"is drawing a crummy horse,"
McKnight said.
