# Hoops opens season with high hopes

Expectations.
Created by an unsympathetic
media, perpetuated by overzealous
fans and played down by coaches —
expectations are perhaps the single
most menacing psychological barrier
faced by top programs at the start of a
season.
And until recently, they weren't
much of an issue around these parts,
not when it carne to basketball — at
least men's basketball.
But all that has begun to change in
recent years, and no one man is more
responsible than Mike Montgomery.
Since stepping in as head coach 10
years ago, Montgomery has breathed
life into a program mired in medi
ocrity, transforming the Cardinal into
one of the most consistently success
ful teams on the West Coast.
"From my perspective, it's nice to
have a program that's gotten to the
point where people recognize and pay
attention to you," Montgomery said at
a preseason press conference Monday.
"But the other side of it is, can we live
up [to the expectations]? It remains to
be seen."
Living up to preseason expecta
tions was a problem for last year's
Cardinal, which began the year
ranked in the top 15 but was hit early
on with key injuries.
"People forgot what it was that had
gotten us to that point, which has
always been hard work and guys bust
ing their tails," Montgomery said. "I
thought we spent maybe a little bit
more time thinking about who we
were and what we were, and that hurt
us early on a little bit."
The result was an early-season
funk that included a stunning loss to
San Francisco and a 24-point shellack
ing at the hands of an uncharacteristi
cally ordinary North Carolina team.
Then again, last year's squad
returned all five starters and 93 per
cent of the offense from a 1994-95
team that finished 20-9 and advanced
to the second round of the NCAA
tournament. The optimism surround
ing this year's Cardinal — the men are
tabbed anywhere from No. 11 to No.
24 in preseason publications, 18th in
the AP poll and 14th in the coaches'
poll — is somewhat more surprising,
considering the loss of four starters to
graduation.
"I just don't understand where the
optimism is coming from," Mont
gomery said. "We've got a couple of
key players that have got to stay
healthy for us to even have a chance to
reach those expectations."
It's no secret who those "couple of
key players" are. If the Cardinal is to
advance as deep into the NCAA tour
nament as some prognosticators
believe they can, they must rely on the
play of senior point guard Brevin
Knight and junior center Tim Young.
While departed seniors Darren Ail
away, Andy Poppink, David Harbour
and Dion Cross brought leadership
and maturity to last year's team, none
had the kind of raw talent that can
single-handedly carry a team in
crunch time.
That's where Knight comes in. A

lightning-quick defender and consum
mate playmaker, Knight caught a lot
of eyes with his play in Stanford's two
NCAA tournament games — he tallied
27 points and nine assists in the Car
dinal's near-upset of top-ranked Mas
sachusetts — as well as his eight
point, five-assist performance in lead
ing the USA 22-and-under Select
Team to a near-upset of Dream Team
111 on national television July 6.
Indeed, Knight is widely regarded
as the best point man in the country
(only injured Kansas' Jacque Vaughn
makes it a contest) as he prepares to
embark on his senior campaign. He
has already been named to five presea
son first-team All-America squads and
is a candidate for both the Naismith
and John Wooden Player of the Year
awards. Knight is also Stanford's
career record-holder in steals and
assists and figures to put both those
records completely out of reach by sea
son's end. As he goes, so go the hopes
of the 1996-97 Cardinal.
"I think most of what is being said
about Brevin is accurate," Mont
gomery said. "He's matured and got
ten better every year and frankly has
been an unbelievable influence in our
basketball program."
Young, meanwhile, returns to the
court after sitting out last season with
a bulging disk in his lower back.
Because Young — one of the finest
freshman performers in the country
in 1994-95 when he averaged more
than 12 points and eight rebounds —
was declared a medical redshirt, he
retains three years of eligibility. At 7-
foot-1, 250 pounds, he gives the Cardi
nal the intimidating inside presence it
lacked last season.
But Young is merely the anchor of
a front line that boasts three players
6-8 or taller. Mark Seaton, a 6-9
sophomore who was a first-team All-
Pacific 10 Conference Freshman, shot
a team-leading 61 percent from the
floor last season while filling in at
power forward and as a backup center.
He will be competing for time with
junior Pete Van Elswyk (6-9), a trans
fer from South Carolina who sat out
last season as a redshirt, and Mark
Madsen (6-8), a 20-year-old freshman
who spent the last two years on a
Mormon mission.
And the well is even deeper. Pete
Sauer, a 6-7, 220-pound sophomore
who can score from inside and outside,
was a valuable role player last year
coming off the bench. This year he will
fight for a starting job at the small for
ward position with 6-6 senior Rich
Jackson, who returns after suffering a
torn anterior cruciate ligament late
last season. Freshman phenom Ryan
Mendez (6-7, 195), who shot an amaz
ing 54 percent from three-point terri
tory while leading the state of Texas in
scoring and rebounding as a high
school senior, will most likely serve in
a reserve role along with sophomore
Karl Wente.
Sophomore Kris Weems is the heir
apparent at the off-guard position.
Weems earned honorable mention All-
Pac-10 Freshman honors while serv
ing as a backup to Cross last season.
This year he'll be pushed by freshman
David Moseley, who was named player
of the year in the state of New Mexico

by USA Today. Sophomore point
guard Arthur Lee, another honorable
mention All-Pac-10 Freshman and
understudy to Knight, should also see
a lot of minutes. Mark Thompson and
Kamba Tshionyi will provide strong
play off the bench.
"We've got two kids that if they
stay healthy and have the kind of year
that we'd like to see them have, would
help us be competitive, perhaps at the
level that people are talking about, but
it's really going to depend an awful lot
on the other guys," Montgomery said.
"We have nine sophomores and fresh
men in our program, and one of the
things that people probably don't real
ize is how much experience is a factor

in winning.
"We need time to develop as a bas
ketball team. Some of these younger
players I think are talented players,
but they just don't do the things that
we're going to need to do to be suc
cessful [yet]."
Montgomery should have a better
idea of how things will shake out after
his squad faces the German national
team in a 7:30 p.m. exhibition game
tonight at Maples Pavilion. Stanford
will be without two key players, how
ever — Knight is taking time off to
recover from a case of quadriceps ten
dinitis, and Madsen is out with a

stress reaction in his lower back.
"We're not certain how long
it's going to be before we can get
those two kids back on the floor,"
Montgomery said. "If we had
everybody intact, with the four
inside people we have, I think
we'd be big and strong and very
physical, but we're not going to
start off the season with that par
ticular lineup intact.
The Cardinal will play another

exhibition game Tuesday against
the Chinese National Team
before kicking off the regular
season in Anchorage, Alaska.
Stanford makes its first-ever
appearance in the Great Alaska
Shootout Nov. 27-30. The eight
team tournament field features
NCAA champion Kentucky and
NCAA runner-up Syracuse.
Stanford also has a game against
Manhattan at Arco Arena in
Sacramento (Dec. 7), home dates
with Alaska-Anchorage (Dec. 18)
and Navy (Dec. 28), and road
games at San Diego and Seton
Hall before beginning Pac-10

play on Jan. 2.
By then, coaches, fans and
media alike should have a better
idea just how true all the hype is.
"I'm not uncomfortable with
[the expectations]," Montgomery
said. "It's always easier to be
picked seventh and finish second.
Anytime you're picked high, it just
makes it a little bit more difficult
for you. But if that expectation is
based on having the personnel
that can do it, then I'm grateful
for that, and I really do think that
with Brevin and Tim, if those two
guys play as well as they can, we
can be very good."

sachusetts — as well as his eight
point, five-assist performance in lead
ing the USA 22-and-under Select
Team to a near-upset of Dream Team
111 on national television July 6.
Indeed, Knight is widely regarded
as the best point man in the country
(only injured Kansas' Jacque Vaughn
makes it a contest) as he prepares to
embark on his senior campaign. He
has already been named to five presea
son first-team All-America squads and
is a candidate for both the Naismith
and John Wooden Player of the Year
awards. Knight is also Stanford's
career record-holder in steals and
assists and figures to put both those
records completely out of reach by sea
son's end. As he goes, so go the hopes
of the 1996-97 Cardinal.
"I think most of what is being said
about Brevin is accurate," Mont
gomery said. "He's matured and got
ten better every year and frankly has
been an unbelievable influence in our
basketball program."
Young, meanwhile, returns to the
court after sitting out last season with
a bulging disk in his lower back.
Because Young — one of the finest
freshman performers in the country
in 1994-95 when he averaged more
than 12 points and eight rebounds —
was declared a medical redshirt, he
retains three years of eligibility. At 7-
foot-1, 250 pounds, he gives the Cardi
nal the intimidating inside presence it
lacked last season.
But Young is merely the anchor of
a front line that boasts three players
6-8 or taller. Mark Seaton, a 6-9
sophomore who was a first-team All-
Pacific 10 Conference Freshman, shot
a team-leading 61 percent from the
floor last season while filling in at
power forward and as a backup center.
He will be competing for time with
junior Pete Van Elswyk (6-9), a trans
fer from South Carolina who sat out
last season as a redshirt, and Mark
Madsen (6-8), a 20-year-old freshman
who spent the last two years on a
Mormon mission.
And the well is even deeper. Pete
Sauer, a 6-7, 220-pound sophomore
who can score from inside and outside,
was a valuable role player last year
coming off the bench. This year he will
fight for a starting job at the small for
ward position with 6-6 senior Rich
Jackson, who returns after suffering a
torn anterior cruciate ligament late
last season. Freshman phenom Ryan
Mendez (6-7, 195), who shot an amaz
ing 54 percent from three-point terri
tory while leading the state of Texas in
scoring and rebounding as a high
school senior, will most likely serve in
a reserve role along with sophomore
Karl Wente.
Sophomore Kris Weems is the heir
apparent at the off-guard position.
Weems earned honorable mention All-
Pac-10 Freshman honors while serv
ing as a backup to Cross last season.
This year he'll be pushed by freshman
David Moseley, who was named player
of the year in the state of New Mexico

by USA Today. Sophomore point
guard Arthur Lee, another honorable
mention All-Pac-10 Freshman and
understudy to Knight, should also see
a lot of minutes. Mark Thompson and
Kamba Tshionyi will provide strong
play off the bench.
"We've got two kids that if they
stay healthy and have the kind of year
that we'd like to see them have, would
help us be competitive, perhaps at the
level that people are talking about, but
it's really going to depend an awful lot
on the other guys," Montgomery said.
"We have nine sophomores and fresh
men in our program, and one of the
things that people probably don't real
ize is how much experience is a factor

in winning.
"We need time to develop as a bas
ketball team. Some of these younger
players I think are talented players,
but they just don't do the things that
we're going to need to do to be suc
cessful [yet]."
Montgomery should have a better
idea of how things will shake out after
his squad faces the German national
team in a 7:30 p.m. exhibition game
tonight at Maples Pavilion. Stanford
will be without two key players, how
ever — Knight is taking time off to

stress reaction in his lower back.
"We're not certain how long
it's going to be before we can get
those two kids back on the floor,"
Montgomery said. "If we had
everybody intact, with the four
inside people we have, I think
we'd be big and strong and very
physical, but we're not going to
start off the season with that par
ticular lineup intact.
The Cardinal will play another

exhibition game Tuesday against
the Chinese National Team
before kicking off the regular
season in Anchorage, Alaska.
Stanford makes its first-ever
appearance in the Great Alaska
Shootout Nov. 27-30. The eight
team tournament field features
NCAA champion Kentucky and
NCAA runner-up Syracuse.
Stanford also has a game against
Manhattan at Arco Arena in
Sacramento (Dec. 7), home dates
with Alaska-Anchorage (Dec. 18)
and Navy (Dec. 28), and road
games at San Diego and Seton
Hall before beginning Pac-10

play on Jan. 2.
By then, coaches, fans and
media alike should have a better
idea just how true all the hype is.
"I'm not uncomfortable with
[the expectations]," Montgomery
said. "It's always easier to be
picked seventh and finish second.
Anytime you're picked high, it just
makes it a little bit more difficult
for you. But if that expectation is
based on having the personnel
that can do it, then I'm grateful
for that, and I really do think that
with Brevin and Tim, if those two
guys play as well as they can, we
can be very good."
Expectations.
Created by an unsympathetic
media, perpetuated by overzealous
fans and played down by coaches —
expectations are perhaps the single
most menacing psychological barrier
faced by top programs at the start of a
season.
And until recently, they weren't
much of an issue around these parts,
not when it carne to basketball — at
least men's basketball.
But all that has begun to change in
recent years, and no one man is more
responsible than Mike Montgomery.
Since stepping in as head coach 10
years ago, Montgomery has breathed
life into a program mired in medi
ocrity, transforming the Cardinal into
one of the most consistently success
ful teams on the West Coast.
"From my perspective, it's nice to
have a program that's gotten to the
point where people recognize and pay
attention to you," Montgomery said at
a preseason press conference Monday.
"But the other side of it is, can we live
up [to the expectations]? It remains to
be seen."
Living up to preseason expecta
tions was a problem for last year's
Cardinal, which began the year
ranked in the top 15 but was hit early
on with key injuries.
"People forgot what it was that had
gotten us to that point, which has
always been hard work and guys bust
ing their tails," Montgomery said. "I
thought we spent maybe a little bit
more time thinking about who we
were and what we were, and that hurt
us early on a little bit."
The result was an early-season
funk that included a stunning loss to
San Francisco and a 24-point shellack
ing at the hands of an uncharacteristi
cally ordinary North Carolina team.
Then again, last year's squad
returned all five starters and 93 per
cent of the offense from a 1994-95
team that finished 20-9 and advanced
to the second round of the NCAA
tournament. The optimism surround
ing this year's Cardinal — the men are
tabbed anywhere from No. 11 to No.
24 in preseason publications, 18th in
the AP poll and 14th in the coaches'
poll — is somewhat more surprising,
considering the loss of four starters to
graduation.
"I just don't understand where the
optimism is coming from," Mont
gomery said. "We've got a couple of
key players that have got to stay
healthy for us to even have a chance to
reach those expectations."
It's no secret who those "couple of
key players" are. If the Cardinal is to
advance as deep into the NCAA tour
nament as some prognosticators
believe they can, they must rely on the
play of senior point guard Brevin
Knight and junior center Tim Young.
While departed seniors Darren Ail
away, Andy Poppink, David Harbour
and Dion Cross brought leadership
and maturity to last year's team, none
had the kind of raw talent that can
single-handedly carry a team in
crunch time.
That's where Knight comes in. A

lightning-quick defender and consum
mate playmaker, Knight caught a lot
of eyes with his play in Stanford's two
NCAA tournament games — he tallied
27 points and nine assists in the Car
dinal's near-upset of top-ranked Mas
sachusetts — as well as his eight
point, five-assist performance in lead
ing the USA 22-and-under Select
Team to a near-upset of Dream Team
111 on national television July 6.
