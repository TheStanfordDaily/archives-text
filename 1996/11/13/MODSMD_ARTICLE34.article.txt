The dynasty lives on.
For the ninth year in a row, the
Stanford men's tennis team cap
tured the team title of the Rolex
Northern California Intercolle
giate Championship. Freshman
Bob Bryan continued the Card's
tradition by winning the singles
title, lengthening Stanford's sin
gles winning streak to four years.
In the championship match,
Bryan convincingly defeated
Washington's Nick Williams 6-4,
6-2. Williams had marched to the
finals by defeating four Stanford
players in a row, but Bryan was
able to end this streak. Bryan went
up a break early in both sets and
never looked back until the cham
pionship was in his hands.
"It feels good to win my first col
legiate tournament," Bryan said.
"It was a lot of fun. The guys were
tough, but I was on a roll — it just
went well."
In the semifinal round, Bryan
downed Washington's Sasha Rarn
pazzo 6-4, 6-3. In fact, Bryan won
all six of his singles matches in
straight sets.
"Mv parents were there," Bryan
said. "They have been my coach
since I was 6, and they know my
game really well. They helped me
win the tournament, as I did] the
Stanford coaches."
"Bob just got better with every
match," said head coach Dick
Gould.
In his first collegiate regional
tennis tournament, Cardinal

freshman Geoff Abrams advanced
to the semifinals where he was
defeated by Williams 6-3, 1-6, 7-5.
"My [semifinal] match could
have gone either way," Abrams
said. "I feel I played extremely well
though. I really wanted to play well
for the team and myself."
Washington's Williams also
defeated Stanford juniors Ross
Inouye and Charles Hoeveler as
well as upsetting the tournament's
No. 1 seed, Cardinal sophomore
Ryan Wolters, in the quarterfinals.
Stanford senior Grant. Elliott
also advanced to the quarterfinals,
where he lost a tough match to
Washington's Rampazzo Rampaz
zo took the first set 6-4, but Elliott
easily took the second 1-6. In the
third and deciding set, Elliott
couldn't hold the momentum and
lost 6-4.
The Card also entered four
teams in the doubles tournament.
The pairs of Wolters and Bryan
and Elliott and Abrams both
advanced to the semifinals, where
both were defeated by pairs from
California. Elliott and Abrams bat
tled Cal's team of Mahal and Jack
son but fell in the third set
In the quarterfinals. Cardinal
junior Misha Palecek and Hoeveler
couldn't convert a match point into
a victory over Mahal and Jackson
and lost 9-8 (9-7).
In this grueling four-day tour
nament at California over the
weekend, the Cardinal let the West
Coast know that Stanford will be
tough once again With all mem-
bers of the squad winning their
first match, and four members
alive in the quarterfinal round,
Stanford's showing in the tourna
ment indicates strong potential.
The rest of the West Coast
schools, however, also sent a mes
sage to Stanford — they won't let
the Card simply have its way with
out a battle.
"The team did a good job in gen
eral, but we can do more," Gould
said. "I am very encouraged about
the months ahead. All our guys
now realize that we better be ready
to play when we play [Cal and
Washingtonl."
