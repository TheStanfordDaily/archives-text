# Naylor exudes passion for field hockey, environment
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Cardinal goal is not all that Kelly
Naylor, the Stanford field hockey goalkeep
er, protects.
As a cabinet member of the ASSU and a
core member of Students for Environmen
tal Action at Stanford, the ambitious
junior has also been an active participant
in a variety of activities to protect human
rights and the environment.
While guiding the Cardinal field hockey
squad to a conference title, Naylor has
worked towards starting a minor at Stan
ford in public service and asserted corpo
rate responsibilities as a SEAS representa
tive; on and off the field, the 20-year-old is
looked upon as a down-to-earth, reliable
and devoted hard worker.
After a triple-overtime match against
the Bears last Sunday which crowned
Stanford as the Northern Pacific Athletic
Conference champions, Cardinal members
agreed the title would have been unattain
able without Naylor.
When the crucial match remained
scoreless after 30 overtime minutes, Nay
lor faced the task of taking on five of Cal's
top strokers; the iron keeper saved all shots
that came her way.
"Kelly was unbelievable," sophomore
forward Monique Leroux said. According
to Leroux, there is no other goalie in the
league quite like Naylor — she is just
unmatchable.
Born and brought up in Columbia, Md.,
Naylor's love of sports, as well as her keen
awareness of environmental and societal
issues, date back to her early childhood.
The superathlete's first introduction to
team sports occurred in sixth grade when
she started playing ice hockey for Howard
County. As the star defender of her team,
Naylor led the squad to victories all over
the East Coast until high school gradua
tion. Although she was the only girl on the
team, the natural athlete continued with
the sport, as well as with lacrosse and field
hockey, which she started during her
freshman year in high school.
"I grew up playing sports because I was
so hyperactive," Naylor said. "My parents
were eager to get me involved in activities."
Although Naylor's athletic capabilities
earned her spots on regionwide selective
teams, her "iron goalie" image as a field
hockey player did not set in until her first
year of high school.
"It was a fluke," Naylor said. "I had my
heart set on being a forward, scoring lots of
goals." At one of the team's early practices,
Naylor was "trying on pads just for fun and
got stuck." The coach informed her the
junior varsity team was badly in need of a
goalkeeper.
However, Naylor quickly picked up on

her new role on the field. The following
year, Naylor was invited to be the keeper
for the 16-and-under regional team of
Maryland, Delaware, Washington, D.C.,
and Virginia. By her senior year, Naylor
was playing in nationals and participating
in Olympic Festivals.
Naylor's athletic accomplishments were
always accompanied by her environmental
aspirations.
"She's more than just a field hockey
player," said freshman Chaddis Bruce, a
member of SEAS. "She knows so much. I
was really impressed by her breadth of
knowledge."
As a freshman in high school, Naylor
started a countywide group called Students
Against Violations of the Earth. Through
this group, Naylor achieved numerous
environmental-friendly changes such as
banning Styrofoam lunch trays from the
cafeteria.
"We collected all lunch trays from every
school in the county," Naylor said. "We
then went to the Board of Education and
put them in a pile in front of them. It was a
huge mess."
According to Naylor, her environmental
awareness solidified for life in the eighth
grade.
As a 14-year-old in junior high, Naylor
started a group called Youth Ending
Hunger (YEH) when she participated in
the Earth Day rally in Washington, D.C.,
and was struck by the immensity of issues
surrounding human rights and the envi
ronment.
As chair of YEH, the 5-foot-7 athlete
built on her leadership experiences as she
worked to achieve the group's goal to end
all hunger by the year 2000.
"It was a little too ambitious," Naylor
laughed. "But I grew up with ideals, and
it seemed natural to be working for a
more equitable society, understanding
the interconnectedness between people
and the environment and aiming at
[their] harmony."
Upon arriving at Stanford, she quickly
got involved in SEAS' activities.
"It was really exciting to find this
group of people who were thinking so
critically about society," Naylor said. "I
was challenged by people and exploring a
new dimension of environmental and
societal issues. It was definitely a matur
ing step as far as where my thinking was
going."
As usual, Naylor's hard work and devo
tion allowed those around her to look up to
her as their leader. By sophomore year,
Naylor was co-coordinating the SEAS
organization. This year, she is one of two
students on the Advisory Panel on Invest
ment Responsibility, a panel consisting of
faculty, alumni and University staff mem
bers.

The hyperactive junior's achievements
on and off the field are not completely sep
arable. According to Naylor, they are both
enormous parts of her life without which
she cannot live.
"For me, hockey is really a time to leave
behind the hecticness of my academic and
activist life," Naylor said. "The team has
always been a place to re-center myself; it is

a consistent something to always carry
inside me, forever."
What is in store for this multitalented
civil engineering major and economics
minor?
"I'd like to be working on internation
al environmental issues on a community
level," Naylor said. The ambitious
achiever hopes for a master's in environ

mental engineering; eventually, she
aspires to work with a nongovernmental
organization or for the United Nations to
"try to find creative solutions to prob
lems surrounding the environment and
society."
Although the triumphant season has
closed for the Cardinal field hockey team,
Naylor's iron goals will prevail.

scoreless after 30 overtime minutes, Nay
lor faced the task of taking on five of Cal's
top strokers; the iron keeper saved all shots
that came her way.
"Kelly was unbelievable," sophomore
forward Monique Leroux said. According
to Leroux, there is no other goalie in the
league quite like Naylor — she is just
unmatchable.
Born and brought up in Columbia, Md.,
Naylor's love of sports, as well as her keen
awareness of environmental and societal
issues, date back to her early childhood.
The superathlete's first introduction to
team sports occurred in sixth grade when
she started playing ice hockey for Howard
County. As the star defender of her team,
Naylor led the squad to victories all over
the East Coast until high school gradua
tion. Although she was the only girl on the
team, the natural athlete continued with
the sport, as well as with lacrosse and field
hockey, which she started during her
freshman year in high school.
"I grew up playing sports because I was
so hyperactive," Naylor said. "My parents
were eager to get me involved in activities."
Although Naylor's athletic capabilities
earned her spots on regionwide selective
teams, her "iron goalie" image as a field
hockey player did not set in until her first
year of high school.
"It was a fluke," Naylor said. "I had my
heart set on being a forward, scoring lots of
goals." At one of the team's early practices,
Naylor was "trying on pads just for fun and
got stuck." The coach informed her the
junior varsity team was badly in need of a
goalkeeper.
However, Naylor quickly picked up on

her new role on the field. The following
year, Naylor was invited to be the keeper
for the 16-and-under regional team of
Maryland, Delaware, Washington, D.C.,
and Virginia. By her senior year, Naylor
was playing in nationals and participating
in Olympic Festivals.
Naylor's athletic accomplishments were
always accompanied by her environmental
aspirations.
"She's more than just a field hockey
player," said freshman Chaddis Bruce, a
member of SEAS. "She knows so much. I
was really impressed by her breadth of
knowledge."
As a freshman in high school, Naylor
started a countywide group called Students
Against Violations of the Earth. Through
this group, Naylor achieved numerous
environmental-friendly changes such as
banning Styrofoam lunch trays from the
cafeteria.
"We collected all lunch trays from every
school in the county," Naylor said. "We
then went to the Board of Education and
put them in a pile in front of them. It was a
huge mess."
According to Naylor, her environmental
awareness solidified for life in the eighth
grade.
As a 14-year-old in junior high, Naylor
started a group called Youth Ending
Hunger (YEH) when she participated in
the Earth Day rally in Washington, D.C.,
and was struck by the immensity of issues
surrounding human rights and the envi
ronment.
As chair of YEH, the 5-foot-7 athlete
built on her leadership experiences as she
worked to achieve the group's goal to end
all hunger by the year 2000.
"It was a little too ambitious," Naylor
laughed. "But I grew up with ideals, and
it seemed natural to be working for a
more equitable society, understanding
the interconnectedness between people
and the environment and aiming at
[their] harmony."
Upon arriving at Stanford, she quickly
got involved in SEAS' activities.
"It was really exciting to find this
group of people who were thinking so
critically about society," Naylor said. "I
was challenged by people and exploring a
new dimension of environmental and
societal issues. It was definitely a matur
ing step as far as where my thinking was
going."
As usual, Naylor's hard work and devo
tion allowed those around her to look up to
her as their leader. By sophomore year,
Naylor was co-coordinating the SEAS
organization. This year, she is one of two
students on the Advisory Panel on Invest
ment Responsibility, a panel consisting of
faculty, alumni and University staff mem
bers.

The hyperactive junior's achievements
on and off the field are not completely sep
arable. According to Naylor, they are both
enormous parts of her life without which
she cannot live.
"For me, hockey is really a time to leave
behind the hecticness of my academic and
activist life," Naylor said. "The team has
always been a place to re-center myself; it is

a consistent something to always carry
inside me, forever."
What is in store for this multitalented
civil engineering major and economics
minor?
"I'd like to be working on internation
al environmental issues on a community
level," Naylor said. The ambitious
achiever hopes for a master's in environ

mental engineering; eventually, she
aspires to work with a nongovernmental
organization or for the United Nations to
"try to find creative solutions to prob
lems surrounding the environment and
society."
Although the triumphant season has
closed for the Cardinal field hockey team,
Naylor's iron goals will prevail.
