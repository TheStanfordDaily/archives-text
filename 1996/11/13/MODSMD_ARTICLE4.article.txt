Stephen Breyer will deliver the
Commencement address to Stan
ford's Class of 1997 on June 15.
"I'm very flattered that I would
be asked and very pleased at the in
vitation," Breyer said in a state
ment.
The decision to ask Breyer was
made by the senior class presidents
and University President Gerhard
Casper.
"He's a dynamic speaker," said
class president Jason Koepp-
Herthel, who heard Breyer speak
while attending the Stanford in
Washington program. "He has a lot
of very thoughtful things to say,
and his son, Michael, is in our class.
We're really looking forward tc
what he has to say."
Breyer said having his son in the
audience in June would not be
much different than usual.
"Michael gets my advice all the

time," Breyer
said.
Michael Breyer
said he was very
pleased with his
father's invitation
back to Stanford
and affirmed that
he did, indeed, re
ceive plenty of ad
vice from the elder

Stephen Breyer, who graduated
from Stanford with great distinc
tion in 1959 with a bachelor's de
gree in philosophy, began his ca
reer in government early.
During his undergraduate
tenure at Stanford, he was active in
Model United Nations, Delta
Sigma Rho — the national hon
orary speech and debate fraternity
— and the Foreign Scholars Com
mission. He also unsuccessfully
ran for student office on a platform
to put more bicycle racks on cam
pus.
After attending Oxford Univer

sity and winning the Marshall
Scholarship in 1961, he went on to
earn his law degree from Harvard
University in 1964.
Breyer has also served as a
lawyer for the Justice Department
and chief counsel to the Senate Ju
diciary Committee and clerked for
former Supreme Court Justice
Arthur Goldberg.
He was appointed to the
Supreme Court in 1994 by Presi
dent Clinton after serving as a fed
eral judge in New England for
nearly 14 years.
The four senior class presidents
initially compiled a list of about 10
people affiliated with Stanford
whom they wanted to hear speak at
Commencement. Last Tuesday,
they gave an unranked list to
Casper, who extended a formal in
vitation to Breyer later in the week.
"We feel as though we represent
the Senior Class," said class presi
dent Yu-Jim Kim. "We tried to get
