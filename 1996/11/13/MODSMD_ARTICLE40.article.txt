Fire alarm triggered
A fire alarm was set ofF and a glass window
broken Saturday at Clifford House — the for
mer Kappa Alpha house — according to Stan
ford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
The police responded to the false alarm
shortly after 1 a.m. and witnessed three sus
pects running from the area.
The officers also heard a loud, angry voice
swearing and the sound of breaking glass,
Niemeyer said.
Twenty-one-year-old Felipe Lloreda of
Palo Alto is suspected of breaking the win
dow, Niemeyer said, and is also one of the
three suspects who pulled the fire alarm.
Lloreda, who was intoxicated according to
Niemeyer, sustained cuts on his hands and
wrists. After paramedics were called and
Lloreda was treated, he was arrested and
charged with vandalism and for being drunk
in public.
Prowler spooks resident
A resident of the 600 block of Miranda
Drive notified police of a suspicious-looking
man on her property Friday.

The man, who was described as neatly
dressed and appearing to be a solicitor,
knocked on the front door of the house at
about 3 p.m. and would not immediately
leave after being asked to get off of the prop
erty, Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer
said.
The same night, at about 9:40 p.m., police
responded to a call by the resident, who
thought she heard noises in the yard. After
thoroughly searching the premises, police
found no evidence that the man had re
turned.
Niemeyer said the prowler "resembled a
guy who has been around the area for a num
ber of years who usually cons students into
giving him money."
He added that it is possible the prowler
was one of "hundreds of these guys who hang
around here, usually preying on students, for
money."
