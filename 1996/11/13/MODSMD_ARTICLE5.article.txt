# RAs discuss party policy
## Lack of communication stressed in residence staff's complaints about guidelines and alcohol policy 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Frustrated resident assistants have opened discus
sion with Stanford administrators in an attempt to
make their voices heard regarding the University's
party-planning guidelines and police enforcement of
the alcohol policy.
In a series of e-mails and conversations, RAs have
expressed concern over the guidelines, claiming that a
lack of communication between the Office of Student
Activities, Residential Education and the residence
staff has made it difficult to maintain a residential
community based on trust and understanding.

One of the RAs' main points of contention is a
guideline requiring RA.s to notify police at least 48
hours in advance of in-house events. Since the begin
ningof the conversations last week, this provision has
been temporarily suspended.
Nevertheless, RAs are still worried that the Office
of Student Activities and Residential Education might
not be attuned to students' perceptions of the rule of
police in the party environment
"It's hard for (the administration) to know what
students are worried about," said senior Blake
Naughton, an RAin Eucalipto. "Students are worried
that they don't feel like their dorm
is their home."
Junior David Ball, a Donner RA,
who, like Naughton, emphasized
that he speaks only for himself and
not for other RAs, said a lack of
trust has been expressed by his res
idents.
"I also believe that with the
changes brought about by the
party-planning guidelines, there
has been a great deal of miscom
munication between all parties in
volved," Ball said.
"This has led to mistrust,
doubts in the minds of many and a
fair amount of frustration. RAs

don't want to see the social benefits
of partying lost and drinking hap
pening behind closed doors," he
added.
According to Ball, some of the
freshmen in his dormitory have
"caught wind" of the minors in pos
session of alcohol charges that have
been handed out at recent parties,
but there has been no "significant"
decline in students' partying.
In an effort to increase the lines
of communication between the ad
ministration and the RAs, party
planning workshops have been
held about every 10 days in order to
educate students on the best way to
hold parties, said Nanci Howe, di
rector of the Office of Student Ac
tivities.
Howe added that the guidelines'
primary goal is to help ensure safe

ty at crowded campus-wide events
and that RAs' role in the party
planning process "should be one of
adviser, not planner."
Dean of Students Marc Wais
said a revision of the party-plan
ning guidelines is underway after
data on their effectiveness in en
suring campus safety was collect
ed. He said the Stanford Police will
be an integral part of these revi
sions.
Ball expressed hope that steps
will now be taken in response to the
RA concerns.
"The University has, I believe,
made significant and meaningful
steps to address student concerns,
which is refreshing," Ball said.
"Whether this change will result in
tangible differences in policy — a
lowered police presence, fewer

[minor in possession citations] —
remains to be seen."
In drafting the original guide
lines, Howe said, only one RA and
some resident fellows were in
volved.
However, according to Resi
dential Education Director Jane
Camarillo, Res Ed has asked
"the residential staff to support
the party-planning guidelines, a
document which is intended to
provide planning guidance in
having safe and well-managed
parties.
"We will continue to elicit feed
back from the residential staff of
resident fellows and resident assis
tants as we test the impact of using
these guidelines and compare that
with their intended use," Camaril
lo said.
