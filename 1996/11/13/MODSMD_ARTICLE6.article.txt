### Shoshana Deutschkron Staff writer 
Five members of the Sigma Chi fraternity
were cited Saturday morning by the Palo Alto
Police Department for stealing matf rials from
a construction site for use as party decora
tions.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, residents of Palo Alto observed the
five suspects loading sheets of plywood into a
tan van from the construction site on College
Avenue.
Sophomores Christopher Gruber, Jared

Whitson and Christopher
Keegan, junior Patrick Orosco
and senior William Page have
been charged with petty theft,
said Palo Alto Police Sgt. Scott
Wong.
The residents, who were
alerted by the noise of the ply
wood being loaded into the
van, called the Palo Alto Police
Department, which notified

Stanford Police, Wong said.
At 5:11 a.m., the tan van was stopped while
turning from Bowdoin Street onto Campus

Drive. The van later was positively identified
by a witness.
The lift gate was partially open and a num
ber of plywood sheets were easily visible. The
driver and all four passengers were taken into
custody and held by the Stanford Police until
Palo Alto Police arrived.
One of the suspects had a wire cutter, which
Niemeyer said is believed to have been used to
gain access to the construction site.
Other materials had been stolen from the
same construction site the day before, Niemev-


Niemeyer
er said.
Police got permission to search
the Sigma Chi house and found
additional plywood sheets on the
premises, he said. Both the sheets
in the house and those found in
the vehicle had serial numbers
tracing them back to the construc
tion site.
Niemeyer said the fraternity
was planning on using the ply
wood to create a set for a party it
was holding Saturday night.
The vehicle was impounded by
the Palo Alto Police, and the inci
dent is being reviewed by Dean of
Students Marc Wais.
According to University stan
dards and guidelines, the whole
fraternity could be held account
able for the actions of the five
members involved.
Wais said it is too early to com
ment on the incident and its im
plications.

Sigma Chi member Craig
Thomas, a senior and president of
the Interfraternity Council, also
declined to comment, citing con
cern for the individuals involved.
Sigma Chi President Christian
Nicks, a senior, could not be
reached for comment last night.
The Sigma Chi fraternity has
been under review already this
quarter by University officials
and is currently on social proba
tion.
During Orientation, the Sigma
Chis held a party in violation of the
University's party-planning guide
lines and received sanctions from
the Dean of Students Office. As
punishment, they are not allowed
to serve alcohol at any on-or off
campus events until Jan. 1.
Nicks has said he felt Wais'
sanctions were inappropriate for
the violation.
A campus-wide discussion con
cerning party-planning guidelines
and the role of police in enforcing
the University's alcohol policy
began soon after the sanctions
were announced.
