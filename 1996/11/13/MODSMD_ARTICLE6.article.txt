Five members of the Sigma Chi fraternity
were cited Saturday morning by the Palo Alto
Police Department for stealing matf rials from
a construction site for use as party decora
tions.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, residents of Palo Alto observed the
five suspects loading sheets of plywood into a
tan van from the construction site on College
Avenue.
Sophomores Christopher Gruber, Jared

Whitson and Christopher
Keegan, junior Patrick Orosco
and senior William Page have
been charged with petty theft,
said Palo Alto Police Sgt. Scott
Wong.
The residents, who were
alerted by the noise of the ply
wood being loaded into the
van, called the Palo Alto Police
Department, which notified

Stanford Police, Wong said.
At 5:11 a.m., the tan van was stopped while
turning from Bowdoin Street onto Campus

Drive. The van later was positively identified
by a witness.
The lift gate was partially open and a num
ber of plywood sheets were easily visible. The
driver and all four passengers were taken into
custody and held by the Stanford Police until
Palo Alto Police arrived.
One of the suspects had a wire cutter, which
Niemeyer said is believed to have been used to
gain access to the construction site.
Other materials had been stolen from the
same construction site the day before, Niemev-
