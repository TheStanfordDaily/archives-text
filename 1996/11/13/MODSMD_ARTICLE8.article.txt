# 15,000 tickets still left unsold for Big Game
## 
### Connie Chang Contributing writer 
With Big Game less than two weeks away, plenty
of tickets are still available for the 99th annual foot
ball contest.
The number of Big Game tickets sold has de
creased over the years, and about 15,000 seats are
still open in Memorial Stadium at UC-Berkeley, said
Jon Denney, associate athletir director for external
relations. Memorial Stadium can seat up to 74,909
fans.
According to Herb Benenson, associate director
of media relations at UC-Bt rkeley, Cal has sold
about 40,000 tickets out of an allotment of 47,000
In contrast, Stanford has sold a meager 18,000.
However, Denney explained that this weak show
ing may be due to the fact that the "host school al
ways sells more tickets than the visiting school."
Last year's Big Game at Stanford Stadium was
played in front of the smallest crowd since 1973
Within three weeks of the game last year, 13,000
tickets were still available.
The numbers are in sharp contrast to the games
played in 1993 and 1994, when
the teams played to near-sellout
crowds.
While concern over ticket
sales is justified, attention to se
curity is also something that
must be dealt with every year.
Big Game is known to spur
criminal acts. In 1993, a fraudu
lent credit card number was used
to scam the Stanford and UC-
Berkeley ticket offices out of
more than $5,000 worth of Big
Game tickets.

That same year, more than
200 tickets were fraudulently
photocopied but were intercepted
before they could be sold to un
suspecting buyers.
Stanford is gearing up for one
last game against Washington
State University at home this Sat
urday before heading off to UC-
Berkeley. Meanwhile, the Bears
are is scheduled to play the Uni
versity of Oregon this weekend.
Big Game this year could de
cide which team goes on to play a
12th game and which enjoys a
long winter break.
Big Game tickets can be
bought from the Stanford Ticket
Office for $50.
