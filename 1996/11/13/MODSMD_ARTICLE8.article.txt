With Big Game less than two weeks away, plenty
of tickets are still available for the 99th annual foot
ball contest.
The number of Big Game tickets sold has de
creased over the years, and about 15,000 seats are
still open in Memorial Stadium at UC-Berkeley, said
Jon Denney, associate athletir director for external
relations. Memorial Stadium can seat up to 74,909
fans.
According to Herb Benenson, associate director
of media relations at UC-Bt rkeley, Cal has sold
about 40,000 tickets out of an allotment of 47,000
In contrast, Stanford has sold a meager 18,000.
However, Denney explained that this weak show
ing may be due to the fact that the "host school al
ways sells more tickets than the visiting school."
Last year's Big Game at Stanford Stadium was
played in front of the smallest crowd since 1973
Within three weeks of the game last year, 13,000
tickets were still available.
The numbers are in sharp contrast to the games
