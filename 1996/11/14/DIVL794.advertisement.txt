When I was in about 10th grade, I went to "Swing Kids" the
night it opened. Now, I suspect I'm one of about six people in
the Western Hemisphere who saw this gem, so for the rest of
you, it has Robert Sean Leonard and it's about European
youth in the '30s who somehow defy Nazism through their live
ly dancing At the theater, this guy who looked about 40 was
sitting alone in front of my friend and me, and as we watched,
he kept squirming and shifting and getting up and coming back
and then removing a brush (a brush! not even a comb, but a
brush!) from his pocket and running it through his curly hair
(and he had cheesy curly hair, not endearing curly hair.) It was
all really weird, and it bothered me a lot. For some reason, I re
membered that earlier this week. Share your own worthless
memories by sending a classified to intermission ©daily. Oh,
and also: Jesse, we really, really, really miss you.
