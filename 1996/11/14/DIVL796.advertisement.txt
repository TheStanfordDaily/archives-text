Hang in there, Mother D. You're
our favorite martyr.
Where are thou, Thatcher? Secrets
are lies. Let's do "dinner and a
movie" again. — Joanna
Wisdom from heaven: You will
never cure your impotence if you
keep thinking there's nothing you
can do about it. — The Wise One
C — You're like no flower expert
I've ever met. Are you that good at
Scrabble, too?
Interested in freestyle/ BMX? Do
you dream of chrome and alu
minum? Do you get excited in math
class when they mention the angle
"360"? Well shit, give me a call and
we'll cruise around campus. Ask
for J-Mania. 7-h9l().
Dear Jo, First it was the toothbrush,
now St. Margaret's. Once a liar, al
ways a liar, lust joshing. Buck up,
cowgirl.
