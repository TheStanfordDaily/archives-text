### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
Fame, curiosity and the possi
bility of meeting Robin Williams
lured students to the Bookstore
yesterday, where extras were
being cast for the upcoming Dis
ney film "Flubber."
Extras will be used in a scene
to be shot outside of Maples
Pavilion tomorrow. Casting for
the scene continues today in
front of the Bookstore from 11
a.m. to 3 p.m.
The movie, which stars Robin
Williams and Edie McClurg, re
quires 300 to 500 students and
200 adults to portray students
and alumni in the movie. "Flub
ber" is a remake of the film "The
Absent-Minded Professor," star
ring Fred Mac Murray. The plot
involves a professor who invents
a super-powered, rubber-like
material called "flubber."
According to the Beau Bon
neau casting agency's fliers, the
agency is looking for "a Midwest
small-town college student
look." "Flubber" is set in a fic
tional Midwestern town called
Medfield.
Some people who signed up to
be extras yesterday said they are
looking for an inside peek into
the process of film production.
"I want to see what goes on
behind the scenes and what it
takes to film large scenes with
lots of people," said Mehul
Bastawala, a doctoral student in
computer science. "I have a lot of
work, and I'm not in it for the

money."
Others sought a brush with
fame.
"I've always wanted to be in a
movie. Actually, I've always
wanted to be in a soap opera, but
this is the closest thing," said
sophomore Jen Davis, a fan of
"General Hospital."
"It's something you can tell
your friends at home about,"
said freshman Willow Lung.
Many of the extras are fans of
Williams. "I'm not sure how
much we'll see of him," said se
nior Jorge Chen.
Representatives of the casting
agency said they are unsure if
Williams will be on the set.
The open call yesterday at
tracted both novice extras and
seasoned veterans.
Suzi Kosher, a social science
research assistant at the Hoover
Institute, has been an extra be
fore in the television show "Reg
gie Jackson: Greatest Sports
Legends." Chen was an extra in
the movie "Made in America"
during his freshman year.
Applicants generally were not
fazed by the last question on the
back of the form, which asked if
they were willing to work on
movies or commercials requiring
"underwear or lingerie scenes"
or nudity.
"Flubber" is a Disney film,
"so I don't think this will be nec
essary," said Samuel Sheng of
Beau Bonneau casting.

have been filmed at San Francisco
State and San Jose State Univer
sities. For these scenes, extras
from each school were used.
"We try to use students from
the campus on which we are film

ing," said Sabin.
Extras are required to work for
12 hours tomorrow and will be
paid $5 per hour.
The exterior of Maples Pavil
ion will be used to film a scene in
which students and alumni leave
a basketball game. Disney origi
nally wanted to use the inside of
Maples Pavilion as the main set
throughout their entire three

months of filming but was turned
down by the Department of Ath
letics .
"This was obviously not possi
ble to do with all of the athletic
events going on," Athletics De
partment representative Kris
Becker said.
With men's and women's bas
ketball games last night, tonight
and on Sunday, it was difficult for

the Athletics Department to find
time for the shoot.
"Trying to work around our
athletic events has been interest
ing," said Becker.
The Maples parking lot will be
closed all day tomorrow due to the
filming. According to Becker, cars
associated with the production
will be gone before the football
game on Saturday.
