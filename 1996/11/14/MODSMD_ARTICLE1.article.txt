### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
Fame, curiosity and the possi
bility of meeting Robin Williams
lured students to the Bookstore
yesterday, where extras were
being cast for the upcoming Dis
ney film "Flubber."
Extras will be used in a scene
to be shot outside of Maples
Pavilion tomorrow. Casting for
the scene continues today in
front of the Bookstore from 11
a.m. to 3 p.m.
The movie, which stars Robin
Williams and Edie McClurg, re
quires 300 to 500 students and
200 adults to portray students
and alumni in the movie. "Flub
ber" is a remake of the film "The
Absent-Minded Professor," star
ring Fred Mac Murray. The plot
involves a professor who invents
a super-powered, rubber-like
material called "flubber."
According to the Beau Bon
neau casting agency's fliers, the
agency is looking for "a Midwest
small-town college student
look." "Flubber" is set in a fic
tional Midwestern town called
Medfield.
Some people who signed up to
be extras yesterday said they are
looking for an inside peek into
the process of film production.
"I want to see what goes on
behind the scenes and what it
takes to film large scenes with
lots of people," said Mehul
Bastawala, a doctoral student in
computer science. "I have a lot of
work, and I'm not in it for the

money."
Others sought a brush with
fame.
"I've always wanted to be in a
movie. Actually, I've always
wanted to be in a soap opera, but
this is the closest thing," said
sophomore Jen Davis, a fan of
"General Hospital."
"It's something you can tell
your friends at home about,"
said freshman Willow Lung.
Many of the extras are fans of
Williams. "I'm not sure how
much we'll see of him," said se
nior Jorge Chen.
Representatives of the casting
agency said they are unsure if
Williams will be on the set.
The open call yesterday at
tracted both novice extras and
seasoned veterans.
Suzi Kosher, a social science
research assistant at the Hoover
Institute, has been an extra be
fore in the television show "Reg
gie Jackson: Greatest Sports
Legends." Chen was an extra in
the movie "Made in America"
during his freshman year.
Applicants generally were not
fazed by the last question on the
back of the form, which asked if
they were willing to work on
movies or commercials requiring
"underwear or lingerie scenes"
or nudity.
"Flubber" is a Disney film,
"so I don't think this will be nec
essary," said Samuel Sheng of
Beau Bonneau casting.
