### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United
States is willing to send about 1,000
troops to war-torn Zaire to participate in
"a limited fashion" with a Canadian-led
international operation trying to avert a
human catastrophe, the White House
said yesterday.
With thousands dying of starvation
and disease, press secretary Mike
McCurry said, "Our interests here are
largely humanitarian, to save lives."
While a final decision is pending,
President Clinton agreed "in principle"
U) a mission lasting at least four months
a)id involving fewer than 5,000 U.S.
troops — about 1,000 of which would be
deployed in Zaire, McCurry said. The
remainder would be based elsewhere in
tKe region in support roles.
>U.S. participation was approved on
condition that several standards were
fnfct, including cooperation from neigh
boring countries and assurances that

the operation was limited and clearly
defined in advance.
He said American soldiers would be
under U.S. command, although the
operation will be run by a Canadian offi
cer.
National Security Adviser Anthony
Lake met with a high-ranking Canadian
delegation Tuesday. McCurry said the
parties agreed on a series of conditions
for U.S. support, including:
• The mission would last about four
months. But then the United States
would examine whether more time or
troops were needed to keep the situation
from exploding again.
• The international force will have
"very robust rules of engagement."
• The U.S. mission will not include
disarming militants or forcing entry in
Zaire.
• The cost of the mission would be
borne by participating states.

U.S. troops will provide security at the
Goma airport and along a three-milt
corridor from the airport. Perry said tht
force would be anchored by infantr)
troops, who would also have assaull
helicopters assigned to the units.
Troops outside Zaire could be used ir
supporting roles, including ferrying sup
plies, officials said.
While the military participated in th(
last international Rwandan relie
effort, U.S. officials want to avoid a rep
etition of the Somalia intervention ir
