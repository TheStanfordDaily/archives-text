Cancer death rate declines
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — The U.S. cancer death
rate is declining for the first time this century, an improve
ment that a new study attributed to better medicine and
anti-smoking campaigns.
While the reduction is only slight — 0.6 percent per year
for five years after the death rate peaked in 1990 —
researchers said it is nonetheless important because the
trend appears to be sustainable.
The decline is documented in an article by two Univer
sity of Alabama at Birmingham researchers in the current
issue of Cancer, the journal of the American Cancer Soci
ety.
Epidemiologist Phil Cole and oral pathologist Brad
Rodu analyzed years of federal cancer statistics to deter
mine that the U.S. cancer death rate peaked in 1990,
when 135 people out of every 100,000 died of the dis
ease.
The death rate declined slightly in 1991 and has contin
ued falling every year since. The 1995 cancer death rate
was 129.8 deaths per 100,000 people, about five fewer
deaths per 100,000 people than in 1990.
The decrease was due in large part to a reduction in

deaths from lung cancer, which dropped by 3.9 percent
from 1990 to 1995. Other smoking-related cancers
declined by about 2 percent.
Yeltsin's popularity falls
MOSCOW (AP) — The number of Russians who trust
President Boris Yeltsin has fallen sharply in recent months
while he's undergone treatment for heart problems,
according to a poll published yesterday.
In June, 29 percent of Russians polled said Yeltsin was
the politician they trusted most — now that number is
down to 10 percent.
Yeltsin trails one rival, former Gen. Alexander Lebed,
and is about even with another, Communist leader Gen
nady Zyuganov.
Lebed, who was Yeltsin's security chief before he was
fired a month ago, came out on top with 24 percent of those
polled supporting him — down slightly from 29 percent in
June, when he was tied with Yeltsin.
Zyuganov, who lost to Yeltsin in the presidential run-off
election in July, polled at 14 percent, down from 21 percent
in June to a statistical tie with Yeltsin given the margin of
error.
