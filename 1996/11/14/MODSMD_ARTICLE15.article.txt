Senators must thoroughly
research their important
burden of proof decision

AFTER a YEAR of hard
work, the Committee of 15
has put its proposal on the
table. Last week Committee Chair
Mark Zoback presented draft pro
posals to both the ASSU and Fac
ulty senates and promised to be
back by spring quarter with a
revised judicial charter.
The proposed reforms are very
promising. The overriding mes
sage is more student involvement,
almost to the point of student con
trol of Stanford's judicial system.
In the proposals, student majori
ties are required at every level,
and the administration's role is
diminished. Students will chair
panels to determine guilt, and
those panels will require near
unanimity.
Zoback and the committee used
education as the key reform tool.
Clearly, our community's judicial
system should be an educational
experience for all those involved,
not only a punitive process. The
committee's reforms have great
promise to bring this educational
goal to fruition.
However, these reforms are
missing one critical issue that has
plagued the committee since it was
formed last year: burden of proof.
Zoback has devised a clever
mechanism to deal with the issue
that could kill these much needed
reforms. He has left it to the
ASSU Senate to propose the level
of proof needed to "convict" stu
dents of Fundamental Standard
and Honor Code transgressions.
He has asked the senate to return
a resolution to him by the end of
this year.
An amazing opportunity con
fronts our senators, and its impact
will likely be felt for decades ... or
until a new committee is constitut
ed. This issue is so far-reaching

that it might be wise to call a spe
cial election, to strike up a conver
sation across campus and to have
our student community decide
this issue.
Given the timeline that the sen
ate has to work on, it may not be
plausible to engage the student
body in a conversation on such a
complex issue and expect a vote by
December.
Therefore, the senate must
address and heed the following in
its role as student representatives:
Senators must go into the com
munity and gather opinion on the
burden of proof issue. This does
not mean isolated meetings with
specific constituencies, rather sev
eral meetings between now and
December with dorms and student
leadership groups. This also does
not mean one or two senators par
ticipating; this task requires the
participation of all senators, grad
uate and undergraduate alike.
Of course, all of this may be for
naught since ASSU President Bill
Shen is a passionate advocate for a
high burden and can veto any deci
sion of the senate that doesn't
please him. Shen pledged his
undying opposition to lowering the
burden of proof at the beginning of
the quarter. And though he has yet
to publicly commit himself to veto
ing any decrease in the burden of
proof, the odds are that he will.
This decision requires more
attention than serious issues typi
cally receive in the senate. Sena
tors must gauge the opinion of
University President Gerhard
Casper and the Faculty Senate, as
well as students. If Casper or the
faculty don't like the ASSU's deci
sion, then all of committee's rec
ommendations could go down the
drain.
Caution is warranted. This is a
major decision whose repercus
sions could derail an entire year's
worth of work and may rob the
students of needed change in the
judicial process.
This issue needs real leadership,
and this is an opportunity for the
senate to step up.
