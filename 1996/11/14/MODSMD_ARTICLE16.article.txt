Wealth, not race, should be affirmative action criteria

WHEN I ENTERED the polling
booth on Election Day, I startled
myself by voting "yes" on Propo
sition 209. On many issues, my beliefs
border on "knee-jerk liberal." I have
always considered myself a Democrat and
have long been concerned about inequali
ty in America. I voted for Prop. 209
because I believe class-based affirmative
action is far more effective than race
based affirmative action at leveling the
socioeconomic playing field. After Prop.
209 passed, University of California

administrators immediately stated that
they would implement class-based affir
mative action which takes into account
factors such as parental income. This is
the right way to go.
Racism is obviously alive in America
today. However, the major problem of the
underclass is not our legacy of slavery.
Many African Americans today grow up in
nurturing, middle-class families and
attend high quality suburban schools. I
would rather give preferential treatment
to bullet-dodging students from poor com

munities with poor school systems regard
less of race than to the children of African-
American doctors and lawyers. America's
underclass today includes people of diverse
ethnic backgrounds (including Anglo
Americans).
Inequality of opportunity in America is
based largely on unequal financial
resources and unequal educational oppor
tunities stemming from our funding of
school systems out of local taxes and the
fact that quality teachers must be paid a
premium to teach in low-class communi

ties. Poor schools create few local job
opportunities which leads to a sense of
helplessness and self-perpetuating urban
blight. America should aspire to equalize
educational quality across the nation. Fail
ing such a national commitment, it would
be wise for universities to give preference
to high-achieving students at low-quality
schools so that the most talented and
hard-working students in every region of
our nation can continue their educations.
