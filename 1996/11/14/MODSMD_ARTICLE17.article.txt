# Stanford reunion eases trip home for alumnus now living in Singapore
## 
### 
I am a graduate of the Class of 1976
who moved to Singapore from my native
California about 12 years ago and estab
lished permanent residence in Singa
pore. After years of living out here and
marrying into a traditional Chinese fam
ily, I gradually developed a reverse kind
of homesickness whenever I traveled
back to the United States for business or
vacation. In Singapore, the food is bet
ter, the streets are safer and cleaner, the
family values are stronger, and the busi
ness climate is more exciting. Despite
occasional criticisms from outsiders, one
can adjust very well to life here. The
only highlights of our sojourns to the
United States pretty much came down
to shopping at Costco or Target (which

we don't have in Singapore) or watching
a few R-rated movies (which are pretty
much censored).
Last month, my wife and I attended
my 20th reunion. From the parties,
classes and programs up to the come
from-behind victory over Oregon in the
football game, we became caught up in
The Fever. I was reminded of what a
great institution Stanford is: the diversi
ty and excellence of the students, alumni
and faculty, the outstanding resources
and facilities for learning, the beauty of
the campus, the zaniness of the Band
and how fortunate I was to have this
experience. Returning back to Singapore
from this high, I was afraid this feeling
would slowly dissipate; however, the two
victories over UCLA and USC the past
two weeks sustained it. What a great
month! To everybody back on the Farm
who put on the reunions, to the profes
sors who remembered me after 20 years,
to the football team which never gave
up, thanks for reawakening The Fever.

And thanks to The Daily Online which
beams it all out to the Stanford alumni
in Singapore.
