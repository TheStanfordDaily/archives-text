# Preachy author of the anti-Bloomingdale's letter should just relax
## 
### 
I found the little letter on "Bloomie's"
quite annoying, a typical non-real life view
about things. Why do I say this? When
you work 80 hours per week either saving
the whales or feeding the poor or starting
out a new software company, you want to
relax at some point. If you want to do it
by buying clothes you can afford, let be it.
You deserve it and have the right to give
yourself a break. Yes, we know, Ms. Diggs,
this is not going to redeem us from "our
past social sins" (whatever this might

mean) or make us "morally better per
sons."
Does Diggs expect all the news to be
about fundamental political and social
issues? I happen to read these kind of
news but also like to browse other arti
cles, whether it be fashion or the Sunday
comics. Life does not revolve around
Cultures, Ideas and Values section
moral dilemmas, Diggs.
In the context of her comments, I can
imagine Diggs in front of Bloomie's
yelling at some senior consultants or the
governor's wife that buying clothes does
not give "self-worth." Do I have to illus
trate to you how they will react? Never
theless, I am sure you will feel better
about yourself (you go and make that
moral stand, girl!).
To conclude, let me make an impor
tant point: DKNY is not Euro-trash imi
tation!!! ... ha!
