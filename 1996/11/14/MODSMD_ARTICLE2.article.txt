# Statesmen debate nuclear deterrence

### Elise Lipkowitz 
Many of the world's eminent former states
men debated the future of nuclear deterrence as
a major principle of international policy in a
panel discussion at Kresge Auditorium yester
day.
Sponsored by the Institute for International
Studies, the event was moderated by former Sec
retary of State and Hoover Institution Distin
guished Fellow George Shultz.
The panelists included James Goodby, former
principal navigator for nuclear security and dis
mantlement under President Clinton; R.J.L.
Hawke, former prime minister of Australia;
Lord Geoffrey Howe, former secretary of state
for foreign affairs in Great Britain; Helmut

Schmidt, former chancellor of Germany;
Alexander Bessmertnykh, former foreign minis
ter of the Soviet Union; and Rozanne Ridgway,
former U.S. assistant secretary of state.
Organizers of the panel hoped to evaluate the
state of nuclear arsenals and notions about nu
clear deterrence 10 years after the landmark
Reykjavik meeting between Ronald Reagan and
Mikhail Gorbachev on the topic of disarmament.
Goodby said progress has been made toward
Shultz's 1986 vision of "a safer, strategic envi
ronment involving progressively less reliance on
nuclear weapons."
While Goodby emphasized the importance of
the three U.S.-Soviet treaties that have been cre
ated in the past decade, he said nuclear weapons
remain an unresolved problem. "The U.S. and

Russia have most of them," he said, "with about
15,000 to 20,000 per side."
Although all the parties agreed that the two
countries would not use the weapons on each
other, Goodby warned of the danger of weapons
falling into the hands of terrorist groups like the
Aum Shinrikyo religious cult in Japan or into the
control of "rogue states" such as Iraq, Iran or
North Korea.
Bessmertnykh emphasized that "there has
been a dramatic change of heart in both the the
ory and practice of deterrence.... The Soviet
Union was always against the concept of deter
rence ... [and] now Russia has accepted the
idea."
Ridgway observed that the rea
sons for the slow progress of the
area of disarmament include an un
derestimate of the size of the arse
nals and a concern about making
vast reductions while other coun
tries still possess weapons.
"As long as there is a Russian
nuclear force, no one will be propos
ing a philanthropic journey to
zero," Ridgway said.
While arguing that nuclear
weapons have a future, she indicat
ed that it is "limited, narrow and
transient."
Howe said another reason why
movement has been slow in this
area, especially in recent years, is
because public interest in nuclear
deterrence has substantially de
clined since the end of the Cold
War. As opposed to 10 to 15 years
ago when the issue of missile de
ployment had people in Great
Britain up in arms, Howe said,
today these issues have been "enor
mously muted."
Goodby seconded this idea, cit

ing the lack of discussion of this
issue in the recent presidential
campaign as indicative of the lack of
"political impulse in the U.S. for
this issue."
Howe concurred with many of
the other panelists, warning that a

cautious approach to nuclear disar
mament must be taken.
"The Boston Tea Party was a
fearful accident," he said. "If that is
what happens with tea, imagine
what might happen with nuclear
weapons."

Schmidt countered the cautious
response, encouraging a more rapid
movement toward nuclear disar
mament. He argued that the con
cept of nuclear deterrence is null as
no responsible state would use nu
clear weapons.
