Many of the world's eminent former states
men debated the future of nuclear deterrence as
a major principle of international policy in a
panel discussion at Kresge Auditorium yester
day.
Sponsored by the Institute for International
Studies, the event was moderated by former Sec
retary of State and Hoover Institution Distin
guished Fellow George Shultz.
The panelists included James Goodby, former
principal navigator for nuclear security and dis
mantlement under President Clinton; R.J.L.
Hawke, former prime minister of Australia;
Lord Geoffrey Howe, former secretary of state
for foreign affairs in Great Britain; Helmut

Schmidt, former chancellor of Germany;
Alexander Bessmertnykh, former foreign minis
ter of the Soviet Union; and Rozanne Ridgway,
former U.S. assistant secretary of state.
Organizers of the panel hoped to evaluate the
state of nuclear arsenals and notions about nu
clear deterrence 10 years after the landmark
Reykjavik meeting between Ronald Reagan and
Mikhail Gorbachev on the topic of disarmament.
Goodby said progress has been made toward
Shultz's 1986 vision of "a safer, strategic envi
ronment involving progressively less reliance on
nuclear weapons."
While Goodby emphasized the importance of
the three U.S.-Soviet treaties that have been cre
ated in the past decade, he said nuclear weapons
remain an unresolved problem. "The U.S. and

Russia have most of them," he said, "with about
15,000 to 20,000 per side."
Although all the parties agreed that the two
countries would not use the weapons on each
other, Goodby warned of the danger of weapons
falling into the hands of terrorist groups like the
Aum Shinrikyo religious cult in Japan or into the
control of "rogue states" such as Iraq, Iran or
North Korea.
Bessmertnykh emphasized that "there has
been a dramatic change of heart in both the the
ory and practice of deterrence.... The Soviet
Union was always against the concept of deter
rence ... [and] now Russia has accepted the
idea."
