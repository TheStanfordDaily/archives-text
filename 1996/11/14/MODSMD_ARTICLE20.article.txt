## Reaching beyond definitions 
### 
PEOPLE ARE TOO quick to judge.
The oreos and bananas and pota
toes all know what I mean. Femi
nists, "those hippies," athletes, fraternity
brothers and freshmen all know what I
mean, as well. I am talking about the peo
ple who look at you, listen to the way you
talk and act, or who you hang out with
and suddenly have you all figured out.
They're convinced that they've seen you
before. They're convinced that they're two
steps beyond you. You smile at them once,
and they give a fake grin right before they
give you the finger. Or they subject you to
their demeaning-disguised-as-helpful
analysis of your personality. It's great.
Once, on a three-day cross-country
train ride, I met a gentleman who wanted
to play (my) guitar while I sang, to while
away the boring ride. I was bored, too, so I
agreed. When his fingers grew tired, he
stopped playing. He was so pleased with
my harmonization that he decided to treat
me to lunch in the dining car. Little did I
know that dinner was a preamble to a liv
ing hell.
"So," he says to me, "what do you
study at Stanford?"
"Political science," I said, "with a con
centration in public policy."
"Whatcha gonna do with that?"
"Well," I said, "I'm thinking of work
ing in a lobbying organization for
women's rights."
Just then, a guy from another part of
the car decided to join in.
"Women's rights? My mom is into

that," he snarled. "I think that you femi
nists are all for shit."
"I didn't say anything about femi
nism," I said.
"Yeah," he said, "she's into all that
women's lib stuff. Why would women
want to be firemen? Why should we lower
our standards just to let you in?"
"I don't know," I said, "but, really,
that's not the area I'd want to work in.
I'm really interested in .. ."
"No, just hear me out! You know, I
wasn't alive during the '60s or anything
so I don't really know, but I think that the
only reason that she's into the whole
women's lib thing now is that she just
wants something to do. I mean, those
problems don't exist now."
I had to bite.
"How would you know? What kind of
venue would you have to experience sex
ism against women?"
"And I don't want to know!" he yelled.
Then he paid his bill and left.
"I wasn't talking about feminism," I
said, "so why was he harping on me?"
"Are you a feminist?" said Guitar Man.
"Yes, I am," I said, "but that wasn't
what I was talking about. I am interested
in sexuality issues. Educating young
women about what they should look out
for. How to protect themselves."
"Are you talking about rape?" he
asked.
"Not really," I said, "though I do work
at a rape crisis hot line."
"Oh," he said, "have you been raped?"

"No," I said.
"It's just that women who are interest
ed in that have usually been raped."
"I am interested because it is an impor
tant issue."
"Are you sure that you haven't been
raped? You are pretty, and a lot of women
who I know that are interested in rape are
rape victims."
I was ready to strike him. Apparently,
Mr. Guitar Player had gathered some
very interesting information about my
psyche, though I had said precious little
to him. I was a complex person who didn't
want to admit that I'd been raped. I
would "get past this liberal stuff" when 1
got older. I really did want a boyfriend. He
"knew" all about me. Never mind that he
couldn't pronounce my name.
No one was listening to me. Say no
more! Say no more! Nod, nod, wink, wink.
I, and many others, are often relegated to
the tiny little definitions that other people
create for us to fit into. Yeah, we all have
some stuff in common. I'm black, like Whit
ney Houston; I'm short, like Michael
Dukakis; I go to Stanford, like Fred Savage.
But that doesn't mean that I'm remotely
like any of those people. All I'm saying is
this: Before you judge, learn a little bit.
Makes you seem like less of an ign'nt fool.

Nkomo is looking for a bass player and a
drummer.
