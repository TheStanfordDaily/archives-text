# Brian Singer: First impressions
## Fearlessness and optimism: rarities in Russia 
### 
VALERI NEVER SPENT a day in
Stalin's concentration camps. In
fact, he probably barely remem
bers Stalin. Wearing glasses and with
curly hair longer in the back than in the
front, Valeri seemed to be an average
Russian 45-year-old.
Like many of the people whom I've
met since I arrived here, Valeri knew
immediately that I was a foreigner. Per
haps it was my blue American passport I
was holding in my right hand. And I
knew immediately that he was drunk.
Perhaps it was the beer he was holding
in his left hand.
Valeri rarely looked up while he was
explaining (or augmenting) his past. His
wife was Estonian, while he was Rus
sian. Somewhere in Estonia he had a 16-
year-old daughter. While he was travel
ing by train from Estonia to Moscow, he
had not seen his wife when in Estonia.
He used to be a rabochie (which literally
translates as worker but really means a
factory worker), but now he is unem
ployed.
Valeri had no complaints, however.
He said he was afraid of the United
States because it was a great country. I
assured him that Russia, a larger coun

try than the United States, had nothing
to be afraid of. He opened another beer.
"If all Russians were like me," he
said, referring to his drunken state,
"there would still be communism in
Russia for another 10 years."
I laughed and refrained from making
a comment about Boris Yeltsin. But
should I have even laughed? It was an
interesting point. Did Russians realize
their circumstances before Gorbachev
launched his reforms? Was glasnost a
sobering of sorts?
"But I had no power for building com
munism," he added.
Valeri was right, I thought. Even he
realized that communism in Russia
would have continued had Russians not
awakened or been awakened. Propagan
da was the vodka that Russians were
forced to drink. Do the tribulations of
the fledgling years of the post-commu
nist era represent one large hangover?
As I was advancing this analogy in my
mind ad nauseam, Valeri started flirting
with three women in the compartment,
so I distracted him with some question
about Russian sports.
It didn't take me long to realize that
in his drunken state, Valeri was happy.

For that train ride, or at least until he
woke up the next morning, he had no
problems. However, I wasn't happy for
him. Neither were the three women in
my compartment. And although he was
happy, he was also afraid, not only of the
United States, but of government and
bureaucracy in general.. .
While I may remember Valeri as only
another drunk Russian, I will always
remember Borislav as Borislav. An octo
genarian from Poland, he now takes
tourists to the top of St. Peter's Church
in the Latvian capital of Riga.
I had never met anyone whom Stalin
sent to Siberia before. Borislav worked
there for seven years. Had he not told
me, I wouldn't have known. What he
had lived through I will never be able to
imagine. But now, he was living. He was
living the life he wanted to live, the
childhood he had missed. And not just
because communism had fallen. No
doubt from the moment Stalin died,
Borislav lived his own life. He had perse
vered, refused to acquiesce. Now he was
happy.
When Borislav realized I was an
American, he was overjoyed. "We love
Americans here," he said, a comment

which I have yet to hear in Russia. Then
he began his act.
With a strong thumbs up, Borislav
did the best Bill Clinton impersonation I
have seen by a foreigner. Borislav didn't
speak much English, but he didn't have
to. Borislav had seen President Clinton
when he visited Latvia.
"Much better than Brezhnev," he
continued and summarily tightened his
lips and mumbled some deep words that
probably weren't in Russian, English,
Polish or Latvian.
Then he took off his shoe, banged it
against the wall of the elevator and said,
"Khrushchev, you see?" He couldn't
hold back a small smile.
Next it was Chernenko, one of two
Soviet leaders who ruled basically from a
hospital bed. He wavered back and
forth, holding on to the walls in the ele
vator. He looked sick, just like Cher
nenko.
Next it was Yeltsin, whom Borislav
depicted as drunk without a heartbeat.
Sure I had seen all these impersonations
before, but not to this extent in the for
mer Soviet Union. No one had the guts.
Unlike Valeri, Borislav was not afraid
of anything. He knows he has already

seen the worst of his days, and unlike
many Soviet citizens who remember
back to the 19605, he believes that the
best times of his life are yet to come.
Not only is Borislav happy, I am
happy for him. As are all the people he
meets. He is not afraid to persevere; he
is not afraid to fight; he believes that he
can make a difference.
Valeri knows he can't make a differ
ence. His best days were probably 16
years ago. He's afraid to stand up and be
counted, afraid to persevere, afraid to
fight some unknown force which existed
during the Soviet Union and exists
today.
Unfortunately, the majority of the
people I've met here are Valeris. Not
because they are drunk, but because
they are afraid, resigned. On the bright
side, knowing so many Valeris makes
meeting a Borislav even more special.
Something I will never forget.
