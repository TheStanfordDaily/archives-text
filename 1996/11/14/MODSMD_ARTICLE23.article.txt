## No. 1 women's hoops sets its sights on national title 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
This is the year, and everyone is say
ing it.
The preseason No. 1 team in the
nation for college women's basketball
is Stanford, and all hopes are for a
NCAA championship. If any team will
have to deal with the pressure of high
expectations, it's this year's basketball
squad.
After back-to-back appearances in the
Final Four, the Cardinal is ready to take
the next step and be crowned national
champions for the third time in Stan
ford's history. Everyone is looking ahead
to March; everyone that is, except the
players and coaches.
"Our focus is on improving," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer who is in
her 11th year at the helm. "I'm more
interested in day by day improvement
and having fun. I asked our team who
was last year's preseason No. 1, and [no
one remembered]. Then I asked who was
the national champion and everybody
knew."
The team may not want to focus on
the rankings for now, but the return of
10 players from last season's 29-3 (18-0
Pacific 10 Conference) team, including
97 percent of the team's scoring and 96
percent of its rebounding, leaves the
impression that it may be now or never
for this squad.
"That's a goal every year," junior for
ward Olympia Scott said of winning the
national title. "We do feel like it's a little
more real and that we're more prepared
this year. It does feel like the time is
now."
All the pieces fit this season. For the
returners, the 1996-97 campaign marks
their third season playing together. The
experience this group has amassed over
the past seasons is perhaps the team's

biggest asset. If they're not familiar with
one another by now, they probably never
will be.
Add to that the return of VanDerveer.
After a year hiatus during which she
coached the U.S. National Team to a per
fect record and a gold medal in the
Olympics in Atlanta, VanDerveer brings
new insights from her experiences back
to the Farm and appears ready to guide
the team to the top.
"It's weird; it feels a little strange,"
VanDerveer said of returning to her posi
tion. "Working with our team is what's
rewarding for me. I really enjoy our play
ers, and I like going to the gym. That's
important to me because of what I come
from last year. This is the college ver
sion, in my mind, of the gold-medal
team."
Experience and depth define this
team, and the addition of four new fresh
men only adds to the potent lineup.
Senior Kate Starbird, a first-team Kodak
Ail-American last season and a candidate
for the Naismith Player of the Year this
year, is the team's leading scorer. Star
bird scored a school-record 643 points
last year including a school-record 44
against USC.
Starbird is an excellent open-court
player whose moves make her a key to
Stanford's transition game and up
tempo offense. But she gets plenty of
help from Stanford's inside game, and
VanDerveer feels that the team's diversi
ty is a huge key to its success.
"I'm inspired by this team," Van-
Derveer said. "We don't have one star.
We have an orchestra, and there are
going to be different nights when differ
ent people play their solos."
In the paint, Scott is joined by fellow
juniors Heather Owen, Vanessa
Nygaard and Naomi Mulitauaopele.
Last season this quartet combined for
42.4 points and 21 rebounds per game,

giving the Card one of the most domi
nant post games in the country. In addi
tion, 6-foot-7 redshirt sophomore Chan
dra Benton's continued improvement is
expected to bring another dimension to
this group, creating Stanford's very
own fab five.
"We've got to be a strong inside
team," VanDerveer said. "Chandra,
Olympia, Naomi and Heather are the
foundation of our success. Then we have
Kate Starbird who is a human highlight
film and a smart playmaker like Jamila
Wideman. Everyone is going to have to
carry the team."
On the other side of the ball the Car
dinal is led by its quick guards. Seniors
Wideman and Charmin Smith set the
pace on defense. Wideman raked in 83
steals (fourth-best in school histoiy) in
just 30 games last season, while Smith
more than doubled her playing time last
season with her defensive prowess.
Smith's defensive improvement resulted
in the responsibility of guarding much
bigger players. Scott leads the team in
blocked shots as she garnered 25 last sea
son, and Starbird added 23 while pulling
in an average of 2.1 steals per game.
"I think it's going to be a really excit
ing year," Starbird said. "We're looking
at the national championship as our
main goal. [The freshmen] are adjusting;
they'll definitely see some time."
Last season's lack of depth at the
guard position will be remedied by the
addition of the freshmen. Last season
Wideman saw more playing time than
the referees, but this season she'll have
plenty of backup when she needs it.
In addition to senior Tara Harrington
and junior Regan Freuen as reserves, the
Cardinal has four top freshmen in
Christina Batastini, Milena Flores,
Melody Peterson and Yvonne Gbalazeh.
