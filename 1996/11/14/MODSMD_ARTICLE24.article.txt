# Set sail!
## Sailing cruises into regatta 
### David McGee Contributing writer 
The Stanford sailing team will look to con
tinue its West Coast domination this week
end at Santa Barbara's Lake Cachuma when
it competes in the North / South Fall Cham
pionships, hosted by UC-Santa Barbara.
The regatta will consist of two divisions of
dinghy sailing (double-handed boats) and two
divisions of laser sailing (single-handed
boats). Although the Cardinal would like to
win every division, the team has its sights set
on a more specific target.
"The goal to win all four divisions is not
reachable," said head coach Steve Bourdow.
"Winning the dinghy divisions is our main
concentration."
Most collegiate sailing programs practice
double-handed sailing more often than sin
gle-handled sailing. Therefore, dinghy racing
is used as the litmus test of a program's ulti
mate talent and depth.
"We should win — and by a comfortable
margin," said coach Steve Bourdow.
The Stanford squad is coming off a very
successful Freshman / Sophomore and
Women's Fall Championships, where the
team finished with three sailors in the top
four places of the freshman / sophomore divi
sion and two sailors in the top three places in
the women's division.

Freshman Anika Leersson won the
women's division while Sophomore Tyler
Doyle took the freshman / sophomore divi
sion. Both will compete this weekend.
"I think we have a real good chance to do
well," Doyle said.
Juniors Danny Zimbaldi and John Meade
are returning from the College of Charleston,
where they placed seventh and eighth, respec
tively, in the national single-handed champi
onships. They will both be competing this
weekend in double-handed boats, vessels they
are more comfortable sailing in.
"I am a lot better in the dinghies," Meade
said. "I will be in my own boat, and I am
familiar with [Lake Cachuma], so my goal is
to win my division. It is a very attainable
goal."
Meade expects his greatest competition
will be from California's All-American senior
Dave Houser. Meade has already defeated
Houser this year at the Stoney Burke Inter
sectional on the weekend of Oct. 12-13, and
hopes to repeat the performance.
"We have the best team," Meade said.
Other teams expected to challenge Stan
ford include Hawaii and USC. Both have a
handful of talented sailors, but neither pos
sesses the depth that can match up with
third-ranked Stanford.
"I would be surprised and a little upset if
we didn't win," Bourdow said.
