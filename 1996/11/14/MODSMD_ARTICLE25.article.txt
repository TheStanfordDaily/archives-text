# Hockey hopes Ducks aren't mighty
## 
### Ben Freda 
The members of Stanford men's ice
hockey team, ecstatic after a weekend
sweep of USC that legitimized its
claim as an undefeated league power,
deserve to strut.
But strutting will have to wait.
Tomorrow's 7:15 p.m. game against
the Oregon Ducks at Ice Oasis in Red
wood City, potentially represents the
Cardinal's toughest game yet.
Despite the formidable Ducks, con
fidence still rules the Cardinal. Rea
sons for it aren't hard to find. In the
weekend's two matchups against
USC, the Card prevailed twice in
grand fashion. On Friday, the team
pulled out the game in overtime 3-2
despite the ineffectiveness of the first
line. On Saturday night, they were
able to roll easily to a 6-3 victory.
Add this confidence-boosting week
end to an already undefeated league
schedule and you get a squad that's 5-

0-2 in the Pacific 8 Conference (5-2-2
overall) and looking toward the
national championships.
"It's exciting," said team captain
Tom Terbell. "Going to nationals def
initely looks possible now."
"We'll take it to nationals," agreed
Ben D'Ewart, a freshman who scored
the pivotal goal in overtime Friday to
beat USC.
But before the Card can look too
far into the horizon, Oregon demands
attention in the foreground.
The Ducks (7-1-1, 5-1-1 Pac-8) are
also riding the wave of momentum,
coming off an eight-game unbeaten
streak and a thrilling overtime victory
over nonleague opponent Western
Washington.
"Traditionally, they haven't been
very strong," Terbell said of Oregon.
"They've had strong players, but then
they've fallen off after the first line."
Terbell also commented that Stan
ford's biggest problem in the past has

been a lack of depth. But this year,
with a strong class of entering fresh
man, the lines have gotten deeper.
"At the last practice, we showed
three strong lines, something we
never had before," Terbell said.
The team's depth has been further
augmented by the addition of two new
players, senior Conrad Ray and junior
Eri Crum, who serve to put the finish
ing touches on the first three lines.
Now that it has cleared the depth
hurdle, Stanford must find that elu
sive team unity.
"For most teams, it's tough to put
it all together with so many new play
ers. The chemistry isn't there yet,"
Terbell said. "But it's exciting. Some
things should work out really well."
D'Ewart credits Terbell for being
the figure the team can look towards
for unity.
"He is the inspirational leader.
Terbell's got a really big heart," he
said.
