# Rugby teams ready to get dirty this season
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Stanford men's and
women's rugby teams, which both
enjoyed a triumphant 1995-96 sea
son, are fired up and ready for the
upcoming campaign.
Winning all but two collegiate
games last year, the men's team
defeated the Golden Bears to bring
the Axe back to campus for the first
time in 16 years, and placed third
in the nation at the Final Four.
The women's squad also beat
skilled teams such as UC-Santa
Cruz and Cal Poly-Pomona to
weave its way up to the regional
championships.
According to Franck Boivert,
who has coached the men's team
for nine years and women's for
three, the upcoming season looks
promising for both squads. The
two teams are enjoying a high
turnout of new talent â€” the men's
squad has acquired over a dozen
new rookies, and nearly half of the
40 players currently participating
in the women's team practices are
newcomers with athletic experi
ence and dedication, Boivert said.
The two teams have already
begun scrimmaging and are partic

ipating in preseason exhibition
matches on a weekly basis to pre
pare for the official season begin
ning in January. They now face the
task of organizing the most effec
tive teams that will repeat the suc
cess of last season.
"This year will be a year of
rebuilding and transition" for the
Cardinal squads, Boivert said. He
added that with the immense new
talent, the teams can "definitely
get something going this year."
The rookie force will be especial
ly key for the men's team, which is
starting the season with just six of
last year's 15 starters. Whether or
not it can repeat or override last
year's triumph will largely depend
on the rookies.
"Right now. our biggest chal
lenge is to find the talent to fill in
these spots," said junior wing R.J.
Del ah 1 , who played a key role in the
squad's performance last year.
Among the new players are
fifth-year Jason White and junior
Don Donester, former football
players for the Cardinal. Other
rookies who have already proven
themselves to be promising in
Boivert's eves include freshmen
Michael Ceballos, Tim Fisher and
Borut Grgic. The three have
already seen playing time in the
exhibition matches with the Car
dinal A-side team. Boivert said
they may play this weekend as
well.
While the men's team will leave
for Sacramento State this Satur
day, the women's squad will face
experienced players the following
weekend in a match against alum
nae.
The women's team kicked off
its season by participating in a
tournament in Portland, Ore., last
weekend. The two matches against
Reed and Western Washington
State proved to be good competi
tion for the Stanford squad, which
had brought along five players
from the rookie roster. The Card
was defeated 10-0 by Reed and 10-
7 by WWSU.
"I think it went really well,"
junior scrum-half Beth Ripley
said. "They were really good learn
ing games. We basically went to
learn what we need to work on and
to check out the teams."
Ripley also said the Cardinal
will play these team during the
season and could face them in the
Final Four.
According to Boivert, the men's
game this weekend will be "a good

opportunity to seek out the new
recruits' playing."
Newcomers to the squads voiced
their excitement to be a part of the
teams and showed enthusiasm for
the upcoming season.
"There's no question about the
high skill level here," Fisher said.
"It is completely different from
high school, and I'm really looking
forward to playing for the Cardi
nal and getting to know all team
members better through more
preseason matches."
Jimmy Quattromani is also one
of few incoming players with past
experience.
"We've been getting to hang
out with (older) players, and
Franck is just awesome, too,"
Quattromani said. "He shows that
a rugby coach is a friend."
Quattromani also said he
received a warm welcome from
Boivert, who remembered meet
ing him in Colorado Springs last
year when the Cardinal squad was
playing in the Final Four and
Quattromani was participating in
a high school tournament.
"A lot of our players never
played rugby before they came to
Stanford," said fifth-year senior
Joe Clayton, a two-time All-Amer
ican. "We welcome the new people
to teach and look forward to flour
ishing their talent."
During the summer, the mem
bers of last year's Stanford squad
toured in Australia, playing
against national and collegiate

teams.
"We didn't win a lot of games,"
said senior prop Sean Noonan.
"But we matured a lot as we inte
grated the younger player into the
first team to get ready for the sea
son to come."
Other returning players retain
optimistic views of the 1996-97
squad and are more than ready
for practices to begin.
"After four years of watching
seniors graduate and watching
[Boivert] develop new players each
year, I'm confident that we will
have a strong team again," Clay
ton said.
The goals the team have set for
the season are high. However,
Boivert sees them as completely
attainable.
The women's team aspires to
return to regionals, win those
games and make it to the Final
Four.
Although the squad was not
fully rewarded for its great work
ethic last year, team members
have kept their spirits up and are
expected to perform well this sea
son, Boivert said. He added that
holding on to the Axe is the No. 1
goal for the men's team. The
squad is also aiming to stay in the
Final Four.
"The first and primary goal is
to have fun," Boivert said. "The
rest is just icing on the cake. It
seems that usually, when we enjoy
ourselves and have fun, we end
up" coming out on top.
