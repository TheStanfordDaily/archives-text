The Stanford men's and
women's rugby teams, which both
enjoyed a triumphant 1995-96 sea
son, are fired up and ready for the
upcoming campaign.
Winning all but two collegiate
games last year, the men's team
defeated the Golden Bears to bring
the Axe back to campus for the first
time in 16 years, and placed third
in the nation at the Final Four.
The women's squad also beat
skilled teams such as UC-Santa
Cruz and Cal Poly-Pomona to
weave its way up to the regional
championships.
According to Franck Boivert,
who has coached the men's team
for nine years and women's for
three, the upcoming season looks
promising for both squads. The
two teams are enjoying a high
turnout of new talent â€” the men's
squad has acquired over a dozen
new rookies, and nearly half of the
40 players currently participating
in the women's team practices are
newcomers with athletic experi
ence and dedication, Boivert said.
The two teams have already
begun scrimmaging and are partic

ipating in preseason exhibition
matches on a weekly basis to pre
pare for the official season begin
ning in January. They now face the
task of organizing the most effec
tive teams that will repeat the suc
cess of last season.
"This year will be a year of
rebuilding and transition" for the
Cardinal squads, Boivert said. He
added that with the immense new
talent, the teams can "definitely
get something going this year."
The rookie force will be especial
ly key for the men's team, which is
starting the season with just six of
last year's 15 starters. Whether or
not it can repeat or override last
year's triumph will largely depend
on the rookies.
"Right now. our biggest chal
lenge is to find the talent to fill in
these spots," said junior wing R.J.
Del ah 1 , who played a key role in the
squad's performance last year.
Among the new players are
fifth-year Jason White and junior
Don Donester, former football
players for the Cardinal. Other
rookies who have already proven
themselves to be promising in
Boivert's eves include freshmen
