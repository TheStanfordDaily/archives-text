# Swimmers will chop down the Lumberjacks
## 
### Casey Harmon 
The Stanford men's swim team will step
on the blocks against Northern Arizona at
deGuerre Pool at 2 p.m. tomorrow.
In its first scored and regularly format
ted home dual meet of the year, Stanford
should have little trouble with the Division
II Lumberjacks. It is likely that the closest
races will be between Stanford teammates
for first place in tomorrow's events, which
is why the Cardinal may split up its own
ranks and turn the competition into a
three-way meet between Stanford's red
suited team, Stanford's black-suited team
and Northern Arizona
"We haven't had an intersquad meet yet
this year," said assistant coach Ted Knapp,
"and the guys want to split our team in half
for the NAU meet."
Northern Arizona, whose colors are blue
and gold, is still a team that Stanford wants
to definitely beat, said head coach Skip
Kenney, "No matter who we are swimming,
if they are wearing blue and gold, we want
to beat them."
Kenney was perhaps looking
further down the road to the
Cardinal's next dual meet,
against another blue and gold
team, Michigan. The team from
Ann Arbor has enjoyed a rise to
prominence in the NCAA in the
past four years, and comes to
deGuerre Pool on Jan. 10.
Freshman breaststroker Steve
Ronson sees this week's meet as
an indicator for the heavily
anticipated meet against the
Wolverines as well.
"We'll use this meet as a
warmup for Michigan," Ronson

said. "We'll take our times from
this Friday and compare them
with those we've seen turned in
by Michigan at their dual meets
to see how we match up."
Make no mistake about it,
though, the Stanford team is not
discounting the meet Friday.
"Our minimum expectations
are to sweep every event against
Northern Arizona," Ronson said.
Top distance swimmer
announces intent
Stanford has been busy the
past two weekends, bringing
eight of the top high-school
recruits to the Farm in anticipa
tion of the fall letter-of-intent
signing date for athletes. While
the Cardinal does not expect to

hear from most of the recruits
for another few days, Jeremy
Kane from Santa Clara has
already called Kenney and
announced his intention to
attend Stanford.
Swimming primarily the
1,650- and 500-yard freestyles,
Kane has been one of the top
ranked distance swimmers in the
United States for the past two
years. A versatile swimmer,
Kane also will add depth to the
Stanford team in the 400-yard
individual medley next year.
"We are really excited about
Jeremy's decision to come to
Stanford, and we hope to be
hearing from the other seven
swimmers we brought out this
fall," Claypool said.
