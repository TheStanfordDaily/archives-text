# Swimmers will chop down the Lumberjacks

The Stanford men's swim team will step
on the blocks against Northern Arizona at
deGuerre Pool at 2 p.m. tomorrow.
In its first scored and regularly format
ted home dual meet of the year, Stanford
should have little trouble with the Division
II Lumberjacks. It is likely that the closest
races will be between Stanford teammates
for first place in tomorrow's events, which
is why the Cardinal may split up its own
ranks and turn the competition into a
three-way meet between Stanford's red
suited team, Stanford's black-suited team
and Northern Arizona
"We haven't had an intersquad meet yet
this year," said assistant coach Ted Knapp,
"and the guys want to split our team in half
for the NAU meet."
Northern Arizona, whose colors are blue
and gold, is still a team that Stanford wants
to definitely beat, said head coach Skip
Kenney, "No matter who we are swimming,
if they are wearing blue and gold, we want
to beat them."
