# Men snag twins, beat Germany

### Bobby Cuza Staff writer 
Stanford basketball got a
boost in its rise toward
national prominence yesterday
when it signed two of the
nation's most sought-after prep
recruits.
Jason and Jarron Collins of
Harvard-Westlake High School in
North Hollywood, Calif., signed
national letters of intent with the
Cardinal, choosing Stanford over
Arizona and UCLA in what had
become a high-profile recruiting
war.
The Collins twins were report
edly leaning toward UCLA before
they became involved in the now
infamous recruiting dinner that
led to the firing of Bruin head
coach Jim Harrick last Wednes
day. An article in yesterday's edi
tion of the San Francisco Chroni
cle indicated that the twins —
who wanted to attend the same
college — had instead opted for
Arizona. The San Jose Mercury
News, meanwhile, published a
report that the twins were sign
ing with Stanford.
Wednesday, the 6-foot-ll
Jason and the 6-10 Jarron made
it official, joining Mike McDonald

of Long Beach Poly High in form
ing one of Stanford's best-ever
recruiting classes.
"We are extremely pleased
with our recruiting class this
year," said head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We felt that a good
recruiting class this year, coupled
with the young players we have
now, would allow us to continue
to raise the level of our program."
Jarron and Jason shared state,
division and league Co-Player of
the Year honors last season in
leading Harvard-Westlake to a
30-3 record and the Division 111
state title. Jarron, the higher
rated of the two, averaged 14.2
points, 10.6 rebounds and two
blocked shots per game while
shooting 61 percent from the
field. Jason averaged 20.2 points,
14.6 rebounds and four blocks
while shooting a sizzling 71 per
cent.
"It was really a hard decision,"
said Paul Collins, Jarron and
Jason's father. "We weighed a lot
of pluses and minuses of all the
different schools. In the end, [the
twins] wanted to stay near their
family and play in front of their
grandfather |who resides in Daly
City]."
McDonald, whose father,

Glenn, played for the Boston
Celtics from 1974-76, is a 6-foot,
170-pound point guard who aver
aged 18 points, six assists and six
rebounds during his junior sea
son.
"In recruiting McDonald, one
of our primary objectives was to
replace Brevin Knight's position
with a quality point guard,"
Montgomery said. "It was a good
year for point guards in Califor
nia, and we feel we landed the
premier student athlete."
Meanwhile, the Stanford faith
ful got their first glimpse of the
1996-97 Cardinal last night in an
exhibition game against the Ger
man National Under-22 Team.
Led by sophomore center Tim
Young, who wowed the 2,406 fans
in attendance with 16 first-half
points (he finished with 20), the
Cardinal jumped out to an 18-4
lead and never looked back in
cruising to an 88-50 victory.
Stanford had four players in
double figures, with freshman
Ryan Mendez scoring 14 points,
junior Pete Van Elswyk 12 and
sophomore Kris Weems 10.
Sophomore point guard Arthur
Lee had seven points and six
assists in filling in for the mildly
injured Brevin Knight.
