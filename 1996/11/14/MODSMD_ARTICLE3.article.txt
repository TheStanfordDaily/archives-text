# 'Dean Jean' to leave current post
## Fetter announces she will resume sabbatical started in 1991 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
Assistant to the President and for
mer Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter has announced she
will leave her current position in order
to resume a sabbatical interrupted
five years ago.
"It's been most wonderful," Fetter
said of her job with the president. "It's
been a great privilege to work with
someone such as [University Presi
dent Gerhard) Casper."

Her leave is effective Jan. 1.
Fetter, an Oxford University-trained physicist and
former professor of physics at San Jose State Universi
ty, first came to Stanford in 1975 to work at the Center
for Teaching and Learning. Two years later she became

assistant to then-University President Richard
Lyman.
In 1984, after having served as associate dean for
graduate studies and research, Fetter became the dean
of undergraduate admissions, a position she held for
seven years.
In the fall of 1991, Fetter decided to leave her post
and take a sabbatical. On that sabbatical, she began to
write a comprehensive book, titled "Questions and Ad
missions: Reflections on 100,000 Admissions Decisions
at Stanford," which was published in 1995.
The sabbatical, however, was short-lived. Six weeks
after it began, she was asked by members of the Board
of Trustees to serve as vice chair of the presidential
search committee that eventually chose Casper to re
place outgoing University President Donald Kennedy.
"It was hard to pass up," said Fetter, concerning
