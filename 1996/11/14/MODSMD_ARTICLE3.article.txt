# 'Dean Jean' to leave current post
## Fetter announces she will resume sabbatical started in 1991 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
Assistant to the President and for
mer Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sions Jean Fetter has announced she
will leave her current position in order
to resume a sabbatical interrupted
five years ago.
"It's been most wonderful," Fetter
said of her job with the president. "It's
been a great privilege to work with
someone such as [University Presi
dent Gerhard) Casper."

Her leave is effective Jan. 1.
Fetter, an Oxford University-trained physicist and
former professor of physics at San Jose State Universi
ty, first came to Stanford in 1975 to work at the Center
for Teaching and Learning. Two years later she became

assistant to then-University President Richard
Lyman.
In 1984, after having served as associate dean for
graduate studies and research, Fetter became the dean
of undergraduate admissions, a position she held for
seven years.
In the fall of 1991, Fetter decided to leave her post
and take a sabbatical. On that sabbatical, she began to
write a comprehensive book, titled "Questions and Ad
missions: Reflections on 100,000 Admissions Decisions
at Stanford," which was published in 1995.
The sabbatical, however, was short-lived. Six weeks
after it began, she was asked by members of the Board
of Trustees to serve as vice chair of the presidential
search committee that eventually chose Casper to re
place outgoing University President Donald Kennedy.
"It was hard to pass up," said Fetter, concerning

joining the committee.
"The search took five months. It
was relatively short," she added.
"We were overjoyed at the out
come."
In July 1992, Casper named Fet
ter assistant to the president.
Fetter said she has enjoyed
working with Casper and finds him
a great addition to the University,
as well as to her life.
"One of his great strengths is al
ways asking questions," said Fet
ter. "When you've worked here for
20 years you tend to look at things
in a more traditional way. We have
only benefited from his pushing
and pulling about how to make
things better."
Casper had nothing but praise
for his assistant.
"She's a wise teacher, a sympa
thetic listener and a reliable
friend," he said. "She has been in
valuable to me and invaluable to
Stanford. I regret her departure,

but I understand that she decided
to move on."
Fetter's duties will be divided be
tween Assoc. Provost for Program
Development Jacqueline Wender
and University Communications
Director Terry Shepard. In the new
structure, Wender will handle in
ternal University issues, and Shep
ard will handle external communi
cations issues.
Both said they are looking for
ward to filling Fetter's shoes.
"We're sorry to lose her, and we'll
miss her," said Shepard.
He added, however, that both he
and Wender are enthusiastic about
working with each other.
"I enjoy the challenge and new
things [we have planned]. I am ex
cited about working with Jacque
line," he said. "We will help manage
[Casper's] schedule, so he will be
free to lead."
Fetter said she is unsure where
her future will lead. "I have no
specific plans. I plan to do some
reading," she said. "One develops
different ambitions [as one gets
older]. I just became a grand
mother."
