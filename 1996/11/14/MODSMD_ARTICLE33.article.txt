# Disability Resource Center staff doubles
## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Many new faces have shown up at the Dis
ability Resource Center this fall, and not all of
them are students. Since late last year, the cen
ter has doubled its staff from two professional
members to four.
Joan Bisagno, acting director of the center,
was hired last spring, replacing former Direc
tor Nancy Deason. Asst. Director Carla Dunn
also left.
Dunn, whose position no longer exists, was
in charge of coordinating programs for physi
cally disabled students, as well as serving as
the center's assistant director â€” what Bisagno
called "a huge job."
"We've parceled it up differently, and it's

working a lot better," Bisagno said.
Teri Adams, former office manager for the
center, has shifted positions to become the pro
gram coordinator for students with physical
disabilities.
The center then hired a full-time office
manager, Suzanne Cailiat, to fill Adams' va
cated position. Cailiat has only been employed
at the center for a couple of weeks, according to
Bisagno.
The center also hired Anne Petersen to
serve as program coordinator for students with
visual and learning disabilities, another new
position.
"Some of the hiring was done in the transi
tion period before Nancy Deason left," said
Bisagno, who was also involved in the hiring
process last June.

Changes at the center are reflective of larg
er administrative functions.
"There's been some changes in the budget
structure," Bisagno said. The changes enabled
the center to hire Accommodations Coordina
tor Donna Davies, another newly created posi
tion at the center.
According to Bisagno, Davies plays a "piv
otal" role in interacting with students. "We
thought it would be highly desirable to have
this position."
Despite the new faces behind the desks, the
center still offers note-taking, interpreter and
DisGo cart services, which provides disabled stu
dents with extra help getting around campus.
"The services remain the same," Bisagno
said. "Students don't have different needs no
matter who is staffed."
