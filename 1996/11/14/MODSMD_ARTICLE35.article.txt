# Intermission
## 
### 
November 14,1996

Cover 10
Gaieties from the inside out: Ariana Garfinkel gets the scoop on
Stanford's annual theatrical extravaganza.
Calendar 4
Floss your teeth, slick back your hair and hit the town, you good
looking thing, you.
Restaurant 5
Polio's calls, we answer. (We're ugly and we're self-indulgent, but
we're the editors and we can publish whatever we want.)
Dance 6
Maria Benitez talks flamenco dancing and politics. They're more
connected than you might think.
Book 9
The endearingly tortured James Copeland muses on Robert Olen
Butler's "Tabloid Dreams." The book jacket features a large eyeball.
Profile 12
Devin Oatway, who's done TV ads for McDonald's, schmoozes
with Larry Bishop, writer and director of "Mad Dog Time." You
might not have heard of this movie yet, but you will soon.
Film 13
"Twelfth Night" is about cross-dressing, love, bisexuality and things
like that, which means Intermission will like it.
Music 14
This week includes a review of a CD by a band featuring a guy
who's a sophomore here. He hounded us directly and through in
termediaries for several weeks, so we hope he's happy now.
Theater 18
Everything's coming up roses in the A.C.T.'s production of "The
Rose Tatoo."
Classies 19
The monster that's overtaking Intermission.
