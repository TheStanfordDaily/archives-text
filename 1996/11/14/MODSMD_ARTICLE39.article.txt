## Passion at Polio's Two perspectives on Stanford's new eatery 
### 
She Said
Kveryone, even Daily editors, needs a little romance every
now and then, and it was with this thought in mind that my
co-editor Sam and I embarked on our first date.
We considering merely adjourning to the I >aily lounge and
whispering sweet nothings to each other on the editor in
chief's grandmother's sofa in there. But the office can grind
you down — the neon lighting, the lack of air circulation, the
paltry selection ofedibles — and we realized we needed some
thing more ambient. Luckily for us, Polio's had opened in
Tresidder that very day.
We were beckoned toward the entrance by a neon jalapeno
pepper. Inside, the decor was similarly festive: bright tiles,
painted chairs and a red wooden floor inlaid with the Stanford
logo.
The whole thing felt like one of those hangouts for fun
lovin' young adults you see on TV — The Peach Pit, say, or the
diner in "Saved by the Bell." 1 was briefly tempted to break into
song and dance and then cool down by high-fiving the cashier,
but I reconsidered.
About the food: I ordered a chicken quesadilla. When
everything arrived, I was so excited I got confused and acci
dentally started eating Sam's taco. This was a fairly significant
first-date faux pas, but it was mitigated by the fact that his
food turned out to be much better than mine. Overall, every
thing tasted about how you'd expect it to — more than Taco
Bell, slightly less than Chevy's. I did note an absence of fresh
salsa.
Our second course was flan for two. The syrup was partic
ularly tasty, and besides that, I was almost giddy at the
prospect of being fed by Sam.
I thought things were going well between us, but as it
turned out, the peak of the evening was all in my imagination.
During dessert, my leg brushed against something under the
table, and for one beautiful moment, I thought Sam was cop
ping a feel. Alas, it turned out to be a pole.
So 1 can't really vouch for Polio's as a locale of raciness or
intrigue. But I did come away with a full stomach, having for
gotten for a good 20 minutes that 1 was still on campus.

He Said
After two months of
great sexual tension be
tween us, my co-editor
and I finally decided to
go on a date. Through
the making of eight is
sues of Intermission, it
had been hard for us to
contain our desire to
suddenly stop what we
were doing and jump
onto the newsroom floor
in fits of passion. But like
Clark Kent and Lois Lane
or even Hugh Downs
and Barbara Walters, we
had tried to stay profes
sional. Until now.
It was time for us to
make the chicken
dance. Hoping to cry
like a rooster the morn-

ing after, we went to
Polio's. There, I tried to figure out what to order. The
cashier stared at me blankly, and it occurred to me that
the first and most important difference between Polio's
and the Coffee House is that you don't get to flirt with
the hot undergrads serving you food.
Once the ordeal of ordering was over (I got the taco
con carne asada; Curtis got a chicken quesadilla), we sat
down to eat. Hut she accidentally started eating my taco,
and I was already fingering her quesadilla. Tension. We
decided the best thing to do was to cut the food in half,
Solomon-like, and share.
During our meal, we talked about deep and impor
tant things: like the concept of people having sex ilurmv;
marriage, what kind of people we find attractive and
what constitutes a date (this, obviously, didn't).

Polio's has its pluses: It's cheap, which for students is
important. Polio's is well-lit, which guarantees that
what you see is what you get. Finally, Polio's has roomy
booths that can fit two people perfectly.
On the down side: Polio's has garish red, blue and
green decor that kills off any romantic sparks. Polio's
has food heavy on carbohydrates and has few vegetari
an choices. And yes, Polio's is too close to Taco Bell for
comfort.
I don't know it it was a successful date. The next day,
we did what we usually do anyway — spent hours work
ing on this issue, staring longingly at each other but
knowing that our passions had to wait until the opening
of the next fast food place on campus.
