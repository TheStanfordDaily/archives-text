# Missing student puzzles police
## 
### Perry Chen Contributing writer 
Despite the efforts of three police departments
and the FBI, investigators are still mystified by last
month's disappearance of Stanford continuing stud
ies student Ylva Hagner.
Hagner disappeared sometime on the evening of
Oct. 14. In addition to being a product manager at
Ixos Software in Belmont, the 42-year-old Hagner
was enrolled at Stanford, where she had been work
ing toward a master's in fine arts.
According to police reports quoted in the San Jose
Mercury News, Hagner was last seen working some
time around 9:30 p.m. She did not return home and
police later found her car, a black 1992 Honda Civic
hatchback, abandoned six blocks away from her work

near the corner of El Camino Real and Spring Street
in San Carlos.
Reports also indicate that Hagner's car was found
unlocked, with the keys still in the ignition. Although
Hagner's purse was missing, police could not find any
compelling evidence of foul play in the car, and no one
has used her credit cards or bank account since her
disappearance, Belmont Police Commander Larry
Riche said.
Although there are close to a dozen investigators
working on the case, Riche said, "We still haven't de
termined if there's even been a crime committed
here. ... As it stands right now, it is still a missing
person case."
Riche added, however, that the case is being inves-
tigated as a criminal case. "We've
talked to her boyfriend and ex
boyfriends, looked at all the evi
dence and done a complete bio
graphical sketch," he said.
"In addition to our depart
ment, we've also got the FBI, the
San Carlos Police Department
and the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment investigating this case,"
Riche said.
Last week, search warrants
were filed by police in Redwood
City Municipal Court. In the doc
uments submitted, police sources
said they feared Hagner was being
"prevented by force from making
contact with anyone," according
to the Mercury News
While this claim has not been
proven, police examination of
Hagner's phone records from Oct.
14 show she made more than a
half-dozen calls that night, one of
which might somehow be connect
ed to her disappearance.
Ken Farber, an employee at Ixos
Software who knew Hagner, said
he had recently heard news reports
that "police were suspecting foul
play and that there might be invol
untary imprisonment involved."
Employees at Ixos and Hagn

er's family are putting together a
reward fund and including her
name in missing persons fliers in
hopes of locating her, Farber said.
In addition, friends and associates
have created a World Wide Web
site devoted to finding Hagner
(http://www.andreas.com/miss
ing/).
Farber noted that fliers will be
handed out Saturday at the Safe
way grocery store in Belmont in
order to increase awareness about
Hagner's disappearance and find
more leads.
Many theories and leads have
been offered, but Riche said,
"There are still many possibili
ties. ... We haven't singled any
thing out yet."
Riche remarked that "this is
one of those cases you hate to see
because you just don't know what
happened."
The Mercury News reported
that Hagner originally came to the
United States after falling in love
with an American while in Ger
many. After they were married in
1983, both moved to Santa Bar
bara and later divorced. In 1990,
Hagner moved to the Bay Area,
where she remained until her dis
appearance.
Police describe Hagner as being
white, 5 feet 6 inches tall and 110
pounds. She has blue eyes, red
hair and a fair complexion.
