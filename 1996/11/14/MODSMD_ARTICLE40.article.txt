## Maria Benitez and Co. bring spicy Spanish dancing to Stanford 
### Liz Chien 
Passion. Urgency. Drama. These elements
will permeate Memorial Auditorium tonight
as the Maria Benitez Teatro Flamenco take to
the stage in their rendition of Manuel de
Falla's "F.I Amor Brujo," followed by "Kstam
pa Flamenca!," a traditional display of fla
menco dance.
Presented by Stanford Lively Arts, Maria
Benitez and her troupe of Spanish dancers
will pay tribute to the s()th anniversary of the
death of composer Manuel de l-alla by dra
matizing his work, "HI Amor Brujo."
Formulated in the trenches of wild, tragic
and magical gypsy legends, this is a story
about C'.andelas, a gypsy girl who is "over

come by love for her gypsy lover, who's a
womanizer," according to Benitez.
"She's extremely hurt by that and decides
to play a little trick on him by luring him into
.1 witches' cave, where she flirts and plays
with him under the disguise of a beautiful
witch. However, when he realizes that the se
ductress is actually Candelas, he begs her to
take him back, but she tells him that she'll
consider it.
"This is a great storyline because in most
Spanish plays, the heroine usually dies of
love, while the guy goes off into the sunset
with another woman," Benitez said.
Benitez, who just completed choreo
graphing "Carmen" for the Metropolitan
Opera of New York, brings to this project

more than 20 years of
experience in the field
of Spanish dance.
"I started out with
ballet when 1 was
around 10 years old,
hut became involved
with flamenco a cou
ple of years later,"
Benitez said. Of Puer
to Rican and Native
American ancestry,
Benitez lived with her
mother who taught at
reservation schools.
Benitez traveled to
Spain at age 19 to
learn the art form of
flamenco from the
grand masters.
After dancing in
Spain for a couple of
years in both small
and large companies,
she decided to return
to the United States
and start her own
company. Founded in
1970 in a bar in
Tesuque, N.M., the
Maria Benitez Teatro
Flamenco made its
debut comprised of
only Benitez, a male
dancer and a guitarist.
Their hard work
paid off— her dance
troupe now boasts a
national and interna
tional reputation as
the leading Spanish
dance company in the
United States.
Surging with raw
passion and energy,
Benitez draws from
her past to express the
intensity of her char
acters.

"Flamenco is a
musical style that is born out of an oppressed
people, similar to jazz and blues," Benitez
said. Unfortunately, this art form is slowly
dying in the United States.
" There is too little of it out there," Benitez
said. "The message has to be put out there
that a person can make a living with flamen
co. We try to make that possible through
workshops that give people an opportunity
to perform."
Benitez and her husband Cecilio offer this
opportunity through the Institute for Span
ish Arts, which they co-founded.
"Its mission is to disseminate and preserve
the art form of flamenco," Benitez said. "We
felt that there was something more that had
to be done with Spanish dance besides per

forming, and since the troupe can t do small
communities because of the costs involved,
we felt that starting a second company would
be the best way to bring Spanish dance to
them by playing in small, isolated towns and
doing lots of school shows."
This is not to say that the Maria Benite/
Teatro Flamenco docs not perform in small
er venues. Every summer, the troupe plays in
Santa Fe, N.M., and then spends the fall and
winter seasons touring domestically and in
ternationally.
Spring is used to recruit new dancers from
Spain and to take care of day-to-day business.
The troupe is not a year-round affair but one
that survives and is funded from project to
project.
For every performance, "We have to raise
the money to do work and for new costumes,
which we usually do through the National
Endowment for the Arts. But with the re
gained Republican control of Congress, I
don't know how long that source will exist,
Benitez said.
Regardless of these financial worries, per
forming the traditional art of flamenco is the
balm that soothes her soul. "Passionate dam
ing is a discipline you acquire that demands
that you concentrate fully at that moment
and shut out everything else — financial
worries or personal problems — except lor
that moment. You have to relax to a point
where you're just completely absorbed in the
music."
Benitez will bring her power and fervor to
Stanford tonight with a flounce of her 6 foot
long trained costume. Performing with Ben
itez are Antonio Granjero, Rafael Martos,
Immaculada Ortega, Adriana Maresma-Fois
and Estafania Ramirez, and singers lesus
Montoya and Immaculada Ortega, with Jose
Valle Fajardo and )uan Requena on guitars.
The performance will be filled with such
raw emotion that Benitez warns: "It is im
possible for people not to react to it in some
way."
