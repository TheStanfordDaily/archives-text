# Elvis, JFK and a waterbed with a mind of its own
## In 'Tabloid Dreams' Robert Olen Butler examines America's seedy gestures and secret hopes 
### James Copeland 
The commuter train rumbles along
through evening in California. A twilight
blurs by outside, but where I am is static and
fluorescent, a $3.75 ticket. I'm sitting, just
looking around. The window shows me
weeds coming up around the backsides of
mini-malls, unempty parking lots and things
bent and stuck, all passing.

BOOK REVIEW

On this side of the window I 'm accompa
nied by an assortment of business-type indi
viduals. They glance through today's paper,
perhaps on the chance of catching something
missed on the identical trip that morning.
They don't appear to be reading the articles
thoroughly, just turning the paper over and
over. It's not too hard for me to catch some ot
the headlines on their papers. They're com
pact, clear, loud, self-contained:
BOY'S THOUGHTS WANDER
CORPORATE EXEC DOESN'T ACTU
ALLY READ PAPER
COMMUTER TRAIN STOPS â€” NO
BODY GETS ON, OFF
Ultimately the day is unexceptional. The
headlines tell them this. They don't read the
articles simply because they do not care.
Robert Olen Butler's new collection of
short stories is titled "Tabloid Dreams"
(I Iciirv Holt; $22.50) and endears itself to the
exploration of this tendency of contempo
rary culture to love the lie. The book has 12
stories, each constructed upon a situation
fantasy of high and low culture, sex, violence,
cookie bake-offs and Wal-Mart at 3 a.m.
The titles of Butler's 12 stories read farml-

iarly and, despite their
extravagance, seem al
most obvious: "JFK
Secretly Attends Jack
ie Auction," "Woman
Struck by Car Turns
into Nymphomani
ac," "Help Me Find
My Spaceman Lover."
but each phenom
enon exploited in the
headline creates an
appealing situation.
Each story is narrated
in the First person, and
the characters present
themselves simply
and honestly but also
as subjects and prod
ucts and victims of
New America. Ibis
anxiety of the individ
ual in a society which
denies truth is Butler's
means for creating the
book's profoundly
moving hilarity.
Popular culture
and all its myths have
roots in certain
human truths, and
this is because it is so
massive, so powerful

and so much us. If the tabloid headline is a lie
it exists only because we want it to be true
lust like we wanted The 1 itanic to be unsink
able.
In the book's first story, "Titanic Victirr
Speaks Through Waterbed," a man find;
himself existing no longer as human beinj.

but as water after an abrupt ending to his
1 s) 12 trans-Atlantic voyage. I he man travels
as sea, river, cloud and cup of tea. I le passes
through a woman's body (appropriately
averting Ins vision at the correct moment),
travels the sewers and winds up as .1 wa
terbed. but one memory alone remains a

comfort to him, even so many years past,
from a brief encounter with a woman that he
met just as the ship's doom became immi
nent. They knew each other for only minutes,
and only few words were exchanged, hut a
certain incident occurred that was more ex
traordinary than even his bizarre afterlife.
"Boy Born with Tattoo of Elvis" follows a
16-year-old through his first sexual en
counter and his grappling with the obstacle
of having I Ivis Presley's head, life-size, in the
center of his chest. The boy knows not the
grace and style of the icon emblazoned upon
him. He knows not of intimacy, attraction or
excitement. But perhaps an inert quality
something not obvious to his look, to his
skin, knows something of love.
Butler, now living in Louisiana, was edu
cated at Northwestern I'niversity and in
tended to become an actor. But at about the
time he discovered he'd rather write than re
cite he was in Vietnam translating tor the
Army. His experience in the war was the in
spiration for his last collection of short sto
ries, "A Good Scent from a Strange Moun
tain,'' which garnered the Pulitzer Prize tor
fiction in 1993. "Tabloid Dreams is his ninth
book since he began writing in 1 1.
His character are the subjects and products
and victims of New America. In"I )oomsdav

the world while deliberating over the advan

sion which he contemplates, but the realm
that he understands. People exist within those
tabloids along supermarket check out lines,
and Butler writes with a tendency to low those
people. He chooses not to dismiss popular
culture, his culture, but uses it as the medium
across which he can express his emotion.
