# When You Wish Upon a Part
## Gaieties auditions like you've never tested them before 
### 
"You're interrupting me?!" junior Tim
Quinn snarls at the vocal director of Gaieties,
who dared to cut short his rendition of a song
from "Les Miserables."
Quinn is one of several Gaieties auditionees
so enamored of the spotlight that they refused
to stop singing, even after the casting directors
said thank you. And began clapping. Shouting
"Enough already, you ham, get off the stage!"
might have been the next course of action, but
the actor desisted.
Naturally, Quinn was cast in a lead role.
It's never a bashful group that auditions for
Gaieties, the musical production which annu
ally allows eager freshmen to introduce them
selves to some 3,000 audience members in the
first quarter of school.
A 75-year-old Stanford tradition, Gaieties
irreverently parodies Stanford, UG-Berkeley,
popular culture and anything else within its
grubby reach, but the program holds one rule
sacred — that the all-original plotline of each
year's show remain absolutely confidential
until opening night.
Lying about the story's content is not un
heard of. In fact, if this year's cast members are
to be believed, every single one of them will be
playing Batman in the show.
Though this reporter's most cunning inves
tigative reporting could not wrench free the
plot for her readers, worry not. Intermission
took the precaution of infiltrating auditions
six weeks ago to get a behind-the-scenes
glimpse at this critical point in the creation of
a uniquely Stanford event.
A Gaieties audition is nothing if not inter
active. From the seats of Memorial Auditori
um in early October, the directors laugh, cheer,
yell suggestions and all but throw wadded-up
paper at the auditionees on stage.
Only at these auditions can a woman per
form a striptease as she sings the Hebrew tune
Hinei Mah Ibv," and find three-quarters of
the casting directors gleefully joining in song.
"Did you know we were all Jewish?" asks as
sistant director Kate Lowenhar.
"1 figured," the auditionee responds dryly.

How hip is Gaieties? No Shakespeare here,
the auditionees read a scene composed of
lyrics from "Rent," the hottest new musical on
Broadway. I low wacky is Gaieties? The names
of the characters auditionees play: Kherri and
Strugg.
Gaieties is produced by the student-run
Ram's Head Theatrical Society, so every posi
tion — writers, directors, actors, technicians
— is filled by someone in your dorm, your CIV
section or your Torah study group.
Without "grown-up" supervision, the au
ditions develop an anything-goes attitude,
which keeps the crew in hysterics and prepares
the future cast for the sometimes raunchy
script they will encounter.
It's hard to imagine the directors of a
Drama Department show shouting out cate
gories of humor after each auditionee tells a
joke, such as "dick jokes," "fart jokes" and "golf
humor."
"They laughed even when you weren't
funny," said freshman Suzannah Tipermas
after her audition. "They made you feel like
they were your friends. It was like the staff was
in cahoots with you to help you get the part."
Tipermas auditioned with her close friend
from high school, freshman Nathan Baynard.
Both were surprised that the directors didn't
separate the two friends into different groups.
In fact, they were instructed to read a scene 1
together on stage. d
"Sometimes when you audition for a '
part, it seems like the director is mad at you
for coming to their auditions, like they don't
want you there," Tipermas said. "Here, they re
ally made us feel like we were worth their
time."
The casting staff (which includes a director,
assistant director, vocal director, assistant
vocal director, choreographer, assistant chore
ographer, musical director and anyone else
who happens to pass by) say they are always
rooting for the auditionees to do well.
"We're not trying to trip them up or psyche
them out," said director Jeremy Desmon, a se
nior. "We're always thinking, 'Please do it well,

be what we're looking for, fit the right role.'
Tipermas had been on campus tor less than
a month when she auditioned, but she had al
ready heard enough about Gaieties to desig
nate it"the freshman experience." She joined
almost 100 enthusiastic Gaieties hopefuls,
more than half of whom were freshmen.
"Gaieties attracts freshmen because they ar
rive on campus looking to find people like
themselves," Desmon said. "If you were a the
ater-type person in high school and you're put
in a dorm with maybe one or two other theater
people, then you can show up at Gaieties audi
tions and find yourself surrounded by stu
dents with your same interest."
As they wait their turn, the auditionees
bond in the green room to the side of the stage.
Less than half of them will actually be cast in
the show, but those that are will later express
fond feelings for their original audition group.
Meanwhile, the staff waits in the theater,
gossiping about past shows and Ram's Head
scandals. They recount one legendary dilem
ma from a previous year's audition: Nobody
could determine the gender of one auditionee.
Since the mystery person's first name was no
help, they finally sent someone to look on
Axess for his or her middle name. It was Lee.
Almost all the primary staff members are
alumni of a past Gaieties. The most common
initiation into the Gaieties (and Ram's Head)
family is acting in the show freshman year,
which makes for a very sympathetic produc
tion staff.

"Having been through the audition

process on the other end, you

want to be able to say the
one thing that will calm
them down and make
them less nervous be
cause you recognize every
expression on their faces,
every shuffle of their feet,
you've been there,"
Lowenhar, a sophomore,
said.

can be grueling, the ex

cast reappear at these auditions, some mar
veling at their own masochism as they recall
the sacrifice of grades, sleep and sanity last fall.
"I've been smoking a lot of crack lately, so I
found myself thinking of doing Gaieties
again," said (clean and sober) junior Holl\
Crafts, who acted in last year's show, "The Axe
Files." "It just sucks you back in."
And really, who could resist an audition
which instructs 10 students to line up in a row
on stage and scream "penis" from the bottom
of their sex-starved little souls?
Still, the question must arise whether pas
sionate shrieking of anatomical parts and the
telling of a sufficiently vulgar joke will actualh
reveal the most skillful actors. The crew ofGai

eties admits that there is a specific type of tal-

ent they look for in composing the
cast.

"It's not high art we are en
gaging in," Desmon explained. "It
you can only pull out the sub
tleties of a Shakespearean mono
logue, we don't want you. There is
a Gaieties personality, and you can

sense it almost immediately when
someone walks on stage."
