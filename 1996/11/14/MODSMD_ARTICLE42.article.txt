# When You Wish Upon a Part
## Gaieties auditions like you've never tested them before 
### 
"You're interrupting me?!" junior Tim
Quinn snarls at the vocal director of Gaieties,
who dared to cut short his rendition of a song
from "Les Miserables."
Quinn is one of several Gaieties auditionees
so enamored of the spotlight that they refused
to stop singing, even after the casting directors
said thank you. And began clapping. Shouting
"Enough already, you ham, get off the stage!"
might have been the next course of action, but
the actor desisted.
Naturally, Quinn was cast in a lead role.
It's never a bashful group that auditions for
Gaieties, the musical production which annu
ally allows eager freshmen to introduce them
selves to some 3,000 audience members in the
first quarter of school.
A 75-year-old Stanford tradition, Gaieties
irreverently parodies Stanford, UG-Berkeley,
popular culture and anything else within its
grubby reach, but the program holds one rule
sacred — that the all-original plotline of each
year's show remain absolutely confidential
until opening night.
Lying about the story's content is not un
heard of. In fact, if this year's cast members are
to be believed, every single one of them will be
playing Batman in the show.
Though this reporter's most cunning inves
tigative reporting could not wrench free the
plot for her readers, worry not. Intermission
took the precaution of infiltrating auditions
six weeks ago to get a behind-the-scenes
glimpse at this critical point in the creation of
a uniquely Stanford event.
A Gaieties audition is nothing if not inter
active. From the seats of Memorial Auditori
um in early October, the directors laugh, cheer,
yell suggestions and all but throw wadded-up
paper at the auditionees on stage.
Only at these auditions can a woman per
form a striptease as she sings the Hebrew tune
Hinei Mah Ibv," and find three-quarters of
the casting directors gleefully joining in song.
"Did you know we were all Jewish?" asks as
sistant director Kate Lowenhar.
"1 figured," the auditionee responds dryly.

How hip is Gaieties? No Shakespeare here,
the auditionees read a scene composed of
lyrics from "Rent," the hottest new musical on
Broadway. I low wacky is Gaieties? The names
of the characters auditionees play: Kherri and
Strugg.
Gaieties is produced by the student-run
Ram's Head Theatrical Society, so every posi
tion — writers, directors, actors, technicians
— is filled by someone in your dorm, your CIV
section or your Torah study group.
Without "grown-up" supervision, the au
ditions develop an anything-goes attitude,
which keeps the crew in hysterics and prepares
the future cast for the sometimes raunchy
script they will encounter.
It's hard to imagine the directors of a
Drama Department show shouting out cate
gories of humor after each auditionee tells a
joke, such as "dick jokes," "fart jokes" and "golf
humor."
"They laughed even when you weren't
funny," said freshman Suzannah Tipermas
after her audition. "They made you feel like
they were your friends. It was like the staff was
in cahoots with you to help you get the part."
Tipermas auditioned with her close friend
from high school, freshman Nathan Baynard.
Both were surprised that the directors didn't
separate the two friends into different groups.
In fact, they were instructed to read a scene 1
together on stage. d
"Sometimes when you audition for a '
part, it seems like the director is mad at you
for coming to their auditions, like they don't
want you there," Tipermas said. "Here, they re
ally made us feel like we were worth their
time."
The casting staff (which includes a director,
assistant director, vocal director, assistant
vocal director, choreographer, assistant chore
ographer, musical director and anyone else
who happens to pass by) say they are always
rooting for the auditionees to do well.
"We're not trying to trip them up or psyche
them out," said director Jeremy Desmon, a se
nior. "We're always thinking, 'Please do it well,

be what we're looking for, fit the right role.'
Tipermas had been on campus tor less than
a month when she auditioned, but she had al
ready heard enough about Gaieties to desig
nate it"the freshman experience." She joined
almost 100 enthusiastic Gaieties hopefuls,
more than half of whom were freshmen.
"Gaieties attracts freshmen because they ar
rive on campus looking to find people like
themselves," Desmon said. "If you were a the
ater-type person in high school and you're put
in a dorm with maybe one or two other theater
people, then you can show up at Gaieties audi
tions and find yourself surrounded by stu
dents with your same interest."
As they wait their turn, the auditionees
bond in the green room to the side of the stage.
Less than half of them will actually be cast in
the show, but those that are will later express
fond feelings for their original audition group.
Meanwhile, the staff waits in the theater,
gossiping about past shows and Ram's Head
scandals. They recount one legendary dilem
ma from a previous year's audition: Nobody
could determine the gender of one auditionee.
Since the mystery person's first name was no
help, they finally sent someone to look on
Axess for his or her middle name. It was Lee.
Almost all the primary staff members are
alumni of a past Gaieties. The most common
initiation into the Gaieties (and Ram's Head)
family is acting in the show freshman year,
which makes for a very sympathetic produc
tion staff.

"Having been through the audition

process on the other end, you

want to be able to say the
one thing that will calm
them down and make
them less nervous be
cause you recognize every
expression on their faces,
every shuffle of their feet,
you've been there,"
Lowenhar, a sophomore,
said.

Though the intense six
week production schedule

can be grueling, the ex
perience of being

involved in
one of the
largest

the-
atri-
c a 1
events on

campus is so enticing
that many perform
ers return every
year.

cast reappear at these auditions, some mar
veling at their own masochism as they recall
the sacrifice of grades, sleep and sanity last fall.
"I've been smoking a lot of crack lately, so I
found myself thinking of doing Gaieties
again," said (clean and sober) junior Holl\
Crafts, who acted in last year's show, "The Axe
Files." "It just sucks you back in."
And really, who could resist an audition
which instructs 10 students to line up in a row
on stage and scream "penis" from the bottom
of their sex-starved little souls?
Still, the question must arise whether pas
sionate shrieking of anatomical parts and the
telling of a sufficiently vulgar joke will actualh
reveal the most skillful actors. The crew ofGai

eties admits that there is a specific type of tal-

ent they look for in composing the
cast.

"It's not high art we are en
gaging in," Desmon explained. "It
you can only pull out the sub
tleties of a Shakespearean mono
logue, we don't want you. There is
a Gaieties personality, and you can

sense it almost immediately when
someone walks on stage."
The staff members found

themselves redefining the concept ot
talent to fit the needs ol this

production.
"Talent for Gaieties means charisma and
energy," Lowenhar said. "The resources we are
drawing from are not necessarily the best
singers, dancers or actors at Stanford, but they
all have stage presence. Tone deaf can always
lip sync!"
Another consideration is how each actor

Holly Crafts.

will cooperate with the 30 others in the cast.
"Prima donnas are definitely a problem,"
Lowenhar said.
Personality also becomes a factor, as the di
rectors realize they will spend the greater part
of the quarter with these people.
"If there was a crucial solo part we needed
to fill, we might put up with more personality
problems, but with an ensemble cast like this,
we don't have to," said vocal director Anne
Bracy.
The two-hour audition allows each direct
ing team (vocal, dance and acting) to have its
way with a small group of fresh meat. The stu
dents sing a prepared song of their choice;
show tunes are always popular, but many opt
for TV themes, from"The Facts of Life" to
"The Brady Bunch."
The dance segment involves 45 minutes of
learning and then a showcase in front of an en
ergetic, cat-calling staff.
Finally, the auditionees read lines while
they are bombarded with direction, including
requests for various accents (Valley girls and
surfer dudes) and impersonations of Tori
Spelling, construction workers, Woody Allen,
cowboys on a ranch, Humphrey Bogart, crea
tures of the night, space aliens and circus
clowns.
On rare occasions, the production staff
might exploit an auditionee for entertainment
purposes, but only after seven straight hours
of auditions.
For instance, when Lowenhar finds out that
two of the auditionees have recently ended a
romantic relationship, she immediately orders
them to act out a passionate love scene.

"I didn't know!" Desmon wails apologeti
cally to anyone who will listen.
Apart from the extravagant audition
process, some say the whole essence of Gaieties
goes beyond conventional theater and more
closely resembles some kind of huge pep rally.
"Gaieties is a product of Stanford," said
head writer Victor Wishna, a senior. "It's writ
ten by students to be performed for three days
at Stanford and then never again. It's really a
snapshot of our school at the particular time
the show goes up."
One example of a current campus issue re
flected in this year's script is the recent Univer
sity crackdown on fraternities, a subject which
Desmon reveals is central to the play.
"Basically, the writers have not done their
jobs if anyone goes home from watching Gai
eties without seeing something of their own
lives in it," said Wishna.
"I'or two hours, everyone in Memorial Au
ditorium gets to join in one big inside joke that
we all get, and it's like a group of friends sitting
around laughing. There is definitely a unifying
factor to the show."
The creators of Gaieties also like to view it
as a service to the Stanford community, like a
gift of school spirit in preparation for Big
Game.
"Gaieties is not for the theater crowd,"
Desmon said. "It's for the frosh, for the apa
thetic senior, the overzealous RA, the junior
CS major, the frat bovs and Greek

girls. Some
times Stan
ford students
just need to
kick back and
scream, and

Gaieties is the time for that."
Freshman Matt Merrill doesn't appear to
be your average drama freak. An athlete in
high school, Merrill was all set to walk onto the
wrestling team here when he decided instead
to try out for Gaieties and join the Band.
At last month's auditions, he found that the
student directors put his nervousness at ease.
"I made a lot of trips to the bathroom,"
Merrill said. "But once I got out thereon stage,
it was easy and super fun. The dancing part
was hilarious; 1 felt like a sixth-grade girl in the
school talent show."
Sophomore Jenny Moon, a returning actor
from last year's show, compared her Gaieties
audition to one in the Drama Department.
"This is a totally different experience,"
Moon said. "You know the directors are hav
ing a good time out there even though they
have been sitting there for hours listening to
the same jokes, so you can have fun, too."
As they left the auditorium that day, the re
actions of the people who auditioned varied
from an ecstatic, "That was the best audition
I've ever had!" to an exhausted, "1 didn't pass
out."
The 30 or so bright-eyed actors who would
later discover their names on the final cast list
are today less than a week from their first per-

formance. As opening
night nears, a few of
those once-audition- J

ees were revisited to see how the how the last
six weeks have treated them.
"Oh my gosh, it's been so wonderful,
Tipermas gushed. She was cast in one of the
eight principle character roles. "Usually when
freshmen join an activity, they enter at thi
lowest rung, but at Gaieties 1 felt important
and respected as an equal."
She has also come to appreciate the signifi
cance of Gaieties to the student body.
"It's very much a celebration of Stanford,"
said Tipermas. "It's so inclusive because all the
jokes are about us."
Merrill, who also plays a main character,
constructed this metaphor to describe his (iai
eties experience: "It's like being in a barrel full
of monkeys, but every monkey is singing and
dancing and pretending to be Gerhard
Gasper."
