## 'Mad' About the Mob How Larry Bishop got Hollywood royalty, past and present, to appear in his first movie 
### Devin Oatway 
"Mad I )og Time," a wacky mobster movie,
follows tho path ol an array ot diverse charac
ters played by familiar faces, lust to name a few
of the players: Richard Drevfuss, I lien Barkin,
Jeff Cioldblum, Paul Anka, Gregory Mines,
Billv Idol, Rob Reiner and Richard Pryor; they
all grace the screen with their presence.
And yet this star-studded film was written
and directed by I.arry Bishop, who has never
directed a film before. Then how, without a hit
film to brag about or a bathtub full ot Oscars,
did he pull together such an incredible cast ol
celebrities?
I ask myself that question as 1 make my way
to San 1 rancisco to meet him, hoping thai I
can somehow discover what it is about Bishop
that attracted the interest of so many stars.
Bishop was already interesting even before
he was born. His father is Joey Bishop, who
joined such legends as Frank Sinatra, Sammy
Davis Jr., Dean Martin and Peter Lawford in
the fabled "Rat Pack' ofthe 1950 sand 19605.
lust by looking at Bishop, anyone would
probably see their influence on him. He wears
jeans, black leather cowboy boots and a black
leather jacket. He smokes cigarette after ciga
rette and walks with the cool swagger of a rock
star. The word "cool" kept reverberating in my
head.

When speaking about Martin, a small grin
spread across Bishop's face. Martin himself
seemed to appear there on the sidewalk of
Market Street for a half-second.
"Dean was really cool. He was about as cool
a person as you ever saw in your entire life,"
Bishop said.
Not able to thinkol anythingelse to say, just
one word dribbled out of my mouth:
"Cool."
Really enjoying this, Bishop continued:
"He didn't seem to give a f—k about any
thing."
When 1 asked him about Sinatra, a spark of
nostalgia flared up in Bishop's eyes.
"I admired Sinatra. 1 got a real perspective
on what power really was," Bishop said.
"There was nothing that wasn't possible for
him, that's how his brain worked. The word
impossible'was not in his vocabulary, it influ
enced me quite a bit."
Even in school, Bishop found himself sur
rounded by future stars. Two of his buddies

from high school are director Reiner and
Academy Award-winner Dreyfuss, both of
whom have roles in "Mad Dog Time." So with
a glance at Bishop's far from modest back
ground, his success at rounding up stars seems
less puzzling.

"It was compelling," Goldblum said,
"funny and suspenseful and kind of cosmic.

very alluring — elegant, sophisticated and
dangerous."
One of the characters in this "alluring"
world is Ben London (Gabriel Byrne) — a
power-hungry mobster who sometimes
speaks in riddles and rhymes.
"1 started to read the script and began
laughing uncontrollably," Byrne said. "I just
enjoyed it immensely from start to finish —
not just my own character but every other
part, as well. There was a wicked kind of hu
manity to all of them."
What probably attracted such stars as
Goldblum and Byrne is that "Mad Dog
Time" is a mobster movie with a twist.
There are many violent deaths and a tew
passionate affairs, but what is different is
that there is a kind of philosophical subtext.
In the context of the film, everything
seems to have some sort of significance,

most of all death. Byrne's and Goldblum's
characters share the same mantra: "I judge a
man's life by the way he dies." In "Mad Dog
Time," death is about definition.
"1 began to see grace and God as two sep
arate entities," Bishop said. "So what hap
pens if they stop talking to each other?
"Then I began to see God as a boyfriend
and grace as His girlfriend. They have a
falling out, and ... so I was just playing
around with those concepts and that's how
everything really began."
In "Mad Dog Time," God is an insane
mobster boss, Vic (Dreyfuss), and grace is
a beautiful woman, aptly named Grace
(Diane l.ane).
The way Bishop went about casting and
then making the film was as unconvention
al as his script. He cast Goldblum in a some
what casual way.
"Originally I offered him the Ben Lon
don part.... He read the script and he loved
it, but then he came to me and told me, '1 re
ally see myself as Mickey Holiday,' and so I

said, 'If you see yourself as Mick, you got it.'
It was that easy."
In the film, one of the themes is a choice
Vic has between grace (I.ane), conscience
(Goldblum) or evil (Bishop). Since Vic is a
gangster, this choice becomes a question of
who he will knock off. The answer is unpre
dictable since Vic is schizophrenic; this cre
ates a tense situation for the possible vic
tims.
There's also a fair share of interesting plot
points in the movie, involving Mick's girl
friend Rita (Barkin). After Rita discovers
that Mick has been sleeping with her sister
Grace during the day, she goes a little crazy
and threatens to kill Mick, then Vic and then
herself. She does none of these but instead
bursts into tears and leaves.
"Too much sense of morality can drive
you a little bit nuts," Bishop said. Bishop
wrote this in on the last day of filming and
he admits that "she steals the scene."
In "Mad Dog Time," Bishop strives to ac
complish a healthy mix of the sex and shal

low violence in the mobster film genre and
the philosophical message of a (ireek
tragedy.
Bishop's film is not only a mobster film;
there are many different layers of signifi
cance there's even a hidden meaning to the
film's title. "Mad Hog Time" is an anagram
that also spells "(iod Dam Time.' I his ana
gram is not onK a theme in the film, but also
contains personal significance lor the film
makers.
"In high school, larr\. Rob and myself
shared a belief that we were going to prevail
in this world, and we were well known tor
this pursuit, this hunger,' Preytuss said.
"We always believed in each other and our
selves. For me, this film represents coming
full circle. It's being able to sav that what we
said and thought was real and true
But while Dreyfuss and Reiner found
success decades ago, it took 30 \ears for
Bishop to "come full circle." So the anagram
of "Mad Hog Time" really is an appropriate
title for his first movie. It is goddamn time!
