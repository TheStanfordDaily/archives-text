## 'Mad' About the Mob How Larry Bishop got Hollywood royalty, past and present, to appear in his first movie 
### Devin Oatway 
"Mad I )og Time," a wacky mobster movie,
follows tho path ol an array ot diverse charac
ters played by familiar faces, lust to name a few
of the players: Richard Drevfuss, I lien Barkin,
Jeff Cioldblum, Paul Anka, Gregory Mines,
Billv Idol, Rob Reiner and Richard Pryor; they
all grace the screen with their presence.
And yet this star-studded film was written
and directed by I.arry Bishop, who has never
directed a film before. Then how, without a hit
film to brag about or a bathtub full ot Oscars,
did he pull together such an incredible cast ol
celebrities?
I ask myself that question as 1 make my way
to San 1 rancisco to meet him, hoping thai I
can somehow discover what it is about Bishop
that attracted the interest of so many stars.
Bishop was already interesting even before
he was born. His father is Joey Bishop, who
joined such legends as Frank Sinatra, Sammy
Davis Jr., Dean Martin and Peter Lawford in
the fabled "Rat Pack' ofthe 1950 sand 19605.
lust by looking at Bishop, anyone would
probably see their influence on him. He wears
jeans, black leather cowboy boots and a black
leather jacket. He smokes cigarette after ciga
rette and walks with the cool swagger of a rock
star. The word "cool" kept reverberating in my
head.

When speaking about Martin, a small grin
spread across Bishop's face. Martin himself
seemed to appear there on the sidewalk of
Market Street for a half-second.
"Dean was really cool. He was about as cool
a person as you ever saw in your entire life,"
Bishop said.
Not able to thinkol anythingelse to say, just
one word dribbled out of my mouth:
"Cool."
Really enjoying this, Bishop continued:
"He didn't seem to give a fâ€”k about any
thing."
When 1 asked him about Sinatra, a spark of
nostalgia flared up in Bishop's eyes.
"I admired Sinatra. 1 got a real perspective
on what power really was," Bishop said.
"There was nothing that wasn't possible for
him, that's how his brain worked. The word
impossible'was not in his vocabulary, it influ
enced me quite a bit."
Even in school, Bishop found himself sur
rounded by future stars. Two of his buddies

What probably attracted such
stars as Goloblum and Byrne
is that 'Mad Dog Time' is a
mobster movie with a twist.
There are many violent deaths
and a few passionate affairs,
but what is different is that
there is a kind of
philosophical subtext.

from high school are director Reiner and
Academy Award-winner Dreyfuss, both of
whom have roles in "Mad Dog Time." So with
a glance at Bishop's far from modest back
ground, his success at rounding up stars seems
less puzzling.
but even more than Bishop's background,
his screenplay played the key role in enticing so

many famous personalities. Goldblum, for in
stance, was attracted to the film from the mo
ment he first read the script.
"It was compelling," Goldblum said,
"funny and suspenseful and kind of cosmic.
The mythical world Bishop created seemed

The stars come out to play, clockwise from top: Jeff Goldblum (Mick) and Richard Dreyfuss (Vic) kept their heights for director Larry Bishop. Angie Everhart (Gabrielle) medi
tates on Kant's theories on pragmatism while holding Bishop (Nick) against her. Kyle MacLachlan (Jake) and Gregory Hines (Jules) wonder where their careers went. Paul Anka
(Danny) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben) show they're real men by holding big phallic symbols.
