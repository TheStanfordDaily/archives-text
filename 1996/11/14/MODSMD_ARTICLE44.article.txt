## Gender Bender Shakespeare crosses genders and centuries in time for the 'Night' 
### 
"Twelfth Night" is a frothy revamp of
Shakespeare's comedy about gender-reversal
and love. The film showcases a delightful cast
in 189()s dress and a luminous countryside of
cliffs and castles in the slow burn of fall. The
complex plot winds through mistaken iden
tities, sub rosa passions and comedic ex
changes between the servants and the nobili
ty of the two households that the story re
volves around.
The film begins with the shipwreck of the
boat carrying twins Viola (Imogen Stubbs)
and Sebastian (Steven Mackintosh) off the
coast of Mlyria, a Active country combining
Italianate nomenclature with an English class
structure. Viola alone is washed up onto the
shores of Illyria and believes that her brother
has perished.
To survive, the plucky girl shingles her
hair into a boyish bob and remakes herself in
the role of Cesario. Suitably disguised in her
brother's military uniform she joins the
court of the Duke Orsino (Toby Stephens),
who lounges about on chaise lounges and en
tertains a passion for Olivia (Helena Bonham
Carter), countess of the castle next door.
Olivia is in mourning for her brother and
father, who died recently. In homage to their
memory, she has sworn off men for the next
seven years, hiding behind a voluminous

black veil in the deep recesses of her castle.
Before long, Orsino dispatches Cesario to
win Olivia's favor on his behalf. Olivia is un
touched by the Duke's overblown professions
of love, but finds (lesario's fresh and awkward
graces most pleasant. Olivia sets about at
tracting Cesario, who is herself slowly falling
in love with Orsino. This complicated trian
gle is further confused by Sebastian's reintro
duction to the story.
This tangle of passions is interwoven with
a play for power and love enfolding in
Olivia's household. The crotchety steward
Malvolio (Nigel Hawthorne) is besotted by
Olivia but frowns on the boisterous behavior
of her uncle Toby (Mel Smith) and Toby's
wretched sidekick Andrew (Richard E.
Grant). The two cruelly encourage Malvo
lio's feelings with the help of Olivia's maid
Maria (Imelda Staunton), who is herself in
love with Toby.
Cutting through both levels of narrative
and unbound by passion is Teste the Fool,
played with immense skill by Ben Kingsley.
Feste, by turns exuberant and somber, sees all
and sings his knowledge in the ballads that
bookend the story.
The story hits a few snags in its reproduc
tion of the Shakespearean argot and its some
times facile gloss over conflicts. Still, the
story never loses its momentum and remains
a refreshingly entertaining romantic comedy.

abella Ingrid-is-my-mother Rossellini. You gotta respect her for that.
