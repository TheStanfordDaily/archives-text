## Shock Therapy Folk-singing favorite Michelle Shocked simultaneously releases two wildly different albums "Mercury Poise" "Kind Hearted Woman" 
### 
One artist releasing two very unrelated
albums simultaneously is certainly not the
result of anybody's marketing savvy. The
good news is that no one is going to get fired
for timing the delivery of "Kind Hearted
Woman" (Private Music) alongside "Mer
cury Poise: 1988-1995" (Mercury Records)
— the complication arises from a protract
ed legal entanglement that ultimately wed
Michelle Shocked with two labels.
For devout Shocked followers, the releas
es of "Kind Hearted Woman" and "Mercury
Poise: 1988-1995" offer a tantalizing duo of
listening enjoyment. "Mercury Poise" is
Michelle Shocked's first "Best of," pulling to
gether some of the folk singer's most memo
rable ditties. Yet the upbeat quality on "Mer
cury Poise" is quite alien to Shocked's dark
sentiments on "Kind Hearted Woman," an
opus that goes down like a searing chug of
melancholy venom.
Ultimately, this schizophrenia may create
ripples of flabby disinterest. The reason is
that "Kind I learted Woman" erupts onto the
Shocked's past lands of upbeat enthusiasm
with a dark and brooding lava, one that hard
ens the very core of Shocked's once-enthusi

astic outlook.
With a chilly and depressing passion,
Shocked resolutely rejects lighter hues on
"Kind 1 learted Woman." A series of gray bal
lads that outline the grim realities of rural
life, the album boldly delves the bleak cellar
of humanity, with or without public ap
proval.
Opening the slow churn of "Kind Hearted
Woman" is "Stillborn," which delivers the
pain of a mother giving birth to a dead baby.
Rife with gross wails and haunting imagery,
this solemn hymn is quite a jagged pill, even
for long-standing Shocked supporters. Iron
ically, the song appears in opposite locations
on both albums, closing the curtain on
"Mercury Poise."
"Stillborn" raises questions about
Shockcd's musical sanity and seems to pro
ject a rocky outline of what may lay ahead.
Yet Shocked's charisma shines soon after, and
it suddenly becomes clear that "Kind Heart
ed Woman" is not a pussyfooting album by
any means.
"Cold Comfort," rich with folksy nostal
gia, displays Shocked's homespun realism as
she describes a situation of isolation and de
spair. "Homestead," another melancholy
one-act, captures the loneliness of the mid
dle-aged widow, searching for meaning
amidst solemnity.
"Kind Hearted Woman" does have its
brighter shades. "Fddie" is a nostalgic and
upbeat chronicle of a zany country boy. And
"Silver Spoon" shows that there is healing:
"Love is a falling rain, washing away the hurt
and pain and pretty soon I'm catching the
drops in my silver spoon."
It seems that the best albums are the most

easy to listen to, drive to, make love to. "Mer
cury Poise: 1988-1995" is simply an enjoy
able listen, a wonderful splash of Shocked
nostalgia that elevates the mood. What made
Shocked so fun is captured, as the album
spews with jazzy riffs, a cappclla spice and
folksy East Texas jamming. Shocked fans will
once again be able to sing along to "Anchor
age," and for those new to Shocked's style,
"Mercury Poise" may be the best starting
point.
On the heels of her tiring legal battle with
former label Mercury Records, "Kind

I learted Woman" follows a four-year lull in
Shocked's career. Perhaps her recent release
captures some of the anger and frustration
that has surfaced in this hiatus.
"These are stories I need to tell, songs I
very much need to sing," the songstress has
explained. "Kind Hearted" conveys this ur
gency, as ragged and unrefined as it may be.
Yet "Mercury Poise: 1988-1995" is the
Michelle Shocked that most of us want, no
matter how distant that version of her may
be.
