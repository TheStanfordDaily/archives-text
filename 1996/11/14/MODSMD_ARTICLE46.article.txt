# DARLAHOOD
## "Big Fine Thing" 
### 
Darla-who? The three-man hand formed
a few years ago when guitarist-vocalist Luke
Janklow heard from a friend, Matt Chamber
lain, drummer for the New Bohemians, Pearl
Jam and Wallflowers, about a new up-and
coming drummer named Joe Magistro.
The two started playing together and
eventually found bassist David Sellar to com
plete the group. This year, the three secluded
themselved in a decaying, upstate New York
mansion to write songs, make demos, play
occasional live shows and record their first
album, "Big Fine Thing." (Reprise Records)
The album producers, Clive hanger and
Alan Winstanley, have worked together pre
viously to bring the music of such
singers / groups as Bush, Elvis Costello and

Madness.
Calling their music a combination of
"sexy melodic tunes, dark psychedelic guitar
and chunky, bottom-end grooves," Darla
hood bears faint resemblance to Urge
Overkill, Dishwalla and Gin Blossoms. It fol
lows the pattern of all the other recent, regur
gitated MTV alternative music bands with its
long guitar riffs, gravelly sound and repeti
tive lines. I can just imagine their slightly out
of-focus video with the trio raging on their
instruments and pans on the walls of a room.
Darlahood does redeem itself, however,
with a smooth cohesion of voice, guitars and
percussion, not to mention the guys' endear
ing belief in their music, as expressed on their
Web page.
"Being in a band with these guys is the best
job 1 could ever imagine," Janklow said.
"What could be better than playing music?
I'm sick of the whining that's been going on
in the rock scene for the past few years."
The fifth track, "Runaway Clocks," takes
off from the rest of the album's pounding

beat and harsh edges, unfolding a slightly
mellowed side; Janklow softly breathes over
lines like "your barefoot memories will turn
on you."
If Darlahood can find its own style and
take advantage of the members' separate tal
ents, it may become a new force in alternative
music. For now, this first album is satisfacto
ry, but they have a way to go before becoming
the sort of band that, in Janklow's words, "If
I wasn't in [it], I'd be jealous of it."
