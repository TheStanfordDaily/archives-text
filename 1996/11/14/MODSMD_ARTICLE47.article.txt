# CHUBBY CARRIER "Who Stole the Hot Sauce?"
## 
### 
Although the name may fool you, this
Chubbv ain't doing the twist. In a jazzy blues

based, zydeco flurry of accordion and drums,
Chubby Carrier and the Bayou Swamp band
have answered their own question, "Who
Stole the Hot Sauce?" (Blind Pig Records).
They did. And believe me, the accordion has
never had this much swing.
Straight out of Louisiana, this zydeco
blues band stirs up the sauce with plenty of
Cajun spice, doing covers of songs ranging
from"The Cisco Kid" by War to The Who's
"Squeeze Box," as well as playing some of
their own. Balancing Carrier'., accordion riffs
with a swing beat, jazzy bass and bold guitar
solos, the band have developed a sound that
puts you right in the middle of Mardi Gras.
The title song, "Who Stole the Hot
Sauce?," gives the album its initial momen
tum with a jazzy beat and grooving bass line.
I dare anyone to listen to this song and keep
from dancing.
Carrier continues to dole out the hot sauce
on "Luziana Feelin'," an instrumental num
ber in which he further shows off his accor
dion skills, interjecting an occasional outcrv

of "zydeco!" and "bayou swamp!" among the
guitar riffs and driving drums. Without
lyrics, he tells us he's having the time of his
life and wants us to join in.
Even amid this foray of fun music, though,
Carrier finds a way to make us sway with a
slow, soulful song. "Hard to Believe" sounds
like a rhythm and blues folk song with an ac
cordion backup. The effect is tranquilizing
and extremely soothing, like the slow song at
a dance that lets you c?.tch your breath be
tween rampant limb flailing.
The next song on the album, "Zydeco sont
pas sale," is entirely in French but is repetitive
and easy to pick up, even if you don't know
what the lyrics mean. Even if you do know
what they mean, the song probably won't
make a whole lot of sense (the title translated
literally is "Zydeco are not dirty" — nice to
know, eh?). So just take this one as is, as you
would, say, Richie Valens' "La Bamba."
Though most of the songs on the album
are covers, Carrier and crew modify them to
fit their own style. "Rockin' in the Cradle of
the South" is an anthem of Southern
Louisiana pride that pounds out a driving
beat that makes the hips swing and the feet
burn with excitement.

Basically, the message behind the album is
simple. This is Creole music. This is Zydeco
music. This is fun stuff.
