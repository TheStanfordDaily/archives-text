## RUSTED ROOT "Remember" 
### 
Maybe 1 just never really listened to a Rust
ed Root album before. Maybe I identify Rust
ed Root with upbeat songs like "Send Me On
My Way." Hut what I learned upon devoting
my full attention to Root's new album, "Re
member," (Mercury Records) is that their
"power ballads" are pathetically powerless.
However, when Rusted Root sticks to what
they do best, that fast-paced transcendent
tribal sound, they can really jam.
The eclectic style of Rusted Root is at once

spiritual and evoca
tive of contemporary
pop culture. If you
listen very closely, the
voice of Michael
Glabicki (lead vocal
ist) uncannily sug
ge ' F.ddie Vedder
meets David Byrne
(although the falset
tos suggest a small
pubescent male). Lis
ten to "Heaven" and
tell me I'm not close.
One of the
strongest songs, "Vir
tual Reality," ex
plodes with the vi
vacity typical of Rust
ed Root. I've had the
fortune to hear it
done in Root's fa
vorite medium, t he
live arena, and it's
fun. This song has all
the characteristics of
a good Rusted Root
tune: upbeat tempo,

crazy vocals, nonsense lyrics, diverse percus
sion and a wacky melody.
Unfortunately, most of this album is not
the most flattering style for Rusted Root.
Their attempt at slower-paced, "deep" songs
are difficult to take seriously due toGlabicki's
fluctuating Eddie / David warble.
Also, I wondered if the lyrics were a joke.
In "Sister Contine" the band is asking us to
"Hail for the king is here yes to pull the salt
from your tears and into your manic eye the
desert sand stone does fly." To quote the song
again, 1 "believe I been so getting tired" of
this pathetic attempt at poetic profundity.
"Dangle" is a perfect showcase for Rusted
Root's forte. The song begins with the tired
beat of another heavy ballad, but once the
band gets in the groove, they pick up the pace
and save the song from the seemingly in
evitable fate of the Fast Forward button.
Backup vocals by Liz Berlin really add anoth
er dimension to this tune.
Now that I've painted such a bleak picture
of Rusted Root's latest attempt at musical ex
pression, let me help redeem their incredible
musical talent: The band is playing at the
Berkeley Community Theater on Tuesday. I
can assure you that a live performance by
Rusted Root would definitely compensate for
any deficiencies in their latest studio record
ing.
