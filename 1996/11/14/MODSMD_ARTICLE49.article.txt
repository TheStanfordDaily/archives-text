# RAILROAD JERK
## "The Third Rail" 
### 
"Please mention my name. I would really
appreciate it."
These opening lines of "Clean Shirt," the
first song on Railroad lerk's new album "The
Third Rail (Matador Records), make a plea
for attention that sum up what the CD is
about.
However, these tedious melodies and fool
ish lyrics do nothing to encourage you to lis
ten to their CD, much less mention their

name.
Though this mix of folk, blues, country,
rock and mainstream pop punk makes a cu
rious blend of styles, the product is odd,
clumsy and, still, unoriginal. Their music is
the kind that could be found in any bar on a
Friday night.
Formed in 1989 by guitarist and vocalist
Hall and bassist Tony Fee, the band began
playing together in Manhattan. Their self-ti
tled debut album came out in 1990. Now six
years later, and on their third guitarist, Alec
Stephen, and their third drummer, Dave
Varcnka, the band still sounds more like an
unpolished garage band who have been play -
ing for only a few months. Most songs are
slowly led in by the guitarist, and each instru
ment joins in, with the vocals coming last.
The band's lyrics are anything but poetic.
The words seem to be reaching to make
themselves sound original and cool, like al
most every other new pop band out. Railroad
Jerk sound as though when they were coming
up with the lyrics and they found a word, anv
word, to closely rhyme with the last, the\ de
cided to use it — no matter how ridiculous it
sounded.
Marcellus Halls' whining and sometimes
screeching vocals sing mostly about love and
sex and the lack thereof in lines like "You al
ways stand by me, won't you objectify me, or
"Natalie, Natalie, 1 wanna see your anatomy."
Sometimes the lyrics are so absurd that
they're somewhat entertaining. Such creativ
ity is seen in the song "Sweet Fibrarian"
which is about a boy trying to catch the at
tention of the librarian.
In their song, "You Forgot" Hall croons
"We had sex at Tower Records." At the rate
they're going, this might be their greatest suc
cess in Tower Records.
