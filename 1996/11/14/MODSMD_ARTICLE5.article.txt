# Wais releases LGB memo
## Campus groups also submit plans 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Dean of Students Marc Wais has
released a memorandum address
ing concerns initially brought up in
the report by the Working Group
on Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Stu
dent Needs.
The March 1995 report empha
sized many needs for the lesbian,
gay and bisexual community at
Stanford, including an official com
munity center director; more acad
emic role models; the integration of
lesbian, gay and bisexual studies
into the University curriculum; en
couragement of a healthy social and
academic environment; and open
mindedness toward homosexuals
on campus.
Last January, Wais released his
initial response to the report. The
Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Gom
munity Center then requested

more information
on what was being
done to imple
ment the report's
suggestions â€”
particularly what
different depart
ments were doing
to address the
community's is
sues.

Wais' Oct. 31 memo is in re
sponse to those concerns.
"I hope [the memo] indicates to
the community that the University
takes the working report serious
ly," Wais said yesterday, adding
that he hopes the efforts of the Uni
versity will "minimize or eliminate
any kind of discrimination based on
sexual orientation."
Wais said he spent the summer
Catherine information from differ


Wais
ent organizations and departments
on campus.
The memo included submis
sions from Residential Education,
the Career Planning and Place
ment Center, the Undergraduate
Advising Center, the Department
of Athletics, the Asian American
Activities Center, El Centro Chi
cano and the American Indian Pro
gram Office.
The memo said Res Ed has been
and will be open to moving students
who express discomfort in having a
roommate of different sexual orien
tation to a different residence. Res
ident assistants must also attend
mandatory panel discussions led by
"diverse students."
"Residential Education and
graduate residences are committed
to serving the LGB community in
the same way that they are com
mitted to serving all students at
Stanford in the residences," the
memo said.
The CPPC said employers who
wish to use the CPPC's services
must sign a form saying they will
not discriminate on sexual orienta
tion. The U.S. Armed Forces has
also signed this form despite its
past history in discriminating
against homosexuals.
"The University does not intend
to change the CPPC policy so as to
prohibit U.S. military recruiting at
the CPPC," the memo said.
Staff at the Undergraduate Ad
vising Center said they are willing
to send to freshmen advisers a list
of faculty and staff who are open to
discussing lesbian, gay and bisexu
al issues with students.
Representatives from the Ath
letics Department said they have
been working to "address problems
arising from homophobia, discrim
ination, harassment or violence,"

according to the memo.
"We feel good about our position
when it comes to these issues," said
Senior Assoc. Athletic Director
Cheryl Levick, who has been active
in promoting quarterly workshops
for the Athletics Department on
professional development.
Levick said, however, that the
programs were not necessarily
spawned by the working group's re
port.
"We try to view this as an ongo
ing process," she said.
According to the memo, the eth
nic centers have also made an at
tempt to address lesbian, gay and
bisexual issues. The Asian Ameri
can Activities Center hosted sever
al representatives from the lesbian,
gay and bisexual community last
May.
In addition, the group co-spon
sored a course last spring titled
"Asian / Pacific Islander Women:
Contemporary Issues" which ad
dressed lesbianism, among other
topics.
El Centro Chicano has also ex
tended its support to Familia, a
Chicano / Latino lesbian, gay
and bisexual organization on
campus.
The American Indian Program
Office currently has plans to incor
porate lesbian, gay and bisexual is
sues into the training of its profes
sional staff and student employ
ees.
Wais recommended that mem
bers of the lesbian, gay and bisex
ual community form a dean's ad
visory board, either as a part of
the center's existing advisory
board or a new board, to meet with
him regularly and discuss the
University's progress on address
ing the recommendations of the
initial report.
He said he plans to hold anoth
er town hall meeting with members
of the center in order to continue
the dialogue on these and related is
sues.
