# SITTING ROOM
## "The Last Place That You'll Look" 
### 
"The Last Place That You'll Look" is a tair
to-good effort by Sitting Room, showing
flashes of greatness. It is clear that this group,
whose guitarist is Stanford sophomore
Danny Geyser, has the tools to become a solid
band, but they are a few steps away from
being ready for a big-label contract. Ihe
music is conceptually innovative and displays
a healthy range of musical styles without
being schizophrenic. Acoustic ballads and
heavier songs arc handled with equal apti
tude.
Don't let their straight-forward sound be
mistaken for musical simplicity, for the
sound is full and fluid. Geyser's guitar is a
high point of the album. His riffs are clean
and creative, adding to the sound without
overpowering it or distracting from the mes
sages of the songs.
The album's two best songs, "Need,' sung
by Kyle Muench and "Alone," sung by Re
bekah Hodgson, are both on the heavy side
and are polished enough for radio play.
"Alone" is Hodgson's vocal diamond in an
album of rough.

Hodgson's mood tails nicely between the
carefree Natalie Merchant sound and the
vengeful moanings of Courtney Love and
Alanis Morissette. She several times displays
the capacity to sound great hut persists in
bringing the sound from her throat.
After six tracks of the aforementioned
throatiness, Muench takes the lead vocals for
a few tunes. I lis Bryan Adams-esque sound is
refreshing as he handles both ballads and
harder pieces with sensitivity, strength and
passion. Hodgson's background vocals on
these pieces are also strong and the album
seems to find itself through his assertiveness.
Seemingly gaining confidence, Hodgson re
turns for the final three tracks.
Thematically, the lyrics alternate between
a yearning for relational security and reflec
tions on blissful memories. The greatest
memory is a thoughtful tribute, "Oh to
Linda." Hodgson becomes a protagonist ot
sorts as the album moves along, and by the
end, one is left truly hoping that she is able to
find the love that will return her to the happy
moments of which she sings. Although the
emotions are pure and thoughtful, they are
conveyed in a cliche manner that can be im
proved with more song-writing experience.
Muench's lyrics ("Need," "Come Back
Down" and"The Flame") are excellent in
painting pictures, but assume a presumptu
ous air. They teach lessons to the audience
and are peppered with Muench's own wis
dom: "1 hope you know..("Need"), "You
may not yet know ..." and"It takes time I
know ..." (Come Back Down), "I know
where to turn ..("The Flame"). 1 lowever,
the earnestness of his voice overcomes the
continuous condescension of his lyrics.
" rhi.' l ast Place That You'll Look" displays
Sitting Room's tremendous potential. They
should not be surprised to experience in
creasing success.
