## "The Last Place That You'll Look" 
### 
"The Last Place That You'll Look" is a tair
to-good effort by Sitting Room, showing
flashes of greatness. It is clear that this group,
whose guitarist is Stanford sophomore
Danny Geyser, has the tools to become a solid
band, but they are a few steps away from
being ready for a big-label contract. Ihe
music is conceptually innovative and displays
a healthy range of musical styles without
being schizophrenic. Acoustic ballads and
heavier songs arc handled with equal apti
tude.
Don't let their straight-forward sound be
mistaken for musical simplicity, for the
sound is full and fluid. Geyser's guitar is a
high point of the album. His riffs are clean
and creative, adding to the sound without
overpowering it or distracting from the mes
sages of the songs.
The album's two best songs, "Need,' sung
by Kyle Muench and "Alone," sung by Re
bekah Hodgson, are both on the heavy side
and are polished enough for radio play.
"Alone" is Hodgson's vocal diamond in an
album of rough.
