## "Best Of, Volume I" 
### 
Circa test hits albums
arc typically difficult to
promote. How can a
group excite the public
when their glory days
are behind them?
Van Halen has
found the perfect solu
tion, at least from a
cynical perspective.
Why not fire your lead
singer, bring back your
first singer (beloved by
your original fans) and
then finish the soap
opera by dismissing
him as well?
liver since the mys
terious departure earli
er this year of Sammy
Hagar, who felt that

they were not a "greatest hits band," Van
Halen's fans have been teased with the return
of the band's original lead singer, David Lee
Roth.
After returning to record two new songs for
"Best Of, Volume L" (Warner Brothers) Roth
quickly antagonized his bandmates enough for
them to give him the final shove. However,
what every first generation Van Halen fan has
dreamed of for years is now finally available:
new tracks with Roth.
Of the two, "Can't Cet This StuffNo More"
is the superior, recalling the band's original
sound not only with Roth's voice, but with the
commanding presence of Eddie's guitar, the
essential strength of the band. Roth, however,
Hashes his old strengths as well, a muscular, if
limited, tunefulness and a sharp wit: "That's
the thing about self-improvement/ Don't get
me wrong, I plan to get some soon."
The other track, "Me Wise Magic," is a curi
ous mix of demonic lead vocals and bright
choruses. If the band is trying to bridge its two
eras, the chasm proves to be too wide.
As for the rest of the album, it's a strange as
sortment of "hits." Three of their best-known
songs, "You Really Cot Me," "Hot For Teacher"
and "Love Walks In" are all excluded for tracks
as unimpressive as "And The CCradle Will Rock..."
and "Poundcake." Unless they're serious about
the "Volume I" part of the title, perhaps Van
Halen was looking for some of the integrity
Hagar questioned by resisting a greatest hits
album itself while he was still part of the group.
Indeed, integrity is now strangely enough a
real issue for the band. Having almost con
firmed their next lead singer, Gary Cherone,
formerly of Extreme, the band needs to prove
themselves once more.
The ironic part is that as the last important
band from their era, they arc now the elder
statesmen of a dying genre, making their every
move both crucial and irrelevant. A striking
parallel can now be drawn between the Rolling
Stones and Van Halen. Both groups started as
musical revolutionaries, released era-defining
music, suffered membership changes and then

retreated into pop professionalism.
lust as the Stones endure as the last produc
tive element of the original British Invasion,
Van Halen has now become the last significant
American band from the pop-metal era.
Can't get this stuff no more indeed.
