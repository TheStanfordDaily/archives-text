## "Sinsation" 
### 
Oh no, not another angry synth-metal in
dustrial album. Isn't enough enough? The pop
music world is about to put its foot down. Nine
Inch Nails we could handle. Trent Re/nor has
something for everyone: Head Like A Hole,
Closer, Hurt, etc., etc. But then what happens?
112 ilter releases a pathetically loud and talentless
album. Trent Reznor's Nothing label pushes
creepy, gothic, shock-value tour-openers Mari
lyn Manson onto commercial alternative radio.
Let the true industrial fans step forward. For
those of you who have enjoyed the sounds of
KMFDM, Type O Negative, Reznor's remix al
bums or perhaps Die Krupps, you arc probably
familiar with Pig.
When listening to "Sinsation," one encoun
ters unholy chants, symphonic melodies,
grinding voice samples, manic drum ma
chines, distorted morbid choruses and unpre
dictable dance rhythms.
The album opens with an eerie orchestra
harmony, much like you'd hear upon opening
a crypt within the dungeon of a Transylvanian
mansion at the stroke of midnight. The mood
is disrupted by a ruthless percussion, and the
journey into the dark reaches of writer, pro
ducer and performer Raymond Watts begins.
"Paniac (nothing touches me)" and "Vol
cano" exhibit the best "Sinsation" has to offer;
they're damn good songs. The outstanding
guitar bites on the album are attributed to
Watts and backup players Steve White, Imai

Hisashi and Karl Hyde.
What is lacking in "Sinsation" is the musical
substance required to gel the collage of sounds.
Watts doesn't let his guitar carry the album; he
doesn't use any primary, underlying rhythm.
The unconvincing "Shell" sounds like a
remix of something or other and "Hamstrung
on the Highway" is set back by weak lyrics.
Conversely, "Analgesia" and "Transceration"
are raw, beautiful lyric-free pieces.
It's hard to find the backbone in this album
of catchy beats and obscure samples. Watts rec
ognizes this and doesn't seem to care; he says
that nearly all audiences will find Fig difficult
to listen to. In terms of being accessible to au
diences, there's a fine line between the demon
ic lair of Pig and the morbid antics of Marilyn
Manson. The liner notes of "Sinsation" contain
photographs of swine and humans, including
pictures of a severed pig head and foot, a bare
ass, and stitches along human flesh. It's tough
to distinguish the difference between true ex
pression and just wanting to piss people off and
draw media attention.
Unlike Marilyn Manson, however, Watts is
an artist.
