## "Paganini: Music for Strings and Guitar" 
### 
Niccolo Paganini is well-recognized as an
extraordinary performer and prolific compos
er for the violin. However, Paganini is often
forgotten as an accomplished performer and
composer for the guitar as well. 1 Hiring his life
time, he composed more than a hundred solo
guitar pieces and numerous pieces of chamber
music featuring guitar and various string in
struments. Four of these pieces are showcased
in "Paganini: Music for Strings and Guitars"
(Dorian Recordings) by The Diaz Trio and Ju
lian Gray.
In all of these works, Paganini explores the
many tonal effects provided by these unusual
combinations of instruments. Except in the
Gantabile, where the guitar essentially serves as
accompaniment for the violin, there is relative
equality among instruments, with each instru
ment taking a turn as soloist.
Surprisingly, the most prominent instru
ment in both Quartetto 15 and Terzetto con
certante is the viola, not the violin. In a field
dominated by violins and cellos, it's refreshing
to hear the viola finally get the spotlight, and
Roberto Diaz has no trouble filling the role.
The Diaz Trio and Julian Gray put in ad
mirable performances. Their technique is
sound and their ensemble excellent. Awkward
ness and rhythmic uncertainty occasionally
give a rough sound to the music, but there is
wonderful expressiveness throughout. David
Kim, the violinist of the Diaz Trio, shines beau
tifully in the Gantabile.
The sound quality of the recording is good,
but the reading is so closely miked that one can
almost hear the hair on the performers' bows.
1 lowever, overall, this is a delightful album,
and it is a valuable addition to the many Gl)sof
chamber music on catalog.
