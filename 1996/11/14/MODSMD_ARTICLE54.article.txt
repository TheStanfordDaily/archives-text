# THEATER
## Amore Mio Williams' 'Rose' blossoms at the A.C.T 
### 
"The Rose Tattoo," currently being pro
duced at the American Conservatory The
ater, is in the words of its author Tennessee
Williams, "The Dionysian element in human
life, its mystery, its beauty, its significance."
For Williams, this was his "love play to the
world," blending comedy and tragedy into a
highly amusing and chilling story.
"The Rose Tattoo" arose out of the only
great love in Williams' life and is touched
with an optimism that is rarely seen in any of
his other well-known plays. The main char
acter Serafina (Kathleen Widdoes) is saved,
rather than condemned, by love and the play
ends on a positive note.
The story centers around two things: First,
Serafina delle Rose and her undying devo
tion to her unfaithful husband, a truck driver
killed while smuggling drugs. And second,
Serafina's relationship to her daughter Rosa
( Tina Jones) as Rosa enters into her own sex
uality. Serafina mourns the death of her hus
band, who had a rose tattoo on his breast,
through three years of widowhood, during
which she imposes strict moral values on her
daughter.
Finally, after three years, she is forced to

face the fact of her
husbands infideli
ty. To complicate
things, Rosa meets
a sailor at a high
school dance and
falls madly in love.
Suddenly Serafina
finds herself deal
ing with her daugh
ter's dawning sexu
ality, as well as her
own repression,
when Alvano Man
giacavallo (Marco
Barricelli), a man
bearing a strange
resemblance to her
dead husband, ar-

rives on the scene. Through several comical
scenes, Alvano helps her reclaim her life and
love.
The lyrical tone of the play, while dealing
seriously with Serafina's profound personal
issues, is also extremely funny. Serafina has a
captivating power of wit, carried well by Wid
does. Overall the acting is great, with only a

tew paintul moments to watch. The play is
just plain fun. The set design is beautiful, as
well as the lighting. A.C.T. has done an amaz
ing job staging this rarely staged play.

The A.C.T.'s production of " The Rose Tattoo,'
by Tennessee Williams, runs through Nov. 24
with shows at 8 p.m. Tuesday through Satur

day and 2 p.m. matinees on Wednesday, Satur
day and Sunday at the Geary Theater (415
Cieary St. on the comer of Geary and Mason
streets, San Francisco). Tickets cost $19-
$47.50. For more information, call the A.C.T.
Box Office at 749-2228 or go to any BASS Tick
