# GSB evaluates core curriculum
## 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
In an attempt to address the
changing needs of the business
world, faculty at the Graduate
School of Business are currently re
evaluating the school's core cur
riculum.
Business School Dean Mike
Spence formed a task force last
April to solicit feedback and sugges
tions from the faculty, students and
alumni. Members of the task force
are Business School Profs. David
Baron, Charles Holloway and Mar
garet Neale
According to MBA Program Di
rector George Parker, the evalua
tion differs from previous ones in
its magnitude. Although incremen
tal changes have been made to the
core, this evaluation marks the first
time in the last two decades that the
Business School has examined its
entire core.
Parker identified the "breath
taking advances" in technology, a
more experienced and internation

al student body and a rising interest
in entrepreneurship as the "chang
ing needs" of the Business School.
Under the current structure,
the core curriculum includes 12
courses designed to give first-year
students a common body of knowl
edge in the areas of accounting,
marketing, finance and organiza
tional behavior.
Because business students come
from various undergraduate ma
jors and job experiences, the core
provides first-year students with a
level playing field for their further
study, said Laura Pochop, co-presi
dent of the Stanford Business
School Student Association.
According to Pochop, variations
in content across sections is one of
the students' biggest concerns. The
360 first-year students are divided
into six sections taught by different
professors. Because the professors
are given leeway in what they
teach, said Pochop, the students
end up learning different things.
