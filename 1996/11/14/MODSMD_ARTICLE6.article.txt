# GSB evaluates core curriculum
## 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
In an attempt to address the
changing needs of the business
world, faculty at the Graduate
School of Business are currently re
evaluating the school's core cur
riculum.
Business School Dean Mike
Spence formed a task force last
April to solicit feedback and sugges
tions from the faculty, students and
alumni. Members of the task force
are Business School Profs. David
Baron, Charles Holloway and Mar
garet Neale
According to MBA Program Di
rector George Parker, the evalua
tion differs from previous ones in
its magnitude. Although incremen
tal changes have been made to the
core, this evaluation marks the first
time in the last two decades that the
Business School has examined its
entire core.
Parker identified the "breath
taking advances" in technology, a
more experienced and internation

al student body and a rising interest
in entrepreneurship as the "chang
ing needs" of the Business School.
Under the current structure,
the core curriculum includes 12
courses designed to give first-year
students a common body of knowl
edge in the areas of accounting,
marketing, finance and organiza
tional behavior.
Because business students come
from various undergraduate ma
jors and job experiences, the core
provides first-year students with a
level playing field for their further
study, said Laura Pochop, co-presi
dent of the Stanford Business
School Student Association.
According to Pochop, variations
in content across sections is one of
the students' biggest concerns. The
360 first-year students are divided
into six sections taught by different
professors. Because the professors
are given leeway in what they
teach, said Pochop, the students
end up learning different things.
The task force will release a re
port, proposing three alternatives
plus the status quo option to
Spence in December, said Baron.
The final decision will be made by
the dean in February.
Of the proposals submitted,
Spence can only choose one, not
parts from various alternatives. Al
though not the most democratic op
tion possible, this review process is
more efficient for making substan
tial changes because everyone has
different interests, said second
year MBA student Kelsey Wirth,
co-chair of the student academic
committee.
So far, the task force has taken
several steps to gather information
about the core curriculum by con
ducting an academic survey and
two student focus groups, contact
ing alumni and course coordina
tors, and surveying other business
schoois, said Baron.
Other schools surveyed include
the University of Chicago, North
western University, Harvard Uni

versity, MIT, the University of
Pennsylvania and Columbia Uni
versity.
Drawing from student focus
group discussions, Wirth stressed
relevance and integration as key is
sues that need to be addressed in
the curriculum review.
"There is a body of knowledge
that every business school graduate
should know that is relevant to the
business world," Wirth said. "Stu
dents also need to know how all the
concepts they learn fit together
through projects that integrate the
fundamental tools."
The focus groups, made up of
randomly selected students and
monitored by a professional media
tor, also discussed improved com
munication among professors
teaching different courses, as well
as the need for more courses on in
ternational business.
The standing academic com
mittee of the student association
will continue to work with the task
force to get feedback from the stu
dents until the proposals are pre
sented. The 15-member commit
tee is elected by the student body
to act as a liaison between students
and faculty.
