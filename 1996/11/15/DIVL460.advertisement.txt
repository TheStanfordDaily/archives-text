Respond if a Daily reporter calls you:
If you're ever interviewed for an article in The
Daily, you need to know that you have certain
rights.
You can:
• Refuse to comment.
• Speak "on the record" — meaning that
everything you say can be quoted and attrib
uted to you. Reporters will assume that al' in
terviews are "on the record" unless you say
otherwise before the conversation begins.
• Speak "off the record" — meaning that the
reporter will only use what you say as back
ground information or as a tip. You will not be quoted or attributed. (Note: You must
state before the conversation begins that it is to be "off the record." The term does
not work retroactively.)
• Ask the reporter to read back your quotes. However, we can't show you the actual
text of an article before it is published.
• Submit your comments in written form. E-mailing your quotes to a reporter is a
good way to ensure accuracy.
Look up old Daily articles:
Readers are welcome to stop by our offices
between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to look up past
Daily articles. We have issues dating back to
the beginning of the century. A computerized
index at The Daily can help locate stories writ
ten after October 1988. Remember, you can
also check out our Web site for articles pub
lished since January 1996.
