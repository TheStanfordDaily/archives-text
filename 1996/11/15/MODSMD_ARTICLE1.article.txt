# Students fight ‘corporatization’
## 
### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
WTiat was intended to be no more
than a fair to educate students about
health and fitness issues turned into a
protest against the "corporatization" of
the University yesterday.
Approximately 50 students gathered
in White Plaza at noon to protest what
they saw as an excessive corporate pres
ence at the Collegiate Health and Fit
ness Tour being hosted there. Protest
ers were representatives of Students for
Environmental Action at Stanford, the

Progressive Student Network, Synergy
and Columbae.
For about two hours, students sat
and made speeches amid an artificial
rock climbing wall, a giant inflatable
condom package and various corporate
booths representing companies such as
Jeep-Eagle, Clearly Canadian, Trans
World Airlines and Details magazine.
At one point, protesters gathered
free promotional items from the various
booths and symbolically burned them.
Many, like junior Ally Field, felt the
health fair simply gave corporations an
opportunity to promote their agendas.

"The fair was a big advertisement by
a bunch of corporations who think that
Stanford is a haven of rich kids who will
ask mommy and daddy for a Jeep for
Christmas," she said. "It is not only
ridiculous, but really tragic."
Occasionally, passers-by stopped to
listen to the speeches, accept a flier or sit
down in a show of solidarity. Others dis
played indifference and even anger.
"I had seen White Plaza, and it had
saddened me to see the corporate pres
ence there," said senior Rudv Delson,
