# Students fight ‘corporatization’
## 
### David Arulanantham Contributing writer 
WTiat was intended to be no more
than a fair to educate students about
health and fitness issues turned into a
protest against the "corporatization" of
the University yesterday.
Approximately 50 students gathered
in White Plaza at noon to protest what
they saw as an excessive corporate pres
ence at the Collegiate Health and Fit
ness Tour being hosted there. Protest
ers were representatives of Students for
Environmental Action at Stanford, the

Progressive Student Network, Synergy
and Columbae.
For about two hours, students sat
and made speeches amid an artificial
rock climbing wall, a giant inflatable
condom package and various corporate
booths representing companies such as
Jeep-Eagle, Clearly Canadian, Trans
World Airlines and Details magazine.
At one point, protesters gathered
free promotional items from the various
booths and symbolically burned them.
Many, like junior Ally Field, felt the
health fair simply gave corporations an
opportunity to promote their agendas.

"The fair was a big advertisement by
a bunch of corporations who think that
Stanford is a haven of rich kids who will
ask mommy and daddy for a Jeep for
Christmas," she said. "It is not only
ridiculous, but really tragic."
Occasionally, passers-by stopped to
listen to the speeches, accept a flier or sit
down in a show of solidarity. Others dis
played indifference and even anger.
"I had seen White Plaza, and it had
saddened me to see the corporate pres
ence there," said senior Rudv Delson,

co-president of the Progressive
Student Network and an event
organizer. "It was symbolic of a
larger trend in the University,
a trend toward making deci
sions based on corporate
ideals."
According to Delson, the
specific demand put forth dur
ing the rally was the formation
of a task force, to be initiated
by University President Ger
hard Casper, that would ad
dress the "corporatization of
the University and would pro
pose broad-based alternative
means of judging the merits of
actions undertaken by the Uni
versity."
After the protest, Heather
Dunn, assistant director of the
Office of Student Activities,
said that because the intention

of the event had been "lost
among all the corporate promo
tion, the second day of the event
has been canceled."
Dunn also noted that "an im
portant dialogue was initiated
which we hope will continue in
the future."
In spite of their apparent vic
tory, organizers remained cau
tious.
"I feel charged that so many
people took part, both in organi
zation and the actual protest,"
said senior Bret Logue, also a
co-president of the Progressive
Student Network. "But this is
only the first step. We cannot
become overconfident simply
because of the apparent success
of this protest."
Field concurred. "As long as
corporations continue to invade
our campus with their advertis
ing campaigns disguised as
benevolent fairs, then we will
continue to actively oppose
such onslaughts," she said. •
