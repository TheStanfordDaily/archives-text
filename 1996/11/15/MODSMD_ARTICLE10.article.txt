COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — An 18-year-old Army
recruit has gone public with her allegation that a drill
sergeant sexually harassed her and threatened to cut
her throat if she told anyone about it.
Jessica Bleckley said she and other women were sex
ually abused in recent months at the Army's Aberdeen
Proving Ground, the Maryland base where soldiers have
been accused of rape, sexual harassment and other mis
conduct involving more than a dozen women recruits.
Bleckley, a South Carolina native, said the trouble
started in May, after she rejected the advances of a mar
ried drill instructor. He threatened to kill her if she
revealed the unwanted advances, she said.
"He became extremely obsessive and jealous," she
said Wednesday in the Anderson Independent Mail. "He
said he would kill me." The instructor made suggestive
remarks, sent her love letters and called her, she said.
In an ABC News interview that aired yesterday,
Bleckley described a graphic threat: "If I told anybody,
that he would cut my throat, that he knew ways of
killing people where no one would find out who did it."
She said about nine other higher-ranking soldiers —
mostly drill sergeants — also made unwanted advances
toward her.
After fellow soldiers convinced her to file harassment
charges, she became so despondent that the Army
placed her on suicide watch, she said.
The most serious charges at Aberdeen Proving
Ground involve drill Sgt. Delmar Simpson, who is
charged with raping three recruits and threatening to
kill or injure the women if they told.
