WASHINGTON (AP; - The United States
wants warring factions in Zaire to promise a
cease-fire before U.S. and allied troops agree to
move in and assure the delivery of relief aid to
a million refugees, the Pentagon said yester
day.
There was still fighting during the day with
in a few miles of where the multinational force
plans to start.
"We aren't anticipating a combat opera
tion," spokesman Kenneth Bacon said at the
Pentagon. "What we would like is a pledge by
the sides that there will be a cease-fire."
The proposal to send 1,000 U.S. troops to
secure the Goma airfield and use about 3,000
other Americans to open an "air bridge" of
relief supplies was under discussion yesterday
at the United Nations.
But the U.N. Security Council delayed a
decision until today at the earliest on authoriz
ing the international force. In addition to
Canada and the United States, the force of
10,000 to 12,000 people is expected to include
troops from France, Britain, Spain, South
Africa and several other nations.
