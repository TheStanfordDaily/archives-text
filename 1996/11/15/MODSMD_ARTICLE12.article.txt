# Bosnia commitment may stretch into 1998
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
U.S. troop deployment in Bosnia,
originally set to end in December,
is expected now to stretch well
into 1998 and involve up to
10,000 Army soldiers, NATO's
top official said yesterday.
The entire mission would
involve 30,000 troops from 30
countries, including the United
States, NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana told reporters.
"I had conversations with the
(NATO) foreign ministers,"
Solana said. "I would say that all
of them . . . are moving toward
Option C," the option among four
being considered that would keep
troops in the former Yugoslav
republic. In Washington, Solana
met privately with Vice President
A 1 Gore.
Apparently caught off guard,
White House press secretary
Mike McCurry and State Depart
ment spokesman Glyn Davies
told reporters that Gore made
clear to Solana that President

Clinton had not signed off on the
troop commitment.
McCurry added that the
administration is anxious not to
squander gains made in Bosnia
and noted that Gore "did share
some of that thinking" with
Solana.
Speaking anonymously,
administration officials con
firmed Solana's description of the
primary plan under considera
tion.
These officials said Clinton
was to approve the extended
troop commitment as early as last
night when he was meeting with
his top foreign policy advisers at
the White House. Clinton was
expected to announce any deci
sion today before departing on a
brief vacation then an Asian trip.
The issue is quite sensitive. A
year ago the Clinton administra
tion was assuring lawmakers that
19,000 American soldiers in
Bosnia with a 60,000-member
NATO peacekeeping mission

would be home by December. The
U.S. force, now about 14,000, is
scheduled to leave by mid-March.
Renewed fighting in Bosnia
this week has heightened worries
over the possible departure of
NATO peacekeepers. Top advis
ers to the president — particular
ly diplomat Richard Holbrooke,
who negotiated the Bosnia peace
agreement in 1995 — vigorously
urged Clinton to continue a U.S.
presence to avoid resuming the
vicious 3 1/2-year ethnic war that
Holbrooke's agreement halted.
"That may require some type
of presence in Bosnia," McCurry
said. "We've said that all along. It
was never very likely that they
were going to just pull up stakes
and go home. We needed to pre
serve the gains that have been
made."
"After spending the better part
of the year evading the question,
the Clinton administration
appears ready to finally own up to
the fact that it was never serious

about its commitment to limit
U.S. involvement in Bosnia to one
year," said Rep. Floyd Spence, R-
S.C., chairman of the House
National Security Committee.
Defense Secretary William
Perry and his top deputy, John
White, rushed to Capitol Hill yes
terday to brief members of the
Senate Armed Services Commit
tee on Bosnia and a pending U.S.
troop deployment to Zaire.
"I remain deeply concerned
about the increasing use of U.S.
troops for 'policing' operations
throughout the world, as well as
the costs associated with such
operations," Sen. Strom Thur
mond, R-S.C., the Armed Services
chairman, said after the meeting.
A congressional staffer speak
ing on condition of anonymity
said the ground-troop option in
Bosnia involved 8,000 to 10,000
Army troops joining in the inter
national effort. The mission
would extend from mid-March for
perhaps as much as another year.
