Michael does it again
SYDNEY, Australia (AP) — Who could have imagined Michael
Jackson would do something so ... conventional?
The Gloved One gave matrimony another chance yesterday
and married the woman carrying his baby — his plastic surgeon's
nurse, Debbie Rowe.
"They did it," a frazzled Jackson publicist Christine Holevas
confirmed in Los Angeles.
The wedding ceremony took place during a private ceremony
at the Sheraton on the Park Hotel, said a spokesman for the Aus
tralian tour promoter, Dainty Consolidated Entertainment. Pub
licist Brian Walsh said the ceremony took place about 12:30 a.m.,
after Jackson gave a concert.
Genetic cause found for Parkinson's
WASHINGTON (AP) — Researchers say they have found the
first laboratory evidence that a flawed gene is linked to Parkin
son's disease, a progressive brain disorder that aflects a half
million Americans.
A mutation was found in an area of chromosome 4 by analyz
ing DNA from members of a Italian family that has had Parkin
son's appear in generations going back to the 1700s, according
to Dr. Mihael H. Polymeropoulos of the National Institutes of
Health.
