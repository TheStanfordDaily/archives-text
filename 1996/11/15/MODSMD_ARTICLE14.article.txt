# Trial verdict sparks Florida riots
## Intense violence follows acquittal of white police officer 
### 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP)
— For two weeks, members of a
black separatist group called for
the "execution" of a white police
man for the fatal shooting of a
black motorist, threatening to
"burn this city down" unless the
officer was charged and fired.
The shooting itself had touched
off rioting Oct 24, so police took
the threats seriously.
They scoured the streets for
days, clearing trash bins and
alleys of six tons of rocks and bot
tles they believe the group stashed
as ammunition to use against
them.
And on Wednesday, the day a
grand jury cleared the officer,
police prepared to arrest leaders of
the group so they would spend the
night in jail.
But the strategy may have
backfired: The group leaders were
arrested in front of their head
quarters, in full view of already
seething protesters.
Within hours, two police offi
cers were wounded by gunfire and
seven other people were injured
Wednesday when people angrily
took to the same streets where

they rioted after Officer Jim
Knight shot 18-year-old Tyßon
Lewis through his windshield last
month.
Yesterday, Police Chief Darrel
Stephens faced angry questions
from City Council members who
wanted to know why the group
wasn't brought under control
before the looting, arson and
shooting broke out.
"I'm furious. I am sorry, but I
am furious," council member
Connie Kane told Stephens. "Why
have we waited so long to say that
law and order is going to prevail 0 "
Stephens defended the police.
"Our effort was not aimed at
provoking violence," he said. "Our
effort was aimed at doing whatev
er we could to prevent violence."
This time, the violence was less
widespread but more intense.
Police responding to reports of
trouble were met with bullets,
rocks and bottles. Passers-by were
attacked with concrete and bot
tles. Police used tear gas and bar
ricades to break up the groups,
only to have them reform in new
areas.
Stephens blamed the violence

largely on the small black sepa
ratist group, the National Peo
ple's Democratic Uhuru Move
ment.
"I don't believe that this was a
spontaneous event,"he said.
By early yesterday morning,
the streets were quiet, and calm
prevailed into the afternoon. The
main activity was from city work
ers, who removed debris and
rocks. Extra police were out on
the streets.
The threat of violence had
hung over the city since shortly
after the first night of riots, which
caused upward of $5 million in
damage.
In the days after the Oct. 24
shooting, the Uhuru group held
"tribunals," where they posted
the photographs of Knight and his
partner on large posters. The
group found the officers guilty of
murder and said they should be
executed.
Stephens said police learned
that the group had targeted cer
tain buildings they planned to
burn if the grand jury cleared
Knight. He stepped up patrols in
those areas
