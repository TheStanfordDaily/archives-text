Kudos to Alternative
Spring Break for
expanding its program

Already bolstered
BY a prestigious national
award, Stanford's Alterna
tive Spring Break program chose
not to rest on its laurels. Instead,
the program took its additional
funding and expanded to accom
modate growing demand.
As a model student organiza
tion should, Alternative Spring
Break utilized its special-fee
money to accommodate 36 addi
tional people for the March 1997
program. This should alleviate a
major dilemma the program faced
last year — having to turn appli
cants away.
Yes, you read correctly — a
public service organization at
Stanford had to actually turn peo
ple away. Roughly 150 students
applied for the 96 spots in the
program last year. This year
Alternative Spring Break will be
able to send 132 students on pub
lic service projects, and the pro
gram's organizers have created
three new service projects focus
ing on women's issues, children's
issues and environmental policy
to meet the high demand.
Alternative Spring Break's
organizers, both past and present,
deserve credit for making a suc
cess out of a program that con
ventional wisdom would bet
against. At a school with an
unfortunately well-deserved rep
utation for intense pre-profes
sionalism, who would have
thought that so many students
would voluntarily forego the
attractions of a lazy spring break
and challenge themselves with
difficult social problems?
Alternative Spring Break is no
touchy-feely, pat-ourselves-on
the-back-for-trying, Utopian good
works program. The program

takes on some of the most dis
turbing social problems of our
time: homelessness, AIDS, educa
tion in inner cities and Native
American issues. And student vol
unteers do not just sit in cushy
chairs at Stanford and talk about
these issues; they go to East Palo
Alto, to South Central Los Ange
les and to Indian reservations,
and they work with local groups
to gain first-hand understanding
of the issues.
Instead of shying away from
more controversial issues like
medical ethics, environmentalism
and AIDS policy, Alternative
Spring Break challenges students
to tackle these complex issue head
on in real test cases.
This year's program represents
not just a quantitative enlarge
ment but also a qualitative
improvement: Students in four of
the project groups will take a two
unit course during winter quarter
focusing on issues related to the
group's planned activities. The
program, then, is really a three
month undertaking rather than a
simple one-week excursion into
community service.
Alternative Spring Break has
also done a commendable job of
recruiting group leadership from
several different offices on cam
pus. Clearly, the innovative pro
gram has never stopped seeking
new ways to make a difference.
The most discouraging aspect
of Alternative Spring Break was
that many who wanted to partici
pate could not be a part of the
program last year. Although the
program has expanded, the recent
award and special-fee request
likely has increased awareness of
the program, which will probably
boost the number of applicants.
Perhaps in the future, the pro
gram should increase its special
fee request in an attempt to
accommodate more interested
students. Alternative Spring
Break appears to know how to
use its funding wisely, and the
program should continue to
expand.
