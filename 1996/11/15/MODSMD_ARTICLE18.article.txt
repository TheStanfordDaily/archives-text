## Auditorium of the absurd 
### 
POINTING OUT ABSURDITY at
Stanford isn't hard. Our mascot can
be a color, or a bird or a Catholic guy
who checks in just below the Pope. We
have one of the world's best hospitals but
are named after a typhoid fever victim.
And EAST House is on the west side of
campus.
Some examples of our absurdity are
much more serious. They make no more
sense than our schizoid mascot, but they
question our humanity rather than make
us laugh. For example, consider disabled
access to Memorial Auditorium.
Theater of the Absurd
Memorial Auditorium is arguably Stan
ford's main event center. Flicks, debates,
speakers. For campus guests, the auditori
um is our Visitor Information center.
Clearly, it should be easily accessible to
everyone.
But try getting in with a wheelchair.
Ten steps lead up to the main entrance. A
sign directs those in wheelchairs to the left,
where another sign leads them around to
the back of the auditorium's west side.
Here, in the colonnade, is where things get
absurd.
Waiting for Godot
Guests in wheelchairs cannot enter
Memorial Auditorium by themselves —
they must place a call on a telephone out
side the entrance, and wait for the door to
be opened by someone working inside. A

sign posted by the phone offers these help
ful tips:
Lift phone for assistance
1) Auto-rings box office — try first
2) Auto-rings projection room
Once inside the door, the auditorium's
unfriendliness grows. Seating areas for
wheelchairs are not integrated with other
seats. They are located in the very front of
the ground floor, on the extreme left and
right sides — bad seats unless you are a
snail and your eyes are on the ends of
stalks. But if getting into the auditorium in
a wheelchair seems absurd . ..
Krapp's Last Tape
Going to the bathroom in a wheelchair
involves another absurd game of locked
doors and telephones. Most use stairs to
reach the bathrooms without leaving the
auditorium. Those in wheelchairs, howev
er, must exit the auditorium and cross an
80-foot outdoor colonnade to the bathroom
door which can only be opened from inside
by another person. That's right — Memo
rial Auditorium's structure not only makes
it impossible for visitors in wheelchairs to
enter without assistance, but they cannot
even go to the bathroom alone. Some stu
dents with wheelchairs, reluctant to rely
on auditorium staff, only attend events
when friends can come with them.
Endgame
Even in the face of this absurdity, many
with whom I spoke still appreciate the aes

thetics of the auditorium's Mission Revival
architecture, though the colonnades create
access problems.
What was the architect of "Memorial"
Auditorium thinking when, in designing a
building dedicated to war veterans, he built
10 steps leading up to the entrance? Veter
ans often return from war in wheelchairs
— how did they respond to the building?
"Thanks for building the auditorium for us
- too bad we CANT GET INSIDE OF
IT!"
While a trade-off between aesthetics
and accessibility may be excusable in an
older building like Memorial Auditorium,
it is inexcusable for newer buildings, like
Kresge Auditorium, which should possess
both. And yet, students in wheelchairs at
Kresge must sit in a small area behind all
other seats.
Improving access for students with dis
abilities is not just a matter of original
building design, however. You and I
improve it immediately by parking our
bikes out of the way, holding meetings in
areas with access and available seating for
students with disabilities and keeping the
access needs of students with disabilities in
mind. All of these things make Stanford a
little less absurd.

he knows what love is.
