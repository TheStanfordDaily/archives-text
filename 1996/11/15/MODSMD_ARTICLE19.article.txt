Don't hand over White Plaza to corporate America

"A message supported by billions of dol- \
lars is often more easily heard." i
— Margaret Mills i
The collegiate health i
and Fitness Tour that arrived on !
campus yesterday is just one in a <
long string of University-approved <
activities run by corporate America i
that have been forced upon the student <
body without prior consent or approval. i
Other examples (just from this week) 1
are the Saturn car display in White <
Plaza and a Disney film production at
Stanford Stadium. i
Some have argued that corporate ;
America has as much a right to be pre- i
sent in White Plaza as any other group <
and that we should support corporate i
free speech as much as any other indi- i
vidual's. However, in our capitalist
society, as in the rest of the world, no
speech is ever truly "free." And the
rhetorical strength that comes with
having monetary reserves in excess of
millions for the sole purpose of propa
ganda makes the delivery of the pro
capitalist position far more powerful
than anything the opposition could

argue. Almost by default, the capitalist
system always delivers a more convinc
ing message.
In light of this we must ask our
selves some questions. Do we pay
$30,000 a year so that our attention
can be sold to the materialists, over
consumers, industrial polluters, labor
abusers and purveyors of capitalist
amorality? Can we just stand by while
the University continues to cut support
for any program that encourages stu
dents to view society critically?
The health and fitness fair is the most
offensive example of corporate invasion
yet. If the Career Fair disturbed you ...
this fair is worse. It is the dialectical
counterpart to the Career Fair. Together
they constitute the essential lesson that
the University wishes to teach all of its
students: Work to consume; consume to
work. We must take action to stop this
vicious circle that threatens to under
mine any possibility of life without such
mindless consumption.
Disney's casting call for "attractive"
and "wholesome'Mooking students to
spend 12 hours of their day in Stanford
Stadium participating in the perpetua-

tion of impossible aesthetic ideals of
what Americans "should" look like is
simply another version of how corporate
America is using the Stanford campus to
reinforce its ideals. Not to mention that
even the most cursory glance at Disney's
corporate practices reveals the tragic
truth behind the seemingly benign Mick
ey Mouse mask. Any student that choos
es to participate in the Disney produc
tion is perpetuating the stereotypes that
such a diverse university as Stanford
should aim to dismantle.
College is supposed to encourage a
perspective of critical evaluation of a
social system with a history full of
examples of various forms of oppres
sion. However, based on the events of
this past week, Stanford seems much
more intent on offering endless hours
of corporate inculcation and provides
precious few provisions to help counter
these financially well-supported per
spectives. We must consider capitalist
commercial propaganda as much an
ideology as any other and be prepared
to argue against it with powerful
counter-advertisements.
This problem is not exclusively that

of Stanford, but it is indicative of a
more widespread systemic problem. The
University is faced with huge cuts in
government assistance for education
and health. Because of this, the admin
istration becomes more and more
reliant upon corporate funding. Cowell
Student Health Center, unable to afford
the types of health programs and infor
mation it believed were important for
students, was forced to call on corporate
America to assist. But the type of assis
tance that requires flooding White Plaza
with propaganda is unwanted.
We cannot allow ourselves and our
lives to be bought! We must show the
University, the corporations and the
American people at large that we mean
business and that we will no longer just
sit back and accept their well-financed
wisdom. Yesterday's protest in White
Plaza was merely the first example of a
student body ready to fight back against
untamed corporate domination of every
day life.
