# Details editor entertains small crowd

### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
Details magazine editor Joe Dolce parlayed
a small Kresge Auditorium crowd last night
into an intimate discussion about his magazine
and the issues that concern its readers.
The speech was sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau.
Dolce arrived at his scheduled 8 p.m. speech
prepared to give an oration on journalism.
When he found that his audience consisted of
only 12 students, though, he changed his
plans, turning the evening into an informal
question-and-answer session.

Opting not to make use of a microphone or
podium, Dolce sat on the edge of the Kresge
stage and invited the group to move into the
first three rows of the center aisle. Dressed in
all black and wearing heavy-rimmed glasses,
Dolce exuded an air of intellectualism. He pro
ceeded to go from person to person, always pos
ing the question, "What are you doing here?"
Audience members answered with enthusi
asm, talking about themselves and asking
questions about Details, which was started six
years ago. Their inquiries centered on a range
of topics from Dolce's magazine to the publish
ing industry as a whole.
Initially, the discussion centered around

Details' readership. Though Dolce said the
magazine is specifically targeted toward young
men, he admitted that its audience is much
more far-reaching.
"The dirty truth about men's magazines,
ever since Esquire began, is that 20 percent to
30 percent of the readers are women," he said.
He attributed that fact to traditional maga
zine roles. Men usually read special interest
magazines, he said, while women buy "service"
magazines that fill specific needs. Details, he
said, is moving more and more toward becom
ing such a service publication.
