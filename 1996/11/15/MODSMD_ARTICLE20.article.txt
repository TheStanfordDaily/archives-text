# Lack of parking has become unmanageable
## 
### 
I couldn't make it to work today.
I'm calling in: no parking, sick of pay
ing tickets.
Of course I drove to work eager to
help countless Florence Moore Hall
students navigate the University,
bridging the gaps between Housing
Assignment Services, the residence
dean, the Undergraduate Advising
Center, the resident fellow, the resi
dent assistant, the head advising asso
ciate and the resident computer coordi
nator, spelling out all the acronyms of

the above and giving tours to prospec
tive freshmen. But, alas, no parking.
I drove up Mayfield Avenue first, as
is my daily ritual — no spaces as usual.
I headed up Lomita Drive. The street
was full, and the small lot is reserved
for residents only — I know because
I've been ticketed there before. I
checked out the large lot behind Flo
Mo, made the circle and headed back. A
quick look behind dining services and
I'm up the fire lane back to Lomita,
down to the lake where a woman
showed me a parking ticket she had
just gotten. I carefully navigated the
dirt lot at the lake and decided to head
back up the hill.
Maybe someone has moved — NOT!

I took the right fork this time up to the
knoll, nothing there. Passed by a park
ing officer who was eagerly doing his
job. I wonder where he parks. Down
the hill, behind the Robert Moore
houses and Xanadu — still no luck.
Ack! I try the ritual once again — no
luck.
By now I'm more than late, I'm
AWOL. Students are anxiously await
ing my arrival. I know they need to
reserve the guest room, check out a
spare key and gather various bits of
information that only I can provide.
I'm supposed to work here. I have to
answer phones and respond to e-mail
messages, but I can't do that because I
am driving around looking for a park

ing space.
I've already tried driving to the
train station, taking the train and then
the Marguerite. It takes three times as
long and costs three times as much.
It's four o'clock, almost time for me
to go home. Driving around had given
me time to think.
I think I've figured out a plan for
tomorrow. I'll hunt for a space for two
hours, then take one of the many
vacant service vehicle spaces. It takes
about two hours worth of my wages to
pay for a ticket, so that way I'll break
even.
