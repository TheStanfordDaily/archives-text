# Consulting conference will offer alumni insight
## 
### Travis Brandon 
Representatives of some of the
top consulting firms in the nation
will participate in a consulting
night Saturday, sponsored by the
Stanford Economics Association.
The event, which is open to all
Stanford students, begins at 6
p.m. in Oak West at Tresidder
Union.
Eight companies — including
Andersen Consulting, Boston
Consulting Group and Walt Dis
ney Co. — will discuss what it
means to be a management con
sultant and the opportunities for
Stanford students in the field of
management consulting.
These companies have a histo
ry of hiring Stanford graduates,
and many of the company repre
sentatives will be alumni.
Senior Dhruv Gupta, presi
dent of the Stanford Economics
Association, said consulting
night is not only an opportunity
to find employment but also "the
best opportunity for seniors and
juniors to compare consulting
firms."
Toward this end, the associa
tion has invited a variety of firms

that specialize in regular consult
ing, high-tech consulting and
other "niches." This variety made
the event a success last year, said
senior Peter Lagerquist, another
member of the economics associa
tion.
"Consulting is open to every
one, not just economics students,"
Gupta explained.
He added that consulting can
offer students insight into the
functioning of companies, as well
as useful experience for anyone in
terested in business or nonprofit
organizations.
The Stanford Economics Asso
ciation is an organization that fur
thers the study of economics at
Stanford by putting on events like
consulting night and publishing
economic papers. It works to im
prove relations between the facul
ty of the Economics Department
and students by publishing class
reviews and sponsoring faculty
student mixers.
Through this event and others,
including one focusing on doctoral
programs, the association tries to
make the study of economics at
Stanford more meaningful,
Lagerquist said.
