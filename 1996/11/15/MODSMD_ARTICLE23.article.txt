## Runners off to Districts 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
After a two-week stretch of training following
their sweeping victories at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, the cross country team mem
bers will travel to Fresno tomorrow for the District
VIII Championships.
The meet will consist of 22 Division I colleges
from Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada
and Oregon. The top two teams will automatically
qualify for the NCAA Championships in Tucson,
Ariz., on Nov. 25. The Cardinal should easily secure
a spot in the race by finishing in the top three.
Other teams may also qualify for the nationals
with at-large bids, depending upon their past
record.
"Coming off a Pac-10 victory for both the
women and the men was a really big high," said
coach Vin Lananna, "but we needed to come back
down to reality quickly since the Pac does not real
ly determine anything. You win that or lose that,
whatever you do, but you have to move on to the
next order of business.
The Stanford women runners, who replaced Vil
lanova as the second-ranked team in the nation, fig
ure to be the team to beat in the district. The race
will most likely be a contest between Pac-10 schools
on both the team and individual levels.
Eleventh-ranked Washington, which finished
second behind the Cardinal at the Pac-lOs, should
once again be the team's most formidable competi
tion. No. 16 Arizona and No. 23 UCLA also figure
to compete for the top three spots.
Individual competition is also deep. Sophomore
Wildcat Amy Skieresz, the defending district cham
pion and two-time defending Pac-10 champion, is
the front-runner for the individual race. Freshman
Kim Mortensen of UCLA and senior Emebet
Shiferaw of USC, the second and third finishers at
this year's Pac-10 meet, also figure into the individ
ual title picture.
The top Cardinal contenders are junior Jessica
Fry, who finished fourth at the Pac-10 this year,
and Mary Cobb, who took sixth at this year's con
ference meet but placed third in 1995 and fourth in
the previous district race.
"We just want to keep up what we've been
doing," said senior captain Monal Chokshi. "We're
going to try to win the districts so we can go into the
NCAAs really confident."
The second-ranked men are also
the favorites for their race, with
district rivals No. 6 Oregon also in
the hunt. But the Cardinal's
toughest competitor could be Port
land, who is currently ranked fifth
in the country.
Some of the top individual male
runners are junior Mebrahtom
Keflezighi of UCLA, senior Karl
Keska of Arizona and Uli Steidl of
Portland. Keflezighi is the current
Pac-10 champion, handing Keska
his only loss of the season. In addi
tion to taking second at the confer
ence meet this year, Keska is the
defending conference and district

champion. Steidl was last year's
runner-up in the district.
Cardinal front-runners are
senior Greg Jimmerson and sopho
mores Brad and Brent Hauser.
Jimmerson finished fourth in this
year's Pac-10 race as well as in last
year's district competition. Brad
Hauser took third in the confer
ence this year, and his brother
Brent took fifth. Both Mausers had
top-20 finishes in the district last
year.
"The thrill of winning Pac-lOs
wore off kind of quickly because
we had to move ahead," said senior
co-captain Rob Reeder. "We've
been concentrating on taking dis
tricts and the NCAAs as a kind of a
dual package, but districts is obvi
ously critical for having an NCAA.
We need top three, but we hope to
win.
