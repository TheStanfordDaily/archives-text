# Soccer to play Broncos in NCAA tourney
## Women hope to avenge last year's loss at Santa Clara's home field 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
The Cardinal will be out for revenge tomorrow
night.
Stanford's women's soccer team (12-8) is
scheduled to face off against its archrival — fifth
seeded Santa Clara (15-3-2) — at 7:30 p.m. on
the Broncos' home field, Buck Shaw Stadium.
One year ago, Stanford found itself in an
almost identical situation: a first round matchup
against Santa Clara at Buck Shaw Stadium. The
Cardinal played 139 minutes of intense soccer in
front of a hostile, belligerent and often rude
crowd before falling 3-2 in sudden death triple
overtime to its hated rival.
"That game was a really tough one to lose,"
said Stanford sophomore goalie Erin Bryla. "We
played hard and well, and it hurt not to win."
There is no love lost between these two teams,
as every one of their 16 encounters has been a
hard-fought, emotionally intense all-out battle.
The Broncos hold a 9-5-2 edge over their cross
town rivals, including last year's thrilling first
round victory and a 2-1 win earlier this season at
Stanford's Maloney Field.
"I don't care what time, or where, or even if it
is the NCAA tournament — any time Santa
Clara and Stanford play it is a huge game," said
coach Steve Swanson. "There are some special
rivalries in college sports and this is one of them.
Every time we play Santa Clara, it is a battle."
As much of a history as these two teams have,
players on both sides know that the only game
that matters now will be played tomorrow night.
The winner moves on to the second round; the
loser goes home and starts preparing for next
year.
"This is the ideal situation for us," Bryla said.
"The game is close enough that we should have
some fans, it's the NCAA tournament, and we're
playing our biggest rivals. This is what you
want."
The Stanford team that takes the field tomor
row night is not the same squad that fell to Santa
Clara back in September. At that time, Stanford
was going through a rocky stretch of the season
where it just couldn't seem to put the ball in the
net, and a number of key players were out with
injuries.
Sophomore Tracye Lawyer, a consistent goal
scoring threat, and junior Rita Hermiz, a solid
midfielder, were both out of the lineup. Also,
senior co-captain Emily Burt, who netted Stan-

ford's only goal in that game,
injured herself in the early stages
of the second half and was forced
to sit out the rest of the game.
"We're a very different team
than the one that played Santa
Clara before," Swanson said. "We
have some players back, we have
more confidence, we're control
ling the ball better, and we're
playing better defense. I think
we're a much better team now."
Stanford is also coming off its
best and most consistent perfor
mances over the past few weeks.
Although it did lose to California
in the final game of the regular
season 1-0, Stanford had strung
together five straight wins before
traveling to Berkeley.
Freshman Ronnie Fair, who
has missed the last five contests
due to an ankle injury, is now
available to help the Cardinal.
Fair had been starting at sweeper
before she was injured in the
Washington State game Oct. 25.
"It is good to go in coming off a
good streak," Bryla said. "We're
playing with confidence and
momentum, and we're all excited
and anxious to get another shot at
Santa Clara."
Santa Clara is a very strong
team. The Broncos are the onl\
team to beat second-seeded
Notre Dame this year, and the\

lost in the final minute 1-0 to
North Carolina, the top seed in
the tournament. By comparison,
Stanford was blown out by the
Tar Heels 6-1 and played poorly
against the Fighting Irish, losing
4-0.
"Santa Clara has some great
individual talent and no real
weaknesses," Swanson said. "We
are going to have to play sharp
defensively, and we have to mini
mize our mistakes."
And while the Cardinal is
expecting large numbers to turn
out for Santa Clara, team mem
bers aren't worried about the
crowd.
"Last year I was a little ner
vous about the crowds," said
Bryla, who was the recipient of
heaps of obnoxious taunting a
year ago. "But now I've heard it
all, and I know that I've just got
to block it out of my mind and
play soccer. We won't have much
trouble doing that. And there
should be some Stanford fans
there too, supporting us."
Burt summed up the team's
current attitude going into the
game.
"This is one of the better
matchups we could have hoped
for We're staying close to home;
we're playing Santa Clara. I'm
just really excited and ready to
play."
The winner of the matchup
between Stanford and Santa Clara
will face the victor of the Penn
State and George Mason game.
