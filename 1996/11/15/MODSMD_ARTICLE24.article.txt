# Soccer to play Broncos in NCAA tourney
## Women hope to avenge last year's loss at Santa Clara's home field 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
The Cardinal will be out for revenge tomorrow
night.
Stanford's women's soccer team (12-8) is
scheduled to face off against its archrival — fifth
seeded Santa Clara (15-3-2) — at 7:30 p.m. on
the Broncos' home field, Buck Shaw Stadium.
One year ago, Stanford found itself in an
almost identical situation: a first round matchup
against Santa Clara at Buck Shaw Stadium. The
Cardinal played 139 minutes of intense soccer in
front of a hostile, belligerent and often rude
crowd before falling 3-2 in sudden death triple
overtime to its hated rival.
"That game was a really tough one to lose,"
said Stanford sophomore goalie Erin Bryla. "We
played hard and well, and it hurt not to win."
There is no love lost between these two teams,
as every one of their 16 encounters has been a
hard-fought, emotionally intense all-out battle.
The Broncos hold a 9-5-2 edge over their cross
town rivals, including last year's thrilling first
round victory and a 2-1 win earlier this season at
Stanford's Maloney Field.
"I don't care what time, or where, or even if it
is the NCAA tournament — any time Santa
Clara and Stanford play it is a huge game," said
coach Steve Swanson. "There are some special
rivalries in college sports and this is one of them.
Every time we play Santa Clara, it is a battle."
As much of a history as these two teams have,
players on both sides know that the only game
that matters now will be played tomorrow night.
The winner moves on to the second round; the
loser goes home and starts preparing for next
year.
"This is the ideal situation for us," Bryla said.
"The game is close enough that we should have
some fans, it's the NCAA tournament, and we're
playing our biggest rivals. This is what you
want."
The Stanford team that takes the field tomor
row night is not the same squad that fell to Santa
Clara back in September. At that time, Stanford
was going through a rocky stretch of the season
where it just couldn't seem to put the ball in the
net, and a number of key players were out with
injuries.
Sophomore Tracye Lawyer, a consistent goal
scoring threat, and junior Rita Hermiz, a solid
midfielder, were both out of the lineup. Also,
senior co-captain Emily Burt, who netted Stan-

Senior forward Erin Martin controls the ball in a game against Sacramento State last week. Stanford
takes on the Santa Clara Broncos tomorrow in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
