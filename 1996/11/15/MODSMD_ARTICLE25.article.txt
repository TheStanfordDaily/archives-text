# Football can't lose to Washington State
## Cardinal must win to stay in bowl race 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
While everyone in the Bay Area gears up for
a Big Game with bowl implications, Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham and the Cardi
nal football squad are quietly focusing on this
week's opponent, Washington State.

"Our situation is pretty clear in regards to
one ball game," Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham said. "This is a one-game tourna
ment and the only game that matters is Wash
ington State. That will be our focus: one game,
single elimination against Washington State."
The Cougars are looking at a very similar sit
uation from their perspective. With a win over

the Cardinal, Washington State can put itself in
position to earn a bowl bid if the Cougars upset
their rival, Washington, in the final game of the
season.
The Cardinal needs two wins to go to a bowl,
and the Cougars probably need two as well.
However, Washington State (5-4, 3-3 Pacific
10 Conference) might have avoided this must
win situation. The Cougars had a golden oppor
tunity to grab sole possession of third place in
the conference with a road win at UCLA last
week. But the Bruins jumped all over the
Cougars 38-14, and Washington State dropped
into a four-way tie with Stanford, UCLA and
California.
"Last week we played very poorly — as poor
ly as we have played in my tenure here at Wash
ington State in the aspects of intensity and
enthusiasm," said Cougar head coach Mike
Price. "It's my job to motivate and inspire this
team and I did a piss-poor job of doing that
[against UCLA], I need to do a better job, and
our players need to come ready to play."
While Stanford was busy sweeping the Los
Angeles schools in the past two weeks, the
Cougars themselves were a victim of the broom,
thanks to a 29-24 loss to USC two games ago.
After starting the season 3-1 in the conference,
WSU has now lost two straight.
"This is a good football team," Willingham
said of the Cougars. "The previous ball game
against USC, I think they very easily could have
won that game. The game against UCLA was
out of character for them."
The Cougars have traditionally been an
offensive-minded squad, and this year's team is
no exception. Through nine games, Washington
State has reached the end zone 31 times, two
more than it scored all last year and 16 more
than the Cardinal has this year. In fact, the
Cougars have scored in 162 consecutive confer-

ence games, the longest streak in
the Pac-10.
At the helm for the Cougar
offense is sophomore Ryan Leaf, an
emerging superstar in the Pac-10.
Leafs 248 yards per game of total
offense ranks him second in the
conference, and he also owns a 23-
11 touchdown-to-interception
ratio. For the season, Leaf has
completed 210 of 380 for a total of
2,874 yards.
"I am betting on him all the
time to succeed in the nitty-gritty,"
Price said of Leaf. "In the two
minute drill, he is awesome. He has
improved every game."
Leaf is even better, however,
with the emergence of a running
attack in Pullman this season.
Junior Michael Black is one of only
two backs in the Pac-10 averaging
more than 100 yards per game and
ranks fourth in the conference in
all-purpose yardage as well.
"Washington State passes a
lot," said senior Stanford nose
tackle Pete Swanson. "But it's
scary when a team that passes can
surprise you with the run. That's
why I think Black has so many
yards this year because he has been
able to catch defenses off guard.
When he does run the ball, he is a
very effective back and they have a
good offensive line."
The well-rounded Cougar

offense, fourth in the Pac-10 in
total offense, can put some points
on the board in a hurry, as evi
denced by back-to-back 50-plus
point games early in the season.
The question marks for Wash
ington State, however, have been
on the defensive side of the ball. It
was not until week four when the
Cougars were able to hold an oppo
nent under 34 points in a game.
But the Cougars have since shored
up that problem, especially against
the run.
Until last week, the Cougars had
yet to allow a running back to break
the 100-yard barrier. Washington
State owes a lot of that success to
senior linebacker James Darling,
who leads the Pac-10 in tackles with
a 12.6 per game average. Opposing
running backs are averaging just
3.2 yards per carry against Darling
and the Cougar defense.
Washington State also has cre
ated 21 turnovers. Safety Duane
Stewart and cornerback Shad
Hinchen have combined for five
interceptions.
Stanford and the Cougars met in
the 10th game of the season last
year as well, with the Cardinal
needing a victory to maintain hopes
for a bowl bid. After the Cougars
jumped out to a 17-3 lead in the
first half, Stanford, behind 450
yards of total offense, stormed back
for a 36-24 victory in Pullman.
The Cardinal leads the overall
series with the Cougars 26-19-1
and has not lost to Washington
State since 1989.
