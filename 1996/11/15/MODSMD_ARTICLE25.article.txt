# Football can't lose to Washington State
## Cardinal must win to stay in bowl race 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
While everyone in the Bay Area gears up for
a Big Game with bowl implications, Stanford
head coach Tyrone Willingham and the Cardi
nal football squad are quietly focusing on this
week's opponent, Washington State.

"Our situation is pretty clear in regards to
one ball game," Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham said. "This is a one-game tourna
ment and the only game that matters is Wash
ington State. That will be our focus: one game,
single elimination against Washington State."
The Cougars are looking at a very similar sit
uation from their perspective. With a win over

the Cardinal, Washington State can put itself in
position to earn a bowl bid if the Cougars upset
their rival, Washington, in the final game of the
season.
The Cardinal needs two wins to go to a bowl,
and the Cougars probably need two as well.
However, Washington State (5-4, 3-3 Pacific
10 Conference) might have avoided this must
win situation. The Cougars had a golden oppor
tunity to grab sole possession of third place in
the conference with a road win at UCLA last
week. But the Bruins jumped all over the
Cougars 38-14, and Washington State dropped
into a four-way tie with Stanford, UCLA and
California.
"Last week we played very poorly — as poor
ly as we have played in my tenure here at Wash
ington State in the aspects of intensity and
enthusiasm," said Cougar head coach Mike
Price. "It's my job to motivate and inspire this
team and I did a piss-poor job of doing that
[against UCLA], I need to do a better job, and
our players need to come ready to play."
While Stanford was busy sweeping the Los
Angeles schools in the past two weeks, the
Cougars themselves were a victim of the broom,
thanks to a 29-24 loss to USC two games ago.
After starting the season 3-1 in the conference,
WSU has now lost two straight.
"This is a good football team," Willingham
said of the Cougars. "The previous ball game
against USC, I think they very easily could have
won that game. The game against UCLA was
out of character for them."
The Cougars have traditionally been an
offensive-minded squad, and this year's team is
no exception. Through nine games, Washington
State has reached the end zone 31 times, two
more than it scored all last year and 16 more
than the Cardinal has this year. In fact, the
Cougars have scored in 162 consecutive confer-
