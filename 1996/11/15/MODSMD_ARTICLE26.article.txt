# Water polo hosts Pacific in last home game
## 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
Tomorrow at 10:30 a.m., the
Stanford men's water polo team
faces the No. 6 Pacific in its final
Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion game of the season. Current
ly 15-5 overall and 6-1 MPSF, the
Cardinal is in a four-way tie for
first place in the conference.
"We have put ourselves in good
position to qualify for NCAAs,"
said head coach Dante Dettaman
ti. "But we have to heat HOP and
then see what happens down
south."
As it stands, if the Card wins
tomorrow it is guaranteed at least
a No. 3 seed in the conference
tournament. And depending on
what happens in I/is Angeles this

weekend with USC and UCIJV,
Stanford could end up the No. 1
seed.
The game is extremely impor
tant, as it will determine Stan
ford's opportunities for the offsea
son. Add to that the fact that the
Cardinal narrowly won two of its
three games with UOP this season
and it's clear that tomorrow's
game will be a battle.
"We've played them three
times, and it's been a struggle
each time," Dettamanti said. "In
the second game, we needed a last
minute two-point goal by Brian
Heifferon to tie the game before
winning in overtime. And in the
NorCal tournament, Crosby
Grant scored a backhand goal
with under a minute remaining to
give us a narrow one-goal lead."

UOP has proven to be a worthy
opponent for more than just the
Cardinal this season. With a
recent upset of No. 4 California
just two weeks ago and a one-goal
loss to No. 2 UCLA, UOP's No. 6
ranking can be very deceiving.
With such talent as two-time
Olympic gold medalist Brad Schu
macher and New Zealand native
Anthony Cullwick. the Tigers
have shown that they never go
down without a fight.
"They have nothing to lose,"
Dettamanti said. "Their record is
not going to change by beating us.
But it would help their credibility.
They're trying to become a power
in water polo, and this is their
chance to do it."
While the UOP team itself pre
sents a challenge for the Cardinal.

the health of several top Stanford
players may be an issue as well.
This week senior holeman and
captain Brian Wallin, sophomore
Arturo Rodelo and senior Bryce
Mathews have all been fighting
the flu. While it appears that they
will recover in time for tomor
row's game, playing without one
or more of them is still a possible
scenario.
"We have enough depth that
we could lose one or two guys and
still be comfortable," Dettamanli
said. "It would be tough to end up
playing without Wallin, but it
would be similar to playing on
next year's team. Eventually
we're going to have to play with
out him."
Another hurdle which the team
will face is the possibility of a let
down. With huge wins over No. 1
USC and No. 2 UCLA in a 10-day
span just behind the Cardinal, it
becomes easy to lose focus.
"We are a little worried about a
possible letdown. But we all know
that we have struggled to beat
UOP," Dettamanti said.
So as the Stanford squad faces a
final obstacle to its postseason aspi
rations, it is clear that it won't be
easy to triumph. But if this year's
team has one particular strength
that has helped it to win, it has been
the ability to overcome adversity.
