Stanford, UCLA, women's
volleyball, enough said.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team (21-2, 13-1 Pacific 10
Conference) will travel to Los
Angeles to play UCLA (14-11, 6-
8) tonight and USC (16-6, 10-4)
tomorrow. Both matches begin
at 7 p.m.
The Cardinal and Bruins
have a rivalry like none other in
women's collegiate volleyball.
Although UCLA has struggled
this season due to injuries and
inconsistency, Stanford will not
expect a cakewalk when it visits
Pauley Pavilion.
"We are going to have to play
well," Stanford coach Don Shaw

said. "It is always a tough
match."
UCLA played one of its best
matches of the season when it
made its appearance on the
Farm a few weeks ago. The Bru
ins took the first game from
Stanford 15-10, and gave the
Card a run for its money before
losing the match in four games.
The Bruins will need to win this
match if they hope to end with a
winning conference record.
"This is a must-win situation
for UCLA," Shaw said. "If they
lose to us, they would probably
end up 9-9 in the conference and
just barely make the tourna
ment."
The Card will then travel to

South Central Los Angeles to face
a USC team that will host Stanford
in a facility quite different from
Pauley Pavilion. The match will
take place in the Lyon Center, an
old building with very limited seat
ing capacity (1,200).
"It is going to be like playing in

a bad high school gym," Shaw said.
"It is definitely going to be tough."
USC has played well through
out the Pac-10 season and fmds
itself fighting for second place in
the conference with Washington
State and Washington. The team
that eventually finishes second in
the Pac-10 will probably earn a
spot among the top eight seeded
teams. A win over Stanford would
definitely help the Trojans in the
standings as well as give them con

fidence that they can overcome
top-notch competition.
If the postseason were to begin
today, Stanford would most likely
be the top seed in a region and
would probably host a second
round match as well as regional. A
loss would definitely jeopardize
that comfortable arrangement.
The Card dropped a game to
USC when the two teams met at
Maples Pavilion earlier this season.
After handilv defeating the Tro-

Jans in the first game, USC
stormed back to take game two 15-
11 and came dangerously close to
winning game three, losing 16-14.
Although Stanford seems to let
teams get dangerously close before
pulling out victories, the Cardinal
knows what it must do to win.
"We don't want to be peaking
right now," Shaw said. "We want
to play well enough to win, but we
want to be plaving our best volley
ball next month."
