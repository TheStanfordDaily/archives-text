Stanford, UCLA, women's
volleyball, enough said.
The Stanford women's volley
ball team (21-2, 13-1 Pacific 10
Conference) will travel to Los
Angeles to play UCLA (14-11, 6-
8) tonight and USC (16-6, 10-4)
tomorrow. Both matches begin
at 7 p.m.
The Cardinal and Bruins
have a rivalry like none other in
women's collegiate volleyball.
Although UCLA has struggled
this season due to injuries and
inconsistency, Stanford will not
expect a cakewalk when it visits
Pauley Pavilion.
"We are going to have to play
well," Stanford coach Don Shaw

said. "It is always a tough
match."
UCLA played one of its best
matches of the season when it
made its appearance on the
Farm a few weeks ago. The Bru
ins took the first game from
Stanford 15-10, and gave the
Card a run for its money before
losing the match in four games.
The Bruins will need to win this
match if they hope to end with a
winning conference record.
"This is a must-win situation
for UCLA," Shaw said. "If they
lose to us, they would probably
end up 9-9 in the conference and
just barely make the tourna
ment."
The Card will then travel to
