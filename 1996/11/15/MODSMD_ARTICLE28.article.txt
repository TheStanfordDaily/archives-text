You probably think your
Stanford administrative
officers are all antiquated
geezers who sit at their desks all
day either sipping coffee, kissing
alumni butt, finding ways to
spend your money or cracking
down on your illegal habits.
Well, I've got some news for
you. It's true. But they also like
college football, and that makes
up for all that other stuff.
Condoleezza Rice, the
provost, is a special case. You
probably don't know how lucky
you are to have such an intelli
gent young woman at the helm
of this rickety ship, but you're
about to find out just how eclec
tic her abilities truly are. This
week Condoleezza takes a hia
tus from the rigors of Stanford
administrative duties and
stoops to my level, that of a
broke bookie, to don her
prophetic garb and predict the
games in this week's NCAA
football picks of the week.
Oh, by the way, you might be
interested to know that I tried to
get some Boston College football
players to pick the games with
me, but they refused. I guess
they didn't like their odds since
they weren't going to be playing
in the games themselves.
Washington State at Stan

Did somebody say the word
"bowl"? Hmmm. A bowl. I had
flushed that idea down the toilet
weeks ago.
Sure enough, the Stanford
football squad may not be sleep
ing until 3 p.m. on New Year's
Day after all. With two more vic
tories to end the season and one
UCLA loss, the Cardinal will be
bowl-bound.
It sounds easy, doesn't it?
Well, a lot of things sound easy.
Like beating Oregon State, or
making that 10-foot basketball

shot at carnival stands to win a
stuffed Yogi the Bear.
The point is, it's going to be
a rough road â€” one that
makes Interstate 280 North to
San Francisco feel like the
smoothest drive on Earth.
Stanford's offense will be the
key to this game. Mike Mitchell
racked up 146 yards last week
end against USC, running
through the Trojan defense like
Evander Holyfield through cel
lophane. But the Cougars will
play some semblance of defense
tomorrow, which is more than
USC managed against the Car
dinal last week.
Washington State was
crushed by UCLA last weekend,
and it doesn't take a Jimmy the
Greek to see why. The Cougars
have no ground game. Period.
Thus, it is rational to assume
that in a game where Washing
ton State only throws the ball 25
times, the Cougars are going to
get mauled. That "mixing it up"
strategy makes about as much
sense as a sponge oceanliner.
Condoleezza gives Stanford
the nod in this game. Although I
doubt the Cardinal's bowl hopes
will materialize, I can prognosti
cate a Stanford victory against
the Cougars. Heck, if for no
other reason, it is the last home
football game I'll be able to see.
Condoleezza: Stanford by 7
Me: Stanford by 6
California at Oregon
The weenies across the Bay
should stick to anti-war demon
strations and leave the football
to those institutions capable of
playing the game. Although you
still hear some eternal optimist
drivel about "the best Cal foot
ball squad in years" emanating
from Berkeley, this season is as
lost as a Richard Allen Davis run
