You probably think your
Stanford administrative
officers are all antiquated
geezers who sit at their desks all
day either sipping coffee, kissing
alumni butt, finding ways to
spend your money or cracking
down on your illegal habits.
Well, I've got some news for
you. It's true. But they also like
college football, and that makes
up for all that other stuff.
Condoleezza Rice, the
provost, is a special case. You
probably don't know how lucky
you are to have such an intelli
gent young woman at the helm
of this rickety ship, but you're
about to find out just how eclec
tic her abilities truly are. This
week Condoleezza takes a hia
tus from the rigors of Stanford
administrative duties and
stoops to my level, that of a
broke bookie, to don her
prophetic garb and predict the
games in this week's NCAA
football picks of the week.
Oh, by the way, you might be
interested to know that I tried to
get some Boston College football
players to pick the games with
me, but they refused. I guess
they didn't like their odds since
they weren't going to be playing
in the games themselves.
Washington State at Stan
ford
Did somebody say the word
"bowl"? Hmmm. A bowl. I had
flushed that idea down the toilet
weeks ago.
Sure enough, the Stanford
football squad may not be sleep
ing until 3 p.m. on New Year's
Day after all. With two more vic
tories to end the season and one
UCLA loss, the Cardinal will be
bowl-bound.
It sounds easy, doesn't it?
Well, a lot of things sound easy.
Like beating Oregon State, or
making that 10-foot basketball

shot at carnival stands to win a
stuffed Yogi the Bear.
The point is, it's going to be
a rough road â€” one that
makes Interstate 280 North to
San Francisco feel like the
smoothest drive on Earth.
Stanford's offense will be the
key to this game. Mike Mitchell
racked up 146 yards last week
end against USC, running
through the Trojan defense like
Evander Holyfield through cel
lophane. But the Cougars will
play some semblance of defense
tomorrow, which is more than
USC managed against the Car
dinal last week.
Washington State was
crushed by UCLA last weekend,
and it doesn't take a Jimmy the
Greek to see why. The Cougars
have no ground game. Period.
Thus, it is rational to assume
that in a game where Washing
ton State only throws the ball 25
times, the Cougars are going to
get mauled. That "mixing it up"
strategy makes about as much
sense as a sponge oceanliner.
Condoleezza gives Stanford
the nod in this game. Although I
doubt the Cardinal's bowl hopes
will materialize, I can prognosti
cate a Stanford victory against
the Cougars. Heck, if for no
other reason, it is the last home
football game I'll be able to see.
Condoleezza: Stanford by 7
Me: Stanford by 6
California at Oregon
The weenies across the Bay
should stick to anti-war demon
strations and leave the football
to those institutions capable of
playing the game. Although you
still hear some eternal optimist
drivel about "the best Cal foot
ball squad in years" emanating
from Berkeley, this season is as
lost as a Richard Allen Davis run

Condoleezza
Rice
for the White House in 2000. They
played swell outside of the confer
ence and had a sparkling record to
show for it. Then they met their
first stiff competition and collapsed
like a house of cards in a tsunami.
But look who Cal is playing this
week. It's the Bears' best chance at
a victory until... well. .. until the
Bears play Stanford next week.
Nevertheless, Oregon's offense
(which gobbled up 310 yards rush
ing last week) is going to eviscerate
what some have boldly called the
"defense" of Cal (the proper classi
fication would be "a bunch of guys

standing around waiting for the
game to end.") It will be a high
scoring affair, and the Bears may
score enough points to match the
average IQ of the Cal squad.
Condoleezza: Oregon by 3
Me: Oregon by 9
UCLA at Arizona
All Stanford eyes will be on this
game, only because it could help
determine the Cardinal's postsea
son fate. UCLA wouldn't have
Stanford to worry about if it hadn 't
lost to the Cardinal two weeks ago.
The Bruins went into the game
roaring like a lion, but ended up
speaking with a whimper that
made Mike Tyson sound like
James Earl Jones in comparison.
Unfortunately for Stanford's

fate, Arizona scores points like
Rodney Dangerfield gets respect.
While Condoleezza thinks Arizona
can score enough to win by three,
I'm not sure the offensively impo
tent Wildcats will be able to
scrounge up three points at all.
Condoleezza: Arizona by 3
Me: UCLA by 7
Wisconsin at lowa
"This may well be an upset,"
Condoleezza says of the prospects
for a Badger victory. "But I am not
brave enough to pick it after
watching Wisconsin throw away so
many games this year."
The Badgers have thrown away
more games this year than the
Boston College football squad and
Shoeless Joe Jackson ever thought

about throwing. But they've got to
pull a big game out once this year
And who better to do it against
than the Hawkeyes, who are com
ing off a demoralizing shellacking
from Northwestern last week.
Just how confident am I in this
upset pick? I wouldn't dare put my
money on it. I'm only willing to sac
rifice my flimsy reputation as a
football clairvoyant.
