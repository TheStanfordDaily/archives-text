# Hoops prepares for No. 2 Alabama
## 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
If you thought you'd have to
wait until March for a big show
down in college hoops, you were
wrong.
This Sunday the top two
women's teams in the nation face
off at Maples Pavilion. The No. 1
Stanford women's basketball team
will start its season against second
ranked Alabama in the State Farm
Tipoff Classic at 11:30 am. Fol
lowing the game at 2 p.m. is No. 5
Connecticut against eighth-ranked
Western Kentucky.
The last (and first) meeting
between Stanford and Alabama
was a heated overtime victory for
Stanford in last year's NCAA tour
nament. The Crimson Tide chal
lenged the Card for a full 45 min
utes in the West Regional Semifi
nal in Seattle and almost ended
Stanford's run for the Final Four.
"They have revenge in their
minds," said junior center / for
ward Olympia Scott. "We knew we
could have played better [last
year]. We know that being No. 1 is
what every team wants. When
you're at the top everyone's going
for you."
Despite trailing by as many as
eight late in the second half, Stan
ford pulled out a win as junior for
ward Naomi Mulitauaopele hit a 6-
foot jumper with 27 seconds left in
overtime to give the Cardinal the
78-76 win. Mulitauaopele played

exceptionally well for Stanford in
the overtime period, scoring all
four of the team's overtime points
in a scrappy end to a somewhat
sloppy game.
The game was definitely not a
smooth victory for Stanford.
Despite pouring in a team-high 27
points, senior forward Kate Star
bird had one of her worst defensive
performances on the year and
fouled out with under 2 minutes
left in regulation and the team
trailing by three. But senior point
guard Jamila Wideman nailed a
three-pointer with 58 seconds left
to send the game to overtime
where Mulitauaopele took over.
"I'm going to try not to tackle
any players this year," Starbird
said. "I think we're a better team;
it ought to be a real exciting game.
It'll show us where we are [this
year]."
But the Cardinal will not be fac
ing the same team it faced in Seat
tle. Alabama is bigger and better
this season than it has been in
years. The Tide lost just one
starter off last season's 24-8 squad
but replaced her with 6-foot-2
senior center Yolanda Watkins.
Watkins was Alabama's leading
scorer two years ago and would
have started last season had she
been healthy. As it turned out,
Watkins, who is a two-time All-
Southeastern Conference selec
tion, missed the 1995-96 campaign
