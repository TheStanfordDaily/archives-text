# Hoops prepares for No. 2 Alabama
## 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
If you thought you'd have to
wait until March for a big show
down in college hoops, you were
wrong.
This Sunday the top two
women's teams in the nation face
off at Maples Pavilion. The No. 1
Stanford women's basketball team
will start its season against second
ranked Alabama in the State Farm
Tipoff Classic at 11:30 am. Fol
lowing the game at 2 p.m. is No. 5
Connecticut against eighth-ranked
Western Kentucky.
The last (and first) meeting
between Stanford and Alabama
was a heated overtime victory for
Stanford in last year's NCAA tour
nament. The Crimson Tide chal
lenged the Card for a full 45 min
utes in the West Regional Semifi
nal in Seattle and almost ended
Stanford's run for the Final Four.
"They have revenge in their
minds," said junior center / for
ward Olympia Scott. "We knew we
could have played better [last
year]. We know that being No. 1 is
what every team wants. When
you're at the top everyone's going
for you."
Despite trailing by as many as
eight late in the second half, Stan
ford pulled out a win as junior for
ward Naomi Mulitauaopele hit a 6-
foot jumper with 27 seconds left in
overtime to give the Cardinal the
78-76 win. Mulitauaopele played

exceptionally well for Stanford in
the overtime period, scoring all
four of the team's overtime points
in a scrappy end to a somewhat
sloppy game.
The game was definitely not a
smooth victory for Stanford.
Despite pouring in a team-high 27
points, senior forward Kate Star
bird had one of her worst defensive
performances on the year and
fouled out with under 2 minutes
left in regulation and the team
trailing by three. But senior point
guard Jamila Wideman nailed a
three-pointer with 58 seconds left
to send the game to overtime
where Mulitauaopele took over.
"I'm going to try not to tackle
any players this year," Starbird
said. "I think we're a better team;
it ought to be a real exciting game.
It'll show us where we are [this
year]."
But the Cardinal will not be fac
ing the same team it faced in Seat
tle. Alabama is bigger and better
this season than it has been in
years. The Tide lost just one
starter off last season's 24-8 squad
but replaced her with 6-foot-2
senior center Yolanda Watkins.
Watkins was Alabama's leading
scorer two years ago and would
have started last season had she
been healthy. As it turned out,
Watkins, who is a two-time All-
Southeastern Conference selec
tion, missed the 1995-96 campaign

after having knee surgery in
August 1995 but returns stronger
than ever for her final year.
Creating a powerful inside game
with Watkins is first-team Kodak
Ail-American Shalonda Enis. Enis
led the team last season and scored
a 30 points in the battle against the
Card — the most Stanford allowed
a single player to score all year. In
addition, Alabama picked up three
junior college players during the
offseason, including the 1996 play
er of the year, Nartausha Mills
from Trinity Valley.
"They're a very athletic team,"
said Stanford head coach Tara

VanDerveer. "They've had a lot of
success. They're very quick and
have good experience. They have a
great one-two punch from their big
players. They play well together;
they're talented at every position.
It's going to be very tough."
The game will definitely be a
heated battle. These two teams
have the experience and the fire to
fill it up for 40 minutes, and the
contest should be nothing short of
exciting. An early No. 1 ranking
may be at stake, but the Cardinal is
more concerned with gauging how
it is playing right now.
"I think [our team] wants to
play tough competition," Van-
Derveer said. It's a win-win situa
tion for [both teams]. We get a
chance to see where we are. It's on
national TV, and it's the first game

of the year. It's going to be really
exciting, and we'll be ready."
Stanford got an early warmup
for Sunday's contest in last night's
exhibition game against Slovakia
Slovan Bratislava. Despite a few
scoreless spells and poor shooting
from three-point range (one for
13), the Cardinal controlled most
of the game and pulled out a deci
sive 81-61 victory.
Stanford spread the wealth with
four players in double figures
Scott led the team with 15 and was
followed closely by Mulitauaopele
with 14. Starbird and junior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard each had
11. Freshmen Milena Flores and
Christina Batastiru saw a lot of
playing time in the absence of
Wideman and managed to put up
nine and seven points respectively.
