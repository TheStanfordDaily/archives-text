### Ben Freda 
A group of students who spear
headed the pre-election struggle
against Proposition 209 continued
the fight yesterday with a loud and
visible protest in White Plaza and a
march to Palo Alto.
Although the measure — some
times called the California Civil
Rights Initiative — passed by a sig
nificant margin in the Nov. 5 elec
tion, the students said they felt
larger issues of discrimination re
main to be addressed.
Prop. 209 "represents a nation
wide wave of legislation that's tak
ing aim at minorities all over," said
sophomore Francisco Najera.
"People are no longer seeing the
benefits of minorities and diversi
ty."
Armed with signs that screamed
"Hell no on 209!" and "Who pushed
rewind?," the group held a rally at
noon in White Plaza and then
marched through campus and into
downtown Palo Alto.
Student protesters were given a
chance to voice their views at the
rally.
As the small hut vigilant group
of students who mobilized in front
of the Claw began to chant "209,
no! Affirmative action, yes!," the
throng grew stronger in number
and volume.
During a short rally, students
gave speeches imploring their
peers to get involved. By the end of
the rally, the group had swelled to
more than 40 students.

Afterward, the group moved out
with chants of "Fight 209 and the
status quo" and "Justice now!" and
began a slow march down Palm
Drive and University Avenue.
Waving signs that read, "Honk
if you support us," the group of pro
testers, escorted by a pair of police
officers on motorcycles, reached a

crescendo in Palo Alto, where
passers-by leaned out of windows
and shop doors.
One elderly man on his lunch
break bragged to his business part
ner, "209. Yeah, I voted against
that, too."
After spending about 30 min
utes marching downtown, the pro

testers returned to White Plaza
There, the protest leaders spoke
about "a nationwide attack on di
versity."
"Just because at Stanford wc

mean everything is OK," sopho

don't live in isolation. We have to
fight in solidarity with all the

"We are fighting in support of
Berkeley and their struggles," af
firmed Najera. Several students at
UC-Berkeley last week were ar

sage of the proposition and an end
to affirmative action in the UC sys
tem.
The protesters said they were
pleased that Stanford will continue
to use affirmative action in its ad
missions procedures.

of the controversy is the improved

one of the speakers. "We must con
tinue that communication."
After the rally, sophomore
N'Kenge Haines said she feels
fighting for minority rights is her
responsibility.
"It's an important fight for me,
both as a minority and a woman,"
she said. "It's something I should
do, something my relatives did for

me.
