# Stanford sends wrestlers to Oregon
## 
### James Greene 
The Stanford wrestling team is traveling in
full force to Ashland, Ore., this weekend for the
Southern Oregon Open. The relatively young
team plans to use the meet to assert its place in
the Pacific 10 Conference and whet the younger
wrestlers' appetites for greater competition
down the road.
In addition to Stanford, the Open will host
Oregon, Oregon State, UC-Davis and several
junior colleges, as well as any amateurs or pro
fessionals from the area. The experienced Ore
gon is the favorite in the meet, with Oregon
State close behind. However, head coach Chris
Horpel is confident that the Cardinal can hold
its own, especially after soundly defeating UC-
Davis last week.
The Cardinal redshirts will have the oppor

tunity to wrestle unattached, so they will gain
college-level experience without sacrificing a
year of eligibility. Horpel plans to use the tour
nament to gauge the Cardinal men's level of
conditioning and their tournament fitness.
The tournament is structured to help the
various teams at this early point in the season.
The tourney is double elimination and each
round will be one minute shorter than normal.
"The environment will be laid back so it will
be a good test without pressure," said senior
team captain Ryan Barnes.
Horpel agreed. "If the Pac-10 and NCAA
tournaments are like a midterm and a final, this
meet is like a pop quiz," he said.
Horpel makes no commotion about the com
petition, although he recognizes the importance
in offering the relatively inexperienced Cardinal
a chance to wrestle.

"I want to prove myself, and I look forward to
hanging in there," said Adam Tirapelle, one of
the freshman redshirts eager to make his debut
at tomorrow's meet, as this is one of the few
tournaments the redshirts will be allowed to
enter.
Senior team captain Bryan Vaniman, Stan
ford's one returning Pac-10 meet scorer, is more
relaxed. "This is a good way to get the season
started and to test how we're doing," he said.
"This is a young team and an unproved team,
but there is a lot of heart and spirit and unity,
and it will pay off," Vaniman said.
The whole team looks forward to starting
the tournament season with momentum.
Junior Chris Seijak emphasized the impor
tance of doing well early. "This year is all about
proving to people that Stanford is a contender,"
he said.
