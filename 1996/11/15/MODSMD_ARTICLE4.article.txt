# Hospital merger plan seeks approval today
## 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
The long-proposed merger between Stan
ford Health Services and UC-San Francisco's
Medical Center is on the brink of approval.
After receiving the go-ahead from a com
mittee of the UC Board of Regents on
Wednesday, it will go before the full Board of
Regents and Stanford's Board of Trustees
today.
The committee recommendation calls for
the merger to be effective by July.
The proposal has the strong backing of
both Stanford and UCSF officials, and the
only major declared opposition it faces is from
unions representing UCSF employees.
The merger would combine the clinical op-

erations of the two centers
while leaving the medical
schools separate. It would
create a private, nonprofit
corporation called UCSF
Stanford Health Care,
which will be run by a board
containing both Stanford
trustees and officials and
UC regents, although nei
ther university will have a

majority.
Both Stanford and UCSF administrators
have been very enthusiastic about the merg
er, saying it will help both sides compete bet
ter financially and improve their clinical and


Casper
academic operations. Unions con
tend, however, that the private
nature of the merged company
will lead to understaffing and di
minished quality of care at UCSF.
In a statement released
Wednesday, Stanford President
Gerhard Casper said the merger
would "best safeguard teaching,
research and high-quality acade
mic health care in the Bay Area."
A third-party review commis
sioned by UCSF was equally fa
vorable about the business
prospects of the merger, conclud
ing that the merged entity would
have "a source of competitive ad
vantage through the coordination
of clinical and academic activities"
between the two schools.
The report also stressed that
UCSF's clinical and educational
activities could be improved and
expanded given the stronger fi
nancial standing it would gain as
part of the merged company.
Many union officials and others
disagree with this assessment, six
of them strongly enough to be ar
rested during protests at Wednes
day's meeting.
Jelger Kalmijn, president of
the University Professional and
Technical Employees union, was
among those arrested. He called
the merger "a scandal," which
would have "very serious nega
tive effects" on health care in the
area.
Kalmijn stressed that his
union, which represents about
1,000 workers at the UCSF Med
ical Center, is primarily concerned
with levels of patient care. He sug
gested that the merger was finan

daily motivated, without ade
quate concern for patients.
"If you go to the meetings of
[merger proponents]," he said,
"you would never guess they were
running a hospital."
The critical problem he sees is
that cost-cutting might lead to
harsh restrictions on care and lay
offs that might mean under
staffing.
The regents hope to be able to
rehire 95 percent of affected em
ployees, according to UC
spokesman Rick Malaspina. The
third-party review suggested that
UCSF after the merger would be
able to "grow its clinical volume
and therefore support more
health care workers relative to
UCSF Medical Center on a stand
alone basis."
Kalmijn disagreed, noting that
the proposal as it stands contains
no guarantee of rehiring, nor any
provision for salary and staffing
levels or pension benefits.
"People who are overworked
and underpaid don't give the same
quality of health care," Kalmijn
said. Unlike UCSF, few Stanford
Medical Center employees have
union representation.
Kalmijn added that his union
was opposed to the whole idea of
turning UCSF over to private con
trol, which he called part of "the
corporatization of health care,"
which emphasized financial over
medical concerns.
He added he is "not opposed to
working with Stanford" on a clini
cal basis but that the collaboration
had to be responsible to the public.
Several regents also expressed
concern at a meeting last spring
about whether they had the legal
authority to release control to a
private corporation.
Casper said in July that "rather

than enter into a quasi-state enti
ty, Stanford would end the negoti
ations and remain separate."
Unions have also objected to
what they perceive as undue haste
and secrecy surrounding the
merger. Kalmijn charged that the
regents had failed to either con
sult or inform the unions and the
public before acting.
"There's no compelling finan
cial reason for UCSF to rush into
this," he said, suggesting that the
regents wait and gather opinions
from unions, legislators and the
community in general. He said
several groups had valuable con
tributions, citing AIDS activists in
San Francisco as an example.
Malaspina said the regents
have been "as open as they can be
in listening to concerns" but ad
mitted that there had not been full
discussions with the unions.
Stanford's position, as stated
by Casper in July, is that the
merger had to go ahead without
much delay because Stanford has
"postponed very important re
cruitments and capital invest
ments pending the outcome of the
merger discussions."
Kalmijn also said the regents
had not provided unions and the
public with enough information
about what the merger will
mean.
"They won't even let us look at
the papers," he said, referring to
financial documents about SHS
and UCSF. The union is suing to
gain access to the documents,
which Malaspina insisted were
confidential because of Stanford's
private status.
Kalmijn cited this as an exam
ple of how little responsibility to
the public a privatized corpora
tion would have. He said that in
addition to the disclosure lawsuit.

he also looks for action from the
state's Public Employee Relations
Board.
The board filed a complaint in
September charging that UCSF
had failed to bargain with the
union. The complaint has to go
through a board hearing, which
Kalmijn expects to happen in the
next two months. After that, it can
be appealed to Superior Court. If
upheld, the complaint could force
a reversal of the merger, Kalmijn
said.
He also noted that the unions
hope to be able to appeal to state
legislators who "take a broader
view of public health care," men
tioning state Sen. Diane Watson
specifically as holding a public
forum about the merger on Nov.
25.
Today, the proposal will have to
obtain the approval of the full
Board of Regents, which voted 14-
4 in July to approve the governing
structure of the board. The struc
ture gave them a maximum stake
of 30 percent in the merged com
pany.
It must also pass a vote of the
SHS board of directors and a
three-member subcommittee of
the Stanford Board of Trustees,
which has been given final author
ity to approve or veto the measure
on Stanford's behalf.
According to a statement from
the UC President's Office, the
final step after approval is to ob
tain agreements about how the
merged company will support the
medical schools, establish pay
scales for doctors and academic
employees and go about assuming
the assets and liabilities of SHS
and UCSF Medical Center.

UCSF after the merger would be
able to "grow its clinical volume
and therefore support more
health care workers relative to
UCSF Medical Center on a stand
alone basis."
Kalmijn disagreed, noting that
the proposal as it stands contains
no guarantee of rehiring, nor any
provision for salary and staffing
levels or pension benefits.
"People who are overworked
and underpaid don't give the same
quality of health care," Kalmijn
said. Unlike UCSF, few Stanford
Medical Center employees have
union representation.
Kalmijn added that his union
was opposed to the whole idea of
turning UCSF over to private con
trol, which he called part of "the
corporatization of health care,"
which emphasized financial over
medical concerns.
He added he is "not opposed to
working with Stanford" on a clini
cal basis but that the collaboration
had to be responsible to the public.
Several regents also expressed
concern at a meeting last spring
about whether they had the legal
authority to release control to a
private corporation.
Casper said in July that "rather

than enter into a quasi-state enti
ty, Stanford would end the negoti
ations and remain separate."
Unions have also objected to
what they perceive as undue haste
and secrecy surrounding the
merger. Kalmijn charged that the
regents had failed to either con
sult or inform the unions and the
public before acting.
"There's no compelling finan
cial reason for UCSF to rush into
this," he said, suggesting that the
regents wait and gather opinions
from unions, legislators and the
community in general. He said
several groups had valuable con
tributions, citing AIDS activists in
San Francisco as an example.
Malaspina said the regents
have been "as open as they can be
in listening to concerns" but ad
mitted that there had not been full
discussions with the unions.
Stanford's position, as stated
by Casper in July, is that the
merger had to go ahead without
much delay because Stanford has
"postponed very important re
cruitments and capital invest
ments pending the outcome of the
merger discussions."
Kalmijn also said the regents
had not provided unions and the
public with enough information
about what the merger will
mean.
"They won't even let us look at
the papers," he said, referring to
financial documents about SHS
and UCSF. The union is suing to
gain access to the documents,
which Malaspina insisted were
confidential because of Stanford's
private status.
Kalmijn cited this as an exam
ple of how little responsibility to
the public a privatized corpora
tion would have. He said that in
addition to the disclosure lawsuit.

he also looks for action from the
state's Public Employee Relations
Board.
The board filed a complaint in
September charging that UCSF
had failed to bargain with the
union. The complaint has to go
through a board hearing, which
Kalmijn expects to happen in the
next two months. After that, it can
be appealed to Superior Court. If
upheld, the complaint could force
a reversal of the merger, Kalmijn
said.
He also noted that the unions
hope to be able to appeal to state
legislators who "take a broader
view of public health care," men
tioning state Sen. Diane Watson
specifically as holding a public
forum about the merger on Nov.
25.
Today, the proposal will have to
obtain the approval of the full
Board of Regents, which voted 14-
4 in July to approve the governing
structure of the board. The struc
ture gave them a maximum stake
of 30 percent in the merged com
pany.
It must also pass a vote of the
SHS board of directors and a
three-member subcommittee of
the Stanford Board of Trustees,
which has been given final author
ity to approve or veto the measure
on Stanford's behalf.
According to a statement from
the UC President's Office, the
final step after approval is to ob
tain agreements about how the
merged company will support the
medical schools, establish pay
scales for doctors and academic
employees and go about assuming
the assets and liabilities of SHS
and UCSF Medical Center.

The long-proposed merger between Stan
ford Health Services and UC-San Francisco's
Medical Center is on the brink of approval.
After receiving the go-ahead from a com
mittee of the UC Board of Regents on
Wednesday, it will go before the full Board of
Regents and Stanford's Board of Trustees
today.
The committee recommendation calls for
the merger to be effective by July.
The proposal has the strong backing of
both Stanford and UCSF officials, and the
only major declared opposition it faces is from
unions representing UCSF employees.
The merger would combine the clinical op-

erations of the two centers
while leaving the medical
schools separate. It would
create a private, nonprofit
corporation called UCSF
Stanford Health Care,
which will be run by a board
containing both Stanford
trustees and officials and
UC regents, although nei
ther university will have a

majority.
Both Stanford and UCSF administrators
have been very enthusiastic about the merg
er, saying it will help both sides compete bet
ter financially and improve their clinical and


Casper
academic operations. Unions con
tend, however, that the private
nature of the merged company
will lead to understaffing and di
minished quality of care at UCSF.
In a statement released
Wednesday, Stanford President
Gerhard Casper said the merger
would "best safeguard teaching,
research and high-quality acade
mic health care in the Bay Area."
A third-party review commis
sioned by UCSF was equally fa
vorable about the business
prospects of the merger, conclud
ing that the merged entity would
have "a source of competitive ad
vantage through the coordination
of clinical and academic activities"
between the two schools.
The report also stressed that
UCSF's clinical and educational
activities could be improved and
expanded given the stronger fi
nancial standing it would gain as
part of the merged company.
Many union officials and others
disagree with this assessment, six
of them strongly enough to be ar
rested during protests at Wednes
day's meeting.
Jelger Kalmijn, president of
the University Professional and
Technical Employees union, was
among those arrested. He called
the merger "a scandal," which
would have "very serious nega
tive effects" on health care in the
area.
Kalmijn stressed that his
union, which represents about
1,000 workers at the UCSF Med
ical Center, is primarily concerned
with levels of patient care. He sug
gested that the merger was finan

daily motivated, without ade
quate concern for patients.
"If you go to the meetings of
[merger proponents]," he said,
"you would never guess they were
running a hospital."
The critical problem he sees is
that cost-cutting might lead to
harsh restrictions on care and lay
offs that might mean under
staffing.
The regents hope to be able to
rehire 95 percent of affected em
ployees, according to UC
spokesman Rick Malaspina. The
third-party review suggested that
UCSF after the merger would be
able to "grow its clinical volume
and therefore support more
health care workers relative to
UCSF Medical Center on a stand
alone basis."
Kalmijn disagreed, noting that
the proposal as it stands contains
no guarantee of rehiring, nor any
provision for salary and staffing
levels or pension benefits.
