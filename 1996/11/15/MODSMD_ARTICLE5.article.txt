mains optimistic about the
direction in which the Uni

In a recent interview,
the economics professor
touched on issues such as
the new Comparative Stud

Program and the search for new faculty in
the School of Humanities and Sciences.
"CSRE is potentially a very exciting pro
gram," Shoven said.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo, who has been

serving as chair of the steering committee
designing the new ethnic studies major, will
chair the program, Shoven added.
The Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies will present its recommendations for the
new interdisciplinary program to the Facul
ty Senate Thursday.
"CSRE is an example of a program that
came about from student pressure,"
Shoven said "I don't know whether it
wouldn't have come about anyway," but
hopefully it will "become a program we're
proud of"
This shows that "students are engaged
and can be influential in affecting Stan
ford's programs," he said. An ethnic studies
