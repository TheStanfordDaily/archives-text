## Shoven discusses progress made in creating ethnic studies program, hiring new faculty 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences John Shoven re
mains optimistic about the
direction in which the Uni
versity is moving.
In a recent interview,
the economics professor
touched on issues such as
the new Comparative Stud
ies in Race and Ethnicity

Program and the search for new faculty in
the School of Humanities and Sciences.
"CSRE is potentially a very exciting pro
gram," Shoven said.
History Prof. A 1 Camarillo, who has been

serving as chair of the steering committee
designing the new ethnic studies major, will
chair the program, Shoven added.
The Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies will present its recommendations for the
new interdisciplinary program to the Facul
ty Senate Thursday.
"CSRE is an example of a program that
came about from student pressure,"
Shoven said "I don't know whether it
wouldn't have come about anyway," but
hopefully it will "become a program we're
proud of"
This shows that "students are engaged
and can be influential in affecting Stan
ford's programs," he said. An ethnic studies


Shoven
major has been developed partly
in response to more than 25 years
of student demands for Chicano
Studies, Asian American Studies
and Native American Studies pro
grams to supplement the already
existing African and Afro-Ameri
can Studies Program.
Shoven also said he hopes
Stanford will host a conference on
race relations in 1999.
The CSRE faculty will plan the
event, which ideally would involve
schools from around the country.
The purpose of the conference will
be to offer a "quantitative point of
view and not just passionate" in
formation, Shoven said.
Data on things such as income
gaps, family formations and edu

cational levels are only "some sub
jects that are quantifiable," he
added.
Pertinent questions about race
relations, such as discrimination
and affirmative action, need
quantitative information in order
to be evaluated effectively,
Shoven said.
The conference will show
"where we stand at the turn of the
century in America,"he said. "My
hope is that people in 2010 ask,
'Have things improved since the
Stanford conference?' This will
hopefully be a landmark that peo
ple can later refer to.
"That would put us on the
map," he said.
In other curricular areas, the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences is currently conducting a
search for two new directors —
one for the Program in Science,
Technology and Society and the

other for the Program in African
and Afro-American Studies.
"There are roughly 30 searches
for new faculty going on in the
school," Shoven said. Usually, Hu
manities and Sciences hires around
20 to 25 new faculty every year.
According to Shoven, the
search for the new STS director is
going well.
"Several departments have
made recommendations. We're
now putting together a committee
to review [them]," he said.
To help review the current sta
tus of teaching, new evaluations
will be on line at the end of the quar
ter, Shoven said. In addition, he is
cooperating with the ASSU in
bringing a course guide to students.
The course guide is meant to be
a candid evaluation of courses of
fered at Stanford. It is accessible
over the Internet and will be com
pletely up and running by next

quarter, ASSU President Bill
Shen said.
Shoven also said he was pleased
at the positive reception to the re
cently introduced minor program.
He recommended that students
declare a minor instead of double
majoring.
Double-majoring is often so
hard that students "tend to cut
corners in both of [their majors],"
Shoven said. "A student can still
do a strong major with plenty of
room for a minor."
He said he hopes that 75 per
cent to 80 percent of students de
clare minors in the future. "Most
people would be well-advised to
keep two doors open," he said.
Shoven's optimism about the
state of the University was clear.
"It's great to be a Stanford stu
dent," Shoven said. Stanford "has
a direction that people are happy
with and proud of."
