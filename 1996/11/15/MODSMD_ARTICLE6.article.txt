musical curiosity and wonder of
the Stanford community with his
ability to blend styles of music.
One of his great interests is in

ensemble drumming with roots in
traditional Japanese drumming.

modern and hopes that under his
direction musical programming at
Stanford will develop.

repertoire, and we will continue to
do so," Sano explained. "However,
there is a rich and, in this country,
largely untapped body of new and
world choral music waiting to be
explored, and we will add this to
our offerings."

Sano will direct the Stanford
Chamber Chorale in the first con
cert of the season tonight at 8 p.m.

"Music of Mystery and Meditation,"
includes works by John Tavener,
Arvo Part and Samuel Barber.
