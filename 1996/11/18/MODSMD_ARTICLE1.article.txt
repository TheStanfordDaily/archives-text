# Barnes' last tune
## Band conductor leaving Stanford after 33 years 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
The haunting sound of a single trumpet was
echoed by the call of another. Stanford Stadium re
mained silently transfixed as the rest of the Stanford
Band swelled into the "Star Spangled Banner."
Under the drizzling rain, a man atop a ladder brought
the song to its conclusion and lowered his baton.
A familiar figure on his football field perch, Dr.
Arthur P. Barnes conducted the Band at Saturday's
game. After 33 years, Barnes stepped down the ladder
for the last time.
"I never thought I'd stay here this long," Barnes
said. "I was supposed to start an indoor concert band
and do the Band on the side."
Instead, Barnes has helped guide the Band
through its revolutionary transformation. Ironically,

Barnes was not greeted with such a harmonious wel
come.
In 1963, when Barnes replaced the popular Jules
Shuchat as director, the Band refused to play at the
first two home football games.
Indeed, the star-spangled moment in the Stadium
echoed back to the first time Barnes climbed up and
conducted the Band — at Big Game, eight days after
John F. Kennedy was assassinated. His powerful,
unique arrangement of the national anthem earned
the respect of the Band members
Barnes convinced the Band to play by agreeing to
let the members remain independent.
"The Band was student-run when I came," Barnes
said. "They did not wish to be like anyone else. They
already had their red coats, instead of the traditional

marching uniform."
Barnes helped perpetuate the
Band's scarlet reputation by ar
ranging its equally immoral rock
music.
"They wanted to be the world's
largest rock 'n' roll band. But they
had no one to write their music for
them. So that's what I did," Barnes
said. "After all, that's the point of
getting together, isn't it? Playing
music."
Barnes has arranged more than
400 songs, from classical to con
temporary, from "Bill Tell" to "All

Right Now" — the victory song in
which jumping up at the correct
moment marks a true Stanford
student. Not always, though, said
Barnes.
"During the '60s, the student
body was getting rid of a lot of tra
dition," Barnes said. "In keeping
with that, the Band got rid of a lot
of songs, except for a few like 'Come
Join the Band' and the 'Stanford
Hymn.' "
Former Drum Major George
Lawry asked Barnes to arrange
"All Right Now," which was not
initially accepted by the Band or
the staff.
"Anything new is suspicious,
not auspicious," Barnes said with s
grin. However, the tune has kept

Stanford students and alumni
alike rocking through the ages.
In his arrangements, Barnes
also plays with melodic puns, by
juxtaposing two tunes together.
"When the Queen of England
came to campus, I arranged a song
with 'God Save the Queen' and the
'Star Spangled Banner' to be played
simultaneously," Barnes said.
These days, student members
of the Band arrange most of the
music which piques piccolos and
motivates mellophones.
"I've helped train people in ar
ranging," Barnes said. "Now I'll
offer suggestions though, about
what's not quite right, what to fix.
But the Band makes their own de
cisions."

Senior Josh Schiller, the cur
rent band manager, recalled a time
when Barnes gave the Band advice
on its playing.
"Usually rehearsal is about as
chaotic as we are on field. But when
Dr. Barnes walked in, everyone
said, 'Be quiet, pay attention,'"
Schiller said. "He spent the next 20
minutes picking apart our song we
had been practicing. He's blunt,
but he's right."
Over the years, Barnes has seen
the style of the Band change,
though the evolution has always
carried on the spirit of youth and
innovation.
Prior to Barnes' arrival, "The
Band bordered on being a collection
of social miscreants. They were out
of the pale. They weren't even al
lowed into fraternities," Barnes
said. "A few year later, the Band be
came more representative of cam
pus, a slice-of-life with horns."
And in keeping with the experi
mental nature of the times, in the
era of polyester and funk, the Band
underwent a sex change during the
'70s — that is, female players were
admitted into the inner temple of
the Band.
"It was the last all-male bastion
on campus. Some of the old farts
complained, saying the Band was
going down the hill by letting in
women," Barnes said. "But I'd say
the quality of musicians is just as
good or even better now."
Male and female musicians alike
are part of the chaotic jumble that
sorts into huge patterns. Barnes
explained the method to their mad
ness.
"Scattering instead of marching
in traditional formation saves the
Band time getting on the field,"
Barnes said. "They can play more
tunes and put on more of a show."
Such a show occurred off the
field in 1994, when 21 members
played in front courthouse of the
O.J. Simpson trial. Mocking the
circus-like atmosphere of the pro
ceedings, Band members found
themselves on national television
and in the bad graces of the Depart
ment of Athletics.
Barnes, however, took these ac
tivities in stride, as he has all the
Band antics.

"The only thing that upset me is
that they didn't sound very good,"
Barnes said. "And they didn't
make it to practice."
Baines reflected on his experi
ences at Stanford, from serving as
faculty adviser to the Band, to lead
ing the symphonic band and the
chamber orchestra. He will contin
ue to direct these groups through
the end of spring quarter.
"I've met a lot of students. In
comparison, a professor teaching a
lecture class of 400 students can't
know everyone," Barnes said. "I've
been to weddings, second weddings
of former Band members and stu
dents. I've even seem some of the
children of some the guys who
came through the Band.
"That's when I figured that it
was time to get out, when the sec
ond wave came in,"he said, laugh
ing.
Schiller explained how Barnes
surfed the tumultuous waves of
Band history.
"What everyone enjoys about
Dr. Barnes is that he gives the
Band freedom," Schiller said. "It
takes someone special to give up
control. He's willing to sit in the
back seat and watch what hap
pens."
Although Barnes officially re
tired in 1993, he was recalled to ac
tive duty immediately.
"There was no break. I was
made professor emeritus and then
immediately went back to teaching
and conducting, " Barnes said.
Again, Barnes will remain on ac
tive duty in the music world. He
plans to continue conducting the
Livermore Symphony.
However, now he will have more
time for other projects.
"Now my evenings are free. I'll
travel more. And I'll write music on
the computer," Barnes said.
An interim director will be ap
pointed while the Music Depart
ment conducts a search for a suc
cessor.
"The new position will focus on
the performative, on directing,
rather than also teaching music
theory, as I did," Barnes said.
Barnes added, "It's not the end
of an era. It's the beginning of a
new one."

A familiar figure on his football field perch, Dr.
Arthur P. Barnes conducted the Band at Saturday's
game. After 33 years, Barnes stepped down the ladder
for the last time.
"I never thought I'd stay here this long," Barnes
said. "I was supposed to start an indoor concert band
and do the Band on the side."
Instead, Barnes has helped guide the Band
through its revolutionary transformation. Ironically,

Barnes was not greeted with such a harmonious wel
come.
In 1963, when Barnes replaced the popular Jules
Shuchat as director, the Band refused to play at the
first two home football games.

Barnes convinced the Band to play by agreeing to
let the members remain independent.

said. "They did not wish to be like anyone else. They

marching uniform."
Barnes helped perpetuate the
Band's scarlet reputation by ar
ranging its equally immoral rock
music.
"They wanted to be the world's
largest rock 'n' roll band. But they
had no one to write their music for
them. So that's what I did," Barnes
said. "After all, that's the point of
getting together, isn't it? Playing
music."
Barnes has arranged more than
400 songs, from classical to con
temporary, from "Bill Tell" to "All

Right Now" — the victory song in
which jumping up at the correct
moment marks a true Stanford
student. Not always, though, said
Barnes.
"During the '60s, the student
body was getting rid of a lot of tra
dition," Barnes said. "In keeping
with that, the Band got rid of a lot
of songs, except for a few like 'Come
Join the Band' and the 'Stanford
Hymn.' "
Former Drum Major George
Lawry asked Barnes to arrange
"All Right Now," which was not
initially accepted by the Band or
the staff.
"Anything new is suspicious,
not auspicious," Barnes said with s
grin. However, the tune has kept

Stanford students and alumni
alike rocking through the ages.
In his arrangements, Barnes
also plays with melodic puns, by
juxtaposing two tunes together.
"When the Queen of England
came to campus, I arranged a song
with 'God Save the Queen' and the
'Star Spangled Banner' to be played
simultaneously," Barnes said.
These days, student members
of the Band arrange most of the
music which piques piccolos and
motivates mellophones.
"I've helped train people in ar
ranging," Barnes said. "Now I'll
offer suggestions though, about
what's not quite right, what to fix.
But the Band makes their own de
cisions."

Senior Josh Schiller, the cur
rent band manager, recalled a time
when Barnes gave the Band advice
on its playing.
"Usually rehearsal is about as
chaotic as we are on field. But when
Dr. Barnes walked in, everyone
said, 'Be quiet, pay attention,'"
Schiller said. "He spent the next 20
minutes picking apart our song we
had been practicing. He's blunt,
but he's right."
Over the years, Barnes has seen
the style of the Band change,
though the evolution has always
carried on the spirit of youth and
innovation.
Prior to Barnes' arrival, "The
Band bordered on being a collection
of social miscreants. They were out
of the pale. They weren't even al
lowed into fraternities," Barnes
said. "A few year later, the Band be
came more representative of cam
pus, a slice-of-life with horns."
And in keeping with the experi
mental nature of the times, in the
era of polyester and funk, the Band
underwent a sex change during the
'70s — that is, female players were
admitted into the inner temple of
the Band.
"It was the last all-male bastion
on campus. Some of the old farts
complained, saying the Band was
going down the hill by letting in
women," Barnes said. "But I'd say
the quality of musicians is just as
good or even better now."
Male and female musicians alike
are part of the chaotic jumble that
sorts into huge patterns. Barnes
explained the method to their mad
ness.
"Scattering instead of marching
in traditional formation saves the
Band time getting on the field,"
Barnes said. "They can play more
tunes and put on more of a show."
Such a show occurred off the
field in 1994, when 21 members
played in front courthouse of the
O.J. Simpson trial. Mocking the
circus-like atmosphere of the pro
ceedings, Band members found
themselves on national television
and in the bad graces of the Depart
ment of Athletics.
Barnes, however, took these ac
tivities in stride, as he has all the
Band antics.

"The only thing that upset me is
that they didn't sound very good,"
Barnes said. "And they didn't
make it to practice."
Baines reflected on his experi
ences at Stanford, from serving as
faculty adviser to the Band, to lead
ing the symphonic band and the
chamber orchestra. He will contin
ue to direct these groups through
the end of spring quarter.
"I've met a lot of students. In
comparison, a professor teaching a
lecture class of 400 students can't
know everyone," Barnes said. "I've
been to weddings, second weddings
of former Band members and stu
dents. I've even seem some of the
children of some the guys who
came through the Band.
"That's when I figured that it
was time to get out, when the sec
ond wave came in,"he said, laugh
ing.
Schiller explained how Barnes
surfed the tumultuous waves of
Band history.
"What everyone enjoys about
Dr. Barnes is that he gives the
Band freedom," Schiller said. "It
takes someone special to give up
control. He's willing to sit in the
back seat and watch what hap
pens."
Although Barnes officially re
tired in 1993, he was recalled to ac
tive duty immediately.
"There was no break. I was
made professor emeritus and then
immediately went back to teaching
and conducting, " Barnes said.
Again, Barnes will remain on ac
tive duty in the music world. He
plans to continue conducting the
Livermore Symphony.
However, now he will have more
time for other projects.
"Now my evenings are free. I'll
travel more. And I'll write music on
the computer," Barnes said.
An interim director will be ap
pointed while the Music Depart
ment conducts a search for a suc
cessor.
"The new position will focus on
the performative, on directing,
rather than also teaching music
theory, as I did," Barnes said.
Barnes added, "It's not the end
of an era. It's the beginning of a
new one."
