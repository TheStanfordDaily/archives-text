## Russian rocket crashes Space probe narrowly misses Australia 
### 
HONOLULU (AP) - The United
States rushed into action yesterday as a
Russian space probe fired toward Mars
hurtled back to Earth, tracking its fall,
plotting its impact site and offering help
in the remote event of nuclear contami
nation.
In the end, the craft smashed harm
lessly into the atmosphere at 17,000
miles an hour over the southern Pacific
Ocean west of Chile. The U.S. Space
Command said it could not confirm
whether any objects survived re-entry.
President Clinton, here on a weekend
vacation, spent much of the day consult
ing with senior advisers about the matter.
"He did not have a very restful day,"
spokeswoman Mary Ellen Glynn said.
The president talked by telephone
with Prime Minister John Howard of
Australia.
Originally, there was concern the
impact site would be in east-central Aus
tralia. In that event, U.S. officials said
there was an "extremely unlikely" worst
case scenario in which four tiny genera
tors on board could release a small lethal
plutonium cloud.
When it became clear the rocket would
miss Australia, Robert Bell, a senior aide
on the White House National Security
Council, said, "If that's what happens
there's no danger to anyone and that's
very good news indeed."
Ironically, word of the expected crash
came one day before Clinton was sched
uled to fly to Australia on the first leg of a
10-day tour of Asia-Pacific nations.
The president, making his first visit to
Australia, was due to arrive in Sydney in
the southeast region of the country

tomorrow night, with subsequent stops
in nearby Canberra and Port Douglas on
the northeastern coast.
The unmanned Russian craft —
Mars '96 — got into trouble when it was
unable to break out of Earth orbit after
the failure of a fourth-stage booster
rocket.
From the start, the Space Command,
based in Colorado Springs, Colo., tracked
the re-entry path of the probe.
In Washington, Vice President A 1
Gore, White House chief of staff Leon
Panetta and National Security Adviser
Anthony Lake coordinated the responses
of NASA, the Department of Energy and
the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
Bell said Clinton had offered Howard
assets of the Energy Department "to
locate, secure and recover any nuclear
material. This is similar to capabilities
that we offered to Canada a few years
back when another nuclear-powered
satellite came down."
U.S. officials also were in touch with
Russian authorities, including Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Bell said
both were on trips out of Moscow.
The probe lifted off Saturday night
from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in
Kazakstan.
The first three stages fired properly,
according to the space tracking center in
Evpatoriya, Ukraine.
The problems arose when a booster
rocket on the fourth stage failed to ignite,
the Interfax news agency said, quoting
one of the mission directors, Vladimir
Molodtsov.

A Russian rocket launched on Saturday was headed on a 60 mil
lion-mile mission to Mars. Officials lost contact with the $64-million
rocket yesterday after it failed to break out of Earth's orbit.
