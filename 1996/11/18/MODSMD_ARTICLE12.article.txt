# Texaco racism only 'tip of the iceberg'
## Other companies have similar problems, Texaco CEO says 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP> — The president of Texaco
says racial discrimination problems at his company
represent just the "tip of the iceberg" in corporate
America.
Other company leaders should examine their
management and workers at their companies for
similar signs of racism, Peter Bijur, Texaco's presi
dent and chief executive officer, said yesterday on
CNN's "Late Edition."
"I would suggest that we are just seeing the tip of
the iceberg here," said Bijur, whose company agreed
last week to pay $176.1 million to settle a racial dis
crimination lawsuit.
"It's important to drill down below that very tip and
get down into what's beneath and find out what's going
on. That's what I've done in the last two weeks, and
that's what I think need.s to be done."
Civil rights leaders echoed Bijur's concerns yes
terday, contending other companies have similar
problems that haven't been uncovered.
"The difference is. in the case of Texaco, they got
caught," civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said yes
terday on CBS' "Face the Nation." "But there are
other companies that have not been caught."
NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said lessons
learned from the lawsuit can be applied even more
broadly.
"The message clearly resonates beyond corporate
America," Mfume said on "Late Edition." "It's not
just the private sector. It's also the public sector.
It's not just Texaco, but it's what's happening at
Amoco and other places."
