# U.S. reassesses sending forces to Zaire
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
administration is reassessing the
need to send American troops to
Zaire after dramatic changes on
the ground sent hundreds of thou
sands of Rwandan refugees
streaming homeward, officials said
yesterday.
"The need for humanitarian
relief as I see it has not gone away,"
Defense Secretary William Perry
said yesterday on NBC's "Meet the
Press."
But he said, "The nature of the
need is changing dramatically by
this migration of refugees from
Zaire into Rwanda."
President Clinton's Friday
announcement that the United

States agreed "in principle" to sup
ply some 4,000 troops to a multina
tional force coincided with a mas
sive movement of people out of the
camps along the Zaire-Rwandan
border.
Madeleine Albright, the U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations,
said forward troops would not be
sent to Rwanda, and the plan to
send 1,000 Americans to secure the
airport around the Goma, Zaire,
camp may be outdated.
"We may just now be able to do
only the logistics support to make
sure that the humanitarian assis
tance is given properly," she said
on CNN's "Late Edition." She said
members of the proposed multina

tional force are to meet in Ger
many this week to assess the
changing situation.
Perry said no final decision has
been made on dispatching Ameri
can troops. He said 40 military offi
cers are now in Rwanda, where the
government has indicated that it
wants aid but considers a military
presence unnecessary.
Reconnaissance planes are
sending back details of population
movement.
The secretary said a decision is
expected in the next few days and
that a few thousand troops, mostly
logistics personnel, are ready to
leave on a day's notice.
He noted that 1,000 American

soldiers were sent into Zaire two
years ago during an outbreak of
cholera at the camps.
"We have responded when the
crisis occurs whenever the mili
tary's assistance that was needed
was uniquely able to deal with a sit
uation," he said. But he added that
"we are not a salvation army" and
"there may or may not be a unique
need for it now, and we are watch
ing it very closely."
The provisional plan specifies
that the United States send 1,000
troops to secure the airport near
Go ma and provide another 3,000
for logistics support. The Canadi
an-led mission is to last four
months.
