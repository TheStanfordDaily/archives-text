Army sex scandal heats up
WASHINGTON (AP) - More than 4,000
women have telephoned an Army hot line with
complaints of inappropriate sexual conduct
since revelations of a sex scandal involving
women recruits and their leaders at a Mary
land base.
"Yes, it is the worst we have seen, and we
never expected it," Secretary of the Army
Togo West said yesterday, describing grow
ing evidence of sexual harassment in the
Army.
West, interviewed on CBS' "Face the
Nation," said well over 4,000 complaints
had been filed over the Army hot line. The
Army intends to follow up in about 550

cases, he said.
The hot line was set up after four drill
sergeants and a captain at the Aberdeen Prov
ing Ground in Maryland were charged with
raping or sexually harassing at least a dozen
female recruits.
In a separate case at the Fort Leonard
Wood training base in Missouri, four noncom
missioned officers were charged last week with
violating the Army's absolute ban on personal
relationships with trainees.
West said that of the complaints received so
far, about 74 percent were from places other
than Aberdeen.
He said there was no indication that peo
ple in authority were aware of the alleged
sex crimes at Aberdeen before women sol

diers made the allegations in early Septem
ber.

FARGO, N.D. (AP) â€” Heavy, wind
whipped snow shut down major highways in
eastern North Dakota for part of yesterday,
stranding travelers and blocking streets with
stuck vehicles.
As much as 13 inches of snow fell overnight
in Fargo and adjoining Moorhead, Minn., and
11 inches at Grand Forks, the National
Weather Service estimated.
Wind gusted to 50 mph in parts of both
states. The northeastern corner of South
