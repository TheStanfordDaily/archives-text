'Life of the Mind' has the
potential to provide higher
level of intellectualization

Everybody knows that
the archetypal Stanford stu
dent is supposed to be more
than just a stellar student, but also
a gutsy athlete, an extracurricular
innovator and a driven pre-profes
sional ... all this plus a fun and
bright personality.
And while there may not be a
single student who actually com
bines all of these attributes, there
is no question that Stanford has a
reputation as a place overflowing
with shiny, happy, intelligent peo
ple. It is a reputation most Stan
ford students bask in and enjoy,
with good reason.
However, the "well-rounded"
reputation comes at a certain price,
a price that cannot easily be quan
tified. What Stanford loses with its
emphasis on "well-roundedness" is
a certain intellectual atmosphere, a
feeling that students care about
what they study outside the class
room.
Students here love to talk about
how busy they are, how difficult
this or that professor is and how
many pages the next paper is sup
posed to be. What gets lost in all
this talk about the structure of a
class is the content. Anybody who
has tried to extend a discussion
from section to the dining hall
knows the feeling.
Recognizing that Stanford needs
to boost its reputation as an intel
lectual community, the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions inau
gurated a program last spring
called "Life of the Mind." The idea
is to encourage the next generation
of "intellectual leaders" to come to
Stanford by exposing them to the
"intellectual journeys" of Universi
ty alumni and professors. At this
point, the program is aimed only at
high school students in Southern
California, but anyone who cares
about the intellectual atmosphere

at Stanford should hope that the
program expands nationwide.
Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sion and Financial Aids James
Montoya deserves credit for iden
tifying a problem in Stanford's
reputation and taking measures
to combat it. Of course, one
always has to worry about overre
acting to a perceived problem, but
there is little likelihood that the
relatively low-profile Life of the
Mind will radically change admis
sions patterns. After all, the last
thing anyone, least of all Montoya,
wants is for Stanford to lose its
reputation for well-balanced stu
dents.
The point of the program should
be to target those students who are
looking for a top liberal arts educa
tion and to convince them that
Stanford is the right place for
them.
Given Stanford's world
renowned (though often belea
guered) humanities and sciences
departments, admissions officers
should have little difficulty
demonstrating the quality of the
liberal arts at Stanford. But, given
the obvious disparity between the
resources spent on applied sci
ences and humanities depart
ments, admissions officers may
have a harder time convincing stu
dents that Stanford's top adminis
trators are committed to maintain
ing large, robust liberal arts pro
grams. That, however, is not a
problem for the admissions
department, but something that
top administrators like University
Provost Condoleezza Rice ought to
think about.
Perhaps the only problem with
the Life of the Mind program is its
reliance on PSAT scores to deter
mine which students to target.
High PSAT scores and real intel
lectual interest are not necessarily
well correlated. Hopefully, as the
program matures, a more accurate
reflection of intellectual interest
will be used to target those who
really want to be "intellectual lead
ers" of the future.
