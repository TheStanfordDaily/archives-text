## Co Ho still reigns supreme 
### 
FOR A LONG time, the Coffee
House has been Stanford's social
center. Students seeking refuge
from monotonous dorm life have gravi
tated there to eat, drink and be merry
while pretending to study.
The Co Ho was the only place on
campus that consistently provided a
social atmosphere. It was the only place
where you could order exotic caffeinat
ed beverages throughout the day. And
the Co Ho was the only on-campus
establishment with a liquor license.
But last week, a new player emerged
on the campus social scene when the
Chicken King, El Polio Rey, sauntered
into town rolling kegs and toting a
backpack full of burritos. While it is
clear that Polio's will corner Stanford's
burrito and quesadilla markets, one
must wonder what effect it will have on
Tresidder Union's social spectrum.
To its credit, Polio's will provide us
with cheap beer and food. Polio's also
has a cheery pastel-coated environment
and exceedingly friendly service. Per
haps most importantly, Polio's has
booths which "are pretty sweet,"
according to a savvy fifth-year sopho
more.
To its debt, Polio's lacks the demo
cratic system of musical selection which
is embraced by the Co Ho via its popu
lar jukebox. At Polio's, it is Big Brother,
not goatee dude, sorority sister or Joe
Euclid, deciding what you will listen to.
Another pro-Co Ho factor is its rotat

ing displays of student art. These dis
plays, which range from the kinder
gartenesque to the pornographic, are
generally interesting, and most impor
tantly, they are not fixed. You can
expect a new display every couple of
weeks at the Co Ho, while all Polio's can
provide is an enduring state of pasteloc
ity.
The physical space Polio's occupies
detracts from its ability to become a
social entity as well. While the Co Ho
has entrances on both sides of Tresid
der, Polio's has but one door. This is
important because one can easily pass
through the Co Ho, surveying its famil
iar landscape for social opportunities. If
none exist, you can easily continue on,
as though you were really walking
through.
This "discreet lurking" is not possi
ble at Polio's because it is essentially a
cul-de-sac. Most of its seating is con
tained in a room in the back, so that an
unsuccessful attempt to find friends is
followed by a disgraced retreat. In addi
tion to a diminished sense of self
esteem, your retreat may lead to jeers
and ridicule from Polio's paying cus
tomers, followed by the demoralizing
call of "come again" from an enthusias
tic employee.
Polio's also lacks the crucial social
catalyst of Pear Cider. Although cider is
negatively viewed by many as being
Zima's cooler cousin, it is good because
it brings people together for festivals of

imbibing which may not have occurred
otherwise.
Cider's fruity goodness encourages
people who were merely "passing
through" to sit down with their cider
swilling friends and partake of a pitch
er. Often, several people enjoying cider
will snowball into several tables full of
merriment. Without cider, Polio's can
not attain the same level of sponta
neous sociability as the Co Ho.
And what place is better to sit and
enjoy a pint of cider than one of the Co
Ho's plush sofas? The Co Ho's couches
and other nontraditional furniture
arrangements encourage people to stay
in one place for an extended period of
time, while Polio's cold tile tables and
busy busboys encourage you to leave
upon the completion of your meal.
Unless you plan to sit and stare at one
of Polio's televisions, chances are you
won't loiter there.
At the heart of the matter, Polio's is
essentially a restaurant. It is a good
restaurant, and I am sure tons of
money will pour out of our pockets and
into its coffers. Still, the Co Ho will
remain a social institution where people
go for more than dinner and a smiling
staff.
