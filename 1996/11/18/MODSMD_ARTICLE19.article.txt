Protesters showed childish views of corporate America

I HAVE BUT one thing to say to the
authors of Friday's letter "Don't
hand over White Plaza to corporate
America": You're insane — go protest
something in Burma.
Thursday's protest in White Plaza was
little more than a group of people that
should be put together in a pledge class
subjected to eternal hazing. I've never
heard such childish philosophizing in my
entire life.
Who's being bought, they ask? It's
called advertising . .. yeah, ever heard of
it? If that really bothers you — the idea
that companies actually like to inform
people of their products — then don't you
dare let me catch you watching television
or listening to the radio (what do you
think funds their programs?), let alone
walking down the street (window dis
plays), looking at cars (posters on buses)
or even wearing anything made by Nike
(what do you think that swoosh on your

shirt is there for?). Hurry, go hide in a
cave.
On second thought, why don't you just
move to Montana, reunite with a militia
and start a society based on the barter
system?
Corporate advertising is a fact of life.
They have products, they don't know
what to do with them, and they're not
sure if you've heard of them yet. So there
you go. Call it self-philanthropy. Actual
ly, call it whatever you want; listen to
them or ignore them. Your decision is up
to you, but just what gives you the right
to make my choices for me?
I want to see corporate America; I like
the attention. Just look at it; it was a
thing of beauty. They drove four gigantic
trucks into our plaza, set up ridiculous
activities that are fun and then gave us
free stuff. And you complain? If this is
being bought, mark me on sale.
If you don't like what they're selling,

then don't buy their products. I won't go
out and purchase their stuff unless it's
something I need and would have bought
anyway. But I still think it was nice to see
some activity in an otherwise boring
atmosphere.
What I really fail to understand is how
these messages are being "shoved down
our throats." I did not see one informa
tion booth follow a student to class or any
blow-up Jeep mow down an uninterested
spectator, although running over some of
the protesters could have been nice . ..
I can't believe you also have the gall
(yes, I said gall) to complain about the
career fair. Who are you people? What
would you prefer? An information booth
about the opportunities in homelessness?
God forbid students explore places to get
jobs! Just remember that not everyone
has already decided to be a professional
"pain in the ass"; the rest of us need to
see what companies are out there.

Besides, the only people that were
actually bought were you protesters —
everyone else took in as much as they
wanted, ignored the rest and then went
on with their day instead of being occu
pied enough to write some bizarre tirade
for everyone to chuckle at. If you would
stop looking for causes in everything
from the health and fitness fair to rocks
and twigs you would be much happier,
independent people like the rest of us,
and your "attention" would be much
safer from "corporate America."
In summary, you are all insane, not to
mention paranoid, bored and in desper
ate need of finding a hobby ... or two.
Anyway, at least all the noise from the
fair managed to drown out that religious
guy screaming about worshipping his cat
— and if that's what you were angry
about, God help us all.
