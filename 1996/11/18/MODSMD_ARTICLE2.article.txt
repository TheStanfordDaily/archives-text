"I went to Stanford, you blow hole!"
There are few phrases that could elicit as much
pride in Stanford students as this one does, spoken by
Michael Douglas in"The American President." The
film, like many others, uses the University's reputa
tion to build the credibility and character of its protag
onist.
Stanford has always played a large role as a refer
ence point in popular film, and its own contribution to
the film industry is surprisingly substantial.
Leland Stanford is often considered the first film

producer. In 1879, then-California Gov. Stanford
commissioned photographer Eadward Muybridge to
help with a study of animals in motion, a subject which
was largely misunderstood at the time.
In the experiment, a running horse tripped the
shutters of 24 cameras lined up along its path, allow
ing the entire sequence of its motion to be document
ed. While Stanford and Muybridge were elated that
the mysteries of animals in motion had been revealed,
their findings created an international sensation for
other reasons. The Scientific American Supplement of
Jan. 28, 1882, wrote of Muybridge's photographs:
"With the aid of an instrument
called the zoopraxiscope, many of
the subjects were exhibited in actu
al motion, and the shadows tra
versed the screen, apparently to the
eye as if the living animal itself
were moving."
In 1988, the American Cine
matographer claimed that the
Stanford-Muybridge project "real
ly was the first movie."
As the motion picture industry
exploded, University organizations
decided campus scenes should be
recorded on film. In 1928, the Col
legiate Cinema Guild offered a
$100 reward to the student who
wrote the best script for a film on
the Stanford campus. "Stanford
Days," by Robert Fitzgerald, was
the winner.
The film covers most of the tra
ditional student stereotypes. It fea
tures an athlete, a graduate stu
dent "scholar" and a first-year stu
dent named Miss Richardson.
After meeting the athlete as a
prospective freshman, Richardson
immediately chooses Stanford over
UC-Berkeley. When the athlete has
trouble with his schoolwork and
the scholar finds himself reclusive,
Richardson convinces the scholar
to tutor the athlete, and all three
end up close friends.
In reviewing "Stanford Days,"
the June 1924 issue of the Stanford

Illustrated Review explained that
"no effort was made to compete
with the average commercial
'movie,' for the object was rather to
bring back the old days than to call
attention away from reality.... It
lasts for something over an hour
and leaves one with a very tender
feeling for the old Farm."
Stanford graduates soon be
came increasingly involved with
Hollywood's major film companies.
Producers David Brown and
Richard Zanuck and directors
Delmer Daves and Denison Clift
were among the most successful.
As a writer for Warner Brothers in
1940, Daves wrote the screenplay
for "Young America Flies," a film
about the efforts of the Civil Aero
nautics Authority to increase the
number of civilians with pilot Li
censes.
Daves chose Stanford students
as the pilot trainees for his screen
play. The opening narration be
gins, "Now we will go to Stanford
University to see this program at
work... to see Young America tak
ing wings, remembering that what
we see is not only true at Stanford
University but in the University of
America!"
The film's screenplay notes
that, during these words, "Stars
and Stripes wave over a montage of
Stanford from the air."
Daves focused on four students
and follows their progress through
the Civil Pilot Training Program.
Bill and Jane are engaged to be
married, Jim is a "square-chinned

lad" and Jack is the "only cocky ap
plicant." The dialogue is both ar
chaic and entertaining, especially
during the application scene fort he
training program:
Jane: I thought I'd better learn
to fly, too ... so we'll have some
thing to talk about during our hon
eymoon.
Director of Recruitment: (eyes
twinkling) If I were your Bill,
there'd be little need for conversa
tion.
It is no secret that countless
films refer to Stanford as a testa
ment to a character's expertise. In
movies like "Ace Ventura, Pet De
tective," "Basic Instinct" and
"Jade," an opinion or credential is
qualified by a Stanford degree.
Such off-handed references to
prestigious universities are entire
ly different from the focused atten
tion that Stanford receives in"The
American President."
University insignia appear
throughout the film, and at one
point, the young president re
sponds to the accusatory sugges
tion that he graduated from Har
vard by calling his grouchy oppo
nent a "blow hole." Some speculate
that Stanford Drama Prof. Anna
Deavere Smith, an aide to the pres
ident in the film, played a role in
adding this Stanford bias to the
script.
While few student-made films
have gained the national recogni
tion of "The American President,"
this has not deterred students from
experimenting in filmmaking.

From the first student-made
movie in 1929, "The Fast Male," to
more recent projects like "More
Often Than Not" and"It Came
From SLAC," Stanford has served
as a launching point for aspiring
filmmakers.
One professional documentary
that did achieve national acclaim is
"Frosh," which debuted in San
Francisco in October 1993. Direct
ed by Stanford graduates Dyana
Goldfine and Dan Geller, the 97-
minute film follows 10 freshmen
through the 1990-91 academicyear
in Trancos. A rather candid chron
icle of the challenges of freshman
living, some universities have cho
sen to use "Frosh" in orientation
programs.
Geller said the movie's goal was
to capture "what it's like to be
ripped loose from your friends,
family and high school and [be] put
into a highly pressured communi
ty."
Although cameras followed the
freshmen even during dates and
personal conversations, the partici
pants said they were for the most
part comfortable with the project.
Stanford's next appearance in a
major film will be a cameo of the
football stadium in Disney's "Flub
ber," a remake of the classic "The
Absent-Minded Professor." Cast
ing directors at Beau Bonneau
Casting in San Francisco said the
"upscale, Ivy League look" of
Maples Pavilion makes it an ideal
shooting location for the Robin
Williams comedy.

"I went to Stanford, you blow hole!"
There are few phrases that could elicit as much
pride in Stanford students as this one does, spoken by
Michael Douglas in"The American President." The
film, like many others, uses the University's reputa
tion to build the credibility and character of its protag
onist.
Stanford has always played a large role as a refer
ence point in popular film, and its own contribution to
the film industry is surprisingly substantial.
Leland Stanford is often considered the first film

producer. In 1879, then-California Gov. Stanford
commissioned photographer Eadward Muybridge to
help with a study of animals in motion, a subject which
was largely misunderstood at the time.
In the experiment, a running horse tripped the
shutters of 24 cameras lined up along its path, allow
ing the entire sequence of its motion to be document
ed. While Stanford and Muybridge were elated that
the mysteries of animals in motion had been revealed,
their findings created an international sensation for
other reasons. The Scientific American Supplement of
Jan. 28, 1882, wrote of Muybridge's photographs:
"With the aid of an instrument
called the zoopraxiscope, many of
the subjects were exhibited in actu
al motion, and the shadows tra
versed the screen, apparently to the
eye as if the living animal itself
were moving."
In 1988, the American Cine
matographer claimed that the
Stanford-Muybridge project "real
ly was the first movie."
As the motion picture industry
exploded, University organizations
decided campus scenes should be
recorded on film. In 1928, the Col
legiate Cinema Guild offered a
$100 reward to the student who
wrote the best script for a film on
the Stanford campus. "Stanford
Days," by Robert Fitzgerald, was
the winner.
The film covers most of the tra
ditional student stereotypes. It fea
tures an athlete, a graduate stu
dent "scholar" and a first-year stu
dent named Miss Richardson.
After meeting the athlete as a
prospective freshman, Richardson
immediately chooses Stanford over
UC-Berkeley. When the athlete has
trouble with his schoolwork and
the scholar finds himself reclusive,
Richardson convinces the scholar
to tutor the athlete, and all three
end up close friends.
In reviewing "Stanford Days,"
the June 1924 issue of the Stanford

Illustrated Review explained that
"no effort was made to compete
with the average commercial
'movie,' for the object was rather to
bring back the old days than to call
attention away from reality.... It
lasts for something over an hour
and leaves one with a very tender
feeling for the old Farm."
Stanford graduates soon be
came increasingly involved with
Hollywood's major film companies.
Producers David Brown and
Richard Zanuck and directors
Delmer Daves and Denison Clift
were among the most successful.
As a writer for Warner Brothers in
1940, Daves wrote the screenplay
for "Young America Flies," a film
about the efforts of the Civil Aero
nautics Authority to increase the
number of civilians with pilot Li
censes.
Daves chose Stanford students
as the pilot trainees for his screen
play. The opening narration be
gins, "Now we will go to Stanford
University to see this program at
work... to see Young America tak
ing wings, remembering that what
we see is not only true at Stanford
University but in the University of
America!"
The film's screenplay notes
that, during these words, "Stars
and Stripes wave over a montage of
Stanford from the air."
Daves focused on four students
and follows their progress through
the Civil Pilot Training Program.
Bill and Jane are engaged to be
married, Jim is a "square-chinned

lad" and Jack is the "only cocky ap
plicant." The dialogue is both ar
chaic and entertaining, especially
during the application scene fort he
training program:
Jane: I thought I'd better learn
to fly, too ... so we'll have some
thing to talk about during our hon
eymoon.
Director of Recruitment: (eyes
twinkling) If I were your Bill,
there'd be little need for conversa
tion.
It is no secret that countless
films refer to Stanford as a testa
ment to a character's expertise. In
movies like "Ace Ventura, Pet De
tective," "Basic Instinct" and
"Jade," an opinion or credential is
qualified by a Stanford degree.
Such off-handed references to
prestigious universities are entire
ly different from the focused atten
tion that Stanford receives in"The
American President."
University insignia appear
throughout the film, and at one
point, the young president re
sponds to the accusatory sugges
tion that he graduated from Har
vard by calling his grouchy oppo
nent a "blow hole." Some speculate
that Stanford Drama Prof. Anna
Deavere Smith, an aide to the pres
ident in the film, played a role in
adding this Stanford bias to the
script.
While few student-made films
have gained the national recogni
tion of "The American President,"
this has not deterred students from
experimenting in filmmaking.

From the first student-made
movie in 1929, "The Fast Male," to
more recent projects like "More
Often Than Not" and"It Came
From SLAC," Stanford has served
as a launching point for aspiring
filmmakers.
