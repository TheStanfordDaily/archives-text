# Health and fitness fair was not a worthy target for liberal protesters
## 
### 
While I'm happy that the Office of
Student Activities was responsive to the
call to remove last Thursday's Collegiate
Health and Fitness Tour, I must admit I
am disturbed by the way in which the
event was used by the protesters and the
underlying tones behind it.
While a Stanford student who is very
concerned about the corporatization of
the University and higher education as a

whole, I feel that the protesters reacted
to an extremely visual reminder of the
corporatization of Stanford, overlooking
the fact that it was a trivial one. Despite
good intentions, demonization of the
health and fitness "industry" was
unfounded, there were no anorexic mod
els or steroid-enhanced spokespeople at
the fair, just students wearing helmets
hurling themselves at velcro walls. The
gaudiness of the huge balloons and the
sheer size of it all made it a very impos
ing image, but no more morally repre
hensible than hard-hitting Christian
groups on campus or our general apathy
toward East Palo Alto, a spectacle of
capitalism also very close to campus.

The real corporatization of Stanford
lies in the huge amount of corporate
investment our tuition and endowment
support, the systematic pressure on stu
dents to "market themselves," etc.
In this respect, the career fairs and
management-consulting firm presenta
tions are far more morally reprehensible
than this fair and have a more actual,
long-ranging impact on society than the
distribution of free deodorant.
My point is this: The fight against
corporatization cannot be based primari
ly on what provokes our anger by being
a visible target or what we think we can
easily mobilize against and win. It must
be based on a deeper analysis of the

problems we are facing. Otherwise, we
simply play into a system which wastes
our political energy on such fights. Over
the past 30 years, while the left has been
busy marching on the English Depart
ment, the right has been marching on
Washington and has succeeded in taking
it. The result is that we have very liberal
intellectual superstructure in our society
and a growing current of conservative
reactionary power rising from below,
outmaneuvering us on the systematic
level. I see the actions of the student
protesters, no matter how well inten
tioned, as a part of that trend.
