## Foiled again! Santa Clara has soccer's number 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Battling severe winds, rains
and a very talented Santa Clara
squad proved to be just a little
too much for the Cardinal on
Saturday night.
Stanford (12-9) was elimi
nated in the first round of the
NCAA tournament 3-2 by the
fifth-seeded Broncos (16-3-2) in
front of 833 at Santa Clara's
Buck Shaw Stadium. It was a
score identical to last year's
first-round loss in triple over
time to the same team at the

same place.
Stanford fell behind 3-0 in
the first half, and despite a
valiant effort in the second peri
od was unable to make up the
deficit. The Cardinal's first-half
struggles could be attributed, at
least in part, to a severe
northerly wind.
Stanford's long balls just
wouldn't travel, and Santa
Clara's deep bombs would carry
forever or so it seemed. On one
occasion, Bronco sophomore
goalie Christina Sanchez
