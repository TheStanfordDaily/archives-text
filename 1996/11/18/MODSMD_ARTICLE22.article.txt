## Foiled again! Santa Clara has soccer's number 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Battling severe winds, rains
and a very talented Santa Clara
squad proved to be just a little
too much for the Cardinal on
Saturday night.
Stanford (12-9) was elimi
nated in the first round of the
NCAA tournament 3-2 by the
fifth-seeded Broncos (16-3-2) in
front of 833 at Santa Clara's
Buck Shaw Stadium. It was a
score identical to last year's
first-round loss in triple over
time to the same team at the

same place.
Stanford fell behind 3-0 in
the first half, and despite a
valiant effort in the second peri
od was unable to make up the
deficit. The Cardinal's first-half
struggles could be attributed, at
least in part, to a severe
northerly wind.
Stanford's long balls just
wouldn't travel, and Santa
Clara's deep bombs would carry
forever or so it seemed. On one
occasion, Bronco sophomore
goalie Christina Sanchez

launched a wind-aided punt that
reached all the way across the field
and nearly bounced over sopho
more Stanford keeper Erin Bryla's
head.
Stanford did its best to limit the
wind advantage by keeping the ball
on the ground and trying to play a
control game, but both teams were
having difficulty with their footing
on the drenched field, and neither
team could string together more
than a couple passes.
Then, at the 16 minute, 22 sec
ond mark, Mikka Hansen, a senior
and the Broncos' co-leading scorer,
dribbled the ball all the way to the
Stanford end line and centered it to
freshman Jaqui Little, who headed
the ball past Bryla.
The goal didn't appear to faze
the Cardinal, however, and less
than five minutes later, Stanford
nearly tied the game. Rita Hermiz,
a junior midfielder, crossed the ball
into the goal area, and Sanchez
stormed out of the cage but was
unable to handle it. The ball
bounced right to sophomore Tra
cye Lawyer who drilled a shot at
the seemingly vacant net, but Sara
Barnett blocked the ball before it
could cross the end line.
"That was a great shot, and
Sara did exactly what she was sup
posed to do," said Broncos' coach
Jerry Smith. "When your goalie is
out, you've got to get as many peo
ple as you can on that goal line."
Santa Clara added its second
goal with just under 10 minutes
left in the half. Freshman Mandy
Clemens, who is tied with Hansen
as the Broncos' leading scorer,
floated the ball into traffic in the
middle of the goal box, and fellow
freshman Kylie Bivens gathered
the ball and pounded it into the
right-side netting.
The Cardinal looked like it
would escape the wind and the first
half down only two goals, but with
less than a minute on the clock,
Anny Madden, a junior defender,
scored her first goal of the season.
It came on a beautiful left-footed
shot from the top of the box and
was assisted by Clemens.

"Anny Madden made all the
right decisions today," Smith said.
"She was assigned to guard Erin
Martin, one of the best players in
the country, and she kept her from
scoring. I'd say that when you shut
down the other team's star player
and score the winning goal that
that's a pretty good game."
Stanford coach Steve Swanson
said the third goal was a crushing
one for his team.
"I was really disappointed about
that goal in the last minute," he
said. "That one hurt. It hurt real
bad. Down two goals I felt good
about our chances, and that third
one really stung us."
But the Cardinal came back
with a little sting of its own to start
the second half. Stacy Cook, a
senior who has had limited playing
time during her collegiate career,
lit a fire under the Cardinal with
her inspired play.
Cook entered the game in the
second half and promptly received
a yellow card for throwing a Bron
co player off of her.
Less than 6 minutes later, Cook
banged in Stanford's first goal.
Hermiz played a perfect give and go
with freshman Ronnie Fair down
the sideline and then pelted a shot.
"I just touched it in," said Her
miz of the play, "and it was so wet
that it skimmed off the goalie.
Then Stacy put it in."
Stanford scored again 9 minutes
later. Hermiz centered a ball high
into the middle, and Cook flicked it
to senior co-captain Emily Burt.
The 5-foot-3 Burt patiently waited
and lofted a "textbook header into
the corner," as Hermiz said.
With 27 minutes remaining, a
lot of momentum and the wind at
its back, the Cardinal seemed
poised to take over the game, and
Stanford fans (who showed up in
force and stood throughout the
game) anticipated another goal.
But the Broncos tightened up
on defense and shut down the Car
dinal attack the rest of the way.
Stanford's best chance at equaliz
ing the match came when Hermiz
belted a hard shot at the upper
right corner with 8 minutes left.
"I was rooting for that one all
the way," Hermiz said. "I just kept
watching it, and even after it sailed
over, I kept watching."

one for his team.
"I was really disappointed about
that goal in the last minute," he
said. "That one hurt. It hurt real
bad. Down two goals I felt good
about our chances, and that third
one really stung us."
But the Cardinal came back
with a little sting of its own to start
the second half. Stacy Cook, a
senior who has had limited playing
time during her collegiate career,
lit a fire under the Cardinal with
her inspired play.
Cook entered the game in the
second half and promptly received
a yellow card for throwing a Bron
co player off of her.
Less than 6 minutes later, Cook
banged in Stanford's first goal.
Hermiz played a perfect give and go
with freshman Ronnie Fair down
the sideline and then pelted a shot.
"I just touched it in," said Her
miz of the play, "and it was so wet
that it skimmed off the goalie.
Then Stacy put it in."
Stanford scored again 9 minutes
later. Hermiz centered a ball high
into the middle, and Cook flicked it
to senior co-captain Emily Burt.
The 5-foot-3 Burt patiently waited
and lofted a "textbook header into
the corner," as Hermiz said.
With 27 minutes remaining, a
lot of momentum and the wind at
its back, the Cardinal seemed
poised to take over the game, and
Stanford fans (who showed up in
force and stood throughout the
game) anticipated another goal.
But the Broncos tightened up
on defense and shut down the Car
dinal attack the rest of the way.
Stanford's best chance at equaliz
ing the match came when Hermiz
belted a hard shot at the upper
right corner with 8 minutes left.
"I was rooting for that one all
the way," Hermiz said. "I just kept
watching it, and even after it sailed
over, I kept watching."
