# Character defines Card's soccer team
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
With an early first-round
exit from the NCAA tourna
ment and a mediocre 12-9
record on the year, it may
look like Stanford had a poor
year.
But anybody who watched
Saturday night's match
against Santa Clara knows
that this Stanford team is full
of character, heart and class.
This is a team of which any
fan could be proud.
Perhaps that is why more
than 200 Cardinal faithful
made the trip to Buck Shaw
Stadium, braved the terrible
weather and remained stand
ing for the entirety of the
match — even when their
team fell behind by a 3-0 mar
gin.
In fact, it was when the

team was down that it exhib
ited the most class. Look, for
example, at senior Erin Mar
tin, a player who coach Steve
Swanson says "can definitely
play at the next level."
Martin, who played in her
final collegiate soccer game
Saturday night, has her name
cemented as one of the great
est in Stanford's history; she
is third all-time in points,
goals and assists. Those are
numbers that will be remem
bered, but it was Martin's
leadership and poise that
have ingrained themselves in
the memories of fans who saw
her last game.
After each Santa Clara
goal, even the third-goal
heartbreaker that came with
under one minute left in the
first half, Martin calmly col
lected the ball and dribbled it to
the center line. If any Cardinal
heads had been hanging, they
lifted as Martin, refusing to give
up, stoically dribbled right past
them.
Martin's action stood out
tremendously against a backing
of celebratory antics performed
by her opponents. After each
Santa Clara goal, Bronco players
would get together and perform
a head-first slide across the
field.
If it was Martin's attitude
which exemplified the first-half
character of the Cardinal, it was
Stacy Cook who represented the
fire and heart in the second.
Cook is a bench player. Prior to
Saturday's game, she had mus

tered just three assists in a Car
dinal uniform. No goals. Noth
ing really.
Nobody thought this senior
reserve was going to get into the
game on Saturday, and certainly
nobody would have predicted
that she would pick up a yellow
card, score a goal and assist on
another.
Coach Steve Swanson put
Cook into the game for her
intensity, and he got all he could
have asked for. She made tackle
after tackle in the midfield and
was an inspiration to her entire
team.
"Stacy Cook came in and
changed the game," Martin said
after the game. "She was awe
some."
Who would have thought?
"I couldn't be more proud of
this team," Swanson said.
"These girls showed you a lot
about character and heart."

Swanson too has been a
model of class and poise all sea
son long. With his team losing 3-
0, Swanson, who is in his first
year at the Stanford helm, could
be found quietly sitting on the
end of the bench.
One couldn't help but think
back to the way lan Sawyers,
Swanson's predecessor, would
have handled the situation.
Sawyers, infamous for public
beratements of his players,
would have been yelling loud
enough to drown out both the
storm and even airplanes pass
ing by overhead.
But that isn't Swanson's
style, and every Cardinal player
will tell you that she appreciates
that fact.
"I'm always an optimist,"
Swanson said. "We lost tonight,
and it hurts right now. But
there's a lot we can take away
from this."
