# Football wins third straight
## Big Game now huge game 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The Stanford football squad made this week's
99th Big Game even bigger by handing Washing
ton State a 33-17 loss and putting a bowl berth on
the line against California.
The Cardinal (5-5 overall, 4-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) outscored the Cougars (5-5, 3-4) 17-3 in a
decisive third quarter to earn its third consecutive
conference victory. With the Cardinal win and
losses by both Cal and UCLA on Saturday, Stan
ford is now in sole possession of third place in the
Pac-10 and can clinch a Sun Bowl berth with a win
next week in Berkeley. Stanford had not won three
consecutive games since the conclusion of the 1992
season.
Stanford broke out of a 14-14 halftime tie with
a 58-yard touchdown strike to junior wide receiver
Damon Dunn. On third and 11 from the Stanford
42-yard line, sophomore quarterback Chad
Hutchinson hit Dunn on a quick slant, and Dunn
hit overdrive in the open field.
After trading field goals, the Cardinal offense
received the ball at the Washington State 1-yard
line on a Tim Smith interception which the sopho
more free safety returned a foot shy of the goal
line. Senior fullback Greg Cornelia extended the
Stanford lead to 14 points on a 1-yard touchdown
run.
"They came out at halftime and were moving
the ball effectively," Cougar tight end David Knuff
said. "The momentum turned at the half. We
talked about being ready to play, but we weren't.
They took it to us in the second half."
The Cardinal remained in control for the rest of
the game as the defense took over, stymieing
Washington State throughout the second half.
After gaining 220 total yards of offense in the first
half, the Washington State offense was able to
muster just 91 yards in the second. The Cardinal
defensive unit also allowed the Cougars to convert
on third down just twice in 10 attempts.
"The second half has been a key to our success
obviously," said junior defensive end Kailee Wong.
"We seem to get off to a slow start, but we always
seem to rally around it and come up with big
plays."
A sack by junior linebacker Jon Haskins in the
end zone gave Stanford a safety and its biggest
lead of the game at 33-17.
Early in the contest, it looked as if the Cardinal
was going to need yet another second-half come
back. A nearly blocked Stanford punt gave Wash
ington State the ball with good field position on
the Cougars' second possession of the game. Three
plays later, a scrambling Ryan Leaf put his team
on the board with a 14-yard touchdown pass to
Knuff.
Washington State then took a two-touchdown
advantage early in the second quarter on a 10-play,
78-yard drive highlighted by two consecutive 23-
yard pass plays from Leaf to Knuff. The Cougar
tight end, who had just 12 catches coming into the
game, caught eight balls for 102 receiving yards.

the first half. Redshirt freshman quarterback

Chad Hutchinson and company
took over at the Cardinal 31-
yard line and on first down,
Hutchinson connected with
junior running back Anthony
Bookman on the left sideline for
a 12-yard gain. Two plays later,
Hutchinson found Bookman
wide open on the opposite side
line for a gain of 43 yards. Junior
fullback Jon Ritchie then carried
up the middle for 11 yards to the
Cougar 1-yard line and finished
the drive himself on the next
play.
"We started slow early on
offense," said redshirt freshman
flanker Troy Walters. "But we
were driving early on so we
weren't panicking. We knew we
could drive; we just had to finish."
After a Wong sack on third and
10 forced the Cougars to punt, the
Cardinal evened the score on yet
another tremendous play by Wal
ters. Fielding the punt on the
right sideline, Walters cut all the
way across the field. A huge block
by Smith allowed Walters to hit
the opposite sideline where he
took off and eventually cut back to
the middle for a 75-yard touch
down return.
"I just thank my teammates
for springing me and getting me
the blocks I needed," Walters said.
"I saw a lot of Cardinal jerseys in
front of me, so I just wanted to
stay behind them and let them get
their blocks."
The punt return marked the
second straight week in which
Stanford special teams has pro
vided a score as Dunn brought a

kickoff all the way back against
use.
"Our special teams at so many
times this year has not had the
opportunity to do what it can do,"
Willingham said. "The punt
return was a huge lift. From our
perspective, all of a sudden it was
an even ball game. From their
perspective, they were doing some
things they loved, and in the blink
of an eye, we're back in the
game."
So after building a 14-point
lead 27 minutes into the game,
Washington State saw it vanish in
about 3 minutes.
"I thought we were on track
early on," said Washington State
head coach Mike Price. "We gave
up a couple of big plays at the end
of the second quarter, but I
thought we would get it back in
the second half."
In addition to the interception
and key block on Walters' return,
Smith came up big all afternoon
for the Cardinal, also registering a
forced fumble, a sack, six tackles
and two passes defensed.
In the face of a balanced
Cougar attack, the Stanford
defense had to stop both the pass
and run. On the ground, the Car
dinal held the Washignton State
rushing attack, led by the Pac
10's second-best rusher. Michael
Black, to just 49 net rushing
yards.
"Our defense played fairly con
sistently the whole ball game."
Willingham said. "We were mak
ing some minor errors that
allowed them to get some plays on
us, but we got those corrected at
the half."
WSU quarterback Rvan Leaf
looked good early, but the Stan
ford defense limited Leaf to just

60 net passing yards in the second
half. Leaf finished the game 19-
for-39 passing for 262 yards.
Stanford also won the turnover
battle 3-1 on Smith's intercep
tion, a pick by senior safety Josh
Madsen and a fumble recovery by
junior defensive tackle Carl
Hansen.
The Stanford offense was on
top of its game as well, as evi
denced by a season-high 33
points. Hutchinson was an effi
cient 15 of 22 for 206 yards
spreading the wealth to seven dif
ferent receivers. Dunn led the
Cardinal with four catches for 8C
yards and a touchdown.
On the ground, Stanford
gained 130 net yards rushing, led
once again by senior Mike
Mitchell who collected 54 yards
on 15 carries. The offensive pro
ductivity not only put points on
the board but kept the defense
off the field. The Washington
State defense was on the field for
more than 36 minutes while the
Cardinal stayed fresh on the side
lines.
The victory, coupled with
UCLA's 35-17 loss at Arizona,
put Stanford in control of its own
destiny. Two games behind sec
ond-place Washington and one
ahead of a slew of teams in
fourth, the Cardinal can earn its
second consecutive bowl berth
under Willingham with a win in
Big Game.
For the Cougars, the loss was
their third straight in conference
play and dropped them into a five
wav tie for fourth place.
"That was a bad one and a par
ticularly terrible second half,"
Price said. "Things really fell
apart for us in the second half of

under Willingham with a win in
Big Game.
For the Cougars, the loss was

play and dropped them into a five

The Stanford football squad made this week's
99th Big Game even bigger by handing Washing
ton State a 33-17 loss and putting a bowl berth on
the line against California.
The Cardinal (5-5 overall, 4-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) outscored the Cougars (5-5, 3-4) 17-3 in a
decisive third quarter to earn its third consecutive
conference victory. With the Cardinal win and
losses by both Cal and UCLA on Saturday, Stan
ford is now in sole possession of third place in the
Pac-10 and can clinch a Sun Bowl berth with a win
next week in Berkeley. Stanford had not won three
consecutive games since the conclusion of the 1992
season.
Stanford broke out of a 14-14 halftime tie with
a 58-yard touchdown strike to junior wide receiver
Damon Dunn. On third and 11 from the Stanford
42-yard line, sophomore quarterback Chad
Hutchinson hit Dunn on a quick slant, and Dunn
hit overdrive in the open field.
After trading field goals, the Cardinal offense
received the ball at the Washington State 1-yard
line on a Tim Smith interception which the sopho
more free safety returned a foot shy of the goal
line. Senior fullback Greg Cornelia extended the
Stanford lead to 14 points on a 1-yard touchdown
run.
"They came out at halftime and were moving
the ball effectively," Cougar tight end David Knuff
said. "The momentum turned at the half. We
talked about being ready to play, but we weren't.
They took it to us in the second half."
The Cardinal remained in control for the rest of
the game as the defense took over, stymieing
Washington State throughout the second half.
After gaining 220 total yards of offense in the first
half, the Washington State offense was able to
muster just 91 yards in the second. The Cardinal
defensive unit also allowed the Cougars to convert
on third down just twice in 10 attempts.
"The second half has been a key to our success
obviously," said junior defensive end Kailee Wong.
"We seem to get off to a slow start, but we always
seem to rally around it and come up with big
plays."
A sack by junior linebacker Jon Haskins in the
end zone gave Stanford a safety and its biggest
lead of the game at 33-17.
Early in the contest, it looked as if the Cardinal
was going to need yet another second-half come
back. A nearly blocked Stanford punt gave Wash
ington State the ball with good field position on
the Cougars' second possession of the game. Three
plays later, a scrambling Ryan Leaf put his team
on the board with a 14-yard touchdown pass to
Knuff.
Washington State then took a two-touchdown
advantage early in the second quarter on a 10-play,
78-yard drive highlighted by two consecutive 23-
yard pass plays from Leaf to Knuff. The Cougar
tight end, who had just 12 catches coming into the
game, caught eight balls for 102 receiving yards.

Sophomore free safety Tim Smith runs the interception back to the Cougar 1.
Chad Hutchinson and company
took over at the Cardinal 31-
yard line and on first down,
Hutchinson connected with
junior running back Anthony
Bookman on the left sideline for
a 12-yard gain. Two plays later,
Hutchinson found Bookman
wide open on the opposite side
line for a gain of 43 yards. Junior
fullback Jon Ritchie then carried
up the middle for 11 yards to the
Cougar 1-yard line and finished
the drive himself on the next
play.
"We started slow early on
offense," said redshirt freshman
flanker Troy Walters. "But we
were driving early on so we
weren't panicking. We knew we
could drive; we just had to finish."
After a Wong sack on third and
10 forced the Cougars to punt, the
Cardinal evened the score on yet
another tremendous play by Wal
ters. Fielding the punt on the
right sideline, Walters cut all the
way across the field. A huge block
by Smith allowed Walters to hit
the opposite sideline where he
took off and eventually cut back to
the middle for a 75-yard touch
down return.
"I just thank my teammates
for springing me and getting me
the blocks I needed," Walters said.
"I saw a lot of Cardinal jerseys in
front of me, so I just wanted to
stay behind them and let them get
their blocks."
The punt return marked the
second straight week in which
Stanford special teams has pro
vided a score as Dunn brought a

kickoff all the way back against
use.
"Our special teams at so many
times this year has not had the
opportunity to do what it can do,"
Willingham said. "The punt
return was a huge lift. From our
perspective, all of a sudden it was
an even ball game. From their
perspective, they were doing some
things they loved, and in the blink
of an eye, we're back in the
game."
So after building a 14-point
lead 27 minutes into the game,
Washington State saw it vanish in
about 3 minutes.
"I thought we were on track
early on," said Washington State
head coach Mike Price. "We gave
up a couple of big plays at the end
of the second quarter, but I
thought we would get it back in
the second half."
In addition to the interception
and key block on Walters' return,
Smith came up big all afternoon
for the Cardinal, also registering a
forced fumble, a sack, six tackles
and two passes defensed.
In the face of a balanced
Cougar attack, the Stanford
defense had to stop both the pass
and run. On the ground, the Car
dinal held the Washignton State
rushing attack, led by the Pac
10's second-best rusher. Michael
Black, to just 49 net rushing
yards.
"Our defense played fairly con
sistently the whole ball game."
Willingham said. "We were mak
ing some minor errors that
allowed them to get some plays on
us, but we got those corrected at
the half."
WSU quarterback Rvan Leaf
looked good early, but the Stan
ford defense limited Leaf to just

60 net passing yards in the second
half. Leaf finished the game 19-
for-39 passing for 262 yards.
Stanford also won the turnover
battle 3-1 on Smith's intercep
tion, a pick by senior safety Josh
Madsen and a fumble recovery by
junior defensive tackle Carl
Hansen.
The Stanford offense was on
top of its game as well, as evi
denced by a season-high 33
points. Hutchinson was an effi
cient 15 of 22 for 206 yards
spreading the wealth to seven dif
ferent receivers. Dunn led the
Cardinal with four catches for 8C
yards and a touchdown.
On the ground, Stanford
gained 130 net yards rushing, led
once again by senior Mike
Mitchell who collected 54 yards
on 15 carries. The offensive pro
ductivity not only put points on
the board but kept the defense
off the field. The Washington
State defense was on the field for
more than 36 minutes while the
Cardinal stayed fresh on the side
lines.
The victory, coupled with
UCLA's 35-17 loss at Arizona,
put Stanford in control of its own
destiny. Two games behind sec
ond-place Washington and one
ahead of a slew of teams in
fourth, the Cardinal can earn its
second consecutive bowl berth
under Willingham with a win in
Big Game.
