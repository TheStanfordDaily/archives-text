# Football wins third straight
## Big Game now huge game 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
The Stanford football squad made this week's
99th Big Game even bigger by handing Washing
ton State a 33-17 loss and putting a bowl berth on
the line against California.
The Cardinal (5-5 overall, 4-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) outscored the Cougars (5-5, 3-4) 17-3 in a
decisive third quarter to earn its third consecutive
conference victory. With the Cardinal win and
losses by both Cal and UCLA on Saturday, Stan
ford is now in sole possession of third place in the
Pac-10 and can clinch a Sun Bowl berth with a win
next week in Berkeley. Stanford had not won three
consecutive games since the conclusion of the 1992
season.
Stanford broke out of a 14-14 halftime tie with
a 58-yard touchdown strike to junior wide receiver
Damon Dunn. On third and 11 from the Stanford
42-yard line, sophomore quarterback Chad
Hutchinson hit Dunn on a quick slant, and Dunn
hit overdrive in the open field.
After trading field goals, the Cardinal offense
received the ball at the Washington State 1-yard
line on a Tim Smith interception which the sopho
more free safety returned a foot shy of the goal
line. Senior fullback Greg Cornelia extended the
Stanford lead to 14 points on a 1-yard touchdown
run.
"They came out at halftime and were moving
the ball effectively," Cougar tight end David Knuff
said. "The momentum turned at the half. We
talked about being ready to play, but we weren't.
They took it to us in the second half."
The Cardinal remained in control for the rest of
the game as the defense took over, stymieing
Washington State throughout the second half.
After gaining 220 total yards of offense in the first
half, the Washington State offense was able to
muster just 91 yards in the second. The Cardinal
defensive unit also allowed the Cougars to convert
on third down just twice in 10 attempts.
"The second half has been a key to our success
obviously," said junior defensive end Kailee Wong.
"We seem to get off to a slow start, but we always
seem to rally around it and come up with big
plays."
A sack by junior linebacker Jon Haskins in the
end zone gave Stanford a safety and its biggest
lead of the game at 33-17.
Early in the contest, it looked as if the Cardinal
was going to need yet another second-half come
back. A nearly blocked Stanford punt gave Wash
ington State the ball with good field position on
the Cougars' second possession of the game. Three
plays later, a scrambling Ryan Leaf put his team
on the board with a 14-yard touchdown pass to
Knuff.
Washington State then took a two-touchdown
advantage early in the second quarter on a 10-play,
78-yard drive highlighted by two consecutive 23-
yard pass plays from Leaf to Knuff. The Cougar
tight end, who had just 12 catches coming into the
game, caught eight balls for 102 receiving yards.
