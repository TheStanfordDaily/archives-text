# Smith keeps improving
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
Tim Smith came to Stanford expecting to
make big plays on the football field for the
Cardinal — he never expected to be making
them on defense, though.
But that is what the free safety, who
arrived on the Farm last year as one of the
top-rated high school quarterbacks in the
nation, has been doing ever since he made a
huge interception six games ago to key Stan
ford's comeback victory over Oregon.
Smith "has progressed and gotten better
each week, but I think you can say that for a
lot of our guys," said head coach TYrone Will
ingham. "That's what you like a team to do
— you like the team to make a steady climb
as opposed to peaking and not being sure

what direction they are going.
The Cardinal, which earned its third
straight victory Saturday with a 33-17 win
against Washington State, has definitely
been going in the right direction over the last
few weeks.
And so has Smith.
The Coalinga, Calif., native, who only
began playing free safety during the last
week of spring drills, had the best game of
his young career Saturday, racking up six
tackles (one for a loss) and one sack, causing
one fumble and making an interception.
"Tim's play today was huge," said junior
defensive end Kailee Wong. "That guy was
all over the field making huge plays — I can't
even sav big plays because thev were huge —
and he was just helping the team
win."
Perhaps Smith's biggest play
Saturday came on special teams,
though, when Smith threw a bone
crunching block that cleared the
way for Cardinal punt returner
Troy Walters to scamper across
the field for a 75-yard touchdown
that tied the game at 14-14 just
before the end of the first half.
"I just thank my teammates for
giving me the blocks I needed,"
Walters said. "I saw Tim Smith
early on [in the return!, and he
gave me the one block that got me
to the edge."
Willingham was quick to echo
Walters' sentiments about the
block. "That was a big block on the
punt return, and [Smith] made
some big hits downfield. He just
keeps getting better and better
each week," Willingham said.
Smith just got better and better
against the Cougars too. After the
block on the punt return, Smith
got tough on defense. After Stan
ford took the lead 21-17 in the
third quarter, Smith began caus
ing turnovers on key plays.
With 6 minutes, 20 seconds left
in the third quarter, the Cougars
took possession on their own 23-
yard line. Quarterback Ryan Leaf
dropped back to pass and was
crushed by Smith, who came on a
safety blitz. The ball popped loose,
and Cardinal junior tackle Carl
Hansen recovered on the Cougar
17-yard line.
The turnover led to a Kevin
Miller field goal that gave the Car
dinal a 24-17 lead. Smith wasn't
done, though, as he came up big on
Washington State's next posses
sion. With the Cougars backed up
to their own 7-yard line, Leaf was
pressured by the Cardinal front

four and threw an errant pass that
landed in Smith's arms at the 32-
yard line.
Despite initially losing his bal
ance, Smith began running toward
the end zone, and after breaking
four tackles was finally brought
down at the Cougar 1-yard line.
"I think the quarterback just
overthrew everyone, and I just
happened to be standing there,"
Smith said. "When I caught it I
thought I was going to fall, but
[senior cornerback] Alistair
[White] helped me up and from
then on I was just running and
making cuts. I thought I was going
to score, but oh well, we scored
anyway."
The Cardinal did score on the
next play, putting the game out of

reach at 28-17.
Smith's emergence, although a
surprise to some, hardly shocks his
teammates.
"He's tall and has good speed
and is able to cover the deep routes
over the middle," said starting free
safety Josh Madsen, who many
view as Smith's mentor. "He's
going to be a great player."
It seems that Smith isn't exact
ly surprised at his improvement at
a position that he began playing
just five months ago either.
"It probably has to do with con
fidence and also learning the
defense and feeling more comfort
able knowing exactly what to do,"
Smith said. "It started [with the
Oregon game] and just kept rolling
from then on."

It's not just that Smith has been
making the routine plays he should
make, but he has been making
them at clutch times. All of it,
Smith said, comes with experience.
"I would say that now I am
starting to get a better feel with
the defense," he said. "It is becom
ing internalized for me, and I can
make plays better now, which is
what the job asks for."
Perhaps the best part of
Smith's game is his simplicity. Fol
lowing Saturday's win, which it is
safe to say was guaranteed by the
10 points that the Cardinal scored
off the turnovers Smith caused, a
reporter asked Smith to analyze
his own play.
"I just play," replied a smiling
Smith. "It's as simple as that."
