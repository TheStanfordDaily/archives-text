men's and women's cross country
teams, both ranked second in the
nation, easily qualified for the
Nov. 25 NCAA championship
meet in Tucson, Ariz.
In the women's competition,
the Cardinal finished on top with
51 points. Arizona was a serious
threat but came up short in the
end. After four runners finished
in the top 10 the Wildcats had 28
points and needed only one run
ner to finish no lower than 22nd
in order to take the meet. But

their fifth runner finished 41st,
and the team ended a distant sec
ond behind the Cardinal. Wash
ington came in third with 98
points.
Arizona sophomore Amy
Skieresz added to the second
straight Pac-10 title she gar
nered two weeks ago by repeat
ing as the district's individual
champion, completing the
5,000-meter course with a time
of 16 minutes, 13 seconds. USC
senior Emebet Shiferaw (17:03)
and Sacramento State junior
Marisa Avendano (17:08) fin
ished second and third, respec
tively.
Junior Jessica Fry was the top
Stanford runner, barely finish

ing behind Avendano with a time
of 17:09 to take fourth. Senior
Monal Chokshi came in fifth
with a time of 17:13, and sopho
more Mary Cobb (17:14) was

Marie Davis (17:14) and finished
seventh. Juniors Sarna Renfrr
(17:36) and Sara Moore (17:46
rounded out the Cardinal top
five, finishing 15th and 20th,
respectively.
Senior Leila Burr (17:54) and
freshman Sally Glynn (18:12'
finished 27th and 38th, respec
tively.
"I definitely think that with
the way our top five performed,
we definitely have a good chance
at nationals," Glvnn said. "Once

you get to nationals, that race is
totally different from any of the
other races we raced this season.
So you can't really say for sure
we'll win nationals. But with the
way practices have been going
and the way things turned out at
districts, we really have a good
chance."
"We used the district meet
more as a dress rehearsal for the
nationals," said assistant coach
Beth Alford-Sullivan. "We rested
Kortney Dunscombe. It's nice to
have the depth in both teams tc
be able to have run a squad at
the Pac-lOs and then turn
around and run a different squad
