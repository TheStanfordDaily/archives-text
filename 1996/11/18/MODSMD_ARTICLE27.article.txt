## 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
With solid victories at the
weekend's District VIII Champi
onship meet in Fresno, Calif., the
men's and women's cross country
teams, both ranked second in the
nation, easily qualified for the
Nov. 25 NCAA championship
meet in Tucson, Ariz.
In the women's competition,
the Cardinal finished on top with
51 points. Arizona was a serious
threat but came up short in the
end. After four runners finished
in the top 10 the Wildcats had 28
points and needed only one run
ner to finish no lower than 22nd
in order to take the meet. But

their fifth runner finished 41st,
and the team ended a distant sec
ond behind the Cardinal. Wash
ington came in third with 98
points.
Arizona sophomore Amy
Skieresz added to the second
straight Pac-10 title she gar
nered two weeks ago by repeat
ing as the district's individual
champion, completing the
5,000-meter course with a time
of 16 minutes, 13 seconds. USC
senior Emebet Shiferaw (17:03)
and Sacramento State junior
Marisa Avendano (17:08) fin
ished second and third, respec
tively.
Junior Jessica Fry was the top
Stanford runner, barely finish

ing behind Avendano with a time
of 17:09 to take fourth. Senior
Monal Chokshi came in fifth
with a time of 17:13, and sopho
more Mary Cobb (17:14) was
edged by Oregon sophomore
Marie Davis (17:14) and finished
seventh. Juniors Sarna Renfrr
(17:36) and Sara Moore (17:46
rounded out the Cardinal top
five, finishing 15th and 20th,
respectively.
Senior Leila Burr (17:54) and
freshman Sally Glynn (18:12'
finished 27th and 38th, respec
tively.
"I definitely think that with
the way our top five performed,
we definitely have a good chance
at nationals," Glvnn said. "Once

you get to nationals, that race is
totally different from any of the
other races we raced this season.
So you can't really say for sure
we'll win nationals. But with the
way practices have been going
and the way things turned out at
districts, we really have a good
chance."
"We used the district meet
more as a dress rehearsal for the
nationals," said assistant coach
Beth Alford-Sullivan. "We rested
Kortney Dunscombe. It's nice to
have the depth in both teams tc
be able to have run a squad at
the Pac-lOs and then turn
around and run a different squad
at the districts."
With three runners in the top
four and all five point-earners in
the top 13, the men easily rolled
to their second consecutive dis
trict championship with 31
points. Pac-10 runner-up Ore
gon finished second with 47
points and Portland came in
third with 71.
Oregon senior Karl Keska
defended his individual district
title, finishing the 10,000-meter
race with a time of 30:16. But
the strong Cardinal pack of
sophomore Brad Hauser and
seniors J.J. White and Greg Jim
merson, which followed Keska,
gave the team a little breathing
room in the race. Hauser's time
of 30:33 to take second was

almost a full minute faster than
his 19th-place finish at last
year's meet. White's third place
(30:41) was a seven-spot
improvement from last year's.
Jimmerson placed fourth for the
second consecutive year with a
time of 30:44.
Sophomore Brent Hauser
(31:04) and junior Jason Per
scheid (31:12) earned the rest of
the Cardinal points by finishing
ninth and 13th, respectively.
Sophomore Jason Balkman fol
lowed Perscheid in 14th with a
time of 31:28, and sophomore
Jonathan Weldon (31:47) round
ed out the Cardinal seven by
coming in 23rd.
The national race will give the
Cardinal its first glimpse of the
nation's defending champions,
the No. 1 Arkansas men and
Providence women. But after
getting beat in its district race,
Providence will most likely be

replaced in the polls by Stanford.
"I think our shot is reason
able," said coach Vin Lananna,
"but I'm not sure that I would
say that it's a great shot. I think
it's probably a good shot at best.
I think the athletes will go in the
same as they've gone in every
meet, and that is to go in setting
ourselves up to run our best
race."
"What's been driving both of
the teams has been to put
together great races, to win the
Pac-10 and the district and get
into the nationals in good shape
and ready to go," Alford-Sullivan
said. "We used those meets for
what they are. We're very proud
and excited to win the Pac-10,
and they ran for a Pac-10 title.
Then they turned around and
used last weekend as the qualifi
er for the national. I think going
into it not being ranked first is
not a problem for us."

(31:04) and junior Jason Per
scheid (31:12) earned the rest of
the Cardinal points by finishing
ninth and 13th, respectively.
Sophomore Jason Balkman fol
lowed Perscheid in 14th with a
time of 31:28, and sophomore
Jonathan Weldon (31:47) round
ed out the Cardinal seven by
coming in 23rd.
The national race will give the
Cardinal its first glimpse of the
nation's defending champions,
the No. 1 Arkansas men and
Providence women. But after
getting beat in its district race,
Providence will most likely be

replaced in the polls by Stanford.
"I think our shot is reason
able," said coach Vin Lananna,
"but I'm not sure that I would
say that it's a great shot. I think
it's probably a good shot at best.
I think the athletes will go in the
same as they've gone in every
meet, and that is to go in setting
ourselves up to run our best
race."
"What's been driving both of
the teams has been to put
together great races, to win the
Pac-10 and the district and get
into the nationals in good shape
and ready to go," Alford-Sullivan
said. "We used those meets for
what they are. We're very proud
and excited to win the Pac-10,
and they ran for a Pac-10 title.
Then they turned around and
used last weekend as the qualifi
er for the national. I think going
into it not being ranked first is
not a problem for us."
