# Pacific is no match for water polo

The Stanford men's water polo team (16-5) host
ed No. 6 Pacific Saturday in its final conference
game of the season, and the Cardinal triumphed 11-
7 to sink the Tigers for the fourth time this season.
The victory put Stanford in a tie for first place in the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
Down 2-0 to the Tigers after a slow start, the Car
dinal turned up the heat in the offensive end to cap
ture a 6-4 lead by halftime.
"I think that we were all looking past UOP,
though we all knew that they were a threat," said
junior defender Tyrone Miller. "Our offense was
fair, but we simply weren't getting back on defense
quickly enough."
The Card went on to shutout the Tigers in the
third quarter while adding three goals of its own to
create a nearly insurmountable 9-4 lead as the third
quarter came to a close.
"We talked at halftime about our play and really
made an effort in the second half to shut them
down," Miller said.
Though UOP managed three goals to Stanford's
two in the final quarter, the Card won easily 11-4.
The star of the day proved to be senior holeman
and captain Brian Wallin, who played a phenomenal
game as he netted five goals. Juniors Nathan Osborn
and Miller each scored two points, and senior Daniel
Lehoczky and sophomore Crosby Grant each added
one.

The victory caps an astonishing conference sea
son for the Cardinal, which won its final seven
games to wind up 7-1 and put itself in excellent posi
tion for the postseason.
Stanford's win, along with UC-Irvine's loss to
UCLA, places Stanford with the Bruins and USC in
a three-way tie for first place in the conference.
Because the Cardinal owns victories over both, it is
guaranteed the No. 1 seed in the upcoming MPSF
tournament by virtue of the tie-break rule.
If Stanford, with excellent seeding posit ion to its
advantage, should win the tournament, it will
receive an automatic bid to the 1996 NCAA Cham
pionship.
Such a position is quite an accomplishment for
the Cardinal who, despite dominating the competi
tion in 1993 and 1994 en route to capturing back-to
back NCAA Championship titles, failed to qualify for
the tournament last year.
As the postseason opportunities begin to fall into
place for the Cardinal, the team now looks toward
the Big Splash game happening this weekend at Cal
"The Cal game is very important to us as far as
NCAA implications," Wallin said "We need a win
here to give us a good chance of receiving an at-large
bid to NCAAs if we don't win the MPSF tourna
ment."
So while the game proves to be an important one
for the Cardinal, the team also looks forward to the
game for the fun and the rivalry involved
"It's big game, and it's usually a lot of fun,"
Miller said.
