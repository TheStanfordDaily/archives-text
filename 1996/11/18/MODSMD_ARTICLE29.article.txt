Another year, another Pacific
10 Conference championship for
the Cardinal.
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team (23-2, 15-1 Pac-10)
clinched the conference title by
defeating UCLA (15-12, 7-9) on
Friday night and USC (17-7,11-
5) on Saturday
The Cardinal won its third
consecutive Pac-10 title with the
help of second-place Washing
ton State, which lost to Arizona.
The two Stanford wins coupled
with the Cougars' loss secured
the championship with one
week still remaining in the con
ference season.
Stanford now has a two
match lead over Washington
State, and even if the two
schools were to tie for first place
in the conference, the Cardinal

would still win the Pac-10
crown Although the two teams
traded wins in their head-to
head competition, because it
took only three games for Stan
ford to beat Washington State
while the Cougars needed four
games to top the Cardinal. Stan
ford would be the champion.
On Friday evening Stanford
visited Pauley Pavilion expect
ing a strong effort from the Bru
ins. When the two squads met in
October, UCLA caught Stanford
flat-footed and won the opening
game of the match before even
tually losing to the Card. This
time, the Bruins never had a
chance.
Stanford ran over the Bruins
in the first game, winning 15-4
behind the hitting of junior out
side hitter Kristin Folkl and
freshman outside hitter Kerri
Walsh.
"UCLA has been struggling
lately," Folkl said. "This time we
were more mentally prepared. We
know we have the physical ability
to play with anyone."
Stanford continued its beating
of the Bruins in the second game,
pummeling UCLA 15-8 as Walsh
and junior outside hitter Debbie
Lambert provided some firepower.
The Cardinal express continued
its speedy tour through Pauley by
dismantling the Bruins in the
third game. Before a Fox Sports
TV audience, Stanford clinched
game three and the match 15-6.
"Our blocking defense was real
ly good along with our transitions
to offense," Lambert said. "When
our passing is going well, I don't
think anyone can stop us."
On Saturday night, Stanford
decided to continue its Los Angeles
volleyball clinic by crushing the
Trojans 15-6 in the opening game.
However, the Trojans rebounded
in game two, hanging close to the
Card before falling 15-12.
"We had a mental lapse," Folkl
said. "We were up 9-2 and then
kind of assumed we had it and
started coasting."
In the third game, Stanford was
all business, disposing of the Tro
jans quickly 15-5. Walsh led the
Cardinal squad with 16 kills to go
along with three blocks while Folkl
recorded 11 kills of her own.
The middle blocker tandem of
senior Eileen Murfee and junior
Barbara Ifejika once again put in
an excellent performance, as Mur
fee contributed 13 kiUs and two
blocks while Ifejika added seven
kills and two blocks.
"We are hitting an upswing, and
it showed in this weekend's perfor
mance," Folkl said. "We under
stand what everyone is supposed to
do now. Our chemistry is good."
