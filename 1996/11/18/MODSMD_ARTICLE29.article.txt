Another year, another Pacific
10 Conference championship for
the Cardinal.
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team (23-2, 15-1 Pac-10)
clinched the conference title by
defeating UCLA (15-12, 7-9) on
Friday night and USC (17-7,11-
5) on Saturday
The Cardinal won its third
consecutive Pac-10 title with the
help of second-place Washing
ton State, which lost to Arizona.
The two Stanford wins coupled
with the Cougars' loss secured
the championship with one
week still remaining in the con

traded wins in their head-to
head competition, because it
took only three games for Stan
ford to beat Washington State
while the Cougars needed four
games to top the Cardinal. Stan
ford would be the champion.
On Friday evening Stanford
visited Pauley Pavilion expect
ing a strong effort from the Bru
ins. When the two squads met in
October, UCLA caught Stanford
flat-footed and won the opening
game of the match before even
tually losing to the Card. This
time, the Bruins never had a
chance.
Stanford ran over the Bruins
in the first game, winning 15-4
behind the hitting of junior out
side hitter Kristin Folkl and
freshman outside hitter Kerri
