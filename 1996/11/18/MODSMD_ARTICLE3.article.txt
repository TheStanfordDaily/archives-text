## Over 700 star in 'Flubber' 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
Stanford students and staff
got a taste of Hollywood Friday
night, and they didn't even have
to leave campus.
Nearly 700 people from Stan
ford and the surrounding com
munities worked as extras in
Walt Disney's new movie,
"Flubber."
The movie, which stars
Robin Williams, is a remake of
"The Absent-Minded Profes
sor." It will be released next fall.
The site of Friday's shoot,
Maples Pavilion, was trans
formed into the movie's fictional
Rutland Arena by "Flubber"
crews, who arrived at 5 a.m. Fri
day.
A plaque reading "Rutland
Arena" and an enormous "R"
were placed on the outside wall
of the building. The crews also
replaced the lights outside the
pavilion with photographically
correct light bulbs.

Robin Williams chats with extras at the filming of Disney's "Flubber" at Maples Pavilion Friday.
The night was spent filming
only two scenes, one in which ex
tras are entering Maples Pavilion
and another in which the extras
and Williams leave the pavilion.
In an interview, Williams ex
plained his actions in the exiting
scene, in which he attempts to win
back his romantic interest.
"I'm desperately losing her, but
I hope to get her back," said
Williams. "If you've seen ['The Ab
sent-Minded Professor,'] you'll
know what happens."
However, the extras found that
movie-making isn't as glamorous
as it seems.
By the end of the filming, extras
were cold and exhausted by the rep

etition. "I feel like I'm in [the
movie] 'Groundhog Day,' " said
freshman Aaron Bell.
At 9:45 p.m., doctoral student
Mehul Bastawala expressed his ex
haustion: "This is getting tiring,
and it's really cold."
"It was pretty grueling," said
doctoral student Richard Ben
jamin, who left at 2:30 a.m. "I'd do
it again but not as an extra, as a di
rector. As an extra it was a one
time experience."
Extras did enjoy the contact
with Williams and the behind-the
scenes view of filmmaking.
"It was an experience of a life
time to see [Williams] act and per
form and to see what it's all about,"
said sophomore Janet Caudillo. "I
feel like I know more about what
show business is all about."
Williams, who is a native of the
Bay Area, said he had been to Stan

ford several times before, most re
cently for a World Cup game in
1994.
The extras were required to
work for a minimum of 12 to 14
hours; they were paid $40 for their
first eight hours of work and $7.50
for each subsequent hour.
Filming of the exit scene took
more than seven hours and 32
takes. This amount of time and re
takes was necessary to ensure that
each scene was captured perfectly,
according to "Flubber" publicist
Michael Umble.
"If we miss a shot, it's really ex
pensive to try and do this again,"
Umble said.
Filming had to be stopped often
due to noise interference by planes,
helicopters and Caltrains.
Although "Flubber" is set in a
fictional Midwestern town called
Medfield, it is being filmed at cam

puses throughout the Bay Area, in
cluding Sim Francisco State and
San Jose State universities.
"We looked around in the Mid
west but decided to do it in the West
mainly because the crews and facil
ities are good in this area," said
Rory Enke, the location manager.
"Also, this area is visually very
nice."
Most of "Flubber" is being
filmed on stage sets on Treasure Is
land, a man-made island in San
Francisco Bay.
Friday's set was closed to the
public, but passers-by were able to
watch the scenes easily from the
sidelines. In some cases, passers-by
also participated in the scenes.
Although they had not signed
up to be extras, freshmen Dan Levy
and Jeremy Kassebaum came to
see the shoot and ended up being in
several takes.

"We walked over here because
we were bored, and we just followed
the crowd and reset when (the pro
duction assistants] said reset," said
Kassebaum.
Extras were required to have
breaks every five hours due to
union regulations. At breaks, ex
tras ate and rested in what the pro
duction assistants called the "hold
ing area," inside Maples.
When their part in each take
was over, extras watched Robin
Williams perform his part in the
scenes. In between scene takes,
Williams spoke with several groups
of extras.
"He asked if we were warm
enough and if he could get us extra
clothes," said sophomore Jen
Davis.
"I feel like I'm running for of
fice," Williams quipped as he shook
hands with groups of extras.
