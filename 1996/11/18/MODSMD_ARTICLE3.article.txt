## Over 700 star in 'Flubber' 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
Stanford students and staff
got a taste of Hollywood Friday
night, and they didn't even have
to leave campus.
Nearly 700 people from Stan
ford and the surrounding com
munities worked as extras in
Walt Disney's new movie,
"Flubber."
The movie, which stars
Robin Williams, is a remake of
"The Absent-Minded Profes
sor." It will be released next fall.
The site of Friday's shoot,
Maples Pavilion, was trans
formed into the movie's fictional
Rutland Arena by "Flubber"
crews, who arrived at 5 a.m. Fri
day.
A plaque reading "Rutland
Arena" and an enormous "R"
were placed on the outside wall
of the building. The crews also
replaced the lights outside the
pavilion with photographically
correct light bulbs.
