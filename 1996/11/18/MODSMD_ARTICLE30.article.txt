# Cardinal brings down Alabama in battle of the giants
## No. 1 women's basketball stops the second-ranked Crimson Tide 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
The moment was there to be
had by the top-ranked Stanford
women's basketball team.
Facing No. 2 Alabama in the
season-opening game before a
national television audience and
6,950 Maples maniacs in midsea
son form, along with the return of
head coach Tar a VanDerveer after
guiding the U.S. national team to
golden glory, there was good rea
son for a festive atmosphere.
But in the end, it was about the
basketball and the Cardinal, con
sidered to be the best, showing the
nation why Stanford is the team to
beat and knocking off the Crimson
Tide 74-65 in the fourth annual
State Farm Tip-Off Classic.
Stanford, with 10 returning
players, got remarkable post play
from juniors Naomi Mulitauaopele
(14 points) and Olympia Scott, who
had a team-high 18 points on siz
zling 8-of-ll shooting. Junior
Heather Owen provided a big lift
off the bench with 11 points while
senior Kate Starbird (only eight
points on 3-of-6 shooting) led the
team with nine assists, tying her
career high.
"I was very pleased with the
post play," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "Heather
Owen did a great job in the post."
Despite getting hammered on
the offensive glass by a convincing
28-11 margin, Stanford was able to
build a big enough lead early on to
hold off a furious Tide rally in the
closing moments of the contest.
"It was a situation where they
did a great job on the boards," Van-
Derveer said. Alabama "is very ath
letic and physical, but we've got to
get serious in getting to the glass if
we want to play in the big leagues."
Another area of concern was
turnovers. Stanford had 18 of the
game's 34. The key culprits were
junior forward Vanessa Nygaard,
senior point guard Jamila Wide
man and Starbird, who all had four
apiece. Nevertheless, Wideman felt
that they showed their mettle by
playing above this problem.
"I was very happy to get out
with a win," she said. "I'm glad we
fought through our mistakes and
came out with a win."
If Stanford's rebounding was
not big-league, its defense certainly
was. The Tide shot a meager 28.9
percent from the floor, including a
6-for-25 shooting afternoon from
senior forward Shalonda Enis, a
preseason All-American. It was
apparent that the services of junior
point guard Brittney Ezell were
sorely missed. A starter all of last
season, she mysteriously sat out
the game, a point which Alabama

head coach Rick Moody declined to
elaborate on.
"We missed her very, very
badly," Moody said. "She can really
make a difference for us."
Nevertheless, what the game
lacked in beauty, it made up for in
intensity and atmosphere. Maples
was rocking from the start and
both teams came out full speed,
rarely letting up throughout.
But it was Alabama who hit the
first speed bump after tying the
score at 6-6 on a Enis layup with 4
minutes gone.
The Cardinal ripped off seven
straight points, capped off by a
Scott layup with the assist from
Starbird. The Tide could only
muster one hoop by junior guard
Leah Monteith in 6 1/2 minutes as
the Stanford lead ballooned to 19-8
with 9:32 left in the half.
Meanwhile, Mulitauaopele was
starting to make her presence felt,
keeping her team's double-digit
lead despite the efforts of
Dominique Canty. Canty, a 5-foot
-9 sophomore guard, teamed up
with Monteith to make a game of it
as the pair scored 14 of Alabama's
final 17 points of the half.
But the Cardinal was not to be
denied, as Owen found her range,
hitting on a jumper from the top of
the key for a commanding 37-24
lead with about a minute to go.
Meanwhile, the Stanford defense
clamped down on the rest of the
sagging Alabama attack, holding
the Tide to 4-of-20 shooting and
causing eight first-half turnovers.
"I thought the team played
sound defense and got their hands
on the ball," VanDerveer said. "We
mixed up the defense a little,
although not as much as we want
to. But I thought we had good pres
sure on the ball."
The second half opened with
Enis and Watkins connecting from
the outside to slice the lead to 38-32
with 2 minutes elapsed. But Scott,
picking up where Mulitauaopele
left off, hit on three successive pos
sessions to put her team back up by
nine. Then Moody finally figured
out what hurt Stanford in the
squads' only previous meeting in
the NCAA regional semifinal last
March — pound the ball inside and
get the Cardinal in foul trouble.
The plan worked as Starbird
and Mulitauaopele picked up their
third personal fouls 18 seconds
apart halfway through the second
frame. Furthermore, Enis and
Canty were getting follow-up shots
time and time again. Still, Stanford
maintained a steady seven to 10
point advantage throughout the
middle stages of the second half.
A scary moment occurred when
Monteith and Starbird collided on
the perimeter, leaving both on the

floor. Starbird returned a minute
later to a standing ovation. She
quickly pleased the crowd by nail
ing a 17-foot jumper from the right
corner to put her team up 60-49
with 7:27 to go.
But just when it appeared the
Cardinal had the game in hand,
Alabama went on an 11-4 run high
lighted by another three-point
strike from Watkins and a Canty
layup that sliced the Cardinal
advantage to 64-60 with only 4
minutes left. But Scott came up
with yet another basket, and after
the Tide closed the gap again, Muli
tauaopele made her only second

half hoop count as she stuck a dag
ger in Alabama's heart by draining
a 16-footer from the left corner for
a 70-62 lead with 2:25 to go.
With the exciting play of her
team, VanDerveer was glad to see
her return to the Stanford sideline
was overshadowed.
"I was a little uncomfortable
with the attention, but I guess it
comes with the territory," Van-
Derveer said. "In a way, it was a
distraction from Stanford and the
team. I told them [the fans] are not
here to watch me, they're here to
watch you. I want our team to have
a great season and be a part of it."
