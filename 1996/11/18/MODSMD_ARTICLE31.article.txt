# Cardinal wins battle in the paint
## 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
Those of you who tuned into
the No. 1 Stanford women's bas
ketball game against second
ranked Alabama may have
noticed something a bit different
about this year's squad.
It wasn't a lack of chest-bump
ing or team dances with the Dol
lies â€” although these aspects of
the Cardinal repertoire are gone
for good. It was the way the Car
dinal won the scrappy 74-65 con
test.
The transition game was slow
and at times nonexistent while
defensive rebounding was almost
an Achilles heel. Stanford wasn't
even having a great shooting
game from the perimeter, but it
found a way to maintain its com
posure and the lead throughout
the game.
That "way" proved to be the
team's post play. Stanford (1-0)
was greeted by standing ovations
from the Cardinal faithful and
the hoopla of a nationally tele
vised game between the top two
schools in the nation. Stanford
responded with a win that was
exciting, intense, at times sloppy
and indicative of what the future
may hold for this team.
The game "was really excit
ing," senior point guard Jamila
Wideman said. "All the attention
it got was really important. We
were happy to get out with a win;
it wasn't our best performance."
Despite a subpar performance
Stanford managed to keep the
No. 2 team in the nation at bay
through consistent play, both
offensively and defensively, in the
paint despite foul trouble from all
the Cardinal's big players.
In the first half Stanford suc
cessfully defended the two big
guns for Alabama, seniors
Shalonda Enis and Yolanda
Watkins as the duo only com
bined for nine points at the half.
Watkins, who was playing her
first game back from knee
surgery, got into foul trouble as
well and only had two points in
the first period.
"We did a good job on post
defense," Scott said. "We've been
working on a lot of defenses.
[There's one] where I'm picking
up the point guard."
The diversity of this team
makes preparing for Stanford a
defensive nightmare for oppo
nents and the Card proved yes
terday that it doesn't have to
depend on one key player to pro
duce the win. Stanford's leading
scorer from last season, senior
Kate Starbird who put up 27
points against Alabama in last
season's overtime win in the
NCAA tournament, had just

eight points while four other Car
dinal players put up double fig
ures.
Junior center Olympia Scott
blazed through the first 5 min
utes of the game for Stanford. A
jumper, two layups and a free
throw from Scott lifted the Cardi
nal to a 13-6 lead with 13 min
utes, 58 seconds left in the half,
but two personal fouls sidelined
Scott with seven points and five
rebounds.
Junior forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele picked up where her
teammate left off and pummeled
the Crimson Tide with jumper
after jumper to finish the first
half leading all scorers with 12.
"Overall, all of [Stanford's post
players) were in a zone," Enis
said. Scott and Mulitauaopele
"were moving better [than last
year], I think their post game was
really great. Every player was on,
hitting every shot."
The Crimson Tide was unable
to stop Stanford's post players
and that proved to be the differ
ence in the game. Scott had a
game-high 18 while Muli
tauaopele followed up with 14
and junior Heather Owen fin
ished with 11. Widernan also
added 13 for the Card.
Despite the success of the
inside game, the team was hurt
by foul trouble throughout the
second half. Junior forward
Vanessa Nygaard, Mulitauaopele,
Scott and Starbird each had four
fouls and Owen had three.
"Our team played good
defense," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "Unfortunately, we
had some people in foul trouble.
Foul trouble limits what you can
do."
One thing Stanford didn't do
was effectively block out the
Crimson Tide. Alabama pulled 28
offensive rebounds, but a low
field goal percentage (28.9 per
cent) saved the Cardinal from
what could have been a disastrous
loss. As a result, Stanford's tran
sition game rarely surfaced.
"It was a situation where I
thought [Alabama! did a great job
on the boards; they had second
and third shots on free throws,"
VanDerveer said. "It's really hard
to [run] when you don't rebound
the ball. We're going to have to
look at this game and get commit?
ted to getting on the boards."
Stanford will look at this game
and determine what needs to be
improved upon. Rebounding,
transition, outside shooting and
staying out of foul trouble will all
go on the list, but the exceptional
post play of this team stands
above all other aspects of this
game as the gem that can carry
the squad when the other parts
aren't quite working.
