# International leaders predict positive global relations
## Americans' futures are interrelated 'with the futures of people all around the world' 
### Elizabeth Goldman Editorial staff 
Members of the Institute for Interna
tiona] Studies' Advisory Council meeting at
Stanford last week gave an overall positive
view about future developments on the glob
al scale.
The advisory council convened on cam
pus last week to give input to and gather in
formation from the institute, which is di
rected by Prof. Walter Falcon. The council's
chair is George Shultz, a distinguished fel
low at Stanford's Hoover Institution.
At a lunch with students Friday in Rick
er Dining Hall, former Soviet Foreign Min
ister Alexander Bessmertnykh and former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley discussed chal
lenges facing their respective countries as
they move into the 21st century.
Bradley encouraged students to get in
volved with developing what he termed a
structure and a story for the United States

to use in its relations with the rest of the
world.
With no strategic threat to the country
today, the United States faces a different
challenge: to lead "from the power of our ex
ample," he said.
"There is a danger in a world of no strate
gic threats," Bradley added. "That danger is
that we would turn away and look only to do
mestic concerns."
With a significant portion of the economy
connected to foreign policy, he said, isola
tionism is a mistake.
"The important thing is to get Americans
to realize how interrelated our futures are
with the futures of people all around the
world," he said.
Bessmertnykh said Russia continues to
have problems dealing with the end of the
Cold War.
"Some people believe the Cold War had
winners and the Cold War had losers," he
said. "If you follow that line of logic, you'll

have a problem understanding on a global
scale."
Russians, having lived within the Russ
ian empire and the U.S.S.R. before entering
their current state, have to define their
"wants, interests and destiny," he said.
Opening up the council sessions on
Thursday, several leaders discussed re
gions' prospects with regard to economics
and politics.
Former Mexican Finance Minister Pedro
Aspe said Latin American countries are
making progress politically.
"We have continued political reform, and
everything is geared toward more open soci
eties," he said.
But trade reorganization and deregula
tion — two steps he saw as necessary in im
proving the region's fiscal aspects — are
making slower progress. "We have not had
reversals," he said, "but the speed of re
forms has slowed down."
Former Israeli President Chaim Herzog

said the Middle East, and Israel in particu
lar, are "at a crossroads" right now.
"We have moved further today that I ever
thought we would," he said, but he acknowl
edged that some problems have arisen be
cause of the changes in government policy
since Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was as
sassinated a year ago.
A major challenge the Middle East faces
is to improve the economies of Israel's
neighbors, Herzog said. While Israel's per
capita annual income has risen to $17,000,
he said, that number ls only $600 to $2,000
in surrounding countries.
But there is reason to be optimistic, he
added. "We are in line now to emulate what
has occurred in Southeast Asia."
Japan, meanwhile, continues to struggle
with a sluggish economy, according to Fuji
Xerox CEO Tony Kobayashi.
"The gut feeling in the business world is
that we have still yet to feel comfortable with
the recovery" from a stock market crash and

other recent economic problems, he said.
Japan needs to develop a structure for
change, including a deregulation of the
economy, Kobayashi said. While the econo
my grows, basic needs of some people are not
being filled.
Still, he said, "I personally have very pos
itive feelings towani the future of this gov
ernment. We still have room in which we can
affect the economy from today to 2001."
Former German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt said Europe is facing a number of
difficulties as it moves toward more unity
within the European Union and faces the
changes brought about by the fall of Com
munism in Eastern Europe.
Western Europe is "suffering from a very
high degree of unemployment," Schmidt
said.
The European Union is progressing well,
Schmidt said. Within two years, most mem
bers of the union are likely to be using a com
mon currency, he predicted.
