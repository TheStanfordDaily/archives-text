# University hosts special AIDS event

In a hallmark event during Sat
urday's football game, Stanford be
came the first university to sponsor
"Until There's a Cure Day," a day
dedicated to AIDS awareness.
The Until There's a Cure Foun
dation is a nonprofit organization
that encourages compassion for
people living with HIV / AIDS. The
organization also funds vaccine de
velopment, care services and educa
tion efforts.
Stanford's half-time tribute in
cluded an address by ASSU Presi
dent Bill Shen, who spoke about the
seriousness of the disease which in
fects two Americans under the age
of 20 every hour.
Shen said students may feel insu
lated at Stanford but they shouldn't
forget about "real-world problems,"
such as AIDS.
"Just because we're busy does
not mean we're immune," Shen
said.
Senior Sarah Foster, co-director
of the Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center, also spoke, citing the grow
ing number of young people affected
by the virus.
"One in two AIDS cases in the
U.S. is diagnosed among those
under 25 years of age," Foster said.
"This statistic alone suggests that
our generation, more than any
other, is at risk for this disease."
Both Shen and Foster listed sev
eral alarming statistics meant to
make students think about the
range of the epidemic which is now
the leading cause of death among
Americans ages 35 to 44 — both

men and women.
"The number of HIV-infected
people in the U.S. is about one in
250," Foster said. "According to the
Centers for Disease Control, the
number of AIDS cases among
women is doubling every one to two
years, making women the fastest
growing population to be infected
with HIV."
Two women from Woodside,
Kathleen Scutchfield and Dana
Cappiello, started the Until There's
a Cure Foundation in 1993 after
Cappiello's friend died of AIDS.
The organization raises money
by selling designer cuff bracelets,
called The Bracelet, which feature
the familiar AIDS ribbon. Bracelets,
which were sold during Saturday's
game against Washington State
University, range in price from $20
to $500.
Proceeds from bracelet sales will
help fund vaccine developments and
many organizations, including the
Stanford Positive Care Clinic and
ARIS of Santa Clara County. Re
cent donations to the foundation
have funded such things as a White
House Report on Youth and
HIV / AIDS, the International
AIDS Vaccine Initiative and the
AIDS Walk.
The Stanford Band, which was
on the field at the time, assembled
itself in an AIDS ribbon formation
during the presentation. The large
AIDS awareness quilt — the Names
Project Memorial Quilt Panels,
which has a panel for each person
lost to the disease — was scheduled
to be brought out onto the field, but
the rain prevented it from being dis
played.
