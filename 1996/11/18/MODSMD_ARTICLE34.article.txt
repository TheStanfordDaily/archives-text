# '96-'97 Directory is hot off the presses
## 
### Jennifer Wang Contributing writer 
The long-awaited Stanford Directory will be
distributed to dorms and campus departments
today.
Undergraduate students living on campus
can expect to receive their Directories from
their resident assistants, while students who
live off campus may pick up their books at the
ASSU office today.
Graduate students and faculty will receive
the Directory through their departments, and
all others may purchase a copy at the Bookstore
for $9.95.
This year the Directory was completed right
on time, although Project Director Danny
Bressler said, "It is always a challenge. It's a
bigger job every year."
According to Bressler, the most significant
change to this year's Directory is the expan
sion of the Virtual Directory on the World
Wide Web. Located at http://www
directory.stanford.org, the Virtual Directory
not only allows businesses more space and cre
ativity in providing price and location informa-

tion, but it also is easier to access.
Students and staff can find what they are
looking for at the click of a button with a "yel
low pages" search engine.
This year about 1,000 businesses chose to ad
vertise with the Directory, an increase of 25 per
cent from last year. Of these, about 175 have ex
panded pages on the Web, many of them even
publishing coupons that students can print and
use.
Job-hunting students will be interested in
the recruiting section, which lists about 25
businesses.
According to Directory Business Manager
Andrew Blachman, "The trend in the future is
to eliminate the (paper) Directory all together."
Much of the promotional effort is being made to
increase awareness of the Web site.
For example, the back page of the "Mini-
Pages" this year was devoted to advertising the
Virtual Directory.
Although the Directory grows in size every
year, most of its content has remained the
same. "The look and the feel of the book itself is
the same," Bressler said. "We havejust tried to
make what we already have better."

Most of the subtle changes were designed to
make the book more intuitive. For example, the
former heading "Campus Directory" was re
vised to "University Offices and Departments"
and the heading "University Information
Guide" was changed to "Organizations and
Services."
These differences were the result of infor
mal surveys taken by the Directory's staff. Stu
dents felt that a name like "Campus Directory"
was vague and did not give any information
about the content of that section, Bressler said.
The Stanford Directory is known for its
quality throughout the country and is one of
the few completely student-produced official
phone and campus information guides.
Blachman, a senior, said he has gotten posi
tive feedback from other directories in Califor
nia, including the company that helps UC-
Berkeley produce its campus guide.
"Other colleges look toward Stanford and
say we are by far the best," he said.
The Directory, a subset of the ASSU's Stan
ford Student Enterprises, employs more than
20 students. All profits go to help fund other
student publications on campus.
