# Merger path cleared
## Medical centers will operate collectively by July 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
Thanks to key approvals on Friday, the
proposed merger between Stanford Health
Services and UC-San Francisco Medical
Center now has a clear road ahead to com
pletion by July, according to administrators
from both schools.
Meanwhile, opponents are looking to the
courts and the government to stop the move.

On Friday, a three-person subcommittee
of Stanford's Board of Trustees voted to ap
prove the merger on behalf of the whole
board, and the board of SHS did likewise. In
a separate meeting, the UC Board of Regents
voted 14-2 to uphold the recommendation of
a regents' committee that had given ap
proval on Wednesday.
The current plan provides for a private,


Casper
nonprofit corporation tentatively
named UCSF Stanford Health
Care to run the clinical operations
of both medical centers while
maintaining separate medical
schools. Both sides expect to have
USHC operational by July 1.
SHS President Peter Van Etten
said he was "very pleased to have
met this milestone."
While he acknowledged that
there is "an enormous amount of
work" to be done in working out
the details of the merger, he said
SHS does not "see any obstacles
that would preclude us" from
achieving the merger, which has
been presented as helping the hos
pitals by aiding cost-cutting and
providing opportunities for acade
mic cooperation.
The cost-cutting, Van Etten
added, will go on at least initially in
administrative areas through such
things as economies of scale and
combined purchasing.
He said he does not foresee
USHC consolidating clinical ser
vices by closing down facilities at
one location if they exist at both.
He also noted that both universi
ties have committed to re-hiring 95
percent of all affected employees.
Stanford University President
Gerhard Casper said in a state
ment that USHC "will be more
than the sum of our parts, going
from leadership in six specialties
separately to leadership in 20."
Associate Dean of Stanford's
Medical School Peter Gregory
agreed, predicting that USHC
would be "a clinical enterprise that
is second to none in the country."
The next step, according to Van
Etten, will be working out agree
ments to establish the full struc
ture of USHC, including employ

ment structure, and supervise the
full transfer of assets from SHS
and UCSF.
Opponents of the merger, how
ever, as well as some supporters,
identified other factors that might
influence the merger's progress.
Mary Higgins, president of the
clerical workers' local of the Amer
ican Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, said
unions hope to oppose the merger
through both court action and mo
bilizing public opinion.
Unions and other opponents on
the UC side have most frequently
objected to giving up state control
to a private entity, which Higgins
said would lead to an emphasis on
financial concerns over patient
care, as well as have a negative im
pact on employees and the finances
of the UC system.
Regent Jess Bravin said he
voted against the merger because
having an entirely private USHC is
not "in the best interests of the
state of California."
He said that he thought the de
cision for the merged company to
be completely private was based on
"very flimsy reasons," notably on
the insistence of Stanford officials.
Higgins said the unions would
"keep fighting" and noted the deci
sion by Superior Court Judge
William Cahill to review financial
documents connected with SHS
and UCSF to see whether they
should be made public over the ob
jections of both schools, which
have argued that the documents
are confidential because of Stan
ford's status as a private institu
tion.
UCSF has made public the find
ings of a third-party review team it
commissioned, which concluded in
its report that the merger was a
"sound business decision" for
UCSF
Higgins said the unions hoped
to be able to conduct their own

WHAT THE MERGER WILL DO

• The merger creates a new nonprofit corporation known as UCSF
Stanford Health Care, which will control the clinical operations of both
medical centers. There will still be two separate medical schools.
Proponents say the merger will allow for administrative savings and
combined research. Opponents say USHC will have an undue empha
sis on financial concerns to the detriment of patient care and teaching.

THE ROAD AHEAD

• The two schools still need to reach detailed agreements about the
workings of USHC and the transfer of assets. There is also the possi
bility of legal challenges and government intervention. The target date
for USHC to be fully operational is July 1.

analysis. The unions are also
awaiting action on a complaint
filed by the state Public Employee
Relations Board, as well as hear
ings in the state legislature, Hig
gins said.
Higgins also referred to an ad
vertising campaign by the unions
to win public opinion against the
merger, which she said was already
yielding surprisingly good results.
She pledged to "keep building com
munity support."
Both Higgins and Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis, an ex officio regent who
voted in favor of the proposal,
noted the possibility of interven
tion by the state attorney general,
on grounds that might include a
breach of public trust in privatiz
ing the UCSF Medical Center or
antitrust concerns.
A spokesman from the Attorney
General's Office refused to com
ment on the merger, saying the of
fice had not had adequate time to
review the proposal.
Spyros Andreopoulos, former
director of communications at
Stanford's Medical School, who
has written articles in several
newspapers arguing against the
merger, also identified the possibil
ity of taxpayer lawsuits and action
by the federal government.
Van Etten minimized the threat

of legal action stopping the move.
"We believe," he said, "that the
organization we've structured is
entirely within the law."
But Andreopoulos said he was
"very doubtful that the proposed
merger is good for Stanford."
He said the agreement as it
stands lacks guarantees that
USHC will give proper support to
the academic aspects of the opera
tions. He suggested that Stan
ford's Faculty Senate look into
what effects the merger might
have on teaching and research is
sues.
He also said Stanford needs to
"get its own house in order" with
regard to both financial and acade
mic issues rather than merging
with a comparable academic insti
tution with many of the same fi
nancial problems.
"Given the penury of both the
bride and groom," Andreopoulos
said, "one wonders why they
court."
One key aspect of the merger,
however, has escaped the notice of
both administrators and unions. A
security guard at UCSK Medical
Center identified one clear advan
tage that school stands to gain
from Stanford.
"We're proud to have your foot
ball team," he said.

Thanks to key approvals on Friday, the
proposed merger between Stanford Health
Services and UC-San Francisco Medical
Center now has a clear road ahead to com
pletion by July, according to administrators
from both schools.
Meanwhile, opponents are looking to the
courts and the government to stop the move.

On Friday, a three-person subcommittee
of Stanford's Board of Trustees voted to ap
prove the merger on behalf of the whole
board, and the board of SHS did likewise. In
a separate meeting, the UC Board of Regents
voted 14-2 to uphold the recommendation of
a regents' committee that had given ap
proval on Wednesday.
The current plan provides for a private,


Casper
nonprofit corporation tentatively
named UCSF Stanford Health
Care to run the clinical operations
of both medical centers while
maintaining separate medical
schools. Both sides expect to have
USHC operational by July 1.
SHS President Peter Van Etten
said he was "very pleased to have
met this milestone."
While he acknowledged that
there is "an enormous amount of
work" to be done in working out
the details of the merger, he said
SHS does not "see any obstacles
that would preclude us" from
achieving the merger, which has
been presented as helping the hos
pitals by aiding cost-cutting and
providing opportunities for acade
mic cooperation.
The cost-cutting, Van Etten
added, will go on at least initially in
administrative areas through such
things as economies of scale and
combined purchasing.
He said he does not foresee
USHC consolidating clinical ser
vices by closing down facilities at
one location if they exist at both.
He also noted that both universi
ties have committed to re-hiring 95
percent of all affected employees.
Stanford University President
Gerhard Casper said in a state
ment that USHC "will be more
than the sum of our parts, going
from leadership in six specialties
separately to leadership in 20."
Associate Dean of Stanford's
Medical School Peter Gregory
agreed, predicting that USHC
would be "a clinical enterprise that
is second to none in the country."
The next step, according to Van
Etten, will be working out agree
ments to establish the full struc
ture of USHC, including employ

ment structure, and supervise the
full transfer of assets from SHS
and UCSF.
Opponents of the merger, how
ever, as well as some supporters,
identified other factors that might
influence the merger's progress.
Mary Higgins, president of the
clerical workers' local of the Amer
ican Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, said
unions hope to oppose the merger
through both court action and mo
bilizing public opinion.
Unions and other opponents on
the UC side have most frequently
objected to giving up state control
to a private entity, which Higgins
said would lead to an emphasis on
financial concerns over patient
care, as well as have a negative im
pact on employees and the finances
of the UC system.
Regent Jess Bravin said he
voted against the merger because
having an entirely private USHC is
not "in the best interests of the
state of California."
He said that he thought the de
cision for the merged company to
be completely private was based on
"very flimsy reasons," notably on
the insistence of Stanford officials.
Higgins said the unions would
"keep fighting" and noted the deci
sion by Superior Court Judge
William Cahill to review financial
documents connected with SHS
and UCSF to see whether they
should be made public over the ob
jections of both schools, which
have argued that the documents
are confidential because of Stan
ford's status as a private institu
tion.
UCSF has made public the find
ings of a third-party review team it
commissioned, which concluded in
its report that the merger was a
"sound business decision" for
UCSF
Higgins said the unions hoped
to be able to conduct their own

WHAT THE MERGER WILL DO

• The merger creates a new nonprofit corporation known as UCSF
Stanford Health Care, which will control the clinical operations of both
medical centers. There will still be two separate medical schools.
Proponents say the merger will allow for administrative savings and
combined research. Opponents say USHC will have an undue empha
sis on financial concerns to the detriment of patient care and teaching.

THE ROAD AHEAD

• The two schools still need to reach detailed agreements about the
workings of USHC and the transfer of assets. There is also the possi
bility of legal challenges and government intervention. The target date
for USHC to be fully operational is July 1.
