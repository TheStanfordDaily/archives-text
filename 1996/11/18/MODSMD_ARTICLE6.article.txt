### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
Grammy Award-winning
country vocalist Trisha Year
wood discussed the music indus
try and the direction country
music is moving with about 50
people in Campbell Recital Hall
Friday.
The small but energized audi
ence was made up mostly of coun
try music aficionados from ofF
campus.
Yearwood began giving such
talks in 1995 when she was first
contacted by the event's sponsor.
Discover Card. She has spoken at
12 different colleges as a part of
her 1996 U.S. tour.
Yearwood, a self-described
"nice little Southern girl,'' spent
most of her childhood in rural
Monticello, Ga. Her interest in
singing began early.
"I wanted to sing since I was 5
years old," Yearwood said. "I
wanted to be like Cher, which I
don't tell many people."
After earning an associate de
gree in business from a small ju
nior college, Yearwood attended
Belmont College in Nashville,
Tenn., and graduated with a de

gree in business adm nistration
concentrating on the music in
dustry. She did not receive any
notable musical training.
At school, Yearwoon met a lot
of influential songwriters and
"took every t pportunity to sing,"
she said.

I was 5 years old. I
wanted to be like Cher,
which I don't tell many
people.'

Yearwood described her deci
sion to try and make it as a coun
try music vocalist as "overcoming
a lot of voices of fear," saying that
eventually her "fear of failure
was overcome by the desire to
give it a try."
Throughout those years, Year
wood continued to sing and did a
few concerts in bars and clubs in
the surrounding area. She de-
scribed her father, a retired
banker, and mother, a retired
schoolteacher, as being "freaked
out inside" about her decision to
sing but nonetheless "still sup
portive."
Eventually Yearwood signed a
six-album deal with MCA
Records and has since sold 7 mil
lion records. She has also pro
duced many music videos.
She attributed her success to
aggressiveness. "There's a
Catch-22: To get a job you have to
know people, but to know people
you have to get a job," said Year
wood. "You have to be aggres
sive."
Instead of describing herself
as a gifted country music vocal
ist, however, Yearwood prefers to
designate herself as a "commer
cial success" and a "corpora
tion." She is proud of the fact
that she manages her business
very well.
Yearwood also commented on
recent trends in the country
music industry.
"If you listen to country music
30 years ago — they were crazy,"
said Yearwood. Today there is
"too much out there that isn't
creative. There is oversatura
tion."
Yearwood lambasted the
country music industry for pos
sessing a "Hollywood mentality"
and discouraging originality and
inventiveness.
"There are serious artists and
those who want to be on the
radio," Yearwood commented.
"Just wearing a hat and striped
shirts doesn't make you George
Strait.
"Artists should be allowed to
be whoever they are. Singers
having nothing to do with being
artists [and] who don't know
anything about music" are be
coming famous.
Yearwood begged prospective
country music vocalists and
bands to fight the mainstream
country music industry.
