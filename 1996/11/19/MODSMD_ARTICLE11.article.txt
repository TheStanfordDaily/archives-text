## CIA agent charged with selling secrets to Russia 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
onetime CIA station chief was
charged yesterday with selling
top secrets to the Russians for
more than $120,000. The FBI
suspects that the highest-ranking
CIA officer ever charged with
espionage sold the identities of all
new CIA agent trainees in the
past two years.
The 16-year CIA veteran,
Harold J. Nicholson, 46, of
Burke, Va., "betrayed his country
for money. He was not motivated
by ideology but by greed," said
U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey. "He
had access to a great deal of very
damaging information."
An FBI affidavit said that
Nicholson had access to the
biographies and assignments of
every new CIA agent trained
from July 1994 to July 1996,
when he taught at the ClA's
secret Virginia training site, and
that evidence strongly indicated
Nicholson sold the material to

the Russians.
"As a result of this disclosure,
it will be difficult, if not impossi
ble, for the CIA to place some of
these newly trained case officers
into certain sensitive foreign
postings for the rest of their
careers," said FBI Agent Michael
Lonergan's affidavit.
Nicholson was arrested by FBI
agents at Dulles International
Airport in suburban Virginia Sat
urday afternoon as he was about
to leave for Switzerland, where
Fahey said he intended to meet
his Russian handlers.
In a rare news conference with
FBI Director Louis Freeh, CIA
Director John Deutch said, "Thus
far, we have no information that
any CIA or FBI assets were killed
as a result of Nicholson's spying."
No U.S. agents or sources abroad
appear to have been arrested
either, officials said.
Until a damage estimate i.Â«
completed, there is no wav to

"determine how many operations
he may have compromised, but i1
seems unlikely that the damagt
he caused in any way approaches
that done by (Aldrich) Ames,'
Deutch said.
The worst turncoat in CIA his
tory, counterintelligence officei
Ames pleaded guilty in 1994 tc
selling Russia information ovei
eight years for more than $2.E
million. U.S. officials attributec
the death of 10 Western agents
and the compromise of dozens oi
operations to Ames.
Fahey said there was no evi
dence of a connection betweer
Nicholson and Ames and no indi
cation that other U.S. citizens
worked with Nicholson.
Freehand Deutch said he was
arrested much earlier in his
alleged double-agent career than
Ames because of reforms, an
exchange of high-level personnel
and new FBI-CIA cooperatior
