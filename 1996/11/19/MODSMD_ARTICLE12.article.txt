# Recording reveals ValuJet terror
## 
### 
MIAMI (AP) — Passengers
screamed "Fire! Fire! Fire!"
and a flight attendant warned,
"We can't get oxygen back
there" during the final terrify
ing moments before ValuJet
Flight 592 plunged into the
Everglades, killing all 110 peo
ple aboard.
The chilling eight-minute
tape from the cockpit voice
recorder ends with the cockpit
and cabin falling silent, leav
ing the sound of rushing air,
perhaps from a cockpit win
dow that had been opened to
let the smoke out.
A transcript of the record
ing was released yesterday as
a hearing opened on the mis
takes that led to the May 11
crash. Federal investigators
believe that 144 oxygen-gener
ating canisters carried in the
DC-9's cargo hold either ignit

ed or fueled a fire.
Six minutes after takeoff
from Miami International Air
port, the pilot can be heard
telling the co-pilot: "We got
some electrical problems....
We're losing everything."
A few seconds later, the
voice recorder picked up
screams of passengers in the
cabin, including several
women shouting, "Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire!"
Over the next 51 seconds,
shouts were heard from the
cabin twice more and a flight
attendant said only, "Com
pletely on fire" before the
cabin fell silent. The last
recorded voice from the plane
was that of a crew member
telling the tower, "We need
the, uh, closest airport avail
able."
The plane crashed 2 min

utes, 22 seconds later.
While the flight attendant
warned that passengers could
not get oxygen, National
Transportation Safety Board
investigator Greg Feith said
there was not enough infor
mation to say what may have
happened to the oxygen masks
that drop down in front of pas
sengers during an emergency.
Relatives of the victims
hope the hearing will tell
them why their loved ones
died.
"I dreaded coming here,
but this is something that I
have to do in order to have
closure," said Gwendolyn
Marks, a nurse whose 23-
year-old son died in the crash.
"It may be painful, but it was
my child and I want to hear
what was going through his
mind, what was going on in

those last minutes."
Investigators did not
release the recording itself out
of concern for the feelings of
family members. That deci
sion upset Richard Kessler, an
Atlanta lawyer whose wife,
Kathleen, was killed.
"I'm going to Washington
after this to try to get them to
change the law," Kessler said.
By the time passenger
screams were heard inside the
aircraft, the decision had been
made to try to return to
Miami.
The tower controller, who
was listening on a separate cir
cuit and could not hear the
commotion in the plane, asked
what the problem was and
was told, "Smoke in the cock
pit ... smoke in the cabin."
The tower instructed the crew
to return.
