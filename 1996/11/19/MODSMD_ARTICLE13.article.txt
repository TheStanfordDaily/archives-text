Boutros-Ghali opposed
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The
United States stood alone yesterday in
opposing a second term for Boutros
Boutros-Ghali as the Security Council
met to pick a secretary-general to lead
the United Nations into the 21st centu
ry.
U.S. Ambassador Madeleine
Albright told the 14 other council mem
bers at a closed-door meeting that she
had written instructions to veto re-elec
tion for the Egyptian diplomat, saying
Boutros-Ghali has lost the confidence of
Congress.
Albright warned that Congress
would not let the United States make
good on its $1 billion U.N. debt as long
as Boutros-Ghali remains, diplomats
said on condition of anonymity.
But the United States was isolated
diplomatically in its campaign to oust
Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian. African

countries submitted a resolution calling
for Boutros-Ghali's re-election, and the
council scheduled a vote for today.
The Africans have insisted that their
continent deserves two terms of repre
sentation in the post, as has been U.N.
tradition.
Odwalla plant cleared
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Federal
tests have found no trace of the deadly
E. coli bacteria at Odwalla Inc.'s bot
tling plant, and the hunt has shifted to
growers and packers supplying the juice
maker, company officials said yester
day.
The results of U.S. Food and Drug
Administration tests at the Dinuba
plant was good news for the embattled
juice company, which was forced to
recall thousands of bottles of juice after
an E. coli outbreak in several Western
states and Canada.

Since late October, more than 50
children have been diagnosed with E.
coli or E. coli-related illnesses after
drinking Odwalla apple juice. The out
break has been blamed for the death of
a 16-month-old girl in Colorado.
What a brickhead!
LONDON (AP) - Why put a hun
dred bricks on your head? To get your
name in newspapers, of course â€” and
into the Guinness Book of Records.
John Evans, 49, from Heanor, Eng
land, secured his place in the Guinness
Book of Records yesterday at a London
Zoo event promoting the 1997 edition of
the book.
'Twas nothing, said Evans, who has
a 23 1/2-inch neck.
"I've done 200 pints of beer and bal
anced three people on my head before,"
he said. "I've got the strongest neck in
the world, and it never gets sore."
