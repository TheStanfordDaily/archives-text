# Refugees seek lost children

NKAMIRA. Rwanda (AP) â€” The
exhausted young mother, barefoot,
stepped inside the tent and scrutinized
the faces of hundreds of children playing
on the dirty floor and eating cookies.
Suddenly, she reached into the crowd
and grabbed out her 8-year-old daughter
by the arm.
Escorting the child out of the tent,
Marceline Myiramzbrimba broke into a
smile of relief. "I was holding her hand
yesterday, and then suddenly she disap
peared. I am so happy she is with me."
Myiramzbrimba is among 200 lucky
parents who found their sons and daugh
ters at a temporary camp on the Rwandan
border. There are still hundreds of lost
children here, separated from their par
ents during the confusion of a half-million
Hutu refugees streaming back to their
Rwandan homeland in the past four days.
These Hutu refugees fled into eastern
Zaire two vears ago, fearing retribution

from the Tutsi government for Rwanda's
genocide; Hutu militias had killed nearly
500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
The Hutu militiamen fled, too, and
lived among the refugees in U.N. camps,
using the civilians as human shields for
their cross-border attacks on Rwanda and
using intimidation and violence to keep
the refugees from going home.
Last week, Zairian rebels routed the
militiamen from the camps and freed the
refugees to begin a journey back to Rwan
da. The exodus started Friday.
The initial flight emptied the camp at
Mugunga, which during recent fighting
between Zaire's rebels and its army had
swelled into the world's largest refugee
outpost.
A half-million refugees choked roads
yesterday on both sides of the Rwanda-
Zaire border. They trudged east along the
scorching tarmac from the Zairian border
to the transit camp at Nkamira.
