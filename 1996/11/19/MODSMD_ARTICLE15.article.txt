## Editorial Problematic plywood

The Sigma Chi fraternity
lost supporters following
its citations for petty theft

WITH BEER NO longer
the feature of its parties,
has the Sigma Chi frater
nity resorted to plywood?
Come on, guys. We — as with a
large contingency of Stanford stu
dents — were on the fraternity's
side when Dean of Students Marc
Wais handed down a fairly harsh
probation to the Sigma Chis due to
the now infamous party held dur
ing Orientation. As there were no
written rules stating that parties
were not allowed during that
weekend, the probation did seem
rather strict.
But on Saturday night, the
group, apparently not trying to be
on best — or even law-abiding —
behavior during its probation, did
something stupid.
The Palo Alto Police Depart
ment cited five members of the
fraternity Saturday morning for
stealing plywood from a construc
tion site to use as party decora
tions. Residents of Palo Alto
observed the five suspects loading
sheets of plywood from a construc
tion site on College Avenue into a
tan van.
After the residents called the
police, the van was stopped at 5:11
a.m. Plywood sheets were easily
visible and one of the suspects had
a wire cutter, which is believed to
have been used to gain access to
the construction site. Other mate
rials, which had been stolen from
the site previously, had identical
serial numbers to materials found
in the Sigma Chi house.
Guess the little "we don't follow
unwritten rules" attitude can be
extended to "we don't follow any
rules — written or not."
But, what's done is done, and
now a central question remaining
is whether the entire Sigma Chi
fraternity should be held responsi
ble for the actions of five of its

members. In this case, the answer
is clearly yes.
Unlike past instances in which
fraternities have collectively been
held responsible for actions of
their members which were not
related to any fraternity activity,
this case clearly did relate to a
Sigma Chi event. According to
police, the plywood was stolen for
a party to be held that night by the
entire fraternity. Whether these
five members individually decided
that stolen plywood would look
cool as a party decoration is ques
tionable. Thus, the entire fraterni
ty should be held accountable.
At a time when the fraternity is
under close scrutiny for its previ
ous actions and there is a rocky
relationship between the Greeks
and the administration as a whole,
the actions of the Sigma Chis only
worsened both the group's image
and this larger relationship.
But, the Sigma Chis are not the
only students on campus who
deserve a reprimand for not abid
ing by the law.
Following the passage of Propo
sition 209, a marked change has
taken place in Stanford's stop
signs. A group adamantly opposed
to the proposition has spray paint
ed "209" under the word "stop" on
many of the campus' signs.
While this action probably has
more intellectually driven reasons
behind it than did the stealing of
plywood on the part of Sigma Chi,
the spray painting is no more
excusable. March, hold rallies, let
your opinion be heard. But don't
break the law by vandalizing prop
erty. Surely, this does nothing to
help the cause of affirmative
action.
Both incidents, though very dif
ferent in nature, show disrespect
for the law and others' property.
At a time when both responsible
groups are trying to be fairly treat
ed by the governing bodies above
them, they must be especially con
scious of their actions and images.
These recent incidents only hurt
their cases.
