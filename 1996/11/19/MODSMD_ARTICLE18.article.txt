## Our real motto: It's all good! 
### 
OTHER THAN UNIVERSITY
President Gerhard Casper, I've
yet to hear anyone properly pro
nounce our school motto: "Die Luft der
Freiheit Weht." (The winds of freedom
blow.) I butcher it every time I try to show
off my limited knowledge of German.
Other than being confused about the pro
nunciation of the guttural sounding
motto, I am perplexed by the merits of this
maxim. Is "Die Luft Der Freiheit Weht"
an accurate reflection of the attitudes and
values of Stanford's students and staff?
When Casper addressed the Stanford
Historical Society in October 1995, he
gave an in-depth history of the motto. By
and large, the slogan represents an idea of
"freedom of thought, speech and action."
However, I think our motto needs a sleek
new 21st century makeover, one that will
represent the changing vein in which the
winds of freedom are blowing.
We need a motto that jibes with the
ideals and values of every person that sets
foot on campus. Stanford undoubtedly
permits "the winds of freedom to blow,"
yet to say they merely blow is an under
statement. Our motto must implicate our
willingness to accept everything; nothing
is bad, everything is acceptable, you can't
fail — no grades lower than a C.
However, I have found a motto accept
able to all — one that nicely coincides
with Stanford's sunny California per
sona:
"Omnia bona sunt!" (It's all good!)
You laugh. Well, don't take my sugges

tion too lightly; I'm very serious about
modifying the motto. Consider the ramifi
cations: a motto that we all can pro
nounce. No more fumbling. "Omnia bona
sunt!" Finally, we'd have a motto that
everyone actually believes. How often do
you think ... "Oh, the winds of freedom
blow"?
As often as you find a TA who speaks
English.
Our attitude would finally ooze our
motto: "It's all good." Consider our atti
tude toward academics. You're taking a
class you love: "It's all good." Your taking
a class you loathe: "Omnia bona sunt."
You just aced your sociology midterm:
"It's all good!" You failed your CE 170
midterm: "It's all good."
What the hell?
Take our slant on sexuality. Are you
gay? Straight? Into a little of everything?
It's all good. Stanford will accommodate.
And if you disagree, it's still all good.
Because we would never want to disturb
the feel good nature of this university.
You're late for an engagement. Don't
chastise the tardy party; it's all good! We
can't hold anyone responsible for any
thing. "Time just flew by!" That's it;
blame it on "time." But it's all good.
Sometimes, you don't even have to show
up! "Forget what 1 said about being there
at 8 p.m. Saturday. Omnia bona sunt!"
Even the administration endorses our
undeclared, unofficial motto. So you can't
find a major you like! It's all good. Create
your own major.

Good luck finding a job in four years.
You have an unusual dietary restric
tion that demands you eat only tofu and
sprouts: "It's all good!" We'll create a
broccoli forest for you to adapt to — there
you can synergize your sinister efforts
with the rest of the "all-good" factions.
Hell, even religion is all good. We have
no problems or conflicts here on the
Farm. Omnia bona sunt. We'll just make
the University nondenominational
(which really means we won't have reli
gion at all); we'll accept everyone, all
groups. If a Buddhist wants to partake in
the Eucharist ... omnia bona sunt. Hey,
we're open-minded. Let's accept every
body. All world views have merit.
However, the brutal reality of our little
catch phrase is far from all good. The
result is a contingent of students devoid
of conviction, fickle as the wind.
So what does Stanford stand for any
way?
With our new motto, there would
never be any doubt. We stand for nothing.
We reject nothing, we accept everything,
we believe nothing: spineless. Omnia
bona sunt!
Perhaps the jellyfish would be a more
fitting mascot, too.
