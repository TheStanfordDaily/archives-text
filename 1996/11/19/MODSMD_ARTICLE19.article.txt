Organizer of recent protest responds to his critics

AS AN ORGANIZER of last Thurs
day's protest against the Colle
giate Health and Fitness Tour, I
would like to respond to Monday's letters
critical of the action.
Keith Chen's articulate letter is a valu
able contribution. But I must object to
his characterization of "the actions of the
student protesters" against the tour as
playing a "part (in the] trend" of "a grow
ing current of conservative reactionary
power rising from below, outmaneuver
ing us on a systematic level."
The protest, organized less than 12
hours in advance and outside the struc

ture of any campus student organization,
was as grass-roots and spontaneous as
they come; it "rose from below." The
protesters went to great pains to contex
tualize their action as part of a larger
campaign against reactionary corporate
influence; the protest was part of some
thing "systematic." The Daily, however,
chose to downplay both of these facts in
its coverage of the event, so I can under
stand Chen's misunderstanding.
I have a little more difficulty under
standing Dan Geyser's vitriol, however.
For example, he writes callously and dis
missively: "Go protest something in

Burma." As we articulated at the protest,
our objections were not to the mere pres
ence of advertisements in White Plaza,
but to the University's corporate mind
set. The decision that Stanford would
host the tour is indicative of a lack of con
cern on the part of the University for the
dangers of corporate influence. A less
benign example of Stanford's uncritical
stance toward corporations is the same
institutional stance which leads Stanford
to be complicit in and to profit by corpo
rate crime, an example of which is Texa
co's involvement in Burma. One point
constantly reiterated by the protesters,

myself included, is that talk of "disinvest
ment" and "shareholder influence" must
end; the Board of Trustees must vote to
divest from Texaco. The trustees' deci
sion not to is an ethical outrage; as long
as Stanford invests in that criminal
enterprise called "Texaco Inc.," Burmese
bloodshed will fund our college education.
I have no reply to Geyser's remark
that "you all are insane, not to mention
paranoid." As for being "in desperate
need of finding a hobby": Citizenship, Mr.
Geyser, is my hobby.
