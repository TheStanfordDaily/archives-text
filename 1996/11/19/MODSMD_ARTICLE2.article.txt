# Departments undergoing review
## Humanities and Sciences pushes evaluation of teaching and learning 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
In a process which began last year, all
departments in the School of Humanities
and Sciences are being given a "thorough
overhaul," according to Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences John Shoven.
The process is expected to take four
years and will be conducted by committees
composed of outside senior faculty. The re
views examine graduate and undergradu
ate curriculum, appointments and re
quirements.
"We want to assure continued
strength" of the University and depart

ments, said Shoven, who added that some
departments had not received this type of
review in more than 25 years.
Last year, the Chemistry, Political Sci
ence and Anthropology departments un
derwent the review. This year, the Histo
ry, Biology, Psychology and English de
partments are being examined.
The infrequency of the departmental
reviews is very different from that of inter
disciplinary programs, which face reviews
eveiy five years.
Interdisciplinary programs "have al
ways had that stipulation in their degree
granting programs," said Human Biology
Administrator Maria Drueckhammer.

The Human Biology Program, which
held its last review in December 1993, re
ceived favorable marks with minor recom
mendations and no major overhaul.
Drueckhammer said usually there are not
many surprises in the reviews because of
their frequency.
"With five years between reviews, you
know how things are going," Drueckham
mer said.
She added that she thought the reviews
were very thorough. Shoven did not neces
sarily agree.
"I cannot believe they do the kind of re-
view that we do at that frequen
cy," Shoven said. For departmen
tal reviews, he said, "We tear
things right down to the bottom
and examine everything."
However, Drueckhammer said
the methods of the interdepart
mental review are similar to those
of the external review. The only
difference is that the interdepart
mental examination is conducted
by Stanford faculty.
To prepare for the outside com
mittees, departments in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences are required to prepare a
document that outlines their
progress and send it to committee
members before they arrive on
campus.
"We try to review ourselves
first, so we can talk to Ithe outside
reviewers] intelligently," said His
tory Department Chair Norman
Naimark, whose department will

face review in the spring. "It's a
long and difficult process."
Four senior faculty members
from other schools came in mid-
October to complete the review of
the English Department.
According to Jay Fliegelman,
English Department chair,
Shoven just received the report
from the outside committee. The
next step will be for the English
Department to examine the report
and determine what needs im
provement.
Fliegelman said the last review
of the English Department was
conducted well over a decade ago.
Reviews conducted last year
have already yielded results. For
example, Chemistry Department
Chair Barry Trost said last year's
examination sparked major intro
spection in the department.
" It did get the department to sit
down and evaluate things that
don't normally get addressed. We
try to identify more clearly .. .
what we are doing right, what we
are doing wrong and what we can
do in the future," Trost said.
