# Isn't it ironic? Protest and corporations used quite similar strategies

This letter is in regards to the par
ticularly amusing one written by Bret
J. Logue and Ally Field that The Daily
published on Friday. "Don't hand over
White Plaza to corporate America"
was absurd for many different rea
sons, primarily its rather arbitrary
criticism of corporate "propaganda." I
will fully agree that in our daily trials
and tribulations at Stanford, we stu
dents are indeed constantly assaulted
with propaganda. However, I fail to
discern the philosophical difference
between the message which is put
forth by corporate America and that
which is put forth by Logue and Field.
Both are nonobjective statements
which seek to convince a general pub
lic of a certain notion, and both
emphasize that their notion is the
only correct one. In other words, I see
no difference between someone telling
me to buy a Jeep and someone telling
me not to buy into corporate America,

other than the fact that the Jeep
option seems more attractive than the
preachy, self-righteous philosophy
adopted by Logue and Field.
The authors use the phrase "well
financed wisdom" to deride the corpo
rate sponsorship of the Collegiate
Health and Fitness Tour. I would like
to posit that well-financed wisdom is
infinitely more appealing than unfi
nanced drivel. Simply put, Stanford
students are reasonably intelligent.
Therefore, they can make the wisest
decisions possible according to their
own beliefs. And while the authors
believe that Stanford is trying to sell
our attention to the "materialists,
over-consumers, industrial polluters,
labor abusers and purveyors of capi
talist amorality," there is, of course,
an opposing viewpoint to consider:
namely, that Stanford is trying to sell
our attention to politically correct
morons.
The good news: It's capitalism,
baby. Everybody may be trying to sell
our attention, but we don't have to
buy anyone's bullshit. Caveat emptor,
and God bless America.
