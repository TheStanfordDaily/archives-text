# High-priced Big Game tickets part of antifan trend at Stanford
## 
### 
The closer Big Game approaches, the
angrier I become. Fifty dollars for a Big
Game ticket is utterly outrageous! And
with that ticket price, is there any doubt
why there are still thousands of remain
ing tickets? When I was a freshman
three years ago, Big Game tickets were
around $32. Economics majors can cal
culate the rise of inflation, but the
American economy is in serious trouble
if Big Game tickets are any indicator of
the inflation rate.
But I shouldn't be surprised. The
insulting treatment sports fans receive
at this school knows no bounds. This is
just one more abuse piled on the average
student trying to attend a sporting
event. Once upon a time, students were
able to freely walk into men's basketball
games and actually sit in the courtside
student section without raving, drunk
lunatics — in matching shirts because
there's safety in numbers — shouting
racist remarks at the opposing team.

And there wasn't even some huge man,
the ring leader of the matching shirts,
telling students they can't sit in the stu
dent section. Those were the days.
At first, "they" said the sponsorship
that had previously paid for students' free
entrance to basketball games ended,
which made sense until this sponsorship
only seemed to affect those popular sports
— like basketball and volleyball. One of
the old-timers (pre-1993) told me that the
student admission price for basketball
was initially dropped because students
never went to the games, and as soon as
the games were free, more students began
to attend again. A little popularity goes a
long way at Stanford University.
Needless to say, I won't be attending
Big Game or any other sporting event
where my money flows into the bottom
less void of Stanford athletics. People
probably will think I have no school
pride if I allow a little thing like money
to stand in the way of supporting my
school. And maybe they're right. But for
$50,1 could buy two Stanford sweat
shirts from the Stanford Bookstore, and
they sure as hell would last a lot longer
than a football game.
