# Tuesday Thoughts: Memorial Church
## Mem Chu: Toward a multifaith center 
### 
The stu
dent of
mythology
Joseph Camp
bell noted that
in medieval
times, the most
prominent
structure that
could be seen on
the horizon of a

city was the church and steeple.
Upon approaching the city, a
first glance would communicate
the power and influence of the
church. As one approaches the
Stanford University campus on
picturesque Palm Drive, a first
glance communicates the promi
nence and power of Memorial
Church. It is only after coming
very close that the church opens
to the panorama of arches and
architecture which define the
Quad.
What did Jane Stanford
intend by placing a church at the
center of the University? Are
her intentions reflective of the
reality of University life today?
We reap the benefits of the Stan
fords' vision for an academic
community in which excellence
and breadth are hallmarks; do
we also understand or benefit
from their vision of religion and
morality at the heart of Univer
sity life?
The Stanfords hoped that in
this University, a memorial to
their son, a certain kind of spiri
tual morality or moral spiritual
ity would be established. Sen.
Stanford expressed the hope
that graduates would possess "a
lofty sense of man's and
woman's responsibilities on
earth in accordance with the
highest teachings of morality
and religion." Jane Stanford
asserted that "no amount of
learning can take the place of
decency, and no amount of sci
ence can take the place of back
bone."

When Memo
rial Church was
built, Jane
Stanford
inscribed some
of her rationale

_ Yes |

for its presence into the walls of
the sanctuary. "The most
encouraging of all stimulating
influences to a noble life . . . [is]
the power of personal religion.
We need something outside of
and beyond ourselves."
Although decency and back
bone and spiritual morality were
to be present in this University,
there was never a requirement
for chapel attendance. No par
ticular religious denomination
was established by the Stan
fords; however, they took it for
granted that the religious influ
ence to be promoted at the Uni
versity would be Protestant
Christian.
Today their assertion of
Christian form and parlance
may be seen as restrictive and
narrow. But a century ago, their
approach was recognized as lib
eral and inclusive. The freedom
of inquiry of the University was
not to be interfered with by any
authoritarian church body.
Furthermore, the founders
wished to have teachers from
the great faith traditions of the
world speak from the pulpit of
Memorial Church. Rabbi Voor
sanger of Temple Emmanuel in
San Francisco was an important
participant at the church's
opening in 1903.
The assumption about the
centrality of religion which
informed the Stanfords' vision
has been challenged in the con
temporary,-secular world. Reli
gion is presently seen as a pri
vate affair. The prominence of a
church at the center of campus
is not consonant with that world
view. Furthermore, the support
of the University not just for a
church but for four deans for
religious life is a source of con
fusion for those who assume
that the intellectual quest is
devoid of religious, moral and
ethical foundations.
Understanding the private
nature of contemporary reli
gious life and that one nonde
nominational presence cannot
address the contemporary reali
ty of religious pluralism, the
University has invited religious
communities onto campus
through the Stanford Associated
Ministries. Thirty-one different
communities ranging from Jew
ish to Hindu to Islam to Rahai to
Catholic to many denominations
of Protestant Christianity are

present at Stanford
with their particu

lar theological
and ceremonial

earmarks.
Many at
Stanford gath
er for religious
worship and
study as a regu
lar part of their
week. For those
who practice
their religion
here, the Stan
fords' formula
tion of decency,
backbone and
spiritual moral-'
ity might seem
either too
generic or not
particularistic
enough. But in
their own reli-,
gious commu- j
nities, withj
their own dis-'
tinct language
and rituals, the
commitment to
addressing
matters of faith
in the context
of the Universi
ty is as conso
nant with

learning as

more — those with

out a religious lan- *
guage but with yearn

ings for something!
beyond themselves, the
presence of religious com

munities in Stanford's '
midst enables them to
explore questions of faith.

For some students, an

encounter with the academic

world challenges the religion of
their youth. As deans for reli
gious life, we are called upon to
engage in the conversation

between the
| world of ideas
and the world
of the spirit.
We hope that
' just as minds

are stretched at Stanford, so
one's view of faith and religious
traditions can be expanded and
challenged. Questions of our
place in the world, our responsi
bility to others, our understand
ing of what we are here for are
not only intellectual questions
but religious and spiritual ques
tions as well.
There are those who assert
with pride that they are reli
gious. There are also those who
identify themselves as spiritual
but not religious, connected to
"Something beyond themselves
but not comfortable with or
schooled in a particular religious
language.
Can these seekers also find a
place in the symbolic presence of
a church in the center of cam
pus? Can they see in its walls the
message that here intellectual
searching is accompanied by
spiritual searching?
Unfortunately, the history of
Christianity presents problems
for other religious traditions.
For Jews and others, a church as
present, as imposing as Memori
al Church represents exclusion
— the religion that I am not and
don't want to be pressured into
becoming.
But the solution is not to tear
down the church or turn it into a
museum to the quaint vision of
the Stanfords but to build homes
for other religious traditions, to
create a multifaith presence on
this rich and diverse campus, to
engage in authentic conversation
between religious traditions and
to wrestle with the questions of
decency and backbone, spiritual
morality and moral spirituality
which the Stanfords rightly
understood to be crucial to an
excellent education.
As we begin to work toward a
multifaith chaplaincy at Stan
ford, we do so aware of the com
plexity of religious pluralism
and inspired by what our tradi
tions can teach one another. We
invite the Stanford community
to join in this great conversa
tion.

The stu
dent of
mythology
Joseph Camp
bell noted that
in medieval
times, the most
prominent
structure that
could be seen on
the horizon of a

city was the church and steeple.
Upon approaching the city, a
first glance would communicate
the power and influence of the
church. As one approaches the
Stanford University campus on
picturesque Palm Drive, a first
glance communicates the promi
nence and power of Memorial
Church. It is only after coming
very close that the church opens
to the panorama of arches and
architecture which define the
Quad.
What did Jane Stanford
intend by placing a church at the
center of the University? Are
her intentions reflective of the
reality of University life today?
We reap the benefits of the Stan
fords' vision for an academic
community in which excellence
and breadth are hallmarks; do
we also understand or benefit
from their vision of religion and
morality at the heart of Univer
sity life?
The Stanfords hoped that in
this University, a memorial to
their son, a certain kind of spiri
tual morality or moral spiritual
ity would be established. Sen.
Stanford expressed the hope
that graduates would possess "a
lofty sense of man's and
woman's responsibilities on
earth in accordance with the
highest teachings of morality
and religion." Jane Stanford
asserted that "no amount of
learning can take the place of
decency, and no amount of sci
ence can take the place of back
bone."

When Memo
rial Church was
built, Jane
Stanford
inscribed some
of her rationale

_ Yes |

for its presence into the walls of
the sanctuary. "The most
encouraging of all stimulating
influences to a noble life . . . [is]
the power of personal religion.
We need something outside of
and beyond ourselves."
Although decency and back
bone and spiritual morality were
to be present in this University,
there was never a requirement
for chapel attendance. No par
ticular religious denomination
was established by the Stan
fords; however, they took it for
granted that the religious influ
ence to be promoted at the Uni
versity would be Protestant
Christian.
Today their assertion of
Christian form and parlance
may be seen as restrictive and
narrow. But a century ago, their
approach was recognized as lib
eral and inclusive. The freedom
of inquiry of the University was
not to be interfered with by any
authoritarian church body.
Furthermore, the founders
wished to have teachers from
the great faith traditions of the
world speak from the pulpit of
Memorial Church. Rabbi Voor
sanger of Temple Emmanuel in
San Francisco was an important
participant at the church's
opening in 1903.
The assumption about the
centrality of religion which
informed the Stanfords' vision
has been challenged in the con
temporary,-secular world. Reli
gion is presently seen as a pri
vate affair. The prominence of a
church at the center of campus
is not consonant with that world
view. Furthermore, the support
of the University not just for a
church but for four deans for
religious life is a source of con
fusion for those who assume
that the intellectual quest is
devoid of religious, moral and
ethical foundations.
Understanding the private
nature of contemporary reli
gious life and that one nonde
nominational presence cannot
address the contemporary reali
ty of religious pluralism, the
University has invited religious
communities onto campus
through the Stanford Associated
Ministries. Thirty-one different
communities ranging from Jew
ish to Hindu to Islam to Rahai to
Catholic to many denominations
of Protestant Christianity are

present at Stanford
with their particu

lar theological
and ceremonial

earmarks.
Many at
Stanford gath
er for religious
worship and
study as a regu
lar part of their
week. For those
who practice
their religion
here, the Stan
fords' formula
tion of decency,
backbone and
spiritual moral-'

either too
generic or not
