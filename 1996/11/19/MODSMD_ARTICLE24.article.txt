# Should Stanford continue to support Memorial Church?
## 
### 
Yes

No

The commit
ment to
addressing
matters of
faith in the
context of the
University is as
consonant with
learning as
choosing a
major.

Stanford
should get out
of the church
business, and
Mem Chu
should cease to
operate as a
University
managed
religious
institution.
