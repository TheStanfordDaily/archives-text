In my years
I at Stanford, I
have made this
argument
many times to
friends and
acquaintances,
and I have met
with little sup
port, so I know
that I have
some convinc
ing to do.
First, let me
be clear about
6 what I am not
I saying. I am
I not calling for

I to demolish the

point clear.
Second, this is not

r about personal politics;
I have only high regard
for the deans of Memorial

Church. They are fine re

I gious professionals and can
* not be faulted for narrow

& mindedness.
Third, this is not about the
law. Stanford is fully within its
rights as a private institution to
maintain any kind of religious
institution it pleases.

This is about
principle and
about the char
acter of our Uni
versity. The
principle is one

No

with which we are all familiar: In a
multireligious society, no religion
ought to be given special prefer
ence by the governing authorities.
The framers of the American
Constitution understood this prin
ciple more than 200 years ago;
they realized that the government
ought to remain independent and
neutral with respect to religious
denominations.
As Americans, we make sure
that church and state remain sep
arate because religious belief is a
matter of personal conscience, not
something that any government
ought to impose. And we under
stand that freedom of religion
means more than just tolerating
and allowing a variety of religious
communities to congregate; it
means that no religion will be
given special preference by the
authorities.
Yet at Stanford, certain liberal
Christian and Jewish denomina
tions are given just such prefer
ences in the form of University
supported Memorial Church.
Now, let's talk about character.
As a private institution, Stanford
can choose its attitude toward reli
gion. It is completely free to sup
port, propagate and teach any reli
gious beliefs it wants. There are
universities in this country, like
Notre Dame, that do just that.
Hut we all know that Stanford
is not dedicated to any narrow reli
gious ideology - . We all know how
much the administrators love to
tout the multicultural and diverse
nature of our student body; we
hear University President Ger
hard Casper telling us that we all
must make our own choices and
that the University is not here to
tell us what to think "Let the
winds of freedom blow" is our
motto. And, if I may say so, amen!
I>et the winds of freedom blow Let
them blow through our Quad
without running smack into a sec
tarian religious institution.
"But Mem Chu isn't a sectarian
religious institution," the letters
will pour in. Why, don't they even
have a rabbi?
True, Memorial Church is not
sectarian in the way that, say, a
Mormon stake is sectarian, but it
is not and cannot possibly be neu
tral with respect to denomination.
Religious institutions — by
which I mean here institutions that
organize prayer services — are by
nature sectarian. Prayers must be
offered in a certain way and to a

certain concep
tion of the deity;
try as people
might, they can
not come up
with a thorough
ly generic
prayer. And as
religious people
understand, all
attempts to

make non-sectarian prayers only
end up cheapening the whole
enterprise of real prayer which is
intensely personal and intimately
tied to religious traditions.
Because Stanford ought to be a
place that truly respects religious
diversity and because Memorial
Church cannot help but promote
certain denominations over oth
ers, it is plain to see that the two
institutions are incompatible.
Memorial Church must cease to
be operated by the University.
"But what's wrong with the
University operating a church as
long as other religious groups are
free to organize?" Well, the same
thing that would be wrong if the
government decided to spend
money on some churches and not
on others. The message is that
some members of our community
(namely, committed liberal Chris
tians) deserve to have their reli
gious life subsidized while others
(probably the majority of students)
do not. Students who do not sub
scribe to the beliefs of the liberal
Protestant clergy who preach at
Memorial Church are left to fend,
more or less, for themselves while
the tiny percentage of students
who enjoy University Public Wor
ship bask in the opulence of (a
mostly empty) Memorial Church.
"So, what are you saying? You
want the University to build a
Shinto shrine for Shinto students,
a Buddhist temple for Buddhists,
a synagogue for Jews, etc., etc.?"
No, no, no. The University should
most definitely not be in the busi
ness of diwving up funds for reli

gious institu
-9 tions; that's
I the whole
I point.
If University
» administrators

tried to provide religious resources
to every student, they would
inevitably have to start deciding
what constitutes a legitimate reli
gion and what doesn't, and that is
not something that University
bureaucrats ought to have the
power to decide. Could you imag
ine a board of overseers trying to
decide whether pagan students
deserve a place of worship of their
own?
The University cannot and
should not decide which religious
groups deserve money. Students
themselves should make those
decisions. Yet the status quo is one
in which a few Protestant denom
inations along with Reform
Judaism are given preferential
status. If Stanford wanted to be
known as a liberal Judeo-Chris
tian university, if Casper got up
and said. "The religious convic
tions of Memorial Church's deans
represent the core beliefs of this
University," then Memorial
Church's presence would be
understandable and appropriate.
In short, unless the Universi
ty's administrators are willing to
go to bat for the beliefs and prac
tices of liberal Protestantism,
Memorial Church must go. An
institution that truly respected
religious diversity would not
maintain a church, no matter how
open-minded and progressive its
clergy was.
Let's face it — Memorial
Church is an anomaly and an
anachronism. It was consistent
with the character of the Universi
ty back in the era when Stanford
wits almost entirely the preserve of
the West Coast Protestant elite. It
makes no sense today when the
University seeks out the best and
brightest from every religious
group in the country and around
the world.
Keep the building; it can serve
as a museum or a hall to be rented
out for special occasions, but let us
be rid of University support for the
church. It is time to bring the
structure of religious life on cam
pus into line with the values of our
time. Let every- religious group
organize on its own and seek out
venues for prayer in the same way
that other student groups do so.
Let us stop giving preference to a
religious minority on campus, and
let the winds of freedom blow!

ciple more than 200 years ago;
they realized that the government
ought to remain independent and
neutral with respect to religious
denominations.
As Americans, we make sure
that church and state remain sep
arate because religious belief is a
matter of personal conscience, not
something that any government
ought to impose. And we under
stand that freedom of religion
means more than just tolerating
and allowing a variety of religious
communities to congregate; it
means that no religion will be
given special preference by the
authorities.
Yet at Stanford, certain liberal
Christian and Jewish denomina
tions are given just such prefer
ences in the form of University
supported Memorial Church.
Now, let's talk about character.
As a private institution, Stanford
can choose its attitude toward reli
gion. It is completely free to sup
port, propagate and teach any reli
gious beliefs it wants. There are
universities in this country, like
Notre Dame, that do just that.
Hut we all know that Stanford
is not dedicated to any narrow reli
gious ideology - . We all know how
much the administrators love to
tout the multicultural and diverse
nature of our student body; we
hear University President Ger
hard Casper telling us that we all
must make our own choices and
that the University is not here to
tell us what to think "Let the
winds of freedom blow" is our
motto. And, if I may say so, amen!
I>et the winds of freedom blow Let
them blow through our Quad
without running smack into a sec
tarian religious institution.
"But Mem Chu isn't a sectarian
religious institution," the letters
will pour in. Why, don't they even
have a rabbi?
True, Memorial Church is not
sectarian in the way that, say, a
Mormon stake is sectarian, but it
is not and cannot possibly be neu
tral with respect to denomination.
Religious institutions — by
which I mean here institutions that
organize prayer services — are by
nature sectarian. Prayers must be
offered in a certain way and to a

certain concep
tion of the deity;
try as people
might, they can
not come up
with a thorough
ly generic
prayer. And as
religious people
understand, all
attempts to

make non-sectarian prayers only
end up cheapening the whole
enterprise of real prayer which is
intensely personal and intimately
tied to religious traditions.
Because Stanford ought to be a
place that truly respects religious
diversity and because Memorial
Church cannot help but promote
certain denominations over oth
ers, it is plain to see that the two
institutions are incompatible.
Memorial Church must cease to
be operated by the University.
"But what's wrong with the
University operating a church as
long as other religious groups are
free to organize?" Well, the same
thing that would be wrong if the
government decided to spend
money on some churches and not
on others. The message is that
some members of our community
(namely, committed liberal Chris
tians) deserve to have their reli
gious life subsidized while others
(probably the majority of students)
do not. Students who do not sub
scribe to the beliefs of the liberal
Protestant clergy who preach at
Memorial Church are left to fend,
more or less, for themselves while
the tiny percentage of students
who enjoy University Public Wor
ship bask in the opulence of (a
mostly empty) Memorial Church.
"So, what are you saying? You
want the University to build a
Shinto shrine for Shinto students,
a Buddhist temple for Buddhists,
a synagogue for Jews, etc., etc.?"
No, no, no. The University should
most definitely not be in the busi
ness of diwving up funds for reli

gious institu
-9 tions; that's
I the whole
I point.
If University
» administrators

tried to provide religious resources
to every student, they would
inevitably have to start deciding
what constitutes a legitimate reli
gion and what doesn't, and that is
not something that University
bureaucrats ought to have the
power to decide. Could you imag
ine a board of overseers trying to
decide whether pagan students
deserve a place of worship of their
own?
The University cannot and
should not decide which religious
groups deserve money. Students
themselves should make those
decisions. Yet the status quo is one
in which a few Protestant denom
inations along with Reform
Judaism are given preferential
status. If Stanford wanted to be
known as a liberal Judeo-Chris
tian university, if Casper got up
and said. "The religious convic
tions of Memorial Church's deans
represent the core beliefs of this
University," then Memorial
Church's presence would be
understandable and appropriate.
In short, unless the Universi
ty's administrators are willing to
go to bat for the beliefs and prac
tices of liberal Protestantism,
Memorial Church must go. An
institution that truly respected
religious diversity would not
maintain a church, no matter how
open-minded and progressive its
clergy was.
Let's face it — Memorial
Church is an anomaly and an
anachronism. It was consistent
with the character of the Universi
ty back in the era when Stanford
wits almost entirely the preserve of
the West Coast Protestant elite. It
makes no sense today when the
University seeks out the best and
brightest from every religious
group in the country and around
the world.
Keep the building; it can serve
as a museum or a hall to be rented
out for special occasions, but let us
be rid of University support for the
church. It is time to bring the
structure of religious life on cam
pus into line with the values of our
time. Let every- religious group
organize on its own and seek out
venues for prayer in the same way
that other student groups do so.
Let us stop giving preference to a
religious minority on campus, and
let the winds of freedom blow!

with little sup

that I have

First, let me

Second, this is not

for the deans of Memorial

Third, this is not about the
law. Stanford is fully within its
rights as a private institution to
maintain any kind of religious
institution it pleases.

This is about
principle and
about the char

principle is one
