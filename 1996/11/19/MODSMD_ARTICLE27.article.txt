# Men dominate Northern Arizona in a dual meet

The Stanford men's swim team
dominated the Northern Arizona
Lumberjacks in Friday's meet at
deGuerre Pool. Placing first and
second in every individual and
relay event, Stanford swimmers
often found themselves racing each
other for first place.
"It was a fun meet," said senior
Kevin Radvany. "Since NAU
wasn't ever really a factor, my
races felt like really hard workout
swims at times."
Radvany was pushed by
sophomore teammate Matt
O'Mara throughout 1000-yard
freestlye, as the two swam with
in a second of each other for 900
yards before Radvany turned on
an impressive kick to pull away
in the last four laps. O'Mara and
Radvany train long-distance
workouts beside each other every
day, so seeing each other across
the pool as they breathe is noth
ing new to either.
Similar sentiments were shared
by the Stanford team in the rest of
the afternoon's events. In the 20C
freestyle, sophomore Justin Ewers
beat out senior Scott Jones and
sophomore Dodd Wales in a race
that reminded him of practice.
"It was just like workout,"
Ewers said. "We were racing the
same guys in the same pool that we
practice in every afternoon, except

that on Friday we were wearing
caps and smaller suits."
Another exciting race was con
tested in the 400-yard individual
medley between last summer's
national champion, Stanford
junior Tom Wilkens, and his team
mate, senior Matt Thomson.
The two were even after the
butterfly leg of the race, after
which Thomson gained a slight
lead in his specialty, the back
stroke, to lead by 1.5 seconds at the
halfway mark. Wilkens' strong
breaststroke allowed him to catch
his teammate by the time the two
turned at 300 yards for the
freestyle, and they turned almost
simultaneously as they started the
last leg. Thomson then pulled
ahead over the last 100 yards for
yet another Stanford win.
Another impressive perfor
mance was turned in by sophomore
Dan Schultz in winning the 200-
yard backstroke. Schultz was
happy but not complacent with his
swim, feeling that placing more
emphasis on the technical aspects
of his race will lead to faster swims
in the future.
"I felt really good in both the
200 and m my 100 leading off the
relay, but I think I can still improve
by staying under water longer off
my turns," Schultz said.
Other winners from Friday
included junior Sabir Muhammad
in the 50-yard freestyle, sopho
more Matt Pierce in the 200-yard
butterfly and Wilkens in the 200-
yard breaststroke.
Stanford head coach Skip Ken
ney was quick to remind his team
that its next home meet would be
against fierce rivals, the Michigan
Wolverines. That meet comes
early next quarter on Jan. 10 and
is one of the most anticipated
meets of the year.
"We're fired up for Michigan,
and today's meet helped our confi
dence," Ewers said. "Some of our
big guns were sick on Friday, and
our younger guys really stepped
up and swam well."
The last time the two teams
swam against each other in dual
meet competition was two years
ago, when the Cardinal beat
Michigan at Stanford.
