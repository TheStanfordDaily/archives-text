# Sailing hits rough waters
## 
### David McGee Contributing writer 
In perhaps its most important regatta so far
this year, the third-ranked Stanford sailing team
caught a case of bad timing this weekend as it
turned in its most disappointing performance of
the year at the North / South Fall Championships
in Santa Barbara.
The Cardinal finished third out of 19 teams
with 79 points, but Stanford was the overwhelm
ing favorite going in. A surprising UC-Irvine team
took first place with 56 points, while Hawaii cap
tured second at 62 points.
The regatta consisted of four divisions. A and B
divisions sailed in dinghies (double-handed boats),
while C and D divisions sailed in lasers (single
handed boats). Stanford was expected to win the A
and B divisions and compete for the C and D divi
sions, but little turned out as expected.
The bright spot for the Cardinal was in division
A, where junior skipper John Meade and sopho
more crew Jessica Knape placed second behind a
strong performance by the Anteaters' Andy Beeck
man and Carry Lynskley. Neither team finished
worse than second in any of the five races, but
Beeckman took first place four times to Meade's
one.
"John did well," said head coach Steve Bour
dow. "He had a real good regatta."
Meade finished with nine points, while Beeck
man had only six to seal the win.
Times were not as fortunate for division B,
where junior skipper Danny Zimbaldi and senior
crew Megan Ireson finished sixth with 26 points,
well behind Hawaii's Pat Whitmarsh and June
Tamizawa, who took first place with seven points.
Zimbaldi started well on Saturday and was tied

with Whitmarsh at four points at the day's end.
However, Whitmarsh won all three races on Sun
day, while Zimbaldi finished seventh, seventh, and
eighth in the final three races to fall to sixth.
Bourdow attributes Sunday's poor results to
unlucky predictions of the wind.
"Dan and Megan committed themselves to one
side of the course thinking that's where the wind
would be," Bourdow said. "But they missed it.
They had two races where they had bad calls, and
the third race was just a result of frustration, I
think."
In division C, sophomore Tyler Doyle finished
sixth with 25 points. Western Washington's Nel
son Wingard took first place with nine points, win
ning three of the five races. Doyle threatened
Wingard after winning the third race, but finished
fourth and ninth in the final two races while
Wingard won both.
Irvine's Jason Artoff fended off Jeff Nelson of
Hawaii to claim victory in division D, eight points
to nine. Stanford freshman Anika Leerssen fin
ished third with 19 points.
Artoff and Nelson finished in the top three
places in every race, but Artoffs victory in the
final race gave him the win and ended the tight
competition between the two.
"We didn't sail up to potential," Bourdow said.
"We were probably overconfident because of our
depth. We expected everything to fall into place for
us, instead of us making things fall into place. It's
a little of a wakeup call and should motivate us to
work harder."

regatta because of the nature of North / South Fall
Championships. The order of finish in this regatta

reflects the order in which teams
will choose intersectional regat
tas later in the year.
Most regattas have a limited
number of berths for Pacific
Coast teams, and because Stan
ford finished third in this event,
it will choose third for intersec
tional regattas behind the
Anteaters and the Rainbows.
Some intersectionals are bet
ter than others. Stanford would

like to attend regattas that are
the locations of major events
later in the year so the team will
be better prepared for those
regattas. In addition, some
regattas will also provide better
competition.
The Cardinal wanted to place
in the top two at the North /
South Fall Championships
because most prominent regat
tas have two berths for Pacific
Coast teams, but after this
weekend's disappointment it
must now be content with what
ever Irvine and Hawaii leave
behind.
