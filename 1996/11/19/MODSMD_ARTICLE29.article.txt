# Ducks slip on the ice
## 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
A night of frustration for the
Stanford ice hockey team was
kept at bay Friday night in a 3-2
victory over the Oregon Ducks.
The Cardinal ended the first
period up by one score but still
frustrated mightily. Its only
point had come shorthanded on
an Oregon power play.
Because a Stanford player
was out on a penalty, the Ducks
sported one more player on the
ice than did the Card. Usually
this would translate into a
defensive position for Stanford,
with the depleted corps just try
ing to push the puck as far away
from the goal until Oregon's
power play ticked off the clock.
However, Stanford senior
Chuck Glew was able to grab the
puck on a luckv bounce, turn
around, skate down the ice
toward Oregon's goal, and shove
it in. The Cardinal led 1-0.
But by the time the period was
over, there was no cheering on
the Stanford bench.
"Scoring when we were short
handed was both good and bad,"
said freshman Phil Enan. "It was
good because we scored when we
were down, when we weren't
supposed to. It was bad. however,
because we couldn't score in even
play, when things were supposed
to be clicking."

In the second period, Stanford
repeated the script with another
shorthanded goal.
This time, about midway
through the period, Oregon was
far back in its own territory. The
Ducks were bringing the puck
out toward the red line in their
trek for Stanford's goal.
Senior Evan Asano, trying to
stop Oregon's forward progress,
was forechecked by the last Duck
in the march. As the player
passed across the ice, the puck
glanced off of Asano's shin
toward the goal. Asano dove for
the puck and was able to place it
into the net, putting the Cardinal
up 2-1.
Asano, who had two goals on
the evening, had mixed feelings
about the score.
"Whenever a team scores with
a man down, it's exciting,"
Asano said. "With a man down,
you expect that team to be on the
defensive. A goal while short
handed gets a team psyched."
But this time, Asano agreed,
the score wasn't a boon.
"Not being able to score on a
normal set was really frustrat
ing," he said. "It didn't seem like
we were accomplishing anything.
We seemed dead."
In the third period, however,
the team was able to put the
game back together. Leading 2-1,
