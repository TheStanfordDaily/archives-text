# Changes in progress for student housing
## 
### Dana Hangai Staff writer 
With the opening of two new graduate
student dormitories and the possible desig
nation of more all-freshman dormitories,
students returning to Stanford next year
will find a greatly changed campus dorm
life.
Due to a demand for more graduate hous
ing, the Graduate School of Business-spon
sored Schwab Residential Center will open
in June 1997, while a presently unnamed
graduate dormitory in Governor's Corner
will be available for students by fall 1997.
Furthermore, in an effort to meet incom
ing freshman housing requests, University
President Gerhard Casper announced in
October the creation of the Task Force on
Residential Programs and Student Housing
for Undergraduates. It will investigate the
feasibility of more all-freshman dormito
ries, among other goals.
Students at all levels will be affected by
these changes. With the creation of more
housing, both sides of campus will have
more students contending for parking spots
and travel routes. Additionally, if more
freshman dorms are created, some four
class dorms may turn into upperclass
dorms.
The freshman experience
While filling out the application for hous
ing preferences, incoming freshmen can de
cide between an all-freshman dormitorv or a

four-class dormitory. How
ever, according to Casper,
many more students want
an all-freshman dormitory
than there are spaces avail
able. Casper feels that a
real need exists to accom
modate those students.
Casper also argued that
students who live in all
freshman dormitories tend

to have a more exciting first-year experience
than freshmen who are placed into four
class dormitories.
"As I talk with students and alumni, I
find many more enthusiastic about their all -
frosh experience than their first year in an
all-four-class dorm," Casper said. This en
thusiasm results in a more involved experi
ence with their class for students and helps
them "relate more intensely with the Uni
versity."
For junior Jimmy Halow, a resident as
sistant at Larkin, living in an all-freshman
dormitory is "100 times better" than living
in a four-class dormitory.
"It's not as cliquish," Halow said. "In a
four-class dorm, upperclassmen come in
with their Draw groups, and they want to
hang around with their friends."
Halow added that it is harder for fresh
men to find friends in a four-clas.- dormito
ry; in an all-freshman dormitory, every one
is new to Stanford and nervous about the


Casper
experience.
Junior Akil Hines, who lived in
all-freshman Junipero her first
year, agreed that it was easier to
meet new people who shared the
same classes and interests.
"One thing you knew when you
lived in an all-frosh dorm was that
half of you were taking Math 19
and the other half Math 41 so you
could always find someone to study
with," Hines said. "When you were
at the dining table, there was al
ways someone to sit with."
However, some argue there are
advantages to living in four-class
dormitories. Freshman Gilbert
Lopez requested a four-class dor
mitory because he "liked the idea
of having people around who were
used to things and could help with
the college stuff.
"I know that's why they assign
us advisers and residence staff,"
Lopez continued, "but it's differ
ent when you actually talk to up
perclassmen about their real expe

riences. It's a little bit more di
verse."
Linguistics Prof. John Rick
ford, a resident fellow at Kimball
Hall, also worried that creating
more freshman dormitories would
steal some vitality from four-class
dormitories.
"A lot of people talk about the
energy you get from freshmen,"
Rickford said. "They tend to have a
lot of ideas. They tend to want to do
things. They tend to come to things
and to suggest ideas. If you take
300 or 400 of them and you siphon
them off to frosh dorms, you're
stealing away from the other
dorms."
In order to properly weigh the
different perspectives from all
points of view, three University
staff members, three faculty mem
bers and three students — at least
one of whom will be a class presi
dent — will make up the task force.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldi'var will
chair the committee.
Casper hopes to have the report
completed by the end of this school
year. Implementation of the report
will depend on the nature of the

recommendations. Student fo
rums and meetings with faculty
will be scheduled if necessary, ac
cording to Casper.
Graduate housing
On the other end of the spec
trum, housing changes are in store
for graduate students as well. By
the next academic year, more grad
uate students will be able to avoid
searching for housing in surround
ing towns and instead live in two
additional dorms: the Schwab Res
idential Center, located on Serra
Street behind Manzanita Park,
and a second graduate dormitory
built on the former Governor's
Corner parking lot.
In addition to its regular use
during the academic year, the
Schwab Center will also house the
executive education summer pro
gram. Formerly, participants in
the six-week program lived in La
gunita Court.
The Schwab Center will house
280 people. Each unit will consist
of two studio apartments with no
shared living space, a shared
kitchen and private baths, accord
ing to Keith Guy, director of Hous

ing and Dining Services.
The complex will also house a li
brary, a weight room and an exer
cise room. During the summer, a
central dining facility will provide
full meal service for participants in
the executive program.
"It's going to be quite a nice fa
cility, in terms of the space avail
able for things outside of the apart
ment," Guy said. In addition, a
central courtyard, similar to the
design of Lagunita Court, was in
corporated into the plans.
During the school year, single
graduate students working toward
MBA degrees will have priority
over other students. In addition,
30 of the units will be reserved for
participants in year-round execu
tive education programs.
The Governor's Corner dormi
tory is intended for single graduate
students. It will consist of one-bed
room apartments, with small
shared living space, a kitchen and a
bathroom. There are 112 apart
ments in the complex, housing a
total of 224 people, and a central
commons building, which will
house laundry facilities, the com
puter clustcr, mail boxes, gather
ing spaces and lounges.
The inconveniences of change
While both housing projects
will result in improvements for
graduate students in the future,
the two projects are providing in
conveniences for many in the pre
sent.
Particular to the Governor's
Corner construction project is the
problem of tiger salamander mi
gration paths, which pass through
the dormitory area. In order to
breed, the salamanders move to
Lake Lagunita.
According to Catherine Palter,
an environmental planner in the
Planning Office, tiger salamanders
are not currently protected under
the endangered species act, but
their status and the California en
vironmental quality act "made us
look at the impacts" of buildingthe
dormitory.
Casper said the dormitories
should not cause problems for the
salamanders.
"We have taken many, many
steps at Governor's Corner to as
sure the safety of the salamander,"
Casper said. "We worked hard to
mitigate this problem."
Some of the steps taken include
blocking storm drains, testing al
ternate breeding ponds and re
moving railroad tracks that im

pede the salamanders' migration.
All steps have been taken to
comply with Santa Clara County's
initial planning board approval of
the project, Palter said, as well as
many of the recommendations
made in the board's environmental
planning report. In addition, by
the completion of the project, a
draft agreement concerning the
safety of the salamander must be
formulated.
This draft agreement is being
done by an outside consultant with
consultation with the Center for
Conservation Biology, the Legal
Office and many operational de
partments at Stanford.
"There has been misunder
standing about the environmental
work and the schedule of the occu
pancy of the housing," Palter said.
"We are abiding by the conditions
of the housing."
Other problems caused by the
housing projects are the noise of
construction and lack of available
parking. Both projects took up
parking lots in their respective
areas.
Sophomore Charles Hendricks,
a resident computer coordinator at
Sterling Quad, said many of the
complaints the residence staff has
received concern the lack of park
ing. The parking problem is partic
ularly severe in Governor's Cor
ner, which lost a 350-space lot ad
jacent to the construction.
According to Facilities Opera
tions Administrative Services
Manager Jeffrey Tumlin, Trans
portation Programs is working on
building more parking next to the
dormitories.
In a statement issued to west
campus residents, Tumlin said,
"We do know that parking will cer
tainly be less convenient than be
fore. Unfortunately, parking fees
that are collected barely cover the
operating costs of a parking space
and do not even begin to cover the
costs of building additional park
ing; therefore, we cannot create
more parking closer to your front
doors."
However, Tumlin said, the Uni
versity is committed to having
parking available for all students
within five to 10 minutes of their
dorms. However, many students
have expressed concern that such a
long walk is inconvenient and po
tentially unsafe.
Junior Amori Mikami, an RA at
Lantana, also said many of her res
idents' complaints dealt with "the
construction noise starting earlv

because construction workers
don't realize they're not on the
same schedule as students."
However, Facilities Project
Management Director Mark Jones
said the contractors are taking the
students' concerns seriously.
Jones said weekly updates and reg
ular meetings are conducted, and
"as a result, and to minimize im
pacts, there are ongoing limits on
construction activity, such as re
stricted work hours and no truck
deliveries before 10 a.m.
"For Dead Week and finals
week," Jones continued, "work
will be limited so there will be no
noisy activity permitted."
Sophomore Joe Siedel, a resi
dent of the Suites, agreed that con
struction workers were trying to
adjust their schedules to fit stu
dents' sleeping and studying pat
terns.
"At the beginning of the year I
was worried," Siedel said, "but
they've actually been pretty good
by working only in the day and
keeping the noise level down."
Future changes
With the construction of addi
tional graduate dorms and the task
force on freshman housing, hous
ing on campus is set to experience a
major change. Furthermore, the
task force will explore changing
the housing Draw to favor seniors
and give them preferential selec
tion.
Until the task force gives its rec
ommendations, the date of imple
mentation for the changes is un
clear. However, Casper said he
wants the changes to be made as
soon as possible.
As for the future relationship
between graduate and undergrad
uate students, what will come out
of living in close proximity to one
another is still unclear. The
Schwab Center is being built di
rectly behind and next to several of
Stanford's noisiest dorms: Bran
ner, Tovon and Kimball.
The outcome "remains to be
seen," Guy said. "Graduate stu
dents and undergraduate stu
dents have different lifestyles, but
hopefully there won't be any prob
lems and instead there will be an
interchange between the two
groups."
Housing and Dining Services
has "discussed this and we don't
anticipate any problems," Guy
continued. "If any problems occur,
we'll deal with them as they
come."

sure the safety of the salamander,"
Casper said. "We worked hard to
mitigate this problem."
Some of the steps taken include
blocking storm drains, testing al
ternate breeding ponds and re
moving railroad tracks that im

pede the salamanders' migration.
All steps have been taken to
comply with Santa Clara County's
initial planning board approval of
the project, Palter said, as well as
many of the recommendations
made in the board's environmental
planning report. In addition, by
the completion of the project, a
draft agreement concerning the
safety of the salamander must be
formulated.
This draft agreement is being
done by an outside consultant with
consultation with the Center for
Conservation Biology, the Legal
Office and many operational de
partments at Stanford.
"There has been misunder
standing about the environmental
work and the schedule of the occu
pancy of the housing," Palter said.
"We are abiding by the conditions
of the housing."
Other problems caused by the
housing projects are the noise of
construction and lack of available
parking. Both projects took up
parking lots in their respective
areas.
Sophomore Charles Hendricks,
a resident computer coordinator at
Sterling Quad, said many of the
complaints the residence staff has
received concern the lack of park
ing. The parking problem is partic
ularly severe in Governor's Cor
ner, which lost a 350-space lot ad
jacent to the construction.
According to Facilities Opera
tions Administrative Services
Manager Jeffrey Tumlin, Trans
portation Programs is working on
building more parking next to the
dormitories.
In a statement issued to west
campus residents, Tumlin said,
"We do know that parking will cer
tainly be less convenient than be
fore. Unfortunately, parking fees
that are collected barely cover the
operating costs of a parking space
and do not even begin to cover the
costs of building additional park
ing; therefore, we cannot create
more parking closer to your front
doors."
However, Tumlin said, the Uni
versity is committed to having
parking available for all students
within five to 10 minutes of their
dorms. However, many students
have expressed concern that such a
long walk is inconvenient and po
tentially unsafe.
Junior Amori Mikami, an RA at
Lantana, also said many of her res
idents' complaints dealt with "the
construction noise starting earlv

because construction workers
don't realize they're not on the
same schedule as students."
However, Facilities Project
Management Director Mark Jones
said the contractors are taking the
students' concerns seriously.
Jones said weekly updates and reg
ular meetings are conducted, and
"as a result, and to minimize im
pacts, there are ongoing limits on
construction activity, such as re
stricted work hours and no truck
deliveries before 10 a.m.
"For Dead Week and finals
week," Jones continued, "work
will be limited so there will be no
noisy activity permitted."
Sophomore Joe Siedel, a resi
dent of the Suites, agreed that con
struction workers were trying to
adjust their schedules to fit stu
dents' sleeping and studying pat
terns.
"At the beginning of the year I
was worried," Siedel said, "but
they've actually been pretty good
by working only in the day and
keeping the noise level down."
Future changes
With the construction of addi
tional graduate dorms and the task
force on freshman housing, hous
ing on campus is set to experience a
major change. Furthermore, the
task force will explore changing
the housing Draw to favor seniors
and give them preferential selec
tion.
Until the task force gives its rec
ommendations, the date of imple
mentation for the changes is un
clear. However, Casper said he
wants the changes to be made as
soon as possible.
As for the future relationship
between graduate and undergrad
uate students, what will come out
of living in close proximity to one
another is still unclear. The
Schwab Center is being built di
rectly behind and next to several of
Stanford's noisiest dorms: Bran
ner, Tovon and Kimball.
The outcome "remains to be
seen," Guy said. "Graduate stu
dents and undergraduate stu
dents have different lifestyles, but
hopefully there won't be any prob
lems and instead there will be an
interchange between the two
groups."
Housing and Dining Services
has "discussed this and we don't

continued. "If any problems occur,
we'll deal with them as they
come."


Alex Ho — Daily
New graduate student housing has sprouted in the Governor's Corner area.
With the opening of two new graduate
student dormitories and the possible desig
nation of more all-freshman dormitories,
students returning to Stanford next year
will find a greatly changed campus dorm
life.
Due to a demand for more graduate hous
ing, the Graduate School of Business-spon
sored Schwab Residential Center will open
in June 1997, while a presently unnamed
graduate dormitory in Governor's Corner
will be available for students by fall 1997.
Furthermore, in an effort to meet incom
ing freshman housing requests, University
President Gerhard Casper announced in
October the creation of the Task Force on
Residential Programs and Student Housing
for Undergraduates. It will investigate the
feasibility of more all-freshman dormito
ries, among other goals.
Students at all levels will be affected by
these changes. With the creation of more
housing, both sides of campus will have
more students contending for parking spots
and travel routes. Additionally, if more
freshman dorms are created, some four
class dorms may turn into upperclass
dorms.
The freshman experience
While filling out the application for hous
ing preferences, incoming freshmen can de
cide between an all-freshman dormitorv or a

four-class dormitory. How
ever, according to Casper,
many more students want
an all-freshman dormitory
than there are spaces avail
able. Casper feels that a
real need exists to accom
modate those students.
Casper also argued that
students who live in all
freshman dormitories tend

to have a more exciting first-year experience
than freshmen who are placed into four
class dormitories.
"As I talk with students and alumni, I
find many more enthusiastic about their all -
frosh experience than their first year in an
all-four-class dorm," Casper said. This en
thusiasm results in a more involved experi
ence with their class for students and helps
them "relate more intensely with the Uni
versity."
For junior Jimmy Halow, a resident as
sistant at Larkin, living in an all-freshman
dormitory is "100 times better" than living
in a four-class dormitory.
"It's not as cliquish," Halow said. "In a
four-class dorm, upperclassmen come in
with their Draw groups, and they want to
hang around with their friends."
Halow added that it is harder for fresh
men to find friends in a four-clas.- dormito
ry; in an all-freshman dormitory, every one
is new to Stanford and nervous about the


Casper
experience.
Junior Akil Hines, who lived in
all-freshman Junipero her first
year, agreed that it was easier to
meet new people who shared the
same classes and interests.
"One thing you knew when you
lived in an all-frosh dorm was that
half of you were taking Math 19
and the other half Math 41 so you
could always find someone to study
with," Hines said. "When you were
at the dining table, there was al
ways someone to sit with."
However, some argue there are
advantages to living in four-class
dormitories. Freshman Gilbert
Lopez requested a four-class dor
mitory because he "liked the idea
of having people around who were
used to things and could help with
the college stuff.
"I know that's why they assign
us advisers and residence staff,"
Lopez continued, "but it's differ
ent when you actually talk to up
perclassmen about their real expe

riences. It's a little bit more di
verse."
Linguistics Prof. John Rick
ford, a resident fellow at Kimball
Hall, also worried that creating
more freshman dormitories would
steal some vitality from four-class
dormitories.
"A lot of people talk about the
energy you get from freshmen,"
Rickford said. "They tend to have a
lot of ideas. They tend to want to do
things. They tend to come to things
and to suggest ideas. If you take
300 or 400 of them and you siphon
them off to frosh dorms, you're
stealing away from the other
dorms."
In order to properly weigh the
different perspectives from all
points of view, three University
staff members, three faculty mem
bers and three students — at least
one of whom will be a class presi
dent — will make up the task force.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldi'var will
chair the committee.
Casper hopes to have the report
completed by the end of this school
year. Implementation of the report
will depend on the nature of the

recommendations. Student fo
rums and meetings with faculty
will be scheduled if necessary, ac
cording to Casper.
Graduate housing
On the other end of the spec
trum, housing changes are in store
for graduate students as well. By
the next academic year, more grad
uate students will be able to avoid
searching for housing in surround
ing towns and instead live in two
additional dorms: the Schwab Res
idential Center, located on Serra
Street behind Manzanita Park,
and a second graduate dormitory
built on the former Governor's
Corner parking lot.
In addition to its regular use
during the academic year, the
Schwab Center will also house the
executive education summer pro
gram. Formerly, participants in
the six-week program lived in La
gunita Court.
The Schwab Center will house
280 people. Each unit will consist
of two studio apartments with no
shared living space, a shared
kitchen and private baths, accord
ing to Keith Guy, director of Hous

ing and Dining Services.
The complex will also house a li
brary, a weight room and an exer
cise room. During the summer, a
central dining facility will provide
full meal service for participants in
the executive program.
"It's going to be quite a nice fa
cility, in terms of the space avail
able for things outside of the apart
ment," Guy said. In addition, a
central courtyard, similar to the
design of Lagunita Court, was in
corporated into the plans.
During the school year, single
graduate students working toward
MBA degrees will have priority
over other students. In addition,
30 of the units will be reserved for
participants in year-round execu
tive education programs.
The Governor's Corner dormi
tory is intended for single graduate
students. It will consist of one-bed
room apartments, with small
shared living space, a kitchen and a
bathroom. There are 112 apart
ments in the complex, housing a
total of 224 people, and a central
commons building, which will
house laundry facilities, the com
puter clustcr, mail boxes, gather
ing spaces and lounges.
The inconveniences of change
While both housing projects
will result in improvements for
graduate students in the future,
the two projects are providing in
conveniences for many in the pre
sent.
Particular to the Governor's
Corner construction project is the
problem of tiger salamander mi
gration paths, which pass through
the dormitory area. In order to
breed, the salamanders move to
Lake Lagunita.
According to Catherine Palter,
an environmental planner in the
Planning Office, tiger salamanders
are not currently protected under
the endangered species act, but
their status and the California en
vironmental quality act "made us
look at the impacts" of buildingthe
dormitory.
Casper said the dormitories
should not cause problems for the
salamanders.
"We have taken many, many
steps at Governor's Corner to as
sure the safety of the salamander,"
Casper said. "We worked hard to
mitigate this problem."
Some of the steps taken include
blocking storm drains, testing al
ternate breeding ponds and re
moving railroad tracks that im

pede the salamanders' migration.
All steps have been taken to
comply with Santa Clara County's
initial planning board approval of
the project, Palter said, as well as
many of the recommendations
made in the board's environmental
planning report. In addition, by
the completion of the project, a
draft agreement concerning the
safety of the salamander must be
formulated.
This draft agreement is being
done by an outside consultant with
consultation with the Center for
Conservation Biology, the Legal

with," Hines said. "When you were
at the dining table, there was al
ways someone to sit with."
However, some argue there are
advantages to living in four-class
dormitories. Freshman Gilbert
Lopez requested a four-class dor
mitory because he "liked the idea
of having people around who were
used to things and could help with
the college stuff.
"I know that's why they assign
us advisers and residence staff,"
Lopez continued, "but it's differ
ent when you actually talk to up
perclassmen about their real expe

riences. It's a little bit more di
verse."
Linguistics Prof. John Rick
ford, a resident fellow at Kimball
Hall, also worried that creating
more freshman dormitories would
steal some vitality from four-class
dormitories.
"A lot of people talk about the
energy you get from freshmen,"
Rickford said. "They tend to have a
lot of ideas. They tend to want to do
things. They tend to come to things
and to suggest ideas. If you take
300 or 400 of them and you siphon
them off to frosh dorms, you're
stealing away from the other
dorms."
In order to properly weigh the
different perspectives from all
points of view, three University
staff members, three faculty mem
bers and three students — at least
one of whom will be a class presi
dent — will make up the task force.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldi'var will
chair the committee.
Casper hopes to have the report
completed by the end of this school
year. Implementation of the report
will depend on the nature of the

recommendations. Student fo
rums and meetings with faculty
will be scheduled if necessary, ac
cording to Casper.
Graduate housing
On the other end of the spec
trum, housing changes are in store
for graduate students as well. By
the next academic year, more grad
uate students will be able to avoid
searching for housing in surround
ing towns and instead live in two
additional dorms: the Schwab Res
idential Center, located on Serra
Street behind Manzanita Park,
and a second graduate dormitory
built on the former Governor's
Corner parking lot.
In addition to its regular use
during the academic year, the
Schwab Center will also house the
executive education summer pro
gram. Formerly, participants in
the six-week program lived in La
gunita Court.
The Schwab Center will house
280 people. Each unit will consist
of two studio apartments with no
shared living space, a shared
kitchen and private baths, accord
ing to Keith Guy, director of Hous

ing and Dining Services.
The complex will also house a li
brary, a weight room and an exer
cise room. During the summer, a
central dining facility will provide
full meal service for participants in
the executive program.
"It's going to be quite a nice fa
cility, in terms of the space avail
able for things outside of the apart
ment," Guy said. In addition, a
central courtyard, similar to the
design of Lagunita Court, was in
corporated into the plans.
During the school year, single
graduate students working toward
MBA degrees will have priority
over other students. In addition,
30 of the units will be reserved for
participants in year-round execu
tive education programs.
The Governor's Corner dormi
tory is intended for single graduate
students. It will consist of one-bed
room apartments, with small
shared living space, a kitchen and a
bathroom. There are 112 apart
ments in the complex, housing a
total of 224 people, and a central
commons building, which will
house laundry facilities, the com
puter clustcr, mail boxes, gather
ing spaces and lounges.
The inconveniences of change
While both housing projects
will result in improvements for
graduate students in the future,
the two projects are providing in
conveniences for many in the pre
sent.
Particular to the Governor's
Corner construction project is the
problem of tiger salamander mi
gration paths, which pass through
the dormitory area. In order to
breed, the salamanders move to
Lake Lagunita.
According to Catherine Palter,
an environmental planner in the
Planning Office, tiger salamanders
are not currently protected under
the endangered species act, but
their status and the California en
vironmental quality act "made us
look at the impacts" of buildingthe
dormitory.
Casper said the dormitories
should not cause problems for the
salamanders.
"We have taken many, many
steps at Governor's Corner to as
sure the safety of the salamander,"
Casper said. "We worked hard to
mitigate this problem."
Some of the steps taken include
blocking storm drains, testing al
ternate breeding ponds and re
moving railroad tracks that im

pede the salamanders' migration.
All steps have been taken to
comply with Santa Clara County's
initial planning board approval of
the project, Palter said, as well as
many of the recommendations
made in the board's environmental
planning report. In addition, by
the completion of the project, a
draft agreement concerning the
safety of the salamander must be
formulated.
This draft agreement is being
done by an outside consultant with
consultation with the Center for
Conservation Biology, the Legal
Office and many operational de
partments at Stanford.
"There has been misunder
standing about the environmental
work and the schedule of the occu
pancy of the housing," Palter said.
"We are abiding by the conditions
of the housing."
Other problems caused by the
housing projects are the noise of
construction and lack of available
parking. Both projects took up
parking lots in their respective
areas.
Sophomore Charles Hendricks,
a resident computer coordinator at
Sterling Quad, said many of the
complaints the residence staff has
received concern the lack of park
ing. The parking problem is partic
ularly severe in Governor's Cor
ner, which lost a 350-space lot ad
jacent to the construction.
According to Facilities Opera
tions Administrative Services
Manager Jeffrey Tumlin, Trans
portation Programs is working on
building more parking next to the
dormitories.
In a statement issued to west
campus residents, Tumlin said,
"We do know that parking will cer
tainly be less convenient than be
fore. Unfortunately, parking fees
that are collected barely cover the
operating costs of a parking space
and do not even begin to cover the
costs of building additional park
ing; therefore, we cannot create
more parking closer to your front
doors."
However, Tumlin said, the Uni
versity is committed to having
parking available for all students
within five to 10 minutes of their
dorms. However, many students
have expressed concern that such a
long walk is inconvenient and po
tentially unsafe.
Junior Amori Mikami, an RA at
Lantana, also said many of her res
idents' complaints dealt with "the
construction noise starting earlv

because construction workers
don't realize they're not on the
same schedule as students."
However, Facilities Project
Management Director Mark Jones
said the contractors are taking the
students' concerns seriously.
Jones said weekly updates and reg
ular meetings are conducted, and
"as a result, and to minimize im
pacts, there are ongoing limits on
construction activity, such as re
stricted work hours and no truck
deliveries before 10 a.m.
"For Dead Week and finals
week," Jones continued, "work
will be limited so there will be no
noisy activity permitted."
Sophomore Joe Siedel, a resi
dent of the Suites, agreed that con
struction workers were trying to
adjust their schedules to fit stu
dents' sleeping and studying pat
terns.
"At the beginning of the year I
was worried," Siedel said, "but
they've actually been pretty good
by working only in the day and
keeping the noise level down."
Future changes
With the construction of addi
tional graduate dorms and the task
force on freshman housing, hous
ing on campus is set to experience a
major change. Furthermore, the
task force will explore changing
the housing Draw to favor seniors
and give them preferential selec
tion.
Until the task force gives its rec
ommendations, the date of imple
mentation for the changes is un
clear. However, Casper said he
wants the changes to be made as
soon as possible.
As for the future relationship
between graduate and undergrad
uate students, what will come out
of living in close proximity to one
another is still unclear. The
Schwab Center is being built di
rectly behind and next to several of
Stanford's noisiest dorms: Bran
ner, Tovon and Kimball.
The outcome "remains to be
seen," Guy said. "Graduate stu
dents and undergraduate stu
dents have different lifestyles, but
hopefully there won't be any prob
lems and instead there will be an
interchange between the two
groups."
Housing and Dining Services
has "discussed this and we don't
anticipate any problems," Guy
continued. "If any problems occur,
we'll deal with them as they
come."
