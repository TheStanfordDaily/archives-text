# Changes in progress for student housing

### Dana Hangai Staff writer 
With the opening of two new graduate
student dormitories and the possible desig
nation of more all-freshman dormitories,
students returning to Stanford next year
will find a greatly changed campus dorm
life.
Due to a demand for more graduate hous
ing, the Graduate School of Business-spon
sored Schwab Residential Center will open
in June 1997, while a presently unnamed
graduate dormitory in Governor's Corner
will be available for students by fall 1997.
Furthermore, in an effort to meet incom
ing freshman housing requests, University
President Gerhard Casper announced in
October the creation of the Task Force on
Residential Programs and Student Housing
for Undergraduates. It will investigate the
feasibility of more all-freshman dormito
ries, among other goals.
Students at all levels will be affected by
these changes. With the creation of more
housing, both sides of campus will have
more students contending for parking spots
and travel routes. Additionally, if more
freshman dorms are created, some four
class dorms may turn into upperclass
dorms.
The freshman experience
While filling out the application for hous
ing preferences, incoming freshmen can de
cide between an all-freshman dormitorv or a

four-class dormitory. How
ever, according to Casper,
many more students want
an all-freshman dormitory
than there are spaces avail
able. Casper feels that a
real need exists to accom
modate those students.
Casper also argued that
students who live in all
freshman dormitories tend

to have a more exciting first-year experience
than freshmen who are placed into four
class dormitories.
"As I talk with students and alumni, I
find many more enthusiastic about their all -
frosh experience than their first year in an
all-four-class dorm," Casper said. This en
thusiasm results in a more involved experi
ence with their class for students and helps
them "relate more intensely with the Uni
versity."
For junior Jimmy Halow, a resident as
sistant at Larkin, living in an all-freshman
dormitory is "100 times better" than living
in a four-class dormitory.
"It's not as cliquish," Halow said. "In a
four-class dorm, upperclassmen come in
with their Draw groups, and they want to
hang around with their friends."
Halow added that it is harder for fresh
men to find friends in a four-clas.- dormito
ry; in an all-freshman dormitory, every one
is new to Stanford and nervous about the
