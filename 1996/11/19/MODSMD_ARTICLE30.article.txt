# Wrestling: has Open success

### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Men's wrestling made a strong showing at the
Southern Oregon Open last weekend, getting seven
place-winners including four third-place finishers.
Nearly the entire Cardinal team, including redshirt
freshmen, competed in the tournament since it was
open and not NCAA-sanctioned.
As a team, the Cardinal began to show early signs
of asserting itself as a legitimate wrestling power.
"I thought we looked great out there," said Stan
ford coach Chris Horpel. "We won a lot of the close
matches. While I am normally happy with winning
50 percent of the tough matches, this weekend we
were able to pull out about three-quarters of the
really close ones."
Though the team does not seem to have any
emerging superstars, it is starting to display the
character and desire of a quality program.
"We're very solid at all 10 weights," Horpel said.
"None look like All-Americans yet, but we're still
kind of young and inexperienced and as of yet pret
ty much unproven."
Junior Scott Chapman was one of three Cardinal
wrestlers to finish third in his weight division.
