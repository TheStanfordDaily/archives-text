## 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Men's wrestling made a strong showing at the
Southern Oregon Open last weekend, getting seven
place-winners including four third-place finishers.
Nearly the entire Cardinal team, including redshirt
freshmen, competed in the tournament since it was
open and not NCAA-sanctioned.
As a team, the Cardinal began to show early signs
of asserting itself as a legitimate wrestling power.
"I thought we looked great out there," said Stan
ford coach Chris Horpel. "We won a lot of the close
matches. While I am normally happy with winning
50 percent of the tough matches, this weekend we
were able to pull out about three-quarters of the
really close ones."
Though the team does not seem to have any
emerging superstars, it is starting to display the
character and desire of a quality program.
"We're very solid at all 10 weights," Horpel said.
"None look like All-Americans yet, but we're still
kind of young and inexperienced and as of yet pret
ty much unproven."
Junior Scott Chapman was one of three Cardinal
wrestlers to finish third in his weight division.
which is 177 pounds. After losing
a close match to Oregon's Doug
Lee in the third round of the regu
lar draw, Chapman cruised
through the consolation bracket,
highlighted by a dramatic finish
against a familiar foe, Oregon
State's Clint Wilson.
The match between the old
rivals was close throughout, but as
time expired, Chapman was able
to get the takedown, which would
have given him the win. Wilson,
however, in frustration and disbe
lief at Chapman's amazing come
back, punched Chapman, giving
the Stanford senior the disqualifi
cation victory and the chance to
earn a third-place finish. Despite
having only 10 minutes of rest
between matches, Chapman was
able to beat Lutheran Pacific's
Matt Bliss 6-3 to earn third-place.

Senior Brian Vaniman was also
a third-place finisher in the 190-
pound weight class, going 4-1
overall in the tourney. After whip
ping his first two opponents by a
collective score of 19-0, Vaniman
lost a close match to graduated
entry Dan Potts, which put him in
the consolation draw. There he
advanced to the finals and won a
close and hard-fought match
against San Francisco State's Lee
Lofton 4-0.
At 167 pounds, junior Jeff
Grant managed a third-place fin
ish as well. After making it to the
semifinals in his weight division,
Grant lost a close match 5-2 to
Oregon's Kevin Keeney. Grant
came back in the consolation draw
to make it to the finals, where he
edged out Lassen College's
Markese Nelson 2-0.
The other third-place finisher
for the Cardinal was redshirt
freshman Jason Talbot at 126
pounds. The true freshman went
6-1 in the tournament to earn

third in his weight class, eking out
a close 6-5 victory in the finals of
the consolation draw against
Lassen College's Kelly Revells.
"I was very impressed with
Jason's performance," Horpel
said. "He was in a tough weight
and got a third-place finish as a
redshirt. That shows a lot of heart
and character on his part."
Other place-winners receiving
fourth place in their divisions for
the Cardinal were sophomore
Warren McPherson at 142
pounds, sophomore B.J. Sanchez
at 150 pounds and senior Ryan
Barnes at 158.
Though the competition only
awarded places to individuals,
Horpel estimates that the Cardi
nal would have come in second or
third overall with Oregon State as
the clear winner if team tallies had
been taken.
"I am definitely pleased with
the team's performance," Horpel
said. "They showed a lot of desire
and character."
