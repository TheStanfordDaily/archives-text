# Rugby team is off with a win
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The 30-25 victory over Sacramento State
on Saturday was more than a winning game
for the Stanford men's rugby team.
The game was the first preseason contest
for the squad, which placed third in the Final
Four last year and now faces the task of fill
ing the vacant spots left by last year's nine
senior starters. Those spots will be filled by
the 20 or so rookies that have been practic
ing with the team since the start of training
last month.
While some rookies who traveled up to
Sacramento saw playing time with the Cardi
nal A-side team, others fought hard in the B
side match which was also held to allow all
players on both teams to take part in the tra
ditional match.
Captain Joe Clayton said the trip was well
worthwhile â€” it exposed the rookies to the
game of rugby, revealed the squad's weak
nesses and strengths and allowed the new
team to grow closer.
Despite some awkward playing due to the
infancy of the squad, the Stanford team slid
off to a smooth start with a try on a driving
maul in the beginning of the first half.
Senior rookie Doug McDonald carried the
ball across the goal line as the other seven
forwards bound and pushed together with
him to put the Card in the lead.
Although Sacramento State came back
with a try and a clean penalty kick which
gave the Hornets an 8-7 lead, junior fullback
and team president Dave Warter pulled the
young team together and added a try to
replace the Card in the lead just
before halftime.
In the second half of the
match, the Card experienced
some difficulty and frustration
as Sacramento lingered closely
behind despite Stanford's
efforts.
Coach Franck Boivert said
the squad "kept on making silly
mistakes that are expected from
an inexperienced team," keeping
the lower-echelon Hornets in the
game.
However junior rookie Don
Donester and sophomore wing
Seamus Smyth's two consecu
tive tries clinched the Cardinal
victory. Donester, a former foot
ball player for the Card, success
fully filled the role of eight-man,
a key offensive and defensive
position.
"It was definitely nice to start
off with a winning game, but it
was more of a learning game for
us," Clayton said. "It showed
our areas where we need to real
ly work. We have to make sure
we build from our defense, and
launch our offense from there."
Boivert agreed that the team
has a lot to learn and gain from
the match; the squad has returned
from the victorious trip with new
practice strategies and a positive
mindset for the upcoming sea
son.
"A lot of our new players
don't tackle too much," Boivert
said. "If they want to wear the
Stanford jersey, we'll have to
start doing that much more. We

need more intensity in defense."
Boivert added that although
the team has a long way to go
until the season kicks in, he is
looking forward to coaching the
team and working with players
to form the squad into its top
condition.
As some of the Cardinal's best
plays on Saturday involved its
many rookies, the season proves
to be promising for the Stanford
team.
"All of [the new playersl
showed glimpses of what they
can do," Warter said. "They
showed a lot of potential."
According to Boivert, Don
ester performed fantastic defen
sive coverage and displayed
excellence in his playing despite
his inexperience as a rugby play
er.
Freshman rookie Alex Haugh,
who carried the ball over the line
to pace the squad in a 25-23 win
for the B-side match, is also one
of the Cardinal's potential jewels
that may be polished to a shine
by the start of the official sea
son.
Haugh's crucial try came
after Sacramento State had
gained momentum with two con
secutive tries and the Cardinal
down 23-18 with a minute to go
before the whistle.
"It was a great introduction
to the game for the rookies,"
junior wing R.J. DeLee said.
"Instead of scrimmaging against
each other, it was our first real
game experience playing togeth
er as a team."
This weekend was a learning
and bonding experience for the
young Cardinal team, DeLee
said.
