# Poli sci prof, Hoover fellow square off

Two Stanford experts on opposing ends of
the political spectrum spent a little more than
an hour assessing the 1996 election last night
in front of a packed house in the Castano
lounge.
Senior Hoover Institution Fellow Martin
Anderson and Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Luis Fraga represented conservative and liber
al ideologies, respectively, during the 7 p.m de
bate, titled "Impact and Evaluation of the '96
Vote." The debate was co-sponsored by Stan
ford In Government, the Stanford College Re
publicans and the Stanford Democrats.
Despite their political differences, Anderson
and Fraga agreed early in the program on some
key issues surrounding the 1996 national elec
tion. Specifically, each man said the nation
showed itself to be moving "to the right" and
Bill Clinton won the presidential election by
appealing to centrist voters.
Fraga included that assertion in his opening
comments, during which he characterized the
election as lacking in drama and "substance

free," as no new msyor ideas gained support. In
his initial statement, Anderson said he was
surprised by how much he agreed with Fraga.
Quickly, though, the speakers showed they
differed in their election analyses. One main
point of contention was Bob Dole's failed pres
idential run. Anderson, who worked on the
campaigns of Presidents Nixon, Reagan and
Bush and also served for several months on the
Dole campaign, said the senator failed to win
the election because of mismanagement.
Dole, Anderson said, should have better ex
plained his economic plan to the public. "The
program was not endorsed by the American
people because no one understood it,"he said.
Fraga disagreed, contending that it is ex
tremely difficult to unseat an incumbent pres
ident during times of economic prosperity.
Dole, he said, then had nothing for people to
identify with.
"The one thing that always seems to work
best was not there for him to latch on to," he
said.
From that point on, the debate grew more
lively as the speakers fielded questions from
the audience. Anderson frequently groaned

and made sweeping hand gestures in response
to Fraga's comments, occasionally interrupt
ing his counterpart to make a point.
For his part, Fraga spent much of the
evening smiling and softly laughing as Ander
son spoke, particularly when the Hoover fellow
was speaking highly of former President
Ronald Reagan.
Toward the end of the discussion, the two
men returned to agreement, this time over the
uncertainty of the election's implications.
Both men said the presidential race for 2000
looks to be wide-open on the Republican side,
with Vice President A 1 Gore holding favored
status for the Democrats.
More immediately, they agreed that the
next fours years are difficult to predict. Ander
son said that it is conceivable that no new laws
will be passed in the next four years. Fraga
agreed.
"I'm not convinced that the American peo
ple knows what it is doing by voting for divided
government," Fraga said, adding that he ex
pects the GOP to vote along party lines in Con
gress and that he sees Clinton's next term as
unpredictable.
