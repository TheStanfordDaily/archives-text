# Research finds networking pays off

It's no secret that one of the main extracur
ricular activities at Stanford is networking.
A recent study by Business Prof. Roberto Fer
nandez indicates just how much all that
schmoozing might pay off someday.
Fernandez, who collaborated with Columbia
University sociologist Kathryn Neckerman, in
vestigated the hiring practices of a large multi
national bank to determine the relative success
of applicants who had referrals from bank em
ployees.
The findings indicated that internal referrals
are key in both obtaining an interview and actu
ally being hired.
Eighty percent of those referred were inter
viewed, compared to 26 percent of non-referrals.
This disparity was also evident in job offers: 66
percent of referrals received offers, while only 12
percent of non-referrals were asked to come
aboard.
Although the study involved only the Califor
nia hiring office of a single bank, reliance on re

ferrals "is not a rare practice," according to Fer
nandez. "American Management Association re
ports that 42 percent of their members use em
ployee referral programs."
Fernandez pointed to three important impli
cations of his research.
The first is that "firms believe that by relying
on referrals, they are expanding the pool of qual
ified people," he said. This occurs partly because
the employee making the referral has a lot riding
on each recommendation â€” often a stipend of
anywhere from $250 to $1,000.
Lance Choy, assistant director of science and
engineering counseling at the Career Planning
and Placement Center, sees several factors at
play.
"There's definitely an economic premium as
well as a pride thing involved in giving referrals,"
he said. "No one wants to be responsible for a bad
hire."
Another important conclusion of the study is
that applicants with referrals tend to know more
about the position by virtue of their connections
within the company. This advantage in informa

tion may have been responsible for the lower
turnover rate among internally referred appli
cants, Fernandez said.
Choy agreed on this count as well. "Contacts
within a company can be extremely helpful; they
can give you insider advice on the imminence of
layoffs, management style, as well as who's a
tyrant and who's easy to work for,"he said.
The final finding of the study involved hiring
cycles. Knowing someone in the company is help
ful because the employee is aware of when the
company has a surplus or shortage of applicants.
"If someone's tipping you off as to when to
apply, then you're going to get a job," said Fer
nandez.
Fernandez said the study is being expanded to
focus on the "social weight" of referrals, that is,
whether referred employees perform better out of
a sense of obligation.
Ironically, Fernandez's own hiring practices
predicted the findings of his study; he was assist
ed by juniors Jeff Hall and Ismael Medrano,
whom he met as freshmen while serving as resi
dent fellow in Soto.
