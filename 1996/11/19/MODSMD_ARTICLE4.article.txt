## Financial Aids Office fixing snags that caused delays for students fall quarter 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
Delays that racked the Financial Aids Of
fice earlier this year should not be a problem
during bill distribution and payment next
quarter, Director of Student Awards Cyn
thia Rife said yesterday.
"My expectation is that [the bills] will be
complete," Rife said. The Bursar's Office is
scheduled to print the winter quarter bills
during Thanksgiving weekend.
Setbacks caused by the implementation of
a new computer system, staff shortage and
office relocation over the summer delayed fi
nancial aid packages for about 300 students
fall quarter.
Many students received large bills that
listed no credits because the Financial Aids
Office had not finished processing all the stu
dent aid packages by the time the Bursar's
Office had printed them.
But many changes have taken place since
the beginning of the academic year.
The Financial Aids Office now has a full
staff. "This makes everyone happier," Rife

said. "However, many are still Ln training.
We're still trying to get them up to speed."
The Financial Aids Office is also working
to improve its voice mail system. The system,
which was installed this summer, was often
a source of frustration for parents and stu
dents calling to inquire about their financial
aid status.
The system disconnects callers when all
the lines are busy, even after they have navi
gated the entire phone tree. The Financial
Aids Office has been working with the Uni
versity's Communications Services to install
a queuing system that will place callers on
hold as they wait in a line to be assisted by an
adviser.
This new system should be up and run
ning by next quarter, Rife said.
The office's business processing re-engi
neering project is also underway. Under this
reorganization, advisers are teamed up in
threes in order to afford a more familiar, im
mediate form of assistance to students. The
teams were announced at the end of October
