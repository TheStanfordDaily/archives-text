# Loan problems solved
## Financial Aids Office fixing snags that caused delays for students fall quarter 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
Delays that racked the Financial Aids Of
fice earlier this year should not be a problem
during bill distribution and payment next
quarter, Director of Student Awards Cyn
thia Rife said yesterday.
"My expectation is that [the bills] will be
complete," Rife said. The Bursar's Office is
scheduled to print the winter quarter bills
during Thanksgiving weekend.
Setbacks caused by the implementation of
a new computer system, staff shortage and
office relocation over the summer delayed fi
nancial aid packages for about 300 students
fall quarter.
Many students received large bills that
listed no credits because the Financial Aids
Office had not finished processing all the stu
dent aid packages by the time the Bursar's
Office had printed them.
But many changes have taken place since
the beginning of the academic year.
The Financial Aids Office now has a full
staff. "This makes everyone happier," Rife

said. "However, many are still Ln training.
We're still trying to get them up to speed."
The Financial Aids Office is also working
to improve its voice mail system. The system,
which was installed this summer, was often
a source of frustration for parents and stu
dents calling to inquire about their financial
aid status.
The system disconnects callers when all
the lines are busy, even after they have navi
gated the entire phone tree. The Financial
Aids Office has been working with the Uni
versity's Communications Services to install
a queuing system that will place callers on
hold as they wait in a line to be assisted by an
adviser.
This new system should be up and run
ning by next quarter, Rife said.
The office's business processing re-engi
neering project is also underway. Under this
reorganization, advisers are teamed up in
threes in order to afford a more familiar, im
mediate form of assistance to students. The
teams were announced at the end of October
In late September, loans were
delayed for many students who
could not complete the appropriate
paperwork until they had received
their financial aid packages. As a re
sult, many could not pick up their
loans on the two payment days
prior to the start of classes.
Loans are still being processed as
late paperwork comes through.
"Every Thursday has been a new
pickup day," said Bursar Jon Erick
son. But this has not been a source
of any major delays, he said.
"There haven't been lines out
the door to El Camino," he said. "As
far as we're concerned, the Finan
cial Aids Office is all caught up."
As a result, students should once
again expect long lines to pickup
their loans in Tresidder Union next
quarter. "Over 4,000 loans are
available for pickup," Erickson
said. "Not everyone will show up,
but I expect about 2,500 to 3,000
students to do so."
Rife said a main difference be
tween her office and other depart
ments on campus is that the Finan
cial Aids Office does not work on a
typical quarterly or yearly calendar.

They are already preparing to
process preliminary packages for
early decision acceptances.
"I'm feeling a bit nervous about
early decision," Rife said. This will
be the first time that the program
will be handled on the new comput
er system.
Erickson recognized the difficul
ty of the changes that the Financial
Aids Office has been undergoing.
"Whenever you put in a new sys
tem, there are bound to be some
growing pains," he said. "But we're
clearly better in the long run."
The new system automates fi
nancial aid packaging and features
a tracking system that can tell stu
dents whether they are missing
documents in their applications.
"Autumn quarter is always
problematic," Erickson said. But
things settle down to a "dull roar by
the winter and spring quarters."
Rife said she is pleased with the
progress that has been made in im
plementing the new changes but re
mained conservative in her opti
mism.
"There's still a lot of room for
improvement for returning under
graduate and graduate students,"
Rife said. "I want to see us go
through a really good year with
those student applicants and then
I'll feel much better."
