# New magazine proposed to serve campus queer community
## 'Masque' founders hope for February premiere 
### Jen Graves Staff writer 
The editors of Stanford's newest literary
magazine claim to have the hippest fliers and
the wildest editorial meetings of any publica
tion on campus.
Masque is the name that a few members of
the queer community have chosen for their
proposed literary magazine. Although the
ASSU and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Com
munity Center have not yet decided to fund it,
Masque already has a staff, a proposed design
and contributions deadline for art, poetry and
literature.
"It's going to open up like the liner notes of
a CD, as one continual piece of art," said editor
in chief Manoella Gonzalez, a sophomore from
Chicago who plans to major in comparative lit
erature. "That is, if we're given the sun, the
moon and the stars [in funding]. That would
be optimal."
Pending funding, the editorial board of
Masque hopes to put the premiere issue of its
square-shaped magazine out sometime late
Februaiy.
"We really have done a lot of research," said
Adam Jernigan, a senior majoring in compar
ative literature who is on Masque's editorial
staff. "We're planningon having the publisher
do only the cover, and we'll do the rest to cut
costs. But we're still having trouble getting
funding."

The editorial board of Masque said it has
revised its original plan to fit the financial pos
sibilities. But Jernigan said he is not worried
about the final product.
"It may not be color," said Jernigan, "but it
will be colorful."
As the creator of the fledgling magazine,
Gonzalez hopes to make Masque an open
forum.
"We want to encompass so much. We want
a little bit of everything from a little bit of
eveiyone," said Gonzalez.
As far as the content of the magazine goes,
Gonzalez and visual art editor Rene Zermeno,
a junior majoring in communication, said it is
anyone's guess what will appear and who the
writers will be.
"As far as I'm concerned, if you're brave
enough to be published in a queer magazine,
you have the right to submit to Masque," Zer
meno said.
"I have no right to define queer, whether
that includes straight people or not," he added.
"We want to break the borders between what's
traditionally acceptable for a magazine and
what's not, and that goes into readership, too.
We ain't say, 'This is this magazine's audi
ence.' "
What, then, do the creators of Masque
mean when they call it a "queer" magazine?
Gonzalez said she didn't want to make a

magazine that was for the "homo
sexual" community only. In other
words, she said, creating a strict line
between the activities of "hetero"
and "homo" sexuals would only
focus on what people do in the bed
room.
"There are all sorts of people out
there who do not fit into traditional
categories," Gonzalez said. "People
who do not live and think in ways
sanctioned by traditional religion
and mores. There are so-called het
erosexual people who I would con
sider queer because of their atti
tudes, because of the openness of
their minds."
Gonzalez stressed that she was
not speaking for the entire gay com
munity at Stanford.
Jernigan said the magazine was
to be "queer-identified as well as
queer-allied." Both those who iden
tify themselves as queer and those
who are open to the queer commu
nity are welcome to submit.
"We don't want the word 'queer'
to be an exclusionist term," said
Jernigan.
Editors of other campus publica
tions said they applaud the emer
gence of new voices and wish
Masque success.
"A publication is a passive way
for normal, every day Stanford stu
dents who aren't activists to get in
touch with the issues once in a
while," said Rula Razek, a senior
and editor of Womenspeak.
Likewise, sophomore Atiba Per
tilla, a creator of the new publica
tion, Summit, says people are likely

to remain "locked in apathy" if they
are not exposed to alternative publi
cations that explicate specific issues.
Junior Aly Remtulla, editor of
The Mind's Eye, a quarterly literary
magazine, called attention to one of
the drawbacks of the many literary
publications that have come out in
recent years.
"I think it's good for each com
munity to have a medium to express
their own issues," said Remtulla.
"But there are so few people inter
ested in literary magazines at Stan
ford that it really ends up dividing
the resources. It's a toss up — I
don't know if it would be better to
have one big magazine with specific
issues or a lot of little ones. But I def
initely recognize that people need
their own forum as well."
Gonzalez sees Masque as a neces
sity for the queer community. She
thought of the idea when she first
arrived on campus and found no
outlet for queer expression.
From there, Gonzalez decided to
start her own magazine, using the
name Masque because of the word's
association with the different faces
people wear. She said she also con
sidered the popular Renaissance
form of the masque, which involved
writing and performing for royalty.
"The nobility kept stables of tal
ented artists ... and would have
them create elaborate plays full of
astounding visuals, gaudy
pageantry, fireworks, anything and
everything that was impressive,"
said Gonzalez.
"It is this idea of pageantry, of a
vast variety of artists and talents
working together to create a whole
that is seductive simultaneously to
the ear and eye, that I want to rap
ture in Masque."

Members of the editorial staff of Masque, a new magazine on campus, plan for their first issue.
magazine that was for the "homo
sexual" community only. In other
words, she said, creating a strict line
between the activities of "hetero"
and "homo" sexuals would only
focus on what people do in the bed
room.
"There are all sorts of people out
there who do not fit into traditional
categories," Gonzalez said. "People
who do not live and think in ways
sanctioned by traditional religion
and mores. There are so-called het
erosexual people who I would con
sider queer because of their atti
tudes, because of the openness of
their minds."
Gonzalez stressed that she was
not speaking for the entire gay com
munity at Stanford.
Jernigan said the magazine was
to be "queer-identified as well as
queer-allied." Both those who iden
tify themselves as queer and those
who are open to the queer commu
nity are welcome to submit.
"We don't want the word 'queer'
to be an exclusionist term," said
Jernigan.
Editors of other campus publica
tions said they applaud the emer
gence of new voices and wish
Masque success.
"A publication is a passive way
for normal, every day Stanford stu
dents who aren't activists to get in
touch with the issues once in a
while," said Rula Razek, a senior
and editor of Womenspeak.
Likewise, sophomore Atiba Per
tilla, a creator of the new publica
tion, Summit, says people are likely

to remain "locked in apathy" if they
are not exposed to alternative publi
cations that explicate specific issues.
Junior Aly Remtulla, editor of
The Mind's Eye, a quarterly literary
magazine, called attention to one of
the drawbacks of the many literary
publications that have come out in
recent years.
"I think it's good for each com
munity to have a medium to express
their own issues," said Remtulla.
"But there are so few people inter
ested in literary magazines at Stan
ford that it really ends up dividing
the resources. It's a toss up — I
don't know if it would be better to
have one big magazine with specific
issues or a lot of little ones. But I def
initely recognize that people need
their own forum as well."
Gonzalez sees Masque as a neces
sity for the queer community. She
thought of the idea when she first
arrived on campus and found no
outlet for queer expression.
From there, Gonzalez decided to
start her own magazine, using the
name Masque because of the word's
association with the different faces
people wear. She said she also con
sidered the popular Renaissance
form of the masque, which involved
writing and performing for royalty.
"The nobility kept stables of tal
ented artists ... and would have
them create elaborate plays full of
astounding visuals, gaudy
pageantry, fireworks, anything and
everything that was impressive,"
said Gonzalez.
"It is this idea of pageantry, of a
vast variety of artists and talents
working together to create a whole
that is seductive simultaneously to
the ear and eye, that I want to rap
ture in Masque."
