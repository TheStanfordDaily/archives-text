# New magazine proposed to serve campus queer community
## 'Masque' founders hope for February premiere 
### Jen Graves Staff writer 
The editors of Stanford's newest literary
magazine claim to have the hippest fliers and
the wildest editorial meetings of any publica
tion on campus.
Masque is the name that a few members of
the queer community have chosen for their
proposed literary magazine. Although the
ASSU and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Com
munity Center have not yet decided to fund it,
Masque already has a staff, a proposed design
and contributions deadline for art, poetry and
literature.
"It's going to open up like the liner notes of
a CD, as one continual piece of art," said editor
in chief Manoella Gonzalez, a sophomore from
Chicago who plans to major in comparative lit
erature. "That is, if we're given the sun, the
moon and the stars [in funding]. That would
be optimal."
Pending funding, the editorial board of
Masque hopes to put the premiere issue of its
square-shaped magazine out sometime late
Februaiy.
"We really have done a lot of research," said
Adam Jernigan, a senior majoring in compar
ative literature who is on Masque's editorial
staff. "We're planningon having the publisher
do only the cover, and we'll do the rest to cut
costs. But we're still having trouble getting
funding."

The editorial board of Masque said it has
revised its original plan to fit the financial pos
sibilities. But Jernigan said he is not worried
about the final product.
"It may not be color," said Jernigan, "but it
will be colorful."
As the creator of the fledgling magazine,
Gonzalez hopes to make Masque an open
forum.
"We want to encompass so much. We want
a little bit of everything from a little bit of
eveiyone," said Gonzalez.
As far as the content of the magazine goes,
Gonzalez and visual art editor Rene Zermeno,
a junior majoring in communication, said it is
anyone's guess what will appear and who the
writers will be.
"As far as I'm concerned, if you're brave
enough to be published in a queer magazine,
you have the right to submit to Masque," Zer
meno said.
"I have no right to define queer, whether
that includes straight people or not," he added.
"We want to break the borders between what's
traditionally acceptable for a magazine and
what's not, and that goes into readership, too.
We ain't say, 'This is this magazine's audi
ence.' "
What, then, do the creators of Masque
mean when they call it a "queer" magazine?
Gonzalez said she didn't want to make a
