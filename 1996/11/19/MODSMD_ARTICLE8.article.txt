# Union fighting trend of layoffs
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
A trend of layoffs on campus has raised
concerns among union members about Stan
ford's treatment of its workers.
Lenny Mcßride, field representative for
United Stanford Workers Union local 715,
said the increasing number of layoffs repre
sents a "callous" act by Stanford.
"It's a trend that's happening here at Stan
ford where they're getting rid of loyal work
ers," Mcßride said. "All Stanford is looking at
is the almighty dollar. We're really outraged,
and we're going to battle over this."
In September dozens of workers were laid
off when the board of the Faculty Club —
which is independent from the University —
decided to contract the club out to a private
management firm.
The most recent example came when the
University decided to outsource the ware
housing and fulfillment distribution func
tions of the Stanford University Press to
Cambridge University Press, a decision which
will leave several people without jobs by
March.
Faculty Club Board Chair Barton Thomp
son, a law professor, said in September that
the club had been contracted to a private firm
mainly "to improve the quality of the club . . .
not to reduce labor costs."
Similarly, the decision to outsource the
Stanford Press was not purely based on finan
cial criteria, said University Budget Director
Tim Warner.
He stressed that the decision was based
first on the desire to use the space for acade
mic facilities. Second, he said, "It was clear
after doing pretty extensive analyses that
there would be significant savings involved in
making this move."

Employee Relations Manager Keith Smith
agreed with Warner, saying that the decision
did not rest on financial issues.
"The budget cuts had nothing to do with
it," Smith said. "It has to do with the fact that
the book warehouse is in a space that we have
earmarked for academic facilities."
According to Norris Pope, director of the
Stanford Press, financial factors came into
play only after the University administration
had decided it needed the building.
He added that the decision to outsource the
Stanford Press was made after other options
were weighed and found unfavorable.
"Our own proposal to set up a warehouse in
East Bay was more expensive than the exter
nal options — proposals made to us by a num
ber of outside sources — so the Provost's Of
fice decided that it was better to externalize
the warehousing and fulfillment distribution
function," Pope said.
According to Mcßride, 30 workers are cur
rently employed by the Stanford Press, about
11 of whom have been notified that they will
be laid off.
"These are all good workers, folks that
have been here for years, who have families.
What Stanford is doing is closing down the fa
cility . . . and sending these workers out in
the cold," he said.
Mcßride added that the University had
made no effort to inform the union during the
decision-making process.
"Stanford is not IBM," Mcßride said. "It's
supposed to be a university. It's supposed to
be humane. There's supposed to be dialogue."
Several workers at the Stanford Press who
were notified of the layoffs added that there
had been very little communication between
workers and top administrators regarding
what would happen after they were laid off.
"Thev told us that no other such classifica

tion existed at Stanford anymore," said one
worker, who asked to remain anonymous.
"They said some people from human re
sources would come find out what our skills
were, help us with resumes, give us free mem
bership to the Career Action Center and talk
to us about the benefits we'd get if we were
laid off. . . . That was the extent."
"We're looking for jobs. We just haven't
found any yet," said A 1 Trevino, another
worker at the Stanford Press warehouse.
Smith said the workers had been informed
adequately in advance and treated in accor
dance with the contract between the Board of
Trustees and the union.
"This is not something that we are doing
willy-nilly and suddenly finding ourselves at
odds with the union," Smith said. "We have a
contract with the union, and we are following
the language and the spirit of the contract in
this situation."
Warner said the University would continue
its efforts to help laid-off workers find new
jobs, either on campus or elsewhere.
"I don't think anyone is pleased about the
impact on individuals, but the decision in
terms of the financial impact is clear," Warn
er said. "I think it was a fairly straightfor
ward, compelling case, apart from the fact
that people are being hurt, and we're doing
everything we can to mitigate that impact."
Many workers, however, have different
hopes. In a written statement, Trevino said he
hopes the University will use its workers in
other positions on campus, rather than laying
off workers.
"We have longtime service with Stanford.
It has been a good employer and continues to
be," Trevino wrote. "We at the Press ware
house feel part of the Stanford community,
are part of the Stanford community and hope
to remain so."
