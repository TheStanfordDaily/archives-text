# Prof chosen to give Nobel speech
## Milgrom will fill in for late economics prize-winner Vickrey 
### Nathan Gillespie 
Economics Prof. Paul Milgrom will lecture
at a Nobel Prize seminar in Stockholm, Swe
den, on Dec. 9 in honor of Nobel laureate
William Vickrey, the winner of the 1996
Nobel Memorial Prize in economic sciences.
The special seminar is being staged be
cause Vickrey, who would normally deliver
the lecture himself, died three days after re
ceiving the award.
Vickrey, an economist at Columbia Univer
sity , died of a heart attack Oct. 11 at the age of
82.
"I was very pleased when Vickrey won his
prize," said Milgrom. "His work was brilliant
and had great influence on me. I was deeply
saddened to hear of his death."
Milgrom called the opportunity to lecture
at the Nobel seminar in Vickrey's memory

"the best thing I can do to honor the man."
Milgrom will lecture on the application of
auction theory, an economic field developed
by Vickrey.
Milgrom was chosen because he is "about
as prominent a fellow in the theory of auc
tions as there is," according to Robert Wilson,
an economics professor at the Graduate
School of Business who worked with Milgrom
to design an auction system for the 1994 fed
eral government sale of radio spectrum li
censes for wireless technologies.
That auction, run by the Federal Commu
nications Commission, utilized Milgrom's
model of the simultaneous ascending bid auc
tion — an application of Vickrey's theories —
to coordinate what Milgrom called "the
largest sale of public assets in recent history."
Milgrom's model for the auction accounted
for a situation in which the value of a spec

trum license depends on the other licenses the
purchaser acquires. In traditional auctions,
all items are valued independent of the oth
ers.
The same principles were included in Mil
grom's recent proposal to Washington of a
model for the universal services auction,
which could be the largest public auction ever.
Most of Milgrom's Nobel lecture will center
on his use of Vickrey's theories in the con
struction of his model for this auction.
In addition to his work in U.S. government
auctions, Milgrom has also been a consultant
to auctions held by the governments of Aus
tralia, Canada and Mexico.
Milgrom will split time at the Nobel Prize
seminar with Jean-Jacques Laffont, an econ
omist at the University of Toulouse who spe
cializes in public economics, another field pio
neered by Vickrey.
