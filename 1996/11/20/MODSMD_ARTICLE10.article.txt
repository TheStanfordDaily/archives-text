# Laundry put on Stanford Card Plan
## 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
Lack of quarters is no longer a justifiable
defense for dirty laundry in Stern and
Wilbur Halls. Now all Stanford students
need is their ID card.
Beginning this week, all washing ma
chines and dryers in the two halls can be op
erated using a Stanford identification card,
on the Stanford Card Plan.
The idea of the new computerized system
is that it will be a service for students, as well
as another step in making the ID card the
universal card for all student needs, Bursar
Jon Erickson said.
"The hope is that this will be a conve
nience for students and will cut down on the

need to roam the halls of one's dorm at 2 in
the morning looking for quarters," Erickson
said.
Students can already use ID cards at vend
ing machines, to gain access to library and
recreational facilities, with meal plans and
Cardinal Dollars to pay for food at Bon Ap
petit and Tresidder Express, and as Wells
Fargo Bank ATM cards, Erickson noted.
He also hopes that by providing all of
these services via the ID card, students will
not have to carry much cash.
"In the long run, students will be able to
have all of their services from one piece of
plastic," he explained.
Currently, he said, about 2,800 students
have money on the plan. As of yesterday, he
added, 35 students had tried the new laundry

service.
For now, the machines on the computer
ized account are only in Wilbur and Stern.
Erickson said these two dormitories are test
ing out the system to make sure there are no
problems.
If all goes well, Branner and Toyon Halls
will be hooked up to the service next. Erick
son expects to phase in the rest of the com
puterized accounts over the next six
months.
Manzanita Park and Crothers Hall will be
next, followed by Roble Hall, Lagunita Court
and Governor's Corner.
Eventually students may be able to use
their identification cards at locations such as
the new Polio Rey restaurant at Tresidder
Union, Erickson added.
