# Professor discusses work with Dole
## Taylor shares stories of campaign trail, birth of 15-percent tax cut plan 
### Robert Chiles Contributing writer 
Economics Prof. John Taylor discussed his
experiences working for Bob Dole's presiden
tial campaign in an appearance at Castano
Lounge last night.
Taylor, who served as a member of Ronald
Reagan's council of economic advisers, defined
public policy as the work of getting new ideas
into practice, then said the reason he got in
volved with the Dole campaign was to influ
ence political practices.
Taylor began working closely with Dole
after a meeting last May during which Dole
asked close senators and economists whether
they thought there was an economic issue in
the campaign. Everyone at the meeting then
gave a presentation, and ideas were debated for
three or four hours, Taylor said.
The group decided economic growth under
the Clinton administration was too slow and
lower taxes would bolster the economy.
When the meeting was finished, Dole asked
Taylor to write up the conclusions reached by
the panel.
Taylor said he completed a 10- to 20-page

rough and opinionated memo of the discussion
and issued it to five of his colleagues. It didn't
take long for the memo to get published in The
Wall Street Journal, which took Taylor totally
off guard.
"Our phone was just ringing off the hook,"
he said.
From then on, Taylor played an active role
in the Dole campaign. The decision to push a
15-percent general tax reduction was reached
by Aug. 5, the day Dole revealed his tax plan at
a speech in Chicago. "I wish the decision had
been made earlier," Taylor said.
He added that the economics plan "was a lot
more than just a tax cut. ... It was ultimately
tax reform."
Whether or not the tax cut was a political
ploy was never discussed. "Maybe I wasn't at
the right meetings," he added.
Taylor described the peak of the campaign
as the nomination of Jack Kemp as vice presi
dent. Kemp, he said, was consistent with the
tax plan, the campaign and the Republican Na
tional Convention in San Diego.
The major criticism of the tax plan, Taylor
said, came not because it was declared a tax cut
for the rich but because it would increase the

budget deficit. Toward the end, Taylor said, "I
think people got cold feet" and didn't support
the tax cut wholeheartedly.
Taylor attributed Dole's loss partly to a lack
of support among conservatives. In order to
win, "You have a good fraction of your party
behind you," he said.
Taylor said he wished to do away with the
tax increases made by Bush and Clinton, while
many Republican senators had voted for the
Clinton tax increase. He also mentioned that
citizens are very skeptical of hearing politi
cians vow that they will cut taxes.
The media's "vicious" and "unmitigated"
attacks also contributed to some of the cam
paign's troubles, according to Taylor. "He got
hit very bad by the press to begin with which
isn't very surprising."
In one article, The New York Times accused
Taylor of selling out his beliefs, he said. How
ever, he added that he didn't want to blame the
press for the election results.
Personally, Taylor said he regretted not
hammering the 15-percent tax cut enough. "I
think the campaign could've advertised the tax
cut a little bit more," Taylor said. "I probably
could have been more forceful."
