FOR THE RECORD...
An article in Friday's Daily incorrectly attributed a statement
to Heather Dunn, assistant director of the Office of Student Activ
ities. The statement should have been attributed to a press release
from the Office of Student Activities and Cowell Health Promotion
Services. In addition, the article incorrectly identified the organi
zation for which senior Bret Logue serves as co-president. Logue is
co-president of the Margaret Mills Society.
