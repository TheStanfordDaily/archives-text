## Wilson in action Governor tries to hold 209 lawsuit 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Gov. Pete Wilson wants the
Proposition 209 case decided in
state court rather than by a feder
al judge.
In papers filed Monday,
lawyers for Wilson asked Chief
U.S. District Judge Thelton Hen
derson to put a lawsuit by civil
rights groups on hold, at least
until California courts interpret
Proposition 209's meaning and
scope.
Proposition 209, a state consti
tutional amendment passed Nov.
5, outlaws affirmative action pro
grams that give preferential
treatment based on race or sex.
Henderson is scheduled to hear
arguments next Monday over
whether to block enforcement of
the measure.
A federal court lawsuit, filed
Nov. 6 on behalf of minority and
female contractors, labor unions
and students in targeted pro
grams, contends Proposition 209
is discriminatory. The suit says
the initiative, despite its neutral
language, affects only programs
that benefit women and minori
ties, while maintaining prefer

ences that favor other groups,
like veterans seeking jobs.
Supporters of the measure
scoff at the argument. Far from
being discriminatory, Proposition
209 declares "the rights of all per
sons to be free from discrimina
tion caused by preferences based
on race and gender," Deputy
Attorney General Paul Dobson,
lawyer for Wilson and other state
officials sued in the case, said in
court papers.
Since the election, the two
sides have tried to maneuver the
legal battle onto friendly terrain.
The same battle took place over
Proposition 187, the 1994 immi
gration initiative, which has
been largely blocked by a federal
judge. Supporters of Proposi
tion 209 prefer to be in the state
courts, where appointees of Wil
son and former Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian predomi
nate. Opponents favor federal
court, where judges are appoint
ed for life, with no fear of voter
reprisal for an unpopular ruling
— and where a liberal, Demo
cratic-appointed judge was avail
able for the case.
