# ValuJet crash recreated

### 
MIAMI (AP) â€” A videotape of a
plane cargo hold engulfed in a
white-hot, hissing fire sparked by
an oxygen-generating canister as a
test left relatives of the victims of
ValuJet Flight 592 red-eyed and
tearful yesterday.
Investigators searching for a
cause into the May 11 crash re-cre
ated what they believed happened
to the doomed jetliner, triggering
an oxygen generator to start a fire
in an old plane and then taping it
as temperatures soared.
The fires burned at a white-hot
3,000 degrees and above, said Mer
ritt Birky, an explosion expert with
the National Transportation Safe
ty Board, which held a hearing yes
terday at which the videotape was
played.
"This is the hottest fire I've ever
seen in a test," he said.
Investigators have said at least
500-degree heat was needed to par
tially melt the aluminum frame of
a passenger seat found in the jet
liner, which nose-dived into the
Everglades, killing all 110 people
aboard.
They suspect about 135 oxygen
generating canisters packed in five
boxes in the cargo hold started an
intense fire in the DC-9.
Yesterday was the first time the
videotaped re-creation was shown
in public. Relatives of about a
dozen victims dabbed their eyes
and hung their heads as the finger
size fire quickly grew into a groan
ing, white-and-yellow blaze cov
ered by pinkish-brown smoke.
The haunting noise on the
videotape sounded human to some
relatives.
"I could hear my daughter in

there, it seemed like," said Ella
Gore, of Erie, Pa. "They didn't
have a chance. The smoke killed
them. That's what I do believe."
In one taped test, boxes of oxy
gen generators like those in the
hold of the ValuJet plane were
ignited. In the second test, a tire
and luggage were added.
The test fires produced flames
five to seven minutes after the gen
erator was triggered and spread
more quickly with the luggage
around it. The flight lasted only
nine minutes, Birky said.
Sabre Tech Corp., the company
that packed the oxygen-generating
canisters into cardboard boxes,
objected that the fires started in
only three of eight tests and addi
tional bubble wrap encouraged
ignition. Only two of the tests were
shown on the tapes.
"None of the above test condi
tions are consistent with, nor do
they even resemble, the way the
boxes were actually packaged,"
company coordinator John Meekly
wrote.
Two ValuJet ramp agents testi
fied earlier that there was nothing
unusual about the doomed flight's
cargo.
Both said they didn't know the
oxygen generators, which resem
ble a shaving cream can with
wires sticking out, were haz
ardous and would not have
allowed them on board if they had
known.
"We trust in the people who
bring the box," said ramp agent
Dennis Segarra.
Maintenance manuals call for
caps to be installed to disable the
generators when shipped.
