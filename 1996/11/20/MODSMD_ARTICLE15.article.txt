WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton
administration sharply scaled back its pro
posed military relief mission to Rwanda yes
terday, opting to send about 1,000 logistics
specialists instead of combat troops.
Defense Secretary William Perry said the
"very positive development" of hundreds of
thousands of refugees returning home to
Rwanda prompted the administration to
adjust its strategy.
"We are modifying our plans based on this
dramatic change," Perry told a conference on
military procurement.
"The U.S. contribution will be less than
1,000 and these will be support — logistics —
not combat troops," Perry added.
Perry said a final decision on the Canadian
led multinational military relief effort will be
made Thursday in Stuttgart, Germany, at a
meeting of officials from nations offering to
join the 10,000- to 12,000-strong force.
A senior administration official later said
discussions with U.S. allies and with Rwanda
and its neighbors would continue at least
through Saturday. The U.S. force would arrive
two to three days after a final decision is made,
she said.
The official said the plan would not go for
ward without the support of the Rwandan
government, which repeated yesterday that
with refugees returning, the mission is not
needed.
"Obviously, we need the consent of the
Rwandan government," the U.S. official said
"Given the nature of the mission, it wouldn't
be worthwhile if (Rwanda) weren't agreeable."
In the meantime, U.S. airlift control teams
have been sent to three airfields in Africa to
help provide relief supplies. Those teams will
work out of airports in Rwanda, Kenya and
Uganda, Perry said.
Perry said the situation in Africa "still
remains very fluid" and the administration is
prepared to step up its efforts if needed.
