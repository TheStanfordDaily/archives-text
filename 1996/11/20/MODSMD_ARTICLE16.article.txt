# U.S. vetoes Boutros-Ghali for second term
## U.N. Secretary-General reaffirms candidacy despite U.S. vote in Security Council 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Alone among Security Council
members, the United States
vetoed Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali for a second term
yesterday and appealed to African
states to offer other candidates to
avoid a diplomatic deadlock.
But the 74-year-old Egyptian
immediately indicated he would
remain a candidate, as U.N. rules
permit. African ambassadors
urged the United States to change
its mind and referred the issue to
their capitals and the Organiza
tion of African Unity to decide the
next move.
Security Council members
have agreed to seek an African for
the job, to ensure that the region
has a representative for two
terms, as is customary. If
Boutros-Ghali's candidacy
becomes implausible, attention
would focus first on other African
nominees.
As expected, the United States
cast the lone vote against

Boutros-Ghali among the 15
council members, in the opening
round of a selection process that
could take weeks.
Washington announced last
June that it would veto Boutros-
Ghali, claiming he has not pur
sued U.N. reform vigorously
enough. U.S. officials said the
Republican-controlled Congress
was unlikely to pay the more than
$1 billion in U.S. debts to the
United Nations unless there is a
change in U.N. leadership.
"We have stated over and over
again we will give special prefer
ence to an African candidate, but
it's important for them to come
forward with an African candi
date" other than Boutros-Ghali,
said U.S. Ambassador Madeleine
Albright.
The United States offered no
alternative candidate, and African
diplomats appeared divided over
how to respond. Diplomats said
some African governments still
held out hope Washington would

back down, and the African
ambassadors conferred for more
than three hours late yesterday
before referring the issue to lead
ers in Africa.
China, which also holds veto
power as one of five permanent
council members, was expected to
reject any candidate unacceptable
to the Africans. Other permanent
members — Russia, France and
Britain — were also arrayed
against the United States.
The council must agree on a
candidate and forward the name
to the 185-member General
Assembly before Boutros-Ghali's
five-year term expires Dec. 31.
"We are very pleased with the
results," Egyptian Ambassador
Nabil Elaraby said. "It proved
that the whole world was behind
Africa and the candidate Africa
chose, which is the current secre
tary-general."
Ambassador Alfredo Lopes
Cabral of Guinea-Bissau noted
that candidates in the past have

overcome objections by perma
nent members in initial voting
rounds.
The 14-1 vote was unusual in
an organization where the United
States wields enormous influence.
Western diplomats cited several
factors, including discontent over
Washington's refusal Jo pay its
bills.
U.S. officials are hoping that
after an initial show of support,
Boutros-Ghali's allies will seek
other candidates or convince him
to step aside for the good of the
United Nations.
"At the end of the day, the
U.N. needs the U.S. more than,
with ail due respect, it needs to
retain its current leadership,"
State Department spokesman
Glyn Davies said
Davies said the United States
would like to see attention shift to
possible successors "capable of
bringing serious reform to the
international structure, an able
diplomat."
