Smart smoking
WASHINGTON (AP) — Cigarette smoking
sharpens short-term learning and memory among
young people, but the slight improvement comes
at a high risk of heart disease, cancer and a short
ened life span, researchers say.
The finding's real value may lie in providing
clues about how to treat nicotine addiction, the
researchers said yesterday.
In an effort to pinpoint the precise effects on the
brain of nicotine from cigarettes, researchers at
UC-San Diego, tested young smokers and non
smokers at a word game that required rapid mem
ory and quick recall.
Smokers were quicker and more accurate in
specifying whether or not a word was part of a set
of five words that had been flashed on the screen
shortly before. That is a powerful test of working
memory.
The researcher, a nonsmoker himself, empha
sized however that the slight advantage does not
justify the severe additional health risks of smok
ing cigarettes.
Orange County blues
SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — Robert L. Citron,
the Orange County treasurer whose risky, casino
style investments precipitated the biggest munici
pal bankruptcy in U.S. history, was sentenced to a
year in jail and fined $100,000 for fraud yesterday.
Citron, 71, was also ordered to perform 1,000
hours of community service and undergo psycho
logical counseling.
Superior Court Judge J. Stephen Czuleger sent
Citron to prison despite a plea from his lawyers,
who argued that brain damage compromised his
financial acumen and made him easy to manipu
late. Prosecutors had pressed for seven years
behind bars.
Citron and his wife walked slowly out of the
courthouse, holding hands, almost shuffling. Me
must surrender to authorities Jan. 10.
