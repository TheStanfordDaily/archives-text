# Castro gets pope's pledge to visit Cuba

### 
VATICAN CUT (AP) - In a
stroke of brilliance or folly, Fidel
Castro won a long-sought pledge
yesterday from Pope John Paul II
to visit Communist Cuba next
year, capping a triumphant stay
in Rome by the Latin American
revolutionary
But, as the Vatican made clear,
the pope accepted the invitation
only after Castro agreed to the
usual conditions for papal trips —
that the pope can travel anywhere
and meet with anyone. The
Cuban leader had hoped to
restrict the pope's visit and may
have paid a risky price for papal
recognition.
"The only thing missing is the
date in 1997," papal spokesman
Joaquin Navarro-Valls said.
Preparations will begin "shortly,"
he said. A Cuban stop in October
during an already scheduled trip
to Brazil was one possibility.
Cuba is the only Ameri
can country John Paul has yet to
visit, and people questioned for
years whether he would ever go to
the Communist island That all
ended dunng Castro's historic,
35-minute audience in the pope's
private library
On one side was a bearded 70-
year-old Cuban with a Catholic
education whose revolution has
endured for nearly four decades
and made him a cultural icon for
the left. On the other: a Pole who
leads nearly 1 billion Roman
Catholics and helped bring down
communism in the Soviet bloc.

deepening Cuba's isolation.
While the Roman Catholic
Church in Cuba traditionally has
lacked the strength of the church
in John Paul's Poland, the pope
could become a rallying point for
anti-Castro Cubans.
"Of course. I would not impose
conditions. We will treat him with
respect," Castro told reporters
about six hours after the meeting.
His tone was a great contrast
to 1990, when a possible papal
trip was shelved after Castro
accused the church of "anti-revo
lutionary" meddling.
The Cuban leader apparently
hopes Vatican influence can help
ease the 34-year U.S. embargo
against Cuba, recently stiffened
by the Helms-Burton Act intend
ed to discourage foreign compa
nies from investing in Cuba.
The embargo on Cuba did not
come up during Castro's meeting
with John Paul, Navarro said,
although the pope opened the
World Food Summit in Rome last
week condemning the use of
embargoes.
The pope is seeking greater
political liberty and more freedom
for the church, such as better
access to the media and permis
sion for foreign pnests to work in
Cuba to bolster a dwindling clergy
of 200 men.
Reports from Cuban church
officials indicate the government
has given the church a greater
opening recently while keeping
the lid on other dissent.
