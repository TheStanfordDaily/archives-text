For the biggest Big
Game in 60 years, a
glut of unbought tix

BIG GAME IS unquestion
ably the single most defin
ing athletic event at Stan
ford. Even in a school that boasts
the nation's most dominant over
all athletic program in the coun
try, a game between often
mediocre football squads remains
the event that gets athletically
apathetic students into the stadi
um â€” or so it used to be.
This year's Stanford-Cal con
test is expected to draw about
65,000 fans, leaving around
10,000 empty seats in Berkeley's
Memorial Stadium. Perhaps if this
were merely a one-time occur
rence it could be dismissed as an
aberration. But the disturbing
empty-seat count is merely the
latest instance in a disturbing
trend; the Department of Athlet
ics has struggled to promote Stan
ford's major sports.
While the Athletics Department
has tried to promote Stanford
football all year, the largest crowd
at Stanford Stadium this year still
filled less than half of the cav
ernous 85,500-seat facility. Even
in Stanford's poor seasons in 1993
and 1994, when Stanford man
aged just seven wins total, the
Cardinal never suffered through
similar attendance worries. The
announced figure of 30,280 fans
for Stanford's final home game of
the year against Washington State
was clearly a generous estimate,
and while that game was in the
rain, even Homecoming drew less
than 42,000 fans.
It's true that the department
can't force people to come to
games. But it could do a better job
of promoting the games and main
taining a consistent, reasonable
policy of selling tickets, especially
when it comes to Big Game.
When the Athletics Depart
ment began selling student sea
son tickets, tickets for all home

games were a $32 bargain plus an
additional $17 for Big Game,
while admission to Big Game
alone was an outlandish $50. The
implication is clear: Make the stu
dents buy season tickets even if
they want only to go to Big Game.
Unfortunately, most students
won't pay $49 just to watch their
other tickets go to waste.
Perhaps this was an effective
policy when tickets to Big Game
were precious commodities, and
near-overflow crowds were the
norm. But last year's Big Game
crowd of 72,893, the smallest in
23 years, should have alerted
both schools that the demand was
not the same as in years past.
Caught between a rock and a
hard place, the Athletics Depart
ment scrambled to offer student
tickets to Big Game and last
week's game for a total of $25.
This infuriated those who had
paid $50 in September just to see
Big Game, and it was poorly pro
moted so that most who might
have been interested didn't get
the chance. Now, tickets are back
to $50.
Ever since Bill Walsh left the
program after the 1994 season,
football has failed to draw despite
offering a simply better team the
past two years.
Internally, the Athletics Depart
ment has undergone numerous
personnel changes since then, and
it just hasn't generated any excite
ment, scrambling to find a radio
announcer until several days before
the season opener and offering a
meek slogan of "Stanford Football
Happens!" in newspaper advertise
ments.
To be fair, Cal has struggled as
well, drawing an average of less
than 40,000 fans per game despite
garnering substantially more
media coverage.
But both schools should ques
tion why this Big Game, with as
many postseason implications as
any in the last 61 years, will likely
draw the fewest fans of any in the
past 25.
