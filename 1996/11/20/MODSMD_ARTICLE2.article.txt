# Student group targets monopolies
## SMOC leader says lowering Bookstore prices is top priority on agenda 
### David Felman 
Students have banded together to com
bat what they perceive as an unfair mo
nopoly of the Stanford Bookstore.
Stop Monopolies on Campus, or SMOC,
is a new student-run organization seeking
to challenge what its members see as over
pricing at the Bookstore and Tresidder Ex
press.
"I hope to force down prices at the
Bookstore and finally suppress its monop
olistic tyranny," said junior Danny Bram
zon, SMOC's founder.
Bramzon, who estimates 200 students
have joined his crusade, said he developed

the idea for SMOC while shopping for a
new electronic pencil sharpener.
"I went to buy an electric pencil sharp
ener at Costco; it was $17.95.1 thought it
couldn't be more than that at the Book
store," he said. "The same exact pencil
sharpener was $34.95."
In addition, Bramzon called the prices
at Tresidder Express and the Track House
"ludicrous." Both Tresidder Express and
the Track House are owned by the Book
store.
Ken Shark, director of operations at the
Bookstore, said, "Tresidder Express does
make money, [but] it does not make a huge
amount of money. Every dollar it makes

goes toward the Bookstore rebates."
According to Shark, any surplus de
rived from stores owned by the Bookstore,
including Tresidder Express, the Track
House, the U-Shop (in the Stanford Shop
ping Center) and the Medical Bookstore,
goes directly into the consolidated surplus
that the board of directors then distributes
to the students, faculty and staff in the
form of rebates.
"SMOC hopes its grass-roots, student
led effort will suffice. Meager rebates will
appease us no more," Bramzon said.
This year, the Bookstore set rebates at
it) percent.
Despite SMOC members' com
plaints, however, neither Bramzon
nor any representative of SMOC
has yet spoken with Peggy Mendel
son, president and CEO of the
Bookstore.
"I find it amazing that they have
not spoken with us," Mendelson
said. "I think what someone like
Bramzon might not understand, if
he had not taken a few basic eco
nomics courses, is that in order to
cover the goods that we are not
making money on, we have to make
money on something.
"Something has to pay the rent
to the University; something has to
cover the costs of running a busi
ness."
Mendelson acknowledged that
the price of some clothing is high.
She justified this by saying some
customers can afford a $65 sweat
shirt and pointed out that the Book
store also offers sweatshirts that
cost $19.95. The surplus from a
more expensive sweatshirt goes to

cover costs and to fund rebates.
"We're trying to keep prices as
low as possible without going
under. We think this is our commit
ment to the campus," Mendelson
said. Deciding which products to
make money on and which not to,
Mendelson added, is a delicate bal
ance, especially for a nonprofit or
ganization.
Concerning Bramzon's example
of the overpriced pencil sharpener,
Mendelson said, "Costco buys by
the millions. If we buy 12 and they
buy a million, they will get a better
price on small items which we don't
have a big demand for."
Regarding textbooks, Mendel
son said the Bookstore keeps its
margins as low as possible. Howev
er, prices are high because of expen
sive freight, publisher fees and
other royalties.
"I think one of the things that
hurts us a little bit at Stanford as
opposed to other campuses is the
fact that there is a lot of freedom in
registering very late for classes. If
we knew the quantity of textbooks
early in the year, then we might be
able to save a little bit on the
freight," Mendelson said.
"We're not trying to make ex

cuses that our textbooks are higher
priced," Shark added. "Our text
books are not higher priced than
textbooks at other campuses....
We have no control over what the
publishers are going to charge, nor
do we have any control over what
books we're going to carry."
Until two years ago, the Stan
ford Bookstore faced competition
from a privately owned store in the
Stanford Barn, specializing in text
books.
Shark said this store, although it
might have appeared to be a lower
price provider of textbooks, had the
luxury of choosing which books it
could sell.
"We don't have the luxury of
cherry-picking. When the profes
sors tell us what classes they are
going to have and what books to
carry, we are committed to carrying
every single one of those books in
the quantity the professors speci
fy," Shark said.
Students have attempted to chal
lenge the Bookstore in the past.
Most notably, "Beat the Bookstore,"
created in the late 1980s, offered an
alternative to the Stanford Book
store for selling unwanted books.
The ASSU canceled this project at

the end of spring quarter 1993 be
cause of high financial losses.
Employees who are full-time
Stanford students receive a dis
count on textbooks, and Mendelson
added that even though the Book
store incurs a loss with such dis
counts, they encourage longevity
and loyalty among the Bookstore's
100 student employees.
"When you think in terms of a
monopoly you think in terms of a
profit-making organization that
has shareholders that are greedy,"
Mendelson said. "The point is, we
don't have shareholders. We have a
board of directors that all work for
free... that want this bookstore to
be the pride of this University."
SMOC members said they hope
to gain the support of the faculty
and the ASSU Senate during the
next two weeks.
"We expect the ASSU Presi
dent's Office to fully support our
mission and implement the neces
sary pressures on the administra
tion to accomplish our goal," Bram
zon said.
SMOC is also in the process of
screening Stanford Law School stu
dents who may consider challeng
ing the Bookstore legally.
