## America's responsibility 
### 
IN CASE YOU didn't notice, Presi
dent Clinton issued two major foreign
policy announcements last week.
Clinton first sent 2,000 U.S. troops to
Zaire and then announced that troops
would remain in Bosnia for an additional
18 months. The response on campus was
underwhelming.
Bosnia is off America's radar map.
Zaire won't make it on unless American
troops get killed. Few people have backed
the president in either of his pronounce
ments, while members of both parties
were quick to condemn his initial decision
to send troops last year.
Clinton hasn't enunciated it at all, but
a new criteria has emerged in U.S. foreign
policy development, and it is a criteria of
which we should all be proud: American
forces should be used to prevent genocide.
Anywhere.
Immediately following the Holocaust,
the world vowed "never again," yet time
and time again we have watched as geno
cide has recurred. Over a million dead in
Cambodia. Half a million dead in Rwanda
two years ago. An estimated 200,000 in
Bosnia.
While the success of our mission in
Bosnia is not yet complete, we have
achieved one important goal: We stopped
the killing.
Just in case you forgot, let's remember
what the rest of the world accomplished
in Bosnia without American leadership.
By January 1995, the United Nations had
established six "safe-hayejis" for Muslim

refugees. By July, Bosnian Serbs had
overrun several of these, including Sre
brenicza, where more than 7,000
unarmed Bosnian men where apparently
massacred as U.N. troops stood by in the
immediate area.
Flawed though we may be, America is
the sole superpower and the reluctant
leader in international politics. When
America leads, the rest of the world fol
lows — bitching and moaning, but follow
ing.
After four years of war, the European
Union and the United Nations had
accomplished absolutely nothing in
Bosnia, except the disarming of Bosnian
Muslims which allowed for a horrific
slaughter. Finally NATO (read U.S.
armed forces) stepped in, and the warring
parties have put down their weapons. It
took American men and women to end
the genocide in Bosnia. European leader
ship could not do it without us even in
their own backyard.
The world has proven to be equally inef
fective in its handling of the Central
African crisis. Two weeks ago, more than a
million refugees from Rwanda and Burun
di were trapped in Zaire, and the prospects
of mass starvation and ethnic violence
were very real. Clinton's simple gesture of
ordering 2,000 American troops to the
region has allowed many of these refugees
to escape toward home while aid is appar
ently now reaching its intended recipients.
It seems that even renegade warlords,
whether they're Bosnian Serbs or Tutsi

militia men, still fear the U.S. Army.
I do not mean to trivialize the lives of
American soldiers, especially considering
that I might end up one myself. No one
wants to send American troops anywhere,
but when we have the opportunity to save
so many lives, we have the obligation to
do so. I see more of a compelling Ameri
can interest in the prevention of genocide
than I do in supporting an autocratic
regime in Kuwait, even if oil is involved.
I seem to remember filling out a little
card a few years ago which offered my ser
vices to the Department of Defense
should it need me. Granted, I probably
won't get called off to Kinshasa or Banja
Luka, but the thought that I could gives
me enough incentive to read the World &
Nation section of The Daily every once in
a while.
The next time there's a draft, there
probably won't be a student deferment
program (perhaps the most unfair gov
ernment practice of the late 20th centu
ry), so Stanford students might actually
be called on to defend their nation's inter
ests. It's time we define what those inter
ests are. As a potential American soldier,
I'd rather be stationed in Sarajevo than
Riyhad.
