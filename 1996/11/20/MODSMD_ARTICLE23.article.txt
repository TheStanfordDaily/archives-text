Catholic chaplain defends Memorial Church's presence

THE FUTURE OF Memorial
Church as an integral part of the
life of Stanford University is of
great concern to me. While Roman
Catholics on campus, whom I serve as
chaplain, were not mentioned in the
various references to the users of
Memorial Church, we are the most reg
ular community calling it home for
worship. Neither Jewish nor liberal
Protestant, we fill the church at least
once a week and would do so more
often were it available.
Roman Catholics are a minority on
this campus, in that we are said to repre
sent just 25 percent of the student popu
lation, but the 1,400 or so of us who
gather weekly feel very grateful for
Memorial Church and its hospitality to
us.
I would hate to see this symbol of
religious inquiry and community ser-

vice, to say nothing of worship, be fully
secularized, bringing further marginal
ization of religious values and practice
on this campus. From my study, the
Stanfords did intend that religious
questions be asked and that opportuni
ties for remembering cultural and reli
gious roots be provided. Memorial
Church enables that for many, perhaps
even most, of the present members of
the University community.
David Wolitz's hope to "establish
principle and the character of the Uni
versity" as determining factors in mak
ing decisions will be welcome additions
to our present criteria. I fear, however,
if the search is honest, religion and
Memorial Church as a symbol of reli
gious value, inquiry, service and practice
will necessarily be at its heart.

David Wolitz responds:
I agree that Catholics are well
served by the presence of an ornate
church on campus, but I did not pro
pose that the church be torn down or
that religious services be forever disal
lowed in its confines.
My proposal is that Memorial
Church be turned over to whatever
University agency operates all of Stan
ford's other auditoriums and that stu
dent groups (religious or nonreligious)
be allowed to reserve or rent out the
space as they do other facilities. For
instance, Inter Varsity Christian Fel
lowship reserves a classroom in the
psychology building for large group
meetings, as do other nonreligious stu
dent groups. Presumably, under my
proposal, Roman Catholic groups
would be able to reserve the church
just as they do now.

The status quo is one in which a
couple of liberal Protestant denomina
tions (and perhaps Reform Judaism)
are positively supported by the Univer
sity.
The implication is that other reli
gious traditions, including Roman
Catholicism, do not deserve positive
University support. That is not a mes
sage that Stanford ought to be sending
out.
Many sociologists believe that reli
gious life flourishes in America precise
ly because there is no state church; I
would not be surprised if religious life
at Stanford were to blossom without a
University church.
I look forward to a day when every
religious group on campus has fair and
equal access to work, study and prayer
venues and when no religious group is
privileged over others.
