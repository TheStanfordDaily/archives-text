# The 						nightmare of anti-corporatism
## 
### 
I had vowed to remain silent through
out the gross injustices that I faced at the
whim of those anti-corporate "students,"
but no longer. Yes, that's right, those vir
tual plebeians actually attempted to
crease my ego with their poo-poo,
shenanigan-laced crusade.
Last night, I heard shouts outside my
window. I looked out, and it was a motley
crue of anti-corporate Enchanted Broccoli
Forest hippies smoking dope, calling my
name. That's right, they had finally come
for me. Before I could gain my composure
I was dragged to their headquarters
beneath Lake Lagunita, where there was
even more pot and beer.

"Take off those Nikes," their leader
commanded, but I refused. I stood strong.
"Are those Cheetos on your lips?" another
unruly stoner inquired.
And then, they started to move in for
the kill. A flogging, using whips made out
of a tofu-based leather substitute, was
about to render my derriere utterly unfit
for my premier in the Christmas edition
of Playgirl magazine.
Finally, I removed the Nikes to quell
the discontent. Unsatisfied, their leader
ordered me to remove my Eddie Bauer
khakis. "Please," I begged. "I have a fami
ly that loves me, and they would be
crushed to see me after this."
"They're probably all corporate
lawyers," their leader retorted, "and
they'll appreciate the medical tax write
off. So remove the dungarees, you corpo
rate swine," he spewed, totally callous in
the face of my begging, determined to

bash my TM attitude. There was bong
juice all over his lips.
And that's when it happened. They
saw the Hilfiger boxer shorts, with a
Bloomingdale's tag still attached. "RUSH
HIM!" A charge of "Braveheart" propor
tions ensued.
All I could see were fists, whips and
"DIE CORPORATE SCUM" banners
above me as I struggled against their
onslaught. And then — perhaps it was an
apparition, perhaps not — I saw Ross
Perot's head on a stake! NO!!!!
I had to muster the strength to fight
against these miscreants. Little did they
know that I was actually wearing Speedo
trunks underneath my boxers, a virtual
kryptonite against anti-corporate cannabis
eaters. I rose up, Speedos in hand and
watched them grow weak, sapped by the
power of the trunks, the symbol of all that
is good and just. Suddenly, Perot breathed

air again; yes, in fact, it was Nike Air. He
still has no chest, torso, legs, etc., but he's
alive and may be able to have his body
reconstructed by DuPont.
Maybe this was a dream, perhaps it
really happened. But one thing is for sure
— I have vowed to lead a crusade against
this class of hypocrite protesters who have
so altered my life.
Perhaps the Stanford bubble has
infested their minds, just like it did
Emanual P. Ride (a.k.a. "the masturba
tion guy," Class of *89). I felt like I must
voice my discontent, despite fear of retali
ation. I will dedicate the rest of my days to
blowing up large Jeep balloons without
the aid of an air pump and to teaching
young minds how to climb a plastic wall
and sign up for things.
Join me in my crusade.
