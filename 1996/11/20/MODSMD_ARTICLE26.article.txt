# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## Gearing up for Big Game: Just pick four of twelve 
### 
WHEN I TELL my grandchildren
about Big Game week, I'll tell
them stories of the utter insanity
that went along with Stanford's seven days
of school spirit. I'll tell them stories of
these wild and wacky days when pure zeal
for our alma mater reigned supreme. I'll
tell my grandchildren stories about how
the Stanford campus exploded in raw ener
gy and enthusiasm.
Too bad I'll be lying.
C'mon, people! It's Big Game week!
Rah, rah, sis boom bah! Stand up, sit down,
fight, fight, fight! Gooo Stanford! How
come the prospect of pummeling our grid
iron archrivals this Saturday invokes less
spirit than the opening of a certain neon
yellow burrito place?
OK, I know what you're thinking
"C'mon, Jeremy, this is isn't just gonna be
one of those 'hey, aren't Stanford students
apathetic' columns is it? I'm sick of reading
about that stuff and I keep meaning to stop
being apathetic, but I have classes and
midterms and ..."
Well, worry no more, gentle reader, I

have done the legwork for you. I have com
piled a surefire list of "Spirit-Inducing
Stanford Activities." If every person on
this campus chose at minimum four activ
ities from the list below to learn, love and
live, Stanford's "Spirit Quotient" will be
raised to the power of 10.
So, without further ado:
Wear Stanford paraphernalia —
Let's be honest, every one of us owns at
least two sweatshirts, a T-shirt and / or a
faux leather interview binder. Display that
Stanford seal like the corporate slut you
are and show some pride for our Universi
ty, our football team and its sportswear
producers.
Streak — That's right. Two words:
Naked. Naked running people. Naked run
ning people hollering and hooting (no pun
intended). Show some spirit. Show some
pride. Show some flesh.
Find the Band and scream — Yep,
the LSJUMB. They're silly, they're obnox
ious, but hey, if everyone screams and
dances and jumps at the right spot, they're
also ... fun. How about that?

Go to White Plaza and stay there —
Spend an hour in Da Plaza. Talk to friends,
read The Daily, throw an impromptu
protest. Check your mail about four times.
Read Link Magazine. If we all spent more
time walking to White Plaza and less time
walking through White Plaza, maybe we'd
all just get along.
Find a story about a football player
for Big Game — Put your Fred Savage
story in the closet and talk about that guy
who was in your dorm or poli sci class. "Oh,
yeah, me and No. 14 are tight, real tight.
His sister was friends with this girl who
hung out with this guy who lived down the
hall from me, and I once saw him doing a
problem set. Cool, huh?"
Make fun of Weenies — Hey, they're
dumb, get it? They go to Cal, and they're
Weenies! And they don't go to Stanford —
so they're double-dumb! And stupid. And
Weenies. You get the idea. Try it, it's fun.
Get to that Bonfire — This year's
Senior Class is the first class in a really,
really long time that won't be constantly
reminding you: "This sucks. You shoulda

seen it my freshman year. This sucks. It
was big my freshman year. And hot. Real
ly hot. Did I mention this sucks?" Who
cares if it sucks? Show some spirit and get
your butt down to Wilbur Field. It's not
that far away. And stomp on a tiger sala
mander for me if you see one.
Kiss someone — Kissing is a "spirit
inducing activity," so *uss away. Kiss your
RA, your TA, your FA, your AA, whoever.
What better way to share Big Game week?
Big Game, anyone? — If you bought
your tickets for 25 bucks last week, I'll see
you there. If you didn't buy your ticket at
last week's prices, hmm . .. well, I bet you
could all show your spirit collectively by
telling the University where to stick their
$50 tickets.
Go to Bloomingdaie's — It's new, it's
exciting . .. it's Bloomies! Right here in our
own mall. In Palo Alto! Golly gee, aren't
those "big brown bags" swell?
Steal some plywood — C'mon, every
body's doing it! Just think of what you
could build if you only had some plywood!
Tables, doors, clocks, partv decorations —

too bad you don't have any plywood ...
hey! I know where you could get some.
Big Game Gaieties — If you don't
have your ticket to Gaieties yet — get it.
With a cast, staff, crew and orchestra of
more than 100 students, Dean of Under
graduate Admissions James Montoya,
University President Gerhard Casper and
its annual post-show rallies in Memorial
Auditorium, Big Game Gaieties 1996
"Admission: Impossible" is Stanford spirit
at its best. Friday is all but sold out, but
there are still some seats available for
tonight and Thursday. Eight o'clock
sharp.
And, look, if you want to be apathetic,
be apathetic. But do it with spirit and
enthusiasm. Do it in White Plaza, or at Big
Game, or at Gaieties. Or naked. I don't
care, just do it. Make Big Game week some
thing worth remembering.
Or at least something worth forgetting.

mander for me if you see one.
Kiss someone — Kissing is a "spirit
inducing activity," so *uss away. Kiss your
RA, your TA, your FA, your AA, whoever.
What better way to share Big Game week?
Big Game, anyone? — If you bought
your tickets for 25 bucks last week, I'll see
you there. If you didn't buy your ticket at
last week's prices, hmm . .. well, I bet you
could all show your spirit collectively by
telling the University where to stick their
$50 tickets.
Go to Bloomingdaie's — It's new, it's
exciting . .. it's Bloomies! Right here in our
own mall. In Palo Alto! Golly gee, aren't
those "big brown bags" swell?
Steal some plywood — C'mon, every
body's doing it! Just think of what you
could build if you only had some plywood!
Tables, doors, clocks, partv decorations —

too bad you don't have any plywood ...
hey! I know where you could get some.
Big Game Gaieties — If you don't
have your ticket to Gaieties yet — get it.

"Admission: Impossible" is Stanford spirit
at its best. Friday is all but sold out, but
there are still some seats available for
tonight and Thursday. Eight o'clock
sharp.
And, look, if you want to be apathetic,
be apathetic. But do it with spirit and
enthusiasm. Do it in White Plaza, or at Big
Game, or at Gaieties. Or naked. I don't
care, just do it. Make Big Game week some
thing worth remembering.
Or at least something worth forgetting.
