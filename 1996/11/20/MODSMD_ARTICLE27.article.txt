## Skin-cell repair successful Investigators hope gene therapy can cure rare disease 
### Rollin Hu 
Stanford scientists have recent
ly made a breakthrough in the
treatment of lamellar ichthyosis
(LI), a rare inherited skin disease.
Using genetic engineering tech
niques, the researchers were suc
cessful in repairing skin cells
afflicted by the disease.
Primary investigator Paul
Khavari, an assistant professor of
dermatology at Stanford and chief
of the dermatology service at the
Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health
Care System, described his study
of the skin as "very diverse and, to
me, fascinating."
His laboratory has been able to
translate this fascination into a
great leap forward for cutaneous
gene therapy research and finding
a potential cure for LI.
Affecting about one person in
300,000, LI causes the skin to
resemble thick fish scales. The dis
ease currently has no known cure,
and according to Khavari, the only
available therapy can do nothing
more than relieve symptoms and
reduce discomfort.
Recently, a number of labs con
firmed that most LI patients had
defects in a gene normally respon
sible for the production of an
enzyme called keratinocyte transg
lutaminase (Tgasel). Research
linking one defective gene to the
disease prompted Khavari to begin
his own research on LI about a
year ago.
"Monogenic recessive skin dis
eases like LI ... are attractive pro
totype disease models for develop
ment," he said. "Our lab studies
gene regulatory processes involved
in epidermal differentiation, so this
study naturally attracted us to look
at human diseases."
With the identification of the
culprit gene, Khavari and his asso
ciates began their work by taking

small skin samples from LI
patients. These samples were
grown in culture and tested to
make sure that the Tgasel genes
were, in fact, defective.
The researchers then used
viruses, known as retroviruses, to
introduce, or deliver, normal genes
into the skin cells.
Through a complex series of
events, the viruses inject their
genetic contents — in this case, the
normal Tgasel gene — into the
host cell. Enzymes, such as reverse
transcriptase, then alter the viral
genes and splice them into the host

genome.
In essence, the viral contents
become part of the host cell genes,
the normal complement of human
DNA.
These newly altered cells were
cultured further, and Khavari's
team confirmed that the in vitro
gene alteration was successful.
Using advanced techniques, the
team then grafted these cells onto
immune-deficient mice which
"accept human skin grafts that
clinically and functionally recapit
ulate [reproduce] intact human
skin," said Khavari.

The mice with the corrected
cells grew normal human skin,
while mice with uncorrected grafts
grew flaky skin that mirrored the
symptoms of LI.
"This is, to my knowledge, the
first time anyone has successfully
corrected a genetic defect in skin,
albeit in a laboratory setting," said
Dermatology Prof. Alfred Lane.
The next step is to translate this
laboratory breakthrough into clini
cal therapy.
However, Khavari warned that
several obstacles still stand in the
way of making his research a med
ical miracle for LI sufferers.
"It is important to be cautiously
optimistic and to proceed in a sys
tematic, step-wise fashion," he
said.
One obstacle is that in order to
cure human LI patients perma
nently, not only the epidermal skin
cells but also the long-lived stem
cells which eventually differentiate
into all different types of skin cells
must be genetically altered. Cur
rently, there exists no proven
method for introducing foreign
genes into the hard-to-reach stem
cells.
Another obstacle is the possibil
ity that humans who have their
genes altered may mount an
immune response to Tgasel, which
the body could conceivably see as
foreign. "There is significant con
cern regarding immune reactions,"
said Khavari.
Despite these problems,
Khavari said, "I wouldn't speculate
that we will find therapies in the
near future, but in the long run, I
am optimistic."
Working along with Khavari at
Stanford were research fellow
Keith Choate and doctoral stu
dent Todd Kinsella, who worked
with Khavari to develop tech
niques for transferring genes to
skin cells.
