Q, Why do people snore ?
-
A t If you have problems with
â€¢ snoring, you're not alone.
About half of all American
adults snore occasionally, and
almost a quarter snore frequent
ly. This means it's not just some
thing in the water that causes
your roommate to snore so loud
ly: It's also probability. That and
the giant conspiracy covered up
by alien body snatchers who are
actually making the snoring
sounds to communicate with
each other while humans sleep.
Perhaps the alien-takeover
theory is a bit exaggerated, but
snoring can be a sign of more ter
restrial problems, such as sleep
apnea.
When you are awake, you
breathe in through your nose
and the air passes easily through
your throat down into your
lungs. A set of muscles in the
back of your throat is responsi
ble for holding it open so enough
air can get through.
When you sleep, however,
these muscles relax and the air
way in the back of your throat
shrinks. Usually, this constric
tion doesn't appreciably affect
breathing, but when it does, the
thunder starts.
The soft parts in the back of
the mouth, like the dangly
uvula-thing, vibrate against the
back of the throat when the
snorer breathes in. This can be
exacerbated by breathing
through the mouth, which caus

es the base of the tongue to shift
backward, further constricting
breathing.
Sleeping on your back can
also aggravate a snoring prob
lem by causing the mouth to
open during sleep. When you
sleep on your side, your body has
a natural reflex which opens the
nostril opposite the side you
sleep on and improves nasal
breathing. Sleeping on your back
prevents this from happening.
Even if you can deal with the
sound of sleeping in the same
room with Mount Vesuvius,
sometimes heavy snoring is
indicative of a more serious med
ical problem, such as sleep
apnea.
Sleep apnea is a potentially
dangerous condition where
breathing is stopped for more
than 10 seconds during sleep.
Obstructive sleep apnea occurs
when the breathing airway
becomes blocked off by the same
things that cause snoring but
the passage is completely
blocked while the lungs continue
to attempt breathing.
The apnea attack is usually
ended when the sufferer wakes
up for a short penod of time. The
sleeper usually doesn't remem
ber waking up, but the cumula
tive effects of waking hundreds
of times per night can lead to
excessive daytime sleepiness, the
chief symptom of obstructive
sleep apnea.
If you know someone who
snores frequently at night and is
inordinately tired all the time,
you might want to consult a doc
tor.
