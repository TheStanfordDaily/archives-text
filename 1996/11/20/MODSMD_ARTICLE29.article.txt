Fast, powerful and cheap

Today's demand for data-crunching has spurred
the development of an idea that was born in the com
puter labs at Stanford — a new line of faster and more
powerful computers.
Oregon's Sequent Computer Systems Inc. has
unveiled a new computer based on nonuniform mem
ory access (NUMA) technology. Computers based on
NUMA are not only faster and more powerful but also
cheaper.

NUMA technology enables microprocessors to access memory at a
much faster speed than ever before. The key feature of this process
is that it allows hundreds of microprocessors to link together within
a single machine.
The NUMA machine is able to link 252 of Intel Corp.'s fastest
Pentium Pro microprocessors, as compared to the 16 to 30 micro
processors found in the current system. The result is a six-fold
increase in speed from the current line of computers.
No more glasses

There may be a safe alternative to the chore of look
ing for your glasses or cleaning your contacts lenses.
Using a procedure approved last year by the Food
and Drug Administration, Acting Asst. Ophthalmolo
gy Prof. Edward Manche is correcting nearsightedness
by photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), a type of laser
treatment.
The treatment takes about 20 seconds and can be

conducted while the patient is fully awake. After giving the patient
anesthetic eyedrops, a layer of tissue thinner than a human hair is
removed.
"After the procedure ... 98 percent of the people see 20 / 40 or
better without glasses," Manche said in a statement. "Many patients
return to work within a day or two, experiencing only mild discom
fort."
Risks include corneal scarring that can result in glare and visual
halos.
Although the prospects for PRK are promising, Manche empha
sized that not everyone is a good candidate for the laser treatment.
Cancer death rates declining

The National Cancer Institute announced last
week that the national cancer death rate has declined
for the first time this decade.
In men, declines in lung, colorectal and prostate
cancer deaths greatly influenced the overall drop in
the death rate. Declines in breast, colorectal and gyne
cological cancer deaths in women contributed most to
the overall drop.
"It's something that many of us have expected

because of the earlier detection of many cancers and the better treat
ment of several different types of tumors," said Radiation Oncology
Prof. Martin Brown, director of the School of Medicine's Cancer Biol
ogy Department.
"But unfortunately, these benefits have been masked in the past
by rising death rates "from lung cancer," Brown said. "Fortunately,
this [lung cancer death rate] is stabilized, perhaps even decreasing so
we're beginning to see benefits of these advances of the past 10 years
or so."
In addition to advances in medicine, other factors have also played
significant roles. Tobacco prevention programs have been successful
in decreasing lung cancer death rates. Changes in diet may have con
tributed to declines in colorectal cancer mortality.
