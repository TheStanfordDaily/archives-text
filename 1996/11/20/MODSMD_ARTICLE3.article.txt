If the proposal for Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity is approved by the
Faculty Senate tomorrow, four new ma
jors in the interdisciplinary program could
be made available as early as next quarter.
"I'm very excited about the prospect of
it being up and running," said History
Prof. A 1 Camarillo, chair of the CSRE
steering committee.
Should the CSRE curriculum — 1 1/2
years in the making — gain senate ap
proval, Camarillo will serve as chair of the
new program. John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences, asked
him to fill the position at the end of the
summer.
In addition, Camarillo will also chair
the Chicano studies major this year. He
said he hopes to "provide an intellectually
rigorous and exciting curriculum that will
attract students interested in learning

more about race and ethnicity both in the
U.S. and in other societies around the
world."
CSRE is also a prime opportunity for
Stanford to formalize departments that
other universities already have, such as
Chicano studies and Asian American stud
ies, Camarillo said.
Hopefully, he added, CSRE will "estab
lish Stanford as a model for other univer
sities to consider in the next generation of
study and scholarship in these areas."
As part of this endeavor, plans are al
ready being discussed for a 1999 confer
ence on racial relations to be hosted by
Stanford.
"For society at large, the research com
ponent of CSRE stands to make a signifi
cant contribution to the studies of issues
of race and ethnicity," Camarillo said.
Camarillo has been intimately involved
in the develoDment of the CSRE curricu-
