# CSRE majors may start next quarter
## 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
If the proposal for Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity is approved by the
Faculty Senate tomorrow, four new ma
jors in the interdisciplinary program could
be made available as early as next quarter.
"I'm very excited about the prospect of
it being up and running," said History
Prof. A 1 Camarillo, chair of the CSRE
steering committee.
Should the CSRE curriculum — 1 1/2
years in the making — gain senate ap
proval, Camarillo will serve as chair of the
new program. John Shoven, dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences, asked
him to fill the position at the end of the
summer.
In addition, Camarillo will also chair
the Chicano studies major this year. He
said he hopes to "provide an intellectually
rigorous and exciting curriculum that will
attract students interested in learning

more about race and ethnicity both in the
U.S. and in other societies around the
world."
CSRE is also a prime opportunity for
Stanford to formalize departments that
other universities already have, such as
Chicano studies and Asian American stud
ies, Camarillo said.
Hopefully, he added, CSRE will "estab
lish Stanford as a model for other univer
sities to consider in the next generation of
study and scholarship in these areas."
As part of this endeavor, plans are al
ready being discussed for a 1999 confer
ence on racial relations to be hosted by
Stanford.
"For society at large, the research com
ponent of CSRE stands to make a signifi
cant contribution to the studies of issues
of race and ethnicity," Camarillo said.
Camarillo has been intimately involved
in the develoDment of the CSRE curricu-
lum and has conducted research in
the area for more than 20 years.
His most recent book is a compari
son of ethnic and racial minorities
in different American cities. How
ever, his specialty is Chicano histo
ry.
Meanwhile, History Prof. Gor
don Chang has agreed to chair the
Asian American studies major,
and Assoc. Education Prof. Tere

sa LaFromboise will chair the Na
tive American studies major.
Courses in Asian American
studies will focus on things such
as the "Asian-American experi
ence in relationship with the mi
nority experience in other coun
tries, the Asian diaspora" and
other issues such as the "south
ern Asian experience in different
countries," Chang said.
A search is currently under
way for a new African and Afro-
American Studies Program direc
tor. The former director, Horace
Porter, has served his full term

and will continue to teach in the
English Department and CSRE.
Morris Graves, director of the
Black Community Services Cen
ter, is serving as the interim di
rector until the search is com
plete.
Carolyn Wong, an Asian Amer
ican studies scholar hired last
spring through the Political Sci
ence Department, is expected to
arrive in January and begin
teaching courses on immigration
policy and Asian-American politi
cal activity, Chang said.
The search for a Chicano stud

ies scholar is still ongoing in the
Anthropology Department.
"We're getting inquiries all the
time from colleagues at other in
stitutions," Camarillo said.
"Higher education is paying at
tention to what is happening at
Stanford. This makes it all the
more important that we structure
an excellent program that will
serve as a model."
The senate will also discuss rec
ommendations from the Cultures,
Ideas and Values review committee
on both the freshman seminar pro
gram and the CIV program itself.
