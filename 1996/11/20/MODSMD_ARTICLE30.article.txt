# Estrogen increases bone density
## Study finds osteoporosis may be averted in some women 
### Jennifer Wang 
Stanford investigators have
found that postmenopausal
women may be able to protect
themselves from bone density loss
by undergoing e cf :ugen replace
ment therapy.
The Medical Center was one
of seven clinical centers around
the nation to take part in this
three-year community based
study. Called the Post
menopausal Estrogen / Pro
gestin Interventions (PEPI)
Trial, the study involved 875
women nationally between the
ages of 50 and 60.
The PEPI trial — reported
recently in the Journal of the
American Medical Association — is
the largest completed clinical trial
studying the skeletal effects of hor
mone replacement therapy in
women. Medicine Prof. Robert
Marcus led one of the largest of the
trials, with 147 women.
The PEPI trial consisted of five
different treatment arms. Women
were given either a placebo (sugar
control pill), estrogen alone or
estrogen with one of three proges
terone regimens. Researchers
assessed the effect of the treat
ments on the bone mineral density
at the hip and spine.
Estrogen and progesterone are
hormones naturally secreted by
the body. After menopause, the
levels of these hormones in the
body decrease dramatically.
The results of the study reveal a
beneficial effect of estrogen on
bone density.

"People who were taking place
bo lost about 3 percent of theii
bone density over the three year:
of the study," said Marcus
"Women who took estrogen had t
gain on average of 5 percent o
bone density at their spine ant
about 2.5 percent at their hip ovei
three years.
"Furthermore, 97 percent o
the women who were treated hac
no bone loss at the spine, and 91
percent of women treated had nc
bone loss at the hip," he said. "So i1

was very reassuring about the ben
eficial effect for conserving the
bone at the dose of estrogen that
was used."
Women placed on progesterone,
in addition to estrogen, during the
study did not show any advantage
in increased bone density com
pared to women who were placed
on estrogen alone.
"The other thing we learned
was that the addition of a progestin
had no effect whatsoever on the
response," Marcus said. "In terms
of the skeleton, the progestin was a
neutral event." •
Osteoporosis is the most com
mon disease resulting from loss of
bone density and most often
results in bone fractures. Bone
mineral density is a strong predic
tor of fracture risk.
Twenty percent of white women
over 50 years old have osteoporosis
in both the hip and spine. Result
ing in limited mobility, loss of inde
pendence and even death, frac

tures of the hip and spine can be
especially debilitating for women.
In general, as women age, the
prevalence of osteoporosis increas
es due to gradual loss of bone min
eral density.
However, as explamed by the
authors of the article, "In the
decade following menopause, most
women experience more rapid
bone loss than predicted by aging
alone. This accelerated bone loss is
attributed to estrogen loss result
ing from ovarian failure."
Estrogen loss results in an
increase in bone turnover rate —
the natural, constant breakdown
and rebuilding of bone.
Osteoblasts, cells normally
responsible for forming bone,
secrete substances called
cytokines. Osteoclasts are recruit
ed by the cytokines to break down
bone. Estrogen can limit the
amount of cytokines produced by
osteoblasts and therefore prevent
osteoclast recruitment.
