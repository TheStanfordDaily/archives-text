## Morrison content as he wraps up season Soccer player overcomes obstacles to become integral team member 
### Yi-Wyn Yen 
Erik Morrison's teammates rushed
toward him on Maloney Field, hug
ging him and slapping high fives.
The senior striker had just posted
his first home goal at the last Stan
ford men's soccer game of the season,
sealing a win for the Cardinal in over
time against Santa Clara.
"Making a big goal like that, it's
the best feeling in the world," Morri
son said. "I wish I could hold onto
that forever."
The regular season ended in a
Kodak moment for Morrison, who sat
out as a medical redshirt his fresh
man year and considered not playing
this year.
After playing two "not so great"
years, as Morrison described them,
the starting forward and wide mid
fielder improved his record of no
points from the 1995 season to three
goals and four assists in this cam
paign.
"The lad has had an impressive
season," coach Bobby Clark said.
Despite the Cardinal's successful
season that ended with a 10-4-4
record, Stanford was not selected for
the NCAA tournament. However,
Morrison plans on returning next
year to "make things happen around
the [opponent's] box" as he is still eli
gible to play another year under
NCAA regulations.
Clark described Morrison as a
"hard-nosed pickpocketer" who
roams the field, looking to take
advantage of opponents' "wallets."
"Erik's always thinking," Clark
said. "He doesn't wait for someone to
pass him the ball — he leads the
pass."

Sitting out freshman year was
"difficult to swallow" for Morrison,
who teammates and friends describe
as highly competitive. Soccer, a sport
Morrison started playing when he
"practically learned to walk," he said,
had always been his discipline.
Injuries kept Morrison off the
Stanford team for the 1993 season,
requiring him to rely on golf carts
and crutches to get around campus
for seven months. Morrison broke his
right ankle and tore ligaments before
the semifinals of the California state
championships his senior year in high
school.
When he returned to Stanford his
sophomore year, Morrison said he
suffered an all-time low on the field.
"My confidence just wasn't there,"
he said. "I stopped seeing myself as a
soccer player." It had been 18 months
since he had last dribbled a ball.
After struggling two years on a
wayward team, Morrison thought
about calling it quits. In the past two
years, the Cardinal team had the
worst record since 1977.
A new coach and a passion for soc
cer brought Morrison back this quar
ter.
Morrison described the past season
as incredible.
"We're really developing good
teamwork," said the 5-foot-8 player.
"My confidence is definitely back
up."
Morrison's confidence also moti
vated others.
"He's like a spark plug for the
team, a real leader," said fellow
senior midfielder Steve Kirschbaum.
At the beginning of games when
the team forms a huddle, Morrison
often makes pep speeches, said junior

midfielder Shan Gaw.
"He's got a lot of heart and desire,"
Gaw said. "A lot of us look to him for
example."
Morrison, who also answers to the
nickname "Emo," is known by friends
for his slapstick humor and witty
remarks off the field.
"He's a real funny guy because
he's always thinking he's smarter
than he really is," Gaw said with a
laugh.
The oldest of five kids, Morrison
grew up playing soccer in the back
yard of his Carmichael, Calif., home
with his three brothers. Morrison and
his youngest brother, Scooter, would
often double up against Lee, who is
on the under-18 national team and
Kent, who plays for Santa Clara.
Morrison's 6-year-old sister recently
scored 10 goals in the past six games
of her league.
Morrison's parents and siblings
have watched Morrison score every
time this season.
"They're sort of like my lucky
charm," he said. "They're the most
important thing I have."
Morrison, age 21, is majoring in
English. He said he would rather
learn about Ernest Hemingway and
Ralph Waldo Emerson than the
molecular structure of a sock.
In between coaching kids at the
Stanford Soccer Academy, waterski
ing and training for his own soccer
season this past summer, Morrison
voraciously read American classics
such as John Steinbeck's "East of

Eden" and Harriet Beecher Stowe's
"Uncle Tom's Cabin."
"I wish I started reading a lot ear
lier," Morrison said. "I get a lot out of
it."
When Morrison is not hanging out
with his Phi Delta Theta fraternity
brothers, practicing soccer or attend
ing classes, he plugs away as a data
processor at Meyer Library.
Not too keen about his current job,
Morrison said he may coach basket
ball for seventh-graders at a Menlo
Park school next quarter.
While Morrison dreamed of becom
ing a professional soccer player like
his hero George Best, who played for
Manchester United, his injuries
freshman year put things in perspec
tive.
"When I broke my ankle, it rede
fined a lot of [my goals]," Morrison
said. "The goal (to play professional
soccer) wasn't within my reach (any
more)."
Next year, Morrison plans either
to apply for a teacher's credential
through the Stanford Teaching Edu
cation Program or to coterm. After
Stanford, Morrison hopes to either
teach English and coach sports or
travel to Zimbabwe or South America
to "stretch his horizons."
Though undecided about academic
plans, Morrison has every attention
of coming back to play soccer next
year.
"It will be the last chance I get to
play a game I love at this high of a
level," he said.
