# Big Game
## It's time to show spirit 
### 
Conversation at Stanford concerning
football before its November winning
streak:
"So, are you going to the game?"
"Well, you know, I have a lot of work, and
our team really isn't doing that great, so prob
ably not."
Post-UCLA win conversation:
"So, are you going to the game?"
"Well, you know, I have a lot of work, but
our team is doing better now; it could be excit
ing. Can I get in free after halftime? Maybe I'll
just wait to catch the second half . .."
And the week prior to the 99th annual Big
Game:
"So, are you going to Big Game?"
"Well, you know, I have a lot of work, but
we have a chance to go to a bowl game, and it
might do me good to actually get off the Stan
ford campus. . .. Did you hear though that the
tickets are $50? Maybe I'll just sit up on Tight
wad Hill. .."

It is three days before Big Game, and Stan
ford has sold between 20,000 and 21,000 tick
ets. California has sold 42,000 tickets, bring
ing the total up to no more than 63,000 tick
ets, leaving almost 12,000 seats open in Cal's
Memorial Stadium.
What's happening here? Is it that Stanford
students are overburdened and have too
much work? Is it a growing apathy toward
football in general and dissatisfaction with
the Cardinal squad? Is it that tickets are way
overpriced?
All of the above. Of course Stanford stu
dents have too much work, of course there is
apathy, and of course the $50 tickets are too
expensive. But are any of these reasons good
enough to not attend Big Game?
Stanford has few true traditions. Yes, we
have a "tradition" of academic excellence and
a "tradition" of athletic teams that bring home
national titles — certainly things to be proud
of — but there are few Stanford events that
everyone actually goes to.
Big Game is different. Or at least it has
been. As freshmen and sophomores, current
Stanford seniors saw Big Games at home (in
1993) and at Cal (in 1994, when Stanford was
3-6-1 and Cal 3-7) in stadiums practically filled
to capacity. Last year the trend began to
change, as Big Game was played at home in
front of the smallest crowd since 1973. (That
was before most of us were even born!) And
judging by the numbers so far this year, things
don't look to be improving much.
But it's not too late. If you haven't already
bought season passes, you can still purchase
individual Big Game tickets at the Stanford
