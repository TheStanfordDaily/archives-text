# Men's hoops crushes China in exhibition
## Stanford grabs easy win, 103-60 
### Bobby Cuza Staff writer 
Brevin Knight made his sea
son debut and 20th-ranked
Stanford coasted to an easy 103-
60 victory over a Chinese profes
sional team last night in the
team's final preseason exhibi
tion game.
The senior point guard was
held out of last Tuesday's exhi
bition game against the German
22-and-under national team
because of tendinitis in his
knee, but the All-American
reported no lingering effects of
the injury after racking up 12
points and six assists in 18 min
utes of play.
"It felt good," Knight said.
"As long as there's no pain, [I'll]
keep pushing and try to get back
in shape."
Knight, who was named a
first-team preseason All-Ameri
can by The Associated Press last
Tuesday, looked like his old self
as he helped stake the Cardinal
to a 46-27 halftime lead. In one
first-half span of 3 minutes, he
tallied seven points, two steals
and an assist in helping ignite a
14-0 run that helped put the
game out of reach.
China August One, two-time
defending champions of the Chi
nese Professional League,
stayed close for about 10 min
utes before succumbing to a
clearly more talented Stanford
squad.

Sophomore center Tim Young
added 16 points and 14
rebounds for the Cardinal, who
also got 16 points from sopho
more shooting guard Kris
Weems. China's Liu Qiang led
all scorers with 18 points.
"We're still a little shaky, still
getting to know one another,"
Knight said. "But it's gonna
take time. It's gonna take us
probably our whole preseason to
really get in sync to where we'll
be running on all cylinders."
Head coach Mike Mont
gomery's squad now has less
than a week remaining before it
departs for Anchorage, Alaska,
to play in the Great Alaska
Shootout.
The Cardinal opens regular
season play a week from today
against North Carolina-Greens
boro, with tournament play con
tinuing through Saturday. The
eight-team field also includes
No. 8 Kentucky and No. 13
Syracuse, who will meet in the
first round.
For a Cardinal team that
returns just one starter from
last season and includes 11
freshmen and sophomores, that
means there's precious little
time for the young guys to ease
into things.
"Now it's about roles,"
Knight said. "Before, coming in,
it was about getting to know
each other. Now it's about peo
ple stepping up and filling cer
tain roles on the team."
