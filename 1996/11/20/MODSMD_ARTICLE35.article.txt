Matt Garlmghouse — Daily We
Tim Smith
The sophomore free safety proved he was deserving of his
first career start in last Saturday's triumph over Wash
ington State. Smith sported a 31-yard interception return
(the squad's longest of the year) to set up a Cardinal score
and laid a crushing block that sprung Troy Walters for a
75-yard score on a punt return. He also forced Cougar
quarterback Ryan Leaf to fumble and recorded six tack
les.


Ala* Ho — Daily fit#
Olympia Scott
Scott's presence in the paint guided No. 1 Stanford to a
key season-opening victory over No. 2 Alabama Against
two highly touted Tide post players, Scott scored 18
points and snared nine rebounds to lead the Cardinal in
both categories despite only plaving 21 minutes due to
foul trouble. While Scott shot 8-of-ll from the Held,
Alabama's posts combined to connect on just nine of 35
attempts.
