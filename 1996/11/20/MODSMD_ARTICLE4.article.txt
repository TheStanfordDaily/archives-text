# Funding opportunities deficient, students say
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Despite numerous fund-raising opportu
nities on campus, many student groups still
maintain that they suffer from a lack funds.
Danny Bressler, project director of the
Stanford Directory, discovered various
groups' thirst of funds after a recent request
for short-term labor.
"I sent an e-mail message to the [Office of
Student Activities] list of student group lead
ers asking for groups who were interested in
making money by delivering (Directories) to
departments," Bressler said. "I was just over
whelmed. In the first two or three days over
50 student groups contacted me."
Bressler's e-mail had not specified the
times he needed help or what he would pay
groups for the service.
"The thing that surprised me was that we
are not talking about milking phone calls or
writing letters, we're talking about lugging
heavy boxes around for a couple of days."
ASSU Financial Manager John Hall ac

knowledged that many groups have difficulty
finding funds.
"There are a lot of student groups that are
willing to work to raise money, but the op
portunities do not exist to meet all their
needs," Hall said.
Those organizations cannot be faulted for
their need for money, according to Inter
sorority Council President Lisa Rubin, a ju
nior.
"None of these organizations are profit
making organizations. Many are in difficult
financial situations because they see the ser
vices they provide as serving the Stanford
community and want to continue those ser
vices," she said.
ASSU President Bill Shen said he felt that
constant fund raising inhibited those ser
vices.
"We'd like to see student groups using
their membership in the areas that best ben
efit students — in their stated purpose. They
shouldn't be spending half of their members'
time [working for the Stanford
Fund] or doing other things to raise
money," Shen said.
The Stanford Fund is run by the
Development Office and pays stu
dent organizations for time that
their members donate. Students
working for the fund make tele
phone calls, write letters and per
form various other services to gen
erate alumni donations.
Despite the benefits students
extol, the fund is criticized for the
manner in which it assigns work op
portunities. While some student
groups receive all the hours they re
quest, many do not.
According to Chaparral Editor
Eugene Park, a senior, the fund fills
work opportunities on a first-come,
first-served basis.
"There is definitely a distribu
tion inequity," he added, saying the
Chaparral and many other groups
have oflen been denied slots.
Development Officer Brian Per
ronne disagreed.
"We're not telling anyone at this
point that we don't have space,"
Perronne said. "It has not been the
case where student groups have
been turned away."
He indicated that now, near the
end of the quarter, all scheduled
times had been assigned, but that
there would be numerous openings
next quarter.
"There is a very short waiting list

now," he added.
The two-year-old program was
created to expand Stanford's alum
ni giving base.
"This is a unique program to
Stanford," Perronne said. "To my
knowledge, there is no other univer
sity that lets student groups work
and earn such a generous sum."
Students who work for the fund
earn $20 per hour for their respec
tive organizations.
"When introduced, students
liked this program because it wasn't
politically tied. People wouldn't be
fighting about who would get the
money," Perronne said.
Last year, 76 different student
groups took advantage of the oppor
tunity. Forty-five groups have par
ticipated so far this year. Any regis
tered student group is eligible to
work for the fund.
The program's popularity lead
University President Gerhard
Casper and Provost Condoleezza
Rice to increase its budget.
"Last year, the president and the
provost allocated $150,000 for [the
Stanford Fund], and we used al
most all of it," Perronne said. "This
year, because of the success of the
Stanford Fund, the president in
creased that allocation to
$225,000."
The fund, however, is second to
the ASSU in total funds distributed
to student groups.
According to Hall, the ASSU al
locates more than $253,000 to stu
dent groups annually through its
program, community service and
publications boards.
