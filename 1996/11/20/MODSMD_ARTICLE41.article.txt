# Students schedule trip to Bosnia

Members of both Students Against Geno
cide and Miles to Go have planned a trip to
Eastern Europe during winter break in order
to provide some needed aid to war-torn towns
in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The trip will serve as a follow-up to a trip
members took last summer. On the four-week
trip, 12 students traveled to Bosnia to provide
medical aid, education and computer equip
ment to parts of the country still suffering the
consequences of war.
John Randazzo, Class of'9s, founded Miles
to Go in 1993 after returning from a trip to
Bosnia and finding the University hospital

willing to donate only recycled and outdated
medical supplies to the destroyed Bosnian
towns.
Last spring, SAGE launched the Bosnian
Student Empowerment Project in order to
"give the youth of Bosnia-Herzegovina a
means by which they could contact the outside
world while getting a new look into the world of
computers," according to coterminal student
Tin Gazivoda, an active member of the group.
Junior Melvina Cheung and sophomore Jes
sica Knape stayed with host families in Gra
canica and taught English to elementary
school students.
"It was a very positive experience," Cheung
said. "I think it was important because it was
the first time large numbers of Stanford stu

dents went into Bosnia."
Cheung added that the most revealing activ
ity was an exercise, "If I could . . ." in which 13-
to 14-year-old students wrote letters to Presi
dent Clinton.
"I hate Serbs, wish I could get rid of them,"
some of them wrote. With the hatred, however,
came a hope for support from — as well as a de
sire to escape to — America.
Along with their involvement in schools, the
participants got a firsthand glance at the ef
fects of the Bosnian-Serb war on refugees.
"The most rewarding part [of the trip] was
making lasting relationships with the people,"
said Knape. "I'll always remember what they
taught me about life — strength, courage and
living on."
