## New Stanford Store set to open doors tomorrow 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
Adding to the latest im
provements at Tresidder
Union, the Stanford Store
is scheduled to open its
doors for business tomor
row.
The Stanford Store is
run by Stanford Student
Enterprises, the ASSU's
branch of student-run
businesses which include

Sunday Flicks, Group Discounts and Lec
ture Notes.
According to senior Dan Coleman, the se
nior projects director for the ASSU, the
main goal of the store is to provide Stanford
clothing to students at reasonable prices.
Students receive a 15-percent discount on
any of the store's merchandise.
"Stanford clothes are only valuable be
cause through their actions students have
made the name valuable," said Coleman.
"It's only fair that students receive the ben
efits of this."
The store — which features sweatshirts,
shirts, glasses, mugs and other Stanford
merchandise — is an entirely student-run
and student-designed operation. Students
designed the store's layout, picked out store
merchandise, set up the computer systems
in the store and designed some store mer
chandise, according to Coleman.
Profits from the store will be used to sup
plement student services offered by the
ASSU and fund various student groups on
campus.
The Stanford Store will serve as the
headquarters for all student enterprises
businesses. Lecture notes, group discounts
and Flicks passes will be available at the

store's cashier desk.
The addition of Polio Rey to Tresidder
this year facilitated construction of the new
store, according to senior Marni Haugen,
project manager for the Stanford Store.
Opening the store "was a valuable opportu
nity with the remodeling in Tresidder going
on," Haugen said.
The shelves, fixtures and lighting in the
store were paid for with ASSU reserves and
Student Enterprises project money. The
University provided what is called the
"vanilla shell" — the walls, part of the ceil
ing and the sub-floor of the store. As the
landlord, the University provides the
"vanilla shell" for all of the businesses in
Tresidder.
The Stanford Store is drastically
changed from its previous incarnation as
the Cardinal Collection. The store has ex
panded its professional look and features a
tile entrance way, wooden floors and
shelves, which were designed to evoke the
tile and wood in some of the older buildings
in the Quad, according to Coleman. The
store shares a glass wall with Polio Rey.
ASSU Financial Manager John Hall,
who spent a year planning the Stanford
Store with the Tresidder Advisory Board,
said the Stanford Store is "the No. 1 initia
tive in the [ASSUI financial department
this year.
"This is the level of service that the
ASSU should provide to the campus," Hall
said.
"The University is very excited about the
Stanford Store and student-run enter
prise," said Dean of Students Marc Wais.
The store "adds a new dimension to retail
on campus."
The opening of the store creates new

competition in the campus cloth
ing business, which until now has
been dominated by the Bookstore.
The store "is competition, but
anything to make Tresidder more
exciting is very positive," said
Bookstore President and CEO
Peggy Mendelson.
However, according to Cole

man, the Bookstore has implied to
some of its suppliers, such as
Champion, Russell and Jansport,
that the Bookstore will not contin
ue to purchase their merchandise if
it is also sold to the Stanford Store.
Mendelson said this request is
common for businesses.
However, Wais said, "I believe
that healthy competition is good.
There is enough room on campus
for both the Bookstore and the
Stanford Store to succeed and
thrive."
