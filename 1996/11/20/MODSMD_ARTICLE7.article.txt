The homeboy's eyes penetrate the solace and com
fort of a vacant hallway. In another corner of the
room, a mariachi player will begin the musica short
ly. In between, a woman waits for her lover
The second floor of Tresidder Union is filled with
color, music and multilingual stones that transport
visitors into another world — perhaps familiar, per
haps far away.
More than 20 pieces of artwork, including a sub
mission from Asst. Art Prof. Enrique Chagoya, are
showcased at the exhibit, "Pla.ca.zo: Marcando Nues
tra Presencia en Stanford" — loosely translated as
"Making Our Presence Known at Stanford."
The art show, sponsored by El Centro Chicano,
iExpresion! and La Raza Staff Association, was de
signed in part to educate others about the diversity
of student experiences, while affirming the visual
presence of Chicano / Latino students at Stanford,
said iExpresidn! Co-editor Maribel Ledezma, a ju
nior.
"Walking into Tresidder and seeing the artwork
I've admired for so long up in the [showl cases recon
firms that Chicanos and the greater Latino commu
nity have arrived in full force," Ledezma said in a
program note.
Chagoya, who described his monotype submission
as "shaman art," said he hopes the exhibit will serve
as a bridge between the Chicano / Latino community
and the rest of the communities at large
Similarly, Ledezma hopes the average Stanford
student will begin to recognize the names of the stu
dents whose works are on display, many of whom
were "closeted" artists, she said. Additionally, she
wants others to become aware of art in genercd and
Chicano / Latino art forms in particular.
"Chicanos at Stanford, for the most part, are
seen as protesting or staging rallies, but our works
do not necessarily have to be political," she said.
"We are proud to exhibit our art, even in a very
forthright way."
As the title of the exhibit sug
gests, the work on display is as
syncretic and diverse as the stu
dents who submitted. The term
placazo is colloquial, urbanized
Spanish derived from placa, the
graffiti form of tagging one's
name.
"When you see placazos in the
city, you can't look away," Ledez
ma said. "I hope that the exhibit in
Tresidder will have the same ef
fect."
While Latino themes dominate

the works showcased, studio art
major Tracy Alvarez, a senior, said
it is "eye-opening" to see the vari
ety in which a cultural genre of
work has been personalized.
"Just because you're a Latino
artist doesn't mean that the art
has to deal specifically with Latino
issues," she said. "Ethnicized art
may be a limitation; yet, then
again, it may open a whole world
of subject matter that one may not
have dealt with."
A world familiar or a world far
away, art is a means to "touch
bases with who we are," Chagoya
said.

The exhibit will remain on display
through the end of November.
