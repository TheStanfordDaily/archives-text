This Thanksgiving Break,
Keep Your Belongings Secure.
Bikes/Scooters:
• Lock your bicycle in your room while you're away to prevent theft.
Bikes are not allowed in stairwells or hallways at any time.
• Lock your scooter outside to a stationary object.
Storage of gas powered vehicles in the student residences is not permitted
Autos:
• Remove all valuable from your car.
Expensive stereos should be removed from view.
• Park your car in a secure, well lighted area.
• Consider buying a car cover with a security cable and lock.
Thieves will be delayed trying to remove it, thus deterred from burglarizing your car. Paint your license
number on the car cover. A car alarm is also a sound investment.
Rooms:
• Lock your doors and windows.
Keep shades and curtains closed. Unplug electrical appliances to reduce fire hazards and save energy.
• Hide extremely valuable items from view
e.g. jewelry, cash, computers.
