Last weekend, I went out of town When the plane landed and
everyone was standing and pulling out their stuff from the over
head bins, the guy who'd been across the aisle from me start
ed eating Chiclets. I guess the women behind him were eyeing
them because he offered them some and said, "There's noth
ing like a Chiclet upon landing." Then he added, "It helps you
get through the whole collecting-your-baggage, finding-your
car process. And before you know it, you're back at your
house." I had slept for the entire plane flight, but when I heard
him make these remarks, I wished I'd spend the flight talking
io him. I think he might have been my soulmate. Send your
classies to intermission ©daily so you, too, aren't riddled with
regret. (The next issue will be the last before winter break —
get it all out now and start the new year a cleansed and better
person.)
