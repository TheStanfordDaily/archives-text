## 
### Connie Chang Contributing writer 
Due to ongoing restructuring of the Uni
versity's administrative staff, the position
of vice president for faculty and staff ser
vices is being eliminated. Current Vice
President Barbara Butterfield is set to
leave her post Jan. 1.
According to University Communica
tions Director Terry Shepard, the reorga
nization is being made in order to mold the
staff into a more rational and efficient
form.
"We decided that Faculty and Staff Ser
vices . . . deserved a new look, and we will
be reassigning units from that area," Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper said in a
statement.
The various units that were under But
terfield's charge "have found better homes
elsewhere," said Shepard.
Personnel Services and Total Compen
sation will now report to the chief financial
officer, while Faculty and Staff Housing
will report to the provost. A new Office of
Campus Relations will consolidate several
other functions including the Help Center
and the Work-Life Center, both of which
fell under Butterfield's jurisdiction.

Casper commended Butterfield's contri
bution to the University. "Barbara has
done a great number of very good things for
Stanford, and the University has much
benefited from her work," he said. "She is
mature and knowledgeable in her field, and
I will be pleased to recommend her to any
one."
Joanne Moberly, executive assistant to
Butterfield, had nothing but praise for the
vice president. "I love working for her,"
Moberly said. "She is a great boss and a ter
rific mentor."
One of Butterfield's original duties as
vice president was to help with Stanford's
restructuring and budget-balancing.
Butterfield came to Stanford in 1991
when there were nine vice presidents.
There are now three.
"Gerhard (Casper) has done a nice job of
moving to a leaner organization," Butter
field said. "Stanford's faculty and staff are
now more focused than ever on the acade
mic mission."
"Stanford is an absolutely terrific uni
versity. I came here because I believed in its
greatness," she said. "Five and a half years
later, I hope and believe it is even stronger,
and I will leave with great respect for my
colleagues, the institution and its people."
