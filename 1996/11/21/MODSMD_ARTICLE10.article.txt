## Contraceptives' effectiveness doubted by FDA 
### 
GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) — The government
is casting doubt on how well decades-old contracep
tive foams and gels actually prevent pregnancy. Hut
scientific advisers said yesterday the spermicides do
appear to reduce women's risk of catching the com
mon sexual diseases of gonorrhea and chlamydia.
The advisers to the Food and Drug Administration
said yesterday that the spermicides appear to pre
vent some sexually transmitted diseases despite
growing concern that women who use them might
actually increase their risk of catching the AIDS
virus.
On the contraceptive issue, the FDA's Dr. Lisa
Rarick said: "It's scary to think there are products
out there with failures in the 40 to 50 percent range.
Women should know how well these products work "
Some women already have begun using spermi
cides for disease protection when a partner won't use
a condom. And researchers are now trying to see if
and just how the foams and gels actually prevent or
combat disease.
Nonoxynol-9, the chief spermicide ingredient,
appears to kill sexually transmitted bacteria that
cause gonorrhea and chlamydia. A study of 818
women who attended disease clinics in Birmingham,
Ala., in the 1980s found those who used spermicides
lowered their risk of catching those two diseases by
21 percent to 25 percent.
The FDA advisers, on an 18-1 vote, said
Nonoxynol does appear effective against gonorrhea
and chlamydia. But, citing theories that couples
would be less likely to use condoms — the gold stan
dard for disease protection — they were much more
divided on whether to actually recommend them as a
safeguard against disease.
The committee emphasized that the spermicides
must be labeled to clearly tell women that condoms
remain the best preventative to sexually transmitted
diseases, and that protection against gonorrhea and
chlamydia does not equal protection against HIV.
