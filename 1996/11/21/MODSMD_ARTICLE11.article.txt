# Bernardin hailed
## Cardinal celebrated at funeral Mass 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin, the son of Italian immi
grants who rose to become the nation's
senior Catholic Church official, was
mourned yesterday as a man who used
his own graceful death as his last ser
mon.
His funeral Mass, before 1,300
friends, religious leaders and politicians,
followed two days of mourning by tens
of thousands of people who filed past the

casket at Holy Name Cathe
dral.
"The homily of this Mass
has been given over the
months of his illness," Mon
signor Ken Velo told mourners.
"Didn't he teach us? Didn't he
show us the way?"
Bernardin, the senior
Roman Catholic prelate in the
United States and leader of

Chicago's 2.3 million
Catholics, died last week after a 17-
month bout with pancreatic cancer. He
spent his final months telling his follow
ers he was at peace with his fate and his
beliefs.
Just days before his death, he wrote
to the U.S. Supreme Court, urging it not
to allow doctor-assisted suicide. In
September, Bernardin also went to the
cell of a death-row inmate who asked to
pray with him before being executed.
During his homily, Velo said
Bernardin's greatest legacy was as a
man who bridged the differences of race,
politics and religion, weighing in as a
mediator on emotional issues ranging
from nuclear war to AIDS education and
prejudice.

His last major undertaking was the
Catholic Common Ground Project to
open dialogue with Catholics who dis
sent from church teachings on issues
such as birth control, celibacy of priests
and ordination of women.
"He wanted to make common ground
holy ground," Velo said to wide applause
from an audience that included Vice
President A 1 Gore, Gov. Jim Edgar, and
Mayor Richard M Daley. "He brought

] people together. He worked hard to
}do that."
Bernardin rose rapidly in the
j church and came to Chicago in 1982
from Cincinnati. He succeeded Car
dinal John Cody, whose firm,
authoritative reign over the arch
diocese had been tainted by a feder
al probe of suspected misuse of
church funds
During his tenure Bernardin

gained the respect and admiration
of those of many faiths.
Hundreds stood in the fall chill as the
funeral procession wound its way
through Chicago's West Side to Mount
Carmel Cemetery in suburban Hillside,
where other lute cardinals of the arch
diocese also have been laid to rest.
Snow fell on mourners who gathered
near a mausoleum to pay final respects.
"He was an inspiration to people with
cancer," said Neil Meccia, 67, who suf
fers from prostate cancer.
"Cardinal Bernardin was many
things to people, but he was teacher. He
taught the lessons of life," Velo said. "In
this darkened cathedral and darkened
archdiocese, he brought life and light
that continues this day."
