Trade deficit grows
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. trade deficit widened to $11.3 bil
lion in September, the second-worst showing on record, as oil imports
surged and heavy demand for toys and Christmas decorations kept
America's deficit with China at an all-time high.
The deficit in goods and services was up 10.1 percent from a revised
August imbalance of $10.3 billion and was the worst showing since an
all-time high of $11.6 billion in July.
For the second straight month and third time this year, America's
deficit with China exceeded the imbalance with Japan. The September
deficit with China was a record $4.7 billion, up 0.4 percent from August.
Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor said the imbalance underscored
the need for China to do more to lower trade barriers that are keeping
out U.S. exports.
So far this year, the U.S. trade deficit is running at an annual rate of
$114 billion, even worse than last year's imbalance of $105.1 billion.

Plane crashes in Illinois
QUINCY, 111. (AP) — Investigators removed 14 bodies and the cock
pit recorder yesterday from the wreckage of a fiery runway crash that
has raised safety questions about hundreds of U.S. airports with no con
trol tower to guide pilots.
The charred bodies were left on the runway of Baldwin Municipal
Airport overnight and removed after investigators examined the wreck
age of Tuesday's collision between a United Express commuter plane
and a small private plane.
Clues to what caused the accident could come from the cockpit voice
recorder taken from the commuter plane. Unlike a jetliner, it had no
flight data recorder. The private plane had neither.
The United Express Beech 1900 from Burlington, lowa, carrying two
crew members and 10 passengers, had just landed when it collided with
the smaller plane talcing off with two people. The crash came at the
intersection of two runways at about 5 p.m.

Clinton visits Australia
SYDNEY, Australia (AP > — After winning a standing ovation in Aus
tralia's Parliament, President Clinton pivoted from business to plea
sure, taking his wife on a moonlit harbor cruise before rising early today
to prepare for a golf match with PGA pro Greg Norman.
The president, in running pants and T-shirt, jogged in the Royal
Botanic Gardens along the waterfront. He said the exercise was part of
his preparations for the long-awaited game with the Australian golfing
legend.
Still in jogging clothes, the president also took an impromptu tour of
the famed Sydney Opera House, a white clam shell-like building on the
harbor. He surprised a lone watchman, the only person on hand to give
Clinton a tour until an opera house official hurriedly rushed in to take
over.
The president also was to address the people of Sydney before flying
to northern Australia for a visit to the Great Barrier Reef tomorrow.
