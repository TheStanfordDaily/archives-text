Though rather harmless,
tour failed to represent
health and fitness issues

DRIVE A JEEP Cherokee™,
you'll look and feel like a
rugged outdoor enthusiast.
Drink "all natural" Clearly Cana
dian™, the water for folks who love
the outdoors. And keep that
healthy, tanned look all year long
with Hawaiian Tropic lotion™.
It seems absurd that a Stanford
student would purchase these
products solely for the reason
someone tells them it will make
them healthier — or at least look
that way But last week, when the
Office of Student Activities allowed
the Collegiate Health and Fitness
Tour to roll into White Plaza, the
message of health and wellness got
muddled behind the opaque win
dow of corporate promotions.
Though Cowell Student Health
Center was involved in organizing
the event, the vast majority of the
space was allocated to corporate
sponsors such as Details — a fash
ion magazine — and the Discover
Card, both whose connection to
health issues is tenuous, at best.
Indeed, walking through the maze
of booths, kiosks and inflatable
props, one wonders what many of
the products on display had to do
with health and fitness at all.
Advertisers continuously bom
bard the public with images of
what it hopes people will see them
selves as when they purchase their
product. That image is often con
formist and unrealistic. It is doubt
ful that an African American, Chi
cano or poor white from the inner
city has ever experienced, much
less afforded, a rock-climbing expe
dition or ski trip to the Sierras. It
would be interesting to see how
many times this traveling exhibit
of wellness stopped at community
colleges or other ostensibly less
affluent schools.
It is disappointing, then, that
Stanford administrators, suppos

edly dedicated to the ideals of
diversity and to promoting the
mental and physical health of its
students, did not investigate and
better plan the event. Perhaps if
Student Activities had allowed
more student organization tables,
it could have avoided the charges
made by some that the fair was
mainly held for the benefit of cor
porations to promote their agen
das.
Yet for all the flack the office is
getting for allowing the corpora
tized health fair to happen, its goal
of bringing events and promotions
to campus is laudable. Most stu
dents will probably not succumb to
the promotional gimmicks. It is
highly doubtful that someone will
demand a shiny new Jeep from
their parents because they were
convinced at this fair the jeep will
make them look better. In any case,
the promotional products did not
cost students anything, aside from
the inconvenience of congestion in
White Plaza.
Additionally, it should be point
ed out that Stanford received no
money for helping organize the
event. Unfortunately, administra
tors had to suffer the embarrass
ment of a student protest to see
that there is never a "free lunch"
where corporate sponsors are con
cerned.
But if the goal of the Office of
Student Activities was to bring in
groups to talk about health and fit
ness, then it should have coordi
nated the event with a multitude of
other campus groups, such as the
Women's Center. For example, the
giant balloon of a condom should
have had someone from Cowell's
Health Promotion Services Unit
present to talk to students about
safer sex or abstinence.
Students at Stanford deserve
better than a glitzy, pre-packaged
sales pitch on what corporate
America believes students should
look, smell and feel like. The Uni
versity must do better in the future
to limit these types of overmer
chandised exhibitions.
