## Everything's coming up roses 
### 
What we all need to keep in mind
is that Stanford is a wonderful
place. Fiscally, academically,
philosophically, hell, even personally,
there is a tremendous wealth of oppor
tunities here. Where else but Stanford
do you not have to worry about food, get
to live with your friends (if you have
any), get free movie rentals from
Meyer, look through people's diaries
from long ago (in Hoover Institution),
play golf for credit toward getting a
good job in the future, swim at any time
of day (if you play your cards right) or
speak to a Nobel Prize-winning scien
tist or other artist? At other large pres
tigious colleges, actually. But that isn't
my point.
Those of you who are not aware of
how great a place you are in physically
and emotionally, WAKE UP. Take your
flat butt off of the chair in the 24-hour
study room, unglue your eyes from your
computer screens, stop ogling the
woman with the large breasts next door
and smell the air outside of your win
dow. Yes, it smells like skunk. But it's
Stanford skunk. Appreciate it now
while you can still reel in disgust. Flee
in gleeful fear of the scary black squir
rels while you can still use your arms or
legs or whatever you use to flee. We are
young and learning. Let's appreciate it!
I am not just talking to the undergrad
uates, either. Even if you are not young,
you are younger than you could be.
Enjoy your body, enjoy your senses,
enjoy the situation you are in. You don't

have to like everything, but at least try
to experience everything that is here to
the fullest that you possibly can. Even
cold, wet jeans can be appreciated.
I understand the desire to whine and
complain. I am certainly one of the
biggest offenders when it comes to not
appreciating things. Though I refuse to
set foot in the 24-hour study room
except to use the phone, I easily spend
20 hours per week writing e-mail. I
have friends across the country, that's
why.
But really that's no excuse. I am
probably one of the biggest complainers
I know. But I complain while I keep in
mind how lucky and fortunate I am. I
complain a lot partially because it's an
easier form of conversation. Imagine
what it would be like if we all went
around talking about how wonderful
things are. Conversation would sure be
limited.
"Hi, Stacey!"
"Hi, Nkomo!"
"It sure is wonderful!"
"It sure is!"
And then the conversation would be
over. Whining about things is a high
art. And even with all of our practice,
there are only a select few who of us can
actually do it very creatively and well.
It's a fun thing to practice. But let's all
try to keep in mind that we really are
lucky.
No matter if you think you got in
here because you worked really hard in
high school. So what. There are a lot of

people who worked hard in high school.
Some of them are here, most of them
are not. Some of them are at other col
leges, some of them are not. Some of
them are alive, some of them are not.
Look what you have going for you. If
you play your cards right, I bet you
could eat dinner at the White House.
Why? Because you are where you are.
And somebody here has got to know the
president. If you REALLY play your
cards right, you could even eat dinner
with me.
But seriously folks, we have our own
television station (which deserves a spe
cial fee), our own radio station (which
also deserves a special fee), our own
auditorium, our own newspaper, our
own FREE e-mail system, access to
Lexis Nexis, we can take out 999 books
per quarter, we can go to FREE poetry
and short-story readings, we get to sit a
few hundred feet from Ross Perot,
Jesse Jackson or Wynton Marsalis, we
get free stuff all of the time, people
come beg us to work for them all of the
time, we can get almost any internship
in Washington, baby grand pianos
galore, horses, mosquitoes, gnats ... do
I need to say any more?

Actually, Nkomo thought that THE
comic was pretty durn funny.
