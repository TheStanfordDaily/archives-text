Film at Stanford: No lights, no camera, no action

I'M WRITING IN response to Hugh
Handeyside's article in Monday's
Daily about Stanford's rich history
in film and motion pictures. The article
was well-researched and well-written,
bringing to light many points about
Stanford's film history, of which most
students, presumably, would not other
wise have been aware.
However, I felt compelled to respond
to the statement that Stanford's "own
contribution to the film industry is
surprisingly substantial." Despite the
facts and examples given in the article,
this statement simply isn't true.
Let me tell you about the opportuni
ties in film here at Stanford.
First off, it would be a lie to say that
there are no film classes at Stanford. If
you're out to fill the gender require
ment, for instance, there are certainly
a variety of film classes to choose from
— "Women in Italian Cinema" and
"Images of Women in French Cinema,"
to name, well, all of them.
Interested in documentaries? Try
taking "Documentary Film" — only

you'll have to wait until the 1998-99
school year, when it's being offered
again. Or, if you really are interested
in actually making movies, try out
Stanford's one true film class (aptly
disguised as "Introduction to the Mov
ing Image"). You might just get the
chance to make your own student
video (note the distinction between
video and film) by the end of your
Stanford career.
There are, of course, other classes,
but their net value is debatable.
Of course, there's always the Stan
ford Film Society, but for an organiza
tion that ought to have enormous
weight and influence, it seems to be
viewed as something just above a cult.
The simple fact of the matter is that
Stanford has no film program, which is
absurd for a top-notch California
school. The film industry is currently
cornered by graduates of USC and New
York University, and it's not because
there aren't students with skill and
imagination willing to throw them
selves into the business; it's because

universities like Stanford refuse to give
the program a shot.
Additionally, with the enormous
advantage that our school has in tech
nology and computing, we are in a bet
ter position than anybody else to revo
lutionize the film industry with 21st
century technology and ideas. The mar
ket for the futurization of film is enor
mous, both inside and behind the cam
era, yet very few people at this school
know enough about film to really get
involved. It's Stanford students, not
USC students, who have the capacity to
fully computerize and "futurize" an
otherwise low-tech industry, but we're
not even trying to get into the field.
I'm not saying we need to run out
and establish a film school right away,
but we don't even have a film major.
Considering Stanford's ability to
attract first-rate students and faculty,
we would easily become the No. 2
school for film graduates in the West
ern United States (second only to the
USC), if we became involved with
motion pictures. Stanford students are

creative, energetic and willing to learn,
and there is so much more to movie
making and film-production than how
to be an extra in "Flubber."
Is our lack of program in film mere
ly an oversight, or does Stanford really
not want the liberal arts to infiltrate
its predominantly techie campus? If
it's a lack of interest that administra
tors are worried about, then they don't
know their students as well as they
think they do, for there is a very large
student population that would love to
become more involved. But if it's sim
ply University apathy — if it's just the
attitude that Stanford is "not a film
school" and shouldn't try to be — then
we are merely going to keep our backs
up against a door that is begging to
opened. Until someone decides to do
something about bringing our school
into this field of tremendous potential,
our involvement in the art and science
of film is going to have to stay limited
to Sunday Flicks.
