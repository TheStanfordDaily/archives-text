# SMOC founder dares Bookstore president to prove her claims
## 
### 
They're lying! If you have ever shopped
at the Stanford Bookstore, you have been
cheated.
Rebates here, rebates there, totaling at
most $500,000. However, the Bookstore,
according to the Stop Monopolies on Cam
pus' preliminary research, earns several
million dollars profit after ALL costs
(merchandise and employee). Former sec
retary / treasurer of the board of direc
tors, Robert Weisberg, told the Faculty

Senate in 1992 that the profits were "sev
eral million." Where are the profits going?
Is the Bookstore buying company cars
again? Vacation homes in Taboe? Subsi
dizing off-campus stores which are losing
money?
Regarding Bookstore President and
CEO Peggy Mendelson's reference to my
pencil sharpener example: SMOC under
stands Costco may buy millions thus get
ting a lower price; however, why doesn't
the Bookstore just buy the merchandise
from Costco at $17.95 and then sell it to
us at less than $34.95?
Regarding Bookstore Director of Oper
ations Ken Shark's reference to high pub
lisher costs forcing higher textbook prices:
The prices are suggested retail prices.

This solves the paradox of how Wal-Mart
can charge a lower price than Borders' for
the same book. Thus, the Bookstore
DOES have some pricing choice. Further
more, since when does the Bookstore
make an adequate attempt to speak to
professors concerning ordering the proper
amount of designated texts? We know the
truth, Mr. Shark, don't try to fool us!
Mendelson also mentioned the board of
directors, which according to SMOC's pre
liminary research, is actually a communi
ty board. However, SMOC dares the
Bookstore to tell us how many students
are actually on the board? I'll give every
one a clue, the amount of students DOES
NOT mirror the actual community it is
serving.

Mendelson seemed to have
implied that rent was a mqjor reason for
current prices. Ms. Mendelson, SMOC
knows the Bookstore only pays approxi
mately $45,000 a year until 2000 (when
its lease is up for renewal). Is this too high
or too low? Well, Tresidder Express pays
$120,000. In 1992, The Daily figured out
the Bookstore should be paying some
where in the range of $3 million.
SMOC will not allow the Bookstore to
fool us anymore. The status quo is no
longer acceptable! Ms. Mendelson, prove
SMOC wrong â€” show us your financial
records. We dare you!
