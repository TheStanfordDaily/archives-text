# Activist argues against use of death penalty
## Rose-Avila says violence, capital punishment related 
### Dan Downey 
A crowd of about 25 gathered last night
at the Bechtel International Center to hear
Magdaleno Rose-Avila, executive director
of the C6sar Chavez Foundation, and two
current gang members debate the relation
ship between capital punishment and vio
lence.
A resident of El Salvador, Rose-Avila is
an established member of the movement
against capital punishment and is actively
involved in the rehabilitation of former
gang members.
In his speech, sponsored by the Palo Alto
and Stanford branches of Amnesty Inter
national, Rose-Avila maintained that capi
tal punishment is the product of a troubled
society.
"Our society teaches violence — an eye for
an eye, a tooth for a tooth — that's why we
have capital punishment in our society," he
said.
Vengeance was a consistent theme
throughout the speech. Rose-Avila offered
the example of Guatemala, a country he
said had a very poor human rights record.
He alluded to a recent incident in which the
Guatemalan government televised a brutal
execution of two violent criminals.

Rose-Avila argued that capital punish
ment not only signifies a violent culture
but perpetuates violence.
"Any psychologist or counselor can tell
you that the only way to deal with the loss
of a loved one is to focus on that person," he
said. "Turning your anger on others is self
defeating; violence consumes you."
Rose-Avila went on to say that the death
penalty is not about solving crime but
about creating scapegoats.
"Whether it's through judicial or extra
judicial executions, governments always
create someone for us to hate," he said.
Rose-Avila added that for this reason, he
finds widespread political support for the
death penalty to be hypocritical. "Most politi
cians in the U.S. are not really for capital pun
ishment, but they say they are to get elected."
For example, Rose-Avila said, President
Clinton catalogued all the ways in which he
had worked to promote the death penalty
during a speech at the Democratic Nation
al Convention in August.
Following Rose-Avila's speech, two gang
members who asked to be identified as
"Jose" and "Maria" described their involve
ment in gang warfare. Both are current
members of the two biggest Lati
no gangs in Southern California,
Eighteenth Street and Mara
Salua Trucha. They both spoke
through a translator.
Each gang has branches in El
Salvador, where Jose and Maria
were born and first became in
volved in gangs.
Maria, like Rose-Avila, blamed
a violent society for creating gang
warfare in El Salvador.
"People grow up with violence
between guerrillas and the army,"
she said. "Gangs offer the youth a
way to survive in this culture of vi
olence."

Unfortunately, she added, the
older generation does not see the
dilemma facing young El Salvado
rans — the youth are referred to
as "the plague."
"The government established
the death penalty in El Salvador
as a way to eliminate the youth,"
Maria said.
The meeting closed with Rose-
Avila anticipating the future of
the anti-death penalty movement.
He compared it to other difficult
causes, such as the civil rights
movement and the Vietnam War
protests.
He said the common thread in
these movements was that, "be
fore you win, and even when
you're winning, it seems that
you're losing."
