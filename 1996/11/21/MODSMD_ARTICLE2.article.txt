## Rose-Avila says violence, capital punishment related 
### Dan Downey 
A crowd of about 25 gathered last night
at the Bechtel International Center to hear
Magdaleno Rose-Avila, executive director
of the C6sar Chavez Foundation, and two
current gang members debate the relation
ship between capital punishment and vio
lence.
A resident of El Salvador, Rose-Avila is
an established member of the movement
against capital punishment and is actively
involved in the rehabilitation of former
gang members.
In his speech, sponsored by the Palo Alto
and Stanford branches of Amnesty Inter
national, Rose-Avila maintained that capi
tal punishment is the product of a troubled
society.
"Our society teaches violence — an eye for
an eye, a tooth for a tooth — that's why we
have capital punishment in our society," he
said.
Vengeance was a consistent theme
throughout the speech. Rose-Avila offered
the example of Guatemala, a country he
said had a very poor human rights record.
He alluded to a recent incident in which the
Guatemalan government televised a brutal
execution of two violent criminals.

Rose-Avila argued that capital punish
ment not only signifies a violent culture
but perpetuates violence.
"Any psychologist or counselor can tell
you that the only way to deal with the loss
of a loved one is to focus on that person," he
said. "Turning your anger on others is self
defeating; violence consumes you."
Rose-Avila went on to say that the death
penalty is not about solving crime but
about creating scapegoats.
"Whether it's through judicial or extra
judicial executions, governments always
create someone for us to hate," he said.
Rose-Avila added that for this reason, he
finds widespread political support for the
death penalty to be hypocritical. "Most politi
cians in the U.S. are not really for capital pun
ishment, but they say they are to get elected."
For example, Rose-Avila said, President
Clinton catalogued all the ways in which he
had worked to promote the death penalty
during a speech at the Democratic Nation
al Convention in August.
Following Rose-Avila's speech, two gang
members who asked to be identified as
"Jose" and "Maria" described their involve
