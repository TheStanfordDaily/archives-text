# Carolyn Sleeth: From Russia with love
## Wet panties, skinny dipping and staying alive 
### 
I BOUGHT A cold Baltika beer from
the woman selling drinks outside
the metro entrance and walked out
toward the river, listening to "Staying
Alive" on my walkman. The wind
whipped into my ears and sang along
with the Bee Gees: "Well, you can tell by
the way I use my walk, I'm a woman's
man, no time to talk ..."
The icy snow-mist flecked down and
bit my face. Mud spattered up onto my
black coat, and I darted between the
mud pits and the gypsy women wrapped
in blankets who crouched near them,
begging. I sucked on my beer. I wan
dered trippingly down to the edge of the
water and leaned over, sticking my hand
into the thick blackness of the Moscow
River.
Its iciness drew me, and I lowered my
face until my nose was almost touching
the blackness. I imagined the fish,
mutated by the polluted water, swim
ming under my open mouth. I blew cir
cles of my hot breadth onto the icy water.

I could see the parked car of the mil
itzia behind me on the road. The men
were standing around, smoking and
pissing, wasting time. They watched me
from their car, leering and grinning per
niciously. I stood and walked farther
down the path into the deserted park,
along the bank of the river. Passing a
bend in the river, I scrambled down to
the bank again.
I took the last sip from my beer and
hurled the bottle into the forest behind
me. I took off my shoes and socks and
my coat and set down my backpack on a
patch of dried marsh grass. The mud
and trash squished between my dirty
toes.
"Well, it's all right, it's OK, you may
look the other way ..."
I dipped my foot into the viscous
water, holding it there like a martyr, and
the fuzzy bits of river scum latched onto
me like leeches. I scraped my feet
against the cement block, trying to wipe
them off, and the concrete tore my skin,

blood seeping out. "Whether you're a
mother or whether you're a brother
you're staying alive . . ."
I took off my pants and set them on
top of my shoes. My legs shook in the
piercing wind, hairy and white from
weeks out of the sun. I took off my shirt
and sat down on the frozen cement in
my underwear. I slid both my legs into
the water, watching them grow blue and
shiver in the cold. I pushed more of
myself into the water, staring at my
belly, as white as the mutant fishes.
The water circled around my body
like cold vodka: slow, thick and hungry.
The cold was all powerful, sucking me
in; water nymphs making me shake and
turn numb.
The water slid around me, circling,
tugging at my wet panties. I started to
sing out loud, defying the silence and
blanketing wind which snatched my
voice away from my mouth. "I'm going
nowhere, somebody help me . . ."
Passing a bend in the river, I scram

bled to the bank again. I turned numb.
The water slid around me, circling. It
invigorated me cold, but stinging with
energy. The cigarette butts floating
around me, the sickly fish, the marshy
grass scratching my neck and the black
cold surrounded my body. "Somebody
help me, somebody help me ..."
Naked, I lay in a tortured position on
the bank, holding the slippery mud and
concentrating on the blackness into
which I had lowered my body. I couldn't
touch the bottom.
I slid further, covering my shoulders
in the black vodka, shivering horribly.
The mutant fish circled me, staring at
the strange body entering their world.
The cold overcame me. I jumped out,
wildly frightened that I now had frost
bite on my baby toes and wiped the scum
off my body with my pants.
My body was bluish-white, and I
couldn't feel where I touched myself, I
was so numb. I put on my clothes on
over my wet underwear, tied on my

shoes and scampered away from the
edge of the live, black water. I started to
run. "Ah ah ah ah . . ."
Running, running to feel my blood
again, to feel heat. I ran like a gleeful,
crazed witch, a black cape flying behind
me, past the crouching, begging gypsies
women, past the militzia men, past the
woman selling beeressage, begging gyp
sies women, past the militzia men, past
the woman selling beer and through the
park to my apartment. Me, stung by the
cold, breathing hot air, full of fire, full of
poison, full of life.
The cold lingered, still chilling my
body. The black vodka water licked at
my shoulders, and I shivered. "Ah, ah,
ah, ah, staying alive ..
