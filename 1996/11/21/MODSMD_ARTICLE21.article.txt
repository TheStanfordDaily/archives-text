## Hoopla around Big Game dates back over a century Cardinal football faces highs, lows throughout rivalry 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial Staff 
It's the lOth-oldest rivalry in
terms of games played in college
football history, but chances are
there aren't any that can top Big
Game for wackiness. And the
99th Big Game at Berkeley is
expected to adhere to the rule
rather than the exception,

because when Big Game is in
Memorial Stadium, weird things
happen.
Five-lateral kickoff returns for
touchdowns (1982). Nine points
in 12 seconds (1990). Botched
fake field goals with the line of
scrimmage inside the 10 (1994).
Cal broadcaster Joe Starkey
marks the Saturday before
Thanksgiving in even-numbered

years as his chance for immortali

Here's a look at just some of
the highs and lows of improbable
Big Games through the years, not
counting the rugby contests from
1906-14.
HIGHS
1.1990 - Stanford 27, Cal 25.
Twelve seconds over Berkeley
was billed as revenge for The Play

eight years before. And no Big
Game for either team has seemed
as hopeless, and then hopeful,
and then utterly hopeless, and
then won like this one.
Stanford trailed 25-18 before
quarterback Jason Palumbis
drove the Cardinal down the field
and tossed a touchdown pass to
current Denver Bronco receiver
Ed McCaffrey to cut the deficit to
a point with 12 seconds left. But
Cal's John Hardy made the inter
ception on the two-point conver
sion attempt that sealed Stan
ford's fate.
Or so Cal fans thought. The
zealous fans overwhelmed the
field, drawing a 15-yard penalty.
And the onside kick from midfield
bounced right through the hands
of Cal's Russell White and into
Kevin Scott's. Cardinal ball.
Stanford was poised for a 54-
yard field goal then with nine sec
onds left, but coach Dennis Green
wisely opted for one more play.
Palumbis' pass fell incomplete,
but Cal's John Belli committed
the most egregious Big Game sin
ever by roughing Palumbis, giv
ing John Hopkins an entirely
makeable 39-yard field goal shot.
Hopkins' fifth field goal of the
day gave Stanford its third
straight win to finish 5-6 but
couldn't keep Cal from its first
Bowl win since the 1937 season,
as the Bears went on to win the
Copper Bowl.
2. 1974 - Stanford 22, Cal 20.
Stanford held on to the Axe
when Mike Langford capped a 23-
second drive with a 50-yard field
goal in Berkeley. The Bears had
just taken the lead on a touch
down pass from Steve Bartkowski
(of Atlanta Falcons fame) to Steve
Rivera, stunning the Cardinals'
defense, which had allowed just
28 yards on the ground all day.
But, in an eerie occurrence of
foreshadowing, a weird thing hap
pened with a score of 20-19. Guy

offensive coordinator and a for

San Francisco 49ers, completed
an 18-yard pass to move the ball
to the Stanford 41. After an
incompletion, Stanford had 11
seconds, time for one play to get
into field-goal range. And tight
end Brad Williams rumbled with
a reception 26 yards to the Cal 33,
wisely getting out of bounds with
two ticks left to set up the heroics
for the 5-foot-5 Langford.
3. 1935 - Stanford 13, Cal 0.
The winner would go to the
Rose Bowl, the loser would stay
home (there were no Holiday, Sun
or Aloha Bowls). Coach Tiny
Thornhill's team had already been

to the last two Rose Bowls but was
the underdog to Stub Allison's 9-0
Golden Bears. But Bobby
Grayson, who remained Stan
ford's all-time leading rusher until
1955 and was bumped out of the
top 10 only this year when passed
by junior Anthony Bookman and
senior Mike Mitchell, scored to put
the Indians on top to stay, and the
Vow Boys, who promised never to
lose to USC, also beat Cal for the
third straight time. Unless Stan
ford Stadium is expanded, the
crowd of 94,000 will forever be the
largest crowd ever in the currently
85,500-seat facility.
4. 1988 - Stanford 19, Cal 19.
In the series' 11th tie but the
first since 1950, Stanford held on
to the Axe (which it would not
relinquish until 1993) when Tuan

Van Le blocked a chip-shot field
goal at the gun. It was Stanford's
last blocked field goal until this
year and marked the only time
Stanford and Cal fmished at the
bottom of the Pac-10 since the six
team Athletic Association of West
ern Universities days in 1963.
LOWS
1. 1982 — Cal 25, Stanford 20.
Maybe bis knee was down.
Maybe there should have been a
flag. Maybe trombonist Gary
Tyrell wishes Kevin Moen would
have watched where he was
going. But to say The Play is any
thing less than the most impossi
ble play in football history is an
understatement. This game, the
first on artificial turf in Berkeley,
was Evil.
2. 1986 — Cal 17, Stanford 11.

This debacle is widely referred
to as the biggest upset in Big
Game history, especially by Oski
and the gang. The 1-9 Bears
knocked off the Gator Bowl
bound Cardinal in a disgraceful
performance that marked Cal's
only Big Game triumph from
1983-91. John Paye was sacked
seven times as the 18-point
underdogs avoided their worst
season in the 105-year history of
Cal football.
3. 1972 — Cal 24, Stanford 21.
Until 1982, Stanford faithful
figured it couldn't get much worse
than this. Vince Ferragamo, of
Los Angeles Rams fame, tossed a
7-yard score with zeroes on the
clock to Steve Sweeny before a
crowd of 68,000. There hasn't
been a smaller crowd since — yet.

Van Le blocked a chip-shot field
goal at the gun. It was Stanford's
last blocked field goal until this
year and marked the only time
Stanford and Cal fmished at the
bottom of the Pac-10 since the six
team Athletic Association of West
ern Universities days in 1963.

Maybe bis knee was down.
Maybe there should have been a
flag. Maybe trombonist Gary
Tyrell wishes Kevin Moen would
have watched where he was
going. But to say The Play is any
thing less than the most impossi
ble play in football history is an
understatement. This game, the
first on artificial turf in Berkeley,
was Evil.
2. 1986 — Cal 17, Stanford 11.

This debacle is widely referred
to as the biggest upset in Big
Game history, especially by Oski
and the gang. The 1-9 Bears
knocked off the Gator Bowl
bound Cardinal in a disgraceful
performance that marked Cal's
only Big Game triumph from
1983-91. John Paye was sacked
seven times as the 18-point
underdogs avoided their worst
season in the 105-year history of
Cal football.
3. 1972 — Cal 24, Stanford 21.
Until 1982, Stanford faithful
figured it couldn't get much worse
than this. Vince Ferragamo, of
Los Angeles Rams fame, tossed a
7-yard score with zeroes on the
clock to Steve Sweeny before a
crowd of 68,000. There hasn't
been a smaller crowd since — yet.
It's the lOth-oldest rivalry in
terms of games played in college
football history, but chances are
there aren't any that can top Big
Game for wackiness. And the
99th Big Game at Berkeley is
expected to adhere to the rule
rather than the exception,

because when Big Game is in
Memorial Stadium, weird things
happen.
Five-lateral kickoff returns for
touchdowns (1982). Nine points
in 12 seconds (1990). Botched
fake field goals with the line of
scrimmage inside the 10 (1994).

Big Games through the years, not
counting the rugby contests from
1906-14.
HIGHS
1.1990 - Stanford 27, Cal 25.
Twelve seconds over Berkeley
was billed as revenge for The Play

eight years before. And no Big
Game for either team has seemed
as hopeless, and then hopeful,
and then utterly hopeless, and
then won like this one.
Stanford trailed 25-18 before
quarterback Jason Palumbis
drove the Cardinal down the field
and tossed a touchdown pass to
current Denver Bronco receiver
Ed McCaffrey to cut the deficit to
a point with 12 seconds left. But
Cal's John Hardy made the inter
ception on the two-point conver
sion attempt that sealed Stan
ford's fate.
Or so Cal fans thought. The
zealous fans overwhelmed the
field, drawing a 15-yard penalty.
And the onside kick from midfield
bounced right through the hands
of Cal's Russell White and into
Kevin Scott's. Cardinal ball.
Stanford was poised for a 54-
yard field goal then with nine sec
onds left, but coach Dennis Green
wisely opted for one more play.
Palumbis' pass fell incomplete,
but Cal's John Belli committed
the most egregious Big Game sin
ever by roughing Palumbis, giv
ing John Hopkins an entirely
makeable 39-yard field goal shot.
Hopkins' fifth field goal of the
day gave Stanford its third
straight win to finish 5-6 but
couldn't keep Cal from its first
Bowl win since the 1937 season,
as the Bears went on to win the
Copper Bowl.
2. 1974 - Stanford 22, Cal 20.
Stanford held on to the Axe
when Mike Langford capped a 23-
second drive with a 50-yard field
goal in Berkeley. The Bears had
just taken the lead on a touch
down pass from Steve Bartkowski
(of Atlanta Falcons fame) to Steve
Rivera, stunning the Cardinals'
defense, which had allowed just
28 yards on the ground all day.
But, in an eerie occurrence of
foreshadowing, a weird thing hap
pened with a score of 20-19. Guy

offensive coordinator and a for
mer backup quarterback for the

San Francisco 49ers, completed
an 18-yard pass to move the ball
to the Stanford 41. After an
incompletion, Stanford had 11
seconds, time for one play to get
into field-goal range. And tight
end Brad Williams rumbled with
a reception 26 yards to the Cal 33,
wisely getting out of bounds with
two ticks left to set up the heroics
for the 5-foot-5 Langford.
3. 1935 - Stanford 13, Cal 0.
The winner would go to the
Rose Bowl, the loser would stay
home (there were no Holiday, Sun
or Aloha Bowls). Coach Tiny
Thornhill's team had already been

to the last two Rose Bowls but was
the underdog to Stub Allison's 9-0
Golden Bears. But Bobby
Grayson, who remained Stan
ford's all-time leading rusher until
1955 and was bumped out of the
top 10 only this year when passed
by junior Anthony Bookman and
senior Mike Mitchell, scored to put
the Indians on top to stay, and the
Vow Boys, who promised never to
lose to USC, also beat Cal for the
third straight time. Unless Stan
ford Stadium is expanded, the
crowd of 94,000 will forever be the
largest crowd ever in the currently
85,500-seat facility.
4. 1988 - Stanford 19, Cal 19.
In the series' 11th tie but the
first since 1950, Stanford held on
to the Axe (which it would not
relinquish until 1993) when Tuan

Van Le blocked a chip-shot field
goal at the gun. It was Stanford's
last blocked field goal until this
year and marked the only time
