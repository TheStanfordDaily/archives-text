## Hoopla around Big Game dates back over a century Cardinal football faces highs, lows throughout rivalry 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial Staff 
It's the lOth-oldest rivalry in
terms of games played in college
football history, but chances are
there aren't any that can top Big
Game for wackiness. And the
99th Big Game at Berkeley is
expected to adhere to the rule
rather than the exception,

because when Big Game is in
Memorial Stadium, weird things
happen.
Five-lateral kickoff returns for
touchdowns (1982). Nine points
in 12 seconds (1990). Botched
fake field goals with the line of
scrimmage inside the 10 (1994).

Thanksgiving in even-numbered

years as his chance for immortali

Here's a look at just some of
the highs and lows of improbable
Big Games through the years, not
counting the rugby contests from
1906-14.
HIGHS
1.1990 - Stanford 27, Cal 25.
Twelve seconds over Berkeley
was billed as revenge for The Play

eight years before. And no Big
Game for either team has seemed
as hopeless, and then hopeful,
and then utterly hopeless, and
then won like this one.
Stanford trailed 25-18 before
quarterback Jason Palumbis
drove the Cardinal down the field
and tossed a touchdown pass to
current Denver Bronco receiver
Ed McCaffrey to cut the deficit to
a point with 12 seconds left. But
Cal's John Hardy made the inter
ception on the two-point conver
sion attempt that sealed Stan
ford's fate.
Or so Cal fans thought. The
zealous fans overwhelmed the
field, drawing a 15-yard penalty.
And the onside kick from midfield
bounced right through the hands
of Cal's Russell White and into
Kevin Scott's. Cardinal ball.
Stanford was poised for a 54-
yard field goal then with nine sec
onds left, but coach Dennis Green
wisely opted for one more play.
Palumbis' pass fell incomplete,
but Cal's John Belli committed
the most egregious Big Game sin
ever by roughing Palumbis, giv
ing John Hopkins an entirely
makeable 39-yard field goal shot.
Hopkins' fifth field goal of the
day gave Stanford its third
straight win to finish 5-6 but
couldn't keep Cal from its first
Bowl win since the 1937 season,
as the Bears went on to win the
Copper Bowl.
2. 1974 - Stanford 22, Cal 20.
Stanford held on to the Axe
when Mike Langford capped a 23-
second drive with a 50-yard field
goal in Berkeley. The Bears had
just taken the lead on a touch
down pass from Steve Bartkowski
(of Atlanta Falcons fame) to Steve
Rivera, stunning the Cardinals'
defense, which had allowed just
28 yards on the ground all day.
But, in an eerie occurrence of
foreshadowing, a weird thing hap
pened with a score of 20-19. Guy
