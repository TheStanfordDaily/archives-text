# Spikers to face Wildcats
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The second-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team (23-2,
15-1 Pacific 10 Conference) is
somewhat ingratiated to No. 20
Arizona (18-8, 9-7), the team it
will play tonight at 7 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
Thanks to victories over
UCLA and USC last weekend
coupled with an upset that the
Wildcats pulled over Washing
ton State, the Card clinched the
Pac-10 title a week before the
conclusion of the conference
season.
Stanford will attempt to
repay Arizona by making the
Wildcats the 44th consecutive
team to visit the Farm and leave
with a loss.
However, Stanford will have
its hands full with Arizona, a
squad that toppled 15th-ranked
Washington 15-8, 15-13, 15-5
before sweeping No. 10 Wash
ington State 15-13, 15-13, 15-11
last weekend.
With those strong perfor
mances, the Wildcats have given
themselves an excellent shot of
qualifying for the NCAA tour
nament as well as established
themselves as a dangerous team
capable of upsets.
"They are one of the hottest
teams in the conference," said
Stanford coach Don Shaw.
"They are a good blocking team,
and they have some good ath
letes."
One of those athletes that the
Card will have to focus upon is
Barb Bell, a senior outside hit
ter who holds the all-time
record for kills and digs at Ari
zona. The Wildcats also have a
very deep squad, allowing them

to find the right combination of
players for a given match.
The Cardinal will counter the
Arizona attack with some fine
blocking of its own, anchored by
senior Eileen Murfee and junior
Barbara Ifejika.
Both middle blockers have
demonstrated their offensive
capabilities as well, as Murfee
leads the squad with a .349 hit
ting percentage and Ifejika fol
lows close behind, hitting .347.
Outside hitters Kristin Folkl,
a junior, and Kerri Walsh, a
freshman, have given the Card a
potent offensive attack along
with giving opposing teams fits.
The two players have

accounted for a whopping 753
kills this season.
Stanford struggled with Ari
zona when the two teams met at
the beginning of the conference
season. The Card visited Tucson
after losing to Pacific in its pre
vious match and played like an
unsettled team.
Although Stanford defeated
the Wildcats in four games, the
team would like to put forth a
better performance tonight.
The Cardinal is also well
aware of Arizona's success, and
will definitely not take lightly a
squad that has defeated Wash
ington State. The Cougars gave
Stanford its only loss of the Pac
10 season on Oct. 26.
"We respect Arizona," Shaw
said. "When we play a team we
have a lot of respect for, we usu
ally play well."
