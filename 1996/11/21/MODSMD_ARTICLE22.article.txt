## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The second-ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team (23-2,
15-1 Pacific 10 Conference) is
somewhat ingratiated to No. 20
Arizona (18-8, 9-7), the team it
will play tonight at 7 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
Thanks to victories over
UCLA and USC last weekend
coupled with an upset that the
Wildcats pulled over Washing
ton State, the Card clinched the
Pac-10 title a week before the
conclusion of the conference
season.
Stanford will attempt to
repay Arizona by making the
Wildcats the 44th consecutive
team to visit the Farm and leave
with a loss.
However, Stanford will have
its hands full with Arizona, a
squad that toppled 15th-ranked
Washington 15-8, 15-13, 15-5
before sweeping No. 10 Wash
ington State 15-13, 15-13, 15-11
last weekend.
With those strong perfor
mances, the Wildcats have given
themselves an excellent shot of
qualifying for the NCAA tour
nament as well as established
themselves as a dangerous team
capable of upsets.
"They are one of the hottest
teams in the conference," said
Stanford coach Don Shaw.
"They are a good blocking team,
and they have some good ath
letes."
One of those athletes that the
Card will have to focus upon is
Barb Bell, a senior outside hit
ter who holds the all-time
record for kills and digs at Ari
zona. The Wildcats also have a
very deep squad, allowing them
