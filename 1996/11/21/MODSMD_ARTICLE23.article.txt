# Axe tradition still lives on

### Vanessa Arrington Editorial staff 
One hundred years ago in
1896, Stanford yell leaders cre
ated a new chant to inspire ath
letic teams and fans. The "Axe
Yell," as it came to be called,
contained the chorus "Give 'em
the ax, the ax, the ax" and epito
mized Stanford's sentiment
towards its rival across the Bay.
Three years later during a
baseball series with Cal, one
Stanford yell leader decided a
visual display was needed to
accompany the new cheer, so he
bought an axe with a 15-inch

blade and painted a big Cardinal
"S" on it. At a bonfire before the
third game of the series, the yell
leader used the Axe to decapi
tate an effigy of the Golden
Bear. Due to the joyous support
offered by the Stanford stu
dents, the .Axe was brought to
the last baseball game — played
in San Francisco on April 15,
1899 — to symbolize Stanford
spirit and its ability to "beat"
Cal.
At the end of the game (which
Cal won), drama ensued. A mob
of Cal fans attacked the Stan-

ford yell squad and succeeded in
stealing the Axe. In relay style,
various Cal men raced around
the City, at one point managing
to get the handle sawed off at a
butcher shop, until they got the
Axe to the Berkeley ferry termi
nal.
At the terminal, police were
searching Cal fans for the Axe,

but the real culprit got away
after fully concealing the covet
ed item and grabbing the arm of
an old girlfriend as he boarded
the ferry and bypassed the
search.
The Axe was held captive in
Berkeley until April 3, 1930,
when a group of Stanford stu
dents — later dubbed the
"Immortal Twenty-One" —
returned the Axe to its rightful
owner. The group went to the
site of the annual Axe Rally and
then followed the car containing

the Axe. As the holder of the Axe
got out of the car, the Stanford
students, who were disguised as
cameramen, approached the car
and, after struggling with Cal
protectors of the Axe and drop
ping a tear gas bomb, eventually
got a hold of the Axe once again.
In 1933, Stanford and Cal
student presidents signed an
agreement to make the Axe the
official trophy of the Big Game.
The winner of the annual Big
Game would possess the Axe for
the year after the game. In the

event of a tie, the Axe would stay
with the most recent winner.
Since then, Cal has stolen the
Axe twice and Stanford has
appropriated it three times, giv
ing Stanford the lead in Axe
stealing (4-3) as well as in Big
Game wins (48-39-11).
Currently, Stanford is the
legitimate owner of the Axe, and
has every intention to proudly
maintain its possession after
Saturday's Big Game, whether it
be through a win, a tie or nefari
ous means.
