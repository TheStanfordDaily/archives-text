# 'The Skate'
## Ice hockey plays own Big Game 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
Instead of fighting for the Axe, the
Stanford men's ice hockey team will be
hoping to bring back "The Skate" in its
own version of Big Game.
This week, the Cardinal has a
chance to clinch the trophy with two
games against the Golden Bears — one
tonight in Oakland and then one at
home tomorrow night at 7:15 p.m. at
the Ice Oasis in Redwood City.
The Skate Trophy, the embodiment
of the Stanford-Cal rivalry on the ice,
goes to the winner of the most games
between the teams during regular-sea
son play. If Stanford can win both
games this week, the two victories plus
one win and a tie against Cal earlier
this season would give the Cardinal the

lion's share of this season's games.
Stanford players agree that Cal is
little to worry about.
"The two teams are always pretty
competitive," said goalie Nick Flores.
"But I think we can take them."
"Since we are unbeaten against Cal
so far, I think that if we come to play,
we should do well," said junior Matt
Blythe.
For the Cardinal (6-2-2, 6-0-2 Pacif
ic 8 Conference), the two games also
present a chance to expand upon a sea
son in which it has yet to lose in league
play.
"This is a really important point in
the season," said junior Evan Asano.
"If we can go into the second half of the
season undefeated and having already
won the Skate, it would be great for our
momentum."

The Bears (7-4-2, 5-3-2 Pac-8) have
posted a respectable record despite
falling to Stanford earlier in the sea
son. The squad was able to bounce back
after the loss to the Cardinal with a
sweep of UCLA and has been improv
ing ever since.
Stanford, although undefeated and
arguably the best team in the league,
still has a few problems. Last week's
addition of two new players — senior
Conrad Ray and junior Eri Crum (also
members of the Stanford golf team) —
undoubtedly made the ice hockey team
both deeper and stronger, but the
inconsistent status of the lines has
slowed down the progress of the team.
"I think that because there's been a
lot of shifting in the first two lines late-
ly, our teamwork has suffered,"
Asano said. "When you get used to
your teammates, it's like you

know where they are without even
looking. I just don't feel that yet."
That didn't stop team captain
Tom Terbell from hypothesizing,
in traditional rivalry fashion, why
the Cardinal would win.
"They're at a real disadvan
tage," he said. "They are Cal."
