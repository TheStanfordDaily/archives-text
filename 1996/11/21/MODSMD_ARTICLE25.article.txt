# Rowers confront Cal at last fall regatta
## Cardinal crew ready to beat its rival at Sunday's San Mateo contest 
### Blake Thompson 
Both crew teams are heading into Big
Game weekend with their focus on one
team â€” the California Golden Bears. In
their last chance at competition until the
spring, each squad will compete in the Big
How in San Mateo on Sunday against Cal
and a number of other smaller schools.
The excitement for the men rowers
has been building into this raw as they
get their first chance to row against the
Bears this season. The rivalry has been
very competitive over the last few years,
and Cal will be even more to reckon with
since the arrival of their new, interna
tionally experienced coach, Steve Blad
stone.
In the three times Stanford and Cal

have raced on Big Game weekend. Stan
ford has captured two of the titles, with
its only loss coming last year. Last season,
the men beat Cal in a race in Oahu but
they fell to the Bears in San Mateo, a
trend they clearly don't want to continue.
Especially after a freak accident with
the boat in Seattle two weekends ago that
prevented the men from finishing the
race, it is hard to predict what kind of
showing they will make. Most of the same
team that raced in Seattle will compete
this weekend, and coach Wieslaw Kujda is
only hoping for better luck.
"I'm just keeping my fingers crossed
that we can finish the race," Kujda said
jokingly.
The Card is also a little unsure what to
expect from its opponents. "It's tough to

say how they are, they really haven t
raced anybody yet," Kujda said.
Whatever the result of this weekend's
regatta though, Kujda is happy with how
the men are progressing and looks for a
strong spring season.
"We're different than a lot of teams
because we are making many improve
ments now," Kujda said. "I'm pretty con
fident about our program, I think we can
beat Cal, but you never know how
things go."
The women's squad is facing the
same challenge from the Bears, but it
has the advantage of already having
raced them this season. Last month,
the Card defeated Cal bv five seconds
