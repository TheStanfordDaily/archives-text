# Women swimmers host Golden Bears

### Corie Calfee 
This afternoon, the Stanford
women's swim team will take on
California in a non-scoring, off
distance practice meet at 3 p.m. in
deGuerre Pool.
Traditionally, the Bears have
not been a threat to the Cardinal
in women's swimming competi
tion. Stanford beat Cal handily in
both the dual meet and the Pacific
10 Conference Championships
last year.
In lieu of this lack of competi
tion and the early season date, the
coaches decided on a creative meet
format for this afternoon. The two
teams will meet again in midsea
son for a traditional, scored meet.
"We're looking to get some
good practice in some non-tradi
tional races," said head coach
Richard Quick, adding that "it
should be a great chance to race a
little bit."
The teams will compete in 50-
and 300-yard races of each stroke
instead of the usual 100- and 200-
yard competitions. The individual
medley, usually either a 200-yard
or 400-yard race, will be 300 yards
long.
The unique lineup of individual
events allows the sprinters to
practice speed and the distance

swimmers to work on endurance
and race strategy.
The relays will also follow a cre
ative format. Usually, relay swim
mers swim equal distances in each
of the four legs of freestyle relays.
However, in this meet, each leg of
the relay will consist of a different
length. The leadofT swimmer will
complete 200 yards, and each of the
following swimmers will compete
in progressively shorter distances:
150 yards, 100 yards and 50 yards.
Instead of the normal 400-yard
medley relay in which each team
member swims 100 yards of a spe
cialty stroke, the relay will be
4xloo-yard individual medleys.
This informal meet with the
Bears is a way to hone the team's
skills in preparation for an upcom
ing meet at Auburn in mid-
December.
"In Auburn, we're shooting to
qualify as many people as possible
for the NCAA Championships
without shaving or tapering,"
Quick explained. "The more peo
ple we qualify now, the fewer we
will have to rest for the Pac-10
Championships. Less resting in
the early season contributes to
fast swimming in the late season.
"We are looking to swim fast
now," Quick said, "but even faster
as the season progresses."
