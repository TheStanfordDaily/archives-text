Women's basketball
The Stanford women's bas
ketball team (1-0) pulled out
an impressive 108-87 win at
Maples Pavilion over possibly
the biggest competition it will
face all season.
The Chinese National
Team, which boasts 6-foot-8
center Zheng Hai-xia, gave the
No. 1 Cardinal all it could han
dle for about 10 minutes. In
that time the Chinese played
toe-to-toe with Stanford in
what promised to be a very
physical inside battle.
But the Card's quickness
and depth soon put the contest
out of reach and gave Stanford
a 57-30 halftime lead. The
Cardinal's offense was up and

running (74.1 percent shoot
ing from the field), and the
squad had four players in dou
ble figures by the break.
As a team, Stanford broke
into triple figures by the
game's conclusion to end the
contest with a 108-87 victory.
Stanford junior forward Kate
Starbird scored a game-high
29 points to match the efforts
of China's Hai-xia.
Also in double figures for
Stanford were junior forward /
center Olympia Scott with 20,
junior forward Vanessa
Nygaard with 15, junior for
ward / center Naomi Muli
tauaopele with 11 and fresh
man guard Christina Batasti
ni with 10.
