### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
In her annual State of Student Af
fairs speech yesterday afternoon in
Kresge Auditorium, Vice Provost and
Dean of Student Affairs Mary Ed
monds stressed that the undergradu
ate experience must be improved.
Reminding listeners that "change
is a constant," Edmonds said her of
fice continues to evaluate the crucial
freshman and sophomore years.
Indeed, Edmonds still faces change
as she and the student affairs senior
staff try "to project student affairs at
Stanford.
"We have solicited many points of
view from faculty, staff and adminis
trators including the president and
provost," Edmonds said.
Edmonds and her staff have been
considering what she calls "objective
strategies" to improve undergraduate
education. Areas of concern include
housing and curriculum.
"We're looking at such things as
housing, Stanford Introductory Stud
ies and the instruction of technology,"
Edmonds said. "Of course, this is all
work in progress."
Edmonds and the Office of Student
Affairs senior staff are responsible for
laying out a broad guideline which
such units as Housing and Dining Ser
vices, Residential Education and the
Undergraduate Admissions and Fi
nancial Aids Office can follow, Ed
monds said.
"With a clear sense of direction, all
the units can make better decisions,"
Edmonds said.
Edmonds spoke of an "overarching

sense of what we are about," which in
cludes a "vision statement, core values
and a mission statement with its ac
companying goals, objectives and
strategies."
The vision statement, Edmonds
said, "recognizes the uniqueness of
the individual to take many varied

paths to learning."
Core values, the second component
of the stafTs projection, stem from
"our personal values and beliefs," Ed
monds said. "We believe that people
grow and learn from both cognitive

and affective experiences."
The "mission statement," the
third part of the staffs guideline
which details the role Stanford
should play in students' lives,
calls for the University "to per
form as a partner in the life cycle
of the Stanford student."
Despite these broad objectives,
Edmonds said little about specific
plans for the future. She did say
that she and her staff will be ask
ing for input from students
throughout the process of re
defining the University's role in
student affairs.
Emphasizing the inevitability
of change, Edmonds said the be
ginningof her administration was
"the best of times; it was the

worst of times."
As evidence of changes
throughout her term, she men
tioned the change in her posi
tion's name from vice president
for student resources to vice
provost and dean for student af
fairs. She also mentioned the
change in location of her office
from the Quad to Tresidder
Union.
In the cycle of "chaos" and
"perceived stability," Edmonds
said, "Expectations have escalat
ed while budget cuts have contin
ued. ... If we must reduce, we
must be aware of the conse
quences but ready to support
those decisions."
The presentation, which
marked Edmonds' fifth year with
the University, also recognized
employees who have been with
Stanford for more than five years.
