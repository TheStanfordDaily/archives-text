Today I was hiking around campus when I saw this guv I used to
like, so 1 hiked fast past him without saying hi, and yes, the Stanton
Film Society is hosting a series on the psychology of violence. Soci
ety Pre/ Jonathan Levitt is a cool guy, don't vou think?

After that, at the Bookstore, I saw Prof. Marsh looking ravishing .is
usual, and yes, there are lots of fun things to do this weekend.
Theater 5
I really like Prof. Marsh, she's cool. And by the way, Ralph Mac -
chio's in "How to Succeed without Really Trying."
Opera 7
I saw Bret in class today wearing a tight white shirt and I thought it
looked really nice on him, but he couldn't wear that to the opera.
Profile 8
I really love being an English major because I get to write nifty es
says about objectification. And oh, Jeffrey Harrison s a poet.
Music 12
I really get tired of people saying they hate me and then lying about
it. I should throw some CDs in their faces.
Profile 15
Working at the Daily is a bit like getting a haircut every day, except
it's clean and more exciting, plus I don't really know what blow jobs
feel like. Maybe Tori Amos does.
Film 16
People should never RSVP to parties they have no intention of at
tending. And yes, "The English Patient" is opening this weekend,
joining "Microcosmos" and that Streisand flick at the theaters.
Classies 19
Where we seek revenge on all the people who have pissed us oft in
the last week.
