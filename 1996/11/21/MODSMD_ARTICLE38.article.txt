## The
						Singing Executive Macchio climbs the corporate ladder in 'Succeed, 'but can't reach the high notes 
### 
There are two things that remain genuine
ly American these days: the big-budget musi
cal comedy and the idea of corporate climb
ing. That may be why "How to Succeed in
Business without Really Trying" is such an en
during classic.
In its new incarnation, spearheaded by di
rector Des McNuff, the musical still manages
to thrill at the right places, but something
more sinister starts taking place. For what was
originally a satire of contemporary (early '60s)
American business practices has become un
comfortably close to reality.
The hero is I. Pierpont Finch (Ralph Mac
chio), a window-washer whose name suggests
some of his aspirations of grandeur. Finch
wants to be a great success, and following the
instructions of the title book, he joins the mail
room of a large corporation. Through flattery,
manipulation and opportunism, Finch climbs
the ladder to the executive suite and finds him
self promoted to vice president. He literally
lies, cajoles and sweet-talks his way to the top.
In a sense, his rise to riches is a subversion
of the classic American dream story, in which
the tenets of hard work, talent and skill are
reaplced by trickery, cleverness and dumb
luck. Ambition wins over ability, and the fact
that the entire story is told as a fairy tale only
makes its dark side more sinister.
For although the musical's look is squeaky
clean ( primary colors dominate the sets, and the
costumes look colorful yet appropriate lor an
office), the issues it deals with are not: corporate
downsizing, sexual harassment and sexism, the
glass ceiling and blind ambition. Many of these
topics are no longer laughing or singing matter.

Hut although the Frank Loesser-Abe Bur
rows hook and lyrics are dated, the revival's at
titude compensates with use of modern tech
nology and savvy. Set designer's |ohn Arnone
creates eye-popping computer-generated
graphics that suggest at times the view from a
window at a skyscraper or the perspective of a
bird Hying through the air.
Another practice of modern Broadway that
doesn't work as well is the "stunt casting" of
Macchio in the lead role. One problem with
casting a star in a demanding role is that the
star will get warm applause upon his first en
trance but is not guaranteed the same enthu
siastic treatment at curtain calls.
Macchio's vocal range fails his role at the
most inopportune times, most notably at the
"I Believe in You" production number, a song
which begs the performer to belt out the
music. Macchio doesn't.
"How to Succeed," which won the Pulitzer
Prize during its original 1%1 run, is a di
nosaur no doubt, but in McNuff's gorgeous
revival, he's dressed in such a nice suit that he's
a pleasure to have around.

Business without Really Trying" runs at S p.m.
