# Get thee to the opera
## 'The Barber of Saville' is finished, but other great selections are still ahead 
### Gabriela Teodorescu 
Sometimes a performance comes togeth
er so well that it seems not only impossible
to critique but even difficult to dissemble
into its conglomerate pieces in order to sing
the praises of its different contributors. "II
Barbiere di Siviglia" ("The Barber of Sav
ille"), by Gioachino Rossini, was such a per
formance.
The San Francisco Opera put on a won
derful show with this immensely theatrical
and very comic rendition of what seems to
be one of the few operas with a happy end
ing. The production took place at the Or
pheum Theater because the War Memorial
Opera House is currently undergoing seis
mic restructuring. However, the smaller set
ting allowed the performers to better con
nect with the audience and gave the whole
show a feeling of intimacy, as if one were
watching one's family in the living room.
Rossini's overture, conducted well by
Patrick Summers, cannot be faulted for its
beauty and verve, giving a musical prelude
to the whole piece. However, the spark to
the whole story was provided by baritone
Earle Patriarco, who played Figaro.
The part of the dashing playboy barber
was perfect for Patriarco, who knew how to
bring out his role's excesses in the most de
lightful ways, with a wink here, an eyebrow
life there and a couple of provocative grins
to set the mood. The first aria, Figaro, ended
with resounding applause, which under
scored his excellent voice.
The rest of the cast built on a great begin
ning. Mezzo-soprano Mika Shigematsu
played Rosina well, with a beautiful voice

and the ability to show what a sly woman
Rosina really was through just a few gestures
and looks. And tenor lorge Lopez-Yanez, as
Count Almaviva, convincingly played the
man in love with Rosina, embellishing the
role with well-sung arias devoted to seduc
ing Rosina.
As always in an opera, the lover has a
rival. He is Bartolo, Rosina's fat and greedy
ward who is intent on forcing Rosina into
marriage primarily in order to receive her
dowry. Bass-baritone Steven Condy played
the overstuffed Bartolo with panache and
vigor. The lawyer who was to undertake the
seedy task of writing up a fake marriage cer
tificate is Don Basilio, played by Chester
Patton (the character reminded me of
Moliere's stuffy lawyers), but Patton
brought a good voice and character to the
role.
The story, based on one of Beaumarchais'
plays, is a good, rollicking comedy. Since the
barber isn't a lover but the mediator of the
whole story, this adds a new and interesting
element to the twists and turns in the plot. It
also makes the piece easy to identify with.
All in all, the performance was excellent
in its various aspects. The set was function
al but not obtrusive, and the costumes and
choreography were excellent.
Unfortunately, "II Barbiere di Siviglia"
has closed for the season. Nonetheless, the
San Francisco Opera, even relocated to dif
ferent theaters for this season, is absolutely
worth seeing. SF Opera is offering first-rate
performances of not only some of the best
loved operas but is also at the forefront of
debuting operas.
This season, also at the Orpheum Theater,

is the West coast
premier of "Harvey
Milk" by Stewart
Wallace and Mi
chael Korie, from
Nov. 9-30 th. ()ffen
bach's "Les Gontes
d'Hoffman" will
run this week
through Dec. 3 at
Civic Auditorium.
For the holiday sea
son, the Opera will
feature five perfor
mances of |. Strauss,
Ir.'s operetta "Die
Fliedermaus," also
at the Civic, from
Dec. 26-29. Richard
Strauss "Salome"
will grace the Civic's
stage between Jan.
18 and Feb. 1. Bizet's
"Carmen," which
has already run for a
couple weeks this
season and has been
well-received, will
be at Civic Auditori
um Feb. 12-22. Fi
nally, Verdi's world
acclaimed opera
"Aida" will end the
season at Civic Au-

ditorium Feb. 8-23. This last performance
should not be missed.
So, while you think those finals have got
ten you down, go see a beautiful but usually
non-happy-ending opera in San Francisco,

and not only will you feel better, hut you'll
see a wonderful work of art. For tickets and
information, call the San Francisco Opera at
861-4008. Remember to get your tickets
early because they do sell out.
