# Hemo Bowl makes 2nd appearance
## ASSU bus service also continues another Big Game tradition 
### Laura Franklin 
Students with plenty of school spirit
can help Stanford to victory through
two Big Game-related activities this
week — the Hemo Bowl and Bus Back
the Axe.
Hemo Bowl is a friendly blood dona
tion competition between UC-Berkeley
and Stanford in which everyone except
the football players can participate. The
winner, the school which has the higher
percentage of students donating blood,

will be announced during halftime at
Saturday's game.
The Stanford Student Alumni Net
work and its UC-Berkeley counterpart
established Hemo Bowl last year, which
Stanford won along with Big Game.
Sophomore Pascale Goupillaud,
Hemo Bowl's student coordinator, said
that while dorm-sponsored blood drives
occur throughout the school year.
"Some people are normally apprehen
sive to give, and people might be more
likely to give when it is competitive and

spirited."
Stationed in Old Union all day today
and in the Bloodmobile in White Plaza
all day tomorrow, Stanford Blood Cen
ter collection crews will be accepting do
nations from students, staff and alumni.
Cindy Pearson, the Alumni Associa
tion's program director for alumni rela
tions, said she thinks that "because the
donation points are on campus, there
will be more students and staff partici-
pating than alumni."
All involved predicted another
big win on both fronts. "We expect
to beat Cal again this year and
keep the winning streak alive,"
said Pearson.
While the Blood Center recom
mends making an appointment,
blood will be accepted on a walk-on
basis with an expected donation
time of about one hour.
"Due to the fact that Berkeley is
much larger than Stanford," said
Goupillaud, "we are determining
the winner on the basis of the per
centage of the school donating, not
the units of blood."
In 1995, while UC-Berkeley do

nated about 40 more units than
Stanford, their percentage of
donors was less.
Most blood organizations, in
cluding the Stanford Blood Cen
ter, step up donation activities
during the holiday season be
cause, according to Blood Center
employee Maureen Sullivan,
"There are more accidents during
the holiday season when a lot of
people are traveling," exacerbat
ing already existent blood de
mands.
Neither football team, the most
fundamental members of the Big
Game celebrations, can contribute
to the Hemo Bowl. "You don't
want to donate blood and then
play a major game," warned Sulli
van.
The second activity students

can participate in is the Bus Back
the Axe student bussing service.
Run by ASSU Group Discounts,
Bus Back the Axe is providing 900
Stanford students and alumni
with bus rides to and from Big
Game, a lunch catered by Polio
Rey and free Nike apparel.
"There was a huge response to
our offer," said sophomore Daniel
Turchin, coordinator of the event.
Turchin's organization provides a
service for the benefit of the stu
dents and funnels all revenues
back into student programming.
"We hope to serve as the extra
man on the football team," said
Turchin, who added that he thinks
the service might just provide the
extra spunk and spirit necessary
for Stanford to keep the Axe for
another year.

In addition to helping the actu
al team, a bussing service is crucial
to many students' attendance of
the Stanford-Berkeley game: "We
offer an inexpensive, safe way to
get to Berkeley," said Turchin.
The only other obvious options
for transportation are BART and
driving to the game. However,
BART, according to Turchin, is
too crowded, and driving is an un
pleasant prospect when the closest
parking place might be closer to
Stanford than to Berkeley.
With Big Game located at UC-
Berkeley every other year and
with such enthusiastic support
from the student body, Turchin
said he "would imagine Bus Back
the Axe will continue" as long as
Stanford students are spirited and
as long as the Axe is cherished.
