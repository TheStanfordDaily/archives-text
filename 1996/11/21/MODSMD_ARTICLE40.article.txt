## Writing the Real Poems: A 						former Stegner Fellow reflects on literary authenticity, his mentor James Merrill and his new book 
### Eric Leventhal 
One night before his bedtime, a 10-year-old boy an
nounced to his parents that he would some day be a
writer.
So began the distinguished career of Jeffrey Harrison
— poet, author of the just-published "Signs of Arrival"
(Copper Beech Press; $10) and past recipient of Stan
ford's Wallace E. Stegner Fellowship in Creative Writing.
Harrisons second book of poems contains work writ
ten between 1987 and 1995. The poems are arranged into
three sections, according to subject matter: growing up
in Ohio and the Adirondacks, traveling on the Asian con
tinent and looking through his great-grandfather's
photo albums from a trip around the world in 1905.
The book also contains poems about Harrison's son,
as well as a tribute to the late James Merrill, whom he
considers "an incredibly gifted poet" and mentor.
A milestone in Harrison's career occurred when Mer
rill, one of the most acclaimed American poets of the
20th century, selected Harrison's first volume of poetry
"The Singing Underneath" for the 1987 National Poetry
Series. The next year, the book was published by E.P.
Dutton.
Merrill said of Harrison's poems, "There is no one else
for whose poems — their tone and wording and overall
approach to things — I feel greater sympathy and admi
ration." The two remained friends until Merrill's death in
1995.
Ry the time he met Merrill, Harrison had already en
joyed the success of being a Stegner fellow at Stanford.
The program waives tuition payment for young writers,
giving them time to write and receive instruction on
campus.
"1 have really good memories of my time at Stanford,"

Harrison said, reflecting on the year he spent on campus.
The Stegner Fellowship "came at just the right time (or
me," he said.
According to Harrison, Stanford formerly had one of
the top master of fine arts programs in the country, but
the University later decided to end the program. During
1985-86 the Stegner Fellowships had only a one-year du
ration, as opposed to the current two.
"T/ujf would have been nice," he remarked wistfully
about the opportunity to have spent an additional year at
Stanford.
Although he has received many honors, including fel
lowships from the Ingram Merrill Foundation and the
National Endowment for the Arts, Harrison admits that
writing does not always come easily for him.
One of the difficulties, Harrison explained, is that "in
some ways it feels like you're never going to get it right.
It's like Elizabeth Bishop said: 'When do you write the
real poems?' "
At the same time, the act of creation is often, in itself,
enough to satisfy the artist. "If you need to know (from
someone else) whether it's good, you shouldn't do it,"
said Harrison.
As for his own poetic style, Harrison noted, "1 believe
in clarity.... Poems are about making sense of the
world, of the relationship between language and the
world." According to Harrison, complexity for its own
sake may only be a device that obscures meaninglessness.
"If you say something stupid, nobody knows," he said.
Harrison expressed his distaste for the contesting fac
tions of modern poets, e.g., those who view formal poet
ry as a product of social elitism vs. those who consider
free verse poetry to be a symptom of a senseless, stoned
off-your-ass drug culture.
"I feel that within all those groups, there is good and
there is bad," Harrison explained. "A single poet should
have the right to write in as many different ways as he
feels moved to do."
Harrison has also tried his hand at teaching, in both
American literature, creative writing, and English as a
second language. He has taught at George Washington
University, the University of lowa (where he received a
master of fine arts degree in 1984) and the Berlitz Lan
guage School in Sapporo, Japan.
"I tried to get [my students] to talk about the world ...
in a way that expresses their feeling indirectly," he said.
Now, with two children of his own, 1 larrison finds sig
nificantly less time to concentrate on poetry. "I'm Mr.
Mom," he said. One of Harrison's favorite poems in
"Signs of Arrival" centers around the birth of his son.
Nonetheless, poetry will always exert an important in
fluence on I larrison's life. "It keeps something inside you
alive," he said.
The purpose of poetry, as Harrison sees it, is "to give
pleasure, to make sense of the world land] to keep the
imagination alive for the poet and the reader. In our
world, there's so much mental clutter. Poetry is a place
where the imagination is still thriving."
William Blake once said: A fool sees not the same tree
that a wise man sees.
"The poet," according to Harrison, "wants to make
you sec the tree."

at the Stanford Bookstore during winter quarter.
