# Physics For Poets

They slouched in the last rows of the lecture hall
cultivating a knowing remoteness
but with a secret satisfaction that the class
had been named for them. The professor
unwittingly provided them with phrases,
lines, metaphors, ideas for whole poems.
He spoke in the nasal cartoon voice
of someone who'd been breathing helium,
and his bow tie led them to suspect
his head was a balloon: they imagined it
floating up to the ceiling, where it kept on
chattering about scattering patterns
or how matter is mostly empty space ...
how the sky should be purple and why it isn't.
They pictured a world under that purple sky
populated by red giants and white dwarves
and tiny creatures of various colors
called quarks. A world where the shortest distance
between two points was a curve, where time
slowed down and sped up, and where "wormholes'
led to alternate realities. And all of it
was made of string! They slurped up
that hypothetical vermicelli,
and, thinking of these things, their minds
achieved an asymptotic freedom.
