# Household Spirits
## 
### 
Halfway to heaven, high up on a pole
and the pole planted firmly in the earth,
the martin house in my grandparents' back yard
came back to me on the earth's other side
when I saw the spirit houses in Thailand:
miniature shrines for household gods
placed on stands outside of every house
where the shadow of the house will never fall.
Astrologers determine the exact location
and the right time to perform the ceremony:
flowers are scattered and ritual waters poured
to appease the spirits thought to bring
happiness and prosperity to the household.
But if everything is not done properly
they can do evil and haunt the house itself.
"Good spirits will not live where there is dirt,"
a Shaker saying goes, and I remember
my grandfather telling me the birds
would refuse the house if it wasn't neat enough.
But they hadn't refused it, and a colony
of purple martins lived in the many compartments —
flighty Utopians, the spirits of that farmhouse,
gathering overhead in buoyant swarms,
water in their voices, sky on their wings.
