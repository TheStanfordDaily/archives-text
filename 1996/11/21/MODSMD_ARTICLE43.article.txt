"The element of truth behind nil this, which
people nre so ready to disavow, is that men are
not gentle creatures who want to be loved, and
who at the most can defend themselves if they
are attacked; they are, on the contrary, crea
tures among whose instinctual endowments is
to be reckoned a powerful share of aggressive
ness. As a result, their neighbor is for them not
only a potential helper or sexual object, but
also someone who tempts them to satisfy their
aggressiveness to him, to exploit his capacity
for work without compensation, to use him
sexually without his consent, to seize his pos
sessions, to humiliate him, to cause him pain,
to torture and to kill him." — Sigmund Freud,
"Civilization and its Discontents."
The American appetite for violence has
proven insatiable. Hollywood filmmakers
diffuse the responsibility of creating and dis
seminating violent images with their stock
yet accurate response: violence sells.
The complex link between art and life
leads us to ask: What causes our love affair
with violence, and what is the role of popular
film in that equation?
On Tuesday, the Stanford Film Society
will host Prof. Philip Zimbardo, longtime re
searcher in social psychology, as he gives a
talk on film violence and real-life perpetra
tion of evil. Following the talk will be a

screening of Francis Ford Coppola's 1979
film "Apocalypse Now," the Vietnam adapta
tion of Joseph Conrad's novel, "Heart of
Darkness."
Zimbardo's talk and the showing of
"Apocalypse Now" will be the first in a two
part series on psychology and violence in
film, the second of which will feature Stan
ford Prof. Albert Bandura in February.
During a recent lecture to a social psy
chology class, Zimbardo, dressed all in black,
with sunken blue eyes and a goatee looked
like the perfect person to speak on, as he
called it,"The Psychology of Evil." He talked
about his major claim to fame, the Stanford
Prison Experiment.
In the experiment, Zimbardo simulated a
jail and assigned people roles: either guard or
prisoner. Yet Zimbardo said he lost control of
the situation as guards and prisoners started
acting out their roles.
How did the situation come to this? Ac
cording to Zimbardo, many techniques can
be used on the average Joe to compel him to
commit violent acts.
Most importantly, Zimbardo insisted last
Thursday on cracking the myth that some
people are evil and some are not. Instead, he
said, it depends on one's situation.
"We have the capacity to be anything," he
said. "Anything which is compassionate,
kind and heroic, we could do. Anything
which is evil, vile and despicable, we could

do, too." Zimbardo himself jokingly said he
would kill if someone stole his Stanford
parking permit.
According to Zimbardo, film violence re
flects and reinforces images of aggression in
real life.
"People are affected by film in general and
generic ways," he said. "It's not like you see a
shooting and go and shoot someone, but
films can influence a kind of lifestyle. Clark
Gable took off his shirt once, I think, and the
undershirt business went sky-high."
But just as film influences our lives and
sometimes changes our reality, reality influ
ences film.
"Filmmakers are people who live in a so
cial context, and their ideas come from their
experiences and their environment," he said.
One way that people can be compelled to
commit acts of violence, which many film
makers demonstrate, is a technique called
"deindividuation." In deindividuation, an
image of an animalistic, nonhuman enemy is
created in someone's mind so that the person
can more easily do violence to the enemy.
In order to achieve deindividuation in his
prison experiment, Zimbardo used the same
type of sunglasses he saw in "Cool Hand
Luke." When Paul Newman's character was
in prison, silver reflective sunglasses blocked
the eyes of the chain gang supervisor, making
him seem anonymous. Hut that image can
also be found every day on the streets, ac

cording to Zimbardo.
"Our experiment, which mimics reality,
starts off from an idea of a movie," he said,
referring to "Cool Hand Luke." "We used
sunglasses to create the deindividuation of
our guards, but real police officers and
guards are using those glasses."
According to Zimbardo, if you can disen
gage someone's morality and make her feel
that she is not responsible for the act, you can
convince her to behave violently. These and
others are the same manipulations Hitler
and Stalin used, and the ones every country
uses in training its soldiers for war.

"In Sam
Keene's film
'Faces of the

tnemy,
someone says, 'My most important weapon
was my image of the enemy,' " said Zimbar
do. "All individual violence pales against col
lective violence. By various tactics, nations
get young men to kill other young men when
they normally say killing is wrong."
Both Zimbardo and Stanford Film Society
President Jonathan Levitt, a junior psycholo
gy major, claim that when people are not
paying attention, they are prone to the some

times negatively influential effects of film.
That's why, Levitt claims, it's necessary to
present film in a context outside the average
movie theater.
"We are going to be presenting a film in an
academic context, and we hope people will
watch this film more critically," said Levitt.
"Unless you tell people, they don't pay atten
tion to camera angle, shot, lighting. Society
as a whole is film-illiterate. 'They watch films
and glaze over. The films are having an effect
on them, but people don't stop to consider
that effect. In a lot of ways, it can be a devas
tating effect."
Film can be just as much a tool of propa
ganda as the various posters that were hung
during World War 11, depicting the Japan
ese and the Germans as monsters and
rapists. However, according to Levitt, most
of the American population is unaware of
the power of film and the mass consump
tion of film in this culture is dangerously
mindless.
"Every shot in a film of quality is planned
out and given a lot of thought," said Levitt.
"But by people watching films, everything is
just taken in instantaneously and without
much thought. Popular filmmakers have
tremendous power because nobody in their
audience really cares to parse the elements in
their films. They take them at face value, and
look at them descriptively instead of analyti
cally."
In his talk next week, Zimbardo will use a
number of popular film clips from through
out the last century, including the 1964 ver
sion of "Lord of the Flies," "Shane," "The
Wild Bunch," "White Heat," "Full Metal Jack
et," "Cool Hand Luke" and "Faces of the
Enemy."
Zimbardo, like Levitt, said that film can
have a large impact on our thought process
es, whether we realize it or not.
"Films arc the most powerful way we have
to create and sustain stereotypes," Zimbardo
said. "It's not a direct influence; it's not ratio
nal. It's a visual image which is emotional. It
hits below the belt, if you will, and it makes
violence more normative. Anything that is
not opposing the climate of violence in
America is contributing to it."
In fact, Levitt conceived of the Stanford
Film Society, which is in its second year, as a
way to raise consciousness about film and its
effects.
"I came to Stanford and was absolutely
shocked at the fact that there was not a film
program and not even film courses in sub
stantial numbers," Levitt said. "Film is just
not taken seriously here. Our task is

tremendous then. We're trying to fulfill the
goals of a film production program, a film
studies program and a film society of stu
dents."
The film society has brought many films
to campus, such as last year's "Kids" and thi
recent "Girls' Town." The society decided tc
show "Apocalypse Now" in the context ol
Zimbardo's talk because of the film's depic
tion of war and cult psychology. The filrr
stars Martin Sheen as a government hitmar

sent to Vietnam to execute Marlon Brando, a
colonel who has created a cult around him
self as a tribal god in a secluded jungle hide
out.
The event has been publicized throughout
Northern California to the psychology com
munity as well as to various organizations in
volved in nonviolence.
but Zimbardo is his own best advertiser.
"It will be a whole night," he said, "of evil
and aggression."
