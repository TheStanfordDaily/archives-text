## Social Climbing Social Distortion reaches new heights with a uniquely rebellious sound 
### 
In a scene full of punk-rock posers creating embellished hard-luck
stories to sell mediocre products, Social Distortion is a rare thing in
deed: the genuine article.
In the 1 s>S3 punkrockumentary "Another State Of Mind," frontman
Mike Ness is a 19-year-old alcoholic whose band (the first version of
Social D) is disintegrating around him. Somehow the group survived,
but since then Social I) have endured drug problems, personal tragedy
and massive lineup changes; Ness even saw a few years of prison time.
These problems have greatly limited the bands productivity — this
is only their fifth LP in 15 years — and kept them from attaining the
kind of success that many lesser bands have enjoyed. That's too bad:
"Telling Them" and "All The Answers," from their first album, are
probably two of the best adolescent-rebellion songs ever, while "Ball
And Chain" and "Story Of My Life" from 1990s rockabilly-tinged
eponymous release are lonesome-drifter country music done better
than anyone since Johnny Cash.
1 suppose this release, heavily promoted on MTV and radio, could
be viewed as Social D's attempt to cash in. But what the hell, they de
serve it. And this is a worthy record to sell out with.
Social Distortion's music has long mixed punk with musical and
thematic elements from country, blues and other older sounds, and
this album continues that experimentation. "White Light" turns away
from some of this country influence, however, creating a dark, melan
choly sound that is neither the simple punk of the band's earliest re
leases nor the rockabilly of their later work.
"White Light" is no longer punk, but simply rebel music, bringing
punk's adolescent rage into the longer American outlaw tradition of
artists like Cash, Hank Williams or Woody Cuthrie. On songs like
"Through These Eyes," Ness draws on the experiences of his hard life
and translates them into powerful, compelling music, revealing a man
who is world-weary but still hopeful, tired of life's injustices but still
angry.
Like the testimonial of a hard-luck inmate or a Skid Row bum set to
music, "White Light" tells a universal tale of failure, disappointment,
hope and redemption, injected with an invigorating dose of'9os rage
and cynicism.
