# THE
						PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
## "II" 
### 
There's something to be said for knowing
what you are, even if it's not particularly am
bitious or earth-shattering. With that in
mind on "II" — their second outing since
their breakthrough into the rock mainstream
last year — The Presidents of the United
States of America comfortably crank out
slightly quirky alt-pop and leave the business
of making serious music to others.
When The Presidents first made their
stamp by singing unpretentious odes like
"Peaches," they were heralded as a refreshing
break from the nihilistic cloud of grunge
copycats. Some critics even hastened to label
The Presidents as hometown heirs to post-
Nirvana Seattle.

On "II" The Presidents continue to sing
about mundane topics and images — treated
with a dose of high school smartass-edness, a
competent though limited repertoire of gui
tar and drums, and a slightly dark undercur
rent of cheerful absurdity. This would all be
well and good, except that "II" suffers from
above-average repetition. The kind of repeti
tion where the tone of the lyrics and the
music itself blend together into indistin
guishable mush.
Occasionally The Presidents hit on some
thing fresh and funny. "Lunatic to love"
springs to mind: "I said I loved you and I told
you on a Tuesday /1 dropped you off at the
asylum on a Friday / You looked like hell, hut
I said that you looked OK."
For the most part, however, they seem to
be content dropping too many opaquely silly
lines without much explanation, i.e., on
"Puffy Little Shoes": "Little puffy cloud with
a tongue / Floatin' over a cheese puff rug a
lug / If I had a choice between the two / I'd
obviously choose the one with the puffy little
shoes." I don't mean to be a party pooper, but
what the hell is "cheese puff rug a lug"?
Most notably, "II" shows the stretch

marks of a hand in progress. The Presidents'
style on this album oscillates between happy
brattiness and unrealized depth. The
strongest songs of the set occur when The
Presidents commit to one or the other.
"L.1.P." captures the best of their infec
tious absurdity with lyrics like "Freckles and
eyes of brown / I'll take a big patty of cow."
On the other end, "Froggie" hints at that fa
vorite topic of the newly successful: the ef
fects of fame on the self-destructive. Unfor
tunately, the song doesn't say anything new
about the topic, save for being grounded by a
bright and speedy guitar riff.
"II" is ultimately ear-candy that gets old
real fast, making no lasting impression.
