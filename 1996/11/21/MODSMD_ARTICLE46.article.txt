# KORN
## Life is Peachy MORE MUSIC 
### 
It's hard to put together a sound that isn't

imitating something else. Whenever one lis
tens to a group, the ear immediately attempts
to configure the sound to something that is
familiar or recognizable.
Korn, however, is not explicitly derivative
of any single group. The band has a fresh,
original sound that branches into other
forms of music without losing the substance
of what it does best.
What makes Korn unique is their spastic
bursts of adrenaline combined with dark and
disturbing lyrics and the amazing voice of
Jonathan Davis, who also blows a mean bag
pipe on a few tracks. Davis yells, screams,
whispers, sings, growls; he does it all.
Without a doubt, Davis is the most emo
tional and dynamic singer in rock today.
Many artists just read lyrics off a piece of
paper in tunc to a sound, but Davis becomes
one with the music. Unlike lesser singers,
Davis has something to get off of his chest. He
sings like he really means it and the audience
can recognize this sincerity. Davis is not held
back by the rest of his band — the instru
mental complement the vocals, and the two
make the other stronger. It is a perfect mesh
of angry rock harmony, for everyone in the

group is an outstanding artist.
Throughout the album, Korn naturally
varies the rhythms and tempos. Good CDs
hold on to diversity while still maintainingan
underlying flavor or theme, and this Korn
does extremely well. There are no poor songs
on "Life is Peachy"; all contribute something
to the overall sound and can stand on their
own feet as excellent tracks. Deftones lead
singer Chino Moreno joins Korn on the best
track of the album, a cover of the Ice Cube
song "Wicked."
Unlike bands that are unable to be consis
tent from album to album, Korn has main
tained the intensity they kicked off with their
self-titled debut album in 1994. Korn's first
release was an outstanding album, but "Life is
Peachy" takes the group to another level.
With this album, they build on their previous
sound, grow musically and exceed expecta
tions. To top it all off, the CD has multimedia
for Windows 95 users. A truly excellent re
lease.
