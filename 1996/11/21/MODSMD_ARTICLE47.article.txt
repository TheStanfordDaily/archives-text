# THE 						HEADS
## "No Talking Just Head" 
### 
The late '70s American punk movement,
which built upon the loud guitar chords and
incisive social commentary of the Velvet Un
derground, the Stooges and the Sex Pistols,
offered a welcome alternative to both the ba
nality of disco music and the bombast of
post-'6os rock. The band Talking Heads was
punk's nerdy little brother.
The Talking Heads, three art school
dropouts and a Harvard grad, dressed preppy

and sang songs about psycho killers, snobby
college students and perhaps the greatest
anti-punk (and therefore oh-so-punk) an
them, "Don't Worry About the Govern
ment." Thanks to lead singer and guitarist
David Byrne's interest in different musical
traditions and the band's association with
producer Brian Eno, they moved seamlessly
through pop, punk, funk and African
rhythms, releasing four nearly perfect al
bums before their quasi-breakup after the
breathtaking "Remain in Light."
Thus when it was announced that the
band minus Byrne would release an album
called "No Talking lust Head" the public met
the news with both anticipation and trepida
tion, not to mention litigation, as Byrne
threatened to sue the band for using the
name. All 1 can say about the result is that if
you buy the album, you'll want to sue them,
too.
"No Talking Just Head" is based around
the horribly misconceived idea of having the
three original band members, plus the terri
ble guitarist "Blast" Murray, record musical
tracks and then have various vocalists, in
cluding ex-punk Richard Hell and Ed Kowal
czyk of Live, write and sing lyrics. The con
cept doesn't work on either level.
One of the things that was so distinctive
about the Talking Heads' sound was
Byrne's interest in guitar rhythms rather
than extended guitar solos. Murray offers
instead bland guitar that is indistinguish
able from any other you've heard. The best
songs on the album sound like something
the Talking Heads would have thrown out,
such as "The King is Gone" which rips its
deep groove out of the Talking Heads out
take "Popsicle."
The album's most profound failure is on
the lyrical level. There were times when I
could not believe that someone would actu
ally write these lyrics. For instance in "Never

Mind" Richard Hell sings, "You got me
hooked, I admit it, it's true/ but the hooks are
liquid, I can slip 'em, they're glue." Then
there's the "shocking" lyrics of "No More
Lonely Nights" in which a lonely woman
plans to buy a dog to have sex with, but in
stead purchases a goldfish.
Basically all I can say is don't buy this
album. Get one of the Talking Heads' first
four albums, listen to it over and over and
forget this ever happened.
