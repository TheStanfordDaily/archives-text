# PHIL COLLINS
## "Dance into the Light" 
### 
"Dance into the Light" is a crucial album
for Phil Collins; his last effort (the lachry
mose, self-pitying "Both Sides") flopped, and
he went through a nasty divorce and subse
quently left his bandmates in Genesis. Fortu
nately, these crises seem to have stirred him
from his self-complacent malaise, and the
end result is his best album since 1985's
blockbuster "No Jacket Required."
This time around, Collins has jettisoned
his trademark drum machine and keyboard
ambiance for a loose, funky (lots of horns)
organic sound. Most interesting, though, are
the African / Caribbean poly-rhythms scat
tered across about half the songs. While he
certainly isn't the first rock artist to sample
from this genre — Paul Simon and Peter
Gabriel were here a decade ago — the pure,
unadulterated joy springing from these up
beat tunes makes up for their lack of concep
tual originality.
The album opens with the title track, a
catchy, horn-driven anthem alternately
about the end of South African apartheid or
Collins' new musical independence. Song
two, "That's What You Said" introduces a
mid-'6os Beatle-ish sound that carries about
a third of the disc. It's a complete departure
from the sophisticated art-rock he pioneered
with Genesis, but again the charm and verve
of these songs are totally captivating.
1 count several other gems in the remain
ing songs, from the hilarious, danceable
"Wear My Hat," to the insidious funk groove
of "lust Another Story" to the emotional
"Oughta Know by Now," which contains a
stunning vocal performance by Collins
against a sleek, hypnotic musical back
ground.
Unfortunately, any close perusal of the
lyric sheet reveals some serious deficiencies.
In his best work on prior albums, Collins
lyrics aimed more for mood through spooky
repetition ("In the Air Tonight") or for sim
ple, plaintive verities of the heart ("Against
All Odds"). Here, Collins gets specific and
goes after the Big Issues, and the result is a
maudlin, self-righteous mess.
It's fitting, then, that the best song on the
album, a driving remake ot Dylan's "The
Times They Are a Changin ," should find
Collins breathing new life into words 30 years
old. Singing in a gritty and urgent tone,
Collins seems to have re-found the redemp
tive power of song.
