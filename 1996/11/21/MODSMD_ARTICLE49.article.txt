# ARCHERS OF LOAF
## "All The Nations Airports" 
### 
"If you don't have anything nice to say,
don't say anything at all." Now there's a piece
of advice that the Archers of Loaf never paid
any mind. They're the hand that most readily
comes to mind when any discussion of the
"negative" aspects of indie-rock arises. The
Archers intentionally sabotage their songs
with noise and splintered structures, sing ob
tuse lyrics that rip on the stupidity of others
and wallow in their own wretched pathos.
Such qualities may be virtues or faults, de
pending on your point of view, but the
Archers are so unapologetic about it that the
distinction hardly matters.
The Archers have made a career out of
confounding expectations and frustrating
listeners. Their clanging, wobbly guitar dis
sonance walks a fine line between brilliance
and incompetence, and guitarist/vocalist
Eric Bachmann barks and sobs his way
through songs populated with innocent fools
and disgraced losers.
On early releases, the Archers attacked
their guitars and song subjects with giddy
fervor, molding teen-age anthems from
seemingly tossed-off noise. "Vee Vee," their
last album, retained some of their anthemic
vibe while trading energy for more creative
guitar interplay. On their newest release, "All
The Nations Airports," the Archers turn into
complete curmudgeons, plumbing the
depths ofdespair in search of some late-night
drunken epiphany.
Whether painting a nightmarish portrait
of drunk airline pilots, terrorist scum and
zombified tourists (the title track), evoking
the resignation that accompanies working in
the retail sector ("Rental Sting") or spinning
gloomy tales of death and lurking evil
("Chumming The Ocean" and "Distance
Comes In Droves"), the Archers are depress
ing even when they rock out. But if you get
fed up with all their negativism, the la/y, beau
tiful "Scenic Pastures" delivers the aforemen
tioned epiphany in spades, unironically and

passionately.
For anyone who has come to terms with
their own weaknesses toward self-pity and un
apologetic bitchiness, the Archers of Loaf are
the perfect band for your disenchanted world.
