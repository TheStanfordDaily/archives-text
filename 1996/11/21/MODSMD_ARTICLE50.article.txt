# THE 						CULT
## "High Octane Cult" 
### 
According to '90s musical fashion, there is
only one thing worse than a heavy-metal
band, and that is a pretentious heavy-metal
band. Spandex and big hair may now be the
cultural disaster of the '80s, as polyester and
platform shoes were in the '70s, but at least
heavy-metal doesn't usually take itself too seri
ously.
In the '80s, groups either became party
bands (like AC/DC and Def Leppard) or
dipped into campy Satanism (like Metallica
and Iron Maiden). However, an ugly middle
ground existed where bands insisted that
heavy-metal be treated as "art." Essentially,
they were trying to follow the path Led Zep
pelin had broken, with its blues-based, exper
imental hard-rock. Unfortunately, most of
these bands weren't even half as good.
Such is the problem faced by the Cult, who

try very hard to prove that they descend from
the same blues-rock pedigree as Led Zeppelin.
Avoiding obvious use of synthesizers, the
bands "proves" its integrity with fuzzy bass,
propulsive drums and vaguely artistic lyrics.
Walking a very thin line, the Cult tries to ex
periment with psychedelia, but only without
"selling out" to the excesses of art-rock. The
result is a very stiff sound, where one is in
standy aware that the music itself is much less
important than what it tries to represent.
With the release of their greatest hits
album, "High Octane Cult," the band is given
a chance to show if their sound and fury signi
fies anything.
On a few tracks, the band succeeds, such as
with "The Witch," where the rhythm section
lays down an irresistibly organic groove.
However, for each success, there are multi
ple failures, such as "Revolution," where a
forced melody is tied to equally forced lyrics.
The group's defining moment, however,
might come with "Heart of Soul," which can
best be described as Bon Jovi for intellectuals.
Power ballads have always been a little too self
important, but this grandiose effort takes that
tendency to new extremes.
Judging from this overly long (70-plus
minutes) career retrospective, the Cult desper
ately want you to believe that they are an im
portant band.
Don't be fooled.
