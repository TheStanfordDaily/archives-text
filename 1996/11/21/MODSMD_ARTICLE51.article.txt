# LOVE SPIRALS DOWNWARDS
## "Ever" 
### 
It's raining on Earth again, and the ever
ethereal Projekt Records has recently released
Love Spirals Downwards' new album, "Ever,"
so that there now should exist a soundtrack to
match the falling of water and the clouding of
once-clear skies.
Yet, "Ever" is not as painfully depressing as
one who likes music to mourn to might like.
First, there is no lyric sheet included so one has
to guess at bits of melancholia such as "all my
thoughts are broken." Second, the music is
largely guitar-oriented, and a continual
strumming auditory experience is simply not
conducive to howling.
The other way of rating ethereal music is
how good it is to have sex to: Is it beautiful
enough to turn you on even if your partner is
a monstrosity? Once again, the answer in the
case of "Ever" is not always. It is a pleasant
album and arousing at points, but not one to
make you fall in love with Bill Gates' face if he
doesn't offer you his money.
Singer Suzanne Perry's soprano voice is en
chanting, but "Ipomoea," "Ananda" and "Cay

at Dawn," three of the more effective songs, are
instrumental. The first is short and clear, cool
in its clarity and impact; the last must be a
love-lost song, with no words to cloud pure
emotions; "Ananda" puts the listener in a
beautiful mental state and keeps her spinning
there until it is almost physically unbearable.
Songs such as "Promises" and "Madras"
are enticing, but musically not that complex or
interesting. They are repetitive and comfort
able: "Madras" is more electronically oriented
than most of the rest of the album, with outer
space-ish reverberations mixed with a goddess
deity voice and enough of a beat to make you
wriggle if not dance.
What truly brings "Ever" down from the
mythical experience an ethereal album should
be are its obvious influences and its tendency to
wards whiny-ness. Listening to "Ever" the first
time, one wonders if perhaps one couldn't have
just broken out an old Cranes or Cure album;
songs like "Sideways Forest" have just been done
too many times to hold any interest "El Pedre
gal" and "Last Classic" arc tritely unhappy-girl
ish — they diminish the effect of really malcon
tent songs such as "Above the Lone."
"Ever" is a good effort by Love Spirals
Downwards (they get points for trying), but it
is not consistent enough in its effect to make it
extraordinary. For the collector of ethereal
music, it is a must, but the average Joe looking
for a rainy CD could do much better.
