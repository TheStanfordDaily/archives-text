# 'Pet' me
## Tori Amos talks about her new label and the band she's backing 
### Liz Chien 
Tori Amos is growing. Expanding. Experi
menting. With her own record label, Igloo
Records, Amos reveals some business savvy to
complement her ethereal image as a singer
and songwriter.
Amos' launched Igloo Records at a time
when she was beginning to tire of "simply
being an artist." However, it was not until
manager Arthur Spivack played for Amos a
tape of L.A.-based alterna-pop band, Pet, in
early 1995, that the seed for Igloo Records was
planted.
Amos immediately identified with the ur
gent croons of Pet's lead singer, Lisa Pap
ineau. "I have never heard a girl scream like
that and have that beautiful range of fluidity
that she has also," said Amos.
"The prospect that some cheesy producer
would come along and make Pet into the
band he wanted Pet to be, instead of what
they really are, saddened me."
The result?
Amos and Spivack formed Igloo Records
(under the Atlantic Group) to ensure that Pet
would still have personal reign over their mu
sical urges and ex-

plore the "tier in their
soul."
"They refuse to be
victims, and you can
hear in their music
what they've been
through," said Amos.
Her attraction and
relation to Pet tran
scends being a men
tor. "Pet expresses
certain things that
I've always wanted to
. . . like sitting at
brunch with a hunch
of ministers after
church and my
mother serving
chicken dinner, and
everyone telling me
to pull down my skirt
and that I was a bad
girl... Then I would
hear Lisa's scream
and think, 'Where
were you 25 years
ago?' "
Amos' preoccupa
tion with the church
comes as no surprise.
The daughter of a
Methodist preacher
in North Carolina,
Amos experienced
first-hand the trial
and tribulations of
religion, such that it
has become the foun
dation for many of
her songs.
"I haven't made
peace with the
church. The institu-

tion is intrinsically evil, and this has nothing
to do with Jesus and his teachings," said
Amos.
Instead, it has to do with the idea that the
church is a vehicle that "programs us to think
in certain ways that keep us controlled .... I
don't have time for domination and control,"
Amos said.
"The misnomer of religion is it keeps us all
separate in a hierarchy. Everyone has different
skills, but why should that make anyone bet
ter than another? People should be honored
for what they do. Because of money, people
have forgotten what it was like at the begin
ning.
"Our purpose in life is to look for the be
ginning state — to try to find the truth and be
honorable. That's what I'm trying to do."
Amos searches for this peace through her
music and her philosophy. "We're taught
how to think but are never given the tools on
how to learn, how to think. Sometimes, we
just suck things up without really thinking
why."
Amos' proclivity for self-reflection and
profound contemplation does not come as a
surprise. A child prodigy on the piano who
was sent off to the prestigious Peabody Con

servatory in Baltimore at the age of 5, then ex
pelled at age 11, because her music was con
sidered too "radical," Amos has been at
tempting to understand the world around her
for much of her life.
Striving for balance, Amos is trying to "re
see" everything that she's judged her whole life.
"I find that when I [re-see], people who are
usually really aggressive will soften up and talk
to me. The more open you are, this will shift to
other people."
This attitude — a combination of wide
eyed honesty and gut-instinct survival — car
ries over to Amos' professional life.
She gives Pet enough room to form their
own sound and style within Igloo's influential
sphere. "When it's another artist's work, you
can't dictate what their music should sound
like. In the end, you always respect the hand,"
said Amos.
Does she respect them enough to let Pet
open for her?

"It would never be about that. Pet is a dif
ferent kind of live experience. It's important
that people sit down at my shows, hut Pot is
very much about a niosh pit. It's a different
kind of energy. Pet wants you to be standing
up and jumping on stage. I want to be taking
a journey with you.
"It's a different type of experience when
people are jostling you around. If someone
starts screaming during one of my stings, Ill
have their balls! You can't mix milk and pork,
me being pork. I have to respect what Pet's]
needs are," explained Amos.
More than understanding the nuances of
strong artist dynamics, Amos has a good un
derstanding of what her project needs to suc
ceed, and does not mind using her clout to
promote Igloo Records.
As the always passionate, graphic and in
teresting Amos succinctly described the situ
ation: "Igloo is still nursing from my left
breast."
