## In Love and War How the novel that everyone said couldn't be filmed became the year's most anticipated love story 
### Wendy Lee 
"There tire stories the man recites quietly into the room which slip
from level to level like a hawk. He wakes in the painted arbour that sur
rounds him with its spilling flowers, arms of great trees. He remembers
picnics, a woman who kissed parts of his body that now are burned into
the colour of aubergine "
Imagine that you're a director and your task is to translate the
above passage, from the novel "The English Patient," into film. At first
glance, it doesn't look so bad; you've got some pretty strong images to
work with. But then, you think, how on earth are you going to make
a movie that soars (figuratively) like a hawk?
This was the monumental task that director Anthony Minghella
faced when he set out to make Michael Ondaatje's Booker Prize-win
ning novel into a film that would remain faithful to the book's essence
and appeal to a cinematic audience. It's definitely not an easy
tightrope to walk.
At the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, Minghella is still feeding
off the enthusiasm generated by the previous night's premiere of "The
English Patient." When he talks about the film, you can tell that he's
got more than four years of his life and $30,000 invested in it. 1 le gen
uinely wants to give the audience something worthwhile.
"Two things are simultaneously true," Minghella said. "Audiences
are incredibly intelligent and they also get lost very quickly, lust as
when we, filmmakers in the audience, get pleasure from asking ques
tions and making connections and being taken seriously, so do the au
dience. We should imagine that they are no different from us."
This is Minghella's third time out; he previously directed the ro
mantic comedies "Truly, Madly, Deeply" in 1991 and "Mr. Wonder
ful" in 1993. "The English Patient" is also a romance but one that
shifts among the different levels of perspective, location and time.
The novel, set in Italy at the end of World War 11, involves a young
nurse named Hanaand an anonymous, badly burned patient who ap
pears to be English. Two other people join their sanctuary: a Sikh
bomb-defuser named Kip and a morphine-addicted thief, David
Caravaggio, who knew Hana's father. Through flashbacks, the char
acters reveal the intricate personal histories that have led them to this
moment of reconciliation.
The film chooses to juxtapose the storylines of Nana (Juliette
Binoche) and the "English patient" (Ralph Fiennes), largely leaving
the stories of Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe)
on the cutting room floor. Now the focus is on the English patient's
past as Count Lazlo de Almasy, a desert explorer who had a tumul

tuous affair with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott
Thomas).
At the risk of sounding like a studio agent from Robert Altman's
" The Player," this film is "Out of Africa" meets "Lawrence of Arabia"
meets "A Farewell to Arms."
Although Minghella first read "The English Patient" as a fan of the
author and not as a filmmaker, he couldn't help noticing the "cuts" on
the page from one scene to the next that allow the book to take on a
myriad of themes.
"This book is a book which insists on saying look at that and then
look at the world," he said. "Look at what you say to me and then look
at the way the world works. Look at [how] our personal fidelities, our
personal betrayals, our personal complexities arc reflected in history."
In writing the screenplay, Minghella also took into account the ob
vious difference between the experience of reading a novel and watch
ing a film.
"You can't do that thing in a film where you can read at your own
pace," he said. "In a film you have to experience it as it washes at you,
and the whole structure of that then becomes the challenge. I low to or
ganize the event so that you get enough but not too much, that you
haven't thinned out the diet so much that it becomes like gruel."
The scope of "The English Patient" is broad visually as well as the
matically. While the film's central love story is the all-consuming affair
between Almasy and Katharine, the camera is also in love with the
morning mist of the Italian landscape and the undulating dunes of the
desert. The desert scenes, in particular, are shot in the kinds of colors

winning novel could be filmed.
you only see when you close your eyes and turn
toward the sun. In the afterimage lies a tangible
sense of loss and longing.
"The innate ability, this contraction and di
lation of the iris that the film has, it can say:
'The geography of a woman's body is the geog
raphy of the world,' " Minghella said. "The fact
that film can do that is an astonishing thing."
Another difference between the structure of
a novel and a film is psychological.
"We think character is very important in
film," Minghella said. "In this novel, characters
actually are very elusive. You'd be hard-pressed
now to show me 12 pages of behavior in the
novel.
"Most of it is working at a much, much
more fractured level than that."
Despite his attempts to restructure and sim
plify the storyline, Minghella said that people
were bewildered by the screenplay when he
first delivered it to I lollywood studios.
"It doesn't observe any of the rules," he said.
"It doesn't have an act structure. In relation
ship to the novel, it is incredibly prosaic and
linear, and in relation to Hollywood screen
plays it's this sort of chaotic thing."
Minghella also emphasized the fact that
Hollywood is very good at what it does —
which is making sure you get your money
back.
"If you were Michael Ondaatje," he said,
"you have a pen and a piece of paper; and to do
your work, you can doanythingyou want to do
anvwhere in the world. If you're me and you

want to make films, you can do anything you
want, just you need to defer to your $30 or $40
million to do it with. And so necessarily you
collide with the fact that to do your job you
need to persuade a lot of other people to invest
in you."
But Minghella doesn't blame Hollywood
for not taking risks, nor does he begrudge peo
ple who don't have faith in his film because it
does take risks.
"II it was my money and somebody called
me and said, 'Hi, listen, we've got this film; it's
got no American film stars in it, the guy's in
bed for half the film, it's a memory film, it's set
in Europe, it's lyrical, it's fragmented, it's ambi
tious, it talks about moral conundrum, it's try
ing to talk about history, it's trying to talk about
the relationship between the private world and
the public world, and it costs a lot of money,' I'd
say, 'You know what — um — what else are
you offering?'"
When the film was finally picked up by a
studio, another conflict ensued over who
should play the part of Katharine Clifton.
While Minghella had a definite idea of whom
to play Almasy, he felt that there were many ac
tresses who could have done the role of
Katharine justice.
"One of the sadnesses of being a filmmaker
is that for every good part for a woman there
are 20 good parts for a man," Minghella ex
plained. "For every good actor there are 20
good actresses."
The part eventually went to the relatively

unknown British actress Thomas, although
not without some snags along the way.
"Everybody wanted to do it and nobody
wanted me to do it, basically, apart from An
thony [Minghella] and Saul [Zaentz, the pro
ducer] and Ralph [Fiennes]," said Thomas. "1
think there was a terrible problem at one point
when the studio who was backing the film in
the beginning said, 'OK, well, if you insist on
having her then we're out of here.' So they lost
the studio."
Thomas had a pragmatic explanation for
the studio's decision. "They wanted a big star,
which I understand. I mean, it's business."
Eventually, Miramax picked up the film and
Thomas. Ironically, she is the actor who's been
receiving the most press for her performance,
perhaps because no one expected her to get the
part in the first place.
In spite of the media attention that the film

is receiving, "The English Patient" remains
constant to Minghella's original vision. His
imagined pitch to Hollywood sensibilities in
corporates his own work ethic.
"I'd say it has war, it has love, it has intrigue,
it has spies, it has sex... Its a great rich meal in
itself, and I love films who've got all those
things. I love to go to see those movies.
"But there's something in this |film) that
has to do with the fact that it gives you a lot and
it asks a lot. And that's the kind of film that I
like to go and see myself. In the end, all you can
do is try and make a film you'd like to see your
self."
And what is so special about "The English
Patient" that makes it that kind of film?
"It's trying to say films can be ambitious,
films can be dense, films can reward you emo
tionally and intellectually; they can and we as
pire to that," Minghella said.
"There tire stories the man recites quietly into the room which slip
from level to level like a hawk. He wakes in the painted arbour that sur

Binoche) and the "English patient" (Ralph Fiennes), largely leaving
the stories of Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe)

Thomas).
At the risk of sounding like a studio agent from Robert Altman's
" The Player," this film is "Out of Africa" meets "Lawrence of Arabia"
meets "A Farewell to Arms."
Although Minghella first read "The English Patient" as a fan of the
author and not as a filmmaker, he couldn't help noticing the "cuts" on
the page from one scene to the next that allow the book to take on a
myriad of themes.
"This book is a book which insists on saying look at that and then
look at the world," he said. "Look at what you say to me and then look
at the way the world works. Look at [how] our personal fidelities, our
personal betrayals, our personal complexities arc reflected in history."
In writing the screenplay, Minghella also took into account the ob
vious difference between the experience of reading a novel and watch
ing a film.
"You can't do that thing in a film where you can read at your own
pace," he said. "In a film you have to experience it as it washes at you,
and the whole structure of that then becomes the challenge. I low to or
ganize the event so that you get enough but not too much, that you
haven't thinned out the diet so much that it becomes like gruel."
The scope of "The English Patient" is broad visually as well as the
matically. While the film's central love story is the all-consuming affair
between Almasy and Katharine, the camera is also in love with the
morning mist of the Italian landscape and the undulating dunes of the
desert. The desert scenes, in particular, are shot in the kinds of colors

you only see when you close your eyes and turn
toward the sun. In the afterimage lies a tangible
sense of loss and longing.
"The innate ability, this contraction and di
lation of the iris that the film has, it can say:
'The geography of a woman's body is the geog
raphy of the world,' " Minghella said. "The fact
that film can do that is an astonishing thing."
Another difference between the structure of
a novel and a film is psychological.
"We think character is very important in
film," Minghella said. "In this novel, characters
actually are very elusive. You'd be hard-pressed
now to show me 12 pages of behavior in the
novel.
"Most of it is working at a much, much
more fractured level than that."
Despite his attempts to restructure and sim
plify the storyline, Minghella said that people
were bewildered by the screenplay when he
first delivered it to I lollywood studios.
"It doesn't observe any of the rules," he said.
"It doesn't have an act structure. In relation
ship to the novel, it is incredibly prosaic and
linear, and in relation to Hollywood screen
plays it's this sort of chaotic thing."
Minghella also emphasized the fact that
Hollywood is very good at what it does —
which is making sure you get your money
back.
"If you were Michael Ondaatje," he said,
"you have a pen and a piece of paper; and to do
your work, you can doanythingyou want to do
anvwhere in the world. If you're me and you

want to make films, you can do anything you
want, just you need to defer to your $30 or $40
million to do it with. And so necessarily you
collide with the fact that to do your job you
need to persuade a lot of other people to invest
in you."
But Minghella doesn't blame Hollywood
for not taking risks, nor does he begrudge peo
ple who don't have faith in his film because it
does take risks.
"II it was my money and somebody called
me and said, 'Hi, listen, we've got this film; it's
got no American film stars in it, the guy's in
bed for half the film, it's a memory film, it's set
in Europe, it's lyrical, it's fragmented, it's ambi
tious, it talks about moral conundrum, it's try
ing to talk about history, it's trying to talk about
the relationship between the private world and
the public world, and it costs a lot of money,' I'd
say, 'You know what — um — what else are
you offering?'"
When the film was finally picked up by a
studio, another conflict ensued over who
should play the part of Katharine Clifton.
While Minghella had a definite idea of whom
to play Almasy, he felt that there were many ac
tresses who could have done the role of
Katharine justice.
"One of the sadnesses of being a filmmaker
is that for every good part for a woman there
are 20 good parts for a man," Minghella ex
plained. "For every good actor there are 20
good actresses."
The part eventually went to the relatively

unknown British actress Thomas, although
not without some snags along the way.
"Everybody wanted to do it and nobody
wanted me to do it, basically, apart from An
thony [Minghella] and Saul [Zaentz, the pro
ducer] and Ralph [Fiennes]," said Thomas. "1
think there was a terrible problem at one point
when the studio who was backing the film in
the beginning said, 'OK, well, if you insist on
having her then we're out of here.' So they lost
the studio."
Thomas had a pragmatic explanation for
the studio's decision. "They wanted a big star,
which I understand. I mean, it's business."
Eventually, Miramax picked up the film and
Thomas. Ironically, she is the actor who's been
receiving the most press for her performance,
perhaps because no one expected her to get the
part in the first place.
In spite of the media attention that the film

is receiving, "The English Patient" remains
constant to Minghella's original vision. His
imagined pitch to Hollywood sensibilities in
corporates his own work ethic.
"I'd say it has war, it has love, it has intrigue,
it has spies, it has sex... Its a great rich meal in
itself, and I love films who've got all those
things. I love to go to see those movies.
"But there's something in this |film) that
has to do with the fact that it gives you a lot and
it asks a lot. And that's the kind of film that I
like to go and see myself. In the end, all you can
do is try and make a film you'd like to see your
self."
And what is so special about "The English
Patient" that makes it that kind of film?
"It's trying to say films can be ambitious,
films can be dense, films can reward you emo
tionally and intellectually; they can and we as
pire to that," Minghella said.
"There tire stories the man recites quietly into the room which slip
from level to level like a hawk. He wakes in the painted arbour that sur
rounds him with its spilling flowers, arms of great trees. He remembers
picnics, a woman who kissed parts of his body that now are burned into
the colour of aubergine "
Imagine that you're a director and your task is to translate the
above passage, from the novel "The English Patient," into film. At first
glance, it doesn't look so bad; you've got some pretty strong images to
work with. But then, you think, how on earth are you going to make
a movie that soars (figuratively) like a hawk?
This was the monumental task that director Anthony Minghella
faced when he set out to make Michael Ondaatje's Booker Prize-win
ning novel into a film that would remain faithful to the book's essence
and appeal to a cinematic audience. It's definitely not an easy
tightrope to walk.
At the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, Minghella is still feeding
off the enthusiasm generated by the previous night's premiere of "The
English Patient." When he talks about the film, you can tell that he's
got more than four years of his life and $30,000 invested in it. 1 le gen
uinely wants to give the audience something worthwhile.
"Two things are simultaneously true," Minghella said. "Audiences
are incredibly intelligent and they also get lost very quickly, lust as
when we, filmmakers in the audience, get pleasure from asking ques
tions and making connections and being taken seriously, so do the au
dience. We should imagine that they are no different from us."
This is Minghella's third time out; he previously directed the ro
mantic comedies "Truly, Madly, Deeply" in 1991 and "Mr. Wonder
ful" in 1993. "The English Patient" is also a romance but one that
shifts among the different levels of perspective, location and time.
The novel, set in Italy at the end of World War 11, involves a young
nurse named Hanaand an anonymous, badly burned patient who ap
pears to be English. Two other people join their sanctuary: a Sikh
bomb-defuser named Kip and a morphine-addicted thief, David
Caravaggio, who knew Hana's father. Through flashbacks, the char
acters reveal the intricate personal histories that have led them to this
moment of reconciliation.
