## In Love and War How the novel that everyone said couldn't be filmed became the year's most anticipated love story

"There tire stories the man recites quietly into the room which slip
from level to level like a hawk. He wakes in the painted arbour that sur
rounds him with its spilling flowers, arms of great trees. He remembers
picnics, a woman who kissed parts of his body that now are burned into
the colour of aubergine "
Imagine that you're a director and your task is to translate the
above passage, from the novel "The English Patient," into film. At first
glance, it doesn't look so bad; you've got some pretty strong images to
work with. But then, you think, how on earth are you going to make
a movie that soars (figuratively) like a hawk?
This was the monumental task that director Anthony Minghella
faced when he set out to make Michael Ondaatje's Booker Prize-win
ning novel into a film that would remain faithful to the book's essence
and appeal to a cinematic audience. It's definitely not an easy
tightrope to walk.
At the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, Minghella is still feeding
off the enthusiasm generated by the previous night's premiere of "The
English Patient." When he talks about the film, you can tell that he's
got more than four years of his life and $30,000 invested in it. 1 le gen
uinely wants to give the audience something worthwhile.
"Two things are simultaneously true," Minghella said. "Audiences
are incredibly intelligent and they also get lost very quickly, lust as
when we, filmmakers in the audience, get pleasure from asking ques
tions and making connections and being taken seriously, so do the au
dience. We should imagine that they are no different from us."
This is Minghella's third time out; he previously directed the ro
mantic comedies "Truly, Madly, Deeply" in 1991 and "Mr. Wonder
ful" in 1993. "The English Patient" is also a romance but one that
shifts among the different levels of perspective, location and time.
The novel, set in Italy at the end of World War 11, involves a young
nurse named Hanaand an anonymous, badly burned patient who ap
pears to be English. Two other people join their sanctuary: a Sikh
bomb-defuser named Kip and a morphine-addicted thief, David
Caravaggio, who knew Hana's father. Through flashbacks, the char
acters reveal the intricate personal histories that have led them to this
moment of reconciliation.
The film chooses to juxtapose the storylines of Nana (Juliette
Binoche) and the "English patient" (Ralph Fiennes), largely leaving
the stories of Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe)
on the cutting room floor. Now the focus is on the English patient's
past as Count Lazlo de Almasy, a desert explorer who had a tumul
