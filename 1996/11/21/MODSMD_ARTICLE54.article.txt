## Thomas and Binoche play against type in 'English Patient' 
### 
Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette
Binoche both live in Paris, have been made
love to onscreen by Ralph Fiennes and star
in"The English Patient." But because the
film has parallel storylines, they actually
don't share any screen time together.
Thomas plays Katharine Clifton, a new
lywed Englishwoman who is seduced by the
heat of the Sahara and Fiennes' very hot
desert explorer. It's a showy role and defi
nitely unlike any that Thomas has played
before.
"When you're playing somebody like
Mattie [from "Angels and Insects"), for ex
ample, or Fiona (from "Four Weddings and
a Funeral"], you've got a big screen in front
of you, so you can be sort of mysterious,"
Thomas said. "Whereas playing Katharine,
you have to be up there with all your wares
on display and be completely open. From
the first shot, you've got to be wonderful."
Thomas first gained attention in 1988 in
an adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's "A Hand
ful of Dust." In "Four Weddings and a Fu
neral," she was secretly in love with Hugh
Grant's erstwhile bachelor; in Roman
Polanski's "Bitter Moon" she was Grant's
repressed wife; in last year's "Angels and In
sects," she played a dowdy governess pining
after a natural historian.
Also last year she starred as one of Tom
Cruise's team members in "Mission: Im
possible" and Lady Anne opposite lan
McKellen in "Richard III." These were both
small and ill-fated roles, but ones which es

tablished Thomas as a cool, undeniably
aristocratic presence.
Because Katharine's character is not
fully delineated in the novel, hers is defi
nitely a difficult presence to establish. She is
essentially a shadow, seen through the haze
of nostalgia and romance. Thomas de
scribed her as "a ghost in the background."
"She's sort of an enigma. And what's so
fantastic about the screenplay is that it
brings this strange mysterious presence,
brings it into flesh and blood and brings
her into the room with you,'' she said.
The screenplay greatly impressed
Thomas.
"There were some fantastic moments
that made you think, 'Wow, I'd love to act
this,' " she said. "There's a moment where
[Katharine and Almasy] are at cricket or
the polo or something, and she's talking to
somebody, and she sends this other person
off to get them a drink and then she says to
him, 'Ravish me.' " Then Thomas quoted,
with a delicious tremor in her voice, " 'It
was as if she had handed him a knife.' "
Director Anthony Minghella found that
Thomas provided the perfect blend of in
trigue and elegance for Katharine.
"With Kristin I think this," he said. "You
have somebody, and I wanted this in
Katharine, whom for every yes you hear the
no sounding, for every maybe there's a
maybe not. She is a much more complex
and elaborate, refined presence [than
Hana], and it's perfect for the film because

all the time what you're trying to do in a
film like this is to create balances."
In delicate contrast to Katharine is
Hana, the young Canadian nurse who takes

care of the English patient in wartime Italy
