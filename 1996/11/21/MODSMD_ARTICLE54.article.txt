## Thomas and Binoche play against type in 'English Patient' 
### 
Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette
Binoche both live in Paris, have been made
love to onscreen by Ralph Fiennes and star
in"The English Patient." But because the
film has parallel storylines, they actually
don't share any screen time together.
Thomas plays Katharine Clifton, a new
lywed Englishwoman who is seduced by the
heat of the Sahara and Fiennes' very hot
desert explorer. It's a showy role and defi
nitely unlike any that Thomas has played
before.
"When you're playing somebody like
Mattie [from "Angels and Insects"), for ex
ample, or Fiona (from "Four Weddings and
a Funeral"], you've got a big screen in front
of you, so you can be sort of mysterious,"
Thomas said. "Whereas playing Katharine,
you have to be up there with all your wares
on display and be completely open. From
the first shot, you've got to be wonderful."
Thomas first gained attention in 1988 in
an adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's "A Hand
ful of Dust." In "Four Weddings and a Fu
neral," she was secretly in love with Hugh
Grant's erstwhile bachelor; in Roman
Polanski's "Bitter Moon" she was Grant's
repressed wife; in last year's "Angels and In
sects," she played a dowdy governess pining
after a natural historian.
Also last year she starred as one of Tom
Cruise's team members in "Mission: Im
possible" and Lady Anne opposite lan
McKellen in "Richard III." These were both
small and ill-fated roles, but ones which es

tablished Thomas as a cool, undeniably
aristocratic presence.
Because Katharine's character is not
fully delineated in the novel, hers is defi
nitely a difficult presence to establish. She is
essentially a shadow, seen through the haze
of nostalgia and romance. Thomas de
scribed her as "a ghost in the background."
"She's sort of an enigma. And what's so
fantastic about the screenplay is that it
brings this strange mysterious presence,
brings it into flesh and blood and brings
her into the room with you,'' she said.
The screenplay greatly impressed
Thomas.
"There were some fantastic moments
that made you think, 'Wow, I'd love to act
this,' " she said. "There's a moment where
[Katharine and Almasy] are at cricket or
the polo or something, and she's talking to
somebody, and she sends this other person
off to get them a drink and then she says to
him, 'Ravish me.' " Then Thomas quoted,
with a delicious tremor in her voice, " 'It
was as if she had handed him a knife.' "
Director Anthony Minghella found that
Thomas provided the perfect blend of in
trigue and elegance for Katharine.
"With Kristin I think this," he said. "You
have somebody, and I wanted this in
Katharine, whom for every yes you hear the
no sounding, for every maybe there's a
maybe not. She is a much more complex
and elaborate, refined presence [than
Hana], and it's perfect for the film because

all the time what you're trying to do in a
film like this is to create balances."
In delicate contrast to Katharine is
Hana, the young Canadian nurse who takes

care of the English patient in wartime Italy

Kristin Scott Thomas makes me smile. What a woman!
For that role, Minghella immediately ap
proached French actress Juliette Binoche.
"1 wanted to find somebody who was like
a glass," Minghella said, "that whatever was
going on would be so transparent that you
would have absolute access to her feelings.
"Juliette doesn't seem to change color to
me when she's working. She finds it so hard
to disguise what she feels. She's somebody
who's such a lightning rod to the truth in her
as an actress."
From her first English-speaking role in
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being" to last
year's French epic "The Horseman on the
Roof," Binoche has established herself as a
versatile actress in both languages. She's
worked with Louis Malle in "Damage" and
Krzys/.tof Kieslowski in "Bleu," in addition
to being the face that has launched a thou
sand Lancome ads.
"1 had faith in the beginning," said
Binoche about her international fame, "faith
not to be famous, faith to do the roles I want
ed to play and meet great directors. It's one
day after the other; you can't plan life."
Binoche found this adage very applicable
to circumstances in Hana's life, when the
character loses some friends early on in the
film to the war.

"Things happen in your life, and you have
to accept it or overcome it to feel better about
it," she said, laughing a little. "I may die to
morrow, who knows, you know. You don't
know, so you have to be as happy as possible
in the present day. That's what 1 learn in life."
While preparing for her role as Hana,
Binoche spoke to many nurses who had
served in burn units during World War 11.
"1 think at that time those nurses were
dealing with their souls and what was hap
pening with the insides of their souls — their
hopes, their despair, their questions — but
not very much about the outside."
In tending Almasy, the English patient,
Hana essentially becomes his body and his
sole connection to the outside world. She
also learns how to let go of some of her fears.
"And that's the healing process of rela
tionships because they're helping one anoth
er," Binoche said. "He needs her as she needs
him, and she needs to forget about her pain
and her loss."
The relationship between Almasy and
Hana sets the stage for all the other relation
ships, whether they be romantic or platonic.
In the end, everything comes down to what
Thomas called "the love of the stranger."
"There's a kind of generosity in this movie
when you watch it," Binoche said. "It's about
human beings ... and at the end of the
movie you feel like going back to life, sharing
the people you love, being simple and start
ing life with what we have."
