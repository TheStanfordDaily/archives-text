## Vanity Fair Streisand turns a 'Mirror' to her own neurosis 
### 
Barbra, how could you?
I'm afraid that although Streisand's latest
starring and directing effort might appear to
be a fascinating meditation about the life of
a single aging woman, "The Mirror Has Two
Faces" is really all schmuck.
It glitters, but it's not gold. Just cheap,
sparkly stuff you can find at a tacky party
store. For what looks like a commentary on
advertising is just a commercial endeavor,
and what seems like a questioning of beauty
standards is just all about tits and ass.
What could be a critical examination of
the American obsession with youth, physical
appearance and romantic love, ends up
being another movie that enforces the status
quo.
The story is about Rose (Streisand), who
despite coming from a family of image-ob
sessed women, is a "competent, no-non
sense, no-frills kind of woman." A wonder
fully talented literature professor at Colum
bia University, she's actually a little too pret
ty and too charismatic to be the dumpy old
maid that the movie would have you believe.
By responding to a classified ad, Rose's
superficial sister (Mimi Rogers) sets her up
with a totally dorky but very good-looking
math professor, Greg (Jeff Bridges), who
after being dumped by File Macpherson, is

totally cynical about women. According to
his philosophical theory, the only way to
make a relationship work is for it to be celi
bate.
So they go on to get married. But Rose,
being a secret romantic, feels unhappy and
frustrated with their sexless marital arrange
ment, sublimating all her problems with
chocolate. She confronts Greg, they tight, he
goes to Europe, she gets a makeover, and I
start throwing up popcorn, trying to make it
to the credits.
I have to admit that the idea that profes
sors could have such pathetic social lives
made me smugly giddy. Hut I'd rather these
characters be pathetic than sell out. When
Rose trades in her healthy appetite for a
plateful of carrots I felt betrayed. This is not
a happy ending — it's tragic.
It's not that the movie is a total bomb. 1
mean, if you like cheesy Hollywood sex
crazed romantic comedies, it's fine. Some
parts of it are actually kind of good; the
humor is quite witty. But at some point I
stopped laughing.
Entertainment is no fun if the message is
philosophically repulsive. The last thing I
need a movie to tell me is that a woman has
no life unless she has a man and that she can't
get a man without blond streaks in her hair.
My advise to Barbra: Take out the blonde,
get a book by Naomi Wolf and get a life.
