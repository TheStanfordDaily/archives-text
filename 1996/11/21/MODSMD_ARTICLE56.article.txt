## 'Microcosmos' takes a tour down insect-land 
### 
French directors Claude Nuridsany and
Marie Perennou bring us this tale of a typ
ical summer day in Aveyron, France, in
which we follow common backyard insects
as they go about their daily business.
In "Microcosmos," all sorts of bugs are
born; they mate, fight and are eaten by
birds and frogs. They fly, swim and crawl in
the meadows and in ponds where most
human traces are absent.
A summer rain brutally interrupts this
peaceful summer day. What would merely
make humans irritated at getting wet takes
the proportion of a natural disaster in the
insect world.
As a raindrop falls on the base ofa leaf, a la
dybird previously resting on its tip is sent
bouncing up in the air and subsequently
rolling off the leaf. I n the aftermath of the cat
astrophe, ants are left trampling in the mud
to clear the debris blocking the entrance ol
the ant-house — debris which depressingly
keeps collapsing back into the hole.
"Microcosmos" is also a catastrophe to
our understanding of the laws of physics.
Water, in particular, seems to behave
strangely at the scale of insects. Social
drinking would be a radically different ex
perience if humans, the size of ants, could
sip from of a big drop of water that one

could hold between his hands. Because ol
our size, we will also never master the tech
nique of building air bubbles in water, like
water spiders, who enter and leave the bub
bles by simply fusing with their "walls."
To transport us into this fascinating
miniature world, two years ol research
were necessary. The crew used computer
ized robot-mounted cameras and other in
novative light and instruments to film
those tiny actors in their outdoor and "stu
dio" environments.
"Microcosmos" features excellent pho
tography, but the music score is what final
ly turns this documentary into a captivat
ing film. Close-ups of snails in a tight em
brace are disturbing by themselves; they
are even more so when accompanied by
the sound of opera. Sounds also include a
mix of real insect recordings and sound ef
fects — a millipede, for instance, is a
marching army — but keeps human nar
rative to an absolute minimum.
"Microcosmos" is a dramatic, passion
ate and above all extremely funny film. In
sects keep stumbling and falling. We can
almost feel the discomfort of a male bee
after he realizes that he's been fooled by an
attractively furry bee-orchid. Its as though
the shooting lasted three years primarily so
that Nuridsany and Perennou could catch
their actors in embarrassing situations.
