# Can't get enough of the Farm
## For some, life at Stanford never ends 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
People scrambling to find jobs
for next year may want to be in on a
secret: There are ways of staying on
the Farm forever.
Senior Damon Silver, a symbolic
systems major, is embarking on his
seventh year as an undergraduate.
Silver hasn't broken from cam
pus for a variety of reasons.
"I took some time off, switched
majors. I wouldn't know what re
union to go to," Silver said. "Al
though I'm graduating this quar
ter, I'll probably still be in the area "
The campus looked very differ
ent when Silver arrived
Silver revealed a not-so-long-lost
campus event concerning Comput
er Science Prof. Stuart Reges.
"He'd write letters to the drug
czar saying, 'I do drugs' and 'I cam
drugs in my backpack,'" Silver said
"The government threatened to cut
off funding so the University looked
for some way to get rid of him.
When Reges took some students
out to dinner and looked the other
way when minors ordered alcohol,
the University fired him "

r unding also played a major role
in the indirect-cost incident, which
still impacts the campus today, Sil
ver said.
"For every dollar that Stanford
spent on research, the government
would pay back 75 percent," Silver
said. "But it's hard to classify 're
search costs' maintaining the fa
cilities and upkeep of the Universi
ty are all part of that. An investiga
tion found that money was being
spent on floral arrangements, a
v lar closet, a yacht. Then '20/20'
the news magazine program)
picked up on it, and then there was
big national scandal."
As a result, government subsi
dies were cut back from 75 percent
to 55 percent. Silver said, which had
an immediate effect on the Univer
sity.
"Tuition costs went up, arts and
humanities suffered, language de
partments were consolidated, de
gree possibilities went away," Sil
ver said. "There were a number of
protests."
With his historical perspective,
Silver offered this advice: "Go out
and meet people. Don't be limited.
Don't be afraid to ask about what's
going on."
Like the pioneers before him, Bill
Stone — who graduated with a
bachelor's in political science in
1967 and an MBA in 1969 — headed
out across the Continental Divide to
get to Stanford in 1963.
"I had never been across the Mis
sissippi before," said Stone, now
president of the Alumni Associa
tion. "I got on a train that slowly
picked up other students as we went
across countiy."
After making his cross-country
trek, Stone set up camp in Madera
House, since renamed Junipero, in
Wilbur Hall.
"Both Wilbur and Stern were all
male freshman (dormitories) back
then," Stone said. "Imagine the
combined force of 720 boys — there
were a lot of damage deposits lost."
Moreover, dating posed a mathe
matical challenge. "It was about 70
percent men to 30 percent women,"
Stone said.
Both sexes met in the required
classes, in a more rigid and strict
system than current standards,
Stone said.
Noting some advantages of the

common core, Stone said, "You took
the same classes as everyone else.
There was a greater sense of class
identity, built through the torture
of college requirements. Of course,
the diversity we have these days is
quite valuable."
Senior year, all roads led back to
the Farm for Stone, when he applied
for and was accepted by the Gradu
ate School of Business in 1967.
"I was mildly influenced by Gen.
Hershey, who ran the draft board,"
Stone laughed. "In 1967, anyone
not registered for grad school by Oc
tober was considered eligible for the
draft.
"So, I just moved across the
street," he said. "The purposeful
business types interfered with our
attempts to extend our senior year.
And we probably interfered with
their learning as well."
After two years of school, Stone
began looking for jobs in the "real
world" in 1969. He ended up as a
business officer for the Office of Stu
dent Affairs.
"I took my lowest offer. It was my
second attempt to delay gradua
tion," Stone said.
However, "Because of the
protests on campus, I was as
signed to riot duty — that is, I
helped keep communication be
tween the administration and the
rest of campus open," Stone said.
"The joke was that I was the assis

tant dean of Cambodia."
In 1971, Stone prolonged his
stay at the University by taking the
position as assistant to former Uni
versity President Richard Lyman
and again in 1977 by becoming the
president of the Alumni Associa
tion.
"It was then I began to realize
that staying on campus was becom
ing a career rather than a postpone
ment," Stone said. "The University
was more complex than a corpora
tion, with a diverse set of characters
all claiming ownership and knowl
edge. I wanted to be a part of that.
"I'm a lifer," Stone said. "I might
be eligible for parole soon."
History Department Chair Nor
man Nairn ark — who earned a
bachelor's and doctorate in history
from Stanford in 1966 and 1972, re
spectively — has plenty of experi
ence navigating the treacherous
bike corridors of Stanford.
"I still often bike from our house
on campus to class," Naimark said.
In 1962, Naimark began honing
his bike riding skills on the way to
class. In his backpack were the
seeds, the books that sprouted his
interest in history.
"I had a wonderful CIV class and
a fantastic instructor, who was re
sponsible in part for my growing in
terest in history," Naimark said.
Outside of the classroom,
Naimark was part of the social re

form movement.
"My student days were heavily
marked by involvement in protests
against the war and student support
of the civil rights movement."
Naimark added, "I wouldn't
make too much of the 'changes' be
tween a politicized student body
then and an apolitical one now.
After all, students now routinely
engage in public service activities
as a way to demonstrate their sense
of political and social commit
ment."
Naimark continued his commit
ment to Stanford by beginning work
on his doctorate. That was when he
began his transition from student to
professor by working as a teaching
assistant.
After completing his doctorate in
1972, Naimark left the fields of the
Farm for the cobblestone streets of
Boston. At various times he worked
at Boston University, the Russian
Research Center and Wellesley Col
lege, Naimark said.
In 1988, the wheels of the bicycle
spun full circle when Naimark re
turned to Stanford.
"Sometimes I think that every
thing is the same and sometimes
that nothing is," Naimark said. "In
very many ways, some I have trou
ble defining, it is the same institu
tion it was in the 19605. And it's not
just the jeans, T-shirts, sandals,
sunshine and hills."

Like the pioneers before him, Bill
Stone — who graduated with a
bachelor's in political science in
1967 and an MBA in 1969 — headed
out across the Continental Divide to
get to Stanford in 1963.
"I had never been across the Mis
sissippi before," said Stone, now
president of the Alumni Associa
tion. "I got on a train that slowly
picked up other students as we went
across countiy."
After making his cross-country
trek, Stone set up camp in Madera
House, since renamed Junipero, in
Wilbur Hall.
"Both Wilbur and Stern were all
male freshman (dormitories) back
then," Stone said. "Imagine the
combined force of 720 boys — there
were a lot of damage deposits lost."
Moreover, dating posed a mathe
matical challenge. "It was about 70
percent men to 30 percent women,"
Stone said.
Both sexes met in the required
classes, in a more rigid and strict
system than current standards,
Stone said.
Noting some advantages of the

common core, Stone said, "You took
the same classes as everyone else.
There was a greater sense of class
identity, built through the torture
of college requirements. Of course,
the diversity we have these days is
quite valuable."
Senior year, all roads led back to
the Farm for Stone, when he applied
for and was accepted by the Gradu
ate School of Business in 1967.
"I was mildly influenced by Gen.
Hershey, who ran the draft board,"
Stone laughed. "In 1967, anyone
not registered for grad school by Oc
tober was considered eligible for the
draft.
"So, I just moved across the
street," he said. "The purposeful
business types interfered with our
attempts to extend our senior year.
And we probably interfered with
their learning as well."
After two years of school, Stone
began looking for jobs in the "real
world" in 1969. He ended up as a
business officer for the Office of Stu
dent Affairs.
"I took my lowest offer. It was my
second attempt to delay gradua
tion," Stone said.
However, "Because of the
protests on campus, I was as
signed to riot duty — that is, I
helped keep communication be
tween the administration and the
rest of campus open," Stone said.
"The joke was that I was the assis

tant dean of Cambodia."
In 1971, Stone prolonged his
stay at the University by taking the
position as assistant to former Uni
versity President Richard Lyman
and again in 1977 by becoming the
president of the Alumni Associa
tion.
"It was then I began to realize
that staying on campus was becom
ing a career rather than a postpone
ment," Stone said. "The University
was more complex than a corpora
tion, with a diverse set of characters
all claiming ownership and knowl
edge. I wanted to be a part of that.
"I'm a lifer," Stone said. "I might
be eligible for parole soon."
History Department Chair Nor
man Nairn ark — who earned a
bachelor's and doctorate in history
from Stanford in 1966 and 1972, re
spectively — has plenty of experi
ence navigating the treacherous
bike corridors of Stanford.
"I still often bike from our house
on campus to class," Naimark said.
In 1962, Naimark began honing
his bike riding skills on the way to
class. In his backpack were the
seeds, the books that sprouted his
interest in history.
"I had a wonderful CIV class and
a fantastic instructor, who was re
sponsible in part for my growing in
terest in history," Naimark said.
Outside of the classroom,
Naimark was part of the social re

form movement.
"My student days were heavily
marked by involvement in protests
against the war and student support
of the civil rights movement."
Naimark added, "I wouldn't
make too much of the 'changes' be
tween a politicized student body
then and an apolitical one now.
After all, students now routinely
engage in public service activities
as a way to demonstrate their sense
of political and social commit
ment."
Naimark continued his commit
ment to Stanford by beginning work
on his doctorate. That was when he
began his transition from student to
professor by working as a teaching
assistant.
After completing his doctorate in
1972, Naimark left the fields of the
Farm for the cobblestone streets of
Boston. At various times he worked
at Boston University, the Russian
Research Center and Wellesley Col
lege, Naimark said.
In 1988, the wheels of the bicycle
spun full circle when Naimark re
turned to Stanford.
"Sometimes I think that every
thing is the same and sometimes
that nothing is," Naimark said. "In
very many ways, some I have trou
ble defining, it is the same institu
tion it was in the 19605. And it's not
just the jeans, T-shirts, sandals,
sunshine and hills."
People scrambling to find jobs
for next year may want to be in on a
secret: There are ways of staying on
the Farm forever.
Senior Damon Silver, a symbolic
systems major, is embarking on his
seventh year as an undergraduate.
Silver hasn't broken from cam
pus for a variety of reasons.
"I took some time off, switched
majors. I wouldn't know what re
union to go to," Silver said. "Al
though I'm graduating this quar
ter, I'll probably still be in the area "
The campus looked very differ
ent when Silver arrived
Silver revealed a not-so-long-lost
campus event concerning Comput
er Science Prof. Stuart Reges.
"He'd write letters to the drug
czar saying, 'I do drugs' and 'I cam
drugs in my backpack,'" Silver said
"The government threatened to cut
off funding so the University looked
for some way to get rid of him.
When Reges took some students
out to dinner and looked the other
way when minors ordered alcohol,
the University fired him "

r unding also played a major role
in the indirect-cost incident, which
still impacts the campus today, Sil
ver said.
"For every dollar that Stanford
spent on research, the government
would pay back 75 percent," Silver
said. "But it's hard to classify 're
search costs' maintaining the fa
cilities and upkeep of the Universi
ty are all part of that. An investiga
tion found that money was being
spent on floral arrangements, a
v lar closet, a yacht. Then '20/20'
the news magazine program)
picked up on it, and then there was
big national scandal."
As a result, government subsi
dies were cut back from 75 percent
to 55 percent. Silver said, which had
an immediate effect on the Univer
sity.
"Tuition costs went up, arts and
humanities suffered, language de
partments were consolidated, de
gree possibilities went away," Sil
ver said. "There were a number of
protests."
With his historical perspective,
Silver offered this advice: "Go out
and meet people. Don't be limited.
Don't be afraid to ask about what's
going on."
