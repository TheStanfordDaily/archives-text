# Asia / Pacific program will start next fall

The Asia / Pacific Scholars Program, which will
bring talented students from Asia to Stanford for
graduate study, will be launched on a limited basis
by next fall.
The program, which is Stanford's answer to Ox
ford's Rhodes Scholarships, was conceived by Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper during a trip to
Asia in 1994.
The program, which hopes to raise a $50 million
endowment, was originally planned to be underway
by this year.
According to Steve Suda, director of Asian opera
tions in the Office of Development, the fund-raising
aspect of the program has been challenging. Only $9
million has been raised for the program to date.
"This is an ambitious program," Suda said.
Development officers had hoped to find a large in
dividual donor; they are now seeking funds from
Asia on a country-by-countiy basis.
According to Suda, Asian countries have ex
pressed enthusiasm for the program but raising
funds has been difficult due to other factors, such as
Japan's current economic difficulties.
Next fall the program will have a limited number
and spectrum of students. According to Michel Ok
sensberg, a senior fellow at the Institute for Inter
national Studies who works with Stanford's
Asia / Pacific Research Center, next year's
Asia / Pacific Scholars Program will only be open to
about five Chinese citizens who have already applied
to Stanford graduate schools this year. Graduate de
partments will forward the names of eligible stu
dents to the selection committee.
Depending on how much funding is raised, the
program hopes to expand to its originally envisioned
size by fall 1998, when it will include 15 to 20 stu
dents from several Asian countries.
The program is designed to prepare the scholars
to be active leaders in their fields in the Asia / Pacif
ic region, according to Oksenberg. Scholars will be
selected from all graduate schools and majors.
"We envision that Asia / Pacif
ic Scholars will have an enriched
experience at Stanford," Oksen
berg said. The Asia / Pacific
Scholars program will include
speakers, seminars and course
work, as well as a possible sum
mer internship and travel oppor
tunities.
"We want [scholars] to have a
good degree of interaction with
others in the program and to ac
quire a sense of being members of
the Asia / Pacific community,"

Oksenberg said.
The program is important due
to the rapid growth in Asia / Pa
cific region. "The vision of the
program is to nurture the sense of
the emerging Asian Pacific com
munity," Oksenberg said.
Oksenberg cited next week's
Asia/Pacific Economic Confer
ence in Manila, Philippines, next
week as evidence of the expansion
and growth in this area. "This
program seeks to prepare people
for that world."
Oksenberg stressed that the
program is still in the planning
stage. The admissions and curric
ular aspects of the program will be
concrete next fall.
