## 0.J., again? Simpson to testify today 
### 
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - He'll deny. He'll
explain. He'll likely forget — a lot.
Sometime-actor O.J. Simpson today will embark on
the performance of his life. The audience will be a j uiy of
his peeis, his critics, the court of pubUc opinion.
Jurors in Simpson's murder trial got only three words
from the celebrity defendant. Jurors in his wrongful
death trial may get three days.
But his witness-stand appearance in the lawsuit that
seeks to separate him from millions of his football and
rental-car dollars is not the first time Simpson has given
his side of the story.
His most revealing comments came in a police inter
view June 13,1994, the day alter Nicole Brown Simpson
and Ronald Goldman were killed and in 11 days of sworn
deposition taken between mid-January and early
September this year. That testimony generated 2,807
pages of transcript and touched on virtually every aspect
of the case.
Simpson's most difficult task may be explaining cuts
on his left hand, wounds the plaintiffs contend he suf
fered when his gloveless hand was raked by the finger
nails of Ms. Simpson or Goldman in their death strug
gles.
He has already given several explanations, saying he
was cut on at least three distinct occasions: before he left
for Chicago, in his Chicago hotel room and after he
returned to Los Angeles.
Simpson also insists he wasn't fleeing from police but
felt, in his quasi-suicidal mood five days alter the killings,
that he had to visit Nicole's grave in Orange County.
"I was feeling a lot of pain and I wanted it to stop," he
testified Jan. 22.
A fake goatee found in the Bronco, he said, was to dis
guise himself on some future trip to Knott's Berry Farm
with his kids — although he acknowledged he had never
worn a fake beard in public before.
His passport and thousands of dollars were in the
Bronco, he said, because he always carries thousands of
dollars and his passport.
Simpson has offered no explanation for any of the
physical evidence, from crime-scene blood drops with his
DNA type to the bloody glove found behind his house. He
has left this to his lawyers, who allege police frame-up
and lab contamination.
His memory most frequently fails when he's ques
tioned about clothing he owned, especially whether he
ever had gloves and socks like those linked to the killer.
But he has said he had never, and would never, wear
the rare Bruno Magli shoe — the Lorenzo model — that
left the bloody tracks near the bodies.
