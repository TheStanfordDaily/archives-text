Explosion kills 20
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The
shops and restaurants were just opening
on crowded Camelia Soto Street when
an explosion blew apart a six-story
building yesterday, turning windows
into flying knives and crushing drivers
in their cars.
At least 20 people were killed, and
more than 80 were hurt. Police expected
to Find at least 10 more bodies in the
mounds of torn steel and concrete that
were offices and apartments.
President Clinton declared Puerto
Rico a disaster area, a move authorizing
federal aid for recovery efforts and fed
eral rescue teams to participate in the
search for more victims.
Officials suspected a leak in a pipe
carrying cooking gas caused the blast
and said the building's owner had
been complaining for weeks of escap
ing gas. The San Juan Gas Co., how
ever, said it couldn't confirm a gas
explosion.

Accused spy indicted
WASHINGTON (AP) - At the time
CIA officer Harold J. Nicholson was
alleged to have started selling secrets to
Russia, he was about to begin making
alimony payments equal to one-quarter
his net monthly income, court and FBI
records show.
The government, which charged
Nicholson with espionage cn Monday,
contends the CIA officer sold out to Rus
sia for $120,000. It has not publicly
asserted any link to his divorce settle
ment or other personal financial mat
ters.
A federal grand jury indicted Nichol
son yesterday on one count of spying.
The next legal step will be an arraign
ment at which Nicholson will enter a
formal plea to the indictment.
"He betrayed his country for
money," U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey
said at the time of Nicholson's arrest.
"He was not motivated by ideology but
by greed."

Worth a million words
NEW YORK (AP) - The $15.6 mil
lion sale of a Willem de Kooning
abstract capped the fall art auctions and
showed that the high prices of the late
1980s are back — with one big differ
ence.
"This market has come out of the
ashes of that crash, and year after year
it slowly consolidated and crept up,"
said Larry Gagosian, a Manhattan
gallery owner. "It is a much more
durable market than what we had in the
late 1980s."
The Impressionist and modern art
market was the first to recover. In 1993,
a Cezanne brought $28.6 million and a
Picasso sold for $20 million — one quar
ter of the $82.5 million that a Vincent
van Gogh masterpiece fetched in 1990
but, still, great prices for great art.
But the market for post-World War II
art lagged far behind, when this week,
with the contemporary sale at
Christie's, all that changed.
