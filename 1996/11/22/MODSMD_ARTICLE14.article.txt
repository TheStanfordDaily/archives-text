GOMA, Zaire (AP) — Zairian
rebels are separating out young
Rwandan Hutu men from crowds
of returning refugees, other
refugees said yeserday as they
arrived in Goma by the busload.
Nothing was known about the
men's fate.
Only women, children and old
people climbed off the rickety
buses and trucks yesterday in
Goma, after a 6-mile ride from the
town of Sake and the sprawling
Mugunga refugee camp.
The rebels, who control a swath
of eastern Zaire, refused to let jour
nalists and aid workers out of
Goma to look into what happened
to the men.
Most of the Rwandan refugees
were frightened and exhausted
after spending more them three
weeks walking through the hilly
forests west of Goma following
Zairian rebel attacks on the U.N.
camps.
Refugees also reported intense
fighting between the Zairian rebels
and the Rwandan Hutu militias,
who were driven out of Mugunga
by the rebels last week. That fight
ing allowed 500,000 Rwandan
Hutus to escape from the control of
the Hutu militias and return
home.
Local residents in Goma report
ed seeing troops from the Tutsi-led
Rwandan Patriotic Army in the
area around Sake — 14 miles from
the border with Rwanda — and
claimed they were leading the bat
tle against the Hutu militias and
Zairian troops.
The rebels' restrictions on jour

nalists also made it impossible to
confirm the accounts of fighting. It
was the first time since the refugee
exodus began last week that for
eign aid workers and journalists
were confined to Goma.
Some refugees said the rebels
were separating out young men
they suspect of being part of the
Rwandan Hutu militias from
groups of several hundred
refugees. U.N. workers, who
declined to be identified, said they
also have received reports that
young men are being detained by
the rebels.
Refugees reported that the
Rwandan Hutu militiamen who
have joined forces with Zairian
government troops are battling
with the rebels south and west of
Goma. That battle zone stretches
from the town of Minova on the
shore of Lake Kivu up to
Matchanga, 15 miles west of
Goma.
Rebel authorities have told the
U.N. officials in Goma to get ready
to accept a large number of
refugees in the next few days, U.N.
spokesman Tom Wilkinson said in
Gisenyi, Rwanda, across the bor
der from Goma.
U.S. satellite photographs indi
cate as many as 100,000 Rwandan
refugees from the Bukavu area
south of Kivu are moving
north along the lake towards Mino
va, U.N. officials said. Local resi
dents said the Hutu militias are
trying to push the refugees, which
number more than 1 million, to the
west, deeper into Zaire and away
from Rwanda.
