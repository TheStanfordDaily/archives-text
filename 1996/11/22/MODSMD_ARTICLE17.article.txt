West campus parking
sacrificed in favor of
salamanders and trees

STANFORD MAGAZINE PUT
it best- "Why on a campus the
size of Texas is it so hard to
park?" That question is especially
pertinent to residents of the west
side of campus. Even though the
west side of campus is much less
densely built up than the east side,
parking spaces are both more diffi
cult to find and considerably nar
rower than on the east side.
The familiar excuse for the park
ing problem is that parking spaces
are both expensive and unsightly.
What's more, the University does
not want to give people an incentive
to drive and thus clog up surround
ing roads and add to environmental
problems. To the extent that pro
grams like the free Marguerite
shuttle service actually coax people
to leave their cars at home and
commute by public transportation,
Transportation Programs has done
a service both to the environment
and to safety.
However, there is one group that
cannot possibly be faulted for
bringing cars on to campus — those
who live here. Student residents
already pay $70 per year for the
privilege of parking on campus.
One would think that — given a
campus of Stanford's size and rela
tive low density — that $70 would
buy students a parking space right
next to their dorms. But, as stu
dents all over campus and particu
larly on the west side know, that is
not the case.
This year, due to ongoing con
struction, parking has been a mess
for those who live in the Suites and
Governor's Corner. The old Gover
nor's Corner lot is the construction
site for new graduate student hous
ing, so a new but much smaller
parking lot was created between
Campus Drive West and the golf
driving range. This led many Gov
ernor's Corner students to park in

the lot between Lagunita and
EAST House, thus filling up that
already busy lot.
The new parking lot near the
golf driving range appeared to have
mitigated parking problems for
Suites residents at the beginning of
the year, but now that a service
road behind the Suites has been
closed off, the new parking lot is
filled to the saturation point as
well. For the first five weeks of the
quarter, the narrow strip of land to
the side of the service road provided
parking for about 35 vehicles.
Then, notices went up that the road
was to be closed off. The reason:
The road is tiger salamander habi
tat, and the "historic" trees could
not survive with cars around them.
This has to be a new low in deny
ing students parking spaces. First
of all, is it really possible that only
the small strip of land to the side of
the service road could be tiger sala
mander habitat? Wasn't the much
larger area — where the new park
ing lot and new graduate housing
construction is — the salamanders'
domain as well? And, if there were
really such good reasons for not
allowing students to park there,
wouldn't those reasons have
applied for the first five weeks of
the quarter as well? As for the "his
toric" trees — surely, the heavy
machinery of the construction
crews will do more damage than
students' cars.
To say that the lane needs to be
kept clear for fire reasons is also
disingenuous. Fire trucks had no
noticeable difficulty navigating the
road behind the Suites during the
first five weeks of the quarter. And
if it is the case that the road needs
to be kept clear for safety reasons,
then students were in grave danger
for the first five weeks of the quar
ter in which ca6e Transportation
Programs is guilty of gross negli
gence.
While some of the west side's
parking woes are understandable,
there is no excuse for exacerbating
them by closing off much needed
parking.
