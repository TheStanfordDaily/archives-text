## Making sense of California 
### 
I PLAN TO flee the University on
Tuesday. You should, too. Thanks
giving is a time to gain weight and
perspective, and both are best achieved
away from here. But do you know
enough about the Golden State to recre
ate successfully? Read my trenchant
and titillating trivial tips for a complete
understanding of the ways of the state.
California's motto is Eureka —
Greek for "Oh, shit!" Archimedes was
said to have uttered this after discover
ing a way to determine the purity of
gold. This spirit of surprise over new
found potential for profit has always
possessed California's occupants from
early Spanish settlers to prospectors to
the producers of "Baywatch." Opti
mistic opportunism and warm weather
go hand in hand here. If you only want
warm weather, try Cuba.
Pete Wilson is California's governor.
Though he seems moderately conserva
tive, his willingness to blame every
thing from economic woes to earth
quakes on illegal immigrants makes
him an extreme xenophobe. Urban
myth has it that "Pedro" enjoys scam
pering into Taco Bell in his free time to
check for green cards.
Oh, and if you plan to commit a
crime in California, don't commit three
crimes. Under California law, you are
almost better off murdering two nuns
than stealing three pizzas, thanks to
our "three strikes" law. Under this rule
of inane applied numerology, small
time pot dealers and pizza thieves have

filled prison cells designed to confine
people who are actually dangerous.
Crazed proponents of the "three
strikes" law, seeking even stiffer penal
ties, are now busy drafting a new
"ground-rule double" law.
California's politics are, like the
state itself, one of a kind. We all mar
veled at the passage of Propositions 209
and 215. What weird demographic
group legalized marijuana and repealed
affirmative action, all on the same day?
Libertarians come to mind, but are
there enough of them? Nazi hippies?
Pot-smoking Klansmen? Come on.
Tired of guessing? Here's the answer —
like Florida, California is home to lots
of oranges, golf courses and . . . senior
citizens.
Think about it — who wants the end
of affirmative action and the availabili
ty of medicinal marijuana? Picture a
white, Orange County octogenarian
pondering her ballot: "Those minorities
have had enough time to get their act
together, but damn it if a little ganja for
my glaucoma wouldn't just tickle me
pink." Take two of these, and call me
when you can, sister. If you foresee a
career in California politics, don't for
get the elderly. They have their own
cranky agenda, their own slick infras
tructure in the AARP, and they vote by
the Lark-load.
No discussion of California is com
plete without explaining the differences
between Northern and Southern Cali
fornia. How to contrast the two: Rustic

and urban? Foggy and sunny? Try good
and evil. Drive over the Tehachapis on
1-5 and tremble at the smog-filled, mod
ern-day Gomorrah that is the Greater
Los Angeles basin. Notice its seething
freeways, which form a series of con
centric rings similar to Dante's Hell.
And like any inferno, Los Angeles is hot
and dry, so a huge aqueduct sucks
water down there from Northern Cali
fornia.
While north / south comparisons are
fruitful in California, so are west / east
analyses. Driving east from Stanford
will put you in the famed San Joaquin
Valley, agricultural provider to the
world. I did not believe the extent to
which the valley feeds the entire planet
until this summer when I was in Crete,
excited to be eating foreign food. A
restaurant owner asked me where I was
from, and I told him I was a Californi
an. He laughed and told me that I was
eating fruit from California. "Long way
to come," he chuckled, "to eat fruit that
comes from your state. You crazy Amer
icans."
"Yeah," I said, thinking up a witty
response. "Your country sucks."

Thanksgiving dinner, he will be a fat,
