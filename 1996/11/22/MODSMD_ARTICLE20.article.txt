Cowell explains its role in health and fitness tour

I WANTED TO let Daily readers
know the Cowell Student Health
Services' stance on the Collegiate
Health and Fitness Tour which has
sparked so much dialogue over the last
week. Briefly, in response to a few of
the items in your editorial:
1. The health and fitness tour is pre
sented at nearly 25 colleges just on the
West Coast, including many state
schools with "ostensibly less affluent"
students. Assuming that all Stanford
students are as affluent as your edito
rial indicated is specious at best. Hav
ing been a student here only two years
ago, my experience has been that a
number of classes and "income levels"
are represented here.
2. The event was investigated by talk
ing to colleagues at other schools in the
area who have hosted the tour and asking
for their input. Additionally, we talked to
many students both at Cowell and
through the Office of Student Activities

about the nature of the event. Student
input was very present and important to
us in our considerations.
3. Cowell was present at the tour
with student representatives from dif
ferent health promotion groups. Howev
er, because of the protest and the can
cellation of the second day of the event,
Cowell's participation was not noticed.
4. I acknowledge that many of the
corporations sponsoring the event are
not related to health and fitness, and
my response to this would be that
many corporations sponsor events to
which they have no affiliation. We
believed in the content of the health
and fitness portion of the tour.
The tour was presented as a fun and
informative way to reach students
about important health matters. It
included asthma "IQ" tests, weight and
heart disease tests, cholesterol infor
mation as well as computerized tests
about coronary risk, exercise, life

expectancy and alcohol risk. Addition
ally, the event was also presented in a
very fun and festive manner with activ
ities like artificial rock climbing and
bungee running.
The day of the event, however,
brought significant revelations â€” the
most notable being that the event had
been eclipsed by the immensity of the
presence of corporate sponsorship,
thereby negating the goal of the health
and fitness portion of the tour. No one
fully understood the grandeur with
which the corporate sponsors would
occupy White Plaza until that day.
White Plaza has traditionally been a
place of free speech and student activi
ty. Appropriate to this, some students
protested the significant presence of
corporate sponsors on their University
while others enjoyed the activities and
information. Both are reasonable and
understandable positions.
The intentions for sponsoring the

event on the Stanford campus were
good. However, these intentions were
lost among the corporate advertising.
As a result, the second day of the event
was canceled.
After a discussion between the
Office of Student Activities, Cowell
Health Promotion Services staff and
student protesters, an important and
meaningful dialogue was initiated
which we hope to continue and open up
to other students, campus groups,
organizations and the administration.
Finally, I personally must say that I
did not suffer any embarrassment as a
campus administrator (and former stu
dent). I stand behind our intentions of
promoting health and wellness and see
the protest as a very important gesture
in student-administration relations.
