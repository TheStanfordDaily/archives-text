# Bramzon's charges against Bookstore outdated and wrong
## 
### 
Danny Bramzon's letter about
monopolies on campus is so virulent
that one would think he was talking
about robber barons of the 19th centu
ry. But I do want to clear up a couple of
things.
First, he says I was once "secretary
treasurer." I never was any sort of trea
surer.
I did for a while speak for the board,

and I doubtless told the Faculty Senate
that the Bookstore's "gross income"
was well into the millions and that in
some years that income exceeded
expenses by more than a million. But
virtually all that "profit" (sic) went into
rebates or physical improvements in the
store or enhancements of book collec
tions.
It's very old history that there were
some questionable diversions of money
into the perks he describes. That mat
ter was settled long ago, and the finan
cial diversions duly corrected, to the
satisfaction of the state attorney gener
al, and the individuals charged with
those diversions were removed from the

Bookstore several years ago.
No one at the Bookstore gets any
odd perks now. People get salaries they
earn, measured by objective professional
and industry norms. There are no cars
or houses.
Period.
