# In defense of minority students on the Farm
## 
### 
Recently I was listening to a radio
talk show about the highly publicized
Proposition 209. A Stanford alumna

called in and remarked that the stu
dents of color at Stanford were not as
academically astute as the other stu
dents on campus. She implied that
Stanford lowers its admissions stan
dards in order to accept students from
diverse cultures. I disagree!
I was 17 years old in my freshman
year. Although I had impressive schol
arly achievements, I felt very inept in
comparison to other Stanford students
students of color or otherwise.
Wow, ignorance in the hands of the
"educated" is a tragic and detrimental
power!
