# A
						concise guide to pickup lines
## 
### 
Most Stanford students don't
know any good ones; the heyday
of the pickup line is yet to come.
But smoke-filled frat parties
aren't so different from smoke
tilled bars, and college doesn't
last forever. So, in preparation
for the future — or for use right
here, right now — The Daily has
compiled a selected collection of
pickup lines: the best of the good,
the bad and the very, very ugly.
Lines everyone's heard but
no one uses
• "What's your sign?"
• "You must be tired — you've
been running through my
dreams all night."
• "Are your pants made of
mirrors / window panes / plate
glass? Because I can see myself
in them."
Specifically Stanford lines
• At the Powwow: "What's
your tribe?"
• In CS 106 A: "Just because
our computers are incompatible
doesn't mean we are."
• At Full Moon on the Quad:
"Are you a freshman? Will you
be one for me?"
• Anywhere: "Are you pre
med, too?"
Heavenly lines
• "You're the brightest star
here."
• "You're the center of my

universe.
• "What's your name, angel?"
• "Did you hurt yourself when
you fell from heaven?"
• "Have I died and gone to
heaven?"
• Turning over tag in shirt: "I
was just checking to see if it said,
'Made in heaven.' " (To which an
attractive Asian woman replied,
"No, it says, 'Made in Taiwan.' ")
Cheesy and cute
• "I wish I could rearrange the
alphabet so U and I could be to
gether."
• "You must be a broom be
cause you just swept me off my
feet."
Drinking lines
• "I'm not drunk — I'm just
intoxicated by you."
• "The more I drink, the pret
tier you get."
Huhhh? lines
• "My lenses turn dark in the
sunshine of your love."
• "Your eyes are as blue as
window cleaner."
Lines that start off funny
• "Nice outfit. Can I talk you
out of it?"
• "Let's have breakfast to
gether. Should I call you or
nudge you?"
• "Is it hot in here or is it just
you?"

Clever lines
• "Be unique. Say yes."
• "Sex is a killer. Want to die
happy?"
• "Do you believe in love at
first sight or should I walk by
again?"
Lines that might get you
somewhere
• "If I told you I liked your
body, would you hold it against
me?"
• "Hi. I'm Big Brother. I've
been watching you."
• "Were you always this cute
or did you have to work at it?"
• "Are you here alone or do I
have to kill someone to win your
affection?"
• "Shall we actually talk or
just continue to flirt from a dis
tance?"
Lines for the arrogant
• "Hi. You'll do."
• "It's always good for you to
see me again."
• "Here's your chance to get
to know me."
• "Wow! Are you really as
beautiful as you seem or do you
just remind me of myself?"
The last word
When all is said and done, the
one pickup line that consistently
has the highest success rate for
both sexes: "Hi."
