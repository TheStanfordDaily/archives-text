# Freedman urges taking time off

### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Feminist Studies Program Chair
Estelle Freedman, speaking at the
Women's Center yesterday, said she
wanted to give the discussion of her
life the subtitle, "Indirect Paths and
Unintended Outcomes."
Her life has twisted in ways she
never expected, she told a noontime
crowd of more than 30. She spoke as
part of the center's Brown Hag
Lunch Series.
After going through stages of
wanting to be an astronomer and a
journalist, the last thing she over ex
pected to do was teach.
"Everybody knows if you're a girl
and you go to college, you go into
teaching," the history professor
said. "I vowed in high school I would
never be a teacher because it wast he
only thing you were allowed to do
and it was devalued."
After graduating in 1969 with a
bachelor's in history from Barnard
College, Freedman took one year oft'
before heading to Columbia Univer
sity to pursue her master's in history.
She said the primary reason she
wanted to return to school was to
"go back to the library."
"I had no idea what it meant to be
an academic," she said. "I knew
going to graduate school was like
writing your senior honors thesis a
lot."
Freedman had three major inter

ests during her college years which
later led her to a career in higher ed
ucation.
Not only did she love the re
searching aspect but she also want
ed to work for social change. She
said teaching enabled her to do both.
"Someone once said, 'Feminist
studies is the educational branch of
the feminist movement,' " Freed
man said.
She said she also wanted the op
portunity to be in a position to "see
things get done, even if I have to do
them myself." Her position in high
er education gives her the opportu
nity to make the changes she wants,
rather than to just "talk about
change," she said.
" I actually get to do things I care
about and things get done," she said.
She encouraged members of the
group to go into the world outside
the University before heading di
rectly to graduate school.
She also encouraged the group to
"have a system of meaning outside
the workplace that's rewarding."
She used examples of family, athlet
ics, religion, spirituality and, her
personal favorite, music. Since com
ing to Stanford in 1989, Freedman
has returned to taking piano and
guitar lessons.
She said having such a release is
crucial to maintaining a balanced
life, admitting that being a professor
at a major university can be "very
frustrating."
