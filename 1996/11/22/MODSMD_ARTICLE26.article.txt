## Big Splash Cardinal needs victory over Cal 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
Big Game weekend is nearly
upon us, and undoubtedly many
Stanford students plan to make
the trek to Cal so as not to miss
out on the excitement. Well, set
the alarms early, because you're
going to have to make it to
Berkeley by 10 a.m. to catch Big
Splash, the annual water polo
showdown in the pool.
As the top two water polo
programs in the country, Stan
ford and Cal have won 19 NCAA
titles between them in the 27
years since the tournament's
inception. This year the domi
nance continues, as the Cardi

nal and the Golden Bears are
currently the No. 2 and No. 4
teams in the nation, respective
ly-
Stanford (16-5, 7-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation)
defeated Cal (12-6, 4-4) in the
two teams' last meeting by the
slim margin of 10-9 and hopes to
end the season with a flourish.
Big Splash is especially impor
tant since only two teams from
the conference will travel to San
Diego for the NCAA tourna
ment.
"Every game seems to be a
must-win game, and this is
another one," said head coach


Ed Barker â€” Daily file
Junior Nathan Osborn controls the ball in a game against Long
Beach State earlier this season. Cardinal water polo takes on
Cal at Big Splash tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Dante Dettamanti. "To go to
NCAAs we've got to win the con
ference tournament or have the
best overall record. We have to put
ourselves in the position that we
can go either way."
It won't be easy. If the commit
tee were to select teams today, No.
1 USC and No. 3 UCLA would go
to NCAAs, although Stanford has
beaten both teams in conference
play.
Of course, the game has other
ramifications, as the winner will
own bragging rights for the next
12 months.
"It doesn't matter that we beat
Cal here a month ago," Dettaman
ti said. "This is Big Splash."
To pull out the win, Stanford
will need all the fan support it can
get as the Cardinal travels to the
unfriendly Cal campus for this
year's battle.
"It's a very hostile environ
ment," Dettamanti said. "It will be
a huge crowd, standing room only
and at least 90 percent Cal fans."
Without the crowd on its side
for adrenaline, the squad looks to
recreate the phenomenal away
game performance that led it to a
victory over UCLA just a few
weeks ago. The key to the win
proved to be an outstanding defen
sive effort which held the potent
UCLA offense to just six goals. To
that end, the Stanford squad has

focused on defending a Cal team
that features no fewer than six
left-handers and U.S. National
Team member Brent Albright, the
Bears' star 2-meter man.
"We're looking to come out
strong and to keep their scoring
down," said Stanford senior goalie
Buzzy Spain.
"We're working on stopping
their 2-meter men and overcoming
their defense, which plays a really
tight press," said sophomore for
ward David Hay.
Crucial to the Card's success
will be its execution in the offen
sive end, which proved excellent in
the last meeting with Cal. In that
game, senior Daniel Lehoczky
scored a career-high four goals,
complemented by key strikes from
sophomore Crosby Grant, fresh
man Brian Heifferon and senior
captain Brian Wallin.
"We need balanced scoring,"
Dettamanti said. "We need every
one to score for us to have a chance
to beat them."
Indeed, that kind of contribu
tion from the team's top four scor
ers will make or break the Card's
chances of winning tomorrow's
contest.
The final piece to the puzzle
that the Card must fit into place
to secure a win is a solid perfor
mance from sophomore goalie
Chris Aguilera. He has consis
tently stopped key shots from the
top competition and recently
earned MPSF Player of the Week
honors for his play against USC
and UCLA.
