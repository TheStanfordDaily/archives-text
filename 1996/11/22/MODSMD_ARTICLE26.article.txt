## Big Splash Cardinal needs victory over Cal 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
Big Game weekend is nearly
upon us, and undoubtedly many
Stanford students plan to make
the trek to Cal so as not to miss
out on the excitement. Well, set
the alarms early, because you're
going to have to make it to
Berkeley by 10 a.m. to catch Big
Splash, the annual water polo
showdown in the pool.
As the top two water polo
programs in the country, Stan
ford and Cal have won 19 NCAA
titles between them in the 27
years since the tournament's
inception. This year the domi
nance continues, as the Cardi

nal and the Golden Bears are
currently the No. 2 and No. 4
teams in the nation, respective
ly-
Stanford (16-5, 7-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation)
defeated Cal (12-6, 4-4) in the
two teams' last meeting by the
slim margin of 10-9 and hopes to
end the season with a flourish.
Big Splash is especially impor
tant since only two teams from
the conference will travel to San
Diego for the NCAA tourna
ment.
"Every game seems to be a
must-win game, and this is
another one," said head coach

Cal at Big Splash tomorrow at 10 a.m.
