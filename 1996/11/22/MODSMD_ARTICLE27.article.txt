# Football readies for 99th Big Game
## Stanford harbors high hopes to beat Cal on Berkeley turf 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
It doesn't get much bigger
than this.
Tomorrow afternoon in
Berkeley's Memorial Stadium,
the oldest Division I-A rivals in
the West — Stanford and Cali
fornia — clash in the 99th Big
Game beginning at 12:30 p.m. A
less-than-capacity crowd of
about 65,000 fans is expected for
this pivotal clash for the Axe
with postseason implications.
"It's a big game for us and it's
a big game for them," senior
running back Mike Mitchell said.
"Our fans are going to be out
there; their fans are going to be
out there. It's so much fun when
you can hear the excitement
right there on top of you."
For the Cardinal (5-5 overall,
4-3 Pacific 10 Conference), the
scenario is simple. Beat Cal and
Stanford earns a berth to the
Sun Bowl in El Paso. A loss,
however, gives the Cardinal a
losing mark for the year.
But Cal (6-4, 3-4) has the lux
ury of a better overall record.
Even with a loss, the Bears
remain eligible for an Aloha
Bowl bid.
The battle for the Axe fea
tures two teams seemingly head
ed in opposite directions to close
the season. After a dreadful 2-5
start, the Cardinal has won
three straight games for the first
time since 1992. On the other
hand, the Bears have lost four of
five after opening the year 5-0.
Stanford coach Tyrone Will
ingham, who is attempting to
guide the Cardinal to back-to
back bowl berths, feels the
turnaround is a testament to
Stanford's "never say die" atti
tude that has led the Cardinal to
comebacks from deficits of six,
13 and 14 points in its last three
games.
"Most importantly, what I am
pleased with is the character and
the quality of the young men we

work with," Willingham said.
"There are ups and downs in
every team's season. You just
have to be prepared to weather
the storm."
For the Golden Bears, the rea
son behind the slip from the top
of the Pac-10 standings to a five
way tie for fourth place is even
more obvious. The Cal defense
has been unable to keep oppo
nents from scoring, surrender
ing 168 points in its last four
games (by contrast, Stanford has
scored 167 all season).

But scoring has seldom been a
problem for the Bears, who have
scored 21 points or less just once
this year (in a 35-7 loss at No. 4
Arizona State two weeks ago).
An injury-riddled offensive line
has not impeded the productivity
of Cal's senior quarterback Pat
Barnes. Likely a high NF L draft
pick, Barnes currently leads the
conference and is third national
ly in total offense.
"We'd like to think we have a
very productive offense," said
first-year Cal head coach Steve

Mariucci said. "But they have a
very good defense too. They mix
their defenses up, give you a
variety of coverages, and they
are getting better as the year
progresses."
Both schools are encouraging
fans to use public transporta
tion, arrive considerably early
and expect to be searched at the
gates.
