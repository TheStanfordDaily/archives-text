# Pac-10 bowl picks rest on final week
## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Seldom has the Pacific 10 Conference bowl
scenario been this muddled at the last week of
the regular season. The conference could have
anywhere from three to eight winning teams,
as one team in each of the rivalry games sports
a 5-5 record.
The worst-case scenario for the Pac-10 has
Arizona State, California, Oregon State,
UCLA and Washington emerging as winners
in tomorrow's contests. This would mean the
Aloha Bowl would pick any available team
because a fourth team would not have the pre
requisite six wins (or, in USC's case, u winning
record because the Trojans could end up 6-6
with a victory over Notre Dame next week),

and Cal would earn the Sun Bowl bid.
The situation at the top is fairly clear. Ari
zona State has clinched the Rose Bowl berth
by winning the Pac-10 title, and Washington
has theoretically locked up the No. 2 spot. Nei
ther the Cotton nor Holiday Bowl is required
to select Washington, but given the Huskies'
record (8-2) and lofty ranking, no other team
makes sense.
The Cotton would then select either the
Western Athletic Conference champion or
Washington. Should Brigham Young win at
Utah tomorrow and then defeat most likely
Wyoming in the WAC Championship, the Cot
ton Bowl would probably select the Cougars
(who would have 13 wins), sending Washing
ton to San Diego. But if BYU falters, Washing
ton will probably go to Dallas

BYU could also earn one of two at-large
berths in the alliance, sending them to either
the Fiesta or Orange Bowls. In that event,
Washington should go to the Cotton.
If Stanford wins, it goes to the Sun Bowl,
because the bowl committee is obligated to
take the highest-remaining team in the Pac-10
standings after the Rose and Cotton / Holiday
berths are filled, and Stanford would be all
alone in the Pac-10 with a 5-3 league mark and
the prerequisite six wins (thank goodness for
the win over San Jose State).
But if Stanford loses, four other squads
could finish 4-4 and fight for the Sun Bowl
nod. The El Paso-based bowl could take any of
them, but because California would have
seven wins, it would likely get the
nod over Washington State (which
would have to defeat Washington
tomorrow) or Oregon (which
would have to defeat Oregon State
tomorrow), even though both

However,"if USC defeats UCLA
tomorrow for the first time since
1990 and then knocks off Notre
Dame for the first time since John
Robinson's first tenure as head
coach, the Trojans would stand 7-5
overall and could possibly earn the
nod over Cal. Although the Bears
topped USC in Los Angeles earlier
this year, the Trojans boast a
stronger national fan base and are
in a larger TV market. The team
passed over for the Sun Bowl in
this situation would likely be the
Aloha Bowl's representative.
The Aloha Bowl does not need
to select the fourth-place team; it
can pick any team in the Pac-10
that is bowl-eligible (has at least six
wins against Division I-A teams
and a winning record). If Stanford
is the Sun Bowl representative, Cal
goes to the Aloha Bowl by default if
Washington State loses to Wash
ington, Oregon loses to Oregon
State, Arizona loses to Arizona
State, and USC loses to either
UCLA or Notre Dame.

Arizona would have a shot at a
bid with a stunning win over the
No. 4 Sun Devils, but Washington
State's chances appear slim (a
three-game November losing
streak and dismally small market
doom the Cougars).
The Ducks are a more curious
case. Starting out with three non
conference wins, Oregon proceeded
to lose its first five Pac-10 games.
But the Ducks would have won
their last three contests and have
been in major bowls the hist two
years.
This could leave the Aloha Bowl
with a choice between two 6-5
squads with losing conference
records. One (Oregon) had a five
game losing streak in the middle of
the year, and the other (Cal) lost
five of its last six games. But since
Oregon was out of bowl person
nel's minds by mid-October and
Cal was at one time poised for a
major bowl bid — and has a better
TV market and a young, highly
regarded coach — look for the
bowls to disregard Cal's 40-23 loss
to the Ducks last week and select
the Bears.
And to think, before the Haka
Bowl was canceled, five Pac-10
teams had automatic bowl bids,
and Stanford would have been
headed to New Zealand with a win
today. A team that had two wins
prior to November now stands to
be the reluctant choice of the third
oldest bowl of the bunch.
