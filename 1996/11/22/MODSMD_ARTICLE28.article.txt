# Pac-10 bowl picks rest on final week
## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
Seldom has the Pacific 10 Conference bowl
scenario been this muddled at the last week of
the regular season. The conference could have
anywhere from three to eight winning teams,
as one team in each of the rivalry games sports
a 5-5 record.
The worst-case scenario for the Pac-10 has
Arizona State, California, Oregon State,
UCLA and Washington emerging as winners
in tomorrow's contests. This would mean the
Aloha Bowl would pick any available team
because a fourth team would not have the pre
requisite six wins (or, in USC's case, u winning
record because the Trojans could end up 6-6
with a victory over Notre Dame next week),

and Cal would earn the Sun Bowl bid.
The situation at the top is fairly clear. Ari
zona State has clinched the Rose Bowl berth
by winning the Pac-10 title, and Washington
has theoretically locked up the No. 2 spot. Nei
ther the Cotton nor Holiday Bowl is required
to select Washington, but given the Huskies'
record (8-2) and lofty ranking, no other team
makes sense.
The Cotton would then select either the
Western Athletic Conference champion or
Washington. Should Brigham Young win at
Utah tomorrow and then defeat most likely
Wyoming in the WAC Championship, the Cot
ton Bowl would probably select the Cougars
(who would have 13 wins), sending Washing
ton to San Diego. But if BYU falters, Washing
ton will probably go to Dallas

BYU could also earn one of two at-large
berths in the alliance, sending them to either
the Fiesta or Orange Bowls. In that event,
Washington should go to the Cotton.
If Stanford wins, it goes to the Sun Bowl,
because the bowl committee is obligated to
take the highest-remaining team in the Pac-10
standings after the Rose and Cotton / Holiday
berths are filled, and Stanford would be all
alone in the Pac-10 with a 5-3 league mark and
the prerequisite six wins (thank goodness for
the win over San Jose State).
But if Stanford loses, four other squads
could finish 4-4 and fight for the Sun Bowl
nod. The El Paso-based bowl could take any of
them, but because California would have
