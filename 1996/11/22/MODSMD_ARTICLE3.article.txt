# Panel discusses Rwandan intervention
## The 						'astonishing scale and the speed of events' compounds the effect of exodus 
### Jennifer Gera 
Following through on a proposal for West
ern intervention to separate Hutu militia from
Hutu refugees in Zaire and Rwanda "would
have been a disaster," a visiting fellow said at a
discussion of the current African situation yes
terday.
Visiting fellow and John Hopkins Universi
ty Assoc. African Studies Prof. Steven Sted

man said the effort would only postpone immi
nent conflict by allowing the Hutu regime time
to rearm. He was speaking as part of a panel
discussing international intervention to solve
the refugee crisis.
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy
began the discussion with an overview of the
combination of bipolarized politics, occupation
of the same lands and high population density
that he said contributes to the "recurring and

massive violence" between the Tutsi and Hutu
tribes. The tribes have been in conflict since
the arrival and domination of the Tutsis cen
turies ago.
U.S., Canadian and other international fac
tions became involved to ensure the safe re
turn of Hutu refugees from Zaire to Rwanda
following the genocidal massacre of 10 percent
of Rwanda's Tutsi population by
a government-supported Hutu
regime in 1994.
Several countries have ex
pressed doubt as to whether or
not they should help to return the
Hutu population to Rwanda.
They felt that in helping Hutu
refugees return to the country,
they would also be supporting the
members of the Hutu tribe that
committed genocide — essential
ly, there was no way to discrimi
nate among the refugees who
were guilty and those who were
not.
Removal of Hutu militias from
the refugee camps by Zairian Tut
sis has made it possible for Hutu
refugees to return to Rwanda,
casting doubt on the need for in
ternational intervention.
Currently, U.S. intervention
includes $140 million in develop
ment assistance funds to Rwan
da, said Abernethy.
According to Thandika MKan
dawire, former executive director
of the Council for the Develop
ment of Social Science Research

in Africa, the European method
of handling refugees, which in
cludes a systematic documenta
tion and repatriation of all
refugees, is opposed to the
African method of dispersion.
The refugees are returning
after two years to discover that
their homes have been occupied,
MKandawire said.
All three speakers stressed the
complexity of the internal strug
gles in Rwanda as a critical factor
in foreign involvement.
Abernethy said the refugee
phenomenon has "tended toward
a centripetal civil war" following
the return of the refugees.
The effect of this mass exodus
from Zaire to Rwanda is com
pounded by the "simply astonish
ing scale and speed of events,"
said Abernethy. Currently, a line
of refugees 28 miles long is pro
ceeding to Rwanda.
"The key to resolving this con
flict is the discussion of the princi
ples of security and rights of all
citizens and the respect of majori
ty rule," MKandawire said.
Stedman added that current
attempts to resolve the crisis in
Rwanda are "one step out of 100,"
which must eventually end in
constitutional reform.
