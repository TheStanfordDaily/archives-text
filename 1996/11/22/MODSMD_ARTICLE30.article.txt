# Basketball faces N. Arizona, Purdue
## 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
Most teams would be pretty content
with a regular-season win over the No.
2 squad in the nation and two over
whelming victories over international
teams in exhibition competition, but
the Stanford women's basketball team
is not like most teams.
The 1-0 Cardinal received all 42 first
place votes in this week's AP poll after a
74-65 win over second-ranked Alabama
last week to unanimously become the
No. 1 team in women's college basket
ball, but the squad hasn't stopped to
celebrate its early success. Instead, the
team has been working hard to improve
upon the weaknesses it discovered in its
game against the Crimson 1 ide.

"I think the team's attitude is excel
lent," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "They are a very motivated
team; they want to improve. They know
it was the first game."
The Card will get its chance to
demonstrate some of those improve
ments in this weekend's competition
against Northern Arizona and Purdue.
After the Purdue game, the Stanford
team will have played three games in
five days, as Stanford faced the Chinese
National Team just two days ago.
In that game, the Card punished the
Chinese National Team in a 103-87 win.
Rebounding, which was a nemesis for
Stanford against Alabama, was marked
ly better as the team outrebounded
China 42-19 and only allowed three
offensive boards for the Chinese.

"A sign of a good team is one that can
win when things aren't perfect, said
senior point guard Jamila NVideman,
noting that the Alabama game was far
from perfect for the Card "It bodes well
for our future. (But at the same time)
no one's going to be afraid to play us.
We never closed the game out We were
up by 10 and let them back into the
game. It doesn't send an intimidating
message."
If any team does have reason to be
intimidated it is the Northern Arizona
Lumberjacks, who take on Stanford for
the first time in the school's history
tonight at 5:45 p.m. The game is the
first of a doubleheader with the No. 2
Stanford women's volleyball team,
