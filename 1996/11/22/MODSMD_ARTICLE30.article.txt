# Basketball faces N. Arizona, Purdue
## 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
Most teams would be pretty content
with a regular-season win over the No.
2 squad in the nation and two over
whelming victories over international
teams in exhibition competition, but
the Stanford women's basketball team
is not like most teams.
The 1-0 Cardinal received all 42 first
place votes in this week's AP poll after a
74-65 win over second-ranked Alabama
last week to unanimously become the
No. 1 team in women's college basket
ball, but the squad hasn't stopped to
celebrate its early success. Instead, the
team has been working hard to improve
upon the weaknesses it discovered in its
game against the Crimson 1 ide.

"I think the team's attitude is excel
lent," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "They are a very motivated
team; they want to improve. They know
it was the first game."
The Card will get its chance to
demonstrate some of those improve
ments in this weekend's competition
against Northern Arizona and Purdue.
After the Purdue game, the Stanford
team will have played three games in
five days, as Stanford faced the Chinese
National Team just two days ago.
In that game, the Card punished the
Chinese National Team in a 103-87 win.
Rebounding, which was a nemesis for
Stanford against Alabama, was marked
ly better as the team outrebounded
China 42-19 and only allowed three
offensive boards for the Chinese.

"A sign of a good team is one that can
win when things aren't perfect, said
senior point guard Jamila NVideman,
noting that the Alabama game was far
from perfect for the Card "It bodes well
for our future. (But at the same time)
no one's going to be afraid to play us.
We never closed the game out We were
up by 10 and let them back into the
game. It doesn't send an intimidating
message."
If any team does have reason to be
intimidated it is the Northern Arizona
Lumberjacks, who take on Stanford for
the first time in the school's history
tonight at 5:45 p.m. The game is the
first of a doubleheader with the No. 2
Stanford women's volleyball team,
which faces Arizona State imme
diately after the basketball con
test at Maples Pavilion.
"These are important games
for our season," said junior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard. "We
want to make sure we get things
clicking, get more of a rhythm
las a team]. I was really happy
with our post play [against
Alabama). It's really going to be
a big factor this season."
The Lumberjacks (14-13 in
1995-96), coached by Meg
Sanders in her first year at the
helm, have improved steadily
over the past few years but are
still big underdogs to the Card.
Sanders takes over the position
that was vacated by former Stan
ford player Charli Turner-
Thorne (Class of '88) when she
was hired by Arizona State after
last season.
Sanders will have three
returning starters and three new
freshmen with which to build the
program. The returners —
senior Michelle Matchinski,
junior Jenny Shayani and sopho
more Jessica Leßlanc — com
bined for 25.4 points and 10.2
rebounds per game last season.
But the team's big gun, center
Karli Rikli (10.6 points, 7.1
rebounds), was lost to gradua
tion.
VanDerveer realizes that her
team is the heavy favorite but
adds that the Lumberjack pro
gram is improving. She hopes to
use the weekend's games to dig

deeper into the squad's lineup.
"I hope it will give us a chance
to play a lot of people," Van-
Derveer said. "I don't want
Jamila to play 36 minutes. We
want to move into a deeper rota
tion."
As for the matchup against
the Purdue Boilermakers Sun
day at 2 p.m., the Cardinal is
slightly more familiar with the
team. Purdue (20-11 last season)
was the last squad to beat Stan
ford on its home court with a 82-
65 win over the Card in the 1994
NCAA West Regional Final.
Stanford does have the edge over
the Boilermakers overall with a
3-1 record.
And Purdue is not the same
team that pulled out a 17-point
win over Stanford, or even the
same squad that lost to Stanford
in the NCAA West Regional
Final in 1995. Nell Fortner, an
assistant for VanDerveer on last
year's national team, takes over
as head coach after Lin Dunn
was fired from the position last
year. But Fortner doesn't step
into a friendly situation.
The Boilermakers only return
three letterwinners from previ
ous seasons because many play
ers, unhappy with the coaching
decision, either transferred (both
before and after Dunn's depar
ture) or quit. But Purdue does
return two of its top performers
in senior forward Jannon Roland
and sophomore guard Stephanie
White.
"Purdue is the last team to
beat us on our home court," Van-
Derveer said. "They have two of
the best players in women's bas
ketball. We want it to be a battle.
