# Nostra Demas
## 
### 
Cut and save this, my friends. This
could possibly be the final episode
of NostraDemas. Keep it in your
scrapbook. right next to that baby picture
of you drooling the river Danube and that
pressed flower from your grandmother's
funeral. Keep it for all time, or until a
Pacific 10 Conference team wins the
national championship.
For this. Big Game weekend, I've
solicited the prognosticating talents of
our fearless leader, Stanford President
Gerhard Casper. Unfortunately, due to a
busy quarter maintaining the stability of
this insane asylum, Casper has had to
"forgo [hisl intense review of Pac-10 foot
ball." Thus, he is qualified only to make a
prediction on Big Game. My qualifica
tions to predict any of these games, on the
other hand, are indisputably insufficient,
but I'll give it a try anyway.
Stanford at Cal
The name is no longer a misnomer. It
is actually a Big Game for the first time in
years. A Cardinal win means Sun Bowl. A
loss means Sans Bowl.
Casper is excited to make a prediction
about this game, even though he has been
busy all quarter with the merger of Stan
ford Hospital and clinics with UC-San
Francisco Medical Center. Oh, and what

of that supposed merging of Stanford and
Cal into a single monstrosity?
"I should like to address a nasty
rumor," Casper says."It is not true that
Stanford is discussing a merger with UC-
Berkeley. While there are many reasons
why we would not want to do that, the
dispositive one is Big Game. If we merged,
the 100 th Rig Game (next year at Stan-
would be an intramural event. That
would be an outcome no president of
Stanford should ever accept."
Intramural or not, I can think of one
outcome no president of Stanford should
accept. A loss to Cal this year. The Golden
Bears are really bad. folks. If it weren't
for Pat Barnes, they would be downright
hideous. Unfortunately, Barnes can't do
anything for the defense. Thus, their sec
ondary reeks worse than the month-old
milk still sitting in Xanadus refrigerator,
and their linebackers rot like the slab of
beef on the shelf above the milk.
Stanford undoubtedly has the advan
tage on defense. Offensively, the Cardinal
slips into lobotomized states of stagnation
at times. Fortunately, the squad won't
need to do much to score on Cal.
Casper's prediction is ... well ... pre
dictable. "Stanford 24. Cal much lower


Reagan
Demas


Gerhard
Casper
How much lower depends on how
many Stanford fans attend Big
Game and the Gaieties."
Gerhard: Stanford by at least 7
Me: Stanford by 4
Oregon at Oregon State
If raindrops were losses, it
would have to be considered anoth
er wet fall in Oregon this year.
Combined, these two teams have
produced the wins of one mediocre
squad. This year might be the best
chance Oregon State has had at
beating the Ducks in a long time.
But the 1996 Civil War (as the
annual matchup is so sensationally
named) will be won by our feath
ered friends from Eugene.

I see three options for the
Beavers and their antiquated
option offense. The first is to flock
to Vegas before tomorrow, bet the
farm on Oregon and then throw
the game. The second is to enter
the stadium waving a white flag
and hope the Ducks accept the
groveling pleas for mercy. The final
option is to set the stadium ablaze
tonight, turn themselves in tomor
row and consider the 20-year
prison sentence a fair tradeoff for
avoiding the embarrassment on
the field.

Arizona State at Arizona
A Pac-10 national champion?
Naw. Still, this desert rivalry is a
heated one. It could well be the
toughest game the Sun Devils have
played to date. Arizona always
gears up for its state rival, and the

UCLA victory last week can only
bolster the Wildcats' confidence.
Nevertheless, I think the Wild
cats have an ice cube's chance in
the Mojave of pulling off the upset.

USC at UCLA
USC is the Mike Tyson of col
lege football. The preseason Pac-10
favorites strutted into the season
with confidence galore and are exit
ing the arena with their tails hang
ing between their legs.
Quarterback is definitely one of
the Trojans' numerous Achilles
heels. But if UCLA trips up, the
Trojans shouldn't look a gift horse
in the mouth. (Any other mytho
logical cliches I could pack into
those two sentences?)
UCLA hasn't exactly risen to
the occasion either. The Bruins
had to win last week against Ari

zona to be eligible for a bowl. They
responded like yeastless dough
when faced with the heat.
The sad story here is USC. It
has taken a bigger fall from grace
than Newt Gingrich and Milli
Vanilli combined and would proba
bly have better odds against the
Bruins with Gingrich taking snaps.

heels. But if UCLA trips up, the
Trojans shouldn't look a gift horse
in the mouth. (Any other mytho
logical cliches I could pack into
those two sentences?)
UCLA hasn't exactly risen to
the occasion either. The Bruins
had to win last week against Ari

zona to be eligible for a bowl. They
responded like yeastless dough
when faced with the heat.
The sad story here is USC. It
has taken a bigger fall from grace
than Newt Gingrich and Milli
Vanilli combined and would proba
bly have better odds against the
Bruins with Gingrich taking snaps.
Me: UCLA by 3
Washington at Washington

This one will hurt. The Huskies
should devour the Cougars in a
typical Darwinian fashion.
