# Nostra Demas

### 
Cut and save this, my friends. This
could possibly be the final episode
of NostraDemas. Keep it in your
scrapbook. right next to that baby picture
of you drooling the river Danube and that
pressed flower from your grandmother's
funeral. Keep it for all time, or until a
Pacific 10 Conference team wins the
national championship.
For this. Big Game weekend, I've
solicited the prognosticating talents of
our fearless leader, Stanford President
Gerhard Casper. Unfortunately, due to a
busy quarter maintaining the stability of
this insane asylum, Casper has had to
"forgo [hisl intense review of Pac-10 foot
ball." Thus, he is qualified only to make a
prediction on Big Game. My qualifica
tions to predict any of these games, on the
other hand, are indisputably insufficient,
but I'll give it a try anyway.
Stanford at Cal
The name is no longer a misnomer. It
is actually a Big Game for the first time in
years. A Cardinal win means Sun Bowl. A
loss means Sans Bowl.
Casper is excited to make a prediction
about this game, even though he has been
busy all quarter with the merger of Stan
ford Hospital and clinics with UC-San
Francisco Medical Center. Oh, and what

of that supposed merging of Stanford and
Cal into a single monstrosity?
"I should like to address a nasty
rumor," Casper says."It is not true that
Stanford is discussing a merger with UC-
Berkeley. While there are many reasons
why we would not want to do that, the
dispositive one is Big Game. If we merged,
the 100 th Rig Game (next year at Stan-
would be an intramural event. That
would be an outcome no president of
Stanford should ever accept."
Intramural or not, I can think of one
outcome no president of Stanford should
accept. A loss to Cal this year. The Golden
Bears are really bad. folks. If it weren't
for Pat Barnes, they would be downright
hideous. Unfortunately, Barnes can't do
anything for the defense. Thus, their sec
ondary reeks worse than the month-old
milk still sitting in Xanadus refrigerator,
and their linebackers rot like the slab of
beef on the shelf above the milk.
Stanford undoubtedly has the advan
tage on defense. Offensively, the Cardinal
slips into lobotomized states of stagnation
at times. Fortunately, the squad won't
need to do much to score on Cal.
Casper's prediction is ... well ... pre
dictable. "Stanford 24. Cal much lower
