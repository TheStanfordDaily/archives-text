Dear Schopenhauer's Ghost,
I'm having a problem with my social life.
Every time I find a boy I like, I get bored.
Then I have to be mean to make him go
away. The problem is, when he does go away,
I get sad and lonely. The cycle repeats itself
over and over again. What should I do?

Dear Noel,
Your problem is not unusual. Life is a pendu
lum that swings between frustration and bore
dom. You must realize that life is very bad
and was accidentally created by an omniscient
demon intent upon tormenting us. Try listen
ing to some music. I like Wagner's "Ride of
the Valkries." It will help you forget you are
alive.
Sincerely,
Schopenhauer's Ghost
Dear Schopenhauer's Ghost,
I've been reading Hegel lately and now I

think I finally understand Karl Marx! Did
you like to converse with Hegel between lec
tures and publications while you were alive?

Dear Puck,
Georg Hegel was a silly man and worth less
than the panties he wore beneath his frock. He
smelled of a most peculiar odor and his head
was full of ferries and gnomes. I advise you to
steer clear of this most lecherous spirit. I don t
know who this Karl Marx is you refer to, but
if he's anything like the man he aspires to
become, he's no better than a succubus and
that is not good, da, so I say to you, stay
away!
Yours etc,
Schopenhauer's Ghost
Dear Schopenhauer's Ghost,
I'm anachronistic and extremely harsh on
existential do-do heads. I don't care if there's
any truth to anything you ever wrote or said.
It makes me sad and therefore can't be true.

I prefer Ayn
Rand any time
of day! So
there, you
scumbag!

Dear Rachel,

I do not listen to critics. Any one who differs
from my point of view is dumb. Even now,
while I serve Satan in hell's dark catacombs,
1 am unfazed by the disparaging commentary
spewed forth from the depraved creatures 1
work with. So enjoy the air you breath while
you live. Sound fades into the darkness from
whence it emerged and so shall you.
Your friend.
