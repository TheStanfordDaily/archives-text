# When all efforts fail, try for the pickup line
## 
### Esther Pan Staff writer 
It's dark, smoky and
very late at night.
Across a crowded dance
floor, you see the girl or
guy of your dreams.
Mustering your
courage, you walk over
and say:
"Uh, hi. Weren't we
in CIV together?"
Nice try.
For those brave souls
who seek to challenge
the Stanford no-dating
curse, the age-old dilem
ma of how to approach
someone you don't
know continues to baf
fle.
While most Stanford
students meet each

UlllCl lIKUUO,
in cluss or while participating in an activi
ty, it is a big enough school that there are
always new people to meet. In those tricky
situations, the answer could be a snappy,
time-tested tool: the pickup line.
Very few students admit to actually
using pickup lines. Most disdain them;
they seem to feel like senior Jay Clyne,
who said, "There are much more subtle
and clever ways to meet people."
Senior Pcikwen Cheng claims, "I don't
know anyone who uses them — or maybe

Johnny Zannis — Daily
they just don't admit it. Either they feel
really stupid about it or else they have
something so sweet they don't want any
one else to know about it."
Cheng was gracious enough to share
his favorite pickup line: He walks up to a
girl, taps her on the shoulder and whis
pers, "Yo, baby."
Given the prevalence of pickup line use
in the outside world, it shouldn't be sur
prising that many in the Stanford commu-

nity have either used or had lines
used on them.
Coterminal student Jan Leu
once had someone ask her, "Why
aren't you wearing your school
color? Oh, it's in your lips."
Chrissy Hsieh, a senior, was
told by a well-known water polo
player that she looked like a com
bination of his stepmother and
his ex-girlfriend.
Senior Wendy McKibben re
members one guy coming up to
her freshman year and asking,
"Can I braid your hair?" "It was
so strange," she said, "I had to
say yes."
Sanam Lari, a senior, was in a
San Francisco bar when a man
asked, "What's your fantasy?"
No stranger to the snappy come
back, she shot back, "Not you."
And never underestimate the
power of directness. Senior
Buzzy Spain remembered a fe
male friend, after flirting with
someone all night, finally asking,
"So are you going to kiss me or
what?"
Foreign experience
Away from the Farm, the pick
up line phenomenon explodes.
Especially for female students
studying abroad, a whole new
world of sketchy and aggressive
men opens up.
A junior, opening the door to
her hotel room in France, felt a
tap on her shoulder. A middle
aged man was standing there,
and pointed to the room number
on his key. "After," he said. "If
you wish."
Senior Carie Lemack was in "a
dark bar in Ecuador — really,
there was no light, and this guy
kept saying to me, 'Your eyes are
shining like the stars.' "
In Barcelona, senior Angela
Amarillas was stunned when a
man riding a moped pulled out of
traffic and onto the sidewalk in
front of her. "Hey, baby," he said,
"can I lick your shoes?"
In Paris, Stanford administra
tors reportedly warn about
French men. If you're a woman
sitting alone, the standard pick
up line is, "Is this place free?" to
which the accepted "no" re
sponse is, "I'm waiting for some
one." If you say yes, watch out:
It's taken as a sign of interest.

One Paris student was sitting
innocently in a cafe when a man
started walking by her table and
saying, "Coo-coo" (the French
equivalent of "yoo-hoo.") "He
kept doing it until I left," she
said. "It was so random."
There's no need even to men
tion Italian men.
And then there's the obvious
line for young expatriates
abroad: "Are you American?" To
which the most common, exas
perated reply is, "No."
Hey, you look just like . . .
Then there are the strange
people out there who think they
can compliment you by compar
ing you to someone, preferably
famous and (hopefully) attrac
tive.

If someone tells you that you
look like Kevin Kline or have eyes
like Elizabeth Taylor, they might
get somewhere. But it doesn't
seem to work that way.
Meredith McMorrow, a senior
who studied in Paris last winter,
was told, "You look just like that
movie star, Sharon Stone."
"Yeah," she answered, "except
that I'm brunette."
One student with long dark
hair was stopped on her way to
class by someone who said she
looked just like Winnie Cooper
(from"The Wonder Years" TV
series) riding a bike. "Did Winnie
Cooper have a bike?" she won
dered afterward.
In the end, pickup lines are
only as good as the smile behind
them. In the smart and cynical

'90s, few would use a pickup line
in earnest. The only way a one
liner could possibly work these
days is as self-conscious mock
ery: "You and I both know this is
corny as hell, but aren't I cute for
trying?"
Senior Blake Harris had some
wisdom to share on the subject.
"Pickup lines are so cheese," he
said. "I think, pickup line: Blue
Chalk. I want nothing to do with
that."
Many students agree or feel
they're never in a situation
where they'd actually use one.
"Actually, that's not true," ad
mitted Harris. "I just don't have
the chutzpah to walk up to a
woman and say that."
"Besides," he added, "it's the
'90s. She should come to me."
