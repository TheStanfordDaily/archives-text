## Classes will begin next quarter 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
The Faculty
Senate approved
four new majors
as part of the in
terdisciplinary
Program in Com
parative Studies
in Race and Eth
nicity yesterday.
The unani
mous decision

caps more than 25 years of effort
by students, faculty and alumni to
create an ethnic studies program
at Stanford.
The senate yesterday granted
the program authority to nomi
nate candidates for bachelor's de
grees for five years, beginning Jan.
1. Interdisciplinary programs
often are approved for five-year pe
riods.
The new program consists of
four separate majors in Asian

American studies, Chicano stud
ies, Native American studies and
comparative studies in race and
ethnicity.
Classes for these majors will be
offered as early as next quarter but
program administrators do not
know when students will be able to
declare a major or minor.
Chicano and Asian American
studies majors have come in re
sponse to student demands, which
came to a head in 1994. That May,
members of Stanford's Chicano
community launched a hunger
strike, demanding, among other
things, the creation of a Chicano
studies major. Asian American
studies advocates disrupted a Fac
ulty Senate meeting later that
month with a similar demand.
Committees were formed to ex
amine the possibility of implement
ing those majors, which would add
several ethnic studies possibilities
