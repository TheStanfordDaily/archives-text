# Fac Sen OKs CSRE majors
## Classes will begin next quarter 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
The Faculty
Senate approved
four new majors
as part of the in
terdisciplinary
Program in Com
parative Studies
in Race and Eth
nicity yesterday.
The unani
mous decision

caps more than 25 years of effort
by students, faculty and alumni to
create an ethnic studies program
at Stanford.
The senate yesterday granted
the program authority to nomi
nate candidates for bachelor's de
grees for five years, beginning Jan.
1. Interdisciplinary programs
often are approved for five-year pe
riods.
The new program consists of
four separate majors in Asian

American studies, Chicano stud
ies, Native American studies and
comparative studies in race and
ethnicity.
Classes for these majors will be
offered as early as next quarter but
program administrators do not
know when students will be able to
declare a major or minor.
Chicano and Asian American
studies majors have come in re
sponse to student demands, which
came to a head in 1994. That May,
members of Stanford's Chicano
community launched a hunger
strike, demanding, among other
things, the creation of a Chicano
studies major. Asian American
studies advocates disrupted a Fac
ulty Senate meeting later that
month with a similar demand.
Committees were formed to ex
amine the possibility of implement
ing those majors, which would add
several ethnic studies possibilities


Saldivar
to those that already existed
through the 25-year-old program in
African and Afro-American Stud
ies. A plan for the comparative eth
nic studies major first was an
nounced in February 1995.
According to a detailed proposal
for the program released this
week, a small group of CSRE
courses will be cross-listed by next
quarter, Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Ramon Saldi
var said. Advising and mentoring
programs will also begin in the
winter.
Students involved in the CSRE
program will have a coherent
course of study, said Saldi'var. All
of its majors require a shared set of
core courses that emphasize cross
ethnic and international compar
isons.
Core courses will be offered
spring quarter. "Winter quarter is
really serving as the groundwork
for the real opening of CSRE,"

Saldi'var said. "All the core courses
are either ready to go or in the
process of being developed."
The curriculum committee will
now "move at full speed" to final
ize details of the infant program,
he added. A subcommittee has al
ready been developed by the CSRE
steering committee to attend to is
sues such as listing courses in the
winter quarter time schedule and
creating forms for students to de
clare majors and minors.
An informational session will be
held the second week of winter
quarter to discuss the structure of
the new majors. "Students should
be able to get a good sense of what
each entails," said History Prof. A 1
Camarillo, who will chair the pro
gram.
Talks are under way with the
leadership in the African and Afro-
American Studies and Jewish
Studies programs to figure out a
way to integrate the two programs
into CSRE. According to Dean of
Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven, there is a strong interest
to strengthen those ties.
A research institute will also be

established in conjunction with
the new program. It will be co-di
rected by History Prof. George
Fredrickson and Psychology Prof.
Claude Steele.
"The goal of an institute is high
level social studies and humanities
research of issues of race and eth
nicity in a comparative perspec
tive," Saldlvar said. "It will allow
for the dissemination of new
knowledge in this area."
The joint strength of both the
research side and undergraduate
study contribute to the coherence
of the program as a whole. "I'm re
ally happy" about the senate ap
proval, Saldivar said. "Faculty
support makes or breaks [interdis
ciplinary programs]. CSRE has a
great deal of student support
matched with a broad-based facul
ty support." These ingredients will
contribute much to a strong start
for the new program.
The research institute will or
ganize colloquia, seminars and
speakers. "It will be a place where
both graduate and undergraduate
students will interact in a very ef
fective way." Plans are also begin

ning to be discussed for a national
conference hosted by Stanford on
racial relations in 1999.
Camarillo does not expect a
large number of CSRE majors in
the next few years. "My expecta
tion is there will be 50 to 100 ma
jors across the program in the next
three years," he said. "But I
wouldn't be surprised if there were
five or six times as many minors."
However, success of the pro
gram is not measured in the num
ber of majors or minors accrued.
The goal of the program, as out
lined in the proposal by the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies,
is to "provide students with
unique opportunities for compara
tive study of the subjects of race
and ethnicity in the U.S. and inter
nationally."
Stanford's CSRE program is ex
pected to be a leader in the study of
race and ethnicity issues in the
country.
"We've been receiving phone
calls from universities all over the
country," said Saldivar. "We are
leading the way into the next cen
tury."
