## Ideas include fewer texts, name change 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Comments and criticisms re
garding changes in the Cultures,
Ideas and Values Program were
traded in a discussion at the Facul
ty Senate meeting yesterday.
The discussion followed an in
terim report from the CIV Review
Committee given by its chair, Eng
lish Prof. Robert Polhemus.
In his report, Polhemus de
tailed a number of recommenda
tions — ranging from assigning'
fewer texts for students to read to
changing the name of the program
itself — that the commission is ex
amining.
"A lot of people are very grate
ful for CIV, but we do need to make
it better," he said.
Polhemus reported that the
commission has decided to clarify
the document that describes the
requirements for CIV in order to
aid instructors.
"We would like to make it a
more flexible, shorter and simpler

governing document," he said.
"We'd like to place more faith in
those teaching the course."
Several faculty members
praised the move.
"The simplification of (the doc
ument] is, in and of itself, an
achievement," English Prof. John
Bender said. "The rules pose
tremendous obstacles."
The commission also recom
mended that CIV remain a three
quarter requirement
"Having three quarters of CIV
is of great value," Polhemus said
"We can preserve the excellence}
that are there but make them bet
ter."
The commission is also consid
ering a "one-plus-two" structure
or changing the current require
ment in favor of a small number o!
large-enrollment courses in tht
fall followed by a larger number of
two-quarter courses similar to the
present CIV tracks.
