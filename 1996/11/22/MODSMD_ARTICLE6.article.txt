# CIV under review
## Ideas include fewer texts, name change 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Comments and criticisms re
garding changes in the Cultures,
Ideas and Values Program were
traded in a discussion at the Facul
ty Senate meeting yesterday.
The discussion followed an in
terim report from the CIV Review
Committee given by its chair, Eng
lish Prof. Robert Polhemus.
In his report, Polhemus de
tailed a number of recommenda
tions — ranging from assigning'
fewer texts for students to read to
changing the name of the program
itself — that the commission is ex
amining.
"A lot of people are very grate
ful for CIV, but we do need to make
it better," he said.
Polhemus reported that the
commission has decided to clarify
the document that describes the
requirements for CIV in order to
aid instructors.
"We would like to make it a
more flexible, shorter and simpler

governing document," he said.
"We'd like to place more faith in
those teaching the course."
Several faculty members
praised the move.
"The simplification of (the doc
ument] is, in and of itself, an
achievement," English Prof. John
Bender said. "The rules pose
tremendous obstacles."
The commission also recom
mended that CIV remain a three
quarter requirement
"Having three quarters of CIV
is of great value," Polhemus said
"We can preserve the excellence}
that are there but make them bet
ter."
The commission is also consid
ering a "one-plus-two" structure
or changing the current require
ment in favor of a small number o!
large-enrollment courses in tht
fall followed by a larger number of
two-quarter courses similar to the
present CIV tracks.
T J ii
examining changing the name of
CIV.
"In changing the name, we
want to do something beyond the
trivial," Polhemus said. "We want
to make the rose smell sweeter and
look and appear more beautiful."
One faculty member expressed
his concern that the proposed
changes were not substantial
enough.
"CIV costs a couple of million a
year and takes up 20 percent of a
freshman's time," said Statistics
Prof. Bradley Efron. "Is it doing
wonderful things? These seem to
be very modest, small changes."
Provost Condoleezza Rice, an ex
officio member of the committee,
expressed her support for the com
mittee.
"There is a concern over time
that the program is not fulfilling
its mission, but a program like this
is important," she said. "Some of
the committee's ideas are pretty

revolutionary."
Polhemus added that the com
mission had worked to confront
the problem of change over time.
"The interest in the humanities
that we used to take for granted is
not the same," he said. "Students
don't like being locked in without
any choice."
In other business at the meet
ing, University President Gerhard
Casper responded to a question re
garding the impact on academics of
the recently approved merger of
Stanford Health Services and the
UC-San Francisco Medical Center.
"The merger is clearly going to
have an impact on the medical
schools," Casper said. "But we
haven't even begun to explore
some issues that will emerge."
He added that it is impossible to
examine some of the implications
of the merger until the transaction
is completed next July.
"We have the chance to have
something very unique in our na
tion," he said. "This partnership
will be the greatest concentration of
medical expertise in the West. There
is a very strong positive case for this."
