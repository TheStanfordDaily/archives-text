Join Us After
A Long Day Of
Rushing, Driving,
And Hiking.
The players aren't the-only ones who've
put in a hard day at the Stadium. So come
celebrate your endurance at Gordon
Biersch. Our newly remodeled, air
conditioned Brewery/ Restaurant can
accommodate groups of any size.
We've got a great new menu and an
assortment of German style lagers.
Call today to schedule your post-game
party. Or stop by.
