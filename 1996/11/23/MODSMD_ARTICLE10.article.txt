# Cal/Stanford Matchups
## 
### 
Tony Gonzalez ate up the Car
dinal defense last year, making 10
catches for 150 yards and a touch
down. However, he was also the
goat, making a critical fumble in
the fourth quarter that set up
Stanford's game-winning touch
down. It seems to have had little
carryover this season, as the ju
nior tight end has 42 catches for
678 yards. Eliel Swinton enters
his final Big Game of his career.
The senior strong safety is fourth
on the team in tackles with 70, has
recovered two fumbles and inter
cepted a pass.
Benjamin has been a consis
tent performer in the Bears' of
fense over the last couple of sea
sons. The Golden Bear senior is
tied with Gonzalez in receptions
with 42 to go along with his 661
receiving yards. Pruitt is also
nearing the end of his football ca
reer. It has been a fruitful one for
the Stanford corner, as he has in
tercepted 11 passes in nearly
three years of play on the defen
sive side of the ball.
Longwell has finally come
around after a horrific sophomore
year where he made only 8 of 22
field goal attempts. This season,
the senior place-kicker has made
11 of 16 attempts, including a ca
reer-long of 52 against San Jose
State. He also doubles as the
punter, averaging a decent 44.9
yards a kick. However, the Bear
senior is not the only double-duty
kicker in the Bay Area. Miller has
shown the same abilities, al
though on a bit smaller scale. He
has connected on 10 of 16 field
goals while barely averaging more
than 40 yards per punt.
Beck has been among the most
consistent tacklers Cal has had all
season. He has reached double fig
ures in six of the nine games he
has played in, including a season
high 14 last week against Oregon.
He will need another big effort to
help stop Stanford's Mike
Mitchell. The running back has
become the Cardinal's most con
sistent performer on the offense,
accounting for 886 yards in total
offense while leading the team
with five touchdowns. The senior
back also needs 68 more rushing
yards to move into fourth place on
the Stanford all-time rushing list.
Pat Barnes, with the help of
seven overtime periods, has put up
remarkable numbers in Steve
Mariucci's West Coast offense.
The senior is one touchdown pass
away from tying Arizona State's
Mike Pagel's Pacific 10 Confer
ence record of 29 scoring tosses in
a season. As for the beloved Art
Barnes, he will be retiring at the
conclusion of the year from direct
ing the wild and crazy Stanford
Band. He has seen them grow
through the 33 years that he has
led them and now, he will move on.
After seeing the venerable Dr.
Barnes sing "I Feel Good" at last
Saturday's home game, there is no
doubt that he will age gracefully.
We could go on about the histo
ry of the Axe and the funny sto
ries, but it really boils down to one
simple thing: We have the Axe
after getting it back last year with
a 29-24 victorv at home. What
does Cal have? ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING!
