# Tim Smith makes a smooth switch to safety
## Ex-quarterback emerges as team's hard hitter on defense, special teams 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
Tim Smith came to Stanford expecting to
make big plays on the football field for the Car
dinal — he never expected to be making them
on defense, though.
But that is what the free safety, who arrived
on the Farm last year as one of the top-rated
high school quarterbacks in the nation, has
been doing ever since he made a key intercep
tion six games ago to key Stanford's comeback
victory over Oregon.
Smith "has progressed and gotten better
each week, but I think you can say that for a lot
of our guys," said head coach Tyrone Willing
ham. "That's what you like a team to do — you
like the team to make a steady climb as op
posed to peaking and not being sure what di
rection they are going."
The Cardinal, which earned its third
straight victory Saturday with a 33-17 win
against Washington State, has definitely been
going in the right direction over the last few
weeks.
And so has Smith.
The Coalinga, Calif., native, who only
began playing free safety during the last week
of spring drills, had the best game of his young
career Saturday, racking up six tackles (one
for a loss) and one sack, causing one fumble
and making an interception.
"Tim's play [last week] was huge," said ju
nior defensive lineman Kailee Wong. "That
guy was all over the field making huge plays —
I can't even say big plays because they were
huge — and he wasjust helping the team win."
Perhaps Smith's biggest play Saturday
came on special teams when Smith threw a
bone-crunching block that cleared the way for
Cardinal punt returner Troy Walters to scam
per across the field for a 75-yard touchdown
that tied the game at 14-14 just before the end
of the first half.
"I just thank my teammates for giving me
the blocks I needed," Walters said. "I saw Tim
Smith early on [in the return] and he gave me
the one block that got me to the edge."
Willingham was quick to echo Walters' sen
timents about the block. "That was a big block
on the punt return, and [Smith] made some
big hits down field. He just keeps getting bet
ter and better each week," Willingham said.
Smith just got better and better against the
Cougars, too. After the block on the punt re
turn, Smith got tough on defense. After Stan
ford took the lead 21-17 in the third quarter,
Smith began causing turnovers on key plays.
With 6 minutes, 20 seconds left in the third
quarter, the Cougars took possession on their
own 23-yard line. Quarterback Ryan Leaf
dropped back to pass and was crushed by
Smith, who came on a safety blitz. The ball
popped loose and junior tackle Carl Hansen re
covered on the Cougar 17-yard line.

The turnover led to a Kevin Miller field goal
that gave the Cardinal a 24-17 lead. Smith
wasn't done though, as he came up big on
Washington State's next possession. With the
Cougars backed up to their own 7-yard line,
Leaf was pressured by the Cardinal front four
and threw an errant pass that landed in
Smith's arms at the 32-yard line. Smith ran
the ball back to the Cougar 1 and set up the
Cardinal's final touchdown of the day.
Smith has recorded 27 tackles this season,
including three for losses, and has tallied three
sacks and three interceptions. In addition, he
has blocked a field goal attempt and caused a
fumble.

His emergence, although a surprise to
some, hardly shocks his teammates. "He's tall
and has good speed and is able to cover the
deep routes over the m iddle," said start ing free
safety Josh Madsen, who many view as
Smith's mentor. "He's going to be a great play
er."
It seems that Smith isn't exactly surprised
at his improvement at a position that he began
playingjust five months ago, either. "It proba
bly has to do with confidence and also learning
the defense and feeling more comfortable
knowing exactly what to do. It started [with
the Oregon game] and just kept rolling from
then on."
It's not just that Smith has been making
the routine plays he should make, but he has
been making them at clutch times. All of it,
Smith said, comes with experience. "I would
say that now I am starting to get a better feel
with the defense," he said. "It is becoming in
ternalized for me, and I can make plays better
now, which is what the job asks for."
Perhaps the best part of Smith's game is his
simplicity. Following Saturday's win, which it
is safe to say was guaranteed by the 10 points
that the Cardinal scored off the turnovers
Smith caused, a reporter posed to Smith a
ridiculously long and inane question asking
him to analyze his own play.
"I just play," replied a smiling Smith. "It's
as simple as that."

Sophomore free safety Tim Smith runs upfield after his interception last week against
Washington State. Smith had a great day against the Cougars, forcing a fumble, re
turning an interception to the Cougar 1-yard line and making a jarring hit that sprang
Troy Walters loose on his 75-yard punt return for a touchdown.
Tim Smith came to Stanford expecting to
make big plays on the football field for the Car
dinal — he never expected to be making them
on defense, though.
But that is what the free safety, who arrived
on the Farm last year as one of the top-rated
high school quarterbacks in the nation, has
been doing ever since he made a key intercep
tion six games ago to key Stanford's comeback
victory over Oregon.
Smith "has progressed and gotten better
each week, but I think you can say that for a lot
of our guys," said head coach Tyrone Willing
ham. "That's what you like a team to do — you
like the team to make a steady climb as op
posed to peaking and not being sure what di
rection they are going."
The Cardinal, which earned its third
straight victory Saturday with a 33-17 win
against Washington State, has definitely been
going in the right direction over the last few
weeks.
And so has Smith.
The Coalinga, Calif., native, who only
began playing free safety during the last week
of spring drills, had the best game of his young
career Saturday, racking up six tackles (one
for a loss) and one sack, causing one fumble
and making an interception.
"Tim's play [last week] was huge," said ju
nior defensive lineman Kailee Wong. "That
guy was all over the field making huge plays —
I can't even say big plays because they were
huge — and he wasjust helping the team win."
Perhaps Smith's biggest play Saturday
came on special teams when Smith threw a
bone-crunching block that cleared the way for
Cardinal punt returner Troy Walters to scam
per across the field for a 75-yard touchdown
that tied the game at 14-14 just before the end
of the first half.
"I just thank my teammates for giving me
the blocks I needed," Walters said. "I saw Tim
Smith early on [in the return] and he gave me
the one block that got me to the edge."
Willingham was quick to echo Walters' sen
timents about the block. "That was a big block
on the punt return, and [Smith] made some
big hits down field. He just keeps getting bet
ter and better each week," Willingham said.
Smith just got better and better against the
Cougars, too. After the block on the punt re
turn, Smith got tough on defense. After Stan
ford took the lead 21-17 in the third quarter,
Smith began causing turnovers on key plays.
With 6 minutes, 20 seconds left in the third
quarter, the Cougars took possession on their
own 23-yard line. Quarterback Ryan Leaf
dropped back to pass and was crushed by
Smith, who came on a safety blitz. The ball
popped loose and junior tackle Carl Hansen re
covered on the Cougar 17-yard line.

The turnover led to a Kevin Miller field goal
that gave the Cardinal a 24-17 lead. Smith
wasn't done though, as he came up big on
Washington State's next possession. With the
Cougars backed up to their own 7-yard line,
Leaf was pressured by the Cardinal front four
and threw an errant pass that landed in
Smith's arms at the 32-yard line. Smith ran
the ball back to the Cougar 1 and set up the
Cardinal's final touchdown of the day.
Smith has recorded 27 tackles this season,
including three for losses, and has tallied three
sacks and three interceptions. In addition, he
has blocked a field goal attempt and caused a
fumble.

His emergence, although a surprise to
some, hardly shocks his teammates. "He's tall
and has good speed and is able to cover the
deep routes over the m iddle," said start ing free
safety Josh Madsen, who many view as
Smith's mentor. "He's going to be a great play
er."
It seems that Smith isn't exactly surprised
at his improvement at a position that he began
playingjust five months ago, either. "It proba
bly has to do with confidence and also learning
the defense and feeling more comfortable
knowing exactly what to do. It started [with
the Oregon game] and just kept rolling from
then on."
It's not just that Smith has been making
the routine plays he should make, but he has
been making them at clutch times. All of it,
Smith said, comes with experience. "I would
say that now I am starting to get a better feel
with the defense," he said. "It is becoming in
ternalized for me, and I can make plays better
now, which is what the job asks for."
Perhaps the best part of Smith's game is his
simplicity. Following Saturday's win, which it
is safe to say was guaranteed by the 10 points
that the Cardinal scored off the turnovers
Smith caused, a reporter posed to Smith a
ridiculously long and inane question asking
him to analyze his own play.
"I just play," replied a smiling Smith. "It's
as simple as that."

Perhaps the best part of Smith's game is his
simplicity. Following Saturday's win, which it
is safe to say was guaranteed by the 10 points
that the Cardinal scored off the turnovers
Smith caused, a reporter posed to Smith a
ridiculously long and inane question asking
him to analyze his own play.
"I just play," replied a smiling Smith. "It's
as simple as that."

Matt Garlinghouse — Daily file
Sophomore free safety Tim Smith runs upfield after his interception last week against
Washington State. Smith had a great day against the Cougars, forcing a fumble, re
turning an interception to the Cougar 1-yard line and making a jarring hit that sprang
Troy Walters loose on his 75-yard punt return for a touchdown.
