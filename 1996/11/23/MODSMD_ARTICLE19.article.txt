# Tony Gonzalez pulls double duty for Bears
## Junior tight end emerges as starter on gridiron, basketball team for Cal 
### Yash Meta Special to Cardinal Today 
For a man with millions of dollars
waiting for him the instant he offers
his services to the NFL, it's hard to
believe that Tony Gonzalez could
not even pay to play football at. one
point in his life.
As a young boy, Gonzalez, now a
fiercely imposing athletic specimen,
was soft, afraid and just plain awful
at sports. Of course, California's 6-
foot-6, 240-pound two-sport star
has not always commanded the
same awe that he does now while
jabbing elbows into opponents to get
a rebound for the basketball team or
when leveling outside linebackers
before corralling a touchdown pass

for the football team.
"I've worked pretty hard to be at
where I am today," Gonzalez said.
"There's a sense of accomplishment,
especially considering where I came
from. A lot of people didn't think I
was going to make it this far."
One of those individuals was his
sixth-grade Pop Warner football
coach, who didn't even allow Gonza
lez to play in his six plays per game
as promised by paying the youth
league's entrance fees. At the team's
year-end banquet, the coach told the
backup tailback that he could have
been a better player if stopped "run
ning like you're walking on eggs."
Today, Gonzalez is walking on
air. The junior tight end is a second
team preseason All-American on the

gridiron, according to one national
publication, and has caught 42 pass
es for 678 yards and four scores for
the Bears. Also, he returns to the
basketball team after starting at
power forward on last year's NCAA
tournament squad. However, no
body would have guessed that Gon
zalez would be the dominant athlete
that he is today. The Huntington
Beach, Calif., native was always the
biggest guy on the block, but he was
neither the best nor the bravest.
"I was a little scared, and I didn't
really like football that much," Gon
zalez said. "I was forced into it. My
brother played it, and my family al
ways watched football while I was
growing up."
In fact, Gonzalez, a square
jawed, muscle-bound, classic big
man-on-campus giant, was so de
mure that he was bullied as an ado
lescent. The antagonizer was a high
school student who picked on Gon
zalez as an eighth-grader.
"Every day as soon as the bell
rang I just got on my skateboard to
go home as fast as I could," Gonzalez
said. "Everybody else was saying
that this guy was the toughest guy.
They said he once fought two guys at
once and won. They said he once
smashed a brick on one guy's head. I
thought that this guy would kill me
if I got in a fight with him."
Gonzalez' paranoia sent him into
hiding for six months, preventing
him from engaging in normal teen
age activities.
"I didn't go to dances, parties,
gatherings and didn't even hang
around the neighborhood," Gonza
lez said. "I thought that if he saw me
he was going to kick my butt."
The underground life continued
after his junior-high graduation
where Gonzalez hid behind a wall
after learning that his tormentor
was in attendance.
"My entire family said at the
same time, 'Where's Tony?' and
they saw me and I looked up and all
of their faces just dropped in disap
pointment," Gonzalez said. "I felt so
ashamed of myself. I wouldn't even
talk to my family after my own grad
uation.
"From that moment on, I decided
I'm not going to run from anybody,
I'm not going to back down from any
challenge."
The newly assertive Gonzalez
ended his two-year abstention from
football and began playing in high
school. He soon started to conquer
every challenge, earning national
recognition for his athletic exploits
in both high school and then college.
Gonzalez' next step will be the
National Football League. It's just a
matter of when. The junior's stellar
pass-catching abilities and awesome
physical stature have wowed scouts,
who have projected him as a poten
tial first-round draft pick. Gonzalez'
size, strength and baby-soft hands
make him a prototypical tight end
prospect for the pro ranks.
After easing his way into the line
up during his freshman season at
Cal, Gonzalez took the team by
storm during his sophomore cam-

paign. He grabbed 37 passes for 541
yards and two touchdowns in his
second season. The tight end partic
ularly shined during last year's Big
Game, where he racked up 150
yards on 10 receptions.
"He's a good blocker and is un
derstanding more and more about
the passing game," said California
head coach Steve Mariucci. "He's a
veiy well-rounded tight end."
While Gonzalez was always a
blue-chip prospect in football, it has
been his contributions on the hard
wood that have surprised everyone.
Despite ranking among the top
100 basketball recruits in the nation
as a high school senior, he was still
perceived as simply a football player
in a basketball uniform — a royal
thug in a gold warmup jersey.
Although Gonzalez, who came to
Cal on a football scholarship but was
recruited by then-men's basketball
head coach Todd Bozeman as well,
insists that he shares an equal pas
sion for both sports.
"I take basketball very seriously
as far as offseason workouts go,"
Gonzalez said. "Basketball takes a
lot of time. It's not like football
where you can just get in the weight
room and practice running your 40
all summer long."
In fact, Gonzalez credited basket
ball for his improved dexterity and
aggressiveness in football.
"You've gotta work on your right
hand, left hand, jump shots and
body control," Gonzalez said, who
picked up the sport during eighth
grade. "Basketball gave me the con
fidence for football. They both just
came together at the same time."
They came together the same day
during his freshman season, when
Gonzalez made his basketball debut
after competing in the Big Game ear
lier that afternoon. He played only 4
minutes that night against High
Five America but went on to average
7.1 points in 16.3 minutes per con
test, including a 29-point, nine-re
bound explosion in the season finale
against Washington State.
Last year, Gonzalez earned a
starting position over returning Pa
cific 10 Conference Freshman of the
Year Tremaine Fowlkes midway
through the conference schedule.
Bozeman was rewarding the for

ward for his relentless physical style
under the basket.

This season, a depleted Bears
roster is again counting on Gonzalez
to provide his steady play. This
proposition has kept him interested
in remaining a two-sport athlete.
"At first, I was telling people that
after two years I will choose one
sport based on which direction I'm
heading, but that went out the win
dow last season because things were
going well," Gonzalez said. "People
said I could go into the NFL after my
junior year, so I must have been
doing something right. Obviously,
basketball wasn't inhibiting me."
Gonzalez occasionally dreams of
playing both sports at the next level,
but he realizes that touchdowns and
not rebounds will ultimately deter
mine his paychecks.
"Basketball players that are my
height who I can compare myself to
are Charles Barkley, Larry Johnson
and Anthony Mason, but I can't re
ally compare myself to them because
I haven't showed it on the floor,"
Gonzalez said. "They would all
make great tight ends, though. Who
could cover them?"
Right now, that's the question
that NFL scouts are asking of the
tight end, who has the luxury of
leaving school for a lavish contract
after the football season is over.
Presently, Gonzalez wants to re
main at Cal for all four years while
playing both of his sports in that
tenure. But only a few months ago,
he was having doubts about his stay
in Berkeley.
"At the end of last year I was
thinking that I made the worst
choice of my life by coming to Cal,"
Gonzalez said. "The only thing 1
liked about it was the atmosphere
and the city. As far as the Athletic
Department, though, I was like,
'What am I doing here?' "
Three years ago, Gonzalez
turned down offers from sports
powerhouses Notre Dame, Florida
State, Arizona, Washington and
Colorado to attend Cal. He was
lured by the fact that the football
team was just coming off of a victory
in the Alamo Bowl, and the basket
ball team had recently visited the
Sweet 16 in the NCAA tournament.
Since Gonzalez has arrived, how
ever, football has gone a combined
13-19, and hoops has overseen nu
merous player defections, a head
coaching change and an NCAA in
vestigation that may culminate in
the program's probation.
Only the new directions of both
teams have given Gonzalez incen
tive to stay in school.
"I'm never going to have the
chance to do this again, so why
should I leave now?"
Needless to say, Gonzalez will not
retreat from too many things any
more.
"I just hate the idea of being
afraid," Gonzalez said. "I believe
that life is a bunch of obstacles and
bad things are always going to come
up, so how you deal with them
shows your maturity and your char
acter."

point in his life.
As a young boy, Gonzalez, now a
fiercely imposing athletic specimen,
was soft, afraid and just plain awful
at sports. Of course, California's 6-
foot-6, 240-pound two-sport star
has not always commanded the
same awe that he does now while
jabbing elbows into opponents to get
a rebound for the basketball team or
when leveling outside linebackers
before corralling a touchdown pass

for the football team.
"I've worked pretty hard to be at
where I am today," Gonzalez said.
"There's a sense of accomplishment,
especially considering where I came
from. A lot of people didn't think I
was going to make it this far."
One of those individuals was his
sixth-grade Pop Warner football
coach, who didn't even allow Gonza
lez to play in his six plays per game
as promised by paying the youth
league's entrance fees. At the team's
year-end banquet, the coach told the
backup tailback that he could have
been a better player if stopped "run
ning like you're walking on eggs."
Today, Gonzalez is walking on
air. The junior tight end is a second
team preseason All-American on the

gridiron, according to one national
publication, and has caught 42 pass
es for 678 yards and four scores for
the Bears. Also, he returns to the
basketball team after starting at
power forward on last year's NCAA
tournament squad. However, no
body would have guessed that Gon
zalez would be the dominant athlete
that he is today. The Huntington
Beach, Calif., native was always the
biggest guy on the block, but he was
neither the best nor the bravest.
"I was a little scared, and I didn't
really like football that much," Gon
zalez said. "I was forced into it. My
brother played it, and my family al
ways watched football while I was
growing up."
In fact, Gonzalez, a square
jawed, muscle-bound, classic big
man-on-campus giant, was so de
mure that he was bullied as an ado
lescent. The antagonizer was a high
school student who picked on Gon
zalez as an eighth-grader.
"Every day as soon as the bell
rang I just got on my skateboard to
go home as fast as I could," Gonzalez
said. "Everybody else was saying
that this guy was the toughest guy.
They said he once fought two guys at
once and won. They said he once
smashed a brick on one guy's head. I
thought that this guy would kill me
if I got in a fight with him."
Gonzalez' paranoia sent him into
hiding for six months, preventing
him from engaging in normal teen
age activities.
"I didn't go to dances, parties,
gatherings and didn't even hang
around the neighborhood," Gonza
lez said. "I thought that if he saw me
he was going to kick my butt."
The underground life continued
after his junior-high graduation
where Gonzalez hid behind a wall
after learning that his tormentor
was in attendance.
"My entire family said at the
same time, 'Where's Tony?' and
they saw me and I looked up and all
of their faces just dropped in disap
pointment," Gonzalez said. "I felt so
ashamed of myself. I wouldn't even
talk to my family after my own grad
uation.
"From that moment on, I decided
I'm not going to run from anybody,
I'm not going to back down from any
challenge."
The newly assertive Gonzalez
ended his two-year abstention from
football and began playing in high
school. He soon started to conquer
every challenge, earning national
recognition for his athletic exploits
in both high school and then college.
Gonzalez' next step will be the
National Football League. It's just a
matter of when. The junior's stellar
pass-catching abilities and awesome
physical stature have wowed scouts,
who have projected him as a poten
tial first-round draft pick. Gonzalez'
size, strength and baby-soft hands
make him a prototypical tight end
prospect for the pro ranks.
After easing his way into the line
up during his freshman season at
Cal, Gonzalez took the team by
storm during his sophomore cam-

paign. He grabbed 37 passes for 541
yards and two touchdowns in his
second season. The tight end partic
ularly shined during last year's Big
Game, where he racked up 150
yards on 10 receptions.
"He's a good blocker and is un
derstanding more and more about
the passing game," said California
head coach Steve Mariucci. "He's a
veiy well-rounded tight end."
While Gonzalez was always a
blue-chip prospect in football, it has
been his contributions on the hard
wood that have surprised everyone.
Despite ranking among the top
100 basketball recruits in the nation
as a high school senior, he was still
perceived as simply a football player
in a basketball uniform — a royal
thug in a gold warmup jersey.
Although Gonzalez, who came to
Cal on a football scholarship but was
recruited by then-men's basketball
head coach Todd Bozeman as well,
insists that he shares an equal pas
sion for both sports.
"I take basketball very seriously
as far as offseason workouts go,"
Gonzalez said. "Basketball takes a
lot of time. It's not like football
where you can just get in the weight
room and practice running your 40
all summer long."
In fact, Gonzalez credited basket
ball for his improved dexterity and
aggressiveness in football.
"You've gotta work on your right
hand, left hand, jump shots and
body control," Gonzalez said, who
picked up the sport during eighth
grade. "Basketball gave me the con
fidence for football. They both just
came together at the same time."
They came together the same day
during his freshman season, when
Gonzalez made his basketball debut
after competing in the Big Game ear
lier that afternoon. He played only 4
minutes that night against High
Five America but went on to average
7.1 points in 16.3 minutes per con
test, including a 29-point, nine-re
bound explosion in the season finale
against Washington State.
Last year, Gonzalez earned a
starting position over returning Pa
cific 10 Conference Freshman of the
Year Tremaine Fowlkes midway
through the conference schedule.
Bozeman was rewarding the for

ward for his relentless physical style
under the basket.

This season, a depleted Bears
roster is again counting on Gonzalez
to provide his steady play. This
proposition has kept him interested
in remaining a two-sport athlete.
"At first, I was telling people that
after two years I will choose one
sport based on which direction I'm
heading, but that went out the win
dow last season because things were
going well," Gonzalez said. "People
said I could go into the NFL after my
junior year, so I must have been
doing something right. Obviously,
basketball wasn't inhibiting me."
Gonzalez occasionally dreams of
playing both sports at the next level,
but he realizes that touchdowns and
not rebounds will ultimately deter
mine his paychecks.
"Basketball players that are my
height who I can compare myself to
are Charles Barkley, Larry Johnson
and Anthony Mason, but I can't re
ally compare myself to them because
I haven't showed it on the floor,"
Gonzalez said. "They would all
make great tight ends, though. Who
could cover them?"
Right now, that's the question
that NFL scouts are asking of the
tight end, who has the luxury of
leaving school for a lavish contract
after the football season is over.
Presently, Gonzalez wants to re
main at Cal for all four years while
playing both of his sports in that
tenure. But only a few months ago,
he was having doubts about his stay
in Berkeley.
"At the end of last year I was
thinking that I made the worst
choice of my life by coming to Cal,"
Gonzalez said. "The only thing 1
liked about it was the atmosphere
and the city. As far as the Athletic
Department, though, I was like,
'What am I doing here?' "
Three years ago, Gonzalez
turned down offers from sports
powerhouses Notre Dame, Florida
State, Arizona, Washington and
Colorado to attend Cal. He was
lured by the fact that the football
team was just coming off of a victory
in the Alamo Bowl, and the basket
ball team had recently visited the
Sweet 16 in the NCAA tournament.
Since Gonzalez has arrived, how
ever, football has gone a combined
13-19, and hoops has overseen nu
merous player defections, a head
coaching change and an NCAA in
vestigation that may culminate in
the program's probation.
Only the new directions of both
teams have given Gonzalez incen
tive to stay in school.
"I'm never going to have the
chance to do this again, so why
should I leave now?"
Needless to say, Gonzalez will not
retreat from too many things any
more.
"I just hate the idea of being
afraid," Gonzalez said. "I believe
that life is a bunch of obstacles and
bad things are always going to come
up, so how you deal with them
shows your maturity and your char
acter."
