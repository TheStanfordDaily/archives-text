# Troy Walters comes on with late flourish
## Sophomore flanker provides added dimension to Cardinal attack 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
Despite standing 5-foot-8 and
weighing just 170 pounds, sopho
more Troy Walters has become one
of the most intimidating Cardinal
players on the football field each
Saturday.
Walters, who took a redshirt
season a year ago, has slowly
turned into the Cardinal's most re
liable and dangerous receiver and
quarterback Chad Hutchinson's
favorite receiver.
"He's really developed into one
of my main receivers," Hutchinson
said. "You can't overlook him be
cause of his size because he'll burn
you; he'll burn you in so many
ways."

handedly got Stanford back in the
game with an unbelievable 51-yard
circus catch that went for a touch
down just before halftime.
Walters' "catch on the sideline
was what you talk about big-time
players doing," said Cardinal head
coach Tyrone Willingham. "He is
one of the players who has stepped
up at the appropriate times."
In the second half against the
Bruins, Hutchinson continued to
find Walters open during key
plays. Walters finished the game
with eight catches for 144 yards
and one touchdown. His perfor
mance against UCLA is what
seems to have really set the tone
for Walters in the last few weeks.
"After [the UCLA game], I felt
that if I did all of the little things,
then I could succeed and do big
things," Walters said. "So that's
what I try to do, just go out and do
the little things right."
Walters has continued doing
things right all season and has
shone every time he's had a chance
to make a big play. "Early on I
played sparingly, so every time I

got my chance I wanted to make
something happen and do all the
right things.
"Every time I go out and touch
the ball, I want to make a big play.
That's the only way you can make
big plays, by touching the ball, and
I think the coaches are getting
more confidence in me and putting
me in those situations where I can
make the plays."
Walters' numbers as a receiver
have steadily risen all season. In
the first seven games, he averaged
just 1.6 catches and 21.8 yards re
ceiving per game. However, in
Stanford's last three games, Wal
ters has averaged 5.3 catches and
69.7 receiving yards per game.
He is now third on the team in
receptions with 27 and has a total
of 362 receiving yards on the sea
son. In addition, his 13.4 yards per
catch average is tops among the
Cardinal's regular receivers. A lot
of his improvement, according to
Walters, is due mainly to experi
ence and his laid-back attitude.
"I think as the games went on, I
gained more confidence," he said.
"I know what to expect out of the
defense, and all the pressure
doesn't get to me. I'm just relaxed
and going out and having fun."
His teammates have taken no
tice of his rising confidence level as
well. "He brings an air of confi
dence with him," Hutchinson said.
"We have some plays that are di
rected for him, and everybody has
confidence that he is going to make
a great play because he has that
kind of ability."
Walters has also shown im
provement within the Cardinal's
punt-return game, which he took
over halfway through the second
game of the season when Anthony
Bookman went down with a sepa
rated shoulder.
Since then, Walters has fielded
20 punts for 239 yards, an average
of 11.9 yards per return. His best
return of the season came last Sat
urday, when Walters electrified
the crowd with a 75-yard juant for
a touchdown. The touchdown
came with just 22 seconds left in
the first half and tied the game
with Washington State at 14-14.
"We've always known that we
have big playmakers on special
teams," Walters said, whose touch
down return on Saturday was the
Cardinal's first since Glyn Mil
burn's 76-yard return in the 1992
Big Game. "We wanted to show the
world and show everybody in the
stands that we can make plays, and
we did."
In spite of his success in past
weeks, Walters remains unusually
humble. "I just thank my team
mates and my coaches for having
confidence in me," he said. "I just
go out and have fun — that's the

key, going out, having fun and
doing what I've got to do."
In approaching the biggest game
of his young career — today's Big
Game — Walters will once again be
called on to make the big plays. And

despite the importance of the game
and the burden that has been
placed on his shoulders, Walters re
mains calm and confident.
"I am going to try to keep it like
any other game. It's going to be

tough, but that's what you have to
do," he said. "It's just the next
game, so that's why it's a big game.
"If we just go out and execute
and play our game, then we'll be all
right."

coach Tyrone Willingham. "He is
one of the players who has stepped
up at the appropriate times."
In the second half against the
Bruins, Hutchinson continued to
find Walters open during key
plays. Walters finished the game
with eight catches for 144 yards
and one touchdown. His perfor
mance against UCLA is what
seems to have really set the tone
for Walters in the last few weeks.
"After [the UCLA game], I felt
that if I did all of the little things,
then I could succeed and do big
things," Walters said. "So that's
what I try to do, just go out and do
the little things right."
Walters has continued doing
things right all season and has
shone every time he's had a chance
to make a big play. "Early on I
played sparingly, so every time I

got my chance I wanted to make
something happen and do all the
right things.
"Every time I go out and touch
the ball, I want to make a big play.
That's the only way you can make
big plays, by touching the ball, and
I think the coaches are getting
more confidence in me and putting
me in those situations where I can
make the plays."
Walters' numbers as a receiver
have steadily risen all season. In
the first seven games, he averaged
just 1.6 catches and 21.8 yards re
ceiving per game. However, in
Stanford's last three games, Wal
ters has averaged 5.3 catches and
69.7 receiving yards per game.
He is now third on the team in
receptions with 27 and has a total
of 362 receiving yards on the sea
son. In addition, his 13.4 yards per
catch average is tops among the
Cardinal's regular receivers. A lot
of his improvement, according to
Walters, is due mainly to experi
ence and his laid-back attitude.
"I think as the games went on, I
gained more confidence," he said.
"I know what to expect out of the
defense, and all the pressure
doesn't get to me. I'm just relaxed
and going out and having fun."
His teammates have taken no
tice of his rising confidence level as
well. "He brings an air of confi
dence with him," Hutchinson said.
"We have some plays that are di
rected for him, and everybody has
confidence that he is going to make
a great play because he has that
kind of ability."
Walters has also shown im
provement within the Cardinal's
punt-return game, which he took
over halfway through the second
game of the season when Anthony
Bookman went down with a sepa
rated shoulder.
Since then, Walters has fielded
20 punts for 239 yards, an average
of 11.9 yards per return. His best
return of the season came last Sat
urday, when Walters electrified
the crowd with a 75-yard juant for
a touchdown. The touchdown
came with just 22 seconds left in
the first half and tied the game
with Washington State at 14-14.
"We've always known that we
have big playmakers on special
teams," Walters said, whose touch
down return on Saturday was the
Cardinal's first since Glyn Mil
burn's 76-yard return in the 1992
Big Game. "We wanted to show the
world and show everybody in the
stands that we can make plays, and
we did."
In spite of his success in past
weeks, Walters remains unusually
humble. "I just thank my team
mates and my coaches for having
confidence in me," he said. "I just
go out and have fun — that's the

key, going out, having fun and
doing what I've got to do."
In approaching the biggest game
of his young career — today's Big
Game — Walters will once again be
called on to make the big plays. And

despite the importance of the game
and the burden that has been
placed on his shoulders, Walters re
mains calm and confident.
"I am going to try to keep it like
any other game. It's going to be

tough, but that's what you have to
do," he said. "It's just the next
game, so that's why it's a big game.
"If we just go out and execute
and play our game, then we'll be all
right."
