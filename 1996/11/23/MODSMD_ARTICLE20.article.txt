## Big Game history full of bizarre finishes 
### Bobby Cuza Staff writer 
They are the ghosts of Big Game
past. Leading men in the dramas
that have played themselves out on
the stage of one of college football's
greatest rivalries. Their names are
the stuff of legend.
Names like Mike Langford,
place-kicker. John Belli, defensive
lineman. Gary Tyrell, trombonist.
Trombonist?
That's right, folks, you read cor
rectly. Trombonist Gary Tyrell.
You see, at first glance the annual
Cal-Stanford showdown looks
much like any other traditional col
lege football rivalry. But just be
neath the surface of Big Game
there lurks something more, some
ethereal force, some cosmic power
threatening to transform every
contest into a theater of the ab
surd, to hurl each game into a sea
of complete and utter chaos.
OK, OK, so maybe we're exag
gerating a little bit. But the fact is
that in its 104-year history, four
Big Games have been won or lost
on the game's final play, producing
some of the wildest, wackiest fin
ishes in the history of college foot
ball and casting the spotlight on
some unlikely characters.
Here's a look at those four epic
battles:
Miracle in the Mud
1972: Cal 24, Stanford 21
In a mud bath at Cal's Memori
al Stadium, things looked bleak
early on for the Golden Bears.
Freshman quarterback Vince Fer
ragamo was intercepted four times
in the first half — one of them a 71-
vard return for a touchdown by
Stanford's Gordy Riegel — as the
Cardinal raced out a 14-3 lead at
the break.
But Ferragamo hung tough.
Down 21-18 late in the game, the
future Los Angeles Rams signal
caller drove his team to Stanford's
6-yard line. But the drive stalled
there, and three plays later the
Bears were looking at fourth-and
goal with just seconds remaining.
Rather than opt for a sure field
goal and the tie, coach Mike White
decided to roll the dice and go for
the touchdown and the win. White
inserted wide receiver Steve Swee
ny at tight end, and when Stanford
defensive back Jim Ferguson
slipped and fell in the muck, Fer
ragamo found Sweeny wide open in
the corner of the end zone. Sweeny

made a diving grab as time expired
and Cal fans poured onto the field
in celebration.
A Kick for the Ages
1974: Stanford 22, Cal 20
Stanford entered the final quar
ter of play ahead 19-10, but a
touchdown pass from Steve
Bartkowski to Steve Rivera gave
Cal a 20-19 lead with 26 seconds re
maining. Berkeley fans swarmed
the field in celebration of the
Bears' apparent victory. But order
was eventually restored, and Cal
kicked off, pinning the Cardinal on
its own 19-yard line.
That's where the drama began.
Backup quarterback Guy Ben
jamin completed two long passes to
set up a 50-yard field goal attempt
for place-kicker Langford, who had
already converted on two previous
attempts.
"I had never felt that before," he
said after the game. "I just kept
saying, 'Oh my God, here I am.' "
With 3 seconds remaining,
Langford steered his kick through
the uprights, giving the Cardinal
an improbable 22-20 win.
The Play
1982: Cal 25, Stanford 20
With his team down 19-17 and
time running out, Stanford quar
terback John Elway engineered an
electrifying last-minute drive that
culminated in a 35-yard field goal
by Mark Harmon, giving the Cardi
nal a 20-19 lead. Stanford fans
spilled from the Memorial Stadium
stands and mobbed the team.
But 4 seconds remained on the
clock. After a 15-yard unsports
manlike conduct penalty was as
sessed for excessive celebration,
Stanford kicked off from its own
25. The rest, as they say, is history.
It is a sequence of events known
forevermore in sports lore simply
as "The Play":
Cal's Kevin Moen fielded Har
mon's squib kick at the 43 and im
mediately pitched it to Richard
Rodgers, who gave it to Dwight
Garner, who was then buried by
Cardinal tacklers. Stanford fans,
coaches and players thought the
play was dead and the game over.
Players began edging onto the field
and the Stanford Band moved into
the end zone to begin its victorious
post-game show.
But the ball had not been ruled
dead. Rodgers had somehow gotten
the ball back from Garner and was
streaking downfield. Stanford de
fenders caught up to him, but not

before he'd passed it off to Marion
Ford, who took it to the 20 before
throwing the ball blindly over his
head and into the awaiting arms of
Moen, who proceeded across the
goal line unheeded.
Unheeded, that is, except for
trombone player Gary Tyrell, who
was bowled over by Moen in the

end zone and thrust into blooper
film immortality.
"Please clear the field. The
game is not over."
1990: Stanford 27, Cal 25
Eight years later, the Cardinal
got its revenge.
Down 25-17 late in the fourth
quarter, Stanford quarterback
Jason Palumbis moved the offense
87 yards, hitting Ed McCaffrey in
the corner of the end zone on a
beautifully thrown timing pattern
to pull the Cardinal within one.
Coach Denny Green opted for
the two-point conversion, but
Palumbis' pass was poicked off by
John Hardy, sending thousands of
Cal fans streaming onto the field in
celebration (are we beginning to see
a pattern here?). But with 12 sec
onds remaining on the game clock,
the celebration was premature.
After officials had cleared the

field and assessed a 15-yard penal
ty for delay of game, John Hopkins
executed a perfect onside kick. The
ball skittered in and out of the
arms of Cal running back Russell
White, and Stanford's Kevin Scott
recovered at the Cal 37 with 9 sec
onds to go.
Palumbis' first pass fell incom
plete, leaving Stanford with an
all-but-impossible 54-yard field
goal. But Cal nose guard John
Belli was flagged for roughing the
passer, and suddenly the Cardinal
found itself perched on the 22-
yard line.
Hopkins came on to attempt the
game-winning field goal. With Cal
fans sitting in stunned silence,
Hopkins calmly drilled the 39-
yarder as time expired, sending
Stanford fans — where else? —
onto the field and John Belli into
Big Game infamy.

made a diving grab as time expired
and Cal fans poured onto the field
in celebration.
A Kick for the Ages
1974: Stanford 22, Cal 20
Stanford entered the final quar
ter of play ahead 19-10, but a
touchdown pass from Steve
Bartkowski to Steve Rivera gave
Cal a 20-19 lead with 26 seconds re
maining. Berkeley fans swarmed
the field in celebration of the
Bears' apparent victory. But order
was eventually restored, and Cal
kicked off, pinning the Cardinal on
its own 19-yard line.
That's where the drama began.
Backup quarterback Guy Ben
jamin completed two long passes to
set up a 50-yard field goal attempt
for place-kicker Langford, who had
already converted on two previous
attempts.
"I had never felt that before," he
said after the game. "I just kept
saying, 'Oh my God, here I am.' "
With 3 seconds remaining,
Langford steered his kick through
the uprights, giving the Cardinal
an improbable 22-20 win.
The Play
1982: Cal 25, Stanford 20
With his team down 19-17 and
time running out, Stanford quar
terback John Elway engineered an
electrifying last-minute drive that
culminated in a 35-yard field goal
by Mark Harmon, giving the Cardi
nal a 20-19 lead. Stanford fans
spilled from the Memorial Stadium
stands and mobbed the team.
But 4 seconds remained on the
clock. After a 15-yard unsports
manlike conduct penalty was as
sessed for excessive celebration,
Stanford kicked off from its own
25. The rest, as they say, is history.
It is a sequence of events known
forevermore in sports lore simply
as "The Play":
Cal's Kevin Moen fielded Har
mon's squib kick at the 43 and im
mediately pitched it to Richard
Rodgers, who gave it to Dwight
Garner, who was then buried by
Cardinal tacklers. Stanford fans,
coaches and players thought the
play was dead and the game over.
Players began edging onto the field
and the Stanford Band moved into
the end zone to begin its victorious
post-game show.
But the ball had not been ruled
dead. Rodgers had somehow gotten
the ball back from Garner and was
streaking downfield. Stanford de
fenders caught up to him, but not

before he'd passed it off to Marion
Ford, who took it to the 20 before
throwing the ball blindly over his
head and into the awaiting arms of
Moen, who proceeded across the
goal line unheeded.
Unheeded, that is, except for
trombone player Gary Tyrell, who
was bowled over by Moen in the

end zone and thrust into blooper
film immortality.
"Please clear the field. The
game is not over."
1990: Stanford 27, Cal 25
Eight years later, the Cardinal
got its revenge.
Down 25-17 late in the fourth
quarter, Stanford quarterback
Jason Palumbis moved the offense
87 yards, hitting Ed McCaffrey in
the corner of the end zone on a
beautifully thrown timing pattern
to pull the Cardinal within one.
Coach Denny Green opted for
the two-point conversion, but
Palumbis' pass was poicked off by
John Hardy, sending thousands of
Cal fans streaming onto the field in
celebration (are we beginning to see
a pattern here?). But with 12 sec
onds remaining on the game clock,
the celebration was premature.
After officials had cleared the

field and assessed a 15-yard penal
ty for delay of game, John Hopkins
executed a perfect onside kick. The
ball skittered in and out of the
arms of Cal running back Russell
White, and Stanford's Kevin Scott
recovered at the Cal 37 with 9 sec
onds to go.
Palumbis' first pass fell incom
plete, leaving Stanford with an
all-but-impossible 54-yard field
goal. But Cal nose guard John
Belli was flagged for roughing the
passer, and suddenly the Cardinal
found itself perched on the 22-
yard line.
Hopkins came on to attempt the
game-winning field goal. With Cal
fans sitting in stunned silence,
Hopkins calmly drilled the 39-
yarder as time expired, sending
Stanford fans — where else? —
onto the field and John Belli into
Big Game infamy.

Senior wide receiver Ed McCaffrey hauls in a touchdown pass with 12 seconds left in the 1990 Big Game,

game and win 27-25.
They are the ghosts of Big Game
past. Leading men in the dramas
that have played themselves out on
the stage of one of college football's
greatest rivalries. Their names are
the stuff of legend.
Names like Mike Langford,
place-kicker. John Belli, defensive
lineman. Gary Tyrell, trombonist.
Trombonist?
That's right, folks, you read cor
rectly. Trombonist Gary Tyrell.
You see, at first glance the annual
Cal-Stanford showdown looks
much like any other traditional col
lege football rivalry. But just be
neath the surface of Big Game
there lurks something more, some
ethereal force, some cosmic power
threatening to transform every
contest into a theater of the ab
surd, to hurl each game into a sea
of complete and utter chaos.
OK, OK, so maybe we're exag
gerating a little bit. But the fact is
that in its 104-year history, four
Big Games have been won or lost
on the game's final play, producing
some of the wildest, wackiest fin
ishes in the history of college foot
ball and casting the spotlight on
some unlikely characters.
Here's a look at those four epic
battles:
Miracle in the Mud
1972: Cal 24, Stanford 21
In a mud bath at Cal's Memori
al Stadium, things looked bleak
early on for the Golden Bears.
Freshman quarterback Vince Fer
ragamo was intercepted four times
in the first half — one of them a 71-
vard return for a touchdown by
Stanford's Gordy Riegel — as the
Cardinal raced out a 14-3 lead at
the break.
But Ferragamo hung tough.
Down 21-18 late in the game, the
future Los Angeles Rams signal
caller drove his team to Stanford's
6-yard line. But the drive stalled
there, and three plays later the
Bears were looking at fourth-and
goal with just seconds remaining.
Rather than opt for a sure field
goal and the tie, coach Mike White
decided to roll the dice and go for
the touchdown and the win. White
inserted wide receiver Steve Swee
ny at tight end, and when Stanford
defensive back Jim Ferguson
slipped and fell in the muck, Fer
ragamo found Sweeny wide open in
the corner of the end zone. Sweeny

made a diving grab as time expired
and Cal fans poured onto the field
in celebration.
