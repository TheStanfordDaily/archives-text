## Cal stumbles toward a possible bowl berth 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
It doesn't get much bigger.
On Saturday afternoon in Berke
ley, the oldest rivals on the West
Coast collide in the 99th Big Game
with bowl hopes on the line for both
the Stanford Cardinal and the Cali
fornia Golden Bears.
"I don't know how it gets any
more special," California head coach
Steve Mariucci said. "The Big Game
is it, whether it's for pride, the Rose
Bowl or the Sun Bowl."
For the Card (5-5 overall, 4-3 Pa
cific 10 Conference), the scenario is
simple. Beat Cal and Stanford earns
a berth to the Sun Bowl in El Paso. A
loss, however, gives the Cardinal a
sub-.500 overall record and disquali
fies Stanford from receiving any
bowl bid.
"It's clear for us what we have to
do," Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingham said.
On the other hand, Cal (6-4, 3-4)
has the luxury of a better overall
record. Even with a loss, the Bears
remain eligible for an Aloha Bowl
bid, which goes to a fourth Pac-10
team, but not necessarily the fourth
place squad.
"It's a big game for us, and it's a
big game for them," senior running
back Mike Mitchell said. "Our fans
are going to be out there, their fans
aire going to be out there. It's so
much fun when you can hear the ex
citement right there on top of you."
The battle for the Axe features
two teams seemingly headed in op
posite directions to close the season.
Stanford, after getting off to a dismal
2-5 start, has won three consecutive
conference games for the first time
since closing out the 1992 campaign
with four wins. The Bears, on the
other hand, have dropped four of
their last five contests after starting
the season with five straight wins.
The Cardinal turnaround has
been most evident on offense. After
averaging just 12.7 points a game for
the first seven games of the season,
Stanford has put up 26 points a
game in its last three wins against
UCLA, USC and Washington State.
Stanford is "very efficient,"
Mariucci said. "They are running
the ball, they are making plays and
their quarterback has been
steady."
Last week against Washington
State, the Cardinal's 33 points
marked a season high, eclipsing the
27-point performance in an October
overtime win over Oregon.
Yet the improvement in point
production is not solely the result of
the offense. Special teams have con
tributed two touchdowns in as many

weeks on a Damon Dunn kickoff re
turn against USC and a Troy Wal
ters punt return against the
Cougars.
The Cardinal defense has also
helped add to the Stanford resur
gence. Stingy all season long, the de
fense has picked it up a notch to help
out the offense by forcing nine
turnovers in the last three games.
"When you look at them right
now, it's a team effort," Mariucci
said. "It's not one area where they
are having success, it's a team
thing."
Free safety Tim Smith put the
Cardinal on the Cougar 1 last week
after an interception and return. Ju
nior inside linebacker Jon Haskins
put points on the board himself by
sacking quarterback Ryan Leaf in
his own endzone for a safety.
Despite the statistical improve
ment, Willingham attributes the
turnaround to attitude.
"Most importantly, what I am
pleased with is the character and the
quality of the young men we work
with," Willingham said. "There are
ups and downs in every team's sea
son. You just have to be prepared to
weather the storm."
Even after an embarrassing loss
to Oregon State and a thrashing by
Arizona State, the Cardinal did not
throw in the towel.
"We really did believe that we had
a good team," Mitchell said. "We be
lieved that since training camp start
ed. We knew that somewhere in our
team we had a winner."
For the Golden Bears, the rea
sons behind the slip from the top of
the Pac-10 standings to a five-way
tie for fourth place are equally as ev
ident. The Golden Bear defense has
been unable to keep opponents out
of the end zone, allowing 42 points
per game in its last four contests.
Offensively, in its six wins Cal
gained an average of 193.8 yards per
game on the ground and allowed just
eight sacks. Comparatively, the
Bears have rushed for just 62 yards
per game in their losses and have al
lowed 27 sacks.
The failure of the Cal running at
tack is due in large part to major in
juries. Running back Tarik Smith,
the Pac-10's best rusher early on,
went down with a season-ending
knee injury in game three. The Cal
offensive line has also experienced
considerable wear and tear. Cal,
which had only two of its starting
linemen available last week against
Oregon, has been unable to start the
same offensive line in consecutive
weeks since game two.
A debilitated line has not impeded
the productivity of Cal's senior quar
terback Pat Barnes, however.

Barnes currently ranks first in the
Pac-10 and third in the nation in
total offense at 313.1 yards per
game. Barnes, who also leads the
Pac-10 in passing efficiency, owns a
28-6 touchdown-to-interception
ratio and has not thrown an inter
ception in 145 pass attempts.
"We'd like to think we have a very
productive offense," Mariucci said.
"But they have a very good defense
too. They mix their defenses up, give
you a variety of coverages, and they
are getting better as the year pro
gresses."
As a result of his success, the
Bears' offense has become depen
dent on Barnes and the passing
game. In the first five games of the
season, Cal got 43.1 percent of its of
fense from the ground game. In the
Bears' last five, Barnes has produced
more than 82 percent of it.
While the Cardinal defense has
had success forcing turnovers, the
Bears have had significant problems
holding on to the ball. Two fumbles
in particular weigh heavily on the

minds of Mariucci and the Bears.
Five weeks ago, a Barnes fumble at
the Cougar 2-yard line cost Cal a con
ference win at Washington State.
The Bears fumbled again at the goal
line last week against Oregon on a
crucial drive that would have kept
the Bears within striking distance.
"We have got too much going for
us to think about being in the tank,"
Marriucci said. "We have got to have
short memories and forget about
what's happened and look at what
can be. A 7-4 season would be awe
some for this young team. To have
an opportunity to go to a bowl, to win
a bowl and to finish 8-4 would be
spectacular for this young bunch."
Ironically enough, it was a costly
fumble which provided the Cardinal
with an opportunity to retrieve the
Axe last season at Stanford Stadium.
Trailing by six in the fourth quarter,
Cal's bid to take the lead was thwart
ed by a Tony Gonzalez fumble on the
Bear 29-yard line. Four plays later
the Cardinal extended its lead to 12
on a seven-yard touchdown pass to

departed senior Mark Harris.
The Cardinal victory was earned
on the ground where Stanford col
lected 246 rushing yards. Mitchell
led the charge with a 138-yard per
formance and Anthony Bookman
chipped in with 95 yards of his own.
Stanford will undoubtedly be
looking to establish its running
game this year as well.
"That's one of our priorities every
game, tiying to get our running
game established," Mitchell said.
"That helps take pressure of our
pass game."
The Cardinal leads the overall se
ries with the Golden Bears 48-39-11
and have taken five of the last seven
meetings. But all that is thrown out
for this week, because Saturday is
the Big One.
"Our focus is clearly on the 99th
Big Game," Willingham said. "It
could give us an opportunity to play
in a 12th game and give our men an
opportunity to travel. We hope to be
ready to play our best game of the
year."

Curtis Chen — Daily file
Cal senior quarterback Pat Barnes (throwing ball) hopes to see less pressure than he did in last year's Big
Game. Pressuring him (from left to right) are then-junior inside linebacker Chris Draft, then-senior inside
linebacker Mike Hall, then-junior cornerback Alistair White and then-junior outside linebacker Brian Batson.
