# 25 years later, the memories remain sweet...
## Stanford's last Rose Bowl team looks back 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
It is hard to believe that the last
time Stanford played in the Rose
Bowl, 25 years ago, the vast majori
ty of Stanford students were not
even alive yet. However, for those
football fans around for the Rose
Bowl on New Year's Day 1972, the
memories are still very vivid.
"To win, especially the way they
won, was pretty incredible," said
Bob Murphy, currently a radio an
nouncer for Stanford football. He
was the University's sports infor
mation director in 1972.
Coming into the 1971 season,
Stanford was flying sky high. After
the 1970 campaign, Stanford had
played in the Rose Bowl for the first
time in 19 years, beating undefeated
Ohio State 27-17. However, many
pointed to Jim Plunkett, the only
Heisman Trophy winner to ever
come out of Stanford, as the only
reason for their success.
"They were treated very unfairly
[in 1971]," Murphy said. "People
were saying they beat Ohio State be
cause of only one guy."
As Plunkett went on to the Na
tional Football lieague, the Indians
(as Stanford was then called) were
left to answer their critics.
And answer they did.
The season
Left to answer the critics was
Plunkett's replacement, senior
quarterback Don Bunce. Stanford's
goal, which many thought unattain
able, was to return to the Rose Bowl.
Behind Bunce and the famed Thun
der Chickens defense, they accom
plished their goal easily, going 8-3
heading into the game.
"If you start to think about it, we
did not set our goal on being a na
tional champion," said then-head
coach John Ralston. "If we had, we'd
have handled those three games."
The Indians started the 1971 sea
son in fme form, shutting out Mis
souri 19-0. After they breezed
through their next two games, Stan
ford would meet Duke in an embar
rassing loss that still gets head coach
John Ralston upset 25 years after
the fact.
"Duke of all places!" said Ralston,
the current San Jose State coach
who will coach his final game today
against UNLV. "We should have
beaten Duke blindfolded. For some
unknown reason, we'd lose games
we should have won easily."
Stanford would go through the
season following this pattern. While
their only Pacific 8 Conference loss
(the Arizona schools joined the
league in 1977) the entire season
came against Washington State in a
24-23 contest, the Indians lost to
San Jose State by a score of 13-12 in
the week before Big Game. By this
time, Stanford had apparently
wrapped up the Rose Bowl berth,
and they may have been looking
ahead.
In every way, the San Jose State
game was an embarrassment. Kick
er Rod Garcia missed an extra point
and five field goals, including a 20-
yard attempt to win the game. Com
ing into the game, Garcia led the na

tion in field goals, making 14 of 22
attempts.
Thus, going into Big Game, Stan
ford's confidence was not at its high
est point. In addition to the San Jose
State loss, Stanford also remem
bered the surprising 22-14 loss to
Cal the year before. Finally, to make
things more complicated, the Indi
ans learned that their Rose Bowl
berth may not have been wrapped
up after all.
A suit was filed just days before
the Big Game that gave California
hopes of entering the Rose Bowl pic
ture. Before the season, the NCAA
suspended two Cal players for not
meeting academic standards. Cal de
cided to play them anyway, and as
punishment, the Pac-8 made all of
Cal's games against conference op
ponents count as non-league games.
Going into Big Game, Stanford
was 5-1 in the conference, and Cal
was 4-2 against Pac-8 opponents. A
win by Cal and a successful suit
could have sent Cal to Pasadena.
But the Thunder Chickens had
something to say about that.
Stanford erased Cal's hopes by
shutting the Bears out 14-0. The In
dian defense held the Bears to only
61 yards of total offense before the
last 2 minutes of the game.
The Rose Bowl goal was attained.
Stanford's opponent: Michigan,
which came into the game 11-0.
The game
Stanford went into its second
straight Rose Bowl feeling good
about itself. However, not many
other people felt good about the In
dians. They were listed as a huge un
derdogtothe 1971 Wolverines team,
which many were calling the great
est Michigan squad of all time. This
did not faze Stanford, according to
Murphy.
"We were veterans," he said. "We
weren't awed by anybody. We knew
we could throw the ball better than
they could, and we could defend bet
ter than they could throw. The Big
Ten was not a passing conference."
Ralston also noted that the team
was not intimidated. "We had
played and won the Pac-8. If you're
the Pac-8 champ, by gosh, you're a
pretty good football team."
The first half showed observers
that this would not be a Rose Bowl
blowout. For the second straight
year, Stanford was holding tough
with an opponent many felt they
had no chance against. Michigan led
at the half 3-0, but the Thunder
Chickens had only given up 133
yards in total offense.
In the third quarter, Stanford
tied the game on a 42-yard field goal
by Garcia, and the game stayed tied
until the fourth quarter â€” which be
came one of the most memorable
quarters in Rose Bowl history.
The Wolverines drew first blood,
scoring a touchdown to make it 10-3.
About halfway through the final
frame, Stanford found itself in seri
ous trouble, as the Indians had the
ball on their own 38-yard line, facing
fourth down and lining up to punt.
The Michigan defenders smelled
a fake right away, expecting a pass
on the play. Well, the Wolverines
were half right. Jackie Brown ran

24-23 contest, the Indians lost to
San Jose State by a score of 13-12 in
the week before Big Game. By this
time, Stanford had apparently
wrapped up the Rose Bowl berth,
and they may have been looking
ahead.
In every way, the San Jose State
game was an embarrassment. Kick
er Rod Garcia missed an extra point
and five field goals, including a 20-
yard attempt to win the game. Com
ing into the game, Garcia led the na

tion in field goals, making 14 of 22
attempts.
Thus, going into Big Game, Stan
ford's confidence was not at its high
est point. In addition to the San Jose
State loss, Stanford also remem
bered the surprising 22-14 loss to
Cal the year before. Finally, to make
things more complicated, the Indi
ans learned that their Rose Bowl
berth may not have been wrapped
up after all.
A suit was filed just days before
the Big Game that gave California
hopes of entering the Rose Bowl pic
ture. Before the season, the NCAA
suspended two Cal players for not
meeting academic standards. Cal de
cided to play them anyway, and as
punishment, the Pac-8 made all of
Cal's games against conference op
ponents count as non-league games.
Going into Big Game, Stanford
was 5-1 in the conference, and Cal
was 4-2 against Pac-8 opponents. A
win by Cal and a successful suit
could have sent Cal to Pasadena.
But the Thunder Chickens had
something to say about that.
Stanford erased Cal's hopes by
shutting the Bears out 14-0. The In
dian defense held the Bears to only
61 yards of total offense before the
last 2 minutes of the game.
The Rose Bowl goal was attained.
Stanford's opponent: Michigan,
which came into the game 11-0.
The game
Stanford went into its second
straight Rose Bowl feeling good
about itself. However, not many
other people felt good about the In
dians. They were listed as a huge un
derdogtothe 1971 Wolverines team,
which many were calling the great
est Michigan squad of all time. This
did not faze Stanford, according to
Murphy.
"We were veterans," he said. "We
weren't awed by anybody. We knew
we could throw the ball better than
they could, and we could defend bet
ter than they could throw. The Big
Ten was not a passing conference."
Ralston also noted that the team
was not intimidated. "We had
played and won the Pac-8. If you're
the Pac-8 champ, by gosh, you're a
pretty good football team."
The first half showed observers
that this would not be a Rose Bowl
blowout. For the second straight
year, Stanford was holding tough
with an opponent many felt they
had no chance against. Michigan led
at the half 3-0, but the Thunder
Chickens had only given up 133
yards in total offense.
In the third quarter, Stanford
tied the game on a 42-yard field goal
by Garcia, and the game stayed tied
until the fourth quarter â€” which be
came one of the most memorable
quarters in Rose Bowl history.
The Wolverines drew first blood,
scoring a touchdown to make it 10-3.
About halfway through the final
frame, Stanford found itself in seri
ous trouble, as the Indians had the
ball on their own 38-yard line, facing
fourth down and lining up to punt.
The Michigan defenders smelled
a fake right away, expecting a pass
on the play. Well, the Wolverines
were half right. Jackie Brown ran

It is hard to believe that the last
time Stanford played in the Rose
Bowl, 25 years ago, the vast majori
ty of Stanford students were not
even alive yet. However, for those
football fans around for the Rose
Bowl on New Year's Day 1972, the
memories are still very vivid.
"To win, especially the way they
won, was pretty incredible," said
Bob Murphy, currently a radio an
nouncer for Stanford football. He
was the University's sports infor
mation director in 1972.
Coming into the 1971 season,
Stanford was flying sky high. After
the 1970 campaign, Stanford had
played in the Rose Bowl for the first
time in 19 years, beating undefeated
Ohio State 27-17. However, many
pointed to Jim Plunkett, the only
Heisman Trophy winner to ever
come out of Stanford, as the only
reason for their success.
"They were treated very unfairly
[in 1971]," Murphy said. "People
were saying they beat Ohio State be
cause of only one guy."
As Plunkett went on to the Na
tional Football lieague, the Indians
(as Stanford was then called) were
left to answer their critics.
And answer they did.
The season
Left to answer the critics was
Plunkett's replacement, senior
quarterback Don Bunce. Stanford's
goal, which many thought unattain
able, was to return to the Rose Bowl.
Behind Bunce and the famed Thun
der Chickens defense, they accom
plished their goal easily, going 8-3
heading into the game.
"If you start to think about it, we
did not set our goal on being a na
tional champion," said then-head
coach John Ralston. "If we had, we'd
have handled those three games."
The Indians started the 1971 sea
son in fme form, shutting out Mis
souri 19-0. After they breezed
through their next two games, Stan
ford would meet Duke in an embar
rassing loss that still gets head coach
John Ralston upset 25 years after
the fact.
"Duke of all places!" said Ralston,
the current San Jose State coach
who will coach his final game today
against UNLV. "We should have
beaten Duke blindfolded. For some
unknown reason, we'd lose games
we should have won easily."
Stanford would go through the
season following this pattern. While
their only Pacific 8 Conference loss
(the Arizona schools joined the
league in 1977) the entire season
came against Washington State in a
24-23 contest, the Indians lost to
San Jose State by a score of 13-12 in
the week before Big Game. By this
time, Stanford had apparently
wrapped up the Rose Bowl berth,
and they may have been looking
