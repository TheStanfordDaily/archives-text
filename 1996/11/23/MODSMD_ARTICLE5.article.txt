# Stanford Stops Wolverines, 13-12

the ball 31 yards for a first down.
Five plays later, Brown did it again,
scoring on a 24-yard run to tie the
score with 6:29 left.
Michigan would retake the lead
several minutes later. Wolverine
place-kicker Dan Coin attempted
and missed a 46-yard field goal, but
Stanford's James Ferguson inex
plicably attempted to run the ball
back. However, he was tacked in the
end zone by Michigan's Ed Shut
tlesworth, and a Big Ten official
called it a safety.
This play became one of the most
controversial in Rose Bowl history,
as Ferguson was never allowed to
take the ball out of the end zone.
The media and the crowd, as well as
many Stanford players and coaches,
were sure that Stanford was going
to lose the game on that call.
However, with the ball on its
own 35 and only 3:13 to run off the
clock, Michigan could not get a first
down, and Stanford was given one
last desperate chance with 1:48 to
go. Bunce had the ball, and it was
time to work some magic.
"Bunce started completing all
these passes," Murphy said. "He
just completed one pass after anoth
er.
"I walked toward the Stanford
bench. Ralston (John's son),
who could not have been more than
9 or 10 at the time, came runningup
to me, and said 'Murph, I think we
can do it!'
"I walked clear to the other end
of the field with him. They stopped
the clock after a first down, and we
walked to the [Michigan] end zone.
I put my arm around Larry and we
stood behind the goal post."
By this time, only 12 seconds
were left, and Bunce's passing — he
was five of six on the final drive —
had gotten the Indians down to the
Michigan 14. Garcia came in to try
and win the game for Stanford.
"In comes [Gary] Murray to hold
and Rod Garcia to kick," Murphy
said. "He was amazing. He kicked

the ball right over our heads —
right over our heads."
Ralston said the field goal could
not have been more perfect.
"If you could split the uprights
perfectly — right dead center —
Garcia did it,"he said. "He kicked it
not good; he kicked it perfectly."
Stanford kicked off to the
Wolverines, but the Thunder
Chickens stopped them yet again.
Stanford 13, Michigan 12.
The past and the future
The 1972 Rose Bowl would be
the last game that Ralston would
coach for Stanford. Days after the
win, he announced that he was
moving onto the Denver Broncos.
Ralston would return to colle
giate coaching in 1993 at San Jose
State. He returned, in part, due to
the loss of his son Larry, who died of
AIDS. Saturday's game against
UNLV will mark Ralston's last, as
he is retiring.
"Really and truly, if you took the
46 entire years (of my career), the
two Rose Bowls would be the possi
ble highlights," Ralston said.
Bunce is still in the area, too.
After his MVP performance in the
Rose Bowl, he moved on to profes
sional football for a year, only to
enter medical school here at Stan
ford. Today, he is an orthopedic sur
geon and a Stanford team doctor.
Ever since the Stanford football
days of Ralston and Bunce 25 years
ago, Stanford fans have eagerly
awaited a return to the Roses.
Though they came close under Bill
Walsh in 1992, when the Cardinal
tied for the Pac-10 championship,
they had to settle for the Block
buster Bowl.
Ralston said that the wait for
Stanford fans should not be much
longer.
"Tyro" o Willingham will bring
Stanford to the Rose Bowl," Ral
ston said. "You can take that to the
bank."

right over our heads."
Ralston said the field goal could
not have been more perfect.
"If you could split the uprights
perfectly — right dead center —
Garcia did it,"he said. "He kicked it
not good; he kicked it perfectly."
Stanford kicked off to the
Wolverines, but the Thunder
Chickens stopped them yet again.
Stanford 13, Michigan 12.
The past and the future
The 1972 Rose Bowl would be
the last game that Ralston would
coach for Stanford. Days after the
win, he announced that he was
moving onto the Denver Broncos.
Ralston would return to colle
giate coaching in 1993 at San Jose
State. He returned, in part, due to
the loss of his son Larry, who died of
AIDS. Saturday's game against
UNLV will mark Ralston's last, as
he is retiring.
"Really and truly, if you took the
46 entire years (of my career), the
two Rose Bowls would be the possi
ble highlights," Ralston said.
Bunce is still in the area, too.
After his MVP performance in the
Rose Bowl, he moved on to profes
sional football for a year, only to
enter medical school here at Stan
ford. Today, he is an orthopedic sur
geon and a Stanford team doctor.
Ever since the Stanford football
days of Ralston and Bunce 25 years
ago, Stanford fans have eagerly
awaited a return to the Roses.
Though they came close under Bill
Walsh in 1992, when the Cardinal
tied for the Pac-10 championship,
they had to settle for the Block
buster Bowl.
Ralston said that the wait for
Stanford fans should not be much
longer.
"Tyro" o Willingham will bring
Stanford to the Rose Bowl," Ral
ston said. "You can take that to the
bank."

the ball 31 yards for a first down.
Five plays later, Brown did it again,
scoring on a 24-yard run to tie the
score with 6:29 left.
Michigan would retake the lead
several minutes later. Wolverine
place-kicker Dan Coin attempted
and missed a 46-yard field goal, but
Stanford's James Ferguson inex
plicably attempted to run the ball
back. However, he was tacked in the
end zone by Michigan's Ed Shut
tlesworth, and a Big Ten official
called it a safety.
This play became one of the most
controversial in Rose Bowl history,
as Ferguson was never allowed to
take the ball out of the end zone.
The media and the crowd, as well as
many Stanford players and coaches,
were sure that Stanford was going
to lose the game on that call.
However, with the ball on its
own 35 and only 3:13 to run off the
clock, Michigan could not get a first
down, and Stanford was given one
last desperate chance with 1:48 to
go. Bunce had the ball, and it was
time to work some magic.
"Bunce started completing all
these passes," Murphy said. "He
just completed one pass after anoth
er.
"I walked toward the Stanford
bench. Ralston (John's son),
who could not have been more than
9 or 10 at the time, came runningup
to me, and said 'Murph, I think we
can do it!'
"I walked clear to the other end
of the field with him. They stopped
the clock after a first down, and we
walked to the [Michigan] end zone.
I put my arm around Larry and we
stood behind the goal post."
By this time, only 12 seconds
were left, and Bunce's passing — he
was five of six on the final drive —
had gotten the Indians down to the
Michigan 14. Garcia came in to try
and win the game for Stanford.
"In comes [Gary] Murray to hold
and Rod Garcia to kick," Murphy
said. "He was amazing. He kicked

the ball right over our heads —
right over our heads."
Ralston said the field goal could
not have been more perfect.
"If you could split the uprights
perfectly — right dead center —
Garcia did it,"he said. "He kicked it
not good; he kicked it perfectly."
