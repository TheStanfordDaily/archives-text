# CARDINAL NOTES
## Stanford looks to roast the Weenies 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
It has been said all week. Bay
Area papers have screamed it in
their headlines and scribes are dig
ging up the last cliches that they can
find. Yes, the 99th Big Game is now
a huge game for both the Stanford
Cardinal and the California Golden
Bears. However, what seems to be
lost in the midst of all the hype is the
sheer improbability of this game
being for a bowl berth. Going into
November, Stanford was 2-5 and
reeling. Cal was 5-2. rookie head
coach Steve Mariucci was lauded for
a remarkable turnaround and
scribes were still discussing outside
Rose Bowl chances.
What a difference a month
makes.
The Cardinal has reeled off three
straight wins, and the Bears have
struggled, falling to 6-4. Now, both
teams need a win to assure them
selves of a bowl berth. Should Stan
ford win, it goes to the Sun Bowl re
gardless of what anyone else does in
the conference. If the Bears win,
they almost assure themselves of
some sort of postseason game. Toss
in the fact that it is Big Game, and
the contest should bring its share of
excitement.
MOVE OVER REGGIE, IT'S
MR. NOVEMBER: Stanford head
coach Tyrone Willingham for some
reason has seen nothing but success
in the month of November. During
his tenure as an assistant under
Dennis Green from 1989-1991, the
Cardinal went 8-1 in November, in
cluding perfect marks in 1990 and
1991. In his two years as head coach
on the Farm, the only blemish on his
November record is the bitter one
point loss to USC last season. Speak
ing of strong finshes, a win today
would make Willingham only the
third Stanford coach in history to
take his teams to bowl games in his
first two seasons. Bill Walsh was the
last to accomplish it when he took
Stanford to the Sun Bowl in 1977
and the Bluebonnet Bowl in 1978
while Tiny Thornhill actually took
Stanford (then the Indians) to three
straight Rose Bowl appearences
from 1934 to 1936.
NO OFFENSE BEING
TAKEN: Stanford's attack has
steadily grown as the season has

progressed. While the numbers are
not eye-popping, the Cardinal has
generated a better ground game
while limiting its mistakes, includ
ing sacks. Ever since the 11-sack
nightmare endured by quarterback
Chad Hutchinson against Oregon
State, the young offensive line has
allowed 12 sacks in the last four
games combined. Hutchinson has
been efficient, if not spectacular. He
has completed 57 of 89 passes in the
last three games, including three
scoring tosses. Mike Mitchell has
sprung the running game of late,
gaining a season-high 147 yards
against USC. Mitchell needs only 68
more yards to pass the great Ray
Handley and current 49er Tommy
Vardell into fourth place on Stan
ford's career rushing list.
CAN THE DEFENSE HOLD
ONE MORE TIME?: The Cardinal
defenders have done a great job in
second halves of their last two
games, allowing a solitary field goal
against Washington State. They
rank fourth in the conference in
total defense while allowing an aver
age of 20.8 points a game, also
fourth in the league. Kailee Wong
moved into a tie for second with Ari
zona State's Daryl Rodgers on the
sack list when he registered his 11th
sack of the season. Tim Smith
helped the cause as well, causing a
fumble and intercepting a pass on
successive Washington State pos
sessions that led to 10 Stanford
points and put the game out of
reach.
AT LEAST THEY'RE CON
SISTENT: At first glance, it would
seem that Cal has really improved
on the previous year's 3-8 disaster.
But a 5-0 start and a national rank
ing can really breathe life into expec
tations. Bear fans were subdued
into dreaming of Rose Bowls and
other New Year's Day festivities.
Now, they are just hoping to go any
where. A win would probably assure
them of a Sun Bowl berth, barring
what USC does against UCLA and
Notre Dame. If they lose, it looks
very grim for Steve Mariucci and
company. While the defense is soft
as cream cheese, the offense can
score in a hurry. Senior quarterback
Pat Barnes leads the conference in
touchdown passes with 28 while
passing for 3,215 yards. Cal also has
the leading receiver in the confer

ence in junior wideout Bobby Shaw,
who has 53 receptions for 816 yards
and eight scores. The one speed
bump that this well-oiled offensive
machine has hit is turnovers, name
ly fumbles. The team has lost a
league-leading 18 fumbles, includ
ing four last week against Oregon.
Strange Cal stat: Going into Big

Game, Cal has scored 323 points
while allowing 323 points. They av
erage 465.9 yards in total offense
and allowed — you guessed it —
465.9 opposing offensive yards.
AND FINALLY: Stanford leads
the all-time series 48-39 with 11 ties.
But a warning: This will be Stan
ford's first game at Cal since the

Bears returned to a grass surface at
Memorial Stadium. The last time
the Cardinal played a game in
Berkeley on a new surface was in
1982. Yes, the 'Band is out on the
field, five-lateral touchdown' mad
ness that was 1982. Memorial had
artificial stuff then. Will the grass bo
greener this time for the Cardinal?

ington State. Dunn leads the team with 433 receiving yards.
