Arizona State (10-0) at Arizona (5-5)
3:30 p.m. PST
The Sun Devils are simply looking to cul
minate a magical season and stay alive in the
national championship chase with this battle
in the desert. Dick Tomey's squad ruined
UCLA's season with a resounding 35-17 win
last week in Tucson. The Wildcats are 5-0 at
home, although that streak will probably end
today. With an undefeated season on the line
along with avenging a 31-28 loss in Tempe,
the Sun Devils should have enough motiva
tion to trounce the Wildcats.
Washington (8-2) at Washington State (5-5)
3:30 p.m.
The Apple Cup pits two teams going in dif
ferent directions. Since getting destroyed in
South Bend 54-20 on Oct. 12, the Huskies
have not lost, outscoring their opponents
190-58 in the process and all but securing a
Holiday Bowl berth. Meanwhile, the Cougars
are on their annual November slide, dropping
three straight games and showing absolutely
no heart while coughing an almost sure bowl
bid.

use (5-5) at UCLA (4-6) 12:30 p.m.
The battle of Los Angeles is yet another
dud picked up by ABC. Apparently, they enjoy
Bob Toledo's beaming mug on television. He
was downright sour after the beating admin
istered to his team in the second half of a 35-
17 loss to Arizona. Now, he hopes to lead the
Bruins to a sixth straight win against the Tro
jans. With the exception of a last-second
Todd Marinovich to Chad Morton touchdown
pass in 1990, USC does not had a victory
against UCLA since 1988. The USC Mafia
must be getting impatient with Jolly John
Robinson. 0-for-UCLA does not spell favor
with the boosters.
Oregon (5-5) at Oregon State (2-8) 1 p.m.
Can the Ducks really be representing the
Pacific 10 Conference at the Aloha Bowl? It
could happen with a victory in this year's
100 th Civil War in Corvallis. Despite their 3-5
conference record, they would have the pre
requisite six wins and with all the mediocrity
that abounds in the league, they may well be
going. The Beavers are probably looking to
save Pettibone's job. Despite the resounding
67-28 victory over juggernaut Northern Illi
nois, they probably need a win to keep Petti
bone from mailing resumes this winter.
