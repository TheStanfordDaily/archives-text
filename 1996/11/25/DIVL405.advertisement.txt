Nancy K. Miller
The author will speak on the subject of her new book Bequest and Betrayal a
literary memoir on the death of a parent. By incorporating deeply felt memories of
her own parents' deaths, Miller gives weight to her examination of the relations
between parents and children, the crisis of aging bodies in decline, what it means to
write about someone else's suffering and how questions of class and religion help
shape the relationship between parent and child. This event is co-sponsored by the
Stanford English Department.
