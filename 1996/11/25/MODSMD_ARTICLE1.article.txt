# Big Game win brings out sunshine for the Card
## Stanford earns a Sun Bowl berth with win over Bears 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Just before kickoff in the 99th
installment of the Big Game, the
Stanford football team marched
through the crowd on its way to the
field. During the Big Game, the
Stanford football team marched all
over California 42-21.
With the win, Stanford (6-5, 5-
3) earned its second straight bowl
appearance under head coach Ty
rone Willingham by clinching third
place in the conference and a berth
to the Sun Bowl, a Dec. 31 game in
El Paso, Texas.
"A lot of the cheers you hear in
the locker room are a reaction to
that," Willingham said after the
game. "Our young men are quite
excited about this opportunity.
Most importantly, though, they are
excited about what they have done
and what they have accomplished.
Because to be at 2-5 at one point in
the season and coming back is a
tremendous accomplishment."
Despite its fifth loss in six
games, Cal (6-5,3-5) still earned an
invitation to play in the Aloha Bowl
in Hawaii.
The Cardinal offset 375 yards of
total offense by the Golden Bears
by forcing three turnovers, record
ing six sacks and accumulating
more than 400 yards on offense.
The victory marked the fourth
straight for the Cardinal, who com
pleted a sweep in the month of No
vember and a sweep over its Cali
fornia opponents.
After Cal pulled to within 34-21
early in the fourth, Stanford put

the game out of reach with 8 min
utes left, engineering an 11-play,
75-yard touchdown drive, capped
off by a senior running back Mike
Mitchell 3-yard touchdown recep
tion from sophomore quarterback
Chad Hutchinson. It was Mitchell
himself who sustained the drive
with a 24-yard run on third and
eight from the Cal 27.
"I think the real momentum
changer, the real key to the game
was when they went down and
scored, and we came back with a
score," Willingham said. "I
thought that really dictated the
outcome of the ball game because
they were poised and gaining mo
mentu m at that point, and we came
back and answered. That was a
sign of a football team that had its
mind made up about victory."
Stanford jumped out to a 17-0
lead early in the contest. On the
first series of the game, a hit by se
nior free safety Josh Madsen
jarred the ball from the hands of
Cal's fumble-prone freshman run
ning back, Deltha O'Neal. The re
covery by junior cornerback Alis
tair White gave the Cardinal the
ball on the Bears' 36-yard line.
Stanford failed to get in the end
zone but took a three-point lead on
a 24-yard field goal by junior Kevin
Miller.
Junior tackle Carl Hansen's
first of two sacks enabled the Stan
ford defense to go three-and-out on
the next possession, and the Cardi
nal offense answered with a nine
play, 81-yard drive which came
