# Big Game win brings out sunshine for the Card
## Stanford earns a Sun Bowl berth with win over Bears 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
Just before kickoff in the 99th
installment of the Big Game, the
Stanford football team marched
through the crowd on its way to the
field. During the Big Game, the
Stanford football team marched all
over California 42-21.
With the win, Stanford (6-5, 5-
3) earned its second straight bowl
appearance under head coach Ty
rone Willingham by clinching third
place in the conference and a berth
to the Sun Bowl, a Dec. 31 game in
El Paso, Texas.
"A lot of the cheers you hear in
the locker room are a reaction to
that," Willingham said after the
game. "Our young men are quite
excited about this opportunity.
Most importantly, though, they are
excited about what they have done
and what they have accomplished.
Because to be at 2-5 at one point in
the season and coming back is a
tremendous accomplishment."
Despite its fifth loss in six
games, Cal (6-5,3-5) still earned an
invitation to play in the Aloha Bowl
in Hawaii.
The Cardinal offset 375 yards of
total offense by the Golden Bears
by forcing three turnovers, record
ing six sacks and accumulating
more than 400 yards on offense.
The victory marked the fourth
straight for the Cardinal, who com
pleted a sweep in the month of No
vember and a sweep over its Cali
fornia opponents.
After Cal pulled to within 34-21
early in the fourth, Stanford put

the game out of reach with 8 min
utes left, engineering an 11-play,
75-yard touchdown drive, capped
off by a senior running back Mike
Mitchell 3-yard touchdown recep
tion from sophomore quarterback
Chad Hutchinson. It was Mitchell
himself who sustained the drive
with a 24-yard run on third and
eight from the Cal 27.
"I think the real momentum
changer, the real key to the game
was when they went down and
scored, and we came back with a
score," Willingham said. "I
thought that really dictated the
outcome of the ball game because
they were poised and gaining mo
mentu m at that point, and we came
back and answered. That was a
sign of a football team that had its
mind made up about victory."
Stanford jumped out to a 17-0
lead early in the contest. On the
first series of the game, a hit by se
nior free safety Josh Madsen
jarred the ball from the hands of
Cal's fumble-prone freshman run
ning back, Deltha O'Neal. The re
covery by junior cornerback Alis
tair White gave the Cardinal the
ball on the Bears' 36-yard line.
Stanford failed to get in the end
zone but took a three-point lead on
a 24-yard field goal by junior Kevin
Miller.
Junior tackle Carl Hansen's
first of two sacks enabled the Stan
ford defense to go three-and-out on
the next possession, and the Cardi
nal offense answered with a nine
play, 81-yard drive which came

mostly on the ground by Mitchell
and senior fullback Greg Cornelia.
Cornelia put the Cardinal inside the
Cal 10-yard line on a 33-yard run,
and Hutchinson threw the first of
his three touchdown passes on a 5-
yard, play-action pass to junior full
back Jon Ritchie.
"I think we had the momentum
the whole time, especially with scor
ing right away," Hutchinson said.
"We never looked back after that."
The Stanford defense got into the
scoring spree on the second play of
the second quarter. A Cardinal blitz
put Cal quarterback Pat Barnes
under heavy pressure, and Barnes'
pass was picked off by junior defen
sive end Kailee Wong. A former run
ning back, Wong returned the inter
ception 53 yards for a touchdown.
"We had a blitz on and because of
the formation, I knew I had to watch
for the screen," Wong said. Senior
strong safety "Eliel [Swinton] hit
Barnes, it came right to me, and I
took off."
The pick broke Barnes' streak of
151 consecutive pass attempts with
out an interception, a Pac-10 single
season record.
Barnes bounced right back, how
ever, and pulled Cal to within 10 by
completing four passes on a 75-yard
drive which culminated in a 17-yard
touchdown pass to junior tight end
Tony Gonzalez.
After stopping the Stanford
offense, the Bears had an opportuni
ty to salvage a bad first half with a
late second-quarter score. The Bears
drove downfield 47 yards before
being stopped on third and four at
the Stanford 44. Electing to go for it
on fourth down, Stanford got the
ball back with a little more than 2
minutes left in the half as Barnes
overthrew Gonzalez.
Two plays later, Hutchinson con
nected with redshirt freshman

flanker Troy Walters on an inside
screen. Walters took the pass and
cruised 56 yards untouched for a
Stanford score and a 24-7 lead.
"It was a great call by Coach,"
Hutchinson said. "He knew that
they have a tendency to blitz in that
situation, so he called the middle
screen and it went for a touchdown."
The Cardinal was not done for the
half, however. Barnes' next streak
without an interception ended at the
10 as sophomore free safety Tim
Smith picked off a Barnes pass just
out of Gonzalez's reach. A 37-yard
kick by Miller sent the game into
halftime with the Cardinal leading
27-7.
On the first drive of the second
half, Mitchell took the ball 24 yards
on the first play from scrimmage. A
Cal penalty set up a second-and
short situation, and the Cardinal
coaching staff called on junior wide
receiver Damon Dunn, who took an
end-around 37 yards for another
Cardinal touchdown.
"We were very fortunate that our
play-calling was very timely," Will
ingham said. "It also really helps
when your guys are making plays.
Good play calls are nothing if you
don't have players making plays.
They were executing, and that I
think was the difference."
Despite the 34-7 deficit, the Bears
did not break. A Barnes 20-yard
touchdown pass to wide receiver
Na'il Benjamin brought Cal to with
in 20. The Bear defense then blocked
a 44-yard field goal attempt by Miller
and held Stanford scoreless for the
remainder of the third.
Barnes took over in the beginning
of the fourth, completing four passes
on a Cal scoring drive that ended
with a touchdown pass to wide
receiver Bobby Shaw which pulled
the Bears to within 13 with more
than 12 minutes left in the game.
Barnes finished the game with 284
yards in the air on 21-of-32 passing.

"I think Pat Barnes is an excellent
quarterback," Willingham said. "We
were fortunate enough to have some
things in place to slow him down. At
times, he just made some fantastic
throws. That last touchdown was a
fantastic throw."
But Mitchell's touchdown catch
put the Card back up, and a two
point conversion from Hutchinson to
senior flanker Brian Manning
cemented the final score. Manning's
reception was the Cardinal's first
offensive two-point score of the sea
son.
It was the same old story for the
slumping Bears.
The first-possession fumble by
O'Neal was Cal's 16th fumble in the
last six games. In total, Cal's three
turnovers translated into 13 Stan
ford points.
The Bears offensive line also con
tinued to struggle, allowing six sacks
for a loss of 46 yards. Each of Stan
ford's front four — Hansen, Wong,
senior tackle Pete Swanson and
senior defensive end Bryan Werner
— recorded at least one sack on the
afternoon.
The Cardinal defense also forced
the Bears to rely too heavily on
Barnes, who totaled 284 yards in the
air, by limiting Cal to just 87 net
yards on the ground.
On the other side of the ball, the
Stanford offense enjoyed its best per
formance of the season. In addition
to tallying more than 200 yards
rushing, Hutchinson completed 16 of
his 25 passes for 184 yards and three
touchdowns. And for the first time
all season, the Cardinal did not turn
the ball over.
"Offensively, we felt like we were
going to score some points," Mitchell
said. "Every week we have been get
ting better. We knew we were com
ing together as a group, and there
were very few times today where
guys made mistakes."
Mitchell finished the game with

127 rushing yards on 24 carries, giv
ing him three 100-plus yard perfor
mances this season. As a team, the
Cardinal gained a season-high 220
net yards on the ground.
"That really helped," Hutchinson
said. "We knew then that in the
fourth quarter when we were up that
we could run the ball and run some
time off the clock."
So at just 2-5 through seven
games, the Cardinal could only qual
ify for a bowl by running the table
and winning its last four games in
the conference. The Cardinal did just
that in beating UCLA, USC, Wash
ington State and Cal in successive
weeks.
"It's very difficult to put in words
what these last few weeks have been
like," Willingham said. "It's been a
tremendous effort by a group of
young men and coaches in one of
those against-all-odds situations. It's
just exciting, and one of my most
cherished moments."
Mitchell also commented on the
turnaround.
"I think we are definitely proud of
where we came from,"he said.
"Being 2-5, not many people thought
we could do it. We knew deep down
inside that we had the players to do
it. To win four in a row against some
better teams is great for us, great for
the program."
With four straight wins in this
month, Stanford extended its record
in November to 6-1 under Willing
ham and won its second consecutive
Big Game. The Cardinal has now lost
just two of its last 10 clashes with
the Golden Bears.
While the Cardinal will ride a
wave of momentum into the Sun
Bowl, Cal heads to Hawaii for its
Christmas Day bowl game having
lost five of their last six games.
Stanford now holds a 49-39-11
lead in the overall series against the
Golden Bears, which stretches back
to 1892.

we could do it. We knew deep down
inside that we had the players to do
it. To win four in a row against some
better teams is great for us, great for
the program."
With four straight wins in this
month, Stanford extended its record
in November to 6-1 under Willing
ham and won its second consecutive
Big Game. The Cardinal has now lost
just two of its last 10 clashes with
the Golden Bears.
While the Cardinal will ride a
wave of momentum into the Sun
Bowl, Cal heads to Hawaii for its
Christmas Day bowl game having
lost five of their last six games.
Stanford now holds a 49-39-11
lead in the overall series against the
Golden Bears, which stretches back
to 1892.
Just before kickoff in the 99th
installment of the Big Game, the
Stanford football team marched
through the crowd on its way to the
field. During the Big Game, the
Stanford football team marched all
over California 42-21.
With the win, Stanford (6-5, 5-
3) earned its second straight bowl
appearance under head coach Ty
rone Willingham by clinching third
place in the conference and a berth
to the Sun Bowl, a Dec. 31 game in
El Paso, Texas.
"A lot of the cheers you hear in
the locker room are a reaction to
that," Willingham said after the
game. "Our young men are quite
excited about this opportunity.
Most importantly, though, they are
excited about what they have done
and what they have accomplished.
Because to be at 2-5 at one point in
the season and coming back is a
tremendous accomplishment."
Despite its fifth loss in six
games, Cal (6-5,3-5) still earned an
invitation to play in the Aloha Bowl
in Hawaii.
The Cardinal offset 375 yards of
total offense by the Golden Bears
by forcing three turnovers, record
ing six sacks and accumulating
more than 400 yards on offense.
The victory marked the fourth
straight for the Cardinal, who com
pleted a sweep in the month of No
vember and a sweep over its Cali
fornia opponents.
After Cal pulled to within 34-21
early in the fourth, Stanford put

the game out of reach with 8 min
utes left, engineering an 11-play,
75-yard touchdown drive, capped
off by a senior running back Mike
Mitchell 3-yard touchdown recep
tion from sophomore quarterback
Chad Hutchinson. It was Mitchell
himself who sustained the drive
with a 24-yard run on third and
eight from the Cal 27.
"I think the real momentum
changer, the real key to the game
was when they went down and
scored, and we came back with a
score," Willingham said. "I
thought that really dictated the
outcome of the ball game because
they were poised and gaining mo
mentu m at that point, and we came
back and answered. That was a
sign of a football team that had its
mind made up about victory."
Stanford jumped out to a 17-0
lead early in the contest. On the
first series of the game, a hit by se
nior free safety Josh Madsen
jarred the ball from the hands of
Cal's fumble-prone freshman run
ning back, Deltha O'Neal. The re
covery by junior cornerback Alis
tair White gave the Cardinal the
ball on the Bears' 36-yard line.
Stanford failed to get in the end
zone but took a three-point lead on
a 24-yard field goal by junior Kevin
Miller.
Junior tackle Carl Hansen's
first of two sacks enabled the Stan
ford defense to go three-and-out on
the next possession, and the Cardi
nal offense answered with a nine
play, 81-yard drive which came

mostly on the ground by Mitchell
and senior fullback Greg Cornelia.
Cornelia put the Cardinal inside the
Cal 10-yard line on a 33-yard run,
and Hutchinson threw the first of
his three touchdown passes on a 5-
yard, play-action pass to junior full
back Jon Ritchie.
"I think we had the momentum
the whole time, especially with scor
ing right away," Hutchinson said.
"We never looked back after that."
The Stanford defense got into the
scoring spree on the second play of
the second quarter. A Cardinal blitz
put Cal quarterback Pat Barnes
under heavy pressure, and Barnes'
pass was picked off by junior defen
sive end Kailee Wong. A former run
ning back, Wong returned the inter
ception 53 yards for a touchdown.
"We had a blitz on and because of
the formation, I knew I had to watch
for the screen," Wong said. Senior
strong safety "Eliel [Swinton] hit
Barnes, it came right to me, and I
took off."
The pick broke Barnes' streak of
151 consecutive pass attempts with
out an interception, a Pac-10 single
season record.
Barnes bounced right back, how
ever, and pulled Cal to within 10 by
completing four passes on a 75-yard
drive which culminated in a 17-yard
touchdown pass to junior tight end
Tony Gonzalez.
After stopping the Stanford
offense, the Bears had an opportuni
ty to salvage a bad first half with a
late second-quarter score. The Bears
drove downfield 47 yards before
being stopped on third and four at
the Stanford 44. Electing to go for it
on fourth down, Stanford got the
ball back with a little more than 2
minutes left in the half as Barnes
overthrew Gonzalez.
Two plays later, Hutchinson con
nected with redshirt freshman

flanker Troy Walters on an inside
screen. Walters took the pass and
cruised 56 yards untouched for a
Stanford score and a 24-7 lead.
"It was a great call by Coach,"
Hutchinson said. "He knew that
they have a tendency to blitz in that
situation, so he called the middle
screen and it went for a touchdown."
The Cardinal was not done for the
half, however. Barnes' next streak
without an interception ended at the
10 as sophomore free safety Tim
Smith picked off a Barnes pass just
out of Gonzalez's reach. A 37-yard
kick by Miller sent the game into
halftime with the Cardinal leading
27-7.
On the first drive of the second
half, Mitchell took the ball 24 yards
on the first play from scrimmage. A
Cal penalty set up a second-and
short situation, and the Cardinal
coaching staff called on junior wide
receiver Damon Dunn, who took an
end-around 37 yards for another
Cardinal touchdown.
"We were very fortunate that our
play-calling was very timely," Will
ingham said. "It also really helps
when your guys are making plays.
Good play calls are nothing if you
don't have players making plays.
They were executing, and that I
think was the difference."
Despite the 34-7 deficit, the Bears
did not break. A Barnes 20-yard
touchdown pass to wide receiver
Na'il Benjamin brought Cal to with
in 20. The Bear defense then blocked
a 44-yard field goal attempt by Miller
and held Stanford scoreless for the
remainder of the third.
Barnes took over in the beginning
of the fourth, completing four passes
on a Cal scoring drive that ended
with a touchdown pass to wide
receiver Bobby Shaw which pulled
the Bears to within 13 with more
than 12 minutes left in the game.
Barnes finished the game with 284
yards in the air on 21-of-32 passing.

"I think Pat Barnes is an excellent
quarterback," Willingham said. "We
were fortunate enough to have some
things in place to slow him down. At
times, he just made some fantastic
throws. That last touchdown was a
fantastic throw."
But Mitchell's touchdown catch
put the Card back up, and a two
point conversion from Hutchinson to
senior flanker Brian Manning
cemented the final score. Manning's
reception was the Cardinal's first
offensive two-point score of the sea
son.
It was the same old story for the
slumping Bears.
The first-possession fumble by
O'Neal was Cal's 16th fumble in the
last six games. In total, Cal's three
turnovers translated into 13 Stan
ford points.
The Bears offensive line also con
tinued to struggle, allowing six sacks
for a loss of 46 yards. Each of Stan
ford's front four — Hansen, Wong,
senior tackle Pete Swanson and
senior defensive end Bryan Werner
— recorded at least one sack on the
afternoon.
The Cardinal defense also forced
the Bears to rely too heavily on
Barnes, who totaled 284 yards in the
air, by limiting Cal to just 87 net
yards on the ground.
On the other side of the ball, the
Stanford offense enjoyed its best per
formance of the season. In addition
to tallying more than 200 yards
rushing, Hutchinson completed 16 of
his 25 passes for 184 yards and three
touchdowns. And for the first time
all season, the Cardinal did not turn
the ball over.
"Offensively, we felt like we were
going to score some points," Mitchell
said. "Every week we have been get
ting better. We knew we were com
ing together as a group, and there
were very few times today where
guys made mistakes."
Mitchell finished the game with

127 rushing yards on 24 carries, giv
ing him three 100-plus yard perfor
mances this season. As a team, the
Cardinal gained a season-high 220
net yards on the ground.
"That really helped," Hutchinson
said. "We knew then that in the
fourth quarter when we were up that
we could run the ball and run some
time off the clock."
So at just 2-5 through seven
games, the Cardinal could only qual
ify for a bowl by running the table
and winning its last four games in
the conference. The Cardinal did just
that in beating UCLA, USC, Wash
ington State and Cal in successive
weeks.
"It's very difficult to put in words
what these last few weeks have been
like," Willingham said. "It's been a
tremendous effort by a group of
young men and coaches in one of
those against-all-odds situations. It's
just exciting, and one of my most
cherished moments."
Mitchell also commented on the
turnaround.
"I think we are definitely proud of
where we came from,"he said.
"Being 2-5, not many people thought
we could do it. We knew deep down
inside that we had the players to do
it. To win four in a row against some
better teams is great for us, great for

ify for a bowl by running the table
and winning its last four games in
the conference. The Cardinal did just
that in beating UCLA, USC, Wash
ington State and Cal in successive
weeks.
"It's very difficult to put in words
what these last few weeks have been
like," Willingham said. "It's been a
tremendous effort by a group of
young men and coaches in one of
those against-all-odds situations. It's
just exciting, and one of my most
cherished moments."
Mitchell also commented on the
turnaround.
"I think we are definitely proud of
where we came from,"he said.
"Being 2-5, not many people thought
we could do it. We knew deep down
inside that we had the players to do
it. To win four in a row against some
better teams is great for us, great for
the program."
With four straight wins in this
month, Stanford extended its record
in November to 6-1 under Willing
ham and won its second consecutive
Big Game. The Cardinal has now lost
just two of its last 10 clashes with
the Golden Bears.
While the Cardinal will ride a
wave of momentum into the Sun
Bowl, Cal heads to Hawaii for its
Christmas Day bowl game having
lost five of their last six games.
Stanford now holds a 49-39-11
lead in the overall series against the
Golden Bears, which stretches back
to 1892.
