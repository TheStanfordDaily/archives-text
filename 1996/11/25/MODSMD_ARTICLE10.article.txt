# Berkeley fans pummel Tree

The Tree is dead. Long live the Tree.
Vengeance can be swift. After being demolished 42-
21 at Saturday's Big Game, numerous UC-Berkeley
students, in a charge sadly lacking in their team's of
fense, ruthlessly rushed the Tree and mutilated the
mascot's costume.
Junior Chris Cary, the Tree, was attacked during the
victory celebrations on the field and knocked to the
ground by more than 15 students. The students pro
ceeded to kick and hit the tree while others tore off
pieces of Cary's costume.
Cary said he was unable to stand up by himself be
cause of the number of students holding him to the
ground.
"The costume is very cumbersome and in order to
stand up, you have to have ideal conditions," Cary said.
"Ideal conditions do not include drunk Cal fans pum
melingyou."
Cary's security contingent was able to free him and
proceeded to take him to the sidelines, but the guards
were able to walk only 5 yards before another wave of
students took the Tree down again. This attack, Cary
said, was more vicious and he feared for his safety.
After his helmet straps cut off his breathing from
students tugging it, Cary decided his safety required
him to leave behind his costume. He unbuckled his
straps and was quickly led to the sidelines by security,
where he watched students demolish the Tree.
Senior Eric Schmitt, the Band's drum major, said he
was surprised by the attack on the Tree but realized
that the Band could not do anything at the time.
"It was kind of frustrating," Schmitt said. "We knew
that if we went to try and help him out, we would just
contribute to the chaos."

While the attack left him shaken and bruised with "a
kink in his neck," Cary quickly recovered and soon the
Tree was dancing once again, sans costume.
Cary expressed concern that the Cal students would
release their disappointment in such a violent fashion.
"Stanford and Cal have a friendly rivalry," Caiy said.
"I hope that the incident opens people's eyes to a trend
that has been rising lately — namely, a negative rivalry.
There has to be consequences."
Besides the attack on the Tree, no other incidents oc
curred. Stanford students attempted to tear down the
field goalposts but were repelled by security guards.
Cary said that although ripping down goalposts
causes property damage, it is a far healthier expression
jf school spirit than taking a "souvenir" from the mas
cot.
"You do not have someone dressing up as a goalpost
every week and sitting on the field," Cary said. "There
is no person inside the goalposts."
While Cary was unable to recognize any of the as
sailants, he said the Cal mascot Oski was not among his
attackers.
"I saw him on the sidelines, moping like usual," Cary
said.
The Tree's costume now currently resides in the
hands of many students, but Cary said the Tree will rise
from the ashes and will be fully functional by the Sun
Bowl.
"I have a unique opportunity to design a new tree,"
Cary said, "but I'm going to make the same old tree with
a few added features, such as a flamethrower." For next
time, he added ominously.
Cary will also set up a fund called "Replant the
Tree," which will solicit contributions from students to
pay for recreating the Tree.
"A dollar for the tree goes a long way," Cary said.
"What you're investing in is a living symbol of justice."
