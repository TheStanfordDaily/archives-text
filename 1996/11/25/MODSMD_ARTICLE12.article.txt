# Bosnia mission examined
## NATO force will be smaller, have more responsibility 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Now
that NATO arms have separated
Bosnia's warring factions, a
smaller NATO force is going
there to help tackle the tougher
job of pulling Bosnians back
together.
Clinton administration offi
cials voice optimism that the
extended troop deployment to
Bosnia can accomplish its mis
sion by June 1998 and leave the
war-torn country able to sustain
itself. Critics worry the adminis
tration has plunged U.S. troops
into an open-ended commitment
without clearly defined goals.
Interviews with Pentagon and
NATO officials in the week since
the follow-on force was
announced indicate that no con
crete plan has emerged for the
31,000-member force — 8,500
Americans among them — set to
deploy in mid-March. The posi
tioning of the troops, the number
of tanks and the cost of the mis
sion have yet to be fixed,
although some options are on the
table.
What is clear is that the
Bosnia Sustainment Force, or
SFOR, will have less than its pre

decessor IFOR, the departing
Peace Implementation Force.
"When we went in, in the first
place, we were prepared to meet a
resisting army," Defense Secre
tary William Perry said in brief
ing reporters on the follow-on
force. "That's not an issue we're
facing today
Soldiers — roughly half as
many as IFOR had — will ride in
tanks and armored cars, carry
machine guns and live in many of
the same barracks. But their mis
sion will be geared more to
rebuilding Bosnia than separat
ing warring parties, NATO and
Pentagon officials say.
Defense officials in Washing
ton and Kurope said SFOR will
serve two key functions: to deter
the warring factions from resum
ing their ruinous ethnic wars and
to help an array of civilian orga
nizations begin the multibillion
dollar rebuilding job.
"More than the military
out and glaring down civilian
troublemakers, it's going to be
much more the military involved
with civilian rebuilders and
implementing their plans," said a
NATO official who spoke on con

dition of anonymity. "Our rule as
the lead dog is essentially over."
An Army official, also speak
ing anonymously, said options
include a greater contingent of
military police and more civil
affairs units able to help with
rebuilding.
Missions NATO planning fore
sees include:
• Helping secure the orderly
return of refugees to their
homes, a process that could spark
renewed ethnic clashes.
•Assisting with engineering
projects such as road and bridge
building.
• Focusing patrols on poten
tial trouble spots.
• Securing major relief convoys.
• Providing safe neutral
ground for meetings of faction
representatives.
SFOR will work with the
Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe on elec
tion issues, the U.N. High Com
missioner for Refugees on
refugee resettlement, the Euro
pean Union on economic aid and
war crimes investigators from
The Hague, Netherlands, on war
crimes matters.
