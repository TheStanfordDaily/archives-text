Big Game win should
spur students to take
pride in football team

HUMBLE PIE WAS never
fed so well. For all the nat
tering nabobs of nega
tivism, the Stanford football team
roared back from a lackluster start
to the season, humiliating critics
and rewarding the faithful with a
42-21 rout of the dirty Bears
across the Bay on Saturday.
But while the 99th annual Big
Game had much riding on it — a
bowl berth, bragging rights over
the Axe — many students chose to
stay home. It was the first non
sold out Big Game at Memorial
Stadium since 1974. Some cited
high ticket prices, $50 a week
before the event, as a major reason
for staying at home. Yet consider
ing several thousand camped out
on "Tightwad Hill" directly behind
the stadium, that excuse rings hol
low. Those determined to see the
game could do so for free. Seniors
should have been up in droves to
avenge the one-point loss of their
sophomore year.
The true reason why many stu
dents did not make the trek up to
Berkeley is because they did not
want to be inconvenienced. It
would have taken all Saturday to
go up and root for the team — time
"better" spent on class assign
ments, homework or preparing
cover letters. Perhaps success has
bred complacency as Stanford has
held the Axe after eight of the last
10 Big Games.
Students — particularly under
graduates — who have even a
shred of pride in the University
should have gone up. Rarely does
one single event so galvanize Stan
ford students and its alumni. It is
the most important game of the
year and even the most disinter
ested and introverted of Stanford
students could not help but feel a
bit of pride that Stanford's collec
tive spirit had triumphed over the

unholy foe. All students should
have been just as zealous as those
brave souls who rushed on to the
field to defend the Tree from
crazed hoards of Cal students.
Those who did not venture to
Berkeley have the opportunity to
savor another possible Stanford
victory, come Dec. 31. The 63rd
Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, will
receive national coverage live on
CBS New Year's Eve. Tickets
ranging from $12 to $125 are on
sale now.
As for Cal, one wonders even if
lobotomizing the whole Bear team
(as if the players' IQ did not equal
their neck sizes already) would not
have stopped them stumbling into
a bowl berth. Though not as glam
orous as Honolulu, the Sun Bowl
will definitely give students more
to watch and brag about. For those
lucky enough to be there, a variety
of events from the Sun Carnival to
Sun Bowl Festival will welcome
visitors to one of the oldest bowl
games in the nation.
But that is only if people go.
Admittedly, last year's Liberty
Bowl lacked excitement. Only
about 47,000 seats out of the
80,000 seat stadium were filled
and the game had no network cov
erage. If Saturday's festivities
after Big Game were an indication,
the team will have a bland recep
tion indeed. The only noticeable
public parties going on that night
were in Robinson House and
Lambda Nu. Is it possible Stanford
students need more stamina? As
moronic as the Cal Bears are, one
wonders if they have figured out
something about school spirit that
Stanford students have not. If cost
is not a factor, students who can
should go.
While congratulations to the
team are in order, perhaps the stu
dents could have shown more
enthusiasm. Just as the bowls are
the second season for college foot
ball, the Sun Bowl offers Stanford
students a chance to redeem them
selves after their own lackluster
showing this past campaign.
