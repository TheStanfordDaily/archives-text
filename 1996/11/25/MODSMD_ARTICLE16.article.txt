## Rapping about Big Fun 
### 
FIS FOR Friday. F is for fun. It
should follow that Fridays are for
fun, but I discovered recently that
this is not always the case.
On a recent Friday, I was sitting in my
room contemplating what to do with the
evening. I was short on funds but full of
energy. Finding myself with no viable
options, I made a mental note to make
more friends, threw on a jacket and tra
versed the campus in search of fun.
Alas, fun can be an unpredictable and
illusive beast. Sometimes it is aggressive,
and it finds you while you're working on a
problem set or checking your e-mail. Other
times it hides away in dark crevaces or dis
guises itself like Oscar's voice out in the
cold night.
On this particular Friday, I found fun.
The fun I found was obnoxious, rambunc
tious, and most importantly, it was Big.
In this column I have detailed my expe
rience with the Big Fun in street verse.
Feel free to chant it to your favorite beat:
Walkin' toward a party —
The bass is thumpin'.
Check the dancin' frosh —
Their bodies are thumpin'.
Big Fun is playing;
The party they're slaying
With the wiggedy-whack Rembrandts
Who should be decaying.
Now, women wearing Keds
Parade around,
Reveling happily

In this horrible sound.
I see an old friend.
He catches my eye.
He lip synchs the words —
I know that something's awry.
The pulsing lights
Highlight three chords.
I notice upperclassmen
Running for the doors.
Bobbing their heads
And chewing on gum,
The dorm-o-files freak
While my mind grows numb.
The "Friends" song ends
And my headache mends.
The DJ's all too short pause —
it hope to me sends.
He prepares the next number.
I'm wishin' for thunder.
I hear acoustic guitars —
Oops. Another blunder.
"If I Could Walk 500 Miles,"
You know I surely would.
To get out of this pit
And into another 'hood.
Just as I'm starting
To think about leaving,
A boy walks up.
And what is he wielding?
Car bumper stickers

With an ironic pun.
Car bumper stickers
That read "Big Fun."
He sticks them on his front.
He puts them on his back.
He affixes those stickers
To his Power Rangers knapsack.
He starts to stick one
Right on my chest,
But I take a step back.
Hey pal, "no me molest."
More rabid cheers
From the crowd — no, the throng.
As Mr. DJ queues up —
A Mariah Carey song.
I couldn't get out
Fast enough
The dorm's FA yellin' out,
"Hey, leave that cup."
Now I'm hanging my head
As I'm walking home
I found Big Fun,
But now I'm all alone.
Word.

Elliott Brown will perform tonight at his
program center. Tickets are $2 at the door.
