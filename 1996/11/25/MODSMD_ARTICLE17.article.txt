Parking on campus is a subsidized luxury, not a right

THE DAILY EDITORIAL staff
appears to believe it is spending
top dollar for parking at $70 per
year per permit and thus deserves bet
ter service.
The fact is, $70 per year represents
a more than 94-percent subsidy. Esti
mates of the 1995 capital, maintenance

and rental cost of on-campus parking
yield values of $1,800 per year for
spaces in parking structures and
$1,070 per year for surface lots
(assuming land valued at $1 million
per acre â€” source Stanford Bike Coali
tion). Until parking permits reach
these levels, permit-purchasers are

being subsidized by others, including
those who choose to use alternate
transportation modes.
These estimates neglect the exter
nalities associated with parking lots,
both in ecological impact and negative
impact on the general campus environ
ment.

For students living on campus,
parking is more luxury than necessity.
There's no reason for the University to
feel compelled to provide them with the
service at such a subsidy.
Let's give the bulldozers a rest.
