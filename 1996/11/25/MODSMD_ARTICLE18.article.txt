# The 						Tree deserves more support than Kailee Wong gave
## 
### 
Like every other Stanford student, I
was shocked and saddened by the sight
of the Tree being mobbed at the end of
the football game Saturday. Though the
violence was sudden and horrible, it can
almost be understood within the context
of Big Game.
What can't be understood is the state
ment made by football team member
Kailee Wong later that day. Wong said,
"Hey, you can beat up our Tree all you

want, as long as we win the football
game." Would he say the same thing if
the entire Stanford Band was attacked
by UC-Berkeley students, or for that
matter about violence done to our stu
dents? Though Wong may think that
football is all-important to everyone on
this campus, there are those who hold
the safety of a fellow student higher.
Chris Gary could have been seriously
injured, and although that may not
mean much to Wong, I know some peo
ple who would rather have the Tree
back than the victory of your precious
football match. I sincerely hope that
this quote by Wong has been taken out
of context by all of the newspaper arti
cles I have read it in and that he truly

did not mean it.
