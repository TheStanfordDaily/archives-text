# U.S. News can't rate colleges like toasters
## 
### 
Mel Elfin, an executive editor of U.S.
News & World Report, has recently
written a number of letters, including
one to The Stanford Daily, critiquing
the student campaign to reform U.S.
News & World Report.
In his letters, he notes a number of
disagreements that he has with our
campaign. All but one of these disagree
ments is objective, and while I am con

vinced that we are right, there is little
need to discuss them perpetually in
print.
However, there is one serious philo
sophical difference. Mr. Elfin has writ
ten, and continues to write in various
contexts, that comparative rankings
are freely available for common house
hold appliances and, thus, should be
similarly available for a college educa
tion that can cost up to $30,000 per
year.
To this I counter that a college edu
cation is not a dishwasher and
wouldn't be even if it cost $100,000 per
year.
