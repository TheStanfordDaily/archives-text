# Offensive line grows up fast
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
When Stanford stumbled its way to a 2-5 start this
season, the Cardinal offensive line received most of
the blame. However, after destroying California 42-
21 Saturday, the line finally received the credit it de
served.
"This was a big game, and the offensive line
stepped up and played a great game," said senior run -
ning back Mike Mitchell, who rushed for a season
high 127 yards. "It was kind of easy — I just followed
them, and there were huge holes. All the credit goes
to the offensive line; they played great today."
Stanford's offensive line returned only two
starters from last year's squad in seniors Brad Bad
ger (right guard) and Nate Parks (left tackle). The
other three linemen — junior Andrew Kn>eker (left
guard) and sophomores Mike McLaughlin (center)
and Jeff Cronshagen (right tackle) — completed the

inexperienced, young line that Stan
ford began the season with.
And the inexperience showed for
the first seven games of the season.
In those games, the line allowed 32
sacks of sophomore quarterback
Chad Hutchinson and paved the way
for just 629 rushing yards (less than
90 yards per game). In addition, dur
ing those games, the Cardinal
offense only scored 90 points (12.8
points per game) and held onto the
ball for just under 27.5 minutes per
game.
It was not until the USC game,
according to senior fullback Adam
Salina, that the Cardinal offensive
line got its act together.
"I think [the line's improvement]
stems from the USC game,". Salipa
said. "USC probably has the best
defensive line in the Pac-10 that we
were going to face, and the job they
did against USC really brought us
back and brought up our confi
dence."
Whether it was against USC or
against UCLA, when the Cardinal's
winning streak began, it is clear that
the offensive line has finally come
together and figured out how to win.
During the Cardinal's four-game win
streak, Stanford has averaged 135.7
rushing yards per game and has
scored 30 points per game.
Additionally, the line has allowed
just 11 sacks and has helped Stan
ford hold the ball for 31 minutes, 15
seconds per game.
"It just took us four or five games
to gel as a unit," Parks said, "and
once we got going you see the result
— we definitely have the talent to
play anybody."
The offensive line has improved
with each week, decreasing the oppo
sition's sack totals and raising the
level of the Cardinal's running game
each week. But no one necessarily
expected the linemen to dominate
Cal the way they did on Saturday.
Against the Bears, the Cardinal
posted season highs in points (42),
rushing yards (220) and total yards
(404). The line, which only allowed
two sacks, also helped Stanford aver
age nearly 6 yards per play.
"It was one of the best games I've
seen them play," Hutchinson said.

"They did a great job all game. There
have been games where they have
done well for a while, but this was a
game where they played well the
whole time."
Part of the reason that Stanford
won the war in the trenches was that
the offensive line, which had been
banged up for the last few weeks,
was finally healthy.
"We were very fortunate; we got
Nate Parks back today along with
Greg Clark, who had missed last
week," said head coach Tyrone Will
ingham, who became the first Stan
ford coach since Bill Walsh and only
the third in Stanford history to take
his first two teams to bowl games.
"Those two guys gave us something
going to our left side that we hadn't
had in weeks past. It allowed us to
have a little depth that we hadn't
had for a while too.''
Those touchdown plays awed
some of the other Cardinal players as
well.
"Watching some of these touch
downs, you turn back and you see
Cal guys on the ground, and it was

wonderful," Salina said.
Not only are Stanford's offensive
numbers impressive, but the way in
which the team earned them is
equally outstanding.

'I wasn't even sup
posed to play today, but
it was Cal so you got to
go for it. We just put 10
rolls of tape on it and
said, Screw it — let's
go for it.''

The Cardinal's longest scoring
plays came on an inside screen pass
to redshirt freshman Troy Walters
for 56 yards and a reverse to junior
Damon Dunn that went for 37 yards.
On both plays, it seemed that every
Cardinal blocker "pancaked" his

man.
"We set the reverse up nicely,"
Parks said. "I was opposite the play
side, so I was selling the run. I
looked, and we had the best wall I
have ever seen on a reverse. And
[Dunn] just ran it through. It was
awesome."
However, it was not just the big
plays in which the line was effective.
The linemen executed on every sin
gle play.
"The offensive line just handled
them," Mitchell said. "They were
taking care of their jobs the best they
could do. I am just speechless, they
played unreal — unreal.
"Whether or not the offensive line
played a perfect game on Saturday is
irrelevant. What's significant is that
a group of five guys came together
and turned it up a notch in the most
important game of the season."
"I wasn't even supposed to play
today, but it was Cal so you got to go
for it," said Parks, who was still suf
fering from an ankle injury. "We just
put 10 rolls of tape on it and said,
'Screw it — let's go for it.' "
