# Sun Bowl awaits Stanford
## 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
On a cloudy day in Berkeley, Stanford had
sun — Sun Bowl, that is.
The Stanford football team, 2-5 and left for
dead a month ago, capped off a four-game win
ning streak to close the regular season with a
resounding 42-21 victory over the California
Golden Bears. With this remarkable stretch,
Stanford earned a berth in the Norwest Sun
Bowl in El Paso, Texas, on Dec. 31.
"We were just extended an invitation to par
ticipate in the Norwest Sun Bowl, and the
Stanford football family gladly accepted,"
Stanford head coach Tyrone Willingham said.
"We are excited about this opportunity. To be
2-5 and come back, to go to a bowl is a great
opportunity."
In one of the most remarkable turnarounds
in recent memory, Willingham and his team
bounced back from a humiliating loss to Ore
gon State and a trashing at the hands of Ari
zona State to finish alone in third place in the
Pacific 10 Conference with a 5-3 record. Four
weeks ago, such notions seemed about as like
ly as the hoop skirt being back in vogue.
But the players and coaches showed
remarkable resiliency. And as the team filled
reporters' notebooks with every cliche imagin
able, Stanford described it as such.
"It just shows the amount of character and
heart that we have," said junior defensive end
Kailee Wong. "We just rallied around each
other."
"We're proud of each other," said senior
running back Mike Mitchell. "A lot of people
doubted us, but we just kept faith. It's just
great."

"It was a total team effort," said sophomore
quarterback Chad Hutchinson. "Everybody
picked up their play."
"We just wanted to win [the last four
games)," said senior nose tackle Pete Swanson.
"We took it one game at a time and now we're
in a bowl game, and I think it's beautiful."
On Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal came
out with its most complete and focused effort
of the season. The defense shut down the Gold
en Bears' high-powered attack, limiting junior
tight end Tony Gonzalez to two catches while
forcing senior quarterback Pat Barnes into
three interceptions.
Offensively, Stanford never turned the ball
over while coming up with big, timely plays
that led to scores, including a 56-yard screen
pass play by redshirt freshman Troy Walters
late in the first half and a 37-yard reverse by
junior Damon Dunn on the first drive in the
third quarter to put it up 34-7.
"We were very fortunate that our (plsy)
calls were timely," Willingham said. "It's very
important our guys were making those plays.'
Even though the Cardinal ran circles
around the Golden Bears, Christmas still came
early for them. About two hours after having
their heads handed to them, Aloha Bowl repre
sentatives made it official and extended an
invitation to play in the Christmas Day game
Cal's opponent will either be Texas Tech or
Texas A&M if the Aggies can knock off the
Texas Longhorns on Saturday. So despite los
ing five out of its last six contests, Steve Mafi

ago. But Mariucci remains upbeat
about guiding his team into a
bowl.
"We'll bring a team that will
represent our university in a first
class fashion," Mariucci said. "We
are an exciting team, that can
make for an exciting bowl game.
Whoever we play, we'll make it a
heck of a game."
Stanford's opponent is yet to
be determined. The Sun Bowl
pits the third-place Pac-10 team
against a fifth Big Ten opponent.
It will likely be Michigan State,
assuming Penn State goes to an
alliance bowl. However, with two

losses, there is still some doubt
about the Nittany Lions, so the
Cardinal could very well play
Michigan. Either way, it pro
vides an intriguing matchup.
Michigan State is Willingham's
alma mater while the Wolverines
are the team Stanford faced in
its last Rose Bowl appearance in
1972.
But for now, Willingham and
his staff will bask in the glow of its
remarkable November run.
"It's really hard or very diffi
cult to put into words the last four
weeks," Willingham said. "We
have had to fight back against all
odds. I am extremely proud of our
young kids. I am extremely proud
of our coaches. This is one of the
proudest moments in my coaching
career."
