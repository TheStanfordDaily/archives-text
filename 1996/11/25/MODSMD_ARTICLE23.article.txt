# Last game is truly a Big Game

Big Splash. Big Game. Big Fun.
What a day. For me, last Saturday began at
6:45 a.m., when I awoke to the noise of the rest
of my suitemates taking showers, blasting Ala
nis Morissette, prodding me out of bed saving,
"Vanessa, it's time."
The excitement was so high, it almost felt
like Christmas. So, as physically painful as it
was, I got out of bed and prepared for a full day
in Berkeley.
We were on the road within the hour and
made it to Berkeley by 9 a.m., just in time to
catch a parking spot in the "Special Event —
$15" parking lot before heading to the water
polo game.
Early birds that we were, we bought our tick
ets right away but, within 10 minutes, the line
to get into the water polo game wrapped around
the corner. There were Cal hats galore bobbing
in line, but, considering the early time and the
fact that the game was in Berkeley, there was an
impressive number of hard-core Stanford fans
waiting as well.
Inside the gates at Big Splash — the name
given to the annual game played between Stan
ford and Cal on Big Game day — Cal fans may
have outnumbered Stanford ones in quantity,
but certainly not in spirit. Stanford fans were
intense as they cheered loud and strong, far
rivaling any mutters attempted by Cal.
During the game, the Cardinal water polo
team had its moments, but didn't compete up to
its usual quality of play, receiving a disappoint

ing 9-7 loss to the Bears. Nevertheless, the fans
remained supportive, knowing their team could
make it up at the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration tournament next week.
At one point in the game, play was delayed as

an immature Cal fan mercilessly threw our "Go
Big Red" boy — a Phi Delt pledge dressed in red
pajamas with a water polo stretched on his head
who was instructed to lead the Cardinal fans in
this infamous cheer — into the pool. Clearly, the
Bears were jealous. Here they owned three
quarters of the crowd and there was not even
one "Big Blue" boy to lead cheers.
The streets on the way to the football stadi
um were festive, lined with people of all ages
wearing vivid blue or red colors. We missed the
kickofT, arriving about 15 minutes late but were
ecstatic to see that Stanford had already scored
its first field goal and touchdown.
