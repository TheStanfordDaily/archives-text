## Volleyball swiftly beats Sun Devils 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
Before a boisterous Maples Pavilion crowd, the
Stanford women's volleyball team (25-2, 17-1
Pacific 10 Conference) dismantled overmatched
Arizona State (9-16, 4-14) to give the Cardinal its
45th consecutive home victory.
In the first game, the Card quickly jumped out
to an early 6-0 lead behind the serving and defense
of freshman outside hitter Jaimi Gregory and the
strong right arm of junior outside hitter Kristin
Folkl. Stanford truly dominated, as every Cardinal
hitter seemed to find an opening in the porous Sun
Devil defense. Stanford's front line appeared to
Arizona State as an impenetrable fortress, shut
ting down the Sun Devils' hitters.
Stanford moved ahead 11-0, but then the Card
started to lose its focus. A few errors later, Ari
zona State pulled within six points, prompting
Stanford to call timeout. The Cardinal settled
down and finished the game off 15-6 behind the
hitting of outside hitters Kerri Walsh, a freshman,
and Debbie Lambert, a junior.
"I thought we came out real strong," said coach
Don Shaw. "We were really fired up, maybe even
too fired up."
The second game gave the Card another chance
to showcase its offense. Stanford gained a 7-3
advantage, as senior outside hitter Eileen Murfee,
perhaps the most consistent member of the talent
ed Cardinal squad, recorded kill after kill. Stan
ford did not let up, scorching the Sun Devils with
fastballs coming from Folkl and Walsh. Junior
middle blocker Paula McNamee finished off Ari
zona State with a block and gave Stanford a 15-4
game-two win.

Card relentlessly attacked the
undersized Arizona State line
up. Walsh, Folkl and Lambert
spearheaded the Stanford attack
once again, leading the squad to
an 8-1 lead. The Sun Devils ral
lied but never came close, and

Stanford disposed of its oppo
nents 15-8 to win the match.
Arizona State "lost a majority
of their offense last year," Shaw
said. "I give them a lot of credit
for continually playing hard."
The Cardinal defense stifled
any attempts by the Sun Devil
hitters to find their rhythm. If
the Stanford blockers did not
make the play, the Cardinal
back row was there to dig the

ball. This pattern seemed to pre
vail throughout the evening.
Stanford will finish its regu
lar season tomorrow against
Oral Roberts, before starting
the NCAA tournament and
striving for its second NCAA
championship in three years.
"I think (the regular season]
has been long enough," Shaw
said. "We are really cranked
up."
