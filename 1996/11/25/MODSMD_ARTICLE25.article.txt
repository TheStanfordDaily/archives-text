# Stanford loses Big Splash 9-7
## 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
There comes a game in
every team's season when all
of the pieces just don't fall into
place. Big Splash, the annual
showdown between California
and Stanford, took place Sat
urday at the Spieker Aquatics
Complex in Berkeley. The Car
dinal, currently ranked No. 2
in the nation, put forth a good
effort but came up short,
falling to fourth-ranked Cal 9-
7. The loss dropped the Card
to 16-6 (7-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation), while Cal
improved to 13-6 (5-3 MPSF).
The Bears started strong
and carried a 5-2 lead into the
locker room at halftime as the
Cardinal struggled to get
going. But the second half
proved to be a different story,
as the Stanford team that has
captured victories over each of
the top 10 teams in the coun
try came to life. The Cardinal
managed to find the net three
times in the third quarter
while holding the potent Cal
offense to just one, pulling to
within one goal of a 6-6 tie.
The Card carried the
momentum into the fourth
quarter and seemed to be on
the verge of completing anoth
er amazing comeback win
when Stanford sophomore

Arturo Rodelo scored with 3
minutes, 55 seconds remain
ing to knot the game at 7-7.
But Cal, despite missing
one of the top players in the
country in injured Brent
Albright, took advantage of an
offensive foul to score with
2:38 remaining on a break
away goal by Jeff Moloughney.
The Bears padded their lead
just over a minute later, scor
ing a goal in a man-up situa
tion to give them the 9-7 edge.
Stanford had a final
attempt at tying the game
with 30 seconds remaining but
couldn't find the net as the
shot sailed just over the bar.
The story of the game
proved to be costly turnovers,
as the Cardinal was forced to
make bad passes thanks to
Cal's tough press defense, and
the Bears took advantage of
the extra opportunities.
"The thing that really hurt
us the most was that we had
way too many turnovers and
offensive fouls," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti.
"Because of it, they killed us
on the counterattack."
Clearly, the exceptional
play of the Cal team served to
magnify the mistakes of the
Cardinal. Creating many of
the turnovers due to its heady
defensive play, Cal managed to
score an astounding six of its
nine goals from counterattacks
or man-up situations and held
the Stanford offense (which
averages more than 10 goals
scored per game) to just seven
goals.
"Cal was really intense; they
were pumped up for the game,"
said senior defender Tyrone
Miller. "You could tell from the

beginning that they were ready
to play, and we just didn't seem
to be clicking."
Coming off breakthrough
wins against third-ranked UCLA
and No. 1 USC that gave Stan
ford the first-place finish in the
conference, the Cardinal may
have struggled to focus on a
game that was not a must-win
situation.
"We went into this game a lit
tle bit overconfident," Lehoczky
said. "We had lost a bit of our
focus, and it hurt us."
Although the loss is a disap
pointment, the Stanford team

travels this weekend back to
Berkeley for the MPSF tourna
ment, this time hungrier than
ever for the wins it needs to trav
el to the NCAA tournament.
"We haven't had a loss like
that in a while," Miller said.
"This game showed us that we
need to work even harder."
Perhaps a wakeup call is just
what the Cardinal needs to have
the best mindset going into the
tournament. Last year the Card
won Big Splash, then finished
sixth in the MPSF tournament
while Cal won second place at
the NCAA Championships.
