There comes a game in
every team's season when all
of the pieces just don't fall into
place. Big Splash, the annual
showdown between California
and Stanford, took place Sat
urday at the Spieker Aquatics
Complex in Berkeley. The Car
dinal, currently ranked No. 2
in the nation, put forth a good
effort but came up short,
falling to fourth-ranked Cal 9-
7. The loss dropped the Card
to 16-6 (7-1 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation), while Cal
improved to 13-6 (5-3 MPSF).
The Bears started strong
and carried a 5-2 lead into the
locker room at halftime as the
Cardinal struggled to get
going. But the second half

captured victories over each of
the top 10 teams in the coun

one of the top players in the
country in injured Brent
Albright, took advantage of an
offensive foul to score with
2:38 remaining on a break
away goal by Jeff Moloughney.
The Bears padded their lead
just over a minute later, scor
ing a goal in a man-up situa
tion to give them the 9-7 edge.
Stanford had a final
attempt at tying the game
with 30 seconds remaining but
couldn't find the net as the
shot sailed just over the bar.
The story of the game
proved to be costly turnovers,
as the Cardinal was forced to
make bad passes thanks to
Cal's tough press defense, and
the Bears took advantage of
the extra opportunities.
"The thing that really hurt
us the most was that we had
way too many turnovers and
offensive fouls," said head
coach Dante Dettamanti.
"Because of it, they killed us
on the counterattack."
Clearly, the exceptional
play of the Cal team served to
magnify the mistakes of the
Cardinal. Creating many of
the turnovers due to its heady
