1 Stanford women's basketbatl
team (3-0) did this weekend with

two overwhelming victories over
Northern Arizona (0-1) and Pur
due (1-1) by a total margin of 74
points.
"Tt ft Lunmeij arte? were out
matched to say the least. North
ern Arizona had few weapons

with which to stop the bigger,
stronger, faster Cardinal, and the
Stanford victory came on a series
of streaks that paced the Card
Way ahnftd oftMTtoiftWrjft&s.
"Stanford's a class act," said
Northern Arizona head coach
Meg Sanders. "They have a great
coach and a great team. We were
definitely outmatched in terms of
size and speed."
In the first half senior guard
Kate Starhird found the bottom
of the net on six of her nine
attempts including a perfect 4-
for-4 from three-point land to
lead all scorers at the break with
18. Junior forward Olympia Scott
was also effective early on record
ing 10 points and eight rebounds.
Stanford opened the game
with five unanswered points but
the Lumbeijacks rattled off five
of their own to give the impres
sion that they were ready to play.
But the Card soon put all doubts
to rest with a 16-0 run sparked by
nine points from Scott that put
the Card up 21-5 with 12:01
remaining in the half.
The Lumberjacks cut the lead
to 10, but Stanford turned it up
to extend the lead to as much as
20 before ending the period up by
18.
"I thought it was a good team
effort," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "It was a little
sloppy at times. In the second
half our depth, pressure and
rebounding wore them down."
Stanford's depth may have
been a factor, but it was junior
forward Vanessa Nygaard's hot
hand that gave the Card the edge
early in the half. Nygaard scored
her 18 second-half points in the
first 6 minutes of the period to
help stretch the lead to 40.
"In the first 5 minutes [of the
second halfl, if you're up and the
other team starts scoring it's a
momentum shift," Scott said.
"We try to put the hammer
down" at the start of the half.
Scott and her teammates did
just that, and Stanford won 96-
48. Nygaard led all scorers with
20 and was followed by Starbird
with 18, Scott with 14 and junior
center Naomi Mulitauaopele with
13.
The Card's 83-57 triumph
over the Purdue Boilermakers
was only slightly more challeng
ing. Purdue, the last team to beat
Stanford at Maples Pavilion, is
nowhere near the team it was
three seasons ago when it edged
the Card in the West Regional
Final. It has a new coach (Nell
Fortner who assisted Van-
Derveer on last year's national
squad) and only three returning
players.
"This is not the Purdue team
we played here before," Van-

Junior forward Olympia Scott lays it up in yesterday's game
against Purdue, which the Cardinal won 83-57.
Derveer said. "I'll be rooting for
[Fortner] in every other game but
this one. She's doing a good job
with the hand she's been dealt."
Despite numerous turnovers by
both teams in the first half (most
ly on traveling calls), Stanford
edged ahead of the Boilermakers
midway through the period to take
a commanding 16-point lead. Pur
due cut the lead to 11 by the end of
the half but could do little to stop
Scott, who dominated most of the
game.

Stanford continued to control
the game in the second half as
Mulitauaopele warmed up around
the glass. Mulitauaopele ended the
contest with a double-double (16
points, 11 rebounds) and helped
the Card extend the lead to as
many as 29.
Scott, whose 24 points was a
career best, led all scorers and was
followed closely by Starbird with
22. Nygaard added 14 to round out
the team's double-figure scorers.
"It's hard being No. 1 because
expectations are so high," Scott
said. "At the same time, I'm trying
to show why we're No. 1. If we can
beat teams by 40, we need to do
that."
