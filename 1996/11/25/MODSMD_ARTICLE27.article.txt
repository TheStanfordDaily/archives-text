## Runners aim for NCAA title 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
With a successful season for
both the men's and women's
cross country teams coming to
an end, the Cardinal will travel
to Tucson, Ariz" today to com
pete in the NCAA Cross Country
Championships.
Both teams garnered bids for
the championship by winning
the District VIII Championships
on Nov. 16, one week after
clinching both Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships.
The opportunity to race at
nationals "is incredible," said
junior Kortney Dunscombe.
"We've been planning all year to
go to nationals, but we had to
make it through districts to
qualify. So it's really exciting to
be able to talk about it and dis
cuss our race plans."
The team to beat for the
women will be Villanova, who
jumped to the top of last week's
poll when former-No. 1 and
defending national champion
Providence lost in its district
meet. Villanova, ranked fifth in
the previous poll, was chosen
rather than the Cardinal to take
over the top spot.
"Our coach always says that
rankings mean nothing," Dun
scombe said. "So our team's
really focusing on doing well at
nationals and proving how good
we are. We'll just see how the
results come out then."
Other teams in the hunt for
the championship are George
town and Colorado, currently
ranked third and fourth, respec
tively. The meet will be the first
opportunity for the women to go
up against any other top five
teams.

The team is poised to improve
greatly from a successful season
last year, when it finished ninth
overall after taking second in
the district and third ih the con
ference. The race should be wide
open for any team, especially
with the juggling that has
occurred in the polls. Though
ranked higher than Villanova
when Providence fell from the
top spot last week, Stanford,
Colorado and Georgetown were
not allowed to climb up the polls
because of Villanova's four-place
jump.

Ihe race will also give the
men their first glimpse this sea
son of the No. 1 team and
defending national champion
Arkansas. After winning the
Southeastern Conference cham
pionship and their district race,
the Razorbacks put a greater
gap in the polls between them
selves and the Cardinal. Third
ranked Colorado and fifth
ranked North Carolina State
will also be in the hunt for the
national title.
