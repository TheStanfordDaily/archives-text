It was a sacrifice for the team.
The Stanford Daily pave up a
close game of flag football with
Berkeley's Daily Californian staff
Saturday to give a boost to the
Cardinal team that would crush
the Bears later that day at Big
Game.
Continuing in the trend of a
reverse correlation between the
Daily's success in the traditional
Ink Bowl and the football team's
chances for Big Game, a team of
12 journalists-turned-athletes
held themselves to one touch
down, leaving the Daily Cal with
a 14-8 victory.
Cal — with help from an
undoubtedly biased referee of its
own choosing — took the lead
early in the game. Only 7 minutes
after kickoff, a Berkeley player
broke through the Daily's lines
for a touchdown.
A few minutes later, Stanford

was called for its first penalty,
allowing the Newsbears to score
again on a long pass. With a suc
cessful two-point conversion, Cal
increased the lead to 14.
The Daily team pulled togeth
er after the shock of being down
two touchdowns, with David
"Don't blame the QB" Wolitz
making a successful run for a
first down. The Stanford team's
fate looked like it was changing
when Sam "First-round draft
pick" Mankiewicz caught a long
pass in the end zone.
But the referee — decked out
in gear that made him look like
Tiger Woods with a contract to
endorse the Weenies — threw a
flag for holding, leaving Cal with
the ball at the half.
Hugh "Blame it on me"
Handeyside started off a promis
ing second half for the Daily, but
Cal had soon intercepted a pass
by Wolitz. Jeremy "You're play
ing in a suit?!" Stone replied by
catching the first of two impor
tant interceptions which would
make him a unanimous choice for
the game's most valuable player.
After two more brilliant catch
es by Ben "That skinny guy sure
can play" Freda and Justin "Off
the sidelines and into the fray"
Mills, Mankiewicz once again
showed his worth by receiving a
pass from Patrick "Flag football
czar" Smith for Stanford's sole
touchdown. The Daily also man
aged to eliminate Cal's Andre the
Giant from the game.

The rest of the game passed in
a mess of foul calls and incomple
tions, leaving the final score at
14-8, despite the best efforts of
Dan "Fleet Street trained me
well" Wolk, Matt "Those are my
glasses you're stepping on"
Spence, Jimmy "I'm open" Boe
gle, Ed "I'll leave the glory for
Stoner" Guzman and Derek
"Does he work for us?" James.
Support on the sidelines came
from Editor in Chief Beth "Con
cede defeat now" Berselli, Martin
"I've got the Gatorade" Yeung,
Kristie "Give me the camera"
Smith, Meredith "Beth's room
mate" McMorrow, Grace "Go
Wolitz" Wang and David "Sleep
ing with the enemy" Arulanan
tham.
