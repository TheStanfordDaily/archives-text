### David Felman 
While Stanford's football team was busy at Big
(iame, about 60 chess enthusiasts were exchanging
pawns at the first chess tournament held at Stanford
in six years.
Sponsored by the Cardinal Chess Club, the tour
nament marks a revival of chess at Stanford.
Chess club members from area universities and
tudents from local elementary and high schools at
tended the tournament, along with residents from all
ver the Bay Area. Participants were divided into sec
tions based on current United States Chess Federa
tion rankings.
One participant had a federation rating of 2,400,
placing him in the top 3 percent in the country, while
most competitors' ratings ranged between 600 and
1,500. One entire section consisted of players with
ratings above 2,000.
Thirteen-year-old Jordy Mont-Reynaud, who at
10 was the youngest master in U.S. history, said, "It
was an adult tournament, but everybody's welcome."
Richard Coepcke, president of the Northern Cali
fornia Chess Association, said the chess federation
likes to see a wide age distribution of chess players.
The voungest person at the tournament was 8 years
old. '
In fact, much of the Cardinal Chess Club's focus is
on young people. The club teaches third- through sev
enth-graders at the Boys' and Girls' Clubs of Menlo
Park and Redwood City how to play chess.
"This is a way to tie together the love of chess with
community service," said sophomore Irvin Tyan,

president and founder of the Cardinal Chess Club.
"One of the objectives of the club is to promote the
game not only on campus but oft'campus as well," he
said. "The way we do this is through the Boys' and
Girls' Club and tournaments." The club plans to
sponsor another tournament at Stanford spring
quarter.
When Tyan came to Stanford last year, he was sur
prised to find that Stanford did not have a chess club
and decided to create his own. Currently, the club has
around 30 members, ranging from beginner to mas
ter level.
"The club has several objectives," he said. "Among
them is to provide a space for those who love chess to
come and gather and to offer a fun learning experi
ence for those interested in chess."
The club offers tutorials with sophomore Adrian
Keatinge-Clay, who is master-rated. Keatinge-Clay,
a club member and tournament organizer, once
played 20 opponents simultaneously and won every
game.
In addition, the club plans to send four of its mem
bers, including Keatinge-Clay, to the Intercollegiate
Pan-American Chess Championships in December,
where they will compete against teams from schools
such as the University of Maryland and Harvard Uni
versity.
"Planning out this tournament and seeing what
a success it has become is one of the most rewarding
experiences I've had at Stanford," Keatinge-Clay
said.
The Cardinal Chess Club meets at 7:30 p.m. Mon
day in Building 550, Room 550-D.
