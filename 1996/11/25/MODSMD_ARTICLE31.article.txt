Women touched on topics such as the differ
ences between male and female faculty at Stan
ford and the stigma attached to the word "fem
inism" at an open forum at the Women's Cen
ter Friday.
A newly created forum at the Women's
Center has replaced the weekly meetings of
the Women's Collective, the umbrella orga
nization for women's groups on campus.
Classroom discrimination, grass-roots orga
nizing and the proposed changes to the Uni
versity's judicial process also came up for
discussion.
Most of the 10 people present agreed that
"feminism" had a negative connotation in the
minds of society.
"I think most women are afraid of being a
feminist," said community outreach intern
Shama Blaney, who admitted that she did not
consider herself a feminist.
"I associate it with color. I associate 'femi
nist' with white middle class," she said.

"There's two different dynamics with race and
class."
On the other hand, sophomore Colleen Baz
darich, the center's social program intern, said
she was proud to call herself a feminist.
"It never really occurred to me not to be a
feminist. Instead of not calling myself a femi
nist, I'd rather re-empower that word or find
something else like 'womanist,' " Bazdarich
said, in reference to Alice Walker's book,
"Meridian."
The idea for the weekly forum stemmed
from a Nov. 9 retreat attended by leaders of the
center and other women's organizations. One
of the topics addressed at the retreat was com
ing up with an idea for a project the group
would like to see added to the center.
Many people suggested holding a discussion
group that would meet on a regular basis, said
sophomore Jessica Lehman, who has been in
volved in the collective.
"We've just been having a lot of trouble with
the collective, people not wanting to come," she
said. "It sounded like people would rather have
a discussion group."

Recently, attendance at the collective meet
ings had dwindled down to two or three people.
Although the collective itself has "not really
dissolved," it will no longer be holding weekly
Monday meetings, Lehman said.
The Friday forums will be more of an alter
native to the collective, Lehman said. The first
forum, held last Friday, touched on many is
sues Stanford women face.
"Today we wanted to start with a real gen
eral theme — what it means to be a part of the
Women's Center, what it means to be a
women's supporter and how different that is
from being a feminist," said Bazdarich. Baz
darich helped Lehman organize the forum.
Eventually, different women's organiza
tions on campus will alternate in leading the
forum meetings.
"We're going to try and get different groups
to do it and choose their own topic," Lehman
said.
Representatives from the center empha
sized that the weekly forum will not be exclu
sively for women. Men are also invited to join in
the discussions.
