# Shendo leaving Stanford
## 
### Juan Pablo Toro 
Asst. Dean of Students Benny
Shendo is leaving the Stanford
community and vacating his post
as director of the American Indian
Program Office, which he has
headed for the past two years.
Shendo arrived at Stanford in
1994 after serving four years as
the director of the Native Ameri
can program at the University of
New Mexico's College of Engineer-

ing. He cited personal reasons for leaving the Farm
and returning to his native state of New Mexico.
"Benny has made a very significant and positive
contribution to the American Indian Program in
his short time he has been here," Dean of Students
Marc Wais said. "He has established Stanford as a
national leader in higher education for the Native
American Indian community. He will be missed,
and we wish him the best of luck."
Shendo, a member of Jemez Pueblo in north
ern New Mexico, began working to further the
causes of Native Americans after obtaining a
business degree from the University of Colorado-

Boulder in 1987.
"My experience made me realize that I could use
my education not only as a tool to better myself but
also my family and the community I come from —
which is my tribe — and also the Indian communi
ty at large," Shendo said.
Native Americans make up less than 1 percent
of college enrollment. "Many of our young people
don't have the opportunity to educate themselves,"
he said. "Education is not just good for a job. It is
necessary for the survival of our Indian peoples."
As director of the American Indian Program,
Shendo facilitated Native American students'
transition to Stanford, offering them both academ
ic and social support and trying to provide them
with a welcoming environment.
"He's veiy energetic," said Denni Woodward,
assistant director of the program. "He has a special
skill for long-term planning, a great vision for both
this community and others across the country."
Students were also thankful for Shendo's work.
"I think he's done a lot for the community," said
freshman Theresa Downey. "He's a Pueblo; he's
from the same reservation I am. Just knowing he


Shendo
was here made me come to Stan
ford."
Downey said that Shendo's
good humor and willingness to help
others attracted him to students.
"When things got hectic, he would
make me laugh," she added.
Shendo said Stanford has long
played a leading role in Native
American issues. He noted that in
1972, under University President
Richard Lyman, Stanford discon
tinued the use of the Indian as its
mascot.
"When people begin to use these
images, they don't realize that they
are dehumanizing a race of peo
ple," Shendo said. He said he is glad
that Stanford will continue to build
and expand on the programs it has
established for Native Americans
but added that "even though the
external perception of Stanford's

commitment is strong, there is still
a lot of work to be done."
Shendo also noted that Stanford
is ranked along with Dartmouth
College as one of two of the most
successful institutions in the re
cruitment and retention of Native
American students, according to a
1994 article, "Minorities in Higher
Education," from the journal of the
American Council on Education.
Shendo said he was returning
home to Jemez Pueblo to be closer
to his family and oversee the educa
tion of his daughter, Eileen, 13, and
his son, Benjamin, 7. He said he
may serve as a volunteer at his chil
dren's school and eventually plans
to return to the University of New
Mexico.
The search for a new director for
the American Indian Program has
not yet begun, said Wais.
"It is a critical position within
student affairs at the University,
and we will move as quickly and ju
diciously as possible to find the very
best person available," Wais said.
