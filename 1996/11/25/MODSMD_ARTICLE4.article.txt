# Shendo leaving Stanford
## 
### Juan Pablo Toro 
Asst. Dean of Students Benny
Shendo is leaving the Stanford
community and vacating his post
as director of the American Indian
Program Office, which he has
headed for the past two years.
Shendo arrived at Stanford in
1994 after serving four years as
the director of the Native Ameri
can program at the University of
New Mexico's College of Engineer-

ing. He cited personal reasons for leaving the Farm
and returning to his native state of New Mexico.
"Benny has made a very significant and positive
contribution to the American Indian Program in
his short time he has been here," Dean of Students
Marc Wais said. "He has established Stanford as a
national leader in higher education for the Native
American Indian community. He will be missed,
and we wish him the best of luck."
Shendo, a member of Jemez Pueblo in north
ern New Mexico, began working to further the
causes of Native Americans after obtaining a
business degree from the University of Colorado-

Boulder in 1987.
"My experience made me realize that I could use
my education not only as a tool to better myself but
also my family and the community I come from —
which is my tribe — and also the Indian communi
ty at large," Shendo said.
Native Americans make up less than 1 percent
of college enrollment. "Many of our young people
don't have the opportunity to educate themselves,"
he said. "Education is not just good for a job. It is
necessary for the survival of our Indian peoples."
As director of the American Indian Program,
Shendo facilitated Native American students'
transition to Stanford, offering them both academ
ic and social support and trying to provide them
with a welcoming environment.
"He's veiy energetic," said Denni Woodward,
assistant director of the program. "He has a special
skill for long-term planning, a great vision for both
this community and others across the country."
Students were also thankful for Shendo's work.
"I think he's done a lot for the community," said
freshman Theresa Downey. "He's a Pueblo; he's
from the same reservation I am. Just knowing he
