# Leaders of campus groups undecided on burden of proof
## Judicial changes discussed 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Leaders of campus groups and ethnic centers say
they need more time before committing to a stance on
proposed changes to Stanford's judicial system.
In an effort to solicit feedback on the proposed
changes, ASSU President Bill Shen met with student
groups from across campus last week.
The changes, outlined in the Committee of 15's rec
ommendations for changes that would be incorporated
into a new Legislative and Judicial Charter, would give
more responsibility to students in deciding disciplinary
cases involving the Honor Code and the Fundamental
Standard.
At the heart of Shen's meetings, however, was the
issue of the burden of proof, the level of "guilt " a stu
dent must exhibit in order to be convicted. The burden
of proof currently stands as "beyond a reasonable
doubt," the same standard used in criminal trials in the
United States.
Shen, who has repeatedly maintained that this high
standard must be kept, said he wanted to use these
meetings as a way of canvassing student opinion before
the ASSU Senate votes on the burden of proof issue
early next quarter.

In the senate, there has been talk of
lowering the burden of proof to "clear
and convincing evidence," a condition
which could convict a student whose
guilt was subject to some level of
doubt.
Shen takes issue with this "quan
tification of guilt," claiming that this
level could put innocent students in
danger of being wrongly convicted of
cheating or academic dishonesty, two

violations of the Honor Code.
While Shen would be able to veto any decision the
senate could make, he said that this would be an unfor
tunate way to resolve such a significant debate.
"I would not like to see this battle won this way, with
a veto," Shen said. "This issue should be determined ei
ther through a popular vote or, in this case, through a
vote of student representatives."
To better understand student opinions on the mat
ter, Shen dropped in on meetings of the Women's Cen
ter, the Interfraternity Council and the Intersorority
Council and invited the heads of the campus ethnic
centers to his office throughout last week.
