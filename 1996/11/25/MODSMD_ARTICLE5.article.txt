# Leaders of campus groups undecided on burden of proof
## Judicial changes discussed 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Leaders of campus groups and ethnic centers say
they need more time before committing to a stance on
proposed changes to Stanford's judicial system.
In an effort to solicit feedback on the proposed
changes, ASSU President Bill Shen met with student
groups from across campus last week.
The changes, outlined in the Committee of 15's rec
ommendations for changes that would be incorporated
into a new Legislative and Judicial Charter, would give
more responsibility to students in deciding disciplinary
cases involving the Honor Code and the Fundamental
Standard.
At the heart of Shen's meetings, however, was the
issue of the burden of proof, the level of "guilt " a stu
dent must exhibit in order to be convicted. The burden
of proof currently stands as "beyond a reasonable
doubt," the same standard used in criminal trials in the
United States.
Shen, who has repeatedly maintained that this high
standard must be kept, said he wanted to use these
meetings as a way of canvassing student opinion before
the ASSU Senate votes on the burden of proof issue
early next quarter.

In the senate, there has been talk of
lowering the burden of proof to "clear
and convincing evidence," a condition
which could convict a student whose
guilt was subject to some level of
doubt.
Shen takes issue with this "quan
tification of guilt," claiming that this
level could put innocent students in
danger of being wrongly convicted of
cheating or academic dishonesty, two

violations of the Honor Code.
While Shen would be able to veto any decision the
senate could make, he said that this would be an unfor
tunate way to resolve such a significant debate.
"I would not like to see this battle won this way, with
a veto," Shen said. "This issue should be determined ei
ther through a popular vote or, in this case, through a
vote of student representatives."
To better understand student opinions on the mat
ter, Shen dropped in on meetings of the Women's Cen
ter, the Interfraternity Council and the Intersorority
Council and invited the heads of the campus ethnic
centers to his office throughout last week.

Although Shen informed the
groups of the new changes and ex
plained why he felt the high burden
of proof should be retained, many of
the groups felt the issue was too
complex for them to offer an official

position just yet.
Shama Blaney, community out
reach intern at the Women's Cen
ter, and senior Craig Thomas, pres
ident of the IFC, said their respec
tive groups still need more time to
review the literature on the judicial
process before lending support to ei
ther "burden of proof' camp.
Senior Seth Yoskowitz, presi
dent of the Jewish Student Associa

tion, spoke with other members of
his organization, yet did not come to
the "Jewish opinion" on this mat
ter. He said he personally supports
the "beyond a reasonable doubt"
clause.
"My gut feeling is that the bur
den of proef be kept at where it is,"
Yoskowitz said. "If somebody who
is innocent is wrongly convicted of a
violation of the Honor Code, it

would be a supreme tragedy."
Although Yoskowitz said he un
derstood the importance of this
issue, he added that student aware
ness of the judicial system in gener
al might be the most important goal
for and administration.
He said that educational pro
grams should start at Orientation
and continue throughout students'
stays at Stanford so they will always

be aware of how the Honor Code
could potentially affect them.
Senior Howard Loo, an ASSU
senator and member of the Com
mittee of 15, also conducted meet
ings last week with students in
dorm-based presentations to edu
cate students on the proposed judi
cial system.
However, he said he felt that the
changes, which include setting up

student panels to hear disciplinary
cases and streamlining the bureau
cratic process, are more important
in the long run than the burden-of
proof issue.
"If this issue derails the entire
system, it would be a travesty,"
said. "It's just mueh easier Tor stu~'
dent leaders to grab hold of this bur
den-of-proof issue than to discuss
all the proposed changes."
