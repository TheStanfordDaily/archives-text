The proposed Center for Clinical Science Re
search has won a favorable environmental re
view from Santa Clara County planners. Its con
struction is scheduled to begin late next year.
The new 229,000-square-foot medical lab,
which will be located near the Medical Center,
will enable physicians and scientists to come to
gether in one facility to search for cures for can
cer and immune and genetic disorders, said Di
rector of Community Relations Andy Coe. The
main focus of work done at the center will be to
find clinical applications for advances in basic re
search.

The area apportioned for the center's con
struction falls under the pre-approved bound
aries specified by Stanford's general use permit,
said Charles Carter, Santa Clara County's assis
tant director of community and environmental
planning.
The county's Office of Planning and Develop
ment conducted an environmental impact re
view on all possible expansions of the Stanford
campus, including the land that the building
would occupy, he added.
According to the report, the project will not
have any environmental impact beyond what
has already been approved for Stanford land,
said Coe.
The specific impacts of land development ex

amined include air quality, traffic control and or
ganism habitat. The center cleared a long check
list of specific environmental factors, said
Carter.
The center will house three interdisciplinaiy
centers, examining clinical immunology, human
gene therapy and oncology. All three represent
an "extraordinary new opportunity to develop a
new paradigm for bench-to-bedside technologi
cal transfer," said Medicine Prof. Gary Fath
man, director of the Center for Clinical Im
munology.
The four-story complex will house re
searchers working on "an exciting and innova
tive way to develop new therapeutic application
of basic research to patient care," he added.
