# ASSU operating at budget deficit
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
The ASSU's
annual audit, due
to be completed
by the first week
of December, will
show the organi
zation operating
with a budget
deficit for the sec
ond straight fiscal
year.

The deficit for
the year ending June 30, however,
will be substantially less than the
$120,000 shortfall experienced a
year ago, according to ASSU Fi
nancial Manager John Hall.
The ASSU derives all of its rev
enues from the profits of Stanford
Student Enterprises, a group of
student-run businesses that in
cludes the Stanford Store and Lec
ture Notes.

Until fiscal year 1995, the Uni
versity supplemented that income
with an operating allowance given
to the ASSU in exchange for the
services it provided for students.
The University and the ASSU,
however, agreed to a four-year
phase out of that practice in 1991
â€” the last year the ASSU operated
without a shortfall.
Hall and ASSU President Bill
Shen, however, contend that the
era of deficit spending is over. Hall
has made several changes that he
predicts will improve the associa
tion's financial fortunes.
"There was a time when we
were operating with a deficit, when
our revenues were not consistent
and when there were problems
with the business projects," Shen
said. "John Hall was hired to fix
that with the understanding to do
what it takes."
