# ASSU operating at budget deficit
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
The ASSU's
annual audit, due
to be completed
by the first week
of December, will
show the organi
zation operating
with a budget
deficit for the sec
ond straight fiscal
year.

The deficit for
the year ending June 30, however,
will be substantially less than the
$120,000 shortfall experienced a
year ago, according to ASSU Fi
nancial Manager John Hall.
The ASSU derives all of its rev
enues from the profits of Stanford
Student Enterprises, a group of
student-run businesses that in
cludes the Stanford Store and Lec
ture Notes.

Until fiscal year 1995, the Uni
versity supplemented that income
with an operating allowance given
to the ASSU in exchange for the
services it provided for students.
The University and the ASSU,
however, agreed to a four-year
phase out of that practice in 1991
— the last year the ASSU operated
without a shortfall.
Hall and ASSU President Bill
Shen, however, contend that the
era of deficit spending is over. Hall
has made several changes that he
predicts will improve the associa
tion's financial fortunes.
"There was a time when we
were operating with a deficit, when
our revenues were not consistent
and when there were problems
with the business projects," Shen
said. "John Hall was hired to fix
that with the understanding to do
what it takes."


Hall
"[The senate and IJ have main
tained a very hands-off attitude,"
Shen said. "We hired John because
of his expertise, and he has hired
people because of their expertise.
We have stood back and let them
make money."
Hall has endeavored to fulfill
that charge.
"When I was hired, my job was
to bring the operations back to bud
get," Hall said.
The first change Hall undertook
was to restructure the endowment.
The ASSU maintains a multi
million-dollar investment portfolio
including its past budget surpluses
and the deposits and reserves of all

on-campus student groups. The
ASSU collects the interest from
those funds to offset the cost of the
banking service.
Upon becoming financial man
ager, Hall hired students to evalu
ate and reorganized those invest
ments.
Second, the ASSU expanded its
business income, in part by acquir
ing the Stanford Directory from the
University in 1995 in exchange for
assuming the unrelated business
income tax liability associated with
it. The project, according to Hall,
has been very profitable.
Several other initiatives have
been aimed at reducing operating
expenses, Hall said.
"Our major project was to con
solidate our retail operations into
one space to sell lecture notes and
T-shirts and group discounts and

Flicks passes, and that's cut down a
lot of our operating expenses," he
added, referring to the Stanford
Store that opened last week on
Tresidder Union's first floor.
Finally, Hall said, he set up a
new program to increase the reten
tion of staff members with previous
experience working on ASSU busi
ness projects.
"The fundamental problem that
ASSU businesses have always had
has been retaining people who have
a clue about how to run a busi
ness," he said. "In previous years,
the income of the various projects
fluctuated a great deal based en
tirely upon the motivation of the
project manager."
To combat the problem, Hall
began a business intern program to
introduce freshmen and inexperi
enced upperclassmen to running a

business.
"We've already seen remarkable
improvement in the reliability of
income across the projects," Hall
said. "For the first time in five
years all projects will come in at or
above budget."
Although Hall's efforts have
made significant progress, he ex
pects another shortfall this year, al
though he hopes to eliminate the
deficit by 1997.
Despite the potential of a deficit,
Shen — who has recently faced
questions regarding the spending
habits of his office — reasserted his
intent to spend his entire annual al
location.
"Obviously when that money is
budgeted, it's taken into account,"
he said. "Whether I spend the last
$500 or not doesn't make a differ
ence."
