BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) — President Clin
ton called on the world's longest reigning king
yesterday at a palace famed for its stable of royal
white elephants.
In this city of Buddhist temples and traffic
jams, the royal precinct sparkled with lights fill
ing the trees and strung along palace walls. A
mounted guard lined the street outside the presi
dential guest palace.
Clinton's visit came at a moment of political
change. Hard on the heels of Thai national elec
tions, Clinton arrived smack in the middle of a
transition from one prime minister to the next.
The president's solution: He planned to meet
with both.
Paying tribute to a loyal Asian ally, Clinton
was the first U.S. president to visit Thailand since
Richard Nixon in 1969.
"It's overdue," said Winston Lord, assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
affairs. Thailand is host for the largest joint mili
tary exercise in Asia that includes the United
States and provides port access to American war
ships.
Concluding a 12-day trip, Clinton arrived here
after a state visit to Australia and an Asian-Pacif
ic summit in the Philippines.
In his only public appearance, the president
was to receive an honorary degree today and
deliver a speech at the prestigious Chulalongkorn
University. He was to emphasize the war against
drugs, environmental issues and cooperation in
combating the spread of AIDS.
With U.S. assistance, Thai production of
opium has dropped sharply. However, much of
the opium produced in the "Golden Triangle" still
passes through Thailand on the way to the Unit
ed States.
A lot was packed into Clinton's 27-hour stay,
beginning with his courtesy call on King Bhumi
bol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit Kitiyakon at
Chitrlada Palace.
