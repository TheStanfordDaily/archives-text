## FDA head to resign Tobacco industry warrior to leave in praise 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - David Kessler,
the Food and Drug Administration com
missioner who waged war on the tobacco
industry and is alternately admired or
reviled as a fierce consumer protector,
announced yesterday he is leaving the
post.
Kessler said the Clinton administration
asked him to stay on Friday and again yes
terday, but he decided six years was
enough as head of the regulatory agency.
He will leave as soon as a successor is cho
sen, expected no sooner than late January.
"We took on some of the most difficult
regulatory challenges, and I think we've
made some progress," Kessler told The
Associated Press, listing as his top achieve
ments slashing the time FDA spends
approving new medicines, racing new
AIDS drugs to the market and giving con
sumers nutrition information on food
labels.
But Kessler's legacy will be the govern
ment crackdown on tobacco. He declared
nicotine an addictive drug used to hook
children on cigarettes and published, in
August, the nation's first regulations of
tobacco marketing.
"I hope the world is a little bit safer for
our kids because of what we've done,"
Kessler said.
President Clinton praised Kessler yes
terday as having "a tireless commitment to
better the lives of our citizens."
While many doctors admire Kessler for
also cracking the whip over medical and
food manufacturers, he is arguably the
FDA's most controversial chief.
Critics call him everything from "Eliot
Knessler" to "gestapo-like." He ignited an
outcry as soon he took office by seizing
thousands of gallons of orange juice labeled
"fresh" when they were made from con
centrate, and ended this year antagonizing
anti-abortionists by giving conditional
approval to the abortion pill RU-486.
Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, has accused

rDA of killing patients by not approving
new medicines fast enough and welcomed
Kessler's imminent departure as opening
the door for agency reform.
"I think it's a decision that was over
due," Barton said. Kessler defended the
status quo and "might have been an imped
iment'' to congressional action in January,
he added.
Kessler disputes Barton's charges —
and government documents show that
when he took office in 1990, the agency
spent a median of 25 months approving
each of 64 drugs, while in 1995 it spent
16.5 months on each of 82 new drugs.
Kessler vehemently opposes congres
sional plans that he says will deregulate
the FDA
Outside of Washington, "no one wants
to deregulate the safety of their foods or
the safety of their blood or the safety of the
drugs they 1 believe the American
people expect a degree of vigilance from
this agency," Kessler said.
The tobacco industry, whose stock
prices had risen on the rumor that Kessler
would leave, declined to comment yester
day. But Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C.,
called Kessler "quick to blame tobacco for
all the world's problems."
"Hopefully with Kessler gone, the FDA
will spend more time in the lab and less
time on the farm," Faircloth said.
Cigarette makers were big advancers in
yesterday's stock market rally. Philip Mor
ris Cos. rose $3.25 a share to $105.50;
Loews Corp. rose $3.62 1/2 to $94.62 1/2,
UST Inc. rose $1 to $32.87 1 2; and RJR
Nabisco rose 50 cents to $32.
Tobacco foes say Kessler's departure
doesn't signal the Clinton administration
is backing off its tobacco crackdown, which
will face its first court hearing in February.
"I don't think David Kessler would have
left now if he thought his initiative would
be undermined," said Matt Myers of the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
