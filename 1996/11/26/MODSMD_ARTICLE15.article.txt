# Simpson unable to explain bloody cut, stains in Bronco

SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP)
— Confronted with the toughest
physical evidence against him,
O.J. Simpson couldn't explain yes
terday how blood believed to be
the victims' got into his Bronco or
how he suffered hand cuts that
plaintiffs claim were fingernail
gouges from a death struggle.
Before testimony ended for the
day, Simpson said he never owned
Bruno Magli shoes like those he is
shown wearing in a 1993 picture
— and the kind that left bloody,
size 12 prints near the bodies of
his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson
and Ronald Goldman. Of the pic

ture, Simpson said: "It's a fraud."
Showing Simpson a close-up
photograph taken three days after
the slayings of a crescent-shaped
cut on his finger, attorney Daniel
Petrocelli charged: "It was a fin
gernail mark, wasn't it, sir?"
"I seriously doubt that," Simp
son replied.
"It was somebody's fingernails
ripping into your skin, wasn't it?"
Petrocelli asked.
Simpson suggested his then-5-
year-old son, Justin, could have
cut his finger while they were
"rassling" in the days after the
killings.

"Unless it was Justin's, I really
don't know," Simpson said with a
hint of exasperation.
"Are you saying it was your
son's fingernail?" the lawyer
asked.
"I'm not saying it was
Justin's."
Petrocelli, pacing sometimes
within inches of the witness, chal
lenged Simpson to explain virtual
ly every move he made during 86
minutes on the night of the June
12, 1994, slayings when his
whereabouts are unknown.
Simpson maintained he was
resting in bed or showering at the

time, and also said he was chip
ping golf balls and taking his dog
out for a walk during those unac
counted-for minutes.
Later, Petrocelli confronted
Simpson with the allegation he
took a polygraph test and scored a
minus 22, showing "extreme
deception."
Simpson, who denied in his
deposition ever taking a lie-detec
tor test, acknowledged under
questioning that he was hooked
up to a polygraph machine so he
could see how the device worked
before taking a test from police.
Police never made Simpson sub-

Mit to a lie-detector test.
Petrocelli clearly tried to get a
rise out of Simpson, but it didn't
work. Once, the attorney paced so
close to Simpson they were nearly
nose to nose. At another instant,
Petrocelli pointed a pen in Simp
son's face and demanded,
"Answer the question, sir!"
Petrocelli quizzed the defen
dant about blood, noting there
was blood in his Bronco, on a
driveway at his home and on a
kitchen counter. The defense has
said the Bronco blood was planted
by overzealous police.
Simpson said he remembered

seeing blood on his pmky finger
and on the counter before he left
for Chicago late the night of the
slayings.
"1 assumed at the time it was
my blood. I don't know. Like I
said, I didn't feel the cut," he said.
He said he had no idea why or
when he bled.
He recounted how a glass broke
in his Chicago hotel room and per
haps injured his hand. But he
couldn't remember how the glass
broke or when he was cut, sug
gesting it was perhaps when he
was "sweeping" broken pieces into
the sink.
