MORONI, Comoros Islands (AP) — Res
cue workers dragged a chunk of an Ethiopian
airplane fuselage onto the beach at low tide
yesterday and used electric saws to cut bodies
from the jet, which crashed when hijackers let
it run out of fuel.
Wearing masks against the smell of decay
ing flesh, the workers zipped bodies into dark
bags and hauled them to a makeshift morgue
set up in a former meat warehouse. Feet and
at least one head could be seen in the crush of
metal, wires and seating.
One of history's deadliest hijackings, Sat
urday's crash killed 127 of the 175 people on
board. At least 101 sets of remains have been
recovered, but authorities were having trou
ble identifying some of them.
At least one U.S. citizen was among the
dead. Leslianne Shedd, 28, was an officer with
the Foreign Service and had been headed to
Kenya to meet friends for Thanksgiving.
Among the missing was Ron Ferris, a mis
sionary doctor from Tennessee who according
to his father had given up "a six-figure salary

to help Africans for $800 a month."
Two men were arrested for the hijacking,
but officials said yesterday that they may be
innocent. The plane's co-pilot, Yonas
Mekuria, told police he did not recognize the
suspects as any of the three hijackers who had
refused to let the plane land to refuel.
If the two arrested men are determined to
have been passengers, it would mean all the
hijackers died, government spokesman
Dgouma Ibrahim said. The suspects could be
released as early as today.
In addition to the bodies being pulled from
the beached piece of fuselage, police said sev
eral more bodies were trapped in wreckage
still submerged a few hundreds yards off
Grand Comore, the largest of the three
Comoros Islands.
Ethiopian Airlines said yesterday that four
of the 52 people pulled alive from the wreck
age had died, raising the death toll to 127.
Survivors have been flown to hospitals across
the region. The airline did not give details of
the four who died.
