Next stop: hell
SEATTLE (AP) — John Orr is just thankful to be off the "train from hell" in time for
Thanksgiving.
Orr was among the 109 weary passengers who climbed off Amtrak No. 7 in Seattle on
Sunday night, nearly 12 hours late, after a 57-hour, mishap-filled trip from Chicago.
Orr, 60, of Kettle, Ky., boarded in Chicago on Friday for the trip to Seattle to spend
Thanksgiving with his grandson. Then the problems began.
First, police pulled someone off the train during a stop in Portage, Wis.; passengers
thought it was a drug bust but weren't sure. Then the train hit an abandoned car on the
tracks in Minnesota, causing a 90-minute delay.
Then an icy blizzard slowed the train, and engineers also had to deal with an equipment
malfunction. In Idaho, there was an 8 1/2-hour delay while crews cleared the tracks of a
derailed freight train. Even the food ran out, forcing a stop to take on some Kentucky
Fried Chicken in Spokane, Wash.
Amtrak officials didn't return a call seeking comment yesterday
GOP governors pledge moderation
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) — In a sharp contrast to their post-election summit two
years ago, Republicans yesterday outlined an "incrementalist" 1997 agenda of targeted
tax cuts, modest Medicaid reforms and cooperation with President Clinton.
GOP governors and congressional leaders also promised swift House and Senate action
on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. They said this month's elec
tions appeared to have provided the decisive votes for the measure that died by a single
Senate vote last year.
