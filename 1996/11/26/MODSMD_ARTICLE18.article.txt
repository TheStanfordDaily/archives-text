# At Einstein auction, it's all relative
## 'Love' letters garner twice as much as relativity manuscript 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - A collection
of letters from Albert Einstein that
show him as both a tender and cruel
husband sold at auction yesterday for
nearly $900,000, twice as much as a
manuscript on relativity, one of the
fundamental theories of the universe
"You will expect no affection from
me," he wrote to his first wife. Mileva
Marie, in 1914. "You must leave my
bedroom or study at once without
protesting when I ask you to."
That note, sold with two others for
$20,700, was one of more than 400
Einstein letters to family members
that, with the scientific manuscript.

were auctioned by Christie's.
Only 28 of the 116 lots offered
yesterday were sold, for a total of
$1.28 million, including commissions
of 10 percent to 15 percent. Presale
estimates valued each lot — any
where from one to 53 letters — at
$1,500 to $35,000, for a total of $2
million.
The highest price, $442,500 from
an anonymous bidder, was paid for
the 53 love letters Einstein wrote to
Marie after they met as students in
turn-of-the-century Switzerland.
Scholars believe Marie, herself a sci
entist, was a sounding board for the

theory of relativity that established
Einstein's genius.
In a poem from 1900, the 21-year
old physicist wrote, "While thinking
of his Dollie / His pillow catches fire."
But in the 1914 letter, written
when his wife and children were
about to join him in Berlin, he stipu
lated: "A. You will see to it (1) that
my clothes and linen are kept in
order, (2) that I am served three reg
ular meals a day in my room. B. You
will renounce all personal relations
with me, except when these are
required to keep up social appear
ances."


This photograph of Albert Einstein and his first wife Mileva Marie was part of the lot sold yesterday at Christie's
auction house in New York. Included with the photo were 43 love letters written to Marie by Einstein which detailed
their turbulent marriage.
