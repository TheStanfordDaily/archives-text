Academic research and
patient care must remain
top priorities in merger

THE HEALTH CARE debate
that rocked the nation three
years ago has now reached
Stanford University. The Stanford
Medical Center, finding it increas
ingly difficult to compete due to its
research and academic concentra
tion, will merge within the year
with its major California competi
tor: the University of California-
San Francisco Medical Center.
The main ingredient of the 1993
health care debate was cost. Here
at Stanford, we see this same con
cern reflected in the merger deci
sion. Backed by analysts from var
ious consulting firms, UCSF has
proven that the merger is fiscally
sound, and Stanford has done the
same with its own analysis. In fact,
top Stanford administrators say
we will be getting a great deal. But
will patients and students also get
a great deal?
So far, little has been said about
quality of care in a post-merger
Stanford Medical Center. While
the University claims its merger
will combine the administrative
echelons of both hospitals to sup
port quality of care, what new
changes will the staff that come
into direct contact with patients
experience?
If the University looks to its
contemporaries for guidance, then
expect major cuts in qualified care
givers. The unfortunate trend in
the health care business is to
introduce patient helpers that
have little formal training and cost
significantly less than, say, regis
tered nurses. This translates to a
lower quality of care and is unac
ceptable for any hospital, especial
ly an academic one.
Even academic research has
taken a back seat to the fiscal con
cerns of the University. Faculty
have very little idea what will hap
pen to resources. Indications are

that life within the Medical Center
will go on as normal since a new
company will have been created to
perform administrative tasks. But
will this new company be compet
ing for grants and federal funding
that will eventually be split up
between UCSF and Stanford? Or
will faculty at both institutions be
expected to compete against each
other for funding?
Academic cooperation is one of
the benefits that proponents of the
merger claim. Yet duplication of
research at both hospitals can't be
efficient for the new management
company. Which projects will be
consolidated, moved or even termi
nated?
The greatest asset of the School
of Medicine is teaching and this
cannot be compromised. The
nation depends on Stanford and
UCSF to produce the top physi
cians in the world and that perfor
mance must not be affected by this
merger. Teaching must be pre
served. Most surprising of all is
that the Faculty Senate has yet to
analyze the merger's impact on
the Medical School's research and
teaching ability. The senate needs
to address this issue soon, to head
off anxiety.
This merger is still not out of the
woods. Lawsuits and possible
action from Attorney General Dan
Lungren, a likely 1998 GOP guber
natorial candidate, could threaten
the merger on the grounds of viola
tion of public trust. Unions, too,
are fighting the merger in order to
maintain their state employee ben
efits and are putting money into an
advertising campaign that is
already winning results.
If the merger is to truly succeed,
not just in the accounting books
but also in the preservation of both
hospitals' academic and quality of
care standings, close attention
needs to be paid to the purpose of
the institutions. Stanford needs to
have these answers before it com
mits itself any further. Students,
future students, staff and faculty
deserve these answers now.
