# Tuition remission plan faces change
## 
### David Stein Staff writer 
As professors begin to calculate
their budgets for next year, the
new plan to determine how gradu
ate students will receive their tu
ition money has once again become
a topic of conversation.
The change applies only to grad
uate students whose work is being
funded by federal research grants.
Principal investigators — facul
ty members who lead research pro
jects involving graduate students
— may actually experience some
net financial gain when the new
system takes effect next Septem
ber.
Under the University's plan,
graduate students' tuition, which
used to be indirectly subsidized by

the government for federally fund
ed research projects, will now be
funded through a revision of the
University's billing system and
help by the provost and the dean of
the School of Medicine.
In a memo sent out last week,
Vice Provost and Dean for Re
search and Graduate Policy
Charles Kruger told faculty that
while the new system has basically
remained unchanged since its pro
posal in 1994, the exact dollar
amounts of the University's miti
gation have slightly changed.
The cost of the revised system to
the University would have been
$2.1 million. A new amount, taking
into account inflation and tuition
increases since then, has yet to be
determined, Kruger said.
According to Kruger, the num
ber of graduate students receiving
support and the amount of money
each student receives should still
be the same as before the change.
Currently, principal investiga
tors charge graduate students' tu
ition, as an indirect cost, to the
staff benefits pool, a collection of
funds used for such benefits as
health or dental insurance.
However, as part of a federal re
evaluation of how to deal with in
direct costs, the government will
no longer allow universities to en
gage in tuition remission next
year.

Hence, principal investigators
will now bill graduate students'
tuition as a direct charge to each
funding proposal, thus reducing
the amount put into the staff ben
efits pool.
Although the benefits pool will
be smaller, tuition can no longer
be taken from this pool, so under
certain circumstances, particular
investigators who do not have
many graduate student salaries to
take care of will benefit, Kruger
said.
These financial benefits may
translate to graduate student ben
efits with improvements in lab
equipment and other additional
research-based expenditures, he
added.
Currently, the University sub
sidizes 62 percent of tuition for
graduate students on research

projects, who usually take classes
half-time.
However, under the new plan,
40 percent of tuition will now be
billed as the direct cost (50 percent
at the Medical School) and the
other 22 (or 12) percent will be
funded through the Provost's Of
fice or by a subsidy provided by the
Medical School dean.
One change which the new sys
tem might create is an increased
number of graduate students de
claring terminal graduate regis
tration, or TGR, status, a condi
tion under which students do not
take any more classes and are
close to finishing their graduate
work, Kruger said.
David Bradfute, a second-year
law student, said he was con
cerned that the possibility of more
students declaring TGR might be

a result of tighter funding as a re
sult of the new system.
"If particular professors cannot
pick up the funding for their re
search projects, then departments
or faculty might feel more pres
sure to push graduate students
out the door," Bradfute said.
"This may mean that students
aren't given enough time to a com
plete a robust doctoral disserta
tion," Bradfute said. "Alternative
ly, it could mean that graduate
students are pressured to leave
the University without a degree
through no fault of their own."
On the other hand, Kruger sees
no detrimental effects in the new
plan.
"Stanford will still be in a very
good position in terms of research
and graduate education," Kruger
said.
