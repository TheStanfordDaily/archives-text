## Stanford lacks religous spirit 
### 
IT SEEMS LIKE only yesterday. I had
to choose a college. It was down to
Georgetown University and Stanford.
Averse to cold, I'd ruled out the East and
chose Stanford: the perfect school.
Or so I thought.
Religious spirituality and Stanford is a
bad marriage.
Anti-religious dialogue highlighted my
maiden voyage on the Farm. The possibili
ty of religious growth in students is com
pletely overlooked by Residential Educa
tion. How often do you go to Mass or tem
ple with your resident fellow or assistant?
As if.
Even engaging in religious discussion is
an obstacle. On numerous occasions, I sat
down to engage in a discussion on the
divine, and the result was an empty table.
Perhaps they had no opinion on religion.
Maybe they didn't want to think about
such a pressing issue. Had I wanted to talk
about gay rights or returning grapes to the
dining halls, everyone would be aching to
contribute their two cents. Yet, this
unwillingness to talk about religion made
little sense to me.
If you have not done so already, your
dorm will have the great Christmas tree
debate. My freshman dorm certainly did.
Bitterly divided, a few students in the
dorm suggested erecting a Christmas tree
in the lounge to celebrate the holiday sea
son. Harmless, right?
Wrong!
"I'm offended at the veiy idea of having
a Christmas tree in the dorm," heralded
one of my dormmates. "I feel put upon

with this whole idea of Christmas." Anoth
er one of my dormmates claimed that even
seeing the tree take up public space in the
dorm would "arouse feelings of discom
fort" for him.
What was this garbage? A group of
grown-ass people arguing over a Christ
mas tree! How can one be offended by a
Christmas tree? Hell, I don't like certain
art. I think Gustav Klimt seems to be a
popular artist taking up too much public
space in the dorms — I can easily say I'm
"offended" by his portrayal of women as
merely sensual creatures. Yet do you hear
me cry: "Oh, I'm offended!"
God forbid anyone ever be offended!
Lord knows that's incompatible with this
University.
As long as there is religion, people will
be offended. It doesn't stop at Christmas
trees. Students are bothered by the cross
atop Memorial Church — hell, some stu
dents even are opposed to having a Memo
rial Church. More than just a challenge to
theism is being made in these instances.
I would argue that Stanford is making
an attempt at atheism for its student body.
Consider the teaching at Stanford.
Will all the theist professors step forth?
I vividly remember one of my professors
freshman year not merely quoting Marx
and Nietzsche's philosophies of religion,
but declaring them as the truth: "We cre
ated God in our image and not the other
way around." Another professor called all
religion a "myth!"
I knew not to expect these guy at Uni
versity public worship on Sunday.

But, then again, should I expect any
one?
How often do you see University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper or Provost Con
doleezza Rice at University worship in
Memorial Church? What about Dean of
Students Marc Wais or Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education Ram6n Saldf
var? How often do you see Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Mary Edmonds? What
about your professors or your adviser?
Perhaps that's the problem.
What that says is one of two things:
Either the nondenominational spirit of
this University is not serious enough, or
those people running this school aren't
serious themselves about religion. In
either case, the seriousness of theism and
the religious integrity of this schftol is
placed in question.
The purpose of the University is educa
tion. Religious spiritualism is not merely a
valuable part of this education; it is an
integral component! Unfortunately, the
present status of religion on this campus
suggests an impoverished religious spiritu
alism nicely masked by the sleek
"Approaching Stanford" guide.
Perhaps Georgetown would have been
different.
