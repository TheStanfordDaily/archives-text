Bah a 7 students add to Memorial Church debate

THE INCREASING interest that
The Daily appears to be taking in
religious and spiritual issues at
Stanford is most commendable. After
all, a society which has been undergoing
for the last century and half a series of
industrial, scientific and technological
revolutions with no end in sight and
which has consequently lost its tradi
tional bearings is probably more in need
than any of readdressing and reassess
ing such fundamental questions as the
finality of human life, the foundations of
ethics or the human yearning for tran
scendence and connectedness.
The contribution of the dean and
associate deans of religious life at Stan
ford to the debate on Memorial Church
is carefully argued and stands in no need
of defense.
As members of the Baha'i Associa
tion, and on its behalf, however, we feel
compelled to share with you a few facts
as seen from the perspective of a minori
ty religious group on this campus.
• The dean of religious life and the
staff of Memorial Church have exerted
every effort to ensure that the voice of
our members is heard in the various
meetings, deliberations and observances
which they organize. As far as we can
see, this is a matter of constant and con
sistent policy, not of special treatment.

Moreover, at least in the case of our
group, such an attitude cannot be
attributed to an identity of views and
beliefs: a majority (but not the totality)
of our members belong to the Baha'i
faith, which is an independent religion
and which, while sharing many common
ethical principles with Christianity (and
other world religions), has teachings and
ordinances that are clearly distinct from
those of any other community of belief.
• Over the years, we have been wit
ness to the commitment of Memorial
Church to, and its consistent efforts for,
the creation of a multifaith center on
this campus. Such a center would offer
an inviting and inclusive space of wor
ship and reflection to all. The vision that
animates this undertaking, it must be
stressed, goes beyond the mere acknowl
edgment of or respect for diversity: It
calls for serious dialogue and common
reflection.
• As a religious group, we have held
many gatherings in Memorial Church.
Although Baha'is do not place any
images in their houses of worship, we
feel welcome in this beautiful space
which, for very understandable histori
cal reasons, is laden with Christian sym
bols. We recognize that we might be
something of an exception in this
regard: We believe in the oneness of

world religions and the fundamental
unity of their purpose. But we also
understand that some religious commu
nities find it inappropriate or impossible
to hold their observances in such a place,
and we believe that the solution resides
in the creation of a multifaith center,
responding to the needs and concerns of
all.
• We feel that the presence of a Univer
sity-sponsored religious institution repre
sents a distinctive feature and a clear
advantage. It reflects the recognition,
both by the founders and by the adminis
trators of this University, of the funda
mental importance of and inescapable
need for the spiritual development of
Stanford students in parallel to their aca
demic and athletic pursuits. In this con
nection, should the presence of a church
with a capacity of 1,300 and open to all be
found that incongruous on a campus
which boasts a stadium seating 85,000?
And if the University invests in building
and maintaining physical structures,
shouldn't it also invest in building bridges
between people and in maintaining a
sense of togetherness through the efforts
of an institution like Memorial Church?
• We do not perceive the religious
affiliation of the dean of religious life to
be an issue. Contrary to popular belief,
strong commitment to a certain world

view or approach to truth is not at all
antithetical to genuine respect for oth
ers. As a matter of fact, it is precisely to
the degree that our beliefs are well-rea
soned and well-grounded that we can
feel secure enough to be truly open to
and respectful of other approaches. The
main requirement for success in a posi
tion such as that of the dean of religious
life is a fundamental respect for the
diversity of approaches to religious
truth. Our dealings with Dean Robert
Gregg bring us to believe that his
actions indeed reflect and exemplify
such an attitude.
With our thanks to The Daily, and
with the hope that it will open more and
more often its columns to discussions of
such essential issues as ethics and spiri
tuality.
