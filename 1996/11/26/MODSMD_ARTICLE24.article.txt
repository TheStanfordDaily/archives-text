# Cheers demoralizing women had no place at Big Game celebration
## 
### 
I HAVE JUST returned from my first
Big Game and have realized what a
phenomenal experience it was. I
have an immense amount of respect for

the Band, the fabulous football team and
all who put so much effort into making
the whipping of the Weenies a huge suc
cess.
But, this is not the subject of my
concern. I was particularly disturbed by
two of the cheers that were screamed
near the end of the game. The first was,
as I recall, was "Cal Bears wear skirts"
and the second, "Cal's our bitch." I
must remind everyone who partook in

these cheers that those phrases are
completely unacceptable. I have a hard
time understanding why, in 1996 at
Stanford University (or anytime or any
where for that matter), we believe these
statement to be admissible. It seems
obvious that the message we are send
ing, still, is that women are inferior in
some way. Since Cal is our rival (there
fore clearly inferior) and Cal Bears sup
posedly "wear skirts" and many women

wear skirts, shall we assume that the
cheer implies that women are inferior?
Am I incorrect, or does that phrase have
a similar effect as the statement, "You
throw like a girl"? I hope I need not
comment on the second, even more
unsuitable, cheer. Let's get real; we're
not sending a very good message to any
observers of our actions.
