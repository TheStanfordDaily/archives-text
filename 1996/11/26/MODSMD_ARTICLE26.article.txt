# Socially responsible bank selected by SEAS for potential investment
## 
### Arthur Hu 
As part of the campaign to convince the Univer
sity to establish a socially responsible endowment,
Students for Environmental Action at Stanford has
selected what it sees as a likely candidate to qualify
for the investment portfolio.
SEAS members are trying to establish a link be
tween the University and the Community Bank of
the Bay, which is based in Oakland. Although state
chartered and commercial, the bank also is known
as a "community development" bank.
ASSU Vice President Nick Thompson, a mem
ber of SEAS, recently suggested the idea of a social
ly responsible endowment â€” one separate from the
regular University endowment that would invest in
companies deemed to be "socially responsible."
Alumni would have the option of donating to this
investment fund.
The bank's brochure says its "mission is to pro
mote economic prosperity and self-reliance in low
and moderate-income areas while operating a safe
and profitable bank."
The theory behind the bank and others like it is
keep the flow of capital within a community, ex
plained the bank's Asst. Vice President of Market
ing Philip Palmer at a SEAS meeting last night.
He said that what often happens is that capital
flows out of a low-income region, where there are
generally fewer banks, to a higher-income region.
Then, indirectly, the poor essentially subsidize de
velopment in richer neighborhoods.
In addition, the bank has a nonprofit affiliate
called Local Economic Assistance Program, which
serves as financial sponsor for the organizing of the
bank and also works with the local businesses

which take out loans from the bank to ensure their
quality development, a kind of technical support
not offered by standard commercial banks.
Palmer said, "The bank wants to reverse this
cycle by getting capital from responsible compa
nies, and reinvesting it in low- and moderate-in
come communities."
The bank can do this by "serving a narrowly de
fined area" and by only making loans which will
benefit the community, such as small-business
loans and creating affordable rental-housing, he
said.
One of the bank's primary service areas is East
Palo Alto. Both SEAS members and Palmer feel
that the University's investment in the bank would
increase social responsibility in the University's in
vestment portfolio as well as have a positive effect
on the neighboring community of East Palo Alto.
Palmer said investment in the bank would be
painless for the University because the bank is in
sured and also offers an interest rate "that is the av
erage of the rates offered by Wells Fargo and Bank
of America," two industry leaders.
Among the ways which SEAS is discussing to en
courage investment in the bank include: student in
vestment, either by individuals or student groups,
trying to establish a link between the Stanford Fed
eral Credit Union and the bank, waging a public
awareness campaign to let the citizens in East Palo
Alto know about the bank and how the bank can
help them, and working with the Alumni Associa
tion.
SEAS will begin to implement its ideas and look
ing into available options when Stanford students
return for the winter quarter, junior Kelly Naylor
said at the meeting.
