# Joint venture opportunities with China more available

Opportunities for joint business ventures between
American and Chinese companies are increasing, Dean
of Students Marc Wais and guest speaker Jay Rothstein
said at a forum at the Graduate School of Business yes
terday.
About 50 people, primarily Business School stu
dents, attended the presentation, which was introduced
by Jim Thompson, head of the Global Management Pro
ject at the Business School.
Wais briefly shared some of his impressions from his
first trip to China this summer. He became involved in
Chinese business opportunities when Rothstein, who
attended junior high school with Wais, invited him on
the trip.
Wais said his credentials — a Harvard doctorate and
his position as Stanford's dean of students — were im
portant factors to his acceptance by the Chinese busi
ness world.
The focus of the trip was to evaluate hundreds of
state-operated companies in China add determine
which might be salvageable by being included in joint
ventures with American companies. Wais said the trip
was particularly interesting because the companies
ranged from "petroleum to theme restaurants... to os
triches."
Wais said he was impressed by the level of modernity
and business activity in China. "I was struck by the
China that I saw as opposed to the China I'd been led to
believe existed."
He said that the climate in China is "ripe for change."
According to Wais, the Chinese government endorses
change and welcomes foreign investors.
After speaking for about 10 minutes, Wais turned
over the floor to Rothstein, president of China Venture
Advisors, who lectures around the country about in
vestment opportunities in China.

Rothstein began by speaking about the importance
of developing a long-term relationship with Chinese
business partners. Both Rothstein and Wais empha
sized how polite everyone in China is, to the point
where it is difficult to determine sincerity.
Rothstein discussed three different ways of invest
ment in China: the joint venture, the wholly foreign
owned enterprise and the representative office.
The main focus of his speech, however, was on is
sues that are important to creating a joint venture —
an agreement between a Chinese factory and a foreign
company to do business for the benefit of both.
Originally this system was set up to benefit China;
now, however, it is clear that the foreign companies
benefit as well, Rothstein said. Of the 3,500 joint
ventures with Chinese companies since 1979, more
than 70 percent showed a profit after four years, he
added.
Rothstein discussed the differences in cultural, lo
gistical, legal and political attitudes between the Unit
ed States and China. He gave examples of the ways
these factors hinder business enterprises between the
two countries. If a small business pays its phone bill
late, he said, they "literally cut the wires."
Political uncertainty is a major factor in Chinese
and American business relationships, Rothstein said.
Human rights issues also deter some companies,
such as Levi Strauss, from investing in China. Some
companies have refused to do business in China until
human rights abuses end.
Rothstein said this reflects the differing attitude
about progress in the United States and China.
"China says this: 'With prosperity comes change.'
America says: 'You give us change, we'll give you pros
perity.' "
The presentation was sponsored by the Global Man
agement Program, which offers opportunities in inter
national business.
