## Big Row Women beat Cal, men take second 
### Blake Thompson 
The men's and women's crew
teams completed a successful fall
season with the Big Row regatta in
San Mateo last weekend. The
women placed first in both the var
sity and junior varsity divisions,
and the men placed second in both
divisions.
The women's team faced its
challenge from a much-improved
California team. The Card had
defeated the Bears earlier this sea
son by only 5 seconds and had
hoped to widen that distance this
weekend. But the Bears proved to
be tough once again and did not let
the Card pull away.
The varsity women finished
only 4 seconds ahead of Cal on
Sunday, and this was only after a
furious finish by the Card. The
Stanford and Cal boats were neck
and neck the entire race. Cal in fact
pulled even with about 40 strokes
to go before the Cardinal pulled
away to defeat the Bears for the
second time this year.
"They were moving on us at
every turn," said co-captain Bess
Kennedy. "But on every straight
away we would move up on them."
The fact that the Golden Bears
pulled away on the curves could be

attributed to a difference in tactics,
Kennedy said. Stanford relied
mostly on its rowers to turn the
boat, while Cal relied more on its
rudder. That strategic decision
seemed to pay off for the Bears,
although the Card demonstrated
its superiority on the water at the
race's end.
The Card also stayed with a
lower stroke rate than the Bears,
another strategic decision. A high
er stroke rate could have possibly
pushed the Cardinal further away
from the Bears, but the team mem
bers usually don't push themselves
to the higher stroke rate until the
more important spring season.
But, regardless of the strategy,
the women continued to show
their dominance over Cal, as this
year was the fourth year in a row
the Card has defeated Cal at home.
The men did not meet with
quite the same success. Cal defeat
ed the Card in the open varsity
eight race and UC-Davis defeated
the Stanford junior varsity by a
second in the junior varsity divi
sion.
The varsity men stayed right
with the Bears throughout the
first half of the race but were
