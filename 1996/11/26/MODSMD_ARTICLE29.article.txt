# Volleyball hosts 23rd-ranked Titans
## 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The second ranked Stanford
women's volleyball team (25-2)
will face one last challenge before
the start of the NCAA tournament
next week.
The Cardinal will host No. 23
Oral Roberts (26-3) tonight in
Maples Pavilion and attempt to
extend its 45-match home winning
streak. The Stanford women have
not lost a match at home in more
than three years.
Oral Roberts brings a talented
squad to the Farm, one composed
of several foreign players who are
ready to give the Card quite a chal
lenge in the 7 p.m. match. Last
year, the Titans drew a No. 10-seed
into the NCAA West Region but
advanced all the way to the region
al final, losing at Stanford 15-4, 15-
7, 15-4.

"Every year we try and schedule
a match for Thanksgiving week,"
Stanford coach Don Shaw said.
"They were the best team avail
able, and they were willing to
come" to Stanford.
Against Oral Roberts, Stanford
will once again rely upon its two
big guns — outside hitters Kristin
Folkl, a junior, and freshman sen
sation Kerri Walsh. Senior middle
blocker Eileen Murfee is quietly
racking up impressive numbers,
while junior setter Lisa Sharpley
has flawlessly run the Stanford
attack. All in all, that adds up to
lots of weapons.
Freshman outside hitter Jaimi
Gregory has also provided a spark
for the Card with her hitting, acro
batic digs and on-court enthusi
asm. Junior middle blocker Bar
bara Ifejika has given Stanford a
consistent effort every night and
must play an integral role in any
Cardinal postseason run.

Stanford will look forward to
some tougher competition in order
to tune up for the NCAA tourna
ment. The Cardinal squad has not
lost a match since Oct. 26 at Wash
ington State.
Furthermore, Stanford has not
dropped a game in more than three

weeks since the opening game
against then-No. 1 Hawaii. Since
that time the Card has won '20 con
secutive games.
"Oral Roberts starts five Brazil
ians who can play," Shaw said.
"They have won a lot of matches
and will be there in the NCAAs."
