TUCSON, Ariz. — After a successful season that
witnessed the capturing of both the Pacific 10 Con
ference and District VIII titles, the men's and
women's cross country squads yesterday earned the
one award which had always eluded them: the
NCAA championship.
The Cardinal teams, both ranked second in the
nation heading into the NCAA meet, beat the field
of 22 teams to capture the first set of men's and
women's cross country national championships in
school history
"They had tremendous confidence," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "It took a tremendous amount
of foresight to see both teams on the podium.
"Our goal was not necessarily to win both races.
We discussed our chances of winning it, and we de
cided that the only way was to stick our noses in it.
We didn't run a conservative race."
The men easily upset defending champion and
top-ranked Arkansas. The Cardinal finished with
46 points, 28 ahead of the Ra/orbacks. Pac-10 rival
Oregon finished third with 140 points.
"We've got to thank Coach for getting us pre
pared," said junior Nathan Nutter. "He got the
whole team prepared mentally. He had confidence
in us and I think he knew that we could do this. He
never over hyped us.
"This has been our goal since the beginning of
the season."
Individually, Arkansas senior Godfrey Sia
musiye won his 20th consecutive collegiate race to
capture his second straight NCAA title, finishing
the 10,000-meter course in a time of 29 minutes, 49
seconds.
