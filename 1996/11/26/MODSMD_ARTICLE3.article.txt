# Cross country grabs NCAA titles
## Men upset Arkansas, cruise to 28-point win 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. — After a successful season that
witnessed the capturing of both the Pacific 10 Con
ference and District VIII titles, the men's and
women's cross country squads yesterday earned the
one award which had always eluded them: the
NCAA championship.
The Cardinal teams, both ranked second in the
nation heading into the NCAA meet, beat the field
of 22 teams to capture the first set of men's and
women's cross country national championships in
school history
"They had tremendous confidence," said head
coach Vin Lananna. "It took a tremendous amount
of foresight to see both teams on the podium.
"Our goal was not necessarily to win both races.
We discussed our chances of winning it, and we de
cided that the only way was to stick our noses in it.
We didn't run a conservative race."
The men easily upset defending champion and
top-ranked Arkansas. The Cardinal finished with
46 points, 28 ahead of the Ra/orbacks. Pac-10 rival
Oregon finished third with 140 points.
"We've got to thank Coach for getting us pre
pared," said junior Nathan Nutter. "He got the
whole team prepared mentally. He had confidence
in us and I think he knew that we could do this. He
never over hyped us.
"This has been our goal since the beginning of
the season."
Individually, Arkansas senior Godfrey Sia
musiye won his 20th consecutive collegiate race to
capture his second straight NCAA title, finishing
the 10,000-meter course in a time of 29 minutes, 49
seconds.

musiye said. "This course was pret
ty tough, but I have run in all kinds
of conditions, and it's the condi
tions that make the course so
tough. There are a lot of gradual
changes in this course."
The Nebraska duo of juniors
Jonah Kiptarus (30:20) and Cleo
phus Boor (30:24) finished second
and third, respectively. Cardin
al senior Greg Jimmerson finished
fourth with a time of 30:38. Sopho
more Brad Hauser (30:44) and se
nior J.J. White (30:49) finished
sixth and ninth overall, respective
ly-
Sophomore Brent Hauser
(31:10) and Nutter (31:11) gar
nered the rest of the Cardinal's
points by taking 14th and 15th
overall, respectively.
Both the Cardinal and the Ra
zorbacks had three runners fmish
in the top 10 overall, with Arkansas

gaining a three-point advantage.
But the Cardinal depth proved to be
too much, as Stanford's fourth and
fifth men finished before the fourth
man from Arkansas.
"I'm just so thankful that the
Lord has blessed us so much with
awesome teammates, great talents
and the motivation to go out there
and achieve what we've done," Jim
merson said. "I was out there pray
ing the whole way."
