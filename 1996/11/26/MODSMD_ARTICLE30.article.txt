# Ice hockey splits series with Cal Bears
## After winning first game 7-1, Stanford can't hold on for sweep 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
Until last week, the old saying "you win
some, you lose some" had been unknown by
the erstwhile-undefeated Cardinal.
But on Friday, the California ice hockey
team was able to teach Stanford a lesson in

equality by splitting a two-game series with the
club.
After beating the Golden Bears soundly
Thursday night in Oakland, the Cardinal (7-3-
2, 7-1-2 Pacific 8 Conference) was unable to
complete the job at home the next night, losing
3-1.
On Thursday, in front of a loud throng of

2,000 screaming Cal fans, Stanford could do no
wrong. Behind Stanford golfers Conrad Ray, a
senior, and Eri Crum, a junior, the team made
short work of the Bears, blasting them 7-2.
Apparently, playing in front of the biggest
enemy crowd of the season didn 't faze the Car-
dinal as it rolled to victory with six
goals in the second period.
"We silenced the crowd early
with the goal in the first," said
team president Sami Jo Small.
"And in the second, they weren't
really saying much."
The game was an offensive
conquest. After a slow first period,
the Cardinal exploded with six
goals in the second. The period
ended 7-1.
One reason for the team's suc
cess was its incredible aim on the
goal.
"The shots were about even,"
Small said. "The difference was
that almost all of ours went in."
Before the game, Cardinal
players had expressed reserva
tions about the Stanford team,
saying that teamwork was its

weak spot. Since the players and
formations had changed so often
during the season, they hadn't
gotten used to the teammates
that were on the ice with them.
At Cal, however, it seemed the
team had finally solved that prob
lem.
"The game at Cal showed how
good the team can be," said fresh
man Phil Enan.
"Thursday night showed our
potential when the team plays
together," Small agreed.
But the win was marred by the
ejection of Stanford's Gabe Miller
and Chuck Glew. Miller was
accused of spearing a Cal player
with the butt end of his stick,
while Glew was tossed for slash
ing the opponent across the hel
met.
"Slashing someone is an auto
matic one-game suspension," said
Crum, who contributed with two
goals. "But the other suspension
was an unfair call. The referees

completely ignored what the Cal
player was doing to Gabe."
If Thursday's game was the
best of times, then Friday was the
worst of times, as Stanford was
unable to put it together at home,
losing 3-1.
The team's only score, a goal in
the third period that put the score
at 2-1, came during a Cal power
play. Playing shorthanded, the
puck took a lucky bounce, and
graduate student Filip Ronning
was able to grab the assist from
Ray and put the puck through the
net.
But any momentum the Cardi
nal might have gained from the
play was quickly put to rest as the
Cal troop scored its third goal of
the evening, driving the wooden
stake through the heart of the
Cardinal. Gpl's final goal made the
score 3-1 at the end of the third.
"I think we were a little lack
adaisical, having just beaten Cal
the night before," Small said.
