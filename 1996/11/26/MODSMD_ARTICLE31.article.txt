# Wrestlers face the Gators tonight in San Francisco
## 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
The wrestling team takes on San Francisco
State tonight in what should be a close and hard
fought match. Though the meet doesn't deter
mine national or conference standing, it is "a mat
ter of pride," according to Stanford coach Chris
Horpel.
"On paper, San Francisco State is favored to
beat us, which hasn't happened in many, many
years," Horpel said. "I would say that they would
be favored 6-4 going into the match, though three
matches are really too close to call. It's probably
going to come down to the close matches."
San Francisco State is a good measuring stick
for the performance of the Stanford wrestling pro
gram since both schools receive similar funding. In
the past, Stanford has proven it is capable of con
sistently beating the Gators, which spoke well for
the talent and ability of the Cardinal wrestlers and
coaching staff.
This year, San Francisco State seems to have
caught up with the Cardinal program. The
wrestling team consists mainly of juniors and
seniors, giving the Gators an edge over the younger
and less experienced Cardinal. The Gators have
also picked up several transfer students from
junior colleges, which has also helped to improve
the team.
Several Stanford wrestlers will meet the same
men they wrestled in the Southern Oregon Open.
Senior Brian Vaniman will take on San Francisco
State's Lee Lofton, whom he defeated in a close
match at Oregon 4-0 to earn a third-place finish.
"I'm looking forward to the rematch," Vaniman
said. "Though I won the match, I made some mis
takes against the SFS wrestler which I shouldn't
have, so I'll see what I can do against him this
time."
At 177 pounds, junior Scott Chapman will meet
John Duquette. Duquette lost to Oregon State's
Clint Wilson, who Chapman defeated in the final
round to earn third place.
Junior Jeff Grant will take on Paul Healy. Healy
lost to Grant's final opponent, who Grant
squeaked by 2-0 to pick up the third-place finish.
At 126 pounds, Cardinal sophomore Zach Zimmer
er will take on Jon Nichols, who made a poor show
ing at the Oregon tourney, losing his only two

Then-junior Brian Vaniman wrestles his opponent in a match last February. Tonight, the Cardinal
wrestlers take on the Gators at San Francisco State at 7 p.m.
matches.
Starting at 134 pounds in place
of the injured Robert Hatta — who
separated his shoulder at the Ore
gon tourney — will be sophomore
Frank Ruiz. He will meet Gator
Francis Aquino, who managed a
fourth-place finish in Oregon.
At 144 pounds, sophomore
Beau Werner will have his hands
full against Steve Hilas, who was
the champion at 144 pounds at the

Southern Oregon tournament.

at Oregon, will meet the second
place finisher, San Francisco
State's Mario Moreno.
At 158 pounds, Stanford senior
Ryan Barnes, also a fourth-place
finisher at his weight, will meet
Greg Jackson, who took second at
Oregon. At 118 pounds, freshman
