# Rugby holds own in alumni game
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The young and enthusiastic men's and
women's rugby teams continued their progress
toward carrying on the success of last year's
squads.
On Sunday the returning experienced play
ers, the enormous rookie roster and skilled
Stanford alumni gathered on the rugby field for
a traditional alumni game which takes place
every year on the day after Big Game. More
than 30 former Cardinal players, including All-
Americans and national team players, gathered
from all over the nation to participate in the
event.
The men's squad defeated its alumni 41-35,
and the women's team put up a close 31-19
fight, losing by two tries.
The alumni fought against a mixed team of
experienced A-side team members and talented
new rookies. For the women's team, some rook
ies joined the Cardinal alumnae for a match
against the A-side team.
With the season kicking in soon after winter
break, all players were in high spirits as they
saw some of the greatest Cardinal efforts so far
this season. After losing many of their key play
ers from last season, both teams are currently
enjoying a high turnout of potentially talented
rookies this year, all of whom saw playing time
in the match.
As expressions on the faces of the accom
plished alumni grew more serious with each
Cardinal play of the current team, the Stanford
players grew closer together as a team.
The matches Sunday were a significant notch
above the other preseason games, in which the
young teams never quite seemed to click. Coach
Franck Boivert said the team had been making
too many "silly mistakes" due to the infancy of
the squads.
However, after the alumni matches, mem
bers of the 1996-97 roster agreed that they were
great wrap-ups for the fall preseason.
As the squad continues to improve upon its
skills, the players are more confident and ready
to tackle the official season starting in Jan
uary.
"We're making big steps right now," said
team captain Joe Clayton "We are in a rapid
growing period â€” we grew up in
the game."
Clayton said the Stanford
players enjoyed the intense bat
tles and appreciated the practice
that the Stanford graduates
brought them.
"For us, alumni matches are
games against the top Stanford
rugby players over the past 10
years," Clayton said. "Almost all
our matchups were against Ail-
Americans."
For the women's team, the
match was also a celebration of
its 20th anniversary. The squad
was started in 1976, at which
time former astronaut Sally
Ride was a member.
"I think it's great that so many
young players are on the team,"
said Jenn Crawford, a 1986 grad
uate and National team member.
"When we played, we barely had
enough to fill the team. We were
lucky to have subs."
"It was a lot of fun playing
against people 1 used to play
with," said Jenn Kerns, a key
player from last year's roster.
Kerns said the new Cardinal
should look ahead to a hard
working and bright season, as
the enormous rookie roster dis
played a lot of potential in the
match.
