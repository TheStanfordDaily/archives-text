The young and enthusiastic men's and
women's rugby teams continued their progress
toward carrying on the success of last year's
squads.
On Sunday the returning experienced play
ers, the enormous rookie roster and skilled

a traditional alumni game which takes place
every year on the day after Big Game. More
than 30 former Cardinal players, including All-

enjoying a high turnout of potentially talented
rookies this year, all of whom saw playing time

Cardinal play of the current team, the Stanford
players grew closer together as a team.

above the other preseason games, in which the
young teams never quite seemed to click. Coach
Franck Boivert said the team had been making
too many "silly mistakes" due to the infancy of
the squads.
However, after the alumni matches, mem
bers of the 1996-97 roster agreed that they were
great wrap-ups for the fall preseason.
As the squad continues to improve upon its
skills, the players are more confident and ready
to tackle the official season starting in Jan
uary.
"We're making big steps right now," said
team captain Joe Clayton "We are in a rapid
