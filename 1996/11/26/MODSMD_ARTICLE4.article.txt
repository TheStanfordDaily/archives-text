"We thought that maybe this could hap

pen," said senior Monal Chokshi. "We knew
our team was right up there, but it's amazing
and I can't believe it.
"I was just concentrating on my race," she
said. "I think we all had our own goals. We
just wanted to go out and run our best."
Arizona sophomore Amy Skiersz, who was
runner-up at last year's national meet, added
to the conference and district titles she
earned earlier this month by finishing first

with a time of 17 minutes, 4 seconds for the
5,100-meter course.
"I was kind of scared toward the end of the
race," Skiersz said. "I didn't know where any
one was. I was not sure if anyone was gaining.
I didn't think it would be the kind of race it
was. I thought it wouki be closer at the end."
