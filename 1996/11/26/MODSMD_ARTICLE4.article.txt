# Women slip by Villanova to gain an unexpected first place
## 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
TUCSON, Ariz. — The Stanford women
edged out top-ranked Villanova to capture
their first NCAA cross-country title. The Car
dinal finished with 101 points, just under Vil
lanova's total of 106. Brigham Young fin
ished third with 136 points.
"We thought that maybe this could hap

pen," said senior Monal Chokshi. "We knew
our team was right up there, but it's amazing
and I can't believe it.
"I was just concentrating on my race," she
said. "I think we all had our own goals. We
just wanted to go out and run our best."
Arizona sophomore Amy Skiersz, who was
runner-up at last year's national meet, added
to the conference and district titles she
earned earlier this month by finishing first

with a time of 17 minutes, 4 seconds for the
5,100-meter course.
"I was kind of scared toward the end of the
race," Skiersz said. "I didn't know where any
one was. I was not sure if anyone was gaining.
I didn't think it would be the kind of race it
was. I thought it wouki be closer at the end."

Chokshi was the first Cardi
nal runner to cross the finish
line, clocking in at 17:58 to
place 10th. Junior Jessica Fry
(18:04) and sophomore Mary
Cobb (18:05) finished 16th and
17th, respectively. Senior Leila
Burr (18:30) and junior Sara
Moore (18:40) garnered the
rest of the Cardinal points by
finishing 42nd and 55th,
respectively.
"We knew that we had the
talent to do this," Fry said. "We
knew that we could pull it off,
but it was hard to put it into
words because we didn't want
to jinx ourselves. But now
everything's come together.
There's been doubts from oth
ers, but we were very strong.
We're so very close that there
was no way we were going to let
each other down."
After the first four runners
for each team came in, Villano
va had a commanding 15-point
lead over the Cardinal. But
Moore finished far enough
ahead of the fifth Wildcat run
ner and helped clinch the title
for Stanford.
"I am just so proud for
them," said assistant coach
Beth Alford-Sullivan. "I feel
like they definitely deserved
this and worked hard for it.

They ran for position but they
ran with composure.
"That's the concept we've
been pushing for two years —
running with composure,"
Alford-Sullivan said. "Learning
how to keep your head out
there. They haven't done that
in the past, but they kept their
heads today and just ran for the
positions they needed to run
for."

The titles mark the highest
point the teams have achieved
since the arrival of Lananna to
the Farm five years ago. Since
then, the teams have both
climbed up the rankings in
order to become a national con
tender.
"For me, it's obviously the
highlight of my career," Lanan
na said. "I've always dreamed
about winning an NCAA title,

and to be the coach of both
teams is for me something that
words can't describe.
"I'm very proud of all of our
athletes, especially our seniors,
who five years ago believed that
we could do this. They came
into Stanford when we were
kind of struggling, and they
helped us win a Pac-10 title,
then a district title and now the
NCAA championships."
