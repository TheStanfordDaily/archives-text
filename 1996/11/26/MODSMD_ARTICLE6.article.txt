# Eating clubs may be relocated
## Toyon eateries plan for possible move in 2000 due to CIP 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
Managers of the Toyon Eating Clubs
discussed the Capital Improvement Pro
gram which may force the clubs to relo
cate by the year 2000 at an eating clubs
advisory board meeting yesterday.
The most likely plan is that the Uni
versity will move the four eating facilities
— Los Arcos, El Cuadro, Breakers and El
Toro — behind Toyon, connecting them
via a courtyard to Branner Hall's kitchen.
At the meeting, Nick Peters, president
and general manager of the Stanford Eat
ing Clubs, cited the major advantages the
proposed Toyon extension would have for
the University.
"The University is looking to rebuild,"

Peters said.
But the primary problem with moving
the eating clubs is losing the ambience
the clubs provide, Peters said.
"The clubs have a funky and unique at
mosphere," said Peters. "If they move us
to behind Toyon, this would change the
eating clubs. We would be stuck in a small
space, with little interaction and much
less community, becoming more like Uni
versity Food Services," Peters said.
The University plans to replace the
aging eating clubs during the summer of
2000 as part of the ongoing Capital Im
provement Program, which is renovating
a series of dormitories and houses.
Peters cited several reasons the Uni
versity has for the move. One is that plac
ing the eating clubs in what now is a dead

courtyard space opens up valuable prop
erty for the University, he explained.
He added that merging the eating
clubs with Branner's kitchen would uti
lize space currently not being used.
"Branner's kitchen is too big," Peters
said. " It has been operating at a loss for a
longtime."
Also, with the new Schwab Residen
tial Center in the same vicinity, the Uni
versity could use the vacated space for
parking.
Peters noted that the eating club space
interferes with the University's vision for
the space stretching from Hoover Tower
to Kimball Hall.
The University also is considering
