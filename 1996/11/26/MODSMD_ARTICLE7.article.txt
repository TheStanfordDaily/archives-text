# Sophomore adjusts to life in the West

### Mignon Fogarty Contributing writer 
Editor's note: In
1968, Andy Warhol
made the oft-quot
ed (and misquoted)
statement, "In the

future, everyone
will be famous for 15 minutes. With that in
mind, in addition to the idea that everyone
has a story to tell. The Daily is in the second
year of a series about various members of the
Stanford community. Interview subjects are
picked entirely at random from the Stanford
Directory.
Stanford's not the first place you think
about going to college when you're from
Boston, according to sophomore Andrew
Fuller.
"You may have heard about Stanford as a
child," he said, "or seen them on TV if they
had a good year in football. "
Fuller is the first person from Belmont
Hill, the all-male prep school he attended for

six years, to come to Stanford since 1985.
"I don't think my teachers knew what to
think about me," he said. "People had en
tertained the idea of coming out here but al
ways ended up staying on the East Coast."
Fuller described his family as entirely
East Coast people. "Their rule for my older
brother was that he couldn't apply to any
schools west of the Mississippi, so when I
threw out the idea that I was thinking about
going to Stanford, it was definitely against
t heir better thinking," he said.
However, Fuller's parents came to see
the error of their ways. "They knew it was a
great school, so t hey allowed me come out to
visit We really enjoyed coming out here, and
my dad saw that the opportunities out here
were great."
Ironically, coming to Stanford wasn't
even Fuller's idea. "Coming to Stanford was
something I started thinking about when
my friend, Brian, started thinking about
coming out here to play baseball," Fuller

said. "He really put into my head
what a great school Stanford was.
"We visited together and spent a
weekend in San Francisco with my
dad," he said. "But Brian didn't get
in. He sort of knew that he wasn't
going to be able to play here, so he
started thinking about other
schools. It was really his dream,
but it sort of became that way for
me."
In spite of the distance, the two
still keep in touch. "He's playing
baseball in North Carolina. I went
to visit him last year for a weekend
and had a great time. We're still re
ally close," said Fuller.
Fuller chose Stanford over Har
vard University and Duke Univer
sity and describes coming to a
school so far from home as the
riskiest decision he's ever made.
"I vaguely knew a few people in
my class," he said. "Basically I had

a few names, but that was it."
Although Fuller doesn't regret
his decision, he said the hardest
part about being at Stanford is liv
ing so far from his family.
"My house is 10 minutes from
Harvard," he said. "Any problems
that I've had here, I've had to deal
with over the phone."
Being so far away has also forced
Fuller to be more independent,
which he categorizes as "a good
thing."
"Being independent is some
thing that I feared wouldn 't happen
if I was at Harvard," said Fuller.
"Through high school all my deci
sions were pretty safe. This was the
first decision that was entirely un
safe — coming to a school this far
away, knowing no one. It was excit
ing to do something so risky."
A lot has changed for Fuller
since coming to Stanford. "I was
thinking about economics (as a
major) when I came here," he said.
"But I think that industrial engi
neering is a chance to take my tal
ents in math and science and put a

business slant on it."
In addition, Fuller's outlook on
life has changed. "Freshman year
was mostly the shock of having
everything different. This year I'm
definitely ready to get everything
settled and do work," he said. "I've
been much more productive than
fall quarter last year."
Although Fuller said he has no
regrets about the enormous
amount of fun he had last year, he
felt that one problem was not being
involved in enough activities. This
is definitely not a problem this
year, as Fuller keeps busy with
lacrosse practice five days a week,
being a Sigma Chi pledge and hash
ing in the kitchen three times a
week.
Fuller wants to be remembered
as someone who is forthright and
trustworthy.
"I'm someone who definitely
cares and would be there whenever
anyone needed something of me or
if they were in trouble," he said.
"That is something I've worked on
doing. There have been times when

friends were in trouble, and I've
been right there for them."
In addition, Fuller is looking for
ward to taking some trips around
the Bay Area this year and hopes to
find time for salsa dance classes in
the future.
