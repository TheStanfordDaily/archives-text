## CIA cocaine trafficking claim denied 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A former comman
der of the Contras in their fight against the
Nicaraguan government yesterday scoffed at
the idea that the CIA was connected to cocaine
trafficking in the United States to raise money
for the Contras.
"I could never suspect or never imagined any
of the CIA people I met.. . could be capable of
going into any kind of illegal or immoral or
criminal activities," Adolfo Calero told the Sen
ate Intelligence Committee.
Eden Pastora, the "Commander Zero" who
was the No. 1 resistance leader on Nicaragua's
Southern Front, denied knowing that a wealthy
contributor to the Contras was a drug traffick
er.
"Only when he was arrested in San Diego,"
Pastora said of Oscar Danilo Blandon. "I did
not know he was a drug trafficker, but I did
know him as a good friend."
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the
committee, said Blandon had testified in a
deposition Monday that he became involved in
selling cocaine in California in late 1981 in
order to earn money for the Contras.
"In response to direct questions from the
committee, Mr. Blandon stated that he had
never had any contact with the CIA and that
the CIA was not involved in his drug-traffick
ing business in any way," Specter said.
The committee, along with other federal offi
cials, is investigating the issue as a result of sto
ries in the San Jose Mercury News.
The stories concluded that two
Nicaraguan drug dealers with connections to
a CIA-run guerrilla army in the Central
American country were responsible for pro
liferation of the cocaine trade in California in
the 1980s.
The newspaper did not accuse the CIA of
dealing drugs to help the Contras, and other
news organizations have questioned some of
the newspaper's conclusions. However, the
Mercury News stories have led several black
members of Congress to allege a CIA-drug con
nection.
