# Disney to release Lama film despite China
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Walt Dis
ney Co. has decided to honor its
deal to distribute a new film
about Tibet's exiled religious
leader, the Dalai Lama, even at
the risk of jeopardizing the com
pany's expansion in China.
Disney made its position clear
for the first time yesterday since
reports surfaced late last week
that Chinese officials had private
ly expressed their displeasure to
the company about the project.
The film, "Kundun," is one of
two movies currently under pro
duction about the Dalai Lama.
China's anger over the film comes
as Disney officials look for ways to
expand the Magic Kingdom into
the world's most populous nation.
"We have an agreement to dis
tribute the film, and we will
honor it," said John Dreyer, a
Disney spokesman. He would
comment no further on the deci
sion.
The Dalai Lama, the 1989
Nobel Peace Prize winner, has
called for Tibetan independence
and is viewed by the Beijing gov
ernment as a threat to China's
rule over the former Himalayan
kingdom.

China's position on the film
raised concerns that it would use
Disney's desire to expand in
China as a wedge to force the
company to distance itself from
the project. The Chinese haven't
said whether or how Disney, the
world's second-largest media and
entertainment company, will be
penalized.
Disney will distribute the the
film in the United States under a
four-year production deal that
brought Martin Scorsese, the
director of "Kundun," to the com
pany's lot.
Given Disney's desire to
attract major talents like Scors
ese, some entertainment industry
executives said it was important
for Disney to back the film. They
also saw the decision as a test of
Disney's commitment to artistic
freedom.
"What this shows is how des
perate China is to try to marginal
ize and, if possible, silence the
Dalai Lama, which is something
that dictatorial regimes like to
do," said Danny Schechter, co
executive producer of "Rights &
Wrongs: Human Rights Televi
sion." "Unfortunately, Mao's

legacy and Mickey Mouse's legacy
are colliding here."
It's unclear unclear exactly
how the Chinese government con
veyed its initial anger to Disney.
Officials at China's Film Bureau,
the government's movie authori
ty, told The Associated Press in
Beijing that while they have not
seen the movie, they did not
appreciate its focus on the Dalai
Lama.
"Of course we oppose this,"
said Kong Min, an official at the
bureau's foreign affairs depart
ment.
One industry source, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said
Disney has so far had one high
level meeting in China to explore
the possibilities for all its busi
nesses there.
There are no firm plans, how
ever, the source added, for a new
theme park in the country or any
other expansion. But sales of mer
chandise tied to its films would no
doubt bring millions of dollars,
particularly given the huge suc
cess in China of "The Lion King."
Christopher Dixon, a media
analyst at the brokerage firm
PaineWebber Inc., said he felt the

issue of a Beijing threat to block
Disney's expansion plans was
largely a non-issue.
"You're not going to keep the
Chinese people from seeing Mick
ey Mouse," he said.
But China has used its muscle
before to pressure foreign compa
nies over political questions. Back
in 1994, News Corp. chairman
Rupert Murdoch removed BBC
World Service Television news
from his satellite TV service in
northern Asia to ease bad rela
tions with China, which objected
to some BBC programming.
On the other hand, the Chi
nese also have shown a willing
ness to be flexible. When U.S.
companies first started streaming
into China in the mid-1980s, they
would not accept a suggestion
that workers be screened for
them by the government. China
backed down.
"U.S. companies said that's
not the basis under which we will
go in," recalled Caiman Cohen,
who is currently working on U.S.-
China trade as president of the
Emergency Committee for Amer
ican Trade, a trade group of big
companies.
