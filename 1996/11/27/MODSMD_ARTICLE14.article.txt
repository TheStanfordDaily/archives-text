# Refugees continue long trek to Goma

GOMA, Zaire (AP) â€” Walking
slowly across eastern Zaire in a
column that stretched for miles,
thousands of refugees reached
Goma yesterday after new rebel
attacks on Hutu militias broke
their hold over the refugees.
The 5,000 road-weary refugees
followed Hutu militias deeper
into Zaire when rebels attacked
two weeks ago. But when rebels
challenged the Hutu militias at
Walikale, 90 miles west of Goma,
the fighters fled west and the
refugees fled east, toward home.
"We followed our leaders
toward Walikale, but then we
heard gunshots and our leaders
ran away," one refugee said yes
terday. "So now we are going
back to Rwanda."
Rebel leader Laurent Desire
Kabila was fighting an alliance of
Zairian government troops and
Hutu militias near Walikale.
Kabila's forces are battling their
way westward toward the far
away capital of Kinshasa, and are
said to be planning a separate
offensive from the south.
Fears of a new war front open
ing up sent the parliament into
special session on Monday and
put the army on alert. Some par
liament members suggested Zaire
hire foreign mercenaries, saying
its own demoralized troops have
failed miserably against the
rebels.
The eastern cities of Beni and
Butembo, and Bunia in the

northeast, have fallen to the
rebels' latest advance, parliament
members said, speaking on condi
tion of anonymity.
U.N. officials said the rebels
have given them clearance to pick
up another 20,000 refugees at
Numbi, on the eastern shore of
Lake Kivu south of Goma, and
planned to send a convoy there
today.
Amnesty International said
yesterday that rebels had massa
cred 500 refugee men earlier this
month at a camp in eastern Zaire.
The rebels also killed a Roman
Catholic priest when he protested
the slaughter, the human rights
group said.
The report could not be con
firmed independently.
The refugees flooding into
Goma appeared to back claims by
the rebels that Hutu extremists
had been using the refugees as
human shields to deter attacks.
They said many others did not
survive the march, dying along
the road. Many more refugees
were behind them, they said.
At Sake, nine miles west of
Goma, refugees lined up for a
mile, waiting to board buses and
trucks to be taken to the border
with Rwanda. They said up to
10,000 more from Walikale would
reach Goma on today.
The group is one of several
large concentrations of refugees
observed by U.S. reconnaissance
planes in the last few days.
