# Boycott continues
## Texaco policy changes not enough 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Civil
rights leaders said yesterday that
Texaco is not doing enough to rem
edy the racial discrimination ills
uncovered earlier this month, so
the boycott of the oil company will
continue.
A coalition of women's rights
groups and black leaders said they
were disappointed with an update
from Texaco officials about pro
posed hiring and policy changes.
"The update from executives at
Texaco . .. was less than thrilling,"
said NAACP President Kweisi
Mfume. "It's just disappointing to
hear the lack of preparation that
has gone into the creation of that
action plan thus far."
Mfume and Rainbow Coalition
leader Jesse Jackson warned they
will call for nationwide stock
divestiture in two weeks if Texaco
doesn't present a comprehensive
plan with firm goals, targets and
timetables for the hiring and
advancement of minorities and
women.
"After listening to the presenta
tion that was made ... it was clear
that the same sense of urgency does
not seem to be taking place at Tex
aco," Mfume said.
Texaco President Peter Bijur
had agreed to begin Dec. 12
announcing policy changes, days
after the settlement was reached,
followed later by 60-day and 90-day
plans, Texaco officials said.
During a daylong meeting of the

coalition, Ed Gadson, Texaco's
director of employment and diversi
ty, presented a plan to remedy dis
crimination practices at the compa
ny. The discussions covered policies
in hiring and promotion, policy
making decisions, procurement,
economic development, acquisition
financing and investments in
minority venture capital funds.
Texaco plans to incorporate
"many of the excellent suggestions
that have come from these minori
ty and women's groups," the com
pany said in a statement. Texaco
remains "committed to developing
a clear, credible and substantive
plan designed to deliver lasting pos
itive results."
Texaco agreed Nov. 15 to pay
$176.1 million t.o settle a racial dis
crimination lawsuit, filed in 1994,
that claimed a "good old boy" net
work at Texaco reserved the best
promotions and biggest raises for
whites.
Jackson urged the Justice
Department to condemn the dis
crimination practices at Texaco
more strongly to send a message to
other companies.
"The Justice Department has
been much too silent in the face of
the aggressive rejection of the com
mitment to end race and gender
bias," Jackson said, adding that he
wants to meet with President Clin
ton to talk about the administra
tion taking a more active stand
against racial discrimination.
