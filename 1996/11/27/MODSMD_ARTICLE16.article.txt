## 
### 
CALCUTTA, India (AP) — Doctors were
trying to determine yesterday when Mother
Teresa would be strong enough to survive a
test and a procedure that could increase the
flow of blood to her ailing heart.
Dr. Tarun Praharaj described the 86-
year-old nun's condition as "unstable" yes
terday. He said he would observe her for an
indefinite period before deciding when to
proceed with the test, called an angiogram.
Mother Teresa, hospitalized since Friday
with chest pains following years of heart
problems, was moved to Calcutta's B.M.
Birla Heart Research Center yesterday in
preparation for the angiogram — which
would be her third
An angiogram involves puncturing an
artery, usually in the groin, and threading a
tube up into the chest arteries. Dye is then
injected into the arteries and X-rays are
taken.
Praharaj performed an angiogram on
Mother Teresa in 1993, and at that time he
also dilated her arteries with tiny balloons
to improve the flow of blood, a procedure
known as angioplasty He indicated angio
plasty again may be necessary.
Mother Teresa also underwent an
angiogram and angioplasty in 1991.
Doctors say the Roman Catholic nun,
beloved around the world for her service to
the poor, is reluctant to undergo invasive
procedures. Her medical team told her yes

terday morning that her problems were
similar to those in 1993 when her condition
improved after treatment.
"Mother said. 'In that case, you do what
ever you feel is necessary,' " said S.K. Sen,
medical director at Woodlands Nursing
Home, where Mother Teresa was admitted
Friday when one of the four chambers of
her heart failed to perform properly.
Mother Teresa, recipient of the 1979
Nobel Peace Prize, has had two heart
attacks since 1983 and received a pacemak
er in 1989. This year, she has been hospital
ized four times — twice with heart problems
and twice with injuries sustained during
Mb
Aides have taken over much of the day
to-day responsibilities of running her Mis
sionaries of Charity since Mother Teresa's
health began to decline. The organization
operates 517 homes for the poor, AIDS hos
pices and other charity centers around the
world, including 169 in India.
The nuns of the Sisters of Charity were
to hold elections within the next few
months to elect their leader, a post Mother
Teresa has held since founding the order in
1950. The order's constitution requires a
vote every six years.
In 1990, Mother Teresa said she wanted
to retire, and her name was not on the bal
lot. She reluctantly agreed to stay on after
all the sisters wrote her name in anyway.
