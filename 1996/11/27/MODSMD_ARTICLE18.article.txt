New Stanford Store is
a milestone in Tresidder
and ASSU development

STANFORD STUDENTS,
faculty and staff have reason
to celebrate yet another
grand opening in Tresidder Union.
Coming on the heels of the long
overdue opening of a Mexican fast
food restaurant, the grand open
ing of the Stanford Store next door
to Polio Rey marks a new mile
stone both in Tresidder's and
Stanford Student Enterprises'
development.
The Stanford Store is not just
the latest incarnation of the stu
dent-run apparel store, formerly
known as the Cardinal Collection
and — before that — the Shirt
Shak. The Stanford Store seeks to
consolidate almost all of Stanford
Student Enterprises' service busi
nesses in one centrally located
store. Students will now purchase
ASSU lecture notes and Flicks
passes at the Stanford Store, and
students who live off campus can
pick up their directories at the
store, as well.
The store represents all that is
worthwhile about the ASSU's
Stanford Student Enterprises.
Entirely student-run and student
designed, the store gives students
the chance to learn the intricacies
of running a small business while
providing useful services and
goods for other students. Profits
from the store go back to the
ASSU and are used to fund vari
ous campus groups.
The Stanford Store deserves
special praise for taking on the
Stanford Bookstore in Cardinal
apparel and other goods. As even a
casual visitor to the Bookstore's
second floor soon realizes, its
goods are not priced to fit stu
dents' budgets. Stanford Store
merchandise tends to be cheaper,
and students get an additional 15
percent off on all store merchan
dise.

For those who still doubt that
the new store constitutes real com
petition for the Bookstore, just
look at the Bookstore's rather pan
icked reaction. Bookstore CEO
Peggy Mendelson disclosed last
week that the Bookstore has
threatened apparel suppliers like
Champion and Russell with loss of
orders if they do business with the
new store. The Bookstore, in
short, is ready to play hardball to
defend its turf. It can only be
hoped that the Bookstore does not
use its established and dominant
position to strangle the new store
at its inception.
Fortunately, things appear to be
going well for the new store. Store
manager Marni Haugen said first
week purchases exceeded expecta
tions, though it should be noted
that Big Game week is bound to
attract more business than nor
mal. The real test for the store will
come over the next couple of
months as it tries to establish itself
and siphon off tourist and alumni
purchases from the Bookstore.
One big factor in the store's suc
cess will be the future use of the
nearby Tresidder floorspace. With
Polio Key and the Stanford Store
anchoring one end and the Coffee
House the other, Tresidder's south
flank has the potential of becom
ing a genuine student center. This
opportunity should not be thrown
away. Negotiations are already
under way to bring a juice bar into
Tresidder; why not a bagel shop, a
hamburger joint or a Chinese
restaurant? As Haugen said, the
Stanford Store and Polio Rey "feed
off each other." The addition of
new enterprises could only enliven
the area even more.
Even with all the goodwill in the
world, the Stanford Store's sur
vival will depend, like all business
es, on its ability to offer a variety
of goods and services that cus
tomers actually want at a reason
able price. Hopefully, the store will
be able to offer more choice in mer
chandise as it grows over the next
few months.
