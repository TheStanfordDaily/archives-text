# Final battle lost
## Stanford Band drops last round to Princeton in ESPN Web poll contest 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Stanford Band narrowly missed becom
ing the band of all bands this week, losing to the
Princeton University Band in the final round of
an Internet poll conducted by ESPN's Sport
szone World Wide Web site.
The "Battle of the Bands" saw the Stanford
Band finish second best by a mere margin of 520
votes, acquiring 46.4 percent of the 7,216 votes
cast in the final round.
The legitimacy and accuracy of the results,
however, remain questionable.
Internet access was the only prerequisite to

among the 16 bands ESPN selected from all
across the country. Bands ranged from the tra

bands of the East Coast schools.
"We try to find a diverse group of the very
best," said Jake Freeman, content developer for
Sportszone. "We included the Stanford Band in

the contest because they are an interesting and
popular group of people."
According to Freeman, the creativity it takes
to campaign and to try to find ways around the
computer system makes the Band unique, giv
ing it an edge over other groups. "The incredible
amount of ingenuity and energy [the voting
process involvesl is admirable," Freeman added.
Last spring, the Stanford Tree was suspend
ed from Sports Zone's "Battle of the Mascots,"
after its selection committee officials learned
that two Stanford students tried to fix the bal
loting.
Two undergraduates — one an electrical en
gineering major and the other a computer sci
