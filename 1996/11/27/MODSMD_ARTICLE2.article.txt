# Final battle lost
## Stanford Band drops last round to Princeton in ESPN Web poll contest 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Stanford Band narrowly missed becom
ing the band of all bands this week, losing to the
Princeton University Band in the final round of
an Internet poll conducted by ESPN's Sport
szone World Wide Web site.
The "Battle of the Bands" saw the Stanford
Band finish second best by a mere margin of 520
votes, acquiring 46.4 percent of the 7,216 votes
cast in the final round.
The legitimacy and accuracy of the results,
however, remain questionable.
Internet access was the only prerequisite to
take part in the voting process, allowing all to
cast votes on the contest's Web site. It was also
unclear whether double votes actually counted

in the final outcome.
Allegations have arisen that students in
many of the participating schools had gotten to
gether to cast an immense number of votes to in
fluence the voting. Stanford is not an exception.
"I think Princeton had more people voting
over and over again," said freshman Bobby Fer
rario, a saxophone player in the Stanford Band.
"I think there's a lot of scandal."
The contest was a single-elimination tourna
ment, in which voters chose their favorite band
among the 16 bands ESPN selected from all
across the country. Bands ranged from the tra
ditional military Midwest bands to the scatter
bands of the East Coast schools.
"We try to find a diverse group of the very
best," said Jake Freeman, content developer for
Sportszone. "We included the Stanford Band in

the contest because they are an interesting and
popular group of people."
According to Freeman, the creativity it takes
to campaign and to try to find ways around the
computer system makes the Band unique, giv
ing it an edge over other groups. "The incredible
amount of ingenuity and energy [the voting
process involvesl is admirable," Freeman added.
Last spring, the Stanford Tree was suspend
ed from Sports Zone's "Battle of the Mascots,"
after its selection committee officials learned
that two Stanford students tried to fix the bal
loting.
Two undergraduates — one an electrical en
gineering major and the other a computer sci
ence major — had written a script that simply
bombarded the Web site with votes
for the Tree and set up the pro
gram on five machines on campus,
leaving it running while the voting
lasted. A large number of entries
had flooded the polling system
used to count votes, making it dif
ficult for others to cast ballots dur
ing the competition.
The Tree is now banned from
participating in the annual mas
cots tournament until the year
2001.
The mascot battle was the first

of Sports Zone's series of Internet
contests. Last month, the station
conducted a poll to choose the best
fans in college sports. It also has
plans for a contest to choose the
best college football game next
month.
The mascot contest, timed to
crown a winner during the week
end of the NCAA basketball tour
nament, will have its second tour
nament in April.
"Unfortunately, the Tree won't
be involved," Freeman said. "But I
hope all this adds to the excite
ment of college sports. We want to
take advantage of the unlimited
room provided by [the Internet
medium]."
