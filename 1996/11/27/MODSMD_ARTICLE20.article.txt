## You'll hear from my lawyer 
### 
THE COMMITTEE OF 15 has
undertaken a massive overhaul of
the Stanford judicial system. Its
preliminary recommendations are gener
ally quite solid, and committee chair
Mark Zoback deserves praise for han
dling the tricky issue of "burden of
proof." Many members of the committee
wish to lower the burden of proof from
"beyond a reasonable doubt," the stan
dard for criminal cases in the United
States, to a lower standard of "clear and
convincing evidence," which roughly
quantifies 70 percent of the evidence.
When this issue threatened to derail the
committee's recommendations, Zoback
wisely turned to the student body, asking
the ASSU Senate to settle the issue.
Incredibly, student leadership has
been noticeable. Senators have been
meeting with students and canvassing
opinion. ASSU President Bill Shen has
publicly declared his opposition to lower
ing the burden of proof, and he is (for a
change) absolutely correct.
Committee members considered low
ering the burden of proof on the grounds
that it is too difficult to convict people
charged with academic fraud. Boys and
girls, it's not supposed to be easy. Our
aim shouldn't be to increase convictions
as much as it should be to decrease viola
tions (there's a big difference). Anyone
who has taken Economics 154 knows
that deterrence can be elevated by
increasing the expected punishment.
Probability of detection is only one fac
tor.

First, I'd like to tell the committee
that we students agree that cheating is a
problem. I don't know how widespread of
a problem it is (since statistics are confi
dential), but I know that it happens, and
when it does, it hurts ALL students.
Believe me Prof. Zoback, the overwhelm
ing majority of students who do not cheat
would like nothing more than to convict
absolutely everyone who breaks the
rules. WE are the ones who suffer from
artificially inflated grading curves, whose
transcripts are diluted and who just flat
out work harder and deserve better.
Most of us completely support
stronger punishment for cheaters to
improve deterrence. Hell, if you cheat,
you SHOULD be kicked out of school.
Unfortunately, no judicial system
known to man is perfect.
Serious charges should yield serious
punishment, and this is all the more rea
son to protect the accused as much as
possible. Fortunately our nation's
founders understood that investigators
make mistakes and concluded that the
accused deserve as much protection as
possible.
This is not the first time this decade
that the committee has struggled with
the burden of proof issue. Five years ago,
the committee also toyed with the idea of
lowering the burden, not because of aca
demic cheating, but in order to improve
the conviction rate in sexual assault
cases.
Again, the more serious the alleged
crime, the more serious the punishment

should be. The more serious the punish
ment, the more important it is that we do
not convict the innocent. Remember that
if the burden of proof is lowered, it will be
lowered for all Fundamental Standard
cases.
As a student, the thought of being
expelled is almost worse than death, and
I'm not exaggerating. If I found myself
wrongfully convicted and expelled, virtu
ally every goal I've ever set for myself
would become unattainable, and my life
would lose much of its meaning. For this
reason, we must err on the side of cau
tion.
The committee should be praised, and
its recommendations speedily adopted.
They propose streamlining the process,
increasing the number of students in the
Judicial Panel Pool and eliminating the
arbitrary decisions regarding faculty
complaints by ensuring that all cases will
be heard. Nevertheless, any effort to
increase due process should not be
undermined by lowering the burden of
proof. The process should not be
derailed, but "reasonable doubt" is the
only reasonable option.

On a more serious note, Jim Finsten
would like to thank the football team for
helping erase painful memories of his
freshman year.
