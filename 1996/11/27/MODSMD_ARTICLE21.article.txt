Sand Hill projects force us to choose our values

TWO VALUE SYSTEMS .. . which
do we choose? As I sat and listened
to Stanford University's proposed
expansion plans being presented and dis
cussed by the Palo Alto City Council on
Monday, I experienced two value systems
in conflict. One value is concern for the
environment, nature, quality of life,
appreciation for the uniqueness of living
in this area with a deep desire to protect
and preserve the San Francisquito Creek

and the Ohlone Field as part of our his
tory and culture.
The other value is development,
money, promotion of high end shopping
for the wealthy, more is better.
What happened to the value of fami
ly, interest in the well-being of the
whole community, appreciation of
nature and our surroundings? Who
decides what values for the community
will be put forth — the individuals of

the community or the business leaders
and developers?
I invite the community to take an
active interest in what is being promoted
with the Sand Hill Corridor and all the
projects.
I was inspired to read about a commu
nity in Nantucket, Mass., where the peo
ple decided they didn't need or want a
certain shopping center and by their
involvement in city council meetings

they were able to put forth their values
and succeeded in being a vital part of the
decision-making process.
We need to do the same. We need to
come forth and speak from our hearts
about those values that are visionary and
life enhancing.
