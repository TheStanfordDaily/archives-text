# Athletic director responds to criticism of promotion practices
## 
### 
I have read with interest your Nov. 20
editorial ("Overpriced Tickets") concern
ing the lack of effective marketing of
Stanford athletics, especially Big Game. I
agree with the major thrust of the argu
ment: The Athletics Department must
do a better job of promoting our sports
program.
The department is committed to mak
ing our athletic contests accessible,
affordable and exciting. We are now
drawing plans up for next year's promo
tional efforts, and we appreciate any
ideas the Stanford community might
have regarding how we can do a better
job. Please drop me a note with any
ideas.
Our teams — your teams — work
hard and represent Stanford with dignity
and skill. They deserve both the Athlet
ics Department's best efforts to promote
them and the community's support.

Thanks for your constructive criticism
It is being listened to.
