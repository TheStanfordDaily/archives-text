# Finding my religion at Stanford Hillel
## 
### 
I read with great interest Garry
Grundy's column yesterday concerning
the lack of religious spirit at Stanford.
It seems that Grundy, who presumably
has a deeply religious background him
self, has trouble finding people at Stan
ford with whom to discuss and share his
religious beliefs.
As someone who has had just the
opposite experience, I disagree with him
that the "religious integrity of this
school is . . . in question."
I came to Stanford 4 1/2 years ago as
a doctoral student in chemistry with a
bare minimum of religious training or
belief. However, through the outreach
efforts of the Hillel on campus, I have
found myself attending religious events
with more interest and enthusiasm
than I have ever before in my life.

Hillel offers a multitude of happen
ings every week, including speeches,
movies and Shabbat dinners, as well as
services.
I have no doubt that without this
priceless resource at Stanford I would
not have been able to get back in touch
with my religion as I have since coming
here, and for that I am grateful.
I suspect that the discontent Grundy
associates with the lack of formal reli
gious efforts at Stanford is more appro
priately appreciated as an institutional
attempt to remain a secular university.
I, for one, favor this approach as it
allows all members of the Stanford com
munity the space and freedom to wor
ship in their own manner. That freedom
is not to be taken lightly, as historically
it has been the exception, not the rule,
especially for Jews throughout the
world.
I believe that if Grundy seeks reli
gious fulfillment at Stanford, there are
places where he can find it as long as
he's willing to go beyond the confines of
his dorm.
