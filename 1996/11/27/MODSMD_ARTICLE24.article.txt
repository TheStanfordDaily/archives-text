# That men are better at football is simply 'common sense'
## 
### 
Due to the impending nature of
Vanessa Hoppe's question (yesterday's
letter to the editor), I feel compelled to
reply. Her question: "Since Cal is our
rival (therefore clearly inferior) and
Cal Bears supposedly 'wear skirts' and
many women wear skirts, shall we
assume that the cheer implies that
women are inferior?"
Yes, for God's sake, they are. We are
talking about football! Put women on
the defensive line, and you'll see the
Weenies taking the Axe every year.
Doesn't anybody have any common
sense anymore? This new trend of com
plaining about everything to sound
interesting is annoying the hell out of
me! Three words for you people: Take
more classes!
