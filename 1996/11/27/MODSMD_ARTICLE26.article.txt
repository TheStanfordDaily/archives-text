# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Eating turkey and giving thanks to those who deserve it 
### 
YOU KNOW, IT'S been centuries
since that first Thanksgiving
between the Pilgrims and a band of
friendly, completely unsuspecting Native
Americans. Over the years (374, maybe?),
events of history become the stuff of leg
ends. No historian knows for certain exact
ly what was served at the very first
Thanksgiving meal or even what was sold
at the very first Day-After-Thanksgiving
Sale. Old traditions blend with the new.
Turkey and stuffing. Cranberries. Pump
kin pie. The Lions-Vikings game. "A Char
lie Brown Thanksgiving." Etc.
Truth be told, I doubt anyone still
grasps the true meaning of this great part
of our American heritage. Even the Amer
ican Heritage Dictionary defines "thanks
giving" as — and this here is really what it
says — "an act of giving thanks." (Hmm.
Would Mrs. Hagedorn let me get away with
a definition like that in fourth grade? I
think not.)
Short ar.d sweet, "giving thanks" is the
simple spirit of this holiday marked every

fourth Thursday of November, and we
should not let it die. Accordingly, I have
decided to let my last autumn contribution
to this page be an act of thanksgiving.
Thank you, Mom and Dad, for all the
support, emotionally, financially, patient
ly. Thanks for having the right answers
and for not asking the wrong questions.
Also, for doing my laundry and income tax.
Now, I hate writing thank-you notes as
much as the next guy. But it's good to show
a little appreciation where a little apprecia
tion is due. As bad as your day might have
been, I'm sure you smiled at least once or
twice. Do you remember why?
Thank you, Stanford Cardinal, for
whipping the Weenies with style. Thanks
for making us seniors' last Big Game our
best. Thank you, Cal students, for rushing
your own field after you lost and again con
firming what we've always known to be
true. Thank you, Stanford Band, for prov
ing irreverence is its own art form. Thank
you, President Casper and Dean Montoya,
for actually doing the Macarena.

You see, sometimes we Stanford stu
dents get too caught up in the things that
aren't going the way we want them to. But
despite all the bad, sometimes we just need
to stop and realize all the good that is ours.
Thank you, Dean Wais et al., for
answering a long-standing student
demand. Thank you, Polio's, for opening
on campus and for being so excited about it,
even though students will forget all a/x)ut
you before long. Thank you, Blooming
dale's, for bolstering our school's opulent
image.
So you have a midterm. At least it's not
snowing. That DR is getting in the way.
Just be thankful you're taking it P/NC.
Sure, the University has been cutting a lot
of majors, but they haven't yet cut yours.
So relax already, and give a little thanks.
Thank you, faculty, for bringing back
the "F" but never giving it out. Thank you
for those lectures and sections where we
actually learned something valuable fur
other classes, or even for real life!
Maybe it seems like Stanford ain't as

fun as it used to be. So you miss the days
when your RA would cite "tradition" as the
reason your frosh dorm's social budget
should be blown on booze. So it seems the
long arm of the law keeps getting longer.
Just remember, it could always be worse.
Thank you, Greek system, for being the
University's sacrificial lamb. As long as
they're busy with you, they can t bother us.
Thanks for throwing parties so we don't
have to.
Perhaps your big problem is that you're
feeling insignificant. Well, you are! Isn't
that good to know? AfU*r all, indifference
can be a terrible thing .. .
Thank you, U.S. News & World Report,
for rating us "like toasters." Thank you,
"corporate America,"for giving some stu
dents something to get excited and motivat
ed about. I mean it, you 're The Man.
Maybe you're a freshman and you're
feeling your first finals crunch. Relax, it's
the quarter system. Before you know it, it
will all be over — I mean, it will ALL be
over. Right, seniors?

Thank you, fellow seniors, for feeling
the same trepidation as we all enter the
next stage of existence. Thank you for feel
ing a sense of class spirit, or at least for fak
ing it. Whadda ya know? Pub Nites are
fun!
The bottom line is that everyone has
problems, and the point of Thanksgiving is
not so much to give thanks but to realize
that we have something to be thankful
everywhere we look. It's one of those holi
days that's around to remind people what
they should be doing everyday. Whenever
you get a little too stressed, relax. Sit down
and do a crossword puzzle and realize that
your problem-of-the-day is nothing com
pared to what the Pilgrims (or the Native
Americans!) had to go through.

Thank you, Stanford Daily, for printing
crossword puzzles everyday.
