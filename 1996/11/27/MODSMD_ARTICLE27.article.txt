Finding life on Mars
Discovering life on Mars may not be far away. Researchers at
Stanford's Space Telecommunications and Radio Science laboratory

conducted communication tests with the Mars Global
Surveyor spacecraft last Sunday.
The spacecraft will be used in the future to relay
signals from land vehicles on Mars to scientists here
on Earth. For the time being, however, the tests were
designed to make sure that the spacecraft could fulfill
this function.
Playing the role of a ground station on Mars, the

scientists used the satellite dish to beam communication signals to
the spacecraft.
Then, reverting back to its natural role of the planet Earth, the
scientists waited for the signals to be returned. If functioning prop
erly, the spacecraft will beam the signals back to Earth with the same
data that was originally sent up.
"We're very excited about this because we're using the dish in col
laboration with a wonderful event in the U.S. space program," said
Ivan Linscott, senior research associate at the laboratory. "It's the
return to Mars and the search for life on Mars."
Although the scientists did discover a slight problem with the
spacecraft, the tests were able to confirm that the spacecraft was
functioning correctly.
Updated results are available on the group's World Wide Web site
(http://nova.stanford.edu/projects/relay).
Sensors and sensibility
Researchers in the mechanics and computation division within
the Department of Materials Science and Engineering are studying

i the fracture of piezoelectric solids. From medical sono
grams to cars, these solids are found in electrical
devices as sensors.
Sensors are important in being able to detect
mechanical and electrical changes in a device. These
changes can then be acted on by the electrical device.
While these materials, such as quartz, have typical
ly been used as sensors, they are also prone to fracture

and therefore failure. The research group, led by Assoc. Mechanical
Engineering Prof. Hua-Jian Gao, seeks to better understand and
model the failure mechanisms in these piezoelectric materials.
"There are experimental observations and they seem rather baf
fling," said Materials Science and Engineering Prof. David Barnett.
"How can one model failure mechanisms in these materials and how
[can one] establish a better understanding why they behave the way
they do?"
