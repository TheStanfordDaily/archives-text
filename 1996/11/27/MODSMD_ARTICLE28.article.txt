# Thanksgiving foods fattening
## Nutritionists advise enjoyment with moderation 
### Rollin Hu 
Perhaps it's the festive
atmosphere or perhaps it's
something else, but for one
reason or another people tend
to turn into pigs when the
idays roll around. '
After all, one of the most
potent symbols of Thanksgiv
ing is none other than a beauti
fully decorated table loaded
with tasty but fattening treats.,
But with new statistics'
showing that Americans are
gaining weight, watching what
goes in the tummy on Turkey
Day should be high on every
one's list of priorities.
"Recent statistics showing t
that Americans appear to
increasingly overweight offer a
sobering reminder that few of
us can afford to put off good
eating habits," Stanford
Health Services Dietitian
JoAnn Hattner said in a press
release. <
Nutritionists and dietitians 1
offer some tips for feasting
wisely over the holidays.
• Don't lay on the butter
and sugar when cooking
the meal.
"The foods that are tradi
tionally eaten during
giving are very healthy foods
— turkey, for example. The
problem is we tend to butter up
and sweeten up everything . . .
which makes for a higher fat
meal," said Assoc. Human
Biology Prof. Gail Butterfield,
a nutritionist at the Palo Altc
Veterans' Hospital.
• Don't eat too much.
"We overeat," said Butter
field. "When I approach Thanks
giving, I think: I'm going to have
leftover everything ... so I don't
have to overeat."
• Take your time.
Butterfield suggested, "Eat
slowly, enjoy the conversation,

have a glass of wine, just take it
more slowly." People actually
eat less when they eat slowly,
she said.
• Give your stomach a rest
between parts of the meal.
"Take a break between dinner
and dessert," recommended But
terfield. "It gives everything a
chance to settle. It gives your
body a chance to digest the food

that is already there."
Resting between portions of
the meal allows messages from
the body to be received correctly
by the brain. That way, your
brain knows how much dessert
you can take without overstuff
ing yourself.
• Skipping dessert alto
gether may even be a good
idea.

Hattner suggested that
adding dessert to an already
calorie-excessive meal can
j cause problems. "Adding an
i eighth of a pecan pie with a
1 half-cup of rich vanilla ice
cream on top is equal to
nearly 700 calories — about
the same as many complete
meals," she said.
• Avoid fatty or high
i calorie foods, but make
sure you know what
these are.
Most people would think
that gravy has more calo
\ ries than cranberry sauce,
*but cranberry sauce has
I more than twice as many
calories.
A cup of cranberry sauce
is about 418 calories, while
a cup of chicken gravy is
only 188 calories. Beef and
i mushroom gravies have
J even fewer calories.
» "Don't think you're
doing yourself a favor by
eliminating gravy only to
slather on a lot of cranberry
sauce," Hattner said.
• If you truly want to
(ignore your conscience
; and follow your stomach
on Thanksgiving Day,
just remember to eat
sensibly on other days.
"With some precautions,
do enjoy yourself at celebra
tions on the actual holidays,
but stick to prudent nutri
tion on other days," said
Hattner.

Butterfield agreed.
"The most important thing is
to enjoy [the meal]. I'm serious.
Just enjoy yourself. It's OK to
hinge from time to time. To limit
yourself at a time like this is not
appropriate," she said. "Limit
yourself the rest of the time. I
always tell my students,
'Remember-moderation in all
things, including moderation.' "
