It may not stretch the imagina

Assoc. Music Prof. Julius Smith
plays the guitar and keyboard in a
progressive rock band that does
originals and remakes of great
classics. But how does that relate
to science?
Smith, who has a doctorate in
electrical engineering, has com
bined his interests as a faculty
member of the Center for Comput
er Research in Music and Acous
tics. In his research group, he
advises about 12 graduate stu
dents, most of whom are doctoral
students in electrical engineering.
The center is a "multidisci
plinary facility where composers
and researchers work together
using computer-based technology
both as an artistic medium and as
a research tool," according to its
site on the World Wide Web.
The center consists of students
and faculty from not only the
departments of music and electri
cal engineering but also from
mechanical engineering, computer
science and psychology.
The various areas of ongoing
research at the center include com
position, synthesis techniques and
algorithms, physical modeling, sig
nal processing, digital recording
and editing, psychoacoustics and
musical acoustics and real-time
applications and controllers.
Melding together electrical
engineering and music, these
research projects take advantage
of these developing technologies.
One project is concentrating on
building an electronic instrument
that can reproduce sound for
which the human ear is not able to
distinguish from the real ones.
Tremendous progress has been
achieved in this area.
"Around 90 percent of the peo
ple would not be able to distin

guish a real piano from one that
was simulated on [our] electronic
synthesizer," said Smith.
Similar progress has been made
with respect to electric guitars.
This research has provided foun
dations for the development of
musical instruments in industry.
The Pad Master, which is able to
sense the movement of a conduc
tor's baton, includes a computer
attached to a drum-like instru
ment. Through common connect
ing hardware, the radio drum com
municates with the computer and
sends positional and velocity infor
mation when either of two batons
hits the surface of the drum.
Apart from this information,
the computer also polls the drum
to determine the absolute position
of the batons. This information is

used to split the surface of the
drum into up to 30 virtual pads of
variable size, each one indepen
dently programmable by the per
former.
The Pad Master is then able to
react in a specific way to a hit and
to the position information
stream. Each information stream
then becomes specialized to pro
duce a specific type of sound.
The Synthßuilder computer
program allows its user to define,
modify and store sounds ranging
from movie sound effects to those
from an instrument.
Another project involves "devel
oping a voice transformation sys
tem that makes the transformed
voice close to a natural voice of the
