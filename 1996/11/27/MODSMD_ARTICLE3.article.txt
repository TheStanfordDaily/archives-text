Deputy Director Sidney Drell received the
Gian Carlo Wick Commemorative Medal last
week for his lifetime achievements in parti
cle physics and research aimed at nuclear
weapons reduction.
The award, from the World Federation of
Scientists, was founded in memory of
renowned physicist Gian Carlo Wick, who
died four years ago. Drell is only the third
person to receive the honor.

The official citation,
which Drell received along
with a gold medal in Lau
sanne, Switzerland, attrib
uted "his many outstand
ing contributions to parti
cle physics and ... his un
ceasing efforts to reduce the
risk of nuclear weapons."
Retired SLAC Director
Wolfgang Panofsky, who

first met Drell in 1951, said Drell has made
mqjor contributions to the theory of quan
tum electrodynamics and has remained very
active as a theorist, despite his responsibili
ties to the public.
"He's had a highly distinguishable duel
career, both as a statesman of science and as
a theoretical physicist," Panofsky said.
Panofsky also happened to be in Switzer
land for a conference when Drell was there to
receive the award.
"We've both gotten quite a few prizes so
it'B gotten kind of late in life to get excited,"
he said, adding, however, that the award is a
honor."
While Drell also described the award as an
honor, he said it took on a special sign ificance
for him.

"I knew Prof. Wick and I admire him as a
very creative physicist and as a creative per
son of principle. He's one of the heroes,"
Drell said, adding that he admires Wick for
his "principle, character [and for being a]
great scientist."
However, Drell said he could not "charac
terize himself."
"I do what I think is right," he said. "I've
never sat down and said what the top 10 and
the bottom 10 of my achievements are."
Among the Princeton University gradu
ate's many accomplishments are publishing
three books and numerous papers in theo
retical physics and playing a large part in the
research that eventually led to the United
States' signing of a nuclear weapons test ban
treaty.
Drell credited a "great teacher" for his
passion in physics and said he has tried to be
as motivational in his teaching career.
"Any teacher tries his very best to inspire
his students â€” that's responsibility," he
said.
Although he is not teaching anymore,
Drell keeps very busy working with SLAC
and with the federal government in arms
control.
"One's always balancing," he said, adding
that he enjoys his work. "One doesn't do
work like this to get an award."
In addition to balancing his government
work with SLAC research, Drell said he finds
time for several pastimes, rooting for several
college football teams as well as the 49ers.
"He's a very personable gentleman, good
family man and ei\joys baseball. What else
can I say?" Panofsky said.
Drell said that although the award "rec
ognizes his work has special respect," he does
it because he er\joys it.
"I just do what I do," Drell said.
