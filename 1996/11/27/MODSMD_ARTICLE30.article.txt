## Overcoming adversity Attention deficit disorder no match for student 
### Anne Ruimy Contributing writer 
Getting double the time to
complete exams, a distraction
free room and the privilege to
reschedule an exam when more
than one is scheduled for the
same day may seem like an
extravagant privilege to most stu
dents.
For Marc Goormastic, a junior
with a learning disability, this
accomodation is essential in
achieving grades that reflect his
knowledge of physics and math,
the two subjects in which he is
majoring.
Suffering from Attention
Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD), Goormastic is easily dis
tracted, particularly by sounds.
Because even the library is full
of sounds that he can not tune
out — people opening and closing
doors, walking by or turning the
pages of books — he spends a lot
of time trying to find a quiet place
to study.
"That's also why I never go to
classes. The fact that | professors]
are talking is distracting," he
said. Instead, he teaches himself
completely out of books and lec
ture notes.
During the first quarter of his
freshman year at Stanford, Goor
mastic was studying constantly,
sometimes going to bed at 6 a.m.
and waking up two hours later to
study again. Then he turned to
Cowell Student Health Center
looking for help for what he
thought was a sleep disorder.
When told that, in fact, he had
ADHD, his first reaction was
shock.
Like many people, he did not
think ADHD was real.

"I was kind of irritated," he
said. "I thought ADHD was a
cheesy excuse for not wanting to
study." There was now, however,
a name for his life-long problem
with concentration.
It is hard to understand what
goes on in his head when he does
a physics or a math problem,
Goormastic said.
"One thing that is clear is that
my thinking is not linear," he
said. "Even if I know how to do it,
a lot of things will occur to me
before the right answer."
What causes ADHD is not
completely understood. Accord
ing to Clinical Asst. Pyschiatry
Prof. Alan Brauer, director of
Total Care Medical Center in Palo
Alto, several theories locate the
problem in the frontal lobes of
the brain.
"Frontal lobes are critical for

the concentration," he said.
"When people have difficulty con
centrating, frontal lobes are
underacting. When there is exces
sive concentration, they are over
acting." Treatment is often based
on prescribing stimulants, such
as Ritalin, which improve the bal
ance of two neurotransmitters
involved in the activity of the
frontal lobes.
While treatments exist, there
is no cure for ADHD. "When
you've got it, you've got it,"
Brauer said. "You have to keep
taking medication."
Unfortunately, medication
does not provide the perfect solu
tion either.
"I didn't suddenly pop a pill in
my mouth and reorganize my
room," Goormastic said. "The

Outside of his studies, Goormastic also plays chess with the Car
dinal Chess Club. He recently competed in his first chess com
petition.
