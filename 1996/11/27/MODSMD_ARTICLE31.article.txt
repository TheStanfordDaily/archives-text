Q.Does cramming for exams
•really work ?
A .There are lota of theories on
• how memory works, but it is
generally agreed that people forget
things.
At first, it seems pretty stupid
that you would forget things. A
good memory seems like it would

be an advantage, especially when
humans had to recall things like,
"Remember not to go into the tar
pits because eveiyone you know
who has tried to in the past is no
longer alive."
If you think about it, though,
there are some advantages to hav
ing a memory which forgets. The
fading of memories probably helps
in placing them in a proper context
in time. Furthermore, adapting to
new environments is aided by the

withering of old memories.
A lesson learned in the past may
no longer apply in the future. It
would be too confusing trying to
decide which memories were newer
and more appropriate if they all
had the same precedence in your
mind. If you were being chased by a
bear toward the tar pits, it would
take too long to try and decide
which memory was more recent —
"The tar pits will kill you" or "The
tar pits have dried up now."

One theory of human memory
posits that there are two types of
memory, short-term memory and
long-term memory.
In an average human being,
short-term memory is thought to

last only about 10 seconds to 15
seconds if the information is not
rehearsed. This means that if you
are given something to remember
