Q.Does cramming for exams
•really work ?
A .There are lota of theories on
• how memory works, but it is
generally agreed that people forget
things.
At first, it seems pretty stupid
that you would forget things. A
good memory seems like it would

be an advantage, especially when
humans had to recall things like,
"Remember not to go into the tar
pits because eveiyone you know
who has tried to in the past is no
longer alive."
If you think about it, though,
there are some advantages to hav
ing a memory which forgets. The
fading of memories probably helps
in placing them in a proper context
in time. Furthermore, adapting to
new environments is aided by the

withering of old memories.
A lesson learned in the past may
no longer apply in the future. It
would be too confusing trying to
decide which memories were newer
and more appropriate if they all
had the same precedence in your
mind. If you were being chased by a
bear toward the tar pits, it would
take too long to try and decide
which memory was more recent —
"The tar pits will kill you" or "The
tar pits have dried up now."

One theory of human memory
posits that there are two types of
memory, short-term memory and
long-term memory.
In an average human being,
short-term memory is thought to

last only about 10 seconds to 15
seconds if the information is not
rehearsed. This means that if you
are given something to remember


The Science Bug
in your short-term memory and
you don't think about it, it will
only stay for about 10 seconds.
Moreover, short-term memory
seems only to be able to hold about
seven pieces of information,
which is good when you're trying
to remember someone's phone
number, unless that person lives
in another area code.
In order for you to recall any
thing beyond that short amount
of time, the information needs to
be encoded into long-term memo
ry. Long-term memory, as indicat
ed by its name, lasts much longer
than short-term memory. Unfor
tunately, getting information into
long-term memory is not always
an easy process.

For long-term memory to be of
any use, information has to pass
from short-term into long-term
memory and be easily retrieved at
a later point in time.
This is not as simple as it
sounds. Many, many studies have
been conducted by many, many
psychologists to determine what
methods are most useful in encod
ing information in long-term
memory.
It has been found that just
plain repetition of information is
not a very good way of remember
ing it. Instead, thinking about and
trying to understand the informa
tion and connecting it with memo
ries already encoded in the brain is
much more productive.
Recall of information is also as
sisted by context — the conditions
under which information was en
coded provide strong cues for re
calling the information. Studies

have shown that students can re
member slightly better when test
ed in the class where the course
was taught, as opposed to when
tested in a different location. This
means you should probably show
up to class every once in a while.
Well, great. Maybe next quarter
I'll start studying more effectively,
but what about now? I've got two
weeks to learn the names of the
pets of all the members of Congress
since 1920, and I just don't have the
time. Will cramming work?
Unfortunately for teachers
who care about memory reten
tion, cramming does produce suf
ficient recall over a span of a day
or two, but retention beyond that
is severely limited. Although
spreading out studying periods
helps recall, when you're in a
clinch and need to remember
something the next day, cram
ming does work.
