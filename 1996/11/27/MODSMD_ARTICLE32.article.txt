Clowning around goes too far
After a bizarre chase, Brian Jay Meador, a 21-
year-old Stanford student, was cited Nov. 3 for re
sisting and delaying arrest, Stanford Police Capt
Raoul Niemeyer said.
Stanford Police Lt. Nick Brunot first noticed
Meador, who was dressed in a clown costume and
wearing a wig, when he was riding on the back of a
moped at the intersection of Mayfield Avenue and
Lasuen Mall.
The driver of the moped, Niemeyer said, was
driving recklessly down the sidewalk toward
Braun Music Center at a high speed with his legs
dangling.
Niemeyer said that the moped, in an attempt to
evade police, "maneuvered around a jump post and
took off" when Brunot spotted it.
According to Niemeyer, when police again en
countered the moped between the Bookstore and
Meyer Library, "The clown bailed and ran off at
full speed toward Stern Hall. The moped took off."
Police continued to chase Meador through the
area around Stern Hall and Wilbur Hall.
When police saw Meador back at Stern, Niemey
er said Meador had "taken off everything and
stuffed it in his shirt, giving him the appearance of
having a big belly."
Stanford Police Sgt. Tim Hanrahan finally
found Meador hiding under a car in the Toyon Hat
ing Clubs parking lot.
According to Niemeyer, Meador was "somewhat
inebriated at the time."
Niemeyer said that, in addition to beinL' cited,

Meador's clown costume has been confiscated for
evidence.
Tal vandals hit Stanford
Pre-Big Game enthusiasm led some overzealous
Cal fans to vandalism last week — not only of the
Tree but also of University property.
According to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, at about 2:15 a.m. Thursday, Stanford
Community Service Officer Robert North noticed
that his service vehicle had been vandalized.
The words "Go Bears" were painted on the pas
senger-side door. "Cal" also appeared on the tail
gate, the driver's-side door and the top of the tool
box in blue and gold paint.
Niemeyer said only 20 minutes later, 18-year
old Darek Joe of UC-Berkeley was observed paint
ing "Go Cal" on a Stern Hall directional sign.
When apprehended, Joe had paint cans in his
possession. Niemeyer said that at first, Joe
claimed he was an extension student at Stanford
and that his sister went to UC-Berkeley.
After searching Joe's backpack and finding the
paint, Joe admitted to being a student at UC-
Berkeley.
Niemeyer said a friend of Joe's, who was dri
ving around campus, was stopped with paint in his
car.
Stanford Deputy Sharon Donaldson cited Joe
for vandalism.
According to Niemeyer, "Vandalism is common
during [Big Game] week. A few years ago, there
was extensive painting in the Rodin Sculpture
Garden."
