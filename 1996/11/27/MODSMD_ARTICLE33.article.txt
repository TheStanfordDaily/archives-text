## Wrestlers suffer off night, fall to San Fran State 
### Jeff Ellingson Contributing writer 
Plagued by difficult breaks
in overtime and several tough
losses, the Cardinal wrestling
team fell victim in a close
matchup last night against
the San Francisco State
Gators.
As Stanford coach Chris
Horpel said before the match,
"It's probably going to come
down to the close matches."
Last night those close matches
cost the Cardinal the victory.
"This is probably the best
team San Francisco State has
had in years," Horpel said.
"Although our team is very
young, we were hoping to off
set our inexperience with the
great attitude we carried away
from the Southern Oregon
Open tournament last week
end. Beating San Francisco
State would have been an
upset."
Unfortunately, the Cardi
nal squad's enthusiasm was
not enough to overcome the
seventh-ranked Division II
Gator team, which beat Stan
ford 19-12.
The Gators jumped to an
early lead of 4-0 at the 118-
pound weight class, with
Damon Broadbent winning a
major decision over Cardinal
freshman Rudy Ruiz.
At 126 pounds, sophomore
Zach Zimmerer lost a close
match in overtime to his oppo
nent, 11-9. Substituting for
Robert Hatta — who was out
with a shoulder injury — was
sophomore Frank Ruiz, who
earned points for riding time
against his opponent to win 3-
2.
The match of the night for
the Cardinal was at 142

pounds, where sophomore
Warren McPhearson earned a
tremendous victory of 9-4 over
All-American Steve Hilas. "I
gave him some points I
shouldn't have given him,"
McPhearson said. "But I lis
tened to what coach Horpel
was telling me, and he coached
me well."
"Although [ Hilas 1 came out
aggressive, I stayed calm and
tried not to lose my head or
my wrestling style — it pulled
through for me in the end,"
McPhearson said. "I'm a little
disappointed that we couldn't
pull [the team win) off, but we
lost a lot of close ones."
Sophomore B.J. Sanchez
also won his match 6-0 at 150
pounds to briefly put Stanford
ahead 9-7. "I felt pretty strong
on top and on my feet,"
Sanchez said. "Seeing Warren
win his match before me real
ly pumped me up."
The Cardinal winning
streak ended at the 158-pound
weight class despite the best
efforts of senior Ryan Barnes,
who lost by a narrow margin
to Greg Jackson 11-9. Jeff
Grant also lost a close match
3-2 at 167 pounds.
The Cardinal trailed by one
again after junior Scott Chap
man solidly beat his opponent
7-1 to make the team score 13-
12.
Another difficult loss for
the Cardinal occurred at 190
pounds as senior Brian Vani
man grappled with longtime
rival Lee Lofton to a close
overtime finish of 6-4. In the
heavyweight class, senior
Chris Serjak lost his match 5-
2 against Christian Wellisch.
"Although the only thing
that will really affect our stand
ings are the Pac-10 tournament
and conference championships
at the end of the season, our
inexperience showed up
tonight," Horpel said. "Howev
er, to look on the bright side, we
weren't out of it in any match."
"It felt like we should have
won, but we didn't," McPhear
son said. "We dominated most of
the matches, looked like we were

going to win, but in the end we
were down on points. Although
our youth is definitely a factor, I
think this will slowly be erased
as the season goes on."
Looking to the future, the
Cardinal will face Portland State
and Oregon State in Corvallis in
a dual meet this Friday.
"We should beat Portland
State, but Oregon State will be
difficult," Horpel said.
"Oregon State will be another
good test for us," Sanchez said.
"I think a lot of guys are going to
bounce back from tonight, so I'm
excited about it."
