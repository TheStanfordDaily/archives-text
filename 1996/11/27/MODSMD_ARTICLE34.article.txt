# Volleyball wins close final match
## Oral Roberts is good early but Card wins 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The second-ranked Stanford women's vol
leyball team (26-2) survived an early scare to
record its 46th consecutive home win
against No. 23 Oral Roberts (26-4) last night
14-16, 17-15, 15-6, 15-4.
The Cardinal came out of the blocks a lit
tle flat, as the Stanford players suffered
from some poor passing in game one. How
ever, numerous serving errors by the Golden
Eagles cost them and helped the Cardinal to
a 9-5 lead.
Some timely serving and hitting from
junior outside hitter Kristin Folkl gave the
Card a 13-7 lead. Then crafty setter Lisa
Sharpley fooled everybody in the gym by pre
tending to set an errant pass. The ball was
hit far enough to make it over the net
untouched, and Sharpley let it land in front
of the surprised Golden Eagles' defense for a
Stanford point.
But with the game on the line, Oral
Roberts fought off several game points and
gradually chipped away at the Stanford lead.
Before the Card knew it, the Golden Eagles
had tied the game 14-14, causing Stanford to
call timeout.
"I didn't call timeout earlier for two rea
sons," Stanford coach Don Shaw said. "First
of all, I have confidence that this team can
work its way out if it. Secondly, a little scare
might be the best thing for us."
It was too late for the Card to recover
though, and Oral Roberts shocked Stanford
16-14.
Oral Roberts continued where it left off in
the second game, jumping out to an early 3-
1 lead. Things continued to look bleak for
the Card, as the Golden Eagles ran up a 6-2
score. Stanford seemed unable to stop the
Oral Roberts express, as it moved out to a
10-5 lead.
But Stanford is the second-ranked team
in the country for a reason. The Card made a
gut check and played its heart out, as fresh
man outside hitter Kerri Walsh contributed
some key hitting and blocking to help Stan
ford tie the match at 12-12 late in the second
game.
Walsh simply dominated on defense, sti
fling several consecutive Golden Eagle
attacks. But the Golden Eagles would not go
away. They stormed back, gaining a 15-14
advantage.
With its back to the wall, the Cardinal
once again relied on Walsh, who made a cru

cial kill to earn a sideout and then served out
the game, giving Stanford a 17-15 victory.
"We have been working on blocking a lot,"
Walsh said. "I am glad it is paying off."
The Cardinal came out of the break ready
to play, and suddenly, Oral Roberts did not
look so good. Behind the hitting of Folkl and
junior outside hitter Debbie Lambert, Stan
ford jumped out to a 5-0 lead.
The size advantage that Stanford held
over the Golden Eagles became more glaring
in the third game, as senior middle blocker
Eileen Murfee, Walsh and Folkl all denied
the Oral Roberts offense access to the Cardi
nal side of the net.
Stanford played like the championship
contender it is, crushing Oral Roberts 15-6.
In the fourth game, the Cardinal offen
sive machine went into overdrive, as floor

leader Sharpley engineered a 7-1 lead. Walsh
once again played a phenomenal game,
seeming to be involved in every play. The
Card simply overpowered the Golden Eagles,
finishing the match with an impressive 15-4
game-four win.
Stanford closed out a perfect home regu
lar season with the win. Earlier in the day,
four Cardinal players, Folkl, Murfee, Walsh
and Sharpley, earned All-Pac-10 honors
while junior middle blocker Barbara Ifejika
received honorable mention. Walsh also was
named Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. Fresh
man outside hitter Jaimi Gregory received
honorable mention for the all-freshman
team.
"It is a great honor," Walsh said "It is
nice to know that people think highly of me
It is a great compliment."
