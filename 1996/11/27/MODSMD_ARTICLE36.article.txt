# Conference tourney key for water polo's future in postseason
## 
### Rustan Eklund Contributing writer 
The second annual Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation water
polo tournament begins tomor
row, and as the No. 1 seed, the
pressure is on for the Stanford
men.
After an unexpected loss last
weekend at No. 4 California, the
Card travels back to the Spieker
Aquatics Complex looking for vin
dication and a strong first-round
performance.
With the loss last weekend at
Big Splash, the Card needs to win
the tournament outright to be
assured of a bid to the NCAA
tournament played the following
weekend. And though it owns the
No. 1 seed, winning won't be
easy.
As the home for the each of the
top six teams in the country, the
MPSF tournament proves to
have tougher competition than
even the NCAA Championships
and will likely be the battle
ground for the best collegiate
water polo action of the year.
"This tournament is by far
much tougher than the national
championships," said Stanford
head coach Dante Dettamanti. "If
you get into NCAAs as part of our
conference, you're almost guar
anteed second place."
That is indeed the case, as the
NCAA tournament and its team
selection process have been
revised recently. Just three years
ago, five teams in the MPSF con
ference were invited to the

national championships, and the
end-of-year conference tourna
ment did not exist
So for the top teams in the
country, the regular-season
games proved to be of little conse
quence so long as a team was
assured a bid as one of the top five
teams in the conference.
But all that changed in 1995,
as the invitation process was
revised with the intent of expand
ing the sport to a more national
level. At that point in time, water
polo programs on the East Coast
struggled to attract top talent,
and a sixth-place finish at NCAAs
proved to be nearly the best possi
ble outcome for non-West Coast
teams.
By placing a two-team limit on
the MPSF, currently home to
nearly all of the current top-10
teams in the country, the whole
focus for both regular season and
postseason play has shifted.
Now the emphasis for MPSF
teams is placed on regular-season
conference games which count
toward an all-important confer
ence record. A 7-1 performance,
including wins over then-No. 1
USC and third-ranked UCLA
gave Stanford the top seed in the
tournament despite a No. 2
national ranking.
To add to the suspense the
tournament provides, the winner
of this weekend's tournament
will be given one of the two covet
ed bids to NCAAs, regardless of
conference record The MPSF
team with the best overall record
(subject to factors such as diffi
culty of schedule, head-to-head
performance and league ranking)
will be given the second bid.
What it all boils down to is
that as the No. 1 seed Stanford
has the best draw and therefore
the best chance to win the tour
nament, but with a 16-6 record,
the likelihood of an at-large bid
should the Cardinal not win is
very small.
"We're preparing for this like

we would the national champi
onships," Dettamanti said. "We've
been fine-tuning our play for each
of the offensive and defensive
strategies that we'll see in the
tournament."
The way the draw shakes out
for the Cardinal, it will face the
No. 8-seeded team on Friday at 3
p.m., which will be determined
Thursday afternoon in a playoff
between the sixth- through
ninth-ranked teams in the con
ference. Because there are nine
teams in the conference, the bot
tom four have a playoff to deter
mine the last three seeds.
That being the situation, the
Cardinal will most likely face off

against UC-Santa Barbara or
Long Beach State in its first
round matchup. A win in that
game means that the Cardinal
will face the winner of the UC-
Irvine-Cal game on Saturday at 3
p.m. And given the exceptional
play of the Bears in Big Splash,
the Card could have a chance to
get its revenge en route to the
final.
Ironic as it may be, last year
the Cardinal triumphed in Big
Splash only to watch in disgust as
Cal won the conference tourna
ment and finished second in the
NCAA tournament. In that light,
last week's loss at Cal could just
be part of a plan.
