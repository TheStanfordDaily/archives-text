# Conference tourney key for water polo's future in postseason
##

The second annual Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation water
polo tournament begins tomor
row, and as the No. 1 seed, the
pressure is on for the Stanford
men.
After an unexpected loss last
weekend at No. 4 California, the
Card travels back to the Spieker
Aquatics Complex looking for vin
dication and a strong first-round
performance.
With the loss last weekend at
Big Splash, the Card needs to win
the tournament outright to be
assured of a bid to the NCAA
tournament played the following
weekend. And though it owns the
No. 1 seed, winning won't be
easy.
As the home for the each of the
top six teams in the country, the
MPSF tournament proves to
have tougher competition than
even the NCAA Championships
and will likely be the battle
ground for the best collegiate
water polo action of the year.
"This tournament is by far
much tougher than the national
championships," said Stanford
head coach Dante Dettamanti. "If
you get into NCAAs as part of our
conference, you're almost guar
anteed second place."
That is indeed the case, as the
NCAA tournament and its team
selection process have been
revised recently. Just three years
ago, five teams in the MPSF con
ference were invited to the

national championships, and the
end-of-year conference tourna
ment did not exist
So for the top teams in the
country, the regular-season
games proved to be of little conse
quence so long as a team was
assured a bid as one of the top five
teams in the conference.
But all that changed in 1995,
as the invitation process was
revised with the intent of expand
ing the sport to a more national
level. At that point in time, water
polo programs on the East Coast
struggled to attract top talent,
and a sixth-place finish at NCAAs
proved to be nearly the best possi
ble outcome for non-West Coast
teams.
By placing a two-team limit on
the MPSF, currently home to
nearly all of the current top-10
teams in the country, the whole
focus for both regular season and
postseason play has shifted.
Now the emphasis for MPSF
teams is placed on regular-season
conference games which count
toward an all-important confer
ence record. A 7-1 performance,
including wins over then-No. 1
USC and third-ranked UCLA
gave Stanford the top seed in the
tournament despite a No. 2
national ranking.
To add to the suspense the
tournament provides, the winner
of this weekend's tournament
will be given one of the two covet
ed bids to NCAAs, regardless of
conference record The MPSF
