# Men's and women's hoops depart for faraway places
## Women on the road for the first time in Wahine Classic 
### Robin Davidson Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
After impressively winning its
first three home games, the No. 1
Stanford women's basketball team
(3-0) has decided to do a little trav
eling. Destination — warm,
sunny, tropical Honolulu.
But the Card doesn't intend to
bask in the sun on Hawaiian
beaches until after it wipes out the
competition at the Hawaiian Air
lines Rainbow Wahine Classic, an
annual tournament of eight teams.
Stanford will face Houston (1-0) in
the first round on Friday at 11:15
a.m. Other teams in the tourney
are No. 25 Stephen F. Austin,
Miami (Ohio), Michigan, Virginia
Tech, Pittsburgh and Hawaii.
"It's good to put us in situations
where we don't have that extra
sixth man-type thing," said junior
forward Vanessa Nygaard. "It'll be
a good challenge to play on the
road. I know it's kind of bad timing
for school. I know a lot of people
have work."
But the teams in this year's
classic aren't as competitive as they
were the last time the Cardinal
participated in the tournament.
That was in the 1992-93 season,
and Stanford, a preseason favorite
for back-to-back NCAA titles, lost
the final game to then-No. 2 Ten
nessee in an overtime battle 74-73.
"The level of competition at this
point, while it's very, very competi
tive, it's not like they have an
Alabama or a Tennessee," said
head coach Tara VanDerveer. "But
I would expect that Stephen F.
Austin is a really competitive team.
Hawaii also plays well there. I
don't really know that much about
Houston, which is our first oppo
nent. I really focus on our team."
The Cardinal is a hands-down
favorite in the tournament and is
expected to have little trouble with
the Lady Cougars, who now hail
from Conference USA. Houston's
only previous game this season was
against Texas Southern on Satur
day, and it won that contest 86-54
despite 38 turnovers thanks to the
work of junior Mia McCoy and

freshman Tracy Allen, neither of
whom are starters. Last year,
Houston finished 12-16 and 4-10 in
the now-defunct Southwest Con
ference, nearly upsetting Texas
Tech in the SWC tournament
semifinals.
McCoy, a transfer from Trinity
Valley Community College, was a
member of the 1996 Junior College
National Champions, In Houston's
first game she came off the bench
against Texas Southern to score a
game-high 20 points.
At 6-foot-6, Allen adds some
much needed height to the Cougar
squad whose tallest starter is listed
at 6-0. In her first collegiate game
Allen pulled down a game-high 13
rebounds.
"We don't know much about
them," Nygaard said. "It doesn't
really change our game plan. With
Purdue, coming in we [knew] noth
ing about them since they had basi
cally a brand new team."
One thing the Cardinal hopes to
do this week is get more production
out of its bench. Against Purdue
last weekend all but four points
were scored by the starting five,
and those four came in the last 2
minutes.
"We're playing three games in
three days," VanDerveer said. "It
should give us an opportunity to
play a lot of different people, and I
hope they play well."
At this point in the season, only
48 of the team's 253 points have
come from the bench, almost half
of which belong to junior forward
Heather Owen. The starters,
meanwhile, are racking up impres
sive stats with four of the five aver
aging double figures in scoring.
Junior post Olympia Scott leads
the way with team high averages in
both scoring and rebounding with
18.7 points and 8.7 boards per
game. Senior guard Kate Starbird
is next with 16 points and an
impressive six assists per game
while senior guard Jamila Wide
man has 2.3 steals per game.
The Cardinal's post play has
been particularly impressive
throughout the first three games.
Scott, Nygaard and Owen are
joined by junior forward Naomi

Mulitauaopele to help guide Stan
ford's post game. This quartet has
combined for 52.7 points and 26.4
rebounds per game this season and
made the Cardinal's post play a
more dominating threat than it
has been in recent years.
Add that to the potent shooting

from Stiinford's guards, the Cardi
nal's stifling defense and the teams
tiring transition game and you've
got a well rounded team that's
ready to play.
But for a team with high aspira
