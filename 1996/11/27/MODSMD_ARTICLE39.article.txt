# Alaska tournament could provide big competition
## 
### Bobby Cuza Staff writer 
No die-hard Stanford basketball
fan can help but dream it...
Saturday night, prime time. A
packed house at Sullivan Arena in
Anchorage, Alaska. Stanford meets
defending national champion Ken
tucky before a national television
audience, with a shot at college bas
ketball's elite, a chance to make
headlines, an opportunity to prove
to the nation that the Cardinal, at
long last, is truly a force to be reck
oned with in men's hoops.
If it sounds far-fetched, it
shouldn't. With wins over North
Carolina-Greensboro tonight and
the winner of Arizona State-Col
lege of Charleston on Friday, coach
Mike Montgomery's Cardinal
would clinch a berth in the fmal of
the Great Alaska Shootout Satur
day night on ESPN, with the likely
opponent either eighth-ranked
Kentucky or No. 12 Syracuse, last
year's national runner-up.
Just don't ask him about it.
"If I'm superstitious, that's one
area that I am," Montgomery said.
"I really think that if you start
looking ahead, that's where you're
gonna get clipped.
"And the amount of time that
we would have to prepare for who
ever we play second- or third-round
is limited anyway, so you don't
think too much about that."
All told, six of the tournament's
eight teams made it to postseason
play last year. Stanford, Kentucky,
Syracuse and UNC-Greensboro all
earned trips to NCAAs, College of
Charleston played in the NIT and
Alaska-Anchorage played in the
NCAA Division II Tournament.
What does that mean for a Stan
ford team that hasn't opened the
season away from home since
1988? Well, one thing is for certain:
This tournament is no small fry —
unlike the Fry's Invitational,
where the Cardinal opened regu
lar-season play the past three sea
sons against the likes of Stetson
and Colgate.
"One [difference] is, you're on
the road vs. being at home, and
that's huge. We've always started

at home," Montgomery said. "The
potential of playing a very good
team is here, and that's always a
great challenge and a great oppor
tunity. You don't always get that,
but you're typically gonna get it in
a tournament of this level."
After six weeks of going at it
against one another in practice, the
21st-ranked Cardinal is anxious to
meet a real opponent. It will get one
in UNC-Greensboro, a team that
won the Big South Conference
tournament last season and earned
a trip to the NCAA Southeast
Regional, losing to Cincinnati 66-
51 in the first round. The Spartans
(0-1) are anchored by point guard
Derrick Nix, who nearly set an
NCAA record last year by drilling
11 straight three-pointers.
The 6-foot-2 Nix could make
things a little hairy for senior
Brevin Knight, Stanford's diminu
tive All-American point guard who
measures just under 5-10. Knight
is still on the rebound from a case
of tendinitis in his right knee that
he suffered 2 1/2 weeks ago, but
Stanford supporters are keeping
their fmgers crossed that Knight's
soreness won't throw a wrench
into their pipe dream.
"Three games in a row is going
to be tough for him," Montgomery
said. "The one thing that was obvi
ous |in last week's exhibition win
over Chinal is that his timing is a
little bit off, and he was out of
shape.
"We've kind of got a mixed bag
there — we can't run him as hard
as we need to run him to get him in
shape because that's not what his
knee needs."
Nonetheless, Knight should be
good to go tonight for the Cardinal,
which figures to field a starting
lineup of Knight, sophomore guard
Kris Weems, junior forward Pete
Van Elswyk, senior forward Rich
Jackson and redshirt sophomore
center Tim Young.
"I think we feel good enough
about our team right now that we
have a good chance to win all our
preseason games," Knight said.
Pretty lofty aspirations, consid
ering the not-unlikely possibility
that Stanford will be tipping off
against the national champs in less
than 72 hours.
Montgomery, of course, remains

grounded in the present tense. He'll
leave the dreaming to newspaper
writers and Sixth Man Clubbers.
"At this point," he said, "we're
just trying to get some game expe
rience, trying to win a couple of
games, see if we can't get off to a
good start."
The rest, presumably, will take
care of itself.
