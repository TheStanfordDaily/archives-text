## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
ASSU President Bill Shen pre
sented the ASSU Senate last night
with the names of the five stu
dents he intends to nominate to
the Constitutional Council.
Next quarter, Shen will nomi
nate junior Ben Decker, sopho
more Robert Windom, electrical
engineering doctoral student
Nawwar Kasrawi, senior Eugene
Park and sophomore Katherine
Wray to the council that has the
power to invalidate acts of the sen
ate and the president. Committee
members must be approved by
two-thirds of the senate and will
serve until they resign or gradu
ate.
"These people are prepared for
a thorough review by the senate,"
Shen said. "They look forward to

the process and are anxious to
serve."
The nominees may face an up
hill battle to confirmation. Some
senators say they oppose the ex
tensive power of the council and
have promised to scrutinize ap
pointments.
Shen, however, said he stands
by his nominees.
"I think these individuals have
a tremendous knowledge of our
constitution and the will of its au
thors," he said.
Shen received eight applica
tions for the council.
ASSU Senate Chair Don Aing
worth said the senate's Appropri
ations and Rules Committee will
examine and interview the nomi
nees and present a recommenda
tion to the senate.
Issues surrounding the Com
mittee of 15 recommendations
also received consideration at last
night's meeting.
"According to the [ASSU] Con
stitution, any changes in the judi
cial charter must be approved by
two-thirds of the student body,"
ASSU Senator Howard Loo said.
Shen said a special election
would probably be called for that
purpose next quarter.
In other business, the senate
rejected a bill authored by engi
neering-economic systems gradu
ate student Wynship Hillier, the
student representative to the

University committee overseeing
graduate computer services.
Hillier asked the senate to sup
port his proposal to allow on-cam
pus residences access to the Uni
versity modem pool. Currently,
on-campus residences with ether
net capability are not permitted to
dial in to the pool. The senate con
curred with the University, rea
soning that on-campus residents
had sufficient resources at their
disposal and did not require access
to the already-taxed modem sys
tem.
The senate voted to release
$2,289.56 in Program Board re
serve funds to purchase tables,
chairs, banner-making supplies
and a sound system. Through an
agreement between Shen and
Dean of Students Marc Wais, the

equipment will be available to stu
dent groups for check out from the
Office of Student Activities in
Tresidder Union.
Senators also approved the
Stanford Jazz Orchestra's request
for access to its reserve fund of
$1,743.89.
The senate also appointed first
year medical student Sunil Gand
hi as a senate associate.
During last week's meeting,
the senate expelled two graduate
senators, Josh Becker and Sabri
na Tardy, because they had yet
to attend a meeting this fall.
Graduate Senator Michael Pe
terson resigned to avoid expul
sion on the same grounds. The
senate is considering the feasi
bility of calling a special election
to fill the seats.
