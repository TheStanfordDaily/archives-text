ASSU President Bill Shen pre
sented the ASSU Senate last night
with the names of the five stu
dents he intends to nominate to
the Constitutional Council.
Next quarter, Shen will nomi
nate junior Ben Decker, sopho
more Robert Windom, electrical
engineering doctoral student
Nawwar Kasrawi, senior Eugene
Park and sophomore Katherine
Wray to the council that has the
power to invalidate acts of the sen
ate and the president. Committee
members must be approved by
two-thirds of the senate and will
serve until they resign or gradu
ate.
"These people are prepared for
a thorough review by the senate,"
Shen said. "They look forward to

the process and are anxious to
serve."
The nominees may face an up
hill battle to confirmation. Some
senators say they oppose the ex
tensive power of the council and
have promised to scrutinize ap
pointments.
Shen, however, said he stands
by his nominees.
"I think these individuals have
a tremendous knowledge of our
constitution and the will of its au
thors," he said.
Shen received eight applica
tions for the council.
ASSU Senate Chair Don Aing
worth said the senate's Appropri
ations and Rules Committee will
examine and interview the nomi
nees and present a recommenda
tion to the senate.
