# NOTES
## 
### 
Three of Stanford's four grad
uating seniors are pursuing
careers in professional basket
ball. Darren All away, who filled
in superbly at center last season
following the back injury to
sophomore Tim Young, is playing
professionally in Spain; Andy
Poppink, who ended his career as
Stanford's No. 8 all-time leading
rebounder, is playing in Turkey;
and Dion Cross, the Cardinal's
No. 3 all-time leading scorer, is
playing in the Continental Bas
ketball Association. David Har
bour, meanwhile, is a financial
analyst for Robertson, Stephens
& Company in San Francisco.
The 1996-97 Stanford roster
includes two walk-ons. They are
freshmen Mike Mathiesen, a 6-
foot-7, 225-pound forward from
Cupertino High School, and
Johannes Burge, a 6-3, 190-
pound guard from Pacific Pal
isades High School in Los Ange
les.
Brevin Knight needs seven
assists to move into ninth place
all-time in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence record book. He is currently
10th with 546. Knight also ranks
fifth all-time in the Pac-10 in
steals with 215. The Seattle
Supersonics' Gary Payton (Ore
gon State '90) is the all-time lead
er in both categories.
Stanford shot 55 percent from
the floor in its 88-50 win over the
German Under-22 Team and 60
percent in a 103-60 victory over
China August One. Young led the
offensive charge, hitting a com
bined 14 of 20 shots, good for 70
percent, while tallying 36 points
and 19 rebounds in the two exhi
bition wins.
Eighteen of Stanford's games,
and possibly two more, will be
televised. Eight games will be
seen on Sports Channel (STV
Channel 49), five on f/x (STV
Channel 45), three on Fox Sports
Net, one on ABC and one on
CBS.
All 27 regular-season games
will be broadcast live on KDIA
(1310 AM) this season in addi
tion to KZSU's coverage.
