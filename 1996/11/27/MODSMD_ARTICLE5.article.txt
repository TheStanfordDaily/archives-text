Joseph Keller, professor emeri
tus of math and mechanical engi
neering, has been awarded the
1997 Wolf Foundation Prize for
mathematics, the foundation an
nounced Monday.
Keller, 73, will share the
$100,000 prize with Yakov Sinai, a
senior researcher with the Landau
Institute of Theoretical Physics in
Moscow and a math professor at
Princeton University. They will re
ceive their awards from Israeli
President Ezer Weizman at a cere
mony at the Knesset in Jerusalem
on April 6.
"I'm very pleased and honored
to receive this prize because since it
was first awarded, it has been given
to many highly regarded mathe
maticians," Keller said. "So I'm
pleased to be in their company."
He added that he was happy to
share the prize this year with
Sinai, whom he said he regards
highly.
Keller, who has taught and done
research at Stanford since 1979,
works in the field of applied mathe

matics in three different areas at
Stanford â€” the Math Department,
the Mechanical Engineering De
partment and the Scientific Com
puting and Computational Mathe
matics Program.
"It confirms what all of us in the
department already know, which is
that [Keller] is one of the best
mathematicians around," said
Math Prof. Gunnar Carlsson, chair
of the department. "We're all very
proud to be in the same depart
ment with him."
Keller said he became interested
in applied mathematics through
his work at the Courant Institute
of Mathematical Sciences at New
York University, where he taught
for 30 years before coming to Stan
ford and where he also studied as
an undergraduate. During World
War 11, he worked at the War Re
search Division at Columbia Uni
versity. Keller has also taught at
various other universities across
the country.
"I would hope that this kind of
prize will encourage more people to
work in the field of applied mathe
matics," Keller said.
Keller developed the geometri
cal theory of diffraction to solve
problems of wave propagation.
The theory became an important
tool for engineers and scientists
working on radar, antenna design
and high-frequency systems in
complex environments.
Keller has conducted extensive
research on national security is
sues involving sonar, underwater
explosions and hydrogen and
atomic bomb explosions.
Keller has been awarded nu
merous prizes, including the Na
tional Medal of Science from Pres
ident Reagan in 1988 and the
Lester R. Ford Award for exposi
tory writing from the Mathemati

cal Association of America. He has
written more than 400 scientific
papers.
In addition to applying mathe
matics to scientific and technical
problems, Keller said he also ap
plies it to "fun problems, like ana
lyzing sports and gambling and
other sorts of things."
The Wolf Foundation was
founded in the 1970s by Ricardo
Wolf, a German-born diplomat
who served as Cuban ambassador
to Israel, to support contributions
to the sciences and the arts.
Keller is the sixth Stanford fac
ulty member to receive the Wolf
Prize, which is given annually for
outstanding achievements in
chemistry, medicine, agriculture,
mathematics and the arts. Past
winners include Physics Nobel
Laureate Martin Perl and Chem
istry Prof. Carl Djerassi, inventor
of the birth control pill.
