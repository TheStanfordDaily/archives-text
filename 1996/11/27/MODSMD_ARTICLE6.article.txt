# 'Linear city' provides rich opportunity
## Senior researches work of Spanish Utopian urbanist 
### Emily Richmond Contributing writer 
For Marcos Diaz Gonzalez, the shortest
distance between Stanford and Spain was a
linear city.
Gonzalez, a senior in Spanish and urban
studies, applied for a major grant from Un
dergraduate Research Opportunities to chart
the work of Utopian urbanist Arturo Soria Y
Mata, who created a prototype Utopian com
munity outside Madrid in 1894.
Soria envisioned a tramway that would
lead away from Madrid, with privately
owned homes on either side of the tram's
tracks. The homes would vary based on eco
nomic status, but even the least expensive
homes would have gardens, an orchard and
privacy.
"The 40-meter-wide main street would be
the spinal cord of the city." said Gonzalez.
"With families owning their own homes and
centralized public activities, it was a classic
model of a Utopian city."
Running between the homes would be
pneumatic tubes for package and letter deliv
ery, which are popular today at drive-through
banking windows.
Although the plan ultimately failed due to
escalating land costs and social and economic
changes in Spain, the Linear City became
more of a resort community and was eventu
ally swallowed up by the expansion of Madrid,
said Gonzalez.

and Joseph Moore of San Francis
co, Gonzalez traveled to Spain pre
pared to spend his five weeks in
the libraries that housed the rare
texts of Soria's work.
"I had to copy things like
crazy," explained Gonzalez.
"Everything is under protective
glass, and you can't touch the
books. And after half an hour, you
have to give the book back to the li
brarian so she can check it for
damage, and then you sign it out
again."
This exhaustive process would
have been the only means for him
to see his subject's actual writings
if it weren't for the generosity of
Soria's surviving relatives, said
Gonzalez.
"I contacted his relatives in
Madrid. Julia Soria is the grand
daughter of the engineer, and I also
met the great-grandson," said Gon
zalez. While he was "too polite to
ask her age," Gonzalez estimated
that Julia Soria was in her early
90s.
After meeting Gonzalez at
Julia Soria's home, the great
grandson invited him "next door"

to his own home, where he showed
Gonzalez a collection of his great
grandfather's books and papers.
Among the correspondence was a
letter from the king of Spain to
Soria and copies of texts that Gon
zalez had only seen in the special
collections of the Madrid library.
"I spent two days there, going
through the papers," said Gonza
lez. "I created a bibliography of 20
different books and manuscripts.
The great-grandson was very
pleased because they didn't even
know exactly what was in the col
lection."
Gonzalez was amazed when the
family offered him copies of each
Soria text for which they had a du
plicate — an indefinite loan that
allowed Gonzalez to bring several
of the rare materials back to Stan
ford.
One pamphlet, titled "The Lin
ear City," is thin and worn, but the
tissue-paper quality color illustra
tions are pristine.
The book outlines a communi
ty where children and women
can live in healthier environ
ments than the then-overcrowd
ed and unsanitary Madrid, often
called the "City of Death." In
cluded as evidence were draw
ings of a healthy chicken in the
Linear City and its scrawny,

city-bound cousin.
The only evidence of previous
readers in one volume are the pen
cil marks of a famous scholar, said
Gonzalez, who added that the dis
tinctive pencil marks were as iden
tifiable as a signature.
Other scholars of Soria's work
had transposed elements of his
writings, but an unadulterated
translation of the entire text of
"The Linear City" had not been
undertaken, said Gonzalez. That
meant that Gonzalez would be the
first to translate several of the
texts he uncovered into English.
Urban Studies Lecturer Fred
eric Stout co-sponsored Gonza
lez's project with Art Prof. Paul
Turner.
"Although Soria's work is well
known, it has not been as well
known or as influential as other
Utopian urbanists because it has
not been available in English," said
Stout. "Once these texts are avail
able in English, we expect to see an
increased interest in Soria's work."
Gonzalez's translation will also
be published, said Stout, who is co
editing a nine-volume series on
the history of urban planning for a
the British publishing house
Routledge.
"We will include one of Marcos'
translations in that series," said

Stout. "And it will find its way into
libraries worldwide." The transla
tion also may be published on the
World Wide Web site for the Pro
gram in Urban Studies.
The scope of Gonzalez's re
search is unusual for an under
graduate, said Stout. "It's the sort
of thing usually done by a gradu
ate student. ... I might also say
that it is the sort of thing done by
regular full-time faculty mem
bers. What Marcos is doing, in
short, is real scholarship."
Gonzalez, a native of the Ca
nary Islands whose family lives in
Spain, transferred to Stanford
from Foothill College. He had
been an exchange student at Los
Altos High School, and after two
years of studying telecommunica
tion engineering in Spain, Gonza
lez knew he wanted to return to
Northern California and "try
again."
Although his father is an archi
tect, Gonzalez said, "He never
pushed, never encouraged it" as a
career for his son.
Gonzalez added that he plans to
continue his studies with gradu
ate work and a professional archi
tecture degree. He would like to
stay at Stanford, but the closest
architecture program is at UC-
Berkeley.
