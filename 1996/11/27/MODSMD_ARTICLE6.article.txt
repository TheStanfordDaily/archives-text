# 'Linear city' provides rich opportunity
## Senior researches work of Spanish Utopian urbanist 
### Emily Richmond Contributing writer 
For Marcos Diaz Gonzalez, the shortest
distance between Stanford and Spain was a
linear city.
Gonzalez, a senior in Spanish and urban
studies, applied for a major grant from Un
dergraduate Research Opportunities to chart
the work of Utopian urbanist Arturo Soria Y
Mata, who created a prototype Utopian com
munity outside Madrid in 1894.
Soria envisioned a tramway that would
lead away from Madrid, with privately
owned homes on either side of the tram's
tracks. The homes would vary based on eco
nomic status, but even the least expensive
homes would have gardens, an orchard and
privacy.
"The 40-meter-wide main street would be
the spinal cord of the city." said Gonzalez.
"With families owning their own homes and
centralized public activities, it was a classic
model of a Utopian city."
Running between the homes would be
pneumatic tubes for package and letter deliv
ery, which are popular today at drive-through
banking windows.
Although the plan ultimately failed due to
escalating land costs and social and economic
changes in Spain, the Linear City became
more of a resort community and was eventu
ally swallowed up by the expansion of Madrid,
said Gonzalez.
