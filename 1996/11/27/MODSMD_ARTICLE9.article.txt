# Search on for Afro-American Studies director
## 
### Joyce Koo Contributing writer 
A group of nine faculty members and students
is conducting a nationwide search to find a new
director for the African and Afro-American Stud
ies Program.
The group is looking to fill the vacancy left by
English Prof. Horace Porter at the end of the
1995-96 school year. Currently, Morris Graves,
director of the Black Community Services Cen
ter, is the interim director.
Officially, the director's term lasts for five
years, but Porter agreed to stay on for six when
there was no one to replace him. Porter resumed
his full teaching duties in the English Depart
ment at the beginning of this school year.
The search committee, which met for the first
time on Oct. 30, is composed of seven faculty
members and two students. Headed by former
Political Science Department Chair Lucius Bark-

er, the committee includes Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy, History Prof. Albert Camaril
lo, Assoc. Drama Prof. Harry Elam, Asst. Eng
lish Prof. Sharon Holland, Psychology Prof.
Claude Steele, Physics Prof. Arthur Walker, ju
nior Lamar Baker and psychology master's stu
dent Angela Cole.
So far, the committee has placed advertise
ments announcing the position's opening in
about a dozen national higher education maga
zines and professional journals, such as The
Chronicle of Higher Education, the American
Sociology Association journal, the American
Studies Association Newsletter, the American
Political Science Association journal and the
Journal for Blacks in Higher Education.
After all the responses are received by the Jan.
2 deadline, the committee will review and narrow
down the prospective candidates to 10. Further
research will be conducted on the remaining can
didates, including visits to the candidates' re-

spective universities in order to interview their
students and colleagues.
According to Graves, the goal is to install a
new director the fall 1998. The reason the selec
tion process is so detailed and drawn out is be
cause the position requires such a high "caliber"
person, he said.
The director of the African and Afro-Ameri
can Studies Program works in many areas to
"maintain the credibility" of the program. Ac
cording to Graves, the director's job entails
working with English, history and political sci
ence faculty to cross list courses and strength
en the curriculum, bringing in scholars for lec
ture series, working with the community at
large and taking care of budgetary responsibil
ities.
The African and Afro-American Studies Pro
gram, established in 1969, is the oldest ethnic
studies program at Stanford. Eleven students
are currently majoring in the program.
