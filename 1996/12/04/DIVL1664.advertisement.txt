In most team sports, teammates
practice together to become familiar with
each other's style of play. In Amanda
Hoche's sport of choice, competitors are con
fronted with a new "teammate" at each competition.
Hoche, a member of Stanford's Equestrian Team,
has been riding horses since she was six years old. At
competitions, riders draw their horses out of a hat:
this practice is called "catch-riding." and is intended to showcase the rider's skill.
Amanda is known for being able to take charge of any horse she receives
in her competitions, and has trained herself to read a horse's mood and
determine its riding style. The junior industrial engineering major says the
key to her sport is being able to quickl) get back on a horse after a fall and
continue to ride.
Amanda competes with the Stanford Equestrian Team in Intercollegiate
Horse Show Association (lUSA) competitions. To prepare for these compe
titions. Amanda practices at least three times a week. She also is the
team's president and principal fundraiser, and tends the horses in
Stanford's own stable.

liking, you are not alone —at

join me for a group run.
We're talking a decent
jog here. No marathons. No sprinting to the fin
ish. Just some healthy exercise—and good com
