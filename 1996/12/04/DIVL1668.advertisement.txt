Diversions: First of all, congratula
tions on your recent marriage.
Jackson: Thank you.
Diversions: And if you don't mind
me asking. . . . What prompted your
decision to go through with the
nuptials?
Jackson: The doggies.
Diversions: The doggies?
Jackson: Yes. The doggies want
more popcorn. So I'm getting
married.
Diversions: I see. Well, terrific.
And you'll be a father soon. You
must be very excited.
Jackson: No. I don't like 'em
(babies). But, Reg says they're
good.
Diversions: Right. Well, what new
music do you have in the works?
Jackson: I don't like the way they
smell.
Diversions: A new LP?
Jackson: No, the babies. They
smell bad . . . they stink.
Diversions: But, (grinning) soon
you'll be a father.
Jackson: Just about. Four
stunt doubles will help out around
the house. You know, changin'
(diapers), tossin' (baseballs) . . .
that sort of thing. Feces contami
nate my oxygen supply. But the Tin
Foil baby buggy bubble should
help.
Diversions: You should be pretty
safe from toddler toxins.
Jackson: Very.
Diversions: Back to the music.
Anything in the works?
Jackson: Yes. For the past six
months I've been working on some
thing very special Very unique. It's
called "Pet Sounds."
Jackson: Oh, yes. But this one has
synthesizers.
Diversions: Tell me about it
Jackson: I sing along with
recordings of giraffe, bobcat and
jelly fish distress calls. It was a bit
scary initially, so Dookie Bad Bad
(producer) added some samples of
river flow and kitchen ambience to
balance it out.
Diversions: Kitchen ambience?
Jackson: Yeah . . . butter applied
to toast, microwave timer ends,
fridge opens then closes. That sort
of thing.
Diversions: Sounds interesting.
And I see that you brought some
lyric sheets with you.
Jackson: Yes, here's one I'm very
proud of
Chipmunk Love
Ooooh Hoooo. Chipmunk. Chip
munk. Ohhhohhhh Chipmunk Love.
You are so small.
You chew your seeds.
You love to dance — so dance with
me!
Ooooh Hoooo. Chipmunk Chip
munk Ohhhohhhh Chipmunk Love.
Diversions: I seem to recall a
Beach Boys LP by that name.
Don't be afraid.
These velcro pants were not meant
to — lead you astray.
Ooooh Hoooo. Yeah. Yeah. Hoooo.
Ohhhohhhh Hoooo.
My sugar cane
Will make you whole.
C'mon let the magic candy
Take its toll.
Yeaaah. Yeaaah. Chipmunk.
Ohhhohhhh Chipmunk.
Yeaaah. Yeaaah. Sweet Chipmunk.
Chipmunk!
Diversions: Wow, that's amazing.
Jackson: Yes, I haven't felt this
good about a song since "Mama
Srell."
Diversions: What musical artists
would you say have influenced your
work?
Jackson: Abba, Duran Duran, The
Cramps, Cowboy Junkies.
Diversions: No R & B?
Jackson: No, I hate the stuff. It's
just" 'cooh coohin.'" I don't have
time for it. Did you know your stom
ach has to produce a new layer of
mucus every two weeks
to keep from digesting itself?
Diversions: No I didn't. Well, thank
you for your time And good luck
with "Pet Sounds."
