Four years prior to the opening of Stanford University, long before the catch-phrase
"PACIFIC RIM" was ever heard, a special dream was born in Japan. At the time, the
connection of one of the world's greatest, most presitgious universities and this new
company, both dedicated from the beginning to providing the best product,
service and education available, was not even imagined.
It was in 1887 that what has become the
world's largest manufacturer of musical
instruments was born. The first product to
be developed was a reed organ.
Building upon the immediate success,
the company which is located in
Hamamatsu, Japan, designed and built
its first grand piano. From that point, the
dream to create the world's finest piano
became an obsession. Today, the
dream is now a reality.
YAMAHA PIANOS play an integral part in
the growth and development
of emerging artists. Valued
not only for their
tone and touch,
but for their
consistency and
durability, they are
to be found wherever
musicians are making
their mark. Long the
leading choice of the
finest schools and conservatories,
they are equally prominent on stage at
major piano competitions such as the
Tchaikovsky Competition (Moscow), the
Concours d'Execution Musicale (Geneva).
the International Fryderyk Chopin Piano
Competition (Warsaw), and the esteemed
William Kapell Competition (Washington d c.)
You are invited to attend this special event and help support the Music Department of
Stanford University. The site is Braun Music Center and Dinklespiel Auditorium on the
campus of Stanford University on Dec. 13th, 14th,& 15th. For more information or to

Prestigious Universities, including Stanford
University, Princeton and M.1.T., among
others, and conservatories such as the
Conservatoire de Musique (Geneva) the
Royal College of Music (London) the
Norwegian State Academy of Music (Oslo),
and the Conservatoire National
Superieur de Musique de Paris have
selected YAMAHA as their choice. To
earn the acceptance by the world's
leading professionals, a piano must be
far more than adequate. This is true of
universities selected to participate in the
YAMAHA UNIVERSITY PIANO PROGRAM
as well.
The Stanford University School of Music
has now completed its first year in this
program which provides new pianos
each year in a unique rotation program.
At the end of each year, the pianos
used by the music department are
made available to the public at much
lower than normal market prices. The
pianos are professionally maintained in
order to insure the highest quality. All
instruments in this program are sold
including the famous 10 YEAR YAMAHA
WARRANTY and Service Bond Assurance
Plan. Only a handful of schools may
participate. The music department at
Stanford is one of those very few.
