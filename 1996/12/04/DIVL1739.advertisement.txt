ANNOUNCING THE FIRST ANNUAL
INTERMISSION FICTION CONTEST
Calling all future William Shakespeares, Edith Whartons, E.M.
Forsters, Virginia Woolfs, Willa Cathers,
Toni Morrisons, Lorrie Moores and Ethan Canins.
(Not calling any future Judith Krantzes or Tom Clancys.)
First Prize: $75, publication of your story in Intermission and dinner with the editors
of The Daily
Second Prize: $25, possible publication of your story in Intermission and dinner with
the editors of The Daily
Third Prize: dinner with the editors of The Daily
(And we might even hug you if you promise not to sue us.)
Guidelines: The contest is open to Stanford students (both undergraduates and gradu
ate students), faculty and staff. Your story must
never have been published before and must not
exceed 42,000 characters (that's not as many
as it sounds like). Writers for The Daily may
submit entries, but editors or prior editors may
not. Submissions, which will all be anonymous, will
be judged by a panel of distinguished Daily editors,
including some particularly pretentious English majors.
How to Enter: Print your story on typed, double-spaced, num
bered pages. The first page should have your ID number in the upper right hand corner,
but your name should not appear anywhere. Print another page with both your ID number
and your name. In The Daily office (Storke Publications Building, across from Terman),
there will be separate places at the front desk to leave your ID page and your manuscript.
Drop off your submission by TONIGHT (Wed., Dec. 4).
Questions? Complaints? Just want to chat about trivial things? Call 725-2100 (ext.
503) and ask for Curtis.
