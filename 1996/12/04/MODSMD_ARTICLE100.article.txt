college students
eagerly wait tor
winter break to bring joy
to their worlds. But for
some, after living in a par
entless, curfewless and
ruleless environment for
several months, returning
home for the holidays can
induce a different kind of
trauma — and an insa
tiable appetite for Grand
pa's potent eggnog.
"As much as I love going home and
spending time with my family, I think
they sometimes forget that I'm used to
doing what I want, when i want,"
Brandeis U. junior Aura Twersky says.
Twersky, who's been through
the transition from college to home
front several times, complains that
whenever she returns, the same
argument ensues.
"When I drive somewhere alone
at night, my parents give me a cur
few of 1 1:30 or 12," she says."I
know they're just worried about my
safety, but at school that's what time
we leave to go out. At school, I

don't have a mommy anil daddy to
be overprotective of me."
Students may also be ill .it case
about going home if they face prob
lems there. Robert Berlin, director
of the Brandeis Psychological ( outi
seling Center, says families have to
figure out the best method of deal
ing with each situation.
"Apprehensions can come from
real issues," Berlin says. "Students need
to know the limits of what they can
tolerate and lay those limits down."
Berlin suggests that students be
clear with their parents and that
parents in turn "show some
restraint" when interacting with
their returning tenants. "They need
to respect the boundaries of separa
tion and privacy," he savs.
Returning home makes some stu
dents spirits bright — those whose
parents have adjusted to the change
in lifestyle and whose watchful eye
has grown la/.y.
"I love break, says U. of Michi
gan junior Jon Von Samek. "1 can
do whatever I want to at home. And
there's more time to have fun, see
my friends and party."
That is, after he unloads the
dishwasher, visits Grandma, cleans
out his closet, helps his dad get the
decorations from the attic, rides
bikes with his baby sister, sets the
table for dinner, makes his bed
and... oh yeah... decks the halls.
