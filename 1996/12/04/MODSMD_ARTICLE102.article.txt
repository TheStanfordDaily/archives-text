HOW MUCH ARE
you willing to
The question doesn't make
much sense, nor do the five scholar
ship organizations the Federal
Trade Commission is currently
prosecuting.
Companies such as Career
Assistance Planning, Inc., Christo
pher Kbere Nwaigwe, Student
Assistance Services, Inc., College
Assistance Services, Inc. and Stu
dent Aid, Inc. have gained much
notoriety in the past few months
by playing on students' financial
strains with flyers and ads guaran
teeing thousands of dollars in
scholarships in exchange for "small
processing fees."
"Generally, this area of scams
has been growing. We know that
Irom consumer complaints that
have been logged with the Fraud
Information ("enter and with

scholarship-related Web
sites," says Heather Hippsley,
Project Coordinator of the
FTC's Projcct Scholarship

$cam â€” a program designed
both to stop current hoaxes and

to educate potential victims
Sassan Masse rat, a senior
at California State U.,
Northridge, called i

the FTC after
a group
named Aca
dem i c
Investment
Money took
funds direct
ly out of his

bank account
without his per
mission and
subsequent- (

ly lied about
giving him a
refund.

"I feci abused. I'm furiou:
But I am happy that the gover
nment got involved. At least
now we have some kind of

back-up," says Masser
at, who has tried
everything from a
barrage of certified
letters to filing a small

claims suit to get his money back.
Lynn Beller, a senior at U.
South Florida, Tampa, sent $10 to
the Higher Education Scholarship
Program and never received a
response. Her father, Jeffrey Beller,
fought back by sending a letter to
his local postal inspector. The mat
ter was eventually brought to the
FTC's attention.
"For $10, it was a gamble and I
lost. I hope its the worst thing in
my life that I should lose. But 1 am
satisfied that somebody out there is
listening," Lynn Beller says.
Although the assets of the
companies are now frozen while
the trials proceed, it's not clear
how much money the victims of
scholarship scams will receive in
restitution.
"Fraud artists usually spend the
money as fast as they can," Hippsley
says."The victims will just have to
wait it out."
