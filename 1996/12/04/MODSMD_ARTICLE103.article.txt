Because college crime rates have
been rising in the past five years,
schools have started bettinc on inven

tive crime-prevention programs.
" There are always traditional
methods like arrest, but we are try
ing to stay steps above by being cre
ative," says Vanderbilt U., lenn.,
crime prevention officer Marlene
Hall. "I see this trend across the
country. This is a tough, lengthy
and expensive solution, but it gives
the community a lot of benefits."
The A&M garages are equipped
with emergency stations connected
to 24-hour monitored booths.
When a student hits an alarm, cam
eras roll, additional lights turn on
and two-way communication with
police begins.
"Being proactive with preven
tion has stalled criminal activity,"
says A&M I t Bert Kretzschmar.
"The amount of incidents has
dropped dramatically.
Oakland I'., Mich., and Van-

dcrbilt also had bright
prevention ideas. Oak
land installed the
"brightway' paths lit
up like night football
games. Vanderbilt color
coded walkways based
on degrees of safety.
Vanderbilt is also
developing personal alarm
technology to connect
students with campus
cops via a key-chain trans
mitter. Victims will be
able to push a button to
alert police of the crime
and send vital informa
tion, like name and a
photograph, as well a.s the
location of activation.
A U. of Tennessee
fraternity helped stu
dents reach out and
touch someone with dis
counted cellular phones.
I he phones could be
used to contact police,
and part of the proceeds
from their sales went
toward the Rape Aggres
sion Defense program.
Other campuses are
trying to increase aware
ness about individual risk.
• San Francisco State
U., Calif., places posters
across campus after an
incident, outlining facts
about the crime and ask
ing for tips.
• I he U. of Minnesota
uses a fax network to alert
campus offices, businesses
and police departments
statewide the minute a
crime is reported.
• Marshall U., W.
Va., sells bar codes to
attach to property that
might be stolen so the

owner can be identified.
• U. of Oklahoma has a pilot
program to "brand" automobile
parts with identification numbers.
" I he [branding] program has a
western flavor, because in the Old
West people branded horses and
cattle," says Oklahoma public safety
director Joe Lester. "Now we are
branding cars."
Although testing new programs
usually carries a high price tag, many
campuses suv the lower crime rate is
worth it. It's certainlv worth it tor
