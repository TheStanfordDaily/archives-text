tion or even a four-day road trip might seem
1 about as likely as being offered a six-figure salary
the day after graduation. >• But the strapped-
JL for-cash need not be doomed to National
Geographic specials, savvy travelers say. If you know
where to find bargains, you can flex your Greek history
minor at the Parthenon, revel in Indian art or sip frothy
margaritas on the Gull Coast — all on money made
from hustling tables at Denny's.

Catchin' air
One of the biggest travel expenses is getting to
your destination — a cost that can be slashed by
70 percent or more if you fly as an air courier,
says Steve Lantos, editor of Travel Unlimited.
Air couriers escort packages on commercial air
lines for shipping companies like Federal Express
and DHL when their fleets are unavailable to fly
the goods. The companies will get you a seat for
cheap in exchange for your baggage space. Most
companies require travelers to buy a round-trip
ticket and stay a specific number of days. And
packing light for courier flights is a must — you're
only allowed to take luggage that fits under your
seat or in the overhead compartments.
Elisa Busto, a freshman at Palm Beach Com
munity College, Fla., has flown as a courier seven
times and saved thousands of dollars on air fare.
Her round-trip flights to Singapore, London,
Spain, Mexico and Peru ranged from $50 to $150.
"I look into being a courier every time I fly," she
says. "It's not just that it's cheaper. Sometimes, if the
airlines knows you're a courier, they treat you nicer."
One catch to courier traveling is that compan
ions can't travel together, as shipping companies

usually reserve only one seat per trip. With plan
ning, however, your companion can be a courier
for another company shipping rhe same day, or
reserve a ttight for the next day.
Flying as a courier may sound like spy novel
material, but Jennifer Basey, author of The Air
Courier 's Handbook: Travel the World On a Shoe
string, says the business is legit.
"Everyone always jokes [that] it's drugs

[you're carrying)," Basey says. "Anybody interest
ed in taking a courier has to be prepared to take
that joke, but it is simply not true."
The goods are mostly boring stuff — like doc
uments — and you aren t held responsible for
delivering them or ensuring their safety. Your only
obligation is to meet a company representative at
the airport before the trip to pick up your ticket.
"The only time I was netvous was when I went

to Singapore and they
announced that bringing
drugs into the country
is punishable by
death," Busto says.
"But that's why it's good
that you never come in
contact with the package."
Globetrotting
If you're a true globe
trotter seeking adventure
on a teeny fortune, you
can visit Big Ben, the
Sphinx and the Great
Wall of China all for one
airfare on an around-the
world ticket.
Much like a cruise
trip, you specify a final
destination and the num
ber of stops you would
like to make along the
way. There's just one
catch: You can only Hy in
one direction.
"I can go around the
world from l.os Angeles
to Bangkok to New
Delhi to Milan to Lon
don," Lantos says. "I've
continued in the same
westward direction. The
fare costs about $ 1,100."
For those who find
planning the details of a
trip about as thrilling as
yard work, Airhitch with
Whole Earth Travel is
the way to go.


Hitch in' for a place to go.
