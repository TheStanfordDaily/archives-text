Whole Earth buys unused seats to and from
Europe on commercial airlines and sells them at the
last minute. Travelers register a list of desired destina
tions and dates to travel, and the company locates the
seat. The company only sells seats on a one-way basis, so
you have to make return flight arrangements while
you're traveling.
If you leave from an East Coast hub, like New York or
D.C., tickets arc around $169 one-way. Departing from
West coast hubs, like Los Angeles and San Francisco, tick
ets cost around $269.
It's a great deal if you're traveling to and from major
international cities, like New York, Los Angeles, Paris and
L-ondon. It's not such a bargain if you re trying to reach
more obscure destinations. You also have to prepay for the
ticket and be willing to Hy when called.

Cheap tricks
A European vacation
probably sounds like the
hip, backpacker thing to
do right now, but think
again, says Bruce
Northam, author of The
Frugal Globetrotter. Asia,
America and Turkey
are hot spots right now.
"I was in Europe this
summer," Northam says.
"It was jam-packed and
pricey. Save the countries
in Europe for when you're
old and feeble and have
no immunity. You'll want
to knock out India and
China while you're young
and robust."
Paying more than
$20 a night is ridiculous

Luke Metzcer, junior,
U. of Southern
California

on a college budget, he says. Strive to make it on $3 to
$10 instead.
Still don't think you have enough for a quick trip?
Employing creativity can take you far, far away from exams
and dorm food, says Jamie Jensen, author of Road Trip
USA: Cross-country Adventures on America's Two-lane
Highways.
"Look for off-season or shoulder-season rates," Jensen says.
Now 34, Jensen became a road warrior after a six-week
hiatus from the U. of California, Berkeley, metamorphosed
into a two-year-long lifestyle,
Jensen says much of the time he survived by trading
work for lodging. He even rented hammocks for $1 a night.
"The key is to go with the How," Jensen says."I ended
up sailing boats and following harvests."

On the road again
If you have a little more time to explore, hitting the
road or the rails is a cheap but slowww way to go.
Green Tortoise Tours offers an au naturel traveling
experience, and slow is the only way it moves.
The San Francisco-based company does both short and
long jaunts aboard buses that convert into bedrooms on
the move, says Steven Brophy, an employee of Green Tor
toise and frequent Tortoise tourist. Travelers sleep during
the night drives and, during the day, cook, serve KP and
sightsee together.
For a fee of $400, Green Tortoise will take your pio
neering spirit on a nine-day expedition into the Grand
Canyon. One month in Alaska costs $1,500 â€” airfare
included. T here arc also trips to Seattle, Portland and
Yoscmitc and a Northern Migration trip from Mexico to
San Francisco.
For a little more than $100, Luke Metzgcr took the
Tortoise to Seattle and back from Los Angeles. The U. of
Southern California junior says he'd take the weeklong
journey again in a heartbeat.
"Sure, sometimes you'll be sleeping next to someone's
feet, but it's worth it,"he says. "There's just a great vibe on
the bus, and it's filled with young people and international
kids who are traveling around."
Hit the road, Jack
If you re running out of excuses to travel, try the
old standby of job-hunting. Matt Krukin and Kim
Giblin, *96 grads of the State U. of New York,

Oswego, spent
rwo months trav
eling across the
United States
while interview
ing for jobs.
For a mere
$ 1,800, the couple
trekked through
some 10 national
parks, zoomed
down the steepest
roller coasters in the
nation, appeared in
the television audi
ence of the Dating
Game, jogged the
Golden Gate
Bridge and went
wine tasting.
To cut costs
during the trip,
they cooked on a
kerosene stove,
purchased bever
ages in bulk and
took advantage of
national park pass
es that give dis
count rates at
campsites.
"When we
couldn't find a
place to sleep, we
slept in the back of
the truck," Giblin
says. "We did a lot
of roughing it. The
majority of the time

we did a lot of hiking and things that didn 't cost much. "
Lampoon-csque student travels, national or internation
al, are part of the learning experience, says Kevin Potchnr,
founder and manager of Degrees of Freedom Travel.
"The greatest thing is to sec and experience things you
normally don't," he says. "Traveling gives you a unique
and interesting perspective on the world. The whole sense
of adventure is exciting."
And hey, with travel this cheap, you might even be able
to afford a map.
