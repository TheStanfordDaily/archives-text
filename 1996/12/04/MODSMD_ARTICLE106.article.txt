Whether it's by plane, train or amphibian
bus, let's just say you've cashed in enough
cans for transportation funds. You buy the
ticket and hit the road. You're where you
want to be, but now you're broke again.
Not to worry. The friendly folks at the
nearest youth hostel can cut you a deal.
National and international youth hostels
provide separate men's and women's dor
mitory-style accommodations and cost a
few dollars, says Lisa Diehlmann, promo
tions manager for Hostelling International.
Stephannie Tallent, a grad student at

Texas A & M College of Veterinary Medicine,
traveled Europe alone for four weeks and
stayed in hostels the whole time.
"I was always in rooms with other people,
and I was traveling by myself, so I made the
effort to meet people," she says."I visited
Venice with a woman from Australia and
wandered through Florence with a woman
from New Zealand."
Here's the good news about hostels:
Price tags for lodging range from $8 to $22 a
night. Lockers to store belongings are avail
able, as are single and double rooms, for a
few dollars more. If you pack your own din
ner, you can cook in the hostel's kitchen and
keep costs down.
Here's the bad news about hostels:
Depending on the size of the hostel, you could

find yourself bunking with between 15 and
480 other travelers. Some call it charming,
others call it seedy. It all depends on how you
view your traveling experience.
"Some are seedy, some are nice," says
Margarethe Olsson, a senior at Virginia
Tech. "It all depends on the area and the
people running them. But some of the seedi
er hostels are the most fun. The really nice
ones tend to be more restrictive, less friend
ly and less open."
Olsson has toured a handful of hostels
across the United States — from Atlanta and
Savannah, Ga., to San Francisco and New
York. For a few bucks a night you get more
than just a roof over your head, she says.
Many hostels are restored old buildings that
reek of local history.

Like the Miami Beach hostel. It was once
Al Capone's hangout but was later converted
into a hostel. One hostel in New York City pro
vides walking tours of Harlem for travelers
who want the anti-tourist tour of the real city.
And a Seattle hostel was once the checkpoint
for immigrants coming to America.
The bottom line? If you want to be pam
pered, fed, well-rested and clean during your
travels, avoid the hostel experience. It might
be worth it to cough up the extra bucks for a
traditional hotel. But if you're looking for
interesting fodder for your travel diary, and
you don't mind cold showers and funky
smelling clothes, hostels are the way to go.
