YOU LEARNED YOUR
ABCs long ago, but
alas, they're no longer
quite what you
remember (and you
worried about retaining
chem formulas!). Experts
say college coursework that
used to earn a "C" grade
now pulls in grades that
look more like "B"s, leav
ing some schools shaking
in their boots over their
reputations.
Garden of even
Author Louis Goldman's "The
Betrayal of the Gatekeeper: Grade
Inflation," in The Journal of General
Education says the trend of giving
higher grades began in the late '60s
and early 70s. He says professors
gave students higher grades because
they were trying to keep students in
class and out of the draft.
John Gooper, a chemistry pro
fessor at Bucknell U., Pa., disagrees
about grade inflation's origins. He
says grade inflation occurred
because some departments in the
humanities traditionally contain
classes not required to graduate, so
they had to compete for students to
take the classes.
"[The draft excuse] is a cop
out," Gooper says. "If you go back
and actually look at grade distribu
tions across the country in-depth,
the sciences and engineering were
much slower to inflate grades."
If at first you don't
succeed...
Other evidence points to second
chances as the reason for a grade
boom. The student government at
Louisiana State U. has been trying
to pass a Repeat/Delete policy for

five years. The policy would allow
students ro retake a class lor a higher
grade. No marks would be deleted
from students' transcripts; only the
higher grade would he calculated

into the CPA.
Senior Paul
Estes, student gov
ernment president,
says he supports the
policy because of
new demands on
students, like the
higher cost of edu
cation. Since more
students work,
study time is harder
to find.
"It should be no
problem to give stu
dents a second
chance,' Estes says.
But the faculty
senate has decided
not to vote on the
issue again. "The
major reason I
object is the devalu
ation of the degree,"
says John Collier,
president ot the fac
ulty senate.
Several schools
— including the
U. of California,

Berkeley, Tennesee's Vanderbilt
U. and New Jersey's Rutgers U.
— have adopted some form of the
policy. At Rutgers, students can
repeat up to 12 credits of failed
coursework. The policy was
adopted because CjPA require
ments for graduation were raised
from a 1.8 to a 2.0.
"I spend a lot of time speaking
to students encouraging them [to
repeat for an 'A']. I don't encourage
students to get a 'C to raise their
CPA," says Shawn Johnson, assis
tant dean for academic standing and
readmission at Rutgers.
Dropping the bombs
Contrary to popular belief in
academia, says Cliff Adelman, a
senior research analyst with the
Department of Education, grade
inflation doesn't exist. A study he
cited in a New York Times editorial
shows that the percentage of "A"s
fell from 27.3 percent between 1972
and 1982 to 25.2 percent between
1982 and 1992.
Adelman explains CPA
increases by noting the various

/ n
ways students can drop a class
before a poor grade makes it

on a transcript.
Until the 1995-96
school year, students at

"'A'students
today can't
begin to do
what'A'
students
could do 20
or3oyears
ago, but tli e
grades keep
going up."

John Cooper,
CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR,
Bucknell U., Pa.

there was not as flagrant as
at Bucknell.
Many colleges bear
similar stances to LSU on
grade inflation — they see
that it exists and want to
take action.
Phil Ayres, a senior
at Vanderhilt, says that J

two years ago, Van
derbilt's average
grade was a "B-."
Since then he has
noticed that grad
ing has gotten hard
er — and he's
glad. "The aver-

age grade is
now more
like a

Stanford U. could drop a class the
day of the final exam and not be
penalized. Students at Brown U.,
R. 1., can still drop a class until the
last day of class. And at most state

universities, just
weeks before the
end of the semester,
a student can with
draw without
receiving a "W."
Adelman says
the media lead peo
ple to believe grade
inflation exists by
focusing on Ivy
League schools,
which historically
give high grades.
"Stanford, Harvard
and Amherst are
glitz, and that's
what [the media]
report. T hat's not
reality. They're not
the average place
where American
kids are going."
Cooper dis
agrees. I le says that
while on a yearlong
sabbatical at Cor
nell U., he noticed

that the grade
inflation

'C.' It makes sense for those going
on to professional school. It doesn't
look as good doing well at a school
whose average grade is a B- as it
does from one with a 'C.'"
Harry Cleaver, an economics
professor at U. of Texas, Austin,
says that UT used to unofficially
record which professors were "infla
tors" and "deflators" by tracking
average grades in classes. Being an
"inHator" counted against a profes
sor in pursuit of tenure or promo
tion. "Deflators" got raises.
A history of failure
Rather than abolishing failing
grades, as many schools have done
in the past, Stanford is adding them
— or at least one old favorite. Since
Stanford abolished the "P" and the
"F" grades in 1970, the school went
25 years without giving a failing
grade. That ended when officials
brought back the mark of failure to
be noted as "NP," for "not passed,"
last school year.
During the 1968—69 school
year, 35 percent of students at Stan
ford received an "A and 1 percent

received an "F,"
according to a

Jiiii c 1994
article in the
Chicago Tri-

<!S - .
b u ti e .
T Ii c

11 u in -
ber

of "A"s had jumped to 51 percent
by the 1992-93 school year.
As of two years ago, Dartmouth
College, N.H., includes on its tran
scripts — in addition to grades — the
size of the class and the average grade
for the class. This change came after
its overall CiPA jumped from 3.06 in
1976-77 to 3.23 in 1993-94.
So could today's students survive
on grading scales of the past?
"A students today can't begin
to do what A' students could do 20
or 30 years ago," Cooper says. "But
the grades keep going up."
Ayres disagrees. "I'd say now it's
more challenging, and it's better
than ever."
We may never know if grade
inflation is an actual phenomenon.
Maybe the only important question
is: Are you better oft now than you
were four years ago?
