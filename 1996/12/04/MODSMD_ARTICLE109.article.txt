Tibbetts Street
"When we were playing
in a small place, by the end
of the night, people were
on tables — when we'd
play a polka or some
thing," says Ryan McMak
en, guitarist/ vocalist for
Tibbetts Street.
This pack of former high
school buddies attracted an
audience by charging $1
per person at the Taco
Stand in Athens, Ga. But
their eclectic, personality
filled shows lured fans to
bigger shows.
Tibbetts Street's CD one
seventy features complex
ballad grooves — just right
for stretching out on a
velour chaise longue — as
well as beer-chug jams.
Every bit is reminiscent of
'70s rock, complete with
guitar solos, flutes, tingling
triangles, and, of course,
keyboards.
The CD is somewhat
chaotic and similar to typ
ical college-band Grateful
Dead imitations. But Tib
betts Street is getting
more organized. "Things
are becoming less jam
oriented, with more
emphasis on song writ
ing," McMaken says.
"It's friendly music —
not thrash or anger," says
keyboardist/vocalist
Mark Ross.
When band relations do
get strained, Tibbetts Street
have a sure-fire method to
settle disputes. "We wres
tle, and whoever wins is
right," says drummer Char
lie Whitney.
