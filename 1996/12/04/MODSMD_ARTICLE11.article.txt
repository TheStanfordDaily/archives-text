RANGOON, Burma (AP) -
Riot police arrested dozens of
protesters yesterday afler breaking
up a demonstration that the mili
tary regime said was instigated by
"political elements."
Police set up roadblocks on
streets leading to the home of pro
democracy leader Aung San Suu
Kyi — even though there was no
clear link between her movement
and the protest, the largest against
the regime in years.
In a telephone call yesterday to
members of an international
democracy meeting in Cape Town,
South Africa, Suu Kyi urged world
wide support for Burma's democ
racy movement, which she said
faced growing persecution.
"I would like the world to know
that repression in Burma is getting
worse," the Nobel Peace Prize lau

reate told members of the Stock
holm-based International Institute
for Democracy and Electoral Assis
tance.
In addition to erecting barri
cades outside Suu Kyi's home and
restricting her movements,
authorities have evicted party
members from their homes and
fired them from their jobs, the
South African Press Association
quoted Suu Kyi as saying.
The student demonstration
began Monday afternoon when
about 1,000 students from the
Rangoon Institute of Technology
marched to Rangoon University
and staged a sit-in. They marched
around the capital all night, at one
point stopping outside the U.S.
Embassy.
While some stressed calls for
freedom and human rights, the

majority made nonpolitical
demands, such as urging the gov
ernment to grant students more
independence and investigate
police brutality.
The protest was sparked by the
police beating of several students
following a dispute with a food stall
owner in October.
Col. Kyaw Win, deputy director
of the country's powerful military
intelligence apparatus, said two
policemen responsible for the beat
ing had been expelled from the
force and sentenced to two years'
hard labor. An official announce
ment of their fate in the media, as
the students requested, was unnec
essary, he said.
The number of protesters dwin
dled as the night went on. About
150 heavily armed riot police dis
persed the final 300 protesters out

side Rangoon's holiest shrine, the
gilded Shwedagon Pagoda, at dawn
yesterday, and pushed them into
trucks.
They were taken to a former
race track where authorities
apparently checked for any non
student activists. Many students
were freed shortly afler noon, but
an unknown number remained
detained.
The government, which held a
news conference shortly after
breaking up the protest, had no
comment on the detentions.
Kyaw Win said the government
"has so far handled the demonstra
tion leniently and gently."
He blamed "political elements"
opposed to Burma's successful
entry into the Association of South
east Asian Nations for sparking the
protest. He did not elaborate.
