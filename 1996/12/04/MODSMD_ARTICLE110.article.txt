# Blind Melon
## Nico Capital 
### 
SOME FAMILIES HIGH-TAIL IT TO
Olan Mills to capture the early
smiles of their Hrst kid. They order a
million copies of the portrait and send ir
off to their friends. But Shannon Hoon
szot it backward — his bandmates/bud
dies made a portrait of Blind Melon and
dedicated it to his daughter, Nico Blue.

Inside this scrapbook-like album, fans
will find new treasures. There are outtakes
and never-released tracks, including the last
two recordings of Hoon before his death
from a drug overdose. Nico displays the
band's ironic vitality — evidence of what
Blind Melon and its singer/songwriter were
and could have been.
"Letters From a Porcupine" is a message
from Hoon on guitarist Christopher Thorn's
answering machine. Songs like eerie "No
Rain" [ripped-away version] foreshadow
1 loon's fate. Here's proof it's not too late to
get to know the band that connected new- and
old-style rock as effortlessly as it combined
hope and despair.
