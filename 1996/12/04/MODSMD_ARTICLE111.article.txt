Don't call it trip-hop

Tricky hates that expression, and, from the sound of
this record, you don't want to be on his bad side.
It's rapturous to hear Martine I opley-Bird again
on Tricky's latest — in fact, it's hard not to want
more of her shards-of-glass voice. It's her singing
that cuts soul-deep, not Tricky's. But he's the mas
termind of this strolling, dark record.
This stuff is scary — not in the thrashing Mari
lyn Manson or gonna-shoot-you G-rapper sense,
but because it's real and raw. You can feel Tricky's
personal madness like 36-grit sandpaper on your
soul. Chilling, not painful.
When Tricky's lazy, garbled lyrics bubble
above the mesmerizing beats of "Tricky Kid," he
sings, "They used to call me Tricky Kid. I lived the
life they wish they did. That's when you know
he's all truth.
