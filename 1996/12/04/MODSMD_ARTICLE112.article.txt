Ever sit around letting
every irritation and regret

creep up on you until you want to scream?
Okay, it's not the most cheerful way to spend
your time, but listening to singer Tom Barnes do it
is kind of cool. At least that's what he sounds like
he's doing. There's so much energy on this release
that, even on the subtlest tracks, a sense of volun
tary desperation emerges.
Set to post-punk guitar, Barnes' brooding easi
ly translates into robust pop refrains. Eric
Knight's bass guitar playing stands out as it
threads the imaginative tunes together with con
sistent confidence.
Guitar-driven alterna-albums abound these
days, but this record is cleaner than most without
sacrificing aggression. Engine <S8 know that pas
sion doesn't have to mean drawn blood or broken
instruments.
