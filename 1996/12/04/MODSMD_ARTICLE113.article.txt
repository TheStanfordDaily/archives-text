"I've been looking, I've
Deen searching, I've been

walking and talking,' sing Cony Foni l one in
'Thinking of You." But they've really been writing

House of Music marks the trio's return to its own

Cunky "Let's Get Down' is their best compression
of varied bits of sentiment and style. I hey get away

artists. They're about rap, funk and traditional
R&B, too. Che Tonys do it all at once... quite well.
