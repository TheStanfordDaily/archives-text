Christmas
Nick at Nite
Remember
getting to stay

up late in your footie pajamas to watch
the Grinch, Frosty and Rudolph?
Whether you prefer the Muppets or good
ol' Charlie Brown, these timeless car
toon classics are a must-have. If you
don't want this CD, your heart must be
two sizes too small.
John Pizzarelli
Let's Share Christmas
RCA

Dreaming about snuggling under the
comforter with the cooing of a sexy big
band singer? Try warming up with John
Pizzarelli. Each song captures the magic
of Christmas like it was in the good old
days, but there's nothing dusty about
this slick, young Sinatra-ite!
Various Artists
Celtic Heartbeat Christmas
Celtic Heartbeat/Atlantic
Ethereal sounds enchant with this
seasonal collection, which highlights
centuries of beautiful folk music from
around the world. Scottish, German,
Irish and American musicians con
tribute soothing vocal and instrumental
alternatives.
Various Artists
A Country Christmas
Nashville/Arista
Country music stars do favorite

Christmas classics and guitar-by-the
fire originals. Start grinning, cowboy,
because these carols remain recogniz
able, unlike the many Christmas compi
lations that inject overdoses of genre.
You'll smell the chestnuts roasting
before the first track is over.
R2-D2 and C-3PO
Christmas In The Stars
Rhino
For the first time on CD, this long
out-of-print kitsch classic of beeps,
blips and Jedi jigs helps create a holi
day that's out of this world. The best
track is "What Can You Get a Wookiee
For Christmas (When He Already Owns
a Comb)?"
Various Artists
Festival Of Light
Six Degrees/Island
You'll want more than eight days to

enjoy this musical Hanukkah celebra
tion. Vocal and instrumental work and
tradition and modernism mix peacefully.
Oidgeridoo, hymn-like lyrics, tablas,
trip-hop beats and old-fashioned R&B
light up the festivities.
Various Artists
/Vow Wave Christmas
Rhino
Can't get enough of '80s schmaltz?
This compilation should help with
tracks by XTC, Squeeze, the Pre
tenders, David Bowie (with Bing Cros
by), Wall of Voodoo, They Might Be
Giants and friends. Pass the synthesiz
er and the eggnog.

It's time to wade through this sea
son's zillion mistletoe-toting albums!
But really — the U. editors are only
trying to help.
