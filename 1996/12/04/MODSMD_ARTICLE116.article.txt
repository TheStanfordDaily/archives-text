Just Write
Five out of five dentists from Wisconsin prefer
investing in independent films, especially since Just
Write is the dream of a fellow cheese state native. So
when Heath McLaughlin set out to produce a film, he
called his people for financial backing and a root canal.

"It's a leap of faith for everyone involved, but it will work because it's being done
the way filmmaking should be — with integrity," McLaughlin says.
Sound too confident for a first-time producer 11 days into filming? Well, not with
out good reason. Stars like Sherilyn Fenn, Jeremy Piven, Jo Beth Williams and Costas
Mandylor deemed the story worthwhile enough to take parts. Everything is accounted
for in the under-$1 million budget, and the industry is buzzing with early media cover
age. A spring release is planned, although a distributor still needs to be found.
But no one seems to be worried about that on the night of the century's last lunar
eclipse, when a gala party scene is unraveling at a Malibu mansion. The timing couldn't
be better for a romantic comedy about a tour-bus driver (Piven, TV's Elletf) so smitten with
a starlet that he pretends to be a famous screenwriter.
"It's a very Capraesque, big-hearted movie. The main characters are the last of the
innocents," Piven says. "It's rare that movies are about the underdog. This is sort of
like my character's coming-out party."
