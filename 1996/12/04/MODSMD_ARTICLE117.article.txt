Fierce Creatures
Someone once told
John Cleese that the hard
est type of film to market is
an original one. His own
rule of thumb is to never
work with animals, children
or Kevin Kline.
Of course, in the spirit
of Monty Python, he
ignored all mantras and
started writing an "equal"
to the 1988 smash, A Fish
Called Wanda.
Fierce Creatures
reassembles Wanda's cast
— Jamie Lee Curtis, Kline,
Cleese and Michael Palin
— and puts them in an
unrelated setting with new
on-screen egos.
"This is a strong come
dy team, but they aren't
funny enough to distract
the audience's attention
away from me," Cleese
says. "Despite how difficult
they are, I thought it'd be
fun to work with them
again. But I couldn't make
a sequel. They almost
never measure up to the
first one."
This time the fabulous
foursome is at a zoo
acquired in a corporate
takeover. Each has a differ
ent idea of how the zoo
should be run to bring in
more revenue. Cleese —
who loves filming with ani
mals, especially ring-tailed
lemurs — dedicated the
film to a personal zoo
keeper hero.
"Animals are a treat to
work with. You never know
what they're going to do, so
they keep you and your
comedy on your toes."
