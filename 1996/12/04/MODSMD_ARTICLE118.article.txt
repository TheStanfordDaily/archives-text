# BACK TO
## Retro craze proves knowledge is still power 
### CARRIE BELL Assistant Editor Cartoons courtesy of Rhino ABC 
Pick any Saturday
morning in the 70s
or early 80s. The
house is quiet. Beds
are empty and un
made. Cereal is being
smacked. Do you know
where all the children are?
It's a good bet they were in front
of the TV watching one of ABC's
Schoolhouse Rock segments. And
from the looks of the new program
ming and a rash of merchandise, the
kid in them has come out to play
once again.
College students are waxing
nostalgic over the crude anima
tion and jazzy tunes. Humboldt
State U., Calif., senior Morgan
Sayler often comes home to the
familiar sounds.
"You'd think my roommate was
trapped in the fourth grade â€” stuck
at the Conjunction Junction," Sayler
says."He watches his videos so
much, I'm learning the songs again."
The guilty-as-charged Mikel

Edillion, a senior, says watching
Schoolhouse helps him relax. "They
resonate a time when you were less
vulnerable, when you didn't
have to think about

landfills or
nuclear prolif-

eration. You wor

lied about 'My Hero, Zero' instead."
At the heart of the rekindled
interest are new segments airing
Saturdays this fall after a seven-year
hiatus. This set deals with the
financial woes of adulthood. The
songwriters are also working on a
series tackling the gruesome topic
of geography.
"The generation that grew up on
Schoolhouse Rock is taking over posi
tions of power in the industry," says
an ABC spokesperson. "They
remember how fun they were, so
they say, 'Let's bring it back.'"
And back the educational car
toons have come, in several forms
only possible in the decade of
marketing.
Read all about it
I low many Emmys did the series
win? Do you know which song was
written first? Don't worry if your
mind is blank because these ques

tions and more arc answered in
Schoolhouse Koch! The Official (iuide
(1 fyperion, S'J.OS).
The trivia book was written by the
creators of Schoolhouse, McCaffrey &
McCall Advertising's George Newall
and l orn Yohe. As the story goes,

Newall

was frus-

trated because

his son could sing
along witli all the Rolling Stones'
songs but couldn't memorize his mul
tiplication tables. He called in studio
musician Bob Dorough and begged
him to put the tables to music.
Dorough, who was all too
familiar with the monotony of the
rabies, knew he had a challenge
ahead of him.
"I thought I was being called in
for a jingle. Imagine my surprise
when they told me what they had
in mind. They liked it so much,
they decided the songs might bene
fit all children."
And so the educational scries was
born. As AB(" became more inter
ested, the creative team grew, and it
scrambled to think of interesting
stories to teach lessons on math,
grammar, American history, science
and computers.
"People would be surprised how
much research went into the songs
before I even came up with the
music," Dorough says. '"Rufus

Xavier Sarsaparitla' [pronouns] was
the toughest to push into a pleasing
melodic form."
Music to the ears
After all the hard work, ABC
closed the Schoolbouse doors in
1985. (A small revival occurred with
Money Rock in 1992.) The music
tapes were stored in David McCali's

son's barn and long
forgotten until
Lava/Atlantic
Records produced
Schoolbouse Rock'!
Rocks, a tribute
album with re -
vamped versions of
the classics.
Musicians like
Ske e -1 o, Better
Than Ezra and
Moby were given
free reign on which
song they wanted to
perform and how.
But fo r Bli n d
Melon there was
one obvious choice.
"When we first

started, we had videotapes of the
songs our drummer taped off TV.
These pieces made .1 big impression
on me musically. We were covering
'Three Is a Magic Number for
years," says guitarist Rogers Stevens.
"Our style fit that song well."
The cover of "Three" was the
last thing the band recorded before
the drug-related death of vocalist
Shannon Hoon.
"These songs are catchy, clever
pop songs that are actually hard to
play, so we were nervous. We hadn't
played it in vears, but in the studio,
it all just came back, Stevens says.
It wasn't long before AB(' decid
ed to milk the pop-culture l.isli
cow. Representatives approached
Rhino Records and decided to
release the original music. The sub
division, Kid Rhino, jumped at the
chance to put out a four-CD com
prehensive set in a denim covered,
three-ring notebook.
"Kid Rhino's goal is to release
music not just lor kids, but for the
kid in us all," says vice president
Torrie Dorrell.

The show
must go on
For the past three years, '
producer Nina Lynn and direc
tor Scott Ferguson have made the
cartoons come to life for more

than 100,000 fans in Schoolhouse
Rock, live!off-Broadway.
Six Chicago theaters as well as
one in New York have

been converted
into '70s wonder
lands with old TV
themes playing

"These
pieces made
abig
impression
on me
musically."

Mf.i on guitarist

overhead and Pixie Stix and Pop
Rocks filling concession stands.
"We've worked hard to be hon
est to the material. We're not just
cashing in. We just fell in the mid
dle of the retro craze, but we are
looking for a life after it as well,"
Lynn says.
Lynn says they started the show
because the songs work well with

original fans and
new ones.
"They knew
how to write a
good song, how to
take complex ideas
and break them
into jingles. You
don't get bored
no matter how old
you are."
Stay tuned for
possible visits to San
Francisco, Boston
and I .os Angeles.
Melting pot
The buck does
n't stop there,
either. Creative

Wonders, a software company,
designed a math CD-ROM, and
others are in the works. Stores are
also filled with T-shirts, key
chains and plastic figurines
inspired by the show. Knough to
make Interplanct Janet leave her
head in the stars.
"When I was selling T-shirts [in
Berkeley], I couldn't keep anything
related to that show in stock. Kids
my age just eat that stuff up." says
U. of California, Berkeley, grad stu
dent Monica Kirby.
As for those involved in the
many projects, the popularity is
nothing but expected.
"Kids were so saturated by it,
I figured the tunes would last
forever. So many college kids
come up to me after a perfor
mance and say, 'Your voice
sounds so familiar, " savs Dor
ough. "I reply, 'Conjunction
Junction? and they give me a
knowing look and say, 'What s
your function? It's kind of like
beine a rock star."
