### Foiled by the U. S 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - U.S. opposi
tion to Boutros Boutros-Ghali has effectively
scuttled the Egyptian diplomat's candidacy
for a second term as U.N. secretary-general,
Egypt's president said yesterday.
U.N. spokesman Sylvana Eoa said Egyp
tian President Hosni Mubarak assured
Boutros-Ghali that Egypt remained officially
committed to his candidacy.
But Mubarak, speaking in Tunisia, said the
United States had mined the secretary-gener
al's chances.
"It is Boutros-Ghali's right to run a second
time, but we did all we could as Egypt, and I

don't think he will be able to continue in this
process," he said.
Boutros-Ghali, 74, will end his five-year
term Dec. 31.
Yugoslav radio silenced
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) â€” Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic shut down the
main independent radio station and jammed
another yesterday in an attempt to silence his
critics.
But 50,000 demonstrators marched noisily
through Belgrade to protest the annulling of
elections and his autocratic rule.
Radio 892, which has given wide coverage
to 10 straight days of demonstrations, was

ordered closed for operating without a legal
permit. Staff at Radio Index, the only other
independent radio station in the capital, said
their transmissions were being tampered
with.
The range of the two stations, which have
reported live from the marches, is restricted.
State-run TV, which blankets Serbia, has
given no more than a few seconds of daily
coverage to the protests, followed by com
mentaries criticizing opposition leaders as
enemies of the state.
Even though the protests have been large
ly peaceful, state television has accused oppo
sition leaders of leading "rampaging hordes
of demonstrators" and "causing severe mate
rial damage to people's property."
