First you go through the metal detector. Then
you empty your pockets onto the table. Any contra
band (cigarettes, lighters, insulin, etc.) is confiscated
and not returned. Next, an eager guard pats you
down... searching... searching ("hey!") to make sure

you re not holding back.
While he's feeling you up,
you spot the sign: "Moshing,
slam dancing or stage diving
is cause for immediate
EJECTION!"
Wait .1 minute. This ain t Sing-
Sing. This here s the maximum securi
t\ level ot l.ollapaloo/a.
But it wasn't always this way.
Many, many years ago, young
Jeem Moree Son of the primitive
Apollonia trihe accidental!) wandered
on stage during the celebration ot the
spring harvest. Ihe clumsy Son
tripped into the red-hot campHre and
hopped around, yowling and cursing
to the beat ot the tribal drums.
To his surprise, the crowd was
delighted. Later that night, even
though Son possessed 110 land, had no

survival skills and was strikingly unattractive, two village girls happilv followed
him back to his cave.
Son began performing his howling and jumping show every night, and even
traveled to neighboring villages. As his popularity grew, |eem Moree Son fash
ioned tight pants out of cow skin, shortened his name to "Son, and launched
the Son Clod l our. The voung tribesman who formerly couldn t be trusted to
light his own fire — let alone light anyone else s — was given more food,
clothing and women than any man could consume.
Although Son died from overeating mind-altering mushrooms, many
others stepped forth to carry on the tradition. And for thousands of years,
the delighted audience, the idolized performers and the unscrupulous
tribal concert promoters all basked in the harmonious glow of rock and
roll and fire.
Even in recent times, rock concerts were cause for celebration. Watching
the video from the original Woodstock is viewing some serious fun: No time
limits on the sets, free admission, beer flowing like, wine, ugK nekkiu
people running around, huddled figures trying to keep warm indis-

putable proof we hadn t lost that
primitive spirit.
But fast forward to modern rock
tests and you'll see that the only tiling
remotely primitive are the pierced
bodv parts — the one tribal custom
that never should ve become popular
again. The sex tents in primitive times
turned into the LSD recovery tents of
Woodstock, which in turn became the
AT&T "Try a cellular phone for
FREE tents of today. Truly a step
backward in evolutionary priorities.
So I ask you: Where is the joyous,
unfettered spirit: Where is the sense of
communal harmonvr Where, foi
Chrissake, are the nekkid people?
Metal detectors, security guards
and dancing restrictions. I; s
positively... barbaric.
