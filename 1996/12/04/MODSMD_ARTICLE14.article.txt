Ethnic studies has
made it to Stanford
at last. Bravo!

IT'S BEEN A long, hard strug
gle, but all the efforts have
finally paid off.
After more than 25 years of stu
dent and faculty activism, the Uni
versity has established an ethnic
studies program that will allow stu
dents to major in Asian American
studies, Chicano studies, Native
American studies and comparative
studies in race and ethnicity. The
interdisclipinary program will offer
its first classes next quarter.
The word "bravo" best expresses
our thoughts on this recent devel
opment.
This kind of program is vital in
today's multicultural world: Stu
dents must be informed about and
understand all groups in society,
not just the predominant, white
one that we still learn about ad
nauseam in CIV (despite all the
attempts at reform). Uncovering
these minority groups "hidden"
histories is what the new majors
are all about — what makes mem
bers of these groups tick, what can
we learn from them, what are
important issues facing them?
These are questions worthy of
deeper intellectual study, and it's
time that Stanford formally recog
nized that.
For decades Stanford has
preached the importance of diversi
ty. Who doesn't remember receiv
ing those Res Ed handouts in the
mail prior to freshman year, which
proclaimed the glories of a diverse
dorm life? Who didn't take part in
the "Crossing the Line" program?
Yet while preaching this message
of acceptance and understanding of
all individuals, the University
failed to offer its students adequate
opportunities to do just that.
Although an African and Afro-
American studies major has existed
for 25 years, other ethnicities on
campus were noticeably ignored.

Meanwhile, Stanford's California
rivals — UCLA and UC-Berkeley
— had been home to Asian Ameri
can studies programs since the
early 19705.
On the bright side, it looks like
things have finally turned around.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
John Shoven and other faculty and
administrators deserve credit for
expanding the number of choices
available to those who want to pur
sue ethnic studies programs to
include Asian American studies,
Chicano studies and Native Ameri
can studies, as well as Afro-Ameri
can studies.
The new comparative ethnic pro
gram offers a number of benefits,
including a shared set of core cours
es, a large population of students
interested in majoring or minoring
in the program and a research insti
tute established in conjunction
with the program. Faculty from the
program are also looking at hosting
a national conference on racial rela
tions in 1999 — which would fur
ther help Stanford step into the
limelight in this area of intellectual
study.
However, a few words of warning
must be offered. Administrators
must make sure this important
program receives long-term sup
port.
Interdisclipinary programs in
general share a shaky future; just
remember what almost happened
to the Science, Technology and
Society Program last spring. The
University initially called an end to
the program due to a lack of faculty,
not student, interest. Although the
decision to end STS has since been
reversed, the proposed cutback
taught us an important lesson —
one that must be applied to the eth
nic studies program.
In order for the new program to
succeed in the long run, it must
receive proper nurturing from Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper
on down to the professor who
teaches in the core. The University
has set up something good; let's
make sure it stays that way.
