Parking policy mired in red tape, needs overhaul

The parking controver-
SEY seems to be growing, and it is
an issue long overdue for major
policy re-evaluation. In this vein, I can't
let the letter by Dan Connelly (Nov. 25)
stand without correcting some of the
self-serving misinformation promulgated
by the "Parking / Transportation Mafia"
and probably repeated by the Stanford
Bike Coalition.
First, Stanford land might be valued
at $1 million per acre by an appraiser if
it were to be sold, but it can't be â€” and
the land was free to the University as a
gift from the Stanfords. Land value is a
specious argument in this context unless
you're going to put more Shopping Cen
ter or Industrial Park on it.
No one is alleging a "right" to park. If
there were ways for myself, and many
others .I'm sure, to get here without cars
in reasonable amounts of time, we
would. The automobile as we know it
should and eventually will disappear, but

progression to that point will not be cat
alyzed by a Stanford policy. Please quit
punishing us for a societal ill over which
we have little control at the individual
level.
The P / T Mafia make Orwell's char
acters pale in comparison when it comes
to creating "newspeak." As to subsidies,
things really go exactly the opposite of
what they say. All those bike lockers,
Marguerite, etc., are mostly paid for by
vehicle parking fees. The public transit
many are unable to use for commuting is
primarily supported by taxes from all of
us.
Second, if you removed the tremen
dous expense of the Marguerite shuttle,
eliminated the cost of the salaries and
overhead of the P / T Mafia, eliminated
the running expense of pay parking
enforcement (including nearly a full-time
crew moving and servicing bollards and
other obstructions) and reappraised the
perceived need to have luxury parking

spaces, the cost per space is minimal. It
doesn't require bulldozers to make the
spaces either. Some people's aversion to
bulldozers applies apparently to new
parking lots, but not to tearing up per
fectly good existing ones (Governor's
Corner, Varian Physics) or constructing
new buildings. Why is it that the parking
lots are the things in the wrong place?
In March of this year I announced at a
Science and Engineering Quad meeting,
at which P / T Mafiosi were present, my
offer to create 500 parking spaces on
Stanford land at my expense, providing
the University would guarantee that
number of spaces would remain free in
perpetuity. My follow-up questioning of
the P / T office only elicited, "We will be
considering it."
Do you wonder why my offer hasn't
been accepted? Do you see an entrenched
bureaucracy unwilling to admit viable
alternatives to its self-righteous, self
serving plans?

I suggest to the Stanford community
that we must address Stanford's two
faced view of cars and its refusal to offer
adequate compensation for the up to
two or three hours per day extra taken
from our lives were many of us to use
the mostly inadequate public transporta
tion in this area. Student, faculty and
staff cars, we're told, are a terrible bur
den to the University and surrounding
communities.
On the other hand, apparently, cars of
patrons of the Stanford Shopping Center
are not, and the University is currently
on record as willing to spend millions to
facilitate them. The best "peripheral"
parking lot for commuting Stanford stu
dents, faculty and staff to use, served by
Marguerite even, is at the Stanford
Shopping Center. It is free to park there
so you can turn in your sticker now for a
refund and next year apply for a credit.
