# Remember, you can always stop out

As the quarter draws frantically to a
close, I wanted to remind all of my fel
low struggling students about Stanford's
amazing flexibility with taking time off.
I was miserable at the end of my first
quarter at Stanford and wish with all
my heart that some upperclassman had
told me that I could just leave without
being penalized at all.
Any student can simply unregister
himself or herself and leave for any
period of time. (I have a friend who
left for seven years and came back in
1993.) When you come back, all you do

is re-register and start again. No
explaining, no re-applying, nothing.
It's so simple and yet most people
never even consider it! I left for over a
year and had some great experiences.
Most importantly, I took a much-need
ed break from the pressures of school,
the expectations of my parents and the
general relentless pace of pre-profes
sional life.
Stanford is a remarkable place and
many people never feel a need to leave. I
have nothing against the college experi
ence, but for those of us who need it the
option to take a break is there. Many of
us have used it, and I have never heard
anyone regret the time off.
I, and many others I know, never
even questioned whether we'd go to col

lege. We just came. Taking time off was
my first step in making explicit choices
for myself about my priorities and my
goals in life. It can be terrifying to step
off the track and defy the expectations
and hopes of one's parents and peers,
but once done, one discovers that it's not
such a big deal after all, and nothing
could feel more right. Just ask anyone
whose done it. We're not hard to find.
