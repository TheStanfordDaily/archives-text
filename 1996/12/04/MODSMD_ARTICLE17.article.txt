# Lack of spirit due to administration
## 
### 
In an editorial on Nov. 25, The Daily
lamented an obvious lack of school spirit

surrounding the Cardinal football
team's strong late-season push, particu
larly the 42-21 drubbing of the dirty
Golden Bears.
The article went on to observe that
only two obvious parties took place on
campus following the victory.
Is it any surprise that Stanford
undergraduates have lost their ability to
party? For the last decade, they have
been pushed by the University itself to
become neo-Victorian, oh-so-serious stu
dents shunning all manifestations of
Bacchanalian debauchery. Lighten up
and let loose, guys and gals â€” when you
get into the "real world," it's no longer
allowed!
