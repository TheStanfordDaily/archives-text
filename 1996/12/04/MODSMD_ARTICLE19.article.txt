"Palm Springs is the perfect place for
the gay 90s, if you 're gay or you 're 90."
â€” Newsweek
IF YOU'RE STRAIGHT and young,
however, there's probably not a
more strange place to grow up. I
should know; I've lived there for almost
19 years.
In this holiday season, I find my
thoughts (and myself) headed home.
Never mind the four finals, three papers
and 17 job applications that need atten
tion. Last Wednesday, I hopped on a
plane and 75 minutes later, I found
myself in God's waiting room.
As I disembarked from the plane, I
was greeted by the mayor and several
TV crews. I was hardly shocked by the
reception from a town greeting its prodi
gal favorite son, but then I realized they
were all there to greet Tiger Woods, who
was arriving for this weekend's Skins
Game.
Golf. A way of life in the Coachella
Valley. Most places can claim to be golf
destinations if they've got 90 holes. The
Coachella Valley has more than 90
courses. What else is there to do in a
town where the average age qualifies
you for membership in AARP?
What does Palm Springs have to do
with our generation? Very little. Inter
estingly enough, the book which many
believe defines our generation, Douglas
Coupland's "Generation X," is set in my
very own hometown. Coupland writes
about three recent college graduates

who quit their pre-yuppie jobs and move
to Palm Springs in order to become
"refugees from history." In this regard,
Palm Springs is ideal since it seems
perennially stuck in the 19505, the
decade in which most of its residents
were at the peak of their careers.
There probably aren't two places
with less in common than Palm Springs
and Stanford. When I arrived here as a
freshman, half of the people thought I
was from Florida ("No, that's Palm
Beach"), while the other half would
usually cry out, "People actually live
there? My grandparents have a condo
there."
"Everyone's grandparents have a
condo there," I'd reply.
At Stanford, everyone is young. In
Palm Springs, everyone is old. At Stan
ford, you live in a nice place if your resi
dence has an automatic connection to
the Internet. In Palm Springs, your
property value escalates if your resi
dence has an emergency alarm automat
ically connected to the hospital. You get
the picture.
Politically, Stanford has Tom Camp
bell. Palm Springs has Sonny Bono.
Before him, our mayor was a cowboy.
In Palm Springs, "political correct
ness" means "I like Ike." Hell, the major
hospital is named after Eisenhower, and
the Coachella Valley is home to Gerald
Ford and (until recently) Spiro Agnew.
Speaking of PC, my high school's
nickname was the Palm Springs Indi
ans. Our rivals were the Palm Desert

Aztecs, the Indio Rsyas and the Coachel
la Fighting Arabs. I kid you not.
So why do Coupland's characters
come here? Quite simply, I live in the
land that time forgot. Ancient entertain
ers come to Palm Springs to wait for
death. Palm Canyon Drive, the town's
main thoroughfare, is dotted with drive
thru plastic surgery marts and bars fea
turing Vegas-style lounge acts.
My high school friends and I spent
our formative years here, so we are in
many ways "refugees from time," too.
Every opportunity we get, we come
home. We stay for a week, and then we
go insane with the desire to leave. I'd
invite everyone at Stanford to come over
for spring break, but my mom just
turned our guest room into a shrine of
sorts . . .
This Thanksgiving was no different
than any other trip home. I found
myself having lunch with about 10 old
friends on Friday, catching up as we
always do, sharing gossip and talking
about our fears of the future. "I
wouldn't mind settling down here after
school," one of my friends said, "but no
one really lives here, do they?"

Jim Finsten's life goal is to hold Sonny
Bono's seat and represent Palm Springs
in Congress.
