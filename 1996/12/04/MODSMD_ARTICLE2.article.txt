# Scholarly independence questioned
## Funding otter raises eyebrows 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
A recent offer from Taiwan to fund a
center for Chinese studies has raised some
concern about the influence that Asian
funding sources may have on American re
search and scholarship.
Early in the fall, the Taiwan-based Chi
ang Ching-kuo Foundation sent letters
inviting four American universities — Co
lumbia University, the University of
Chicago, UC-Berkeley and Stanford — to
apply for a grant to set up a center for Chi
nese studies.

But scholars are concerned about a con
troversial condition attached to the invita
tion — that the center be named after late
Taiwanese leader Chiang Ching-kuo, who
helped democratize Taiwan but only after
years of heading its oppressive secret po
lice. Chiang, the son of Chiang Kai-shek,
died in 1988.
Some professors said naming a center
after such a controversial figure could
damage the reputation of Stanford and
other universities as well.
"My own personal opinion is that we
need to be careful about what we agree to
give up in return for financial support. In

eluded in that category is name and repu
tation," said Political Science Prof. Daniel
Okimoto, director of Stanford's Asia / Pa
cific Research Center.
"It's important that if you name a pro
gram or a center or an institution after
someone, that that person be deserving of
that honor and that his or her reputation
will be associated with the institution it
self," he said.
The specific conditions of the invitation
are still unclear, according to Assoc. Asian
Language Prof. Haun Saussy.
"We don't know if this is an en
dowment or kind of a yearly contri
bution. We don't know if this is to
build up new programs or just to
add on to existing ones," Saussy
said. "All kinds of things are still up
in the air."
According to a recent article in
the San Jose Mercury News, the in
vitation from the Chiang Ching
kuo Foundation has raised concern
among scholars across the nation
about the growing dependence of
American scholars on Asian money
and the political and economic in
fluence that may give donor coun
tries.
But History Prof. Peter Duus,
director of the Center for East
Asian Studies, said Asian money is
not the dominant source of funding
for East Asian studies.
"The receipt of money from Asia
is nothing new at Stanford — it's
contributed to the growth of our
program," Duus said. "The bulk of
our funding comes from domestic
sources," such as the federal gov

ernment, foundations and the Uni
versity.
James Raphael, director of re
search at the Asia / Pacific Re
search Center, agreed that Asian
research at Stanford is not predom
inantly funded by Asian sources.
"Almost all the faculty are paid
out of the University budget, and
that's the lion's share of the re
search," Raphael said.
Although some have voiced con
cern about the conditions attached
to the invitation, Economics Prof.
Lawrence Lau, a member of the
board of the Chiang Ching-kuo
Foundation, said the foundation's
record proved it had never tried to
influence any of its grantees.
"I think the [ChiangChing-kuo]
Foundation has really operated at
the highest standards of economic
excellence, so I think the issue
should not even arise that there
were any strings attached," Lau
said.
According to Lau, the option of
rejecting the offer should remove
any cause for concern.
"The issue really is the fact that
some people want to honor him,
some people don't, and people are
free not to accept the offer," he said.

"If I give a building to Stanford, and
I want to name it after myself or
somebody, Stanford is free to reject
it.
"I don't think you can [influence
scholarship] at the very best insti
tutions," Lau added.
Still, others said it is important
to consider the invitation with cau
tion.
"Academic autonomy and schol
arly objectivity, these are prized
values in the world of universities,"
Okimoto said. "That any negative
association would be involved and
would compromise the integrity of
the University would have to be re
sisted."
"My personal view would be to
not go forward and seek this
money," he said. Okimoto also has
said the Asia / Pacific Research
Center is not interested in the
money.
But Okimoto commended the
way Stanford and other universi
ties have dealt with such proposals
in the past.
"My experience has been that
Stanford has been very cautious
and careful about the acceptance of
gift money, with good reason," he
said.
