# Scholarly independence questioned
## Funding otter raises eyebrows 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
A recent offer from Taiwan to fund a
center for Chinese studies has raised some
concern about the influence that Asian
funding sources may have on American re
search and scholarship.
Early in the fall, the Taiwan-based Chi
ang Ching-kuo Foundation sent letters
inviting four American universities — Co
lumbia University, the University of
Chicago, UC-Berkeley and Stanford — to
apply for a grant to set up a center for Chi
nese studies.

But scholars are concerned about a con
troversial condition attached to the invita
tion — that the center be named after late
Taiwanese leader Chiang Ching-kuo, who
helped democratize Taiwan but only after
years of heading its oppressive secret po
lice. Chiang, the son of Chiang Kai-shek,
died in 1988.
Some professors said naming a center
after such a controversial figure could
damage the reputation of Stanford and
other universities as well.
"My own personal opinion is that we
need to be careful about what we agree to
give up in return for financial support. In

eluded in that category is name and repu
tation," said Political Science Prof. Daniel
Okimoto, director of Stanford's Asia / Pa
cific Research Center.
"It's important that if you name a pro
gram or a center or an institution after
someone, that that person be deserving of
that honor and that his or her reputation
will be associated with the institution it
self," he said.
The specific conditions of the invitation
are still unclear, according to Assoc. Asian
Language Prof. Haun Saussy.
