## How did 'Dead Week' become 'End-Quarter Period'? 
### 
AT SOME MOMENT between
September 1993 — when I took my
first, little, tentative freshman
steps on the Farm — and now, Dead Week
officially became known by the University
as "End-Quarter Period."
What gives?
It's not that I'm a stick-in-the-mud; I
just hate when people change things with
out asking me first. I agree wholeheartedly
that "End-Quarter Period" is a much more
accurate and truthful description of Dead
Week, but as a columnist, I am in no way
concerned with either accuracy or the
truth.
It just seems to me that Dead Week is
the perfect, descriptive name for the 10th
week of every quarter — it conjures up
images of bloody, shredded bodies, decom
posing on the steps of Green Library, car
rying course readers and textbooks in what
used to be their hands. Dead Week stands
for pain and suffering and war and strife
culminating in final examinations that
leave the unprepared shrieking helplessly,
calling for mercy. "End-Quarter Period"

just sounds like a vacation on the Riviera.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Now I hear all those naysayers out there
saying "nay." They are not just saying
"nay." They are also saying stuff like, "You
can't stand in the way of progress, Jere
my," but it's easier for all if I refer to them
as "naysayers." These naysayers point out
that "if it weren't for progress, we may
never have witnessed such important tech
nological breakthroughs as wheelbarrows
and pingpong tables and television and
high-fructose corn syrup." And to this
statement, I have but one reply:
How can you scream a convincing Pri
mal Scream in a week that is known as
"End-Quarter Period"?
Who's the brilliant marketing genius
behind all this "progress" Stanford has
seen lately? Dead Week is gone. Pro fros
have been given the electnfyingly clever
moniker Admits (accent on the first sylla
ble). Courses and Degrees suddenly
became the Stanford Bulletin (although,
surprisingly, it still lists both courses and
degrees). DRs morphed into GERs. The

administration became known as
"Heather Dunn."
Like it or not, the times they are a
changin'. And with the average enrollment
expectancy of a Stanford student at about
four years (give or take), it seems that the
a-changin* continues to be accepted by
Stanford students through a bizarre, yet
predictable combination of apathy and
attrition.
Three years from now, no one will even
remember life before "party planning
guidelines." It will be incomprehensible
how anyone ever held a kegger without
"planning." In the year 2001, fifth-year
seniors will be sitting in rocking chairs on
their porches, saying, "Oh, yessirree, life
sure was different in the old days, way back
before those wacky iridescent orange
wristbands and all those police crackdowns
on minors!" All the naysayers will ignore
the crazy old men and simply say "nay" as
they walk by.
And speaking of minors, the new aca
demic minors have been accepted mighty
quickly as "progress" as well. For years,

the major / double-major dilemma has
allowed gung-ho academicians to pursue
the double major and the rest of us to enjoy
the one we remembered to declare by
Thanksgiving junior year. Minors, howev
er, are a whole different story. Almost
everyone I meet is planning on having at
least two minors. "I'm an econ major,
minoring in art history, Spanish, ee and
geology." Of course, more minors just
means more requirements and prerequi
sites and other classes we take only
because we have to take them. Whatever
happened to taking classes that you find
interesting?
This notion of "progress" over the last
few years appears to be an attempt by the
powers-that-be to infuse a no-nonsense,
hard-nosed, Ivy League mentality into
Stanford life. What the administration
consistently forgets, however, is this: If we
wanted that no-nonsense, hard-nosed, Ivy
League mentality, why would we be here at
Stanford? We would have chosen to go to
Harvard or Yale or some other school on
the East Coast with a hell of a lot more iw

and hell of a lot less sunshine. Remember,
Stanford didn't just choose us — we chose
Stanford. And why? Was it because we
were called "pro fros"? Because this week
was called "Dead Week"?
I'm not sure exactly why each of us
chose Stanford. All I know is that I chose to
be here because it was the one school that
stood out among the various choices. It
was fun, relaxed, quirky, sprawling, laissez
faire — in short, Stanford has it's own per
sonality. Whoever is trying to take away
that personality, I caution you: Ask a Stan
ford student what he or she wants before
you strive for "progress." Ask 'em why
they're here.
And if you don't like the answer, maybe
you should head east and find a little more
ivy.

Happy holidays and have yourself a merry
little Dead Week.
