# One citation given, Cal flags stolen in Big Game aftermath
## 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
Although the fans have gone home and the football
team is back at practice. Big Game hasn't ended for
some at Stanford and UC-Berkeley
UC-Berkeley police have cited a man for allegedly at
tacking the Tree at the end of the game. Fans have said
the Cal yell leaders may have been responsible for stu
dents storming the field at the end of the game — an ac
tion that resulted in the shredding of the Tree's cos
tume.
At Stanford, the OfTice of Student Activities is inves
tigating the thetl of two large blue llags reading "Cal"
from Berkeley's Memorial Stadium after the game.
Berkeley police confirmed yesterday that they have
cited 24-year-old Willem Whalen for battery in connec
tion to the attack on the Tree
Alumni eyewit ness reports put the blame on Cal yell
leaders for inciting the mob to attack the Tree.
Mike Biggar, Class of'Bl, who was sitting adjacent to
the Cal student section during Big Game, explained
that with about two minutes left in the game, the Cal
yell leaders prodded students to become violent,
"One of Cal yell leaders took the microphone and ex
horted the students as follows: 'OK, at the end of the
game we are going to storm the field and kill the (Stan
ford) Band and kill the Tree,' " Biggar said. "This in
citement was repeated several times.
"Sure enough, at the end of the game the students
rushed the field and did exactly that."
UC-Berkeley police said they aren't investigating the
report.
Junior Chris Cary, the Tree, said he finds it ironic

that UC-Berkeley police arrested only one person for
the attack.
"I feel kind of bad for the guy they arrested," Cary
said. "He was one of like 100 that were kicking the crap
out of me."
Cary added t hat he was surprised to see the game end
in such violent fashion.
"Up until the game ended, the crowd had been very
well-behaved," Cary said. "There wasn't nearly as
much fruit thrown from the st;mds as in other years.
The violence at the end of this year's game was a bizarre
sequence of events."
Cary also commented on the progress of his work to
replace the Tree costume.
"I have the unique opportunity to rebuild the Tree.
However, to spite to our friends across the Bay, I might
make the new Tree completely the same as the old one,"
Cary said. "They didn't seem to like that one too much."
Cary and his supporters have been collecting dona
tions for the new costume in White Plaza. He said they
have nearly reached their $850 goal.
The second crime committed Big Game day, alleged
ly by Stanford students, was the theft of two 7-foot.-long
Cal (lags immediately following the game.
"The bottom line is the flags are stolen property,"
said Heather Dunn, assist;int director of the Office of
Student Act ivities. "It doesn't matter how creative stu
dents were in obtaining them. It's time to be good sports
and give the flags back."
The flags should be returned to the Office of Student
Activities, she said.
"If they get returned, Berkeley won't file a police re
port," Dunn said. "But if t he flags tire found in some
one's room, that's a different story."
