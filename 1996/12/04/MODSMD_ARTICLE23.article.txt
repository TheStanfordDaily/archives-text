### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
Students shared stories about their experiences
with HIV and AIDS as part of a candlelight walk com
memorating World AIDS Day Monday.
About 15 people walked from White Plaza to the
Quad as part of the event, coordinated by the Haas
Center for Puhlic Service, Students Projects Coordi
nator Benjamin Morgan of Cowell Health Promotion
Services and a yet-to-be-named student social aware
ness group that formed this quarter.
According to Morgan, who coordinates student in
teraction with Cowell on various health projects, "It
was a nice event and pretty low-key. We sat around in
a circle, introduced ourselves, lit candles and walked
to the center of the Quad." Morgan said, "About one
third of us shared stories about experiences with
HIV/AIDS."
Morgan said the event was scheduled for Monday
rather than Sunday, the official World AIDS Day, be
cause most students were at home or had previous
engagements during the Thanksgiving vacation.

Freshman Jessica Werner, a participant, felt the
mood was "pretty upbeat. The people were encour
aged by the willingness to participate, though the
mood became more somber when people shared their
stories" about personal experiences.
Werner said she participated because "I feel that
my responsibility is to contribute as much as I can.
World AIDS Day is recognized worldwide."
Other participants said there was a lot of value to
supporting AIDS education. "There is always a level
of interest with HIV / AIDS," said Alyson Feldman,
who graduated in 1994 and currently is a teacher and
teaching assistant for health education courses. "I'm
really glad there is new energy in this issue."
Sophomore Emily Bard, who also participated in
the candlelight vigil, said, "I thought it was really
good, even though it wasn't that big. People got a
chance to share what was on their mind." According
to Werner, the student group that helped plan this
event is still writing its constitution and charter.
Among its goals is to become a coordinator for people
who want to be more involved with spreading social
awareness on issues including HIV and AIDS.
