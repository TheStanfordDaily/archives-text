# Stanford teams take top two spots in computer competition

Big Game was not the only victory for Stanford on
Nov. 23.
Three undergraduate students placed second at the
Association for Computing Machinery Pacific Region
al Programming Competition that day and will go on to
compete at the international competition in San Jose in
March.
The students who will compete at the international
tournament are junior Sean Treichler, senior Peter
Kim and sophomore Chad Whipkey.
Stanford sent two teams to the regional competition
in Fresno, Calif. The teams placed second and third
overall, with the University of Washington taking first
place.
Washington automatically advanced to the interna
tional competition as the top-scoring team at the re
gional level. Stanford's second-place team qualified to
compete in March as a wild card.
According to the competition's World Wide Web
site, it is targeted at providing "college students with an
opportunity to demonstrate and sharpen their prob
lem-solving and computing skills."
Forty-four teams competed at the regional competi
tion, which was sponsored by Microsoft Corp. Each
three-student team had five hours to solve eight com

plex problems with a computer as their only tool.
Kim descrilxxl the problems as an application of un
dergraduate computer science knowledge, such as si m
ple number theory and algorithms. Each problem re
quired the use of computer programs to solve it effi
ciently.
Stanford's second-place team answered five of the
eight problems correctly, while the team rapturing
third answered four correctly.
The team that placed third was made up of sopho
mores Hubie Chen and Theodore Hwa and senior
Grant Glouser.
Both Stanford teams worked on somewhat slower
computers than those used by the University of Wash
ington and most other schools at the regional competi
tion.
While the only prizes awarded at the regional com
petition were, as Treich ler put it,"the esteem of our fel
low peers," light blue T-shirts mid Microsoft Visual
Java software, the international competition has much
higher stakes.
The top 10 teams at the international competition
will be awarded scholarships ranging from $1,500 to
$12,000.
Although the students who will attend the interna
tional competition have not started training yet, Kim
said he expected them to meet and practice before then.
