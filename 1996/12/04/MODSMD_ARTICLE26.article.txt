# Asian Staff Forum honors three students
## 
### Kelly Vaughan 
The Asian Staff Forum will award $5,000
scholarships to three Stanford students at a
banquet tomorrow. The forum will also honor
C.J. Huang, who co-sponsored the forum's
benefit concert last year.
The Asian Staff Forum was founded to "pro
mote the interests of the Asian / Pacific / Indi
an subcontinent employees at Stanford Uni
versity . . . and to serve as a vehicle for repre
senting and supporting these employees," ac
cording to its mission statement.
In November 1994, the forum, along with
the C.J. Huang Foundation, put on a benefit
concert called "The Sound of Music," which
featured a variety of music ranging from selec
tions from Giacomo Puccini's "La Boheme" to
Bernstein's "West Side Story." About
100 people attended the concert, and proceeds
funded four scholarships last year in addition
to the three this year.
This year's scholarship winners are Camilla
Lau, a junior biology major, Winston Su, a
sophomore mechanical engineering major, and
Brian Wong, a senior biology major.

Lau works at a lab researching developmen
tal neurobiology and is an academic adviser
who has volunteered at the Lucile Salter
Packard Children's Hospital. Lau may take a
year off before applying to medical school,
where she would train to become a pediatri
cian. She is currently thinking of using her
time off to join the Peace Corps.
Su said he "just wantfedl to thank them
for putting this together." He volunteers for
the Palo Alto Police Department and plans to
become either an engineer or a law enforce
ment officer, perhaps for the FBI. He is work
ing on putting together an Internet engineer
ing tutoring program for high school stu
dents.
Wong is involved in research on Circadian
rhythms. He has also volunteered at the chil
dren's hospital and tutors children at Escondi
do Elementary School through the Stanford
Youth Project. Wong is applying to medical
schools and, like Lau, is considering specializ
ing in pediatrics.
Huang, a civil engineer, has served as an ad
viser to Congress, worked on petroleum engi
neering projects in Thailand and Singapore

and published a book of calligraphy. In 1988,
he established a scholarship fund of $400,000
at the Stanford School of Medicine to train
physicians from his native province of Hunan,
China.
Scholarship recipients were chosen by the
Financial Aids Office on the basis of academics
and financial need, according to Linda Taoka, a
spokeswoman for the Asian Staff Forum. The
scholarships are awarded solely on the initia
tive of the forum; the recipients did not apply
for them.
The banquet will be "brief and simple," said
Taoka. The forum's chair, Pam Kwok, will be
master of ceremonies. Kwok will introduce the
scholarship winners, Huang will speak and
some of last year's winners may update the
forum on their current activities.
One of last year's recipients, Maia Young, a
senior majoring in psychology, said she thinks
the program "shows the diversity within the
Asian-American community because the recip
ients I've met are different and have different
strengths.
"It goes against the stereotypes of Asians
being only hard science types," she said.
