A Mendocino County man
apprehended by Stanford Police
last week on charges of heroin
possession, stealing a child, en
dangering a child and providing
a minor with controlled sub
stances remains in jail in lieu of
a $1 million bail.
Danny Dederick was initially
taken into custody Nov. 26 by
Stanford Patrol Officer Kath
leen Swineford as his car left a
psychiatric facility at 401 Quar
ry Road.
A staff member at the facility
called Stanford Police initially
to report the car because of
"what looked like suspicious ac
tivity," said Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer.
According to Niemeyer, the
caller described a car with two
men in the front and two young
girls in the rear, one of whom
was nude.
Niemeyer said that when
Swineford ran a record check on
the two men in the car, she
found that the passenger, 39-
year-old William Jeffrey John
son, had four outstanding war
rants. The warrants totaled
$21,000, including a felony war
rant for narcotics.
According to Niemeyer, the
other man, Dederick, also 39,
was wanted at the time for child
stealing, child endangerment
and providing a minor with con
trolled substances.
The two girls in the rear of
the car, said Niemeyer, were
Dederick's children of whom he
currently has sole custody.

It is unclear what the men
were doing at the psychiatric fa
cility, said Niemeyer, but their
presence at the facility is be
lieved to be related to a 14-year
old girl being treated at the fa
cility.
The 14-year-old girl, who is
from Mendocino County, is al
leged to have been harbored by
Dederick when she ran away
from home Aug. 16, according
to Deputy Tim Frecceri, the
Stanford officer currently in
vestigating the case.
The Stanford investigation,
said Niemeyer, revealed that
Dederick brought the girl to the
Bay Area while allegedly har
boring her. The girl, who ran
away from home for about a
week, confirmed that Dederick
provided her with cocaine and
heroin during this time.
On Saturday, during further
investigation of the case, Stan
ford Police searched Dederick's
vehicle. According to Niemeyer,
police found 12 grams of tar
heroin stashed in stereos in the
vehicle's trunk. Along with the
heroin, police also found a bal
ance scale.
Because of the evidence
found during the vehicle search,
Dederick is now being charged
with possession of controlled
substances and possession of
controlled substances with the
intent to sell.
The investigation of the case
is continuing, primarily in Men
docino County.
Dederick's children, ages 8
and 14, are currently in protec
tive custody at a children's shel
ter.
