## You, your body and finals, finals, finals Alleviating finals-week stress crucial for health Stress offsets balance of body's physiological systems leading to disease 
### Bruce Wang 
Ah, finals week. Nothing's bet
ter at driving up a student's stress
odometer.
Yes, as hard as it is for some to
believe, even Stanford students
worry about finals. So what exactly
is stress, and how does it affect
you?
Stress is a strain or interference
that disrupts the homeostasis, or
internal balance, of the body. It
activates the body's sympathetic
nervous system, which is responsi
ble for the "fight-or-flight" emer
gency response under stressful sit
uations.
During a stress-response, the
sympathetic nervous system kicks
in by releasing hormones such as
epinephrine — otherwise known as
adrenaline — norepinephrine and
glucocorticoids into the blood
stream. These hormones collective
ly speed up the heartbeat, raise
blood pressure and pump energy to
muscles, as well as having an
assortment of other effects.
So stress basically gives the
body a huge burst of energy. The
catch is it's only for a short period
of time.
According to Biology Prof,
liobert Sapolsky, a stress-response
actually does improve cognition for
up to about an hour.
"You are more alert. Memory
recall and formation is better, more
sensitive to sensory information,"

Sapolsky said. "However, once the
stress has gone on for more than
an hour or so, cognition starts to be
impaired."
Stress makes the body operate
at a high energy level, and eventu
ally the body starts to break down.

As Sapolsky discusses in his
book, "Why Zebras Don't Get
Ulcers," stress shuts down the
parasympathetic nervous system,
the part of the brain that controls
calm, vegetative activities such as
digestion and growth.
During a stress response,

metabolism of food is shut down so
that there is no net body intake of
nutrients. If sustained long
enough, the body will experience
fatigue, the immune system will
break down, and a variety of dis
eases can be born.

To conserve energy for the
stress response, the stomach stops
producing the protective mucus
lining and bicarbonate. As a result,
ulcers often form after periods of
severe stress.
Thus when the body starts to
function normally again — like it

will after finals — and when diges
tion returns to normal levels, not
enough buffering solution is avail
able to neutralize the acid in the
stomach, and a peptic ulcer forms.
Heart problems are also com
mon among people under high

Johnny Zannis — Daily
stress. An elevated blood pressure
damages the branching points of
blood vessels, creating plaques and
eventually leading to atherosclero
sis, or the clogging of the arteries.
During a stress-response, the
body wants to conserve as much
energy as possible for the emergen

cy at hand.
Because the body wants to be as
light and unencumbered as possi
ble during a stressful "fight-or
flight" situation, it doesn't help to
carry around a couple of extra
pounds of waste.
Thus, that dorm dinner gets
rushed along through the large
intestines without giving the body
a chance to reabsorb the water,
resulting in diarrhea.
Glucocorticoids released into
the bloodstream during stress
increase appetite. Because gluco
corticoids tend to stay in the body
hours after the stress response is
over, people find themselves
munching on bag after bag of
chips while cramming for that
final.
So how do you deal with stress?
Sapolsky said one of the most
important things a student can do
is to "be aware of what daily coping
mechanisms work best [for you]."
Keep doing your normal rou
tine: your daily workout, daily
music, etc. "Keeping those activi
ties a priority is as important as
reviewing notes from class," said
Sapolsky
Studies have shown that regular
exercise helps reduce the effect of
the stress-response. Meditation
also has been found to reduce levels
of glucocorticoids during stress.
Psychological reframing —
maintaining perspective — is also
very important.

"An exam, a class, a quarter at
college is important, but not THAT
important," said Sapolsky.

In lieu of the evidence that psy
chological perception of stress can
drastically affect the stress
response, the most important cop
ing technique may be psychological
support Countless studies have
been done showing the importance
of psychological support in alleviat
ing stress.
Friends can provide outlets for
frustration and can act as pillars to
lean on.
"Make sure you're not going
through the stress of the period
alone," Sapolsky said. "Don't be
afraid to lean on friends and wel
come them doing it in return."
