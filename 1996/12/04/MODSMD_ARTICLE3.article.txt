# Athletics Dept may see small profit in Sun Bowl
## 
### Dana Hangai Staff writer 
In contrast to last year's postseason
game, this year's Sun Bowl will likely re
sult in a small profit for the Department of
Athletics, Athletic Director Ted Leland
said.
The Sun Bowl committee is giving the
University about $1 million for travel ex
penses to play in the Dec. 31 game in El
Paso, Texas. The University also agreed to
purchase 8,000 tickets at $35 apiece, ac
cording to Asst. Athletic Director Gary
Migdol.

'The only money we spend
is the money we draw from
athletic games. We actually
help subsidize the
University.'
— Ted Leland

When the football team played in the
Liberty Bowl last year, the Athletics De
partment had a shortfall of $14,000 and
was unable to sell all of the 18,000 tickets
it was obligated to purchase. The Liberty
Bowl expenses prompted some students to
write letters to The Daily asking the Uni
versity to justify the costs.
This year, Leland said, the Athletics De
partment might make a small profit from
the Sun Bowl. However, he emphasized
that playing in the Sun Bowl is not a finan
cial issue and that all money comes from
the department's budget, not the Univer
sity's general funds.
"The only money we spend is the money
we draw from athletic games," said Leland.
"We actually help subsidize the University."
Part of the revenue generated from
ticket sales and television advertising goes

into the University's gen
eral fund.
Migdol said it is standard
procedure for bowl commit
tees to obligate universities
to purchase a block of tick
ets. However, because of
the smaller number of pur
chased tickets this year, the
University should be able to

A concern expressed in one letter last
year was the cost of travel expenses. The
Liberty Bowl committee gave the depart
ment $750,000 to cover expenses, which
the student felt was too high to send the
football team to Memphis, Tenn.
Leland, however, said the money did
not cover the total expenses. The expenses,
he added, included housing the football
team for a week and a half before the game
for practice, chartering an airplane for
both the players and coaches and paying
for lodgings in Memphis.
In addition, the number of unsold tick
ets cut into the $750,000, and it was only
through alumni donations that the depart
ment was able to reduce its deficit to
$14,000.
If the department does lose money on
the transaction, Leland said, it will only af
fect the Athletics Department and will not
hurt the funding for any other sports.
"In the long run, our ability to fund this
program is financial success in football,
but we're not whipsawed on a year-to-year
basis," said Leland. "We have enough cash
reserves and endowments to make it
through" the year without any problems.
In the end, Migdol said, neither ticket
sales nor the image of the University not
determines whether the football team
should attend a bowl game.
"Going to a bowl game is a good thing,"
said Migdol. "It's good for the overall Ath
letics Department, it's good for the football
department and it's good for the students
and the community around Stanford Uni
versity."
