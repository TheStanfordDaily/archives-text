# Trying to stay awake
## Caffeine stimulates the nervous system 
### Charlotte Wu 
Caffeine — the nectar of the
night owl and a college student's
vice — has been an integral part
of many college students since the
founding of the first university.
Although caffeine's effects are
varied, its most prevalent use,
especially among college stu
dents, is to increase alertness and
ward off drowsiness when study
ing.
"The reason that I drink coffee
is for its stimulus effect," said
freshman Eric Barrett. "I don't
drink it for pleasure."
Physiological effects
The short-term physiological
effects of caffeine on the body

late certain neurotransmitters in
the body's central nervous sys
tem, which then has effects
throughout the body. This causes
the caffeine's "lift."
"Coffee is like a cold shower,"
said freshman Suleman Sheikh.
"Since actually taking a cold
shower takes too much effort and
time, drinking coffee is like giving
your brain a cold shower."
Although a person may feel
more energized by the physiologi
cal effects of caffeine, it may not
increase studying ability. Some
studies have shown that caffeine
can decrease reaction time and
does not significantly alter
numerical reasoning, short-term
memory or verbal fluency, accord
ing to the Caffeinated Home Page
World Wide Web site.

"Drinking coffee late at night
disturbs the sleep of people even if
they don't think it does," said
Cowell Staff Physician John Dor
man. Research has shown that
caffeine in the body can lead to a
poorer quality of sleep, restless
ness and insomnia.
Caffeine is also known to have
some headache-relieving proper
ties — although one of the typical
side effects of caffeine withdrawal
is mild headaches.
This contradiction may be
explained by the fact that caffeine
acts to dilate some blood vessels
while constricting others.
Addiction, withdrawal
Whether or not caffeine con
sumption is addictive is not as
clear-cut.
According to Dorman, people
many seem to develop a rapid
immunization to the effects of
caffeine. With the habitual intake
of caffeine, a person may build up
increased levels of enzymes to
break down the chemical.
Some people argue that if a
person experiences withdrawal
symptoms it may signify an addic
tion.
Caffeine use is "more of a
dependence than an addiction.
Addiction's a strong word," said
Dorman.
Withdrawal of caffeine use
depends on the individual but can
involve the onset of mild tempo
rary effects, such as headaches,
irritability and nervousness,
according to a report published by
the International Food Informa
tion Council Foundation.
The Caffeinated Home Page
suggests easing off the caffeine
habit by slowly reducing the
amount of caffeine consumption
over an extended period of time,
drinking plenty of caffeine-free
liquids.
"I think (the withdrawal symp
toms 1 varies more from person to
person," Dorman said "It's bet
ter to wean yourself off rather
than going cold turkey."
Alternatives to coffee
The demand for substances
that provide the same stimulating
effect as caffeine has led to a
plethora of energy-enhancing
products to be found on the mar-

ket as an alternative to drinking
coffee or soda.
Bottled caffeinated water can
now be found on supermarket
shelves that contain the same
amount of caffeine as one cup of
coffee and taste the same as
water.
Water Joe was developed by a
college student who did not like
the taste of coffee or colas but
needed to stay awake during
late night study sessions.
"If you don't want to drink
coffee .. . then it is much more
convenient to drink Icaffeine
enhanced waterj. Plus, water's
good for you," said freshman Will
Spencer.
Other products that do not
contain caffeine but use other
natural energy-enhancing sub
stances such as Chinese herbs
claim to have the same effect as
caffeine. Examples includes Rooi
bos, a brand of tea that claims the
"lack of caffeine means that it
can be enjoyed in unlimited
quantities."
