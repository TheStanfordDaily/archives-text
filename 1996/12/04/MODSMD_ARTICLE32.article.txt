# Sleep key to effective studying
## Research shows sleep deprivation impairs body functioning

As finals rapidly approach, a
good night's sleep may seem
more like a fantasy than a reality.
A good night's sleep may be
one of the most essential compo
nents of an effective study strate
gy, according to Clete Kushida, a
staff physician and senior
research associate at Stanford's
Sleep Disorders Clinic and
Research Center.
Consequences of sleep depri
vation are more severe than the
expected daytime sleepiness and
can include reduced short-term
memory, the inability to concen
trate and prolonged reaction
times. Increased irritability, con
fusion and headaches have also
been associated with sleep depri
vation.
Moreover, severe performance
deficiencies have been demon
strated in people who have been
partially and chronically sleep
deprived — defined as three to
four hours of sleep per night for
several weeks.
In fact, in a study published
earlier this year, in the journal
Hypertension, subjects who had
only 3 1/2 hours of sleep were
shown to have significantly ele
vated blood pressures compared

to subjects with eight hours of
sleep.
Although the mechanism by
which sleep deprivation affects
performance is unknown, the
stage of sleep that is most severe-

ly reduced, REM sleep, is believed
to be involved in memory consoli
dation.
An article in the Canadian
Medical Journal published earlier
this year said the "memory
required to perform cognitive
procedural tasks is affected by
the loss of rapid-eve-movement
iREM) sleep on the first night
after learning occurs and again
on the third night after learning."
However, there is good news:
REM sleep loss does not affect
declarative memory, which is
used for the recall of specific
facts.
Sleep deprivation may also
adversely affect health and
immune functions. It has been
reported that sleep deprivation
has been associated with a
decrease in natural killer T cell
activity, important in the body's
immune function.
In a study published earlier
this year in the Faseb Journal,
subjects who were partially
deprived of sleep, between the
hours of 10 p.m. and 3 a.m.,
showed a significant decrease in
immune function. After a night
of sleep recovery, immune func
tion was restored to baseline lev
els.
Additionally, it has been report
ed that rats completely deprived of
sleep did not survive longer than
16 days. In his doctoral thesis
research at the University of
Chicago, Kushida discovered that
rats deprived of REM sleep died
after 27 days.
Long-term sleep deprivation
studies in humans have not been
conducted due to ethical consider
ations.
Sleep deprivation has also
been partially implicated with
numerous global accidents
including the Three Mile Island
nuclear power plant disaster, the
NASA Challenger explosion, the
Union Carbide Rhopal chemical
disaster and the Exxon Valdez oil
spill.
