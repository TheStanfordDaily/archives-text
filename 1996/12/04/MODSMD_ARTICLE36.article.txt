# Winter storm patterns may be affected by global warming
## Formation of winter storms 
### Anne Ruimy Contributing writer 
The start of the rain season has
brought relief to coastal California,
a region where little or no rain falls
during the summer.
The winter rain may take the
form of anything from a light driz
zle to a violent storm. Prediction is
thus important because of the
damage that storms may bring
upon human property and ecosys
tems.
In recent years, California has
had some unusual weather, for
example, the particularly wet win
ter of 1994-95. This has tempted
some to speculate whether human
induced climate change may have
some influence on the winter
storm pattern in the state.
While scientists expect global
warming to affect the California
climate, they cannot yet foresee
which direction this change might

take.
"Global warming is a fact," said
Biology Prof. Steve Schneider, a
specialist in environmental science
and policy. He said most scientists
are now convinced that there is a
relationship between human activ
ities and the detected increase of
half a degree in the Earth's surface
temperature in the last 100 years.
Human activities, driving cars
in particular, have led to an
increase in "greenhouse gases"
such as carbon dioxide in the atmo
sphere. The resulting greenhouse
effect — the trapping of heat at the
Earth's surface — is not the only
factor affecting the climate.
The situation is complicated by
the general circulation of winds in
the atmosphere and currents in the
ocean. The atmosphere, land and
ocean have different time respons
es to increasing carbon dioxide lev
els in the atmosphere.
"Is there a change? Yes. Which

way, how much? We can't say,"
said Schneider.
To understand the current situ
ation and make predictions for the
future, climatologists are building
computer models, called General
Circulation Models, or GCM.
Scott Denning, an assistant pro
fessor at UC-Santa Barbara, par
ticipated in the development of a
GCM at Colorado State University.
This model was used to predict
the climate in a future environ
ment with a doubled carbon diox
ide concentration in the atmo
sphere, a situation predicted to
happen during the next century.
According to Denning, the cli
mate predictions of GCMs are valid
only at scales no smaller than con
tinents.
"We can barely predict global
means, let alone patterns," he said.
"You'd be on very controversial
ground to say something about
predictions for the California

coast."
Some theories, however, tell
qualitatively how climate change
may affect the winter storm pat
tern in California.
The primary force that gener
ates the storms affecting California
is a gradient of temperature. A
zone of atmospheric instability
called the polar front separates cold
polar air masses and warm tropical
air masses.
In winter, when the intensity of
the sun rays declines in the North
ern Hemisphere, the polar front
moves from northern latitudes to
more temperate ones.
Big eddies occasionally develop
along the polar front. The jet
stream, a strong wind blowing
from west to east along the polar
front, pushes these eddies toward
the California coast, bringing wind
and rain storms.
The potential effects of global
warming on winter storms are

complex.
On the one hand, warmer air
temperatures lead to warmer sea
surface temperatures, generating
more rain. On the other hand,
warming is expected to affect polar
zones more than tropical zones,
weakening the temperature gradi
ent responsible for winter storms
in temperate areas. This would
result in weaker storms.
According to Denning, another
important factor for the climate in
California is El Nino, a shift in the
air and ocean currents in the equa
torial Pacific Ocean.
In El Nino years, which are
every three to seven years, coun
tries bordering the western Pacif
ic Ocean may experience
droughts, while the California
coast may experience thunder
storms unlike the characteristic
winter storms.
"California tends to get much
more rain during El Nino years

than regular years," Denning said.
The El Nino cycle may be affect
ed by global warming. "Climate
change makes persistent El Nino.
In the early '90s, for reasons that
nobody understands, we went into
that. Some people think it's an
indicator of climate change," Den
ning said.
GCMs are a long way from being
able to predict changes in the win
ter storm pattern in California, but
they are routinely used to make
short-term weather predictions.
While GCMs used in climate
change studies are allowed to run
free for decades or centuries, use of
GCMs in weather forecasting
depends on knowing precisely the
initial conditions. The accuracy of
predictions decreases steadily with
time, due to the chaotic behavior of
the atmosphere.
John Burkhardt, a meteorolo
gist at the National Weather Ser
vice in Monterey, Calif., uses com
puter maps generated by the
National Meteorological Center to
predict storms that will hit Califor
nia, up to 10 days in advance.
"You see them aligned in the
ocean like boxcars of a train, you
see where they're coming," he said.
"It looks like two will affect us
early December — both weak, par
ticularly by the time they reach
us."
Meteorologists also produce
long-range forecasts. "Given the
current patterns, the jet streams
positioned where they're expected
to stay all winter, we can make gen
eralized predictions for seasons,"
said Rick Canepa, a meteorologist
at the National Weather Service.
This year, it looks like precipita
tion and temperatures in Califor
nia will be "close to normal for
November, December, January,"
Canepa said.

important factor for the climate in
California is El Nino, a shift in the
air and ocean currents in the equa
torial Pacific Ocean.
In El Nino years, which are
every three to seven years, coun
tries bordering the western Pacif
ic Ocean may experience
droughts, while the California
coast may experience thunder
storms unlike the characteristic
winter storms.
"California tends to get much
more rain during El Nino years

than regular years," Denning said.
The El Nino cycle may be affect
ed by global warming. "Climate
change makes persistent El Nino.
In the early '90s, for reasons that
nobody understands, we went into
that. Some people think it's an
indicator of climate change," Den
ning said.
GCMs are a long way from being
able to predict changes in the win
ter storm pattern in California, but
they are routinely used to make
short-term weather predictions.
While GCMs used in climate
change studies are allowed to run
free for decades or centuries, use of
GCMs in weather forecasting
depends on knowing precisely the
initial conditions. The accuracy of
predictions decreases steadily with
time, due to the chaotic behavior of
the atmosphere.
John Burkhardt, a meteorolo
gist at the National Weather Ser
vice in Monterey, Calif., uses com
puter maps generated by the
National Meteorological Center to
predict storms that will hit Califor
nia, up to 10 days in advance.
"You see them aligned in the
ocean like boxcars of a train, you
see where they're coming," he said.
"It looks like two will affect us
early December — both weak, par
ticularly by the time they reach
us."
Meteorologists also produce
long-range forecasts. "Given the
current patterns, the jet streams
positioned where they're expected
to stay all winter, we can make gen
eralized predictions for seasons,"
said Rick Canepa, a meteorologist
at the National Weather Service.
This year, it looks like precipita
tion and temperatures in Califor
nia will be "close to normal for
November, December, January,"
Canepa said.
