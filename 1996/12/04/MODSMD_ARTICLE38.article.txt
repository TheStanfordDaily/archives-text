# Scientists use blood samples to show genetic link to autism
## 
### Nina Chinosornvatana 
Several recent studies have indi
cated a genetic link to autism, also
claiming chemical serotonin may
play a role in the childhood syn
drome.
The little-understood neuropsy
chiatry disease is described by pro
nounced ritualistic motions and
difficulties in social interaction.
The research was published in the
November issue of the American
Medical Association's Archives of
General Psychiatry.
Stanford researchers have been
examining the possibility of a
genetic cause of autism for several
years, as part of research allied
closely with the Human Genome
Project, an international undertak
ing to map out the genes of each
human chromosome.
Stanford's work has centered
around neurological disorders
including autism, epilepsy and

Huntington's disease.
The research team — led by
Human Genome Project Director
Richard Myers, Genetics Prof. Neil
Risch and Rallen Saranelli — is in
the process of collecting samples
from autistic patients and geneti
cally analyzing them.
A sibling-pair approach is being
used to apply the genetic inheri
tance seen in the disorder. The
team is targeting those families
containing two sibling autists.
Nearly 400 blood samples from
100 families have been collected.
Each of these samples are geno
typed, then compared for corre
sponding discrepancies in portions
of the chromosomes.
Once discrepancies are found,
the samples can be tested to see
whether there is a relation to the
disease. Myers believes that while a
"hit," the discovery of discrepan
cies, could happen any day, the
team hopes to reach its goal within

a year.
Dr. Joachim Hallmayer of the
University of Western Australia
and formerly of Stanford has been
working in collaboration with the
Stanford team.
He has been pursuing the possi
bility that genes residing specifical
ly on the X chromosome may play a
role in autism and is using the sib
ling-pair approach as well. His
report shows that while there is
not a specific gene causing autism,
there may be a combination of
genes on this chromosome and oth
ers that cause the disease.
Scientists have suspected that
autism has been linked to genetics
for some time. Statistics show that
the sibling of an autistic patient is
75 times more likely to have the
disease than the patient and a
stranger.
With the onset of more sophisti
cated tools and the discoveries
made from the mapping of the

human genome, a multitude of dis
eases have been found to have
genetic ties, including diabetes,
heart disease, hypertension and
cancer.
However, unlike disorders such
as cystic fibrosis and Huntington's
disease, autism is not clearly reces
sive.
These diseases involve one gene
each, while autism involves many
genes making it more difficult to
predict. Researchers believe that
because multiple genes are
involved, several mutations in spe
cific chromosomes are needed for
this disorder to surface.
Autism is a developmental dis
order characterized by repetitive
movement and stunted communi
cation.
The symptoms of autism vary in
magnitude and include self-injury,
a lack of eye contact, abnormal
speech and aggression. Autists may
display ritualistic actions such as

flapping hands, repeating words or
rocking for hours on end. Autists
have limited areas of interests and
may be extraordinarily gifted in
specific areas.

Autistic patients have difficul
ties responding to their surround
ings and are not aware of the
actions or emotions of others.
At the present, there is no
definitive treatment for this dis

ease or its symptoms. Because all
autists have very specific and simi
lar symptoms, researchers suspect
there may be a genetic link.
Two studies carried out by Dr.
Christopher McDougle of Yale Uni
versity confirm that serotonin may
be the appropriate medication for
the disease.
In the first study, the medica
tion fluvoxamine maleate — a sub
stance which increases the sero
tonin in the brain — led to
improvement in more than half of
the patients. The drug decreased
the amount of repetitive move
ment and aggression and improved
the patients' verbal communica
tion with others.
In the second study, autistic
patients were given a diet which
deprived them of the amino acid
tryptophan, which is necessary for
the synthesis of serotonin. More
than 60 percent of these patients
worsened significantly.
