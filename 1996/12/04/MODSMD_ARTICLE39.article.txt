A .Common table salt, or
• sodium chloride, is an
ionic substance.
This means that salt is actu
ally composed of ions, which are
charged atoms or molecules. In
the case of table salt, the two
ions are sodium and chloride,
which you could have figured
out from its chemical name.
Salt, in its solid form, is a reg
ular lattice of ions. The ions are
arranged in a framework which
looks like a jungle gym, except
on a much smaller scale.
When salt is dissolved in
water, these ions are hydrated.
This means that the water
molecules disrupt and break
open the lattice and each ion
becomes surrounded by a
"shell" of water molecules which
then float off into solution.
When water freezes, it also
forms a highly ordered lattice,
much like the framework which
the salt ions were in originally.
However, the water lattice is not
very good at accommodating
other components into its lat

tice. Water, in its ice form is
quite elitist about what gets to
be in its solid lattice.
In order to freeze, though,
the water cannot continue to
hydrate the ions in solution.
This means that not only does
the water need to form up into
its orderly little lattice when it
freezes, but it also needs to kick
out all of the unwanted,
vagrant, non-water molecules
that are in solution. This causes
the freezing point of salt water
to be lower than normal water's.
When salt is added to ice,
usually it lowers the freezing
point enough so that the ice is no
longer below the freezing point.
This melts the ice and prevents
people from slipping on your
sidewalk and suing you for lots
of money.
Salt is not the only thing that
will lower the freezing point of
water. Almost anything that dis
solves in water will lower its
freezing point.
This property is called freez
ing-point depression, and it is
used in places other than side
walks. Anti-freeze uses ethylene
glycol to lower the freezing point
of your radiator fluid so that it
doesn't freeze as easily.
Also, because freezing causes
the water to exclude impurities
from the ice, freezing can be
used to purify water.
You may have noticed that
when you make ice, little air
bubbles appear in the middle of
the ice cubes. This happens
because dissolved air is forced
out of solution when water
freezes.
And if you've ever tried to
make ice out of mineral water,
the excluded minerals usually
appear as sludge at the bottom
of the ice cube tray. Not only is it
not healthier to make ice out of
mineral water, but it's more dis
gusting to clean out.
