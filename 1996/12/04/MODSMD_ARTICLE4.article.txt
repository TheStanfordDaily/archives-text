## Jamba Juice gets spot in Tresidder 
### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
Stanford students will no longer have to
leave the Farm to enjoy the exotic delights of
Strawberries Wild, Pacific Passion and Or
ange Oasis because Jamba Juice will open in
Tresidder Union in April.
The eagerly awaited announcement of a
juice bar vendor came late last week, after
the University signed a five-year lease with
Jamba Juice, the parent company of Juice
Club, Dean of Students Marc Wais said.
Jamba Juice's menu is identical to that of
Juice Club.
"I am very, very excited about the
prospect of having Jamba Juice in Tresid
der," Wais said. "This is just another step in
making Tresidder a hub of student activi
ty."

Jamba Juice will be located where Stan
ford Hairstyling currently is on the first
floor of Tresidder. The barber, under the
new name Stanford Hair, will move to the
space behind Polio Key.
The Tresidder Union Advisory Board,
which consists of students, faculty and staff,
had been discussing the possibility of bring
ing a juice bar to campus for several months,
said its chairman, senior Kevin Barenblat.
"This is what we've been hoping for for a
longtime," Barenblat said.
Wais said the work of the advisory board
was instrumental in bringing Jamba Juice
to Stanford.
"I really want to applaud this year and
last year's Tresidder advisory boards for
their hard work," Wais said. "The seniors
from last year laid a lot of the
groundwork for bringing this juice
bar to campus. Unfortunately,
they can't really realize the fruits of
their labor."
Barenblat, who facilitated the
presentations of various vendors,
including the other two finalists,
Juice It and Odwalla, said Jamba
Juice "offered the best package for
Stanford.
"Jamba Juice has many incen
tives," Barenblat said. "It will be
involved in sponsoring athletics
and other student activities. It will
also stay open late to accommodate
students."
Wais said Jamba Juice was cho
sen according to five main criteria:
the quality of its product, its con
sistency and longevity as a corpora
tion, its appeal to Stanford stu
dents, the scope of its menu and its
competitive pricing.
"Jamba Juice is really a leader in
the industry," Wais said.
Negotiations with Jamba Juice
began in early October and lasted
until last week, when the lease was
signed, Wais said. Leonie Batkin, a
representative of Stanford Man
agement Co., negotiated the lease
for the advisory board.
Batkin said she was pleased that
the University and Jamba Juice
were able to agree on a contract.
"Jamba Juice will be convenient
for students and staff and also for
anyone visiting the campus,"
Batkin said.
Now that the lease is signed, the
University needs a permit from
Santa Clara County to reconfigure
the space in Tresidder where the
juice bar will be, Wais said. Nearly

3,000 square feet of space remains
open in Tresidder; the advisory
board is seeking other vendors to
locate in the space near the Stan
ford Store. The ASSU President's
Office is soliciting suggestions
from students.
After the Juice Club in Palo
Alto's Town & Country shopping
center closed last summer due to a
fire in an adjacent restaurant, reg
ular customers of the juice bar have
had to travel a little farther to pur
chase smoothies and other fruit
beverages. The nearest Juice Club
is in Cupertino, a 20-minute drive

from Stanford.
The Town & Country Juice
Club is expected to open within the
next couple of months, said Joe
David, a representative of Juice
Club.
Although the alternative prod
ucts at other juice stores such as
the Original Smoothie Co. on El
Camino Real are similar to those of
Juice Club, the distance to these
other juice bars is a distinct draw
back.
When Jamba Juice opens in the
spring, though, students will have
to go no farther than Tresidder to

enjoy the smoothies that have be
come favorites among many.
In keeping with the arrival of
Polio's and the Stanford Store on
the first floor of Tresidder, Jamba
Juice will be another addition to
the "healthy competition" in the
Stanford community, Wais said.
"The new vendors are doing a
great job feeding off one another,"
Wais said. "Everyone will benefit
from having their services."
And with Jamba Juice, Tresid
der will be able to offer the Univer
sity community yet another food
service.
