— Carl Zwanzig
There is a theory which states that if ever anybody dis
covers exactly what the universe is for and why it is
here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by
something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is
another theory which states that this has already hap
pened. — Douglas Adams
Only two things are infinite, the universe and human
stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former. — Albert
Einstein
Astronomers say the universe is finite, which is a com
forting thought for those people who can't remember
where they leave things. — Unknown

In answer to the question of why it happened\ I offer the
modest proposal that our universe is simply one of those
things which happen from time to time. — Edward P.
Tryon
We are an impossibility in an impossible universe.
— Ray Bradbury
I'm worried that the universe will soon need replacing.
It's not holding a charge. — Edward Chilton
The surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in
the universe is that it has never tried to contact us.
— Calvin and Hobbes (Bill Watterson)
The universe is a big place, perhaps the biggest.
