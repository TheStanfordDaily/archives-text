# Tapping into the online world
## For many, e-mail is now an integral part in everyday life 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
It's Friday night at Tresidder
Union, and the only thing that's
buzzing in the building is the
computer cluster, the LaIR,
where rows of students have fore
gone more sociable weekend ac
tivities to commune with their
keyboards.
"This is my home away from
home. 1 almost live here," said ju
nior Minnie Ingersoll, a computer
science major.
She is frequently the last per
son to leave the LaIR at night and
the first to arrive when the doors
open again at 8 a.m., she said,
even though she is not officially
enrolled to study this quarter.
Last winter quarter, it was not
unheard of for Ingersoll to curl up
on the carpeted floor beneath the
humming computers to snatch
some sleep.
Some researchers are con
cerned that students like Inger
soll are spending far too many
hours glued to a computer screen.
They fear that residential cam
puses like Stanford are becoming
increasingly inward-looking as
students' social lives are trans
formed by computer networks
and electronic communication.
"We're turning colleges into a
cubicle-directed electronic experi
ence and denying the importance
of learning to work closely with
other students and professors
and developing social adeptness,"
said former Harvard researcher
Clifford Stoll, the author of "Sili
con Snake Oil: Second Thoughts
on the Information Highway," in
a recent article in The New York
Times.
Annual statistics compiled by
Stanford's Distributed Comput
ing Communication Systems con-

Firm that the University's 30,000
faculty and students are spending
more and more time online, gen
erating an average of 158,000 e
mail messages per day on the Le
land server. In other words, each
member of the Stanford commu
nity sends and receives an aver
age of more than 50 messages
daily. Three years ago the average
campus-wide tally was just 16
messages per person per day.
Activity on Stanford World
Wide Web home pages has in
creased 18-fold since 1994. Sites
on the Stanford server receive 9
million hits per month from stu
dents and other users around the
world, according to Megan Miller,
Distributed Computing Commu
nication Systems' project man
agement assistant.
"There are definitely people in
the CS department who never go
out, who never see the light of
day," said Ingersoll, checking her
e-mail for the 10th time that day.
"It's a little more social in tbe
LaIR than sitting at home."
Of the 9,000 students who live
on campus, 8,000 have a network
connection directly to their dorm
room, said Director of Residential
Computing Jeff Merriman.
If a student does not own a
computer, there are clusters of
between four and 15 computers
available in each dorm. The stan
dard of all new residential build
ings is one computer port per pil
low, according to Merriman, but
for the moment the priority is to
get at least one connection to all
rooms by the end of next summer.
"What we have noticed is that
in-room demand keeps going up,"
said Merriman. "But students
aren't sitting inside their rooms.
People gather in the computer
clusters for collaborative work.
The nature of students is typical

ly to be social."
The preliminary findings of
liinconada Resident Fellow Rich
Holeton's survey of e-mail inter
action in his all-freshman dorm
confirm Merriman's observations
that electronic communication
can actually bring students on
campus together rather than
drive them apart.
"There is no reason for com
puters to be used any differently
from the telephone," said Hole
ton. "I've seen the dorm e-mail
list used in very exciting ways to
complement live face-to-face in
teraction."
"Someone who is less confident
in class or in the dorm will begin
by e-mail participation and gain
more confidence to get involved in
a face-to-face discussion," he said.
"Communities are opening up be
cause of electronic communica
tion."
Holeton maintains that online
communication can also be more
democratic than other channels.
"Nonverbal cues based on race,
gender or ethnicity don't impede
interactions, and this can in
crease communication across cul
tural groups," he said.
As a lecturer in the Writing
and Critical Thinking Program,
Holeton said e-mail has also in
creased the amount of thoughtful
communication between himself
and his students. "Phone calls are
an intrusion," he said. "E-mail is
far more convenient. . . . And
people think about things differ
ently if they write them down."
As well as setting e-mail writ
ing assignments, Holeton now
uses e-mail lists as a follow-up to
classes, making sure that instruc
tions reach all of his students,
rather than relying upon hurried
yelling at the end of a class while
students are shuffling papers. He

added that shy students are far
more likely to approach him with
questions by e-mail.
Professors across the disci
plines agree with Holeton. "E
-mail is the greatest thing since
sliced bread," said Assoc. Geo
physics Prof. Mike McWilliams,
who sends and receives between
50 and 100 messages per day,
keeping in touch with his gradu
ate students in far-flung corners
of the globe.
"I'm a big convert to new tech
nology," said McWilliams, whose
earth science core course is one of
90 courses at Stanford that boasts
its own Web page.
Back in Tresidder's Lalß, In
gersoll is having a hard time
imagining how the world used to
run before e-mail was invented.
Her social life nowadays revolves
around electronic interaction,
and she is in constant touch with
her family in Southern California
by e-mail, including her grand
mother, who writes from a wheel
chair.
Ingersoll even has a distribu
tion list called "family" so she can
fire off eight messages at once to

her nearest and dearest. "I say I'm
coming here to work, but I spend
an hour checking e-mail," she
said. "It's a handy procrastina
tion."
She receives around 30 e-mails
every day and no longer bothers to
check her regular mail box for let
ters, apart from once a month
when the bills come in.
Letters, it seems, are a thing of
the past at Stanford, when stu
dents can keep in touch with fam
ily and friends around the world
for free at the flick of a switch
without ever licking a stamp or
picking up a telephone or without
even leaving their chairs.
But there are some students
who are still hanging on to the old
traditions in spite of long lines at
the post office and high telephone
bills. "My roommate thinks its
wrong to send a personal letter by
e-mail," said junior Harith Ra
jagopalan. "He has to see hand
writing to know that somebody
cares."
For freshman Brooke Feigon,
who typically spends 1 1/2 hours a
day writing e-mails, the novelty of
keeping in touch with up to 20

high school friends is beginning to
wear thin as her first quarter
draws to a close.
"It's a pain when you're really
tired and you have a paper to
write," she said. "I get a lot of stu
pid forwards and chain mails,
which I don't continue."
But Feigon insists that the
hours she spends online are not
preventing her from socializing.
"It makes it easier to keep in
touch with people," she said,
pointing out how cut off she felt
from the rest of the world when
the server went down during
Stanford's power outage.
Others in the LaIR, like mas
ter's student Nicholas Wharton,
would have virtually no social life
were it not for the six or so friends
from undergraduate school he
corresponds with regularly hy e
mail.
"In my undergraduate years all
I did was goof around in the com
puter clusters," he said. "Most of
time I'm here [in the Lalß] to get
my work done.
"I'm sacrificing my social life to
make this first quarter a success,"
he added.

when the bills come in.

Students check e-mail and do work in Tresidder Union's Lalß.
It's Friday night at Tresidder
Union, and the only thing that's
buzzing in the building is the
computer cluster, the LaIR,
where rows of students have fore
gone more sociable weekend ac
tivities to commune with their
keyboards.
"This is my home away from
home. 1 almost live here," said ju
nior Minnie Ingersoll, a computer
science major.
She is frequently the last per
son to leave the LaIR at night and
the first to arrive when the doors
open again at 8 a.m., she said,
even though she is not officially
enrolled to study this quarter.
Last winter quarter, it was not
unheard of for Ingersoll to curl up
on the carpeted floor beneath the
humming computers to snatch
some sleep.
Some researchers are con
cerned that students like Inger
soll are spending far too many
hours glued to a computer screen.
They fear that residential cam
puses like Stanford are becoming
increasingly inward-looking as
students' social lives are trans
formed by computer networks
and electronic communication.
"We're turning colleges into a
cubicle-directed electronic experi
ence and denying the importance
of learning to work closely with
other students and professors
and developing social adeptness,"
said former Harvard researcher
Clifford Stoll, the author of "Sili
con Snake Oil: Second Thoughts
on the Information Highway," in
a recent article in The New York
Times.
Annual statistics compiled by
Stanford's Distributed Comput
ing Communication Systems con-

Firm that the University's 30,000
faculty and students are spending
more and more time online, gen
erating an average of 158,000 e
mail messages per day on the Le
land server. In other words, each
member of the Stanford commu
nity sends and receives an aver
age of more than 50 messages
daily. Three years ago the average
campus-wide tally was just 16
messages per person per day.
Activity on Stanford World
Wide Web home pages has in
creased 18-fold since 1994. Sites
on the Stanford server receive 9
million hits per month from stu
dents and other users around the
world, according to Megan Miller,
Distributed Computing Commu
nication Systems' project man
agement assistant.
"There are definitely people in
the CS department who never go
out, who never see the light of
day," said Ingersoll, checking her
e-mail for the 10th time that day.
"It's a little more social in tbe
LaIR than sitting at home."
Of the 9,000 students who live
on campus, 8,000 have a network
connection directly to their dorm
room, said Director of Residential
Computing Jeff Merriman.
If a student does not own a
computer, there are clusters of
between four and 15 computers
available in each dorm. The stan
dard of all new residential build
ings is one computer port per pil
low, according to Merriman, but
for the moment the priority is to
get at least one connection to all
rooms by the end of next summer.
"What we have noticed is that
in-room demand keeps going up,"
said Merriman. "But students
aren't sitting inside their rooms.
People gather in the computer
clusters for collaborative work.
The nature of students is typical

ly to be social."
The preliminary findings of
liinconada Resident Fellow Rich
Holeton's survey of e-mail inter
action in his all-freshman dorm
confirm Merriman's observations
that electronic communication
can actually bring students on
campus together rather than
drive them apart.
"There is no reason for com
puters to be used any differently
from the telephone," said Hole
ton. "I've seen the dorm e-mail
list used in very exciting ways to
complement live face-to-face in
teraction."
"Someone who is less confident
in class or in the dorm will begin
by e-mail participation and gain
more confidence to get involved in
a face-to-face discussion," he said.
"Communities are opening up be
cause of electronic communica
tion."
Holeton maintains that online
communication can also be more
democratic than other channels.
"Nonverbal cues based on race,
gender or ethnicity don't impede
interactions, and this can in
crease communication across cul
tural groups," he said.
As a lecturer in the Writing
and Critical Thinking Program,
Holeton said e-mail has also in
creased the amount of thoughtful
communication between himself
and his students. "Phone calls are
an intrusion," he said. "E-mail is
far more convenient. . . . And
people think about things differ
ently if they write them down."
As well as setting e-mail writ
ing assignments, Holeton now
uses e-mail lists as a follow-up to
classes, making sure that instruc
tions reach all of his students,
rather than relying upon hurried
yelling at the end of a class while
students are shuffling papers. He

added that shy students are far
more likely to approach him with
questions by e-mail.
Professors across the disci
plines agree with Holeton. "E
-mail is the greatest thing since
sliced bread," said Assoc. Geo
physics Prof. Mike McWilliams,
who sends and receives between
50 and 100 messages per day,
keeping in touch with his gradu
ate students in far-flung corners
of the globe.
"I'm a big convert to new tech
nology," said McWilliams, whose
earth science core course is one of
90 courses at Stanford that boasts
its own Web page.
Back in Tresidder's Lalß, In
gersoll is having a hard time
imagining how the world used to
run before e-mail was invented.
Her social life nowadays revolves
around electronic interaction,
and she is in constant touch with
her family in Southern California
by e-mail, including her grand
mother, who writes from a wheel
chair.
Ingersoll even has a distribu
tion list called "family" so she can
fire off eight messages at once to

her nearest and dearest. "I say I'm
coming here to work, but I spend
an hour checking e-mail," she
said. "It's a handy procrastina
tion."
She receives around 30 e-mails
every day and no longer bothers to
