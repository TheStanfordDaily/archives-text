# Brief power outage hits Row
## 
### Robert Chiles Adam Kemezis Contributing writers 
Five Row houses and many on-campus faculty res
idences lost power for about two hours Sunday be
cause of an equipment failure, according to officials
at Pacific Gas and Electric.
Residents in the affected houses — including Syn
ergy, Kairos, Delta Kappa Epsilon and both Grove
houses — reported that power went out at about mid
night.
All of the affected houses receive power directly
from PG&E. Eric Jansen, an account manager at
PG&E, said the outage was caused by what he called
"a blown riser splice," or the failure of the splice con
necting underground cables to overhead cables. He
added that this setback was "not a common prob
lem."
In fact, coming during a holiday weekend, it
caused comparatively few problems for residents.
"People did even less work than they were doing
before the power outage," said senior James
Wheaton, a Grove Mayfield resident. Students re
turning from out of town were greeted by blinking
alarm clocks.
Undergraduate Residence Facilities Manager
Diana Conklin said Sunday's problem was part of an
ongoing pattern of minor outages in the Row houses
supplied by PG&E.

"It's a recurring problem in those residences,"
Conklin said, adding that it seemed to have "in
creased dramatically" this quarter.
Jansen could not confirm that there had been a re
cent increase. However, he said that "wind and trees
are primary factors" in many outages on campus and
that PG&E is attempting to prevent this problem by
trimming trees.
"By law, we have to maintain certain clearances,"
Jansen said.
A PG&E customer service representative also
named squirrels, ram on dusty lines, fires and trans
formers blowing up as other frequent causes of out
ages.
According to Steve Mischissin, utilities manager
at Stanford's Facilities Operations, student and fac
ulty residences make up the bulk of PG&E con
sumers at Stanford.
Gonklin said there have historically been problems
of communication between her office and PG&E but
that as a consequence of the recent problems, she is
trying to establish more regular communication.
Tim O'Rrien, manager of Housing and Dining
Maintenance Services, agreed that in the past there
had been no main liaison between Stanford and
PG&E, which he said often resulted in his receiving
contradictory information about power problems.
He added, however, that he hoped his office could
have an ongoing relationship with Jansen, whom he
said was "very cooperative" in recent discussions.
