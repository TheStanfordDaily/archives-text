## Water polo takes second at MPSF, loses NCAA bid

Going into the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation post
season tournament, everything
was in order for the 1996 Stan
ford men's water polo team to
prove the critics wrong and gar
ner a bid to the NCAA tourna
ment.
Ranked No. 2 nationally and
owning the No. 1 seed to the
tournament, the squad that had
surprised the competition all
year with a level of maturity and
consistency uncharacteristic of a
young team was close to claim
ing one of just two NCAA berths
given to members of the MPSF.
But in the end, early-season
losses would come back to haunt
the Cardinal, as UCLA —
despite a dismal sixth-place fin
ish in the tournament — won
the bid, attributed to a 2-1 edge
in head-to-head competition
against Stanford.
So despite capturing second
place in the tournament with a
12-5 loss to No. 1 USC in the
final, the Cardinal was denied
an NCAA bid. Needless to say,
the committee's decision proved
to be quite controversial, as for
the second consecutive year a
team with a higher national
ranking was denied a bid in
favor of UCLA.
Last season, an exceptional
USC squad, which was ranked
No. 1 in the nation going into
the MPSF tournament, lost to
UCLA in the semifinal round
and ended up finishing third.
The committee then used the

argument that a strong tourna
ment performance by UCLA
earned the Bruins the bid over
USC, despite the fact that the
Trojans had dominated the com
petition throughout the regular
season.
So given last year's decision,
it would appear that tourna
ment performance proves to be
the key determinant in the com
mittee's NCAA selection pro
cess. In that light, its ruling in
UCLA's favor this year is even
more controversial.
Stanford's dominance in the
second half of the season earned
it the No. 2 national ranking
over UCLA, showing that as far
as the coaches were concerned
the Card was clearly the second
best team in the conference
entering the tournament.
The Cardinal went on to out
perform the Bruins in tourna
ment play, as it beat eighth
seeded Long Beach State and
No. 5 California while UCLA fell
to No. 6 Pacific and fourth-seed
ed UC-Irvine.
Thus the precedent appar
ently set last year — which
would have worked in Stan
ford's favor this time around —
was tossed aside again to favor
UCLA.
But despite the mystifying
decision, it remains clear to the
players, the coaches and the fans
that Stanford was truly the No.
2 team in 1996.
"We had an amazing season,"
said senior Daniel Lehoczky.
"And regardless of this unfortu
nate occurrence, I believe that we
are the No. 2 team in the nation."
For a team that was expected to
, ■" nish fifth or sixth in the MPSF,
the fact that it was in contention
for a bid was a feat in itself.
"They'll never be able to take
away our No. 2 ranking," said
head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"For a team that lost its first game
to UC-Irvine by seven goals to
come back to knock off every team
in the top 10 at least once is quite
an accomplishment. I told the guys
at the beginning of the season that
if we can show improvement week
by week, we'd have a good season.
And they did it."
On the heels of an astonishing
1996 season, the Card will look to
exact its revenge upon UCLA in
1997. The task may be difficult, as
Stanford loses its two top scorers
to graduation — Wallin and
Lehoczky. However, four of the six
starters for the Cardinal will
return, as will this year's talented
freshman class which has already
made significant contributions.
