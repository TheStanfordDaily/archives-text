# Volleyball aims for championship
## Cardinal earns top seed in tourney, hosts early rounds 
### Ben Hur Staff writer 
The Stanford women's volley
ball team (27-2) will be the team
to beat when the NCAA tourna
ment begins today.
The Card earned the No. 1
seed in the draw and the top
position in the Pacific Region.
After receiving a bye in the first
round, Stanford will host its
match Saturday at 7 p.m.
against the winner of Houston
and Colorado State. The Cardi
nal played Conference USA foe
Houston at the beginning of the
season, and Stanford knows that
the Cougars, if they advance,
will come to the Farm ready to
play.
"Houston is a very tough
team," Stanford coach Don Shaw
said. "They play very well
together, and they are not intim
idated by anybody."
The Cardinal earned the first
seed in the tournament despite
finishing second in the USA

behind Florida. The Gators
earned the second seed overall
and are the top dog in the Cen
tral Region.
"I am not at all surprised by
our seed," Shaw said. "The polls
don't mean that much."
The Cardinal has not held the
top spot in the polls this season,
but after beating Hawaii and
surviving a grueling conference
schedule with only one blemish,
many feel that Stanford has the
best chance of celebrating a
championship in a few weeks.
Stanford brings a stacked
lineup with numerous offensive
weapons to the table. All-Ameri
can junior setter Lisa Sharpley
will give a majority of the hitting
attempts to Ail-American junior
outside hitter Kristin Folkl and

talented freshman outside hitter
Kerri Walsh. The two hitters
have more than 800 kills
between them and are capable of
instilling fear in opponents with
their power.
Sharpley can also mix up the
offense with quick sets to senior
middle blocker Eileen Murfee or
junior middle blocker Barbara
Ifejika, both of whom have pro
vided consistently superb hitting
up the middle.
On defense, the Cardinal pro
vides a daunting front line for
any opponent. Ifejika, Murfee,
Walsh and Folkl have all stepped
up their blocking this season,
frustrating even the most talent
ed hitters. In case the ball does
somehow slip through to the
backcourt, freshman outside hit
ter Jaimi Gregory can probably
reach it from wherever she is on
the court.
Stanford can also go to its
bench, where part-time starter
Debbie Lambert can provide a
spark for the Cardinal offense.
The junior outside hitter rose to
the occasion against Hawaii, sav
ing her best performance of the
year for the top-ranked Rain
bows.
Shaw has recently given sig
nificant playing time to sopho
more defensive specialist Sarah
Neal and senior co-captain
Catherine Julliard, who are used
for their serving and passing
abilities.
If Stanford wins its first
match, the Card will advance to
the regional semifinals where it
could face Pacific 10 Conference
rival USC. The Women of Troy
gave Stanford some trouble
when they visited Maples Pavil
ion earlier in the year. Although
USC eventually lost the match,

the Cardinal knows that it can't
look past the Women of Troy.
Should Stanford advance to
the regional final, it will most
likely face second-seeded Wash
ington State, one of the two
teams to defeat the Card this
season. The No. 3 seed Loyola
Marymount could also be a
regional final opponent for Stan
ford.
"Washington State is the kind
of team that thinks that they can
beat anyone at anytime," Shaw
said.
If Stanford can survive its
region and move on to the Final
Four in Cleveland, the Cardinal
may face defending champion
Nebraska, who appears to have
the clearest path to the Final
Four. Stanford might then face
Florida or perhaps have a
rematch with Hawaii in the
final.
The Cardinal has proved its
ability at every position on the
floor throughout the season

Four Cardinal players — Murfee,
Folkl, Sharpley and Walsh — all
earned first-team all-conference
honors, while Ifejika received
honorable mention. Walsh also
earned a place on the freshman

All-Pac-10 team, with freshman
outside hitter Jaimi Gregory
receiving honorable mention.
Walsh was also named Pac-10
Freshman of the Year.
Stanford's dominance in the
Pac-10, probably the strongest
conference in the nation, may
foreshadow even greater glory
down the road as the Cardinal
will strive to win its third cham
pionship in the last five years.
"If we play well, I don't think
there is anyone who can beat
us," Sharpley said.
