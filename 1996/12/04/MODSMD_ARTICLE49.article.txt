# Women avoid upset in Honolulu
## 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
Much like the waves crashing
on the Hawaii beaches, the top
ranked Stanford women's bas
ketball team nearly crashed a
perfect record on its way to first
place in the Hawaiian Airlines
Rainbow Wahine Classic.
The Cardinal rolled over
Houston 83-51 and 24th-ranked
Stephen F. Austin 85-62 before
holding off a mediocre Michigan
squad in the final by a slim 77-
74 margin.
Junior forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele had 19 points (12 in
the second half) while junior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard capped
off a brilliant tournament with
22 points and 11 rebounds
including a sizzling six for 10
from beyond the three-point arc.
Senior guard Kate Starbird
secured tournament MVP hon
ors with 15 points to finish the
tourney with 68 points, tops in
the Wahine Classic. Nygaard
and senior point guard Jamila
Wideman (with a tournament
leading 22 assists in three
games) also earned spots on the
all-tournament team.
Away from the loud confines
of Maples Pavilion for the first
time, there was no indication
that the change of scenery was
going to slow Tara VanDerveer's
squad down. Instead, the Card
jumped out to a 35-7 lead over
Houston, now 1-3 after finishing
eighth in the tourney, Friday.
The usual suspects aided the
barrage, as Nygaard, junior cen
ter Olympia Scott and Starbird
had 38 of Stanford's 45 first-half
points. Houston was over
whelmed offensively and on the
glass, shooting only 35 percent
while allowing Stanford 11

offensive rebounds and 21 total.
Having built a 25-point bulge,
most of the second half was
played in a pedestrian manner.
Mulitauaopele scored seven of
her 11 points in the first 3 min
utes of the second frame to erase
any lingering hopes for the Lady
Cougars.
The lead bulged to 78-39 with
just under 5 minutes to go
before cruising to the 32-point
victory. Starbird finished with
26 points in only 27 minutes of
play while Nygaard had the first
of three double-doubles, scoring
12 points and grabbing 10
rebounds.
"I think we definitely came
out pretty strong [Friday], and
we were able to do something we
hadn't been able to do against
Purdue and Northern Arizona,"
Starbird said. "We put the ham
mer down and ended the game in
the first half."
Up next was perhaps the only
challenging opponent of the
tournament. Stephen F. Austin
(4-1 after defeating Hawaii in
the third-place game) had just
blown out Miami (Ohio) 61-45 in
the quarterfinals and looked to
stay with the Cardinal in Satur
day's contest. The Ladyjacks'
pesky press defense made it inter
esting for a while, but the Cardi
nal countered with an aggressive
player-to-player defense that
opened the transition game up
for Stanford.
Nygaard was once again a
force, going for 20 points and 12
rebounds while Scott added 14
points and nine boards. Starbird
shined again, scoring 27 points
to lead the Cardinal, which shot
53 percent in the opening half
allowing the team to jump out to

Junior forward Vanessa Nygaard goes up strong
against Northern Arizona. Nygaard recorded three
double-doubles this week in as many games.
