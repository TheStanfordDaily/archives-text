# Women avoid upset in Honolulu
## 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
Much like the waves crashing
on the Hawaii beaches, the top
ranked Stanford women's bas
ketball team nearly crashed a
perfect record on its way to first
place in the Hawaiian Airlines
Rainbow Wahine Classic.
The Cardinal rolled over
Houston 83-51 and 24th-ranked
Stephen F. Austin 85-62 before
holding off a mediocre Michigan
squad in the final by a slim 77-
74 margin.
Junior forward Naomi Muli
tauaopele had 19 points (12 in
the second half) while junior for
ward Vanessa Nygaard capped
off a brilliant tournament with
22 points and 11 rebounds
including a sizzling six for 10
from beyond the three-point arc.
Senior guard Kate Starbird
secured tournament MVP hon
ors with 15 points to finish the
tourney with 68 points, tops in
the Wahine Classic. Nygaard
and senior point guard Jamila
Wideman (with a tournament
leading 22 assists in three
games) also earned spots on the
all-tournament team.
Away from the loud confines
of Maples Pavilion for the first
time, there was no indication
that the change of scenery was
going to slow Tara VanDerveer's
squad down. Instead, the Card
jumped out to a 35-7 lead over
Houston, now 1-3 after finishing
eighth in the tourney, Friday.
The usual suspects aided the
barrage, as Nygaard, junior cen
ter Olympia Scott and Starbird
had 38 of Stanford's 45 first-half
points. Houston was over
whelmed offensively and on the
glass, shooting only 35 percent
while allowing Stanford 11

offensive rebounds and 21 total.
Having built a 25-point bulge,
most of the second half was
played in a pedestrian manner.
Mulitauaopele scored seven of
her 11 points in the first 3 min
utes of the second frame to erase
any lingering hopes for the Lady
Cougars.
The lead bulged to 78-39 with
just under 5 minutes to go
before cruising to the 32-point
victory. Starbird finished with
26 points in only 27 minutes of
play while Nygaard had the first
of three double-doubles, scoring
12 points and grabbing 10
rebounds.
"I think we definitely came
out pretty strong [Friday], and
we were able to do something we
hadn't been able to do against
Purdue and Northern Arizona,"
Starbird said. "We put the ham
mer down and ended the game in
the first half."
Up next was perhaps the only
challenging opponent of the
tournament. Stephen F. Austin
(4-1 after defeating Hawaii in
the third-place game) had just
blown out Miami (Ohio) 61-45 in
the quarterfinals and looked to
stay with the Cardinal in Satur
day's contest. The Ladyjacks'
pesky press defense made it inter
esting for a while, but the Cardi
nal countered with an aggressive
player-to-player defense that
opened the transition game up
for Stanford.
Nygaard was once again a
force, going for 20 points and 12
rebounds while Scott added 14
points and nine boards. Starbird
shined again, scoring 27 points
to lead the Cardinal, which shot
53 percent in the opening half
allowing the team to jump out to

a 46-28 halftime lead.
A 17-4 second-half run put the
game out of reach as Stanford's
lead bulged to 85-54 with a little
more than 2 minutes to go in the
contest. Stanford shot a blister
ing 10 of 18 from three-point land
for the game, including four of six
by Starbird and three more from
Nygaard.
Sunday's final looked like a
cakewalk. Even though the
Wolverines were riding high after
beating hometown favorite
Hawaii 71-63, Michigan (5-1) still
seemed like no more than a victo
ry lap in Stanford's quest for a
second Hawaii tournament
championship.
Early on, that appeared to be
the case as Stanford rolled to an
early 24-11 lead. However, Michi
gan chipped away at the lead,
eventually pulling to within five
points. Stanford stretched the
lead out to 39-25 before Michigan
countered with another small
run.
However, a critical four-point
switch closed the half as senior
point guard Jamila Wideman ran
down the clock and laid it in at
the buzzer for a 43-32 halftime
advantage.
The second half saw Michigan
do several things that five previ
ous Stanford opponents could
not. After shooting 40 percent in
the first half, the Wolverines
actually got better, knocking
down more than half of their
shots.
The defense shut down the
passing lanes and played aggres
sively all half, holding Wideman
to only two second-half assists

and allowing Starbird only 12
shots in the game.
Nevertheless, the efforts
seemed to be going for naught as
Stanford had leads of 55-38 and
71-58 in the second half. But
Michigan countered with eight
unanswered points.
Amazingly, it was a four-point
game with 29 seconds left and
Starbird at the line for a one-and
one. She missed the front end,
and Wolverine junior forward
Molly Murray nailed a three at
the other end to make it 75-74
with 17 seconds left.
Starbird was intentionally
fouled again, and this time, the
junior forward did not fail, nail
ing both shots from the charity
stripe. One last desperate
attempt by Michigan freshman
guard Stacey Thomas was well
defended by Nygaard and Stan
ford survived.
Michigan set several marks
for the season against Stanford,
including highest field goal per
centage by an opponent along
with smallest margin of victory
and highest scoring output, sur
passing the 65 points Alabama
scored in the season opener.
"The Michigan second half
was the most disappointing half
we've played," said Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer. "We
really let up as a team."
Even though Stanford barely
won the tournament, it enters
the week at the top of the polls
and with its best start in five
years.
"I'm happy that we won the
tournament," VanDerveer said.
"I think it's a good lesson for the
team that they have to play 40
minutes. It's a situation now
where everybody gets sky-high
for us, and we have to be very
focused."
