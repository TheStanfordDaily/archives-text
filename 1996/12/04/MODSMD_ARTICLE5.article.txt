The following excerpt is
written in the information
pamphlets that the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions
provides to prospective
transfer students:
Question: "Does Stan
ford accept transfer appli
cants for mid-year admis
sion?"
Answer: "No. Applica-

tions are accepted for the autumn quarter
only"
Despite this strict transfer policy, students
still enroll during the winter and spring quar
ters. While rare at best, mid-year transfers do
have an impact at the University, most no
tablv on the athletic field.

Is it a case of bending the rules or simply
having a few isolated cases every few quar
ters?
A different situation in past years
This policy of only accepting fall quarter
transfer applicants was not always the case.
Up until 1986, Stanford freely admitted
transfer students for winter and spring quar
ters However, a committee looking at under
graduate admissions and financial aid voted
to discontinue the policy.
Regardless, there was the understanding
that the need for flexibility was necessary in
compelling cases where a particular student
needed to enroll in either winter or spring
quarter.
Mid-year transfers "are not something we
encourage." said James Montova. dean of un-
