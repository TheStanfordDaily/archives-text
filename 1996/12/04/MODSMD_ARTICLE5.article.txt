# Mid-year transfers a rarity at Stanford
## 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
The following excerpt is
written in the information
pamphlets that the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions
provides to prospective
transfer students:
Question: "Does Stan
ford accept transfer appli
cants for mid-year admis
sion?"
Answer: "No. Applica-

tions are accepted for the autumn quarter
only"
Despite this strict transfer policy, students
still enroll during the winter and spring quar
ters. While rare at best, mid-year transfers do
have an impact at the University, most no
tablv on the athletic field.

Is it a case of bending the rules or simply
having a few isolated cases every few quar
ters?
A different situation in past years
This policy of only accepting fall quarter
transfer applicants was not always the case.
Up until 1986, Stanford freely admitted
transfer students for winter and spring quar
ters However, a committee looking at under
graduate admissions and financial aid voted
to discontinue the policy.
Regardless, there was the understanding
that the need for flexibility was necessary in
compelling cases where a particular student
needed to enroll in either winter or spring
quarter.
Mid-year transfers "are not something we
encourage." said James Montova. dean of un-


Montoya
dergraduate admissions and finan
cial aids. "This is due to the strong
commitment to having as many kids
participate in Orientation as possi
ble."
Montoya, however, was quick to
point out that there are only "one or
two cases a year" and that there are
some years when no mid-year stu
dents even apply. Nevertheless, ex
ceptions are made in order to admit
these mid-year transfers.
"For any transfer student, we try
to be flexible," Montoya said. "After
all, people's lives are different."
The place of an athlete
The case of athletes is one that
inevitably comes up. Athletes fall
under the "special transfer" cases
that the Admissions Office agreed
on in 1986, when the University
eliminated the mid-year transfer
process. The main reason why ath
letes transfer is because their play
ing eligibility is dependent on mid
year enrollment.
While it would appear at first
glance that football players simply
enroll here with minimal trouble,
there is much more these athletes
deal with than just choosing a jersey
and getting comfortable with the
head coach. One aspect they face is
the high admissions standards at a
place like Stanford.
Montoya said he and his staff re
view cases carefully and look for
other intangibles the student can
offer, aside from the contributions
they could make to a winning foot
ball program.
"Our decision is based on specific
needs that a team might have,"
Montoya said. "But we also have to
look at that student's ability to get
here and hit the road running."
Potential mid-year transfers
need to be mature enough to adjust
to the rigor of a place like Stanford,
since they lose the benefit of Orien
tation and thus have less time to get
used to campus life.
Recruiting Coordinator Dave
Tipton, who also works as the foot
ball team's defensive interior line
coach, said he is careful to look at a
player's transcript and number of
units taken before having him fill
out a Stanford application. He
added that he realizes the Admis
sions Office discourages mid-year
transfers, so he said he wants to
make the rare cases worth the of
fice's while.
"They're not overly excited
about it," Tipton said. "They would
rather us not Ido it], but if they qual
ify, then it's worth a shot. We try to
analyze it with them, especially with
junior college guys. Sometimes,
we'll have the Admissions Office
look at someone before we go after
them."
The tale of two transfers
According to the information

pamphlet, Stanford requires at least
26 semester-units or 39 quarter
units of transferable credit to be
considered as a potential transfer
student. In some cases, this require
ment allows Tipton and his staff to
coordinate a player's transfer over a
long period of time.
According to Tipton, such was
the case with senior tight end Greg
Clark. A junior college All-American
at Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho,
Clark had been recruited by Stan
ford since spring 1994.
Knowing the class load he had to
take in order to be admitted, Clark
acquired the units necessary during
the spring and summer term at and
into the ensuing fall at Ricks, allow
ing Stanford to admit him in winter
quarter 1995 without much trou
ble.
Another case is sophomore line
backer Donnie Spragan. After grad
uating from Logan High School in
Union City, Calif., in 1994, Spragan
actually deferred a semester at the
University of the Pacific. After en
rolling in January 1995 and playing
football the following fall, UOP
dropped football on Dec. 17 due to fi
nancial difficulties in its athletics
department. With no prior warning,
he had to attempt to transfer quick
ly without having his playing eligi
bility hurt. Stanford was among his
considerations.
"We had to get him the applica
tion quickly," Tipton said. "But he
did a great job of returning it to us
quickly."
Once the process was complete,
Spragan was registered last winter
quarter and salvaged three seasons'
worth of eligibility.
It is important to note, however,
that a case like Spragan's is ex
tremely unique. Not every football
transfer enters the University on
such short notice, as exemplified by
people like Clark.
While to some, it looks like an
alarming trend, to the Admissions
Office it is just one compelling case
in a small handful of mid-year trans
fer applicants.
The policy goes on
According to both Montoya and
Tipton, the number of mid-year
transfer students that don the car
dinal and white for the football team
is minimal at best.
"We'd like to get more," Tipton
said. "Generally, though, they are
hard to get."
The admissions process, howev
er, pretty much douses such notions
with its rigorous requirements and
standards, including its policy of not
admitting applicants "solely be
cause of athletic ability."
Despite the steadfast transfer
policy, Montoya said he under
stands that it can never hold true
continuously.
"I like to say that this school is
built on a human scale and functions
on a human scale," Montoya said.
"That is why we'd take interest in
the unique and compelling situation
of an applicant into consideration."

While to some, it looks like an
alarming trend, to the Admissions
Office it is just one compelling case
in a small handful of mid-year trans
fer applicants.
The policy goes on
According to both Montoya and
Tipton, the number of mid-year
transfer students that don the car
dinal and white for the football team
is minimal at best.
"We'd like to get more," Tipton
said. "Generally, though, they are
hard to get."
The admissions process, howev
er, pretty much douses such notions
with its rigorous requirements and
standards, including its policy of not
admitting applicants "solely be
cause of athletic ability."
Despite the steadfast transfer
policy, Montoya said he under
stands that it can never hold true
continuously.
"I like to say that this school is
built on a human scale and functions
on a human scale," Montoya said.
"That is why we'd take interest in
the unique and compelling situation
of an applicant into consideration."
The following excerpt is
written in the information
pamphlets that the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions
provides to prospective
transfer students:
Question: "Does Stan
ford accept transfer appli
cants for mid-year admis
sion?"
Answer: "No. Applica-

tions are accepted for the autumn quarter
only"
Despite this strict transfer policy, students
still enroll during the winter and spring quar
ters. While rare at best, mid-year transfers do
have an impact at the University, most no
tablv on the athletic field.

Is it a case of bending the rules or simply
having a few isolated cases every few quar
ters?
A different situation in past years
This policy of only accepting fall quarter
transfer applicants was not always the case.
Up until 1986, Stanford freely admitted
transfer students for winter and spring quar
ters However, a committee looking at under
graduate admissions and financial aid voted
to discontinue the policy.
Regardless, there was the understanding
that the need for flexibility was necessary in
compelling cases where a particular student
needed to enroll in either winter or spring
quarter.
Mid-year transfers "are not something we
encourage." said James Montova. dean of un-


Montoya
dergraduate admissions and finan
cial aids. "This is due to the strong
commitment to having as many kids
participate in Orientation as possi
ble."
Montoya, however, was quick to
point out that there are only "one or
two cases a year" and that there are
some years when no mid-year stu
dents even apply. Nevertheless, ex
ceptions are made in order to admit
these mid-year transfers.
"For any transfer student, we try
to be flexible," Montoya said. "After
all, people's lives are different."
The place of an athlete
The case of athletes is one that
inevitably comes up. Athletes fall
under the "special transfer" cases
that the Admissions Office agreed
on in 1986, when the University
eliminated the mid-year transfer
process. The main reason why ath
letes transfer is because their play
ing eligibility is dependent on mid
year enrollment.
While it would appear at first
glance that football players simply
enroll here with minimal trouble,
there is much more these athletes
deal with than just choosing a jersey
and getting comfortable with the
head coach. One aspect they face is
the high admissions standards at a
place like Stanford.
Montoya said he and his staff re
view cases carefully and look for
other intangibles the student can
offer, aside from the contributions
they could make to a winning foot
ball program.
"Our decision is based on specific
needs that a team might have,"
Montoya said. "But we also have to
look at that student's ability to get
here and hit the road running."
Potential mid-year transfers
need to be mature enough to adjust
to the rigor of a place like Stanford,
since they lose the benefit of Orien
tation and thus have less time to get
used to campus life.
Recruiting Coordinator Dave
Tipton, who also works as the foot
ball team's defensive interior line
coach, said he is careful to look at a
player's transcript and number of
units taken before having him fill
out a Stanford application. He
added that he realizes the Admis
sions Office discourages mid-year
transfers, so he said he wants to
make the rare cases worth the of
fice's while.
"They're not overly excited
about it," Tipton said. "They would
rather us not Ido it], but if they qual
ify, then it's worth a shot. We try to
analyze it with them, especially with
junior college guys. Sometimes,
we'll have the Admissions Office
look at someone before we go after
them."
The tale of two transfers
According to the information

pamphlet, Stanford requires at least
26 semester-units or 39 quarter
units of transferable credit to be
considered as a potential transfer
student. In some cases, this require
ment allows Tipton and his staff to
coordinate a player's transfer over a
long period of time.
According to Tipton, such was
the case with senior tight end Greg
Clark. A junior college All-American
at Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho,
Clark had been recruited by Stan
ford since spring 1994.
Knowing the class load he had to
take in order to be admitted, Clark
acquired the units necessary during
the spring and summer term at and
into the ensuing fall at Ricks, allow
ing Stanford to admit him in winter
quarter 1995 without much trou
ble.
Another case is sophomore line
backer Donnie Spragan. After grad
uating from Logan High School in
Union City, Calif., in 1994, Spragan
actually deferred a semester at the
University of the Pacific. After en
rolling in January 1995 and playing
football the following fall, UOP
dropped football on Dec. 17 due to fi
nancial difficulties in its athletics
department. With no prior warning,
he had to attempt to transfer quick
ly without having his playing eligi
bility hurt. Stanford was among his
considerations.
"We had to get him the applica
tion quickly," Tipton said. "But he
did a great job of returning it to us
quickly."
Once the process was complete,
Spragan was registered last winter
quarter and salvaged three seasons'
worth of eligibility.
It is important to note, however,
that a case like Spragan's is ex
tremely unique. Not every football
transfer enters the University on
such short notice, as exemplified by
people like Clark.
While to some, it looks like an
alarming trend, to the Admissions
Office it is just one compelling case
in a small handful of mid-year trans
fer applicants.
