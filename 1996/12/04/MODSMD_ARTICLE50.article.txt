# Football prepares for Sun Bowl
## 
### Jeremy Stone Editorial staff 
With t he Norwest Sun Bowl less than
four weeks away, the Cardinal will likely
have to wait another week to learn who
it will face in the New Year's Eve show
down in El Paso, Texas.
As the Pacific 10 Conference's lone
third-place finisher, Stanford was an
automatic selection for the contest with
Washington's selection to the Cotton or
Holiday Bowls. But the Big 10 Confer
ence scenario is much more complex.
The Cardinal iss slated to play the
fifth selection from the Big 10, which has
•even howl-eligible squads but just five
guaranteed bowl spots. With No. 5 Oh o
State (Rose Bowl), No. 10 Northwestern
(Citrus) and No. 8 Penn State (a likely

squad for an alliance bid with Notre
Dame's loss to USC and the Wildcats'
invite to the Citrus Bowl) headed for
more prestigious games, four squads are
possible opponents — lowa (8-3, 6-2 Big
10), Michigan (8-3, 5-3), Michigan State
(6-5, 5-3) and Wisconsin (7-5, 3-5).
Until the Wolverines spoiled the
Buckeyes' unbeaten season Nov. 23,
they had appeared to be the likely choice
to fall to the No. 5 slot. But now Michi
gan seems likely to overtake lowa and
possibly earn the Big 10 No. 3's spot in
the Outback Bowl. The Hawkeyes would
then fall to the Alamo Bowl, where they
could take on Texas or the Big 12 No. 4.
The Nittany Lions' alliance situation
complicates the bowl scenario. If Penn
State goes to the alliance, then six bowl
berths are guaranteed to the Big 10,

allowing Michigan and lowa to move up
to the Outback and Alamo Bowl spots,
leaving Michigan State to vie with Wis
consin for the Sun Bowl. The Spartans
then have three things in their favor.
For starters, Michigan State finished
two full games ahead of Wisconsin in the
Big 10. The Badgers did not become
bowl-eligible until Saturday.
Wisconsin also played Stanford earli
er this year, and bowls do not like
rematches of regular-season games,
especially yawners like the 14-0 defen
sive slugfest in Madison Sept. 21.

The Sun Bowl will be televised on
CBS at noon MST (11 a.m. PST). Tick
