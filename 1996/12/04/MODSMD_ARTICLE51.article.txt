# Men's hoops misses out on dream final, loses to the College of Charleston
## 
### Bobby Cuza Staff writer 
Coach Mike Montgomery warned us
this might happen, but we didn't listen.
He warned that the College of
Charleston was a good team He warned
that a win against the unranked
Cougars — not even a Division I team as
of six years ago — would be pooh
poohed. He knew that the road to the
championship game of the Great Alaska
Shootout would be anything but easy.
But fans and media alike wouldn't
have it. UNC who? Charleston what?
Two quick, easy wins against a couple of
anonymous teams, and the Cardinal was
headed for a marquee matchup against
defending national champion Kentucky
in Saturday night's ESPN-televised
final. What could possibly go wrong?

The College of Charleston, that's
what went wrong. After disposing of
North Carolina-Greensboro 88-52 in
first-round action Wednesday, then-No.
21 Stanford was tripped up in Friday's
semifinal, falling 82-78 to a quicker,
more experienced Charleston squad As
a result, the Cardinal (2-1) settled for a
91-69 win over Division II Alaska-
Anchorage on Saturday in a game that
saw some changes in the Stanford line
up.
"We would have liked to have played
[Kentucky]," Montgomery said. "That's
certainly the premier team in the coun
try. But you have to earn that right, and
we didn't do it.
Charleston was "experienced down
the stretch, and that was definitely a fac-

tor. At the end of the game, they
made every play they had to
make. They tipped in all their
misses, made every free throw."
Indeed, the Cougars (3-1),
who returned all five starters
from a team that went 25-4 and
advanced to the second round of
the NIT, played near-flawless
basketball in erasing a seven
point, second-half Stanford lead.
After sophomore center Tim
Young — who had dominated
Charleston inside, scoring 22
points and grabbing nine
rebounds — fouled out with 6
minutes, 19 seconds remaining,
the road was paved for a Cougar
upset. Charleston made all
eight of its free throws down
the stretch and never lost its
poise.
Stanford, meanwhile, failed
to fully capitalize on its height
advantage. Forward Pete Van
Elswyk missed four inside shots
in the first half and finished a
disappointing three-of-seven
from the field.
The Cardinal also shot just
41.7 percent from the floor and
committed 11 more fouls than
the Cougars.
"We're really young. Brevin
[Knight] can't do it himself. Tim
can't do it himself," Mont
gomery said. "We made a per
centage of plays but not all of
them."
Thanks to his team's disap
pointing performance Friday,
Montgomery went with a new
starting lineup in Saturday's
win over Alaska (5-2), inserting
sophomore Peter Sauer in place
of Van Elswyk. Sauer responded
with 13 points and seven
rebounds.
"It wasn't as much about Pete
Van Elswyk as making guys
understand it still is about per
formance," Montgomery said.
"There are no free rides."
Montgomery also made signif
icant changes in his substitution
pattern, bringing freshman
guard David Moseley off the
bench first and using junior
Kamba Tshionyi as his backup
point guard in place of sopho
more Arthur Lee, who played
clumsily in 5 minutes of play
against Charleston.
"I think [Montgomery] just

wanted to show everyone's spot
wasn't locked down," Sauer said.
"You come into the season
thinking you're kind of unbeat
able. You can't just win with
your talent. You have to play
hard every night."
The lineup-shuffling seemed
to work against Alaska,
although truth be told, most
anything would have probably
worked against the Seawolves.
Nonetheless, Montgomery got
29 points and 18 rebounds from
his reserves, which was a wel
come contrast to Friday's con
test in which the Stanford bench
was outscored 27-8.
Once again, Young was a force
inside, scoring 17 points to tie
for the team lead with freshman

swingman Ryan Mendez who
drained four of eight three-point
attempts.
Knight added 16 points and
13 assists for the Cardinal, doing
most of his scoring in the second
half.
Overall, the Cardinal shot
55.2 percent and made 10 of 20
treys to threaten the school
record of 12 set in Wednesday's
opening-game win over UNC-
Greensboro.
Despite the loss to
Charleston, Stanford retained
its ranking in this week's Associ
ated Press poll, slipping just
three notches to No. 24.
Charleston also received several
votes, though it failed to crack
the top 25.
