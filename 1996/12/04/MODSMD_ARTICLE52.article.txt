## Wallin guides the Card 
### Jennifer West 
Brian Wallin makes a good impression with his
clothes on.
One would expect a boastful swagger from one of
the nation's best water polo players and captain of
the Stanford water polo team.
After all, he hails from a water polo "dynasty" at
Stanford and has dominated the sport for more
than eight years. However, Wallin takes his impres
sive record and his talent with an unassuming
stride.
"I grew up in a pool — swimming," Wallin said.
The Stanford team "is very close," he said. "This
has been a good year. We played well as a team, and
there is nothing to hang our head about."
Wallin, a senior, is graduating from Stanford
water polo with a host of point records, tournament
honors and awards. As Stanford's point leader net
ting 69 goals for the 1996 season, Wallin has been
recognized repeatedly by the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation as athlete of the week and as the
influence which led an improved 1996 Cardinal
team.

"Brian was the most influential player to the suc

both in and out of the pool, was tremendous," said
head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"The first half of the season Brian carried us, and
as more players began to contribute, we progressed
and improved; we came together," Dettamanti said.
Wallin's accolades have had a ripple effect
throughout his Cardinal career. He was chosen
Stanford's top freshman in 1993. His second year he
earned a place on the second-team All-America, sec
ond-team all-MPSF and second-team all-NCAA
tournament squads.
In 1995, Wallin was chosen a first-team All-
American and second-team all-MPSF selection. As
Stanford's leading scorer last year with 73 points,
he scored at least one point in virtually every game.
He competed at the 1995 World University Games
and the Olympic Festival in Denver.
"I can't count the number of games that he has
influenced the outcome of the game," Dettamanti
said. "When the game is close and on the line, it's
