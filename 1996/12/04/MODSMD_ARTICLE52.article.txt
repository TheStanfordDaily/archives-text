## Wallin guides the Card 
### Jennifer West 
Brian Wallin makes a good impression with his
clothes on.
One would expect a boastful swagger from one of
the nation's best water polo players and captain of
the Stanford water polo team.
After all, he hails from a water polo "dynasty" at
Stanford and has dominated the sport for more
than eight years. However, Wallin takes his impres
sive record and his talent with an unassuming
stride.
"I grew up in a pool — swimming," Wallin said.
The Stanford team "is very close," he said. "This
has been a good year. We played well as a team, and
there is nothing to hang our head about."
Wallin, a senior, is graduating from Stanford
water polo with a host of point records, tournament
honors and awards. As Stanford's point leader net
ting 69 goals for the 1996 season, Wallin has been
recognized repeatedly by the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation as athlete of the week and as the
influence which led an improved 1996 Cardinal
team.

"Brian was the most influential player to the suc
cess of our team. His contribution and leadership,
both in and out of the pool, was tremendous," said
head coach Dante Dettamanti.
"The first half of the season Brian carried us, and
as more players began to contribute, we progressed
and improved; we came together," Dettamanti said.
Wallin's accolades have had a ripple effect
throughout his Cardinal career. He was chosen
Stanford's top freshman in 1993. His second year he
earned a place on the second-team All-America, sec
ond-team all-MPSF and second-team all-NCAA
tournament squads.
In 1995, Wallin was chosen a first-team All-
American and second-team all-MPSF selection. As
Stanford's leading scorer last year with 73 points,
he scored at least one point in virtually every game.
He competed at the 1995 World University Games
and the Olympic Festival in Denver.
"I can't count the number of games that he has
influenced the outcome of the game," Dettamanti
said. "When the game is close and on the line, it's

Brian that sparks us and gets us
back into the game — virtually sin
gle-handedly."
Dettamanti said Wallin is
extremely versatile and good at
working with the young players,
sharing his knowledge of the sport.
"He plays wherever we need
him, and he gets us started," Det
tamanti said.
With more than a decade of
water polo "under his drawstring,"
Wallin is a natural leader.
"Brian is a very natural play
er," said senior Daniel Lehoczky.
"He brought experience to the
young team, which was key to the
success of the team. He knows
exactly what's going on — he sees
everything in the game and has
the gift.
"There are not a lot of players
like him," Lehoczky said. "He is
very consistent and reliable, both
offensively and defensively."
Wallin is noted for his compo
sure and control both in and out of
the pool. "He can control the game.
He doesn't panic and stays cool. We

want the ball in his hands," Detta
manti said.
Stanford water polo has reached
the end of an era. For the past eight
years there has been a Wallin com
peting for Cardinal water polo. The
Wallin trio is widely known for
water polo excellence throughout
the San Joaquin Valley and at
Stanford.
"Wally World" had its inception
in 1988 when Mark Wallin came to
Stanford, continued with Chris in
1990 and concludes with Brian in
1996. The Wallin clan are regulars
at Stanford games and regularly
provide advice and insight about
the game's events.
"We grew up competing," Chris
Wallin said. "We made everything
into a race. Brian was always
smaller and skinnier but always
competitive."
"All three of the Wallins are
excellent water polo players," Det
tamanti said. "Each year they get
bigger, but each one has different
skills. Brian is probably the best of
the three.
"I hope the team has learned
from playing with him and will
carry on in the tradition," he
said.
