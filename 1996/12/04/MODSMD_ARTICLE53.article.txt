# Folkl maintains humility

You might never see a better
collegiate volleyball player, and
you probably will not meet a
nicer person.
Junior Kristin Folkl, the Car
dinal volleyball team's star out
side hitter, is quite used to suc
cess. As a high school player,
Folkl set the standard for win
ning. She won eight state titles in
volleyball and basketball, along
with leading her volleyball team
to a 94-match win streak. She
earned high school All-America
honors by shattering the national
record for kills, set by Stanford
grad Marnie Triefenbach, and
was also named the nation's top
high school student athlete along
with golfer Tiger Woods.
As if that isn't enough, Folkl
came to the Farm in 1994 as Vol
leyball Magazine's recruit of the
decade and promptly demon
strated why. The 6-foot-2 offen
sive force led Stanford to its sec
ond national championship
while becoming a first-team Ail-
American and the national
freshman of the year.
And all this success has gone
to her head, right?
Her teammates beg to differ.
Stanford outside hitter Debbie
Lambert reveals that Folkl's
numerous accolades have done
little to change her down-to
earth demeanor.
"I was totally scared of her
the first time I peppered with
her," Lambert said. "But then I
realized that she is like everyone
else. She does not by any means
put herself on a pedestal."
For Pacific 10 Conference
Freshman of the Year Kerri
Walsh, Folkl's presence and
leadership have helped mold her
into the confident big-game
player that she has proven she
can be.
Walsh joined the Card after
winning the national high school
player of the year award and
being named the most highly
touted recruit of her class.
Lucky for Walsh, someone else

on the squad knows a little bit
about what that is like.
"It has been just great having
her there," Walsh said. "I look
up to her as a volleyball player
and as a person."
Even when Walsh started to
gain more notoriety for her play
and at times overshadowed her
older teammate, Folkl has had
no qualms about giving up the
spotlight.
"She is a pretty unselfish
player," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw. "She has done

a lot to help Kerri, and Kristin is
not the least bit jealous of the
attention that Kerri is getting."
When talking with her team
mates, one quickly realizes that
Folkl has earned the respect and
admiration of her fellow players
because of the type of person she
is and not just because of her
extensive athletic skills.
