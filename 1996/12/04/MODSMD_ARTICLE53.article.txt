# Folkl maintains humility

You might never see a better
collegiate volleyball player, and
you probably will not meet a
nicer person.
Junior Kristin Folkl, the Car
dinal volleyball team's star out
side hitter, is quite used to suc
cess. As a high school player,
Folkl set the standard for win
ning. She won eight state titles in
volleyball and basketball, along
with leading her volleyball team
to a 94-match win streak. She
earned high school All-America
honors by shattering the national
record for kills, set by Stanford
grad Marnie Triefenbach, and
was also named the nation's top
high school student athlete along
with golfer Tiger Woods.
As if that isn't enough, Folkl
came to the Farm in 1994 as Vol
leyball Magazine's recruit of the
decade and promptly demon
strated why. The 6-foot-2 offen
sive force led Stanford to its sec
ond national championship
while becoming a first-team Ail-
American and the national
freshman of the year.
And all this success has gone
to her head, right?
Her teammates beg to differ.
Stanford outside hitter Debbie
Lambert reveals that Folkl's
numerous accolades have done
little to change her down-to
earth demeanor.
"I was totally scared of her
the first time I peppered with
her," Lambert said. "But then I
realized that she is like everyone
else. She does not by any means
put herself on a pedestal."
For Pacific 10 Conference
Freshman of the Year Kerri
Walsh, Folkl's presence and
leadership have helped mold her
into the confident big-game
player that she has proven she
can be.
Walsh joined the Card after
winning the national high school
player of the year award and
being named the most highly
touted recruit of her class.
Lucky for Walsh, someone else

on the squad knows a little bit
about what that is like.
"It has been just great having
her there," Walsh said. "I look
up to her as a volleyball player
and as a person."
Even when Walsh started to
gain more notoriety for her play
and at times overshadowed her
older teammate, Folkl has had
no qualms about giving up the
spotlight.
"She is a pretty unselfish
player," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw. "She has done

a lot to help Kerri, and Kristin is
not the least bit jealous of the
attention that Kerri is getting."
When talking with her team
mates, one quickly realizes that
Folkl has earned the respect and
admiration of her fellow players
because of the type of person she
is and not just because of her
extensive athletic skills.

dle blocker Barbara Ifejika

of the nation's best volleyball teams.
but still has nothing but praise
for her teammate.
"I don't have enough good
things to say about her," Ifejika
said. "She is one of the nicest
people I know."
When pressed to reveal some
of the Folkl that the public does
not get a chance to see, Ifejika
describes how seriously she
takes her studies.
With a 2:45 p.m. plane to
catch, Folkl was determined to
attend an afternoon class and
then speed off to the airport.
After an hour of arguing, her
teammates finally convinced
her that she could copy the
notes when she returned to
campus.
"She takes school really seri
ously, but she is starting to relax
a little bit," Ifejika said. "I just
want her to flake on a class once.
Once in our four years here, we
are going to get her to do it."
Born and bred in St. Louis,
Folkl has grown up in a tight
knit family. Practically all of
Folkl's relatives live close by,
and she credits her family for
molding her character.
Considering her roots, com
ing to Stanford represented

quite a journey for Folkl and her
family. No family member had
ever left the comforts of the
Midwest to attend college.
"The thing I heard most from
my family is, 'When you go out
to California, don't get weird on
us,' " Folkl said. "Well, they
think I am still OK."
Folkl's father Thomas agrees
that she has adjusted quite well
to life on the Farm.
"Being from the Midwest,
sending your kid to California,
you worry," Thomas Folkl said.
"We were half-kidding about her
becoming weird. We just wanted
her to keep everything in per
spective."
But Folkl has not earned The
Daily's Player of the Quarter
honor simply because of her
charming personality. Folkl has
led the Cardinal to its third con
secutive conference champi
onship and the No. 1 seed in the
NCAA tournament. She has
recorded more than 400 kills
and has quietly improved all
facets of her game, making her
one of the most complete players
in the country.
"It is not just her hitting that
is so good," Shaw said. "She has
done a great job passing and
playing defense. She has become
the best passer on the team."
The player who probably
most appreciates both Folkl's

passing and hitting prowess is
All-American setter Lisa Sharp
ley. She has played with Folkl
for nearly three full seasons and
has the utmost confidence in
her.
Folkl "has stepped it up this
year," Sharpley said. "I like her
attitude because she really likes to
do everything the right way. She
is someone you can depend on."
The two players have also devel
oped a sense of each other's play,
creating a potent combination.
"I think this year I have got
ten a better feel as to when to
get her the ball," Sharpley said.
"We can look each other in the
eye and know we are on the
same page."
Stanford has high hopes of
returning to the Final Four in
Cleveland and earning its third
national championship of the
decade, and those dreams will
rest largely upon the shoulders
of Folkl. That sounds pretty
good to the Card.
"She makes the big plays,"
Shaw said. "When the game is
on the line, she is definitely able
to pick up her play."
Despite all her awards, Folkl
has never earned The Daily's
Player of the Week honors while
playing volleyball. Well, making
her Player of the Quarter should
help compensate for that mis
take.
