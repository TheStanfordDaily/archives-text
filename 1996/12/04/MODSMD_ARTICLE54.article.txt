# Swimming gets short vacation
## 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
The men's swim team is one
of the many Stanford winter
sports teams that will have a
short winter break, returning to
campus Dec. 27 to resume train
ing for its upcoming January
competitions. Before heading
home, though, the Cardinal
swimmers will head south to
Ijong Beach, Calif., to compete in
the Speedo Cup Invitational
tomorrow through Saturday.
The Speedo Cup follows the
same event format as the NCAA
Championships, giving the swim
mers a chance to experience the
feeling of racing in morning pre
liminary heats and evening
championship final swims for
three days in a row. Therefore,
the meet will be valuable for its
feeling and format, as well as
being another opportunity for
the Cardinal to progress toward
its end-of-the-season goals.
"This meet will be prepara
tion for the end of the year," said
assistant coach Ted Knapp. "It
in itself is good practice for
NCAAs."
"This meet is important
because it will give the team a
chance to feel what it is like to
swim with pain at the end of
three days," said volunteer assis-

is a good chance
to bond as a team
and focus on the
upcoming dual
meet season.'

tant Mike Covert. "That is some
thing different from what it feels
like in dual meets, when you've
been just training hard."
The swimmers themselves

see the Speedo Cup as another
stepping stone on the way to
NCAAs as well.
"I would like to swim faster
while I am unrested at the
Speedo Invite than I did, shaved
and rested, last year at Pac-lOs,
so I can pick up my NCAA cut
early," said sophomore distance
swimmer Matt O'Mara.
The NCAA sets qualifying
standards which swimmers
must meet on an individual basis
to be invited to the NCAA Cham
pionships in Minneapolis, March
27-29. Those who do not make
the "automatic" standards in
their respective events can still
be invited on a wild card basis,
provided they have met the
NCAA "B" qualifying times.
It is these "B" standards, as
well as the faster automatic, or
"A" cuts, that will be within
reach of many of the Stanford
team members in Long Beach.
Achieving these goals in early
December is something the
Stanford team has done fre
quently in the past and could
very well accomplish at the
Speedo Cup.
"We can pick up quite a few
consideration standards at this
meet," Knapp said. "Plus, it will
be our fust chance this season to
see other Pac-10 teams, like
USC, Arizona State and Ari
zona."
"Christmas training is a good
chance to bond as a team and
focus on the upcoming dual meet
season," said senior freestyler
Jonathan Lischke.
That dual meet season will
start off with a bang Jan. 10,
when the Cardinal plays host to
rival Michigan. The meet,
which will be held at deGuerre
Pool, promises to be an exciting,
hotly contested bout between
the Wolverines and the Cardi
nal, two highly ranked squads.
It will be Stanford's first dual
meet of the year against a
formidable opponent, after hav
ing had little trouble with North
ern Arizona and California in
October and November
Many on the Stanford team
look to the Michigan meet with
anticipation. Freshman Kurt
Spenser, however, will be racing
with special interest, after growing
up near Michigan's campus.
"I'm from Ann Arbor, so I see
those Michigan guys a lot," said
Spenser. "I'm excited to swim
them in our first big dual meet."
Michigan will indeed be an
important meet for the Cardinal,
but senior captain Scott Jones
keeps it in perspective.
"We would like to beat Michi
gan, but we need to remember .that
what happens in January isn't
always what happens in March (at
NCAAs)," Jones said
For now, the Card will focus on
the steps ahead — the Speedo Cup
Invitational and winter training
camp — and will emerge next quar
ter ready to step up confidently
against the rest of the NCAA.
