# Seniors say goodbye to field hockey
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The successful field hockey
season has drawn to a close, and
senior tri-captains Amy Marfil,
Baochi Nguyen and Karla Peter
son, each in pursuit of nonath
letic aspirations, leave one of the
most outstanding field hockey
squads Stanford has ever fielded.
For the young Cardinal
squad, attaining the North
Pacific Conference champi
onship after defeating California
in its final game of the season
was only "icing on top of the
cake," according to coach Sheryl
Johnson.
The Stanford team made
leaps and bounds this year; the
strength and leadership of the
three graduating seniors has
brought the skills of individual
players to a higher level and ele
vated the energy of the Card as a
team. The squad's winning
streak, which lasted over half
the season, shows that, under
the tri-captains' guidance, its
members executed a high and
consistent level of play through
out the campaign.
"I was always so happy to be a
captain with Amy and Karla,"
Nguyen said. She said all three
have different styles of leader
ship that helped make the Card
an exceptional, well-rounded and
everlasting squad both on and
off the field.
Marfil was the team's mood
setter; her psyche never failed to
pump up the team for the
intense matches the Card faced
on the road to becoming champi
on. Although teammates often
jokingly referred to her as a
"goof-off," they also agreed that
when Marfil meant business, she
meant it. When the squad want
ed to win, Marfil was the tough
est person around, Nguyen said.
Peterson was the team men
tor; her gentle humor and witty
intelligence allowed players to
come to her for help anytime,
anywhere. Although she was the
one who made sure all of the
team's "dirty work" was not left
undone, Peterson was by no
means a behind-the-scenes cap
tain.
"She's always in the right
place at the right time," said
Marfil of Peterson. "That's why

she's always getting hit with the
ball — she doesn't back away."
Peterson wasn't the team
bully, but she didn't get pushed
around either. She once scared
Marfil to death when Marfil had
to drive her to the hospital after
a severe blow to the head (a rela
tively common occurrence for
Peterson).
Nguyen also shared the role of
team psychiatrist with Peterson.
Always the first to sense the psy
chological downs of the younger
members, Nguyen had her own
way of executing leadership and
pulling the team together.
"I tackle every problem and
approach every player in con
text," she said. Nguyen shares
personal anecdotes with team
mates to let them know she can
relate to their problems.
Off the field, the athletes are
students with vast dreams for
the future. The three do not
have specific post-graduation
plans yet; however, together
with the drive and devotion they
have shown on the field for four
years, there is little doubt that
their great sense of humor and
leadership skills will take them
far in their lives after Stanford.
Nguyen is an English major
and spent last summer in Viet
nam on a Euro-grant to write
about women's issues there.
"I want to go to business
school. I want to go to law
school; I want to write a book,"
Nguyen said. "But I won't be
surprised if I did none of those. I
want to do everything."
Fellow captains share Nguyen's
high aspirations. After the season
ended last month, Peterson
plunged right into volunteering
many hours at a clinic. She said
she loves the work there, which
involves acting as a Spanish-
English translator for the doc
tors and patients. Although she
enjoys her workload as a
mechanical engineer major, the
ambitious senior said she is glad
she minored in biology and kept
her options open, as she now has
aspirations to enter medical
school.
Marfil, a human biology
major, is looking to pursue a
career in sports medicine. Marfil
experienced a stress fracture in
her third year on the team and
found herself spending a lot of

time in the training room recov
ering.
"I have no idea what I'll be
doing next year," Marfil said.
"But I definitely want to go to
grad school sometime in the
future."
Marfil plans to keep track of

her younger teammates.
"The team is always a stable
something," Marfil said. "It has
always been a consistent place
where I can be accepted. Every
year, you get attached to playing


Laura Hester [ uly
Senior field hockey players Baochi Nguyen. Amy Marfil and
Peterson leave behind a successful career and pleasant mei
with Ithe seniorsl, and it's really
scary to realize that you're one
of them now. The four years on
the team went by really fast."
Marfil shouldn't have any
trouble keeping in touch with
this year's fellow seniors. The
three captains are all from the
Bay Area and live within a 10-
mile radius of each other. Two
were on the same after-school
soccer teams in junior high, and
they all played against each
other in high school field hock
ey.
Although the Cardinal roster
has an immense amount of
growing young talent which will
be ready to fill in the three
empty spots left by the parting
seniors, the leadership of the tri
captains and their unique per
sonalities will be missed tremen
dously.
Juniors Paige Mader and Kel
ley Navlor, who played with the
tri-captains the longest, said
they have countless memories of

intense fun and playing with the
seniors.
"I've played with Amy, Karla
and Baochi longer than anyone
else," said Mader, who has start
ed in almost every game with
the graduating seniors since
arriving at Stanford. "I'm going
to miss their leadership, their

'Playing field
hockey has been
the best experience
I've had here.'
— Karla Peterson

counseling and most of all their
good sense of humor."
"Playing field hockey has
been the best experience I've
had here," said Peterson, who
walked on to the squad as a
freshman after discovering her
accomplished field hockey skills
and athletic ability were very
much in demand. "The chem
istry, teamwork and the makeup
of the croup is crreat. It was so

fun playing this year."
Although the team was not
rewarded with a postseason
berth, the three graduating
seniors agree that next year will
definitely be a strong season for
the Card.
Aside from its annual trip to
the East, the Card already has
plans to make a trip to Chicago
early next season to play against
the top teams in the nation such
as Michigan and Northwestern
in order to gain national ranking
and prestige. Although this
year's three captains will not be
with the squad then, they are as
enthusiastic about the Card's
bright future as anyone.
"Only three of us are leaving
this year," Peterson said. "The
team is going to have a great
season next year."
"They'll be an amazing team
for at least another couple of
years," Marfil agreed. "It'll be
fun to come back and see them
play."
Despite their unpredictable
future plans, the seniors agree
that they will definitely enjoy
dropping in on the squad and
playing them in alumni games.

"She's always in the right
place at the right time," said
Marfil of Peterson. "That's why

she's always getting hit with the
ball — she doesn't back away."
Peterson wasn't the team
bully, but she didn't get pushed
around either. She once scared
Marfil to death when Marfil had
to drive her to the hospital after
a severe blow to the head (a rela
tively common occurrence for
Peterson).
Nguyen also shared the role of
team psychiatrist with Peterson.
Always the first to sense the psy
chological downs of the younger
members, Nguyen had her own
way of executing leadership and
pulling the team together.
"I tackle every problem and
approach every player in con
text," she said. Nguyen shares
personal anecdotes with team
mates to let them know she can
relate to their problems.
Off the field, the athletes are
students with vast dreams for
the future. The three do not
have specific post-graduation
plans yet; however, together
with the drive and devotion they
have shown on the field for four
years, there is little doubt that
their great sense of humor and
leadership skills will take them
far in their lives after Stanford.
Nguyen is an English major
and spent last summer in Viet
nam on a Euro-grant to write
about women's issues there.
"I want to go to business
school. I want to go to law
school; I want to write a book,"
Nguyen said. "But I won't be
surprised if I did none of those. I
want to do everything."
Fellow captains share Nguyen's
high aspirations. After the season
ended last month, Peterson
plunged right into volunteering
many hours at a clinic. She said
she loves the work there, which
involves acting as a Spanish-
English translator for the doc
tors and patients. Although she
enjoys her workload as a
mechanical engineer major, the
ambitious senior said she is glad
she minored in biology and kept
her options open, as she now has
aspirations to enter medical
school.
Marfil, a human biology
major, is looking to pursue a
career in sports medicine. Marfil
experienced a stress fracture in
her third year on the team and
found herself spending a lot of

time in the training room recov
ering.
"I have no idea what I'll be
doing next year," Marfil said.
"But I definitely want to go to
grad school sometime in the
future."
Marfil plans to keep track of

her younger teammates.
"The team is always a stable
something," Marfil said. "It has
always been a consistent place
where I can be accepted. Every
year, you get attached to playing

Senior field hockey players Baochi Nguyen. Amy Marfil and
Peterson leave behind a successful career and pleasant mei
with Ithe seniorsl, and it's really
scary to realize that you're one
of them now. The four years on
the team went by really fast."
Marfil shouldn't have any
trouble keeping in touch with
this year's fellow seniors. The
three captains are all from the
Bay Area and live within a 10-
mile radius of each other. Two
were on the same after-school
soccer teams in junior high, and
they all played against each
other in high school field hock
ey.
Although the Cardinal roster
has an immense amount of
growing young talent which will
be ready to fill in the three
empty spots left by the parting
seniors, the leadership of the tri
captains and their unique per
sonalities will be missed tremen
dously.
Juniors Paige Mader and Kel
ley Navlor, who played with the
tri-captains the longest, said
they have countless memories of

intense fun and playing with the
seniors.
"I've played with Amy, Karla
and Baochi longer than anyone
else," said Mader, who has start
ed in almost every game with
the graduating seniors since
arriving at Stanford. "I'm going
to miss their leadership, their

'Playing field
hockey has been
the best experience
I've had here.'

counseling and most of all their
good sense of humor."
"Playing field hockey has
been the best experience I've
had here," said Peterson, who
walked on to the squad as a
freshman after discovering her
accomplished field hockey skills
and athletic ability were very
much in demand. "The chem
istry, teamwork and the makeup
of the croup is crreat. It was so

fun playing this year."
Although the team was not
rewarded with a postseason
berth, the three graduating
seniors agree that next year will
definitely be a strong season for
the Card.
Aside from its annual trip to
the East, the Card already has
plans to make a trip to Chicago
early next season to play against
the top teams in the nation such
as Michigan and Northwestern
in order to gain national ranking
and prestige. Although this
year's three captains will not be
with the squad then, they are as
enthusiastic about the Card's
bright future as anyone.
"Only three of us are leaving
this year," Peterson said. "The
team is going to have a great
season next year."
"They'll be an amazing team
for at least another couple of
years," Marfil agreed. "It'll be
fun to come back and see them
play."
Despite their unpredictable
future plans, the seniors agree
that they will definitely enjoy
dropping in on the squad and
playing them in alumni games.
The successful field hockey
season has drawn to a close, and
senior tri-captains Amy Marfil,
Baochi Nguyen and Karla Peter
son, each in pursuit of nonath
letic aspirations, leave one of the
most outstanding field hockey
squads Stanford has ever fielded.
For the young Cardinal
squad, attaining the North
Pacific Conference champi
onship after defeating California
in its final game of the season
was only "icing on top of the
cake," according to coach Sheryl
Johnson.
The Stanford team made
leaps and bounds this year; the
strength and leadership of the
three graduating seniors has
brought the skills of individual
players to a higher level and ele
vated the energy of the Card as a
team. The squad's winning
streak, which lasted over half
the season, shows that, under
the tri-captains' guidance, its
members executed a high and
consistent level of play through
out the campaign.
"I was always so happy to be a
captain with Amy and Karla,"
Nguyen said. She said all three
have different styles of leader
ship that helped make the Card
an exceptional, well-rounded and
everlasting squad both on and
off the field.
Marfil was the team's mood
setter; her psyche never failed to
pump up the team for the
intense matches the Card faced
on the road to becoming champi
on. Although teammates often
jokingly referred to her as a
"goof-off," they also agreed that
when Marfil meant business, she
meant it. When the squad want
ed to win, Marfil was the tough
est person around, Nguyen said.
Peterson was the team men
tor; her gentle humor and witty
intelligence allowed players to
come to her for help anytime,
anywhere. Although she was the
one who made sure all of the
team's "dirty work" was not left
undone, Peterson was by no
means a behind-the-scenes cap
tain.
"She's always in the right
place at the right time," said
Marfil of Peterson. "That's why

she's always getting hit with the
ball — she doesn't back away."
Peterson wasn't the team
bully, but she didn't get pushed
around either. She once scared
Marfil to death when Marfil had
