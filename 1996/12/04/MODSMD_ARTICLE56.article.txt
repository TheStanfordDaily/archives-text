# Wrestlers split meet in Oregon
## Cardinal prepares for weekend's Las Vegas Invitational 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
The wrestling team split a dual
meet at Oregon State this weekend by
solidly defeating Portland State 33-8
but falling 36-11 to 19th-ranked Ore
gon State. Against Portland, Stanford
won eight of its 10 matches but was
only able to manage three victories
against the tough Beavers.
Winners for the Card against Port
land included sophomore Zach Zim
merer at 126 pounds, sophomore War
ren McPherson at 142 pounds, sopho
more B.J. Sanchez at 150 pounds,
junior Doug Bardsley at 158 pounds,
junior Jeff Grant at 167 pounds,
junior Scott Chapman at 177 pounds,
senior Brian Vaniman at 190 pounds
and senior Chris Serjak at heavy
weight.
"We didn't just pull out wins
against Portland," McPherson said.
"We pulled out really big wins when
we needed them."
Oregon State, however, was a little

too much for the Card to handle. After
losing the first three matches by pins,
McPherson was able to get the Card
back on track by winning an intense
match against his Beaver opponent by
the narrow margin of 8-7.
Chapman followed suit with a solid
win at 177, defeating his opponent 13-
5. Vaniman, after technical falling his
first opponent 16-1, responded by get
ting another technical fall in his sec
ond match 15-0.
Even with its late-match surge,
Stanford was unable to make up for
the earlier losses. As Oregon State
gained more momentum with each
victory and the hometown crowd
became more energized, Stanford was
left to salvage what it could in a match
that was slipping away.
Although the Card was late in
responding to the intensity of the Ore
gon State team, "The team has shown
a lot of improvement since the San
Francisco dual meet last week,"
McPherson said. "We have definitely
gotten the preseason jitters out of the

way and are ready to wrestle."
"Overall, I was pleased, though we
started off very poorly against OSU,"
said coach Chris Horpel. "We were
unable to match their intensity until
Warren got us back on track."
Stanford travels to Stateline, Nev.
— just outside of Las Vegas — to take
on Air Force Thursday before compet
ing in the Las Vegas Invitational Fri
day and Saturday.
The Invitational usually attracts
about 40 teams from around the
nation, including many top-20 squads,
in what generally proves to be a pre
view of the NCAA tournament.
Over winter break, some members
of the Cardinal team will compete at
the Midland Championship at North
western, and other members of the
team will join forces with Oregon
wrestlers and compete in the Oregon
Classic at Oregon State.
About 10 to 15 wrestlers will com
pete for Stanford, and both events will
take place on the weekend following
Christmas.
