# Tough road trip awaits women hoops
## 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
Having survived a pesky Michi
gan team in the final of the Wahine
Classic in Hawaii, the top-ranked
Stanford women's basketball team
looks to add to its best start in five
years with a month-long stretch of
games that includes defending
national champion Tennessee and
culminates with the Cardinal host
ing the Arizona schools in the
Pacific 10 Conference opener start
ing Jan. 2.
Now 6-0 for the first time since
its 1991-92 championship season,
Stanford will play host to Mas
sachusetts at 7:30 p.m. Friday
before taking on San Francisco in
the Lady Dons' Memorial Gymna
sium Sunday at 4 p.m.
This is followed by a critical
early road stretch that includes
games against fourth-ranked Ten
nessee and No. 6 Old Dominion
before invading Boulder on the
28th to face 17th-ranked Colorado.
Sandwiched between these tough
encounters is the Santa Clara tour
nament starting on Dec. 20. The
two day tournament pits the Cardi
nal against Ohio along with Jack
son State and the host Broncos.
"I think this is the challenge
that this team needs," Stanford
head coach Tar a VanDerveer said.
"We've got to get out of our little
Maples comfort zone. It's good
diversity for us to try and come
through in tough situations."
Revenge certainly will be on the
minds of Stanford Friday. Last
year, the Cardinal opened the sea
son against the Minutewomen in
its first game without VanDerveer,
who had taken on the coaching
duties of the national team.
Ranked eighth, Stanford dropped a
tough 65-56 decision in Amherst.
"It brings back some unpleasant
memories for me, and I didn't
coach or play," VanDerveer said.
Massachusetts comes in with a
weaker ensemble than the upstart
squad that knocked off the Cardi
nal last season. The Minutewomen
return three starters, led by senior
forward Crystal Carroll, who aver
aged more than 12 and under six
rebounds per game. However,
Octavia Thomas and Melissa
Gurile have graduated, thinning
the front line considerably. Never
theless, VanDerveer is cautious
about facing them.
"They're an excellent team,"

she said. "Obviously, the fact that
they beat Stanford last year really
makes it tough."
The Lady Dons go into this
week with three wins in their first
four games, including a 73-62 win
at Ohio State Sunday. Junior
guard Brittany Lindhe scored 13
points and grabbed seven rebounds
in the win while senior guard
Jamie Shadian added 11. The pair
is among the four returning
starters from last year's West
Coast Conference champions.
"They're a team that we're
going to have to come out ready to
play against," VanDerveer said.
The Tennessee game Dec. 15
will add to a very intriguing rivalry.
After several competitive games
early in this decade (including two
one-point overtime games), the two
hoop powers blew each other out
on their respective home courts the
past two seasons. In 1994, Pat
Summitt's squad became the only
team to score 100 points on a Van-
Derveer-coached Stanford team,
winning by a 105-69 margin. Last
season, Stanford returned the
favor by throttling the Lady Vols
out of Maples 90-72. It seems high
ly unlikely that the trend will con
tinue this season in Knoxville as
the Lady Vols come in as the
defending national champion.
"It's a tough place to play, but I
think we can do very well," Van-
Derveer said. "I look forward to
going and I'm confident that our
team can do very well."
The Volunteers are led by super
sophomore forward Chamique
Holdsclaw. A preseason All-Ameri
can, she made an immediate
impact in an amazing freshman
season that saw her lead the team
in scoring (16.2) and rebounding
(9.1), helping Tennessee capture
its fourth national championship.
After leaving cavernous Thomp
son-Boling Arena, the Cardinal
head east for a showdown with
sixth-ranked Old Dominion.
"It's as tough a road trip as it
gets," VanDerveer said. The Lady
Monarchs come in as the defending
Colonial Athletic Association
champions while returning three
starters, including senior forward
Clarisse Machanguana, who aver
aged more than 18 points per game
last year.
"They're very tough and physi
cal," VanDerveer said. "But Old
Dominion has a lot of respect for
Stanford's game as well as how

physical and talented Stanford's
players are."
After participating in the Santa
Clara tournament and taking a
break, the Cardinal will fly to Col
orado to take on its third top-20
opponent of the break. This tour

nament team has all but one
starter back and will provide a
tough contest for Stanford.
"We have the talent and the
depth. We just need people focus

ing on wanting to improve and not
making the same mistakes," Van-
Derveer said.
After that crucial stretch of
games, the Cardinal kicks off 1997
with Arizona State Jan. 2, fol
lowed by Arizona Jan. 5. With its
conference winning streak at 27,
Stanford needs only one more to
tie the Pac-10 record. Arizona
State features a new face on the
sidelines in first-year coach Charli
Turner-Thorne, a former player
under VanDerveer. Thorne has a
tough task trying to resurrect a
program that went 8-19 with only
four conference wins in 1995-96.
"1 think they're doing really
well," VanDerveer said. "They
probably don't have the personnel
to compete. But sometimes it's not
about the personnel but rather
about heart and how well the team
plays together."
