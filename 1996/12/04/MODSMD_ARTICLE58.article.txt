# Men's basketball plans for busy vacation

For those of you who were
upset you couldn't catch Stan
ford's 91-69 win over Alaska-
Anchorage Saturday, fret not.
The Seawolves — that's right,
Seawolves — will be making a live
appearance at Maples Pavilion
two weeks from tonight when
they face the No. 24 Cardinal in a
rematch of Saturday's contest.
OK, so maybe Alaska-Anchor
age isn't exactly the moat hotly
anticipated home game of the
men's basketball season. But it
makes little difference because
most Stanford students will be
home for the holidays by that
time. In fact, most students will
be away from campus for the
majority of the Cardinal's
remaining preseason schedule,
the lone exception being Satur

day's game against Manhattan at
Sacramento's ArcO Arena at 4
p.m.
Then again, all but the most
die-hard Stanford fans figure to
stay home for that one. As a
result, the Cardinal can count on
playing to relatively empty hous
es for at least three of its remain
ing preseason games — Manhat
tan, Alaska-Anchorage and a
home game against Navy Dec. 28.
Stanford also plays games at San
Diego Dec. 14 and against Seton
Hall in the Meadowlands in New
Jersey Dec. 22.
Those five games should go a
long way toward determining
what the Cardinal will look like
when it opens Pacific 10 Confer
ence play with games at Arizona
State and Arizona on Jan. 2 and
4, respectively. Stanford's Pac-10
home opener is Jan. 9 against
UCLA
