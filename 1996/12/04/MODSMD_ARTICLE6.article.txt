# Real Worlders look back at frosh year
## Former Junipero residents reminisce, discuss differences in sophomore life 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Staff writer 
Editor's note: Last year, The
Daily followed the lives of seven
freshmen living together in Ju
nipero as they experienced the
highs and lows of Stanford life.
One year later, that group has
moved on, following a variety of
paths. Last week, the paths
merged once again as members
gathered to discuss how they
have changed and how they have
stayed the same while continuing
to meet the challenges of the Real
World, Stanford

What a difference a year
makes, especially when the that
means you are no longer a fresh
man.
The transition to sophomore
status for the former Real
Worlders has not always been
graceful, as former Real Worlder
Jean De La I orre admitted at the
reunion when she said. "The
sophomore slump definitely got
me at first."
Adjustment to changes in
housing, academics and social
life have been gradual. Much of
the trade-off between freshman
year and this year has been in
how energy and time are spent.
With the advent of sophomore
year, time seems to be reserved
more for solitary activities, such

as studying, figuring out person
al goals and participating in se
lect activities. Gone are the days
when, if one person decided to go
to a party, 19 others tag along.
Sophomore year has meant
finding personal niches on cam
pus. Last year, members lived in
a dormitory in which activities
and excitement could be generat
ed easily with such a large num
ber of freshman.
Life this year is defined not by
dorm dynamics but by personal
desires. Sophomore year has
been a struggle to make deci
sions, as the students narrow
their paths, honing in on activi
ties and studies m which they
wish to concentrate.
The amount of time spent
studying seems to have skyrock
eted for the former Real
Worlders. understandably, since
many are taking 19-unit course
loads.
Last year, while speaking for
the group, Grant Brown said,
"When we first got here we
stressed a lot more about getting
reading done and things like
that. But now we know we can
get by without doing most of it."
This year, George Holbert,
Grant's former roommate, sang
a different tune. George said his
sophomore year "pretty much
consists of homework" and Jean
confided that she is "a lot more
f;>cused on studies this year."
Agreeing with George and
Jean, Chandra Chnstenson said
she is "studying a lot harder and
not having quite as much fun."
