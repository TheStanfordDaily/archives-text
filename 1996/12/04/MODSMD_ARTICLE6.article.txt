# Real Worlders look back at frosh year
## Former Junipero residents reminisce, discuss differences in sophomore life 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Staff writer 
Editor's note: Last year, The
Daily followed the lives of seven
freshmen living together in Ju
nipero as they experienced the
highs and lows of Stanford life.
One year later, that group has
moved on, following a variety of
paths. Last week, the paths
merged once again as members
gathered to discuss how they
have changed and how they have
stayed the same while continuing
to meet the challenges of the Real
World, Stanford

What a difference a year
makes, especially when the that
means you are no longer a fresh
man.
The transition to sophomore
status for the former Real
Worlders has not always been
graceful, as former Real Worlder
Jean De La I orre admitted at the
reunion when she said. "The
sophomore slump definitely got
me at first."
Adjustment to changes in
housing, academics and social
life have been gradual. Much of
the trade-off between freshman
year and this year has been in
how energy and time are spent.
With the advent of sophomore
year, time seems to be reserved
more for solitary activities, such

as studying, figuring out person
al goals and participating in se
lect activities. Gone are the days
when, if one person decided to go
to a party, 19 others tag along.
Sophomore year has meant
finding personal niches on cam
pus. Last year, members lived in
a dormitory in which activities
and excitement could be generat
ed easily with such a large num
ber of freshman.
Life this year is defined not by
dorm dynamics but by personal
desires. Sophomore year has
been a struggle to make deci
sions, as the students narrow
their paths, honing in on activi
ties and studies m which they
wish to concentrate.
The amount of time spent
studying seems to have skyrock
eted for the former Real
Worlders. understandably, since
many are taking 19-unit course
loads.
Last year, while speaking for
the group, Grant Brown said,
"When we first got here we
stressed a lot more about getting
reading done and things like
that. But now we know we can
get by without doing most of it."
This year, George Holbert,
Grant's former roommate, sang
a different tune. George said his
sophomore year "pretty much
consists of homework" and Jean
confided that she is "a lot more
f;>cused on studies this year."
Agreeing with George and
Jean, Chandra Chnstenson said
she is "studying a lot harder and
not having quite as much fun."

From top to bottom, George Holbert, Joe Freund,
Chandra Christenson, Tasha Dwamena and Kevin
Chen, members of last year's Real World. Stan
ford, get back together for a reunion.

Tasha Dwamena reminisced
about studying at Junipero, say
ing that, with all freshmen living
together, Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues "was the bulk of our studies,
and we all had classes in common.
We studied together and bonded
through classes.
"This year, people are a lot
more inclined to do things on their
own," she said. "Living at Mir
rielees, I have a lot more time to
myself and I am studying harder
— hum bio, hum bio and more
hum bio. It is nice to be able to
close the door so no one will both
er you."
As Tasha pointed out, CIV, or
the lack of it, was a major change
from freshman year.
Talking about what he was
finding different this year, Grant
emphatically proclaimed, "No
CIV. CIV, CIV, CIV. Hated it!

Having said that, I am actually en
joying all my classes except
physics. Know any cool physics
majors?"
Meeting people this year seems
to be more of a challenge.
Sophomore housing, with its
lack of freshmen, has certainly
had an effect on the social atmos
phere. Kevin Chen, who lives in
Roble, is the only former member
in a four-class dorm. He said he
enjoys watching a new group go
through the changes and experi
ences he remembers so well.
Jean got lucky in the Draw and
earned a coveted room on the Row
in Storey House. Being on the
Row, said Jean, is very different
from what life was like in an all
freshman dorm.
"The adjustment to the Row has
been hard," said Jean. "Coming in,
frosh feel the need to have good
friends. Coming back as a sopho
more, you don't feel the need to be
as extroverted. I've noticed that it
takes more time for people to open
up on a deeper level."

Jean said that now, however,
she "really enjoys the friendships
made in the house. They just took
longer than last year. Only recent
ly have we begun to discuss issues
as friends rather than acquain
tances."
Chandra, who is living in EAST
House, has also found a difference
in friendships at her dorm, saying,
"At first I was bitter. I thought it
was going to be like our first year. I
miss everybody in the dorm being
bonded. I do have better girlfriends
already this year, though, because
when I came last year I concentrat
ed on making guy friends since I
had never had any before."
Social life in Mirrielees, for
Tasha, is defined by the members
of her Draw group. "Half the peo
ple aren't here most of the time be
cause they are on some athletic
team," said Tasha. "If you are not
tight with your Draw group, when
you feel like being social, it is kind
of hard."
Joe Freund commented that
one thing that was rampant last

year at Junipero which he has not
found this year, while living in the
Deke fraternity house, is "dorm
cest," or relationships involving
two people living in the same dor
mitory.
The consensus seems to be that
living in an all-freshman dorm
was an important part of the Stan
ford experience. Despite not al
ways being able to find the time to
stay in touch, a connection to Ju
nipero will remain as the members
of the first Real World, Stanford,
move on.
Proving, however, that every
where people go, they leave a piece
of themselves behind, Chandra re
vealed a legacy she left for the cur
rent residents of Room 222 in Ju
nipero — look in your desk.
Meanwhile, the lucky occu
pants of Joe and Kevin's former
room should search for a mis
placed Cal sign that was featured
in the Real World series last year.
Joe and Kevin talked about the
sign at the reunion and realized
neither has it.

miss everybody in the dorm being
bonded. I do have better girlfriends
already this year, though, because
when I came last year I concentrat
ed on making guy friends since I
had never had any before."
Social life in Mirrielees, for
Tasha, is defined by the members
of her Draw group. "Half the peo
ple aren't here most of the time be
cause they are on some athletic
team," said Tasha. "If you are not
tight with your Draw group, when
you feel like being social, it is kind
of hard."
Joe Freund commented that
one thing that was rampant last

year at Junipero which he has not
found this year, while living in the
Deke fraternity house, is "dorm
cest," or relationships involving
two people living in the same dor
mitory.
The consensus seems to be that
living in an all-freshman dorm
was an important part of the Stan
ford experience. Despite not al
ways being able to find the time to
stay in touch, a connection to Ju
nipero will remain as the members
of the first Real World, Stanford,
move on.
Proving, however, that every
where people go, they leave a piece
of themselves behind, Chandra re
vealed a legacy she left for the cur
rent residents of Room 222 in Ju
nipero — look in your desk.
Meanwhile, the lucky occu
pants of Joe and Kevin's former
room should search for a mis
placed Cal sign that was featured
in the Real World series last year.
Joe and Kevin talked about the
sign at the reunion and realized
neither has it.
Editor's note: Last year, The
Daily followed the lives of seven
freshmen living together in Ju
nipero as they experienced the
highs and lows of Stanford life.
One year later, that group has
moved on, following a variety of
paths. Last week, the paths
merged once again as members
gathered to discuss how they
have changed and how they have
stayed the same while continuing
to meet the challenges of the Real
World, Stanford

What a difference a year
makes, especially when the that
means you are no longer a fresh
man.
The transition to sophomore
status for the former Real
Worlders has not always been
graceful, as former Real Worlder
Jean De La I orre admitted at the
reunion when she said. "The
sophomore slump definitely got
me at first."
Adjustment to changes in
housing, academics and social
life have been gradual. Much of
the trade-off between freshman
year and this year has been in
how energy and time are spent.
With the advent of sophomore
year, time seems to be reserved
more for solitary activities, such

as studying, figuring out person
al goals and participating in se
lect activities. Gone are the days
when, if one person decided to go
to a party, 19 others tag along.
Sophomore year has meant
finding personal niches on cam
pus. Last year, members lived in
a dormitory in which activities
and excitement could be generat
ed easily with such a large num
ber of freshman.
Life this year is defined not by
dorm dynamics but by personal
desires. Sophomore year has
been a struggle to make deci
sions, as the students narrow
their paths, honing in on activi
ties and studies m which they
wish to concentrate.
The amount of time spent
studying seems to have skyrock
eted for the former Real
Worlders. understandably, since
many are taking 19-unit course
loads.
Last year, while speaking for
the group, Grant Brown said,
"When we first got here we
stressed a lot more about getting
reading done and things like
that. But now we know we can
get by without doing most of it."
This year, George Holbert,
Grant's former roommate, sang
a different tune. George said his
sophomore year "pretty much
consists of homework" and Jean
confided that she is "a lot more
f;>cused on studies this year."
Agreeing with George and
Jean, Chandra Chnstenson said
she is "studying a lot harder and
not having quite as much fun."

From top to bottom, George Holbert, Joe Freund,
Chandra Christenson, Tasha Dwamena and Kevin
Chen, members of last year's Real World. Stan
ford, get back together for a reunion.

Tasha Dwamena reminisced
about studying at Junipero, say
ing that, with all freshmen living
together, Cultures, Ideas and Val
ues "was the bulk of our studies,
and we all had classes in common.
We studied together and bonded
through classes.
"This year, people are a lot
more inclined to do things on their
own," she said. "Living at Mir
rielees, I have a lot more time to
myself and I am studying harder
— hum bio, hum bio and more
hum bio. It is nice to be able to
close the door so no one will both
er you."
As Tasha pointed out, CIV, or
the lack of it, was a major change
from freshman year.
Talking about what he was
finding different this year, Grant
emphatically proclaimed, "No
CIV. CIV, CIV, CIV. Hated it!

Having said that, I am actually en
joying all my classes except
physics. Know any cool physics
majors?"
Meeting people this year seems
to be more of a challenge.
Sophomore housing, with its
lack of freshmen, has certainly
had an effect on the social atmos
phere. Kevin Chen, who lives in
Roble, is the only former member
in a four-class dorm. He said he
enjoys watching a new group go
through the changes and experi
ences he remembers so well.
Jean got lucky in the Draw and
earned a coveted room on the Row
in Storey House. Being on the
Row, said Jean, is very different
from what life was like in an all
freshman dorm.
"The adjustment to the Row has
been hard," said Jean. "Coming in,
frosh feel the need to have good
friends. Coming back as a sopho
more, you don't feel the need to be
as extroverted. I've noticed that it
takes more time for people to open
up on a deeper level."

Jean said that now, however,
she "really enjoys the friendships
made in the house. They just took
longer than last year. Only recent
ly have we begun to discuss issues
as friends rather than acquain
tances."
Chandra, who is living in EAST
House, has also found a difference
in friendships at her dorm, saying,
"At first I was bitter. I thought it
was going to be like our first year. I
miss everybody in the dorm being
bonded. I do have better girlfriends
already this year, though, because
when I came last year I concentrat
ed on making guy friends since I
had never had any before."
Social life in Mirrielees, for
Tasha, is defined by the members
of her Draw group. "Half the peo
ple aren't here most of the time be
cause they are on some athletic
team," said Tasha. "If you are not
tight with your Draw group, when
you feel like being social, it is kind
