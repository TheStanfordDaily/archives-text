# THEATER
## The 						Young and the Restless The 						spirited, energetic cast of Gaieties started Big Game fever with a bang 
### 
For three consecutive nights, Stanford
geared up for Big Game by going to Gaieties, a
campus tradition almost as old as our rivalry
with Cal itself. Put on by Ram s Head Theatrical
Society, the show was one big bonding experi
ence, and everyone got to laugh at themselves

and the oddities of this school.
A showstopping production number during
the first act, in which fiat boys and sorority girls
danced to a medley of Broadway songs, was
alone worth the ticket price. But die show had
high ambitions and there were moments of ter

rific farce, scaled-down and wonderfully acted,
involving the child star character Blaise O'
Glory (Kyle Alisharan) and detective Sterling
Quad (Kevin Lemons).
The spirited, joyful cast kept the show going
with great energy, with particularly wonderful

moments involving the lovely Becky Sullivan
playing a drunk and Mike Grenier demonstrat
ing a striking possibility as to how Bob Dole
may have looked like in his youth.
Every year it becomes a bigger sin to miss out
on Gaieties. Here, a photo essay on the show.




Clockwise from top left: An audience of all colors, creeds and sexual preferences give up their drinking and hanging out time to bond together in Memorial Auditorium for an
evening of theatrical masturbation. The excitement rises and swells as orchestra members, including trumpet players Trevor Bauer and Ben Turek, perform Gaieties student
written score. Nathan Baynard, Hristo Stephanov, Kristin Grenfell and Rebecca Sullivan teach the crowd a thing or two about school spirit. Duncan Hill and Tim Quinn watch
Mike Grenier overpower Kevin Lemons with the size of his fist.
