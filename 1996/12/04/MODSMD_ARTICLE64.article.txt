# Mommy Dearest
## Crime writer James Ellroy comes to terms with his mother's murder 
### Joshua Messina 
James Ellroy, author of such best sellers
as "American Tabloid" and"The Black
Dahlia," has always had a tendency toward
violence in his writing. His new autobiog
raphy "My Dark Places" (Knopf, $25) un
covers the origins of his obsession with the
aestheticism of rage.
"My Dark Places" is Ellroy's account of
his mother's murder in the spring of 1958
and the 38-year interim before the resolu
tion of this homicide. The book begins the
morning after the murder with Ellroy con
structing short, minimalist narratives that
move the reader quickly and fastidiously
into the events surrounding the murder.
The first section serves up trite crime
novel verbiage juxtaposed with the homi
cidal historiography of the San Gabriel
Valley of Southern California. The prose is
graphic at times, but unmoving, reading
like a police log. The lack of interior access
to his characters and himself neutralizes
the efficacy of the text; Ellroy concedes the
prize of emotional effect to the sensation
alism surrounding the idea of homicide
rather than to the narrative.
But this postponement of narrative
emotion eventually pays off. The autobiog
raphy is as much about Ellroy's reinvention
of his mother's identity as it is about the
emotional effects of her death. The lack ot
emotion in the first section mirrors his
own muted reaction upon her death. Later
in the book Ellroy notes about his unre
sponsiveness: "The cops probably judged
me for not crying back at the house."
Ellroy moves the emphasis of the text
from the crime to himself in the second
section. This movement alters the narra
tive from an aesthetic monotone to an ex
plosion. He relates anecdotes of Oedipal
eroticism, his adolescent delinquency
(which included shoplifting, as well as
stealing bras and panties from the homes of
high school crushes), his superficial flirta
tion with Nazism in the early '60s and his
descent into narcotic addiction.
Ellroy is best when he moves away from
the narrative facade of "objective journal
ism" that dominates the first section and
moves into the less limiting, more turbu
lent realms of confession and perception.
He writes concerning his dad, "I dug the
Dad-as-killer-concept. It subverted my
awareness of my father's passive nature and
gave the man some panache."
It is lines like these that make this auto
biography more than a portrait of the con
struction of amorality in response to bru
tality. Instead, Ellroy hints at his own for
mation of an aesthetic of perverted vio
lence in reaction to confrontation with vi
olence. This peculiar aesthetic manifests it
self in his narcotic hallucinations — of
monsters erupting from toilets, insects
covering his body and sexualized homici

dal fantasies in which ho plays both killer
and hero — which eventually send Ellroy
into a mental hospital.
These hallucinations reveal the trans
formation of abstract rage against the con
cept of a mother, whose death deprives Ell
roy of intimate, stable knowledge of her,
into juvenile delinquency, acts of self-hate
and a morbid philosophy that covets per
verted sex and violence. But it is this imag
ined Oedipal sex, his Freudian attempt at a
more intimate knowledge of his mother
and his imaginative violence that preserve
his mother's presence.
Ellroy's hysteria leads him to remember
her for himself, and his own amorality al
lows him to accept an unjust death and an

"inadequate" mother. Ell
roy writes, "A rage to turn
my obsessions into some
thing good and useful
saved me." This line repre
sents the crux of the novel.
For Ellroy and this book,
violence serves as an Aes
culapian aesthetic of the
redemptive, not merely de
structive, power of rage.
"My Dark Places" is a
book that sneaks upon you
and suddenly the banal,
minimalist prose of the
first 80 pages seems much
more complex in retro
spect. While the sections
concerning Ellroy himself
open up the book consid
erably, the prose falters ter
ribly at times, undercut
ting the brilliance of these
sections.
The narrative has a ten
dency toward male brava
do. Ellroy relies too often
on the word "fucking" to
buttress the emotional
force and male rage in his
sentences. The simplified
prose is not redeemed by
his sometimes fiat, awk
ward emotional appraisals.
He writes repeatedly in the
book, "It was goooood."
It is these narrative mis
calculations that keep this
autobiography from being
a great one. It is, however, a
decidedly good book —
fast-paced, brutally honest
— which allows for easy,
interesting, sometimes
bawdy reading.
At 359 pages, the book
might appear an inappro
priate choice to squeeze in
between reading require
ments for classes, but this
appearance is false. It took
me two days to finish the
book. Ellroy passes his ob
session with his mother's

death to the reader. You realize halfway
through the book you aren't reading a clas
sic, but you still can't put it down.
Ellroy uses the basic component of the
crime novel — the question "Who dun
nit?" — to his advantage by postponing the

answer until the end. If for no other reason,
you will find you want to know almost as
badly as Ellroy himself who Jean Ellroy is,
who killed her, why it took 38 years to find
her killer and what happened to the son she
left behind.

Ellroy is best when he moves away from the narrative
facade of 'objective journalism' that dominates the
first section and moves into the less limiting, more tur
bulent realms of confession and perception.

into juvenile delinquency, acts of self-hate
and a morbid philosophy that covets per
verted sex and violence. But it is this imag
ined Oedipal sex, his Freudian attempt at a
more intimate knowledge of his mother
and his imaginative violence that preserve
his mother's presence.
Ellroy's hysteria leads him to remember
her for himself, and his own amorality al
lows him to accept an unjust death and an

"inadequate" mother. Ell
roy writes, "A rage to turn
my obsessions into some
thing good and useful
saved me." This line repre
sents the crux of the novel.
For Ellroy and this book,
violence serves as an Aes
culapian aesthetic of the
redemptive, not merely de
structive, power of rage.
"My Dark Places" is a
book that sneaks upon you
and suddenly the banal,
minimalist prose of the
first 80 pages seems much
more complex in retro
spect. While the sections
concerning Ellroy himself
open up the book consid
erably, the prose falters ter
ribly at times, undercut
ting the brilliance of these
sections.
The narrative has a ten
dency toward male brava
do. Ellroy relies too often
on the word "fucking" to
buttress the emotional
force and male rage in his
sentences. The simplified
prose is not redeemed by
his sometimes fiat, awk
ward emotional appraisals.
He writes repeatedly in the
book, "It was goooood."
It is these narrative mis
calculations that keep this
autobiography from being
a great one. It is, however, a
decidedly good book —
fast-paced, brutally honest
— which allows for easy,
interesting, sometimes
bawdy reading.
At 359 pages, the book
might appear an inappro
priate choice to squeeze in
between reading require
ments for classes, but this
appearance is false. It took
me two days to finish the
book. Ellroy passes his ob
session with his mother's

death to the reader. You realize halfway
through the book you aren't reading a clas
sic, but you still can't put it down.
Ellroy uses the basic component of the
crime novel — the question "Who dun
nit?" — to his advantage by postponing the

answer until the end. If for no other reason,
you will find you want to know almost as
badly as Ellroy himself who Jean Ellroy is,
who killed her, why it took 38 years to find
her killer and what happened to the son she
left behind.

Ellroy is best when he moves away from the narrative
facade of 'objective journalism' that dominates the
first section and moves into the less limiting, more tur
bulent realms of confession and perception.
