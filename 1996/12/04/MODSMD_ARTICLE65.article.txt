# What Chutzpah!
## Allegra Goodman's endearing short stories chronicle the progress of a Jewish family 
### Joanna Dickler 
Not all Jewish mothers are alike. Sure, thev
may share some of the same characteristics.
But as Allegra Goodman makes beautifully
clear in her second collection of short stories,
"The Family Markowitz" (Farrar, Straus and
Giroux, $22), beneath the stereotypes lies a
maze of individuality and explanations.
" The Family Markowitz" maps the lives of
the clan descended from Rose Markowitz,
the matriarch who hails from England by
way of Vienna and now lives in an old-timers'
apartment complex in Venice Beach, Calif.
Rose is manipulative, endlessly plucking the
heartstrings of her two sons, Henry and Ed,
in an effort to feel loved. She is chronically
nostalgic, as when she remembers i lenry and
Ed in their childhood: "How she had loved it
when they were small and spoke in breathy
voices about nothing at all."
Unfortunately, now in her 80s, Rose is
forced to think about far more than nothing
at all. Her second husband, Maury, has
passed away, leaving her (somewhat illegally)
a considerable sum of money. But the skittish
Rose wants nothing to do with it. The first
story in the collection, "Fannie Mae," shows
Ed and Henry begging her to invest the
money reasonably. Rose ends up handwrit
ing a will leaving everything to The Girls' Or

phanage in Israel.
Disgusted with her, Ed pleads, "If you do
some, um, financial planning, you could
have a safer, happier life," to which Rose defi
antly responds: "I don't want a happier life."
Hose is forever playing the role of the
finicky child. In "Oral History," a graduate
student named Alma bombards Rose with a
litany of feminist opinions in an attempt to
record the history ot Rose's former life in Eu
rope. To Alma's dismay, Rose is far from the
ideal subject; she seems to change her story
from week to week, as when she tells Alma
her family was poor and then asserts they
were upper class. " 'Well, which is the truth?'
Alma demands. 'Were you poor and ignorant
or were you cultured?' Rose folds her hands.
'We were cultured at heart.' "
Of all the stories, this is one of the few that
examines the lives of characters outside the
Markowitz family. It is refreshing. Alma's
problems reflect the themes of the Markow
itzes' neuroses: She has a controlling mother
whose influence she refuses to acknowledge,
and it results in the breakup of her relation
ship with Ron, her Jewish boyfriend. Alma's
interaction with Rose, as well as Ed's encoun
ters with members of the clergy at an acade
mic conference in "Mosquitoes," expands the
scope of the collection.
Addicted to Percodan and her own memo
ries, Rose leaves the responsibility-taking to
Ed, a terrorism expert at Georgetown Univer

sity, and Henry, an effeminate art huff who
now manages a Laura Ashley store in Oxford,
England. Luckily, Ed's wife, Sarah, has a good
enough head on her shoulders to make up for
Ed's selfishness and Henry's fluffiness.
Sarah, who appears in most of the stories
and finally has one dedicated to her at the end
of the book, is the egg in the family recipe,
holding it all together. Fortunately for Sarah,
Rose likes her. Sarah is savvy enough to he
successful in her own right (she is, wink
wink, a writer of fiction) and also fill the role
of the ideal wife. She makes excellent coffee,
for one, and she lets it bounce right off her
when she is congratulated at a bar mitzvah on
her husband's accomplishments.
But Sarah, too, is fallible; she has pub
lished only one novel, having let herself get
sidetracked in family affairs and the practi
cality of life. "If an angel or an agent came
down from New York and said, 'You, Sarah,
will write a great novel, a best seller. Not a
pulp romance, but a good book, wise and lu
minous, with a future movie bursting from
its pages,' then she would laugh for all to hear
— although she would take down the phone
number or the agent just in case."
Sarah is the smoother-over in the family.
Though the family flutters around Rose's
chronic overdoses and teary phone calls, it is
Sarah with her rock-steady dependability
who seems to be at the center of these stories.
She is wise and practical, sensitive and lov

ing, the character through whom the author
seems to speak.
Goodman's writing is excellent; she
weaves sentimentality with humor and beau
tiful phrasing. She has her characters firmly
in hand, though there is sometimes a tiring
re-explanation of who's who, since many of
the stories were published separately prior to
being collected in this book. Overall, "The
Family Markowitz" is a bittersweet, funny,
sharp view of Jewish family life, or at least as
the Markowitzes live it. They are as authentic
as your own family, though you mav he
thankful that they aren't.
