# THEATER
## Battle of Wits The 						Stanford Improvisors and Spontaneous Generation make comedy, not war

Where can you be, it" you stumble upon
Snow White being acted as a badly dubbed
porno? Only at an improv show.
Take, for example, a recent dorm appear
ance by Sponge. First, the actors took an au
dience suggestion for a fairy tale: Snow
White. Then they asked for genres and had to
perform the story according to what the au
dience called out: film noir, silent movie,
lames Bond, "Smurfs," "Independence Day"
and so on. The Sponge players did the scene,
as always, without a script.
Their stage can be anywhere, their scenes
can be about anything, and they don't wear
costumes. The actors in these elusive perfor
mances are none other than improvisers; im
provisation, or "improv," has been taught at
Stanford for almost 20 years.
As far as performances go, there are two
troupes on campus, both of which have been
around since 1491: the Stanford Improvi
sors, better known as SIMPS, and Sponge.
SIMPS is aligned with the Drama Depart
ment and the group holds auditions and re
quires that its members take an improv class.
Sponge, on the other hand, is an open group
associated with Ram's Head Theatrical Soci
ety (the group on campus that produces Gai
eties, as well as a number of other theater
productions).
Because improv mimics life in many ways,

spontaneity
reigns and scenes
performed in
practice can turn
out better than
those in a show.
Ryan Higman, a
fifth-year senior
in human biolo
gy and Spanish,
and member of
SIMPS, said the
unpredictability
of improv can be
both the best and
the worst thing
about it.
"The thing I
like about im-

prov is that it never is the same," said Hig
man. "Sometimes that's sad because if you
have a great scene, you just want to play it
back to your friends over and over again. But
that's also the nice thing about it — you're
not going to expect what happens that night,
and so it never gets old."
Drama Lecturer Patricia Ryan, who teach
es "Drama 103: Introduction to Improvisa
tion," pioneered the class 17 years ago. She
said improvisation is probably much differ
ent from what people expect it to be.

"Improv doesn't simply
mean doing whatever you like,"
said Ryan, "or doing anything
that comes to mind. It does
mean working with what's
right in front of you; using the
current reality in a constructive
or creative way. And there are
certain skills that an improviser
can develop. An improviser can
practice, for example, noticing
everything that's in the room
and becoming an expert at pay
ing attention."
At this point in the inter
view, Ryan asked me to close
my eyes and to name every
thing in the room.
"Now open your eyes," she
said. "Isn't reality much more
dense than what you thought it
was when you closed your
eyes?"
'It's like bringing the oral
tradition to life'

Becca Brams, a SIMPS member and ju
nior majoring in anthropology, said she took
improvisation originally because it fit into
her schedule, and then it became a large part
of her life.
"It changed the way I look at the world,"

'Life is improv; you don't know what you're going to
say next. It's OK to screw up in the improv world. If
you're not failing sometimes, you're not taking enough
risks. It can free you up to take on things even if
you're not sure you can do them.'

Brams said about taking Drama 103 her
freshman year. "Life is improv; you don't
know what you're going to say next. It's OK to
screw up in the improv world. If you're not
failing sometimes, you're not taking enough
risks. It can free you up to take on things even
if you're not sure you can do them. It combats
the perfectionism that I think a lot of Stan
ford students suffer from."
In Drama 103 students get regular prac
tice at performing improv and also learn the

concepts and ideas behind it from Keith
Johnstone's 1979 textbook "Impro."
The conceptual framework Johnstone
provides for improv is based on basic skills
that apply to all human interactions, like lis
tening acutely to people and attuning to their
presence, as well as being aware of the way
people present themselves, or their "status"
in a particular situation. A person can pre
sent themselves as high or low status through
physical demeanor: whether one makes eye
contact and maintains it, the way one holds
one's head, whether one fidgets, etc.
"I don't know if I believe that every single
situation has a pecking order," said Brams. "I
think, though, that status is a subconscious
thing that everybody kind of notices. A lot of
improv is about things we all kind of know,
but it brings them to the fore."
In one form or another, improv has been
around as long as people have been telling
stories. But Johnstone created a formal type
of improv called Theatre Sports, which
SIMPS uses in its performances.
"Theatre Sports is a form in which improv
happens under a competitive umbrella using
Olympic-style judges to prevent the audience
from having to sit through a lot of schlack,"
said Ryan.
There is a master of ceremonies, judges
and two teams that "compete" against each
other by playing various improv games. The
master of ceremonies has a horn, and when
the scene looks like it is failing, she or he can
blow the horn and stop the scene.
Also, Theatre Sports has something called
"the bag," where audience members and

players alike can shout "the bag" if someone
introduces a tasteless element into the scene.
Then, whoever made the offensive comment
has to wear a hag over her or his head.
Sponge performances are more free-form.
The performers play improv games in front
of an audience, and there is no competition.
While Theatre Sports keeps the show from
getting out of control, Sponge director Karen
Bergstrom, a senior English major, said she
prefers a less structured approach.
"We really like this because it's very audi
ence-interactive," said Bergstrom. "It's like
bringing the oral tradition to life."
What both groups have in common is the
games they play, which range from explo
rations in genre to scenes where audience
members directly participate as talking pil
lars. A professional improv group in San
Francisco called Bay Area Theatre Sports, or
BATS, publishes a book of games which lists
more than 300.
Much like athletic events, improv games
hold the suspense of pending success or fail
ure and the excitement of the unknown. And
improv's nonsensical side is always good for a
lot of laughs.
So as you're heading to an improv show,
remember, whatever you expect, it's going to
be... something else.

The SIMPS end-of-the-quarter show will be
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Little
Theater. Tickets cost $5. Sponge is available to
perform upon request; contact Karen
Rergstrotn at 497-0872 for information.

Drama Lecturer Patricia Ryan, who teach
es "Drama 103: Introduction to Improvisa
tion," pioneered the class 17 years ago. She
said improvisation is probably much differ
ent from what people expect it to be.

"Improv doesn't simply
mean doing whatever you like,"
said Ryan, "or doing anything
that comes to mind. It does
mean working with what's
right in front of you; using the
current reality in a constructive
or creative way. And there are
certain skills that an improviser
can develop. An improviser can
practice, for example, noticing
everything that's in the room
and becoming an expert at pay
ing attention."
At this point in the inter
view, Ryan asked me to close
my eyes and to name every
thing in the room.
"Now open your eyes," she
said. "Isn't reality much more
dense than what you thought it
was when you closed your
eyes?"
'It's like bringing the oral
tradition to life'

Becca Brams, a SIMPS member and ju
nior majoring in anthropology, said she took
improvisation originally because it fit into
her schedule, and then it became a large part
of her life.
"It changed the way I look at the world,"

'Life is improv; you don't know what you're going to
say next. It's OK to screw up in the improv world. If
you're not failing sometimes, you're not taking enough
risks. It can free you up to take on things even if
you're not sure you can do them.'

Brams said about taking Drama 103 her
freshman year. "Life is improv; you don't
know what you're going to say next. It's OK to
screw up in the improv world. If you're not
failing sometimes, you're not taking enough
risks. It can free you up to take on things even
if you're not sure you can do them. It combats
the perfectionism that I think a lot of Stan
ford students suffer from."
In Drama 103 students get regular prac
tice at performing improv and also learn the

concepts and ideas behind it from Keith
Johnstone's 1979 textbook "Impro."
The conceptual framework Johnstone
provides for improv is based on basic skills
that apply to all human interactions, like lis
tening acutely to people and attuning to their
presence, as well as being aware of the way
people present themselves, or their "status"
in a particular situation. A person can pre
sent themselves as high or low status through
physical demeanor: whether one makes eye
contact and maintains it, the way one holds
one's head, whether one fidgets, etc.
"I don't know if I believe that every single
situation has a pecking order," said Brams. "I
think, though, that status is a subconscious
thing that everybody kind of notices. A lot of
improv is about things we all kind of know,
but it brings them to the fore."
In one form or another, improv has been
around as long as people have been telling
stories. But Johnstone created a formal type
of improv called Theatre Sports, which
SIMPS uses in its performances.
"Theatre Sports is a form in which improv
happens under a competitive umbrella using
Olympic-style judges to prevent the audience
from having to sit through a lot of schlack,"
said Ryan.
There is a master of ceremonies, judges
and two teams that "compete" against each
other by playing various improv games. The
master of ceremonies has a horn, and when
the scene looks like it is failing, she or he can
blow the horn and stop the scene.
Also, Theatre Sports has something called
"the bag," where audience members and

players alike can shout "the bag" if someone
introduces a tasteless element into the scene.
Then, whoever made the offensive comment
has to wear a hag over her or his head.
Sponge performances are more free-form.
The performers play improv games in front
of an audience, and there is no competition.
While Theatre Sports keeps the show from
getting out of control, Sponge director Karen
Bergstrom, a senior English major, said she
prefers a less structured approach.
"We really like this because it's very audi
ence-interactive," said Bergstrom. "It's like
bringing the oral tradition to life."
What both groups have in common is the
games they play, which range from explo
rations in genre to scenes where audience
members directly participate as talking pil
lars. A professional improv group in San
Francisco called Bay Area Theatre Sports, or
BATS, publishes a book of games which lists
more than 300.
Much like athletic events, improv games
hold the suspense of pending success or fail
ure and the excitement of the unknown. And
improv's nonsensical side is always good for a
lot of laughs.
So as you're heading to an improv show,
remember, whatever you expect, it's going to
be... something else.

The SIMPS end-of-the-quarter show will be
Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Little
Theater. Tickets cost $5. Sponge is available to
perform upon request; contact Karen
Rergstrotn at 497-0872 for information.

Where can you be, it" you stumble upon
Snow White being acted as a badly dubbed
porno? Only at an improv show.
Take, for example, a recent dorm appear
ance by Sponge. First, the actors took an au
dience suggestion for a fairy tale: Snow
White. Then they asked for genres and had to
perform the story according to what the au
dience called out: film noir, silent movie,
lames Bond, "Smurfs," "Independence Day"
and so on. The Sponge players did the scene,
as always, without a script.
Their stage can be anywhere, their scenes
can be about anything, and they don't wear
costumes. The actors in these elusive perfor
mances are none other than improvisers; im
provisation, or "improv," has been taught at
Stanford for almost 20 years.
As far as performances go, there are two
troupes on campus, both of which have been
around since 1491: the Stanford Improvi
sors, better known as SIMPS, and Sponge.
SIMPS is aligned with the Drama Depart
ment and the group holds auditions and re
quires that its members take an improv class.
Sponge, on the other hand, is an open group
associated with Ram's Head Theatrical Soci
ety (the group on campus that produces Gai
eties, as well as a number of other theater
productions).
Because improv mimics life in many ways,

spontaneity
reigns and scenes
performed in
practice can turn
out better than
those in a show.
Ryan Higman, a
fifth-year senior
in human biolo
gy and Spanish,
and member of
SIMPS, said the
unpredictability
of improv can be
both the best and
the worst thing
about it.
"The thing I
like about im-

prov is that it never is the same," said Hig
man. "Sometimes that's sad because if you
have a great scene, you just want to play it
back to your friends over and over again. But
that's also the nice thing about it — you're
not going to expect what happens that night,
and so it never gets old."
