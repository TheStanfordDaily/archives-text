# Screening the Web
## Web sites for 'Jerry Maguire,' 'Star Trek' talk back and act nasty 
### Laura Shin 
"Ask YFS or NO questions and learn your
late!" satd the Magic Heart icon on the com
puter screen.
So I asked, '7s someone interested in me?"
"Not in this lifetimeappeared the magi
cal reply.
Not so easily bruised, I thought I'd give the
Magic Heart another chance to give tne its
blessing.
"Was that last answer serious?" / asked.
"What are you, drunk?' it answered.
You, too, can have such a magical expe
rience when you visit the World Wide Web
site for the upcoming movie "Jerry
Maguire."
Among the many other rime-wasting
options at this site, you can "watch" the
weekly episodes of "Love Lessons," where
you find yourself in the thick of a budding
romantic relationship between jerry (Tom
Cruise) and Dorothy (Renee Zellweger).
You even get to read their journals,
through which the Web site reveals new
plot developments. In the first week, we
discover that Dorothy finds ferry attrac
tive.
Like a pick-a-path children's book, we
are asked, "What's the best way to get Jerry
to noticc her?" By choosing the advice of
one of several other characters, we deter
mine the fate of the relationship.
I chose to ask Dorothy's 5-year-old son,
Ray, who advised his mother to buy jerry a
Power Rangers doll. The end result: "You
spend eternity browsing the aisles of Toys
'R' Us with a maxed-out credit card." A
dead-end path.
Sometimes, following the advice of a
character does not result in decisive action,
but in an enticement to tune in next week.
A Webbed version of "To be continued."
Exciting, exciting.
If you want to share your lovely discov
ery of the jerry Maguire Web page with that
special someone, you can also send elec
tronic love postcards.
If your horoscope has not yet disclosed
"if you and your mate are making the
'Love' connection," you can take a quiz that
will tell you.
And if that Shakespeare side of your per
sonality is just bursting to be free, you can
compose your own love sonnet. Reminis
cent of Mad Libs, the screen asks you for a
certain number of nouns, verbs, adjectives
and other grammatical components and
then poeticizes them.
1, with my Silicon Muse, was inspired to
create these lines of verse for a character in
the movie enamored by another character.
Laurel. The italicized words are mine, the
rest the computer's.
Laurel, ma petite, fragrant soapdish of my

dreams,
Each slavery as I ignore in my bed, yearning
for your tear sculpture,
I can feel my tapestry, flying with a sense of
publicity
which 1 have never before travel.
Well, maybe once when I was eatinga cruise
ship,
but that was only because I was young and
lonely.
All in all, the ''Jerry Maguire" Web site
can serve as the Web browser's own per
sonal Dr. Ruth / Cyrano de Bergerac while
ottering a few tidbits about the upcoming
movie. Its best feature, though, is the
chance to enter a sweepstakes to go to
Switzerland.
'Your ears are small but
oddly attractive'
The "Star Trek: First Contact" Web site
offers even more â€” "a long trip via inter
stellar shuttle" and a new identity as a Star
Trek species, such as a Ferengi, 1 luman or
Vulcan. And it bestows on you an incredi
ble honor: "You are now a member of the
crew. WELCOME ABOARD."
With this position, you gain entrance to

different rooms in the spaceship, like the
observation lounge, main bridge,
holodeck, transporter room, sickbay or en
gineering room, to chat with other
Trekkies.
This position, however, has risks in
volved: "As a crew member, you may be
called upon to take up active duty, includ
ing combat duty, in an emergency situa
tion," says the warning on the screen.
lust like matter is mostly empty space,
the danger is mostly empty threat. The
most action at this Web site is the exchange
of pre-written greetings, which can range
trorn tender messages to your newfound
shipmate, "Your cars are small but oddly
attractive," to the occasional harsh reply,
"You make your species look cheap."
Most of the other Web browsers, h< >wev
er, don't seem to know how to send out
message*. Often, the only communication
going on is the automatic computer display
that says something like, "LS- 128744726-E
has entered the Holodeck."
Since many of these pre-composed lines
concern the running of the ship and we
"members of the crew" barely know how to
do that, the Web site ends up as a thwarted
attempt to run a video game among
straneers who know none of the rules and

who enter, don't participate and then exit
the game whenever they wish.
Trekkie fans seem to have compensated
tor the lack of excitement to be found here
with their own Web pages on the upcom
ing movie. They include "rave reviews" of
the movie, link to other Web sites about the
movie and even rate these other Web sites.
'Mars Attacks!' 'Evita'
Other Web sites of recent movies are less
exciting and interactive. At the "Mars At
tacks!" Web site, a large, primary-colored,
pulsating map frightens you: "Invasion
Warning! This is not a Test!'
You can choose to visit any one of the
cities with green circles emanating from it,
which are presumably the sites in the
movie. These link up to information about
members of the cast, like Michael J. Fox
and Sarah Jessica Parker.
In addition, you can view trailers for the
movie as well as pictures of the exotic ex
traterrestrial arms used in"the Martian
reign of terror over Planet Harth I was so
frightened by the stilted photos that I
quicklv switched to other sections ot the
