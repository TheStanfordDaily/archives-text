It was about time someone did a scientific, in
depth study of a cappella groups on campus. But we
thought it would be more fun to just round up a group
of singers, lock them in the Xanadu pool room and
dig for as much dirt as we could find. Alas, the truth
is, a cappella people are happy. That's all there is to
it. So when you go digging for some scandal to un
earth, you'll just find a bunch of hard-working peo
ple who love to sing—disappointing but true.
INTERMISSION: Why are there so many a cappella
groups at Stanford?
Matthew Kaufman (Harmonics): Well, I'd like to
point out that Yale has over 20.
Geraldine Chung (Everyday People): They all have
houses, too. They live together. It's like fraternities
there. They have to rush there. There's like a rush
week for a cappella. It's really intense.
So do we have hard-core recruiting here? Do you have A
Cappella Hell Week or something like that?
Matthew: There are other schools that have formal
rules. For example, at Princeton, if you don't get into
a group your freshman year, you're never allowed to
audition again. Once you get in, you're in forever. It's
not like that here.
John Niekrasz (Fleet Street Singers): I'd like to say
something that's different about Stanford. Each of the
groups have a very specialized style. With Yale, there's
probably four or five groups that all sing the same

specialized style. I would say all of us have very differ
ent ideas of what a cappella can be.
Geraldine: I think that's a good rebuttal to all those
who say, "Oh, it's just another a cappella group," be
cause I think for all of us, we all feel that we come
from very different places. Yeah, we all sing a cappel
la, we all love music, but I don't think people know
how diverse we are. Like Mixed Company. It's alter
native pop.
Matthew: I remember my freshman year when Fleet
Street hosted two groups from Yale, and both groups
were female and both focused on vocal jazz. We don't
come close to having two identical groups here.
What arc the stereotypes of each group?
Dara Frimmer (Counterpoint): Counterpoint are
lesbian feminists. (Laughter)
Ritu Kapur (Counterpoint): I think it would be in
teresting to hear what other groups think of each
other, and if those groups agree.
So, then, what do people think of, say. Harmonics?
Christine Nguyen (Harmonics): Well, we're the
youngest group on campus, so I see us as having less

of an identity compared to the others. We don't real
ly have a niche yet. Flow would you guys see us?
John: Very happy-go-lucky.
Lisa Anfield (Talisman): I think you're really mellow,
but happy.
Ritu: But the fact that you guys sang "Under Brown
Arches" during finals week last year was, to me, an
amazing description of your group. That's how much
you love a cappella. And just hanging out. Dedicated
people.
John: She said exactly what it is. They're a young
group, and I think that's part of what they are right
now. They're trying to define what they want to do.
And each year they're improving significantly.
Christine: I think people see us as having a really
clean-cut image.
Is that good or had?
Christine: I can't say whether it's good or bad. I guess
it's just true. The way we hang out together is kind of
sick, but ... I don't know, what would you say,
Matthew?
Matthew: We sort of do give off that clean-cut image,
which doesn't necessarily apply to people as individ
uals. So I guess it doesn't really apply to the group.
There are exceptions to all stereotypes, but what I re
ally like about our group in particular is that virtual
ly everybody is a big fan of a cappella in general. It
isn't like, "Oh, well, I like to sing, but I wouldn't want
to listen to this." I think everyone loves being a part of
it, loves listening to it. I know I go to virtually every
concert of any group here, and that holds true for a lot
of these people. We love to sing, and we love to sing

'Some might view it as an elite group, except that a cappella
is an audience-oriented thing. Anyone can audition, but when
you reach a certain level, you can't take everyone. And
sometimes there's a certain bitterness in people you've cut.'

together.
Cieraldine: I think that goes for everybody, pretty
much.
Dara: Why did the Mendicants start? I mean, wooing
women and all that, but clearly there must have been
guys who wanted to sing.
Carl Walter (Mendicants): Originally we weren't
started as an a cappella group. I think a cappella kind
of grew. In the beginning, we would bring guitars and
stuff like that on stage with us. We weren't the typical
a cappella group — it was basically just a hangout
time. One guy would call his friends together and
they'd go over to Branner, which was an all-female
dorm at the time, and they'd, well, try to get women.
So the basis of your group is the personification of a pick
up line?
Mike Lahood (Mendicants): Well, yeah, although
that's not necessarily true now. You have some aspects
where we go and serenade people. But I like to go out
and just sing. We like singing and we like hearing our
selves sing. (Laughter)
Ritu: When you get them together for anything, they
will sine. I feel like the Mendicants are very tradition

al, guys you would take home to mom.
Mike: We start out our shows giving roses to women
in the audience.
So if Mendicants are good guys and Harmonics are
clean-cut, who is the bad-ass group?
Ritu: I don't think you can see people who sing "shoo
bop bop" as bad-ass.
Dara: Mixed Company's last album had a lot of cool
grunge music like Pearl Jam and Alanis Morissette.
Are there any bad stereotypes to dispel?
Ritu: I've heard of people who don't like a cappella in
general, but 1 don't think anyone has anything against
a particular group.
Lisa: I just think you like or don't like a cappella, and
if you like it, you'll pretty much appreciate all the
groups.
Ritu: Some people think you're not improving it
without instruments, so why do it? I think a lot of the
reason a cappella is viewed as obnoxious is that it's
jusi like any group on campus: If you get people to
gether doing something they love, they'll be really in
tense about it. There's so much dedication in this
community. If you knew the time we spend making
fliers, photocopying music ...
Christine: It's the a cappella cult. You tell people you
sing a cappella, and they automatically have this
image of you.
Marcella White (Mixed Company): You have to do it
to really understand what's going on.
Matthew: Some might view it as an elite group, except
that a cappella is an audience-oriented thing. Anyone
can audition, but when you reach a certain level, you
can't take everyone. And sometimes there's a certain
bitterness in people you've cut.
John: Fleet Street was begun by someone who audi
tioned and didn't get in. He wasn't happy with the
style so he created his own group. That's one way new
groups get started.
Ritu: It's also not necessarily how well people sing,
but how they blend in with the group.
Geraldine: I think that's especially true for Talisman
and us, because we have a lot of people who try out
and are really good singers, but they need to have
soul.
Dara: The worst is when you see someone who didn't
make it around campus.
Lisa: You remember them so well.
Matthew: Especially when it's someone you already
know.
Ritu: That's ass.
What percent oj people who try out make it?
Matthew: This year, each group took an average of six
to eight new people. You're talking 50-plus people
overall in groups. About 200 people audition.
John: Yeah, but there are people who audition forcer
tain groups and not others, and who, because of their
voices and styles, could have made one group but not
another.

Para: I get the feeling you're looking for
scandal.
Is there any to be looking for?
Dara: Yes.
Ritu: No.
Dara: A cappella-cest. We talked about the a
cappella cult and part of it is this inter-dat
ing, interaction thing. And I'll start with the
most innocent one: Counterpoint and Men
dicants have always had a history together.
We even have a group called The Basics, one
Counterpointer and one Mendicant who got
married and arc now singing for a living.
Poes this go on within individual groups?
Melody Mestemacher (Mixed Company):
Well, there are definitely weird attractions
that go on, and things that do happen or
could happen ...
Christine: In Harmonics there were three
couples in the group last year.
Matthew: You're in close proximity, spend a
lot of time together. We also do a lot of social
stuff together as a group.
Dara: There are certain people in certain a
cappella groups that have dated multiple
people in one group.
Ritu: You just need to be mature about the
whole thing.
Christine: A cappella-cest just happens. You
have stuff in common with these people, and
the group brings together commonalities.
Marcella: A cappella people also understand
that you don't have a whole lot of free time.
Mike: It's definitely a lot different than that. I
mean, Mendicants are a big part of my life,
but 1 don't know everyone in all the a cappel
la groups. It's not always A Cappella Central.
Geraldine: We don't want to give people the
impression that we're some alien colony in
the middle of everyone else.
So what about competition between groups?
Ritu: It's always great to try to improve your
self but sometimes it becomes unnecessary
and political. Apart from social, it's a good
idea to get people involved because it could
be the way people go on to other things. But
there are definite group identities, and
they're strong ones. Like in Counterpoint, we
are really close and all hang out together, and
that's really good for the individuals and the
group, but I still wish there was more [unity]
between groups. It's hard, though, when
there's a lot of talent and everyone wants to
be the best.

'If there is a personality conflict, I don't think there's much you
can do but try to work it out as best as you can. You can't kick
them out of the group just because you don't like them.'

Christine: There is unity between groups,
though. Like this summer, there was a group
formed called Some People Who Can Sing,
made of different people from different
groups. It got up to 40 people sometimes.
Ritu: 1 was in Switzerland and even / heard
about it.
Para: Different people getting together to
sing different songs — that's the true sense
of a cappella. I would like to see more of
that.
John: Competition isn't ail bad, though. I
would say the fact that we have so many dif
ferent groups has made Stanford the king of a
cappella in the West. The fact that other West
Coast schools — Berkeley, UC'.A, Pomona
— have three groups makes it so there's no
competition there, so you never see them
outside their own schools, and they don't im
pact their own schools very much. We have a
big effect on our school. People at Stanford
have heard a lot more different kinds of
music because of the competition and vari
ous styles and the impact of a cappella on
Stanford.
Has the competition ever gotten ugly?
lohn: There are some parts of the year, like
Spring Show, when everyone's trying to find a

slot. Scheduling conflicts often cause trouble.
Lisa: At the beginning of the year everyone's
recruiting for the same people, so that gets
intense.
Dara: Everyone wants to sing at Branner and
everyone wants to hit the big freshman
dorms. You want to have the best placement
in the Orientation show — when they're not
too sick of a cappella but they really want to
see another group. And if someone beats you
to it, or if they have connections...
Geraldine: The thing is, it's just a cappella.
Ritu: Yeah, it really is. You can grow so much
from it, you can learn a lot, you can do a lot
with it, but 1 think sometimes it gets to be a
battle.
John: It's very easy to lose focus on why you're
doing a cappella. I'm very musically intense
and I want to get the music perfect. But 1
think we eventually come back to the base of
it, which is to sing and have fun.
Christine: Just as long as we're better than
Cal.
Ritu: There is a stereotype we face from
group identities. It's "not as cool" to be in an
all-women's group as it is to be in an all-male
group, plus the stereotypes about lesbians
and radical feminists, or whatever. But I feel
like we have a bond that can only come from
being in an all-female group. I'm not saying
there's not any sexual tension between mem
bers, but generally it's cut way down.
What about personality conflicts?

'You can grow so
much from it, you
can learn a lot, you
can do a lot with it,
but I think
sometimes it gets
to be a battle.'
— Ritu Kapur,
Counterpoint
Geraldine: During auditions we try to take
things like personality and attitude into ac
count, although people always turn out dif
ferent than you think. If there is a personality
conflict, 1 don't think there's much you can
do hut try to work it out as best as you can.
You can't kick them out of the group just he
cause you don't like them.
Christine: It's funny; sometimes you'll have
all these different personalities and then

you'll sing and it's all good.
So what's the best and worst thing about a cap
pella?
Geraldine: We had a dorm show a while ago
and afterward they called us back three times,
and people left our meeting bouncing oft the
walls. People in the dorm said, "We should
invite them back and put up a barricade so
they can't leave." Some people do appreciate
a cappella and when they express their appre
ciation it makes you feel so good because it's
something you've striven for. It's that magic
feeling you get from any kind of performance
art.
John: The best part for me is the audience, es
pecially if they're into it. Performing is great.
And the worst part about a cappella?
Ritu: Time suck.
Christine: I don't think people know how
much time goes into it, not lust rehearsals but
group e-mails, making fliers, Xeroxing . . .
John: I saw Carl at Kinko's right before this.
Christine: But we put that kind of time in be
cause it's worth it. Rascially, we all love to sing
and perform and we're willing to do what it
takes to be the best.
