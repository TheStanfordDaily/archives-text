## Don't Cry For Me, Madonna With the 'Evita' soundtrack, the controversial singer defies her critics 
### 
In a Hollywood that thrives on contro
versy and mayhem, shocking precedents
are always welcome. Yet it seems that few in
showbiz have the savvy to deal with the on
coming cinematic juggernaut known as
"Evita," scheduled to hit the big screen in
late December. A recreation of the 1979
Tim Smith-Andrew Lloyd Webber Broad
way musical smash by the same name, the
new motion picture has initiated yet anoth
er worldwide Evita obsession.
Predating the movie's arrival is "Evita:
The Complete Motion Picture Sound
track," (Warner Bros.) a double CD set
featuring quite a varied collection of per
sonalities. Easily the most controversial
member of this cast is none other than
Madonna, the modern incarnation of late
Argentinian demigoddess Eva Peron. And
comfortably carrying the role of populist
leader Juan Peron is the stately Jonathan
Pryce ("Carrington," "Miss Saigon"),
while the soundtrack is narrated by Span
ish hunk Antonio Banderas ("Desperado,"
"Mambo Kings").
The question that looms over Madonna's
career is whether a successful pop singer can
carry such a demanding operatic role. The
role of Eva is certainly challenging, and the
news of Madonna's appointment to the task
was met with controversy.
Born in 1919 in a minuscule town on the
edge of the Argentine Pampas, Eva came to
be the center of an intense and mystical
adoration by the country's commoners.
1 lcr rise to stardom, starting with a success-

ful radio and film ca
reer and culminating in
her election to vice
president alongside her
husband Juan Peron,
has become an integral
part of the modern Ar
gentina.
Madonna's "Evita,"
in all fairness, is a much
different role than what
we have seen in the
past, and Madonna
shows fabulous vocal
maturity and sensitivi
ty.
As for Banderas, a
rich Spanish accent
may go a long way.
Banderas solidly car
ries the vocal role of
narrator Che and cer
tainly has the charisma
that makes for a Holly
wood actor extraordi
naire. What cannot be
easily predicted is how
such an adored symbol
of sensitive machismo
will interact with the
sexy and often domi
nating Madonna in the
movie.

With the inclusion of Jonathan Pryce,
"Evita: The Complete Motion Picture
Soundtrack" seems to be a precursor to a
grand Hollywood chemistry experiment. A
vial containing the elements of pop-super
stardom, Spanish testosterone and theatri

cal genius is yet to be tested by modern
movie audiences.
Pryce is rich in his personification of Juan
Peron and seems to anchor the cast's wildly
divergent performance experiences. On
"She is a Diamond," Pryce reflects on how
valuable Eva is to the people of Argentina:
"She's a diamond in their dull eray lives...

and when you think about it, can you recall /
The last time they loved anyone at all?"
The front-running song to emerge from
the "Evita" soundtrack is "You Must Love
Me," an emotional declaration of love to
ward luan Per6n. "You Must Love Me" is al
most overwhelming emotionally, and Web
ber has certainly created a daunting chal
lenge for the singer. Yet Madonna proves her
ability to carry the weight of the moment.
Most impressive is the sense of contrast
and the depth of passion that the duo ol
Pryce and Madonna carry. The gamut of
feelings in the Heron relationship as well as
what it meant to Argentina, is handled
with keen awareness.
Webber's sense of contrast is on display
once again with the new Hollywood cast.
"I'd Be Surprisingly Good l or You" is the
playful duet between two green and spry
lovers; "Your Little Body's Breaking Down"
is Pryce's woeful observation of a woman
in despair after .1 hard relationship. "A New
Argentina" is a zealous parade of Argentine
nationalism; "The Actress Hasn't Learned
the Lines (You'd Like to Hear)" is a dark re
flection of the hypocrisy that may have
laced Pcronism.
Previews of the movie "Evita" reveal a
vision by director Alan Parker that seems
to gel with Webber's musical collage.
Sweeping scenes of dark rolling tanks, posh
upper-crust tango gatherings and impas
sioned Argentinian mobs taking over the
streets await the patient moviegoer. Such a
production is daring, and so far, its per
formers are meeting the challenge with
utter aplomb.
