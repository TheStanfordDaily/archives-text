# WESTSIDE CONNECTION
## "Bow Down" 
### 
Gangsta rap is drowning and Westside
Connection's "Bow Down" (Priority
Records) is not a life raft.
It wasn't that long ago that gangsta rap
used to be a major force because of its brutal
depictions of ghetto reality. We could feel the
rage in Ice (lube's voice when he yelled, "Fuck
the police," and we knew that NWA and Ice-
T were reflecting a violent American subcul
ture.
Now things have changed. Dr. Dre and
Snoop Dogg are letting go of the image, and
Ice Cube is regressing into his. Here he teams
up with Mach-10 and WC to create "Westside
Connection," a group of gangstas who— ac
cording to their introduction, "World Dom
ination" — are causing "a threat to our way
of living, a threat to society, and maybe even
a threat to our existence." Uh, not really.

The first track also suggests renaming
"Mt. Rushmore" to "Mt. Westmore" and re
placing the forefathers with themselves. The
CD's liner notes have about 20, yes 20, pic
tures of Ice Cube, Mach-10 and WC making
the übiquitous "W" sign with their hands,
symbolizing "Westside." All of this is just silly.
Ice Cube used to be hip-hop's spark plug,
a young, angry, black man who truly meant it
when he said he was"the nigga you can't fuck
with." His lyrics on 1991 's "Death Certifi
cate," while decidedly un-PC, stirred power
ful images and even fear among listeners.
Cube's albums used to reflect our violent so
ciety, but this album is just pointless drivel.
OK, some of the beats are tight, and there
are some good singles, especially "Gangstas
Make the World Go Round" and"The
Gangsta, the Killa and the Dope Dealer," but
the lyrics are so uninspired and boring that
we lose interest. Guns, mayhem, dissing the
East Coast, misogyny, etc. All the regular
themes are used with little creativity.
At one point, Ice Cube raps, "Gangbangin'
will never die, there's too much love." Too
much love? I really feel the love when WC.
rants later, "Homicidal in the G ride /1 swear
I'm killing every nigga standing outside / let

ting 'em have it with my double barreled
sawed off."
The real problem with this album is that
its release is so poorly timed. Tupac was
killed, Eazy-E is dead and everyone is trying
to jump off the "gangsta" bandwagon. Plus,
while Westside Connection is trying to create
a universal "Westside" where everyone will
bow down to them, bicoastal rappers like B-
Real, Nas, Dr. Dre and the Wu-Tang clan are
trying to consolidate the East and West
coasts. But even without the bad timing, this
album would suck.
