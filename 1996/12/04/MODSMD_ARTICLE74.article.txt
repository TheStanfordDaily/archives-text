# BLIND MELON
## "Nico" 
### 
Not every rock n' roll death creates a leg
end.
A little more than a year ago, Blind
Melon's lead singer, Shannon Hoon, died of a
cocaine overdose. Although the group had
already lost the popularity it had gained from
its hit single, "No Rain," Hoon s death should
have sparked a final, morbid interest in the
group. Instead, his death became all the more
pathetic as it passed virtually unnoticed.
1 he question, of course, is whether Blind
Melon was a one-hit wonder or a promising
band cut down in its youth. With "Nico,"
(Capitol Records) a collection ot outtakes
from various recording sessions over their ca
reer, the group tries to answer this question.
Unfortunately, the result is simply more con
fusion.
On tracks like "Soup" and "Soul One,"
Hoon's vocals succeed in creating the dirty
grandeur which propelled "No Rain." In

deed, a semi-acoustic version of that song is
also included, one which makes up in emo
tion what it lacks in instrumentation.
However, on faster tracks, such as "Hell"
and "John Sinclair," the bands squanders
some great material with sloppy playing. Fur
thermore, on "All That I Need," which is sim
ply Hoon and his guitar, he even loses control
of a fairly simple ballad.
Ultimately, the format of the album drags
it down. A seemingly random assortment of
leftovers from four years of recording, "Nico'
is uneven and unsettling. The album is essen
tially too fragmented to fit together.
Still, with a few gems like "Glitch," an
imaginative track which mixes unusual in
strumentation with a hypnotic beat, the
album suggests that Blind Melon may have
had more to give to the world.
Thus, the essential value of "Nico' is the
emotional power it generates from Hoon's
death. Named for his daughter, the album
carries the weight of the unknown.
Perhaps the most poignant moment is the
final track, "Letters From A Porcupine,
which was literally recorded bv Hoon on gui
tarist Christopher Thorns answering ma
chine. While the song itself is unremarkable,
Hoon sings with admirable conviction. How
ever, the song is awkwardly cut short with a
beep by Thorn s answering machine, a pow
ertul metaphor for Blind Melon's career.
Death doesn't always create a legend, but it
always leaves silence.
