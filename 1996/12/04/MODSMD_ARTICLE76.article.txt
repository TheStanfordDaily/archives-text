# GUEST REVIEW
## The
						Democratic Party, The Republican Party and 'Party of Five' Consummate politician Bill Shen shares his musical taste 
### 
Bill Shen, Stanford junior and ASSU presi
dent, takes time out from his busy schedule to
address something that really matters: the CD
from the Fox television drama "Party of Five."

A review of the new CD
from "Party of Five"
(Reprise Records)? Hmm,
I haven't had an assign
ment this easy since CIV.
Hey, it's my favorite TV
show — it's easy, right?
Too easy. 1 can sum it up in
two words characters —

uninspired disappointment.
"Party of Five" the show is quite possibly
the finest drama on television. "Party of
Five" the CD is quite possibly the worst col
lection of whiny love songs on the planet. If
you're a dedicated Pos fan, you'll recognize
the songs, as most have played softly in the
background of recent episodes. With this
release, they make their solo debut and,
sadly, fall flat on their face without Bailey,
lulia and the rest of the gang. The songs are

just show accessories,
props and extras.
Three and a half
songs on the Pos collec
tion are worth listening
to. "Closer to Free" by
the Bodeans probably
doesn't count because
it's the show's theme

song (their other song, "Heart of a Mira
cle," is a formula alterna-song), but I'll
award it sympathy points.
The refreshingly upbeat single "Send Me
on My Way" by Rusted Root feels out of
place among an assortment which includes
Syd Straw telling us that we get her down. In
her single, titled "People of Earth," she's
angry because some guy stole her parking
space, and she thinks that someone else
wants to steal her sneakers. Huh?
I'm still trying to figure out if I like "Sun
shine Superman" by Rickie Lee Jones be
cause of her adorable voice or the infectious
tune. Oh yeah, and the half of a song that is
almost respectable? Stevie Nicks' sterile
cover of Tom Petty's "Free Fallin' " was cool
until I realized that I just liked the original.
The jazzy "Cruel Spell" single by Big Bad

Voodoo Daddy (the only thing worse than
their music is the band's name) reeks of a
cheap blues knockoff. Joe Jackson's
"Stranger than Fiction" shows that anyone
can make it in the music biz. And there are
no fewer than six songs which 1 still can't
tell apart, all of which share an astounding
cheese factor.
And when you thought it couldn't get
any worse? The queen of tortured souls,
Tori Amos, is featured on a New Order/Era
sure-esque single by BT called "Blue Skies."
Someone should give her work as a mime.
But hey, it's not all bad. The liner notes
have sort of cute pictures of Jennifer Love
Hewitt. And while the CD isn't worth pay
ing full retail price for, you'll soon be able to
find it in the bargain section of your favorite
music store.
