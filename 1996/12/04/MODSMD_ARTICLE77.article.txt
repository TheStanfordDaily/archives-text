problematic work naught with structural
Haws. Traditionally designated as a required
piece for the Tchaikovsky Competition, the
work has few champions beside Sviatoslav
Richter. Kuerti tackles the enormous sonata
with grace and aplomb, seeking to bring out
the lyrical side and subdue the clanky and
often bombastic rhetoric Tchaikovsky
penned. Kuerti's unhurried tempo effectively
eschews the pomposity of the piece without
reducing its grandeur. The fluidity of execu
tion in the Finale is remarkable, outwitting
even Richter's authoritative version.
Kuerti's Scriabin, however, falls short of a
blinding intensity and a mysticism necessary
to capture the essence of the music. The
I ourth Sonata is delivered perhaps a bit too
leisurely to bring off the drastic contrast be
tween the mystic opening and the heaven
storming coda in octaves marked prestissimo
volando. T he preludes and etudes fare much
better in Kuerti's hands, filled with more nu
anced tonal phrasings and heat.
Perhaps the most curious items on the
album are Liadov's pieces and Glazunov's
charming "Grand Concert Waltz." The selec
tion of various Liadov pieces reflects a highly
Chopinesque influence both in harmonic
language and structural outlay, even more so
than the early Scriabin works. Kuerti's Vien
nese instinct comes to the fore in the
Glazunov, where Kuerti shapes the elegant
waltz with grace and bravura.
For a truly volcanic and untoppable rendi
tion of the Scriabin Forth, one must turn to
Igor Zhukov on Melodia. As for the
Tchaikovsky Sonata, Richter's recording on
BMG remains a formidable yardstick. Kuerti
certainly deserves credit for reviving some of
the neglected gems in the Russian repertoire
as well as for sampling a varied program that
is enjoyable throughout.

Pumpkins guitarist James lha plays on three
songs, Pumpkins bassist D'arcy sings on two
songs, most tracks were recorded in either
I has or D'arcy's studios, and both co-pro
duced the majority of the album.
"Shells" is the best song on the album, be
ginning with a quick tempo guitar and intro
ducing each instrument progressively. It re
minds me of the classic Ohio Players song
"Rollercoaster."
"Pretty Light Destruction" and "Trust
Flushed With Colors" are also among the
best songs on the album; the vocals, strings
and percussion all flow together. "Silver" and
the untitled final song, a contemporary rap
session, are quality tracks. Unfortunately,
"Pretty Fight Destruction" wasn't even writ
ten by the band.
Fulflej lyrics are listener-friendly. On "Mi
crowave," G sings, "They say that technology's
gone tot) far, / but I don't even have a damn
VCR, /1 don't watch movies on my TV, / what
ever comes on is what 1 see /... I'll own all you
motherfuckers." The song hints at reflecting
upon materialism. Some of the other wack-ass
songs refer to the balance of the universe, a
santa that kills all of his elves (ho ho ho), coal
colored turtles and soul enhancement.
Instrumental on "Wack-Ass Tuba Riff"
are relatively solid. G is a fairly standard gui
tar player, Maff-Yoo Nilsun's drums carry a
lot of the songs on the album and Augi Fill-

Ups is a decent bass player— for the most
part he just stays out of the way.
Fulflej is adequate but not much more; I can
imagine seeing them opening for a larger act,
but I wouldn't go to see them for themselves.
