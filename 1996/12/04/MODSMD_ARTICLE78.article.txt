# VARIOUS ARTISTS
## "Soul Motion" 
### 
If you want some music to go with your
brown polyester pantsuit, you might want to
check out OM Records' compilation of "the
latest Urban Soul from across America and
the U.K., mixed with smooth classics from
the past."
Liner quote translated, that means music
from artists Jhelisa, Repercussions, Hueman
Flavor, Mo'Fessionals, ST&P, Tower of Power,
Dee C Lee from the United Kingdom and
Curtis Mayfield of "Super Fly" fame — all re
ally mellow stuff, good for 70s parties or for
relaxing on the couch while grooving your
neck to the beat.
Many carry the tune with a twangy guitar,
funky synthesizer noises and men singing in
falsetto. Jhelisa's "Death of a Soul Diva," Dee
C Lee's "Things Will Be Sweeter" and Hue

man Flavor's "As I Reach" bring us closer to
the current music scene with their heavier
heat and throatier voices.
Disc two will definitely bring you hack to
the present. A CD-ROM, it serves up a hip
multimedia collage of music videos, inter
views, movie trailers and magazine articles,
complete with colorful little icons that flash
and spin when you pass over them. It's kind
of the main attraction.
It features two full-length music videos
from Ihelisa and Dee C Lee, video interviews
with musical artists, photos, articles from
URB Ultra Magazine and clips from "Super
Fly." The music videos look really good, and
you can move forward or back through them
by using your mouse. The screens are well
organized, too, which makes them fun to ex
plore and easy to decipher.
Of course, that's assuming that you have
the equipment to run the CD-ROM: a Mac
intosh system 7 or Windows 3.1, at least.
Color is good, eight megabytes of RAM is
necessary and don't forget a pair of speakers
or headphones. If you have all that, every
thing should run reasonably fast.
Overall, OM Records puts on a good mul
timedia show that's enjoyable to listen to and
even better to watch, l or hard-core '70s fans,
it may not be enough, but for casual follow
ers of pop culture, it's not a bad sampler.
