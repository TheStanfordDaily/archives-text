## Gay marriage OK'd Hawaii judge makes legal precedent 
### 
HONOLULU (AP) - A judge
barred Hawaii from denying mar
riage licenses to gay couples yester
day in a case that has already led
Congress to allow other states to
refuse to recognize such unions.
The ruling is certain to be
appealed.
Kirk Cashmere, an attorney for
three homosexual couples who
sued the state, said Circuit Judge
Kevin Chang "in a nutshell ruled
that the sex-based classification in
the state's marriage law is uncon
stitutional."
Chang said the state failed to
show any compelling state interest
to deny gay and lesbian couples the
right to marry, Cashmere said.
A spokeswoman for the conser
vative Family Research Council
said the ruling defies the wishes of
the majority: Polls say 70 percent
of Hawaii's residents oppose same
sex marriages.
"This ruling is a slap in the face
of the Hawaiian people who have
made it clear that they don't want
liberal judges tampering with soci
ety's foundational institutions,"
Kristi Stone Hamrick said.
Two gay men and two lesbian
couples sued in 1991 for the right
to marry, to the dismay of some
national gay rights organizations
that felt the move was premature
and would provoke a backlash.
It certainly prompted furious
debate. In the state legislature,
lawmakers failed to agree this year
on either a proposed constitutional
amendment to ban them or domes
tic partnership legislation giving

gay and lesbian couples many of
the legal and financial benefits of
married couples.
Congress, meanwhile, approved
a law President Clinton signed in
September, saying the federal gov
ernment will not recognize gay
marriages and allowing states to
refuse to recognize such marriages
licensed in other states.
An appeal of Chang's ruling
would send the case back to the
Hawaii Supreme Court, which
ruled in 1993 that denial of mar
riage licenses to same-sex couples
amounted to gender discrimina
tion under the state constitution's
Equal Rights Amendment.
The state Supreme Court sent
the case back to a lower court to
give the state a chance to show a
compelling public interest in allow
ing such discrimination.
In a two-week trial in Septem
ber, Deputy State Attorney Gener
al Rick Eichor argued that
Hawaii's marriage law is intended
to promote the best environment
for the rearing of children.
He said children thrive best
when raised by biological parents;
and contended that legalizing
same-sex marriages would open
the door to demands that bigamy,
polygamy and consensual incestu
ous relationships be licensed as
well.
Both sides presented testimony
from a parade of expert witnesses
on family and child development,
who gave conflicting opinions on
whether gay couples could provide
an equally nurturing environment.
