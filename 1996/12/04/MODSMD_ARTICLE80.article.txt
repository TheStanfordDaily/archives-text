## Groove Collective reflect on collective jams 
### Seeta Gangadharan 
The idea of the collective jam surfaced
early in jazz history — sometime in the '20s
when New Orleans and Dixieland styles were
the public flavor. Typically five people strong,
a combo of cornet, clarinet, trombone, banjo
(or piano) and drums (or a block of wood, in
the case of recorded stuff) would engage in
what could be considered nothing less than
an instrumental ensemble.
Each player cultivated a favored flavor
more or less based on the character of his in
strument. Up front, the cornet announced
the groups with an embellished beginning
and then literally got down to brass tacks, im
provising a lead melody. The clai met, an ob
viously lighter and smaller reed instrument,
assumed the responsibility of crowd-pleaser,
playing a trilly, fancy counter melody, while
the trombone stayed true to its dopish per
sonality and laid out a more viscous melody.
In the meantime or "out back," the banjo
or piano and drums percussed and managed
the rhythm section. Together, these five in
struments defined a collective jam primarily
as a melodic enterprise.
Seventy-five years later, the comparison
between collective jam style ot the 20s and
contemporary artists Groove Collective
seems a far stretch, or worse yet, blandly ob
vious. d 'h . . . they're different?) However
there's something compelling about tiC's
modernized concept of collective jam. GC
has moved from the clinical approach to an
oilier approach to musical coordination,
bringing with it a relaxed but moving 10-per
son party.
With GC, the collective jam extends be
yond the scope of the instrumental and en
compasses the social. Improv does not just
imply what your instrument can do (e.g., in
strument role-playing). Rather, for GC, it
means having an organic approach to perfor
mance.
Simply put, GC is notorious for that type
of improvisation sometimes referred to as

live rehearsal. Starting up and messing up
and having to start up again, they don't mind
an audience whose movement is interrupted
(nor does the audience appear to mind).
While this practice collides with the tradi
tional formats of jazz, GC proceeds without
too much stress.
In the six years the original 10 band mem
bers have consistently performed in New
York City, theii stage has been public. Walk
on, walk off, show up, don't show up — these
have been the standards. Nappy 'G' (Gordon
Clay), the percussionist and timbale player,
described this practice by saying, "We used to
take three heads at the go sometimes."
Since G( moved to the Impulse record
label, music enthusiasts (a.k.a. snobs) have
attempted to qualify GC as unctuous musi
cians whose performance skills correspond
with the immature dancing groove-heads to
be found crowding GC club spots.
However, the band resists this definition:
"We were just a band ... better than most
people expected. Ami then we got noticed,"
said Richard Worth, flutist. "The conse
quence was we had to be a little more profes
sional — people are paying more money to
get in. Gotta put on a show.
"Responsibility of being hooked up with a
big label like Impulse has changed our dy
namic," Worth added.
but the change is no one's brainchild or
deliberate attempt to "legitimize" the Groove
Collective outfit. According to former man
ager of C iC and current president of the Giant
Step production company, Morris Bernstein,
"It's nobody's master plan. Groove Collective
was signed to Warner Brothers while I was
their manager. Then, 1 got a record deal with
GRP who owns Blue Thumb and Impulse.
Groove Collective insisted being on Impulse
because of the jazz history."
Of these two labels, Impulse has gotten
more play and more props from the music
public. A "free thinking jazz label that came
around in the early '60s with the likes of
Coltraneand Pharoah Sanders," in the words

of Bernstein, Impulse eclipsed the more
eclectic Blue Thumb which housed artists
like Ike and Tina Turner, the l ost Poets and
the Pointer Sisters and eventually folded in
the late '70s.
When revived by GRP, "Groove Collective
was being pushed to the Blue Thumb because
of its eclectic side, but the band didn't want to
go there," Bernstein said. "Maybe in retro
spect they're not jazz in traditional stan
dards."
Worth mentioned the band's problematic
preference for Impulse: "I remember listen

ing to 'Trane records in (Worth's native)
Scotland and being blown away. Impulse was
putting out the sharpest and newest stuff.
"We love being connected with the histo
ry," said Worth. "But the problem with having
that jazz classification is a lot of people think
we're 'new jazz,' whatever that is." Too far re
moved from the classic jazz stuff, and thus not
consonant with the more established jazz
radio stations and too intimidating-sounding
to the dance-rooted, pop radio venues,
Groove Collective gets less exposure than
their robust home-following would indicate.
