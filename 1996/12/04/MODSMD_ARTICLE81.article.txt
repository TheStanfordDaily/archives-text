## Desert Hearts Fiennes' 'Patient' checks in for Oscar consideration 
### 
"The English Patient" is a brilliant epic
about maps, love, ownership and the
suprasternal notch. It's set before and during
World War II in both North Africa and Italy.
Ralph Fiennes plays Count Laszlo de Almasy,
a burn patient suffering from amnesia whose
only possession is a copy of Herodotus with
mementos stashed in it. Juliette Binoche's
charming Hana cares for him. Willem Pafoe,
Naveen Andrews and Kristin Scott Thomas
round out the cast.
The film is composed of a series ol flash
backs that in the end reveal Almasy's life
story. Fiennes' performance as Almasy
should earn him a Oscar nomination. His
trademark steely cold stares and stiff-jaw ex
pressions tantalize the audience. What's be
hind the mask? Don't expect to figure it out.
Fiennes is in control of every subtle disclo
sure of emotion.
Fiennes' performance adds to the excel
lence of the film. However, the movie itself is
magnificently crafted. Visuals are presented
that mean nothing at the time of introduc
tion, such asa paintbrush painting during the
opening credits. Yet by the end of the film

every element is integrated flawlessly.
Director Anthony Minghella juxtaposes
scenes that contrast the characters' different
worlds. While Almasy and Katharine Clifton
(Thomas) make love in an enclave, Minghel
la crosscuts between their passion and a ban
quet of soldiers singing "Silent Night." He has
an eye for detail that is not wasted here.
Thomas' Clifton argues with the count in
the beginning about the importance of adjec
tives. He doesn't need them. He argues that a
car is a car if it's new, old or broken. Clifton,
however, poses the word "love' to him and
argues that there isa critical difference among
platonic, romantic and obsessive love. Ironi
cally, it's the adjectives that Almasy so de
plores that alter his destiny. Is he English,
German, Hungarian or Indian? Though it
matters little to him, the world judges him for
being one rather than the other.
Though this is a spectacular, emotionally
draining love story and reflection upon own
ership and division, it's not for everyone. In
all fairness, it's an intense and long movie
two hours, 39 minutes to be exact. Fiennes
makes it worth your while. Yet you might try
bringing one of those sheet cushions hard
core fans sit on at football games.
