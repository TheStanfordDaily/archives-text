# The
						Truth about Acts and Dogs
## Actors in live-action 'Dalmatians' not as captivating as original toons 
### 
Cartoon Classics 101 — for dreamers only.
Watch, examine and discuss the essence oj
make-believe in modern day animated fea
tures. Works include "The Little Mermaid,"
"The Lion King" and "101 Dalmatians" ...
wait, scratch that last one. Disney's new "101
Dalmatians" is not a cartoon and certainly
not a classic. Has the "happiest company on
Earth" destroyed the world of make-believe
by turning this cartoon classic into a live-ac
tion film?
While the idea of redoing this family fa
vorite may seem promising, the actual rendi
tion lacks the magic of a true Disney great. Re
placing the animation with real-life people and
places undermines the vitality of" 101 Dalma
tians." The all-too-real surroundings put limits
on the make-believe and the actors just aren't
as captivating as the unpredictable toons.
The film tries to make up for these limita
tions with flamboyant costumes and goofy
dialogue, but having live players is just too re
strictive to make this fantasy work. The time
less adventure becomes strangled by produc
er John Hughes' attempt to bring reality to
toontown. The result is a relatively slow and

unexciting picture.
"You can do so much
more with live action than
with animation," boasts
Hughes, who also produced
"Sixteen Candles" and
"Home Alone," but his
statement doesn't apply to
"101 Dalmatians." The only
thing more this endeavor al
lows for is an opportunity
for Disney to create a cash
cow. Hughes and company
succeed all right, but not
without insulting the origi
nal true animated genius.

There is no real need for character devel
opment in a cartoon, and as a result, these ac
tors are forced to either overact or simply de
liver their lines. Glenn Close, who plays the
crazed Cruella De Vil, attempts to mirror her
cartoon counterpart. In doing so, she sets
herself apart from the rest of the film.
Her condescending performance makes
Roger (Jeff Daniels) and Anita (Joely
Richardson) seem boring and two-dimen
sional. Perhaps her dominance is merely di
rector Stephen Herek's attempt to showcase
the film's biggest star. While it does turn the

spotlight on Close, it ruins the dynamic of the
cast and reveals the movie's unstable premise.
Face it, Glenn — no matter how hard you act,
you can never actually become a cartoon.
One interesting aspect of the film, howev
er, is the way the creators modernize it. In
stead of writing music, Roger produces video
games on his trusty PC. With the help of
Pongo, the lead canine (who also has his own
computer), he creates a winning game with
Cruella as the villain, and in true fairy-tale
tradition, the couple will now make a ton of
cash and live happily ever after. Though the

producers stick to the original fantasy end
ing (in the animated version, Cruella is the
inspiration for one of Roger's songs) the film
now caters directly to a present-day audi
ence.
If you're dying to see what all the hype is
about or you have an unconditional love for
Disney's creations, go see the flick; just don't
expect to be dazzled. Although the flashy
decor and rich scenery provide for a mildly
entertaining experience, this movie is clearly
written to be drawn, not cast.
