Over Thanksgiving, while you were being spoon-fed pumpkin pie by
your mother and frolicking on the living room rug with your golden re
triever, I was up in Davis with my sister We went to see "The Mirror
Has Two Faces"— you know, that one about Barbra Streisand feeling
ugly and unlovable When the movie got out, it was after 9, and we still
hadn't eaten dinner, and the only place open in the entire town was
Lyon's, and my sister wouldn't go because she said the combination
of "The Mirror Has Two Faces" and Lyon's was too pathetic. So in
stead we went to a gas station, and I bought Reduced Fat Nacho
Cheesier Doritos. Then we went back to her house, which has no heat,
and her room, which, as a matter of fact, has no furniture There was
nothing to do but crawl under the covers and argue about who should
get up and lock the front door. In retrospect, I don't think there was
much danger of intruders since, from all appearances, we were the
only people alive in all of Davis. Nonetheless, I am thankful for my sis
ter I don't care what you're thankful for, but feel free to share your New
Year's resolutions by sending classifieds to intermission ©daily.

Dearest P: Were my luscious cos
metics and nouveau riche de- j

le. My pre-pubescent heart twitters
with grief (or is that your pre-pu
bescent heart I 'm thinking of?) I re

each other at the club awkward. —

Heather: Thanks for the ride. I can't
imagine four nicer people to be
stuck in San Francisco rush hour
traffic with.
Robin dreamed she was in Hawaii
with Stoner.
OK. All right. I admit it already.

You arc higher maintenance — and
well worth it.
, Sometimes I think about how I'd
like to cut loose and he really offen
sive and then I realize, hey, wait, I'm

I miss those 2 inches I cut off. I feel
so impotent and incomplete. I
shan't cut my hair again.
Like hell that alcohol was free. Fay |
up, Daily.
Cincinnatus and Mother Daily:
You know you love each other.
Admit it already.
Have a great time in Paris, Mike. I'll

miss you.
Kiss mc, I'm ASSU president.
Oh, no, wait, don't kiss me, 1 have
touch phobias.
A month! A month, Carolyn! A
month!
SWF seeks SM (race unimportant)
to slip me the tongue and distract
me from my inner pain. I'm ugly
and depressed, but I'm so nice once
you get to know me.
What the hell are cagers?
Of course you've smoked pot. You
live in Synergy.
What iflen never calls?
I don't harp obsessively on a single

Ariana, Hope you weren't trauma
tized by our alleged "party." And
don't worry about writing neuroses
(hell, don't worry about any neu
roses) — you're not alone.
I miss Pickles! hee hee hee

Conan O'Brien excites animal
urges in me.
So does Zak. It's the whole tall, red
haired, ironic persona they both
have going. (Sorry, but it was only a
matter of time.)
Thanks, F and E. You brought me
to a new dimension.
You're almost there, Beth.
MWAH!
Rob H. is the most charming white
trash I've ever met.
Sam, Being downtrodden together
is strangely comforting. I foresee
many haircuts in your future (of the
euphemistic, I-don't-know-what
a-haircut-feels-like sort). Anyone
who puts so much thought into
even their socks deserves all good ]
things.
Prank: Time is of the essence. I'm
still waiting.

wanted different things at the same

Quit looking at me.
The big mistake is assuming you're
not fundamentally alone.

Phoenix to confess my lust and love
and they said, "It's OK, I sort of
knew, you're my best friend," I
would leap onto the nearest tracks.
And I'd probably pull them with
me.
Let's all get in a room and pretend
we're writers and make funny nois
es.
See you soon, baboon. 19 and
counting.:)
To whoever said 1 am smart, funny
and pretty: If you don't ask, you'll
never know. Also, FYI, it's "smart,
funny and good-looking."
Jo, If you go to Chicago, I'll be des
titute. If you stay, I'll even go shop
ping at Warner's and indulge you
while you try on linoleum shoes
and spray yourself with cheesy per
fume.
I have to stop trying to disguise mv
horniness as artistiv torment.
Dear Beth: We're shocked! — Mrs.

The light shining off Elizabeth s
hair is like stars on a desert plane
with glittering ice on top. Or some

Sorry for everything.

Jesse don't get shit.

hair, blue backpack. Me: wire glass
es, sits near the door. I stare obses
sively at the back of your head and
live for your insightful commentary
on 19th century race relations, but I
just don't know how to introduce
myself. My grade is suffering, and
the prospect of winter break is giv
ing me hives. I'm scared that I'm
going to lose control, hurdle over
the seat and jump into your lap —
please spare us both the embarrass
ment and just ask me out.
Hut the real question is. Did she in

Roble Hall — especially —

Casper: You're cute. Love, Xanadu
H, You can be my roommate any
