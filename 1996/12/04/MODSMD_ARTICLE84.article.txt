Miles From Home
Your music reviewers are
morons. Fire 'em. In October's
"Our Picks," it's written, "An
audiophile's dream come true, this
six-CD set rocks a jazz-lover's world
with Davis' smooth sax solos
and...." It would be news to me and
to him if Miles Davis played the
saxophone.
Paul Brown, graduate student,
U. of California, Berkeley
Thanks to Paul and the bazillion
other jazz lovers out there who blew
the horn on our faux pas. Davis
played the trumpet. It was a big mis
take that should have been caught,
and those responsible will be severely
tortured in ways too gruesome to be
described. —Ed

Kudos
I (I) ink your
magazine is great. It's
always nice to get it
with the school paper
and read about inter
esting things going
on at other campus
es. The October issue
had some very inter
esting. funny tidbits.
I enjoyed at le.tsi
seven of those
Quickies, among the
other into in the
magazine, like the
Buz/, and Bits and
Bytes and so on.
Very cool stuff!

The cover story
"Most Likely to
Succeed: The Clin
ton and Dole Col
lege Years" [Oct.
1996) was unbeliev
ably slanted towards
the liberals. The

article attracted my attention because 1
wanted to know the facts behind their
college years, not an editorial biased
toward Democrats. The two "pull
quotes" and the Hillary/Elizabeth com
parisons are prime examples of the
obvious slant in political view. If some
one is out to slam Republicans, do it in
an editorial, not a cover story.
Chris Wu, junior, U. of Texas, Austin
You forgot one important detail
in Bill Clinton's "The Boring Stuff'
box. He helped pass the largest tax
increase in U.S. history in 1993. I
think this 112 a c t should have been
noted for a fair portrayal of him.
Remember that he can propose any
thing he wants to get elected. It does
n't mean he'll do it.

Teed Off About TAs
Your article "The Trouble with 1 As"
[Oct. 1996) had a very good point. Col
lege students are being taught by people
with no training to teach. However, it
does not apply just to 1 As. What makes
you think that faculty members have
been trained to teach? It's likely that
your second-grade teacher had more
education training than your last bio
chemistry professor.
M. W. Murray, doctoral student.
New Mexico State U.
As a fifth-semester junior, 1 have
had many TAs who were just as good
as the professors. In fact, the TA for
one of my theory classes is a bit more
open-minded than the professor for
my other theory class. The TA allows
us to voice our opinions, and he gives
us feedback.
Darcia Scales, junior, Venn State I/.
Mixed grades for your story " The
Trouble With TAs." I think your arti
cle should be commended for helping
to publicize the fact that grad students
are generally not given very much (if
any) training. But the sad truth is that
"substandard" teaching takes place just
as often, if not more often, with pro
fessors at the head of the class as with
TAs. Instead of talking about "under
qualified" TAs, we should be talking
about under trained TAs and start
rewarding excellence in teaching —
both monetarily and with respect — as
much as in research. Then college stu
dents would get the high-quality
teaching they deserve (and pay an arm
and a leg for).

I appreciated the somewhat sim

films [" Noth in' but an O. (1.

have a problem with the complete
exclusion of the work of Melvin Van
Peebles, the man who practically
invented the genre. As for the top
10 "Black List,"

whose idea was
it (o include
"Slaughter,
"Cleopatra /ones "
and "I'm Gonna

You've got to be

The article on Bill Clinton and Bob

well-balanced and thorough. I tip my hat
to U, Frances I lufhnan and the rest of the
11. staff. As the editorial director of a mag

to whom I can imagine making this initial
proposal: since "U" is now an optional,
alternative spelling for "you" in the Ran
dom I louse dictionaries, since "U is a hip
spelling, and since "U" is in keeping with
11, consider spelling it that way in future
issues. Yes, it's something of a crazy sugges

not that crazy after all I"he spelling of con
tracctions (U're, I' 11, U'vc, U'd) is a sim
ple matter and is being done in various
other quarters. Otherwise, I can't think of
any logistical obstacles. Thank U.

Miles From Home
Your music reviewers are
morons. Fire 'em. In October's
"Our Picks," it's written, "An
audiophile's dream come true, this
six-CD set rocks a jazz-lover's world
with Davis' smooth sax solos
and...." It would be news to me and
to him if Miles Davis played the
saxophone.
Paul Brown, graduate student,
U. of California, Berkeley
Thanks to Paul and the bazillion
other jazz lovers out there who blew
the horn on our faux pas. Davis
played the trumpet. It was a big mis
take that should have been caught,
and those responsible will be severely
tortured in ways too gruesome to be
described. —Ed

Kudos
I (I) ink your
magazine is great. It's
always nice to get it
with the school paper
and read about inter
esting things going
on at other campus
es. The October issue
had some very inter
esting. funny tidbits.
I enjoyed at le.tsi
seven of those
Quickies, among the
other into in the
magazine, like the
Buz/, and Bits and
Bytes and so on.
Very cool stuff!

Politics
as Usual
The cover story
"Most Likely to
Succeed: The Clin
ton and Dole Col
lege Years" [Oct.
1996) was unbeliev
ably slanted towards
the liberals. The

article attracted my attention because 1
wanted to know the facts behind their
college years, not an editorial biased
toward Democrats. The two "pull
quotes" and the Hillary/Elizabeth com
parisons are prime examples of the
obvious slant in political view. If some
one is out to slam Republicans, do it in
an editorial, not a cover story.

You forgot one important detail
in Bill Clinton's "The Boring Stuff'
box. He helped pass the largest tax
increase in U.S. history in 1993. I
think this 112 a c t should have been
noted for a fair portrayal of him.
Remember that he can propose any
thing he wants to get elected. It does
n't mean he'll do it.

Teed Off About TAs
Your article "The Trouble with 1 As"
[Oct. 1996) had a very good point. Col
lege students are being taught by people
with no training to teach. However, it
does not apply just to 1 As. What makes
you think that faculty members have
been trained to teach? It's likely that
your second-grade teacher had more
education training than your last bio
chemistry professor.
M. W. Murray, doctoral student.
New Mexico State U.
As a fifth-semester junior, 1 have
had many TAs who were just as good
as the professors. In fact, the TA for
one of my theory classes is a bit more
open-minded than the professor for
my other theory class. The TA allows
us to voice our opinions, and he gives
us feedback.
Darcia Scales, junior, Venn State I/.
Mixed grades for your story " The
Trouble With TAs." I think your arti
cle should be commended for helping
to publicize the fact that grad students
are generally not given very much (if
any) training. But the sad truth is that
"substandard" teaching takes place just
as often, if not more often, with pro
fessors at the head of the class as with
TAs. Instead of talking about "under
qualified" TAs, we should be talking
about under trained TAs and start
rewarding excellence in teaching —
both monetarily and with respect — as
much as in research. Then college stu
dents would get the high-quality
teaching they deserve (and pay an arm
and a leg for).

Missing Melvin
I appreciated the somewhat sim
plified overview of black action
films [" Noth in' but an O. (1.
Thang," Sept. 1996], However, I
have a problem with the complete
exclusion of the work of Melvin Van
Peebles, the man who practically
invented the genre. As for the top
10 "Black List,"

whose idea was
it (o include
"Slaughter,
"Cleopatra /ones "
and "I'm Gonna
Git You Sucka"?
You've got to be
kidding me! Any
list of essential
blaxplo i t a t i on
films that
doesn't
include
"Dolemite,
"Sweet Sweet
back '< Haadasssss
Song," "Th e
Mack or "Super
fly" automatically
declares itself
invalid. Do your
research next
time.

Are U For Real?
The article on Bill Clinton and Bob
Dole in the October 11. was interesting,
well-balanced and thorough. I tip my hat
to U, Frances I lufhnan and the rest of the
11. staff. As the editorial director of a mag
azine named //., U are the only publisher
to whom I can imagine making this initial
proposal: since "U" is now an optional,
alternative spelling for "you" in the Ran
dom I louse dictionaries, since "U is a hip
spelling, and since "U" is in keeping with
11, consider spelling it that way in future
issues. Yes, it's something of a crazy sugges
tion. but it U mull it over, U'll see that it's
not that crazy after all I"he spelling of con
tracctions (U're, I' 11, U'vc, U'd) is a sim
ple matter and is being done in various
other quarters. Otherwise, I can't think of
any logistical obstacles. Thank U.
