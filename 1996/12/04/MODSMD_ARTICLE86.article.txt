MELLOW OUT
Eastern Illinois U.
Throwing marshmallows may
not seem like a capital offense, hut
the tuha players are getting pissed.
Security lias been increased at East
ern football games after fans started
throwing marshmallows into the
marching band's tubas. Several per
petrators were caught, stripped of
their student IDs and ejected from
the game. Now they face a $50
fine. Next time, try s'mores.
GOT MILK?
Brigham Young U.
tilow Marsha gives it up — big
time — and she really knows how
to please her man. The three-year
old 1 folstein is the pride and joy of
BYU after setting the national lac
tation record last year. Glow Mar
sha produced 5,466 gallons of milk
in 365 days. That's 15 gallons a
day for you English majors. We
think they should rechristcn her

TACO HALL
U. of Nebraska, Lincoln
When one classroom building
at Nebraska closed for asbestos
removal, most of the classes were
moved to other buildings. But
five homeless classes were relegat
ed to the local I aco Inn. The for
mer Mexican fast-food restau
rant, which had been sitting
empty, is now serving up tests
instead of tacos, and no, there's
no drive-thru or takeout. Despite
the faint smell of refried beans,
classes are proceeding normally
until .i new space can be found.

GO, CHEESERACER, GO
West Virginia U.
Freshman engineering students at West Vir
ginia can have their design projects and eat
them, too. The 45 students were asked to build
small cars capable of cruising down an incline.
Piece of cake, you say? The cars also had to be
(gulp) edible. Students turned in everything
from a bell pepper with peppcroni wheels to a
block of cheese with Oreo cookie wheels. And
the professor was serious about the edible part
— students who couldn't stomach their pro
jects would receive no grade. Does that mean
that engineers are what they cat?

BURN-OUTS
U. of West Florida
College is supposed to be a place where you use your brain,
right? Somebody oughtta tell that to the student at West Florida

down the flames elsewhere. Anoth
er student brainchild carried the
micro-inferno outside to try to extin
guish it. Lesson No. 2: Do not move
flaming appliances.

masks. I le was held hostage until
lie agreed to ask administrators to
allow concerts on the Student ('en
ter plaza. Two weeks later, Urban
head was shaved by rival U. ot Col
orado, Boulder s student president
after C 'SU s football team lost to
CU. Urban now sports a mohawk
Of course, we can't tell if Urban is
crusading for truth, justice and the
American way, or it he's just an
incredible ham. Either way,
he's got our vote.

KARATE CHOPIN
U. of New Mexico
He was kung fu fighting, but not fast as lightning. A UNM student
was accosted in a men's restroom by a man claiming to know martial
arts. The robber, who was carrying a concealed weapon, demanded the
student's money, but was miffed to find out his victim had only Si
After such .1 letdown, the karate kid turned in his white belt, hoping foi
a more lucrative future in piano playing. The Beethoven bandit headed
for a piano practice room in the building, where he tickled the ivory
until his arrest.

THE DUH FACTOR
The U.S. General Accounting
Office reports that tuition at four
year public colleges and universi
ties increased 234 percent betwcc
the 1980-81 and 1994-95schoo
years. That's three times more
than the measly 82 percent
increase in the median household
income. Its conclusion about the
increase? "Many students and the
families have borrowed more to
finance the cost of college." Dull.
And it took researchers to figure
that one out?
SUNNY DAYS

U. of Scranton, Pa.
Kermit's commencement
address at Long Island U. must

FOOD FLIGHT
U. of West Florida
Don't get mad — throw condi
ments? A West Florida student
was a tad peeved to find that her
room had been burglarized, so she
decided to vent her anger. Campus
police apprehended her after stu
dents in the courtyard below her
window noticed it was raining
condiments. The burglary victim
was seen chucking bottles and
sugar packets from her window,
l.ooney as her actions may be, the
woman is consistent. Dorm resi
dents saw her pouring syrup on
the stairs earlier in the day, and
her previous violent outbursts
included breaking a coffeepot over
her bodv.
SMALL-TIME
BACKPACK
BANDIT
U. of Georgia
A thief is leaving a northbound
trail across the U. of Georgia s
campus. He steals unattended
backpacks, then leaves them in
place of the next ones he nabs,
carving a traceable path from south
campus to north campus buildings.
1 he thief leaves the backpacks with
all valuables — except cash
inside, but he might want to revise
his not-so-lucrative stealing strate
gy. Ile robbed one I A of her
change purse, which contained a
whopping cents, and left her
expensive camera untouched.

IF YOU'RE PISSED,
PRESS ONE
Florida State U.
A student at Florida trulv reached out and
touched someone. Frustrated hv the phone reg
istration process, the clever student hacked inro
the registrar s voice mail and changed the mes
sage. Subsequent students who called to register
tor classes heard this message on the other end:
"It you're calling with questions about registra
tion, then vou probably already know that reg
istration I king blows. My advice to you
would be to transfer to another school."
