Ask college freshmen embarking on four
years of higher education if they'd like to take
five and you ll get a resounding "No!" It's not
surprising, considering the cost of tuition, books, room
and board.

But some motivated students arc
saying "Yes!" to five years. If stu
dents earn their undergrad degrees
in four years at ("lark U., Mass., or
Lehigh U., Pa., they can get their
master's in a fifth — and the univer
sities will pick up the tab.
Too good to be true? There's a
catch. Students need a 3.25 over
all CPA to be eligible for Clark's
program and a 3.5 for Lehigh s.
Still, "fifth year for free pro
grams get students a master's
degree for the price of a bache
lor's — in less time, since gradu
ate degrees arc completed in one
year instead of two.
"We believe the incentive of a
tuition-free fifth year will motivate

students to earn the necessary
grades," says Timothy Boulay,
media relations officer at Clark.
Fifth-year CHark student Laura
Oriente, who's earning an MBA,
says it's worth it for the savings. "I
would never have pursued a master's
if it hadn't been for this program."
According to Boulay, students
save $23,000 in tuition, room and
board for the sixth year they won't
need, and $19,600 in waived
tuition for the fifth year. Eighteen
students took the university's offer
this year.
The value exceeds mere tuition
dollars, says |ody Bernstein, a me
ter's candidate at Clark. "A high
school diploma used to be the most
important thing, but now you need
a master's to get most jobs.'

Lehigh U., whose
tuition also nears
$20,000, used Clark's
program as a model.
Seventy-one students
enrolled in it this
school year.
Julie Farrah, a
Lehigh neuroscience
student, took the extra
year to decide what to
do with her lite.
"You'd be crazy to
pass that up, she says.


What a bargain...
