"W" y Army Capt. Rich Steele was in
charge of 125 men in an airborne divi
• sion this time last year. Now, as a grad
uate student at Marshall U. in West Virginia, Steele takes
orders from a 20-year-old editor at the Daily Parthenon.

"Coming out of a command
environment, being on a subordinate
level, is a big change," Steele says.
Steele, along with Michelle Mar
tin, Stanford Angion, Kit Kassela and
Jeffrey Dean, is going back to school
as part of an Army re-education pro
gram. After eight years, U.S. Army
duty officers are assigned a functional
area — the five at Marshall are train
ing to be public affairs officers —
and receive graduate training at uni
versities across the country.
Martin says the return to acade
mia was a big adjustment. It's been
eight years since she graduated from
Youncstown State U., Ohio, with a

bachelor's in communications.
"I feel considerably older, like a
fish out of water, she says. "It's
hard getting back in the niche of
being a student."
Angion doesn't feel out of place,
but he says school is different this
time around.
"It's a great opportunity to do
things I never got to do as an under
grad," he says."The big difference
now is that this is my job, and 1 know
I'll be back in the Army soon.
Journalism professor Richard
Turner, who has had all five captains
as students, says their Army back
ground helps everyone involved.

"They arc some of the very best
students. They upgrade the level <>l
the class, promote good discussion
and come prepared.
Steele says before he came to
Marshall, he was one of the media's
biggest critics.
"I was always complaining about
the spin the media puts on issues like
politics. School has really helped us
understand First Amendment rights
and the role they play in democracy.
It gave me a new perspective the
media is not the enemy, but part of
the big picture of society."


A few good students...
