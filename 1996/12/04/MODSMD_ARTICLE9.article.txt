# Dozens hurt in Paris bombing

PARIS (AP) — A bomb tore
apart a packed subway car in the
heart of Paris yesterday, killing
two people, wounding dozens and
bringing fears of a new bombing
campaign like the one that terror
ized the city last year.
"It's starting again," said
Estelle Campos, clutching her 6-
and 12-year-old sons tight near
the subway station on the edge of
the Latin Quarter. "It's always
the same people who pay."
The bomb was fashioned from
a 28-pound gas canister — the
signature bomb used in the 1995
attacks that killed eight people
and injured 160. Algerian Muslim
militants claimed responsibility
for those attacks.
There was no immediate
claim of responsibility for the
rush-hour bombing. It hap
pened at 6:05 p.m. at the Port-
Royal station on the RER
regional line that shuttles thou
sands of commuters in and out
of the French capital.
The station is located between
the Boulevard St. Michel and the
Boulevard Montparnasse, about
two miles from the Eiffel Tower
and one mile from the Notre
Dame cathedral.

The bomb exploded just as the
train was pulling into the station,
which is partially in open air.
French radio said many
more might have died had
the entire station been
underground, concentrating
the force of the blast.
Police and rescue workers said
the bomb killed two people
instantly and seriously injured
another 35, seven of them criti
cally. About 50 other people were
slightly hurt.
Europe 1 radio, citing sources
close to the investigation, said the
canister was packed with nails
and that one body was mutilated
by the shrapnel.
French radio said some pas
sengers had seen an abandoned
package on the train before the
explosion.
The blast blew the doors off
the subway car, the second in a
long train. The detonation could
be felt as far back as the rear of
the train, a passenger told French
radio.
The passenger said he grabbed
a fire extinguisher and pushed
through the panicked crowd to
reach the burned-out hulk of the
snhwav car
