"TT £* YOU WEAR A SHORT SKIRT, IT'S AN EASY 'A'
I in Professor Smiths class." "Professor
Smith talks way too fast — perhaps to
compensate for always being late.

Ouch! Did that hurt? Well, as
examples from the Slam Tables,
they're supposed to.
At the U. of Texas, Austin, stu
dents don't rely on word of mouth
or student evaluations to spread the
word on teacher performance.
Rather, the Slam Tables are set up
on campus during registration peri

ods to aid students in choosing
their courses.
"They represent a very coarse
means of feedback ... but they do
give a very direct and unfiltered
view of student reactions," says
astronomy professor Craig Wheel
er, who once found "Wheeler is
God" written on the tables.

Covered
with butcher
paper and
divided into
education sub
jects, the tables
serve as an
anony m o us
forum for those
wishing to write
uncensored edi
torial ah out
their classes.
But believe it or
not, some pro
fessors arc less

than enthusiastic. Roderick Hart, a
professor ol communication, says he
has several reasons lor not reading
the tables.
"One, I see these messages as
privileged communication among
students. Two, I don't have much
respect for anonymous commen
tary. And three, I'm told the Slam
Tables are horrifically negative," he
says."For what it's worth, my col
leagues who regularly read the
Slam Tables are the most insecure
people 1 know."
Communications junior Alan
Densmore liked the tables so much,
he launched an online version for a
class project.
"This university is huge," Dens
more says. "Maintaining a sense of
community is essential to our spirit
and our success."
Although he says student reac
tion has been uniformly positive,
some professors who were trounced
online didn't appreciate the tables
advancement into cyberspace.
"One said the page was a vehicle
for defamation. Another said the
information on the page was equiva
lent to writing on the bathroom
wall, Densmore says.
Let's hope professors don t make
their own Slam Tables.


Slamming, U. of Texas, Austin, style.
