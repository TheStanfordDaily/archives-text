# Tooting His Own Horn

### Jessica Wehrman, Ohio U 
On his student evaluations, Ohio
U. finance professor Dwight Pugh
garnered such praise as "Deserves to
be a UP (university professor)-4-life"
and"The greatest! Even better than
I'd heard."
But Pugh's students didn't write the
lavish acclaims. He did.
Pugh has admitted to falsifying his
student evaluations, which leaves
administrators in a delicate position.
Students caught cheating on exams at
Ohio U. are given an automatic "F" for
academic misconduct. But what about
professors cheating on their exams?
"I felt kind of embarrassed, con
sidering this is a professor in my col
lege," says senior Carrie Rundio. "And
I was shocked, because a lot of people
in my business fraternity talked highly
of him."
Particularly mysterious is why Pugh
would have falsified evaluations at all.
Evaluations are used to decide faculty
pay raises and tenure, but Pugh has
been named university professor five
times and runs a variety of businesses
outside of his teaching job.
"The evaluation process has been
corrupted by a need for the administra
tion to have controls on faculty," says
associate journalism professor Joe
Bernt. "When I was a college student,
evaluations were for students so they
could know what teachers to avoid."
Pugh says he meant his doctored
evaluations to work as a control group
to check whether the student evalua
tion system of the College of Business
was working properly.
Since Pugh didn't violate any uni
versity policies when he falsified the
evaluations, which ranked him as one
of the best-rated professors in the Col
lege of Business, he will continue to
teach at the university.
Senior Keith Johns wanted to see
Ohio U. make an example of the finance
professor.
"It's ridiculous," he says. "If we
cheated, it would be a big deal. He
cheats, and he hasn't broken any
rules."
