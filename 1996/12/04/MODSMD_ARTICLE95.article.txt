students in chat rooms on the Internet. I hree senior psychology
students at Haverford College, Pa., are studying students on the Inter
net and finding that they're more hold and agressive than in real life.

Cara Kupperman, Julie Wolf and
Michele Munoz are working on a research
project addressing the social implications of
the Internet, and they say there's a hig dis
crepancy between personalities on screen
and off.
"In general, an lRCer [Internet user]
seems to take on an exaggerated persona to
become the person that he/she wouldn't
otherwise be for fear of rejection, Kupper
man says.
Kupperman describes people she has
met in what she calls "RL," or real life, as
less flirtatious than they are online, as well
as less bold.

they're still in the early stages of the project
and won't know the outcome of their study
until the spring, Wolf says they have two
theories about the personality type of the
frequent IRCer: It could either be an intro
vert who doesn't like face-to-face interac
tion, or someone who seeks constant inter
action and uses the Internet when there's
no one to interact with.

could have worked a chat room.

we found most fascinating was the
amount of anonymity and the ability to
re-create oneself by choosing an alternate
mode of self-expression," Munoz says.
The students have found them
selves at the forefront of Internet
study. "We've found nothing in
terms of past research on Internet use,
but there's tons of research going on
now, so there will be a big boom in
research in a year or so," Wolf says.
Doug Davis, adviser for the project
and professor of psychology, says the
students are studying the personality
differences among IRCers as a way to
figure out what the Internet does for
and to them.
The trio's hypothesis is that a cer
tain type of person is drawn to spend a
