• Don't get mad; get into their Web site. Defendants in a Swedish hacker
case broke into the ClA's Web site and renamed it the Central Stupidity Agency.
The hackers also linked the page to a variety of sex, music and Scandinavian
hacker sites. The modified page was left posted for a full 12 hours. This may be
the new cyberfad. A few weeks prior to the CIA scenario, anonymous hackers
altered the U.S. Department of Justice home page to read U.S. Department of
Injustice.
• California governor Pete Wilson announced that the state will not join 10
other western states in creating a regional online college. Instead, California will
start its own virtual university. According to a spokesperson, the tentatively
named Western Governors University will continue to develop plans for the
online school.

• Lights, camera, Jennifer Aniston... Steven Spielberg... Quentin Tarantino.
These and other famous Hollywood names are on Steven Spielberg's Director's
Chair, a new CD-ROM from Knowledge Adventure that lets players create their
own blockbusters. This close encounter of the cyber kind allows you to do
everything from honing the script to choosing special effects.
• The abacus. Then the slide rule. Then the adding machine, the pocket cal
culator ... and now: The Integrator! At Wolfram Research's new Web site
(http://www.integrals.com), a computer program called Mathematica will
crunch any calculus problem you have and spit out the solution. Next up: The
Bard! For translating those pesky Shakespeare verses
• Network Event Theater is rolling out the red carpet at more than 33 U.S.
campuses. It wires on-campus theaters with satellite dishes and digital-sound
systems for free and beams in the laser-disk quality premieres at no cost to stu
dents. The company also offers screenings of pay-TV events.
