First there were drive-thru funerals. Then talking head
stones. What's next: Funerals on the Internet? Absolutely! I he
latest craze to hit the bereavement business is an online service
that allows mourners to pay their respects via their personal computers.
"Some people may lie hesitant to the idea at first, but this isn't something I intended to insult peo
ple's traditions," says lack Martin, president of Simplex Knowledge Co. and cyberfuneral developer
Here's how it works: A digital camera hooked up to a PC sends live pics of the funeral service t(

online viewers.
Cyber'mourners can
view the images,
"chat" with other
mourners and even
click on icons to
send flowers, shiva
baskets and sympa
thy cards.
Ed Cosgrove,
owner of Cosgrove
and Sons Funeral
Home in New Jer
sey, says he plans
to offer the cyber
funeral service.
"This isn't just
another tad, like
the drive-up funer
als, because it's
done with taste,

lie says. "What if someone lives in Australia and some
one they know dies in the U.S., but he can t afford to
come here? This gives people contact with friends and
family during a very sad time."
Patricia Dixon, funeral director for Abbey 112 uneral
Home in Tallahassee, Via., says she has mixed emotions
about the cyberfuneral.
"On one side, I can see the excitement,' Dixon says.
"But for many people, funerals have very firm tradi
tions, and trying to broadcast something like that on
the Internet might violate their sense of dignity.'
Buying the whole cyberfuneral setup costs $6,500,
but it can be rented for $295 per day.
Computer science major Craig Paxton, a sophomore
at the U. of Miami, predicts that cyberfuneral profits
will go through the roof.
"If people will go for cybersex, how could thev turn
down a cyberfuneral?" he says.
