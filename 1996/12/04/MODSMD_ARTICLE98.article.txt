## Staying Power 
### Jeff Randall, U. of Nebraska, Lincoln 
A FEW MONTHS AGO,
Anne Upturch
wanted nothing
more than to go to college.
The 18-year-old freshman enter
ing the U. of Nebraska, Lincoln,
dreamed of an escape from the
chains of living at home, along with
a wealth of new social and educa
tional experiences.

But that was a few months ago.
Now Upturch wants to go home.
"It's what 1 expected, but I guess
it's just not enough to make me want
to stay," Upturch said in late Sep
tember, only five weeks into what she
had expected to be a four-year college
career. "I'm ready to go home.
Upturch's attitude may seem
strange to the millions of students at
schools nationwide, but to universi
ty administrators, she's .ill too com
mon. According to a report pub
lished in July by American College
Testing, about one-fourth of all col
lege freshmen do not return for
their sophomore year.
The reasons for dropping out are
many: money, grades, homesickness

or a combination of any of the
above. But the result is always the
same — students don't come back.
"You look at the numbers, and
the numbers say we have a prob
lem," savs James Griesen, vice chan
cellor lor student affairs at the U. of
Nebraska, Lincoln. "It's up to us to
fix that problem.
And that's exactly what universi
ties are trying to do.
At Nebraska, a three-credit class
called University Foundation lays
down the basics for success in col
lege — time management, study
skills and student involvement are
just a few. In addition, Freshman
I earning Communities puts stu
dents in small groups who live on
the same dorm floor, take the same
classes and get together for study
sessions.
West Virginia U.'s Operation
Jumpstart takes freshman retention
a step further by recruiting profes
sors to live in residence halls and
serve as mentors.
Richard Schreiber, a professor of
journalism at West Virginia, and his
wife arc two of those mentors.
"The whole objective of the pro
gram is to let freshmen know from
the beginning that the faculty is
here for them,' Schreiber says."It
makes the idea of being one out of
thousands of students a little less

overwhelming.'
Although no
program will guar
antee that freshmen
will stay on for
another year,
Griesen says univer
sities shouldn't give
up on the students.
"If it's set in
their minds that
they want to leave,
then they'll leave,"
he says. "But we d
at least like to have
them think about it
a little harder before
they do and give
them a few more
reasons to stay."
