### Chuck Carlson 
Fifty years ago, Stanford alumnus William Shockley invent
ed the transistor at Bell I -abs in New Jersey. This, of course,
has become part Stanford history as well as larger legend.
As possibly the most important technological innovation of the
20th century, Shocklev's invention gave birth to the modern elec
tronics industry. Less well-known, but equally important to the
development of the electronics industry, was the passage of the
Taft-Hartley Act in the same year, 1947. Conceived in a conser
vative backlash toward the increasing militance of the labor

movement, Taft-Hartley marked
the end of a decade of unprecedent
ed public and state support for
American unions. These two seem
ingly unrelated events reflect the
defining aspects of the electronics
revolution; they brought into being
an entirely new industry based on
incessant technological innovation
with an unyielding opposition to
workers' organization of their
workplace.
Hidden beneath the popu
lar press's celebration of the indus
try's entrepreneurial spirit, techni
cal genius, and dazzling new prod

wets is a very different story about environmental degradation,
ilie export of jobs to overseas sweatshops, continuing industry
dependence on military contracts, the exploitation of immi
grants, ethnic minorities and women and the most intransigent
group of anti-union corporate managers this country has ever
produced. For good or ill, this story begins here on the Stanford
campus.
The semiconductor industry is the child of the Cold War.
Although the transistor, the forerunner to the printed circuit
board or semiconductor, was invented by Shockley in 1947, the
industry that grew up around it was not established until the early
19505. Stanford engineering legend Frederick Terman lobbied
both the Stanford administration and the U.S. government to
promote research and production of electronics in the early cold
war era. Terman was indefatigable in his efforts to establish an
electronics research endeavor and, later, the Stanford Research
Park as centers for the production and development of the new
technology. As a true visionary, he foresaw the application of the

semiconductor as the wave of the future for both military and
consumer technology. The value of the semiconductor to emerg
ing military technology was equally recognized by American cold
war planners and, subsequently, Termans efforts were richly
rewarded by a continuous flow of military research and develop
ment grants throughout the 19505. The consumer applications of
electronic circuitry would lag well behind its military uses; as
with penicillin, the airplane and the automatic assault rifle, the
transfer of technology from the military to civilian uses was a

trickle-down affair.
The early giants of the
industry — Shockley, Bill
Hewlett, David Packard and
Bob Noyce — were all either
Stanford alumni or located
their industries in the Stanford
Research Park, established
through lermans efforts in
1954. The long-term leases at
the park, which charged
nascent industries a pittance as
an inducement to establish
near Stanford, are still in force
today. Throughout the 19505,
fueled by lavish defense con

tracts, the electronics industry began to spread out like spokes of
wheel from the Stanford hub. The Cold War, the Korean War,
and later the Vietnam War produced a huge demand for elec
tronic technology. From 1954 to 1961, 80 percent of all new
manufacturing jobs created in the Silicon Valley were related to
defense projects. With a solid base in defense production, the
nascent industry swiftly expanded into consumer commodities
until, in the mid-19605, consumer production surpassed defense
related contracts. Despite the industry's current success in con
sumer markets, a large portion of the annual defense budget is
still dedicated to electronics procurement. About $30 billion for
electronics contracts was included in this year's defense budget, a
share expected to rise to $50 billion by the year 2000. Defense
remains a significant cornerstone to the health of the industry as
a whole.
Today, electronics is the largest manufacturing employer
in the country; about 2.3 million people arc employed in elec
tron ics-related production. In the Silicon Valley, 11 out of the top
