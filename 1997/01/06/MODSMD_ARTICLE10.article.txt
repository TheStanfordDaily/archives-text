## Bled Dry by the Cutting Edge A 						Short History Silicon. The 						First of a Two-Part Series on Local History of Labor in the Valley 
### Chuck Carlson 
Fifty years ago, Stanford alumnus William Shockley invent
ed the transistor at Bell I -abs in New Jersey. This, of course,
has become part Stanford history as well as larger legend.
As possibly the most important technological innovation of the
20th century, Shocklev's invention gave birth to the modern elec
tronics industry. Less well-known, but equally important to the
development of the electronics industry, was the passage of the
Taft-Hartley Act in the same year, 1947. Conceived in a conser
vative backlash toward the increasing militance of the labor

movement, Taft-Hartley marked
the end of a decade of unprecedent
ed public and state support for
American unions. These two seem
ingly unrelated events reflect the
defining aspects of the electronics
revolution; they brought into being
an entirely new industry based on
incessant technological innovation
with an unyielding opposition to
workers' organization of their
workplace.
Hidden beneath the popu
lar press's celebration of the indus
try's entrepreneurial spirit, techni
cal genius, and dazzling new prod

wets is a very different story about environmental degradation,
ilie export of jobs to overseas sweatshops, continuing industry
dependence on military contracts, the exploitation of immi
grants, ethnic minorities and women and the most intransigent
group of anti-union corporate managers this country has ever
produced. For good or ill, this story begins here on the Stanford
campus.
The semiconductor industry is the child of the Cold War.
Although the transistor, the forerunner to the printed circuit
board or semiconductor, was invented by Shockley in 1947, the
industry that grew up around it was not established until the early
19505. Stanford engineering legend Frederick Terman lobbied
both the Stanford administration and the U.S. government to
promote research and production of electronics in the early cold
war era. Terman was indefatigable in his efforts to establish an
electronics research endeavor and, later, the Stanford Research
Park as centers for the production and development of the new
technology. As a true visionary, he foresaw the application of the

semiconductor as the wave of the future for both military and
consumer technology. The value of the semiconductor to emerg
ing military technology was equally recognized by American cold
war planners and, subsequently, Termans efforts were richly
rewarded by a continuous flow of military research and develop
ment grants throughout the 1950s. The consumer applications of
electronic circuitry would lag well behind its military uses; as
with penicillin, the airplane and the automatic assault rifle, the
transfer of technology from the military to civilian uses was a

trickle-down affair.
The early giants of the
industry — Shockley, Bill
Hewlett, David Packard and
Bob Noyce — were all either
Stanford alumni or located
their industries in the Stanford
Research Park, established
through lermans efforts in
1954. The long-term leases at
the park, which charged
nascent industries a pittance as
an inducement to establish
near Stanford, are still in force
today. Throughout the 19505,
fueled by lavish defense con

tracts, the electronics industry began to spread out like spokes of
wheel from the Stanford hub. The Cold War, the Korean War,
and later the Vietnam War produced a huge demand for elec
tronic technology. From 1954 to 1961, 80 percent of all new
manufacturing jobs created in the Silicon Valley were related to
defense projects. With a solid base in defense production, the
nascent industry swiftly expanded into consumer commodities
until, in the mid-19605, consumer production surpassed defense
related contracts. Despite the industry's current success in con
sumer markets, a large portion of the annual defense budget is
still dedicated to electronics procurement. About $30 billion for
electronics contracts was included in this year's defense budget, a
share expected to rise to $50 billion by the year 2000. Defense
remains a significant cornerstone to the health of the industry as
a whole.
Today, electronics is the largest manufacturing employer
in the country; about 2.3 million people arc employed in elec
tron ics-related production. In the Silicon Valley, 11 out of the top

-25 firms are in electronics; about one out of five workers are
employed in micro-electronics, and 71 percent of all manufac
turing jobs are related to electronics production. As an indus
try, electronics also can claim the dubious distinction of pos
sessing the lowest rate of unionization in the nation. About 2.7
percent of all electronics employees operate under union con
tracts, most which are in "captive facilities' like GM and
AT&T, in which workers fall under industry-wide collective
bargaining agreements. Considering that only about 14.5 per
cent of workers in the United States belong to a union, this
may not seem so astonishing, but it is striking when compared
to the unionization of other large manufacturing industries
like steel (56.2 percent), auto (54.6 percent), telecommunica
tions (43.N percent) and even construction (22 percent). The
ability of the electronics industry to remain a bastion of non
union iabor defies simple explanation, considering it was born
in an era when unions were at the peak of their strength in the
United States; almost 36 percent of all workers held union
cards in the early 19505. Some of the explanation lies in the
competitive nature of the industry, the decentralized and inter
nationalized nature of electronics production and the histori
cal lack of interest in some of Americas major unions in enlist
ing low wage, semi-skilled minority and women workers to
their ranks. A major portion of the answer, however, lies in the
ideology of the industry's movers and shakers, which was for
mulated, like the industry itself, during the early stages of a
management backlash aimed at American unions in the early
post-World War II era.
At the end of World War 11, organized labor was at the
peak of both its power in the workplace and its popularity in
the public mind. Aided by the liberalization of labor laws and
the creation of the National Labor Relations Board during the
(ireat Depression, unprecedented numbers of Americans had
joined unions and won contracts from every major manufac
turing industry in the country. Organized labor's moment of
triumph, however, was to be exceedingly brief. In the eyes of
industrial and financial capitalists, labor had overstepped the
acceptable boundaries of workers' control of production issues.
About the same time as Shockley invented the transistor, the
labor movement was about to be swept away by the conver
gence of a managerial counterrevolution and the emergence of
the Cold War.
It was in this era that the future giants of the electron

ics industry, Packard (Hewlett-Packard), Noyce and Andy
Grove (Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel) and Charles
Sporck (Fairchild and National Semiconductor) were found
ing their companies and beginning their careers. The anti
union ideology and zeal for internationalizing production
which dominates the industry today can be seen as a direct
byproduct of the shifting attitudes towards unions and the
corporate vision of a U.S.-dominated global economy devel
oped in that early Cold War era. The intimate connections
between electronics and the defense industry no doubt
strengthened the ideological resistance to militant rank-and
file (worker controlled) unions like the United Electrical
Workers.
If the earlv growth of the industry was dependent on
the Cold War program of military buildup, it didn't stay that
way for long. Beginning in the late 19505, the application of
electronics to consumer products expanded rapidly.
Televisions, radios and a host of other consumer technologies
employed the transistor and the semiconductor or printed cir
cuit board enabling the establishment of an industry in main
frame computers. The U.S. electronics industry dominated
both national and international markets for electronics goods
until the late 19705. By 1977, more than 6,000 electronics
firms were registered in the United States, producing every
thing from digital watches and hand-held calculators to televi
sions and computers. U.S. firms also established numerous
off-shore production plants, primarily in Southeast Asia.
Fairchild Semiconductor was the first company to establish an
overseas plant in Hong Kong in 1963, but the rising tide of
both domestic and later Japanese competition produced a
flood of new offshore plants throughout the 1960s and early
19705. By 1971, there were more workers employed in
American electronics plants overseas than within the United
States.
The move offshore is blandly treated as an economic
inevitability in most articles about the electronics industry, but
its consequences to both American workers and international
workers have been profound. As electronics production
evolved, a strict ethnic and sexual division of labor evolved
with it. Both inside and outside U.S. borders, women have
constituted the majority of electronics production workers,
particularly in the area of electronics assembly — the placing
of electronics components (transistors, diodes, etc.) on print-
Ed circuit boards. In 1979, more than 200,000 Southeast
Asian women were engaged in assembly, mostly in American
owned plants. Inside the U.S., in 1990, more than 60 percent
of electronics factory operatives were women and nearly 75
percent were drawn from the ranks of ethnic minorities.
Whether in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines
or Israel — all significant centers of electronics production —
the typical worker was and is female, a member of a local eth
nic minority and chronically overworked and underpaid. In
the intensely competitive atmosphere of todays market for
electronics commodities, the exploitation of women and legal
and illegal immigrant workers has become a key to remaining

competitive.
The imperative of the
industry to keep labor
costs low grows out of
the labor intensive
nature of electronics
work. Despite the
automation of portions
of the process of making
printed circuit boards
and semiconductors,
much of the assembly
and plating process still
depends on careful and
tedious hand and eye
work which cannot be

turned over to the
machines which now dominate the assembly lines of other
industries. The rapid expansion of the U.S. economy in the
postwar era brought about a need for an expansion in the
workforce. The postwar vision was that of free movement of
raw materials and manufactured goods across international
borders, and to accomplish this mobility of capital, the mobil
ity of labor became an additional priority. Between 1952 and
1968, the United States relaxed immigration restrictions and
17 million immigrants entered the United States between
1952 and 1992. This influx of relatively cheap immigrant
labor along with the concurrent exodus of U.S. production
facilities overseas had serious consequences for the strength
and viability of American unions.
I his is a delicate and complicated subject. Too often
immigrant workers and the transfer of production facilities
overseas have been approached by U.S. labor in xenophobic
and racist terms. Just as often, defenders of U.S. economic
policy and defenders of immigration and immigrants have
cast off criticism of policies as simple racism or colloquial
nationalism. The toughest fact to confront is that U.S. work
ers have had their wages and employment opportunities at
least indirectly diminished by both trends and that U.S.
industries have used immigrant labor to both depress wages
and break unions. Capitalism depends on some level of
residual unemployment to keep wages from rising; one need
only note the negative reaction of the stock markets to
reports of unemployment dropping below six percent to wit
ness this trend. The point here is not to criticize immigrants
or immigration policy, but to note the exploitation of these
policies by the electronics industry, and explore the reaction
of the industry to the initiatives of both immigrant workers

and unions to organize electronics shops.
Plating is only the first step of the production of cir
cuit boards and has traditionally been an almost exclusively
male domain, but the other end of the process — the assem
bling of electronic components onto printed circuit boards —
has largely been dominated by the employment of immigrant
or minority women. The idea that women's domestic work fol
lows them into the workplace, in other words that women are
channeled into professions which demand patient, meticulous
work, is still an operative concept in electronics. One woman
assembler put it this way: "Women make the best workers at
this kind of thing because you have to be patient, you have to
be good with your hands and the work is so tedious. Isn't rais
ing children and doing housework tedious? 1 mean women are
good at this. And, I guess, women are hired mainly because
the labor is cheap, and you don't have to have a good educa
tion behind you to get a start." Women made up more than
60 percent of the assembly line workers and 80 percent of the
clerical workers in the industry, but less than 25 percent of the
managerial, professional and technical workers as of 1990.
This strict division of labor, along with a reliance on
immigrant and minority labor is a keystone of the industry
which serves to depress wages and keep production costs as
well as consumer prices low. The hiring of different ethnic
minorities and legal and illegal immigrants by Silicon Valley
plants has also erected barriers for unions attempting to orga
nize electronics workers. As many as five or six languages may
be spoken within a single production plant, and while this
does not hinder production (as long as supervisors are bilin
gual or multilingual), it does effectively hinder organization by
erecting language barriers between workers and between orga
nizers and workers.
Given this overview of the demography of the elec
tronics industry, what is the nature of the work that it
requires? I worked in a small semiconductor plating shop in
the mid-1970s under conditions that could, at best, be
described as primitive. As a copper plater, I moved racks of
recently drilled circuit boards — at that point in the process,
simply thin squares of fiberglass with copper sheeting lami
nated on both sides — through a double line of chemical filled
barrels to plate the holes, creating conductivity from one side
of the board to the other. The boards were later silk-screened
(by hand), etched by a caustic ammonia solution to remove
the excess copper and create the "pathways' or "traces"
between holes and then plated with a tin-lead solution to pro
tect the copper traces. Most of the boards we plated would go
into calculators, early digital watches or missile-guidance sys
tems (claims that U.S. nukes could strike within 100 feet of
their Soviet targets usually brought on a good laugh; we used
to bet if they could land in the correct hemisphere). The plat
ing process was tedious, and the plating shop was a witch's
brew of formaldehyde, acids, ammonia and smoke from
superheated oil. On cold days, the chemicals would condense
and create a fine mist which hung like an early morning fog
off nearby Monterey Bay.
Working under conditions of high toxicity and inter
minable boredom for ten cents over minimum wage quickly
divested us of any previous notions that the electronics indus
try was the clean, space age industry its boosters proclaimed

it to be. Underneath the glitz of the advertising and booster
ism was a production process which resembled a cross between
the industrial environment of a steel mill and the repetitive
hand-eye motions of a Guess Jeans sweat shop. The idea that
it was either clean or modern, was a laughable proposition for
those of us on the production line. That we were part of ded
icated production team was even more ludicrous. Without
exception, our goal was to get through the day with enough
energy left to go home and crash in front of the tube for a few
hours. We coped with our working conditions in a number of
both time-honored and innovative ways.
Once on the line, we quickly learned to control the
pace of our work. In the 19th century this practice was called
"the stint," the process of learning how, when and where a
worker can apply their knowledge of production to keep the
process moving at a reasonable pace. On my line, this meant
knowing how long I could keep the racks of boards in certain
chemical vats to either speed-up or slow-down production. On
swing shift, this was easy. Without a supervisor around, we
could crank out most of our quotas in five or six hours and
spend a couple of hours of our shift talking, visiting friends in
other departments or sneaking into the office and reading the
latest batch of 'how to stifle the union drive' literature our
bosses got from the Western Electronics Manufacturing
Association (the only way we knew that "the union was out
there). On day shifts, employing and enforcing the stint
involved sleight of hand; adjusting the work flow communal
ly to appear to maintain a smooth production flow while con
cealing the potential for what we actually could produce from
the bosses.
Now, for those of you who plan to go into manage
ment this may seem dishonest or sleazy, but one thing we
learned quickly was that if you actually did speed production
to rush out a special order, the bosses immediately assumed
you could work that fast all the time. The work was exhaust
ing enough at the pace we enforced; cranking it up a notch
meant we went home, ate, went to sleep and then dreamt
about work all night. No boss is going to pay you overtime for
dreaming about the job.
I he second major way of coping with conditions was
a product of the rimes. We fought toxics with toxics and
worked stoned, drunk or otherwise altered. This wasnt diffi
cult to get away with. The chemical fog in the plating room
always produced irritated, red eyes; the bosses had no way of
knowing we were blitzed and didn't really care, as long as the
production quotas were met. This method of resisting was a
decidedly double-edged sword. While altered consciousness
led to some creative coping activities — one guy used to work
out new guitar licks while running the ammonia etcher, while
1 used to compose musicals based on a plating shop theme in
my head — getting high took the urgency out of a more direct
forms of resistance like forming a union. In our shop, work
ing-class consciousness was altered consciousness. The former
never had a chance at overcoming the latter, given that one
could substantially ameliorate the pain and drudgery by effec
tively removing their mind from the workplace.
The ultimate method of resisting was quitting. In the
Seventies there were literally dozens of small plating shops
under contract to the large companies like Intel, Fairchild or
National Semiconductor. If you didn't like your pay or condi

tions, you could simply quit and find another shop — in
boom times, anyway. The turnover rate in electronics manu
facturing is about 30 percent in any given year; in our shop, it
was closer to half. I personally quit twice and was hired back a
few months after my departure. Even though the bosses knew
I would likely be a short-timer, they preferred hiring someone
they didn't have to train rather than take a 50-50 chance on
hiring someone new who would probably quit anyway. They
knew and I knew that nobody looks at plating as a career.

1 he larger AFL-CIO unions which have tried to orga

nize workers in Silicon Valley have
been handicapped by their traditional
emphasis on skilled white workers as
their constituency. Progressive minor
ity-oriented unions like United
Electrical Workers (UE) have also
been handicapped, however, by the
lack of resources to hire and train
organizers who are fluent in, say,
Spanish, Chinese, lagalog and
Vietnamese. This has not prevented
them from trying. In the early 1970s

and into the 1980s, UE launched organizing drives through
out Silicon Valley. As a relatively small union which charges
minimal membership dues, UE has limited financial resources
to put into organizing drives. Typically, they will enlist a few
workers to form an "organizing committee, and the workers
will actually conduct the enlistment of their co-workers into
the union. The Electronics Organizing Committee was found
ed at several shops (National Semiconductor the largest) in
1973 and 1974. 1 he campaign was driven by the demand for
a cost-of-living adjustment, known in union parlance as a
COLA, and better working conditions. Workers at two small
plating shops actually voted to join UE. The industry's reac
tion was swift and incredibly heavy handed. The Western
Electronics Manufacturing Association (WEMA) offered help
to the shops' management to combat the union. A union-bust
ing consultant firm was hired, negotiations with the union
were dragged out, and when the workers went out on strike in
response, the shops simply closed their doors and went out of
business. By 1978, the campaign was forced underground.
The myth of the hygienic workplace, a product not so
much of modernized production but of Silicon Valley PR,
eventually began to crack. The public was kept in the dark
about the toxicity of Silicon Valley's purportedly "clean
industry until the contamination of the south Santa Clara
Valley water table by Fairchild and IBM hit the headlines in
1980. A study revealed that the neighborhoods around these
industries had three times the national occurrence of birth
defects and miscarriages. Semiconductor plants use up to
5,000 toxic chemical compounds and require large amounts
of water in the production process. The revelation that IBM
and Fairchild had legally and illegally dumped huge amounts
of chemicals and chemically contaminated water hit the com
munity like a bomb.
The industry response was predictable: obfuscation,
facile compliance with the EPA, protracted legal maneuvers,
and aggressive public relations campaigns. One of the ways the
industry promoted its "clean nature was through publicizing

the sterile and somewhat clinical operation of the clean room
in the plating process. The operations of the clean room were
held up as an example of the industry's attention to both envi
ronment, health, and quality. The following description
reveals, however, that their function was dedicated only to the
latter: "Clean rooms are sealed work areas in which particulate
matter as small as a speck of dust or dead skin is filtered from
the air to prevent contaminating the chips during the manu
facturing process. Chemical fumes, however, which do not
affect chip performance, are not of comparable concern. Clean
room workers wear special protective clothing which covers
them from head to foot and gives them the appearance of large
white rabbits. The clothing is designed to protect the chip
from contamination by the worker, not to protect the worker
from the chemicals used to produce the chip."
By the late 1980s, worker compensation statistics
revealed that half of all occupational illnesses of semiconduc
tor workers resulted from "systemic poisonings" brought on by
exposure to toxic chemicals. Given that cancers related to toxic
exposure can take up to 20 years to manifest, those statistics
will likely turn out to be the tip of a very large iceberg. A for
mer United Electrical Workers organizer has called the semi
conductor workers of the 1970s "canaries in a coal mine," a
reference to the 19th-century practice of placing canaries in
coal mines that would keel over dead when workers hit other
wise undetectable gas pockets. While the industry has been
forced to tighten their handling and disposal of toxic chemi
cals, they have only addressed these conditions when forced
and have fought tighter regulations — as well as attempts at
worker organization — every step of the way.
In 1981, with the revelation of the ground water pol
lution at IBM and Fairchild, UE felt the time was again ripe to
go public. I he second campaign also proposed a COLA, but
also addressed issues of race and gender discrimination, work
place safety, and toxic pollution. Working with the Silicon
Valley Toxics Coalition — a local grass-roots, neighborhood
environmental group — they brought the issue of toxics before
the public and won new regulations on toxics storage and dis
posal. National Semiconductor was the company targeted for
the union drive and several hundred workers signed UE mem
bership cards. Once again, the industry response was immedi
ate. NSC granted another 35-percent raise to workers, and
fired the key organizers. When a large group of Filipino work
ers walked out to protest the firing, the management issued a
blanket demand that all workers present green cards within 72
hours. One can only assume that these were not demanded
upon hiring. Within a few weeks NSC had fired or laid off
about 1,000 workers as a result of the anti-union campaign.
They claimed that these were necessary or planned reductions.
With the breaking of the second organizing drive, UE
had exhausted its resources. They filed several lawsuits and
grievances to the National Labor Relations Board to get shop
employees who had worked as organizers reinstated and won a
few of them, but the costs of the proceedings, the mass layoffs
and the fear that pervaded the workplace effectively derailed
UE's ability to sustain the campaign. Several other unions,
including the United Auto Workers and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers also attempted organizing
drives at targeted plants around this time, but they met the
same response and fate of UE efforts. The cessation of efforts

in 1983 effectively ended efforts at unionizing Silicon Valley
FLlectronics for over a decade. It was not until the Justice for
Janitors campaign of recent years that unionization would
threaten any portion of the industry's employees. The success
of Justice for Janitors, which seeks to compel electronics firms
to contract only unionized janitorial services, has sparked
renewed interest in unionizing the industry, and the AFL-CIO
is currently beginning to approach Silicon Valley engineers
with union proposals.
Highly educated, solidly middle-class engineers may
seem to he unlikely candidates for unionization, but the AFL
CIO's new strategy is a product of the times. The ongoing shift
of production overseas and retention of research and develop
ment in the valley has reversed the proportion of production
to technical workers in recent years. The constant restructur
ing, mergers, and down-sizing of many electronics firms has
commensurately raised the consciousness of many white collar
workers to the tenuousness of their job security. If a new
unionization effort arises, it will likely be among white collar
professionals this time around. While the AFL-CIO sees this
as a promising strategy, it would seem to be fraught with diffi
culties. Higher-paid employees who have traditionally been
loyal and even enthusiastic about their companies, steeped in
corporate cultures, and fairly satisfied with working conditions
would not seem to make ideal targets for signing the union
card. Additionally, to some this approach may seem to aban
don the low paid women and minority production workers to
their fates. If, however, a pincer movement does evolve, union
izing the janitors at the bottom and engineers at the top, an
industry-wide union consciousness may evolve. Time will tell.
The electronics industry, in the meantime, will contin
ue its current trends. Intel has recently committed a half-bil
lion dollars to the building of a new industrial park outside of
Manila in the Philippines, where it can operate without the
cumbersome restrictions of complying with industry regula
tions and providing a living wage for its employees. And Apple
just announced plans to lay off another 3,000 workers. I he
industry is on a roll, and for American production workers,
immigrant and otherwise, that means jobs will continue to roll
out of Silicon Valley. The workers t hat remain will continue to
work and live at the whim of management under the vicissi
tudes of a boom-and-bust industry on the cutting edge of tech
nological development. If there's a moral to this story, it's that
when you go out and but that new 200 Mhz MMX or that new
Performa, keep in mind that the cutting edge cuts two ways.
