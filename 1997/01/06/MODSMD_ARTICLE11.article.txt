## El Valle Perdido 
### Joseph Rosenblum 
Strobe lights dazzled and her skin was like fire it was so
hot, her dark eyes burning with centuries of spited fury,
and when she talked her breath was like scalding steam,
wisps of smoke curling around her ears. Red, orange, wood
brown and peat. Bands of dull silver crossed everywhere, under
every seat and in their pockets. The bar was on some low plu
ton of Andean granite covered in scorched green murk and
nestled in the valley, el Valle Perdido, she said with fire in my
ear.
Inti and Tupak were carved in the wooden pillars and
beams that support the bar, and small dark men and women
were crouched in corners, wads of coca in their cheeks, speak
ing Aymarra and playing games with dice. We drank rubbing
alcohol out of tin cups and ate steaming ears of corn dripping
with goat's milk cheese. Small sodium lanterns, borne by the
miners, blinked in the fluctuating shafts of hot air and smoke.
Rain beating time and another tin cup round, scalded
earth, throats, remembering green hills like diseased elephants
passing in a rickety train car and speaking Peruvian to a half-
Japanese man with a Konica. There's an Indian sacrificed in
these hills every other day, I say with stained lips quivering. He
nods and bares a mostly-straight set of yellow teeth, his tongue

attacking through slit
gaps and his breath
like hot rancid socks.
Liquid fire in
my throat keeps my
mind sharp.
She and I
speak in telepathy. It
saves us time, and
when a white horse
whinnied, we left,

were gone and out, and in a mat of hay we were tangled and
drunk, drinking blood and crying, while a fire burned down
half the whole village.
Morning like having a burning cross in your yard
screams in my eyes. One day, she cradles my head but some
things wrong. We are oozing sweat, and green slime peeks
from under our fingernails and our lips smack of sour milk. It's
a phase of the wind, a shake of a tree, a stillness. She inclines
her head towards the window.
Out in a long steep field of green, the still wind blow
ing incandescent rings and we were crouched low, like ani
mals. A sudden sharp scent, peaked like a memory. A styro
foam cup of coffee under a chemical sky, so out of synch with
today, 1 nuzzling the earth and tasting my blood. Stealth,
covert, we creep in the steamy tall grass, to the wooden fence.
Colonel Aureliano's coop. Under and into the yard. From
behind the palpitating gold tumbleweeds she leaps, stirring a
cacophony of feathers.
We kill a chicken for breakfast. She holds it and I
whack it with a stick until it dies. We don't have a knife. Roast
it whole and tear the smoking meat off with bent teeth, smack.
We drink stolen goat s milk and rancid water because we're
saving our money.
The hills burn with shrieking souls, and we scurry
about like rats, in search of steaming springs of blood.
By the precipice we go to for shade is the other gringo,
a sulky Midwesterner with long hair and short bangs, who's

been waiting in these parts. Up at the bar, they say he's been
waiting for a year, but whatever it is, it hasn't come. Hasn't
come, he says and smiles. I cluck my tongue to check to make
sure I have teeth. We're not too worried, neither one of us;
neither he his waiting nor I my teeth. While I shoot the shit
with this guy J.D., she weaves beads into my hair and clucks
and coos, and eventually I wave her off It's all right, all right.
It's ohfuckingkay.
J.D. has some weed and we smoke it, the orange
ember invisible in the heat of the day. The smoke fades like
evaporating water. He shows us some pictures of relics,
sketches he's drawn of things in the area. He carries them in
his pockets, and the paper is creased and worn down at the
edges like felt. Pictures of condors and monkeys float in his
drawings like spacemen. I hold one up to the sun thinking it
might catch flame. He begins to murmur to himself and
wanders away towards the buzzing flies and the ash-strewn
main road of town.
I look up, and the sky wavers and snaps back into
focus. Blood beats in my head; I need a drink. The bar isn't
open for four more hours.
The afternoon rolls by in great armies of clouds while

we bake our bread of blood and smack our lips. I stole his
Konica, 1 eventually tell her, and produce the gleaming artifact
from a bag. We can sell it and save the money.
l he bar smells like blood, and 1 inspect myself to
make sure I'm not bleeding. It could happen. Some old cowboy
once sat in this bar and shot a miner. Its the tin and the alco
hol, 1 think, the mix makes us crazy. That and 100 tender
stamped gold bars in his pants and the gun they say that drew
the fastest 1,000 times. Good that he shot a miner. Hes buried
near here, his bones and his gold.
1 think 1 once shot someone. Or was it that my friend
shot someone. ... It doesn't hurt so much if you use blanks,
that's what he said. 1 tip my tin cup to the dark Indio in the
cowboy hat who gives me a sullen look.
We roll dice in the corner, and mine keep coming up
doubles. She pays for the next round with pesos we found in
the parking lot. Do you see the puma over there? she asks me,
pointing to a smoky obscure region of the room. Its smoking
a cigar and cheating at cards. I can hardly make out the dark
hunched form.
After another round, she whispers more steaming
words into my ear, Let's go see que juega el puma. She drags me
by the sleeve out around to the dark, dusty field behind the
bar. A reverberating buzz of conversation fogs the air, and
smoke and steam spurt from the ground around a dense pack
of ink black men and women. Everyone is crouched around a
square where two golden-plumed cocks have at it.
