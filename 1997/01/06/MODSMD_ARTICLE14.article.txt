## Bubbe’s Revenge Reports of the death of Yiddish have been exaggerated 
### Kenneth Moss 
Those who keep a reasonably close eye on the mainstream
American press may have noted a recent spate of articles
concerning an unlikely — and seemingly anachronistic
— subject: Yiddish, the traditional language of Eastern
European Jews. Yiddish has earned several articles in The New
York Times, a piece in The New Yorker, one in The New Republic
and even a cover article in The New York limes Magazine. Each
of these pieces raises, directly or indirectly, the twin themes that
seem to dog discussion of Yiddish, namely, its supposedly

imminent death and, alternatively,
its supposedly imminent revival.
They range in tone from bemuse
ment to mockery to a sort of
restrained admiration. One article
concerns Yugntruf, a group of
Yiddish lovers in New York who
devote a great deal of energy and
time to studying and using
Yiddish in their everyday lives.
The author of the piece clearly
regards the whole matter as a joke,
structuring the fluff piece around
a mocking comparison of the par
ticipants in a Yugntruf trip to the
Natural History Museum in New
York (conducted entirely in
Yiddish) to the dinosaur bones
found therein. A second, written
by a prominent scholar who seems
to expend a good bit of energy
fighting the "contagion of incipi
ent interest in Yiddish among
young American Jews, dismisses
the idea of a Yiddish revival and
then laments the very idea of
bilingualism: Under the guise of

an article concerning Yiddish, this second article is really noth
ing more than an attack on . . . Spanish. A third examines the
aging of the editorial staff of the Yiddish-language Forverts in
an elegiac tone.
The most striking of these articles, The New York limes
Magazines "Yiddish Lives,' does its best to survey the question
in a reasonably fair manner. Yet it too cannot avoid the sort of
naive ethnography and commentary on the natives' that gives
tourism such a bad name. Imagine, it says young people from
English-speaking backgrounds learning and using Yiddish.
Who could they be? Turning an attentive ear to the same schol
ar described above, the article seems to suggest that in the final
analysis, 'those people' are outsiders, misfits, people who can't
find a place in the mainstream Jewish community and Israel

haters to boot. Ultimately, the article effaces the diversity of
those studying Yiddish by representing that study as a sphere of
the "marginal," of interest particularly to young gay New
Yorkers and the ultra-Orthodox, and then further invites the
"mainstream" reader to be complicit in regarding that falsely
posited marginality as something inherently objectionable.
In sum, most of these articles strike a pose of increduli
ty when discussing those people who seem to take an active
interest in learning and using Yiddish: Why would anyone

spend any time engaging with
Yiddish at all? What can it possi
bly offer? What motivates these
people anyway?
Ironically, I suspect that most
interested readers were left asking
more basic questions. What is
Yiddish? Why cant these people
decide whether it's dead or not?
Why, if it's alive, do some people
seem to want it dead, and, con
versely, why, it it's dead, would
anyone want to revive it? Why do
some people in the Jewish com
munity seem to regard this all as a
serious issue and others seem
totally oblivious to it?
Some non-Jewish readers may
have felt that they were catching a
glimpse of an ongoing debate
within the Jewish community. It
they had the misfortune to ask
their Jewish friends for guidance,
they probably discovered that, on
the contrary, the latter were just as
stumped as they were. Although
Yiddish has enjoyed serious dis

cussion in some parts of the community and its press, many in
the Jewish community remain wholly ignorant about both the
language and its current fortunes and misfortunes. 1 suspect
that on average, American Jews are as lacking in the basic
terms of the debate as anyone else.
This is not to say that many American Jews, who are
mostly — although not exclusively — descended from
Yiddish-speaking families, don't have opinions on the matter.
Indeed, nothing excites our baser impulses toward sidewalk
sociology quite like Yiddish. Ah, Yiddish, we'll say, 1 know
about Yiddish. Its a dialect of German isn't it? We spoke it
only in ghettos. A badge of shame. A backward tongue. Ah
Yiddish, it's the language of our ancestors' simple piety. It
never produced any literature or thought but it did inspire
