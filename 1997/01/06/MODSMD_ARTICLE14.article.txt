## Bubbe’s Revenge Reports of the death of Yiddish have been exaggerated 
### Kenneth Moss 
Those who keep a reasonably close eye on the mainstream
American press may have noted a recent spate of articles
concerning an unlikely — and seemingly anachronistic
— subject: Yiddish, the traditional language of Eastern
European Jews. Yiddish has earned several articles in The New
York Times, a piece in The New Yorker, one in The New Republic
and even a cover article in The New York limes Magazine. Each
of these pieces raises, directly or indirectly, the twin themes that
seem to dog discussion of Yiddish, namely, its supposedly

imminent death and, alternatively,
its supposedly imminent revival.
They range in tone from bemuse
ment to mockery to a sort of
restrained admiration. One article
concerns Yugntruf, a group of
Yiddish lovers in New York who
devote a great deal of energy and
time to studying and using
Yiddish in their everyday lives.
The author of the piece clearly
regards the whole matter as a joke,
structuring the fluff piece around
a mocking comparison of the par
ticipants in a Yugntruf trip to the
Natural History Museum in New
York (conducted entirely in
Yiddish) to the dinosaur bones
found therein. A second, written
by a prominent scholar who seems
to expend a good bit of energy
fighting the "contagion of incipi
ent interest in Yiddish among
young American Jews, dismisses
the idea of a Yiddish revival and
then laments the very idea of
bilingualism: Under the guise of

an article concerning Yiddish, this second article is really noth
ing more than an attack on . . . Spanish. A third examines the
aging of the editorial staff of the Yiddish-language Forverts in
an elegiac tone.
The most striking of these articles, The New York limes
Magazines "Yiddish Lives,' does its best to survey the question
in a reasonably fair manner. Yet it too cannot avoid the sort of
naive ethnography and commentary on the natives' that gives
tourism such a bad name. Imagine, it says young people from
English-speaking backgrounds learning and using Yiddish.
Who could they be? Turning an attentive ear to the same schol
ar described above, the article seems to suggest that in the final
analysis, 'those people' are outsiders, misfits, people who can't
find a place in the mainstream Jewish community and Israel

haters to boot. Ultimately, the article effaces the diversity of
those studying Yiddish by representing that study as a sphere of
the "marginal," of interest particularly to young gay New
Yorkers and the ultra-Orthodox, and then further invites the
"mainstream" reader to be complicit in regarding that falsely
posited marginality as something inherently objectionable.
In sum, most of these articles strike a pose of increduli
ty when discussing those people who seem to take an active
interest in learning and using Yiddish: Why would anyone

spend any time engaging with
Yiddish at all? What can it possi
bly offer? What motivates these
people anyway?
Ironically, I suspect that most
interested readers were left asking
more basic questions. What is
Yiddish? Why cant these people
decide whether it's dead or not?
Why, if it's alive, do some people
seem to want it dead, and, con
versely, why, it it's dead, would
anyone want to revive it? Why do
some people in the Jewish com
munity seem to regard this all as a
serious issue and others seem
totally oblivious to it?
Some non-Jewish readers may
have felt that they were catching a
glimpse of an ongoing debate
within the Jewish community. It
they had the misfortune to ask
their Jewish friends for guidance,
they probably discovered that, on
the contrary, the latter were just as
stumped as they were. Although
Yiddish has enjoyed serious dis

cussion in some parts of the community and its press, many in
the Jewish community remain wholly ignorant about both the
language and its current fortunes and misfortunes. 1 suspect
that on average, American Jews are as lacking in the basic
terms of the debate as anyone else.
This is not to say that many American Jews, who are
mostly — although not exclusively — descended from
Yiddish-speaking families, don't have opinions on the matter.
Indeed, nothing excites our baser impulses toward sidewalk
sociology quite like Yiddish. Ah, Yiddish, we'll say, 1 know
about Yiddish. Its a dialect of German isn't it? We spoke it
only in ghettos. A badge of shame. A backward tongue. Ah
Yiddish, it's the language of our ancestors' simple piety. It
never produced any literature or thought but it did inspire

Fiddler on the Roof and Yentl. Ah Yiddish, why, it's special
ly, indeed solely, designed tor humor. We had to make
jokes being oppressed and all, and oy vey, it's ugly but vat
a funny langvage!
Even those great many people who don't merit this
sort of treatment, those people who are genuinely curious
about Yiddish language and culture, who sometimes long
for it and seek it out in small ways and in great ones, who
study the language or pursue the traces of its culture avail
able through translation or through music, are often
drawn to Yiddish without knowing very much about it.
Some are drawn to it for the most personal of reasons: a
relative or loved one who speaks it or one who has left a
journal or a sheaf of poems. Others, like myself, come to
it with only the vaguest sense of its significance: We come
to it looking for something viral, a core of Jewish experi
ence that has somehow been lost, effaced from the con
sciousness of a community in danger of a fatal cultural
diminution.
Thus, Yiddish suffers under the weight of paradox:
it is simultaneously the object of the strongest feelings and
the deepest ignorance. At the risk of contributing to this
unfortunate condition, I'd like to offer a bit of informa
tion, from an informed but partisan and somewhat
impressionistic perspective, on the basics: What has
Yiddish been and why is it important? What is it today
and what can it be in the future? Why are people involved
in it today, who are these people, and what will come of
their involvement?
First, then, what is Yiddish and why should it be
accorded any historical importance?
Yiddish began to emerge a language roughly 1,000
years ago. It served as the language of everyday life for
much of what came to be called Ashkenazi Jewry, that is,
the Jewish civilization that developed throughout Western,
Central and Eastern Europe from the Netherlands and
contemporary France to the borders of Russia. This com
munity was by no means monolingual. On the contrary,
the spheres of culture which it valued most highly — the
interpretation and execution of religious and secular law,
written commentary on the foundational texts of tradi
tional Jewish life, prayer and even secular scholarship —
were for the most part in Hebrew, or rather loshn ha-koy
desh, the holy tongue,' a fusion of ancient Hebrew and
Aramaic.
In this context, the roles that Yiddish played in tra
ditional Ashkenazi civilization were complementary to the
spheres in which loshn ha-koydesh was the primary medi
um. Yiddish was the vernacular, the medium of everyday
speech among all speakers, including the greatest of schol
ars. It was also the oral medium of textual interpretation
and education. I hat is, although educated elites read and
wrote about the law and the holy books in loshn ha-koy
desh>, they explained, interpreted, and discussed those
works in Yiddish. And over time, Yiddish increasingly
gained official recognition in the institutional life of Jews.
Yiddish also came to serve increasingly as a written
medium for a variety of Jewish activities, particularly with
the development of the printing press in the 16th century.
On the one hand, Yiddish served as a medium for a good

deal of nonreligious popular literature: stories and novels
written in Yiddish circulated in numerous editions. On
the other hand, Yiddish played an increasingly large role in
the religious and spiritual lives of Ashkenazi Jews, particu
larly poorer men and most Jewish women, who were
denied access to systematic Hebrew education and hence
looked to an ever-growing body of translations and popu
lar religious works in Yiddish
Finally, Yiddish was the language of what we
might naively call "folk creativity:" It was in Yiddish that
Jews collectively created the vast body of folk tales, music,
theater, proverbs, jokes, riddles and children's games that
leave little trace of authorship and that are constantly
reworked by successive generations. In short, Yiddish was
the flesh and sinew of creative life for Eastern European
Jewry in its broad mass. To be sure, much of the creative
energy of traditional Jewry was devoted to the endless and
essential task of study and commentary in loshn ba-koy
desh. But at the same time, Yiddish came to serve as a pri
mary medium for the cultural lives of Ashkenazi Jews.
If Yiddish developed gradually in this pre-modern
period — let us say until the 1800 sit —it has undergone a
variety of far more radical changes over the past two cen
turies. As Jewish life has transformed itself in the modern
era, so too has Yiddish been transformed. It became a lan
guage suited to all cultural functions. Social transforma
tions, mass migration and self-emancipatory political
organization within the European Jewish community sus
tained the emergence of a mass press in Yiddish, the devel
opment a popular secular Jewish theater in Yiddish and
the formation of an organizational sphere that often
employed the language. With the rise of mass political and
cultural movements, Yiddish became a tool of political
organization, moral and ideological persuasion and, halt
ingly but with ever-increasing momentum, literary and
artistic experimentation.
With the advent of modern Jewish cultural nation
alism, Yiddish emerged as an object of value in and of
itself: now not only was it a language of choice for practi
cal reasons, it was also deemed an essential aspect of
European Jewish culture. Various groups committed to
Yiddish and Yiddish culture engaged in efforts to build an
entire institutional and cultural milieu in which Yiddish
would enjoy pride of place: They created modern schools
functioning entirely in Yiddish, journals and magazines for
every imaginable readership, and organizations committed
to fostering Yiddish through adult education and cultural
mobilization. Yiddish was, alongside Hebrew, the major
vehicle, both as form and to some degree as substance, of
Ashkenazi Jewish secularism and culturally self-aware
social radicalism in the early 20th century. Conversely, the
traditionalist sector of the Ashkenazi community also
looked to Yiddish to bolster its conservationist project:
thus, ultra-Orthodox activists in Eastern Europe created
their own full-fledged school system in Yiddish.
In the modern era, Yiddish was therefore a lan
guage of both cultural conservatism and cultural experi
mentation, valued by some and derided by others, but
used by every camp in Ashkenazi political and cultural life.
By the first decades of our centurv, it had become to a sub-
stantial degree the primary language of Jewish public and
private life in Eastern Europe, the United States, Canada
and Argentina. Yiddish played a role in virtually every
movement and project in modern Jewish life, from Jewish
feminism to cultural modernism to the reinforcement of
traditionalist Judaism. It is for these reasons that Yiddish
seems to bear such importance for so many of both its con
temporary enthusiasts and its contemporary detractors.
But as interesting as all of this may be, none of it
speaks directly to the question that purports to be at the
center of the current debate concerning the revival of
Yiddish, namely, what is its present condition and what are
its prospects? Both sides, it seems, agree that Yiddish is
dead, kaput, snuffed out, pushing up the daisies: The only
question, therefore, is will a group of committed (or mis
guided) young people revive it?
To the surprise of many (myself included), it turns
out that this shared assumption is simply incorrect, if by
"dead" we mean that there is no functioning speech com
munity for Yiddish, that it is not a language of daily usage
and interaction for a substantial number of people, etc. In
light of the Holocaust (more than three-quarters of the
murdered Jews were Yiddish-speakers), the de-
Yiddishization of Soviet Jewry and the decline ol the lan
guage in the United States, it is perhaps not surprising that
so many of us believe Yiddish to be dead. Announcements
of the death of Yiddish —imminent or already achieved
have been made repeatedly for more than a century,
sometimes by agonized supporters and sometimes by its
detractors.
Breast-beating and gloating aside, however, it turns
out that Yiddish, although in ill health, still lives. Yiddish
remains a major language of everyday use for several hun
dred thousand people; 200,000-plus reported Yiddish
usage in the 1990 US Census alone. It serves as the lan
guage for a full range of activities among various speech
communities, from official business of various sorts to
scholarship to the intimacies of everyday life. Books, jour
nals and newspapers of all sorts continue to appear. And in
some respects, limited but nonetheless significant and dif
ficult to ignore, Yiddish has begun to enjoy new attention
in sectors of the Jewish community where such interest
was quite unexpected.
We might say that there are two main constituen
cies at the center of contemporary Yiddish life. The demo
graphic majority of the active Yiddish speaking population
today are located in ultra-Orthodox society. A significant
proportion of ultra-Orthodox families, although by no
means all, raise their children with at least some Yiddish.
Many of the schools maintained by such communities
around the world are geared to teach Yiddish. Recent
research by scholars here and in Israel reveals an extraordi
nary fact: more children are being educated in iddish
today then was the case a generation ago, and most of
these children are receiving their education in the ultra-
Orthodox school systems. The eminent sociolinguist
Joshua Fishman notes that the demand for Yiddish teach
ers in these schools has increased so dramatically in recent
years that the seminar for Yiddish teachers in Jerusalem
can't keep up. These educational efforts in the home and

in schools are reinforced by a network of Yiddish institu
tions: newspapers serving specific communities, Yiddish
books geared toward ultra-Orthodox children, communal
self-help institutions, and even political activists and par
ties that politick in Yiddish.
The other core constituency that maintains
Yiddish as a living language are those mostly non-
Orthodox members of the Jewish community who, at least
to some degree, regard themselves as standing in the lin
eage of modern Yiddish and Yiddishist culture. Some of
these people would call themselves Yiddishists; others,
lovers of Yiddish. At the very core of this group stand those
who have cho

their children
and lead their
family lives in
Yiddish. This

Australia recently set up a Yiddish press, the Koala Press,
which has published several children's books; and the
Yugntruf organization in New York, has begun to raise
money for the publication of new and classic childrens
books. Around this core group are the various Yiddish
enthusiasts, young and old, Jewish and non-Jewish, who
lead part of their creative lives in Yiddish, attend Yiddish
retreats, form reading groups, tend World Wide Web sites
and so forth.
These enthusiasts nurture the language through a
variety of institutional means. These include dozens of
journals, including some that specifically solicit the work

of young writers. There are organizations such as Hemshekh
Dor in Israel and Yugntruf in the United States that are com
mitted to the fostering of Yiddish through local and regional
activities, ranging from conversation and reading circles to

There is
increasing
representa
tion of

Yiddish on the web, ranging from a site for beginning students
run by a group in Paris to a discussion group called Mendele
that deals with Yiddish-related issues in Yiddish and English.
One can even enjoy Yiddish radio programs in Israel, New
York, Boston and over shortwave. And there are schools and
college programs in Yiddish language, with the latter having
expanded substantially over the past few years. In recent years,
the long-running intensive summer program at the YIVO
Institute in New York has been joined by similar programs in
Oxford, Jerusalem, Paris and even in Kishinev in the former
Soviet Union.
Finally, at the outer edge of this institutional circle, we
find a growing number of Yiddish-related institutions and cul
tural milieus, most notably the National Yiddish Book Center,
the revival of the Jewish folk music form, klezmer and the
recent general upsurge of interest in Yiddish culture in trans
lation. All too often, these spheres of Yiddish-related activity
are mistaken for the locus of the so-called revival, and the var
ious opponents of the revivalist argument are at pains to note
how little actual Yiddish speaking is actually involved. That
being said, and speaking only impressionistically, it seems to
me that the experience of Yiddish culture in one arena has
attracted some real commitment to the real thing: many of my
friends from Yiddish-speaking circles were first attracted to the
language through literature courses, involvement in the
klezmer scene and so forth.
Who are these people? I think it's important to refrain
from facile generalization in the absence of adequate data.
Certainly, I want to avoid the fundamentally nasty sort of exoti
cism that afflicts several of the articles described above. All sorts
of people are involved in the "Yiddish revival: They are most
but not solely Jews, men and women, gay and straight, with
political views that run the gamut and Jewish identity commit
ments that range from Orthodox to secularist. Some are native
speakers, some come to Yiddish with some exposure from fam
ily and friends, some (like myself ) come to it with nothing but
a few words or with no background at all. Some, as I have sug
gested, come to see it as a central element of their lives, while
others move in and out of the core community.
In other words, the community of Yiddish lovers
cuts across all elements of the Jewish community and
beyond. I hat being said, it does seem that Yiddish exerts a
pull on many people who otherwise find little of interest in

the mainstream Jewish community.
Yiddish seems to awaken such interest because it seems
to promise access to a much broader, more encompassing and
also more internally variegated Jewish culture than that which
dominates American Jewish life today. In this respect, engage
ment with Yiddish tends to bring together people who other
wise seldom interact in the political, social and religious insti
tutions of mainstream Jewish life.
But what will come of all this activity? Some no doubt
regard it as misguided and sterile. Others regard it benignly. A
few commit themselves to it. What, then, are the prospects for
Yiddish? I should first note some further bright spots. First,
the Israeli government recently formally the recognized the
significance of Yiddish to Jewish life and culture. It will allow
students to study Yiddish as a serious subject in Israeli schools,
so now Yiddish can take a vaunted place beside the academic
pillar of French as a possible second language. More broadly,
Israel continue to be a center of Yiddish literary creativity and
cultural life, although the relationship between the dominant
Hebrew culture in Israel and that of Yiddish is vexed by a cen
tury of rancor.
Also of note is the marked interest in Yiddish among
many Jews of the former Soviet Union. Denied access to so
much of Jewish culture for so long, many Jews in the former
Soviet Union now seem eager to engage in study and restore
elements of Jewish identity long suppressed. Among the possi
bilities, of course, is Yiddish. And indeed, an organization of
Yiddish activists in the post-Soviet states has emerged; Yiddish
is being taught in Jewish schools; Yiddish clubs have appeared
in various cities; and a number of young Jewish scholars, flu
ent in Yiddish, have made their way West.
More broadly, it is important to acknowledge that
although Yiddish is clearly endangered, it is no more endan
gered, and indeed less endangered in many respects, than
numerous other minority languages worldwide. People
speak it, children are raised and educated in it and it has an
institutional density that sustains public discourse as well as
private interaction. To claim that it is dead is not to recog
nize a sad truth but to perpetuate a falsehood and to fore
close the possibility of a choice to learn the language and its
history. It is a cutting, terrible irony for those of us who have
fallen in love with Yiddish that one of the greatest challenges
remains not learning Yiddish and finding opportunities to
use it fruitfully, but simply convincing others that it is pos
sible to try. Yiddish is not dead. More to the point, its con
tinued existence and flourishing is not a matter of brute
sociological fact but of our will.
