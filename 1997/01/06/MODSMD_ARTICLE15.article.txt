## Downsize This! 
### Rudy Delson 
Michael Moore's new book Downsize This! begins with
the juxtaposition of two images. A photograph of the
husk of the federal building in Oklahoma City, famil
iar still after two years, with rubble spilling over the exposed
steel and concrete frame. A photograph of a half demolished
industrial building in Flint, Michigan, with similar rubble
similarly spilling over a similar steel and concrete frame. Above
the photographs a title asks, "What is terrorism?"
You expect, of course, to be off on another of Moore's
prankster missions. You expect something like Roger and Me,

Moore's 1989
documentary
film about try
ing to get
Roger Smith,
then-CEO of
C e n e r a 1
Motors, to pay

a visit to Flint to witness the human costs of GM's

plant closures there. You expect
something like TV Nation, Moore's
television scries, which consisted of
such devilish investigative vignettes
as Moore posing as an American
entrepreneur and seeing the hidden
camera reveal Mexican officials
delighted to help Americans save on
labor costs by closing up shop in the
States and moving production south
of the border.
Your expectations are high
because Moore couples his irrever
ence and chut/pah with a wily pro
gressive stance. Moore isn't just a
middle aged prank caller. He is
insightful and liberal, and his stunts
have a point. He stands up for labor
and job security and the social safe
ty net and corporate regulation,
despite how out of fashion they all
are at the moment. At its best,
Moore's social satire can be as funny
and biting as Swift.
But more often than not in
Downsize This!, Moore fails to
achieve his best. For example, on a
chapter on Moore's "Forbidden

Love for Hillary" (as in Clinton), he writes:
Let us piry the poor, frightened little men with their trem
bling penises, struggling to feel an inch better by putting

Hillary in her place, What must it be like to have a problem with your
dick? I'm not talking about those like me with a legitimate medical excuse.
I'm talking about all those poor bastards — the William Bennetts, the John
McLaughlins, the Rush Limbaughs — who immediately go limp at the
thought of a strong woman.
Moore's decision to include this in what began as a (somewhat)
feminist chapter is at best questionable and at worst tasteless.
However, at times his joking also becomes dangerous.

In a chapter entitled, "Germany Still Hasn't Paid for
Its Sins — and I Intend to Collect,' Moore gives an analysis of
the World War 11. He writes, "whether it's Bosnia of the
Middle East or skinheads terrorizing the residents of Idaho,
you can trace the roots of these conflicts back to what the
Germans did.' Such writing can only serve to foster historical
naivete. He goes on to say, remarking on Germany's post-war
economic recovery, "Can you imagine, as someone's grand
mother was being shoved into the ovens at Auschwitz, an angel
appearing to her and saying, 'Don't worry, the Germans are

going to be
rewarded
with so
much loot,
they wont
know what
to do with
It?

He then implies that the
Holocaust was a deliberate scheme
to improve Germany's postwar eco
nomic condition, calling Holocaust
reparations "not a had price to pay,
if it means you can end up one day
as the wealthiest nation on earth .
He writes, "I have never understood
why giving the Holocaust survivors
Palestine / Israel was such a great
gist. Have you ever been there? It's a
friggin' desert," continuing on "If
we had really wanted to do what was
right — and punish the Germans,
we should have given the survivors
the state of Bavaria. . . . Loosing
Bavaria to the Jews would have real
ly kicked those krauts where it
counted."
Not content to let it rest there,
Moore presses on to jokingly link
the presence of "thousands of Jewish
survivors" living in Florida with the
recent death of German tourists
there. He writes:
I think it's payback time. One by one, the
survivors are getting their revenge.
Someone with a sense of justice has armed
the elderlv residents of Fort Myers, and let

them loose to even the score. Who would have thought
that the Germans would make it this easy for them, fool
ishly moving to the area that contains the highest con
centration of Jews outside of New York? What were these

Jerries thinking — that the Moskowitzes were going to "live and let live"
and "turn the other cheek"? Obviously these Germans forgot about the tote
board. I say, arm every bingo player south ot Fort Lauderdale and let's cel
ebrate the Wend of World War 11. So — RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.
KLAUS!
What the chapter lacks in historical perspective this
passage makes up for in offensiveness. At least it is clear that
Moore is still joking. At times, his anger overwhelms his
