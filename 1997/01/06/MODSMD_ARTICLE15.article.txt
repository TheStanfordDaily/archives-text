## Downsize This! 
### Rudy Delson 
Michael Moore's new book Downsize This! begins with
the juxtaposition of two images. A photograph of the
husk of the federal building in Oklahoma City, famil
iar still after two years, with rubble spilling over the exposed
steel and concrete frame. A photograph of a half demolished
industrial building in Flint, Michigan, with similar rubble
similarly spilling over a similar steel and concrete frame. Above
the photographs a title asks, "What is terrorism?"
You expect, of course, to be off on another of Moore's
prankster missions. You expect something like Roger and Me,

Moore's 1989
documentary
film about try
ing to get
Roger Smith,
then-CEO of
C e n e r a 1
Motors, to pay

a visit to Flint to witness the human costs of GM's

plant closures there. You expect
something like TV Nation, Moore's
television scries, which consisted of
such devilish investigative vignettes
as Moore posing as an American
entrepreneur and seeing the hidden
camera reveal Mexican officials
delighted to help Americans save on
labor costs by closing up shop in the
States and moving production south
of the border.
Your expectations are high
because Moore couples his irrever
ence and chut/pah with a wily pro
gressive stance. Moore isn't just a
middle aged prank caller. He is
insightful and liberal, and his stunts
have a point. He stands up for labor
and job security and the social safe
ty net and corporate regulation,
despite how out of fashion they all
are at the moment. At its best,
Moore's social satire can be as funny
and biting as Swift.
But more often than not in
Downsize This!, Moore fails to
achieve his best. For example, on a
chapter on Moore's "Forbidden

Love for Hillary" (as in Clinton), he writes:
Let us piry the poor, frightened little men with their trem
bling penises, struggling to feel an inch better by putting

Hillary in her place, What must it be like to have a problem with your
dick? I'm not talking about those like me with a legitimate medical excuse.
I'm talking about all those poor bastards — the William Bennetts, the John
McLaughlins, the Rush Limbaughs — who immediately go limp at the
thought of a strong woman.
Moore's decision to include this in what began as a (somewhat)
feminist chapter is at best questionable and at worst tasteless.
However, at times his joking also becomes dangerous.

In a chapter entitled, "Germany Still Hasn't Paid for
Its Sins — and I Intend to Collect,' Moore gives an analysis of
the World War 11. He writes, "whether it's Bosnia of the
Middle East or skinheads terrorizing the residents of Idaho,
you can trace the roots of these conflicts back to what the
Germans did.' Such writing can only serve to foster historical
naivete. He goes on to say, remarking on Germany's post-war
economic recovery, "Can you imagine, as someone's grand
mother was being shoved into the ovens at Auschwitz, an angel
appearing to her and saying, 'Don't worry, the Germans are

going to be
rewarded
with so
much loot,
they wont
know what
to do with
It?

He then implies that the
Holocaust was a deliberate scheme
to improve Germany's postwar eco
nomic condition, calling Holocaust
reparations "not a had price to pay,
if it means you can end up one day
as the wealthiest nation on earth .
He writes, "I have never understood
why giving the Holocaust survivors
Palestine / Israel was such a great
gist. Have you ever been there? It's a
friggin' desert," continuing on "If
we had really wanted to do what was
right — and punish the Germans,
we should have given the survivors
the state of Bavaria. . . . Loosing
Bavaria to the Jews would have real
ly kicked those krauts where it
counted."
Not content to let it rest there,
Moore presses on to jokingly link
the presence of "thousands of Jewish
survivors" living in Florida with the
recent death of German tourists
there. He writes:
I think it's payback time. One by one, the
survivors are getting their revenge.
Someone with a sense of justice has armed
the elderlv residents of Fort Myers, and let

them loose to even the score. Who would have thought
that the Germans would make it this easy for them, fool
ishly moving to the area that contains the highest con
centration of Jews outside of New York? What were these

Jerries thinking — that the Moskowitzes were going to "live and let live"
and "turn the other cheek"? Obviously these Germans forgot about the tote
board. I say, arm every bingo player south ot Fort Lauderdale and let's cel
ebrate the Wend of World War 11. So — RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.
KLAUS!
What the chapter lacks in historical perspective this
passage makes up for in offensiveness. At least it is clear that
Moore is still joking. At times, his anger overwhelms his

out how your relatives connived their way into the United States. Why

That the hook stoops to this school-yard level is sad, because
Moore obviously wants to reach out to an audience that has
been abandoned by other liberal media outlets. To his credit,
he ends the book with a call for liberal activists to reach out to
their traditional constituency; he envisions the conservative
swing in American politics ending with massive popular orga-

against the
right-wing
corporate
and political
fat cats. To
that end, in
the last
chapter, he
recommends
the found
ing of a
national,
liberal mili
tia move
ment, with
the objective

of recapturing the Democratic party, increasing union mem
bership, boycotting corporate downsizers and so on. He
writes:
Be warned: My militia is no place for slackers or yuppies. There is no cap
puccino and no NPR. You will have to meet people who are uneducated,
crude and like to go line-dancing. You may have to go line-dancing. . . .
You must watch "Friends," "Baywatch," "Melrose Place," "Walker: Texas
Ranger" and other mass forms of popular entertainment so you know what
the people are tuned in to so you can tune in to them. No Sweet Honey
and the Rock concerts for at least six months. . . . You must listen to coun
try music. It is the voice of the people. Whether its Faith Hill singing
about battered women or Garth Brooks singing about gay rights, it is ten
times more progressive than anything you'll hear on a corporate rock sta
tion.

To a certain degree, Moore lives up to his own credo
of being tuned in: The book's longest and most insightful
chapter is dedicated to why O.J. Simpson is innocent. But
generally Moore doesn't provide much for his readers to take
to the disaffected. On the one hand, Downsize This! seldom
has anything new to say about American politics. For exam
ple, Moore's analysis of low voter turnout is: "Most citizens
don't vote — not because they're not hungry to participate but
because they've shown up and there's nothing but crap left on
the menu. Because it is almost impossible for a third party to
make it on the ballot and get proper media coverage, the voter
has nowhere else to go." On the other hand, Moore insults the
intelligence of the disenfranchised if he thinks that the reason
they have abandoned civic activism is because they haven't
been hearing the sorts of jeers that Moore offers up in this
book. No one, no matter how unsophisticated, is going to take
Moore seriously if, after a chapter attacking Buchanan for
xenophobia, Moore goes on to comment of Cuban immi
grants to Florida:
These Cuban exiles, for all their chest-thumping and terrorism, are really
just a bunch of wimps. That's right. Wimps. Need proof? For starters,
when you don't like the oppressor in your country, you stay there and try
to overthrow him. This can be done by force (American Revolution,
French Revolution) or by peaceful means (Gandhi in India or Mandela in
South Africa. Hut you don't just turn tail and run like these Cubans.
Despite the humor, Moore's rhetoric slips here. And,
in fact, a number of good opportunities slip away from him
because his humor prevents him from following through on
his insights. For example, in the Buchanan chapter, Moore
writes:
Immigrants, legal or illegal, work hard for their money, and they become
consumers and thus help to create jobs. It has struck me as quite odd that
right-wingers don't see how this benefits their corrupt system. Capitalists
thrive on exploiting labor — and what better group to exploit than a
bunch of undocumented Mexicans or Chinese?
Or, on a chapter on corporate welfare, he writes:
Each year, freeloading corporations grab nearly $170 billion in tax-funded
federal handouts. ... By contrast, all of our social programs combined . . .
amount to just $50 billion a year. . . . So why is it that when we sav the
word welfare, the first image that comes to mind is the single mother with
a half-dozen kids living in the inner city?
In both examples, Moore does not provide the analysis of the
way in which a corporate media buttresses a corporate state
that would offer an answer his questions.
These two examples are lamentably representative;
again and again, Moore uses his humor to hunt out an issue
and then lapses into satire without providing any in-depth
analysis or attempting to offer and potential solutions. This
is a problem endemic to satire; how to prevent the writing
from lapsing into perpetual parody, leaving the reader cyni
cal and apathetic. Moore struggles with this problem
throughout the book, and more often than not, fails to over
come it. Rather than contextualize the political, economic
and societal absurdities he lampoons, Moore just keeps
cracking jokes. When Moore suggests improving voter
turnout by replacing elections with monster truck races or
drive-by shooting contests, any laughter from the reader is
mixed with sighs that the author seems to think nothing can
be done to address the issue he's raised.
I he book does have its moments. In an unusually
informative chapter on American racial economic inequalities,
Moore makes a few suggestions for action, including that we
demand that universities divest from corporations whose
boards of directors are 100-percent white and that "college stu
dents [should] begin setting up mock tenement buildings on
their campuses and refuse to take them down until banks
change their discriminatory lending practices,' both of which
strike me as interesting ideas.
And Moore's humor does occasionally win out over
the generally mediocre content. In a chapter titled "What
America Needs Is a Makeover Moore suggests some new
names for the United States:
The Big One: Short, to the point. "Where you from?" "I'M FROM THE
BIG ONE!" Nobody messes with you then.
Land o' Sex: Sex sells. Will make everyone sorry they don't live here.
USAWorld: America as theme park. Who doesn't love a theme park? Rides
instead of crime! Clowns instead of elected leaders! Tokens instead of taxes!
It's a winner any way you look at it.
Americapalooza: Baby Boomers won't understand this one, but they'll be
dead soon anyway.
And new flags:
Head of Newt emitting radio beams from his ears. (Now, here's a flag they
can burn and feel good about it!)
Lots of big, scary guys. (The best defense is a strong offense.)
George Washington riding Barney. (Something old, something new.)
Praying hands holding a dollar bill. (Says we're a Christian country and we
got lors o* loot.)
Positions from the Kama Sutra. (Again, sex sells. Hindu images, though,
may be confusing.)
And he suggests replacing our national symbol, the bald eagle,
with the bald man.
Unfortunately, the bright moments are separated by
many disappointments. Moore's talent for witty satire is often
lost in Downsize I his! He writes as if he were shooting for tele
vision, eager to move on to the next joke and reluctant to pro
vide any thoughtful analysis of the complexities of the issues
he pokes fun at. On television such omissions are standard,
but in books they are unacceptable.
We might say Moore intended nothing more than to
produce an eclectic, innocuous collection of humor; indeed
the books subtitle, "Random Threats from an Unarmed
American' seems to suggest just that. If Moore intended his
book to be read like a Dave Barry collection, then these criti
cisms have been misplaced, l hey ought to be redirected at the
author himself, whom we know is capable of doing much
more.

against the
right-wing
corporate
and political
fat cats. To
that end, in
the last
chapter, he
recommends
the found
ing of a
national,
liberal mili
tia move
ment, with
the objective

of recapturing the Democratic party, increasing union mem
bership, boycotting corporate downsizers and so on. He
writes:
Be warned: My militia is no place for slackers or yuppies. There is no cap
puccino and no NPR. You will have to meet people who are uneducated,
crude and like to go line-dancing. You may have to go line-dancing. . . .
You must watch "Friends," "Baywatch," "Melrose Place," "Walker: Texas
Ranger" and other mass forms of popular entertainment so you know what
the people are tuned in to so you can tune in to them. No Sweet Honey
and the Rock concerts for at least six months. . . . You must listen to coun
try music. It is the voice of the people. Whether its Faith Hill singing
about battered women or Garth Brooks singing about gay rights, it is ten
times more progressive than anything you'll hear on a corporate rock sta
tion.

To a certain degree, Moore lives up to his own credo
of being tuned in: The book's longest and most insightful
chapter is dedicated to why O.J. Simpson is innocent. But
generally Moore doesn't provide much for his readers to take
to the disaffected. On the one hand, Downsize This! seldom
has anything new to say about American politics. For exam
ple, Moore's analysis of low voter turnout is: "Most citizens
don't vote — not because they're not hungry to participate but
because they've shown up and there's nothing but crap left on
the menu. Because it is almost impossible for a third party to
make it on the ballot and get proper media coverage, the voter
has nowhere else to go." On the other hand, Moore insults the
intelligence of the disenfranchised if he thinks that the reason
they have abandoned civic activism is because they haven't
been hearing the sorts of jeers that Moore offers up in this
book. No one, no matter how unsophisticated, is going to take
Moore seriously if, after a chapter attacking Buchanan for
xenophobia, Moore goes on to comment of Cuban immi
grants to Florida:
These Cuban exiles, for all their chest-thumping and terrorism, are really
just a bunch of wimps. That's right. Wimps. Need proof? For starters,
when you don't like the oppressor in your country, you stay there and try
to overthrow him. This can be done by force (American Revolution,
French Revolution) or by peaceful means (Gandhi in India or Mandela in
South Africa. Hut you don't just turn tail and run like these Cubans.
Despite the humor, Moore's rhetoric slips here. And,
in fact, a number of good opportunities slip away from him
because his humor prevents him from following through on
his insights. For example, in the Buchanan chapter, Moore
writes:
Immigrants, legal or illegal, work hard for their money, and they become
consumers and thus help to create jobs. It has struck me as quite odd that
right-wingers don't see how this benefits their corrupt system. Capitalists
thrive on exploiting labor — and what better group to exploit than a
bunch of undocumented Mexicans or Chinese?
Or, on a chapter on corporate welfare, he writes:
Each year, freeloading corporations grab nearly $170 billion in tax-funded
federal handouts. ... By contrast, all of our social programs combined . . .
amount to just $50 billion a year. . . . So why is it that when we sav the
word welfare, the first image that comes to mind is the single mother with
a half-dozen kids living in the inner city?
In both examples, Moore does not provide the analysis of the
way in which a corporate media buttresses a corporate state
that would offer an answer his questions.
These two examples are lamentably representative;
again and again, Moore uses his humor to hunt out an issue
and then lapses into satire without providing any in-depth
analysis or attempting to offer and potential solutions. This
is a problem endemic to satire; how to prevent the writing
from lapsing into perpetual parody, leaving the reader cyni
cal and apathetic. Moore struggles with this problem
throughout the book, and more often than not, fails to over
come it. Rather than contextualize the political, economic
and societal absurdities he lampoons, Moore just keeps
cracking jokes. When Moore suggests improving voter
turnout by replacing elections with monster truck races or
drive-by shooting contests, any laughter from the reader is
mixed with sighs that the author seems to think nothing can
be done to address the issue he's raised.
I he book does have its moments. In an unusually
informative chapter on American racial economic inequalities,
Moore makes a few suggestions for action, including that we
demand that universities divest from corporations whose
boards of directors are 100-percent white and that "college stu
dents [should] begin setting up mock tenement buildings on
their campuses and refuse to take them down until banks
change their discriminatory lending practices,' both of which
strike me as interesting ideas.
And Moore's humor does occasionally win out over
the generally mediocre content. In a chapter titled "What
America Needs Is a Makeover Moore suggests some new
names for the United States:
The Big One: Short, to the point. "Where you from?" "I'M FROM THE
BIG ONE!" Nobody messes with you then.
Land o' Sex: Sex sells. Will make everyone sorry they don't live here.
USAWorld: America as theme park. Who doesn't love a theme park? Rides
instead of crime! Clowns instead of elected leaders! Tokens instead of taxes!
It's a winner any way you look at it.
Americapalooza: Baby Boomers won't understand this one, but they'll be
dead soon anyway.
And new flags:
Head of Newt emitting radio beams from his ears. (Now, here's a flag they
can burn and feel good about it!)
Lots of big, scary guys. (The best defense is a strong offense.)
George Washington riding Barney. (Something old, something new.)
Praying hands holding a dollar bill. (Says we're a Christian country and we
got lors o* loot.)
Positions from the Kama Sutra. (Again, sex sells. Hindu images, though,
may be confusing.)
And he suggests replacing our national symbol, the bald eagle,
with the bald man.
Unfortunately, the bright moments are separated by
many disappointments. Moore's talent for witty satire is often
lost in Downsize I his! He writes as if he were shooting for tele
vision, eager to move on to the next joke and reluctant to pro
vide any thoughtful analysis of the complexities of the issues
he pokes fun at. On television such omissions are standard,
but in books they are unacceptable.
We might say Moore intended nothing more than to
produce an eclectic, innocuous collection of humor; indeed
the books subtitle, "Random Threats from an Unarmed
American' seems to suggest just that. If Moore intended his
book to be read like a Dave Barry collection, then these criti
cisms have been misplaced, l hey ought to be redirected at the
author himself, whom we know is capable of doing much
more.

Michael Moore's new book Downsize This! begins with
the juxtaposition of two images. A photograph of the
husk of the federal building in Oklahoma City, famil
iar still after two years, with rubble spilling over the exposed
steel and concrete frame. A photograph of a half demolished
industrial building in Flint, Michigan, with similar rubble
similarly spilling over a similar steel and concrete frame. Above
the photographs a title asks, "What is terrorism?"
You expect, of course, to be off on another of Moore's
prankster missions. You expect something like Roger and Me,

Moore's 1989
documentary
film about try
ing to get
Roger Smith,
then-CEO of
C e n e r a 1
Motors, to pay

a visit to Flint to witness the human costs of GM's

plant closures there. You expect
something like TV Nation, Moore's
television scries, which consisted of
such devilish investigative vignettes
as Moore posing as an American
entrepreneur and seeing the hidden
camera reveal Mexican officials
delighted to help Americans save on
labor costs by closing up shop in the
States and moving production south
of the border.
Your expectations are high
because Moore couples his irrever
ence and chut/pah with a wily pro
gressive stance. Moore isn't just a
middle aged prank caller. He is
insightful and liberal, and his stunts
have a point. He stands up for labor
and job security and the social safe
ty net and corporate regulation,
despite how out of fashion they all
are at the moment. At its best,
Moore's social satire can be as funny
and biting as Swift.
But more often than not in
Downsize This!, Moore fails to
achieve his best. For example, on a
chapter on Moore's "Forbidden

Love for Hillary" (as in Clinton), he writes:
Let us piry the poor, frightened little men with their trem
bling penises, struggling to feel an inch better by putting

Hillary in her place, What must it be like to have a problem with your
dick? I'm not talking about those like me with a legitimate medical excuse.
I'm talking about all those poor bastards — the William Bennetts, the John
McLaughlins, the Rush Limbaughs — who immediately go limp at the
thought of a strong woman.
Moore's decision to include this in what began as a (somewhat)
feminist chapter is at best questionable and at worst tasteless.
However, at times his joking also becomes dangerous.

In a chapter entitled, "Germany Still Hasn't Paid for
Its Sins — and I Intend to Collect,' Moore gives an analysis of
the World War 11. He writes, "whether it's Bosnia of the
Middle East or skinheads terrorizing the residents of Idaho,
you can trace the roots of these conflicts back to what the
Germans did.' Such writing can only serve to foster historical
naivete. He goes on to say, remarking on Germany's post-war
economic recovery, "Can you imagine, as someone's grand
mother was being shoved into the ovens at Auschwitz, an angel
appearing to her and saying, 'Don't worry, the Germans are

going to be
rewarded
with so
much loot,
they wont
know what
to do with
It?

He then implies that the
Holocaust was a deliberate scheme
to improve Germany's postwar eco
nomic condition, calling Holocaust
reparations "not a had price to pay,
if it means you can end up one day
as the wealthiest nation on earth .
He writes, "I have never understood
why giving the Holocaust survivors
Palestine / Israel was such a great
gist. Have you ever been there? It's a
friggin' desert," continuing on "If
we had really wanted to do what was
right — and punish the Germans,
we should have given the survivors
the state of Bavaria. . . . Loosing
Bavaria to the Jews would have real
ly kicked those krauts where it
counted."
Not content to let it rest there,
Moore presses on to jokingly link
the presence of "thousands of Jewish
survivors" living in Florida with the
recent death of German tourists
there. He writes:
I think it's payback time. One by one, the
survivors are getting their revenge.
Someone with a sense of justice has armed
the elderlv residents of Fort Myers, and let

them loose to even the score. Who would have thought
that the Germans would make it this easy for them, fool
ishly moving to the area that contains the highest con
centration of Jews outside of New York? What were these

Jerries thinking — that the Moskowitzes were going to "live and let live"
and "turn the other cheek"? Obviously these Germans forgot about the tote

intelligence of the disenfranchised if he thinks that the reason
they have abandoned civic activism is because they haven't
been hearing the sorts of jeers that Moore offers up in this
book. No one, no matter how unsophisticated, is going to take
Moore seriously if, after a chapter attacking Buchanan for
xenophobia, Moore goes on to comment of Cuban immi
grants to Florida:
These Cuban exiles, for all their chest-thumping and terrorism, are really
just a bunch of wimps. That's right. Wimps. Need proof? For starters,
when you don't like the oppressor in your country, you stay there and try
to overthrow him. This can be done by force (American Revolution,
French Revolution) or by peaceful means (Gandhi in India or Mandela in
South Africa. Hut you don't just turn tail and run like these Cubans.
Despite the humor, Moore's rhetoric slips here. And,
in fact, a number of good opportunities slip away from him
because his humor prevents him from following through on
his insights. For example, in the Buchanan chapter, Moore
writes:
Immigrants, legal or illegal, work hard for their money, and they become
consumers and thus help to create jobs. It has struck me as quite odd that
right-wingers don't see how this benefits their corrupt system. Capitalists
thrive on exploiting labor — and what better group to exploit than a
bunch of undocumented Mexicans or Chinese?
Or, on a chapter on corporate welfare, he writes:
Each year, freeloading corporations grab nearly $170 billion in tax-funded
federal handouts. ... By contrast, all of our social programs combined . . .
amount to just $50 billion a year. . . . So why is it that when we sav the
word welfare, the first image that comes to mind is the single mother with
a half-dozen kids living in the inner city?
In both examples, Moore does not provide the analysis of the
way in which a corporate media buttresses a corporate state
that would offer an answer his questions.
These two examples are lamentably representative;
again and again, Moore uses his humor to hunt out an issue
and then lapses into satire without providing any in-depth
analysis or attempting to offer and potential solutions. This
is a problem endemic to satire; how to prevent the writing
from lapsing into perpetual parody, leaving the reader cyni
cal and apathetic. Moore struggles with this problem
throughout the book, and more often than not, fails to over
come it. Rather than contextualize the political, economic
and societal absurdities he lampoons, Moore just keeps
cracking jokes. When Moore suggests improving voter
turnout by replacing elections with monster truck races or
drive-by shooting contests, any laughter from the reader is
mixed with sighs that the author seems to think nothing can
be done to address the issue he's raised.
I he book does have its moments. In an unusually
informative chapter on American racial economic inequalities,
Moore makes a few suggestions for action, including that we
demand that universities divest from corporations whose
boards of directors are 100-percent white and that "college stu
dents [should] begin setting up mock tenement buildings on
their campuses and refuse to take them down until banks
change their discriminatory lending practices,' both of which
strike me as interesting ideas.
And Moore's humor does occasionally win out over
the generally mediocre content. In a chapter titled "What
America Needs Is a Makeover Moore suggests some new
names for the United States:
The Big One: Short, to the point. "Where you from?" "I'M FROM THE
BIG ONE!" Nobody messes with you then.
Land o' Sex: Sex sells. Will make everyone sorry they don't live here.
USAWorld: America as theme park. Who doesn't love a theme park? Rides
instead of crime! Clowns instead of elected leaders! Tokens instead of taxes!
It's a winner any way you look at it.
Americapalooza: Baby Boomers won't understand this one, but they'll be
dead soon anyway.
And new flags:
Head of Newt emitting radio beams from his ears. (Now, here's a flag they
can burn and feel good about it!)
Lots of big, scary guys. (The best defense is a strong offense.)
George Washington riding Barney. (Something old, something new.)
Praying hands holding a dollar bill. (Says we're a Christian country and we
got lors o* loot.)
Positions from the Kama Sutra. (Again, sex sells. Hindu images, though,
may be confusing.)
And he suggests replacing our national symbol, the bald eagle,
with the bald man.
Unfortunately, the bright moments are separated by
many disappointments. Moore's talent for witty satire is often
lost in Downsize I his! He writes as if he were shooting for tele
vision, eager to move on to the next joke and reluctant to pro
vide any thoughtful analysis of the complexities of the issues
he pokes fun at. On television such omissions are standard,
but in books they are unacceptable.
We might say Moore intended nothing more than to
produce an eclectic, innocuous collection of humor; indeed
the books subtitle, "Random Threats from an Unarmed
American' seems to suggest just that. If Moore intended his
book to be read like a Dave Barry collection, then these criti
cisms have been misplaced, l hey ought to be redirected at the
author himself, whom we know is capable of doing much
more.
