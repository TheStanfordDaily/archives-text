### 
Two lovers in an Irish wood at dusk
are hiding from an old and vengeful king.
The wood is full of sycamore and elder.
And set in that nowhere which is anywhere:
And let the woman be slender. As I was at twenty.
And red-haired. As I was until recently.
They cling together listening to his hounds
get nearer in the twilight and the spring
thickets fill with the sound of danger.
Blossoms are the colour of blood and capture.
We can be safe, they say. We can start
a rumour in the wood to reach the king —
that she has lost her youth. That her mouth is
cold. That this woman is growing older.
They do not know. They have no idea
how much of this: the ocean-coloured peace
of the dusk, and the way legend stresses it,
depend on her to be young and beautiful.
They start the rumour in the last light.
But the light changes. The distance shudders.
And suddenly what is happening is not
what happens to the lovers in the wood
or an angry king and his frantic hounds—
and the tricks and kisses he has planned.
But what is whispering out of sycamores.
And over river-noise. And bypasses harebells
and blue air. And is overheard by the birds
which are the elements of logic in an early
spring. And is travelling to enter a suburb
at the foothills of the mountains in Dublin.
And a garden with jasmine and poplars. And
a table at which I am writing. I am writing
a woman out of legend. I am thinking
how new it is—this story. How hard it will be to tell.
