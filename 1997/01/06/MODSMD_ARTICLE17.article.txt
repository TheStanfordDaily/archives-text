# Eunuchs and Gypsies: Two New Anthropologies
## 
### 
Two recently published and widely reviewed hooks
attempt to offer the American reader quick and infor
mative glimpses into the ancient histories and every
day lives of two seemingly "exotic' and "inscrutable" cultures.
Each book examines a culture generally assumed to be little
more than a fading remnant of the ancient past, as it confronts
the late 20th century's industrialized and information
economies. In her powerfully absorbing book, Bury Me
Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey, Isabel Fonseca writes

about her travels among the
oppressed and poverty-stricken
Gypsies, also known as the Roma or
Rom, of Eastern Europe in the face
of a crumbling Iron Curtain and
rapidly developing markets. Zia
Jaffrey, in her much reviewed Ihe
Invisibles: A Tale of the Eunuchs of
India, uncovers the contemporary
urban circumstances of the hjiras, or
eunuchs, who have traditionally
served a ritual function in Indian
village society.
As Fonseca details, the Gypsies
have long been a nomadic people
scattered throughout Eastern and
Western Europe. Linguistic scholars
generally trace the origins of the
Rom language back to Indian lan
guages, estimating that a migration
in the ninth or 10th century
brought the ancestors of modern
Gypsies from India to Europe. At
first enslaved, the Gypsies eventual
ly developed a distinctive society of
small, tenuously connected
nomadic bands offering such spe
cialized services as metalworking or
music performance to the villages
through which they passed. After
World War 11, however, thousands
of Gypsies found themselves isolated

in Eastern Bloc countries under
oppressive dictatorships bent on absorbing these nomadic peo
ples into mainstream society. Many Gypsies did assimilate,
moving into government housing and government jobs, but
others who refused to do so fell into poverty without the liveli
hood gained from their traveling.
Since the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe,
restrictions on travel between the East and West have eased

and record numbers of Gypsies have fled the poverty of
Eastern Europe to become fixtures on the streets of Western
European cities like Paris, Milan and Rome. Irue to stereo
type, Gypsies in Western Europe are often involved in petty
crime, including smuggling and pickpocketing. But, while it
acknowledges that element of Gypsy culture, Fonsecas book
also searches out the role the Gypsies of Central and Eastern
Europe currently play in the often primitive economic trade
developing in formerly planned economies. While American
companies enter the soon-to-be booming markets of wealthi
er Eastern European countries such as the Czech Republic and
Poland, it may be Gypsies who play a significant role in the
less formal markets of the poorer countries of Albania anil
Bulgaria.
Fonseca is careful to place herself within her story, not
ing the role she herself played in the events she saw unfolding.
In fact, Fonsecas book is unabashedly her story of several years
spent trying to discover and understand these people. A.s she
said on a radio program shortly after the book was published,
she doesn't want to be "a kind of dry academic;" including hei
personal journey in her depiction of the Gypsies allows her to
both stay true to her observations and create a work that is eas
ily accessible and interesting to her readers.
Fonseca writes beautifully and evocatively; describing
her first journey with a man she had hired to be her guide, she
writes, "Six weeks after our Paris meeting we shared a taxi. A
taxi from Bulgaria to Albania: 12 hot hours across the memo
ry of Yugoslavia." Sometimes, though, the writing seems too
beautiful, too haunting, too caught up in its own twists of lan
guage. Describing the border she reaches once the taxi ride has
ended, she says, "Like all border posts, the frontier near Struga
in Macedonia is chaotic and dull, littered with a ragged popu
lation of shufflers, pushers, and peddlers, indolent and inso
lent, waiting for rejection and a long-familiar journey in the
wrong direction."
Language like this often made me wonder how much
this book wn r about the Gypsies and how much it was in fact
about Fonseca herself. Fonseca even describes her earliest
motivations for studying Gypsies, going so far as to reveal her
first tentative hypotheses. In her original thinking, she relates,
she saw the Gypsies as the "new Jews of Europe," another
group of oppressed wanderers without homeland or protec
tion. Of course, as Fonseca herself readily admits, the situation
between the Jews of pre-modern Europe and the persecuted
Gypsies of today is hardly an easy parallel; the high rates of lit
eracy and scholarship among even the extremely poor Jewish
communities in the 16th and 17th centuries stands in sharp
contrast to the situation for most Rom in Eastern Europe
today, with few children in school and little contact even

between different Gypsy communities.
At a certain point, however, Fonseca stops short and
refuses to reveal more about herself or her motivations; the
focus of this story is, in the end, the Gypsies among whom
Fonseca lived and traveled for many months.
Quite different is Zia Jaffrey's recently released The

Invisibles: A lale of the Eunuchs of
India, which seems far more focused
on the author than on its supposed
subjects. Jaffrey's tale is a densely writ
ten narrative that attempts to divide
truth from myth in the stories and
legends surrounding the hjiras, who
ritually attend weddings and births in
India. Alternately seen as signs of
good luck and trouble, the eunuchs,
who dress at women, seem to appear
miraculously at the family occasions.
Whereas they once lived in small vil
lages and simply came to weddings as
a matter of course, in todays large
cities the hjiras must be summoned to
each occasion, usually by friends of
friends of the wedding family.
Swirling their skirts, the hjiras stand
in doorways in tattered saris and,
while singing or making music on
beat-up tambourines, jeer at and
insult the men, flatter the women and
generally make a ruckus. The host
then pays the hjiras and they go away,
quickly forgotten by the rest of soci
ety until they arc once again needed
at a family ceremony.
While some hjiras are not

eunuchs but in fact hermaphrodites,
most are castrated males, either men who ran away from home
as young boys and consented to the castration as a means of
entering the hjira community or boys who were forced to
undergo the ceremony (stories of abductions abound, but no
one is sure if they more myth or fact). Hjiras, who were used
originally in large households to take care of children, may or
may not work as prostitutes now. Some are Muslim, some
Hindu, although it seems they live in communal houses
together regardless of religion or caste.
As much as it is a story about eunuchs in India, I he
Invisibles is also very much the story of Jaffrey's own search
for more information about the hjiras; in fact, by going into
such detail about each trip and interview that took place,
Jaffreys book almost seems as if it is about the making of
another book.
The story of Jaffrey's own journey to India and the
wedding at which she first began to ask questions about the
hjiras, is compelling, and Jaffreys descriptions of her familys
reactions to her growing interest in eunuchs are bitingly funny.
Ultimately, however, Jaffrey's hook left me feeling unsatisfied
and vaguely manipulated, partly because it failed to fully
address either the history of the eunuchs or the role of the
author herself in India. Although the subtitle describes this as
a tale of the eunuchs of India and the book jacket declares it

the first definitive work on eunuchs, Jaffrey not only refers to
another book that is a "history of eunuchs in India" but tends
to simply recreate interviews, offering little analysis or cohe
sion; the reader is left feeling more confused than informed.
The book also skirts around the authors experiences as an
American in India researching a somewhat taboo subject; I felt

this could have been a powerful book in
and of itself. Especially because Zia
Jaffrey is the daughter of Madhur Jaffrey,
a writer of extremely popular Indian
cookbooks who is famous for introduc
ing British and Americans to the food
and culture of an entire subcontinent, I
wondered what role she envisioned for
herself in trying to explain a subculture
that many Indians cannot understand to
a U.S. audience.
Both Jaffrey and Fonseca have chosen
"exotic" groups to study, groups that are
known in no small part for supposedly
high levels of secrecy and deception.
Even as they celebrate this deception as a
sort of making of fictions, both authors
also describe their frustration with the
differing accounts and exaggerated sto
ries they have been given. Perhaps this
inability to fully trust their subjects part
ly explains the style of these books and
the emphasis both authors place on their
roles as participants as well as observers.
It is clear that both authors are worried
about their positions as Americans and
wary about relaying everything they have
been told to the United States, with all of
its American prejudices. Of course

Fonseca and JafFrey should be wary of
the role they play as Americans in a foreign culture and, as
they call themselves, "amateur anthropologists." Such a term
seems to belittle the practice of good anthropology, as if the
mere recording of observations can provide anthropological
insight. 1 also cannot help but wonder if both authors, Jaffrey
especially, are being too careful: telling us only their own story
because they know that story is unbiased, free from the poten
tial taint of the Western observer s gaze. In Fonsecas case, this
approach works because of her skill as a writer; her personal
stories allow real characters to emerge from the book's statistics
and speak in their own voices. As for Jaffrey, perhaps her book,
and its modest success in the reviews and the bookstores, will
inspire the trained historian and the trained anthropologist to
venture to India.

er Eastern European countries such as the Czech Republic and
Poland, it may be Gypsies who play a significant role in the
less formal markets of the poorer countries of Albania anil
Bulgaria.
Fonseca is careful to place herself within her story, not
ing the role she herself played in the events she saw unfolding.
In fact, Fonsecas book is unabashedly her story of several years
spent trying to discover and understand these people. A.s she
said on a radio program shortly after the book was published,
she doesn't want to be "a kind of dry academic;" including hei
personal journey in her depiction of the Gypsies allows her to
both stay true to her observations and create a work that is eas
ily accessible and interesting to her readers.
Fonseca writes beautifully and evocatively; describing
her first journey with a man she had hired to be her guide, she
writes, "Six weeks after our Paris meeting we shared a taxi. A
taxi from Bulgaria to Albania: 12 hot hours across the memo
ry of Yugoslavia." Sometimes, though, the writing seems too
beautiful, too haunting, too caught up in its own twists of lan
guage. Describing the border she reaches once the taxi ride has
ended, she says, "Like all border posts, the frontier near Struga
in Macedonia is chaotic and dull, littered with a ragged popu
lation of shufflers, pushers, and peddlers, indolent and inso
lent, waiting for rejection and a long-familiar journey in the
wrong direction."
Language like this often made me wonder how much
this book wn r about the Gypsies and how much it was in fact
about Fonseca herself. Fonseca even describes her earliest
motivations for studying Gypsies, going so far as to reveal her
first tentative hypotheses. In her original thinking, she relates,
she saw the Gypsies as the "new Jews of Europe," another
group of oppressed wanderers without homeland or protec
tion. Of course, as Fonseca herself readily admits, the situation
between the Jews of pre-modern Europe and the persecuted
Gypsies of today is hardly an easy parallel; the high rates of lit
eracy and scholarship among even the extremely poor Jewish
communities in the 16th and 17th centuries stands in sharp
contrast to the situation for most Rom in Eastern Europe
today, with few children in school and little contact even

between different Gypsy communities.
At a certain point, however, Fonseca stops short and
refuses to reveal more about herself or her motivations; the
focus of this story is, in the end, the Gypsies among whom
Fonseca lived and traveled for many months.
Quite different is Zia Jaffrey's recently released The

Invisibles: A lale of the Eunuchs of
India, which seems far more focused
on the author than on its supposed
subjects. Jaffrey's tale is a densely writ
ten narrative that attempts to divide
truth from myth in the stories and
legends surrounding the hjiras, who
ritually attend weddings and births in
India. Alternately seen as signs of
good luck and trouble, the eunuchs,
who dress at women, seem to appear
miraculously at the family occasions.
Whereas they once lived in small vil
lages and simply came to weddings as
a matter of course, in todays large
cities the hjiras must be summoned to
each occasion, usually by friends of
friends of the wedding family.
Swirling their skirts, the hjiras stand
in doorways in tattered saris and,
while singing or making music on
beat-up tambourines, jeer at and
insult the men, flatter the women and
generally make a ruckus. The host
then pays the hjiras and they go away,
quickly forgotten by the rest of soci
ety until they arc once again needed
at a family ceremony.
While some hjiras are not

eunuchs but in fact hermaphrodites,
most are castrated males, either men who ran away from home
as young boys and consented to the castration as a means of
entering the hjira community or boys who were forced to
undergo the ceremony (stories of abductions abound, but no
one is sure if they more myth or fact). Hjiras, who were used
originally in large households to take care of children, may or
may not work as prostitutes now. Some are Muslim, some
Hindu, although it seems they live in communal houses
together regardless of religion or caste.
As much as it is a story about eunuchs in India, I he
Invisibles is also very much the story of Jaffrey's own search
for more information about the hjiras; in fact, by going into
such detail about each trip and interview that took place,
Jaffreys book almost seems as if it is about the making of
another book.
The story of Jaffrey's own journey to India and the
wedding at which she first began to ask questions about the
hjiras, is compelling, and Jaffreys descriptions of her familys
reactions to her growing interest in eunuchs are bitingly funny.
Ultimately, however, Jaffrey's hook left me feeling unsatisfied
and vaguely manipulated, partly because it failed to fully
address either the history of the eunuchs or the role of the
author herself in India. Although the subtitle describes this as
a tale of the eunuchs of India and the book jacket declares it

the first definitive work on eunuchs, Jaffrey not only refers to
another book that is a "history of eunuchs in India" but tends
to simply recreate interviews, offering little analysis or cohe
sion; the reader is left feeling more confused than informed.
The book also skirts around the authors experiences as an
American in India researching a somewhat taboo subject; I felt

this could have been a powerful book in
and of itself. Especially because Zia
Jaffrey is the daughter of Madhur Jaffrey,
a writer of extremely popular Indian
cookbooks who is famous for introduc
ing British and Americans to the food
and culture of an entire subcontinent, I
wondered what role she envisioned for
herself in trying to explain a subculture
that many Indians cannot understand to
a U.S. audience.
Both Jaffrey and Fonseca have chosen
"exotic" groups to study, groups that are
known in no small part for supposedly
high levels of secrecy and deception.
Even as they celebrate this deception as a
sort of making of fictions, both authors
also describe their frustration with the
differing accounts and exaggerated sto
ries they have been given. Perhaps this
inability to fully trust their subjects part
ly explains the style of these books and
the emphasis both authors place on their
roles as participants as well as observers.
It is clear that both authors are worried
about their positions as Americans and
wary about relaying everything they have
been told to the United States, with all of
its American prejudices. Of course

Fonseca and JafFrey should be wary of
the role they play as Americans in a foreign culture and, as
they call themselves, "amateur anthropologists." Such a term
seems to belittle the practice of good anthropology, as if the
mere recording of observations can provide anthropological
insight. 1 also cannot help but wonder if both authors, Jaffrey
especially, are being too careful: telling us only their own story
because they know that story is unbiased, free from the poten
tial taint of the Western observer s gaze. In Fonsecas case, this
approach works because of her skill as a writer; her personal
stories allow real characters to emerge from the book's statistics
and speak in their own voices. As for Jaffrey, perhaps her book,
and its modest success in the reviews and the bookstores, will
inspire the trained historian and the trained anthropologist to
venture to India.

Bury Me Standing: Vhe Gypsies and Their
Journey
By Isabel Fonseca
Knopf, 1995
$13.00
Two recently published and widely reviewed hooks
attempt to offer the American reader quick and infor
mative glimpses into the ancient histories and every
day lives of two seemingly "exotic' and "inscrutable" cultures.
Each book examines a culture generally assumed to be little
more than a fading remnant of the ancient past, as it confronts
the late 20th century's industrialized and information
economies. In her powerfully absorbing book, Bury Me
Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey, Isabel Fonseca writes

about her travels among the
oppressed and poverty-stricken
Gypsies, also known as the Roma or
Rom, of Eastern Europe in the face
of a crumbling Iron Curtain and
rapidly developing markets. Zia
Jaffrey, in her much reviewed Ihe
Invisibles: A Tale of the Eunuchs of
India, uncovers the contemporary
urban circumstances of the hjiras, or
eunuchs, who have traditionally
served a ritual function in Indian
village society.
As Fonseca details, the Gypsies
have long been a nomadic people
scattered throughout Eastern and
Western Europe. Linguistic scholars
generally trace the origins of the
Rom language back to Indian lan
guages, estimating that a migration
in the ninth or 10th century
brought the ancestors of modern
Gypsies from India to Europe. At
first enslaved, the Gypsies eventual
ly developed a distinctive society of
small, tenuously connected
nomadic bands offering such spe
cialized services as metalworking or
music performance to the villages
through which they passed. After
World War 11, however, thousands
of Gypsies found themselves isolated

in Eastern Bloc countries under
oppressive dictatorships bent on absorbing these nomadic peo
ples into mainstream society. Many Gypsies did assimilate,
moving into government housing and government jobs, but
others who refused to do so fell into poverty without the liveli
hood gained from their traveling.
Since the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe,
restrictions on travel between the East and West have eased

and record numbers of Gypsies have fled the poverty of
Eastern Europe to become fixtures on the streets of Western
European cities like Paris, Milan and Rome. Irue to stereo
type, Gypsies in Western Europe are often involved in petty
crime, including smuggling and pickpocketing. But, while it
acknowledges that element of Gypsy culture, Fonsecas book
also searches out the role the Gypsies of Central and Eastern
Europe currently play in the often primitive economic trade
developing in formerly planned economies. While American
companies enter the soon-to-be booming markets of wealthi
er Eastern European countries such as the Czech Republic and
Poland, it may be Gypsies who play a significant role in the
less formal markets of the poorer countries of Albania anil
Bulgaria.
