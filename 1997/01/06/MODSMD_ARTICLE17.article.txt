# Eunuchs and Gypsies: Two New Anthropologies
## 
### 
Two recently published and widely reviewed hooks
attempt to offer the American reader quick and infor
mative glimpses into the ancient histories and every
day lives of two seemingly "exotic' and "inscrutable" cultures.
Each book examines a culture generally assumed to be little
more than a fading remnant of the ancient past, as it confronts
the late 20th century's industrialized and information
economies. In her powerfully absorbing book, Bury Me
Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey, Isabel Fonseca writes

about her travels among the
oppressed and poverty-stricken
Gypsies, also known as the Roma or
Rom, of Eastern Europe in the face
of a crumbling Iron Curtain and
rapidly developing markets. Zia
Jaffrey, in her much reviewed Ihe
Invisibles: A Tale of the Eunuchs of
India, uncovers the contemporary
urban circumstances of the hjiras, or
eunuchs, who have traditionally
served a ritual function in Indian
village society.
As Fonseca details, the Gypsies
have long been a nomadic people
scattered throughout Eastern and
Western Europe. Linguistic scholars
generally trace the origins of the
Rom language back to Indian lan
guages, estimating that a migration
in the ninth or 10th century
brought the ancestors of modern
Gypsies from India to Europe. At
first enslaved, the Gypsies eventual
ly developed a distinctive society of
small, tenuously connected
nomadic bands offering such spe
cialized services as metalworking or
music performance to the villages
through which they passed. After
World War 11, however, thousands
of Gypsies found themselves isolated

in Eastern Bloc countries under
oppressive dictatorships bent on absorbing these nomadic peo
ples into mainstream society. Many Gypsies did assimilate,
moving into government housing and government jobs, but
others who refused to do so fell into poverty without the liveli
hood gained from their traveling.
Since the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe,
restrictions on travel between the East and West have eased

and record numbers of Gypsies have fled the poverty of
Eastern Europe to become fixtures on the streets of Western
European cities like Paris, Milan and Rome. Irue to stereo
type, Gypsies in Western Europe are often involved in petty
crime, including smuggling and pickpocketing. But, while it
acknowledges that element of Gypsy culture, Fonsecas book
also searches out the role the Gypsies of Central and Eastern
Europe currently play in the often primitive economic trade
developing in formerly planned economies. While American
companies enter the soon-to-be booming markets of wealthi
er Eastern European countries such as the Czech Republic and
Poland, it may be Gypsies who play a significant role in the
less formal markets of the poorer countries of Albania anil
Bulgaria.
Fonseca is careful to place herself within her story, not
ing the role she herself played in the events she saw unfolding.
In fact, Fonsecas book is unabashedly her story of several years
spent trying to discover and understand these people. A.s she
said on a radio program shortly after the book was published,
she doesn't want to be "a kind of dry academic;" including hei
personal journey in her depiction of the Gypsies allows her to
both stay true to her observations and create a work that is eas
ily accessible and interesting to her readers.
Fonseca writes beautifully and evocatively; describing
her first journey with a man she had hired to be her guide, she
writes, "Six weeks after our Paris meeting we shared a taxi. A
taxi from Bulgaria to Albania: 12 hot hours across the memo
ry of Yugoslavia." Sometimes, though, the writing seems too
beautiful, too haunting, too caught up in its own twists of lan
guage. Describing the border she reaches once the taxi ride has
ended, she says, "Like all border posts, the frontier near Struga
in Macedonia is chaotic and dull, littered with a ragged popu
lation of shufflers, pushers, and peddlers, indolent and inso
lent, waiting for rejection and a long-familiar journey in the
wrong direction."
Language like this often made me wonder how much
this book wn r about the Gypsies and how much it was in fact
about Fonseca herself. Fonseca even describes her earliest
motivations for studying Gypsies, going so far as to reveal her
first tentative hypotheses. In her original thinking, she relates,
she saw the Gypsies as the "new Jews of Europe," another
group of oppressed wanderers without homeland or protec
tion. Of course, as Fonseca herself readily admits, the situation
between the Jews of pre-modern Europe and the persecuted
Gypsies of today is hardly an easy parallel; the high rates of lit
eracy and scholarship among even the extremely poor Jewish
communities in the 16th and 17th centuries stands in sharp
contrast to the situation for most Rom in Eastern Europe
today, with few children in school and little contact even
