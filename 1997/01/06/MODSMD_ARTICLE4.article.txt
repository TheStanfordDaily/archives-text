# Editor's Note
## 
### 
Our cover story, the first of a two
part series on local history, is an
examination of labor relations
in Silicon Valley. It is one of the supreme
ironies of existence that one can live in a
place for a long time — in the case of stu
dents, several years — and know essen
tially nothing about the forces and events
that created it. And it is also ironic that
the inevitable attrition of students means
that the University's institutional memo

ry, and the memory of its role in creating local history, is
uniquely short. Chuck Carlsons piece uncovers a hidden his
tory of the area we live in and too often fail to think about. His
story will be followed in the spring by Allison Posts essay on
the history of East Palo Alto.

and intellectually rigorous of the conservative critics of affir
mative action, offers his analysis of race and the 1996 presi
dential campaign. Casey Harmon reinterprets Stanford's leg
endary Wallace Stegner. And editor emeritus Romesh Ratnesar
returns to the pages of Arcade to pen a critique of the much
ballyhooed campaign against U.S. News & World Reports col
lege rankings.
This issue —mv last as editor in chief— also carries a
personal significance. I he idea for Arcade arose more than two
years ago, when a group of friends decided to address what
they perceived as a serious absence at their University — an
absence of a nonpartisan forum for extended inquiry into and
discussion of pressing intellectual and social issues. 1 hat fall,
Arcade was published for the first time. In the glacial pace of
institutional history, not all that much has changed at Stanford
since those first conversations. But Arcade is here, and I know
it has meant something to both those who have worked to
make it a reality, as well as to its readers. And this fall, we
received our first public recognition: second place in the Los
Angeles Times "Storv of the Year" competition.
But the worth of a publication is measured by its com
munity of readers. And it is gestures such as Arcade that over
time are vehicles for changing the culture of an institution by
offering a platform for things which could not otherwise be
expressed or read. 1 leave this project — for a project is some
thing which has vet to become complete — in the hands of the
Stanford community. For it is now incumbent upon you to
sustain this magazine — and the spirit of discourse that it rep
resents. Thank you for supporting both.
