This fall, Stanford Law School
announced the creation of a new link to a
Law School web page that identifies com
panies that have been named in
class-action securities fraud lawsuits.
Included in the directory are allegations,
company responses, and the names,
addresses and telephone numbers of
attorneys on both sides of the case. You
too can hop on the ambulance-chasing
bandwagon at:

Contrary to popular imagination, it
seems that Leland Stanford Sr. wasn't
quite the robber baron we thought. In an
article published in Sandstone and lile,
the journal of the Stanford Historical
Society, Lee Altenberg details the little
known progressive vision of a cooperative
commonwealth Leland Stanford devel
oped in the later years of his life. Check
out this passage, quoted in an early biog
raphy of Stanford:
In a condition of society and under an industrial
organization which places labor completely at the
mercy of capital, the accumulations ol capital will
necessarily be rapid, and an unequal distribution
of wealth is at once to be observed. . . . The one
remedy for this tendency, which to all appear
ances has been ineradicable from the industrial
system, is the cooperation and intelligent direc
tion of labor.
Start beating those plowshares into
swords and prepare to march on Building
10. The workers revolution has begun!

Socially irresponsible
The rejection of a student proposal for a
socially responsible endowment fund by a
committee of the Board of Trustees
comes as no surprise to Grab Bag. Just
take a look at the composition of the
board. Newly appointed trustee Ward
Woods Jr. sits on the Board of mining
company Freeport-McMoÃŸan Copper
and Gold, the subject of exposes in
Mother Jones and The Nation for its
wholesale environmental destruction and
abuce of human rights at its mine in the
dictatorship of Indonesia. Robert Bass,
who chairs the Board of Trustees, played
a major role in bankrolling the now-infa
mous Charles Hurwitz. Readers may
remember that Hurwitz, currently under
prosecution by the FDIC for his role in
the S & L scandal, is the would-be spoils
man of the Headwaters forest in
Northern California. Stanford is clearly
choosing its trustees using criteria other
than social responsibility.
Watch out, Washington
It ilooks like Provost Condoleezza Rice
will soon have better things to do than to
justify the latest tuition increase to irate
parents. In its January issue on the com
ing of the millennium, Newsweek maga
zine imagined Condi as Secretary of
State, trying to pacify future President
Alexander Lebed. Its unlikely, however,
that Condi will discover she's Jewish after
her nomination.

A hit of research into the historical record
indicates that fraternities aren't quite the
pillars of unmitigated masculinity con
ventional wisdom would imply. The
1909 Stanford Quad offers several exam
ples of fraternal activities of the time,
including . . . no, not an early 20th cen
tury night of beer, women and song, but
a wedding. In a ceremony that appears to
be part of the induction ritual for
pledges, the Quad shows two members of
the Phi Delta Phi fraternity being mar
ried at a mock wedding officiated by
another brother outside of Memorial
Church. 1 his may fill some gaps for those
readers who have been mystified by the
esoteric rites which constitute fraternity
initiation. Grab Bag hears wedding bells
over at SAE. . . .
