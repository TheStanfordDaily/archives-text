## The 						Race Not Run Fear and the Roots of Affirmative Action 
### Shelby Steele 
As we evaluate last fall's electoral season, it becomes
apparent that President Clinton, Gen. Colin Powell
and former Sen. Bob Dole shared a fascinating if dubi
ous distinction: They all pulled back from a principled
disenchantment with preferential affirmative action into a
qualified tolerance of it. Even Dole, who was the least tolerant
of the three, lost enthusiasm for legislation he himself intro
duced last year to end it, and while tacitly supporting the
California Civil Rights Initiative, he distanced himself from it.
In his 1995 autobiography Powell declared, "If it leads to pref
erential treatment ... I am opposed," but by last summers
Republican convention he had emerged as one of affirmative
actions most vocal proponents. All three claim it was princi
ple that first led them to question the double standard inher
ent in race and gender preferences. Rut then, after signaling
their doubts, each seemed to run into something. I here were
hesitations, long investigations and, finally, very calculated
repositionings. Something chastened them into an embarrass
ing pragmatism, in which principle seemed premature and
even extreme and in which the crafted statement seemed wiser
than the grandstand.
I don't think it was some fresh encounter with
American racism. Nor do I believe that people who support
affirmative action do so because they believe discrimination is
rampant in America. Preferential policies are most vigorously
supported in institutions like universities, government agen
cies and corporations, where all agree that discrimination has
sharply declined over the last 30 years. (With the glaring
exception of Asians, when was the last time a person of color
was discriminated against in admissions at an American uni
versity?) 1 am also unconvinced that "diversity" really justifies
preferences for most people. It is simply not plausible that peo
ple can muster the sort of passion we see in many supporters
of preferences for an idea as amorphous as diversity — an idea
no two people define in the same way. Diversity is a word
cover, a term of high sentiment that we use when we don't
know, or are unwilling to admit, what really motivates us.
So I don't think Clinton, Powell and Dole ran into
diversity. I believe they hit what I have elsewhere called racial
vulnerability — the fact that blacks and whites living today are
remarkably vulnerable to their race's historical reputations and
stereotypes. An unacknowledged dilemma for Americans of
racial goodwill is that we can all be shamed by the same sad
racial history that we work to overcome.
The main stereotypes are that whites are racist and
blacks are inferior. A white or black child born in America
today, utterly fresh to the world, will grow up under either the
first Kafkaesque accusation or the second. 1 hey will not nec

essarily believe what history accuses them of — stereotypes are
internalized as self-doubt rather than as belief. But even whites
who are as free of racism as it is possible to be will be vulnera
ble to powerful doubts about their racial innocence when
blacks accuse them of racism. In fact, this vulnerability may
cause more anxiety in whites who have earnestly worked to put
themselves beyond racism because their investment in racial
innocence is greater. Conversely, blacks are outraged at a book
like The Bell Curve by Charles Murray and Richard J.
Herrnstein because it triggers their vulnerability to the stereo
type of inferiority.
It doesn't matter that the stereotype of black inferiori
ty was never inherently true while the accusation of white
racism essentially was. Racial vulnerability is situational, an
outgrowth of integrated situations today in which the mere
presence of the other race opens our vulnerability to stereo
types of our own. The sometimes awkward labor of integrated
situations has to do with the pains we must take not to set off
each others vulnerabilities — an effort that ironically requires
us to memorize the damning stereotypes of each other's group.
These are the racial vulnerabilities that I believe
Clinton, Powell, Dole and millions of other Americans run
into when they have to think seriously about group prefer
ences. The affirmative action debate of the last few years is the
situation that has triggered the racial vulnerabilities of many
Americans. And no doubt it was suppressed for the two
decades since its birth to keep this from happening. It is a mea
sure of how fundamentally wrong group preferences are that
this debate could no longer be evaded despite the vulnerabili
ties to which it has exposed us.
Because we find our vulnerabilities unbearable, we
recompose them into narratives we can live with. I don't say to
myself that, as a black person, integrated situations trigger my
vulnerabilities because 1 worry unconsciously that I might do
something to confirm an ugly stereotype of blacks. I instead
tell myself that such situations are ripe with racism and, thus,
stacked against me.
Whites on the left tend to recompose their vulnerabil
ity to the stereotype of whites as racists into an exaggerated
deference toward minorities. 1 he white liberal does not say he
feels vulnerable to being arbitrarily shamed by the charge of
racism or that on some level he may doubt himself in that
regard. He says instead that his racial goodwill, his inherent
racial innocence, commits him to a politics in which deference
to black victimization is a kind of virtuous activism. (Of
course, not all whites respond to black accusations with
uncritical deference. Some try to ignore them, and others
relieve their anxietv with anger. But the anxiety itself is com-
mon to whites of all ideologies.)
One of the main reasons we make bad public policy
around race — and a policy like group preferences that
becomes more divisive with time is undoubtedly bad — is that
we use these policies to confirm the recomposed version of
ourselves rather than to overcome our actual vulnerabilities.
Preferences gave liberal whites the chance to show deference to
black victimization, and they give the black leadership the
chance to

feeds the other through a preferential policy that is unfair on
its face.
However, while there is some truth in these recompo
sitions (deference sometimes is a display of real virtue, and vic
timization sometimes does explain black difficulty), the far
greater truth is in the vulnerabilities that produce them.
Neither race has yet done what is necessary to affirm itself
against the accusations to which it is vulnerable. An activism
of deference will not affirm that whites are not racists (uncrit
ical deference to the black "victim" is a form of racism). And
the insistence that black difficulty is still the result of racism
will not affirm blacks against the stereotype of inferiority.
These vulnerabilities are Americas true racial chal
lenge. A healthy democracy cannot abide white racism or the
developmental inferiority imposed on blacks by Americas his

racism. Yet

Words like "diversity," "multiculturalism," "inclusion" and
"pluralism" say little more than that white deference answers
minority victimization. And out of this disingenuous language
universities, government agencies and corporations make all
manner of race-based, preferential policies that again highlight
white deference as the redemption of black victimization. Such
policy amounts to a form of protectionism: It gives credence
to our recompositions so we don't have to face our racial vul
nerabilities.
Protectionism may be the truest purpose of affirmative
action. By supporting it whites agree to see blacks as victims
rather than inferiors, and in return blacks agree to see whites
as people of racial goodwill rather than as racists. Sadly, this
quid pro quo, in which deference to the other races vulnera
bility buys protection from ones own, is the only real contract

that exists between blacks and whites on a policy level.
After almost 30 years of living with this contract, def
erence has become the American idea of social virtue. At the
center of our national social conscience is the idea that virtue
is served more by helping people hide from their vulnerabili
ties than by helping them to overcome. Such a concept of
virtue makes many good things bad. Merit, excellence, indi
vidual initiative, achievement are now dishonored in our soci
ety (at least in relation to minorities) because they are not def
erential or protective. They buy whites no currency with
blacks and blacks no currency with whites. In pursuing excel
lence or taking initiative we inevitably meet with setbacks and
failures — experiences that seem to confirm ugly stereotypes
of inferiority. Because these principles expose us to the stereo
types that make us vulnerable, we come to think of them as
mean and oppressive — despite the fact that they are the only
principles that can truly help us conquer our vulnerabilities.
Our contract of mutual protection through deference forces us
into a relativism that asks nothing much of anybody. What
does it take to celebrate diversity? And yet, with the mere
announcement that you favor it, you can win protection from
the vulnerabilities that haunt you.
Political correctness, in all its myriad manifestations, is
deferential relativism taken to the level of manners. It is the
code that enforces mutual protection through deference in
daily life. PC. forces us to take each other's recompositions
with grave seriousness and to ignore the real vulnerabilities
behind them as a matter of good taste.
When Clinton says of affirmative action "mend it,
don't end it,"he is going with relativism against difficult prin
ciple not only to buy protection from the likes of Jesse Jackson
(a master at the manipulation of white vulnerability) but also
to reaffirm this larger contract between blacks and whites. I his
contract keeps the various elements of his political base togeth
er — blacks, other minorities, women and liberals in general
— all of whom now identify social virtue with deference.
So, in what has become one of the central ironies ol
contemporary liberalism, Clinton will show more deference to
blacks than others yet do less than others to help them con
front and overcome their vulnerabilities. He will choose pro
tective policies like affirmative action over policies that put
high expectations before deference, that require performance
as a condition of special help, that support individuals rather
than groups and that show compassion by insisting on diffi
cult principles. Were he to do anything else, he would not only
look "mean but would break his contract with a crucial seg
ment of his constituency. If "mending" the old contract hid
blacks from the challenge of their vulnerability, it also protect
ed him from the risk of his.
And if Powell were to challenge affirmative action, and
therefore this larger contract, it would seem as if the most pop
ular black man in America was ripping away the recomposi
tion (racism and victimization) by which his own group pro
tects its esteem. He would throw his people open to their his
toric vulnerability to the myth of black inferiority. In a culture
where deference and self-protection are virtue, this would be
mean and extreme. Running squarely into this, Powell, like
Clinton before him, chose relativism over difficult principle.
Affirmative action was okay because the playing field was
"unlevel," he said, aligning himself with his race's recomposed
version of its situation. ("Unlevel" meaning that racism still
largely explains black difficulty.) And this brought the general
back into the American racial contract after the denunciation
of preferences in his autobiography had caused many to won
der where he stood. Although Bob Dole articulately
denounces group preferences, it is also true that he shelved his
own piece of legislation (the Dole-Canady bill) to end them
in the federal government and stepped back a little from the
California Civil Rights Initiative, which would end prefer
ences in California's state government. In these latter moves —
these small retreats — he displayed the deference that he
hoped would buy him some protection from his racial vulner
ability — the stereotype that as a white male Republican he
was probably racially intolerant. Clearly, the selection of Jack
Kemp as his running mate was a part of this deferential display
because Kemp has great credibility in the black community.
But Kemp will not work well as an offer of deference because
he withdrew his support of affirmative action to join the tick
et. The larger point is that a natural ideological opponent of
affirmative action (with an honorable civil rights record) like
Dole was racially vulnerable and therefore subject to the same
contract as Clinton, Powell and all other Americans.
I think one reason the Republicans were unsuccessful
in transforming the 1994 shift to the right into a presidential
victory is that Dole and the much maligned Newt Gingrich
were out of sync with the idea of social virtue as deference. In
fact, the Republican revolution was, in many ways, an assault
on this very idea of virtue. But without deferential virtue they
had no protection from the stereotype that portrayed
Republicans as racially intolerant. They had no way of joining
the larger contract between blacks and whites, no way to buy
favor. Barking principles at affirmative action rather than
whispering deference, it looked as if they were mean and
extreme, against equality itself.
Thus, their national convention was a veritable fire
works display of deferential liberalisms — with words like
"inclusion" and "diversity" finding their way into every major
speech. Dole got good press coverage and a public opinion
boost after this deferential convention, but without affirma
tive action he had no concrete way to join the contract and
stave off negative stereotypes of white male Republicans.
Reagan and Bush kept affirmative action out of play by quiet
ly going along with it — a deferential gesture that kept stereo
types at bay and brought them into the contract. Dole is the
first presidential candidate in more than 30 years who, despite
his belated shows of deference, ended up outside this contract.
He stood in new political territory.
We have to start over from a simple truth: All protec
tion from racial vulnerability is illusion. All our recomposi
tions only recycle the old stereotypes and expand our vulnera
bility to them. Today, after decades of deferential racial reform,
blacks and whites are as vulnerable as ever to the legends of
black inferiority and white racism. In truth, racial oppression
would not have been oppression if it had not imposed devel
opmental inferiority on blacks. And history makes it clear that
whites are quite capable of blithely living with and practicing
the most horrific kind of social evil. Oppression leaves no
innocent people in its wake, its victims included. If whites
have the guilt of oppression, blacks have the shame of subju
gation. Instead of recomposing to assert an innocence we don't

have, we ought to let the vulnerabilities themselves guide our
policy—making on race. And, of course, the test of our sin
cerity in this will be whether we allow those difficult non-def
erential principles, like excellence, hard work and honesty
across racial lines, to have the same virtuous stature in reform
as deference.
When Clinton, Powell and Dole were forced to take
positions on preferences, they encountered fear. Affirmative
action is based on an entrenched and familiar recomposition
— white goodwill redeeming black victimization. What hap
pens if we get rid of it? How will we know what to expect of
each other? Having recomposed our fear for so long, we now
believe in it more than ever. I often hear other blacks say black
students will never have the SAT scores of whites or Asians. 1
hear college professors say that without affirmative action
blacks will all but disappear from higher education — as
though we ought to make policy on the presumption of per
manent black inferiority. Others say that it is more difficult for

I his, I think, is arguable, but it makes no difference. We will
not overcome history until blacks are competitive with all oth
ers and no longer the objects of positive or negative discrimi
nation. The fear that we are what history says we are is what
waits on the other side of affirmative action. It would be a
good sign of things to come if we could at least say so.
