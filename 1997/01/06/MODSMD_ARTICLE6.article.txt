## The
						Race Not Run Fear and the Roots of Affirmative Action 
### Shelby Steele 
As we evaluate last fall's electoral season, it becomes
apparent that President Clinton, Gen. Colin Powell
and former Sen. Bob Dole shared a fascinating if dubi
ous distinction: They all pulled back from a principled
disenchantment with preferential affirmative action into a
qualified tolerance of it. Even Dole, who was the least tolerant
of the three, lost enthusiasm for legislation he himself intro
duced last year to end it, and while tacitly supporting the
California Civil Rights Initiative, he distanced himself from it.
In his 1995 autobiography Powell declared, "If it leads to pref
erential treatment ... I am opposed," but by last summers
Republican convention he had emerged as one of affirmative
actions most vocal proponents. All three claim it was princi
ple that first led them to question the double standard inher
ent in race and gender preferences. Rut then, after signaling
their doubts, each seemed to run into something. I here were
hesitations, long investigations and, finally, very calculated
repositionings. Something chastened them into an embarrass
ing pragmatism, in which principle seemed premature and
even extreme and in which the crafted statement seemed wiser
than the grandstand.
I don't think it was some fresh encounter with
American racism. Nor do I believe that people who support
affirmative action do so because they believe discrimination is
rampant in America. Preferential policies are most vigorously
supported in institutions like universities, government agen
cies and corporations, where all agree that discrimination has
sharply declined over the last 30 years. (With the glaring
exception of Asians, when was the last time a person of color
was discriminated against in admissions at an American uni
versity?) 1 am also unconvinced that "diversity" really justifies
preferences for most people. It is simply not plausible that peo
ple can muster the sort of passion we see in many supporters
of preferences for an idea as amorphous as diversity — an idea
no two people define in the same way. Diversity is a word
cover, a term of high sentiment that we use when we don't
know, or are unwilling to admit, what really motivates us.
So I don't think Clinton, Powell and Dole ran into
diversity. I believe they hit what I have elsewhere called racial
vulnerability — the fact that blacks and whites living today are
remarkably vulnerable to their race's historical reputations and
stereotypes. An unacknowledged dilemma for Americans of
racial goodwill is that we can all be shamed by the same sad
racial history that we work to overcome.
The main stereotypes are that whites are racist and
blacks are inferior. A white or black child born in America
today, utterly fresh to the world, will grow up under either the
first Kafkaesque accusation or the second. 1 hey will not nec

essarily believe what history accuses them of — stereotypes are
internalized as self-doubt rather than as belief. But even whites
who are as free of racism as it is possible to be will be vulnera
ble to powerful doubts about their racial innocence when
blacks accuse them of racism. In fact, this vulnerability may
cause more anxiety in whites who have earnestly worked to put
themselves beyond racism because their investment in racial
innocence is greater. Conversely, blacks are outraged at a book
like The Bell Curve by Charles Murray and Richard J.
Herrnstein because it triggers their vulnerability to the stereo
type of inferiority.
It doesn't matter that the stereotype of black inferiori
ty was never inherently true while the accusation of white
racism essentially was. Racial vulnerability is situational, an
outgrowth of integrated situations today in which the mere
presence of the other race opens our vulnerability to stereo
types of our own. The sometimes awkward labor of integrated
situations has to do with the pains we must take not to set off
each others vulnerabilities — an effort that ironically requires
us to memorize the damning stereotypes of each other's group.
These are the racial vulnerabilities that I believe
Clinton, Powell, Dole and millions of other Americans run
into when they have to think seriously about group prefer
ences. The affirmative action debate of the last few years is the
situation that has triggered the racial vulnerabilities of many
Americans. And no doubt it was suppressed for the two
decades since its birth to keep this from happening. It is a mea
sure of how fundamentally wrong group preferences are that
this debate could no longer be evaded despite the vulnerabili
ties to which it has exposed us.
Because we find our vulnerabilities unbearable, we
recompose them into narratives we can live with. I don't say to
myself that, as a black person, integrated situations trigger my
vulnerabilities because 1 worry unconsciously that I might do
something to confirm an ugly stereotype of blacks. I instead
tell myself that such situations are ripe with racism and, thus,
stacked against me.
Whites on the left tend to recompose their vulnerabil
ity to the stereotype of whites as racists into an exaggerated
deference toward minorities. 1 he white liberal does not say he
feels vulnerable to being arbitrarily shamed by the charge of
racism or that on some level he may doubt himself in that
regard. He says instead that his racial goodwill, his inherent
racial innocence, commits him to a politics in which deference
to black victimization is a kind of virtuous activism. (Of
course, not all whites respond to black accusations with
uncritical deference. Some try to ignore them, and others
relieve their anxietv with anger. But the anxiety itself is com-
