# All FUNC'ed Up
## The 						Real Lessons of the Rankings 
### Romesh Ratnesar 
Those of us recently cast out of the protected idyll of
Stanford have observed with amusement — and not
totally detachcd interest — the ongoing campus furor
over the U.S. News & World Report annual college rankings.
During my four years on The Farm, as Stanford's standing
remained locked out of the top three, the rankings grew from
a minor and little-noticed annoyance to a source of institu
tional consternation. Few of us, though, thought the gathering
storm of disgruntlement with the magazine would become a
certifiable deluge of indignation, let alone a University-wide
crusade that has enlisted the time and effort of the student
government, the student newspaper and the University presi
dent.
But it has. In the last six months, Stanford has become
the nerve-center of a national movement to destroy the dread
ed rankings once and for all. Led by ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson, Stanford students have taken the lead in
establishing a national, inter-collegiate network of and- U.S.
News sentiment. Impressive in its scope and ambition, the
Forget U.S. News Coalition (FUNC) has corralled supporters
from dozens of major universities, and the list is growing. I he
group has fired off a defiant letter to U.S. News editor James
Fallows, claiming that "the rankings are doing a disservice to
students and to the country." Although it may involve sopho
mores, there is nothing sophomoric about this attempt to dis
mantle the annual rankings bonanza, an industry so lucrative
that U.S. News main competitors, Time and Newsweek, this
year introduced college guides of their own.
Not having the benefit of witnessing this FUNC-iness
first hand, it isn't unnatural for people like me to wonder what
explains the hysteria. I had hoped that the leaders of FUNC
had assembled a case that warranted the amounts of time and
money and hot air that students (more accurately, student
governments) across the country have already expended on the
issue. But to read the harangues of FUNC and its sympathiz
ers about the evils of the U.S. News rankings — their arbi
trariness, their deceit, their subversion of all that is sacred in
higher education — is to delve into a morass of convoluted
logic, unsubstantiated accusation and alarming hyperbole.
The assault on the rankings is, in short, a classic case of mis
placed energies and missed opportunities. It appeals to the
worst paranoid instincts of college students and demeans the
possible value the rankings might have for high school seniors
facing a difficult and expensive decision. And by wildly inflat
ing the importance of the rankings game, its detractors only
legitimize it more.
But what is most intriguing, to me anyway, is why all
this rankings venom has come hurtling from students and
administrators at Stanford. Why is it Stanford folk who have
made the most public and impassioned denunciations of

U.S. News seemingly innocuous exercise? I would argue that
the true significance of the FUNC movement is not so much
the points it makes against the rankings (it makes few), but
what it says, quietly but devastatingly, about the state and psy
che of Stanford itself
The opening salvo in FUNC's campaign to do away
with the U.S. News rankings came in October, a few weeks
after the magazine released its latest tally. Stanford, which had
hovered among the top four universities in the two previous
lists, slipped to sixth, behind Vale, Harvard, Princeton, Duke
and M.I.T. On Oct. 22, The Stanford Daily editorialized
against the rankings, labeling them "nothing il not idiosyn
cratic. Three days later, the Los Angeles Times published an
op-ed piece by Thompson denouncing the rankings. Less then
two weeks later, Ihe New York limes published a short article
on the founding of FUNC], reporting that five student gov
ernments, including Stanford's, had passed resolutions con
demning the rankings and calling on their administrations to
refuse to provide the magazine with data lor next year's survey.
In January, The Times education supplement ran an extended
piece on the dump-U.S. News movement, which had become
"a cause celebre on a growing number of campuses.
Amid this surge of publicity and alarm, Thompson's
op-ed piece is a kind of manifesto lor U.S. News opponents.
It contains a stream of accusations against the reliability and
unwarranted power of the rankings. More interestingly, it
points to numerous policy changes at Stanford which have
been initiated, he claims, to bolster the University's standing in
the poll. But the hollowness of Thompson's claims undermine
the validity of his challenge.
In the article, Thompson asserts that the rankings are
"subjective, a label FUNC invokes so regularly that you
would think that U.S. News editors devise the rankings accord
ing to their personal whims, over pizza and beers in a smoky
editorial office. But the magazine goes to considerable length
to explain their rankings methodology. Indeed, the only eval
uative category that is not derived from quantitative data is
"academic reputation," which counts for 25 percent of a
school's total score. The magazines sends "surveys of academic
reputation" to 4,200 college presidents, deans and admissions
directors; they are asked merely "to rate by quartile all schools
in the same categories as their own" — but not to assign a
numerical ranking to each school. One can quibble with the
weight the magazine gives to each category — it's not clear, for
instance, why the rate at which a school retains its students
should count as much as its faculty resources — but one can
quibble with just about any qualitative decisions researchers
make. And the editors admit, up front, that their formula is
hardly a "definitive, zero-sum standard by which [colleges] can
be judged," as Thompson contends. Instead, they write in the
introduction to this year's poll that "simply because a school is
tops in its category does not mean it is the top choice for every
one'' and that "schools separated by only a few places in the rank
ings are extremely close in academic quality."
I hompson dismisses the magazines attempt to acknowl
edge and explicate the rankings' limitations; they remain, he
charges, "arbitrary and absurdly counterintuitive in their yearly
variance." He cites the flux of Johns Hopkins University's ranking:
"can a stable university . . . really change from being the 21st best
school in the nation to the 10th and then back to 15th in a three
year period?" Well, yes, considering that only 5.4 percentage
points separated 21st from 15th in this year's survey and that a
measly nine-tenths of a point stood between Hopkins and the two
schools tied for ninth, Caltech and Northwestern. Careful con
sumers would no doubt recognize the minuscule differences
among the top 25 college and universities' scores. But if
Thompson has little faith in U.S. News editors, he has none in its
readers. The rankings "are taken as dogma by many applicants.
Consequently, many high school students choose colleges based
on the subjective rankings of U.S. Newf — that word again —
"not on what is best for them or their individual needs."
To be sure, this is a serious and inflammatory accusation.
It is also rubbish. According to the most recent and comprehen
sive survey of college freshmen, conducted by UCLA and the
American Council on Education, only 8.7 percent of all students
noted "rankings in national magazines" as a "very important" rea
son for selecting their school. The rate is higher — 22 percent —
among students at private universities. But even among those
freshmen, magazine surveys were less important than the school's
academic reputation, whether it offered financial aid, the quality
of job and grad school placements of its graduates, its size, its aca
demic programs and even its social reputation. It may not be con
venient for Thompson to admit, but most people aren't nearly as
shallow as he thinks.
What Thompson and his allies make no attempt to under
stand is how and why the rankings have achieved the ascendance
they decry. Actually, it's no riddle. The rankings have value — not
because they are accurate but simply because they are there. I heir
value isn't just that they provide students and their parents not just
with quantitative information. 1 hey also provide a way of com
paring institutions against each other — a way that is reasonably,
but by no means completely, evenhanded. It is also one that can
call attention to a school like Duke, which cracked the top four
this year after a long, steady and quite concerted climb into high
er education's elite.
Sure, every student would prefer to receive informed and
honest advice from high school counselors, alumni of various col
leges, to consult dozens of guide books that offered detailed
accounts of a school's attributes and shortcomings, to visit and
spend time and attend classes at several different institutions.
That's what I did. But for many families, simply applying to col
lege is a serious and considerable expenditure, and for them the
rankings can help whittle down choices to a manageable number,
just as high-priced college consultants do for the more privileged
others. Indeed, crusading against exorbitant application fees, con
sultants, test-preparation courses and other factors that dispropor
tionately benefit privileged applicants might be a better applica
tion of Thompson's progressive inclinations.
The heart of Thompsons case, however, centers not
around the rankings' perceived effects on students going to college

but those on the colleges themselves and, in particular, on the one
he attends. He charges, without a hint of qualification, that 'the
administrations at these schools dont push for what is best for
their institutions but for what is best for the U.S. News rankings.
At Stanford, such rankings-influenced policy shifts are manifold:
"a cynical new grading policy has been implemented, nontradi
tional departments have been cut and a new early admissions pro
gram has been created," all, apparently, in an effort to
"Harvardize" the University and improve its academic reputation.
After seeing those charges find their way into print, University
President Gerhard Casper wrote in a letter to Ihe limes that
Thompsons claims are "simply false; Stanford takes education far
too seriously for that to be the case. All the decisions Thompson
cites, Casper pointed out, came from different departments of the
University — a faculty committee, a school dean and the dean of
admissions — and all were carried out for quite different ends.
Although I regret many of the changes Thompson cites, I'm
inclined to agree with Casper's explanation for them. That the
University would pursue policies to improve its standing in the
"academic reputation category seems counterintuitive because
that is the area in which Stanford consistently scores best. If any
thing, Stanford's reputation suffered during the debate over the
new grading system because it exposed to outsiders the near-scan
dalous degree to which undergraduate grades were inflated.
Thompson continues. Lamenting the advent of the 3-
year-old Stanford Fund, he sighs that "sadly, many of my peers are
excited to work for the Stanford Fund because . . . their egos and
employment potential rest to some degree on Stanford's place in
the accepted hierarchy of colleges. This is ludicrous to the point
of hilarity. As any recent Stanford grad can attest, the level of
esteem Stanford commands in the professional world has
absolutely no relationship to its annual standing in the U.S. News
poll. In fact, for many graduates, the most sobering realization we
have had to face is not how much Stanford's ranking matters to
prospective employers and graduate programs and potential dates
— but how little it does. If anything, Thompson's "peers' are
"excited" to work for the Stanford Fund because they no longer
have a choice; the fund was devised to prevent student groups
from soliciting donations on their own. Thompson's resignation
to this unsettling policy is more than a little discouraging, while
his analysis of its intentions is utterly misplaced.
How to make sense of all this misguided disgruntlement?
It is instructive here to mention Casper's own four-page memo to
Fallows, in which he contended that "much about these rankings
— particularly their specious formulas and spurious precision
is utterly misleading." Although Casper has often professed that
he gives hardly a passing thought to the annual survey
Stanford's slide to No. 6 this year "definitely didn't cost me any
sleep," he told The New York limes— his letter betrayed a real
concern that the University might suffer if the rankings continued
to place Stanford that low. "Alas, alumni, foreign newspapers, and
many others do not bring a sense of perspective to the matter, he
wrote.
Casper's letter, not surprisingly, makes some incisive and
rather effective indictments of the magazine's methodological
shoddiness. He shrewdly exposed the year-to-year variations in
many schools' faculty resources and financial resources scores, dis
parities whose only explanation is that "the formulas were simply
changed, with notification to no one, not even your readers. And
he dismantles the magazine's new value-added category by
showing how it could conceivable reward schools for dumbing
down their curriculum ro maximize the number of students
who graduate from the institution. (In this case, Caltech's
standing was punished for a low score in the value-added cat
egory, which could easily be explained by the famed rigor of
that school's academic program.)
But even if he has exposed the .flaws in the rankings
more eloquently and effectively than anyone else, Casper has
never sufficiently answered some of the troubling matters that
the rankings expose, year after year, about Stanford itself. And
it is for that reason 1 believe U.S. News serves a valuable, and
maybe even indispensable, purpose. Why is Stanford's alumni
giving rank so low (26th), especially in comparison to Yale
(6th), Princeton (Ist) and Harvard (4th)? Why is Stanford's
"value-added" rating lower not only than those three schoolsn
but also Duke, Dartmouth and Brown? Casper's attack on the
rankings takes the opposite tack from Thompson's. For
Thompson, the rankings should be jettisoned because they are
responsible for Stanford's missteps; for Casper, the rankings
should be jettisoned because Stanford hasn't made any mis
steps. The more pertinent dilemma, though, isn't which one is
right. It is why both feel such anxiety about the rankings in the
first place.
In 1987, U.S. News & World Report named Stanford
the best university in America. In some respects, that annoint
ment served as a kind of symbolic, shimmering confirmation
of Stanford's meteoric rise to international prominence. Soon
enough, though, the party ended. In 1989, the University suf
fered through a natural disaster, the Loma Prieta Earthquake,
whose financial aftershocks the school continues to feel today.
The disasters worsened. Soon followed the revelations in the
early 1990s that the University faced a long-term budget
crunch that grimly threatened Stanford's still-glittering future.
And finally, the blunderbuss that ended Donald Kennedy's 12-
year tenure as president: the indirect-cost scandal which
brought the University national embarrassment, a withering
Congressional rebuke and fiscal punishment in the form of
dramatically slashed federal research funds.
When Casper assumed the helm in 1992, the charge to
him was clear, if implicit: Clean the mess up. First, Casper
went about tidying the University's financial house. He hired
Soviet military expert Condoleezza Rice, a veteran of the Bush
White House, to carry out the task of slimming Stanford, par
ing it of its roaring 80s excesses. The new administration also
recognized that it had to find sustainable sources of revenue to
finance the University into the next century. They found one,
right in The Farm's backyard. Within four years of the inau
guration of the Casper-Rice team, imposing, impressive struc
tures have risen from the ground, with the by now-household
names of technology behemoths — Allen, Cates, Hewlett and
Packard — gleaming from their shiny glass doors.
The debacles of the late 1980s didn't just damage
Stanford's pocketbook; they struck deep into the University's
soul. While it was getting mercilessly ripped by the federal
government, Stanford fought wars with itself, over CIV and
speech codes and sexual harassment. Self-confidence and faith
in the University among students, faculty and perhaps most
notably, alumni, plummeted. Undergraduate applications
nose-dived. By 1993, 8 out of 10 high school seniors accepted
to both Stanford and Harvard chose Harvard. It is no wonder,

in this context, that administrative elites chose to storm the
ramparts of undergraduate laxity, dumping in short order the
"liberal" grading policy, Pro Fro week and the "wacky walk"
graduation procession, while instituting programs designed to
project Stanford's more austere side, such as early admission
and the President's Scholars Program.
In other areas, too, the Casper administration has car
ried out its budget-balancing aims with success — if success is
measured by the capacity to maximize efficiency and stream
lining and strip school functions and personnel to their barest.
What Thompson fails to grasp is that this had nothing to do
with bettering Stanford's U.S. News ranking. It is what this
administration was hired to do. To be sure, there have been
losers. They include Cecilia Burciaga, the much-loved Chicana
administrator who not only was unceremoniously sacked in
1994 but put through the indignity of hearing about it second
hand. And the autonomy of Stanford magazine, which the
publicity-conscious Casper team snared into its control by
merging it with Stanford Report, thus sparing alumni readers
any semblance of critical coverage of the University. And the
Food Research Institute, which took the ax last year against the
will of nearly all its faculty and students. And undergraduate
students, who will bear the consequences of an administra
tion-approved increase in the average size of sections.
What's happened at Stanford in the last 10 years, to be
fair, has happened before and is happening in other places as
well. Fhe swell of discontent that has fueled FUNC's outrage
has a lot to do with a sense, rife at Stanford but not limited to
it, that things just might be slipping out of hand. As the recent
news of a Yahoo!-endowed chair confirms, Stanford has
renewed its Faustian pact with the technological companies
who funded its rise and promise to sustain it in the future —
on a few conditions. But to be a superior technical school
doesn't mean you also must be a technocratic one. And there
is the danger: a Stanford that becomes, within a few years,
impersonal, unsentimental, inhuman. Perhaps it's time for
some soul-searching that reaches beyond this misplaced obses
sion with one magazine's yearly survey. Rather than bemoan
and castigate and dismiss the U.S. News rankings, we should
begin to consider the possibility that the ranking we got is the
one we deserve.
