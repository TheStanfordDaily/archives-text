# All FUNC'ed Up
## The
						Real Lessons of the Rankings 
### Romesh Ratnesar 
Those of us recently cast out of the protected idyll of
Stanford have observed with amusement — and not
totally detachcd interest — the ongoing campus furor
over the U.S. News & World Report annual college rankings.
During my four years on The Farm, as Stanford's standing
remained locked out of the top three, the rankings grew from
a minor and little-noticed annoyance to a source of institu
tional consternation. Few of us, though, thought the gathering
storm of disgruntlement with the magazine would become a
certifiable deluge of indignation, let alone a University-wide
crusade that has enlisted the time and effort of the student
government, the student newspaper and the University presi
dent.
But it has. In the last six months, Stanford has become
the nerve-center of a national movement to destroy the dread
ed rankings once and for all. Led by ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson, Stanford students have taken the lead in
establishing a national, inter-collegiate network of and- U.S.
News sentiment. Impressive in its scope and ambition, the
Forget U.S. News Coalition (FUNC) has corralled supporters
from dozens of major universities, and the list is growing. I he
group has fired off a defiant letter to U.S. News editor James
Fallows, claiming that "the rankings are doing a disservice to
students and to the country." Although it may involve sopho
mores, there is nothing sophomoric about this attempt to dis
mantle the annual rankings bonanza, an industry so lucrative
that U.S. News main competitors, Time and Newsweek, this
year introduced college guides of their own.
Not having the benefit of witnessing this FUNC-iness
first hand, it isn't unnatural for people like me to wonder what
explains the hysteria. I had hoped that the leaders of FUNC
had assembled a case that warranted the amounts of time and
money and hot air that students (more accurately, student
governments) across the country have already expended on the
issue. But to read the harangues of FUNC and its sympathiz
ers about the evils of the U.S. News rankings — their arbi
trariness, their deceit, their subversion of all that is sacred in
higher education — is to delve into a morass of convoluted
logic, unsubstantiated accusation and alarming hyperbole.
The assault on the rankings is, in short, a classic case of mis
placed energies and missed opportunities. It appeals to the
worst paranoid instincts of college students and demeans the
possible value the rankings might have for high school seniors
facing a difficult and expensive decision. And by wildly inflat
ing the importance of the rankings game, its detractors only
legitimize it more.
But what is most intriguing, to me anyway, is why all
this rankings venom has come hurtling from students and
administrators at Stanford. Why is it Stanford folk who have
made the most public and impassioned denunciations of

U.S. News seemingly innocuous exercise? I would argue that
the true significance of the FUNC movement is not so much
the points it makes against the rankings (it makes few), but
what it says, quietly but devastatingly, about the state and psy
che of Stanford itself
The opening salvo in FUNC's campaign to do away
with the U.S. News rankings came in October, a few weeks
after the magazine released its latest tally. Stanford, which had
hovered among the top four universities in the two previous
lists, slipped to sixth, behind Vale, Harvard, Princeton, Duke
and M.I.T. On Oct. 22, The Stanford Daily editorialized
against the rankings, labeling them "nothing il not idiosyn
cratic. Three days later, the Los Angeles Times published an
op-ed piece by Thompson denouncing the rankings. Less then
two weeks later, Ihe New York limes published a short article
on the founding of FUNC], reporting that five student gov
ernments, including Stanford's, had passed resolutions con
demning the rankings and calling on their administrations to
refuse to provide the magazine with data lor next year's survey.
In January, The Times education supplement ran an extended
piece on the dump-U.S. News movement, which had become
"a cause celebre on a growing number of campuses.
Amid this surge of publicity and alarm, Thompson's
op-ed piece is a kind of manifesto lor U.S. News opponents.
It contains a stream of accusations against the reliability and
unwarranted power of the rankings. More interestingly, it
points to numerous policy changes at Stanford which have
been initiated, he claims, to bolster the University's standing in
the poll. But the hollowness of Thompson's claims undermine
the validity of his challenge.
In the article, Thompson asserts that the rankings are
"subjective, a label FUNC invokes so regularly that you
would think that U.S. News editors devise the rankings accord
ing to their personal whims, over pizza and beers in a smoky
editorial office. But the magazine goes to considerable length
to explain their rankings methodology. Indeed, the only eval
uative category that is not derived from quantitative data is
"academic reputation," which counts for 25 percent of a
school's total score. The magazines sends "surveys of academic
reputation" to 4,200 college presidents, deans and admissions
directors; they are asked merely "to rate by quartile all schools
in the same categories as their own" — but not to assign a
numerical ranking to each school. One can quibble with the
weight the magazine gives to each category — it's not clear, for
instance, why the rate at which a school retains its students
should count as much as its faculty resources — but one can
quibble with just about any qualitative decisions researchers
make. And the editors admit, up front, that their formula is
hardly a "definitive, zero-sum standard by which [colleges] can
be judged," as Thompson contends. Instead, they write in the
