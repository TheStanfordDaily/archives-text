# Where Have All the Professorships Gone?
## 
### 
For some time now, its been apparent that downsizing isn't a Stanford-specific phenomenon. With the end of the Cold War and
its lush defense contracts, as well as an increasing public reluctance to support higher education, newly minted I'h.D.s — even
the best and the brightest — are finding it nearly impossible to find a job, much less one that offers any sort of job security,
full-time employment or benefits. To learn more about the origin and politics of the crises facing the American university, as well as
possible solutions, Arcade Editor in Chief Mia Sara Bruch talked with Herbert Lindenberger, president of the Modern Language
Association (MLA), the professional organization of literary scholars. Lindenberger is the Avalon Professor of the Humanities at
Stanford.

This phenomenon has been a subject of discussion in academic cir
cles for some time, but no one seems to have a precise sense of just

when the trouble began. What is the his
torical context of the job crisis?

As far as are academia is con
cerned, there's been a recession since the
late 7 0s. We had good years through the
50s to the end of the 60s. That's when
anybody getting out of graduate school
— even a nonprestigious one — could
count on several job offers, even before
the dissertation was complete. The Baby
Boom generation was going to college
and the federal government was giving a
lot of money to building up science
departments and circulating money
throughout the university for indirect
costs. Legislatures were also relatively
generous with us — they let colleges
expand and with them the number of
Ph.D.s.
Then, beginning in the early
70s, the demography changed. Nobody
planned in those terms; they assumed an
infinite growth along the lines of the
stock market. There have been some ups
and downs, but demography was such
that after 1970, fewer and fewer kids

entered college. But in the late '80s, I,
along with many of my colleagues, began to tell undergradu
ates that there was going to be a real shortage of academics
beginning in the '90s. We anticipated a lot of retirements
among the generation that entered academia i.' the 50s, and
we knew that the birthrate had started going up again around
1980, as the Baby Boomers began to have children. I hen, all
of a sudden, we had a recession in 1990. The recession only
lasted a couple of years at most. But whereas the rest of the
country recovered, academia remained in a slump. I he num
ber of available jobs plummeted at the very time that demog
raphy was favorable to an expansion of academic jobs.
Then what explains the continuous stagnation?
I know what's happening, and it's not very nice. 1 he
American people have decided not to support higher educa

rion. There's a report by an institute that studies state govern
ment — and it's mostly state money that funds education in

this country — which found that while
the percentage of available funds has
increased for prisons, welfare and
remained steady for primary and sec
ondary education in recent years, the
percentage of state funds that went to
higher education had gone down.
The awful thing is that this is
the very moment at which pressures on
universities are arising from the chil
dren of the Baby Boom, as well as pres
sures from families who didn't necessar
ily go to college who want their chil
dren to get the best possible education
so they can get ahead in life. At the very
time when universities are needed for a
new generation of students, the doors
are closing. What happens? Most state
schools have to find a way to accom
modate everybody who has a certain
G.P.A. What they do not want to do is
hire Ph.D.s for tenure track jobs
because that means you have to make a
commitment to consider them for
tenure, then, once they have tenure,
you have a lifetime contract, and they
become a fixed item in your budget. As
in corporate America, flexibility is the

name of the game. You want people who you can fire easily, or
who you can transfer to other departments. There's a tremen
dous reluctance on the part of universities to hire people for
full-time, long-term jobs. University administrators, under
severe financial constraints and under the pressure of state leg
islatures and hoards of regents, hire part-timers who they don't
have to pay benefits to or hire full-timers only on a year-to
year basis depending on enrollment.
Look at the consequences for students. In the UC sys
tem and the Cal State system, it is understood that it will be
very hard to graduate in four years. To get the classes to fulfill
a major or distribution requirements, you have to take cours
es with enrollment limitations, courses with waiting lists of a
semester or more. And that, combined with increasing regis
tration costs, means that the cost of public education has
become more than many people can manage. Now, many stu-

dents are limited to community colleges and Cal State cam
puses. As fees go up, more and more of the potential students
who we want in the university are not going to get a chance to

grams, adding to the mar
ket glut?
In most of the private
universities, that's not the
problem. Graduate stu
dents don't pay to go
here; we give them fel
lowships. Stanford cut
back in the '70s and

takes very few people. Yale eut down in English last year to
about two-thirds of what we take. In the public universities, it
works very differently. The more you take in, the more cheap
labor you can get to take care of freshman composition,
instruction in the foreign languages and TA-ships — courses
that professors don't want to teach.
The cheap labor system works fine, but only if you
know that after working very hard at low wages there is a
decent job at the other end. But now, you have an embittered
population of people who put in their years — sometimes eight
or nine of them — without that job. They hang in there, teach
ing freshman composition part time, and try to look for a job.

THE GAME YOU WANT PEOPLE

THERE'S A TREMENDOUS
RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF
UNIVERSITIES TO HIRE PEOPLE
FOR FULL-TIME, LONG-TERM
JOBS.

I've met them at confer
ences, and I've asked
them if anyone warned
them that after this hard
work they might not find
the job they trained for.
Nobody warned them.
And they're very bitter.
But the students want to
be in the profession, even
those who are embittered:
I asked the same people if
they would have done
things differently if any
one had told them, and
they say no, I figured I'd
be the one who got the
job.

One needs to understand that this is a system in which
everybody is in collusion. It would be extremely disruptive to
the job system if we did what we really have to do: radically
reduce the number of graduate students. The professors want
to teach advanced undergraduate classes and graduate classes.
To have the graduate classes they need to have the graduate
students. To get the introductory classes taught, you need to
have graduate students who will do it cheaply. The professors
are happy and the graduate students get to be in graduate pro
grams, hoping that they will be the exception. And the legisla
ture is happy because they have a lot of cheap labor taking care
of all the students. Everybody is in collusion with everybody
else, and it leaves a lot of instruction in its wake. Its a system.

I want that to be understood by everybody on down the line.
Is the problem of the job market specific to the humanities and
social sciences, or is it a larger problem that crosses disciplines to
the hard sciences as well?
- There is no difference in the job market in the sci
ences. There's money for graduate work in the sciences and
even money for postdocs after you finish. But if you want an
academic job, it's going to be just as hard to get as in the
humanities. We have overproduced Ph.D.s everywhere along
the line, even in the most fashionable fields like molecular
biology. There was one difference for a long time and to a cer
tain extent today: With a Ph.D. in the sciences, you could go
into industry. But that has become increasingly difficult.
Many industries are just saturated. People who thought that if
they didn't get an academic job they could work for Genentech
are finding that the private sector is very hard to break into as
well. Our country has many highly trained professionals for
whom work is not necessarily available.
What are professional organizations like the MLA and professors
like yourself doing about the problem? What can they do?
The majority of tenured professors haven't thought
much about it. It only comes home to them when their grad
uate students need jobs. I've talked to many graduate students
who found the professors unwilling or unable to assist them.
It is true that today most graduate programs have a placement
director, but there's only so much you can do.
There have been all sorts of proposals for shortening
the Ph.D. or adding a midway degree somewhere in between
a master's and a Ph.D. They don't get very far because as soon
as you have some sort of alternate degree it's going to create a
hierarchy between the "real degree, which carries prestige,
and the alternate second-class degree, which is easier to get. It
won't necessarily serve a function — right now, a master's will
only get you a job at a community college and a midway
degree probably couldn't do much better.
I do think graduate programs could a better job of get
ting students out of graduate school more quickly. It's totally
unnecessary for students to spend eight or nine years in grad
uate school after their fellowships have run out, teaching part
time and trying to finish their thesis. And unless universities
didn't need the cheap labor they would have done something
about it already. Most students finish required classes and
exams at the end of their third year. There's no reason that any
doctoral dissertation should take more than a year-and-a-half.
More could be done early in the graduate program to help stu
dents plan their course of study, like assigning research papers
which can lay the groundwork for the dissertation.
Has there been a change in the sort of scholarship that leads to a
job? What effect has the rise of cultural and ethnic studies had on
the kinds of jobs that are available?
If you are minority person working on ethnic litera
ture, if anyone gets a job it will be you. There is a huge
demand for this sort of course, and it has been so hard to get
enough minority scholars into the pipeline that they may not
necessarily get a job right away — I'm beginning to see that it's
a little bit harder than it used to be — but they will have fair
ly easy time. Rut they shouldn't count on it. At a certain point,
their fields will become saturated. As for cultural studies,
again, you wont necessarily get a job, but there is a call for it.
You mentioned political sentiment and voting patterns as a cause
of the shrinkage of the job market. To what extent do you see your
role as a political one?
I am trying to find ways of restoring the good will that
academia once had among the public. We've never had the
kind of goodwill that the university has had in Germany or
France, where professors are immensely respected. In France,
there's a talk show devoted to academics. There is a respect on
the Continent for academics that there never has been in the
United States; you certainly can't imagine Frederic Jameson on
a I V show. It may be just as well because it keeps us from
being too pompous. But things were fine until about 10 years
ago, when the so-called "culture wars" started. We started
being picked on by the right. They decided that everything we
did was irrelevant or dangerous. They worked to find provoca
tive titles in the MLA convention program, including the infa
mous 'Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl". They will pick
anything to shock the public, not only titles that suggest "dan
gerous" things, like "Marxism" or "queer theory," but titles
that have to do with popular culture. They are always looking
for new causes. One group, the Alumni Forum, has discovered
the Georgetown no longer requires its majors to take a
Shakespeare course. Now students no longer have to take a
course in Shakespeare but instead can take a course on "AIDS
and Its Representations."
I 'heir accusations are hysterical and inaccurate. They
rely on requirements listed in catalogs, which don't tell you
very much about what students really take or learn. If we
dropped our Shakespeare requirement, our Shakespeare class
es would be almost as full. Not having a requirement doesn't
tell you anything. All it tells you is that someone is looking
through your catalog to find something new to excite the pub
lic. That has made academic life very difficult because you feel
a lack of confidence on the part of the public.
Once you start explaining things to people, however,
they are able to recognize that what they have been reading is
geared to generate hysteria. There is a need for every academ
ic to do something to restore public confidence. If every one
of us, every year, did one thing, even a very local thing, it
would make a difference. When you see an attack in your local
paper, whether it be a syndicated columnist or a local editori
al, write a letter. Speak at local senior centers. You easily have
an audience of 200 people. That may seem like a drop in the
bucket. But all of those 200 people vote in percentages that
our completely disproportionate to the rest of the country.
And if they feel goodwill towards what we do, they will vote
for anything that helps education. You must have this kind of
contact with the public. It is to easy, and ultimately dangerous,
for our institutions to be isolated from the public.

What do you tell talented undergraduates or graduate students
who ask you about the job market?
I tell them, do it at your own risk, and don't do it just
because it's going to be intellectually stimulating. It's not
worth that many years of hard work and agony. Some people
disagree with me — they

say graduate school
teaches you critical
thinking and skills that
are transferable. If a per
son feels that he or she
wants to work in a schol
arly framework, wants to
write scholarship, and
also wants to teach stu
dents at the same time,
and feels that there is
absolutely nothing else
that he or she can do in
which they could realize
their potential as well as
they could in academia,
then it may be a good

choice.
But I don't think it is ever the only viable alternative.
For many students, their only role models are professors.
There are other things out there — in law, in the non-profit
world — where you can use your talents. I don't thinks it's
impossible to find intellectual fulfillment outside of the uni
versity. There are other jobs which are extremely challenging
and use all kinds of skills. You may not be working with peo
ple who you consider intellectuals. But if you have a job where
you have you weekends free, you do have time to write and
read when my colleagues and I are correcting papers. If you are
going to spend your 20s and even early 30s preparing for
something that isn't going to pan out, I think it's a waste of
resources and of peoples lives. And I wish people would real
ize that there are other options that give satisfaction to one's
life.
