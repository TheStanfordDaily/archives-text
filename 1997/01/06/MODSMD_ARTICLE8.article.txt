# Where Have All the Professorships Gone?

For some time now, its been apparent that downsizing isn't a Stanford-specific phenomenon. With the end of the Cold War and
its lush defense contracts, as well as an increasing public reluctance to support higher education, newly minted I'h.D.s — even
the best and the brightest — are finding it nearly impossible to find a job, much less one that offers any sort of job security,
full-time employment or benefits. To learn more about the origin and politics of the crises facing the American university, as well as
possible solutions, Arcade Editor in Chief Mia Sara Bruch talked with Herbert Lindenberger, president of the Modern Language
Association (MLA), the professional organization of literary scholars. Lindenberger is the Avalon Professor of the Humanities at
Stanford.

This phenomenon has been a subject of discussion in academic cir
cles for some time, but no one seems to have a precise sense of just

when the trouble began. What is the his
torical context of the job crisis?

As far as are academia is con
cerned, there's been a recession since the
late 7 0s. We had good years through the
50s to the end of the 60s. That's when
anybody getting out of graduate school
— even a nonprestigious one — could
count on several job offers, even before
the dissertation was complete. The Baby
Boom generation was going to college
and the federal government was giving a
lot of money to building up science
departments and circulating money
throughout the university for indirect
costs. Legislatures were also relatively
generous with us — they let colleges
expand and with them the number of
Ph.D.s.
Then, beginning in the early
70s, the demography changed. Nobody
planned in those terms; they assumed an
infinite growth along the lines of the
stock market. There have been some ups
and downs, but demography was such
that after 1970, fewer and fewer kids

entered college. But in the late '80s, I,
along with many of my colleagues, began to tell undergradu
ates that there was going to be a real shortage of academics
beginning in the '90s. We anticipated a lot of retirements
among the generation that entered academia i.' the 50s, and
we knew that the birthrate had started going up again around
1980, as the Baby Boomers began to have children. I hen, all
of a sudden, we had a recession in 1990. The recession only
lasted a couple of years at most. But whereas the rest of the
country recovered, academia remained in a slump. I he num
ber of available jobs plummeted at the very time that demog
raphy was favorable to an expansion of academic jobs.
Then what explains the continuous stagnation?
I know what's happening, and it's not very nice. 1 he
American people have decided not to support higher educa

rion. There's a report by an institute that studies state govern
ment — and it's mostly state money that funds education in

this country — which found that while
the percentage of available funds has
increased for prisons, welfare and
remained steady for primary and sec
ondary education in recent years, the
percentage of state funds that went to
higher education had gone down.
The awful thing is that this is
the very moment at which pressures on
universities are arising from the chil
dren of the Baby Boom, as well as pres
sures from families who didn't necessar
ily go to college who want their chil
dren to get the best possible education
so they can get ahead in life. At the very
time when universities are needed for a
new generation of students, the doors
are closing. What happens? Most state
schools have to find a way to accom
modate everybody who has a certain
G.P.A. What they do not want to do is
hire Ph.D.s for tenure track jobs
because that means you have to make a
commitment to consider them for
tenure, then, once they have tenure,
you have a lifetime contract, and they
become a fixed item in your budget. As
in corporate America, flexibility is the

name of the game. You want people who you can fire easily, or
who you can transfer to other departments. There's a tremen
dous reluctance on the part of universities to hire people for
full-time, long-term jobs. University administrators, under
severe financial constraints and under the pressure of state leg
islatures and hoards of regents, hire part-timers who they don't
have to pay benefits to or hire full-timers only on a year-to
year basis depending on enrollment.
Look at the consequences for students. In the UC sys
tem and the Cal State system, it is understood that it will be
very hard to graduate in four years. To get the classes to fulfill
a major or distribution requirements, you have to take cours
es with enrollment limitations, courses with waiting lists of a
semester or more. And that, combined with increasing regis
tration costs, means that the cost of public education has
become more than many people can manage. Now, many stu-
