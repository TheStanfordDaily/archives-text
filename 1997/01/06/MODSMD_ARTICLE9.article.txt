## Wallace Stegner and Multiculturalism 
### Casey Harmon 
Wallace Stegner taught creative writing at Stanford for
more than 25 years. When he retired from the Farm
in 1971, he left a legacy of teaching, historical schol
arship, fiction and environmental consciousness that remains
relevant and pertinent in today s discourse in all of these areas.
His well-known and Pulitzer Prize-winning novels have been
read by thousands, and his work with the Sierra Club has
resulted in the preservation of more than one of our national
parks. But as important as Stegner is in so many intellectual
and environmental circles, people have rarely turned to his
work to find bits of wisdom on race relations. By not explor
ing this part of Stegner's career, we have deprived ourselves of
the lessons that can be learned from one of America's most
progressive writers of the first half of the 20th century.
In her essay, "Why I Can't Read Wtllace Stegner", the
Native American scholar Elizabeth Cook-Lynn places Wallace
Stegner in the insensitive lineage of white writers who have
exploited indigenous North Americans on the page as well as
in life. It may come as a surprise, then, that Stegner's and
Cook-Lynn's goals and intentions are actually quite similar.
Both have devoted their talent and energy toward decon
structing misrepresentations of the people and country among
which they grew up. Both Stegner and Cook-Lynn help these
people and places reclaim ownership of their pasts that have
been ignored or forgotten by an insensitive, provincial and

ignorant East Coast literary establishment.
The book that placed Stegner at the cutting edge of
thinking about the state of ethnic minorities in the 1940s and
placed him in demand all over the United States as a speaker
about race relations was One Nation. Originally commissioned
by the editors of Look magazine, the book was a record of
Stegner's travels around the country to comment on everyday
life during World War 11. Feeling that the plight of marginal
ized groups was a worthwhile and important area of study,
Stegner convinced the editors to allow him to concentrate his
efforts on minority groups during his travels.
Published in 1945, One Nation stands as an avant
garde work in the way it deals with racism and intolerance in
America. At a time when World War 11 nationalism held the
white population of America in a state of hyper-patriotism,
and held the Japanese-American population in internment
camps, Stegner included a scathing criticism of the horrors
and stupidity of U.S. government policy. This public criticism
of the government and its practices was obviously risky and
uncommon in the pre-1960s United States, yet Stegner,
putting his public reputation and coveted professorship at
Stanford on the line, stuck to his principles and published the
truth â€” not only about the state of Japanese Americans but
about other Asian-American groups, African Americans,
Latino Americans, Jewish Americans and Native Americans.
In fact, upon submitting the completed group of articles that
would become One Nation to the editors of Look magazine for
publication, Stegner was turned away, fearing loss of reader
ship for the pro-minority content of his manuscript. Rather
than put it in their magazine, the editors of Look helped
Stegner find a publisher to keep the touchy material away
from the eyes of most of their subscribers. Their magazine was
to remain placating to the public, serving the unrealized ideal
of an America that was living in a state of conflict-free bliss.
When Cook-Lynn writes, "There is perhaps no
American fiction writer who has been more successful in
serving the interests of a nation's fantasy about itself than
Wallace Stegner," it seems that she is unaware of One Nation
and has not made a good faith attempt to understand the
author she critiques. The book s entire purpose is to explore
the truth about marginalized Americans and the calamities
that befell them based on the racial prejudices of white
Americans. By revealing this truth, Stegner is attempting to
break through the fog of Americas fantasy about itself as the
land of true equality.
Chapter seven of One Nation is perhaps Stegners
greatest refutation of the claims Ms. Cook-Lynn would make
some 50 years later about his insensitivity to Native American
issues. In this chapter, Stegner's emphasis is on the fact that
Native Americans have remained active in this country and
have maintained a foothold in their land and their culture.
Rather than dismiss their presence in favor of a glorified and
