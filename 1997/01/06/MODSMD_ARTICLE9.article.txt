# Finding Common Ground
## Wallace Stegner and Multiculturalism 
### Casey Harmon 
Wallace Stegner taught creative writing at Stanford for
more than 25 years. When he retired from the Farm
in 1971, he left a legacy of teaching, historical schol
arship, fiction and environmental consciousness that remains
relevant and pertinent in today s discourse in all of these areas.
His well-known and Pulitzer Prize-winning novels have been
read by thousands, and his work with the Sierra Club has
resulted in the preservation of more than one of our national
parks. But as important as Stegner is in so many intellectual
and environmental circles, people have rarely turned to his
work to find bits of wisdom on race relations. By not explor
ing this part of Stegner's career, we have deprived ourselves of
the lessons that can be learned from one of America's most
progressive writers of the first half of the 20th century.
In her essay, "Why I Can't Read Wtllace Stegner", the
Native American scholar Elizabeth Cook-Lynn places Wallace
Stegner in the insensitive lineage of white writers who have
exploited indigenous North Americans on the page as well as
in life. It may come as a surprise, then, that Stegner's and
Cook-Lynn's goals and intentions are actually quite similar.
Both have devoted their talent and energy toward decon
structing misrepresentations of the people and country among
which they grew up. Both Stegner and Cook-Lynn help these
people and places reclaim ownership of their pasts that have
been ignored or forgotten by an insensitive, provincial and

ignorant East Coast literary establishment.
The book that placed Stegner at the cutting edge of
thinking about the state of ethnic minorities in the 1940s and
placed him in demand all over the United States as a speaker
about race relations was One Nation. Originally commissioned
by the editors of Look magazine, the book was a record of
Stegner's travels around the country to comment on everyday
life during World War 11. Feeling that the plight of marginal
ized groups was a worthwhile and important area of study,
Stegner convinced the editors to allow him to concentrate his
efforts on minority groups during his travels.
Published in 1945, One Nation stands as an avant
garde work in the way it deals with racism and intolerance in
America. At a time when World War 11 nationalism held the
white population of America in a state of hyper-patriotism,
and held the Japanese-American population in internment
camps, Stegner included a scathing criticism of the horrors
and stupidity of U.S. government policy. This public criticism
of the government and its practices was obviously risky and
uncommon in the pre-1960s United States, yet Stegner,
putting his public reputation and coveted professorship at
Stanford on the line, stuck to his principles and published the
truth — not only about the state of Japanese Americans but
about other Asian-American groups, African Americans,
Latino Americans, Jewish Americans and Native Americans.
In fact, upon submitting the completed group of articles that
would become One Nation to the editors of Look magazine for
publication, Stegner was turned away, fearing loss of reader
ship for the pro-minority content of his manuscript. Rather
than put it in their magazine, the editors of Look helped
Stegner find a publisher to keep the touchy material away
from the eyes of most of their subscribers. Their magazine was
to remain placating to the public, serving the unrealized ideal
of an America that was living in a state of conflict-free bliss.
When Cook-Lynn writes, "There is perhaps no
American fiction writer who has been more successful in
serving the interests of a nation's fantasy about itself than
Wallace Stegner," it seems that she is unaware of One Nation
and has not made a good faith attempt to understand the
author she critiques. The book s entire purpose is to explore
the truth about marginalized Americans and the calamities
that befell them based on the racial prejudices of white
Americans. By revealing this truth, Stegner is attempting to
break through the fog of Americas fantasy about itself as the
land of true equality.
Chapter seven of One Nation is perhaps Stegners
greatest refutation of the claims Ms. Cook-Lynn would make
some 50 years later about his insensitivity to Native American
issues. In this chapter, Stegner's emphasis is on the fact that
Native Americans have remained active in this country and
have maintained a foothold in their land and their culture.
Rather than dismiss their presence in favor of a glorified and

ultimately tragic past, Stegner cclebrates Native Americans'
abilities to deal with the problems and issues facing them as a
people over the years since the Columbian encounter. This
argument, as well as Stegner's concern for the preservation of
tribal customs and pride in the Indian community, is but one
example of how Stegner's 1945 piece anticipates contemporary
discourse on race and history. By discussing the injustices that
have been dealt to Native Americans by the government and
by addressing their continued presence and effectiveness in
modern life, One Nation directly refutes Cook-Lynn's argu
ment. Stegner makes it clear to his readers that Native
American peoples are not gone, even if they are forgotten.
This consciousness of the continued presence and
activity of Native peoples is one of the most important issues
in Native American scholarship. For acknowledging the dis
possesion of Indian peoples by expansion of European — and
later, American — settlement is not the whole story. Stegner's
treatment of the state of Native American life in 1945 stressed
that Native Americans have been a consistent presence in
American history since the European discovery.
So where did Cook-Lynn get her argument that
Stegner served the nation's fantasy about itself more than any
other writer? It seems that her classification of Stegner as a
typically insensitive white American writer might have come
from a swift perusal of Stegner's fiction, much of which takes

place on the plains of southern Saskatchewan and North
Dakota, in the basin of the Great Salt Lake and other tradi
tional homelands of Native Americans before the encroach
ment of Europeans. As Cook-Lynn laments throughout her
book, his novels and short stories lack Native American char
acters and fail to discuss their presence in these areas where the
native population maintained — and still maintains — a pres
ence. She points out that Stegner "saw himself as native' to the
Dakota states, to lowa, the Montana and Canadian border
country, that is, the Northern Plains," thus denying the exis
tence of indigenous people by claiming to be a "native. Using

these isolated passages of Stegner's fiction, Cook-Lynn sees
him as part the canon of authors' works in which authors
claim a close affinity with the land they write about and ignore
the presence of its original inhabitants. Cook-Lynn asserts that
this type of omission by men and women of letters, whose
works add to the general public opinion that Native American
peoples are indeed gone from the lands they once inhabited
adds to the continued misconception whites have about the
current state of Native Americans today. This misconception,
she argues, also "clears the consciences' of white Americans,
allowing them to forget the fact that Natives are still alive and
aware of their heritage; that they are aware of the legacy of
injustice they have inherited at the hands of the U.S. govern
ment.
Cook-Lynn is right to point out here is no doubt the
deliberate ignorance about Native peoples in some of
America's greatest literary works. Faulkner's Mississippi lacks
any reminders of the tribal history of the area, and Poe's
Baltimore and Richard Wright's Chicago seem unaware of it as
well. The canonical American literary landscape is not popu
lated by Native Americans. And admittedly, Stegner's treat
ment southern Saskatchewan, North Dakota, Montana and
Utah, homes of the Lakota Soiux, Osage and Paiute, frequent
ly ignores these groups. Rut Wallace Stegner should not be
thought of as an unaware promoter of false histories, especial
ly when dealing with the people and land of the American
west. In Wolf Willow, Stegner remembers the lack of local his
tory as something that detracted from his childhood educa
tion. While he read of foreign lands and social crises of past
centuries, he was left with no tools to intellectually relate ti
the Plains environment he lived in. The songs, limericks and
ballads that his father sang lacked the substance of a regional
literary and historical tradition. So by default, Stegner was
forced to learn from literature that was removed and inapplic
able to his life in the last regions of a vanishing frontier. Kven
in school, his imported, Eastern-trained teachers taught only
traditional subjects, and the lack of relevance of the West was
further ingrained in students' heads. "Kducation tried, inade
quately, to make a European out of me, Stegner once wrote.
There is an ironic similarity between this anecdote and the his
torical legacy of forced education of Native Americans instate
boarding schools, so the American government could make
Europeans of the Native Americans, "killing the Indian but
saving the man."
As Stegner and Cook-Lynn try to refute the myths
about their very Western land and people, readers see another
example of the common ground between them. Both are stew
ards of the land beyond the 98th meridian that defines the
American West, and they have each suffered from the preju
dice of the East coast in their own way. In an essay written
after Stegner's death, scholar Richard Etulain wrote that
Stegner knew that "premier writing must link the provincial
with the universal. Stegner was one of the first Western writ
ers to successfully link the local and lessons of his region to
nation-wide themes. Of course, there were plenty before him

whose books were trying to do the same thing, hilt only a man
of Stegner's talent and depth of thinking could force the rest
of the country to actually listen, and take a Westerner serious
ly.
All of the misconceptions that the Eastern United
States had about Stegners West made it difficult for him and
his Western colleagues to send their message. The label of
"Western writer" was something he deeply resented, for he felt
that the regional qualifier on the front of the phrase automat
ically reduced the individual to a lesser status than the more
universal designation of "writer." The fact that New
Englanders were the only ones privy to the title of simply
"writer" made Stegner resent their dismissal of the talent that
lay out West. Indeed, as novel after novel by Stegner was
snubbed by Eastern reviewers, Stegner's importance as a writer
and prophet of the West was hidden from national eyes.
When what many consider his masterpiece, Angle of Repose
won a Pulitzer Prize, and The Spectator Bird won the National
Book Award, The New York limes Book Review finally wrote a
piece on Stegner, calling him the "dean of Western writers.
Then they printed a handsome picture of his Norwegian face
and under it the caption: William Stegner.
The same Eastern establishment men and women of
letters who had refused to give Stegner and his fellow writers
in the Western community their due credit represented the
same sort of exclusionary approach that engendered the
notion of the vanished Indian tribes. By separating herself
from Wallace Stegner rather than finding her commonalty
with him, Cook-Lynn sets up a false battle in which she and
Stegner are fighting the same opponent.
Cook-Lynn's statement that much of American litera
ture contributes to the politics of possession and dispossession
is accurate, but her inclusion of Stegner's work in the canon of
such literature is inappropriate. Stegner's writing combats
some of the same myths that Cook-Lynn and her contempo
raries in Native American studies seek to critique. Half a cen
tury later, the message of Stegner's writings is consonant with
the contemporary work which seeks to reform our notion of
race and nationhood.

"writer" made Stegner resent their dismissal of the talent that
lay out West. Indeed, as novel after novel by Stegner was
snubbed by Eastern reviewers, Stegner's importance as a writer
and prophet of the West was hidden from national eyes.
When what many consider his masterpiece, Angle of Repose
won a Pulitzer Prize, and The Spectator Bird won the National
Book Award, The New York limes Book Review finally wrote a
piece on Stegner, calling him the "dean of Western writers.
Then they printed a handsome picture of his Norwegian face
and under it the caption: William Stegner.
The same Eastern establishment men and women of
letters who had refused to give Stegner and his fellow writers
in the Western community their due credit represented the
same sort of exclusionary approach that engendered the
notion of the vanished Indian tribes. By separating herself
from Wallace Stegner rather than finding her commonalty
with him, Cook-Lynn sets up a false battle in which she and
Stegner are fighting the same opponent.
Cook-Lynn's statement that much of American litera
ture contributes to the politics of possession and dispossession
is accurate, but her inclusion of Stegner's work in the canon of
such literature is inappropriate. Stegner's writing combats
some of the same myths that Cook-Lynn and her contempo
raries in Native American studies seek to critique. Half a cen
tury later, the message of Stegner's writings is consonant with
the contemporary work which seeks to reform our notion of
race and nationhood.
Casey Harmon is a senior majoring in American studies. He is

Wallace Stegner taught creative writing at Stanford for
more than 25 years. When he retired from the Farm
in 1971, he left a legacy of teaching, historical schol
arship, fiction and environmental consciousness that remains
relevant and pertinent in today s discourse in all of these areas.
His well-known and Pulitzer Prize-winning novels have been
read by thousands, and his work with the Sierra Club has
resulted in the preservation of more than one of our national
parks. But as important as Stegner is in so many intellectual
and environmental circles, people have rarely turned to his
work to find bits of wisdom on race relations. By not explor
ing this part of Stegner's career, we have deprived ourselves of
the lessons that can be learned from one of America's most
progressive writers of the first half of the 20th century.
In her essay, "Why I Can't Read Wtllace Stegner", the
Native American scholar Elizabeth Cook-Lynn places Wallace
Stegner in the insensitive lineage of white writers who have
exploited indigenous North Americans on the page as well as
in life. It may come as a surprise, then, that Stegner's and
Cook-Lynn's goals and intentions are actually quite similar.
Both have devoted their talent and energy toward decon
structing misrepresentations of the people and country among
which they grew up. Both Stegner and Cook-Lynn help these
people and places reclaim ownership of their pasts that have
been ignored or forgotten by an insensitive, provincial and

ignorant East Coast literary establishment.
The book that placed Stegner at the cutting edge of
thinking about the state of ethnic minorities in the 1940s and
placed him in demand all over the United States as a speaker
about race relations was One Nation. Originally commissioned
by the editors of Look magazine, the book was a record of
Stegner's travels around the country to comment on everyday
life during World War 11. Feeling that the plight of marginal
ized groups was a worthwhile and important area of study,
Stegner convinced the editors to allow him to concentrate his
efforts on minority groups during his travels.
Published in 1945, One Nation stands as an avant
garde work in the way it deals with racism and intolerance in
America. At a time when World War 11 nationalism held the
white population of America in a state of hyper-patriotism,
and held the Japanese-American population in internment
camps, Stegner included a scathing criticism of the horrors
and stupidity of U.S. government policy. This public criticism
of the government and its practices was obviously risky and
uncommon in the pre-1960s United States, yet Stegner,
putting his public reputation and coveted professorship at
Stanford on the line, stuck to his principles and published the
truth — not only about the state of Japanese Americans but
about other Asian-American groups, African Americans,
Latino Americans, Jewish Americans and Native Americans.
In fact, upon submitting the completed group of articles that
would become One Nation to the editors of Look magazine for
publication, Stegner was turned away, fearing loss of reader
ship for the pro-minority content of his manuscript. Rather
than put it in their magazine, the editors of Look helped
Stegner find a publisher to keep the touchy material away
from the eyes of most of their subscribers. Their magazine was
to remain placating to the public, serving the unrealized ideal
of an America that was living in a state of conflict-free bliss.
When Cook-Lynn writes, "There is perhaps no
American fiction writer who has been more successful in
serving the interests of a nation's fantasy about itself than
Wallace Stegner," it seems that she is unaware of One Nation
and has not made a good faith attempt to understand the
author she critiques. The book s entire purpose is to explore
the truth about marginalized Americans and the calamities
that befell them based on the racial prejudices of white
Americans. By revealing this truth, Stegner is attempting to
break through the fog of Americas fantasy about itself as the
land of true equality.
Chapter seven of One Nation is perhaps Stegners
greatest refutation of the claims Ms. Cook-Lynn would make
some 50 years later about his insensitivity to Native American
issues. In this chapter, Stegner's emphasis is on the fact that
Native Americans have remained active in this country and
have maintained a foothold in their land and their culture.
Rather than dismiss their presence in favor of a glorified and

ultimately tragic past, Stegner cclebrates Native Americans'
abilities to deal with the problems and issues facing them as a
people over the years since the Columbian encounter. This
argument, as well as Stegner's concern for the preservation of
tribal customs and pride in the Indian community, is but one
example of how Stegner's 1945 piece anticipates contemporary
discourse on race and history. By discussing the injustices that
have been dealt to Native Americans by the government and
by addressing their continued presence and effectiveness in
modern life, One Nation directly refutes Cook-Lynn's argu
ment. Stegner makes it clear to his readers that Native
American peoples are not gone, even if they are forgotten.
This consciousness of the continued presence and
activity of Native peoples is one of the most important issues
in Native American scholarship. For acknowledging the dis
possesion of Indian peoples by expansion of European — and
later, American — settlement is not the whole story. Stegner's
treatment of the state of Native American life in 1945 stressed
that Native Americans have been a consistent presence in
American history since the European discovery.
So where did Cook-Lynn get her argument that
Stegner served the nation's fantasy about itself more than any
other writer? It seems that her classification of Stegner as a
typically insensitive white American writer might have come
from a swift perusal of Stegner's fiction, much of which takes

place on the plains of southern Saskatchewan and North
Dakota, in the basin of the Great Salt Lake and other tradi
tional homelands of Native Americans before the encroach
ment of Europeans. As Cook-Lynn laments throughout her
book, his novels and short stories lack Native American char
acters and fail to discuss their presence in these areas where the
native population maintained — and still maintains — a pres
ence. She points out that Stegner "saw himself as native' to the
Dakota states, to lowa, the Montana and Canadian border
country, that is, the Northern Plains," thus denying the exis
tence of indigenous people by claiming to be a "native. Using

these isolated passages of Stegner's fiction, Cook-Lynn sees
him as part the canon of authors' works in which authors
claim a close affinity with the land they write about and ignore
the presence of its original inhabitants. Cook-Lynn asserts that
this type of omission by men and women of letters, whose
works add to the general public opinion that Native American
peoples are indeed gone from the lands they once inhabited
adds to the continued misconception whites have about the
current state of Native Americans today. This misconception,
she argues, also "clears the consciences' of white Americans,
allowing them to forget the fact that Natives are still alive and
aware of their heritage; that they are aware of the legacy of
injustice they have inherited at the hands of the U.S. govern
ment.
Cook-Lynn is right to point out here is no doubt the
deliberate ignorance about Native peoples in some of
America's greatest literary works. Faulkner's Mississippi lacks
any reminders of the tribal history of the area, and Poe's
Baltimore and Richard Wright's Chicago seem unaware of it as
well. The canonical American literary landscape is not popu
lated by Native Americans. And admittedly, Stegner's treat
ment southern Saskatchewan, North Dakota, Montana and
Utah, homes of the Lakota Soiux, Osage and Paiute, frequent
ly ignores these groups. Rut Wallace Stegner should not be
thought of as an unaware promoter of false histories, especial
ly when dealing with the people and land of the American
west. In Wolf Willow, Stegner remembers the lack of local his
tory as something that detracted from his childhood educa
tion. While he read of foreign lands and social crises of past
centuries, he was left with no tools to intellectually relate ti
the Plains environment he lived in. The songs, limericks and
ballads that his father sang lacked the substance of a regional
literary and historical tradition. So by default, Stegner was
forced to learn from literature that was removed and inapplic
able to his life in the last regions of a vanishing frontier. Kven
in school, his imported, Eastern-trained teachers taught only
traditional subjects, and the lack of relevance of the West was
further ingrained in students' heads. "Kducation tried, inade
quately, to make a European out of me, Stegner once wrote.
There is an ironic similarity between this anecdote and the his
torical legacy of forced education of Native Americans instate
boarding schools, so the American government could make
Europeans of the Native Americans, "killing the Indian but
saving the man."
As Stegner and Cook-Lynn try to refute the myths
about their very Western land and people, readers see another
example of the common ground between them. Both are stew
ards of the land beyond the 98th meridian that defines the
American West, and they have each suffered from the preju
dice of the East coast in their own way. In an essay written
after Stegner's death, scholar Richard Etulain wrote that
Stegner knew that "premier writing must link the provincial
with the universal. Stegner was one of the first Western writ
ers to successfully link the local and lessons of his region to
nation-wide themes. Of course, there were plenty before him

whose books were trying to do the same thing, hilt only a man
of Stegner's talent and depth of thinking could force the rest
of the country to actually listen, and take a Westerner serious
ly.
All of the misconceptions that the Eastern United
States had about Stegners West made it difficult for him and
his Western colleagues to send their message. The label of
"Western writer" was something he deeply resented, for he felt
that the regional qualifier on the front of the phrase automat
ically reduced the individual to a lesser status than the more
universal designation of "writer." The fact that New
Englanders were the only ones privy to the title of simply
"writer" made Stegner resent their dismissal of the talent that
lay out West. Indeed, as novel after novel by Stegner was
snubbed by Eastern reviewers, Stegner's importance as a writer
