## Gingrich refuses to surrender power 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Shrugging off a fellow Republi
can's call to surrender power, a
confident Newt Gingrich met pri
vately with the GOP rank and
file yesterday to firm up support
for a new term as speaker despite
his admission that he violated
House rules.
Gingrich predicted he would
prevail when Congress convenes
today and become the first GOP
speaker to win consecutive terms
in 68 years.
But even before he stepped
before the closed-door caucus to
make his case came a fresh sign
of his political vulnerability. In a
written statement, 11-term lowa
Republican Jim Leach said Gin
grich was "ethically damaged."
"For the country's sake," he
said, Gingrich should step down
and another GOP leader should
be selected in his place.
As the caucus began, a small
group of Republicans remained
uncommitted. "I have not yet
decided," said one, Rep. Marge

Roukema of New Jersey.
The political drama surround
ing Gingrich has dominated the
run-up to the opening of the
105 th Congress today. Election
of a speaker is customarily a cut
and-dried process, with the
majority party ensuring that its
candidate prevails.
In this case, though, Gingrich
has been struggling to hold
wavering GOP lawmakers in line
since his admission two weeks
ago that he violated House rules.
After two years of steadfast
denials, he conceded on Dec. 21
that "in my name and over my
signature, inaccurate, incom
plete and unreliable statements
were given to the (ethics) com
mittee." In addition, he agreed to
a committee statement that said
he had failed to "seek and follow"
legal advice that would have told
him he was improperly using tax
exempt organizations to further
political aims.
The ethics committee is
expected to meet in the next sev

eral days to determine Gingrich's
punishment, and ultimately the
issue will reach the House floor.
Republicans on the panel have
signaled they believe a repri
mand is appropriate — a sanc
tion that would permit him to
retain his powerful post. Even so,
individual Republicans will be in
the politically touchy situation
today of casting their votes in the
speaker's election without being
able to hear the evidence laid out
in public — and without being
able to gauge the public reaction
to it.
Even so, there seemed little if
anything to suggest that Gin
grich would heed Leach's advice
to step aside.
"Tomorrow, when I'm sworn
in, I will be the first Republican
speaker to be sworn twice in a
row in 68 years," he said at a
breakfast in his congressional
district in Georgia before his
return to Washington.
He added, "I have been
through in the last month all

sorts of emotions, as you can
imagine — from going to my
mother's and having TV cameras
outside as we talked about what
she's going to do now that my
dad's dead, going to my mother
in-law's and having TV cameras
outside as we try to celebrate
Christmas. . . . This has not been
as much fun as people sometimes
think."
Since his carefully scripted
admission of wrongdoing in his
ethics case two weeks ago, Gin
grich has been waging a forceful
campaign to retain his powerful
post. While he agreed with the
ethics committee not to speak
publicly about his case, the Geor
gian has been contacting fellow
Republican lawmakers by tele
phone to ease their concerns. In
public, meanwhile, the GOP
hierarchy in the House has been
united in its support.
Leach's defection surprised
GOP leaders, although they min
imized the importance of his
defection.
