Social Security insecure?
WASHINGTON (AP) — Billions of dollars in Social Security
money would be invested in the volatile stock market rather than in
safe government bonds under proposals put forward by a splintered
government panel.
A year behind schedule, the Social Security Advisory Council
released its final report yesterday on how to rescue the government's
biggest benefit program from bankruptcy in the next century.
However, the panel produced not a single set of recommendations
but three rival options. All three plans would seek to boost workers'
retirement nest eggs by allowing Social Security funds to be invested
in the stock market. But the three plans differed sharply on how
those stock investments would be handled.
California's not so sunny after all
MERIDIAN, Calif. (AP) — Crews desperately shored up failing
levees yesterday to stem flooding that has already turned parts of
California's agricultural Central Valley into a freshwater sea. Good
weather elsewhere allowed thousands of people to return home.
In the Northwest, rivers continued to recede, but authorities wor
ried about mudslides, particularly in Seattle, where 100 slides in the
past week have blocked roads and destroyed homes.
In the Central Valley, farmers have expressed concern about flood
waters damaging winter wheat and other grains that have just been
planted. The flooding has also damaged orchards and vineyards in the
region, a major supplier to the nation of winter fruits and vegetables.
