Stanford teams' recent
victories prove Athletic
Department's strength

WITH ALL ITS academic
excellence, Stanford's
athletic prowess tends to
be neglected by the masses. Mem
bers of the Stanford community
are acutely aware of the successes
of Stanford sports, but the casual
sports fan on the outside or even
at another college doesn't think of
the Cardinal as an athletic power
house. But this year, more than
ever before, that perception could
— and should — change.
Stanford already shares with
UCLA the record for most Nation
al Collegiate Athletic Association
championships in a school year
(five), but 1996-97 could take the
standard to unreachable levels.
The Cardinal claimed three
national titles before New Year's
Day, something never before
accomplished. Stanford earned
just two national crowns last year
but matched that in one day this
year when both men's and
women's cross country teams
brought home rings. When
women's volleyball earned its
third title two weeks ago, the Car
dinal claimed its third national
title of the quarter.
Other institutions simply can
not match the widespread success
of Stanford, which has plenty of
squads capable of duplicating the
feat of the fall. The women's bas
ketball team is currently ranked
third and was a preseason favorite
to win it all. Both men's and
women's tennis are expected to
contend for championships; the
men have already won the last
two. Men's and women's swim
ming are feared year in and year
out, and the women have taken
the last five crowns.
Men's gymnastics, men's volley
ball and women's golf are all
regarded as national powers, and
baseball, men's basketball and

men's golf are expected to make
noise in NCAA tournaments.
Probably 10 different sports can
all claim legitimate shots at NCAA
titles, an accomplishment once
thought to be utterly unapproach
able.
Skeptics have been quick to crit
icize the Department of Athletics
for Stanford's relative lack of suc
cess in the so-called major sports
and for sparse student and com
munity interest, but Stanford
appears to be addressing those
concerns as well. Football's whop
ping victory in the Sun Bowl on
New Year's Eve has left the Cardi
nal with the second-longest win
ning streak in the country, and
Stanford will be one of the
favorites to win the conference
next year for the first time in 26
years. And men's basketball near
ly sold out a game on Dec. 28
against Navy, a remarkable feat
for the middle of the holiday break
against a lackluster opponent.
With recent recruiting success,
men's basketball appears ready to
become entrenched among the
nation's elite in perhaps the coun
try's most fiercely competitive
sport.
Athletic director Ted Leland
and his department have accom
plished these tasks without a
trace of major scandal and with a
limited pool of high school ath
letes for recruiting. While Stan
ford's academic reputation
undoubtedly aids in securing
those athletes who can scholasti
cally compete at Stanford, other
schools which offer athletic schol
arships (the Ivy League does not)
have a larger number of athletes
from which to choose. While the
pieces have been in place for
excellence in a few Stanford
sports for decades, most teams
have experienced their resur
gence within the past decade to
give Stanford the premier athletic
juggernaut in the history of col
lege sports — not bad for a school
universally regarded for academic
supremacy.
