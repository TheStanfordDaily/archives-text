Affirmative action depends on people's consciences

MANY OF US in or near the politi
cal center favor some sort of affir
mative action — giving the nod to
worthy candidates from generally disfa
vored groups (a Christian idea, lest we for
get) — but not legally. By definition, jus
tice, typically imagined as a balanced
weighing device, is impartial in dealing
with individuals not guilty of crimes.
In the family, good parents follow an
unwritten law along those lines; all the
children are treated equally. But life is not
just the horizontally balancing dimension

of the rational, the plural, the "meto
nymic"; the other important dimension is
that of the singular, the excellent (and
inferior), the unfairly beautiful (as Salieri
agonizingly heard Mozart) and so on.
Most parents also prefer one child over
the others for a variety of possible rea
sons. This tends to bother them in terms
of justice, and they often try to make up
for it in one way or another — a familiar
part of the human drama, folklore and
classic literature.
The important point here is that such

irrational preferences and amends cannot
be dealt with properly by law. They are
too complex, variable, idiosyncratic for
anything other than individual judgment
based on spiritual sensitivity.
In short, though outright discrimina
tion is, and long has been, illegal, accept
able affirmative action depends on the
consciences of the general population.
Imperfect as the rest of existence, one
knows that it will go on in our imperfect
but reasonably decent society.
Though the power-wielders at Stanford

will cling to the rigid guidelines of liberal
social engineering in this regard — that is
the way it always is with isolated groups,
historically — a look around tells us this
is a doomed remnant of a rapidly passing
era. Not only is the strong majority of all
Americans against such legal preferences,
a Roper Survey of campus opinion — fac
ulty and student — across the country
has just now revealed a comparable two
to-one preponderance.
