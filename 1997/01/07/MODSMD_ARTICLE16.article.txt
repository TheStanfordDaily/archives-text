# CSRE is positive step but Stanford must add Islam to curriculum
## 
### 
As a student at Stanford, I am
pleased to see that the University is
finally taking an interest in the academ
ic study of the many diverse peoples
who have contributed to our nation's
history and who are now, more than
ever, contributing vitally to the Univer
sity itself. I am optimistic that the
administration will now be more open
minded with regard to the academic
interests and needs of their students.
The implementation of the Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity Pro
gram should ideally pave the way for
other long-neglected subjects at Stan
ford, including a Middle Eastern Stud
ies program (successful programs exist
at both Harvard and UC-Berkeley) or
the inclusion of classes focusing on
Islam. Either due to gross negligence or
apathy, Stanford has failed to include
even one course on Islam within its
Religious Studies Program, a horren
dous oversight considering that Mus
lims constitute one-fifth of the world's
population (1 billion people). Just as
many wonder how the CSRE Program
will thrive without the minority profes

sors necessary to give insight into eth
nic studies, how does Stanford's admin
istration expect to provide a well-round
ed and comprehensive study of religious
diversity without having one Islamic
scholar on its faculty?
It is quite an achievement, however,
that in this "era of cutbacks," the Univer
sity is still able to puts its faith in a new
interdisciplinary program. I hope that the
CSRE Program survives and flourishes,
not only to give full benefit to the students
who desire to learn about rich heritages
and struggles of diverse peoples, and about
current vital issues concerning ethnicity,
but also to open the door for other pro
grams which this institution must include
if it is to embrace fully the diversity of our
world and of its own student body.
