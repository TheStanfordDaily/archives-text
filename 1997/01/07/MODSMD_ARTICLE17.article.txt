# Butterfield will be missed by members of Employee Round Table
## 
### 
The elimination of her office at the
end of 1996 marked the end of the
tenure of Barbara Butterfield as vice
president for faculty and staff services
She used her office to attempt to
improve working conditions and ulti

mately to improve the morale of the
staff and faculty of the University. She
was especially effective in providing a
means of communication between the
University administration and the staff.
Among the ways that Butterfield com
municated with the staff was a forum
known as the Employee Round Table.
Staff members from different departments
with varied backgrounds came together
with her once a month. We shared our
concerns and listened to special presenta
tions on a wide variety of issues of impor
tance to the Stanford community. We
want to use this opportunity to thank But
terfield for sharing with us her goals for
improving Stanford and, especially, for lis
tening to our viewpoints.
