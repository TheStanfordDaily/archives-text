# University's parking policy: an experiment gone horribly wrong
## 
### 
Bravo to Bill Trabucco's Dec. 4 letter

regarding Stanford's broken parking
policy and the self-righteous petty
bureaucrats who are trying to ban cars
from campus. Try living my life with
out a car and then talk to me about giv
ing mine up.
The people being penalized by Stan
ford's punitive and outrageously expen
sive parking policies are those who can
not afford or are not eligible to live on
campus — the staff and the postdoctor
al students — and affordable housing is
frequently not near convenient public
transportation.
What few people at Stanford today
may not realize is that when the very
first parking fee was levied it was touted
as a "one-year — or at the most two-year
— experiment" — just a minimal fee to
pay for some much-needed additional
parking lots to be built — and came with
a promise to go back to free parking as
soon as the new lots were paid for.
But once the funds started rolling
in, the powers that be were never will
ing to give that free money up, and the
fees just got higher and higher. My
boss remembers the letter he got back
in the '70s recruiting him to a faculty
position at Stanford — a great collegial
atmosphere with "plenty of free park
ing spaces." Ha!
