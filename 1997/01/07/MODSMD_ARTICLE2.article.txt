## Sports medicine posts filled 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
In a move to strengthen its sports medi
cine program, the Stanford Medical Center
has expanded its staff by filling two new
leadership posts.
Dr. Michael Dillingham, an internation
ally recognized sports-medicine practition
er, has been appointed the executive direc
tor of sports medicine at Stanford Health
Services. Team physician for the San Fran
cisco 49ers, he heads the private Sports, Or
thopedic and Rehabilitation group.
An academic division of sports medicine
will be created under the Department of
Functional Restoration. Assoc. Medicine
Prof. Gordon Matheson will lead it and also
continue to direct the sports medicine pro
gram in the Department of Athletics.
While Dillingham will take charge of the
inpatient, surgery-related side of the pro
gram, Matheson will head the academic
sidp, including teaching, fellowships and
outpatient care.
The new appointments indicate that
"sports medicine has grown sufficiently to

warrant a structure within the University"
and that the administration is seriously
committed to developing a world-class
sports medicine program, Matheson said.
Dillingham and Matheson will now look
into the resources available for the pro
gram's expansion. The next step will be an
appointment of a business manager who
will report to both officials and assist in
forming a more detailed and thorough plan.
According to Michael Goodkind, a
spokesman for the Medical Center, a leader
with Dillingham's international reputation
"will make the program's focus grow more
toward clinical care of the public."
Knowledge acquired through treatment
of athletes can have important applications
to the treatment of other patients, and
Dillingham will make sure that the benefits
of the program carry over into the public,
Goodkind said.
Matheson agreed that an outpatient
clinic with a broad base is a crucial goal. He
stressed the benefits of hiring a business
manager, who wili provide the analysis
needed to take further steps to expand the
program.
