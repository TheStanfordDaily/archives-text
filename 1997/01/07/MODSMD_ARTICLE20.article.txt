## Getting hooked on Ebonics 
### 
I've always said it. No one believed me. I
said it over and over again, but white
folks just wouldn't believe me. "Stop
these silly delusions, little Negro boy," they
contended, "You're not bilingual." "Yes, I
am! English is not my primary language.
"Black-folks-speak is!"
Thanks to the Oakland Public Schools,
my little affirmation has been given a little
credence and has gotten Americans of all
backgrounds involved in the debate over
whether or not black English is a language
unto itself.
When I come to think of it, hardly any
one in my neighborhood speaks Standard
American English (also known as SAE).
Hell, you're more likely to find a theist
professor at Stanford than hear Standard
American English spoken on Phoenix's
poor south side. The tongue of choice is
either Spanish or black English — now
known as Ebonics. If we sent one of Stan
ford's good ol' boys into the hood, and had
them ... say ... order some chicken at the
local Popeye's, I think we'd have a nice for
mula for chaos. One of two tilings would
happen: 1) The man behind the counter
would speak only Spanish, being able to
perhaps mouth (at best) a few phrases in
English like "Bienvenidos a Popeye's! Can I
take you order?" 2) Or, Flannery, our good
ol' boy, would get Dwayne and Shaquesha
on the other end: "Ima' hook ya' up — a
grip of da' fowl stuff fo' only 10 ducats?"
Flannery might as well be in another
country.
But the case is no different for blacks
either. If Tyrone took Shaquesha to the

opera, he couldn't flex his Ebonics skills at
the ticket office: "Hey, Chez Whitey, am I
good fo' da' hook up? Me and my biyotch
wanna get our swerve on!"
Chez Whitey, unfamiliar with this
bizarre tongue might feel threatened ...
and call the cops.
I suppose it's good that most black folks
don't like opera to begin with.
There is no question that Ebonics and
Standard American English have their dif
ferences; few whites can understand
African-American vernacular. However,
every black in this country understands
English.
This is where I have difficulty with the
Oakland Schools' proposal.
Standard American English, though
perhaps not as attractive as Ebonics, is
appropriate in all occasions ... even at
Popeye's. Jos6, Dwayne and Shaquesha
H&Ufit U ftbfeto 'Speak English as well as
Flanneiy — the good ol' boy from Stan
ford.
Yet the Oakland Schools' system
doesn't seem to think so.
They want to surrender the good fight
to ghetto slang. "Forget the rhymes of Dr.
Seuss! Bring on the lyrics of Dr. Dr6. He
gots better things to say!" My beef is not
with the study of Ebonics. The develop
ment and dynamics of language has always
been an engaging and provocative topic.
However, when the focus shifts from
philology to teaching English as a second
language for blacks, I become offended.
What are we saying: "Niggas don't
speak English?"

I can assure you that every black Amer
ican in my neighborhood understands and
can speak English; it is simply that they
choose not to — unlike the young Mexican
immigrants who can neither speak nor
comprehend English. Yet Oakland insists
on Ebonics as the sole hope of reaching
those underachievers in their school dis
trict.
Who the hell do they think they're kid
ding?
It appears to me as if Ebonics is an
excuse for bad teaching in Oakland Public
Schools. When I was in elementary school,
Ebonics was forbidden in the classroom;
only English was to be spoken — and
rightfully so! Good teachers would abhor
the "ain't's" and double negatives com
monly associated with Ebonics. But Oak
land has opted to embrace this corrupted
form of communication in the classroom.
"To hell with English; let's be certain our
students are comfortable in the classroom;
let's protect their cute culture and lan
guage." And thus a new wave of half-assed,
miseducated Negroes enter the next mil
lennium.
Thank God Oakland has only half a mil
lion people.
