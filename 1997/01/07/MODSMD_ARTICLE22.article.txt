## Fans, festivities make for fun in football's Sun 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
EL PASO, Texas — 38-0.
Ouch. My heart goes out to
Spartan fans everywhere dur
ing this time of grief. But
everyone should know that
this year's Sun Bowl experi
ence was much more than a
mere football game. For those
of you who did not have the
opportunity to spend a splen
did three days in lovely El
Paso, Texas, here's a quick
rundown of the brouhaha
behind the bowl.
The Fans
The Sun Bowl drew three
distinct types of fans: alumni,
students and those I affection
ately dub "oblivious locals."
The Stanford alumni made up
most of the Cardinal contin
gency and could be spotted
from halfway across the Ari
zona desert.
They sported a plethora of
Stanford Indian apparel and
could occasionally be heard
substituting a mock Native
American battle cry for a more
acceptable show of support.
The ladies flashed diamond
rings that made the Hope Dia
mond look like a granule of
zirconium dust, and the gen
tlemen found other ways to
show just how rich all Stan
ford students are going to be
when they graduate. I can't
wait.
The students in the crowd
were also quite distinctive.

They had arrived at the game
in the shuttle bus of a local
hole-in-the-wall hotel where
they had crammed 22 people
into two rooms. A majority
were still digesting a McDon
ald's extra-value meal and had
just enough spending money
to buy a stick of gum at 1942
prices. But they cheered. The
students made noise.
The same cannot be said of
the locals. They made up close
to 80 percent of the Sun Bowl
crowd, but produced only 5
percent of the noise and cheer
ing. These "oblivious locals"
couldn't have cared less about
the football game itself. In
fact, one whole end zone of the
stadium full of locals spent the
entire second half tossing a
football around and trying to
start the wave. These folks
were so out of touch with the
game, they wouldn't have
even noticed if Jesus Christ
had come again on the Sun
Bowl 50-yard line.
The Maseot
Its football team may have
reeked, but Michigan State
brought along a styling mas
cot to the Sun Bowl. The tra
ditional Spartan Mascot is
"Sparty," the muscle-ripped
foam rubber fella that, inci
dentally, bears no resem
blance to Lawrence Olivier but
is a dead ringer for Kirk Dou
glas. Maybe if Michigan State
had started Sparty at right
tackle Stanford would not have
disemboweled the Spartans for
257 yards on the ground.
The Administrators
It was sure nice to see Stan
ford President Gerhard Casper
and Provost Condoleezza Rice at
the pregame rally and Sun Bowl
contest. In fact, I had the honor
(by coincidence) of taking
Casper's same flight from
Phoenix to El Paso.
We both represented the Uni
versity well on the flight,
although our experiences on the
90-minute ride varied greatly.
After all, I was squished in a
middle coach seat flanked by
two nightmare youngsters that
made the "Children of the Corn"
look like the kids of Miss Man
ners while Casper enjoyed the
luxury of a first-class ride. At
least I no longer need to wonder
in what manner the tuition I
paid last fall was spent.
The City
El Paso is a city of 600,000 in
the far western tip of the Texas
panhandle; I like to refer to El
Paso as lying deep in the left
armpit of the Lone Star state. As
nice as the people of El Paso
were (El Pasoans? El Pasoni
ans?), the city itself is not likely
to be among my choice locations
for settling down and starting a
family. Then there was the con
versation I overheard in my
hotel lobby between two employ
ees of the hotel:
"Man, we sure do have a lot of
Stanford folks here tonight"
(spelled without phonetics of
hickish Southern accent).
"Yeah. Say, where is Stanford
anyway?"

"I don't know. But I think it's
hot there."
Let's just say that I still curse
the Aloha Bowl committee for
choosing Cal.
The New Year Celebration
The Sun Bowl was on New
Year's Eve; that left hundreds of
Stanford and Michigan State
fans in the bustling metropolis
of El Paso and Juarez, Mexico,
to ring in the new year. As scary
as that may sound, El Paso actu
ally had much to offer. For one,
it was the chance of a lifetime to
celebrate the coming of the new
year twice.
El Paso lies on the border
between Mexico and the United
States. But Mexico does not fol
low daylight savings time. Thus,
it was an hour later in Juarez,
right across the bridge from
downtown El Paso. After ring
ing in 1997 in Mexico, we raced
back in time across the river and
re-lived the last 60 minutes of
1996. Once I got to Juarez, how
ever, the best thing to do was
leave. The fact is, time was the
only facet in which Mexico was
ahead of the United States.
The Game Numbers
With all this said, there was
also a football game in El Paso,
and the Stanford Cardinal abso
lutely annihilated Michigan
State. If you didn't believe the
38-0 score, perhaps you'll be per
suaded by these telling numbers:
• Average gain per play: Stan
ford 6.3, Michigan State 3.4.
• Number of punts: Stanford
2, Michigan State 9.
• Time of possession: Stan
ford 35:42, Michigan State
24:18.
• Combined weight of the
biggest four Stanford offensive
linemen: 1,169 pounds. Weight of
the front four Michigan State
defensive linemen: 1,040 pounds.
