## Fans, festivities make for fun in football's Sun 
### Reagan Demas Staff writer 
EL PASO, Texas â€” 38-0.
Ouch. My heart goes out to
Spartan fans everywhere dur
ing this time of grief. But
everyone should know that
this year's Sun Bowl experi
ence was much more than a
mere football game. For those
of you who did not have the
opportunity to spend a splen
did three days in lovely El
Paso, Texas, here's a quick
rundown of the brouhaha
behind the bowl.
The Fans
The Sun Bowl drew three
distinct types of fans: alumni,
students and those I affection
ately dub "oblivious locals."
The Stanford alumni made up
most of the Cardinal contin
gency and could be spotted
from halfway across the Ari
zona desert.
They sported a plethora of
Stanford Indian apparel and
could occasionally be heard
substituting a mock Native
American battle cry for a more
acceptable show of support.
The ladies flashed diamond
rings that made the Hope Dia
mond look like a granule of
zirconium dust, and the gen
tlemen found other ways to
show just how rich all Stan
ford students are going to be
when they graduate. I can't
wait.
The students in the crowd
were also quite distinctive.

They had arrived at the game
in the shuttle bus of a local
hole-in-the-wall hotel where
they had crammed 22 people
into two rooms. A majority
were still digesting a McDon
ald's extra-value meal and had
just enough spending money
to buy a stick of gum at 1942
prices. But they cheered. The
students made noise.
The same cannot be said of
the locals. They made up close
to 80 percent of the Sun Bowl
crowd, but produced only 5
percent of the noise and cheer
ing. These "oblivious locals"
couldn't have cared less about
the football game itself. In
fact, one whole end zone of the
stadium full of locals spent the
entire second half tossing a
football around and trying to
start the wave. These folks
were so out of touch with the
game, they wouldn't have
even noticed if Jesus Christ
had come again on the Sun
Bowl 50-yard line.
The Maseot
Its football team may have
reeked, but Michigan State
brought along a styling mas
cot to the Sun Bowl. The tra
ditional Spartan Mascot is
"Sparty," the muscle-ripped
foam rubber fella that, inci
dentally, bears no resem
blance to Lawrence Olivier but
is a dead ringer for Kirk Dou
glas. Maybe if Michigan State
had started Sparty at right
