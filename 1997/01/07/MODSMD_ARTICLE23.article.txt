# Stanford wins lopsided Sun Bowl
## Card's victory is biggest in bowls 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
EL PASO, Texas — The Stanford football
team wasn't given much of a chance to beat Big
Ten Conference powerhouse Michigan State in
the 1996 Sun Bowl. The Cardinal was a touch
down underdog and had lost its only other game
against a Big Ten foe to Wisconsin 14-0, a team
Michigan State had beaten 30-13.
However, riding a four-game winning streak
and executing like a top-10 team, the Cardinal
spanked the Spartans 38-0 in the most lopsided
bowl game of the season.
Both teams, which entered the game with
identical 6-5 records, got off to sluggish starts,
failing to do much of anything for the first 13
minutes of the game. Then, with just 2 minutes
left in the first quarter, the Cardinal defense
came alive and ignited the 38-point run.
With Michigan State mounting its first sub
stantial drive of the game, Spartan quarterback
Todd Schultz dropped back from the Cardinal
40-yard line on second down and 19. For a
moment, Schultz appeared to have an open
receiver downfield, but senior strong safety
Eliel Swinton re-routed the receiver just before
the ball was thrown, leaving senior free safety
Josh Madsen clear to make the interception, his
third of the year.
Madsen did not just fall on the ball though.
Instead he began scrambling downfield, start
ing one of the most exciting plays in Cardinal
football history. Madsen initially made a move
for the left sideline, but realized he was about to
run into the Spartans' explosive tailback
Sedrick Irvin. Undaunted, Madsen made an
incredible cutback across the field, leaving Irvin
in his dust and enabling him to break into the
open field.
However, Madsen was not content trying to
score the touchdown himself. With just one line
man left to beat, Madsen lateraled the ball to
senior cornerback Leroy Pruitt, who took the
ball the remaining 50 yards for the score. The
play, which was the Cardinal's second intercep
tion return for a touchdown in as many games,
turned the entire tide of the game.
"It had an effect on us because it really gave
us a shot in the arm," said Cardinal head coach
Tyrone Willingham. "And it affected our oppo
nent because you don't anticipate that the

defenses will score. And as it was, our defense
scored right out of the box and put the pressure
on them."
Madsen's teammates also appreciated the
greatness of the play.
"That sparked us and really set the fire
underneath us," said senior flanker Andre Kir
wan. "It shows you what kind of guy Josh is,
giving the ball up when he could have taken it to
the house himself."
The Cardinal never looked back after the
interception, as the Stanford offense began exe

cuting on a level unlike anything Cardinal fans
had seen all year. After the defense held Michi
gan State again, Stanford sophomore quarter
back Chad Hutchinson embarked on what
would become the most efficient passing day in
Sun Bowl history.
The Del Mar, Calif., native led the Cardinal
on three scoring drives in the second quarter,
the first of which ended in an 8-yard touchdown
pass to junior fullback John Ritchie. The drive
