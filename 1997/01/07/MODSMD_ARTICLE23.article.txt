# Stanford wins lopsided Sun Bowl
## Card's victory is biggest in bowls 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
EL PASO, Texas — The Stanford football
team wasn't given much of a chance to beat Big
Ten Conference powerhouse Michigan State in
the 1996 Sun Bowl. The Cardinal was a touch
down underdog and had lost its only other game
against a Big Ten foe to Wisconsin 14-0, a team
Michigan State had beaten 30-13.
However, riding a four-game winning streak
and executing like a top-10 team, the Cardinal
spanked the Spartans 38-0 in the most lopsided
bowl game of the season.
Both teams, which entered the game with
identical 6-5 records, got off to sluggish starts,
failing to do much of anything for the first 13
minutes of the game. Then, with just 2 minutes
left in the first quarter, the Cardinal defense
came alive and ignited the 38-point run.
With Michigan State mounting its first sub
stantial drive of the game, Spartan quarterback
Todd Schultz dropped back from the Cardinal
40-yard line on second down and 19. For a
moment, Schultz appeared to have an open
receiver downfield, but senior strong safety
Eliel Swinton re-routed the receiver just before
the ball was thrown, leaving senior free safety
Josh Madsen clear to make the interception, his
third of the year.
Madsen did not just fall on the ball though.
Instead he began scrambling downfield, start
ing one of the most exciting plays in Cardinal
football history. Madsen initially made a move
for the left sideline, but realized he was about to
run into the Spartans' explosive tailback
Sedrick Irvin. Undaunted, Madsen made an
incredible cutback across the field, leaving Irvin
in his dust and enabling him to break into the
open field.
However, Madsen was not content trying to
score the touchdown himself. With just one line
man left to beat, Madsen lateraled the ball to
senior cornerback Leroy Pruitt, who took the
ball the remaining 50 yards for the score. The
play, which was the Cardinal's second intercep
tion return for a touchdown in as many games,
turned the entire tide of the game.
"It had an effect on us because it really gave
us a shot in the arm," said Cardinal head coach
Tyrone Willingham. "And it affected our oppo
nent because you don't anticipate that the

defenses will score. And as it was, our defense
scored right out of the box and put the pressure
on them."
Madsen's teammates also appreciated the
greatness of the play.
"That sparked us and really set the fire
underneath us," said senior flanker Andre Kir
wan. "It shows you what kind of guy Josh is,
giving the ball up when he could have taken it to
the house himself."
The Cardinal never looked back after the
interception, as the Stanford offense began exe

cuting on a level unlike anything Cardinal fans
had seen all year. After the defense held Michi
gan State again, Stanford sophomore quarter
back Chad Hutchinson embarked on what
would become the most efficient passing day in
Sun Bowl history.
The Del Mar, Calif., native led the Cardinal
on three scoring drives in the second quarter,
the first of which ended in an 8-yard touchdown
pass to junior fullback John Ritchie. The drive

took just 4 minutes, as the Cardi
nal marched 76 yards in eight
plays.
Hutchinson was 2-for-2 on that
drive, including a 36-yard pass to a
diving Damon Dunn that left the
Cardinal with first and goal from
the Spartan 8-yard line. Hutchin
son, who set a Sun Bowl record for
passing efficiency and earned Sun
Bowl MVP honors, finished the
game 22-of-28 for 226 yards.
"Heck, I just sat back there and
dished the ball off because my line,
my running backs, my wide
receivers all did a great job,"
Hutchinson said. "I was just the
one heading it all."

Willingham was also quick to
praise Hutchinson for his perfor
mance. "I think it's obvious that
Chad played a fantastic ball game.
He's maturing each week; he's get
ting better each week. He has the
competitive instincts to be a fine
player for us, and the job that he
has done in the last five weeks has
been spectacular."
The second touchdown drive of
the quarter was set up by sopho
more punt returner Troy Walters,
who returned a 50-yard punt off
the leg of Paul Edinger for 24
yards. Walters, who earned the
most valuable special teams player
honors for the game, gave Stanford
great field position for the remain
ing minute of the first half.
After a 13-yard run by senior
tailback Mike Mitchell and a 25-
yard pass to senior Marlon Evans,

the Cardinal had a first-and-goal
from the one. On the ensuing play,
senior fullback Adam Salina
pounded his way to the end zone
for a routine 1-yard touchdown
run.
The run, which seemingly put
the game out of reach, held great
significance for Salina, whose
father had checked into an El Paso
hospital days earlier due to kidney
failure.
"One of the guys came up to me
after the play and apologized for
missing his block," said Salina,
who reported after the game that
his father was doing better and was
expected to be released last Thurs
day. "I was going to get in no mat
ter what. It was lor my dad."
Stanford did not let up in the
second half, as the Cardinal added
a Kevin Miller field goal, Dunn

touchdown run and blocked punt
(by Jeff Allen) return for a touch
down by sophomore Tim Smith.
With the game securely in hand,
the team's focus turned to main
taining the shutout, for Stanford
had not posted a shutout since
Nov. 16, 1974, when the Cardinal
blanked Oregon 17-0.
The shutout was only threat
ened once in the second half, when
Spartan backup quarterback Bill
Burke completed a pass to wideout
Octavius Long, who rumbled down
to the Cardinal 5-yard line.
However, determined senior
Alistair White rode him for a few
yards, trying to strip the ball.
White held onto Long and gave
junior linebacker Chris Draft
enough time to deliver a crushing
blow to Long that allowed White to
pull the ball free.
"I told the guys that we were
going to get a shutout, and I would
have followed that guy into the
stands to make sure we got it,"
Draft said.
Also having big games on
defense were junior ends Kailee
Wong, who was named most valu
able lineman, and Carl Hansen,
who was moved to defensive end
for the game. Both recorded two
sacks, while Wong added 10 tackles
and Hansen totaled eight.
"We want to be one of those uni
versities where when you look at
our defense, you look at them and
say, 'That's an explosive defense,'
and recruits say, 'I want to come to
Stanford because they're going to
play defense, and their defense is
going to score points,' " Willing
ham said.
Any way you look at it, Stanford
used the Sun Bowl to show the
country that the Cardinal can
indeed be a national power.
"I think it's part of our coming
out party nationally," Hansen said.
"We are going to have a really good
team next year, and this was a good
way to start it."

ing one of the most exciting plays in Cardinal
football history. Madsen initially made a move
for the left sideline, but realized he was about to
run into the Spartans' explosive tailback
Sedrick Irvin. Undaunted, Madsen made an
incredible cutback across the field, leaving Irvin
in his dust and enabling him to break into the
open field.
However, Madsen was not content trying to
score the touchdown himself. With just one line
man left to beat, Madsen lateraled the ball to
senior cornerback Leroy Pruitt, who took the
ball the remaining 50 yards for the score. The
play, which was the Cardinal's second intercep
tion return for a touchdown in as many games,
turned the entire tide of the game.
"It had an effect on us because it really gave
us a shot in the arm," said Cardinal head coach
Tyrone Willingham. "And it affected our oppo
nent because you don't anticipate that the

defenses will score. And as it was, our defense
scored right out of the box and put the pressure
on them."
Madsen's teammates also appreciated the
greatness of the play.
"That sparked us and really set the fire
underneath us," said senior flanker Andre Kir
wan. "It shows you what kind of guy Josh is,
giving the ball up when he could have taken it to
the house himself."
The Cardinal never looked back after the
interception, as the Stanford offense began exe

cuting on a level unlike anything Cardinal fans
had seen all year. After the defense held Michi
gan State again, Stanford sophomore quarter
back Chad Hutchinson embarked on what
would become the most efficient passing day in
Sun Bowl history.
The Del Mar, Calif., native led the Cardinal
on three scoring drives in the second quarter,
the first of which ended in an 8-yard touchdown
pass to junior fullback John Ritchie. The drive

took just 4 minutes, as the Cardi
nal marched 76 yards in eight
plays.
Hutchinson was 2-for-2 on that
drive, including a 36-yard pass to a
diving Damon Dunn that left the
Cardinal with first and goal from
the Spartan 8-yard line. Hutchin
son, who set a Sun Bowl record for
passing efficiency and earned Sun
Bowl MVP honors, finished the
game 22-of-28 for 226 yards.
"Heck, I just sat back there and
dished the ball off because my line,
my running backs, my wide
receivers all did a great job,"
Hutchinson said. "I was just the
one heading it all."

Willingham was also quick to
praise Hutchinson for his perfor
mance. "I think it's obvious that
Chad played a fantastic ball game.
He's maturing each week; he's get
ting better each week. He has the
competitive instincts to be a fine
player for us, and the job that he
has done in the last five weeks has
been spectacular."
The second touchdown drive of
the quarter was set up by sopho
more punt returner Troy Walters,
who returned a 50-yard punt off
the leg of Paul Edinger for 24
yards. Walters, who earned the
most valuable special teams player
honors for the game, gave Stanford
great field position for the remain
ing minute of the first half.
After a 13-yard run by senior
tailback Mike Mitchell and a 25-
yard pass to senior Marlon Evans,

the Cardinal had a first-and-goal
from the one. On the ensuing play,
senior fullback Adam Salina
pounded his way to the end zone
for a routine 1-yard touchdown
run.
The run, which seemingly put
the game out of reach, held great
significance for Salina, whose
father had checked into an El Paso
hospital days earlier due to kidney
failure.
"One of the guys came up to me
after the play and apologized for
missing his block," said Salina,
who reported after the game that
his father was doing better and was
expected to be released last Thurs
day. "I was going to get in no mat
ter what. It was lor my dad."
Stanford did not let up in the
second half, as the Cardinal added
a Kevin Miller field goal, Dunn

touchdown run and blocked punt
(by Jeff Allen) return for a touch
down by sophomore Tim Smith.
With the game securely in hand,
the team's focus turned to main
taining the shutout, for Stanford
had not posted a shutout since
Nov. 16, 1974, when the Cardinal
blanked Oregon 17-0.
The shutout was only threat
ened once in the second half, when
Spartan backup quarterback Bill
Burke completed a pass to wideout
Octavius Long, who rumbled down
to the Cardinal 5-yard line.
However, determined senior
Alistair White rode him for a few
yards, trying to strip the ball.
White held onto Long and gave
junior linebacker Chris Draft
enough time to deliver a crushing
blow to Long that allowed White to
pull the ball free.
"I told the guys that we were
going to get a shutout, and I would
have followed that guy into the
stands to make sure we got it,"
Draft said.
Also having big games on
defense were junior ends Kailee
Wong, who was named most valu
able lineman, and Carl Hansen,
who was moved to defensive end
for the game. Both recorded two
sacks, while Wong added 10 tackles
and Hansen totaled eight.
"We want to be one of those uni
versities where when you look at
our defense, you look at them and
say, 'That's an explosive defense,'
and recruits say, 'I want to come to
Stanford because they're going to
play defense, and their defense is
going to score points,' " Willing
ham said.
Any way you look at it, Stanford
used the Sun Bowl to show the
country that the Cardinal can
indeed be a national power.
"I think it's part of our coming
out party nationally," Hansen said.
"We are going to have a really good
team next year, and this was a good
way to start it."
