# Milwaukee Classic next for men's tennis
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
The college tennis world starts off the new year
in Wisconsin at the Milwaukee Tennis Classic today.
Stanford is sending four players to the event, includ
ing defending champion and No. 2 seed Ryan
Wolters and top-seeded Paul Goldstein.
Wolters will try to duplicate his winning effort of
a year ago but is quick to point out that it will be
more difficult this time around.
"There is some added pressure because this year
everyone will be out to beat me," the sophomore
said. "I will say that I'm playing better now than I
was at this time last year, but I was an underdog
back then. Now they're all going to be gunning for
me.
Wolters' memory is a little flawed. Although he
did enter his freshman campaign as a little-known
player, he grabbed the spotlight immediately, win
ning the All-American championship and jumping
to the No. 1 ranking in the country by the end of
October. After cruising to the Milwaukee Classic
title, Wolters had a 22-1 record and had completed
one of the most impressive college tennis starts in
history.
This week (from today through Saturday),
Wolters hopes to get 1997 off to as good a beginning
as 1996. He is coming off a tournament victory at
the America West Challenge in Houston and hopes
to continue his hot play.
"It would definitely be nice," he said. "I don't
expect to win, but I don't expect not to either. I just
want to play well."
Joining Wolters and Goldstein at the tournament
are senior Grant Elliott, who is seeded ninth, and
junior Charles Hoeveler. Wolters and Goldstein will
play together in the doubles event, as will Hoeveler
and Elliott.
Freshman Mike Bryan and junior Misha Palecek
were scheduled to play also but defaulted. Palecek
sprained his ankle over winter break, and Bryan
doesn't want to risk reinjuring his wrist.
"Mike's wrist is coming along very well," said
coach Dick Gould. "But he didn't think it would be a
good idea to play two or three matches a day on it at
this point in the season and with so much ahead."
Freshmen Geoff Abrams and Bob Bryan, who
recently won the Northern California Regional
Tournament, are sitting out this tournament
because they have already played in many events
since September.
"You can't play in everything," Gould said. "First

of all, it is against the rules. Sec
ond, it just isn't smart."
The Milwaukee Classic is not
one of the top tournaments of the
year, and Stanford players are
keeping it in perspective.
"This isn't the most important
tournament of the year or any
thing," Gould said. "Some of the
guys just want to get a few
matches in, and that is what
they're going to do."
Competing in the tournament
are 128 players, so it takes seven
straight victories to walk away
with the championship. And the
Stanford players will be matched
up against top college players
from across the country.
Harvard's Thomas Blake and
Texas' Nick Crowell are the third
and fourth seeds respectively and
each has a legitimate shot at win
ning. So does seventh-seed Gus
Fernandes, a Brazilian from LSU
who lost to Wolters in last year's
final.
