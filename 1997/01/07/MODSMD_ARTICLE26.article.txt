# Trip to Tennessee sheds light on just who is 'the Best'
## 
### 
Winter break. That holi
day-filled lapse
between fall and win
ter quarters when students
rest up for the wonderful days
of winter that lie ahead. Some
use the time to travel, and oth
ers do nothing but relax. But
the one thing everyone does is
take a break from their Stan
ford lives — everyone, that is,
except the athletes.

Road trips and tournaments
are nothing new for the ath
letes that stick around the
Farm for most of the break,
but this year I decided to get in
on the action.
I had plenty of choices. Vol
leyball was competing for the
national title in Cleveland, but
I figured Cleveland was too
cold this time of year. Football
was in the Sun Bowl in El
Paso, Texas, but Texas is a
long way from my home in
Georgia so that was out.
Finally I settled on women's
basketball; after all, that is the
sport I cover for The Daily.
Knoxville, Tenn., was just a
five-hour drive from home,
and I have a few friends at UT
so I decided u> go.
The billing for this game
was fantastic. Then-No. 1
Stanford against the defending
national champions, then
fifth-ranked Tennessee. No
Stanford women's team had
ever beaten the Lady Vols in
Knoxville, and Tennessee had
never lost consecutive games
at Thompson Boling Arena.
(The Lady Vols were coming
off an overtime loss to Geor
gia.)
The Cardinal was off to its
best start since the 1991-92
season at 9-0 and had held the
top spot in the polls for five
straight weeks. Meanwhile

Tennessee, although some
times struggling as a team, had
potentially the best player in
college basketball in the form
of sophomore Chamique Hold
sclaw.
The game lived up to its
billing.
Stanford came out on all
cylinders and knocked down 11
of its first 13 shots while Hold
sclaw scored 20 first-half
points for the Lady Vols. But
Stanford pulled away and, in
Tennessee head coach Pat
Summitt's words, "owned" the
Lady Vols all night. In fact, the
Cardinal's performance was so
good, that Summitt compared
this year's squad to the 1989-
90 team.
That Stanford team put
together a 32-1 record en route
to the Card's first national
championship and is arguably
the best Stanford team ever.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
agreed that it was a favorable
comparison but was a little
hesitant about making com
parisons.
VanDerveer did say that
this year's team runs the floor
well and has excellent perime
ter shooting like the 1989-90
squad. She also said that she
thought this year's team was
more athletic and a better
rebounding team but makes
more mistakes than the team
from the 1989-90 season.
The mistakes have been dis
played in numerous turnovers
that the Cardinal has put up
this season. In Stanford's nnly
loss, a 83-66 defeat at the
hands of Old Dominion, the
Card coughed up more
turnovers in a single game (28)
than any Stanford team since
January 1992 (30 against
Washington State) only to top
that with 29 in a win over Ari
zona State Thursday.
But none of that was evi
dent against the Lady Vols.
Senior point guard Jamila
Wideman racked up a 9-1
assist-to-turnover ratio and
guided her team to its biggest
win of the season.
Is the 1996-97 Stanford


Robin
Davidson
women's basketball team the
best ever? If it plays the way it
did in Knoxville I don't see how
anyone could argue against it,
but with one loss already to its
credits the team may need to fin
ish out the season without a loss
to even be considered an equal to
the 1989-90 squad.
Most Cardinal fans consider
the 1989-90 team to be Stan
ford's best ever and the record
books tend to back that theory.
That squad consisted of such
great players as Jennifer Azzi,
Val Whiting, Sonja Henning,
Trisha Stevens and Katy Sted
ing.
Together this group makes up
the bulk of Stanford's individual
and team records. As a team the
1989-90 squad has the longest
opening win streak in the
school's history at 20. It also
managed to score more points
and win by a higher margin of
victory than any other Cardinal

team. In addition it holds the
record for best field goal and
free throw percentages in a sea
son.
Individually, three of the top
five scorers in Stanford's history
were from that team, including
Whiting, who is tops with 2,077.
Azzi holds most of the records in
three-point shooting, including
field goals made in a career and
field goal percentage for a career,
season and game, not to mention
the fact that she and Henning
are the top two in career steals
and assists.
But this year's squad is clos
ing in on most of those records.
In the Tennessee game Starbird
eclipsed Azzi in all-time scoring
and now is the third-leading
scorer in Stanford history. Star
bird also holds scoring records
for a single season and game in
addition to being among the
leaders in steals and assists
along with Wideman. Meanwhile
junior forward Vanessa Nygaard
is on a pace to take over the top
spot in three-point field goals
made.
If Stanford takes its cam

paign in 1997 to the national
championship it could do so with
only one loss. That would
require going undefeated in the
Pacific 10 Conference for the
second straight year and only
the third time in school history.
(The 1989-90 team did not go
undefeated in the conference
with its only loss of the season
coming to Washington 81-78.) If
the squad were to manage such
a feat it would give the Cardinal
a 36-1 record, a third consecu
tive conference title and a
school-record 27-game winning
streak.
So is this the best team Stan
ford has ever had? It could be.
But the road between here and
March is a long one, and the Car
dinal will have to eliminate mis
takes and play at the top of its
game for the next three months.
If it does that, this squad may go
down as Stanford's best ever.
The Final Four ... Cincinnati
. . . sounds good to me.

All the stuff in the lounge is evi
dence that broadcasters don't get
much of a break either.

ford's best ever and the record
books tend to back that theory.
That squad consisted of such
great players as Jennifer Azzi,
Val Whiting, Sonja Henning,
Trisha Stevens and Katy Sted
ing.
Together this group makes up
the bulk of Stanford's individual
and team records. As a team the
1989-90 squad has the longest
opening win streak in the
school's history at 20. It also
managed to score more points
and win by a higher margin of
victory than any other Cardinal

team. In addition it holds the
record for best field goal and
free throw percentages in a sea
son.
Individually, three of the top
five scorers in Stanford's history
were from that team, including
Whiting, who is tops with 2,077.
Azzi holds most of the records in
three-point shooting, including
field goals made in a career and
field goal percentage for a career,
season and game, not to mention
the fact that she and Henning
are the top two in career steals
and assists.
But this year's squad is clos
ing in on most of those records.
In the Tennessee game Starbird
eclipsed Azzi in all-time scoring
and now is the third-leading
scorer in Stanford history. Star
bird also holds scoring records
for a single season and game in
addition to being among the
leaders in steals and assists
along with Wideman. Meanwhile
junior forward Vanessa Nygaard
is on a pace to take over the top
spot in three-point field goals
made.
If Stanford takes its cam

paign in 1997 to the national
championship it could do so with
only one loss. That would
require going undefeated in the
Pacific 10 Conference for the
second straight year and only
the third time in school history.
(The 1989-90 team did not go
undefeated in the conference
with its only loss of the season
coming to Washington 81-78.) If
the squad were to manage such
a feat it would give the Cardinal
a 36-1 record, a third consecu
tive conference title and a
school-record 27-game winning
streak.
So is this the best team Stan
ford has ever had? It could be.
But the road between here and
March is a long one, and the Car
dinal will have to eliminate mis
takes and play at the top of its
game for the next three months.
If it does that, this squad may go
down as Stanford's best ever.
The Final Four ... Cincinnati
. . . sounds good to me.

All the stuff in the lounge is evi
dence that broadcasters don't get
much of a break either.
