# Trip to Tennessee sheds light on just who is 'the Best'
## 
### 
Winter break. That holi
day-filled lapse
between fall and win
ter quarters when students
rest up for the wonderful days
of winter that lie ahead. Some
use the time to travel, and oth
ers do nothing but relax. But
the one thing everyone does is
take a break from their Stan
ford lives â€” everyone, that is,
except the athletes.

Road trips and tournaments
are nothing new for the ath
letes that stick around the
Farm for most of the break,
but this year I decided to get in
on the action.
I had plenty of choices. Vol
leyball was competing for the
national title in Cleveland, but
I figured Cleveland was too
cold this time of year. Football
was in the Sun Bowl in El
Paso, Texas, but Texas is a
long way from my home in
Georgia so that was out.
Finally I settled on women's
basketball; after all, that is the
sport I cover for The Daily.
Knoxville, Tenn., was just a
five-hour drive from home,
and I have a few friends at UT
so I decided u> go.
The billing for this game
was fantastic. Then-No. 1
Stanford against the defending
national champions, then
fifth-ranked Tennessee. No
Stanford women's team had
ever beaten the Lady Vols in
Knoxville, and Tennessee had
never lost consecutive games
at Thompson Boling Arena.
(The Lady Vols were coming
off an overtime loss to Geor
gia.)
The Cardinal was off to its
best start since the 1991-92
season at 9-0 and had held the
top spot in the polls for five
straight weeks. Meanwhile

Tennessee, although some
times struggling as a team, had
potentially the best player in
college basketball in the form
of sophomore Chamique Hold
sclaw.
The game lived up to its
billing.
Stanford came out on all
cylinders and knocked down 11
of its first 13 shots while Hold
sclaw scored 20 first-half
points for the Lady Vols. But
Stanford pulled away and, in
Tennessee head coach Pat
Summitt's words, "owned" the
Lady Vols all night. In fact, the
Cardinal's performance was so
good, that Summitt compared
this year's squad to the 1989-
90 team.
That Stanford team put
together a 32-1 record en route
to the Card's first national
championship and is arguably
the best Stanford team ever.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer
agreed that it was a favorable
comparison but was a little
hesitant about making com
parisons.
VanDerveer did say that
this year's team runs the floor
well and has excellent perime
ter shooting like the 1989-90
squad. She also said that she
thought this year's team was
more athletic and a better
rebounding team but makes
more mistakes than the team
from the 1989-90 season.
The mistakes have been dis
played in numerous turnovers
that the Cardinal has put up
this season. In Stanford's nnly
loss, a 83-66 defeat at the
hands of Old Dominion, the
Card coughed up more
turnovers in a single game (28)
than any Stanford team since
January 1992 (30 against
Washington State) only to top
that with 29 in a win over Ari
zona State Thursday.
But none of that was evi
dent against the Lady Vols.
Senior point guard Jamila
Wideman racked up a 9-1
assist-to-turnover ratio and
guided her team to its biggest
win of the season.
Is the 1996-97 Stanford
