# 'Electronic courthouse'
## Law School develops Web site to give public easy access to information about fraud cases 
### Jennifer Wang Contributing writer 
The Stanford Law School has begun
creating the "electronic courthouse" of the
future, constructing a World Wide Web site
called the Securities Fraud Class Action
Litigation Clearinghouse.
The site provides information concern
ing fraud cases for the public to view. The
first of its kind, it gives broad access to
legal documents that would otherwise be
unavailable to the average investor.
Securities fraud involves companies
who make material misrepresentations. In
the past, without an electronic database of
files to research, the amount of time and
the cost of looking over every district
court's records made it difficult for in
vestors to find the information they need
ed.
The Law School hopes the new Internet
resource, supported by the Northern Cali
fornia's Federal District Court and the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commis
sion, will lead to a nationwide, centralized
source of information for the public. The
court has released a draft of a proposed

rule requiring all class action litigants to
send electronic copies of major court filings
to an approved Internet site.
Web sites must meet certain guidelines
in order to be listed on the SEC home page
as a designated securities fraud clearing
house. The SEC will update its list as new
sites are established and old sites go down.
The conditions for approved sites in
clude making the site accessible to all
members of the public at no charge, placing
no restrictions on a person's ability to copy
or download materials free of charge, and
trying to post electronic copies of docu
ments sent by litigants within two busi
ness days.
According to Michael Perino, assistant
director of the Law / Business Program at
the Law School, the traditional problem is
the expense of getting information to
members of a class-action suit. The clear
inghouse now allows plaintiffs to find out
litigation developments by simply looking
on the Web site.
Perino said the Stanford site "will try to
be the universe" by downloading informa-
tion from other sites if they are
created to keep its content com
prehensive. In this way, the public
can have the convenience of only
researching one site.
Paul Lomio, librarian at the
Crown Law School Library, has
worked hard along with over a
dozen of library and Law School
staff volunteers to maintain the
information on the Web site.
"It's really been a spirited

group here," Lomio said. "There
has been a lot of enthusiasm. Peo
ple are really giving for this pro
ject." Participants in the project
must do work ranging from re
search and proofreading to HTML
programming.
Law Prof. Joseph Grundfest,
one of the professors spearhead
ing the effort, said if other courts
follow California's lead, then all
participants in securities fraud lit
igation will have the benefit of
open information available on a
given subject.
Beside the obvious benefits the
Web site has for investors think

ing of buying stock in a certain
company, Grundfest said the site
can be helpful to many others.
It will help "the SEC monitor
litigation developments, Congress
evaluate the need for further
amendments to the federal securi
ties laws, judges learn about rele
vant developments in cases pend
ing in other courts and the media
develop more timely and informed
stories about securities litigation
cases," he said.
