# 'Electronic courthouse'
## Law School develops Web site to give public easy access to information about fraud cases

The Stanford Law School has begun
creating the "electronic courthouse" of the
future, constructing a World Wide Web site

first of its kind, it gives broad access to
legal documents that would otherwise be

sites are established and old sites go down.

members of the public at no charge, placing
no restrictions on a person's ability to copy
or download materials free of charge, and
trying to post electronic copies of docu

According to Michael Perino, assistant
director of the Law / Business Program at
the Law School, the traditional problem is
the expense of getting information to
members of a class-action suit. The clear

litigation developments by simply looking
