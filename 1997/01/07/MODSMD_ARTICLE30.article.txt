# Exceptional staff honored

A Chemistry Library librarian and a Neurobiology
Department engineering technician are the recipients
of this year's Marshall D. O'Neill Award for exceptional
staff contributions to research at Stanford.
The award, sponsored by the Dean of Research Of
fice, provides Stanford faculty members an opportunity
to recognize staff support for all areas of research and
scholarship. All leveli of staff are eligible for the award,
but nominations are made only by faculty.
Grace Baysinger, the head librarian and bibliograph
er for the Swain Library of Chemistry and Chemical En
gineering, has been at Stanford since 1989. She was rec
ognized for working to acquire resources which facili
tate research — particularly computerized resources —
and for keeping students and faculty abreast of ad
vances in information technology. To do this, she con
ducts training sessions for faculty members, teaching
assistants and students on the latest software and on
line searches.
"I try to create a whole environment which can fos
ter efficient and effective use of information,"
Baysinger said. She said she also strives to reduce the
risk of students "drowning in data."
Baysinger conducts research seminars for students
in Chemistry 131 and 132 every fall: Students are given
an unknown compound, then use the library's chemical
and electronic handbooks to ascertain what material
they have.
Asst. Dean of Research Ann George credits
Baysinger with helping students and faculty take ad
vantage of the latest resources in chemistry. Baysinger
"has gone above and beyond to service research activi
ty," George said.
Asst. Chemistry Prof. Tom Wandless said, "Her ac
tivity in the library impacts both our research and our

teaching ability because | Baysinger] and her staff are
so energetic." Baysinger has helped allow Chemistry
Department professors and their students to do so
phisticated searches usingcutting-edge technology, he
said.
Baysinger said when she first found out she won the
award she felt surprised and honored. "The faculty and
students and just great," she said.
Robert Schneeveis, a science and engineering techni
cian in the Neurobiology Department, was also sur
prised by his nomination and pleased "to be appreciated
by the people I enjoy doing work for."
Schneeveis first came to Stanford in 1983 to work
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. He had a
strong interest in biology but little training. When a
job in the School of Medicine's Neurobiology Depart
ment became available, he jumped at the opportunity.
Schneeveis designs and constructs the tools which
enable researchers in the Neurobiology Department to
conduct complex experiments.
In the past, he has designed instruments to deliver
stimuli to an animal from any location around the head
while electrical recordings are made from microelec
trodes in the brain. He also developed tools for analyz
ing the function of nerve cells in the retina as they re
spond to light.
"The result — awards for these two very deserving
individuals — speaks well for the breadth and depth of
research at Stanford," Dean of Research Charles
Kruger said.
The O'Neill award began seven years ago when a
group of Stanford faculty wanted to find a way to ac
knowledge staff members' outstandingcontributions to
Stanford's research mission. In 1990, Marshall O'Neill
was cited as a prime example of such service.
O'Neill, who has managed more than 700 research
projects, retired as director of the W.W. Hansen Labs in
1990.
