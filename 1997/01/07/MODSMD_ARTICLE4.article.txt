# Student e-mail fees may be unavoidable

### Marni Leff Staff writer 
Universities are quickly reaching the point
when they will no longer be able to pick up the
tab for student use of the Internet, according
to computer specialists at schools around the
country.
At a Faculty Senate meeting last month,
Stanford Chief Information Officer Glen
Mueller said that although students will not
be charged for Internet access within the next
year, no guarantees can be made about the fu
ture.
Stanford students already pay $45 to reg
ister an in-room Ethernet connection for the
school year, although undergraduates at

Harvard University, Yale University, Duke
University, Northwestern University and
UC-Berkeley are not charged. Only two years
ago, Stanford's fee for an in-room connection
was $10.
At Yale, while undergraduate students
have free and unlimited access to the Inter
net, some graduate students pay as much as
$ 109 ayear, depending on how much their de
partment contributes.
One administrator from Harvard ex
plained that just as students cannot make un
limited long-distance phone calls, a similar
time-limited charge may need to be imple
mented for Internet use. Universities around
the country currently pay the
tremendous costs for student access
to the Internet, according to Frank
Steen, director of the division of
Computer Services that manages
undergraduate accounts at Harvard.
"At Harvard, Internet use is
funded by centrally provided
money," Steen said. "No extra
charge appears on students' tuition
bills. The cost of using the Internet
for universities is sky-rocketing. No
one has any reason to believe that In
ternet costs will not continue to in
crease."
Steen said at some point Internet
users at universities — including
students — are going to need to help
pay the bills.
"At Harvard, we have not yet dis
cussed charging the students,"
Steen said. "Stanford may just be a

year or so ahead of other universi
ties, as far as charging goes."
Although no steps are currently
being taken toward charging stu
dents, faculty or staff for use of the
Internet, Tom Broad, director of
Technology Support Services at
Northwestern, sees it as a definite
possibility for the future.
"There is nothing wrong with
charging students to use the Inter
net, and we can all look forward to a
time when every campus charges,"
Broad said. "I think that this is a
problem every major research uni
versity will have to face within the
next year."
Though no one was able to pin
down a potential charge for Internet
use, compared to the amount uni
versities already charge for tuition, it
is unlikely the charge for Internet
use will prove significant, said James
Dronesfield, associate chief informa
tion officer for the Office of Informa
tion Technology at Duke.
"Eventually, it boils down to

users paying for use," he said. "Duke
is a ways from that now, but it may
be different at other institutions."
Administrators at the five univer
sities believe the time will come
when strategies will need to be im
plemented to recover costs of the In
ternet.
"No one has ever acknowledged
exactly what the Internet costs,"
said Jacqueline Craig of the Infor
mation Systems and Technology De
partment at UC-Berkeley. "Funding
for technology has never caught up,
and at some point it has to."
Paying so much already for tu
ition, many students feel that free
access to the Internet is a perk they
should continue to be able to enjoy.
"I don't even know who to get
mad at," said sophomore Cheryl
Tang. "There are people who use the
Internet to play stupid games, but
there are also people who rely on it to
do research, and I don't think it's
possible to distinguish between
them."
