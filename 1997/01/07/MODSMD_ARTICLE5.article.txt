Most students spend their winter
breaks relaxing and unwinding from the
built-up concerns of a quarter. ASSU Vice
President Nick Thompson, on the other
hand, spent his vacation continuing his
campaign to end the U.S. News & World
Report annual college rankings.
Thompson led a group of five students
who represented the 100-member, nation
wide coalition of student governments op
posed to the rankings in a Dec. 18 meeting
with magazine Editor in Chief James Fal
lows and the editors responsible for the

"America's Best Colleges"
issue.
Thompson was joined at
the magazine's Washing
ton headquarters by stu
dents from Rice Universi
ty, Yale University and Ok
lahoma Baptist University.
"We presented our case
and explained the reasons
why we are frustrated with

U.S. News," Thompson said. "They lis
tened to us, offered us potato chips, ignored
our opinions and let us go."
