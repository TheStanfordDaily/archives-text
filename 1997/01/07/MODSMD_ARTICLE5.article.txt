# U.S. News editors wary of eliminating rankings
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Most students spend their winter
breaks relaxing and unwinding from the
built-up concerns of a quarter. ASSU Vice
President Nick Thompson, on the other
hand, spent his vacation continuing his
campaign to end the U.S. News & World
Report annual college rankings.
Thompson led a group of five students
who represented the 100-member, nation
wide coalition of student governments op
posed to the rankings in a Dec. 18 meeting
with magazine Editor in Chief James Fal
lows and the editors responsible for the

"America's Best Colleges"
issue.
Thompson was joined at
the magazine's Washing
ton headquarters by stu
dents from Rice Universi
ty, Yale University and Ok
lahoma Baptist University.
"We presented our case
and explained the reasons
why we are frustrated with

U.S. News," Thompson said. "They lis
tened to us, offered us potato chips, ignored
our opinions and let us go."

After outlining their opposi
tion to the rankings, the coalition
representatives presented a pro
posal to the U.S. News editors.
The magazine, the coalition rep
resentatives suggested, should
end the composite rankings. In
stead, schools should be listed al
phabetically and ranked by cate
gory.
Under the proposed changes,
an entry for Stanford, Thompson
offered, might list it first in acade
mic reputation and 26th in alumni
giving but provide no overall
score.
According to Thompson, how
ever, the U.S. News representa
tives were not swayed.
"The whole editorial board —
with the exception of [newly ap
pointed editor] James Fallows —
has their personal identities really
caught up in these rankings, and I
feel they only wanted to meet with
usasa show," Thompson said. He
classified the meeting as generally
unproductive and ruled out the
possibility of another meeting.
"They think the rankings are

as perfect as possible," Thompson
said.
The undaunted vice president,
however, vows to continue his
fight.
"We are now going to keep
pressing schools to stop sending in
their data," he said. "U.S. News
can make up the data, but they are
going to lose a lot of their credibil
ity if they have to put a little foot
note next to each school."
Currently U.S. News approxi
mates data for the five schools
that do not voluntarily provide
statistics such as yield rates,
alumni donations and average
standardized test scores.
Thompson hopes to build a coali
tion of university administrators
and may approach the American As
sociation of University Professors.
Thus far the student govern
ments of more than 20 coalition
schools and two state university
systems — California and Okla
homa — have passed resolutions
denouncing the rankings and urg
ing university administrations to
stop submitting rankings.
"It's going to be a long-term
campaign," Thompson said. "But
once enough schools stop sending in
data, they're just going to have to
give up."
