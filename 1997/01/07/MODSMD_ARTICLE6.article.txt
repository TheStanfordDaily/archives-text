# Group sets up Bookstore alternative
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Students have long complained
about the high new-book prices and low
book buy-back rates at the Bookstore.
Yesterday, a group initiated an ef
fort to provide an alternative by coordi
nating the sale of used textbooks be
tween student sellers and potential
buyers.
About 200 students stopped at the
table outside the Bookstore yesterday
to join the used book list, according to
junior Hussein Kanji, who helped run
the event for the group Stop Monopo

Kanji said he realizes there are prob

such as Psychology 1, change texts al
most every quarter. But Kanji said stu
dents didn't mind these inconve

this — it is the same as what is already
being done in dorms, just on a larger
scale."
Sophomore Steve Kleha said he was
excited to have an opportunity to buy
used books directly from students. "I
often spend $300 to $400 a quarter on
books at the Bookstore," he said. "Last
quarter I didn't buy all of my books. It

Some students were able to find buy
ers immediately for their used books as
they were signing up on the lists.
Sophomore Adelaida Huerta bought an
Economics 1 textbook from another
student at the table. She said although
