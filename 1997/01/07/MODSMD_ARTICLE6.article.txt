# Group sets up Bookstore alternative
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
Students have long complained
about the high new-book prices and low
book buy-back rates at the Bookstore.
Yesterday, a group initiated an ef
fort to provide an alternative by coordi
nating the sale of used textbooks be
tween student sellers and potential
buyers.
About 200 students stopped at the
table outside the Bookstore yesterday
to join the used book list, according to
junior Hussein Kanji, who helped run
the event for the group Stop Monopo
lies on Campus. Students wrote down
their names, e-mail addresses and the
books they wanted to buy or sell. Everv

night, the list of available books, orga
nized by department, will be updated
and sent out to the students who have
signed up.
The first e-mail compilation of books
for sale went out last night — more
than 300 books are available.
Junior Danny Bramzon, founder of
the organization, said he did not actu
ally want to buy and sell books, saying
there was too much risk involved. In
stead, compiling lists of interested stu
dents eases the process of students
making connections.
Kanji said he realizes there are prob
lems with the system. Some classes,
such as Psychology 1, change texts al
most every quarter. But Kanji said stu
dents didn't mind these inconve

niences: "People are already used to
this — it is the same as what is already
being done in dorms, just on a larger
scale."
Sophomore Steve Kleha said he was
excited to have an opportunity to buy
used books directly from students. "I
often spend $300 to $400 a quarter on
books at the Bookstore," he said. "Last
quarter I didn't buy all of my books. It
cost too much."
Some students were able to find buy
ers immediately for their used books as
they were signing up on the lists.
Sophomore Adelaida Huerta bought an
Economics 1 textbook from another
student at the table. She said although
she always buys all of her books,
friends of hers had turned to
checking out their textbooks
from the library to avoid the cost.
Members of the organization
plan to be in White Plaza for at
least the rest of the week. Bram
zon said he is eager to join forces
with the ASSU. "We are hoping
they will support us at least with
manpower and eventually with a
senate resolution," he said.
ASSU President Bill Shen said
he is in full support of the organi
zation. "It is a project we are en
thusiastic about and would love
to participate in," said Shen. "We
are proud to be part of anything
that encourages competition on
campus."
Bookstore Director of Opera
tions Ken Shark said the Book
store is compelled to sell every
textbook a professor is using in
class. Because of the difficulty of
securing all texts, prices in ship
ping can raise the price of the
book.
"We do our best to provide a
good service and at a fair price,"
said Shark. He added that Bram
zon had not approached him to
discuss Bookstore pricing.
Bramzon said before he initi
ates discussions with Bookstore
officials, he wants to prove the
popularity of an alternative used
book organization. A larger, well
established organization would
provide better leverage for lower
prices, he said.
