Chikage Miyaji used to be afraid of blood. She
fainted when she saw it.
But not anymore. Now, Miyaji spends most of
her time at the hospital — sometimes in the
surgery unit, sometimes in the emergency room.
She is neither a doctor nor a nurse. She is a
Japanese medical interpreter at Stanford Med
ical Center.
Miyaji s job is to help bridge the language gap
between patients and doctors and sometimes
among doctors and visiting scholars. She has in
terpreted for a woman who was undergoing a Ce
sarean section, a man who came to the United
States to have a kidney transplant and a patient
with psychiatric problems.
It is 25-vear-old Miyaji's job to interpret for
anybody, anytime. The hospital contacts her no
matter what time it is, and she has to rush to the
hospital even if it is 2 a.m.
"No mistake is forgiven," Miyaji said Medical
interpreters "are fighting with seconds. People
won't wait for you. Especially in the medical
sense, our tiny mistake can put people's lives in
danger."
However, not many people know about the ex
istence of the Interpreter Services Office at the
Medical Center, which was established 25 years
ago. According to Linda Haffner, the director and
Spanish interpreter of the office, there was only
one interpreter at that time, a Spanish-speaker,
Olga Guerra.
Now, the ofTice provides interpretation and
translation in 27 different languages, ranging
from Spanish to Russian to sign languages.
Haffner said there are 14 regular interpreters
and a language bank that includes community
