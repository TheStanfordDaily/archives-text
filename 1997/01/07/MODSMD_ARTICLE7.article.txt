Chikage Miyaji used to be afraid of blood. She
fainted when she saw it.
But not anymore. Now, Miyaji spends most of
her time at the hospital — sometimes in the
surgery unit, sometimes in the emergency room.
She is neither a doctor nor a nurse. She is a
Japanese medical interpreter at Stanford Med
ical Center.
Miyaji s job is to help bridge the language gap
between patients and doctors and sometimes
among doctors and visiting scholars. She has in
terpreted for a woman who was undergoing a Ce
sarean section, a man who came to the United
States to have a kidney transplant and a patient
with psychiatric problems.
It is 25-vear-old Miyaji's job to interpret for
anybody, anytime. The hospital contacts her no
matter what time it is, and she has to rush to the
hospital even if it is 2 a.m.
"No mistake is forgiven," Miyaji said Medical
interpreters "are fighting with seconds. People
won't wait for you. Especially in the medical
sense, our tiny mistake can put people's lives in
danger."
However, not many people know about the ex
istence of the Interpreter Services Office at the
Medical Center, which was established 25 years
ago. According to Linda Haffner, the director and
Spanish interpreter of the office, there was only
one interpreter at that time, a Spanish-speaker,
Olga Guerra.
Now, the ofTice provides interpretation and
translation in 27 different languages, ranging
from Spanish to Russian to sign languages.
Haffner said there are 14 regular interpreters
and a language bank that includes community

feel more comfortable.
residents, Stanford students and
employees and interpreter in
terns.
According to Haffner, Spanish
is the language in most demand at
the hospital, followed by Russian
and Mandarin. "There has been a
significant increase in Russian im
migrants," she said.
In 1991, the office started pro
viding Spanish interpreter services
24 hours a day and seven days a
week. In addition to the service, it
also provides the AT&T Language
Line for emergency use. Interpre
tation by telephone expands the ca
pability of the office to nearly 140
different languages.
Reflecting the ethnically diverse
communities of California, people
who don't speak English often seek
care at the hospital, said Haffner,
who was raised in Nicaragua.
According to Haffner, 22 per
cent of patients in the emergency
room and 32 percent in maternity
are non-English speakers. Most
of these patients are Spanish
speaking. The office helps about
3,000 such patients every two
months.
"We are a very busy group," said
Haffner, who carries three pagers.
Miyaji said it was common that peo

pie stop her and ask for interpreta
tion whenever she is around the
hospital.
Eri Komiya, one of the patients
Miyaji helped, found out that she
was pregnant last August after ar
riving in the United States from
Japan.
Komiya, 27, the wife of a Stan
ford MBA student, was under
standably excited. But at the same
time, she was anxious about going
to the hospital alone because she
couldn't speak English very well.
"My husband could translate for
me. But we were both worried, es
pecially for this urgent occasion,
because he didn't know medical
terms," Komiya said.
However, when she went to
make an appointment at the Med
ical Center, her anxiety melted
away. She was offered a Japanese
interpreter.
"I couldn't even imagine that
there were medical interpreter ser
vices at the hospital. I have never
heard of such a convenient thing,
and I feel much more secure now,"
said Komiya, whose baby is due in
March.
Haffner said in her opinion fam
ily members often are the worst in
terpreters "because they tend to
protect bad news from the patient.
They often omit a lot of what doc
tors say. But patients have the
right to know."
According to Haffner, the office's

goal is to reach as many patients as
it can. "But we still don't have
enough interpreters," she said.
Compared to other hospitals, Stan
ford's interpreter services office is
considered small. "Even though
needs are similar, we have a limited
budget," HafTner said.
"Not many people understand
the difficulties of being medical in
terpreters," HafTner added. "Peo
ple think that if you are bilingual,
you can be a interpreter. In fact, not
everybody can interpret."
Haffner explained that medical
interpreters need special skills.
Good interpretation requires a
knowledge of both the language
and the culture.
"A word can mean a successful
treatment or unsuccessful treat
ment," HafTner said, noting that
language and cultural barriers can
result in noncompliance with pre
scribed therapies and lack of in
formed consent.
Miyaji has experienced the diffi
culty of cultural differences. A
Japanese man's family became of
fended when she interpreted and
informed them how bad his kidney
was.
"In Japan, if it's a bad news, we
don't tell the patient but the family.
But here in the United States, it is
my job to directly inform the pa
tient," Miyaji said. "Some patients'
family have even asked me to delib
erately use Latin medical terminol

ogy of 'cancer,' so that the patient
will not get upset."
Cultural and religious belief can
cause danger, too. For example,
some patients rely on home reme
dies that can have a negative effect
when combined with prescription
medicines.
According to Haffner, most of
the medical interpreters at Stan
ford have either a science or med
ical background. Some are former
doctors and nurses, while others
have master's degrees in interpre
tation and translation, a degree
only offered in the United States at
the Monterey Institute of Interna
tional Studies.
According to Dr. Edward Klofas,
who works in the emergency room,
interpreter services are essential
"Medical diagnosis is 85 percent
of patients' medicine history, 10
percent of physical exam and 5 per
cent of ancillary testing. Without
interpreters, we have no idea what
the patients' medical history is," he
said.
Haffner thinks the School of
Medicine should offer a course of
how to work with interpreters,
which would help make the job
"more efficient and less time con
suming for doctors."
Miyaji, who graduated from t&e
Monterey Institute, now wants fco
go to medical school. She wants to
be a psychiatrist — and perhaps
she won't see as much blood.
