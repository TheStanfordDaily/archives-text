STANFORD SAFE TRANSPORTATION
PROGRAM
725 - ST r P
Have you ever driven to a bar or parly
and been stuck late at night fearful of
driving home safely? Well don't feel
foolish. It happens to the best of us.
Let us help you out. Call 725-
S.T.O.P. (Stanford Safe
Transportation Program) and a fellow
student will pick you up and give you
a ride home. It's our pleasure. We
are concerned for all of us who drink
and try to drive. 5.T.0.P., pick up
the phone near you and get a free,
safe ride home!
S.T.O.P. is a non-profit volunteer
service created to drive while you
drink on Thursday thru Saturday
nights from 10 pm to 2 am. For more
information or to volunteer to drive,
call Chike @ 497-4917. Save us
from boredom on our Thursday thru
Saturday nights by giving us a ring,
and we can help save you.
