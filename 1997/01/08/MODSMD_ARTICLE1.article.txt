## In-line skaters find new activity in nocturnal jaunt through campus 
### Stephanie Green 
They roll past the dormitories and around
the Stanford campus at maximum speed in the
pitch of night — a massive human chain of re
flector lights, black Spandex and kneepads.
In a clattering roar of hundreds of wheels on
pavement, this throng of skaters zips past so
fast that many people are left wondering who
they are.
They are 50 to 200 in-line skaters, depend
ing on the season, rolling on an 8-mile, two
hour nighttime voyage in and around Stan
ford. They are Wednesday Night Social Skate.
This mob of skaters is still a mystery to most
students, and in fact, there's hardly a single
Stanford student among them. They're no
strangers to the Stanford Police, however, who
reportedly have been known to follow behind
the night riders in a patrol car with a video cam
era.
Indicative of the ever-increasing popularity
of in-line skating, or blading, the Wednesday
skate is merely part of the Bay Area's fast grow
ing nocturnal skating scene.
"It's an addictive sport," said Robert Labon
ty, 28, of his roller-journey with this group of
skaters ranging from their early 20s to their
40s.
On a recent cold evening, the chill has kept
some bladers at home, with about 55 die-hards
speeding along the streets, but on a warm sum
mer night there may be upward of 200 bladers
at Stanford. With arms pumping and backs
bent, the skaters dig in to climb the hills of
Stanford residential areas, speeding down the
descent in a not-quite-perfect line.
Most are regulars, attending not only the
Stanford skate but other nightly Bay Area so
cial skates. The hills don't faze them — not a
drop of perspiration beads their faces.
The trip around Stanford is great exercise,
but for many it's also a social outlet.
"I didn't know anybody, and now I know
everybody," said Labonty, who's only been
skating for 2 1/2 months. A quick learner,
Labonty heard about the social skate from a
friend and already skates at the front of the
line, darting ahead with the fastest-speed
skaters the minute the group takes off.
Word of mouth has been the sole force pro
pelling the Stanford skate forward, from a few
friends seven years ago to the huge group it is
today.
Greg Feldstein, 27, a co-owner of the Nuvo

Colours skate stores, said he has never adver
tised the Wednesday skate and that people find
out about it either from friends or by coming
into the store. Nuvo, which has five locations
throughout the Bay Area, sponsors the Stan
ford skate and other nighttime social skates in
San Francisco, Los Gatos and Walnut Creek.
The popularity of the Stanford skate is part
of the increasing momentum that outdoor
roller skating has taken on since in-line skates
hit the market.
Nearly 22 million people were blading by
1994, according to the National Sporting
Goods Association, and that number is expect
ed to increase anywhere from 30 percent to 50
percent in coming years. The California Out
door Roller skating Association reports that
there are between 5,000 and 10,000 skaters in
Golden Gate Park every Sunday.
The growing number of Stanford skaters,
while currently unrestricted on where and how
to skate, may be in for some new regulations.
Skateboarding is already illegal on most of
the campus, and some people have complained
that in-line skating should be regulated as well.

Arguing that skaters and skateboarders alike
damage property and create excessive noise
near libraries and other building on campus, a
group of Stanford scholars and faculty recently
wrote a letter to the Palo Alto Daily News
protesting a front page photo of a young boy
skating on the steps of Meyer Library.
"The main thing is the noise factor," said
visiting scholar Elaine Windrich. She ex
plained that when skaters roll over the grates
near the library the sound can be heard loudly
inside, disturbing people trying to work. She
said she has no problem with skating if the
noise level can be minimized.
"It would be like practicing the band in the
library — there are more appropriate places,"
said Michael Ballard, a Green Library librari
an. Echoing Windrich's views, he said, "I just
think that people who want quiet should have
it, and people who want to Rollerblade should
be able to do that."
Members of the Wednesday night skate
were quick to comment on the recent attempts


Johnny Zannis — Daily
by police to monitor their activities.
"It feels like there's an under
current," said Roy Martinez, 34,
who's been skating with the group
for two years. "They place in-line
skating in the same category as
skateboarding.... They just don't
understand how many people use
it as a legitimate exercise medi
um.
Martinez alleged that not only
had the police trailed them with a
video camera but that one evening
the group was detained for about 20
minutes while officers questioned
them.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin
Moore said the department relies
on videotapes to collect data on the
use of Stanford facilities by outside
groups. The Wednesday night
skaters clearly fall within this cate
gory, he said, and he has received

enough complaints to make blading
an issue.
It is not as pressing as the skate
boarding ban was, he said.
"Rollerblading is a bit different
than skateboarding," Moore said.
"Legitimately, people use it as a
form of transportation and exer
cise. We want to take that kind of
stuff into consideration."
He said that a likely outcome
would be restrictions on certain
noisy and dangerous skate activi
ties, such as sliding down railings
and jumping off steps and skating
in academic areas.
Because the nighttime skaters
typically skate in residential areas
around Stanford, these rules
would affect them only minimally,
although younger kids who skate
near the libraries and post office
would suffer. The captain stressed
that a skating ban at Stanford is
not on the "front burner."
