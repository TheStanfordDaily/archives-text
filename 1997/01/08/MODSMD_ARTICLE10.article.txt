# Raging waters continue to flood West
## Damages surpass $1.5 billion amid new evacuations and swamped casinos 
### 
MANTECA, Calif. (AP) - Rag
ing rivers burst through levees in
California's soggy Central Valley
yesterday, flooding more homes
and farms and forcing new evacua
tions as the damage total rose
beyond $1.5 billion. Crews laid
sheets of plastic and stacked sand
bags against the rising tide.
At Lake Tahoe, which swelled
with Sierra runoff to its highest
level in 80 years, Nevada casinos
became the latest flood casualties.
With the m£yor highway into the
city of Stateline blocked by mud
slides and washouts and likely to
remain closed for weeks, tourism
has dropped off sharply.
At least 29 deaths have been

blamed on the series of storms that
have caused floods, landslides and
avalanches across the West since
Dec. 26. In addition, three women
are missing in Yuba County. Thou
sands of homes and businesses
have been swamped in California,
Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Wash
ington in some of the worst flood
ing in decades.
Rising rivers have flooded newly
planted winter wheat, fruit and
walnut orchards and vineyards in
California and alfalfa and garlic
fields in northern Nevada. Officials
say it's too early to assess crop
damage but damage to tractors,
forklifts and other farm machinery
could be even worse.

"A lot of farmers are going to
have really severe problems restor
ing their property and getting back
in business," said California Farm
Bureau spokesman Dave Kranz.
"Property damage is going to dis
rupt lives for a long time to come."
Most of the 125,000 evacuees
have been able to return home and
begin the process of reclaiming
their homes from the mud and
floodwaters, but more evacuations
were ordered as battered levees
continued to weaken and break.
Crews worked feverishly under
a clear sky in the Central Valley
and the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta to shore up key sections of
Northern California's 6,000-mile

network of levees. Near Manteca,
two levees failed yesterday, and
within hours, up to 7 feet of water
swamped 50 square miles, flooded
200 homes and threatened more.
Work crews tried to reinforce a
nearby levee with plastic sheets,
but the going was tough. They
fought not only floodwaters left by
last week's string of storms, but
some of the season's highest tides.
"We have a double whammy
coming at us," said San Joaquin
Sheriffs Deputy Mike Padilla.
"Right now we're trying to save
Oakwood resort and about 50 or 60
homes out here."
The resort's main attraction is
the Manteca Water Slide.
