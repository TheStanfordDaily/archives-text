Swiss to compensate Jews
GENEVA (AP) — For the first time, Swiss
leaders are ready to compensate Jews who lost
assets during World War II — but not with
government money.
In an attempt to contain an international
furor over whether Switzerland profited from
the Holocaust, the Swiss government said yes
terday it wants to establish a fund with money
from the unclaimed bank accounts of Jews
killed by the Nazis.
Officials stopped short of acquiescing to
Jewish groups' demands that Switzerland
make a goodwill gesture by donating $250 mil
lion to elderly and destitute Jews who lost
family and wealth in the Holocaust.
But Switzerland's governing body, the Fed
eral Executive, said it would "examine the
necessary steps" if there was any evidence
supporting allegations that neutral Switzer-

land laundered billions of dollars worth of
looted Nazi gold and used Jewish assets to
compensate Swiss firms for wartime and post
war losses.
Jewish groups were not satisfied.
White House goes to pot
WASHINGTON (AP) - One week after
denouncing the medical use of marijuana, the
White House said yesterday the government
wiLl spend up to $1 million gathering scientif
ic evidence on its effectivness as a medical
treatment.
Retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey said
the White House drug policy office committed
the funds last month for a comprehensive
review by the Institute of Medicine at the
National Academy of Sciences.
"A lot of people have said we're not inter
ested in the facts on this — and I think this

shows that we are," said Bob Weiner, a
spokesman for the drug policy office, which is
headed by McCaffrey.
The administration was criticized by AIDS
activists last week when officials threatened to
sanction physicians in California and Arizona
who take advantage of those states' newly
relaxed restrictions on the medical use of
some illegal drugs, including marijuana.
Those same activists questioned yesterday
the credibility of any study sponsored by the
White House.
"Putting McCaffrey in charge of this
research is like putting Nixon in charge of the
Watergate files," said Steve Michael, a
spokesman for Act Up, an AIDS activist
group.
Weiner said the Institute of Medicine was
above politics. "It's a totally objective, scientif
ic study. We're not going to get into the emo
tional arguments," he said.
