Professors' reliance
on TAs has grown to
scandalous proportions

THERE IS A quiet scandal
occurring in the humani
ties and social science
departments at Stanford, and it's
in the interests of all involved to
keep it hush-hush. Not that peo
ple don't know, mind you. Every
body knows; we've just been con
ditioned to think of it as normal
and acceptable.
What is this stealth scandal?
Professors routinely delegate
major, if not primary, teaching
responsibilities to graduate stu
dents, and teaching assistant-led
sections have become the most
essential part of many classes.
We all know the standard
excuses. With huge class sizes,
professors cannot be expected to
remember everybody's name and
grade everybody's work. Gradu
ate students are great liaisons
between the scholarly professor
and the naive student. Professors
under pressure to publish cannot
waste time on undergraduates.
None of these are acceptable
any longer.
The use and abuse of graduate
students has gone too far. The
"discussion section" — which
started out as a venue for stu
dents to ask questions to their
more knowledgeable peers — has
metamorphosed into the core of
far too many lecture courses.
It is now routine in most intro
ductory political science, eco
nomics and history courses for
TAs to run all the discussion sec
tions and do all the grading.
There are, of course, notable
exceptions; one can find out
standing professors in every
department who take their teach
ing and grading responsibilities
seriously and do not rely on TAs
any more than necessary. But the
pernicious trend is clear: less and
less student-professor contact,

more and more emphasis on TAs.
None of this should be inter
preted as an attack on the insti
tution of the graduate student
led discussion section. A forum in
which students have the chance
to discuss course material and
ask questions in an informal
atmosphere is a valuable peda
gogical tool. TAs can make excel
lent teaching assistants. The
problem comes when TAs are
asked to do more than merely
assist the professor but are asked
to assume the role of primary
teacher and grader.
Departments should adopt the
following simple policy to ensure
that this worrisome trend does
not get out of control: In any
class in which more than 10 per
cent of the grade is based on sec
tion participation or in which sec
tion attendance is mandatory,
professors should be required to
teach at least one of the sections.
Unfortunately, departments
are not likely to address the prob
lem head on any time soon; they
have too much academic prestige
to lose. For their part, Stanford
undergraduates have little to
gain from complaining about the
situation either; it just makes
their school look bad and their
education appear impersonal. As
for the TAs themselves, they may
chafe under their increasing
workloads, but at least they are
assured of plenty of opportunities
to earn their financial aid pack
ages.
And so the ugly trend contin
ues unremarked and unmitigat
ed.
The slow and steady erosion of
professorial teaching is a scandal
more pernicious than Bookstore
embezzlement or indirect-cost
fiascos. It strikes at the very
heart of the academic mission of
the University. One can only hope
that professors, undergraduates
and graduate students overcome
their conspiracy of silence and
start to address this worrisome
trend.
