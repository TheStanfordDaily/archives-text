## Defending the West Coast 
### 
NOT TOO LONG ago, I was at my
best friend's house in Southern
California. I became engaged in a
conversation with his mother about life in
California compared with life in her
beloved and native New York.
"This place has no heart and soul — no
culture. California is a wasteland. There's
no theater, no literature, no art. People do
not read. Everyone and everything is
superficial and schlocky. We've lived here
for 20 years, and I can't stand it any
more."
"If you're so unhappy here, why not go
back?" I ask incredulously.
"What, and go back to that frozen
pit?!?"

I have a problem with immigrants. Not
with immigrants from Mexico or Hong
Kong, or Canada or Germany, but with
immigrants from New York, New Jersey
and Massachusetts. I have a problem with
immigrants who come west and talk
trash.
I've had it. I've lived in California for
my entire life, and the more I travel, the
more I'm convinced that I wouldn't want
to live anywhere else. So I've taken the
time to explode a few myths about the
East and West coasts.
Myth No. 1: L.A. is not a real city.
L.A. is the first city of the 20th century.
San Jose is the first city of the 21st centu
ry. Big buildings downtown? Both places
have 'em, but the vast spread of suburbia
and the most complex freeway system in
Vne wofii characterize t'ne fact tna't Cali

fornia cities (with the exception of San
Francisco) were developed after the auto
mobile, with the automobile in mind,
unlike Eastern cities. I'd rather deal with
L.A. freeways than try to drive in Man
hattan any day ...
Myth No. 2: California has no culture.
This one really annoys me. The truth
is, California produces the rest of the
world's culture. Ever watch a movie? How
about buy a CD? In New York, the artsy
fartsy elite write novels. In California, the
same crowd writes screen plays. The dif
ference is that the entire world watches
movies. Unfortunately, the entire world is
also generally illiterate.
Myth No. 3: There's no substitute for
an Eastern education.
If you believe this, transfer. 'Nuff said.
Myth No. 4: California sports fans
don't exist.
Even though fans show up late and
leave early, the L.A. Dodgers were second
in National League attendance this year
behind another western team, the Col
orado Rockies. No state has more profes
sional baseball teams than California. The
same is true for basketball, hockey and,
yes, even football (remember, the "New
York" Jets and Giants play in New Jer
sey). And for all of you who scoff at the
fact that L.A. has no pro football, I'd sug
gest that there's still one professional
team left: the USC Trojans.
Myth No. 5: L.A. has the worst air pol
lution in the world.
The worst air pollution I've ever expe
riencea is in t'ne quaint city oi Oxford,

England. Anyone who has tried to walk
down High Street on a busy day knows
exactly what I'm talking about. Granted,
Oxford isn't on the East Coast, but if
we're talking general pollution, I've been
to New Jersey. The entire state is a Super
fund cite.
Myth No. 6: California, home of natu
ral disasters.
OK, so this isn't a myth. Granted,
we've had more than our share of floods,
earthquakes and fires recently, but at
least it's warm. It's January, and I went to
class yesterday in shorts. See if any of
your friends at Yale and Princeton have
done that recently.
Myth No. 7: California has se«n its
best days.
This was the smug, arrogant line of the
East Coast establishment during the early
19905, when California was in the midst of
its worst recession since World War 11.
While Washington was cutting defense
jobs up and down the state and riots were
brewing in LA, the high-tech industries
in the Silicon Valley quietly built the
infrastructure of the 21st-century econo
my. El Camino Real will replace Wall
Street. The future is here ...

Jim Finsten finally learned to appreciate
New York City, but only after he spent a
weekend, in Paris.
