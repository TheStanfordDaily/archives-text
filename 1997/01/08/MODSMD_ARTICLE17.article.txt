Bookstore, University administration too close

A COUPLE OF days ago I re
ceived a letter from the Regis
trar's Office informing me that
my registration for the winter quarter
is on hold. Upon inquiry, I found out
that the hold was placed by the Stan
ford Bookstore for a bill I paid three
weeks ago. The Bookstore employee
who took my money failed to tell me
that I need to show my receipt to a
clerk in the Registrar's Office, who
will then clear my registration.
Aside from grumblings about Uni
versity bureaucracy and the inefficien
cy of the Bookstore, I found myself
raising some of the concerns recently
voiced by a new student organization,
Stop Monopolies on Campus. The Stan

ford Bookstore, a privately owned,
profit-making venture, holds an uncon
tested monopoly on selling class mate
rials, pays an almost-symbolic fran
chise fee to the University and over
prices textbooks to make big bucks on
students.
However, more than just owning the
ability to exploit our need for class
room materials, the Bookstore also
stands in a direct, and ethically ques
tionable, alliance with the University
administration: If students are unable
to pay inflated prices or are indebted to
the Bookstore for personal reasons,
they are simply not allowed to study at
the University.
An employee of the Registrar's
Office told me that Tresidder Express,

which is owned by the Stanford Book
store, has the same deal with Stan
ford. Thus, students who have bought
one too many Tres Ex packs of Marl
boro Lights may not be able to take
classes in the following quarter
because they have unwittingly set
themselves up to jump through the
twisted hoops of an administration
seemingly bent on knowing and con
trolling every aspect of students' lives.
Big Brother Stanford is watching you
to make sure your money flows direct
ly into the bulging pockets of sympa
thetic interests.
The marriage of private corpora
tions and academics, so alive and well
on the Stanford campus, is detrimen
tal to the privacy and academic welfare

of students, and a boycott of the Book
store is not going to do away with it.
The books we read are an integral part
of the life of the mind on campus, and
we need to have access to them. The
catch is that this access is monopolized
by a private venture that cares about
money, not mind.
To maintain the spirit of free aca
demic inquiry, we need to contest the
monopoly of the Bookstore. We need to
open our own bookstore. More simply
and urgently, administration officials
need to take a minute to recognize stu
dents' rights to privacy and the absur
dity of the Bookstore's monopoly and
privilege.
