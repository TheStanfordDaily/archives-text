# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## After a long break ... a New Year's resolution 
### 
Reprinted with permission, from New
Year's Resolution #4248399, approved
Jan. 1, 1997:
WHEREAS, there comes a time
in every person's life set aside
for self-reflection and re-evalu
ation and thanks to the efforts of insti
tutions of mass media such as tabloids,
the greeting card industry and Dick
Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, that
time always happens to happen about
now, and
WHEREAS, here at Stanford, a New
Year means a New Quarter and all its
promise of new beginnings, and
WHEREAS, despite the opportunity for
new beginnings with deeper meanings,
this New Quarter is already looking
and feeling too much like Every Other
and here you know what I mean, what
with people trying valiantly but vainly
to renew acquaintanceships with sur

face-level questions like "How was
New Year's?" when what they really
should be asking is, "So, how was last
Thursday?" because while New Year's
was pretty lame, last Thursday was,
OHMIGOD, a night for the ages, like,
to the point where if "Last Thursday"
were ever made into a TV movie it
would absolutely get a TV-M rating for
Mature Audiences Only, but even that
would be a joke, because they don't
make a V-chip strong enough to block
out Last Thursday, if you know what I
mean and you would if you'd asked but
you didn't, and
WHEREAS, I owe it to myself to suck as
much marrow as I can from the five
months or so of diems I have left here,
and
WHEREAS, if it is to be, let it begin
with me, and
WHEREAS, as far as policies go, hon
esty's not a bad one, and

WHEREAS, like most people, I've
always considered myself to be open
and honest, but I could've just been
lying to myself the whole time and
never known it, and
WHEREAS, I have never, in all my pre
vious New Years, actually nourished
any New Year's resolutions of my own,
and I'm really interested to see what
would happen if I tried now, and
WHEREAS, there ain't no time like the
present (i.e., now),
BE IT RESOLVED, I will attempt to
eliminate social clutter and improve
my quality of life and the quality of life
of those around me, pursuing an
aggressive agendum of open, honest,
effective communication by saying
what I mean and meaning what I say.
And you know what I mean when I say
this. "If I have time" or "If I don't have
too much work" means Yes. "I don't

know" means 1 know but won't tell you
And "I'll try" means No. So why nr t
just say so?, and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, I will
learn to accept that which I cannot
change. There are truths out there
that are self-evident, and I should hold
them to be so. Say with me now: "The
Bookstore is more powerful than you
can possibly imagine and no mere mor
tal with a megaphone will ever, ever
change that fact," and
BE IT ALSO THUSLY RESOLVED, I
will answer the phone on the first ring
whenever I am in a position to do so,
taking messages when it's not for me,
and
BE IT HENCEFORTH RESOLVED, I
will learn to recognize the difference
between my needs and desires and
when to act on them. For example, I
need DR 2 and I will therefore enroll in
"Contemporary Arab Women Writers

and Issues" whether I desire to or not,
and
BE IT HEREBY RESOLVED, I will
keep my finances in working order by
meeting obligations such as paying
my phone bill regularly, and here I
mean after the second Late Payment
Notice but before the bill reaches
$100, whichever comes first; or sec
ond, and
BE IT LAST BUT NOT LEAST
RESOLVED, I will to mine own self be
true; when it comes to mine own
future, I will neither a borrower nor
lender be, and all that is right will be
made right.

Oh, about last Thursday: Well, uhm . .
you just had to be there.
