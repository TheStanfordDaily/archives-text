# SHS looks into proposal to cut back midwifery service
## 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
As a preview of future changes under managed care,
Stanford Health Services is currently considering a
budget proposal which may threaten its midwifery ser
vice.
The proposal calls for the elimination of part-time
staff. Previously, the service had three full-time mid
wives and several part-time ones.
In the future, the midwifery service may no longer
guarantee being on-call for the birth. With the status of
the clinic in doubt, expectant mothers are likely to con
tact a community nurse midwifery service.
As a result, numbers of midwifery deliveries have
dropped dramatically at Stanford Hospital. Previously,

the midwifery practice delivered an average of 13 babies
a month.
"Mothers call to set up an appointment, and then
they fmd out that we may not be around in six or seven
months," said Linda Walsh, director of midwifery at
Stanford Hospital.
"It's fallout from managed aire, which is based pure
ly upon figures," she added. "This is a short-sighted
view, which doesn't take into account benefits of mid
wifery, which, in fact, makes the service cost-effective."
Looking for an alternative to the sterile atmos
phere of traditional birth, a growing number of
women are choosing midwifery, an approach which
addresses psychosocial as well as medical needs of
pregnancy, Walsh said.
The midwifery philosophy
holds that birth is a normal and
healthy process for women and en
courages nonintervention strate
gies, such as walking around dur
ing labor and no use of drugs, she
added.
The midwives remain with the
women throughout labor, in con
trast to traditional delivery.
"Although the nurses are there
the whole time, the doctors arrive
at the end — to catch the baby,"
Walsh said.
She added that midwifery has
other advantages as well, such as
fewer Cesarean births and fewer
underweight babies. Because of in
creased prenatal support, women
may also feel a greater belief in
their mothering abilities.
"These days, women leave (the
hospital) so soon after birth,"
Walsh said. "It's important to de
velop that confidence beforehand."
First begun in 1994, the mid
wifery practice has grown chiefly
through word of mouth in the
Stanford community. SHS has al
ready received more than 50 letters
in support of maintaining the pro
gram.
In addition, the midwifery ser
vice participated in an outreach
program for lower-income mothers
on Medi-Cal. Working in partner
ship with the Planned Parenthood
and Mayfield Clinic, the program
gave expectant mothers an oppor
tunity for midwife birth.
After completing nursing
school, future midwives typically
enter a master's program in mid
wifery. Midwives subsequently
take a national board of exams and
a state licensing test.
The number of nurse-midwives
has jumped tremendously each
year, Walsh said. According to the
American College of Nurse-Mid
wives, the number of midwife-as
sisted deliveries rose 30 percent
from 1991 to 1994.
As negotiations proceed, Walsh
said she hopes the midwifery ser
vice will continue to accommodate
the needs of the community.
"Stanford Hospital has worked
with us to find creative solutions,"
Walsh said. "They have been very
committed and supportive."
Officials of SHS were unavail
able for comment.
