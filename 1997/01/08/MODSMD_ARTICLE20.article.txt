## Concrete and bolts used to reinforce Quad buildings Measures counteract forces generated in an earthquake to maintain structural integrity 
### Daniel Wan 
Since the Loma Prieta Earth
quake of Oct. 17, 1989, Stanford
has been working through an
aggressive seismic rehabilitation
and strengthening program to
repair its earthquake-damaged
facilities and reinforce its other
seismically vulnerable buildings.
With the San Andreas Fault
only 4 1/2 miles away from the cen
ter of campus, Stanford frequently
has had to assess the seismic haz
ards and threats to life safety on
campus.
"Loma Prieta was a wake-up
call," said Facilities Project Man
agement Director Mark Jones.
"Rerffember that the University
had been seriously damaged in the
1906 quake, but 83 years had
passed since then. We were very
lucky in 1989, with no deaths or
serious injuries."
The epicenter of the Loma Pri
eta Earthquake was located about
30 miles southeast of the campus.
It caused about $120 million in
damage to University facilities.
The buildings that suffered the
most damage were those that had
not been rehabilitated in the 1970s
in accordance with modern stan
dards of seismic reinforcement.

"The threat of potential dam
age caused by a major earthquake
at Stanford is largely due to the

presence of buildings constructed
of unreinforced masonry, the pre
dominant type of construction

within Stanford's Main Quad,"
Earthquake Recovery Program
Administrator Jean Barnes said.
In 1989, there were about 50
unreinforced masonry structures
on campus. After the Loma Prieta
Earthquake, a dozen of those were
closed due to earthquake damage.
In accordance with an ordinance
approved by Santa Clara County,
these unreinforced masonry struc
tures are now the focus of an ongo
ing $200 million seismic rehabilita
tion program to strengthen all the
unreinforced buildings in the Quad
and the freestanding arcades con
necting them by 2000.
During an earthquake, two
types of forces act on a building.

The building experiences forces
perpendicular to itself, or "out-of
plane" forces, that push the walls
in and out. It also experiences par
allel forces, or "in-plane" forces,
that push the walls left and right.
As the ground moves in one direc
tion, the weight of the building is
thrown in the opposite direction.
Earthquakes damage unrein
forced masonry structures by com
promising the structural stability
of the walls and distorting the
floor or roof horizontally. This
causes the roof to sag and the
ground to crack. The roof and floor
have even been found to have sep
arated from the walls, causing
them to tip over and collapse.

The "in-plane" forces cause the
wails to crack diagonally while the
"out-of-plane" forces cause them
to crack horizontally.
Several things are being done to
reinforce or restore structural
integrity to the masonry struc
tures in the Quad. To prevent the
floor and roof from distorting hor
izontally, plywood sheathing is
added as reinforcement.
Like a box that is stronger when
it has a sturdy lid, this has the
effect of making the building act as
a single unit, or integrated system,
during an earthquake. Reinforced
concrete is also applied to the
masonry to prevent "in-plane"
wall failure.
"Out-of-plane" wall failure is
prevented by tying reinforced
concrete to the masonry. To pre
vent wall separation, the walls are
tied to the floor and roof with
bolts.
"The No. 1 priority is life safety,
and that is the basic criterion for
all our seismic strengthening pro
jects," Jones said. Among the Uni
versity's other priorities for these
projects are being able to keep
operating after a major earth
quake and preserving the school's
architectural heritage.
Since 1989, Stanford has seis
mically rehabilitated more than a
dozen unreinforced masonry
structures in the Quad. In the next
year alone, four additional struc
tures are planned to be seismically
restructured, including Buildings
10, 40, 50 and 240.
Jones pointed out that "the
campus is much better prepared
for a major quake than it was in
1989. With our aggressive
strengthening program due to be
completed by the year 2000, we
are very far along in that effort.
Our risk is significantly
reduced."
