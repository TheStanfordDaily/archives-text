# Choosing a shoe
## Right pair may prevent athletic injuries 
### Mignon Fogarty Contributing writer 
Remember
when you had a
pair of tennie run
ners, just plain old
shoes? Today
there seems to be
a shoe for every

purpose: running, walking, tennis,
basketball. The list goes on and on.
Runners were the first to buy
into the specialty shoe idea, mak
ing Nike Waffle Trainers the top
selling athletic shoes in 1974. Five
years later Nike introduced the
now famous "Air" cushioning sys
tem, and competition in the shoe
industry has spiraled fiercely ever
since.
"Competition among athletic
shoe manufacturers has really ben
efited the consumer by improving
the technology of the shoes,"
according to Orlando Arcement,
assistant manager of The Athlete's
Foot in the Stanford Shopping

Center. "They are always trying to
make shoes that have better cush
ioning and more comfort than
their competitors."
Clinical Podiatry Prof. Wilfred
Laine believes shoes designed for
specific sports do provide a benefit
to the wearer. "Specialty shoes are
made for a particular sport," he
said. "For example, tennis shoes
are designed to protect you better
during side-to-side motion."
But are these specialty shoes
really worth the exorbitant prices?
"Depending on your amount of
activity, you should buy the best
shoe you can afford," said Laine.
"For the most part there is a corre
lation between price and quality."
Arcement agreed. "Every foot
and every person is different, but
generally you get what you pay
for."
"If you're running you need
shoes to protect you from the
shock of landing on the ground,"

Running
These are considered forward
motion shoes. The shoe will roll
forward because of the raised-up
toe. They also are very light
Walking
A little heavier than other
athletic shoes, they are designed
for the everyday person who does
a lot of walking. Many running
and walking shoes now have fea
tures called roll bars or foot
bridges that give added support
for people who over-pronate.
Tennis
These shoes are flatter under
neath than a running shoo, which
gives support and stability when

moving in a side to side or lateral
motion. Additional support is pro
vided through a leather upper.
Basketball
Very similar to tennis shoes,
these shoes tend to have more
ankle support and more cushion
ing for jumping up and down.
Cross trainers
These shoes are not suggested
for people who do any serious
activity. They are designed for
people like travelers who do a mild
workout on the road. They are
much heavier than running shoes
and don't have as much support.
You should never run more than 2
miles in cross trainers.

added Laine. "When you run, the
force of hitting the ground is three
to seven times your body weight, as
opposed to one to three times your
body weight if you're just walking.
"Foot injuries are very com
monplace," he said. "The most
common problems are with ill-fit

ting shoes. The toe may jam in
the end of the shoe if it's not long
enough, resulting in blisters on
the toe and heel.
"The majority of people buy
their shoes too small," Arcement
said. "The foot tends to spread
and elongate when you get hot.
We actually suggest buying ath
letic shoes a half-size too big."
Laine suggested three fea
tures to look for when buying
athletic shoes:

• Shoes should have a very
firm counter. This is a hard cup
in the back of the shoe that cups
and supports the heel.
• You shouldn't be able to
bend the shoe in half. It should
bend at the ball of the foot, not
the middle.
• The shoe should have tor
sional stability. You shouldn't be
able to twist the shoe excessively.
This ensures that it will stand up
to lots of wear and tear.
