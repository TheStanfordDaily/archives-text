## Zare ponders life on Earth, Mars and beyond

Despite the conventional wis
dom, visiting a professor at Stan
ford is somewhat intimidating,
especially when the professor in
question is well-known in the sci
entific community and teaches
your chemistry class. But Chem
istry Prof. Richard Zare, a tieless
man reclining on a couch in his
spacious office, projects an air of
informality.
The subject of his impending
trip to Antarctica is on everyone's
minds. As the chairman of the
National Science Board, Zare
must address the many issues
involved in Antarctic exploration.
For example, he cited the high
costs of transporting equipment
to the bottom of the world, as well
as the limits imposed by being
environmentally responsible.
"We can only leave footprints
and take away memories," Zare
said.
Despite the difficulties
involved with research in Antarc
tica, Zare still believes that fur
ther research involving the ozone
hole, astronomy and bacteriology
would increase the understanding
of one of the least-known parts of
the planet.
Beyond Earth lies a universe
full of planets, each with the
potential to offer information
about a different form of life.
"When I was young, I went to
zoos, and that was life," Zare
said. "Imagine my surprise when
I found out that most life was
undergound."
Recently, Zare investigated a
meteorite found in Antarctica. By
analyzing the relative abundance
of different types of atoms in the

rocks with a team of researchers,
he was able to determine that the
specimens did not originate on
Earth — indeed, they seemed to
be Martian.
Using a home-built device
called a mass spectrometer, the

research team found organic com
pounds of the type deposited by
bacteria Also found were miner
als which are often deposited by
bacteria. Using scanning electron
microscopes, the team found
traces of "microfossils," which

could again be residue left over
from bacteria.
Zare, however, "maintains a
level of healthy skepticism." He
stressed that, although he has
confidence in his data, the rest of
his analysis is only a theory.
In fact, two papers published
in Geochmica et Cosmochimica
Act, the journal of the Geochem
istry Society and the Meteoritical
Society, suggest alternative expla
nations for the presence of the
organic compounds.
Zare said further research in
this area can only help us deter
mine the exact nature of the dis
covery the team made. Therefore,
according to Zare, the existence of
life on Mars is still an open ques
tion.
He has laid out his theory
before the scientific community,
and now awaits more research to
add evidence in support of or con
trary to his claim.
Further research will most
probably include other teams of
researchers who will try to ana
lyze more meteorites taken from
Antarctica in an attempt to repro
duce his results. He even believes
that human exploration of Mars
is "our destiny in time."
Zare has always been interest
ed in science, graduating with
degrees in both chemistry and
physics. In addition to his
research goals, he is strongly
devoted to teaching.
He believes that teaching caus
es him to question his own beliefs.
He even describes science as
"schizophrenia" — a delicate bal
ance between daring to dream a
fantasy and being hit with harsh
