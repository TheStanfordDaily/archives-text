Q + How does fluoride prevent
• cavities?
A # The outermost layer of the
4 tooth is made up of enamel,
the hardest substance in the
human body. However, just being
the hardest substance in the
human body doesn't grant your
enamel immunity to decay.
Unfortunately, bacteria which
live in your mouth, and everyone
else's for that matter, produce
acids which can dissolve the
enamel. These bacteria and food
particles and other things inside of
your mouth make up what people
commonly refer to as plaque.
Dental plaque is bad because it
protect* the bacteria from being

cleaned away. This means that
plaque allows the bacteria to pro
duce enough acid to dissolve a hole
in the enamel. That's a cavity.
If the hole is deep enough, it
can allow other bacteria to invade
into inside of your teeth. That's a
problem. When this happens, usu
ally a root canal or extraction of

the tooth is required, which most
people don't consider too pleasant.
There are three mechanisms
through which fluoride is thought
to prevent tooth decay. The first is
by preventing the bacteria in the
plaque from producing the enam
el-dissolving acid in the first place.
With less acid, there is less dis

solving, and therefore, less tooth
decay. Pretty simple.
Another method by which fluo
ride is thought to prevent cavities
is helping with the remineraliza
tion of enamel. This means that
the fluoride helps to reform tooth
enamel that was dissolved away by
acid — fluoride might actually
help to reverse the formation of
cavities.
This doesn't mean that you can
use fluoride to grow new teeth and
make a huge profit off the tooth
fairy, but it does mean that if you
haven't been brushing your teeth
recently, you can repent now and
hopefully undo some of the dam
age that may have been done to
your teeth.
The third mechanism
through which fluoride fights
tooth decay is by incorporating

itself into the enamel. Fluoride
can convert hydroxyapatite, the
main substance which composes
human bones, into fluorapatite,
which is much less soluble in
acid. This is most effective when
fluoride is ingested while the
tooth is still growing, beneath
the gums.
This doesn't mean that you
should go out and start eating
toothpaste regularly. First of all,
it's probably too late because the
last teeth to appear in most adults
are the wisdom teeth, and yours
are probably fully formed, missing
or have already been painfully
extracted.
Also, most water supplies are
fluoridated, meaning that fluoride
has been added to the water before
it gets to you. This practice start
ed in the 1950s and has been

shown to reduce the incidence of
cavities by up to 60 percent.
In 1995, California passed a bill
to require all water supplies serv
ing more than 25,000 people to
fluoridate their water by Jan. 1.
Some people are against the
fluoridation of water, saying that
excess fluoride can cause bones to
become brittle and lead to the dis
coloration or mottling of the
teeth. However, scientific studies
have shown that the fluoridation
of water at about 1 part per mil
lion, the level used in water sup
plies, has no observable side
effects.
But if you still don't trust the
water, you can always get your
fluoride from natural sources,
such as tea or fish. If you want, I
have a recipe for salmon a la
toothpaste that is to die for.
