## Victorious finale Football's finish made sweeter by tough beginning 
### Courtney Mann Staff writer 
They told us this would happen.
We just didn't believe it.
In late September, after a 14-0
shutout defeat at Wisconsin, a
young, inexperienced Stanford

quarterback said it was just a mat
ter of time until the offense started
to produce. After allowing 11 sacks
in an embarrassing loss to Oregon
State and producing virtually no
rushing game, a much-maligned
Cardinal offensive line claimed it
was just one breakdown away from
executing. The Stanford defense,
worn out from being on the field
for two-thirds of each contest,
warned us to wait for the team to
put a total effort together.
We didn't listen.
Three months and five wins
later, we ate our words. On a sunny
day in El Paso, that same quarter
back, redshirt freshman Chad
Hutchinson was named Sun Bowl
most valuable player for his 22-of
-28, 226-yard performance. That
same offensive line protected
Hutchinson and sprung Stanford
running backs for a total of 207
rushing yards. And a well-rested
defense produced its first shutout
since 1974, while watching both its
offense and special teams execute
to near perfection.
There were signs we should
have picked up on. We could have
expected an explosion like the 38-0
blasting of Michigan State last
week. Running back Mike Mitchell,
perhaps the season's MVP, began
carrying the offense on his shoul
ders as early as the overtime win
against Oregon. Special teams, a
huge part of last season's success,
were noticeably absent early on.
Return men Damon Dunn and
Troy Walters both broke returns
for touchdowns during the season
concluding win streak. The defense
held opponents to just 7.5 points
per game and forced 12 turnovers
in the four games leading up to the
Sun Bowl.
Nothing was more impressive,
however, than the Cardinal's New

Year's Eve performance. Hutchin
son engineered three touchdown
drives and distributed the ball to
nine different receivers through
the game. Cardinal special teams
were not to be outdone, with 94
return yards and a touchdown off
a blocked punt by junior Jeff
Allen.
While the offense rolled, the
second half belonged to the
defense and its quest to shut out a
reputable Spartan offense. When
Alistair White preserved the
shutout by causing a Michigan
State fumble at the Stanford 5-
yard line, the Cardinal defensive
unit completed its best outing in
recent memory. Coming in averag
ing 32 points per game and 187.5
rushing yards per contest, the
Spartans left El Paso with a goose
egg on the scoreboard and just 68
net yards rushing.
However, while the athletic
achievements of this year's football
squad should undoubtedly be com
mended, it is the team's character
that deserves exaltation. Through
seven games, Stanford sat at 2-5
with the bitter taste of the Oregon
State loss and a 41-9 drubbing
from Arizona State in its mouth.
All but mathematically eliminated
from the bowl hunt and with
upcoming games against USC,
UCLA and California, the Cardinal
could have easily closed the book
on 1996.
That was not Stanford's style,
and that style comes directly from
the top Head coach Tyrone Will
ingham, who earned Pac-10 coach
of the year honors last season,
handed in an even more magnifi
cent season this year in the face of
adversity. With no previous head
coaching experience, it was obvi
ously his attitude, presence and
discipline which Stanford took a
chance on, and without it, Stanford
might have finished the season as
poorly as it began it.
Willingham's attitude has clear
ly infested his program. He empha
sizes finishing strong; his Cardinal
squads boast a 6-1 record in
November. The discipline he
demands from his players comes
through in their statements. At 2-
5, Dunn pointed out that they have
to play the rest of their games
regardless of their record, so why
shouldn't they win them. Mike
Mitchell and Kailee Wong called
Washington State the biggest game
of the season as reporters distract
ed them with talk about winning

streaks and bowl aspirations.
It is this aspect that is most
promising about the Willingham
era, which already has two con
secutive bowl appearances under
its belt. Under Willingham, the
Cardinal has built a strong foun
dation. Add to the mix an
offense led by an experienced
Hutchinson, big-play potential
from Dunn and emerging star
Troy Walters, and a running

attack anchored by Mitchell and
Anthony Bookman, who ended a
trying season with a 100-yard
performance. Throw in a confi
dent defense which returns
first-team All-Pac-10 lineman
Wong and perhaps the best
linebacker tandem in the confer
ence in Chris Draft and Jon
Haskins, and that leaves Stan
ford fans with something to be
excited about.
Look at it this way: Guess who
closed out last season with five
consecutive wins? Pac-10 champi
on and fourth-ranked Arizona
State.
