## Stanford finishes 2nd, 3rd at Sugar and Rose bowls 
### Vanessa Arrington Editorial staff 
The Stanford sailing team kept to the helm during
the winter vacation, competing in two bowl regattas
— the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Dec. 28 and the
Rose Bowl in Long Beach last Saturday and Sunday.
Junior skipper John Meade and sophomore crew
member Jessica Knape made up the Stanford A Divi
sion boat at the Sugar Bowl Intersectional, while the
B Division was represented by senior skipper Alice
Manard and freshman crew member Katie Gregg.
Together, the two boats garnered Stanford a second
place finish at the regatta, hosted by Tulane. Navy
came in first place.
According to coach Steve Bourdow, the conditions
at the Sugar Bowl regatta were poor, as there was no
wind. The event was scheduled to run two days; how
ever the second day of races was canceled, due to the
conditions.
"We're better in heavier winds — in the fall we
had more practice in heavy air," Knape said.
"We didn't live up to our potential," she added. "A
lot of the competitors were very strong, but we're
hoping to do better the rest of the season."
Meade and Knape's boat had a tough start at the
Sugar Bowl regatta, when their boat capsized, con
sidered a "boat-handling error."
"Capsizing is rare with such an experienced skip
per," Knape said. "It set us back — that's something
beginners do. What we think caused it was the mud
in the mast, which makes it hard to stabilize."
The A Division boat came in eighth and sixth
places in the first two races, which "really hurt,"
Bourdow said. "It is rare for them to be out of the top
three," he said. The boat improved though for the
next two races, placing second in each.
Manard's boat won overall in the B Division,
though in one individual race she tied with Meade's
younger brother from Navy. Both Meades are New
Orleans natives.
Next on the agenda for the Cardinal sailors was
the Rose Bowl regatta early this month, hosted by
USC and UC-Irvine. A major sailing event, this
regatta featured 18 top teams across the country.
Dartmouth, St. Mary's (Md.), Boston University
and Tufts joined all the big West Coast schools to
compete in this event, in which Stanford placed
third. St. Mary's was the victor, followed by Tufts.
"Our goal was to finish top three," Bourdow said.
