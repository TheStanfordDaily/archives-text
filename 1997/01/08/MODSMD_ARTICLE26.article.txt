Men's Tennis
Stanford men started off
with a bang yesterday at
the 22nd annual Milwau
kee Tennis Classic. In the
first round, junior Paul
Goldstein defeated DePaul's
Alan Pintario 7-6, 6-3,

senior Grant Elliott defeated Josh Bainton
of Old Dominion 6-1, 6-1, and sophomore
Ryan Wolters defeated Ryan Baxter of
Kansas 6-3, 6-4. The only Cardinal loss came
from junior Charles Hoeveler, who suc
cumbed to Texas Tech's Tylar Jimenez 3-6,
6-4, 6-2.
In the second round of yesterday's play,

Cardinal dominance continued. Goldstein
defeated Eric Allen of Texas 6-1, 6-4, Elliott
defeated Nebraska's Todd Nicholl 6-2, 6-2,
and Wolters defeated Brian Moss of North
western 6-1, 6-1.
Singles and doubles matches start today
at 8 a.m. The Milwaukee Tennis Classic will
end Saturday.
Golf
Stanford women's golf looks ahead to an
increasingly successful future, as it recently
signed on the top recruiting class in the
country. Joining the Cardinal squad next fall
will be Jessica Belskis from Columbus, Ohio,
Hilary Homeyer from Edina, Minn., and
Stephanie Keever from Las Vegas.
Belskis was first-team all-state in 1994
and 1995, AJGA Rolex Ail-American, three

time Ohio state junior girls champion and
defending two-time Ohio high school state
champion. Homeyer, who started playing
golf just three years ago, is also an AJGA
Rolex All-American, a U.S. junior girls
championship quarterfinalist, the 1996 Min
nesota State junior champion and in the
U.S. women's amateur championship round
of 16. Keever is the 1996 high school golfer
of the year and an AJGA Rolex Ail-Ameri
can, and she qualified for the 1996 U.S.
Women's Open championship.
Football
Don Treadwell, the running backs coach for
the Cardinal for the past two seasons under
Tyrone Willingham, has left the University to

take a job as offensive coordinator
at Boston College. Under Tread
well's guidance, junior Anthony
Bookman and senior Mike
Mitchell thrived, although the
running game struggled at the
beginning of this season.
The Golden Eagles (5-7 in
1996) were rocked by a gambling
scandal in midseason and lost four
of their last five games as head
coach Dan Henning stepped down.
