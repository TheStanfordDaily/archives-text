Senior free safety Josh Madsen got the scoreboard in
motion in the Cardinal's 38-0 triumph over Michigan
State in the Sun Bowl New Year's Eve. Madsen picked off
a Todd Schultz pass and deftly returned it 29 yards before
lateraling to senior teammate Pruitt, who went the
remaining half of the field for Stanford's first score. The
win was especially sweet for the 23-year-old Madsen, who
has been a part of three Stanford teams that reached
bowls dating back to Denny Green's 1991 squad.

Junior setter Lisa Sharpley directed the vicious Cardi
nal attack to five easy wins in the NCAA tournament.
Stanford dropped just one game out of 16 in winning its
third national title in five seasons, and Sharpley, although
overshadowed in the spotlight hv Final Four MVT Kerri
Walsh, posted 83 assists as the Cardinal's lone setter dur
ing the final weekend in Cleveland. Sharpley earned first
team All-America honors after taking over the setting
chores exclusively this season following the graduation of
two-time national player of the year Carv Wendell.
