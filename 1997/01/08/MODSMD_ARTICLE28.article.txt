# Women's rugby hopes to continue expansion
## 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
In the muddy weeks that
closed fall quarter most Stanford
students sought the shelter of the
indoors. Most Stanford students,
that is, except those on the
women's rugby team.
This club sport was restarted
at Stanford six years ago. It orig
inally began in the mid-1970s but
was completely eliminated in the
late 1980s due to a lack of inter
est. But after erratic participa
tion from Stanford women over
two decades, the team is finally
coming into its own. Last season
the squad was large enough to
field two teams (each consisting
of 15 players) for the first time
ever, and the numbers are grow
ing.
Each year the club begins
recruiting when classes begin in
the fall. The newcomers are then
taught the basics of the sport by
the returning players. The pro
cess can even be as mundane as
introducing a player to a rugby
ball for the first time as most
interested students have never
played rugby.
"I had no idea what it was
before I started," said freshman
Karina Celaya, who played bas
ketball in high school. "I had to
try something different, and it
was a physical sport. I love it."
This fall more than 50 stu
dents came out for the team, but
senior co-captain Megan Hi man
said the numbers usually dwindle
throughout fall quarter and level
off in early winter. Ideally, the
team would like to have at least

35 to 40 players when the season
begins early this quarter so that
it can consistently field two
teams. No one is cut from the
squad, but according to Himan,
the process of learning the sport
is "self-selective." Most people
who aren't suited for rugby drop
out on their own.
"It kind of gets frustrating at
times," Himan said of training
new rookies each year. "When we
start tackling, the numbers
decrease. It's interesting because
everybody starts on the same
level, and we spend fall quarter
teaching everyone to play.
Rugby's the kind of sport where
everyone can come out and play if
they have the desire."
Most of the athletes on the
team do have that desire, thanks
to athletic careers in high school,
and the athletic experience gives
the team an advantage in train
ing the new rookies. Hut a big
obstacle for developing a rugby
mentality is getting adjusted to
the game's style of play, which is
drastically different from most
organized sports. Rugby is a
high -contact sport very much like
football, and the excessive con
tact is usually something most
female athletes are not familiar
with.
"Most everyone has played
something in high school," said
sophomore Heather Smith, who
is on the team's fund-raising
committee. "We start from the
very basics â€” 'This is a ball.' "
Despite the strenuous process
of training new talent each year,
