# Women's rugby hopes to continue expansion
## 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
In the muddy weeks that
closed fall quarter most Stanford
students sought the shelter of the
indoors. Most Stanford students,
that is, except those on the
women's rugby team.
This club sport was restarted
at Stanford six years ago. It orig
inally began in the mid-1970s but
was completely eliminated in the
late 1980s due to a lack of inter
est. But after erratic participa
tion from Stanford women over
two decades, the team is finally
coming into its own. Last season
the squad was large enough to
field two teams (each consisting
of 15 players) for the first time
ever, and the numbers are grow
ing.
Each year the club begins
recruiting when classes begin in
the fall. The newcomers are then
taught the basics of the sport by
the returning players. The pro
cess can even be as mundane as
introducing a player to a rugby
ball for the first time as most
interested students have never
played rugby.
"I had no idea what it was
before I started," said freshman
Karina Celaya, who played bas
ketball in high school. "I had to
try something different, and it
was a physical sport. I love it."
This fall more than 50 stu
dents came out for the team, but
senior co-captain Megan Hi man
said the numbers usually dwindle
throughout fall quarter and level
off in early winter. Ideally, the
team would like to have at least

35 to 40 players when the season
begins early this quarter so that
it can consistently field two
teams. No one is cut from the
squad, but according to Himan,
the process of learning the sport
is "self-selective." Most people
who aren't suited for rugby drop
out on their own.
"It kind of gets frustrating at
times," Himan said of training
new rookies each year. "When we
start tackling, the numbers
decrease. It's interesting because
everybody starts on the same
level, and we spend fall quarter
teaching everyone to play.
Rugby's the kind of sport where
everyone can come out and play if
they have the desire."
Most of the athletes on the
team do have that desire, thanks
to athletic careers in high school,
and the athletic experience gives
the team an advantage in train
ing the new rookies. Hut a big
obstacle for developing a rugby
mentality is getting adjusted to
the game's style of play, which is
drastically different from most
organized sports. Rugby is a
high -contact sport very much like
football, and the excessive con
tact is usually something most
female athletes are not familiar
with.
"Most everyone has played
something in high school," said
sophomore Heather Smith, who
is on the team's fund-raising
committee. "We start from the
very basics — 'This is a ball.' "
Despite the strenuous process
of training new talent each year,
the success of the sport is rising,
and the team itself can take full
credit. The sport is an organiza
tion run completely by the stu
dents, and although the team has
three coaches, most of the orga
nizational work is done by the
players.
The team works very hard,
*aid head coach Franck Boivert.
"I'm very impressed with the
work they put into the program.
We're just well-organized. In the
fall we concentrate on teaching
the basics. We have a much larg
er squad [this year], and the new
players are more athletic than
ever."
The team's organization is a
key to its success. The squad has
two presidents, Himan and
senior Keiko Suda (her room
mate), a financial manager, three
fund-raising chairs and a social
chair for organizing team func
tions.
Women's rugby gets some

money through the school's fund
for club sports, but the amount is
nowhere close to covering
expenses for the team. As a
result, the women participate in
as many fund-raisers as possible,
but the remainder of the costs
come from each player's own
pockets.
"I deal with all the money and
take care of dues," said sopho
more financial manager Lara
Strauss. "A big chunk of money
comes from club sports. Players
pay $95 per year plus pay for
their food [on road trips] and
some other [expenses] along the
way."
Travel is perhaps the biggest
financial burden on the team. In
addition to buying most of their
equipment, the players must
arrange and pay for all travel
expenses. Smith said the team
carpools to most competitions
and pays the drivers for gas. The
squad cuts costs where it can, but
the lack of nearby competition is
a problem.
"It's one of those things we
just have to do," freshman Anne-
Caroline Gamier said of fund

raisers. "It's kind of a bonding
experience. It's worth it once
we're on the field."
The team does face many
nearby non-college club teams
composed of a varied age group of
women. The players said these
teams are usually physically big
ger and more skilled than most
collegiate teams and give Stan
ford its best workouts. The
women's squad rarely wins a
game against these club teams,
but gains valuable experience
against tougher opponents.
"We go up against some pretty
scary women," Gamier said.
"Every single practice and game
you learn so much. It's nuts.
They say if you're not confused
and you're not hurt, you're not
playing."
For now, the women are
going about business as usual.
The veterans are training the
rookies, and the team is prepar
ing for the start of a new season.
The ultimate goal for this squad
is to reach the NCAA tourna
ment in the spring, but right
now they'll settle for learning
those tackles.
