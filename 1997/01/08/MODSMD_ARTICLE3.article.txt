## Report to detail how records are kept on students, faculty 
### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
The ways in which the University holds records
and information about its members will be ex
plained in-depth in a study to be released next
week.
The study, which will be published Wednesday
in Stanford Report, details University procedures
dealing with information in five main areas — com
puter activity (e-mail and Internet usage), the tele
phone system, cable TV, University ID cards and
the library circulation system.
According to University President Gerhard
Casper's research assistant, third-year law student
Leslie Hatamiya, Casper called for the report in
order to inform members of the Stanford commu
nity of how the University holds records about

them, how long that information is held and how
certain people could be affected legally in certain
situations. Hatamiya did the research for the re
port.
Director of University Communications Terry
Shepard said, "It turns out that there are so many
aspects of [information storage], different policies
on backups of systems," in addition to other th'.ngs,
that Casper wanted a report so that people could
read about University policies on information stor
age"
Shepard also said there was no need for worry
about information security. "University records
are safeguarded quite well. Backups are locked in
safe places, and those who have access are limited"
in the information they can view.
Hatamiya added, Casper
"asked me to do a report looking
at computer security, but more
generally electronic record keep
ing. A lot of people don't realize
the extent of electronic records,
and hopefully this report will
make them more aware."
Hatamiya cited certain in
stances in which legal complexi
ties could arise due to the way
some records are stored and how
the campus-wide system is oper
ated as reasons to raise the de
gree of awareness on campus
about such matters.
Among various unintended
consequences of electronic
record keeping, Hatamiya men
tioned was the possibility of
backup records of a student or
faculty member being subpoe
naed by courts.
