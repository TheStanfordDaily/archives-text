# 3 committees appointed to look at merger
## 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
A group of committees formed
by the School of Medicine's Facul
ty Senate is set to look into the im
plications for faculty of the recent
ly approved merger between Stan
ford Health Services and UC-San
Francisco's medical center.
Medical School Dean Eugene
Bauer requested that the senate
"help establish the academic prior
ities of the school," in preparation
for the merger, which will combine
clinical enterprises but leave the
two medical schools as separate
entities, according to the senate's
chair, Medicine and Molecular
Pharmacology Prof. Kenneth Mel
mon.

Melmon said Bauer's request
came around the time the merger
was approved in November; since
then, three committees have been
appointed. He added that parallel
efforts are in progress at UCSF.
The first of the committees,
Melmon said, would work on
"clearly stating the academic pri
orities," of the medical school as it
exists. The second would look into
the possibilities for cooperation
with UCSF, and the third would
act as a "sounding board" to over
see and review the work of the
other two and coordinate parallel
efforts at UCSF.
Advocates of the merger have
predicted that, even with the med-
ical schools left separate, new op
portunities for collaboration will
emerge in research and teaching.
Many opponents inside and out
side the school have expressed con
cern that the merger will result in
an over-emphasis on financial con
cerns rather than the academic
missions of the two schools.
Melmon agreed that, to an ex
tent, "both sides are right," and
that there is "an enormous poten
tial for gain" but also "a potential
for enormous loss."
Once the senate has completed
its inquiries, Melmon said, the
deans of the two medical schools
will have a way to let the future
heads of the merged company know
what the faculty consider to be the
school's ongoing priorities and pos
sible benefits of the merger.
"Deans will be more convincing
if they are backed up by some
mechanism of faculty support,"
Melmon explained.
Molecular and Cellular Physiol

ogy Prof. Richard Scheller, who co
chairs the first committee, said the
committee's work was not entirely
specific to the merger but dealt
with finding out "what [the school]
could not live without, regardless
of the merger."
He called Stanford's medical
school an "extremely strong insti
tution" and said the merger would
not affect its basic priorities of
"training the nation's leaders in
biomedical research and the acade
mic practice of medicine."
The committee, he said, has
"tried to set its priorities without
regard to the merger." Regarding
the faculty's concerns about possi
ble negative effects of the merger
on the school's basic mission, he
said a common problem was a lack
of information among the faculty
about the merger in general.
"Our job is not an easy one in
terms of 'looking into this,' be
cause no one (on the faculty) really
knows what it is."
He added that while "the facul
ty could have been more closely
informed" of the merger's
progress, he did not see any con
scious effort on the part of the ad

ministration to preserve secrecy;
he added that the administration
itself probably did not yet have a
tremendously clearer idea than
the faculty of the details of the
merged corporation.
He said his committee was plan
ning to "make it clear to [the heads
of a merged corporation] that there
are certain things that it would be
intolerable to live without."
Hopefully, he said, the heads of
the new corporation "will take
these recommendations into con
sideration."
He added that because the med
ical schools themselves will not be
merged, "The effect on basic re
search faculty is likely to be far less
dramatic than the effect on clinical
faculty."
Scheller's committee is official
ly called the Committee on Stan
ford Medical School Academic Pri
orities and is co-chaired by Assoc.
Medicine and Oncology Prof. San
dra Horning.
Genetics Prof. Uta Francke, co
chair of the Academic Priorities
and Strategies for Collaboration
Committee, said her committee
has only met once and was "still

trying to define its charges."
She said they were looking at
collaboration in teaching on three
levels, the training of medical stu
dents, graduate students and resi
dents.
According to Francke, effects on
graduate students should not im
mediately be great, and resident
training has many legal aspects
that need to be cleared up before
her committee can examine it
properly.
Regarding medical students,
however, Francke said she was "re
ally looking forward" to the find
ings of a Medical Education Com
mittee, chaired by Asst. Dean for
Medical Student and Graduate Af
fairs Marc Nelson.
She explained that Nelson's
committee, set up through the
Dean's Office independent of the
senate, has received additional
funding to look into collaborative
matters and run focus groups. It
should report in the near future.
Francke herself is involved in
one of the first projected collabora
tive schemes, which involves a
joint residency program in genetic
medicine with UCSF. She ex

plained that genetic medicine has
only recently been treated as a spe
cialty in its own right, hence the
need to establish new residency
programs.
She added that the joint resi
dency program is "in the planning
stages" and might eventually serve
as a model for future collabora
tions.
Francke's co-chair is Health Re
search and Polity Prof. Bill Brown.
The third committee, the Over
sight and Coordinating Commit
tee, is chaired by Asst. Medicine
Prof. Linda Boxer and Assoc. Neu
rosurgery Prof. John Adler.
Boxer said the committee would
"oversee and critique" the conclu
sions of the other two. She agreed
with Scheller that the administra
tion and especially the faculty "are
not 100 percent clear what the
merger is going to mean."
According to Boxer, "Most of
the faculty I've talked to are taking
a 'wait-and-see' attitude" about
what the merger will mean for
teaching and research.
"It's up to the faculty to make
sure it doesn't have a negative im
pact," Boxer added.
