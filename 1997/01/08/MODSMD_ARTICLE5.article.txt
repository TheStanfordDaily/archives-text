# Frosh seminars gain momentum
## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
By the end of this month, more
than seven new freshman semi
nars in the School of Humanities
and Sciences may receive their
final stamp of approval from the
Provost's Office. As many as 30
seminars will be available for
freshmen next fall.
Freshman seminars are "some
thing that the president and
provost have been very interested
in these last couple of years," said
Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education Ramon Saldivar.
"What I'm hoping for is that we
will begin to offer something like 30
seminars — so (for) roughly one
third of the class — fall of '97," he
said, adding that by 1999, he hopes
to offer freshman seminars for
everyone who wants to take them.
"The provost and president
asked the departments to do a very

comprehensive
self-study to see
what was our pre
sent commitment
to undergraduate
education," Saldi
var said.
This informa
tion was reported
to the schools' re
spective deans to

determine what resources they
had available in order to hold sem
inars exclusively for freshmen.
"Departments are not com
pelled to do this. They're being in
vited to propose," Saldivar said.
112 After the deans review the pro
posal*, they are submitted to the
Humanities and Sciences Under
graduate Advisory Council, which
is made up of five administrators
and two at-large faculty members.
The council currently has in its


Saldivar
hands about 10 proposals and will
make its recommendations to the
Provost's Office later this month.
"We'll assess the quality of the
proposals and what they're asking
for in terms of support. The de
partment has to commit a certain
amount of its own resources," said
Saldfvar, who serves as chair of the
council.
The University will provide ad
ditional funding and faculty billets
to cover the strain of additional
classes.
However, Asst. Dean of Under
graduate Studies Ellen Woods
noted that most of the proposals
were not that far along in the
process.
"We still haven't received most

proposals. Most are still at the
deans," Woods said.
Saldfvar said all schools in the
University, including graduate
schools, were invited to submit
proposals for seminars, something
not previously seen in the sopho
more programs.
"I anticipate that there will be
proposals made by schools outside
of Engineering, Earth Sciences,
and Humanities and Sciences (the
only schools which give undergrad
uate degrees). I certainly hope that
happens," he said.
James Baron, associate dean at
the Graduate School of Business,
said his school submitted several
proposals, but he admitted that
those proposals would be quite dif
ferent from those of undergradu
ate schools. The Business School's
proposals did not mention specific
seminars they would teach. They
did, however, "make a commit

ment across a range of topics,"
Baron said.
"Our faculty enjoy teaching un
dergraduates. It's a chance to ad
dress a different type of audience,"
he added.
The freshman seminars are
part of the Introductory Studies
Program, which is also in charge of
the Cultures, Ideas and Values
Program, the Program in Writing
and Critical Thinking, the Science
Core, advising for underclassmen,
Sophomore College, and sopho
more seminars and dialogues.
"We began with sophomore pro
grams because that's where a lot of
immediate need was for students,"
Saldivar said.
He admitted that the sopho
more programs are not yet perfect
ed, but he still felt they had made a
lot of progress in achieving the pro
grams' goals.
The freshman seminar pro

gram has similar goals driving it —
participation of tenured faculty
and small classes of 15 to 16 stu
dents. The announcement to cre
ate the seminars was made last
May.
Saldfvar explained the differ
ence between the freshman and
sophomore programs: An entire
department will take responsibili
ty to conduct a freshman seminar
while with sophomore programs,
individual faculty members make
the decision to teach a seminar or
dialogue.
However, not everyone is com
pletely pleased with the new pro
gram. The Economics and Physics
departments are two which have
not yet submitted proposals.
Economics Prof. John Taylor
has expressed his concern that
high school seniors used to classes
with 20 students are often thrown
into large introductory lectures

their freshman year and that this
should be a primary concern for
the introductory studies effort.
"Courses like Economics 1
should be viewed as a part of the in
troductory studies program," Tay
lor said.
As part of the program, he pro
posed that introductory sections
could be led by tenured professors
instead of graduate students.
Without Economics 1, Taylor
said the freshmen wishing to par
ticipate in the seminars would
miss an important part of econom
ics.
"Unfortunately, [the seminars
would! have to be less technical.
They'd have to focus on the history
of economic thought," Taylor said.
Saldi'var noted that the Eco
nomics Department may choose to
submit a proposal for a freshman
seminar later, as many other de
partments are choosing to do.
