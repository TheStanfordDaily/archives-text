## Apologetic Gingrich to head House again 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a dramatic
opening to the 105 th Congress, Newt Gin
grich overcame dissension in the GOP ranks
yesterday to become the first Republican re
elected House speaker in 68 years. "I apolo
gize to the House and the country" for past
errors, he said.
Gingrich sealed his victory in a tense,
hour-long roll call less than three weeks
after admitting he violated House rules in
the long-running ethics case against him.
His punishment, to be voted on by the full
House, remains to be set.
Across the Capitol, the GOP-controlled
Senate held a more serene opening day ses
sion. Vice President A 1 Gore administered
the oath of office to 15 newly elected sena
tors as well as veterans who won new terms
in November. Retired Majority Leader Bob
Dole made a sentimental return to the
chamber, escorting freshman Kansas Sen.
Sam Brownback to be sworn in.
"The Senate is sort of an island of tran
quility in a city that has a lot of problems,"
Majority Leader Trent Lott said.
That was a reference, in part, to the
House, where Gingrich's campaign to hold
power dominated the run-up to the new
Congress.
In private, Gingrich has been quoted as
sharply criticizing Democrats for pushing
ethics charges against him. In nationally
televised remarks after taking the speaker's
gavel, he was contrite and conciliatory.
"Let me say to the entire House that two

years ago, when I became the first Republi
can speaker in 40 years, to the degree I was
too brash, too self-confident or too pushy, I
apologize.
"To whatever degree, in any way that I
brought controversy or inappropriate atten
tion to the House, I apologize. It is my inten
tion to do everything I can to work with
every member of this Congress."
With his wife, Marianne, and his mother
watching from a packed visitors' gallery, he
returned to the subject a few moments later
when he thanked Republicans who had
voted for him.
"Some of this difficulty, frankly, I
brought on myself. We will deal with that in
more detail later. And I apologize to the
House and the country for having done so,"
he said.
Despite his victory, Gingrich is a dimin
ished presence from two years ago. Then, he
had led his party to power for the first time
in 40 years on a platform of less government
and lower taxes, and he marched the House
through the "Contract With America"in
100 hectic days. Two years of controversy —
including government shutdowns — have
taken their toll, though, so much so that he
is remarkably unpopular in public opinion
polls. And with the ethics case still unre
solved, some of his own rank and file decid
ed not to support his re-election as speaker.
While some Democrats applauded Gin
grich when he mounted the speaker's ros
trum, others were far more combative.
