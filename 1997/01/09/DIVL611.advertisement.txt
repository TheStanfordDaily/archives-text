meet me every Tuesday night at 5:30
p.m. at the Post Office for our weekly
night run. . January is time to kick
start your exercise routine, and
start shaping up for Spring Break.
Some local options: run the Dish, scale

Footnotes
Perhaps there's a pair of worn
out athletic shoes in your closet
that deserves an honorable retire
ment The duct tape-encrusted high tops you wore
the first time you stuck big brother's jumper back in
his face, the running shoes that carried you over the
river and through the woods for months on end with
out a whimper —those puppies deserve more than
the usual Dumpster burial.

DOING 1T...
Recently, while sitting around the dinner table with
some of his Wilbur dormmates, a light bulb went
on in Ward Bullard's head.
was, what kind of team could Bullard <; >d • 7 1- e'ds
start here on the farm' B < aras Im- ' ' r bv\ • g
In high school, Bu I lard played basketbal soccer,
tennis and golf, among other sports WHer he , ; nd
his friends would get bored they wot d go t ov. mg.
It turns out, Bullard's expe en e was not un }ut
Ward began asking around campus seemingly
everyone had tried bowling at Seast once and
thought it was fun to play
Ward also discovered that Stanford used to have a bowling team 4ye ir ago ' ten pri,
ticed on lanes that were located in the first floor of Tresiddet Over the years students st pped
taking care of the lanes and the team disappeared. (1 he lanes st' exist at the t
now Polio Rey's restaurant.)
Now, Ward is trying to revive this long-lost Stanford sport Forming a team has not been easy
Bowling will not be recognized as a club sport until next quarter and funding sow 'he young
team, all of whom are freshmen, are competing against players who received college bowling
scholarships and competed throughout high school.
Yet, team spirits are high. Their goai is to go to the National Tournament by the time they
are seniors Bullard has been the ringleader in a real team effort to have fun and to make a
mark on the Stanford sports scene.
NIKE's Reuse-a-Shoe campaign gives you that
chance. Each year, NIKE collects more than a million pairs
of shoes at retail outlets, community centers —and col
lege campuses—across the country. The shoes then are
ground into materials that can be used to construct run
ning tracks, basketball and tennis courts. The program
keeps tons of matter out of our nation s landfills. It also
provides a fitting way to pay homage.
Watch this space for details about where to find Reuse
a-Shoe collection canisters around campus this spring.
