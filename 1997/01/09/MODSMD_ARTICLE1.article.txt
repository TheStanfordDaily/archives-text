## Faculty to discuss grad student plan 
### David Stein Staff writer 
The ins and outs of the Stanford
Graduate Fellowship program — a
plan designed to attract some of the
nation's top doctoral students —
will be explained at the Faculty Sen
ate meeting today.
Last May, University President
Gerhard Casper announced the pro
gram, which will ofTer 100 three
year doctoral fellowships each year

beginning in the 1997-98 school year. The fellowships
will provide graduate students with a tuition voucher
for $12,000 and a stipend of $16,000.
The money for the first two years of the fellowships
will come from presidential funds. The plan is to raise
$200 million as an endowment for subsequent years.
In addition to attracting the very best graduate stu
dents, the program was initiated to help reduce Stan
ford's dependence on federally funded research assist
antships, which have been declining in recent years.
According to Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy Tom
Wasow, who will be addressing the senate along with
Dean of Research Charles Kruger, today's presenta
tion should help faculty understand how the program
will be implemented.
Although Wasow said the program has been met
with campus-wide enthusiasm, he added that he ex
pects some concerns to be raised by faculty over how
the fellowships will be allocated and to whom they will
be given.
Last summer, the steering committee in charge of
the program told each department how many of the
150 allocated nominations it would be allowed. This
number was based on the departments' dependence on
federal money and the size of their doctoral programs.
Nominations for recipients of the fellowships,
which will be made by individual departments rather
than by a central bureaucracy, are due in late Febru
ary, and the awards will be allocated in early March.

Wasow said he anticipates some
questions regarding the formula
used to determine the allocations
of nominations, as well as why sci
ence and engineering depart
ments, rather than the humani
ties, are receiving the bulk of the
fellowships.
According to a memo sent by

the senate's Steering Committee
to deans and department chairs
last June, science and engineering
units have more uncertain funding
than humanities departments due
to their reliance on federal funds.
Wasow said he hopes the presen
tation will clarify these concerns,
as well as the issue of graduate tu
ition remission, a federal subsidy
for graduate education which has
been slashed for about the past five
years.
Wasow said the fellowship pro

gram and the tuition remission
cutbacks are two separate issues.
Although the fellowships were
established to help ease the finan
cial burden of lowered federal
funding, the tuition remission
issue "was certainly not the sole
reason," Wasow said.
Nevertheless, Wasow antici
pates an overall positive reaction.
"This program, unlike most
things we do in administration, has
been uncontroversial," Wasow
said.

In addition to hearing the pre
sentation on the graduate fellow
ships, the senate will hear a report
on the Overseas Studies Program
by Director Russell Berman.
According to Berman, the report
will call for faculty to submit appli
cations to teach at one of the pro
gram's overseas campuses for the
1998-99 academic year and to re
mind them of the importance of the
program's addition of "an interna
tional component to [undergradu
ate] education."
