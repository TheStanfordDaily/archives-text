## Faculty to discuss grad student plan 
### David Stein Staff writer 
The ins and outs of the Stanford
Graduate Fellowship program — a
plan designed to attract some of the
nation's top doctoral students —
will be explained at the Faculty Sen
ate meeting today.
Last May, University President
Gerhard Casper announced the pro
gram, which will ofTer 100 three
year doctoral fellowships each year

beginning in the 1997-98 school year. The fellowships
will provide graduate students with a tuition voucher
for $12,000 and a stipend of $16,000.
The money for the first two years of the fellowships
will come from presidential funds. The plan is to raise
$200 million as an endowment for subsequent years.
In addition to attracting the very best graduate stu
dents, the program was initiated to help reduce Stan
ford's dependence on federally funded research assist
antships, which have been declining in recent years.
According to Assoc. Dean of Graduate Policy Tom
Wasow, who will be addressing the senate along with
Dean of Research Charles Kruger, today's presenta
tion should help faculty understand how the program
will be implemented.
Although Wasow said the program has been met
with campus-wide enthusiasm, he added that he ex
pects some concerns to be raised by faculty over how
the fellowships will be allocated and to whom they will
be given.
Last summer, the steering committee in charge of
the program told each department how many of the
150 allocated nominations it would be allowed. This
number was based on the departments' dependence on
federal money and the size of their doctoral programs.
Nominations for recipients of the fellowships,
which will be made by individual departments rather
than by a central bureaucracy, are due in late Febru
ary, and the awards will be allocated in early March.
