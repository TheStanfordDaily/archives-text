## Talks deteriorate Mideast peace may be endangered 
### 
; JERUSALEM (AP) - With
talks on Israel's pullout from the
tyest Bank at an angry impasse,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanjahu warned against any
aew Palestinian violence, saying
yesterday it would destroy the
peace process.
A livid Yasser Arafat rejected
tflie latest Israeli offer to pull out by
1998, accusing Netanyahu of
endangering a fragile peace by not
honoring prior Israeli agreements.
A Palestinian official said the dete
rioration of talks made anti-Israeli
violence a possibility.
"The talks have hit a serious cri
sis," Arafat spokesman Nabil
Abourdeneh told the Voice of Pales
tine radio station. "The Israelis are
threatening the peace process by
making such proposals."
Palestinian Cabinet minister
Imad Falouji said Israel would
"pay a very heavy price" for the
stalled peacemaking. New attacks
on Israeli targets were "highly pos
sible," said Falouji, a former
spokesman for the militant group
Hamas.
That could kill the peace pro
cess, Netanyahu warned, noting
that throughout Israel's history
there were cases where "terrorism
. . . led to political and security
deterioration and to war.
"A flare-up of terrorism ... can
cancel out all or most of the
achievements that we have made
in the peace process and lead to a
deterioration in the opposite direc
tion," he said.

After talks with U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross, Netanyahu blamed
the Palestinians for the crisis. "If
the Palestinians want to end the
negotiations, we will. If not, we
have patience," he said.
Ross met with Arafat late Tues
day for talks described by a Pales
tinian spokesman as "extremely
tense."
Ross has been trying to arrange
another Arafat-Netanyahu sum
mit — one was held secretly Sun
day night — to conclude agreement
on withdrawal from Hebron — the
last West Bank city under Israeli
occupation — and rural areas of
the West Bank.
Israeli news media reports said
despite the negative statements,
there were still chances for a sum
mit soon.
U.S. officials said Ross was
making a daily assessment of
whether to continue his efforts.
Although Israel and the Pales
tinians have agreed on the details
of a Hebron pullout, signing has
been delayed over a timetable for
Israel's withdrawal from other
parts of the West Bank.
The dispute is connected to
maneuvering by both sides in
advance of talks on a final settle
ment.
Those talks are to be completed
by 1999, and Palestinians want to
have most of the West Bank under
their autonomy government well
before then — believing this will
assure the creation of a Palestinian
state there.
