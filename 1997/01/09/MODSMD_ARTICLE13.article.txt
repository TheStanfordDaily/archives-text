# Court wary of assisted suicides
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Supreme Court justices reacted
skeptically yesterday to intense
arguments pressing them to give
dying people a right to doctor
assisted suicide. Six of the nine jus
tices voiced doubts about such a
sweeping life-and-death ruling.
"Where should we draw the
line?" Justice Ruth Bader Gins
burg asked as the court was urged
to prevent New York and Wash
ington state from imposing assist
ed-suicide bans.
As do most states, both make it
a crime for doctors to give Life-end
ing drugs to terminally ill patients
who no longer want to live.
"Is this a proper question for
courts as opposed to legislators?"
Ginsburg asked. Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy added: "You're asking
us, in effect, to declare unconstitu
tional the laws of 50 states."
The court's ruling, expected by
July, will have an enormous impact
on the continuing national debate.
Whatever the justices rule, howev
er, will be far from the last word.
Hundreds of demonstrators on
both sides paraded in frigid weath
er outside the building as the jus
tices focused on the most closely
watched and profoundly emotional
issue before them since 1992,
when the court reaffirmed the con
stitutional right to abortion.
Former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop told fellow demon
strators, "It is a tragic commen

tary on our society when we talk
about the right to assisted suicide
and we don't have a right to health
care."
Hemlock Society members had
their own sign: "We support physi
cian aid in dying."
Terminal illness is an issue that
touches all American families —
indeed one that Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist confronted
when his wife, Natalie, died in
1991 after a long battle with ovari
an cancer.
Even if the court should rule
that no such constitutional right
exists, states might be free to enact
measures allowing doctor-assisted
suicide. Oregon already has done
so, but that referendum vote still is
tied up in litigation.
After yesterday's arguments,
Sens. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and
John Ashcroft, R-Mo., announced
plans to introduce legislation to
keep federal funds from being used
to pay for or promote doctor-assist
ed suicides.
They said a law is needed
because Oregon health officials
intend to use federal Medicaid
funds to pay for such suicides as
"comfort care."
Representing doctors who chal
lenged the New York law, Harvard
Law Prof. Laurence Tribe said the
terminally ill have a right "to
decide this amount of agony is
enough .. . not to be a creature of
the state but to have some voice."
