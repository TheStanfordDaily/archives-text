NIS, Yugoslavia (AP) — Weeks
of street protests and internation
al arm-twisting wrung a key con
cession yesterday from Serbia's
ruling party: It acknowledged that
opposition candidates won elec
tions in Nis, the republic's second
largest city.
courts had iinnun«mov. 17 oppo
sition! victories in Belgrade, Nis
and 12 other municipalities,
sparking the massive daily
protests that have been the
biggest challenge ever to his
authoritarian rule.
In a statement, his Socialist
government conceded Nis (pro
nounced Neesh) and said that
those who blocked the rightful
winners should be punished.
It was unclear exactly when
and how Milosevic would turn
control of Nis over to opposition
politicians. Nevertheless, the
statement represented a painful
concession for Milosevic, who has
withstood pressure at home and
abroad for nearly two months.
The victory could mean that
Milosevic would lose his iron grip
on the news media; opposition
politicians have vowed to open up
independent media outlets in the
cities they controls.
Still, it wasn't enough for oppo
sition leaders, who said demon
strations would continue until the
president recognizes all victories.
"Let me ask you. If Milosevic
stole $10,000 from you and after
50 days gave back $6,000, would
you be satisfied?" asked Vuk
Draskovic, an opposition leader.
