Texaco takes action
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Texaco fired one
executive, kept another on suspension and
dropped benefits for two retirees yesterday for
their secretly recorded comments degrading
minorities and suggesting lawsuit documents be
destroyed.
The retirees include Richard Lund wall, the
executive who made the tapes and released them
to plaintiffs in a race-discrimination lawsuit. Tex
aco, facing the threat of a boycott afler the tapes
were made public, quickly settled the case for $ 176
million.
Lundwall is the only Texaco executive charged
so far in a federal investigation into whether docu
ments sought by the plaintiffs were destroyed by
company executives.
The New York Times reported yesterday that
Lundwall is cooperating with investigators. Lund
wall's attorney refused to comment on the news
paper's report. Later, the attorney did not imme
diately return a call about the punishments meted
out by the company.
Yeltsin's health questionable
MOSCOW (AP) â€” A flu-stricken Boris Yeltsin
was taken back to the hospital yesterday with
what the Kremlin called signs of pneumonia, rais
ing new concerns about the president's recovery
from heart surgery.
The president will remain at the Kremlin hos
pital several days, his press service said in a terse
statement that gave little insight into the 65-year
old's condition.
The late-night return to the Central Clinical
Hospital is sure to prompt new questions about
whether Yeltsin is healthy enough to actively rule
Russia It also will likely renew cnes from his
opponents that he is unfit and should step down.
