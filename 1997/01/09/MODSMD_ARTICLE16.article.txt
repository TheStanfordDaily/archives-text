Stanford should apply
for funds to build a new
Chinese studies center

IMAGINE THAT A friend at
Stanford won the Publishers
Clearing House sweepstakes.
Then imagine if he or she turned
the money down because of the
notoriety and attention associated
with the millions.
A similar problem is facing the
scholars of Chinese studies at four
major American universities. Last
year, the Chiang Ching-kuo Foun
dation said it would help establish a
program center dedicated to the
study of Chinese culture at a major
American university that submits,
in its opinion, the most attractive
proposal.
Some professors have expressed
reservations about accepting the
money, the specific dollar amount
of which is still unknown but by all
accounts is "substantial." It is not
that the Chiang Ching-kuo Foun
dation has a poor track record or
supports controversial projects.
Rather, some have raised questions
over the requirement that the cen
ter be named after Chiang Ching
kuo, the former president of Tai
wan and head of its old secret police
force. For the most part, these con
cerns should not stop the Universi
ty from applying for or accepting
the grant, should Stanford be
named the winner.
Daniel Okimoto, director of the
Asia / Pacific Research Center, said
naming any building or program
after a political figure could be
problematic. The stiff opposition
against putting the Reagan Library
here about a decade ago was one of
the examples he cited. The money
could compromise academic credi
bility or alienate powerful con
stituencies.
Peter Duus, director of the Cen
ter for East Asia Studies, is in
charge of drawing up the proposal
for the foundation. Even with the
possible difficulties, the benefit of

having a Chinese studies center on
campus would bolster Stanford's
position as one of the pre-eminent
institutions for the study of Asian
cultures this side of the Pacific.
And while the money and sup
port are real, the supposed detrac
tions are not as great as some
media have played them out to be.
In a time of continuing budget dif
ficulties for academics, it is vital
the University pursue other
avenues of funding and support
for programs and not let partisan
politics or personal prejudices
obscure the true goal of the grant
â€” to further the research of Chi
nese culture for the benefit of
American universities.
Other concerns have also been
raised on the subject of accepting
money from the foundation. Would
it make the University increasingly
dependent on Asian funds? Would
it jeopardize efforts to establish an
overseas program in Beijing? Does
the grant have any other conditions
that might compromise the aca
demic integrity of the program it
was helping to establish?
First, the foundation has
already made substantial contri
butions to Stanford from
research grants to scholarships.
Second, Michel Oksenberg, a
leading expert on Sino-American
relations, said Chiang was an
advocate of eventual reunifica
tion, a critical point of contention
with the current Taiwanese
regime, which favors indepen
dence. Oksenberg said he was not
concerned about retaliation nor
was he worried about the grow
ing "dependence" of American
institutions on foreign contribu
tions, noting the grant in itself is
not enough to fund a center.
Of course the University should
always uphold the academic free
dom and integrity of the faculty by
making those terms clear in any
proposal. However, if the name is
the only unpalatable part of the
deal, the University should be
happy, if not eager, to accept the
money.
