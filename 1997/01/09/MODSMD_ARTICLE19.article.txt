## To the weaker ones among us 
### 
EACH ONE OF us deals with and
doles out an amazing amount of
abuses, big and small. Snubbing
the person who looks at you in the
street, snapping at your well-meaning
but slightly annoying parent, verbal
and physical gay bashing (which hap
pens quite often on this campus), verbal
conservative and liberal bashing (I hate
those categories), or just speaking
harshly to the kind friend upstairs who
brings you tea when you're feeling over
worked or sick (that kind friend would
be me).
We've all been on both sides of the
picture, so we all know how both sides
feel. The abuser: powerful. The abused:
weak. The abuser: righteous. The
abused: wrong. The funniest (weird, not
ha-ha) thing is that none of those emo
tions necessarily reflect the true nature
of the relationship between the people
involved.
I am reminded of an oh-so-slightly
abusive friendship I had at my boarding
high school. As per my pattern, I some
how ended up spending large amounts
of time with a particular person who
could best be described as interesting
change personified. We hung out so
often that we swapped parts of our per
sonalities. Eventually we were so close
that we didn't need to speak. We would
just glare at mutual enemies and nod
knowingly at each other. It was great.
When we were closest was about the
time when the abuse started. Suddenly
everything I said was stupid and uno

riginal. My friend told me so in his
actions and in the tone of voice he used
whenever he spoke to me. I knew that I
was in a bad situation. So I applied my
own force. I started to wear all black
and go for long walks on the trails
behind the school with a dirty dog
named Jupiter who'd follow me any
where. I'd talk to Jupiter about how
miserable I was and wipe my tears on
the sleeves of my black gabardine coat.
Yes, I was melodramatic, but I was also
15.
At dinner time, I returned to the
main part of campus, solitary and
proud, because I had created my own
situation, for once. The walks I took
had returned me to my original state.
I'd essentially reverted to the same per
son I'd been before my friend and I had
become attached at the hip.
It was then, and only then, that the
abuse stopped. Only after I became once
again firm in my identity could the rela
tionship continue. Because when it
really got down to it, it was I who was
the driving force of the relationship. It
was only after I'd lost my personal
power that the relationship died. And
only after I'd gained it back again that
the relationship came back to life. I'd
been the powerful one all along, it had
been myself who'd been abusing me.
Most of the meanness I'd seen had been
strictly imaginary. Jupiter taught me
that.
Now that we are back from break, we
can all see the changes that have hap

pened in the friendships that began last
quarter. They are either stronger or
weaker. Doubtful that they have
remained the same.
For those of you out there who have
watched the slow demise of your friend
ships and ioverships since the fall, here
is my advice to you: give up. Just give
up.
Take a walk with a dirty dog. Take
some time alone to think about what it
is you are feeling and what it is that you
are transmitting outwards and inwards.
And while you do that, take some time
to yourself. Go see a good movie (I sug
gest "Shine"). Have a conversation with
someone you haven't spoken to in a
while and talk about something unre
lated to what you are thinking about.
You're feeling abused because you
are either underappreciated, or you are
overappreciating yourself, and both of
those feelings are bad for your psyche.
It's a new quarter now; it's a new year.
You don't need to feel like you are being
mistreated. You don't need to feel like
anyone's glaring at you. Why be on the
weak side when you can be the master?
Take some control for goodness sake!
Then get back to me.

Nkomo likes to give advice that she
can't follow.
