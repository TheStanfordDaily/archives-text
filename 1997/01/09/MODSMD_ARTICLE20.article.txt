U.S. News & World Report rankings: Who even cares ?

THE UPROAR OVER the U.S.
News & World Report's college
rankings mystifies me. I sincerely
hope that ASSU funds were not squan
dered to send ASSU Vice President Nick
Thompson and his cohorts to Washing
ton D.C. in order to whine to the maga
zine's editors.
U.S. News is entitled to print its opin
ion and data analysis just as The National
Enquirer is entitled to print stories of
UFO abductions. If you don't like what
they print, don't buy their magazine. The
reality is that the rankings only serve to
give bragging rights to those students who

happen to attend the top-ranked schools. I
would hope that Stanford students have
enough pride and self-esteem not to need
external validation of their academic
prowess from a magazine which is hardly
the epitome of intellectual thought.
Some might argue that the U.S. News
rankings have great influence on poten
tial applicants to Stanford and that
Stanford's drop in rank might greatly
reduce the size and quality of the appli
cant pool in a given year.
Does Stanford really want students
who decide to apply to a given school
based on its U.S. News ranking? What

kind of students are these? Probably the
grade-grubbing, back-slapping, small
minded variety. If a ranking in a maga
zine is all these people consider when
making an important, life-influencing
decision, then good riddance. Stanford is
better off without them.
Some might also argue that a drop in
ranking might devalue the degree for
which they paid so much money and sac
rificed their social lives. Do you really
think that the admissions board of any
medical, business, law, or graduate
school pays attention to what U.S. News
thinks of Stanford? Or any employer? A

university's academic reputation is
based upon the quality of its faculty and
their students and upon the quality of
the work performed there, not upon the
ranking given by some news rag.
The bottom line is that the only peo
ple who pay attention to the rankings
are those who don't know any better.
My suggestion to the ASSU would be to
toss the U.S. News in the trash and
spend our money and their time on more
worthwhile efforts.
