# Stanford should not construct buildings that endanger health
## 
### 
I do not understand this school. They
construct a new building (Gilbert Biolog
ical Sciences Building). It looks great.
It's spacious. Yet it has a nice little sign
that states: "State law requires that we
inform you the building has chemicals
that are known to produce cancer and
birth defects." So I am stuck in this
building for a whole quarter because I
am taking a class there. I like my class

but getting cancer and defective kids
later on just so I learn about macro? I do
not need to write five pages on this issue
to explain there is something wrong
with this picture.
