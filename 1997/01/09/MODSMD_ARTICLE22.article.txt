# Judicial penalities spell disaster for students
## 
### 
I'm writing to correct Michael Clarke
(Monday's Letters) about the penalties
Stanford can levy against students it
finds guilty through its judicial process.
He says that he might still be in favor of

the present necessary burden of proof if
the University could impose fines. I'd
like to point out that getting a mark on
your academic record branding you as a
cheater / liar / sexual predator or getting
expelled is in effect a $30,000 to
$120,000 fine, depending on when it
happens. It renders all money that the
"convict" has paid to Stanford and on
related living expenses a virtual waste.
I'm not sure I have a problem with
the burden of proof being lowered. I
think Clarke raised many other excel
lent points in favor of a weaker stan
dard.
But let's not pretend that Stanford's
censure isn't a personal and financial

curse. Chances of medical school, busi
ness school, law school and doctoral
programs fly out the door forever after
such a mark on a promising student's
Stanford transcript. The student's
prospects may quite literally go from
U.S. senator, scientist or Fortune 500
business executive to flipping burgers.
A person's reputation may be worth
more than anything else they possess.
Let's not forget this when considering
the amount of proof we require to take
away someone's good name and invali
date their Stanford degree. Melodra
matic? Who wants to hire a cheater?
