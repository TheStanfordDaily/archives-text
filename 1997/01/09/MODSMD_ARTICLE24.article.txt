## Institute for International Studies to gather its forces in Encina Hall 
### Robert Chiles Contributing writer 
The Institute for Interna
tional Studies, after seven
years as a coalition of frag
mented departments, will soon
be given its own space in Enci
na Hall East.
The project necessitates a
renovation of the east and cen
tral portions of Encina Hall.
The new office will unite the
institute with all of its affili
ates, including the Asia / Pacif
ic Research Center, the Center
for European Studies, the
Global Environment Forum,
the North America Forum, the
Center for International Secu
rity and Arms Control, the In
ternational Political Economy
Forum and the Stanford Com
puter Industry Project.
"We're enthusiastic about
this opportunity," said Insti
tute Director Walter Falcon.
"We expect construction to
begin on the east wing in
spring, perhaps April. We hope
it will [all] be completed by
September."
The cost of the renovation is
estimated at $14.4 million. Of
that total, $8.4 million will be
funded by long-term loans to
be paid back by the University.
The institute — which relies fi
nancially on the government,

foundations and private
sources — will be responsible
for the remaining $6 million.
Already, the institute has re
ceived a $5 million donation
from the Stephen Bechtel Jr.
family.
Currently, the institute is
located at seven locations
around campus including
Encina Hall, Encina Com
mons, Littlefield Center, the
Wilbur modules and Galvez
House.
Falcon said the institute is
increasingly working on pro
jects that cross existing bound
aries between its various de
partments. Examples include
ethnic conflict in the former
Soviet Union and the use of
soft coal in China.
The current arrangement
"doesn't provide for cost-effec
tive management, and it
doesn't facilitate the inter
change of ideas," said Falcon.
"Bringing us together will
make work on a number of is
sues much easier."
The institute prides itself on
reaching solutions to interna
tional problems through bring
ing together faculty and stu
dents from a variety of disci
plines. It maintains outreach
and honors programs while ad
ministrating overseas opera
tions.
