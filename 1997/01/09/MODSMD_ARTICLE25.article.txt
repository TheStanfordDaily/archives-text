## Women gymnasts ready for intense 1997 season 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The 1997 season will be a key year for Stan
ford women's gymnastics.
A me"*t against No. 3 Georgia tomorrow will
mark the start of an exciting and intense season
for the Cardinal.
According to coach Lisa Izzi, based on last
year's outstanding finish and the strength of

this year's team, the Cardinal members are
"feeling comfortable with the idea of being at
nationals again this year" and will try to break
into the Super Six. The Super Six is the biggest
competition which is held immediately following
the team preliminaries at the NCAA Champi
onship, in which the Stanford squad placed
ninth last year.
It was the first Cardinal trip to the NCAAs; last
year's roster produced the highest achievement in
the history of Stanford women's gymnastics.
The current squad is in good form and ready
for its tough schedule. It will face serious com
petition from all of the schools in the Pacific 10
Conference, the most vigorous of all leagues in
the country. The Stanford team is also sched
uled to meet with other prestigious squads
nationwide including Utah and the University
of Denver.
As the season draws near, high expectations
as well as much excitement surround the talent
ed and young Cardinal team of 12, up three from
last year's nine members.
The squad this year must face the task of fill
ing in vacant spots on the team left by last year's
two captains as well as junior Misty Moore,
whose back injury forced the skilled team leader
to retire last season. (Moore is now the Cardinal
undergraduate assistant.)
However, this job will not prove difficult —
sophomore star Amy Murakami and gifted
junior Keri Monahan, who finished first and sec
ond respectively in the all-around category at the
NCAA West Regionals, constitute the core of the
team, and the Card has acquired five talented
freshmen.
"This class is probably one of the most talent
ed and motivated freshman squads we've ever
had," Izzi said. "They have a very high level of
energy at practice. In a sense, they lifted the
team — there is a little more competition in the
gym and as far as team dynamics, they have def
initely pulled everyone together."
Older members of the Card agree that the
new faces will be significant contributors to the
1997 season.
"The freshmen definitely are a godsend," said
sophomore Katie Fitzpatrick, who marked one of
the highest team scores on the beam and bar
events last season.
According to Fitzpatrick, even though the
freshmen "may not be physically contributing all
the time," they provide other team members
wjtjfy objective advice and encourage them with
their "freshman spunk."
"They are really into it, they are a lot of fun,
and they aren't afraid of anything," said sopho
more Tracey Kohl, who holds the second highest
individual record on floor exercise in Stanford
history.
Despite the amazing amount of individual tal
ent, a strong sense of team spirit may be the
Card's strongest weapon.
"Until I got to college, I'd never competed on
a team," Kohl said. Kohl, like most serious gym
nasts, was not able to compete on a high school
varsity team due to the intensity of the 30 to 40
hours of training a week that club gymnastics
required.
"Before college, it was a lot more for you,"
Fitzpatrick said. "In collegiate gymnastics, it is
for the team. How well you do is not as impor
tant as team effort. We all have individual goals
like being an All-American or making the lineup,
but the team supersedes all. You reallv want to

share [victory] with the people
you worked hard with all year."
This sense of collective effort

is symbolized in Izzi's coaching;
she places emphasis on the
squad as a whole and does not
set individual goals for each
gymnast.
"We consider (individual
goals] as outcome goals," Izzi
said. "We focus on process goals.

If you reach all of your process
goals, you are likely to have good
outcomes. We think of the sea
son as a whole process."
With the extraordinary talent
and spirited mindset each gym
nast possesses, this year's Cardi
nal squad will go far.
