# Men's hoops hosts UCLA
## Tonight's game the first at home with students 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Cancel your dinner plans,
folks, dig that season pass out of
your desk drawer and pull on
your new Sixth Man Club T-shirt
— the Bruins are in town, and
the show starts early.
Recruiting scandals, an
untimely head coaching change
and a rash of embarrassing early
season losses notwithstanding,
the unranked UCLA Bruins (7-3,
2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) roll
into Maples Pavilion for
tonight's 5:30 p.m. showdown
against No. 21 Stanford (8-2, 1-1)
still regarded by many as the
favorite for the Pac-10 title.
Tipoff has been moved back
from the usual 7:30 p.m. starting
time in order to accommodate
television (the game will be
shown live on f/x, STV Channel
45J, and Cardinal fans will have
to arrive early to assure them
selves good seating for what
could be the single most-antici
pated game on Stanford's home
schedule.
"UCLA's always a big game.
It's one of those teams you [real
ly] want to beat, like Arizona,"
said senior forward Rich Jack
son. "The last four games we've
played have been four-, six-, two
point games, so there's a rivalry
there, and I think they respect us
more now."
With Stanford's only two pre
vious home games (Navy and
Alaska-Anchorage) taking place
while students were away for
winter break, tonight's matchup
will give basketball-starved Sixth
Man types their first chance to
see the Cardinal in regular-sea
son action. Last year, an overflow
Maples Pavilion crowd helped
spark Stanford to a dramatic 67-
66 victory over the then-defend
ing national champs.
"It's such a big home-court
advantage," Jackson said. "I
think [Stanford is] probably one
of the hardest places to play in
the. Phh-K) — n-.nyhp Ari
zona and Oregon."
UCLA began the season
ranked No. 5 but opened with a
loss to Tulsa and later suffered
humiliating defeats to Kansas
and Illinois, leading some to
question the team's heart and
others to criticize its free-form,
playground-stvle offense.
But the Bruins have been
here before. They recovered
from a similarly slow start last
year to win a second consecutive
Pac-10 title in convincing fash
ion. (UCLA was 16-2 in confer
ence play.) And under the guid
ance of Steve Lavin, who took
over Nov. 6 following the ugly
dismissal of former head coach
Jim Harrick, the Bruins have
regained their feet. A 84-56
skewering of Washington State
and a 79-70 win over Washing

Sophomore shooting guard Kris Weems goes for the layup in Stan
ford's last home game against Navy. Tonight, the Cardinal hosts the
UCLA Bruins in Maples Pavilion at 5:30 p.m.
ton last weekend served notice to
the rest of the Pac-10 that this
team isn't going away.
"UCLA's tough because all five
of their starters are capable of
scoring, of taking you one-on
one," said sophomore center Tim
Young. "I guess the key with
them is just getting back on tran
sition, because they're good ath
letes and they run the floor really
well."
"Good athletes" is an under
statement. UCLA boasts the best
foursome in the nation in sopho
more center Jelani McCoy — a
6-foot-9 shot-blocking man
child — juniors Toby Bailey and
J.R. Henderson, and senior
Charles O'Bannon. Much
maligned point guard Cameron
Dollar has been dropped from
the starting lineup in favor of
junior Kris Johnson, but it
doesn't matter much who the
ringleader is in this high-flying,

slam-dunking floor show — the
Bruins are at their best in the
open court.
"The transition defense is
going to be important against
UCLA," Jackson echoed. "They
get out so fast — whoever gets it
is gonna run out, so we've got to
get three people back every time
and make sure our post guys are
close behind."
Stanford, coming off a heart
breaking 76-75 loss to Arizona
last Saturday in Tucson, needs a
win tonight to maintain its
foothold among the leaders in the
dog-eat-dog Pac-10 Conference
race.
"We need to win at home to
have shot at the title," Jackson
said. "Coach Montgomery has
made it a point to emphasize that
we've gotta get two games. We'll
have to see how mature our team
is this week."
The home-court advantage cer
tainly won't hurt. "This will be
the first big game where students
will have a big impact on the out
come," Young said. "We're defi
nitely looking forward to it."
