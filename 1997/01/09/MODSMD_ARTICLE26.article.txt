# Men's hoops hosts UCLA
## Tonight's game the first at home with students 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Cancel your dinner plans,
folks, dig that season pass out of
your desk drawer and pull on
your new Sixth Man Club T-shirt
— the Bruins are in town, and
the show starts early.
Recruiting scandals, an
untimely head coaching change
and a rash of embarrassing early
season losses notwithstanding,
the unranked UCLA Bruins (7-3,
2-0 Pacific 10 Conference) roll
into Maples Pavilion for
tonight's 5:30 p.m. showdown
against No. 21 Stanford (8-2, 1-1)
still regarded by many as the
favorite for the Pac-10 title.
Tipoff has been moved back
from the usual 7:30 p.m. starting
time in order to accommodate
television (the game will be
shown live on f/x, STV Channel
45J, and Cardinal fans will have
to arrive early to assure them
selves good seating for what
could be the single most-antici
pated game on Stanford's home
schedule.
"UCLA's always a big game.
It's one of those teams you [real
ly] want to beat, like Arizona,"
said senior forward Rich Jack
son. "The last four games we've
played have been four-, six-, two
point games, so there's a rivalry
there, and I think they respect us
more now."
With Stanford's only two pre
vious home games (Navy and
Alaska-Anchorage) taking place
while students were away for
winter break, tonight's matchup
will give basketball-starved Sixth
Man types their first chance to
see the Cardinal in regular-sea
son action. Last year, an overflow
Maples Pavilion crowd helped
spark Stanford to a dramatic 67-
66 victory over the then-defend
ing national champs.
"It's such a big home-court
advantage," Jackson said. "I
think [Stanford is] probably one
of the hardest places to play in
the. Phh-K) — n-.nyhp Ari
zona and Oregon."
UCLA began the season
ranked No. 5 but opened with a
loss to Tulsa and later suffered
humiliating defeats to Kansas
and Illinois, leading some to
question the team's heart and
others to criticize its free-form,
playground-stvle offense.
But the Bruins have been
here before. They recovered
from a similarly slow start last
year to win a second consecutive
Pac-10 title in convincing fash
ion. (UCLA was 16-2 in confer
ence play.) And under the guid
ance of Steve Lavin, who took
over Nov. 6 following the ugly
dismissal of former head coach
Jim Harrick, the Bruins have
regained their feet. A 84-56
skewering of Washington State
and a 79-70 win over Washing
