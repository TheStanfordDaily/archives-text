# Busy weekend
## Wrestlers take to the mat 
### John Sullivan Staff writer 
* Tomorrow at 5:30 p.m. in Ford Center,
Stanford wrestling will have its hands full
with perennial wrestling power Fresno
State, which brings three top-15 wrestlers
to the mat.
1 The next day, Stanford will travel to UC-
Davis to compete in the Aggie Open. It
remains to be seen how challenging the
tournament at Davis will be for the Cardi
nal, as anyone out of high school is free to
enter.
Before going to battle at the Aggie Open,
Stanford will have to overcome the tough
challenge of Fresno State (4-2 in dual meets),
whose two losses came in a heartbreaker
against No. 5 Penn State and in a closely
fought match against No. 2 Oklahoma.
In the Las Vegas Invitational, Fresno
took sixth place overall in a field of 45
trains, where they had four placewinners.
By comparison, the Cardinal did not have
a!ny placewinners.
• Leading Fresno's impressive team are
Vero Washington, ranked fifth in the 134-
riound weight class, Nick Zinkin, a top-15

wrestler at 126 pounds, Brendan Buckley,
ranked eighth at 142 pounds, and Darin
Preisendorf, ranked 11th at heavyweight.
"Fresno State is a very tough, very solid
team," said Stanford coach Chris Horpel.
"They have very competitive wrestlers up
and down the lineup."
If history repeats itself Saturday, the
Cardinal can be more certain of success at
the Aggie Open. Last year, Stanford came
home with three champions and eight
placewinners overall. However, since the
tourney is open to all, the competition
could potentially be as stiff as NCAAs or
tougher.
According to Horpel, Stanford's two
major threats at this point in the season
will come from junior Scott Chapman —
who has been wrestling extremely well,
recently earning a third-place finish at the
Midlands Tournament — and Warren
McPherson, who wrestled his way to a
fourth-place finish at the Oregon Classic
last month at 142 pounds.
Horpel attributes Chapman's recent
improvement to his dropping weight, hard
work and overall ability. Chapman has

tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and will travel to UC-Davis for the Aggie Open Saturday.
