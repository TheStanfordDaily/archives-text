At the end of their first quarter, the new year
long courses designed to fulfilled the general edu
cation requirements for technology, science and
math have received mostly positive reviews.
The Engineering, Mathematics and Science
Core is composed of three different tracks, each of
which is a year-long, 12-unit course designed to
fulfill three of the new GERs.
By combining physics, math, chemistry, biolo

gy and technology, the three tracks — "The
Heart," "Light in the Physical and Biological
Worlds" and "Planet Earth: A Survival Guide" —
are interdisciplinary and designed to show "stu
dents how these various topics are interrelated,"
according to Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood, di
rector of the Science Core.
"Both the faculty and students have been
working really hard," Osgood said. "Everyone is
really gung-ho about the program."
Osgood noted that the first term has been a
learning experience for both students and faculty.

Because the courses are team-taught, one of
