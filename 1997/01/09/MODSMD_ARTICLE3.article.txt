# Science Core gets 'A' for first quarter
## 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
At the end of their first quarter, the new year
long courses designed to fulfilled the general edu
cation requirements for technology, science and
math have received mostly positive reviews.
The Engineering, Mathematics and Science
Core is composed of three different tracks, each of
which is a year-long, 12-unit course designed to
fulfill three of the new GERs.
By combining physics, math, chemistry, biolo

gy and technology, the three tracks — "The
Heart," "Light in the Physical and Biological
Worlds" and "Planet Earth: A Survival Guide" —
are interdisciplinary and designed to show "stu
dents how these various topics are interrelated,"
according to Mathematics Prof. Brad Osgood, di
rector of the Science Core.
"Both the faculty and students have been
working really hard," Osgood said. "Everyone is
really gung-ho about the program."
Osgood noted that the first term has been a
learning experience for both students and faculty.

Because the courses are team-taught, one of
the difficult things we had to work on wan pre
senting the different subjects at the right time in
the course," he explained. "Because it is interdis
ciplinary, it was especially difficult at times to
make the students see how the various concepts
are all interrelated."
Students agreed, saying they also see this as a
problem. Samira Taylor, a freshman in the
"Heart" core, explained that the variety of topics
made things unclear at times.
"It does not get in-depth on any
particular thing," Taylor said. "It is
hard to get a good grasp on things
because there is no set reading.
They just throw a lot of reading at
us. They should change the name
from 'Science, Math and Engineer
ing' to 'Every Science and Math We
Could Throw In.' "
Osgood said some of the interdis
ciplinary projects have been highly
successful. lie gave the example of

"Light in the Physical and Biologi
cal Worlds," which he team-teaches.
For the class, students built a
pinhole camera, took pictures of
Hoover Tower, measured the
height of Hoover Tower using their
pictures and created a poster ex
plaining how they had accom
plished the task. In addition, the
students compiled statistics on
their projects.
Some students enjoyed the pro
jects and interdisciplinary approach
and expressed enthusiasm for the
variety of topics covered.
"It is fun and seems like a really
good mix of biology, chemistry and
physics," said freshman Ted

Carstensen, who is in the "Light"
track. "It's also nice to have the
whole GER out of the way."
Carstensen expressed enthusi
asm for the professors as well as for
the effectiveness of a team-taught
course.
"The professors are really eager
to make the core work," he said. "It
is great to have the exposure to all of
the different subjects by the differ
ent professors. This way I can learn
which subjects I am curious to know
more about."
Freshman Jomay Liu, who is in
the "Heart" core, was also enthusi
astic. "I really like that it empha
sizes concepts and principles rather

than hard-core facts," Liu said. "It is
a better way to get rid of all those
[GERsJ that are integrated than to
take random classes here and
there."
Osgood estimates that there are
about 100 students in each of the
Science Core tracks, nearly 80 per
cent of whom are freshman.
"I hope in years to come that we
will see more of a spread of students
in the course and not primarily
freshman," said Osgood.
The program is designed to run
for the next three years with the cur
riculum and professors currently in
volved. Osgood hopes that following
this period the program will grow.
