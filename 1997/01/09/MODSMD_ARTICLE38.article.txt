## Deep Thoughts Mobb Deep welcomes you to hell 
### 
In"The Inferno," Dante warned readers, "Abandon hope all ye
who enter here." On their new album "Hell on Earth," with its flam
ing cover and grim lyrics, Mobb Deep could provide us with the
same warning.
The Queensbridge, New York duo's follow-up to 1994's "The In
famous," is a decidedly dark album, offering raw, somber beats laced
with chilling images of'hood life. There are no tracks here as mem
orable or as catchy as "Shook Ones Pt. II," but Havoc and Prodigy
produce a solid album that will keep true hip-hop fans satisfied.
Mobb Deep's lyrics have matured since the last album. With lines
like, "I'm tired of living life this way / crime pay / but for how long /
until you reach your downfall," the duo become more conscious of
the environment they live in. They explore this theme thoroughly on
the title track, which, incidentally, is the best cut on the album: "The
projects are front lines /1 ain't gotta tell you / it's right before your
eyes."
The production on the album is a bit monotonous, recycling the
same basic drum beats with different melodies and chords. The beats
are consistently gloomy and often sound muddled. On a few tracks,
like "Man Down," the vocals are barely audible over the pounding
drums. Fortunately, this flaw is corrected when Mobb Deep mix up
the tempo and get more creative, using an orchestra-like background
for "G.O.D. pt. III."
A host of guest vocalists, including Nas, Method Man and Raek
won, bring some much-needed variety to the album, which starts off
strong, grows tedious in the middle and then finishes off with all the
best tracks. This album probably won't win Mobb Deep any con
verts, but it won't disappoint the rap fiends either.
