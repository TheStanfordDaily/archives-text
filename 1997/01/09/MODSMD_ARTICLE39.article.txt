# GHOSTFACE KILLAH
## "Ironman" 
### 
Stealthily emerging from the under
ground rap haven known as Shaolin (Staten
Island, N.Y.), Ghostface Killah may have just
re-oriented rap's temporary sense of sanity.
"Ironman" (Razor Sharp / Epic Street), the
debut appearance by the longtime member
of New York rap cartel The Wu-Tang Clan,
has risen to premier status among rap afi
cionados.
Ghostface, like the young Samurai war
riors that are so adulated by members of the
Wu-Tang Clan, follows the elusive teachings
of rap masters Method Man, GZA, Raekwon
and Ol' Dirty Bastard. Indeed, the nearly
gold-certified Ghostface seems to be follow
ing the examples of his heavy-selling rap as
sociates. But Ghostface Killah is best known
for being wary of the spotlight, eager to slip
into the more macabre crevices of the con
sciousness.
RZA, the Wu-Tang pioneer of hip-hop
creativity, is once again the producer of this
posse production. "Ironman" may be RZA's
most crafty musical creation to date, and

Ghostface Killah merely complements his
thick use of '70s soul and nonchalant beats.
"Camay," a sublime dedication to a Ghostface
crush, steadily cruises over a laid-back Teddy
Pendergrass sample.
Ghostface reveals his smooth demeanor:
"Have a seat, complimentary drinks is on me
/ Bartender ... Chivale Chateau at table three
... luxurious rings, eyes sparkling."
Recombining elements like a savvy
chemist, "Ironman" embraces the smooth
flowing influences of R&B performers past
and present. "After the Smoke is Clear" fea
tures a cameo by soul crooners The Del
phonics, while "All That I Got is You" shares
the spotlight with the sizzling Mary J. Blige.
And unlike other Wu-Tang Clan produc
tions, "Ironman" avoids using sound clips
from kung fu flicks, opting instead for an
other '70s phenomena: blaxploitation
episodes.
Most amazing is RZA's all-encompassing
use of musical genres, ranging from African
tribal rhythms to Vivaldi oboe. Perhaps it is
this sophistication that has made the Wu-
Tang members the forerunning voices of rap.
Laced with subtle references, Ghostface does
much to cleverly blur his focus; "Ironman"
may take extensive listening before its true
meaning is distilled.
