# ASSU violates its own constitution
## Many new provisions ignored 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
More than six months after
Stanford students approved a new
student government constitution,
the legislative and executive bod
ies of the ASSU have yet to imple
ment many of its changes.
After a full quarter's worth of
senate meetings under the new

constitution, the
ASSU's World
Wide Web site still
contains no refer
ence to the new

document and displays the old, ob
solete version.
Although the Web site may only
be an oversight, it is indicative of
the ASSU's general disinterest in
attending to the more mundane
mandates included in the new doc
ument.
Seventy-one percent of stu
dents voting in last spring's gener
al election approved the new con
stitution — the strongest mandate
issued by the student body in re
cent memory, and certain high
profile changes were immediately
enacted: the transition from a
Council of Presidents to a single
president and vice president, as
well as a reduction in the senate's
size.
Yet senators continue to disre
gard even the most basic require
ments of the new constitution,
such as prompt posting of meeting
minutes.
Students interested in the full
content of senate meetings would
be disappointed to learn that min
utes of all meetings are not avail
able electronically as constitution
ally mandated. Printed versions of
minutes are also uncirculated
The constitution requires min
utes to be provided electronically
within seven days oi a meeting.
ASSU President Bill Snen,
however, does not see cause for
alarm, citing problems as "minor "
"By the end of the year we will
have instituted the wiil of the stu
dents," he said.
Soon after last spring's elec
tion, the senate commissioned a
review of its bylaws — the rules
that govern the dav-to-day opera-

CONSTITUTION VIOLATIONS

• The ASSU's Web site makes
no reference to the new constitu
tion and continues to display the
outdated version; not only are
students unable to read the cur
rent document, but they are pro
vided with outdated, obsolete in
formation in its place.
• The senate and its standing
committees do not post minutes
electronically, preventing stu
dents from learning the outcome
of meetings.
• Standing committees do not
provide agendas electronically,
preventing students from know
ing when issues of concern to
them will be discussed.
• No members of the Constitu
tional Council have been nomi
nated or confirmed, leaving no
means to force compliance with
the constitution.
• The ASSU Bylaws have not
been adjusted to comply with the
new constitution.
tions of the ASSU — to recom
mend changes to bring them into
accordence with the new consti
tion.
ASSU Senator Don Aingworth,
former chair of the senate's Ad
ministration and Rules Commit
tee and current senate chair,
spearheaded the task last spring.
Some changes were made. But
the first set of amendments pro
vided largely cosmetic alterations
such as changing the phrase
"Council of Presidents" to "ASSU
President" where necessary.
When Aingworth became sen
ate chair, he delegated the task to
ASSU Senators Malory Roberts,
Harris Shapiro and Alane Mur
dock.
"I've been very impressed with
the work of [the Administration
and Rules Committee] in moving
toward achieving full compli
ance," Shen said. "They had a
daunting task ahead of them, but
'.I've been inpressed with their per
•formance in what is often a thank
less task."
* The trio has continued to pur
•sue the effort and has even au
thored a series of draft bills. The
senate at large, however, has large
ly ignored the effort, unphased by
]the situation. Most see no pressing
meed to spend their Tuesday nights
•wading through more than 200 by
laws.

The bylaws, however, provide
the operating structure for such
ASSU organs as the Speakers Bu
reau, the Program Board and the
Publications Board.
The senate's five standing com
mittees also rarely comply with
new, constitutional freedom of in
formation provisions.
According to the constitution,
meetings of all committees must
be publicized electronically 72
hours in advance. The constitution
dictates that such publicity must
include the meeting time, place
and agenda; no committee meeting
has been announced with complete
information sufficiently early.

Even Shen's own Executive
Committee — designed to coordi
nate the activities of the ASSU —
does not report minutes.
The one institution able to force
compliance with the new constitu
tion, the Constitutional Council,
does not yet exist. Shen announced
his nominees to the panel at the
final senate meeting last quarter;
he will formally nominate them at
the senate's first meeting of this
quarter, to be held Tuesday.
Confirming them, however, will
be no easy task. There is no exist
ing procedure for seating the first
council, and senators will have to
write a new series of bylaws before

they can begin the process.
As has already been demon
strated, however, the current sen
ate does not generate new bylaws
quickly. And attention will be di
verted from bylaw concerns by
winter quarter funding alloca
tions. The fall quarter installment
of the general-fee funding process
took seven weeks. A number of
mid-quarter meetings will also be
consumed by Shen's "State of the
Association" address — another
new requirement — and question
and-answer sessions with such
University officials as Provost
Condelee/.za Rice and Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais.
