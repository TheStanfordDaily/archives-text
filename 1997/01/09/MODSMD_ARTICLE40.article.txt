# THE
						PAT METHENY GROUP
## "Quartet" 
### 
Fat Metheny has built a reputation for
himself as one of the few respectable fusion
guitarists. With a uniquely personal tone and
impeccable taste, Metheny has spent years at
the forefront of modern jazz.
Still, Metheny's most successful work
often comes when he challenges himself with
older players, such as on "Song X" with Or
nette Coleman or on "Questions and An
swers" with Dave Holland and Roy Haynes.
Thus, an appropriate question might be if
Metheny is indeed a bridge between the ex
perimental jazz of the '60s and current jazz
fusion.
On The Fat Metheny Group's newest
album, "Quartet," (Geffen Records) Metheny
may himself be trying to answer this ques
tion. Stating that his intention was to "make
an album that featured the core of the band
playing music that was either organized and
assembled very quickly and spontaneously .
.. or improvised entirely," Metheny could be

attempting to answer some of the towering
improvisational works of the '60s, such as
Miles Davis' "Bitches Brew."
Unfortunately, however, Metheny's ap
proach is far too reserved and conservative
to be considered a success. While the stylistic
range of the band is impressive, ranging
from the John Cage-like minimalism of
"Dismantling Utopia" to the traditional jazz
quartet setting of "When We Were Free,"
most of the album suffers from a lack of am
bition.
Too often, Metheny is content to allow one
member of the quartet to dominate a track.
The result is a series of disconnected, incon
sequential vignettes, as charming as they are
forgettable.
Nonetheless, The Pat Metheny Group is
still professional and accomplished. From
the grace of "Glacier" to the vibrant pulse ot
"Montevideo," the quartet's experience and
intelligence largely compensate for the
album's overall lack of vision.
Thus, while "Quartet" is inferior to
Metheny's more essential works, the album is
still an impressive testament to the group's
stature, and for a college student who thinks
of Spyro Gyra instead of Duke Ellington
when jazz is brought up, "Quartet" would
undoubtedly be a revelation.
