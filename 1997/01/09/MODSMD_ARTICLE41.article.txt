The elevator is out of order, so they have
to use the stairs. Zoe is worried that
they will be late for the wedding.
"How can we be late?" Kenneth says.
"We're the only guests, besides the minister."
He pauses to consider whether a minister can
be called a guest.
Then he follows Zoe up the stairs, focusing
on the Hash of her ankles revealed by the rise
and fall of her skirt. He lags behind a little be
cause he's carrying the wedding present,
which is a painting. It's an abstract watercol
or that looks like someone went amok with
paint in a prison cell. Kenneth thinks that
even he could do a better job painting the in
side of somebody's bathroom, but when he
told Zoe that, she refused to speak to him for
a day. He wonders ifZoe is still mad at him lor
turning the alarm clock off this morning and
promptly falling asleep.
They have to wait a long time before
Gabriel opens the door of the apartment. Al
though he's wearing suit trousers and a but
ton-down shirt, his collar is twisted and his
hair falls uncombed over his forehead.
"Let me guess," Kenneth says. "Your alarm
didn't go off either."
Gabriel shakes his head as Kenneth and
Zoe move past him into the living room. Ken
neth leans the painting against the wall oppo
site the couch. It is when he notices how still
the air is, how frozen the room looks, that he
realizes something is wrong.
Zoe reaches up and straightens Gabriel's
collar. "Where's Aimee?" she asks.
"She's on the roof."
"On the roof?"
"She won't come down."
Kenneth tries to think of something com
forting to say. "It's probably just nerves. You
know, pre-wedding jitters."
"I don't know what to call it." Gabriel's
voice is taut.
"What you need is a drink," Kenneth says.
Neither Gabriel nor Zoe reply, so Kenneth
goes into the kitchen.
Kenneth believes that you can tell some
one's personality from the contents of their
refrigerator. Today there is only a wilted head
of lettuce and a bottle of Guinness in
Gabriel's; he figures this is a sign that Aimee is
taking over. When he'd first known Gabriel,
there had always been the same three things:
pastrami, onions and beer, like primary col
ors.
Kenneth knows that Zoe likes to tell her
friends that he's a painter. He also knows that
she doesn't specify that he's a house painter,
which he thinks is amusing because they first
met when he painted Gabriel's kitchen last
year. His first day on the job, Gabriel and Zoe
had argued whether the paint color should be
pearl gray or cornflower blue; pearl gray,
Gabriel's choice, won out. Kenneth offered
up no opinion but had watched Zoe's eyes
darken with frustration. Because of the way
they argued he was sure that Gabriel and Zoe

were a couple; they assured him they weren't.
Zoe started dropping by the apartment when
Gabriel wasn't there. She always seemed to
catch Kenneth when he was taking a break, so
it didn't look like he was working at all. He
and Zoe first made love one afternoon when
Gabriel was at work, on his kitchen floor.
When Kenneth returns to the living room,
no one is there. He can hear voices, though,
and he follows them into the bedroom and
then the bathroom. The window is open, and
Zoe and Gabriel are on the fire escape landing
outside. There's only room for two people on
the landing, so Kenneth sits on the win
dowsill. He sticks his head out of the window
and looks up. He thinks that he catches a
glimpse of something white, something that
could be a face or a hand or the edge of a skirt,
before it disappears from the edge of the roof.
No one seems to have seen this except for
him.
"I called half an hour ago and canceled,"
Gabriel is saying.
Kenneth wonders if canceling a minister is
as easy as canceling a doctor's appointment,
and if you're asked if you'd like to reschedule.
"Canceled!" Zoe says. "What did you do
that for?"
"I didn't want him to get here and have to

Gabriel shakes liis head as Kenneth and Zoe
move past him into the living room. Kenneth
leans the painting against the wall opposite
the couch. It is when he notices how still the
air is, how frozen the room looks, that he re
alizes something is wrong.

wait. I didn't want to have to think about that,
on top of everything else."
"How long do you think you'll have to
wait?" Kenneth says. He sticks his head out
the window again and projects loudly to
wards the roof, "She'll come down when she
gets hungry."
Zoe glares at him to let him know that she
doesn't appreciate his sense of humor. Ken
neth gets the feeling that he's being shut out,
as though he's at home and everyone else is
out getting drunk. So he retreats to the living
room and settles himself on the couch with
the bottle of Guinness. He looks at the paint
ing leaning against the wall, shifting a little so
the glare from the glass covering it doesn't get
into his eyes. It's supposed to be from both
himself and Zoe, although Zoe was the one
who spent a weekend on the telephone nego-

tiating with the dealer. She also paid
more for it, which Kenneth thinks is
only fair because she's the one who's
known Gabriel since college. Nei
ther of them have known Aimee for
very long, just a few months.

Kenneth didn't think much of Aimee
when he met her, that night Zoe invited her
and Gabriel over for dinner. She reminded
him of a paper doll, looking like she'd blow

away if you so much as sneezed in her direc
tion. He would never have guessed that
Gabriel and Aimee were engaged just by look
ing at them. Then again, he wondered if his
bearings were generally off when it came to
figuring out the more complex relationships
between people. He didn't even know exactly
how close Gabriel and Zoe were, although he
suspected that something must have gone on
at some point within the 10 years of their
friendship.
Only Kenneth knew the preparations Zoe
went through that evening Gabriel and
Aimee came over for dinner, from ordering
an arrangement of flowers to going down
town twice to change the wine. Ten minutes
before Gabriel and Aimee were due to arrive,
she was looking through her closet for some
thing to wear, tossing half the clothes out in

the process.
"Z," he said; this was what he called her
whenever she had her back arched like a ruf
fled cat, "it's OK. Everything's going to be
OK."
"What if she doesn't like artichokes or
beans? I mean, what if she's some sort of
weird breed of vegetarian who only eats leafy
green vegetables?"
"Then we'll just have the flowers and the
Zinfandel."
Zoe wadded up a silk blouse and threw it at
him, but on second thought, went to retrieve
it. He thought it a good sign that she didn't
twist away when he put his hands around her
waist.
"Don't," she said. "I'm trying to get
dressed."
"I don't want you to get dressed."

"I want
you," she said,
"to go find some matches for the candles.
What if they're early? 1 bet they'll be early. I'll
bet that she's the kind of person who has to be
everywhere on time."
But Gabriel and Aimee were five minutes
late, during which Zoe moved distractedly
between the kitchen and the living room. On
the couch with his eyes closed, Kenneth lis
tened to the sound of her watch intensify and
recede.
Kenneth supposes that he never really took
Gabriel and Aimee's wedding seriously in the
first place. They didn't want any presents, and
they didn't invite any other guests, not even
their parents. From what Kenneth could
gather, Gabriel's parents lived on the other
side of the country, and Aimee wasn't very
close to her mother. They didn't want to go to
a church or city hall. Kenneth supposes that
they wouldn't have hired a minister if they
could have gotten away with it. The stunt that
Aimee is pulling off now seems to be less of a
hitch in plans than a natural conclusion that
they were moving toward all the time. Hut
Kenneth knows that Gabriel must be going
through hell and that Zoe is trying to console
him as best she can. For that, and for the fact
that he's lost an entire morning of work, he
thinks that Aimee is being pretty damn child
ish.
Ha, Aimee thinks as Kenneth's voice
carries up to the roof. She'll come
down when she gets hungry. They
didn't know how long she could go without
eating. She'd gone for an entire day without
eating something more substantial than a let
tuce and margarine sandwich, which had
been practically her sole diet in her all-girls
high school. "You are what you eat," her
mother told her, and she'd believed it ever
since that day in ninth grade, watching An
nette Hoffman bite into a cupcake with vanil
la frosting. She had always thought of Annette
Hoffman as a fat white girl; she mentally sub
stituted "cupcake" for "girl" and giggled to
herself whenever Annette wore pleated skirts.
She started seeing other girls at school the
same way. Emily DeVries was a thin black
licorice whip, Sara Stanley a deviled egg, Jean
nie Martin an orange fish-stick. Aimee was
two pieces of white bread with a limp piece of
lettuce in between that left a smear of green
on her front teeth.
Aimee still has trouble eating with people
she doesn't know well, like Zoe and Kenneth.

When she and Gabriel had dinner at Zoe's
place, she hardly ate anything. While Zoe
talked about the extravagant cost of wed
dings, Aimee played with her artichoke
heart-and-kidney-bean salad. She wondered
whether Zoe was trying to insinuate some
thing about being a vegetarian with the food.
By the time Zoe started talking about wed
ding dresses she'd seen in second-hand sto
ries, Aimee excused herself to the bathroom
to eat the white bread and lettuce sandwich
she had brought with her. She resisted going
through the medicine cabinet to see what
contraceptives Zoe and Kenneth used.
Aimee saw when they met that Zoe could
tell Aimee had sucked her thumb until she
was 4, and chewed her nails when she was 8,
and picked her cuticles ragged when she was
12, and by the time she was 16 had grown so
tall that no boy wanted to dance with her.
After that first meeting with Zoe, Aimee
had sincerely wanted to like her. She wanted
to so much that she let Zoe take her shopping
for a wedding dress, though all the time while
they looked through racks in thrift stores,
Aimee wondered how prudent it was to take
the fashion advice of someone whose en
trance was always preceded by the sound of
her jewelry. But she envied Zoe some things,
especially how long she'd known Gabriel. Zoe
was able to say remember in those days when
Aimee couldn't even say remember last year.
Aimee had just moved to the city last sum
mer. She had a job as a secretary, but was van
quished on the first day by a malfunctioning
coffee machine. She was on a bus heading
downtown, wondering how much longer she
could last without a job when she first saw
Gabriel. He was sitting two seats ahead of her.
She'd been intrigued by the back of his neck,
the way the ends of his hair curled, the crisp
ness of his shirt collar. She thought that she
could wake up in the morning looking at the
back of that neck.
As streets passed by, she forgot which stop

she was supposed to get off at. She just want
ed to see what his face looked like. When he
got off the bus, she followed him. He walked
as if he were used to mid-afternoon crowds
like these, weaving effortlessly between
tourists and natives and people like herself
who would never quite fit in, who would al
ways have an air of transience as they passed
other people. He ducked into a shop, a por
trait studio, and Aimee decided to come back
the next day, prepared.
Aimee thinks that she can see the portrait
studio from her vantage point on the roof.
She can also see the crumbling movie theater
that occasionally shows Italian films without
subtitles, so Gabriel has to paraphrase every
thing over the armrest to her. The park she
used to walk through, her eyes averted from
the various couples necking on the lawn, until
she and Gabriel became one of those couples,
and then she stopped caring anymore.
Aimee tucks her knees up to her chin and
pushes her wedding veil back from her face. It
actually is an elaborate lace curtain, pur
chased from the same thrift store where she
got her wedding dress. When she closes her
eyes, she can feel the sun pressing against her
face. The only other time that she remembers
facing the sun for so long was years ago.
On the first day of school, her sixth-grade
class played a game in which everyone paired
off and one person led the other, blindfolded,
across the schoolyard. Aimee's partner was a
girl named Susie Parker. Susie had led Aimee
around the playground, her hand a tenuous
link to the rest of the world. Aimee measured
every tentative step by the warmth radiating
from the asphalt. She could see sunbursts im
printed on the insides of her eyelids. Then
Susie stranded her in the boys' bathroom.
Aimee had woken up this morning feeling
the remnants of a dream slip away into her
pillow. She rolled over and saw her wedding
dress, propped up on a chair in the corner. It
looked like a debutante's gown from the '50s,

stiff enough to stand up on its own.
Aimee slipped out from under the covers,
careful not to disturb Gabriel. She went into
the bathroom, where she put on the dress and
arranged the veil. Then she stood with her
back pressed against the door, so she could
look at her reflection in the glass. She looked
like a little girl playing dress-up in her moth
er's clothes. Only, she reminded herself, she
would have never fit into any of her mother's
clothes.
When she stepped back into the bedroom,
Gabriel had shifted his position in bed. His
back was turned towards her. An alertness in
his breathing told her that he wasn't asleep.
She noticed that his hair had grown long
enough to cover the back of his neck. She
stood there, looking at him so long that his
image blurred.
Then she turned around and went back
into the bathroom. She clung to the sink until
her head cleared. She thought she might feel
better if she got some more air, so she climbed
out of the window onto the fire escape. Still
she felt closed in, so she climbed up the ladder
to the roof. She sat as close to the edge as she
dared, so that she could look into the street
below.
Aimee's gaze slides down an electric cable
into their neighbors' back yard, which is ob
scured by trees. She imagines that they have,
hidden beneath the foliage, a patio and a grill
and a swimming pool; suburbia in the middle
of the city. On Sundays the mother will set out
brunch on a picnic table while the father
reads the comics in the hammock and the lit
tle boy climbs trees and gets his knees dirty.
Aimee has never seen the little boy, but she
knows he is there. Once, while out on the fire
escape, she heard him sneeze a 5-year-old's
sharp sneeze into the still summer night, and
her pulse had leaped with a sudden affection.
Aimee reaches up to loosen the knot of
hair at her neck. Her fingers get caught in the
intricacies of her wedding veil, and she un

and then gets caught in the trees in the neigh
bors' back yard. At last, she feels lighter.
Gabriel sits on the bottom rung of the
ladder to the roof, his head in his
hands. His fingers have worked
through his hair to the roots, as though he has
to hold his head in place. Beside him, Zoe's
voice slips through the cracks in his fingers,
blessedly matter-of-fact.
"There's only one thing to do," she says.
"What's that?"
"You have to go up there and talk to her."
"1 can't."
"Why not?"
"I think she wants to be left alone. I'm will
ing to respect that."
"I'm not," Zoe says. "I'm mad as hell at her
for doing this to you "
Gabriel is glad that Zoe finally says what
he's been unable to articulate, even though a
rock of anger and hurt is lodged so deep with
in him he wonders if it can ever be shifted. Se
cretly, he's glad that he only invited Zoe and
Kenneth to the wedding.
When Aimee agreed to get married, she
made it explicit that she didn't want a big
wedding. She said that they couldn t afford it,
which was true. But Gabriel aiso had the feel
ing that if they had a church wedding she'd
have to invite her mother, whom she didn't
want to see. It didn't seem right to him that he
invite his parents if Aimee's weren't coming,
st> he only mentioned how business in the
portrait studio was doing in his latest letter to
them.
Gabriel knew that in the early years of their
marriage, his parents had been optimistic and
planned on having three kids: two to replace
themselves and one that was adopted. Ten
years later they just had one kid, the adopted
one. By that time they were middle-aged, and
Gabriel imagined his childhood like a family
portrait he took once of a young couple and
their son. The kid had refused to sit still, so
he'd ended up as a smudge across his parents'
knees. Gabriel's parents owned a black and
white television, which became Gabriel's
baby sitter, and siblings, and playmates. He
still dreams in black-and-white.
Gabriel imagines the print of a newspaper
headline: FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLED
TO GET BRIDE DOWN FROM

docs it and lets it
go. It drifts down
ward until it is only
the size of feather,

ROOF. He almost feels like laughing,
but Zoe is deadly serious.
"Gabriel," she says, "1 know

you re bad at confrontations.
But you've got to go up there
and talk to her."
"What if she

doesn't want to talk to
me?"
"That must be it,"
Zoe says. "You're afraid
to talk to her. You
thought that you knew
her better than vou reallv

do.
That was the problem with
Zoe. She knew him too well,
for eight years, since they were
undergrads in college together.
In college, Gabriel had wanted
to be a photographer. He had

gotten his MFA, and planned to
free-lance in Europe. Zoe would
own an art gallery, and when he got fa-

rnous, he would only show his work in her
gallery. But he ended up working in a portrait
studio, covering family gatherings, weddings,
graduations and other random joyous occa
sions.
One day, Aimee walked into the shop. She
wanted to get a portrait taken of herself, to
send to her mother. Apparently this was
something she did every month.
"I usually take the picture myself," she said,
taking a photograph out of her purse, "but it
always turns out pretty bad. See?"
The photograph was of Aimee sitting on a
park bench, the blur of a biker passing behind
her. The outlines of her face looked wavery;
apparently the camera had been held at arm's
length. Gabriel suddenly had the image of
Aimee's mother at home with a box of bad
Polaroids, all slightly out-of-focus.
"Why don't you just go visit her?" he sug
gested.
"Visit my mother?" Aimee laughed. "She
just wants to make sure I'm OK."
Gabriel positioned her hands in her lap,
the right over the left, and then changed his
mind and switched them. Her wrists were re
markably light; bird's wrists, he thought. He
noticed that she wasn't wearing any rings. Be
hind the camera, he adjusted the lens until
she came into focus.
He was used to making loose conversation
with his customers, to relax them. When it
came to young women, he would ask whether
they had boyfriends, and their eyes would
crinkle with embarrassment as ihey told him,
apologetically, no. It worked, though; in their
pictures they looked as though they were
smiling. This time, when Gabriel asked
Aimee that question, he really wanted to
know.
"No, I don't," she said, looking steadily at
him.
As for his own pictures, Gabriel keeps his
best efforts in a portfolio, just in case someday
he'll need one. Occasionally he will run some
of them past Zoe. He does this more out of
habit than necessity. Both of them know that
he probably isn't going to make it in the way
he thought he would. He goes to Zoe because
she knew what he was like when he used to be
lieve that. She is also his harshest critic; not
only of his work, but everything he does.
Which is why she was the first person he told
that he was getting married.
Zoe tilted her head and he could see the sil

ver earrings in her left car, a delicate row
of punctuation marks along the carti

lage.
'Why now?" she said.
"1 just think it's the right
time." He watched her twist

the rings on her fingers
"How's Kenneth?" he

asked, which
was what he

always
said
when
there
was

an awkward pause between them.
Mentioning Kenneth seemed to snap
something in Zoe. "He's fine, and you know
it, so stop trying to change the subject.
Gabriel, you're getting married to a woman
you've only known for six months."
"It's strange, but I feel like I know a lot
about her. I probably know her even better
than I know you."
"She's probably a lot less complicated."
Zoe's lips tightened at the corners after she'd
said that, as though she regretted what she'd
said. "Why don't you and Aimee come over
for dinner?" she suggested. "I'd like to meet
her. Really."
"Then there's something I should tell you
about her."
"What, does she turn into a pumpkin at
midnight or something?"
"No, she's a vegetarian."
Gabriel remembers the photograph Aimee
took of herself and how the bad focus made
her look like a ghost caught in the sunlight.
Sometimes he already feels like she's drifting
out of his field of vision. Right now, what he
wants most is to see her, to make sure she
hasn't disappeared entirely from his life. But
first he has to make sure she wants to see him.
"Will you go up?" he asks Zoe.
Zoe measures him up for a half-second,
lust when he's certain that she's going to
refuse, that she's going to go off on another
one of her tirades, she rises to her feet. "Sure,"
she says, and as she passes him up the ladder,
her skirt whispers cool against his face.
As she steps onto the roof, Zoe thinks
she can understand why Aimee chose
this place to escape. There's nothing to
impede the view in all directions. The park is
a green smudge on the horizon, and the
breeze lifted off the ocean turns the sky above
it hazy blue. Rising from the welter of build
ings and houses, all running together in the
hum of traffic, is the university clock tower's
thin spire.
Zoe could see the tower from her window
when she was a student at the city university;
it oriented her every quarter of an hour no
matter where she lived on campus. Once, she
counted the twelve chimes trickling through
the darkness of her room below her breath so
that she wouldn't wake Gabriel. That was the
first time she had slept with him. It was his
first time but not hers, although the memory
of hers still made her so

upset she'd rather
forget
i t

ever happened. She'd been far too young and
insecure, and the day afterward she had been
so angry that she went out and pierced her
ears six times, four on the left side and two on
the right. With Gabriel it was like starting
over again.
Zoe shades her eyes against the sun and
sees Aimee sitting at the very edge of the roof.
She figures that the gravel crunching beneath
her feet is warning enough, but just in case,
she says as she approaches, "The view from
here is great, isn't it?"
"It's a long way down," Aimee says, causing
Zoe to look at her sharply.
Zoe takes a cigarette and a lighter from her
pocket. "Do you mind if 1 smoke?"
"No."
Zoe lights the cigarette, hesitates and then
holds it out to Aimee.
Aimee takes a tentative drag as though
she's kissing someone for the first time.
"Would you do this to Gabriel?" she asks Zoe.
"Seriously, would you do this to him?"
Zoe laughs. "But you see, I'd never be in
the situation where I could do it in the first
place."
She wonders whether Aimee knows what
had caused her and Gabriel to break up, with
in the one month they tried living together.
This was after Gabriel had gotten his masters
and she started working in an art gallery
downtown. They lived in the apartment
Gabriel has now, although he used one of the
rooms as a darkroom. He had been looking
for a job for weeks; on rainy days when Zoe
came back from work, she would stuff her wet
shoes with want-ad sections from four differ
ent newspapers. Then she found out that he'd
gotten a job as a photographer's assistant at a
portrait studio, but was thinking of turning it
down.
"What's wrong with it?" she asked. "It's
nearby, it pays well, you get to dabble in
smelly chemicals. What more could you
want?"
"It's just not what I expected to be doing
with my life, that's all."
"Neither did 1."
He looked at her keenly. "You know, it
hasn't been easy for me to sit and watch you
pick up tabs at dinner or pay the rent because
I don't have a job."
"That was a choice you made when you de
cided to do this," she said, scattering a stack of
photographs on the table. Some pictures, she
realized, were of herself.
"You don't understand this."
"Are you saying that I can't understand
this? That I can't understand because I only sit
in an office and sell paintings all day, that I
can't know what you're going through?"
"Yes," he said. "1 don't think you can ever
understand, and I've tried to convince my
self that it's OK, that we can work through
this, because there's no one else I can think
of being with except for you."
For a moment that

completely silenced her. "Gabriel," she said
then, gently. "It's not me you're thinking of
when you say that."
She moved out the next week.
Neither of them acknowledge anymore
that they actually were involved enough at
one point in time to have lived together. They
chalk that month up as a failed experiment. In
the four years since then, some small things
have changed. Now when they go out for
lunch, they split the bill equally. When Zoe
goes to his apartment now, she feels an odd
tug of belonging, even though the place hard
ly looks the same anymore. She chose that
painting for his and Aimee's wedding present
as carefully as though it had been for her own
home. The fact that Gabriel still shows her his
photographs touches her in a way she can't
explain, but is thankful for.
"When I woke up this morning," Aimee
says,"I couldn't remember what I'd dreamed
about. I could only remember what I'd felt,
this strange kind of hesitation. Like I was
holding my breath. I changed into my dress,
and when I came out of the bathroom he was
pretending he was asleep even though he was
awake, you know what I mean?"
"I do," Zoe replies.
"I felt like he was waiting for me to do or
say something. Something that would let him
know that I felt that this day was different. But
1 didn't. I didn't feel like today was any differ
ent from yesterday, or tomorrow either. As I
looked at him, I felt kind of what I'd felt in my
dream, this sort of inability to recognize any
thing. This inability to breathe. As though
everything that mattered to me was narrowed
down to this one feeling, or thought, or idea.
I had to get out of there."
"And?"
"And so I came up here. I don't feel like I'm
in a specific place or a time when I'm here. It's
as if this could have happened yesterday, or it
could have happened tomorrow."
"But it didn't. It happened today." Zoe cor
rects herself. "It's happening now."
Aimee grinds out the cigarette on the grav
el.
"May I?" Zoe asks, low.
For a moment, Aimee looks at the palms of
her hands. She shakes flecks of ash from her
fingers. "OK," she finally says.
Zoe stands up and goes to the other end of
the roof. Gabriel is where she left him, seated
on the bottom rung of the ladder. He glances
up as she descends and then gets to his feet
when she reaches the landing.
"It's OK," she says. "You can go on up."
Gabriel moves past her in a rush of air vi
brant with tension and uncertainty. Zoe
shades her eyes against the sun as she looks
upwards. She thinks she can see Aimee stand
ing at the edge of the roof, and that Aimee ex
tends her hand to him. He takes it, and then
he is gone from sight.
Zoe climbs through the window into the
bathroom, the bedroom, the living room,
where Kenneth is sitting on the couch with
the bottle of Guinness. She sits down next to
him. His right arm lies across the back of the
couch, and she lets her head rest against his
shoulder. Together they look at the glass of the
painting opposite them, as though in their
twin reflection they can see what's going on
over their heads.

The elevator is out of order, so they have
to use the stairs. Zoe is worried that
they will be late for the wedding.
"How can we be late?" Kenneth says.
"We're the only guests, besides the minister."
He pauses to consider whether a minister can
be called a guest.
Then he follows Zoe up the stairs, focusing
on the Hash of her ankles revealed by the rise
and fall of her skirt. He lags behind a little be
cause he's carrying the wedding present,
which is a painting. It's an abstract watercol
or that looks like someone went amok with

even he could do a better job painting the in
side of somebody's bathroom, but when he
told Zoe that, she refused to speak to him for
a day. He wonders ifZoe is still mad at him lor
turning the alarm clock off this morning and
promptly falling asleep.
They have to wait a long time before
Gabriel opens the door of the apartment. Al
though he's wearing suit trousers and a but
ton-down shirt, his collar is twisted and his
hair falls uncombed over his forehead.
"Let me guess," Kenneth says. "Your alarm
didn't go off either."
Gabriel shakes his head as Kenneth and
Zoe move past him into the living room. Ken
neth leans the painting against the wall oppo
site the couch. It is when he notices how still
the air is, how frozen the room looks, that he
realizes something is wrong.
Zoe reaches up and straightens Gabriel's
collar. "Where's Aimee?" she asks.
"She's on the roof."
"On the roof?"
"She won't come down."
Kenneth tries to think of something com
forting to say. "It's probably just nerves. You
know, pre-wedding jitters."
"I don't know what to call it." Gabriel's
voice is taut.
"What you need is a drink," Kenneth says.
Neither Gabriel nor Zoe reply, so Kenneth
goes into the kitchen.
Kenneth believes that you can tell some
one's personality from the contents of their
refrigerator. Today there is only a wilted head
of lettuce and a bottle of Guinness in
Gabriel's; he figures this is a sign that Aimee is
taking over. When he'd first known Gabriel,
there had always been the same three things:
pastrami, onions and beer, like primary col
ors.
Kenneth knows that Zoe likes to tell her
friends that he's a painter. He also knows that
she doesn't specify that he's a house painter,
which he thinks is amusing because they first
met when he painted Gabriel's kitchen last
year. His first day on the job, Gabriel and Zoe
had argued whether the paint color should be
pearl gray or cornflower blue; pearl gray,
Gabriel's choice, won out. Kenneth offered
up no opinion but had watched Zoe's eyes
darken with frustration. Because of the way
they argued he was sure that Gabriel and Zoe

were a couple; they assured him they weren't.
Zoe started dropping by the apartment when
Gabriel wasn't there. She always seemed to
catch Kenneth when he was taking a break, so
it didn't look like he was working at all. He
and Zoe first made love one afternoon when
Gabriel was at work, on his kitchen floor.
When Kenneth returns to the living room,
no one is there. He can hear voices, though,
and he follows them into the bedroom and
then the bathroom. The window is open, and
Zoe and Gabriel are on the fire escape landing
outside. There's only room for two people on
the landing, so Kenneth sits on the win
dowsill. He sticks his head out of the window
and looks up. He thinks that he catches a
glimpse of something white, something that
could be a face or a hand or the edge of a skirt,
before it disappears from the edge of the roof.
No one seems to have seen this except for
him.
"I called half an hour ago and canceled,"
Gabriel is saying.
Kenneth wonders if canceling a minister is
as easy as canceling a doctor's appointment,
and if you're asked if you'd like to reschedule.
"Canceled!" Zoe says. "What did you do
that for?"
"I didn't want him to get here and have to

Gabriel shakes liis head as Kenneth and Zoe
move past him into the living room. Kenneth
leans the painting against the wall opposite
the couch. It is when he notices how still the
air is, how frozen the room looks, that he re
alizes something is wrong.

wait. I didn't want to have to think about that,
on top of everything else."
"How long do you think you'll have to
wait?" Kenneth says. He sticks his head out
the window again and projects loudly to
wards the roof, "She'll come down when she
gets hungry."
Zoe glares at him to let him know that she
doesn't appreciate his sense of humor. Ken
neth gets the feeling that he's being shut out,
as though he's at home and everyone else is
out getting drunk. So he retreats to the living
room and settles himself on the couch with
the bottle of Guinness. He looks at the paint
ing leaning against the wall, shifting a little so
the glare from the glass covering it doesn't get
into his eyes. It's supposed to be from both
himself and Zoe, although Zoe was the one
who spent a weekend on the telephone nego-

tiating with the dealer. She also paid
more for it, which Kenneth thinks is
only fair because she's the one who's
known Gabriel since college. Nei
ther of them have known Aimee for
very long, just a few months.

Kenneth didn't think much of Aimee
when he met her, that night Zoe invited her
and Gabriel over for dinner. She reminded
him of a paper doll, looking like she'd blow

away if you so much as sneezed in her direc
tion. He would never have guessed that
Gabriel and Aimee were engaged just by look
ing at them. Then again, he wondered if his
bearings were generally off when it came to
figuring out the more complex relationships
between people. He didn't even know exactly
how close Gabriel and Zoe were, although he
suspected that something must have gone on
at some point within the 10 years of their
friendship.
Only Kenneth knew the preparations Zoe
went through that evening Gabriel and
Aimee came over for dinner, from ordering
an arrangement of flowers to going down
town twice to change the wine. Ten minutes
before Gabriel and Aimee were due to arrive,
she was looking through her closet for some
thing to wear, tossing half the clothes out in

the process.
"Z," he said; this was what he called her
whenever she had her back arched like a ruf
fled cat, "it's OK. Everything's going to be
OK."
"What if she doesn't like artichokes or
beans? I mean, what if she's some sort of
weird breed of vegetarian who only eats leafy
green vegetables?"
"Then we'll just have the flowers and the
Zinfandel."
Zoe wadded up a silk blouse and threw it at
him, but on second thought, went to retrieve
it. He thought it a good sign that she didn't
twist away when he put his hands around her
waist.
"Don't," she said. "I'm trying to get
dressed."
"I don't want you to get dressed."

"I want
you," she said,
"to go find some matches for the candles.
What if they're early? 1 bet they'll be early. I'll
bet that she's the kind of person who has to be
everywhere on time."
But Gabriel and Aimee were five minutes
late, during which Zoe moved distractedly
between the kitchen and the living room. On
the couch with his eyes closed, Kenneth lis
tened to the sound of her watch intensify and
recede.
Kenneth supposes that he never really took
Gabriel and Aimee's wedding seriously in the
first place. They didn't want any presents, and
they didn't invite any other guests, not even
their parents. From what Kenneth could
gather, Gabriel's parents lived on the other
side of the country, and Aimee wasn't very
close to her mother. They didn't want to go to
a church or city hall. Kenneth supposes that
they wouldn't have hired a minister if they
could have gotten away with it. The stunt that
Aimee is pulling off now seems to be less of a
hitch in plans than a natural conclusion that
they were moving toward all the time. Hut
Kenneth knows that Gabriel must be going
through hell and that Zoe is trying to console
him as best she can. For that, and for the fact
that he's lost an entire morning of work, he
thinks that Aimee is being pretty damn child
ish.
Ha, Aimee thinks as Kenneth's voice
carries up to the roof. She'll come
down when she gets hungry. They
didn't know how long she could go without
eating. She'd gone for an entire day without
eating something more substantial than a let
tuce and margarine sandwich, which had
been practically her sole diet in her all-girls
high school. "You are what you eat," her
mother told her, and she'd believed it ever
since that day in ninth grade, watching An
nette Hoffman bite into a cupcake with vanil
la frosting. She had always thought of Annette
Hoffman as a fat white girl; she mentally sub
stituted "cupcake" for "girl" and giggled to
herself whenever Annette wore pleated skirts.
She started seeing other girls at school the
same way. Emily DeVries was a thin black
licorice whip, Sara Stanley a deviled egg, Jean
nie Martin an orange fish-stick. Aimee was
two pieces of white bread with a limp piece of
lettuce in between that left a smear of green
on her front teeth.
Aimee still has trouble eating with people
she doesn't know well, like Zoe and Kenneth.

When she and Gabriel had dinner at Zoe's
place, she hardly ate anything. While Zoe
talked about the extravagant cost of wed
dings, Aimee played with her artichoke
heart-and-kidney-bean salad. She wondered
whether Zoe was trying to insinuate some
thing about being a vegetarian with the food.
By the time Zoe started talking about wed
ding dresses she'd seen in second-hand sto
ries, Aimee excused herself to the bathroom
to eat the white bread and lettuce sandwich
she had brought with her. She resisted going
through the medicine cabinet to see what
contraceptives Zoe and Kenneth used.
Aimee saw when they met that Zoe could
tell Aimee had sucked her thumb until she
was 4, and chewed her nails when she was 8,
and picked her cuticles ragged when she was
12, and by the time she was 16 had grown so
tall that no boy wanted to dance with her.
After that first meeting with Zoe, Aimee
had sincerely wanted to like her. She wanted
to so much that she let Zoe take her shopping
for a wedding dress, though all the time while
they looked through racks in thrift stores,
Aimee wondered how prudent it was to take
the fashion advice of someone whose en
trance was always preceded by the sound of
her jewelry. But she envied Zoe some things,
especially how long she'd known Gabriel. Zoe
was able to say remember in those days when
Aimee couldn't even say remember last year.
Aimee had just moved to the city last sum
mer. She had a job as a secretary, but was van
quished on the first day by a malfunctioning
coffee machine. She was on a bus heading
downtown, wondering how much longer she
could last without a job when she first saw
Gabriel. He was sitting two seats ahead of her.
She'd been intrigued by the back of his neck,
the way the ends of his hair curled, the crisp
ness of his shirt collar. She thought that she
could wake up in the morning looking at the
back of that neck.
As streets passed by, she forgot which stop

she was supposed to get off at. She just want
ed to see what his face looked like. When he
got off the bus, she followed him. He walked
as if he were used to mid-afternoon crowds
like these, weaving effortlessly between
tourists and natives and people like herself
who would never quite fit in, who would al
ways have an air of transience as they passed
other people. He ducked into a shop, a por
trait studio, and Aimee decided to come back
the next day, prepared.
Aimee thinks that she can see the portrait
studio from her vantage point on the roof.
She can also see the crumbling movie theater
that occasionally shows Italian films without
subtitles, so Gabriel has to paraphrase every
thing over the armrest to her. The park she
used to walk through, her eyes averted from
the various couples necking on the lawn, until
she and Gabriel became one of those couples,
and then she stopped caring anymore.
Aimee tucks her knees up to her chin and
pushes her wedding veil back from her face. It
actually is an elaborate lace curtain, pur
chased from the same thrift store where she
got her wedding dress. When she closes her
eyes, she can feel the sun pressing against her
face. The only other time that she remembers
facing the sun for so long was years ago.
On the first day of school, her sixth-grade
class played a game in which everyone paired
off and one person led the other, blindfolded,
across the schoolyard. Aimee's partner was a
girl named Susie Parker. Susie had led Aimee
around the playground, her hand a tenuous
link to the rest of the world. Aimee measured
every tentative step by the warmth radiating
from the asphalt. She could see sunbursts im
printed on the insides of her eyelids. Then
Susie stranded her in the boys' bathroom.
Aimee had woken up this morning feeling
the remnants of a dream slip away into her
pillow. She rolled over and saw her wedding
dress, propped up on a chair in the corner. It
looked like a debutante's gown from the '50s,

stiff enough to stand up on its own.
Aimee slipped out from under the covers,
careful not to disturb Gabriel. She went into
the bathroom, where she put on the dress and
arranged the veil. Then she stood with her
back pressed against the door, so she could
look at her reflection in the glass. She looked
like a little girl playing dress-up in her moth
er's clothes. Only, she reminded herself, she
would have never fit into any of her mother's
clothes.
When she stepped back into the bedroom,
Gabriel had shifted his position in bed. His
back was turned towards her. An alertness in
his breathing told her that he wasn't asleep.
She noticed that his hair had grown long
enough to cover the back of his neck. She
stood there, looking at him so long that his
image blurred.
Then she turned around and went back
into the bathroom. She clung to the sink until
her head cleared. She thought she might feel
better if she got some more air, so she climbed
out of the window onto the fire escape. Still
she felt closed in, so she climbed up the ladder
to the roof. She sat as close to the edge as she
dared, so that she could look into the street
below.
Aimee's gaze slides down an electric cable
into their neighbors' back yard, which is ob
scured by trees. She imagines that they have,
hidden beneath the foliage, a patio and a grill
and a swimming pool; suburbia in the middle
of the city. On Sundays the mother will set out
brunch on a picnic table while the father
reads the comics in the hammock and the lit
tle boy climbs trees and gets his knees dirty.
Aimee has never seen the little boy, but she
knows he is there. Once, while out on the fire
escape, she heard him sneeze a 5-year-old's
sharp sneeze into the still summer night, and
her pulse had leaped with a sudden affection.
Aimee reaches up to loosen the knot of
hair at her neck. Her fingers get caught in the
intricacies of her wedding veil, and she un

and then gets caught in the trees in the neigh
bors' back yard. At last, she feels lighter.
Gabriel sits on the bottom rung of the
ladder to the roof, his head in his
hands. His fingers have worked
through his hair to the roots, as though he has
to hold his head in place. Beside him, Zoe's
voice slips through the cracks in his fingers,
blessedly matter-of-fact.
"There's only one thing to do," she says.
"What's that?"
"You have to go up there and talk to her."
"1 can't."
"Why not?"
"I think she wants to be left alone. I'm will
ing to respect that."
"I'm not," Zoe says. "I'm mad as hell at her
for doing this to you "
Gabriel is glad that Zoe finally says what
he's been unable to articulate, even though a
rock of anger and hurt is lodged so deep with
in him he wonders if it can ever be shifted. Se
cretly, he's glad that he only invited Zoe and
Kenneth to the wedding.
When Aimee agreed to get married, she
made it explicit that she didn't want a big
wedding. She said that they couldn t afford it,
which was true. But Gabriel aiso had the feel
ing that if they had a church wedding she'd
have to invite her mother, whom she didn't
want to see. It didn't seem right to him that he
invite his parents if Aimee's weren't coming,
st> he only mentioned how business in the
portrait studio was doing in his latest letter to
them.
Gabriel knew that in the early years of their
marriage, his parents had been optimistic and
planned on having three kids: two to replace
themselves and one that was adopted. Ten
years later they just had one kid, the adopted
one. By that time they were middle-aged, and
Gabriel imagined his childhood like a family
portrait he took once of a young couple and
their son. The kid had refused to sit still, so
he'd ended up as a smudge across his parents'
knees. Gabriel's parents owned a black and
white television, which became Gabriel's
baby sitter, and siblings, and playmates. He
still dreams in black-and-white.
Gabriel imagines the print of a newspaper
headline: FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLED
TO GET BRIDE DOWN FROM

docs it and lets it
go. It drifts down
ward until it is only
the size of feather,

ROOF. He almost feels like laughing,
but Zoe is deadly serious.
"Gabriel," she says, "1 know

you re bad at confrontations.
But you've got to go up there
and talk to her."
"What if she

doesn't want to talk to
me?"
"That must be it,"
Zoe says. "You're afraid
to talk to her. You
thought that you knew
her better than vou reallv

do.
That was the problem with
Zoe. She knew him too well,
for eight years, since they were
undergrads in college together.
In college, Gabriel had wanted
to be a photographer. He had

gotten his MFA, and planned to
free-lance in Europe. Zoe would
own an art gallery, and when he got fa-

rnous, he would only show his work in her
gallery. But he ended up working in a portrait
studio, covering family gatherings, weddings,
graduations and other random joyous occa
sions.
One day, Aimee walked into the shop. She
wanted to get a portrait taken of herself, to
send to her mother. Apparently this was
something she did every month.
"I usually take the picture myself," she said,
taking a photograph out of her purse, "but it
always turns out pretty bad. See?"
The photograph was of Aimee sitting on a
park bench, the blur of a biker passing behind
her. The outlines of her face looked wavery;
apparently the camera had been held at arm's
length. Gabriel suddenly had the image of
Aimee's mother at home with a box of bad
Polaroids, all slightly out-of-focus.
"Why don't you just go visit her?" he sug
gested.
"Visit my mother?" Aimee laughed. "She
just wants to make sure I'm OK."
Gabriel positioned her hands in her lap,
the right over the left, and then changed his
mind and switched them. Her wrists were re
markably light; bird's wrists, he thought. He
noticed that she wasn't wearing any rings. Be
hind the camera, he adjusted the lens until
she came into focus.
He was used to making loose conversation
with his customers, to relax them. When it
came to young women, he would ask whether
they had boyfriends, and their eyes would
crinkle with embarrassment as ihey told him,
apologetically, no. It worked, though; in their
pictures they looked as though they were
smiling. This time, when Gabriel asked
Aimee that question, he really wanted to
know.
"No, I don't," she said, looking steadily at
him.
As for his own pictures, Gabriel keeps his
best efforts in a portfolio, just in case someday
he'll need one. Occasionally he will run some
of them past Zoe. He does this more out of
habit than necessity. Both of them know that
he probably isn't going to make it in the way
he thought he would. He goes to Zoe because
she knew what he was like when he used to be
lieve that. She is also his harshest critic; not
only of his work, but everything he does.
Which is why she was the first person he told
that he was getting married.
Zoe tilted her head and he could see the sil

ver earrings in her left car, a delicate row
of punctuation marks along the carti

lage.
'Why now?" she said.
"1 just think it's the right
time." He watched her twist

the rings on her fingers
"How's Kenneth?" he

asked, which
was what he

always
said
when
there
was

an awkward pause between them.
Mentioning Kenneth seemed to snap
something in Zoe. "He's fine, and you know
it, so stop trying to change the subject.
Gabriel, you're getting married to a woman
you've only known for six months."
"It's strange, but I feel like I know a lot
about her. I probably know her even better
than I know you."
"She's probably a lot less complicated."
Zoe's lips tightened at the corners after she'd
said that, as though she regretted what she'd
said. "Why don't you and Aimee come over
for dinner?" she suggested. "I'd like to meet
her. Really."
"Then there's something I should tell you
about her."
"What, does she turn into a pumpkin at
midnight or something?"
"No, she's a vegetarian."
Gabriel remembers the photograph Aimee
took of herself and how the bad focus made
her look like a ghost caught in the sunlight.
Sometimes he already feels like she's drifting
out of his field of vision. Right now, what he
wants most is to see her, to make sure she
hasn't disappeared entirely from his life. But
first he has to make sure she wants to see him.
"Will you go up?" he asks Zoe.
Zoe measures him up for a half-second,
lust when he's certain that she's going to
refuse, that she's going to go off on another
one of her tirades, she rises to her feet. "Sure,"
she says, and as she passes him up the ladder,
her skirt whispers cool against his face.
As she steps onto the roof, Zoe thinks
she can understand why Aimee chose
this place to escape. There's nothing to
impede the view in all directions. The park is
a green smudge on the horizon, and the
breeze lifted off the ocean turns the sky above
it hazy blue. Rising from the welter of build
ings and houses, all running together in the
hum of traffic, is the university clock tower's
thin spire.
Zoe could see the tower from her window
when she was a student at the city university;
it oriented her every quarter of an hour no
matter where she lived on campus. Once, she
counted the twelve chimes trickling through
the darkness of her room below her breath so
that she wouldn't wake Gabriel. That was the
first time she had slept with him. It was his
first time but not hers, although the memory
of hers still made her so

upset she'd rather
forget
i t

ever happened. She'd been far too young and
insecure, and the day afterward she had been
so angry that she went out and pierced her
ears six times, four on the left side and two on
the right. With Gabriel it was like starting
over again.
Zoe shades her eyes against the sun and
sees Aimee sitting at the very edge of the roof.
She figures that the gravel crunching beneath
her feet is warning enough, but just in case,
she says as she approaches, "The view from
here is great, isn't it?"
"It's a long way down," Aimee says, causing
Zoe to look at her sharply.
Zoe takes a cigarette and a lighter from her
pocket. "Do you mind if 1 smoke?"
"No."
Zoe lights the cigarette, hesitates and then
holds it out to Aimee.
Aimee takes a tentative drag as though
she's kissing someone for the first time.
"Would you do this to Gabriel?" she asks Zoe.
"Seriously, would you do this to him?"
Zoe laughs. "But you see, I'd never be in
the situation where I could do it in the first
place."
She wonders whether Aimee knows what
had caused her and Gabriel to break up, with
in the one month they tried living together.
This was after Gabriel had gotten his masters
and she started working in an art gallery
downtown. They lived in the apartment
Gabriel has now, although he used one of the
rooms as a darkroom. He had been looking
for a job for weeks; on rainy days when Zoe
came back from work, she would stuff her wet
shoes with want-ad sections from four differ
ent newspapers. Then she found out that he'd
gotten a job as a photographer's assistant at a
portrait studio, but was thinking of turning it
down.
"What's wrong with it?" she asked. "It's
nearby, it pays well, you get to dabble in
smelly chemicals. What more could you
want?"
"It's just not what I expected to be doing
with my life, that's all."
"Neither did 1."
He looked at her keenly. "You know, it
hasn't been easy for me to sit and watch you
pick up tabs at dinner or pay the rent because
I don't have a job."
"That was a choice you made when you de
cided to do this," she said, scattering a stack of
photographs on the table. Some pictures, she
realized, were of herself.
"You don't understand this."
"Are you saying that I can't understand
this? That I can't understand because I only sit
in an office and sell paintings all day, that I
can't know what you're going through?"
"Yes," he said. "1 don't think you can ever
understand, and I've tried to convince my
self that it's OK, that we can work through
this, because there's no one else I can think
of being with except for you."
For a moment that

completely silenced her. "Gabriel," she said
then, gently. "It's not me you're thinking of
when you say that."
She moved out the next week.
Neither of them acknowledge anymore
that they actually were involved enough at
one point in time to have lived together. They
chalk that month up as a failed experiment. In
the four years since then, some small things
have changed. Now when they go out for
lunch, they split the bill equally. When Zoe
goes to his apartment now, she feels an odd
tug of belonging, even though the place hard
ly looks the same anymore. She chose that
painting for his and Aimee's wedding present
as carefully as though it had been for her own
home. The fact that Gabriel still shows her his
photographs touches her in a way she can't
explain, but is thankful for.
"When I woke up this morning," Aimee
says,"I couldn't remember what I'd dreamed
about. I could only remember what I'd felt,
this strange kind of hesitation. Like I was
holding my breath. I changed into my dress,
and when I came out of the bathroom he was
pretending he was asleep even though he was
awake, you know what I mean?"
"I do," Zoe replies.
"I felt like he was waiting for me to do or
say something. Something that would let him
know that I felt that this day was different. But
1 didn't. I didn't feel like today was any differ
ent from yesterday, or tomorrow either. As I
looked at him, I felt kind of what I'd felt in my
dream, this sort of inability to recognize any
thing. This inability to breathe. As though
everything that mattered to me was narrowed
down to this one feeling, or thought, or idea.
I had to get out of there."
"And?"
"And so I came up here. I don't feel like I'm
in a specific place or a time when I'm here. It's
as if this could have happened yesterday, or it
could have happened tomorrow."
"But it didn't. It happened today." Zoe cor
rects herself. "It's happening now."
Aimee grinds out the cigarette on the grav
el.
"May I?" Zoe asks, low.
For a moment, Aimee looks at the palms of
her hands. She shakes flecks of ash from her
fingers. "OK," she finally says.
Zoe stands up and goes to the other end of
the roof. Gabriel is where she left him, seated
on the bottom rung of the ladder. He glances
up as she descends and then gets to his feet
when she reaches the landing.
"It's OK," she says. "You can go on up."
Gabriel moves past her in a rush of air vi
brant with tension and uncertainty. Zoe
shades her eyes against the sun as she looks
upwards. She thinks she can see Aimee stand
ing at the edge of the roof, and that Aimee ex
tends her hand to him. He takes it, and then
he is gone from sight.
Zoe climbs through the window into the
bathroom, the bedroom, the living room,
where Kenneth is sitting on the couch with
the bottle of Guinness. She sits down next to
him. His right arm lies across the back of the
couch, and she lets her head rest against his
shoulder. Together they look at the glass of the
painting opposite them, as though in their
twin reflection they can see what's going on
over their heads.

The elevator is out of order, so they have
to use the stairs. Zoe is worried that
they will be late for the wedding.
"How can we be late?" Kenneth says.
"We're the only guests, besides the minister."
He pauses to consider whether a minister can
be called a guest.
Then he follows Zoe up the stairs, focusing
on the Hash of her ankles revealed by the rise
and fall of her skirt. He lags behind a little be
cause he's carrying the wedding present,
which is a painting. It's an abstract watercol
or that looks like someone went amok with
paint in a prison cell. Kenneth thinks that
even he could do a better job painting the in
side of somebody's bathroom, but when he
told Zoe that, she refused to speak to him for
a day. He wonders ifZoe is still mad at him lor
turning the alarm clock off this morning and
promptly falling asleep.
They have to wait a long time before
Gabriel opens the door of the apartment. Al
though he's wearing suit trousers and a but
ton-down shirt, his collar is twisted and his
hair falls uncombed over his forehead.
"Let me guess," Kenneth says. "Your alarm
didn't go off either."
Gabriel shakes his head as Kenneth and
Zoe move past him into the living room. Ken
neth leans the painting against the wall oppo
site the couch. It is when he notices how still
the air is, how frozen the room looks, that he
realizes something is wrong.
Zoe reaches up and straightens Gabriel's
collar. "Where's Aimee?" she asks.
"She's on the roof."
"On the roof?"
"She won't come down."
Kenneth tries to think of something com
forting to say. "It's probably just nerves. You
know, pre-wedding jitters."
"I don't know what to call it." Gabriel's
voice is taut.
"What you need is a drink," Kenneth says.
Neither Gabriel nor Zoe reply, so Kenneth
goes into the kitchen.
Kenneth believes that you can tell some
one's personality from the contents of their
refrigerator. Today there is only a wilted head
of lettuce and a bottle of Guinness in
Gabriel's; he figures this is a sign that Aimee is
taking over. When he'd first known Gabriel,
there had always been the same three things:
pastrami, onions and beer, like primary col
ors.
Kenneth knows that Zoe likes to tell her
friends that he's a painter. He also knows that
she doesn't specify that he's a house painter,
which he thinks is amusing because they first
met when he painted Gabriel's kitchen last
year. His first day on the job, Gabriel and Zoe
had argued whether the paint color should be
pearl gray or cornflower blue; pearl gray,
Gabriel's choice, won out. Kenneth offered
up no opinion but had watched Zoe's eyes
darken with frustration. Because of the way
they argued he was sure that Gabriel and Zoe

were a couple; they assured him they weren't.
Zoe started dropping by the apartment when
Gabriel wasn't there. She always seemed to
catch Kenneth when he was taking a break, so
it didn't look like he was working at all. He
and Zoe first made love one afternoon when
Gabriel was at work, on his kitchen floor.
When Kenneth returns to the living room,
no one is there. He can hear voices, though,
and he follows them into the bedroom and
then the bathroom. The window is open, and
Zoe and Gabriel are on the fire escape landing
outside. There's only room for two people on
the landing, so Kenneth sits on the win
dowsill. He sticks his head out of the window
and looks up. He thinks that he catches a
glimpse of something white, something that
could be a face or a hand or the edge of a skirt,
before it disappears from the edge of the roof.
No one seems to have seen this except for
him.
"I called half an hour ago and canceled,"
Gabriel is saying.
Kenneth wonders if canceling a minister is
as easy as canceling a doctor's appointment,
and if you're asked if you'd like to reschedule.
"Canceled!" Zoe says. "What did you do
that for?"
"I didn't want him to get here and have to

Gabriel shakes liis head as Kenneth and Zoe
move past him into the living room. Kenneth
leans the painting against the wall opposite
the couch. It is when he notices how still the
air is, how frozen the room looks, that he re
alizes something is wrong.

wait. I didn't want to have to think about that,
on top of everything else."
"How long do you think you'll have to
wait?" Kenneth says. He sticks his head out
the window again and projects loudly to
wards the roof, "She'll come down when she
gets hungry."
Zoe glares at him to let him know that she
doesn't appreciate his sense of humor. Ken
neth gets the feeling that he's being shut out,
as though he's at home and everyone else is
out getting drunk. So he retreats to the living
room and settles himself on the couch with
the bottle of Guinness. He looks at the paint
ing leaning against the wall, shifting a little so
the glare from the glass covering it doesn't get
into his eyes. It's supposed to be from both
himself and Zoe, although Zoe was the one
who spent a weekend on the telephone nego-

tiating with the dealer. She also paid
more for it, which Kenneth thinks is
only fair because she's the one who's
known Gabriel since college. Nei
ther of them have known Aimee for
very long, just a few months.

Kenneth didn't think much of Aimee
when he met her, that night Zoe invited her
and Gabriel over for dinner. She reminded
him of a paper doll, looking like she'd blow

away if you so much as sneezed in her direc
tion. He would never have guessed that
Gabriel and Aimee were engaged just by look
ing at them. Then again, he wondered if his
bearings were generally off when it came to
figuring out the more complex relationships
between people. He didn't even know exactly
how close Gabriel and Zoe were, although he
suspected that something must have gone on
at some point within the 10 years of their
friendship.
Only Kenneth knew the preparations Zoe
went through that evening Gabriel and
Aimee came over for dinner, from ordering
an arrangement of flowers to going down
town twice to change the wine. Ten minutes
before Gabriel and Aimee were due to arrive,
she was looking through her closet for some
thing to wear, tossing half the clothes out in

the process.
"Z," he said; this was what he called her
whenever she had her back arched like a ruf
fled cat, "it's OK. Everything's going to be
OK."
"What if she doesn't like artichokes or
beans? I mean, what if she's some sort of
weird breed of vegetarian who only eats leafy
green vegetables?"
"Then we'll just have the flowers and the
Zinfandel."
Zoe wadded up a silk blouse and threw it at
him, but on second thought, went to retrieve
it. He thought it a good sign that she didn't
twist away when he put his hands around her
waist.
"Don't," she said. "I'm trying to get
dressed."
"I don't want you to get dressed."

"I want
you," she said,
"to go find some matches for the candles.
What if they're early? 1 bet they'll be early. I'll
bet that she's the kind of person who has to be
everywhere on time."
But Gabriel and Aimee were five minutes
late, during which Zoe moved distractedly
between the kitchen and the living room. On
the couch with his eyes closed, Kenneth lis
tened to the sound of her watch intensify and
recede.
Kenneth supposes that he never really took
Gabriel and Aimee's wedding seriously in the
first place. They didn't want any presents, and
they didn't invite any other guests, not even
their parents. From what Kenneth could
gather, Gabriel's parents lived on the other
side of the country, and Aimee wasn't very
close to her mother. They didn't want to go to
a church or city hall. Kenneth supposes that
they wouldn't have hired a minister if they
could have gotten away with it. The stunt that
Aimee is pulling off now seems to be less of a
hitch in plans than a natural conclusion that
they were moving toward all the time. Hut
Kenneth knows that Gabriel must be going
through hell and that Zoe is trying to console
him as best she can. For that, and for the fact
that he's lost an entire morning of work, he
thinks that Aimee is being pretty damn child
ish.
Ha, Aimee thinks as Kenneth's voice
carries up to the roof. She'll come
down when she gets hungry. They
didn't know how long she could go without
eating. She'd gone for an entire day without
eating something more substantial than a let
tuce and margarine sandwich, which had
been practically her sole diet in her all-girls
high school. "You are what you eat," her
mother told her, and she'd believed it ever
since that day in ninth grade, watching An
nette Hoffman bite into a cupcake with vanil
la frosting. She had always thought of Annette
Hoffman as a fat white girl; she mentally sub
stituted "cupcake" for "girl" and giggled to
herself whenever Annette wore pleated skirts.
She started seeing other girls at school the
same way. Emily DeVries was a thin black
licorice whip, Sara Stanley a deviled egg, Jean
nie Martin an orange fish-stick. Aimee was
two pieces of white bread with a limp piece of
lettuce in between that left a smear of green
on her front teeth.
Aimee still has trouble eating with people
she doesn't know well, like Zoe and Kenneth.

When she and Gabriel had dinner at Zoe's
place, she hardly ate anything. While Zoe
talked about the extravagant cost of wed
dings, Aimee played with her artichoke
heart-and-kidney-bean salad. She wondered
whether Zoe was trying to insinuate some
thing about being a vegetarian with the food.
By the time Zoe started talking about wed
ding dresses she'd seen in second-hand sto
ries, Aimee excused herself to the bathroom
to eat the white bread and lettuce sandwich
she had brought with her. She resisted going
through the medicine cabinet to see what
contraceptives Zoe and Kenneth used.
Aimee saw when they met that Zoe could
tell Aimee had sucked her thumb until she
was 4, and chewed her nails when she was 8,
and picked her cuticles ragged when she was
12, and by the time she was 16 had grown so
tall that no boy wanted to dance with her.
After that first meeting with Zoe, Aimee
had sincerely wanted to like her. She wanted
to so much that she let Zoe take her shopping
for a wedding dress, though all the time while
they looked through racks in thrift stores,
Aimee wondered how prudent it was to take
the fashion advice of someone whose en
trance was always preceded by the sound of
her jewelry. But she envied Zoe some things,
especially how long she'd known Gabriel. Zoe
was able to say remember in those days when
Aimee couldn't even say remember last year.
Aimee had just moved to the city last sum
mer. She had a job as a secretary, but was van
quished on the first day by a malfunctioning
coffee machine. She was on a bus heading
downtown, wondering how much longer she
could last without a job when she first saw
Gabriel. He was sitting two seats ahead of her.
She'd been intrigued by the back of his neck,
the way the ends of his hair curled, the crisp
ness of his shirt collar. She thought that she
could wake up in the morning looking at the
back of that neck.
As streets passed by, she forgot which stop

she was supposed to get off at. She just want
ed to see what his face looked like. When he
got off the bus, she followed him. He walked
as if he were used to mid-afternoon crowds
like these, weaving effortlessly between
tourists and natives and people like herself
who would never quite fit in, who would al
ways have an air of transience as they passed
other people. He ducked into a shop, a por
trait studio, and Aimee decided to come back
the next day, prepared.
Aimee thinks that she can see the portrait
studio from her vantage point on the roof.
She can also see the crumbling movie theater
that occasionally shows Italian films without
subtitles, so Gabriel has to paraphrase every
thing over the armrest to her. The park she
used to walk through, her eyes averted from
the various couples necking on the lawn, until
she and Gabriel became one of those couples,
and then she stopped caring anymore.
Aimee tucks her knees up to her chin and
pushes her wedding veil back from her face. It
actually is an elaborate lace curtain, pur
chased from the same thrift store where she
got her wedding dress. When she closes her
eyes, she can feel the sun pressing against her
face. The only other time that she remembers
facing the sun for so long was years ago.
On the first day of school, her sixth-grade
class played a game in which everyone paired
off and one person led the other, blindfolded,
across the schoolyard. Aimee's partner was a
girl named Susie Parker. Susie had led Aimee
around the playground, her hand a tenuous
link to the rest of the world. Aimee measured
every tentative step by the warmth radiating
from the asphalt. She could see sunbursts im
printed on the insides of her eyelids. Then
Susie stranded her in the boys' bathroom.
Aimee had woken up this morning feeling
the remnants of a dream slip away into her
pillow. She rolled over and saw her wedding
dress, propped up on a chair in the corner. It
looked like a debutante's gown from the '50s,

stiff enough to stand up on its own.
Aimee slipped out from under the covers,
careful not to disturb Gabriel. She went into
the bathroom, where she put on the dress and
arranged the veil. Then she stood with her
back pressed against the door, so she could
look at her reflection in the glass. She looked
like a little girl playing dress-up in her moth
er's clothes. Only, she reminded herself, she
would have never fit into any of her mother's
clothes.
When she stepped back into the bedroom,
Gabriel had shifted his position in bed. His
back was turned towards her. An alertness in
his breathing told her that he wasn't asleep.
She noticed that his hair had grown long
enough to cover the back of his neck. She
stood there, looking at him so long that his
image blurred.
Then she turned around and went back
into the bathroom. She clung to the sink until
her head cleared. She thought she might feel
better if she got some more air, so she climbed
out of the window onto the fire escape. Still
she felt closed in, so she climbed up the ladder
to the roof. She sat as close to the edge as she
dared, so that she could look into the street
below.
Aimee's gaze slides down an electric cable
into their neighbors' back yard, which is ob
scured by trees. She imagines that they have,
hidden beneath the foliage, a patio and a grill
and a swimming pool; suburbia in the middle
of the city. On Sundays the mother will set out
brunch on a picnic table while the father
reads the comics in the hammock and the lit
tle boy climbs trees and gets his knees dirty.
Aimee has never seen the little boy, but she
knows he is there. Once, while out on the fire
escape, she heard him sneeze a 5-year-old's
sharp sneeze into the still summer night, and
her pulse had leaped with a sudden affection.
Aimee reaches up to loosen the knot of
hair at her neck. Her fingers get caught in the
intricacies of her wedding veil, and she un

and then gets caught in the trees in the neigh
bors' back yard. At last, she feels lighter.
Gabriel sits on the bottom rung of the
ladder to the roof, his head in his
hands. His fingers have worked
through his hair to the roots, as though he has
to hold his head in place. Beside him, Zoe's
voice slips through the cracks in his fingers,
blessedly matter-of-fact.
"There's only one thing to do," she says.
"What's that?"
"You have to go up there and talk to her."
"1 can't."
"Why not?"
"I think she wants to be left alone. I'm will
ing to respect that."
"I'm not," Zoe says. "I'm mad as hell at her
for doing this to you "
Gabriel is glad that Zoe finally says what
he's been unable to articulate, even though a
rock of anger and hurt is lodged so deep with
in him he wonders if it can ever be shifted. Se
cretly, he's glad that he only invited Zoe and
Kenneth to the wedding.
When Aimee agreed to get married, she
made it explicit that she didn't want a big
wedding. She said that they couldn t afford it,
which was true. But Gabriel aiso had the feel
ing that if they had a church wedding she'd
have to invite her mother, whom she didn't
want to see. It didn't seem right to him that he
invite his parents if Aimee's weren't coming,
st> he only mentioned how business in the
portrait studio was doing in his latest letter to
them.
Gabriel knew that in the early years of their
marriage, his parents had been optimistic and
planned on having three kids: two to replace
themselves and one that was adopted. Ten
years later they just had one kid, the adopted
one. By that time they were middle-aged, and
Gabriel imagined his childhood like a family
portrait he took once of a young couple and
their son. The kid had refused to sit still, so
he'd ended up as a smudge across his parents'
knees. Gabriel's parents owned a black and
white television, which became Gabriel's
baby sitter, and siblings, and playmates. He
still dreams in black-and-white.
Gabriel imagines the print of a newspaper
headline: FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLED
TO GET BRIDE DOWN FROM

docs it and lets it
go. It drifts down
ward until it is only
the size of feather,

ROOF. He almost feels like laughing,
but Zoe is deadly serious.
"Gabriel," she says, "1 know

you re bad at confrontations.
But you've got to go up there
and talk to her."
"What if she

doesn't want to talk to
me?"
"That must be it,"
Zoe says. "You're afraid
to talk to her. You
thought that you knew
her better than vou reallv

do.
That was the problem with
Zoe. She knew him too well,
for eight years, since they were
undergrads in college together.
In college, Gabriel had wanted
to be a photographer. He had

gotten his MFA, and planned to
free-lance in Europe. Zoe would
own an art gallery, and when he got fa-

rnous, he would only show his work in her
gallery. But he ended up working in a portrait
studio, covering family gatherings, weddings,
graduations and other random joyous occa
sions.
One day, Aimee walked into the shop. She
wanted to get a portrait taken of herself, to
send to her mother. Apparently this was
something she did every month.
"I usually take the picture myself," she said,
taking a photograph out of her purse, "but it
always turns out pretty bad. See?"
The photograph was of Aimee sitting on a
park bench, the blur of a biker passing behind
her. The outlines of her face looked wavery;
apparently the camera had been held at arm's
length. Gabriel suddenly had the image of
Aimee's mother at home with a box of bad
Polaroids, all slightly out-of-focus.
"Why don't you just go visit her?" he sug
gested.
"Visit my mother?" Aimee laughed. "She
just wants to make sure I'm OK."
Gabriel positioned her hands in her lap,
the right over the left, and then changed his
mind and switched them. Her wrists were re
markably light; bird's wrists, he thought. He
noticed that she wasn't wearing any rings. Be
hind the camera, he adjusted the lens until
she came into focus.
He was used to making loose conversation
with his customers, to relax them. When it
came to young women, he would ask whether
they had boyfriends, and their eyes would
crinkle with embarrassment as ihey told him,
apologetically, no. It worked, though; in their
pictures they looked as though they were
smiling. This time, when Gabriel asked
Aimee that question, he really wanted to
know.
"No, I don't," she said, looking steadily at
him.
As for his own pictures, Gabriel keeps his
best efforts in a portfolio, just in case someday
he'll need one. Occasionally he will run some
of them past Zoe. He does this more out of
habit than necessity. Both of them know that
he probably isn't going to make it in the way
he thought he would. He goes to Zoe because
she knew what he was like when he used to be
lieve that. She is also his harshest critic; not
only of his work, but everything he does.
Which is why she was the first person he told
that he was getting married.
Zoe tilted her head and he could see the sil

ver earrings in her left car, a delicate row
of punctuation marks along the carti

lage.
'Why now?" she said.
"1 just think it's the right
time." He watched her twist

the rings on her fingers
"How's Kenneth?" he

asked, which
was what he

always
said
when
there
was

an awkward pause between them.
Mentioning Kenneth seemed to snap
something in Zoe. "He's fine, and you know
it, so stop trying to change the subject.
Gabriel, you're getting married to a woman
you've only known for six months."
"It's strange, but I feel like I know a lot
about her. I probably know her even better
than I know you."
"She's probably a lot less complicated."
Zoe's lips tightened at the corners after she'd
said that, as though she regretted what she'd
said. "Why don't you and Aimee come over
for dinner?" she suggested. "I'd like to meet
her. Really."
"Then there's something I should tell you
about her."
"What, does she turn into a pumpkin at
midnight or something?"
"No, she's a vegetarian."
Gabriel remembers the photograph Aimee
took of herself and how the bad focus made
her look like a ghost caught in the sunlight.
Sometimes he already feels like she's drifting
out of his field of vision. Right now, what he
wants most is to see her, to make sure she
hasn't disappeared entirely from his life. But
first he has to make sure she wants to see him.
"Will you go up?" he asks Zoe.
Zoe measures him up for a half-second,
lust when he's certain that she's going to
refuse, that she's going to go off on another
one of her tirades, she rises to her feet. "Sure,"
she says, and as she passes him up the ladder,
her skirt whispers cool against his face.
As she steps onto the roof, Zoe thinks
she can understand why Aimee chose
this place to escape. There's nothing to
impede the view in all directions. The park is
a green smudge on the horizon, and the
breeze lifted off the ocean turns the sky above
it hazy blue. Rising from the welter of build
ings and houses, all running together in the
hum of traffic, is the university clock tower's
thin spire.
Zoe could see the tower from her window
when she was a student at the city university;
it oriented her every quarter of an hour no
matter where she lived on campus. Once, she
counted the twelve chimes trickling through
the darkness of her room below her breath so
that she wouldn't wake Gabriel. That was the
first time she had slept with him. It was his
first time but not hers, although the memory
of hers still made her so

upset she'd rather
forget
i t

ever happened. She'd been far too young and
insecure, and the day afterward she had been
so angry that she went out and pierced her
ears six times, four on the left side and two on
the right. With Gabriel it was like starting
over again.
Zoe shades her eyes against the sun and
sees Aimee sitting at the very edge of the roof.
She figures that the gravel crunching beneath
her feet is warning enough, but just in case,
she says as she approaches, "The view from
here is great, isn't it?"
"It's a long way down," Aimee says, causing
Zoe to look at her sharply.
Zoe takes a cigarette and a lighter from her
pocket. "Do you mind if 1 smoke?"
"No."
Zoe lights the cigarette, hesitates and then
holds it out to Aimee.
Aimee takes a tentative drag as though
she's kissing someone for the first time.
"Would you do this to Gabriel?" she asks Zoe.
"Seriously, would you do this to him?"
Zoe laughs. "But you see, I'd never be in
the situation where I could do it in the first
place."
She wonders whether Aimee knows what
had caused her and Gabriel to break up, with
in the one month they tried living together.
This was after Gabriel had gotten his masters
and she started working in an art gallery
downtown. They lived in the apartment
Gabriel has now, although he used one of the
rooms as a darkroom. He had been looking
for a job for weeks; on rainy days when Zoe
came back from work, she would stuff her wet
shoes with want-ad sections from four differ
ent newspapers. Then she found out that he'd
gotten a job as a photographer's assistant at a
portrait studio, but was thinking of turning it
down.
"What's wrong with it?" she asked. "It's
nearby, it pays well, you get to dabble in
smelly chemicals. What more could you
want?"
"It's just not what I expected to be doing
with my life, that's all."
"Neither did 1."
He looked at her keenly. "You know, it
hasn't been easy for me to sit and watch you
pick up tabs at dinner or pay the rent because
I don't have a job."
"That was a choice you made when you de
cided to do this," she said, scattering a stack of
photographs on the table. Some pictures, she
realized, were of herself.
"You don't understand this."
"Are you saying that I can't understand
this? That I can't understand because I only sit
in an office and sell paintings all day, that I
can't know what you're going through?"
"Yes," he said. "1 don't think you can ever
understand, and I've tried to convince my
self that it's OK, that we can work through
this, because there's no one else I can think
of being with except for you."
For a moment that

completely silenced her. "Gabriel," she said
then, gently. "It's not me you're thinking of
when you say that."
She moved out the next week.
Neither of them acknowledge anymore
that they actually were involved enough at
one point in time to have lived together. They
chalk that month up as a failed experiment. In
the four years since then, some small things
have changed. Now when they go out for
lunch, they split the bill equally. When Zoe
goes to his apartment now, she feels an odd
tug of belonging, even though the place hard
ly looks the same anymore. She chose that
painting for his and Aimee's wedding present
as carefully as though it had been for her own
home. The fact that Gabriel still shows her his
photographs touches her in a way she can't
explain, but is thankful for.
"When I woke up this morning," Aimee
says,"I couldn't remember what I'd dreamed
about. I could only remember what I'd felt,
this strange kind of hesitation. Like I was
holding my breath. I changed into my dress,
and when I came out of the bathroom he was
pretending he was asleep even though he was
awake, you know what I mean?"
"I do," Zoe replies.
"I felt like he was waiting for me to do or
say something. Something that would let him
know that I felt that this day was different. But
1 didn't. I didn't feel like today was any differ
ent from yesterday, or tomorrow either. As I
looked at him, I felt kind of what I'd felt in my
dream, this sort of inability to recognize any
thing. This inability to breathe. As though
everything that mattered to me was narrowed
down to this one feeling, or thought, or idea.
I had to get out of there."
"And?"
"And so I came up here. I don't feel like I'm
in a specific place or a time when I'm here. It's
as if this could have happened yesterday, or it
could have happened tomorrow."
"But it didn't. It happened today." Zoe cor
rects herself. "It's happening now."
Aimee grinds out the cigarette on the grav
el.
"May I?" Zoe asks, low.
For a moment, Aimee looks at the palms of
her hands. She shakes flecks of ash from her
fingers. "OK," she finally says.
Zoe stands up and goes to the other end of
the roof. Gabriel is where she left him, seated
on the bottom rung of the ladder. He glances
up as she descends and then gets to his feet
when she reaches the landing.
"It's OK," she says. "You can go on up."
Gabriel moves past her in a rush of air vi
brant with tension and uncertainty. Zoe
shades her eyes against the sun as she looks
upwards. She thinks she can see Aimee stand
ing at the edge of the roof, and that Aimee ex
tends her hand to him. He takes it, and then
he is gone from sight.
Zoe climbs through the window into the
bathroom, the bedroom, the living room,
where Kenneth is sitting on the couch with
the bottle of Guinness. She sits down next to
him. His right arm lies across the back of the
couch, and she lets her head rest against his
shoulder. Together they look at the glass of the
painting opposite them, as though in their
twin reflection they can see what's going on
over their heads.

The elevator is out of order, so they have
to use the stairs. Zoe is worried that
they will be late for the wedding.
"How can we be late?" Kenneth says.
"We're the only guests, besides the minister."
He pauses to consider whether a minister can
be called a guest.
Then he follows Zoe up the stairs, focusing
on the Hash of her ankles revealed by the rise
and fall of her skirt. He lags behind a little be
cause he's carrying the wedding present,
which is a painting. It's an abstract watercol
or that looks like someone went amok with
paint in a prison cell. Kenneth thinks that
even he could do a better job painting the in
side of somebody's bathroom, but when he
told Zoe that, she refused to speak to him for
a day. He wonders ifZoe is still mad at him lor
turning the alarm clock off this morning and
promptly falling asleep.
They have to wait a long time before
Gabriel opens the door of the apartment. Al
though he's wearing suit trousers and a but
ton-down shirt, his collar is twisted and his
hair falls uncombed over his forehead.
"Let me guess," Kenneth says. "Your alarm
didn't go off either."
Gabriel shakes his head as Kenneth and
Zoe move past him into the living room. Ken
neth leans the painting against the wall oppo
site the couch. It is when he notices how still
the air is, how frozen the room looks, that he
realizes something is wrong.
Zoe reaches up and straightens Gabriel's
collar. "Where's Aimee?" she asks.
"She's on the roof."
"On the roof?"
"She won't come down."
Kenneth tries to think of something com
forting to say. "It's probably just nerves. You
know, pre-wedding jitters."
"I don't know what to call it." Gabriel's
voice is taut.
"What you need is a drink," Kenneth says.
Neither Gabriel nor Zoe reply, so Kenneth
goes into the kitchen.
Kenneth believes that you can tell some
one's personality from the contents of their
refrigerator. Today there is only a wilted head
of lettuce and a bottle of Guinness in
Gabriel's; he figures this is a sign that Aimee is
taking over. When he'd first known Gabriel,
there had always been the same three things:
pastrami, onions and beer, like primary col
ors.
Kenneth knows that Zoe likes to tell her
friends that he's a painter. He also knows that
she doesn't specify that he's a house painter,
which he thinks is amusing because they first
met when he painted Gabriel's kitchen last
year. His first day on the job, Gabriel and Zoe
had argued whether the paint color should be
pearl gray or cornflower blue; pearl gray,
Gabriel's choice, won out. Kenneth offered
up no opinion but had watched Zoe's eyes
darken with frustration. Because of the way
they argued he was sure that Gabriel and Zoe

were a couple; they assured him they weren't.
Zoe started dropping by the apartment when
Gabriel wasn't there. She always seemed to
catch Kenneth when he was taking a break, so
it didn't look like he was working at all. He
and Zoe first made love one afternoon when
Gabriel was at work, on his kitchen floor.
When Kenneth returns to the living room,
no one is there. He can hear voices, though,
and he follows them into the bedroom and
then the bathroom. The window is open, and
Zoe and Gabriel are on the fire escape landing
outside. There's only room for two people on
the landing, so Kenneth sits on the win
dowsill. He sticks his head out of the window
and looks up. He thinks that he catches a
glimpse of something white, something that
could be a face or a hand or the edge of a skirt,
before it disappears from the edge of the roof.
No one seems to have seen this except for
him.
"I called half an hour ago and canceled,"
Gabriel is saying.
Kenneth wonders if canceling a minister is
as easy as canceling a doctor's appointment,
and if you're asked if you'd like to reschedule.
"Canceled!" Zoe says. "What did you do
that for?"
"I didn't want him to get here and have to

Gabriel shakes liis head as Kenneth and Zoe
move past him into the living room. Kenneth
leans the painting against the wall opposite
the couch. It is when he notices how still the
air is, how frozen the room looks, that he re
alizes something is wrong.

wait. I didn't want to have to think about that,
on top of everything else."
"How long do you think you'll have to
wait?" Kenneth says. He sticks his head out
the window again and projects loudly to
wards the roof, "She'll come down when she
gets hungry."
Zoe glares at him to let him know that she
doesn't appreciate his sense of humor. Ken
neth gets the feeling that he's being shut out,
as though he's at home and everyone else is
out getting drunk. So he retreats to the living
room and settles himself on the couch with
the bottle of Guinness. He looks at the paint
ing leaning against the wall, shifting a little so
the glare from the glass covering it doesn't get
into his eyes. It's supposed to be from both
himself and Zoe, although Zoe was the one
who spent a weekend on the telephone nego-

tiating with the dealer. She also paid
more for it, which Kenneth thinks is
only fair because she's the one who's
known Gabriel since college. Nei
ther of them have known Aimee for
very long, just a few months.

Kenneth didn't think much of Aimee
when he met her, that night Zoe invited her
and Gabriel over for dinner. She reminded
him of a paper doll, looking like she'd blow

away if you so much as sneezed in her direc
tion. He would never have guessed that
Gabriel and Aimee were engaged just by look
ing at them. Then again, he wondered if his
bearings were generally off when it came to
figuring out the more complex relationships
between people. He didn't even know exactly
how close Gabriel and Zoe were, although he
suspected that something must have gone on
at some point within the 10 years of their
friendship.
Only Kenneth knew the preparations Zoe
went through that evening Gabriel and
Aimee came over for dinner, from ordering
an arrangement of flowers to going down
town twice to change the wine. Ten minutes
before Gabriel and Aimee were due to arrive,
she was looking through her closet for some
thing to wear, tossing half the clothes out in

the process.
"Z," he said; this was what he called her
whenever she had her back arched like a ruf
fled cat, "it's OK. Everything's going to be
OK."
"What if she doesn't like artichokes or
beans? I mean, what if she's some sort of
weird breed of vegetarian who only eats leafy
green vegetables?"
"Then we'll just have the flowers and the
Zinfandel."
Zoe wadded up a silk blouse and threw it at
him, but on second thought, went to retrieve
it. He thought it a good sign that she didn't
twist away when he put his hands around her
waist.
"Don't," she said. "I'm trying to get
dressed."
"I don't want you to get dressed."

"I want
you," she said,
"to go find some matches for the candles.
What if they're early? 1 bet they'll be early. I'll
bet that she's the kind of person who has to be
everywhere on time."
But Gabriel and Aimee were five minutes
late, during which Zoe moved distractedly
between the kitchen and the living room. On
the couch with his eyes closed, Kenneth lis
tened to the sound of her watch intensify and
recede.
Kenneth supposes that he never really took
Gabriel and Aimee's wedding seriously in the
first place. They didn't want any presents, and
they didn't invite any other guests, not even
their parents. From what Kenneth could
gather, Gabriel's parents lived on the other
side of the country, and Aimee wasn't very
close to her mother. They didn't want to go to
a church or city hall. Kenneth supposes that
they wouldn't have hired a minister if they
could have gotten away with it. The stunt that
Aimee is pulling off now seems to be less of a
hitch in plans than a natural conclusion that
they were moving toward all the time. Hut
Kenneth knows that Gabriel must be going
through hell and that Zoe is trying to console
him as best she can. For that, and for the fact
that he's lost an entire morning of work, he
thinks that Aimee is being pretty damn child
ish.
Ha, Aimee thinks as Kenneth's voice
carries up to the roof. She'll come
down when she gets hungry. They
didn't know how long she could go without
eating. She'd gone for an entire day without
eating something more substantial than a let
tuce and margarine sandwich, which had
been practically her sole diet in her all-girls
high school. "You are what you eat," her
mother told her, and she'd believed it ever
since that day in ninth grade, watching An
nette Hoffman bite into a cupcake with vanil
la frosting. She had always thought of Annette
Hoffman as a fat white girl; she mentally sub
stituted "cupcake" for "girl" and giggled to
herself whenever Annette wore pleated skirts.
She started seeing other girls at school the
same way. Emily DeVries was a thin black
licorice whip, Sara Stanley a deviled egg, Jean
nie Martin an orange fish-stick. Aimee was
two pieces of white bread with a limp piece of
lettuce in between that left a smear of green
on her front teeth.
Aimee still has trouble eating with people
she doesn't know well, like Zoe and Kenneth.

When she and Gabriel had dinner at Zoe's
place, she hardly ate anything. While Zoe
talked about the extravagant cost of wed
dings, Aimee played with her artichoke
heart-and-kidney-bean salad. She wondered
whether Zoe was trying to insinuate some
thing about being a vegetarian with the food.
By the time Zoe started talking about wed
ding dresses she'd seen in second-hand sto
ries, Aimee excused herself to the bathroom
to eat the white bread and lettuce sandwich
she had brought with her. She resisted going
through the medicine cabinet to see what
contraceptives Zoe and Kenneth used.
Aimee saw when they met that Zoe could
tell Aimee had sucked her thumb until she
was 4, and chewed her nails when she was 8,
and picked her cuticles ragged when she was
12, and by the time she was 16 had grown so
tall that no boy wanted to dance with her.
After that first meeting with Zoe, Aimee
had sincerely wanted to like her. She wanted
to so much that she let Zoe take her shopping
for a wedding dress, though all the time while
they looked through racks in thrift stores,
Aimee wondered how prudent it was to take
the fashion advice of someone whose en
trance was always preceded by the sound of
her jewelry. But she envied Zoe some things,
especially how long she'd known Gabriel. Zoe
was able to say remember in those days when
Aimee couldn't even say remember last year.
Aimee had just moved to the city last sum
mer. She had a job as a secretary, but was van
quished on the first day by a malfunctioning
coffee machine. She was on a bus heading
downtown, wondering how much longer she
could last without a job when she first saw
Gabriel. He was sitting two seats ahead of her.
She'd been intrigued by the back of his neck,
the way the ends of his hair curled, the crisp
ness of his shirt collar. She thought that she
could wake up in the morning looking at the
back of that neck.
As streets passed by, she forgot which stop

she was supposed to get off at. She just want
ed to see what his face looked like. When he
got off the bus, she followed him. He walked
as if he were used to mid-afternoon crowds
like these, weaving effortlessly between
tourists and natives and people like herself
who would never quite fit in, who would al
ways have an air of transience as they passed
other people. He ducked into a shop, a por
trait studio, and Aimee decided to come back
the next day, prepared.
Aimee thinks that she can see the portrait
studio from her vantage point on the roof.
She can also see the crumbling movie theater
that occasionally shows Italian films without
subtitles, so Gabriel has to paraphrase every
thing over the armrest to her. The park she
used to walk through, her eyes averted from
the various couples necking on the lawn, until
she and Gabriel became one of those couples,
and then she stopped caring anymore.
Aimee tucks her knees up to her chin and
pushes her wedding veil back from her face. It
actually is an elaborate lace curtain, pur
chased from the same thrift store where she
got her wedding dress. When she closes her
eyes, she can feel the sun pressing against her
face. The only other time that she remembers
facing the sun for so long was years ago.
On the first day of school, her sixth-grade
class played a game in which everyone paired
off and one person led the other, blindfolded,
across the schoolyard. Aimee's partner was a
girl named Susie Parker. Susie had led Aimee
around the playground, her hand a tenuous
link to the rest of the world. Aimee measured
every tentative step by the warmth radiating
from the asphalt. She could see sunbursts im
printed on the insides of her eyelids. Then
Susie stranded her in the boys' bathroom.
Aimee had woken up this morning feeling
the remnants of a dream slip away into her
pillow. She rolled over and saw her wedding
dress, propped up on a chair in the corner. It
looked like a debutante's gown from the '50s,

stiff enough to stand up on its own.
Aimee slipped out from under the covers,
careful not to disturb Gabriel. She went into
the bathroom, where she put on the dress and
arranged the veil. Then she stood with her
back pressed against the door, so she could
look at her reflection in the glass. She looked
like a little girl playing dress-up in her moth
er's clothes. Only, she reminded herself, she
would have never fit into any of her mother's
clothes.
When she stepped back into the bedroom,
Gabriel had shifted his position in bed. His
back was turned towards her. An alertness in
his breathing told her that he wasn't asleep.
She noticed that his hair had grown long
enough to cover the back of his neck. She
stood there, looking at him so long that his
image blurred.
Then she turned around and went back
into the bathroom. She clung to the sink until
her head cleared. She thought she might feel
better if she got some more air, so she climbed
out of the window onto the fire escape. Still
she felt closed in, so she climbed up the ladder
to the roof. She sat as close to the edge as she
dared, so that she could look into the street
below.
Aimee's gaze slides down an electric cable
into their neighbors' back yard, which is ob
scured by trees. She imagines that they have,
hidden beneath the foliage, a patio and a grill
and a swimming pool; suburbia in the middle
of the city. On Sundays the mother will set out
brunch on a picnic table while the father
reads the comics in the hammock and the lit
tle boy climbs trees and gets his knees dirty.
Aimee has never seen the little boy, but she
knows he is there. Once, while out on the fire
escape, she heard him sneeze a 5-year-old's
sharp sneeze into the still summer night, and
her pulse had leaped with a sudden affection.
Aimee reaches up to loosen the knot of
hair at her neck. Her fingers get caught in the
intricacies of her wedding veil, and she un

and then gets caught in the trees in the neigh
bors' back yard. At last, she feels lighter.
Gabriel sits on the bottom rung of the
ladder to the roof, his head in his
hands. His fingers have worked
through his hair to the roots, as though he has
to hold his head in place. Beside him, Zoe's
voice slips through the cracks in his fingers,
blessedly matter-of-fact.
"There's only one thing to do," she says.
"What's that?"
"You have to go up there and talk to her."
"1 can't."
"Why not?"
"I think she wants to be left alone. I'm will
ing to respect that."
"I'm not," Zoe says. "I'm mad as hell at her
for doing this to you "
Gabriel is glad that Zoe finally says what
he's been unable to articulate, even though a
rock of anger and hurt is lodged so deep with
in him he wonders if it can ever be shifted. Se
cretly, he's glad that he only invited Zoe and
Kenneth to the wedding.
When Aimee agreed to get married, she
made it explicit that she didn't want a big
wedding. She said that they couldn t afford it,
which was true. But Gabriel aiso had the feel
ing that if they had a church wedding she'd
have to invite her mother, whom she didn't
want to see. It didn't seem right to him that he
invite his parents if Aimee's weren't coming,
st> he only mentioned how business in the
portrait studio was doing in his latest letter to
them.
Gabriel knew that in the early years of their
marriage, his parents had been optimistic and
planned on having three kids: two to replace
themselves and one that was adopted. Ten
years later they just had one kid, the adopted
one. By that time they were middle-aged, and
Gabriel imagined his childhood like a family
portrait he took once of a young couple and
their son. The kid had refused to sit still, so
he'd ended up as a smudge across his parents'
knees. Gabriel's parents owned a black and
white television, which became Gabriel's
baby sitter, and siblings, and playmates. He
still dreams in black-and-white.
Gabriel imagines the print of a newspaper
headline: FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLED
TO GET BRIDE DOWN FROM

docs it and lets it
go. It drifts down
ward until it is only
the size of feather,

ROOF. He almost feels like laughing,
but Zoe is deadly serious.
"Gabriel," she says, "1 know

you re bad at confrontations.
But you've got to go up there
and talk to her."
"What if she

doesn't want to talk to
me?"
"That must be it,"
Zoe says. "You're afraid
to talk to her. You
thought that you knew
her better than vou reallv

do.
That was the problem with
Zoe. She knew him too well,
for eight years, since they were
undergrads in college together.
In college, Gabriel had wanted
to be a photographer. He had

gotten his MFA, and planned to
free-lance in Europe. Zoe would
own an art gallery, and when he got fa-

rnous, he would only show his work in her
gallery. But he ended up working in a portrait
studio, covering family gatherings, weddings,
graduations and other random joyous occa
sions.
One day, Aimee walked into the shop. She
wanted to get a portrait taken of herself, to
send to her mother. Apparently this was
something she did every month.
"I usually take the picture myself," she said,
taking a photograph out of her purse, "but it
always turns out pretty bad. See?"
The photograph was of Aimee sitting on a
park bench, the blur of a biker passing behind
her. The outlines of her face looked wavery;
apparently the camera had been held at arm's
length. Gabriel suddenly had the image of
Aimee's mother at home with a box of bad
Polaroids, all slightly out-of-focus.
"Why don't you just go visit her?" he sug
gested.
"Visit my mother?" Aimee laughed. "She
just wants to make sure I'm OK."
Gabriel positioned her hands in her lap,
the right over the left, and then changed his
mind and switched them. Her wrists were re
markably light; bird's wrists, he thought. He
noticed that she wasn't wearing any rings. Be
hind the camera, he adjusted the lens until
she came into focus.
He was used to making loose conversation
with his customers, to relax them. When it
came to young women, he would ask whether
they had boyfriends, and their eyes would
crinkle with embarrassment as ihey told him,
apologetically, no. It worked, though; in their
pictures they looked as though they were
smiling. This time, when Gabriel asked
Aimee that question, he really wanted to
know.
"No, I don't," she said, looking steadily at
him.
As for his own pictures, Gabriel keeps his
best efforts in a portfolio, just in case someday
he'll need one. Occasionally he will run some
of them past Zoe. He does this more out of
habit than necessity. Both of them know that
he probably isn't going to make it in the way
he thought he would. He goes to Zoe because
she knew what he was like when he used to be
lieve that. She is also his harshest critic; not
only of his work, but everything he does.
Which is why she was the first person he told
that he was getting married.
Zoe tilted her head and he could see the sil

ver earrings in her left car, a delicate row
of punctuation marks along the carti

lage.
'Why now?" she said.
"1 just think it's the right
time." He watched her twist

the rings on her fingers
"How's Kenneth?" he

asked, which
was what he

always
said
when
there
was

an awkward pause between them.
Mentioning Kenneth seemed to snap
something in Zoe. "He's fine, and you know
it, so stop trying to change the subject.
Gabriel, you're getting married to a woman
you've only known for six months."
"It's strange, but I feel like I know a lot
about her. I probably know her even better
than I know you."
"She's probably a lot less complicated."
Zoe's lips tightened at the corners after she'd
said that, as though she regretted what she'd
said. "Why don't you and Aimee come over
for dinner?" she suggested. "I'd like to meet
her. Really."
"Then there's something I should tell you
about her."
"What, does she turn into a pumpkin at
midnight or something?"
"No, she's a vegetarian."
Gabriel remembers the photograph Aimee
took of herself and how the bad focus made
her look like a ghost caught in the sunlight.
Sometimes he already feels like she's drifting
out of his field of vision. Right now, what he
wants most is to see her, to make sure she
hasn't disappeared entirely from his life. But
first he has to make sure she wants to see him.
"Will you go up?" he asks Zoe.
Zoe measures him up for a half-second,
lust when he's certain that she's going to
refuse, that she's going to go off on another
one of her tirades, she rises to her feet. "Sure,"
she says, and as she passes him up the ladder,
her skirt whispers cool against his face.
As she steps onto the roof, Zoe thinks
she can understand why Aimee chose
this place to escape. There's nothing to
impede the view in all directions. The park is
a green smudge on the horizon, and the
breeze lifted off the ocean turns the sky above
it hazy blue. Rising from the welter of build
ings and houses, all running together in the
hum of traffic, is the university clock tower's
thin spire.
Zoe could see the tower from her window
when she was a student at the city university;
it oriented her every quarter of an hour no
matter where she lived on campus. Once, she
counted the twelve chimes trickling through
the darkness of her room below her breath so
that she wouldn't wake Gabriel. That was the
first time she had slept with him. It was his
first time but not hers, although the memory
of hers still made her so

upset she'd rather
forget
i t

ever happened. She'd been far too young and
insecure, and the day afterward she had been
so angry that she went out and pierced her
ears six times, four on the left side and two on
the right. With Gabriel it was like starting
over again.
Zoe shades her eyes against the sun and
sees Aimee sitting at the very edge of the roof.
She figures that the gravel crunching beneath
her feet is warning enough, but just in case,
she says as she approaches, "The view from
here is great, isn't it?"
"It's a long way down," Aimee says, causing
Zoe to look at her sharply.
Zoe takes a cigarette and a lighter from her
pocket. "Do you mind if 1 smoke?"
"No."
Zoe lights the cigarette, hesitates and then
holds it out to Aimee.
Aimee takes a tentative drag as though
she's kissing someone for the first time.
"Would you do this to Gabriel?" she asks Zoe.
"Seriously, would you do this to him?"
Zoe laughs. "But you see, I'd never be in
the situation where I could do it in the first
place."
She wonders whether Aimee knows what
had caused her and Gabriel to break up, with
in the one month they tried living together.
This was after Gabriel had gotten his masters
and she started working in an art gallery
downtown. They lived in the apartment
Gabriel has now, although he used one of the
rooms as a darkroom. He had been looking
for a job for weeks; on rainy days when Zoe
came back from work, she would stuff her wet
shoes with want-ad sections from four differ
ent newspapers. Then she found out that he'd
gotten a job as a photographer's assistant at a
portrait studio, but was thinking of turning it
down.
"What's wrong with it?" she asked. "It's
nearby, it pays well, you get to dabble in
smelly chemicals. What more could you
want?"
"It's just not what I expected to be doing
with my life, that's all."
"Neither did 1."
He looked at her keenly. "You know, it
hasn't been easy for me to sit and watch you
pick up tabs at dinner or pay the rent because
I don't have a job."
"That was a choice you made when you de
cided to do this," she said, scattering a stack of
photographs on the table. Some pictures, she
realized, were of herself.
"You don't understand this."
"Are you saying that I can't understand
this? That I can't understand because I only sit
in an office and sell paintings all day, that I
can't know what you're going through?"
"Yes," he said. "1 don't think you can ever
understand, and I've tried to convince my
self that it's OK, that we can work through
this, because there's no one else I can think
of being with except for you."
For a moment that

completely silenced her. "Gabriel," she said
then, gently. "It's not me you're thinking of
when you say that."
She moved out the next week.
Neither of them acknowledge anymore
that they actually were involved enough at
one point in time to have lived together. They
chalk that month up as a failed experiment. In
the four years since then, some small things
have changed. Now when they go out for
lunch, they split the bill equally. When Zoe
goes to his apartment now, she feels an odd
tug of belonging, even though the place hard
ly looks the same anymore. She chose that
painting for his and Aimee's wedding present
as carefully as though it had been for her own
home. The fact that Gabriel still shows her his
photographs touches her in a way she can't
explain, but is thankful for.
"When I woke up this morning," Aimee
says,"I couldn't remember what I'd dreamed
about. I could only remember what I'd felt,
this strange kind of hesitation. Like I was
holding my breath. I changed into my dress,
and when I came out of the bathroom he was
pretending he was asleep even though he was
awake, you know what I mean?"
"I do," Zoe replies.
"I felt like he was waiting for me to do or
say something. Something that would let him
know that I felt that this day was different. But
1 didn't. I didn't feel like today was any differ
ent from yesterday, or tomorrow either. As I
looked at him, I felt kind of what I'd felt in my
dream, this sort of inability to recognize any
thing. This inability to breathe. As though
everything that mattered to me was narrowed
down to this one feeling, or thought, or idea.
I had to get out of there."
"And?"
"And so I came up here. I don't feel like I'm
in a specific place or a time when I'm here. It's
as if this could have happened yesterday, or it
could have happened tomorrow."
"But it didn't. It happened today." Zoe cor
rects herself. "It's happening now."
Aimee grinds out the cigarette on the grav
el.
"May I?" Zoe asks, low.
For a moment, Aimee looks at the palms of
her hands. She shakes flecks of ash from her
fingers. "OK," she finally says.
Zoe stands up and goes to the other end of
the roof. Gabriel is where she left him, seated
on the bottom rung of the ladder. He glances
up as she descends and then gets to his feet
when she reaches the landing.
"It's OK," she says. "You can go on up."
Gabriel moves past her in a rush of air vi
brant with tension and uncertainty. Zoe
shades her eyes against the sun as she looks
upwards. She thinks she can see Aimee stand
ing at the edge of the roof, and that Aimee ex
tends her hand to him. He takes it, and then
he is gone from sight.
Zoe climbs through the window into the
bathroom, the bedroom, the living room,
where Kenneth is sitting on the couch with
the bottle of Guinness. She sits down next to
him. His right arm lies across the back of the
couch, and she lets her head rest against his
shoulder. Together they look at the glass of the
painting opposite them, as though in their
twin reflection they can see what's going on
over their heads.

The elevator is out of order, so they have
to use the stairs. Zoe is worried that
they will be late for the wedding.
"How can we be late?" Kenneth says.
"We're the only guests, besides the minister."
He pauses to consider whether a minister can
be called a guest.
Then he follows Zoe up the stairs, focusing
on the Hash of her ankles revealed by the rise
and fall of her skirt. He lags behind a little be
cause he's carrying the wedding present,
which is a painting. It's an abstract watercol
or that looks like someone went amok with
paint in a prison cell. Kenneth thinks that
even he could do a better job painting the in
side of somebody's bathroom, but when he
told Zoe that, she refused to speak to him for
a day. He wonders ifZoe is still mad at him lor
turning the alarm clock off this morning and
promptly falling asleep.
They have to wait a long time before
Gabriel opens the door of the apartment. Al
though he's wearing suit trousers and a but
ton-down shirt, his collar is twisted and his
hair falls uncombed over his forehead.
"Let me guess," Kenneth says. "Your alarm
didn't go off either."
Gabriel shakes his head as Kenneth and
Zoe move past him into the living room. Ken
neth leans the painting against the wall oppo
site the couch. It is when he notices how still
the air is, how frozen the room looks, that he
realizes something is wrong.
Zoe reaches up and straightens Gabriel's
collar. "Where's Aimee?" she asks.
"She's on the roof."
"On the roof?"
"She won't come down."
Kenneth tries to think of something com
forting to say. "It's probably just nerves. You
know, pre-wedding jitters."
"I don't know what to call it." Gabriel's
voice is taut.
"What you need is a drink," Kenneth says.
Neither Gabriel nor Zoe reply, so Kenneth
goes into the kitchen.
Kenneth believes that you can tell some
one's personality from the contents of their
refrigerator. Today there is only a wilted head
of lettuce and a bottle of Guinness in
Gabriel's; he figures this is a sign that Aimee is
taking over. When he'd first known Gabriel,
there had always been the same three things:
pastrami, onions and beer, like primary col
ors.
Kenneth knows that Zoe likes to tell her
friends that he's a painter. He also knows that
she doesn't specify that he's a house painter,
which he thinks is amusing because they first
met when he painted Gabriel's kitchen last
year. His first day on the job, Gabriel and Zoe
had argued whether the paint color should be
pearl gray or cornflower blue; pearl gray,
Gabriel's choice, won out. Kenneth offered
up no opinion but had watched Zoe's eyes
darken with frustration. Because of the way
they argued he was sure that Gabriel and Zoe

were a couple; they assured him they weren't.
Zoe started dropping by the apartment when
Gabriel wasn't there. She always seemed to
catch Kenneth when he was taking a break, so
it didn't look like he was working at all. He
and Zoe first made love one afternoon when
Gabriel was at work, on his kitchen floor.
When Kenneth returns to the living room,
no one is there. He can hear voices, though,
and he follows them into the bedroom and
then the bathroom. The window is open, and
Zoe and Gabriel are on the fire escape landing
outside. There's only room for two people on
the landing, so Kenneth sits on the win
dowsill. He sticks his head out of the window
and looks up. He thinks that he catches a
glimpse of something white, something that
could be a face or a hand or the edge of a skirt,
before it disappears from the edge of the roof.
No one seems to have seen this except for
him.
"I called half an hour ago and canceled,"
Gabriel is saying.
Kenneth wonders if canceling a minister is
as easy as canceling a doctor's appointment,
and if you're asked if you'd like to reschedule.
"Canceled!" Zoe says. "What did you do
that for?"
"I didn't want him to get here and have to

Gabriel shakes liis head as Kenneth and Zoe
move past him into the living room. Kenneth
leans the painting against the wall opposite
the couch. It is when he notices how still the
air is, how frozen the room looks, that he re
alizes something is wrong.

wait. I didn't want to have to think about that,
on top of everything else."
"How long do you think you'll have to
wait?" Kenneth says. He sticks his head out
the window again and projects loudly to
wards the roof, "She'll come down when she
gets hungry."
Zoe glares at him to let him know that she
doesn't appreciate his sense of humor. Ken
neth gets the feeling that he's being shut out,
as though he's at home and everyone else is
out getting drunk. So he retreats to the living
room and settles himself on the couch with
the bottle of Guinness. He looks at the paint
ing leaning against the wall, shifting a little so
the glare from the glass covering it doesn't get
into his eyes. It's supposed to be from both
himself and Zoe, although Zoe was the one
who spent a weekend on the telephone nego-

tiating with the dealer. She also paid
more for it, which Kenneth thinks is
only fair because she's the one who's
known Gabriel since college. Nei
ther of them have known Aimee for
very long, just a few months.

Kenneth didn't think much of Aimee
when he met her, that night Zoe invited her
and Gabriel over for dinner. She reminded
him of a paper doll, looking like she'd blow

away if you so much as sneezed in her direc
tion. He would never have guessed that
Gabriel and Aimee were engaged just by look
ing at them. Then again, he wondered if his
bearings were generally off when it came to
figuring out the more complex relationships
between people. He didn't even know exactly
how close Gabriel and Zoe were, although he
suspected that something must have gone on
at some point within the 10 years of their
friendship.
Only Kenneth knew the preparations Zoe
went through that evening Gabriel and
Aimee came over for dinner, from ordering
an arrangement of flowers to going down
town twice to change the wine. Ten minutes
before Gabriel and Aimee were due to arrive,
she was looking through her closet for some
thing to wear, tossing half the clothes out in

the process.
"Z," he said; this was what he called her
whenever she had her back arched like a ruf
fled cat, "it's OK. Everything's going to be
OK."
"What if she doesn't like artichokes or
beans? I mean, what if she's some sort of
weird breed of vegetarian who only eats leafy
green vegetables?"
"Then we'll just have the flowers and the
Zinfandel."
Zoe wadded up a silk blouse and threw it at
him, but on second thought, went to retrieve
it. He thought it a good sign that she didn't
twist away when he put his hands around her
waist.
"Don't," she said. "I'm trying to get
dressed."
"I don't want you to get dressed."

"I want
you," she said,
"to go find some matches for the candles.
What if they're early? 1 bet they'll be early. I'll
bet that she's the kind of person who has to be
everywhere on time."
But Gabriel and Aimee were five minutes
late, during which Zoe moved distractedly
between the kitchen and the living room. On
the couch with his eyes closed, Kenneth lis
tened to the sound of her watch intensify and
recede.
Kenneth supposes that he never really took
Gabriel and Aimee's wedding seriously in the
first place. They didn't want any presents, and
they didn't invite any other guests, not even
their parents. From what Kenneth could
gather, Gabriel's parents lived on the other
side of the country, and Aimee wasn't very
close to her mother. They didn't want to go to
a church or city hall. Kenneth supposes that
they wouldn't have hired a minister if they
could have gotten away with it. The stunt that
Aimee is pulling off now seems to be less of a
hitch in plans than a natural conclusion that
they were moving toward all the time. Hut
Kenneth knows that Gabriel must be going
through hell and that Zoe is trying to console
him as best she can. For that, and for the fact
that he's lost an entire morning of work, he
thinks that Aimee is being pretty damn child
ish.
Ha, Aimee thinks as Kenneth's voice
carries up to the roof. She'll come
down when she gets hungry. They
didn't know how long she could go without
eating. She'd gone for an entire day without
eating something more substantial than a let
tuce and margarine sandwich, which had
been practically her sole diet in her all-girls
high school. "You are what you eat," her
mother told her, and she'd believed it ever
since that day in ninth grade, watching An
nette Hoffman bite into a cupcake with vanil
la frosting. She had always thought of Annette
Hoffman as a fat white girl; she mentally sub
stituted "cupcake" for "girl" and giggled to
herself whenever Annette wore pleated skirts.
She started seeing other girls at school the
same way. Emily DeVries was a thin black
licorice whip, Sara Stanley a deviled egg, Jean
nie Martin an orange fish-stick. Aimee was
two pieces of white bread with a limp piece of
lettuce in between that left a smear of green
on her front teeth.
Aimee still has trouble eating with people
she doesn't know well, like Zoe and Kenneth.

When she and Gabriel had dinner at Zoe's
place, she hardly ate anything. While Zoe
talked about the extravagant cost of wed
dings, Aimee played with her artichoke
heart-and-kidney-bean salad. She wondered
whether Zoe was trying to insinuate some
thing about being a vegetarian with the food.
By the time Zoe started talking about wed
ding dresses she'd seen in second-hand sto
ries, Aimee excused herself to the bathroom
to eat the white bread and lettuce sandwich
she had brought with her. She resisted going
through the medicine cabinet to see what
contraceptives Zoe and Kenneth used.
Aimee saw when they met that Zoe could
tell Aimee had sucked her thumb until she
was 4, and chewed her nails when she was 8,
and picked her cuticles ragged when she was
12, and by the time she was 16 had grown so
tall that no boy wanted to dance with her.
After that first meeting with Zoe, Aimee
had sincerely wanted to like her. She wanted
to so much that she let Zoe take her shopping
for a wedding dress, though all the time while
they looked through racks in thrift stores,
Aimee wondered how prudent it was to take
the fashion advice of someone whose en
trance was always preceded by the sound of
her jewelry. But she envied Zoe some things,
especially how long she'd known Gabriel. Zoe
was able to say remember in those days when
Aimee couldn't even say remember last year.
Aimee had just moved to the city last sum
mer. She had a job as a secretary, but was van
quished on the first day by a malfunctioning
coffee machine. She was on a bus heading
downtown, wondering how much longer she
could last without a job when she first saw
Gabriel. He was sitting two seats ahead of her.
She'd been intrigued by the back of his neck,
the way the ends of his hair curled, the crisp
ness of his shirt collar. She thought that she
could wake up in the morning looking at the
back of that neck.
As streets passed by, she forgot which stop

she was supposed to get off at. She just want
ed to see what his face looked like. When he
got off the bus, she followed him. He walked
as if he were used to mid-afternoon crowds
like these, weaving effortlessly between
tourists and natives and people like herself
who would never quite fit in, who would al
ways have an air of transience as they passed
other people. He ducked into a shop, a por
trait studio, and Aimee decided to come back
the next day, prepared.
Aimee thinks that she can see the portrait
studio from her vantage point on the roof.
She can also see the crumbling movie theater
that occasionally shows Italian films without
subtitles, so Gabriel has to paraphrase every
thing over the armrest to her. The park she
used to walk through, her eyes averted from
the various couples necking on the lawn, until
she and Gabriel became one of those couples,
and then she stopped caring anymore.
Aimee tucks her knees up to her chin and
pushes her wedding veil back from her face. It
actually is an elaborate lace curtain, pur
chased from the same thrift store where she
got her wedding dress. When she closes her
eyes, she can feel the sun pressing against her
face. The only other time that she remembers
facing the sun for so long was years ago.
On the first day of school, her sixth-grade
class played a game in which everyone paired
off and one person led the other, blindfolded,
across the schoolyard. Aimee's partner was a
girl named Susie Parker. Susie had led Aimee
around the playground, her hand a tenuous
link to the rest of the world. Aimee measured
every tentative step by the warmth radiating
from the asphalt. She could see sunbursts im
printed on the insides of her eyelids. Then
Susie stranded her in the boys' bathroom.
Aimee had woken up this morning feeling
the remnants of a dream slip away into her
pillow. She rolled over and saw her wedding
dress, propped up on a chair in the corner. It
looked like a debutante's gown from the '50s,

stiff enough to stand up on its own.
Aimee slipped out from under the covers,
careful not to disturb Gabriel. She went into
the bathroom, where she put on the dress and
arranged the veil. Then she stood with her
back pressed against the door, so she could
look at her reflection in the glass. She looked
like a little girl playing dress-up in her moth
er's clothes. Only, she reminded herself, she
would have never fit into any of her mother's
clothes.
When she stepped back into the bedroom,
Gabriel had shifted his position in bed. His
back was turned towards her. An alertness in
his breathing told her that he wasn't asleep.
She noticed that his hair had grown long
enough to cover the back of his neck. She
stood there, looking at him so long that his
image blurred.
Then she turned around and went back
into the bathroom. She clung to the sink until
her head cleared. She thought she might feel
better if she got some more air, so she climbed
out of the window onto the fire escape. Still
she felt closed in, so she climbed up the ladder
to the roof. She sat as close to the edge as she
dared, so that she could look into the street
below.
Aimee's gaze slides down an electric cable
into their neighbors' back yard, which is ob
scured by trees. She imagines that they have,
hidden beneath the foliage, a patio and a grill
and a swimming pool; suburbia in the middle
of the city. On Sundays the mother will set out
brunch on a picnic table while the father
reads the comics in the hammock and the lit
tle boy climbs trees and gets his knees dirty.
Aimee has never seen the little boy, but she
knows he is there. Once, while out on the fire
escape, she heard him sneeze a 5-year-old's
sharp sneeze into the still summer night, and
her pulse had leaped with a sudden affection.
Aimee reaches up to loosen the knot of
hair at her neck. Her fingers get caught in the
intricacies of her wedding veil, and she un

and then gets caught in the trees in the neigh
bors' back yard. At last, she feels lighter.
Gabriel sits on the bottom rung of the
ladder to the roof, his head in his
hands. His fingers have worked
through his hair to the roots, as though he has
to hold his head in place. Beside him, Zoe's
voice slips through the cracks in his fingers,
blessedly matter-of-fact.
"There's only one thing to do," she says.
"What's that?"
"You have to go up there and talk to her."
"1 can't."
"Why not?"
"I think she wants to be left alone. I'm will
ing to respect that."
"I'm not," Zoe says. "I'm mad as hell at her
for doing this to you "
Gabriel is glad that Zoe finally says what
he's been unable to articulate, even though a
rock of anger and hurt is lodged so deep with
in him he wonders if it can ever be shifted. Se
cretly, he's glad that he only invited Zoe and
Kenneth to the wedding.
When Aimee agreed to get married, she
made it explicit that she didn't want a big
wedding. She said that they couldn t afford it,
which was true. But Gabriel aiso had the feel
ing that if they had a church wedding she'd
have to invite her mother, whom she didn't
want to see. It didn't seem right to him that he
invite his parents if Aimee's weren't coming,
st> he only mentioned how business in the
portrait studio was doing in his latest letter to
them.
Gabriel knew that in the early years of their
marriage, his parents had been optimistic and
planned on having three kids: two to replace
themselves and one that was adopted. Ten
years later they just had one kid, the adopted
one. By that time they were middle-aged, and
Gabriel imagined his childhood like a family
portrait he took once of a young couple and
their son. The kid had refused to sit still, so
he'd ended up as a smudge across his parents'
knees. Gabriel's parents owned a black and
white television, which became Gabriel's
baby sitter, and siblings, and playmates. He
still dreams in black-and-white.
Gabriel imagines the print of a newspaper
headline: FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLED
TO GET BRIDE DOWN FROM

docs it and lets it
go. It drifts down
ward until it is only
the size of feather,

ROOF. He almost feels like laughing,
but Zoe is deadly serious.
"Gabriel," she says, "1 know

you re bad at confrontations.
But you've got to go up there
and talk to her."
"What if she

doesn't want to talk to
me?"
"That must be it,"
Zoe says. "You're afraid
to talk to her. You
thought that you knew
her better than vou reallv

do.
That was the problem with
Zoe. She knew him too well,
for eight years, since they were
undergrads in college together.
In college, Gabriel had wanted
to be a photographer. He had

gotten his MFA, and planned to
free-lance in Europe. Zoe would
own an art gallery, and when he got fa-

rnous, he would only show his work in her
gallery. But he ended up working in a portrait
studio, covering family gatherings, weddings,
graduations and other random joyous occa
sions.
One day, Aimee walked into the shop. She
wanted to get a portrait taken of herself, to
send to her mother. Apparently this was
something she did every month.
"I usually take the picture myself," she said,
taking a photograph out of her purse, "but it
always turns out pretty bad. See?"
The photograph was of Aimee sitting on a
park bench, the blur of a biker passing behind
her. The outlines of her face looked wavery;
apparently the camera had been held at arm's
length. Gabriel suddenly had the image of
Aimee's mother at home with a box of bad
Polaroids, all slightly out-of-focus.
"Why don't you just go visit her?" he sug
gested.
"Visit my mother?" Aimee laughed. "She
just wants to make sure I'm OK."
Gabriel positioned her hands in her lap,
the right over the left, and then changed his
mind and switched them. Her wrists were re
markably light; bird's wrists, he thought. He
noticed that she wasn't wearing any rings. Be
hind the camera, he adjusted the lens until
she came into focus.
He was used to making loose conversation
with his customers, to relax them. When it
came to young women, he would ask whether
they had boyfriends, and their eyes would
crinkle with embarrassment as ihey told him,
apologetically, no. It worked, though; in their
pictures they looked as though they were
smiling. This time, when Gabriel asked
Aimee that question, he really wanted to
know.
"No, I don't," she said, looking steadily at
him.
As for his own pictures, Gabriel keeps his
best efforts in a portfolio, just in case someday
he'll need one. Occasionally he will run some
of them past Zoe. He does this more out of
habit than necessity. Both of them know that
he probably isn't going to make it in the way
he thought he would. He goes to Zoe because
she knew what he was like when he used to be
lieve that. She is also his harshest critic; not
only of his work, but everything he does.
Which is why she was the first person he told
that he was getting married.
Zoe tilted her head and he could see the sil

ver earrings in her left car, a delicate row
of punctuation marks along the carti

lage.
'Why now?" she said.
"1 just think it's the right
time." He watched her twist

the rings on her fingers
"How's Kenneth?" he

asked, which
was what he

always
said
when
there
was

an awkward pause between them.
Mentioning Kenneth seemed to snap
something in Zoe. "He's fine, and you know
it, so stop trying to change the subject.
Gabriel, you're getting married to a woman
you've only known for six months."
"It's strange, but I feel like I know a lot
about her. I probably know her even better
than I know you."
"She's probably a lot less complicated."
Zoe's lips tightened at the corners after she'd
said that, as though she regretted what she'd
said. "Why don't you and Aimee come over
for dinner?" she suggested. "I'd like to meet
her. Really."
"Then there's something I should tell you
about her."
"What, does she turn into a pumpkin at
midnight or something?"
"No, she's a vegetarian."
Gabriel remembers the photograph Aimee
took of herself and how the bad focus made
her look like a ghost caught in the sunlight.
Sometimes he already feels like she's drifting
out of his field of vision. Right now, what he
wants most is to see her, to make sure she
hasn't disappeared entirely from his life. But
first he has to make sure she wants to see him.
"Will you go up?" he asks Zoe.
Zoe measures him up for a half-second,
lust when he's certain that she's going to
refuse, that she's going to go off on another
one of her tirades, she rises to her feet. "Sure,"
she says, and as she passes him up the ladder,
her skirt whispers cool against his face.
As she steps onto the roof, Zoe thinks
she can understand why Aimee chose
this place to escape. There's nothing to
impede the view in all directions. The park is
a green smudge on the horizon, and the
breeze lifted off the ocean turns the sky above
it hazy blue. Rising from the welter of build
ings and houses, all running together in the
hum of traffic, is the university clock tower's
thin spire.
Zoe could see the tower from her window
when she was a student at the city university;
it oriented her every quarter of an hour no
matter where she lived on campus. Once, she
counted the twelve chimes trickling through
the darkness of her room below her breath so
that she wouldn't wake Gabriel. That was the
first time she had slept with him. It was his
first time but not hers, although the memory
of hers still made her so

upset she'd rather
forget
i t

ever happened. She'd been far too young and
insecure, and the day afterward she had been
so angry that she went out and pierced her
ears six times, four on the left side and two on
the right. With Gabriel it was like starting
over again.
Zoe shades her eyes against the sun and
sees Aimee sitting at the very edge of the roof.
She figures that the gravel crunching beneath
her feet is warning enough, but just in case,
she says as she approaches, "The view from
here is great, isn't it?"
"It's a long way down," Aimee says, causing
Zoe to look at her sharply.
Zoe takes a cigarette and a lighter from her
pocket. "Do you mind if 1 smoke?"
"No."
Zoe lights the cigarette, hesitates and then
holds it out to Aimee.
Aimee takes a tentative drag as though
she's kissing someone for the first time.
"Would you do this to Gabriel?" she asks Zoe.
"Seriously, would you do this to him?"
Zoe laughs. "But you see, I'd never be in
the situation where I could do it in the first
place."
She wonders whether Aimee knows what
had caused her and Gabriel to break up, with
in the one month they tried living together.
This was after Gabriel had gotten his masters
and she started working in an art gallery
downtown. They lived in the apartment
Gabriel has now, although he used one of the
rooms as a darkroom. He had been looking
for a job for weeks; on rainy days when Zoe
came back from work, she would stuff her wet
shoes with want-ad sections from four differ
ent newspapers. Then she found out that he'd
gotten a job as a photographer's assistant at a
portrait studio, but was thinking of turning it
down.
"What's wrong with it?" she asked. "It's
nearby, it pays well, you get to dabble in
smelly chemicals. What more could you
want?"
"It's just not what I expected to be doing
with my life, that's all."
"Neither did 1."
He looked at her keenly. "You know, it
hasn't been easy for me to sit and watch you
pick up tabs at dinner or pay the rent because
I don't have a job."
"That was a choice you made when you de
cided to do this," she said, scattering a stack of
photographs on the table. Some pictures, she
realized, were of herself.
"You don't understand this."
"Are you saying that I can't understand
this? That I can't understand because I only sit
in an office and sell paintings all day, that I
can't know what you're going through?"
"Yes," he said. "1 don't think you can ever
understand, and I've tried to convince my
self that it's OK, that we can work through
this, because there's no one else I can think
of being with except for you."
For a moment that

completely silenced her. "Gabriel," she said
then, gently. "It's not me you're thinking of
when you say that."
She moved out the next week.
Neither of them acknowledge anymore
that they actually were involved enough at
one point in time to have lived together. They
chalk that month up as a failed experiment. In
the four years since then, some small things
have changed. Now when they go out for
lunch, they split the bill equally. When Zoe
goes to his apartment now, she feels an odd
tug of belonging, even though the place hard
ly looks the same anymore. She chose that
painting for his and Aimee's wedding present
as carefully as though it had been for her own
home. The fact that Gabriel still shows her his
photographs touches her in a way she can't
explain, but is thankful for.
"When I woke up this morning," Aimee
says,"I couldn't remember what I'd dreamed
about. I could only remember what I'd felt,
this strange kind of hesitation. Like I was
holding my breath. I changed into my dress,
and when I came out of the bathroom he was
pretending he was asleep even though he was
awake, you know what I mean?"
"I do," Zoe replies.
"I felt like he was waiting for me to do or
say something. Something that would let him
know that I felt that this day was different. But
1 didn't. I didn't feel like today was any differ
ent from yesterday, or tomorrow either. As I
looked at him, I felt kind of what I'd felt in my
dream, this sort of inability to recognize any
thing. This inability to breathe. As though
everything that mattered to me was narrowed
down to this one feeling, or thought, or idea.
I had to get out of there."
"And?"
"And so I came up here. I don't feel like I'm
in a specific place or a time when I'm here. It's
as if this could have happened yesterday, or it
could have happened tomorrow."
"But it didn't. It happened today." Zoe cor
rects herself. "It's happening now."
Aimee grinds out the cigarette on the grav
el.
"May I?" Zoe asks, low.
For a moment, Aimee looks at the palms of
her hands. She shakes flecks of ash from her
fingers. "OK," she finally says.
Zoe stands up and goes to the other end of
the roof. Gabriel is where she left him, seated
on the bottom rung of the ladder. He glances
up as she descends and then gets to his feet
when she reaches the landing.
"It's OK," she says. "You can go on up."
Gabriel moves past her in a rush of air vi
brant with tension and uncertainty. Zoe
shades her eyes against the sun as she looks
upwards. She thinks she can see Aimee stand
ing at the edge of the roof, and that Aimee ex
tends her hand to him. He takes it, and then
he is gone from sight.
Zoe climbs through the window into the
bathroom, the bedroom, the living room,
where Kenneth is sitting on the couch with
the bottle of Guinness. She sits down next to
him. His right arm lies across the back of the
couch, and she lets her head rest against his
shoulder. Together they look at the glass of the
painting opposite them, as though in their
twin reflection they can see what's going on
over their heads.
