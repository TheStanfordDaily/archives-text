The elevator is out of order, so they have
to use the stairs. Zoe is worried that
they will be late for the wedding.
"How can we be late?" Kenneth says.
"We're the only guests, besides the minister."
He pauses to consider whether a minister can
be called a guest.
Then he follows Zoe up the stairs, focusing
on the Hash of her ankles revealed by the rise
and fall of her skirt. He lags behind a little be
cause he's carrying the wedding present,
which is a painting. It's an abstract watercol
or that looks like someone went amok with
paint in a prison cell. Kenneth thinks that
even he could do a better job painting the in
side of somebody's bathroom, but when he
told Zoe that, she refused to speak to him for
a day. He wonders ifZoe is still mad at him lor
turning the alarm clock off this morning and
promptly falling asleep.
They have to wait a long time before
Gabriel opens the door of the apartment. Al
though he's wearing suit trousers and a but
ton-down shirt, his collar is twisted and his
hair falls uncombed over his forehead.
"Let me guess," Kenneth says. "Your alarm
didn't go off either."
Gabriel shakes his head as Kenneth and
Zoe move past him into the living room. Ken
neth leans the painting against the wall oppo
site the couch. It is when he notices how still
the air is, how frozen the room looks, that he
realizes something is wrong.
Zoe reaches up and straightens Gabriel's
collar. "Where's Aimee?" she asks.
"She's on the roof."
"On the roof?"
"She won't come down."
Kenneth tries to think of something com
forting to say. "It's probably just nerves. You
know, pre-wedding jitters."
"I don't know what to call it." Gabriel's
voice is taut.
"What you need is a drink," Kenneth says.
Neither Gabriel nor Zoe reply, so Kenneth
goes into the kitchen.
Kenneth believes that you can tell some
one's personality from the contents of their
refrigerator. Today there is only a wilted head
of lettuce and a bottle of Guinness in
Gabriel's; he figures this is a sign that Aimee is
taking over. When he'd first known Gabriel,
there had always been the same three things:
pastrami, onions and beer, like primary col
ors.
Kenneth knows that Zoe likes to tell her
friends that he's a painter. He also knows that
she doesn't specify that he's a house painter,
which he thinks is amusing because they first
met when he painted Gabriel's kitchen last
year. His first day on the job, Gabriel and Zoe
had argued whether the paint color should be
pearl gray or cornflower blue; pearl gray,
Gabriel's choice, won out. Kenneth offered
up no opinion but had watched Zoe's eyes
darken with frustration. Because of the way
they argued he was sure that Gabriel and Zoe

were a couple; they assured him they weren't.
Zoe started dropping by the apartment when
Gabriel wasn't there. She always seemed to
catch Kenneth when he was taking a break, so
it didn't look like he was working at all. He
and Zoe first made love one afternoon when
Gabriel was at work, on his kitchen floor.
When Kenneth returns to the living room,
no one is there. He can hear voices, though,
and he follows them into the bedroom and
then the bathroom. The window is open, and
Zoe and Gabriel are on the fire escape landing
outside. There's only room for two people on
the landing, so Kenneth sits on the win
dowsill. He sticks his head out of the window
and looks up. He thinks that he catches a
glimpse of something white, something that
could be a face or a hand or the edge of a skirt,
before it disappears from the edge of the roof.
No one seems to have seen this except for
him.
"I called half an hour ago and canceled,"
Gabriel is saying.
Kenneth wonders if canceling a minister is
as easy as canceling a doctor's appointment,
and if you're asked if you'd like to reschedule.
"Canceled!" Zoe says. "What did you do
that for?"
"I didn't want him to get here and have to

Gabriel shakes liis head as Kenneth and Zoe
move past him into the living room. Kenneth
leans the painting against the wall opposite
the couch. It is when he notices how still the
air is, how frozen the room looks, that he re
alizes something is wrong.

wait. I didn't want to have to think about that,
on top of everything else."
"How long do you think you'll have to
wait?" Kenneth says. He sticks his head out
the window again and projects loudly to
wards the roof, "She'll come down when she
gets hungry."
Zoe glares at him to let him know that she
doesn't appreciate his sense of humor. Ken
neth gets the feeling that he's being shut out,
as though he's at home and everyone else is
out getting drunk. So he retreats to the living
room and settles himself on the couch with
the bottle of Guinness. He looks at the paint
ing leaning against the wall, shifting a little so
the glare from the glass covering it doesn't get
into his eyes. It's supposed to be from both
himself and Zoe, although Zoe was the one
who spent a weekend on the telephone nego-

tiating with the dealer. She also paid
more for it, which Kenneth thinks is
only fair because she's the one who's
known Gabriel since college. Nei
ther of them have known Aimee for
very long, just a few months.

Kenneth didn't think much of Aimee
when he met her, that night Zoe invited her
and Gabriel over for dinner. She reminded
him of a paper doll, looking like she'd blow

away if you so much as sneezed in her direc
tion. He would never have guessed that
Gabriel and Aimee were engaged just by look
ing at them. Then again, he wondered if his
bearings were generally off when it came to
figuring out the more complex relationships
between people. He didn't even know exactly
how close Gabriel and Zoe were, although he
suspected that something must have gone on
at some point within the 10 years of their
friendship.
Only Kenneth knew the preparations Zoe
went through that evening Gabriel and
Aimee came over for dinner, from ordering
an arrangement of flowers to going down
town twice to change the wine. Ten minutes
before Gabriel and Aimee were due to arrive,
she was looking through her closet for some
thing to wear, tossing half the clothes out in

the process.
"Z," he said; this was what he called her
whenever she had her back arched like a ruf
fled cat, "it's OK. Everything's going to be
OK."
"What if she doesn't like artichokes or
beans? I mean, what if she's some sort of
weird breed of vegetarian who only eats leafy
green vegetables?"
"Then we'll just have the flowers and the
Zinfandel."
Zoe wadded up a silk blouse and threw it at
him, but on second thought, went to retrieve
it. He thought it a good sign that she didn't
twist away when he put his hands around her
waist.
"Don't," she said. "I'm trying to get
dressed."
"I don't want you to get dressed."

"I want
you," she said,
"to go find some matches for the candles.
What if they're early? 1 bet they'll be early. I'll
bet that she's the kind of person who has to be
everywhere on time."
But Gabriel and Aimee were five minutes
late, during which Zoe moved distractedly
between the kitchen and the living room. On
the couch with his eyes closed, Kenneth lis
tened to the sound of her watch intensify and
recede.
Kenneth supposes that he never really took
Gabriel and Aimee's wedding seriously in the
first place. They didn't want any presents, and
they didn't invite any other guests, not even
their parents. From what Kenneth could
gather, Gabriel's parents lived on the other
side of the country, and Aimee wasn't very
close to her mother. They didn't want to go to
a church or city hall. Kenneth supposes that
they wouldn't have hired a minister if they
could have gotten away with it. The stunt that
Aimee is pulling off now seems to be less of a
hitch in plans than a natural conclusion that
they were moving toward all the time. Hut
Kenneth knows that Gabriel must be going
through hell and that Zoe is trying to console
him as best she can. For that, and for the fact
that he's lost an entire morning of work, he
thinks that Aimee is being pretty damn child
ish.
Ha, Aimee thinks as Kenneth's voice
carries up to the roof. She'll come
down when she gets hungry. They
didn't know how long she could go without
eating. She'd gone for an entire day without
eating something more substantial than a let
tuce and margarine sandwich, which had
been practically her sole diet in her all-girls
high school. "You are what you eat," her
mother told her, and she'd believed it ever
since that day in ninth grade, watching An
nette Hoffman bite into a cupcake with vanil
la frosting. She had always thought of Annette
Hoffman as a fat white girl; she mentally sub
stituted "cupcake" for "girl" and giggled to
herself whenever Annette wore pleated skirts.
She started seeing other girls at school the
same way. Emily DeVries was a thin black
licorice whip, Sara Stanley a deviled egg, Jean
nie Martin an orange fish-stick. Aimee was
two pieces of white bread with a limp piece of
lettuce in between that left a smear of green
on her front teeth.
Aimee still has trouble eating with people
she doesn't know well, like Zoe and Kenneth.
