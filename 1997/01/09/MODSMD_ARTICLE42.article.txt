For Fiction Contest winner Wendy Lee,
creative writing wasn't a significant
priority until she came to Stanford. "I
feel like I've been writingall my life," said Lee,
who also contributes to The Stanford Daily.
"But when I got to college it was really a ques
tion of having the time and the energy and
the space. I felt like I didn't have those. It
came down to making this choice: Is writing
really important to me?"
The answer, clearly, was yes. Since her
freshman year, Lee has taken two creative
writing classes, the more recent one being the
class in which she wrote "Trust."
The story had its inspiration in a mental
picture Lee had. "I'm really interested in film,
and I think that influences the way I write.
I had an image of a bride standing on a roof.
That's basically how the story came about."
In addition to being influenced by film,
Lee is influenced by the writers she admires.
"I feel like I'm influenced by whatever writer
I'm reading at the time. I like John Updike,
especially his short stories. I've recently been
reading a lot of Jane Smiley."
Lee believes that as an Asian American,
her ethnicity influences her perspective both
as a reader and a writer. "I'm really interested
in how ethnicity affects writing. I think it will
be a dilemma for me, putting more of myself
in, because I know when I write, I'm influ
enced by so many other writers. I guess it has
to do with finding your own voice, as cliched
as that sounds."

\ /\ / eral stories second-place winner
▼ Y C.E. Smith has written about the

same religious cult. The cult, called the Fish
ers of God, is Smith's own creation, though
for authenticity he has borrowed from the re
ligious fundamentalism he witnessed grow
ing up in the South. However, said Smith, "I
wouldn't want to talk about religion except in
fiction."
As an undergraduate, Smith majored in
English but did not choose creative writing as
his area of emphasis. "I was so out of it when
I declared | my major] I didn't even know you
could do that," he said. "When I came here, I
thought it was stupid to take classes in cre
ative writing. 1 don't think that now. I think
it's incredibly worthwhile."
Like the characters in his story, Smith
wrestled in high school, as well as for his first
two years at Stanford. "I stopped wrestling at
Stanford because 1 wanted to have time to do
other things like creative writing," he said.
Motivation to write also came from a more
surprising source. "1 took a lot of science my
junior year. That got me really wanting to be
creative," said Smith.
Smith is unsure how he will integrate
writing into his future. Having recently fin
ished his master's thesis on the writer Walker
Percy and Percy's book "The Moviegoer,"
Smith is now considering pursuing a doctor
al degree in English or, conversely, he is con
sidering medical school. "1 have no idea," he
said. "I like reading longer fiction, so ulti
mately I'd like to write longer fiction. I'd like
to work on novels, but that's a long way off."
Like both Lee and Smith, third-place
winner Ashish Goel took a creative
writing class with lones Lecturer Lan

Samantha Chang (see profile, page 13), and it
was under Chang's tutelage that he produced
his story "Houseboy." "1 enjoyed the class ter
ribly," Goel said.
As a third-year doctoral student in com
puter science, Goel's presence in the class
represented a return to the "fuzzier" interests
of his adolescence. "1 was interested in writ
ing during high school, then somehow I got
into engineering," he said.

Originally from the small town of Hapur
in India, Goel attended the Indian Institute
of Technology before coming to Stanford.
Now that he has rediscovered writing, he
must strike a balance between his interests. "I
want to continue writing and I want to finish
my Ph. D., two mutually conflicting goals,"
he said. "I don't really know what I'm going
to do."
