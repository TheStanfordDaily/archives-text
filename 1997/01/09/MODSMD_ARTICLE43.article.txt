# AN EXCERPT FROM
## WRESTLING WITH GOD 
### C.E. Smith 
I never cared for religion, but I loved
wrestling. Coach Wheeler called it "God's fa
vorite sport" because it was the only sport
God ever participated in. In the book of Gen
esis, God and Jacob wrestled all night to a
draw, and then as the sun rose God touched
Jacob's hip, wrenching it out of socket. Nick,
whose father was a preacher, explained these
things to me.
I weighed about 153 pounds at the start of
my first season, and 1 wrestled in the 130
pound weight class. I fasted more than the
most pious man of God. Neither me, my
mother or my sister ever thought about God,
but we went to church every Sunday anyway.
When I wresded, I refused to take commu
nion, because in such small amounts the
bread and wine were wasted calories. So 1
would sit alone in the pews while the rest of
the congregation filed up the center aisle to
eat and drink. This embarrassed my mother,
and she decided to let me stay home on Sun
day mornings.
My sister insisted on staying home from
church also. My mother couldn't deny Evelyn
a request she had already granted me, so she
went to church by herself. After one Sunday
morning alone, my mother decided not to go
back. "It's just not the same without y'all," she
said. We would return, she said, when the
wrestling season ended.
1 weighed 152 and a half pounds when we
saw the advertisement for wresding on the
bulletin board our freshman year. We had
never heard of wrestling before. The flier
said, "GOD'S FAVORITE SPORT! JOIN
THE WRESTLING TEAM!" There were two
sketched figures in the middleof the page, be
tween the phrases. I guessed they were
wresding, and after Nick explained the Gen
esis story, I wondered if the sketched figures
were supposed to represent God and Jacob.
Evelyn said God had longer hair. And Nick

said there was no way God and Jacob wore
anything like the tight suits and ear protec
tors of the sketched figures.
That night at dinner, I said to my mother,
"I'm going to wrestle."
Her chewing made her ears move up and
down. They were bigger than normal and
their thin transparency reminded me of an
insect's wings. Having been told many times
that I had my mother's ears, I wondered if
mine also looked like translucent flaps grind
ing in slow motion with my jaw. Whether
they did or not, our faces were remarkably
similar. We both had the same brown eyes,
the same abrupt jaw bone and the same curly
hair. When my sister looked at the family pic
tures, she could discern only one difference
between me and my mother, and that was my
chin. It protruded sharply from beneath my
mouth and curved up slightly at its tip so that
it looked like an inverted wave crest, and
from the tip a long fiat region that I could
barely see in the mirnir extended back to
ward my spine to form an angle with my
neck. My mother's chin was small.
Her jaw stopped moving, she swallowed,
and she smiled at Evelyn. They sat close to
one another on the other side of the round
table. She said, "Evelyn is too."
I looked at Evelyn. A shirt hung from Eve
lyn's chair, on a coat hanger. I shook my head
and began eating again. Then I said, ' You two
do what you want."
Evelyn smirked and said, "You always say
that."
"Girls can't wrestle," I said.
"They can," my mother said.
"They can," Evelyn said.
I twirled my fork on my thumb and it fell
to the floor. I leaned over to pick it up and savN
their legs under the table. "It's not right," I
said. "It's too physical."
"What are you saying?" Evelyn asked.
"Why are you doing this?" I asked.
