# AN EXCERPT FROM
## WRESTLING WITH GOD 
### C.E. Smith 
I never cared for religion, but I loved
wrestling. Coach Wheeler called it "God's fa
vorite sport" because it was the only sport
God ever participated in. In the book of Gen
esis, God and Jacob wrestled all night to a
draw, and then as the sun rose God touched
Jacob's hip, wrenching it out of socket. Nick,
whose father was a preacher, explained these
things to me.
I weighed about 153 pounds at the start of
my first season, and 1 wrestled in the 130
pound weight class. I fasted more than the
most pious man of God. Neither me, my
mother or my sister ever thought about God,
but we went to church every Sunday anyway.
When I wresded, I refused to take commu
nion, because in such small amounts the
bread and wine were wasted calories. So 1
would sit alone in the pews while the rest of
the congregation filed up the center aisle to
eat and drink. This embarrassed my mother,
and she decided to let me stay home on Sun
day mornings.
My sister insisted on staying home from
church also. My mother couldn't deny Evelyn
a request she had already granted me, so she
went to church by herself. After one Sunday
morning alone, my mother decided not to go
back. "It's just not the same without y'all," she
said. We would return, she said, when the
wrestling season ended.
1 weighed 152 and a half pounds when we
saw the advertisement for wresding on the
bulletin board our freshman year. We had
never heard of wrestling before. The flier
said, "GOD'S FAVORITE SPORT! JOIN
THE WRESTLING TEAM!" There were two
sketched figures in the middleof the page, be
tween the phrases. I guessed they were
wresding, and after Nick explained the Gen
esis story, I wondered if the sketched figures
were supposed to represent God and Jacob.
Evelyn said God had longer hair. And Nick

said there was no way God and Jacob wore
anything like the tight suits and ear protec
tors of the sketched figures.
That night at dinner, I said to my mother,
"I'm going to wrestle."
Her chewing made her ears move up and
down. They were bigger than normal and
their thin transparency reminded me of an
insect's wings. Having been told many times
that I had my mother's ears, I wondered if
mine also looked like translucent flaps grind
ing in slow motion with my jaw. Whether
they did or not, our faces were remarkably
similar. We both had the same brown eyes,
the same abrupt jaw bone and the same curly
hair. When my sister looked at the family pic
tures, she could discern only one difference
between me and my mother, and that was my
chin. It protruded sharply from beneath my
mouth and curved up slightly at its tip so that
it looked like an inverted wave crest, and
from the tip a long fiat region that I could
barely see in the mirnir extended back to
ward my spine to form an angle with my
neck. My mother's chin was small.
Her jaw stopped moving, she swallowed,
and she smiled at Evelyn. They sat close to
one another on the other side of the round
table. She said, "Evelyn is too."
I looked at Evelyn. A shirt hung from Eve
lyn's chair, on a coat hanger. I shook my head
and began eating again. Then I said, ' You two
do what you want."
Evelyn smirked and said, "You always say
that."
"Girls can't wrestle," I said.
"They can," my mother said.
"They can," Evelyn said.
I twirled my fork on my thumb and it fell
to the floor. I leaned over to pick it up and savN
their legs under the table. "It's not right," I
said. "It's too physical."
"What are you saying?" Evelyn asked.
"Why are you doing this?" I asked.
"The flier this morning appealed to me," she
said. She leaned back in her chair, and the shirt
slipped off the coat hanger.
"You're just trying to make some stupid fem
inist point," I said.
Evelyn chewed in silence. I noticed that her
ears remained relatively still. She swallowed and
said, "I have as much right to participate in that
sport as anyone. It's not my fault I'm a girl."
I looked at my mother. "That's what I'm talk
ing about."
"This isn't an issue," she said. "If Evelyn
wants to do it, she can. There is something else
I'm worried about."
"What's that?" Evelyn asked.
"The coach," my mother said, "is Bob
Wheeler. Is that right?"
"I think so," I said.
"He's a Fisher of Men," my mother said.
"It's just like any other denomination," I said.
She laughed. "Those people stick fishhooks
through their cheeks!" She scooped up a lump
of mashed potatoes.
"They only do that on their first commu
nion," I said. "Nick's done it. He said it didn't
hurt. I've seen the scar."
"It's sick," she said.
Evelyn pushed her plate away from her, to
ward the center of the glass table. "It's not like
we're going to become Fishers of Men, mother."
"Those people are fanatical," she said. "Look
at the Demuses."
"Nick's not like his parents."
"His mother is also his grandmother," she
said. This was true. Nicholas Oxbow Demus,
Nick's father, claimed that Jesus commanded
him in a dream to have sex with his own moth
er. He obeyed, and Nick was the result.
"The Fishers of Men are good people," Eve
lyn said. I could see her reflection in the glass
table where her plate had been.
"His father's one of the founders of that cult,"
my mother said and smiled at Evelyn. "That's

not normal." She was silent for a moment, and
the prongs of her fork hovered just above her
plate.
"Isabel," 1 said to her, "we go to church every
Sunday." 1 often called my mother by her first
name. "Since when does religion bother you?"
"It's that cult," she said. "1

think it's unhealthy."
"Wrestling and religion
are entirely separate things,"
I said. "It'll be just like any '
other wresding team."
"Except for me," Evelyn
said.

A giant curtain divid
ed the gymnasium into
two unequal areas, two
full size wresding mats

on the
smaller
side and a
basketball
court on
the larger.
Coach
Wheeler
called the
wrestling
area "The
Holy
Place," and
demanded
that every

one change

shoes before
coming into it. He

considered any
footwear other than

wrestling shoes to be a sac- I
rilege, and he exacted 50
pushups from anyone who
polluted the sanctity of the place

with unclean shoes. Coach Wheeler had a long
list of rules like this one. On the first day of prac
tice he explained each rule to us in detail. The list
hung from the wall in The Holy Place, and it
looked like this:
1. The Lord's name will not be taken in vain in
The Holy Place.
2. All wrestlers must be prayers.
3. Only wrestling shoes are allowed in The
I Holy Place.

4. Praying must be done in a kneel
ing position.

5. No girls are allowed in
The Holy Place.

6. No losers are allowed
in The Holy Place.

7. All wrestlers must re
main in their assigned
wrestling areas.
8. All weight loss must
be approved.

9. Respect older
wrestlers and
your coach.

10. The Ten
Command-

ments must be observed at all times.
11. You will love the Lord your God with all your
heart, soul and mind.
12. You will love your neighbor as yourself.
Coach Wheeler was so fat that he was round.
In the locker room, I noticed that he had rolls of
fat that looked like stacked tires between his sag
ging breasts and his hips. 1 thought that those
hips must be extremely powerful to support so
much weight.
Coach Wheeler would have agreed that his
hips were formidable. He had always equated
one's ability to wrestle with one's hip strength.
"Good hips make a good wrestler," he would say.
"What part of Jacob did God attack to win the
greatest wrestling match in history? He attacked
his hip. Believe me, God knew what he was
doing."
For Coach Wheeler, wrestling and Chris
tianity were nearly synonymous. He had once
started a Christian wrestling club that met on
Saturday nights and wrestled all night long
until church on Sunday morning, to re-enact
the match between God and Jacob. By the sec
ond week of the club's existence, however,
Coach Wheeler was the only remaining mem
ber, so he gave up and returned to his normal
Sunday morning routine at the First

Methodist Church
of Hicko

ry. His stint on

the broad path of wor

sh ip lasted only a few months,

however, before he left the

Methodist congregation and joined The
Fishers of Men.

"The flier this morning appealed to me," she
said. She leaned back in her chair, and the shirt
slipped off the coat hanger.
"You're just trying to make some stupid fem
inist point," I said.
Evelyn chewed in silence. I noticed that her
ears remained relatively still. She swallowed and
said, "I have as much right to participate in that
sport as anyone. It's not my fault I'm a girl."
I looked at my mother. "That's what I'm talk
ing about."
"This isn't an issue," she said. "If Evelyn
wants to do it, she can. There is something else
I'm worried about."
"What's that?" Evelyn asked.
"The coach," my mother said, "is Bob
Wheeler. Is that right?"
"I think so," I said.
"He's a Fisher of Men," my mother said.
"It's just like any other denomination," I said.
She laughed. "Those people stick fishhooks
through their cheeks!" She scooped up a lump
of mashed potatoes.
"They only do that on their first commu
nion," I said. "Nick's done it. He said it didn't
hurt. I've seen the scar."
"It's sick," she said.
Evelyn pushed her plate away from her, to
ward the center of the glass table. "It's not like
we're going to become Fishers of Men, mother."
"Those people are fanatical," she said. "Look
at the Demuses."
"Nick's not like his parents."
"His mother is also his grandmother," she
said. This was true. Nicholas Oxbow Demus,
Nick's father, claimed that Jesus commanded
him in a dream to have sex with his own moth
er. He obeyed, and Nick was the result.
"The Fishers of Men are good people," Eve
lyn said. I could see her reflection in the glass
table where her plate had been.
"His father's one of the founders of that cult,"
my mother said and smiled at Evelyn. "That's

not normal." She was silent for a moment, and
the prongs of her fork hovered just above her
plate.
"Isabel," 1 said to her, "we go to church every
Sunday." 1 often called my mother by her first
name. "Since when does religion bother you?"
"It's that cult," she said. "1

think it's unhealthy."
"Wrestling and religion
are entirely separate things,"
I said. "It'll be just like any '
other wresding team."
"Except for me," Evelyn
said.

A giant curtain divid

Coach
Wheeler
called the
wrestling
area "The
Holy
Place," and
demanded
that every

one change

shoes before
coming into it. He

considered any
footwear other than

wrestling shoes to be a sac- I
rilege, and he exacted 50
pushups from anyone who
polluted the sanctity of the place

with unclean shoes. Coach Wheeler had a long
list of rules like this one. On the first day of prac
tice he explained each rule to us in detail. The list
hung from the wall in The Holy Place, and it
looked like this:
1. The Lord's name will not be taken in vain in
The Holy Place.
2. All wrestlers must be prayers.
3. Only wrestling shoes are allowed in The
I Holy Place.

4. Praying must be done in a kneel
ing position.

5. No girls are allowed in
The Holy Place.

6. No losers are allowed
in The Holy Place.

7. All wrestlers must re
main in their assigned
wrestling areas.
8. All weight loss must
be approved.

9. Respect older
wrestlers and
your coach.

10. The Ten
Command-

ments must be observed at all times.
11. You will love the Lord your God with all your
heart, soul and mind.
12. You will love your neighbor as yourself.
Coach Wheeler was so fat that he was round.
In the locker room, I noticed that he had rolls of
fat that looked like stacked tires between his sag
ging breasts and his hips. 1 thought that those
hips must be extremely powerful to support so
much weight.
Coach Wheeler would have agreed that his
hips were formidable. He had always equated
one's ability to wrestle with one's hip strength.
"Good hips make a good wrestler," he would say.
"What part of Jacob did God attack to win the
greatest wrestling match in history? He attacked
his hip. Believe me, God knew what he was
doing."
For Coach Wheeler, wrestling and Chris
tianity were nearly synonymous. He had once
started a Christian wrestling club that met on
Saturday nights and wrestled all night long
until church on Sunday morning, to re-enact
the match between God and Jacob. By the sec
ond week of the club's existence, however,
Coach Wheeler was the only remaining mem
ber, so he gave up and returned to his normal
Sunday morning routine at the First

Methodist Church
of Hicko

ry. His stint on

the broad path of wor

sh ip lasted only a few months,

however, before he left the

Methodist congregation and joined The
Fishers of Men.

I never cared for religion, but I loved
wrestling. Coach Wheeler called it "God's fa
vorite sport" because it was the only sport
God ever participated in. In the book of Gen
esis, God and Jacob wrestled all night to a
draw, and then as the sun rose God touched
Jacob's hip, wrenching it out of socket. Nick,
whose father was a preacher, explained these
things to me.
I weighed about 153 pounds at the start of
my first season, and 1 wrestled in the 130
pound weight class. I fasted more than the
most pious man of God. Neither me, my
mother or my sister ever thought about God,
but we went to church every Sunday anyway.
When I wresded, I refused to take commu
nion, because in such small amounts the
bread and wine were wasted calories. So 1
would sit alone in the pews while the rest of
the congregation filed up the center aisle to
eat and drink. This embarrassed my mother,
and she decided to let me stay home on Sun
day mornings.
My sister insisted on staying home from
church also. My mother couldn't deny Evelyn
a request she had already granted me, so she
went to church by herself. After one Sunday
morning alone, my mother decided not to go
back. "It's just not the same without y'all," she
said. We would return, she said, when the
wrestling season ended.
1 weighed 152 and a half pounds when we
saw the advertisement for wresding on the
bulletin board our freshman year. We had
never heard of wrestling before. The flier
said, "GOD'S FAVORITE SPORT! JOIN
THE WRESTLING TEAM!" There were two
sketched figures in the middleof the page, be
tween the phrases. I guessed they were
wresding, and after Nick explained the Gen
esis story, I wondered if the sketched figures
were supposed to represent God and Jacob.
Evelyn said God had longer hair. And Nick

said there was no way God and Jacob wore
anything like the tight suits and ear protec
tors of the sketched figures.
That night at dinner, I said to my mother,
"I'm going to wrestle."
Her chewing made her ears move up and
down. They were bigger than normal and
their thin transparency reminded me of an
insect's wings. Having been told many times
that I had my mother's ears, I wondered if
mine also looked like translucent flaps grind
ing in slow motion with my jaw. Whether
they did or not, our faces were remarkably
similar. We both had the same brown eyes,
the same abrupt jaw bone and the same curly
hair. When my sister looked at the family pic
tures, she could discern only one difference
between me and my mother, and that was my
chin. It protruded sharply from beneath my
mouth and curved up slightly at its tip so that
it looked like an inverted wave crest, and
from the tip a long fiat region that I could
barely see in the mirnir extended back to
ward my spine to form an angle with my
neck. My mother's chin was small.
Her jaw stopped moving, she swallowed,
and she smiled at Evelyn. They sat close to
one another on the other side of the round
table. She said, "Evelyn is too."
I looked at Evelyn. A shirt hung from Eve
lyn's chair, on a coat hanger. I shook my head
and began eating again. Then I said, ' You two
do what you want."
Evelyn smirked and said, "You always say
that."
"Girls can't wrestle," I said.
"They can," my mother said.
"They can," Evelyn said.
I twirled my fork on my thumb and it fell
to the floor. I leaned over to pick it up and savN
their legs under the table. "It's not right," I
said. "It's too physical."
"What are you saying?" Evelyn asked.
"Why are you doing this?" I asked.
"The flier this morning appealed to me," she
said. She leaned back in her chair, and the shirt
slipped off the coat hanger.
"You're just trying to make some stupid fem
inist point," I said.
Evelyn chewed in silence. I noticed that her
