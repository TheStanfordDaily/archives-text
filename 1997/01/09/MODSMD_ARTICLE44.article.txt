# AN EXCERPT FROM
## HOUSEBOY 
### Ashish Goel 
His wife was screaming at their son when
Birju woke up. It was late; the sun was almost
out. Birju picked up the tin of water and went to
shit over the open drain next to the road. Then
he washed his face, and rode his bicycle to the
house where he worked. He was the cook and
the sweeper, the errands-man and the ladies
maid. He washed their dishes, did their laundry,
dug their garden, cleaned up after their dog. The
owner's wife gave him his breakfast as usual —a
glass of tea, a piece of bread which he himself
had baked the previous night. Sometimes, when
the house-owner's wife was in a good mood,
Birju would bake more bread than he needed
and take the extra home to his son. Today did
not look like one of those days.
"Birju, a glass of water."
"One minute, Sahib."
He had called the owner and his wife Sir and
Madam in the beginning, but they did not think
that was respectful enough.
"Birju, sweep the floor."
"Already done, Sahib." This house had a hard
concrete floor. This was good. Birju had worked
in another house before this, one with a whie

marble floor which had needed two scrubs a
day. Birju had hated that house. This place was
large, but had high walls around the courtyard,
so less dust got in for Birju to clean. Also, the
owner's wife cleaned the carpets herself, she did
not trust Birju with the vacuum cleaner.
"Birju, change the baby's diapers. Hurry up,
oaf!"
"Yes, Sahib."
The baby was cute. The owner and his wife
had prayed for a boy, but the baby was a girl.
Still, the baby's mother did riot neglect her. Birju
sometimes wished the owner had another child
of the same age as his son. Then Birju could have
taken the child's old clothes home for his son.
Even girl's clothes would have been an improve
ment over the tatters his son currently wore. But
his son was ten, much older than this baby, not
old enough yet for the owner's discards. Birju
had balked at changing the baby's diapers the
first few times. "It's not a job for a man, Sahib,"
Birju had said. But Sahib was not impressed.
"We pay for a full days work. Your time is ours
to spend. We decide what you will and will not
do." The owner of the house was an officer in the
Civil Services, used to making decisions quickly
and with authority.
In the afternoon, the owner's wife asked Birju
to move the baby's crib into the garden, between
the roses and the jasmine. The owner's wife
liked to sit in the sun and knit, looking at her
baby nestled among the rose bushes. The baby

was more pink than the roses, and smelled bet
ter than jasmine. The owner's wife had made
Birju work hard on the garden, and his labor was
now paying off — her garden was the envy of all
her friends.
From two to three in the afternoon was
Birju's hour off. This he usually spent sleeping
under the mango tree which he had planted two
years ago, just after he had started working at
this house. The tree was bearing fruit now -
small green oblongs which were so sour they
could make a thin layer peel off the tip of a man's
tongue if he took too hasty a bite. His son loved
these. Whenever Birju saw a mango lying under
the tree with its skin still unbroken, be picked it
up and took it home. The ones on the tree were
off limits. The owner's wife stored these in a big
jar and Birju pickled the batch when the jar got
full.
Birju got home late because the owner had
some guests. His son was crying, but stopped as
soon as Birju came in. The owner had bought
some sweets for his guests, and Birju had been
given a piece out of the leftovers. His son ate the
piece in small bites, slowly sucking the juice out
of each bite and swirling it around on his tongue
before swallowing it. After dinner they lay down
on their bed — all three of them together, as
their son liked to sleep with them. Birju woke up
in the middle of the night, and he woke up his
wife too. Then they went to the courtyard and
made love. His wife was good that way; she

never said no. She knew he worked hard all day.
"A man needs some respect," her mother used to
tell her. And Birju's wife knew her man needed it
more than most, having spent his day sweeping
and cooking and cleaning up after the dog.
Their love-making was quick. During the
winter they made love in the kitchen, but the
courtyard was pleasantly cool now. For some
time they lay quietly together, as Birju regained
his breath. Then he asked, "Why was he crying
when I came in?"
"Fie had a fight with Kullu's daughter," she
said. Kullu lived next door.
Birju and Kullu had worked in the same
house for some time. Birju was twelve years old,
on his first job. The work had been light in the
beginning — taking care of the garden, escort
ing the owner's children to school, carrying
their lunch to them during half-time, polishing
their shoes, playing with them in the evening.
The food was good. The owner's wife listened
to the radio all day and the music had filled
Birju, making him forget his village and his
childhood. Then one day Birju was asked to
wash the dishes, then to clean the fish and chop
the vegetables. Soon Birju was doing as much
work as Kullu who was a tew years older and
more than a foot taller. Kullu tried to ease things
out for Birju as much as he could. They became
good friends. When Birju got married a few
years later, Kullu helped him find this house to
live in.
