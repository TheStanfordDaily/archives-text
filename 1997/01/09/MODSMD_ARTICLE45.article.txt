According to Sylvia Waters, artistic director
for the Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble for
more than 20 years, "Dance is something that is
in all of us, in all other cultures. History tells us
that movement and body language were out
first language. That is what dance is."
Members of the Stanford community will
be able to witness this beautiful art form when
the ensemble performs at Memorial Auditori
um tomorrow and Saturday at 8 p.m. Satur
day's performance includes the U.S. premiere
of "Crossing 2/To." Presented by Stanford Live
ly Arts, this appearance at Stanford for the
troupe is its first in more than 20 years.
Under the category of modern dance, the

group's style is a smooth blend of modern, jazz,
ethnic, ballet and tap. "In modern dance, the
dance is more about feeling and about reality
than fantasy as in a traditional ballet," Waters
said . "There is also a tremendous accessibility
to dance . . . that was one of Alvins (Ailey]
greatest qualities. He felt that dance belonged
to the people and should be given back to the
people. Many of his ballets were about human
and individual situations."
Consisting of exemplary students from the
dance school, the dancers in the ensemble
range from 17 to 23 years old. This second
company for the Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theater is composed of scholarship students
from the Dance Center. The first company is
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, com

posed of professional dancers, many of whom
are graduates of the Repertory Ensemble.
The ensemble was conceived in 1974 when
Ailey was preparing to do a tribute to Duke
Ellington. But the first company was "traveling
so much that there was not enough time to do
new work," Waters said. "So, we had the best stu
dents in the school of dance, 10 or 12 or them,
participate in a workshop" that resulted in the
televised 1974 Ford Foundation-sponsored
"Ailey Celebrates Ellington" special, said Waters.
The workshop grew into the ensemble,
which serves as a bridge between the Ailey
School in New York and professional dance ca
reers. Members of the ensemble are the cream
of the crop, as they are chosen from a group of
students who have already undergone a rigor
ous audition process for admittance into the
American Dance Center, the official school of
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. "This
is a very exciting company," said Waters. "There
is a personal depth to the individual dancers."
The youthful talent is molded into captivat
ing performances under the direction of Wa
ters, who feels that it is important to "study all
the disciplines of dance. Dancers should be as
well-rounded as possible."
She has been the artistic director since the
inception of the group in 1974. "I was a dancer
in the American Dance Theater for 81/2 years
and then started directing. 1 only intended to
do it for five years, but well, five stretched into
10 years and I'm still here. It's been a wonderful
experience. The greatest challenge, however, is
that the company is constantly growing, and it's
great to see the dancers go on to become teach
ers or dancers or actors.
"The ensemble is probably the dancers' first
company experience of any longevity," Waters

said. "That is, [ it is their first experience] learn
ing the repertoire, how to be in a company,
working with choreographers and developing
one's musical and stylistic sense.
"Like in an apprenticeship or internship,
this is the preparation to expand and grow ar
tistically, and to become the whole human be
ings and artists that they have the potential to
be."
Waters' dedication to dance comes as no
surprise. She has been involved with the art
form since it was introduced into her junior
high curriculum. She continued studying the
art at the New Dance Group, a school whose
alumni include Alvin Ailey, Sophie Maslow
and Donald McKayle, and at the Juilliard
School. With such extensive first-hand experi
ence with dance, Waters has developed a par
tiality for a certain style.
She explained, "Alvin always said to give a
personal aspect to the work ... so, I'm always
looking for new material." Through the genres
of theater, music and dance, Waters finds an
abundance of material from teachers like Don
ald McKayle, and choreographers like Martha
Graham, who all "left behind a vast, vast legacy
of modern dance," she said. This grand tradi
tion will be carried on by the talented members
of the ensemble.
"Life is ongoing and art is ongoing because
art is an expression of who we are and what we
are," said Waters. "It's a synthesis of what we're
about and expresses it succinctly, whether it's
painting, sculpture or dance. At some point it
will surface, and it will find you and you will
find it.
"Think of it as an universal language with no
words that travels all over the world with no
barriers."
