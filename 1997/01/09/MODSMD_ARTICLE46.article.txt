both exotic and familiar but all equally

BOOK REVIEW

Culinary analogies aside, suffice it to say
that the "Best American Short Stories 1996,"

edited by author John
Kdgar Wideman, con
stitutes a first-rate
meal. Aside from one
or two less-than-spec
tacular offerings, the
anthology shines like a
kaleidoscope, each
writer offering a dif
ferent vision, reflect
ing light in an unex
pected manner.
Wideman recalls in
his introduction the
struggle to cut down
to 20 or so the 120-
odd stories given to
him by series editor
Katrina Kenison, who
herself had to comb
through thousands of

offerings,the anthology shines like a

reflecting light in an unexpected manner.

stories published in 1995 by a number of mag
azines.
Hesitant and unsure of which criteria to
use, Wideman considered forming a rationale,
"thematic, stylistic, political," to make the de
cisions but says he ultimately chose to select
artistic pi cs that rebelled against the preva
lent "entertainment" mindset of American
mass media.
Wideman's final criterion, conscious or
not, may have had more to do with authorial
voice and personal narratives. Wideman is
known for integrating strong autobiographi
cal elements in his Homewood trilogy, and his
interest shows here, for the collection is riddled
with powerful voices.
Sometimes the voices are quiet but shatter
ing, as in Jamaica Kincaid's "In Roseau," or
even hypnotic, as in Melanie Rae Thon's tour
de force "Xmas, Jamaica Plain."
Wideman is attracted to the singularity and
sheer force of first-person (fictional, of course)
narratives, which make up the majority of the
selections. Wideman is particularly interested
in women's voices, to female narrators who fall
in and out of love with themselves and others.
There's the out-of-work dancer who gets a
job as a nude model in Angela Parrino's
"Sculpture 1," the married college instructor
who loses herself to the advances of a former
lover in Deborah Galyans "The Incredible Ap
pearing Man" and the bride who wakes up one

day in love with her husband in Akhil Sharma's
"II You Sing Like that for Me." Sharma's story is
particularly strong.
"I will love Rajinder slowly and carefully
and cunningly, 1 thought," speaks the narrator
about her husband, "and suddenly felt peace
ful again, as if I were a lake and the world could
only form ripples on my surface, while the
calm beneath continued in solitude."
The entire collection is full of such aching,
poetic passages. It seems like a century has
gone by since the heyday ofthe dull, minimal
ist prose of such revered '80s literary "stars" as
Ann Beattieand Bret Easton Ellis.
One special surprise in the anthology is

"Past My Future," narrated by an adolescent
girl but written by novelist David Huddle.
"Past my Future" begins in media res, with
Robert, a 41-year-old married man proposi
tioning Marcy, the 14-year-old daughter of
some family friends. Their relationship, how
ever, develops into more than just a sexual en
counter.

As their secret afternoon
encounters proceed, Marcy
fulfills her own curiosity
about the "adult world" in
habited by her lover, her
lover's wife and Marcy's par
ents. Her coming of age is
emotionally devastating, but
Huddle handles it with the
caution of a diamond-cutter.
The writers included in
the collection range from
grand master Joyce Carol
Oates ("Ghost Girls") to rel
ative newcomer Junot Diaz
("Ysrael"), and there is ap
parently no relation between
any of them other than the
fact that many of them, like
Stephen Dixon ("Sleep"), or

Sometimes the voices are quiet but shattering,
as in Jamaica Kincaid's "In Roseau," or even
hypnotic, as in Melanie Rae Thon's
tour de force "Xmas, Jamaica Plain."

Oates herself, pop up with frequency in the se
ries.
Two of the 24 writers, however, Jason
Brown and Lan Samantha Chang, have some-

thing in common: They're both here at Stan
ford's Creative Writing Department. Brown is
a first-year Stegner Fellow and Chang is a Jones
Lecturer, teaching "Intermediate Fiction Writ
ing" this winter. Both have studied under the
guidance of English Prof. John L'Heureux, but
their stories couldn't be more different.
Brown's "Driving the Heart" takes the form
of a journey, figuratively and psychologically.
The narrator, a seemingly jaded delivery man,
is crossing from Boston to his hometown to
deliver a heart to a hospital. A patient will die if
the heart doesn't arrive on time.
Brown takes this "ER"-esque scenario and
turns it into an examination of mutual moral

and physical responsi
bility. The story is full of
little miracles, suggest
ing the ironies and in
congruities of the sim
ple act of staying alive.
Chang's story,
"The Eve of the Spirit
Festival," is entirely dif
ferent, and so is her
writing style.
Like many of her
published stories, "The
Eve ..centers around
a young woman in a
state of emotional
paralysis, watching
helplessly as others love
her or choose not to.
With the death of her
mother, young Claudia

hungers for the love of her father, who seems to
prefer Claudia's rebellious sister Emily. The
story is also about ghosts, those who visit us
and those who don't.
As a stylist, Chang wields striking language,
rejecting even the most tempting cliche and
embracing only the mot juste. To describe a

sunset, Chang writes that "the evening sun
glowed garnet red through the dark tent of
(Emily's] hair." And when the full moon
shines, it bathes the sisters' room "in silver and

shadow."
Chang has a Chekhovian taste for hinting at
her characters' inner lives, and her gift for
compassion and compression suggests the
hand of the Russian master. Her signature clos
ing style — the fictional equivalent of a Berg
manian close-up — is still absolutely shatter
ing.
Other noteworthy stories include Alice
Adams' twisted look at eating disorders in
"Complicities" and Lynne Sharon Schwartz'
delightful story of middle-age romance, "The
Trip to Halawa Valley."
There are some disappointments. Robert
Olen Butler's "lealous Husband Returns in
Form of Parrot" sounds mostly contrived, like
an exercise with a self-imposed constraint and

little heart. And
Ho Davies' "The
Silver Screen,"
about a group of
rebel communists
in war-time
Malaysia, feels like
a novel with all the
good parts cut out.
The "Best
American" series is
the oldest antholo
gy of its kind, pub
lishing over the
years short fiction
by everyone from
Theodore Dreiser
to Ernest Heming
way It's still one of
the best and de
servedly a regional
best seller. Kenison

is currently reading all past anthologies for the
"Best American Short Stories of the Century,"
to be chosen by John Updike. The choice will
be a tough one to say the least.

stories published in 1995 by a number of mag

Hesitant and unsure of which criteria to
use, Wideman considered forming a rationale,
"thematic, stylistic, political," to make the de
cisions but says he ultimately chose to select
artistic pi cs that rebelled against the preva
lent "entertainment" mindset of American
mass media.
Wideman's final criterion, conscious or
not, may have had more to do with authorial
voice and personal narratives. Wideman is
known for integrating strong autobiographi
cal elements in his Homewood trilogy, and his
interest shows here, for the collection is riddled
with powerful voices.
Sometimes the voices are quiet but shatter
ing, as in Jamaica Kincaid's "In Roseau," or
even hypnotic, as in Melanie Rae Thon's tour
de force "Xmas, Jamaica Plain."
Wideman is attracted to the singularity and
sheer force of first-person (fictional, of course)
narratives, which make up the majority of the
selections. Wideman is particularly interested
in women's voices, to female narrators who fall
in and out of love with themselves and others.
There's the out-of-work dancer who gets a
job as a nude model in Angela Parrino's
"Sculpture 1," the married college instructor
who loses herself to the advances of a former
lover in Deborah Galyans "The Incredible Ap
pearing Man" and the bride who wakes up one

day in love with her husband in Akhil Sharma's
"II You Sing Like that for Me." Sharma's story is
particularly strong.
"I will love Rajinder slowly and carefully
and cunningly, 1 thought," speaks the narrator
about her husband, "and suddenly felt peace
ful again, as if I were a lake and the world could
only form ripples on my surface, while the
calm beneath continued in solitude."
The entire collection is full of such aching,
poetic passages. It seems like a century has
gone by since the heyday ofthe dull, minimal
ist prose of such revered '80s literary "stars" as
Ann Beattieand Bret Easton Ellis.
One special surprise in the anthology is

"Past My Future," narrated by an adolescent
girl but written by novelist David Huddle.
"Past my Future" begins in media res, with
Robert, a 41-year-old married man proposi
tioning Marcy, the 14-year-old daughter of
some family friends. Their relationship, how
ever, develops into more than just a sexual en
counter.

As their secret afternoon
encounters proceed, Marcy
fulfills her own curiosity
about the "adult world" in
habited by her lover, her
lover's wife and Marcy's par
ents. Her coming of age is
emotionally devastating, but
Huddle handles it with the
caution of a diamond-cutter.
The writers included in
the collection range from
grand master Joyce Carol
Oates ("Ghost Girls") to rel
ative newcomer Junot Diaz
("Ysrael"), and there is ap
parently no relation between
any of them other than the
fact that many of them, like
Stephen Dixon ("Sleep"), or

Sometimes the voices are quiet but shattering,
as in Jamaica Kincaid's "In Roseau," or even
hypnotic, as in Melanie Rae Thon's
tour de force "Xmas, Jamaica Plain."

Oates herself, pop up with frequency in the se

Two of the 24 writers, however, Jason
Brown and Lan Samantha Chang, have some-

thing in common: They're both here at Stan
ford's Creative Writing Department. Brown is
a first-year Stegner Fellow and Chang is a Jones
Lecturer, teaching "Intermediate Fiction Writ
ing" this winter. Both have studied under the
guidance of English Prof. John L'Heureux, but
their stories couldn't be more different.
Brown's "Driving the Heart" takes the form
of a journey, figuratively and psychologically.
The narrator, a seemingly jaded delivery man,
is crossing from Boston to his hometown to
deliver a heart to a hospital. A patient will die if
the heart doesn't arrive on time.
Brown takes this "ER"-esque scenario and
turns it into an examination of mutual moral

and physical responsi
bility. The story is full of
little miracles, suggest
ing the ironies and in
congruities of the sim
ple act of staying alive.
Chang's story,
"The Eve of the Spirit
Festival," is entirely dif
ferent, and so is her
writing style.
Like many of her
published stories, "The
Eve ..centers around
a young woman in a
state of emotional
paralysis, watching
helplessly as others love
her or choose not to.
With the death of her
mother, young Claudia

hungers for the love of her father, who seems to
prefer Claudia's rebellious sister Emily. The
story is also about ghosts, those who visit us
and those who don't.
As a stylist, Chang wields striking language,
rejecting even the most tempting cliche and
embracing only the mot juste. To describe a

sunset, Chang writes that "the evening sun
glowed garnet red through the dark tent of
(Emily's] hair." And when the full moon
shines, it bathes the sisters' room "in silver and

shadow."
Chang has a Chekhovian taste for hinting at
her characters' inner lives, and her gift for
compassion and compression suggests the
hand of the Russian master. Her signature clos
ing style — the fictional equivalent of a Berg
manian close-up — is still absolutely shatter
ing.
Other noteworthy stories include Alice
Adams' twisted look at eating disorders in
"Complicities" and Lynne Sharon Schwartz'
delightful story of middle-age romance, "The
Trip to Halawa Valley."
There are some disappointments. Robert
Olen Butler's "lealous Husband Returns in
Form of Parrot" sounds mostly contrived, like
an exercise with a self-imposed constraint and

little heart. And
Ho Davies' "The
Silver Screen,"
about a group of
rebel communists
in war-time
Malaysia, feels like
a novel with all the
good parts cut out.
The "Best
American" series is
the oldest antholo
gy of its kind, pub
lishing over the
years short fiction
by everyone from
Theodore Dreiser
to Ernest Heming
way It's still one of
the best and de
servedly a regional
best seller. Kenison

is currently reading all past anthologies for the
"Best American Short Stories of the Century,"
to be chosen by John Updike. The choice will
be a tough one to say the least.
