# Stanford Writers Talk About That Thing They Do
## Jason Brown on discovery and desperation 
### Curtis Sittenfeld 
According to Jason Brown, "A great short
story does what a poem does — that sense of
reading line to line. It's kind of a mysterious
process to read, and for the writer [it's] a
process of discovery."
Apparently, Brown's own "Driving the
Heart" is just such a story. After being pub
lished in The Mississippi Review, a literary
magazine, it was selected for inclusion in
"The Best American Short Stories 1996" —
one of the highest honors a short story can
receive.
For Brown, who at the age of 27 is in his
first year of a two-year Wallace Stegner Fel
lowship in the Creative Writing Department
at Stanford, this honor brings both new op
portunities and added pressure.
When he learned that his story would be
in the annual anthology, he said, "It was ex

tremely exciting. Ever since 1 started writing,
it had been the goal. For the short story
writer, it's the hall of fame. 1 never thought I
would get something in, especially at such a
young age."
Brown believes chance plays a role in
whether a story is chosen to be in the an
thology. The editors "say they read [the sto
ries] blind, but they're always trying to get a
balance of humorous and heavy stories and
gender and race," Brown said. "It's not just
luck. I like my story. But it's somewhat
luck."
Certainly Brown has experienced more
luck than the narrator of his story, a young
man who has bounced around the country
until he ends up back in his native New Eng
land, earning money by driving around
body parts that will be used for transplants.
"Most of the day jobs involve eyes, livers,
morphine or spleens traveling to or from

arts in creative
writing from Cor
nell University. Al
though he said he
enjoys and respects
the other Stegner
Fellows (nine of
whom work on fic
tion, and 10 of
whom work in a
separate workshop
on poetry), he has
found that the self
consciousness of
such programs can
be paralyzing.
"The more 1
talk about writing
and think about
writing, the more
difficult it is to do
it,"he said. "It's
such an interior,
private thing. The
more 1 make it ex
terior, the more
difficult it is to go
inside and do the
writing. My ego
gets involved. My
ego wasn't in
volved before."
The national
recognition may
be recent, but writ
ing has been an
important part of
Brown's life since
childhood. "I start-

Ed writing when I was 12. I
wrote little plays and journals,"
he said. After being kicked out
of two boarding schools for
drinking and drugs when he
was a teen-ager, Brown fin
ished high school in Portland,
Maine. As a senior, he wrote,
directed and acted in a play that
won a state-wide competition.
"[Writing] was the one thing 1
could do, even though I was
dyslexic as a kid," he said.
At Bowdoin College in
Brunswick, Maine, Brown
started as an English major but
became disillusioned and
switched to comparative reli
gion. "I read so much [fiction]
on my own. It fed my writing
and fed my life. I read in such a

the airport," the narrator ex
plains. "Hearts travel at night."
Brown, who once held a job
similar to his narrator's, said the
story came out of a specific time.
"I could never write this story
again. My mind was at a certain
place. I felt a little more at the
edge psychologically. 1 didn't
have much money. I was just
writing this story, not feeling like
a writer. I felt a desperation then
that I don't feel now. As I've
changed, I've had to change the
way I write."
Before coming to Stanford,
Brown received a master's of fine

personal way. I didn't understand how I was
supposed to read for concepts and theories
and historical analysis."
Now that Brown is writing fiction to feed
other people's lives, the biggest challenge is
staying focused. "I just finished a novel, and
it's just terrible," he said.
Brown gave the novel, which is about a
crew coach at a boarding school, to the other
Stegner Fellows and received somewhat dis
couraging responses. "When you get a lot of
negative feedback, it's hard to work. You hear
all those voices in your head that say, 'It just
sucks.'
"It makes me wonder whether I should
just stick with short stories."
