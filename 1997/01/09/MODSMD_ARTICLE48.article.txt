# Lan Samantha Chang on dislocation and emotional energy

### Samuel Park 
Writer Lan Samantha Chang doesn't walk
around wearing a trenchcoat or a hat, but when
she looks at the motivations of her characters,
she reveals the keen sense of a detective.
Using pen and paper instead of a magnifying
lens and a hidden camera, Chang writes fiction
to shed light onto the incongruities of love, life
and the country that obsesses her.
"I've always been fascinated by China," said
Chang, a daughter of immigrants. "My parents
left their families. Part of our whole tradition is
invisible, and I can feel it. My parents don't talk
about it, and because of that I'm the detective,
trying to find out some past secrets."
Chang, whose short stories have appeared in
The Atlantic Monthly, Story and "Best American
Short Stories" in 1994 and 1996, writes primari

ly about Asian Americans and their dislocation
â€” cultural, emotional or otherwise.
"My subject matter mirrors the writer's
process. A writer makes meaning out of discon
nections, taking things that are mystifying and
building a bridge between the incongruities,"
Chang said. "Likewise, as an Asian American, I
have to stretch over two worlds and make mean
ing over the colliding of these two cultures."
Chang grew up in the predominantly Cau
casian town of Appleton, Wise., an experience
that she recounts as "very hard" and "isolating."
Chang felt like an outsider, observing others. But
the experience was good for a writer because she
constantly had to adapt and put herself inside the
heads of other people.
It was only after she went to Yale University,
that she discovered an Asian-American commu
nity. "In some ways my interest in writing about
Asian Americans is a relief at finding a commu
nity after a period of isolation," she said.
Chang eventually majored in East Asian Stud
ies. Later, she earned a degree in economics
from Harvard, a master's of fine arts in creative
writing from the lowa Writer's Workshop and a
Stegner Fellowship from Stanford, where she
now teaches "Intermediate Fiction Writing."
Five major publishing companies (she won't
tell which) have expressed interest in the past in
publishing a book of hers, but Chang turned
them all down so she could focus on the craft of
writing and produce a collection with a coher
ent theme.
Chang recently finished that collection, which
is now "on the block" and likely to be sold with
in the next few months. Titled "Hunger," after
the novella that is the centerpiece of the book, it
features a number of short stories that have ap
peared in The Atlantic and the literary maga
zines Prairie Schooner and Greensboro Review.
Chang's most recent publication has been in
"Best American," with the story "The Eve of the
Spirit Festival," about the love between a father
and his two daughters.
"I write about people who I have deep, deep
feelings about, like rny family," Chang said. "I
get my emotional energy from them."
