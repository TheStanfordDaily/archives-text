# Beyond Dumplings
## Four nearby places to do some dim sum 
### Julie Tsai 
Growing up in the Midwest, I gained a
knack for nasal intonation, basketball fa
naticism and a dilettante's joy for Chinese-
Americana. Alas, 1 did not also gain a knack
for speaking Chinese.
As anybody who has been an ignoramus
of her relatives' mother tongue knows, the
flipside is that one becomes quickly ac
quainted with miming comprehension. For

RESTAURANT REVIEW

American has likely experienced the dilem
mas of faking at the Chinese restaurant:
Fork or chopsticks? Tea or grape Fanta?
Chinese or English? Which dialect were we
in? Faking becomes particularly problem
atic if there happens to be an all-Chinese
menu.
I had the good fortune to be guided
through this potential minefield by knowl
edgeable parents on weekend excursions to
Chicago's Chinatown for dim sum. But
even if you are among those uninitiated to
the excess and pleasure that is dim sum, fear
not.
The leap from initiate to would-be ex
pert and from there to gustatorily glutted is
a mental one. It is thus, gentle reader, that 1
feel particularly qualified to take you on a
whirlwind survey of four Bay Area proffer
ers of this Chinese tradition of feeding and
family.
First, a brief explanation of dim sum. It's
Cantonese for "a touch of the heart" al
though 1 had always thought it meant
"goodies" or "sweets." In any case, what
that translates to is a meal — preferably
eaten by a group — composed of many ap
petizer-to-small-entree-size dishes, some

of them sweet, most of them not
Dim sum can he served a la
pointing at the food, on serving
trays or metal carts steered hy
rude yet charming waitstaff, or
via orders checked off a carbon
copied paper menu. Classy, no?
I feel it's sacrilege to serve it
at any time besides brunch, but
several industrious area restau
rants have innovated the dinner
dim sum. If this is too much to
explain to potential but reluc
tant brunchmates, it may also
be described courtesy of my
friend M. as "that thing with
lots and lots of dumplings."
And tripe and chicken feet and
jellyfish for the truly hard-core.
One more thing: This, like
any good Chinese meal, must
be eaten family-style so bring
your kin, be they blood or sur
rogate. The table is circular and
so is the lazy Susan. That means
everybody's got dibs on every

dish, and there's payback for hogging fa
vorites. Break food with the other end of
your chopsticks so no germs go around.
When you fill your teacup, you fill 'em all
up. Thus we proceed, the more the merrier
— and more food for everyone.
First course, Ming's
Posh by Chinese restaurant standards of
service and decor, it's easy to see the appeal.
Regardless of what you think of the grub,
Ming's is the hands-down winner in the
packaging and comfort departments. The
waitstaff is courteous and English-speaking;
the decor is pretty and un-garish in that
bland, contemporary sort of way. Most im
portantly, nobody does a more attractive,
accessible menu. Ming's even offers limited
take-out / delivery dim sum, which seems
beside the point to me but to each their own.
P. and 1 went on a shellfish rampage, con
suming ha gau, steamed shrimp dumpling
in transparent rice wrapper, fried crab claw,
shrimp-stuffed bell pepper and fried
shrimp dumplings.
While our selection involved an uncom
fortable amount of grease, these were all
competently prepared, as was the hot and
sour soup we ordered. For those interested
in the more breakfast-like items, I spied
steaming rice porridge and you tiao, long
sticks of fried dough. All the standards can
be found, although the menu on the whole
leans toward the fried. However, Ming's is a
fine place to start your dim sum explo
ration and to bring guests who may be
picky about such things as clean menus and
tablecloths.
As you must know however, there's no
free lunch. One does pay for the gussied-up
surroundings. The check, including tax and
tip, was a good 11/2 times the average of
the next three places.

Royal Palace,
local favorite
A personal favorite,
Royal Palace was the
test site to which 1 took
my friend C. There we
gorged on myriad
dumplings, you tiao
with soy sauce, rice
noodle rolls, turnip
cakes and precious lit
tle custard tarts. The
grease quotient was
definitely more favor
able than at Ming's.
A word of warning:
While Royal Palace is
certainly no hole in the
wall, the ambience is
more in keeping with
its authentic peers.
Dim sum is served on
the second floor where
a spacious dining
room is outfitted in
dark red tones and fake
jewel-encrusted gold
dragon detailing,
which can be seen as
tacky or endearing de
pending on your
mood.

A typical waiter's
description of a dish might be, "Shrimp —
yummy, yummy." It's better to look for your
self anyway. The 60-plus-item menu minces
no words. Selections include mixed inter
nals, salt pepper squid and chicken feet with
black bean sauce. Don't worry, there's still
plenty for the dumpling-and-egg-roll
crowd.
If you're interested in food quality, price
and location, Royal Palace can't be beat for
Stanford residents. They also serve dim sum
at night. Not as user-friendly as Ming's, but
the suited-up hosts are willing to help — al
though they were awfully grouchy when we
went to take pictures.

The diamond in the rough!
Goldensun Restaurant
When friend E. first suggested this shop
ping plaza-embedded gem in San Jose, I
balked at the distance. But, dear reader, it
you are willing to venture into the wilderness
a bit, you too can partake of what ranks
among the best dim sum I've ever had, and
the cheapest. What's not to love?
Upon entering Goldensun, you will be
greeted by a big ugly fish in a tank, dividing
the "lobby" from the dining room. A screen
and some painted Buddha-ish porcelain of
fers privacy. Off to the side, a neglected,
draped chamber half-heartedly attempts to
be a bar. Orders are taken not by strolling
waiters but by individual carbon paper
menus. The waiters don't respond to English
so it'd be wise to bring along someone who
can speak Chinese or, at any rate, can order
Chinese.
Among such charms is served dim sum of
a quality I'd previously only heard of at my
mother's knee. Steamed dumplings bursting
with juice in perfectly delicate skin and sym
metrical swirls. An ideal compromise of
bread and cake giving new life to ordinary
steamed BBQ pork buns. Pool ball-size
sesame balls with sweetened red bean paste
that are ungreasy and practically fluffy.
Goldensun also has the magical quality of
pricing all their dishes at $1.50 apiece, even
exotica like crab claw and shark's fin
dumplings (although the integrity of the
shark's fin was dubious).
It's not really that far. Take 101 South and
exit on Meridian St.; from there, it's about 10
minutes down on the left side of the street.

pert and from there to gustatorily glutted is
a mental one. It is thus, gentle reader, that 1
feel particularly qualified to take you on a
whirlwind survey of four Bay Area proffer
ers of this Chinese tradition of feeding and
family.
First, a brief explanation of dim sum. It's
Cantonese for "a touch of the heart" al
though 1 had always thought it meant
"goodies" or "sweets." In any case, what
that translates to is a meal — preferably
eaten by a group — composed of many ap
petizer-to-small-entree-size dishes, some

of them sweet, most of them not
Dim sum can he served a la
pointing at the food, on serving
trays or metal carts steered hy
rude yet charming waitstaff, or
via orders checked off a carbon
copied paper menu. Classy, no?
I feel it's sacrilege to serve it
at any time besides brunch, but
several industrious area restau
rants have innovated the dinner
dim sum. If this is too much to
explain to potential but reluc
tant brunchmates, it may also
be described courtesy of my
friend M. as "that thing with
lots and lots of dumplings."
And tripe and chicken feet and
jellyfish for the truly hard-core.
One more thing: This, like
any good Chinese meal, must
be eaten family-style so bring
your kin, be they blood or sur
rogate. The table is circular and
so is the lazy Susan. That means
everybody's got dibs on every

dish, and there's payback for hogging fa
vorites. Break food with the other end of
your chopsticks so no germs go around.
When you fill your teacup, you fill 'em all
up. Thus we proceed, the more the merrier
— and more food for everyone.
First course, Ming's
Posh by Chinese restaurant standards of
service and decor, it's easy to see the appeal.
Regardless of what you think of the grub,
Ming's is the hands-down winner in the
packaging and comfort departments. The
waitstaff is courteous and English-speaking;
the decor is pretty and un-garish in that
bland, contemporary sort of way. Most im
portantly, nobody does a more attractive,
accessible menu. Ming's even offers limited
take-out / delivery dim sum, which seems
beside the point to me but to each their own.
P. and 1 went on a shellfish rampage, con
suming ha gau, steamed shrimp dumpling
in transparent rice wrapper, fried crab claw,
shrimp-stuffed bell pepper and fried
shrimp dumplings.
While our selection involved an uncom
fortable amount of grease, these were all
competently prepared, as was the hot and
sour soup we ordered. For those interested
in the more breakfast-like items, I spied
steaming rice porridge and you tiao, long
sticks of fried dough. All the standards can
be found, although the menu on the whole
leans toward the fried. However, Ming's is a
fine place to start your dim sum explo
ration and to bring guests who may be
picky about such things as clean menus and
tablecloths.
As you must know however, there's no
free lunch. One does pay for the gussied-up
surroundings. The check, including tax and
tip, was a good 11/2 times the average of
the next three places.

Royal Palace,
local favorite
A personal favorite,
Royal Palace was the
test site to which 1 took
my friend C. There we
gorged on myriad
dumplings, you tiao
with soy sauce, rice
noodle rolls, turnip
cakes and precious lit
tle custard tarts. The
grease quotient was
definitely more favor
able than at Ming's.
A word of warning:
While Royal Palace is
certainly no hole in the
wall, the ambience is
more in keeping with
its authentic peers.
Dim sum is served on
the second floor where
a spacious dining
room is outfitted in
dark red tones and fake
jewel-encrusted gold
dragon detailing,
which can be seen as
tacky or endearing de
pending on your
mood.

A typical waiter's
description of a dish might be, "Shrimp —
yummy, yummy." It's better to look for your
self anyway. The 60-plus-item menu minces
no words. Selections include mixed inter
nals, salt pepper squid and chicken feet with
black bean sauce. Don't worry, there's still
plenty for the dumpling-and-egg-roll
crowd.
If you're interested in food quality, price
and location, Royal Palace can't be beat for
Stanford residents. They also serve dim sum
at night. Not as user-friendly as Ming's, but
the suited-up hosts are willing to help — al
though they were awfully grouchy when we
went to take pictures.

The diamond in the rough!
Goldensun Restaurant
When friend E. first suggested this shop
ping plaza-embedded gem in San Jose, I
balked at the distance. But, dear reader, it
you are willing to venture into the wilderness
a bit, you too can partake of what ranks
among the best dim sum I've ever had, and
the cheapest. What's not to love?
Upon entering Goldensun, you will be
greeted by a big ugly fish in a tank, dividing
the "lobby" from the dining room. A screen
and some painted Buddha-ish porcelain of
fers privacy. Off to the side, a neglected,
draped chamber half-heartedly attempts to
be a bar. Orders are taken not by strolling
waiters but by individual carbon paper
menus. The waiters don't respond to English
so it'd be wise to bring along someone who
can speak Chinese or, at any rate, can order
Chinese.
Among such charms is served dim sum of
a quality I'd previously only heard of at my
mother's knee. Steamed dumplings bursting
with juice in perfectly delicate skin and sym
metrical swirls. An ideal compromise of
bread and cake giving new life to ordinary
steamed BBQ pork buns. Pool ball-size
sesame balls with sweetened red bean paste
that are ungreasy and practically fluffy.
Goldensun also has the magical quality of
pricing all their dishes at $1.50 apiece, even
exotica like crab claw and shark's fin
dumplings (although the integrity of the
shark's fin was dubious).
It's not really that far. Take 101 South and
exit on Meridian St.; from there, it's about 10
minutes down on the left side of the street.

Sometimes the most appetizing thing is the decor.

One way to get an order of dim sum is to point at it when the
waitstaff passes by with the metal cart.
