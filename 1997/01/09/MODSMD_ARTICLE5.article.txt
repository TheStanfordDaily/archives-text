# Changes made to Admit Weekend
## Organizers seeking core of hosts willing to be available at any time 
### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
The Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions has changed Admit Weekend, divid
ing hosting responsibilities in an effort to
improve the program for both current
and prospective Stanford students.
The new plan will differentiate be
tween students who become actively in
volved with the prospective freshmen and
those who simply offer a floor on which to
sleep.
The first group, "house hosts," will be
responsible for a group of about 10
prospective students, eating meals with
them throughout the weekend, attending
evening events and spending time an
swering questions. The second group,

"room hosts," will give
prospective students a
place to sleep but will not
make a significant time
commitment.
Admit Weekend,
which this year will run
April 17-19, offers
prospective students a
chance to experience Uni
versity life, in all facets, by

living with a Stanford student. The week
end's coordinators feel that this year's
changes will benefit both the visitors and
their hosts.
Putting students in groups with a
common house host will give them a sort
of base of operations for the weekend,
said Admission Counselor Michelle

Friedland. "Pro fros will have a group of
people who they can be with all the time.
There always will be someone there to
help them."
And while visiting students will not be
required or expected to spend all of their
time in that group, she said, they will at
least come together for meals.
Organizing groups will also benefit the
prospective freshmen by introducing
them to potential classmates, thus giving
them a chance to leave campus already
having developed friendships at Stan
ford, said Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sion and Financial Aids James Montoya.
The committee also hopes the changed
program will appeal to more current


Montoya
Stanford students than in the past.
Any student in either an all-fresh
man or four-class dorm is eligible to
be a host, but freshmen are being
targeted specifically. The Admis
sions Office sent letters to every

member of the Class of 2000 yes
terday — each one individually
signed by Montoya — requesting
"100-percent participation from
the freshman class."
Sophomores Rebecca Wahl and
Tammie Presser, heads of host re
cruitment and publicity for Admit
Weekend, said the new plan is at
tractive because it allows students
to get involved at varying levels of

commitment.
"Not everyone has enough time
to devote to pro fros," said Wahl.
"We want to make sure that there
will be this core of people (house
hosts) that is willing and ready at all
times."
While becoming a room host is
fairly simple — online registration
will start in February — house
hosts will be selected through an

application process that begins
Monday and ends in two weeks.
This has the potential to create
extra work for the Admit Weekend
committee, but Wahl said that
doesn't dampen excitement about
the new procedure.
"In the end, it will be better for
us because we know that these peo
ple are qualified, want to do it and
are totally enthusiastic," she said.
