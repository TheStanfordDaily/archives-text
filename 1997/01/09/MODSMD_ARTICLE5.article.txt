# Changes made to Admit Weekend
## Organizers seeking core of hosts willing to be available at any time 
### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
The Office of Undergraduate Admis
sions has changed Admit Weekend, divid
ing hosting responsibilities in an effort to
improve the program for both current
and prospective Stanford students.
The new plan will differentiate be
tween students who become actively in
volved with the prospective freshmen and
those who simply offer a floor on which to
sleep.
The first group, "house hosts," will be
responsible for a group of about 10
prospective students, eating meals with
them throughout the weekend, attending
evening events and spending time an
swering questions. The second group,

"room hosts," will give
prospective students a
place to sleep but will not
make a significant time
commitment.
Admit Weekend,
which this year will run
April 17-19, offers
prospective students a
chance to experience Uni
versity life, in all facets, by

living with a Stanford student. The week
end's coordinators feel that this year's
changes will benefit both the visitors and
their hosts.
Putting students in groups with a
common house host will give them a sort
of base of operations for the weekend,
said Admission Counselor Michelle

Friedland. "Pro fros will have a group of
people who they can be with all the time.
There always will be someone there to
help them."
And while visiting students will not be
required or expected to spend all of their
time in that group, she said, they will at
least come together for meals.
Organizing groups will also benefit the
prospective freshmen by introducing
them to potential classmates, thus giving
them a chance to leave campus already
having developed friendships at Stan
ford, said Dean of Undergraduate Admis
sion and Financial Aids James Montoya.
The committee also hopes the changed
program will appeal to more current
