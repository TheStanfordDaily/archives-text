# The
						odyssey ends at Hong Kong Flower Lounge
## 
### 
This is also a bit of a drive, but it does bring you
into a part of the Bay Area that's pretty multicultur
al, i.e., there were some great-looking places for Ko
rean BBQ beef dinners, and there's a larger, more or
nate Hong Kong Flower Lounge just up the street. As
G. and I couldn't find parking — and the menu is al
legedly the same — we settled for this one on the
next block.
Here, waiters and waitresses walked around with
serving platters, offering suggestions to G. and me in
Chinese. Although G. and I are both Asian-looking,
this was unfortunately not enough to help us navi
gate Cantonese. Our solution was to wave the
servers over while I asked questions in obnoxiously
loud English. There is also the option of ordering off
a carbon paper menu.
Offering a nice variety of 45 dishes from $ 1.80 to
$3.00 per plate, Hong Kong Flower Lounge had the
best range of vegetarian and dessert, even including
the difficult-to-find thousand layer sponge cake. G.
and 1 puzzled over tasty vegetarian rolls with oyster
sauce, finally agreeing on a composition of carrot,
green onion, mushroom, water chestnut and who
knows what wrapped in a delicious wrinkly bean
curd.
The stuffed sweet rice wrapped with Lotus leaves
was ingeniously served in three miniature packages
rather than the standard single lump. If you do make
it out to Millbrac, make sure to have the fresh mango
pudding. Served in a cute heart-shaped mold, its big
chunks of mango and a light soy-milk sauce were a
highlight.
And, having done my duty, I bid you to go forth
and eat until you bust. Gan bei to you and yours.
