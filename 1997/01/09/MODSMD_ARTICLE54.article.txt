## Diva All the Way Madonna finally becomes a movie star with the superb 'Evita' 
### 
"Evita," opening tomorrow in
the Bay Area, revitalizes American
cinema with its innovative inte
gration of music and film. Aside
from sappy Disney films featuring
wide-eyed dames singing of blue
corned moons and magic carpets,
a void of musical boldness has per
sisted despite the inadequate at
tempts of productions such as
"That Thing You Do."
The film contains almost no di
alogue; the soundtrack is practi
cally a straight recording of the
movie. Andrew Lloyd Webber's
music remains strong and the per
formers in the film far outshine
those in the original Broadway
production, starring Fatti Lupone
and Mandy Patinkin. The music is
extremely enjoyable. Free advice:
Watch this movie in a theater with
a quality sound system for the
prime "Evita" experience.
Madonna delivers an unexpect
edly good performance as Argen
tine diva Eva Peron, wife of dicta
tor luan Peron. She skillfully por
trays Evita as a strong woman, as a
survivor and as the most effective
"social climber since Cinderella."
Antonio Banderas also turns in
a strong performance as Che, the
narrator of the film's action. His
character lends a flavor of cyni
cism to "Evita," but also serves as a
vehicle through which back
ground information on Argenti
na's tumultuous political history is
delivered.
His narration also allows for a
deeper understanding of Eva

Heron and cultivates a strong at
tachment between the audience
and her, despite his numerous
negative assertions of her charac
ter. Banderas plays the bitter role
well and provides several dark,
comical moments.
However, Banderas doesn't
enunciate well enough at times in
his lyrics and the audience is left
without a complete understand
ing of the Argentine political
movements of the time.
The music is also dubbed over
the action of the film. This may
disorient moviegoers at first when
they see that the singing isn't com
ing directly out of the actors'
mouths. However, this amounts to
only a minor problem; the rich
quality of the music overwhelms
any discomfort produced by the
overlapping.
Another source of distraction
arises in the waltz scene between
Banderas and Madonna. The seg
ment is magnificent, featuring
the pair dancing across three sep
arate locations ranging from
Buenos Aires to Budapest to Lon
don. It's well-known that Madon
na became pregnant during the
filming of this movie, and one
can't keep from noticing the in
cipient bulge of her womb in the
clinging gown.
However, these amount to only
minor distractions and are over
shadowed by the powerful cine
matography dominating the pro
duction. This and the musical tal
ent prevalent in the film make for
a high-quality transition from the
stage to screen.
