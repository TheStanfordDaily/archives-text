# The 						Great White Dane
## Kenneth Branagh's monumental 'Hamlet' exceeds all expectations 
### 
As writer / director/ star Kenneth
Branagh describes it in a press release, "Ham
let" is without question "a quite extraordi
nary story." Acted by a cast of luminaries,
spoken with the entire (four hours long!) text
and photographed in the 70-mm format, it's
easy to see that Branagh has spared nothing
to give his every strength to his latest Shake
spearean effort.

The shining stars in "Hamlet's" crown are
its performances. But it's not Robin Williams,
Jack Lemmon or Charlton Heston who bring
the film its power in their supporting roles.
The unsung stars of this production are less
er known in pop culture but masters in the
film. Derek Jacobi ("Dead Again") plays
Claudius with alternate grace and guilt,
Nicholas Farrell is a loyal Horatio and
Richard Briers (also in Branagh's "Much Ado
About Nothing') steals his scenes as Polo
nius.

Branagh himself comes alive whenever his
Hamlet has the opportunity to banter with
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern; unfortunate
ly, his speeches sometimes lack the desolation
one would imagine if contemplating life,
death, lost love and madness.
The sets and costumes, in a lavish red,
black and white 19th-century reinterpreta
tion, are stunning and rich in the clarity of
the 70-mm process. But they are distracting
rather than effectively contrasting from
Hamlet's murky introspection. Not surpris

ingly, Branagh's best speech is in the midst of
a barren, snow-covered field.
"Hamlet" is undoubtedly a feast for the
eyes, even if not completely for the soul. Sit
back and relax, but pay attention — prepare
for beautiful cinematography and great per
formances. But be sure to bring provisions of
the popcorn and soda variety — at four hours
in length plus an intermission, "Hamlet" has
plenty of time to be extraordinary, and then
some.
