# Real Genius
## Scott Hicks' 'Shine' is gorgeous to the ear and to the eye 
### 
Australian director Scott Hicks' new film
"Shine" is an extraordinary story of talent,
ambition, music and the power of love to de
stroy and redeem. It showcases the blessings
and burdens of genius, explores the difficult
dynamics of a father-son relationship and
brilliantly displays the healing power of love.
It's the true story of an incredible human tri
umph.
The unlikely hero of the film is David Helf
gott (Geoffrey Rush), a fantastically talented
Australian child prodigy who, under the vigi
lant eye of his father Peter (Armin Mueller-
Stahl), stuns the world with his piano playing.
David's talent proves to be both a blessing
and a curse; it's the carefully nurtured show
case of his father's pride, but it destroys the
family and David himself when it leads higher
than his father is willing to let him go.
The film explores beautifully the tensions
between Peter, who sees the result of his ambi
tion exceeding his grasp and refuses to accept
it, and David, who tries desperately to please
his father but is ultimately unable to deny his
gift. This early relationship with his father de
fines David's character in critical ways and
haunts him throughout his life.
As a young man (Noah Taylor), David
breaks away from his father and family and
goes to London, where he gets his first taste of
freedom and delivers himself completely to his
talent. There are scenes of gorgeous visuals:
David practicing, muffled in hat and scarf and
gloves with the fingers cut off, pounding away
on the rickety upright piano in his freezing
attic room; David chasing the white sheets of

his music, blowing onto the grand stone steps
of the Royal College of Music; the frightening
thud of David falling, wide-eyed and staring,
as the strain of performing breaks his mind.
David spends the next stage of his life isolat
ed from the world, in depressed unproductivi
ty. After his breakdown, he is committed to an
insane asylum, where he chain-smokes, plays
hopscotch and is forbidden to play music. By
this point in the film David has developed the
frantically verbose speed-stuttering speaking
style that is one of his trademarks: He chatters
constantly, frenetically fast, jibber-jabbering

about life and music and Daddy and nurse and
the weather.... This hyper-loquaciousness —
fascinating, annoying, occasionally hilarious
— displays the fragmented state of David's
mind and spirit; he is fragile but not broken,
and in many ways stronger than he looks. He
survives.
The ending's a transcendent redemption, a
hard-earned vanquishing of life's most diffi
cult trials to return to the level of the sublime.
The soaring purity of the music, swelling in
wordless waves of yearning and delight, deliv
ers the audience to the peak of this dramatic

event: catharsis.
The performances are universally excellent.
Rush has been deservedly nominated for a
Golden Globe award; the film itself has earned
five nominations, including Best Picture. Each
portrayal, from 7-year-old Alex Rafalowicz as
the young David to the famed Sir lohn Giel
gud as David's music teacher Cecil Parkes, is
superb. Hicks has assembled an immensely
talented cast and used them with exact and
unerring confidence. The result is a magnifi
cent film.
