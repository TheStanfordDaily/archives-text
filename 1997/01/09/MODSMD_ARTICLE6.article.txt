# Intellectual property issues changing
## 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
The issue of who owns the intellectual
property produced by individuals at Stan
ford is becoming increasingly controver
sial.
Intellectual property includes such
items as inventions, computer software
and academic works that are produced by
University personnel. The reason the
issue is so debated and complex is that re
cent technological advances, especially in
the biotechnology and computer software
fields, have created new perspectives on
what ownership means.
For instance, who owns computer soft
ware or inventions produced with the aid
of Stanford resources? If a professor
wanted to market his lectures or a text

book for private profit, does the Universi
ty have any say in the matter?
"These are interesting and increasing
ly significant issues," said Carey Heck
man, director of the Program on I .aw and
Technology at the Law School and a
member of the Commission on Technolo
gy in Teaching and learning. "Things
that have little marketable value now can
have some financial value." The commis
sion discussed how to handle the issues at
its December meeting.
Mary Watanave, an associate at the
Office of Technology Licensing, said the
stated University policy is that "if an in
vention was developed with more than in
cidental use of Stanford resources, it be
longs to the University."
Most of what governs faculty l>ehavior
is tradition and University rules. Tradi

tionally, papers produced by faculty, staff
and students have been considered the
personal copyrighted property of the au
thor. But the crux of the discussion is
what to do about inventions, computer
software and other technologies that can
be patented.
"It can get very complex — who owns
what," said Heck man. "With third par
ties, you might have to split the revenue
between various people, such as the pro
fessor, the University or even a graduate
student.
"What is fair? What is the relationship
between faculty and the University?
What are the University's goals?" added
Heckman, reiterating many of the ques
tions surrounding the issue.
