when he refused to end a two-year leave taken to protest the school's
failure to hire and tenure women of color on the faculty. Professor Bell is
the author of four books on the law, including Confronting Authority:
Confessions of an Ardent Protester.

Bell's life and work: Yost House, Okada House, Lagunita West, Castano,
