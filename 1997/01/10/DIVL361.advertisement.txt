Winter 1997 Special Seminar Offering
AAAS 205.
Sociobiology and Oppression:
Sexism, Nationalism, Racism
Professor Dow Woodward
Emeritus Professor of Biology, Stanford University
The course is designed to address the resurgence of
Social Darwinism over the past 25 years. There has
been a concerted effort attempting to legitimate a ge
netic superiority in society. This involves the claim that
people already occupy positions in society because of
their genetic makeup rather than because of societal bias
towards economic, race and gender considerations. The
course offers a critique of these "scientific" claims.
