Complete and utter domination.
That's what the 7,391 fans who showed up at Maples
Pavilion last night to see Stanford's Pacific 10 Confer
ence home opener were witness to. Ignited by an electri
fying 17-1 run to open the game, the No. 21 Cardinal
played above and beyond even the wildest expectations
of Stanford fans in delivering a 109-61 mauling of de
fending conference champion UCLA.
"They played at what I call the magic level," said
UCLA head coach Steve Lavin. "It's contagious, and pret
ty soon everyone on the team is playing at that magic level
and that's when you have a blitzkrieg like we had tonight.
"It was one of those nights where it seemed like they
could have drop kicked it from halfcourt, and it would've
went in off the glass."
Stanford didn't attempt any long-distance drop kicks,
but it did shoot the ball 32 times from behind the three
point arc, converting on a school-record 15 of them. Point
guard Brevin Knight led the three-point parade, going
six-of-seven from three-point land en route to a game
high 25 points.
It was Knight's three-pointer on Stanford's first pos
session that got the snowball rolling. On UCLA's next
possession, junior Toby Bailey's feet slipped out from
under him, allowing Knight to pick up the loose ball and
drive downcourt, where he was promptly hacked in mid
air by the Bruins' J.R. Henderson.
Henderson was whistled for an intentional foul, giving
the Cardinal two free throws and the ball. Knight made
one of two from the line, center Tim Young sank a 5-foot
er, and suddenly it was 6-0, Stanford.
But the snowball was just beginning to pick up steam.
Jelani McCoy's free throw with 18 minutes, 51 seconds
remaining in the half put UCLA on the scoreboard, but
two more Knight three-pointers sandwiched around a
Kris Weems 18-footer made it 14-1, sending Cardinal
fans into a frenzy. When senior forward Rich Jackson
buried another three-pointer to put Stanford ahead 17-1,
it appeared as though Stanford could do no wrong.
"We obviously played extremely well," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery. "Everything that we tried

worked, and most of what they tried
didn't work.
"The ball went down, and any time
that happens, you're most likely going
to win games."
The Bruins never recovered from
the early onslaught. After Stanford's
opening run, UCLA never got any
closer than 12, and by halftime Bai
ley and Co. were down 57-26. Mid
way through the second half, Mont
gomery was already beginning to

clear his bench.
"We were in our [man-to-man
defense] — they sliced it up like a side
of fries. We zoned — they sliced it up
like a side of fries. We pressed — they
sliced it up like a side of fries," Lavin
said. "They executed, and they out
competed us.
"We ran into a Stanford team that
was like a buzz-saw, and they buzz
sawed right through us."
It wasn't just on offense that Stan
ford put on a clinic. The Cardinal held
UCLA's starting five to 34-percent

shooting and out-rebounded the Bruins
45-26. From the start, Stanford domi
nated UCLA in every aspect of the
game.
"Across the board, we were just han
dled by a very good Stanford basketball
team tonight," Lavin said. "They had
guys that weren't even in our scouting
report coming in at the end of the game
and busting threes."
All told, 13 Stanford players got on
the scoreboard. Tim Young pitched in
14 points for the Cardinal and backup
point guard Art Lee — who also saw

considerable action at off-guard —
added 13.
With the win, Stanford improves to
9-2 overall and 2-1 in the Pac-10. The
Cardinal returns to Maples Pavilion
tomorrow for a 3 p.m. game against
use (7-4, 2-1).
"It was a great performance by our
basketball team tonight," Montgomery
said. "But it's one game. It's one 'W.'
We played great, they didn't, and now
we've just gotta push on and get about
our business and win a game on Satur
day."
