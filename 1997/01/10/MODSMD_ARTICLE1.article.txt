Complete and utter domination.
That's what the 7,391 fans who showed up at Maples
Pavilion last night to see Stanford's Pacific 10 Confer
ence home opener were witness to. Ignited by an electri
fying 17-1 run to open the game, the No. 21 Cardinal
played above and beyond even the wildest expectations
of Stanford fans in delivering a 109-61 mauling of de
fending conference champion UCLA.
"They played at what I call the magic level," said
UCLA head coach Steve Lavin. "It's contagious, and pret
ty soon everyone on the team is playing at that magic level
and that's when you have a blitzkrieg like we had tonight.
"It was one of those nights where it seemed like they
could have drop kicked it from halfcourt, and it would've
went in off the glass."
Stanford didn't attempt any long-distance drop kicks,
but it did shoot the ball 32 times from behind the three
point arc, converting on a school-record 15 of them. Point
guard Brevin Knight led the three-point parade, going
six-of-seven from three-point land en route to a game
high 25 points.
It was Knight's three-pointer on Stanford's first pos
session that got the snowball rolling. On UCLA's next
possession, junior Toby Bailey's feet slipped out from
under him, allowing Knight to pick up the loose ball and
drive downcourt, where he was promptly hacked in mid
air by the Bruins' J.R. Henderson.
Henderson was whistled for an intentional foul, giving
the Cardinal two free throws and the ball. Knight made
one of two from the line, center Tim Young sank a 5-foot
er, and suddenly it was 6-0, Stanford.
But the snowball was just beginning to pick up steam.
Jelani McCoy's free throw with 18 minutes, 51 seconds
remaining in the half put UCLA on the scoreboard, but
two more Knight three-pointers sandwiched around a
Kris Weems 18-footer made it 14-1, sending Cardinal
fans into a frenzy. When senior forward Rich Jackson
buried another three-pointer to put Stanford ahead 17-1,
it appeared as though Stanford could do no wrong.
"We obviously played extremely well," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery. "Everything that we tried
