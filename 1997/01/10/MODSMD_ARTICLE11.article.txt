# Airliner downed in snowstorm
## All 29 passengers die in commuter crash outside Detroit 
### 
MONROE, Mich. (AP) - A
commuter plane trying to land in
a snowstorm nose dived into a
field 18 miles short of the Detroit
airport yesterday, killing all 29
people aboard.
The twin-engine Embraer 120,
operated by Cincinnati-based
Comair, went down just before
dusk in a huge fireball, splinter
ing into small pieces and leaving
a black patch in the snow, which
was about 4 inches deep by
evening.
Cathy Conner, 14, said she
was getting off the school bus
when she saw the plane go
"straight into the ground."
"It was just like a blur; it was
going so fast. Then I saw the
explosion, and flames just went
everywhere," she said.
Comair said 26 passengers and
three crew members were
aboard. Sheriff Tilman Crutch
field said there were no sur
vivors.
The pilot of Flight 3272,
which originated in Cincinnati,
gave no indication of any trouble
as the plane prepared to land at
Detroit Metropolitan Airport,
the Federal Aviation Administra
tion said. The NTSB sent a team

to investigate the cause of the
accident.
Fire and rescue vehicles con
verged on the charred wreckage
of the 30-seat plane, which went
down near a farmhouse and a
country road. As darkness fell,
rescue workers walked through
the field with flashlights, looking
for wreckage and bodies.
At the Detroit airport, friends
and relatives of the passengers
were taken to a spot where coun
selors were available.
Yesterday's accident was the
second fatal crash in the com
muter airline's 20-year history. A
twin-engine Piper Navajo
crashed at an airport in Ken
tucky in 1979 after an engine
failed on takeoff. Eight people
were killed.
The Embraer 120 is a Brazil
ian-built turboprop. More than
300 of the planes are in use, most
in North America, where they are
popular with regional and com
muter airlines. There have been
three fatal U.S. crashes involving
the Embraer 120 since 1991.
Comair obtained the plane in
1992, and it had its last major
maintenance check on Nov. 20,
said Charles Curran, Comair

senior vice president. "It did not
have any maintenance irregulari
ties," he said.
Comair serves Florida and the
Midwest, offering connections to
Delta Air Lines flights as part of a
group of small carriers that col
lectively are known as the Delta
Connection. Delta owns about 20
percent of Comair.
In 1991, an Embraer 120 oper
ated by Atlantic Southeast Air
lines went down in Georgia after
a worn part failed in a propeller
control system on the left engine.
All 23 people aboard were killed,
including former Sen. John
Tower.
Later that year, another
Embraer 120, a Continental
Express flight, nose-dived into a
field near Houston, killing all 14
aboard. Regulators blamed the
crash on missing screws in the
tail's horizontal stabilizer bar.
In 1995, a propeller blade
broke off the left engine on a
Southeast Airlines flight, forcing
the plane down in a hay field in
Georgia. Ten people were killed.
Investigators blamed a manufac
turer for failing to discover the
propeller crack that led to the
crash.
