Wilson unveils welfare reform
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Gov. Pete Wilson proposed a budget
yesterday that would take welfare reform further than the federal gov
ernment or any other state by halting payments to new recipients
after a year.
"There is more dignity in any legal job than there is on welfare," the
Republican governor said as he unveiled his $66.6 billion budget pro
posal.
In addition to limiting new applicants to 12 months of Aid to Fam
ilies with Dependent Children, his budget would limit current recipi
ents to 24 months of benefits in any 36-month period.
"We must end a welfare system that undermines the work ethic,
that has trapped generations in dependency, that drives fathers out of
homes and encourages out-of-wedlock births," Wilson said.

Grapes may prevent cancer
WASHINGTON (AP) — "To a long life" may be more than just a
toast. First researchers found that red wine helps keep the heart
ticking. Now studies show that a substance in grapes may prevent
cancer.
The finding doesn't mean eternal health is in the bottom of a wine
bottle, but the study does show that a diet loaded with fruits and veg
etables is a good defense against cancer.
Researchers working with cell cultures and laboratory animals
have found that a substance in grapes called resveratrol can help
keep cells from turning cancerous and inhibit the spread of cells that
already are malignant.
The group conducted hundreds of tests looking for anti-cancer
compounds in foods. The grape, they found, was the best.

Japanese university develops Robo-roaches
TOKYO (AP) — A big brown cockroach crawls across the table in the
laboratory of Japan's most prestigious university. The researcher eyes
it nervously, but he doesn't go for the bug spray. He grabs the remote.
This is no ordinary under-the-refrigerator-type bug. This roach has
been surgically implanted with a micro-robotic backpack that allows
researchers to control its movements. This is Robo-roach.
"Insects can do many things that people can't," said Asst. Prof. Isao
Shimoyama, head of the bio-robot research team at Tokyo University.
Within a few years, Shimoyama says, electronically controlled
insects carrying mini-cameras or other sensory devices could be used
for a variety of sensitive missions — like crawling through earthquake
rubble to search for victims or slipping under doors on espionage
surveillance.
