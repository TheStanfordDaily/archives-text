Events in Serbia prove
that student activism is
still a powerful force

During last fall's
election, just 25 years after
the passage of the 26th
Amendment, the nation's youth
vote participation was appallingly
low. Even Stanford students,
armed with social and political
activist organizations, produced
depressing numbers.
Some attribute this decrease to
political apathy or a loss of faith in
the system. But don't discount stu
dent political potential just yet.
You need only turn to Europe to
see the new poster-children of
activism.
Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic plunged his country into
protracted political turmoil when
he annulled local elections that
would have handed power to a
coalition of opposition parties in 14
of Serbia's 19 largest cities.
Shortly afterward, protests
began in Nis and later swept across
the republic. The gatherings, ral
lies and marches are now taking
place in 30 different cities and
towns.
What's especially exciting about
the nearly two months of protest is
the core of the organizing force:
the students. In the middle of this
electoral stalemate, students are
protesting the lack of democracy in
Serbian society. They claim to take
neither side but wish only to hold
their country to democratic princi
ples.
Their central principles, which
have been endorsed and blessed by
the Serbian Orthodox Church,
include the recognition of basic
democratic ideas such as a free
press, a government responsible to
the people, justice and, perhaps
most importantly, peace.
Since Nov. 22, students have
organized protests of up to 250,000
people that have riveted the
world's attention. Throughout

these protests, peaceful rallying is
the norm, perhaps because the
young are tired of seeing their
nation ravaged by hate and vio
lence. Luckily, few have been seri
ously injured.
These students are fighting
against an autocratic regime led by
a former Communist leader who
came to power on the heels of a
nationalist agenda. Milosevic is the
man many see as largely responsi
ble for instigating the Bosnian con
flict that lasted four years and re
introduced the world to ethnic
cleansing.
In fact, students rallied against
Milosevic five years ago, and the
president conceded to their
demands. So now they have risen
again. And it seems to be work
ing.
Just Wednesday, Milosevic made
more concessions to the students,
agreeing to recognize the opposi
tion's electoral victory in Nis. Yet,
the students continued to press for
the recognition of all 14 of the
municipal elections won by opposi
tion parties. Nearly 20,000 stu
dents rallied against Milosevic in
Belgrade, and by late Wednesday
afternoon, others joined as the
number surged to 50,000, despite a
presidential order barring protest
marches.
Serbian students have relied on
the Internet to communicate with
each other and to disseminate infor
mation. Since the government con
trols most of the media, and the stu
dents are unable to trust their own
newspapers and television stations,
they have turned to the World Wide
Web. Follow the students' progress

Student activism is far from
dead. The students of Serbia, fight
ing for democracy in a non-violent
fashion, are an inspiration to youth
all over the world. Their struggle
reminds us how precious the basic
freedoms that Americans take for
granted are and how effective stu
dent organization can be a crucial
force in the transformation of
national politics.
