## 'Twas the night before . . . 
### 
jmWAS THE NIGHT before
Christmas, when all through the
.X. Farm
Not a noise could be heard, except frosh car
alarms;
The finals were graded by TAs with care,
In hopes that professorships soon would be
there;
The faculty nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of tenure tracks danced in
their heads;
And I in my car, and you in your plane,
Had gone home, since Finals Week drives
us insane,
When out on the Oval there rose such a
clatter,
Six police cars pulled up to see what was the
matter.
Around and around the cops ran in a
flash,
Chasing vandals from Cal, or some kids
smoking hash? \
They ran on the breast of the just
watered lawn
And one tripped and fell down, right on his
baton,
When, what to their wondering eyes
should arrive,
But a Marguerite packed with eight people
inside,
And a little old driver, so lively and
quick,
They knew in a moment it must be St.
Nick.
More rapid than eagles the passengers
came;
St. Nick whistled and shouted and called
them by name:

"Now, Casperl now, Marc Lee\ now
Condi\ and Heather Dunn\
On, Raoul\ on, Ramonl, on, Roger and
Shovenl
To the top of the Oval! Until Lasuen
Mall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away
all!"
As Weenies that before the wild Cardi
nal fly,
When they meet with a linebacker, topple
and cry,
So into their offices the officials they
flew,
Even though it was Christmas, they had
work to do.
The police heard the patter of feet on the
tile,
But shook their heads slowly — they were
still in denial.
While they scratched their heads and
then turned around, W ■ «■ » -
Through the window St. Nicholas came
with a bound,
Or a wiggle, a scoot, a slide and a shimmy
(Due to asbestos he avoided the chimney).
He was dressed all in red, from his head
to his foot,
With a giant white "S" sewn onto his suit;
A shiny brass keychain was under his
thumb:
St. Nick is a card-bearing Stanford alum.
His eyes — how they twinkled! His dim
ples how perky!
A man this impressive could not come from
Berkeley!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like
a bow,

And his just-polished teeth were as white as
the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held down at his
side
(This is Palo Alto — you can't smoke
inside).
He had a broad face and a nose like a
knob,
You'd laugh if you saw him, then ask for a
job.
He spoke not a word but went straight
to his work,
And filled all his stockings then turned
with a jerk,
I'd speak of his belly, but St. Nick was
lean:
You try Iff get fat on California cuisine!
And laying his finger aaideof his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose,
But down he returned — there was an
obstruction:
The chimney was blocked because of con
struction.
He sprang to his shuttle, to lighten his
load,
But he'd parked incorrectly so it had been
towed.
Still I heard him exclaim, ere he drove
out of sight,
"Happy Christmas to all and to all a good
night."

James Silver wishes you a safe and sane
winter quarter.
