Bookstore will no longer put holds on student registration

YOU RECENTLTY PRINTED a
letter from Karin Wahl-Jor
gensen (Wednesday's Letters)
concerning the hold placed on her
records in the Registrar's Office by the
Stanford Bookstore.
The letter raises the issue of the rela

tionship an independent entity that
operates on this campus, such as the
Bookstore, has with the Registrar's
Office.
While on-campus businesses such as
the Bookstore and the related Tresidder
Express provide necessary and conve

nient services to Stanford students, I
agree that it is not appropriate for orga
nizations that are not regular depart
ments or offices of Stanford University
to be able to place holds on students'
records.
Effective immediately, the Book

store, including Tresidder Express, will
no longer be able to place holds on stu
dents' records in the Registrar's Office.
Holds that are currently on students'
records will be lifted.
