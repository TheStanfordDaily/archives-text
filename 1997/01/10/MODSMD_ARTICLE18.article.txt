# Shen and Thompson defend crusade against U.S. News rankings
## 
### 
In response to Alissa Fitzgerald's
letter concerning our U.S. News cam
paign, we must first share the good
news that no ASSU funds were spent
on ASSU Vice President Nick Thomp
son's excursion to Washington, D.C., to
talk to the editors of U.S. News. All of
our funds were spent on notepads this
September.
Secondly, the campaign is much
deeper than she sees. We started work
ing on it because, beyond the obvious

philosophical absurdity of giving some
thing as complex as a college experi
ence a numerical ranking, we believe
that educational priorities are being
distorted by the U.S. News rankings
and that the rankings are emblematic
of a destructive put-everything-in-a
little-box mentality. Students at nearly
100 other schools around the country
are working with us both for these
reasons and for the myriad of other
reasons that are bound to come up
with something as obviously and uni
versally disagreeable as the U.S. News
rankings.
We do however agree with Fitzger
ald's point that Stanford isn't served by
applicants who take the rankings seri
ously. Unfortunately, people do care and

that's why one of our goals is to discred
it U.S. News.
