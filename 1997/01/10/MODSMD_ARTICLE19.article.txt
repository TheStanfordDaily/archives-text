# Students should be allowed to pay tuition bills with credit cards
## 
### 
Regarding your editorial against pay
ing the University bill with credit cards
(Monday's Daily), how does $600,000
equal a tuition increase of $400 per stu
dent? I'd like to see University Bursar
Jon Erickson's calculations. Has he com

pared the costs to the costs of check pro
cessing?
In my opinion, the option to pay Uni
versity tuition bills by credit card would
help all students. Even if you cannot pay
the full cost of tuition with a single card,
you could use multiple cards or some
other combination of payment options.
Using the editorial's example of fre
quent flyer miles — everyone can use
them. Many non-wealthy students need
to fly as well.
And the lines at the beginning of
each quarter are not to pay off the Uni
versity bill. They are for picking up loan
checks. Do any of you actually go to
Stanford?
