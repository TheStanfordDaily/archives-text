Two Stanford professors recently
returned from a trip to Washington
to accept national awards, and a
third is packing his bags to go there.
Asst. Physics Prof. Charles Mar
cus and Asst. Dermatology Prof.
Paul Khavari were named winners
of the first annual Presidential
Early Career Awards for Scientists
and Engineers. Molecular and Cel
lular Physiology Prof. Richard
Scheller is one of the recipients of
the 1997 National Academy of Sci
ences' Award in Molecular Biology,
which is awarded for remarkable
discoveries by young scientists.
The Presidential Early Career
Awards were given to 60 young re
searchers throughout the United
States who show outstanding

promise and achievement in their
respective fields. Recipients receive
research grants of up to $500,000
over five years.
Marcus' research includes semi
conductor devices and how they re
late to chaos.
"As things start getting bigger,
they start possessing variety, disor
der, which leads to unpredictability.
Basically, we measure randomness
and chaos from the perfect world of
quantum mechanics," Marcus said.
"There are a huge number of new
research questions as to how quan
tum mechanics operates in large
systems," he said. "I want to know
the answers to these questions."
Khavari's research takes on a dif
ferent side of science.
"We (his research team) are in
