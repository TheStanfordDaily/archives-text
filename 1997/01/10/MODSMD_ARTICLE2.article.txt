# Three University researchers win national awards

Two Stanford professors recently
returned from a trip to Washington
to accept national awards, and a
third is packing his bags to go there.
Asst. Physics Prof. Charles Mar
cus and Asst. Dermatology Prof.
Paul Khavari were named winners
of the first annual Presidential
Early Career Awards for Scientists
and Engineers. Molecular and Cel
lular Physiology Prof. Richard
Scheller is one of the recipients of
the 1997 National Academy of Sci
ences' Award in Molecular Biology,
which is awarded for remarkable
discoveries by young scientists.
The Presidential Early Career
Awards were given to 60 young re
searchers throughout the United
States who show outstanding

promise and achievement in their
respective fields. Recipients receive
research grants of up to $500,000
over five years.
Marcus' research includes semi
conductor devices and how they re
late to chaos.
"As things start getting bigger,
they start possessing variety, disor
der, which leads to unpredictability.
Basically, we measure randomness
and chaos from the perfect world of
quantum mechanics," Marcus said.
"There are a huge number of new
research questions as to how quan
tum mechanics operates in large
systems," he said. "I want to know
the answers to these questions."
Khavari's research takes on a dif
ferent side of science.
"We (his research team) are in
teres ted in programs of gene expres
sion in the skin. Our long-term goal
is to understand the basic epithelial
biology, as well as to develop ap
proaches to gene therapy to the
skin," Khavari said. "The majority
of biological questions today can be
addressed in the skin."
Aside from his research obliga
tions at Stanford, Khavari is also a
physician and serves as the chief of
dermatology at the Palo Alto Veter
ans Affairs Hospital.
Stanford alumni, Khavari and
Marcus not only share a passion for
science, but both lived in Stern Hall
their freshman year.
"Neither one of us was aware that
the other had gotten the award until
we ran into each other in Washing
ton, D.C. It was quite hilarious,"
Khavari said. "I think one thing that
sets people apart even from the be
ginning is a real love of acquiring
knowledge and investigation. Char
lie was one of those people."

"Charlie" saw himself a bit differ
ently.
"I think what IKhavari] sensed
back then was fear," Marcus said. "I
came from a relatively small high
school not known for academics, and
when I got here I was scared and in
timidated."
Scheller's research is in neuro
science.
"We have characterized the pro
teins in the nerve terminals that are
responsible for the release of neuro
transmitters," Scheller said. "For
the first six years [his research] was
not recognized as being important,
although we believed it was."
Scheller said he and co-recipient
Thomas Sudhof of the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Cen
ter, laughed at part of the stated
reason for their receiving the
award: "for recent notable discover
ies in molecular biology for young
scientists."
"We wondered when they would
stop considering us young," the 43-
year-old said.
He will receive the award, which
comes with a $ 10,000 prize, in Wash
ington, D.C., on April 28.
