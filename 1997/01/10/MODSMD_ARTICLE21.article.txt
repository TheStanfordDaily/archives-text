## Women hoopsters go to L.A. 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
Coming off two impressive victories at home
over the Arizona schools, the third-ranked Stan
ford women's basketball team (14-1,2-0 Pacific 10
Conference) takes to the road for the first time in
Pac-10 play as it invades Southern California for a
Friday night game at UCLA (7-4,1-1) and a match
Sunday against the USC Trojans (8-3, 2-0).
If these games are anywhere near the level of
last year's contests, they should provide some
offensive fireworks and close matchups. Last year
against the Trojans, then-junior forward Kate
Starbird averaged 36.5 points in the two contests,
including a school-record 44 points in an 88-67
rout in Maples Pavilion last Jan. 13.
Meanwhile, the Bruins seriously threatened
the Cardinal's then-34-game home winning streak
by shooting a sizzling 58 percent from the field.
Stanford eventually rallied from a nine-point half
time deficit to win 81-77. In the rematch in L.A. a
month later, the Bruins lost by a basket, 61-59.
However, associate head coach Amy Tucker
sees potential differences this season. "Last year's
[Bruin] team had a little more experience on the
perimeter and two seniors inside," Tucker said.
"This year's UCLA team is extremely young. They
rely on five freshmen extensively ... it's just a
much different team."
Perhaps the most compelling difference for the
Bruins came before the season when one of the
conference's top guards, sophomore Erica Gomez,
suffered a serious knee injury that will sideline her
for the season. "She's really the heart and soul of
that team in terms of just running the squad on
the floor," Tucker said.
Nevertheless, UCLA has gotten off to a
respectable 7-4 start that included a 73-61 win
over then-ninth-ranked Western Kentucky in the
Pac-10 / Sun Belt Challenge late last month. They
opened conference play in Washington as they
stopped Washington State 77-73, but dropped a
98-75 decision to Washington.
Much-hyped freshman forward Maylana Mar
tin has delivered, averaging 18.5 points and 6.5
rebounds. Junior guard Tawana Grimes is a dead
eye free-throw shooter, leading the conference
with an .853 percentage while serving as the start
ing point guard after playing small forward the
past two years. The 6-foot-4 freshman center
Janae Hubbard has contributed two double-dou-
bles off the bench as well. However,
even though the team's rebounding
is better than last season, it still
ranks in the latter half of the con
ference, while the players are care
less with the ball, averaging 24
turnovers a game.
The Lady Trojans boast player
of-the-year candidate Tina Thomp
son. The senior forward is seventh
all-time on the Pac-10 scoring list
while also the nation's fifth-leading
scorer this season, averaging more
than 23 points per game.
"We can match up with [junior
forward] Olympia [Scott]," Tucker

said. "She's pretty much the same
size and maybe even a little quicker.
It's just a matter of hoping Olympia
plays smart and stays out of foul
trouble."
Thompson's team opened league
play in an impressive fashion last
weekend, sweeping the Washington
schools for the first time since the
1992-93 season.
The rest of the Bruins' front line
features the most depth south of
Stanford, led by sophomore for
ward Jodi Parriot.
It would appear that the Cardi
nal is clicking on all cylinders now;
the team is among the conference
leaders in scoring field goal percent
age, assists average and rebound
ing, while also beating opponents
by an average of 22.6 points.
