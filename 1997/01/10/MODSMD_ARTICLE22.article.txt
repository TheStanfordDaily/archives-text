# Knight sets tone early on in game

### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
Following last night's loss at
Maples Pavilion, UCLA head coach
Steve Lavin said he had told his
players that "if you are in sports
long enough, there are sometimes
going to be nights like this."
What the first-year coach
apparently overlooked is that Stan
ford has a Knight like this — a fact
which he became painfully aware
of by the first television timeout
last night.
Brevin Knight, who in his last
game against Arizona missed a
clutch free throw that might have
iced the game, seemed bent on
redeeming himself last night, as he
came out red-hot against the Bru
ins, outscoring UCLA 11-1 in the
First 5 minutes of the game by him
self.
"We said that we wanted to for
get about [the Arizona loss], but I
know for me it was still there,"
Knight said. "We had a great
chance to win that game and we
squandered it. We had to come
back tonight and win."
Stanford quickly followed
Knight's lead, too, as the Card
went on First half runs of 17-1 and
16-3 to jump out to a 31-point half
time lead at 57-26. It is important
to put that lead in perspective
because LTCLA's previous worst
loss ever was a 38-point loss to Ari
zona in 1989. Stanford almost took
care of that margin by halftime.
"Obviously, Brevin set the tone

coming out — hitting the First
three," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "When Brevin
is shooting the ball, it makes it
awfully difFicult because you have
to back off and give him space to
keep him from getting in the inte
rior. And when he starts jumping
up and hitting threes, that's a pret
ty good sign that we are in pretty
good shape."
Knight, who Finished the First
half with 20 points on eight-of-11
shooting (six-of-seven on three
point attempts), said he was simply
doing what needed to be done.
"We needed a win and to be
dominant at home, and I knew
that I had to be the guy to make
everyone comfortable out there,
whether it meant scoring or throw
ing assists," said Knight, who also
added six assists, Five rebounds
and two steals in the first half.
"Tonight it was scoring, another
night it might be different."
What makes Knight's 25-point
performance slightly different
from many of his other spectacular
nights at Stanford was the fact
that he took over early in the
game, rather than waiting to make
his move in the second half.
"I was feeling good, but I didn't
want to press," Knight said. "Usu
ally I sit back and wait until later
on, but tonight I went out and took
charge a little bit earlier and we
played well.'"
And it was the early lead that
