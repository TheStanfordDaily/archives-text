# Swimming hosts Michigan this weekend
## Men face talented Wolverines 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
In what may be one of the
biggest dual meets in collegiate
swimming this year, the top
ranked Stanford men's swim
team will set up against fourth
ranked Michigan at deGuerre
Pool today at 1 p.m.
The meet is the Cardinal's
first since the winter break and
will be highlighted by individual
matchups. Michigan and Stan
ford will put up some of the
fastest swimmers in the country
in their individual events, and the
head-to-head racing promises to
be exciting.
While the Michigan team no
longer has Olympic gold medalist
Tom Dolan among its ranks, the
Wolverines still bring to the
waters of deGuerre U.S.
Olympians John Piersma and
Tom Malchow, along with Cana
dian Olympian Owen Von
Richter and Turkish Olympian
Derya Buvukuncu. Michigan's
star-studded roster will meet a
very talented and deep Stanford
team in what will likely be one of
the fastest dual meets of this
year.
The No. 1 and No. 4 rankings
for Stanford and Michigan,
respectively, come from the latest
coaches poll. However, Swim
ming World magazine recently
ranked Michigan first and Stan
ford third. While the real answer
to the question "Who is really No.
1?" won't be decided until March
at the NCAA Championships,
today's meet features the only
two teams in the country who can
both claim that thev are the best
of the NCAA.
The first event of the meet will
be the 400 medley relay, in which
Stanford has traditionally had
the edge over Michigan. Stanford
backstrckers Dan Schultz and
Tate Blahnik, both sophomores,
will square off against Michigan's
Olympian Buyukuncu in the
leadoft leg of the medley.

Sophomore Tom Wilkens takes a breath in a meet against USC last season. Today the Cardinal men
host Michigan at deGuerre Pool.
With Stanford's depth in the
rest of the strokes at 100-yard dis
tances, the medley relay is an event
in which Stanford could take the
top two spots. The large point
swing that a one-two relay finish
could provide would help set a pos
itive tone on the Stanford side of
the pool for the rest of the meet.
However, the next of the big
matchups of the meet will come in
the following event, the 1,000
freestyle. In this distance race,
Stanford senior Kevin Radvany

and sophomore Matt O'Mara will
face Michigan's distance swim
mers, including sophomore Andy
Potts. Stanford's Radvany and
Michigan's Potts both hail from
New Jersey, where they trained
together on the same club team in
high school. These two will likely
do battle in the 500 freestyle as
well, and their experience racing
each other over the years should
make for some exciting swims.
The next event, the 200
freestyle, will feature Stanford
senior Scott Jones and sophomore
Dod Wales, who will face Wolverine
swimmers Chris Rumley and John
Piersma, both seniors. Piersma
swam for the U.S. Olympic team in

Atlanta last summer and will push
Stanford's 200 swimmers. Jones
and Wales will have to make up for
the absence of teammate Justin
Ewers, who is out with a sickness
related injury.
In the 200 butterfly, Stanford
sophomore Matt Pierce remains
unbeaten this season. However, he
will face perhaps his toughest com
petition yet in Michigan's Olympic
silver medalist Malchow.
Both Michigan and Stanford are
coming off intense winter training
sessions. While Stanford came
back early to campus to train in
deGuerre, Michigan traveled to
Perth, Australia for the holidays.
Typically, winter training leaves

swimmers feeling a bit tired and
rundown in early January. Howev
er, you can be sure that the
extremely competitive environ
ment will produce some fast swim
ming, despite it being the "slow"
time of the season.
"Due to the fact that we've come
off of hard training, this meet is
going to be mental — stepping up
and swimming fast even when
tired," said junior Chris Olson.
"I'm just excited to go out
there and compete," Pierce said.
"We will have the chance to
prove ourselves both as individu
als and as a team. That's what
we train for, and that's what we
want to do today."
