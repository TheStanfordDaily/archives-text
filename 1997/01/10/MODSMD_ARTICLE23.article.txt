# Swimming hosts Michigan this weekend
## Men face talented Wolverines 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
In what may be one of the
biggest dual meets in collegiate
swimming this year, the top
ranked Stanford men's swim
team will set up against fourth
ranked Michigan at deGuerre
Pool today at 1 p.m.
The meet is the Cardinal's
first since the winter break and
will be highlighted by individual
matchups. Michigan and Stan
ford will put up some of the
fastest swimmers in the country
in their individual events, and the
head-to-head racing promises to
be exciting.
While the Michigan team no
longer has Olympic gold medalist
Tom Dolan among its ranks, the
Wolverines still bring to the
waters of deGuerre U.S.
Olympians John Piersma and
Tom Malchow, along with Cana
dian Olympian Owen Von
Richter and Turkish Olympian
Derya Buvukuncu. Michigan's
star-studded roster will meet a
very talented and deep Stanford
team in what will likely be one of
the fastest dual meets of this
year.
The No. 1 and No. 4 rankings
for Stanford and Michigan,
respectively, come from the latest
coaches poll. However, Swim
ming World magazine recently
ranked Michigan first and Stan
ford third. While the real answer
to the question "Who is really No.
1?" won't be decided until March
at the NCAA Championships,
today's meet features the only
two teams in the country who can
both claim that thev are the best
of the NCAA.
The first event of the meet will
be the 400 medley relay, in which
Stanford has traditionally had
the edge over Michigan. Stanford
backstrckers Dan Schultz and
Tate Blahnik, both sophomores,
will square off against Michigan's
Olympian Buyukuncu in the
leadoft leg of the medley.
