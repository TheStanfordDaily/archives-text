# New and old talent define women's swim team
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
This weekend will mark the first
big sports weekend on the Farm
this year, and while the Cardinal
men's and women's hoops teams
will be stealing the national spot
light, on Saturday the best Cardi
nal team will be in the pool, not on
the hardwood.
Coming off its fifth-straight
national championship last spring
and an impressive performance at
the Auburn Invitational a month
ago, the top-ranked women's swim
ming and diving team (2-0 in dual
meets) will open its regular season
home schedule tomorrow against
No. 5 Michigan (4-0) at deGuerre
Pool at 1 p.m.
The Cardinal, which returns 16
swimmers from last year's champi
onship team, will be led by senior
captains Michelle Jesperson and

Sarah Anderson and senior Claudia
Franco, who swam for Spain in the
Atlanta Games.
"I don't think there is a team
ever that succeeds without leader
ship from within," said head coach
Richard Quick, who enters his
ninth season with the Cardinal.
"Particularly if you have a strong
senior class, it makes a huge differ
ence."
In addition to these seniors,
Quick brings in a freshman class
that is nothing short of a dream
team. At the head of the much-her
alded freshman class is two-time
Olympic gold medalist Catherine
Fox, who has already posted
NCAA-best times in three events
(the 100-meter freestyle, the 100
back and the 200 butterfly).
Rounding out the freshmen
"Fab Five" are Olympians Jessica
Amey (Canada), who swims the
sprint free and the 100 fly, and

Gabrielle Rose (Brazil), who swims
the 200 free, the 100 fly and the 200
individual medley; Courtney Lis
chke and Jessica Tucker-Mohl have
also made significant contributions
in the middle-distance freestyle
events.
Quick has already noticed that
his freshmen are an asset both in
and out of the pool. "We have excel
lent team chemistry. We have a
wonderful freshman class that is
complimenting the rest of our team
very well."
The Cardinal shouldn't overlook
Michigan, however. The Wolver
ines, who won their lOth-straight
Big 10 Conference championship
and took third at the NCAA Cham
pionships last year, return four All-
American freestylers in Talor Ben
del, Jen Fberwein, Kim Johnson
and Melisa Stone, as well as All-
