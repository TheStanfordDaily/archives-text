## Cardinal gymnasts greet No. 3 Georgia 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The women's gymnastics
team, which placed ninth in the
nation last year, will open the
season with a meet against No. 3
Georgia tonight. The competi
tion will be held at Burnham
Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.
Coaches and athletes on both
squads agree that starting the
year with a tough meet is the
best way to assure the smooth
kickoff of the intense season
schedules.
"It should be one of the most
exciting events of the year,"
Stanford coach Lisa Izzi said. "It
is a really great opportunity for
us to have a team like Georgia in
our gym. You always tend to rise
to the level of your competition."
Competing against such a
high-ranked team at the begin
ning of the season will help Stan

ford on its quest to join the
nation's elitist of teams, accord
ing to Izzi.
Georgia coach Suzanne Yocu
lan agreed that the Stanford
team has been showing a consis
tent high level of skill over the
last few years, penetrating into
top-12 status.
"Stanford had a great season
last year, and we are very excited
to compete with them, to see
where they are and how they
stand," she said.
The Georgia squad will find
that the Card stands high this
year; the Stanford squad fea
tures internationally competitive
individuals.
Sophomore co-captain Keri
Monahan plans to execute what
will probably be the toughest
trick seen in collegiate gymnas
tics nationwide.
