# Season opener
## Cardinal gymnasts greet No. 3 Georgia 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The women's gymnastics
team, which placed ninth in the
nation last year, will open the
season with a meet against No. 3
Georgia tonight. The competi
tion will be held at Burnham
Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.
Coaches and athletes on both
squads agree that starting the
year with a tough meet is the
best way to assure the smooth
kickoff of the intense season
schedules.
"It should be one of the most
exciting events of the year,"
Stanford coach Lisa Izzi said. "It
is a really great opportunity for
us to have a team like Georgia in
our gym. You always tend to rise
to the level of your competition."
Competing against such a
high-ranked team at the begin
ning of the season will help Stan

ford on its quest to join the
nation's elitist of teams, accord
ing to Izzi.
Georgia coach Suzanne Yocu
lan agreed that the Stanford
team has been showing a consis
tent high level of skill over the
last few years, penetrating into
top-12 status.
"Stanford had a great season
last year, and we are very excited
to compete with them, to see
where they are and how they
stand," she said.
The Georgia squad will find
that the Card stands high this
year; the Stanford squad fea
tures internationally competitive
individuals.
Sophomore co-captain Keri
Monahan plans to execute what
will probably be the toughest
trick seen in collegiate gymnas
tics nationwide.

Sophomore Amy Murakami executes a skillful flip on the bal
ance beam in an exhibition match earlier this month. Tonight,
the women's gymnastics team hosts No. 3 Georgia.
The first of her three planned
tumbling passes on the floor exer
cise is a "full-out," a level-E move
(each tumbling pass has a ranking
from A through E, with E being the
most difficult) that includes a dou
ble back flip with a full twist in the
second flip.
Another key performer on the
floor is sophomore co-captain Amy
Murakami, an Ail-American who
placed first in last year's NCAA
West Regionals in the all-around
category.
Murakami has a new routine
which shows off her "super-high"
tumbling passes and artistic skills.
"She's just a beautiful dancer, and
her routine should be really excit
ing to watch," Izzi said.
The meet will introduce the

three freshmen on the Cardinal
team into collegiate gymnastics.
Annie Thananopavarn is expect
ed to put on a powerful perfor
mance on the vault. Tara La Morte
will also make a grand debut with a
skillful routine on the balance
beam. One of her difficult moves
includes a "Popa," a straddle jump
with a full twist in the air before
landing back on the 4-inch beam.
This is another extremely difficult
move, rarely seen in collegiate gym
nastics.
Sophomore Tracey Kohl is also
expected to score high on the beam
with her strong leaps and flowing
performance. Freshman Larissa
Fontaine will lead the squad on the
bars with sophomore Katie Fitz
patrick. Fitzpatrick is scheduled to
perform a triple combination of one
level-E and two level-D moves. The
dazzling combination is expected to
be one of the highlights of the
evening.
