# Volleyball heads south for UCSB Invitational
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
Earlier this morning the Stanford
men's volleyball team started its quest to
obtain the elusive national championship
when it began its season in the 33rd
Annual UCSB Collegiate Invitational
Tournament in Santa Barbara.
The tournament consists of two gruel
ing days of pool and elimination play,
which features 24 teams from all over the
country competing for spots in Satur
day's championship and third-place
games.
Although Stanford, which is ranked
No. 1 in many preseason polls, will not be
satisfied with anything but first place,
the Cardinal team will face tough compe
tition from the likes of reigning national
champion UCLA, perennial powerhouse
Long Beach State and UC-Santa Barbara
— the team that kept Stanford from the
Final Four last year.
All three teams belong to the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation, as does
the Cardinal.
The 24-team field has been divided
into six pools. Each team will play two of
the other teams in its respective pool,
with each match as a best of three games.
Stanford's pool includes Sacramento
State, UC-Irvine and Westmont — a
small college in Santa Barbara. The tour
nament will continue Friday night and
Saturday morning with two more rounds
of similar pool play.
The top four teams after pool play will
play in the third-place and championship
games on Saturday evening. Although
the pool matches will not count for the
team's overall record because they are
only two-out-of-three games, the third
place and championship games will, as
they use the standard three-out-of-five
format.
Although host school UC-Santa Bar
bara has seeded itself ahead of the sec
ond-seeded Cardinal, Stanford hopes to
prove that it is truly the country's top
collegiate team. The team returns all 13
players from last year's sixth-ranked
team, which finished 15-8 overall.
Added to this outstanding core of tal
ent are two newcomers and one returning

superstar. Brett Covert, a first-year law
student at Stanford, figures to con
tribute, as does incoming 6-foot-6 fresh
man outside hitter Andy Witt, the
nation's top recruit. If this group was not
formidable enough alone, Mike Lam
bert's return from his year with the
national team figures to make the Cardi
nal nearly unbeatable.
After last year's disappointing loss to
UC-Santa Barbara in the MPSF tourna
ment, the team has worked hard to pre
pare for the upcoming season.
Five weeks of rigorous fall training,
combined with an appearance in the Dino
Cup in Calgary, Canada and a three
match trip to Hawaii — where the squad
won two out of the three matches it
played against national power Hawaii —
should ensure that the team is ready to
play, both physically and mentally.
Although it may be the most talented
and well-prepared team coming into
today's tournament, victory will be any
thing but easy for the Cardinal.
The tournament will be as much a test
of physical endurance as it will be of vol
leyball acumen. Since the Cardinal will
be forced to play a minimum of six
matches, possibly as many as 18 games,
in only 1 1/2 days, all 16 players should
see action.
"It's not necessarily the best team who
wins here," assistant coach John Kosty
said. "The less you can play the starters,
the better your chances of winning. For
this reason we plan on playing a lot of dif
ferent lineups."
After the players return to the Farm,
they will have until Friday to prepare for
their season home opener against Cali
fornia. Like the tournament, the game
against Cal, a club team, will be a tuneup
for the tougher competition the team will
face later in the season. After squaring
off against the Bears, the team will trav
el to Columbus, Ohio to play in an NCAA
preview tournament.
Upon returning home from Ohio,
Stanford will have a week to conclude its
preparations for league play before begin
ning its conference schedule on the road
against UC-San Diego and San Diego
State. The Cardinal will play its confer
ence home opener against UC-Santa Bar

bara on Feb.lB.
This weekend's play, as well as the
tough competition that the team will face
in Columbus, should provide the Cardi
nal with the beginnings of an answer tc
the question of whether or not it will be
able to garner a much-anticipated nation
al championship.
