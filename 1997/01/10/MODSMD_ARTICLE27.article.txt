# Rugby goes to battle on UCLA turf
## 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
The men's and women's
rugby teams will begin the new
year tomorrow by heading down
to Southern California to take
on USC and UCLA, respectively.
Both teams were scheduled to
play against the Bruins, but the
UCLA men canceled their match
and the Cardinal men resched
uled to face the Trojans. The
men's team is ranked second in
the Pacific Coast Conference
and third in the nation.
With the long break in prac
tice due to finals and winter

vacation, both teams feel that
their skills have gotten slightly
rusty. They will use the next few
weeks of preseason to work on
refining those skills for confer
ence play, which begins in about
three weeks.
"There will be no changes
[due to the rescheduling]," said
head coach Franck Boivert.
"We're going to approach the
game the same way. It's going
to take awhile for us to get the
rest off and get back to good
habits."
The women, also ranked sec
ond in the nation, will specifical
ly work on their ball-handling

skills and their concentration in
pressure situations.
"I think the main thing after
such a long break is getting our
heads back into the game," said
women's captain Megan Himan.
"We have to bring up the inten
sity level of the team and start
working on gelling together as a
unit.
"We still get nervous under
pressure," Himan added. "We're
a fairly young team and so we
need to really improve our con
centration under pressure and
not drop the ball and calm down
when things get rough on the
field," Himan said.
