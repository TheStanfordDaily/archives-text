# Hospital board named
## 17 will advise newly merged facilities 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
Members of the Board of Direc
tors of UCSF-Stanford Health
Care were named earlier this
week, moving the merger between
Stanford and UCSF hospitals into
its final stages.
The merger, which was ap
proved by the UC Board of Re
gents and the Stanford Board of
Trustees on Nov. 15 and is
planned to take effect July 1, will
unite the clinical resources and fa
cilities of both institutions but
leave the medical schools sepa
rate.
The 15 members who have
been selected include three repre
sentatives each from the UC
Board of Regents and the Stanford

Board of Trustees, three faculty
representatives each from the
University of California and Stan
ford, and three independent direc
tors.
A chief executive officer and a
chief medical officer will complete
the 17-member board. A CEO will
be chosen by the current board
members within the next few
weeks, according to Director of
University Communications
Terry Shepard. The CEO will then
work with the deans of Stanford
and UCSF medical schools to se
lect a chief medical officer.
The CEO and chief medical of
ficer will then select the manage
ment below them, and "hiring will
proceed in layers, down to the en
tire work force," Shepard said.
Merging the privately funded
SHS with publicly funded UCSF
caused opposition from unions at
UCSF, which fear that the merger
will cause layoffs and drive down
wages and benefits for UCSF's
8,000 union employees.
The state's Public Relations
Employee Board filed a complaint
in September, charging that
UCSF had failed to bargain with
the union. Both SHS and the UC
regents have committed to try to
re-employ 95 percent of affected
employees.
The final obstacles remaining
in the merger are "regulatory
things," according to Shepard.
USHC must obtain an IRS rul
ing distinguishing itself as a non
profit organization, transfer vari
ous hospital licenses and be cleared
through both federal and state
anti-trust laws, which are designed
to prevent monopoly control.
USHC will control an estimated 12
percent to 13 percent of the health
care market in the Bay Area.
Although USHC is a private in
stitution, it is still under the con

trol of the UC Board of Regents
and the Stanford Board of
Trustees, Shepard stressed.
"Either side can dissolve the
merger if they feel that the goals
are not being met," Shepard said.
Faculty members from Stan
ford on the board include Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper,
Medical School Dean Eugene
Bauer and Medical Department
Chair Judith Swain. Faculty from
UCSF are Chancellor Joseph Mar
tin, UC Medical School Dean Haile
Debas and Medical Department
Chair Lee Goldman.
Stanford trustees include
Woodrow Myers Jr., Denise
O'Leary and Isaac Stein. UC Re
gents are UC President Richard
Atkinson, Board of Regents Chair
Tirso del Junco and Howard
Leach.
The independent directors
were selected by a separate com
mittee chosen by both Stanford
and UCSF. They are Richard
Behrman, managing director of
the Center for the Future of Chil
dren of the David and Lucile
Packard Foundation; F. Warren
Hellman, general partner in the
investment firm Hellman & Fried
man; and Richard Rosenberg, re
tired chairman and CEO of
BankAmerica Corp.
