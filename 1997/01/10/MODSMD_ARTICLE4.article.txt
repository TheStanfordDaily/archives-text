### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Dean of Re
search Charles
Kruger voiced his
support for the
new Stanford
Graduate Fellow
ship Program dur
ing yesterday's
Faculty Senate
meeting, saying it
is a "very strong

message on the part of the institu
tion in support of graduate educa
tion in uncertain times."
The program, announced last
May by University President Ger
hard Casper, will offer 100 three
year doctoral fellowships each year
beginning in the 1997-98 school
year. The fellowships will provide
graduate students with a tuition
voucher for $ 12,000 and a stipend of
$16,000 annually.
Kruger said the program offers
several attractions for doctoral stu
dents because its funds can be trans
ported from department to depart
ment and because it is open to for
eign students.
As part of the program's empha
sis on attracting excellent students,
the fellowships will be offered first
to entering doctoral students and
then to students already enrolled in
Stanford's program.
Kruger also said the program is
concentrated on those fields with
significant dependence on federal
funds, especially the sciences, engi
neering and social sciences.
"We would like to reduce major
dependence on federal research as

sistance," he said.
However, Kruger said the pro
gram is not designed explicitly to
solve the problem of graduate tu
ition remission, or cutbacks in fed
eral funding of graduate education
over the last five years.
In other senate business, Direc
tor of Overseas Studies Russell
Berman gave a report on the status
of Stanford's Overseas Studies Pro
gram.
"In the past year, we have seen a
significant increase in undergradu
ate interest in the program," he
said.
Berman said the program has ex
panded the type of students it serves
from almost exclusively attracting a
small set of humanities majors to at
tracting majors in human biology,
biology and engineering.
"We are doing constant thinking
about the interlock between the
home campus and the overseas cam
pus," he said.
In response to a question from
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Ramon Saldivar on this in
teraction, Berman said Overseas
Studies is working closely with lan
guage departments to better
smooth integration between Stan
ford and overseas campuses.
Berman also said that Over
seas Studies is exploring the pos
sibility of adding campuses over
seas, including sites in Mexico and
China.
The senate also approved a rec
ommendation from the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies to imple
ment an individually designed
major program in the School of
Earth Sciences.
