# Carson to compile MLK autobiography
## History prof described as the 'foremost expert' 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
The monumental task of com
piling Martin Luther King Jr.'s
life into a single autobiography
has been entrusted to the care of
Stanford History Prof. Clay
borne Carson.
In cooperation with Time
Warner Inc., the King estate will
also publish King's complete
written works, which have not
previously been available to the
public
Carson acts as the senior edi
tor and director of the King Pa
pers Project, a University-fund
ed research center housed in Cy
press Hall. Project researchers
are working to compile an un
precedented, annotated 14-vol
ume edition of King's previously
unavailable manuscripts to add
to the thousands of scholarly,
journalistic and biographical
works already published about
him.
To Carson's surprise, in 1985
Coretta Scott King, the wife of
the late civil rights leader, called
and asked him to serve as the di
rector of the Papers Project.
Since then, Carson and his group
have meticulously completed
three volumes.
Carson's other project, the au
tobiography of King, will also be
published in partnership with
Time Warner and the King es
tate. By piecing together King's
words from speeches and ser
mons and private correspon
dences, the memoir will be com
pletely in his own words.
"The trick is to find just the
right material by searching
through the hundreds of thou
sands of documents we have on

Philip Jones, chairman and CEO
of Intellectual Properties Manage
ment, which manages the entire
King estate, described Carson as
the foremost expert on King's life.
Even as a highly respected histo
rian, Carson is not immune to the
challenges of his undertaking. "I
have been studying the civil rights
movement my entire career," he
said. "But there is a lot of pressure
to meet the deadline."
The autobiography project was
announced Tuesday and has al
ready been under attack. Critics
have suggested that the joint ven
ture is inspired more by capitalist
ambitions than by a dedication to
King's beliefs and struggles.
Carson defended the partner
ship with Time Warner, a commer

cial publisher rather than a small
academic press, as being one which
will offer access to innumerable
otherwise unattainable resources.
"It could be either a great result
or a product of exploitation," Car
son said. "I will do the job with in
tegrity .. . and then we can deter
mine the quality by the products
which result."
Jones added it is not an unprece
dented conglomeration. For in
stance, many of the rights to King's
speeches were originally owned by
Motown and later bought by Poly
gram, he explained. The true prece

body of King's works is now con
trolled by a single publisher.
The goal is to provide an invalu
able, indelible record for future
studies of King and his times. "And
hopefully Dr. King is a big hit,"
Jones said.
The autobiography is due in fall
1998 to commemorate the 30th an
niversary of King's death.
