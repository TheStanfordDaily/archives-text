# Carson to compile MLK autobiography
## History prof described as the 'foremost expert' 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
The monumental task of com
piling Martin Luther King Jr.'s
life into a single autobiography
has been entrusted to the care of
Stanford History Prof. Clay
borne Carson.
In cooperation with Time
Warner Inc., the King estate will
also publish King's complete
written works, which have not
previously been available to the
public
Carson acts as the senior edi
tor and director of the King Pa
pers Project, a University-fund
ed research center housed in Cy
press Hall. Project researchers
are working to compile an un
precedented, annotated 14-vol
ume edition of King's previously
unavailable manuscripts to add
to the thousands of scholarly,
journalistic and biographical
works already published about
him.
To Carson's surprise, in 1985
Coretta Scott King, the wife of
the late civil rights leader, called
and asked him to serve as the di
rector of the Papers Project.
Since then, Carson and his group
have meticulously completed
three volumes.
Carson's other project, the au
tobiography of King, will also be
published in partnership with
Time Warner and the King es
tate. By piecing together King's
words from speeches and ser
mons and private correspon
dences, the memoir will be com
pletely in his own words.
"The trick is to find just the
right material by searching
through the hundreds of thou
sands of documents we have on
