## 
### Tienlon Ho Contributing writer 
In celebration of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday
on Wednesday, the Black Community Services Center
has planned a week of commemorative events which
features a keynote address by New York University
Law Prof. Derrick Bell.
Bell, who taught a brief stint at Stanford Law
School in 1986, is best known for his protest at Harvard
University because of its lack of tenured female and mi
nority female faculty members.
Bell's refusal to return from a two-year leave of ab
sence taken in protest resulted in his dismissal as Har
vard School's first black tenured law professor.
The center has planned several events in addition to

Bell's lecture, book signing and open forum.
In preparation for the week, several dorm resident
fellows have provided students with excerpts from
King's works and will be holding open discussion fo
rums to encourage students to attend Bell's speeches,
said Morris Graves, director of the community center.
A birthday party- in White Plaza and an open house
for the African and Afro-American Studies Program
are scheduled for Monday. Visitors are invited to learn
more about the King Papers Project, a publishing en
deavor headed by History Prof. Clayborne Carson, on
Wednesday.
Concluding the week's events on Sunday, Memori
al Church will offer a public worship service honoring
King's life and work.
Graves said the Martin Luther
King Committee selected Bell from a
large pool of politicians, celebrities
and scholars.
Asst. Director of Student Activi
ties Troy Gilbert specifically men
tioned Bell's ability to communicate
methods to bring about social
change as one of the reasons for his
selection.
Bell aims to spread both his and
King's message through his several
books, including his most recent
work, "Gospel Choirs: Psalms of Sur
vival in an Alien Land Called Home."
Gospel music and its connection
with Martin Luther King will be the
subject of Bell's lecture Wednesday
in Kresge Auditorium. Bell will read
passages from his book, and the
Stanford gospel choir will accompa-

Ny him with renditions of works
about the civil rights leader.
Bell explained that he chose music
as the subject of his book to contrast
with our "dire situation" as a nation.
"No one wants to really deal with
the economic uncertainty we're fac
ing," he said. "Instead there is a ten
dency to take it out on the minori
ties."
Bell said he realized that working
from the legal angle is actually slow
in causing legislative change.
He presents his politically fla
vored speeches in partnership with
live choirs because "music combined
with text elevates both to such a level
that they inspire more than either
are able to do by themselves," Bell
said.
Bell said the celebrations will
hopefully remind everyone that
"struggle has a triumph quality even
when battles are lost." King exempli
fied the essence of leadership — tak
ing risks and sacrificing popularity
for the dream, he said.
