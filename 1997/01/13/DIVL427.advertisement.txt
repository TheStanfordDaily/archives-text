Make the Campfire Right Before you Light
Smokey is counting on you to build a safe campfire.
1. Dig a small pit away from overhanging branches.
2. Circle the pit with rocks.
3. Clear a five-foot area around the pit down to the soil.
4. Keep a bucket of water and shovel nearby.
5. Stack extra wood upwind and away from the fire.
6. After lighting, do not discard match until it is cold.
7. Never leave a campfire unattended, even for a
minute.
REMEMBER, ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES
