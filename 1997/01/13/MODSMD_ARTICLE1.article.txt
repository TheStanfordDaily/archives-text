# Stanford research supports Ebonics
## Work by linguist Rickford used in Oakland's decision 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
The recent decision of the Oakland School Board to in
clude Ebonics, or African-American Vernacular English, in
its curriculum has provoked high-profile controversy
across the nation.
But what much of the country doesn't know is that re
search done at Stanford has provided much of the evidence
to support the decision.
Studies by Linguistics Prof. John Rickford demonstrate
that black children may learn Standard English better
when made aware of the differences between it and the di
alect. Rickford has been actively discussing his research
since the school board's decision.
"What we have seen is that experimental evidence sup
ports the resolution that teaching African-American Ver
nacular English is linguistically and pedagogically sound,"
said Rickford, who teaches a class in African-American Ver
nacular English at Stanford.
He said the state and national outcry against the pro
posal is unfounded and almost embarrassing, as California
already has a program in effect that is designed to bridge
speakers of African-American Vernacular English to Stan
dard English. The program uses contrastive analysis of the
two languages to draw attention to their differences.
Rickford said two aspects play into an Ebonics-speaking
child's ability to learn Standard English. One is the child's
recognition of the grammatical differences between the
African-American Vernacular English and Standard Eng
lish. The second is the need for the child's teachers to accept
Ebonics as a legitimate dialect with a systematic, regular
nature, instead of just simple slang.
Another Stanford professor, John Baugh, who teaches a
graduate course on the history of African-American Eng
lish, agreed, saying that teachers need to look at the best
way to help students and Ebonics could be the key to reach
ing kids. He emphasized the importance of the role of lin
guists as the school board continues with its plans.
"It is vital that people not equate race with linguistic be
havior," Baugh said. He explained that recent research em
phasizes the roots of African-American Vernacular English
in slavery and that it is not linguistically related to Ja
maican- or Haitian-English dialects. The term Ebonics
refers to all non-standard dialects spoken in America by
African Americans.
The need for children to recognize the grammatical dif
ferences can be compared to a native Spanish speaker try
ing to learn English as a second language. Only if the speak
er understands the rules in his own language is it possible
for him to comprehend a foreign one.

Linguistics Prof. John Rickford has done research on Ebonics, or African-
American Vernacular English.
In a 1995 article for the academ
ic Journal Linguistics and Educa
tion, Rickford discussed the impor
tance of using dialect readers, or
texts written in the African-Ameri
can vernacular, to improve reading
comprehension.
Recently, Rickford authored a
resolution passed by the Linguistic
Society of America which acknowl
edged African-American Vernacu
lar English as a rule-governed lin
guistic entity.
"If children can do a contrastive
analysis and use materials written

in dialect, it increases their con
sciousness of the differences," said
Rickford. "Also, when teachers be
come aware of the difference, they
have a more positive attitude to
ward the kids."
A study conducted by Stanford
undergraduates in 1994 showed
that students in East Menlo Park
schools in grades six through eight
had higher reading comprehension
of Standard English when teachers
used the African-American Vernac
ular English to teach and build on
what the children already know
(the dialect) to help them under
stand what they need to know
(Standard English).
The four undergraduate stu
dents, who were conducting their

research for Rickford's class, ad
ministered two short readings in
both the non-standard dialect and
in Standard English. If students
were tested on one of the stories, "A
Friend in Need," in Standard Eng
lish, then they read the other,
"Dreamy Mae," in dialect.
Results showed the students did
considerably better on the compre
hension tests in African-American
Vernacular English.
Rickford said studies that have
been done in other areas of the
United States have shown that
when students used contrastive
analysis, there was a gradual reduc
tion of the amount of spoken Ebon
ics and an increase in Standard
English comprehension.

"By building on the language
skills [through the use of Ebonics 1
the students already have, hopeful
ly we will have more successful re
sults," he said.
Rickford said he hopes Stanford
researchers will continue to involve
themselves in Oakland's plans. "I
feel that linguists need to provide a
service to the communities where
they work in return for the research
they conduct there.
"I also plan to be involved in
working on and setting up the pre
and post-tests and helping design
the research" for the Oakland pro
gram, he said. "It is important to
get real results on the new methods,
not just rely on whether the stu
dents are happy."
