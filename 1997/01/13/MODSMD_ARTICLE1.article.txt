# Stanford research supports Ebonics
## Work by linguist Rickford used in Oakland's decision 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
The recent decision of the Oakland School Board to in
clude Ebonics, or African-American Vernacular English, in
its curriculum has provoked high-profile controversy
across the nation.
But what much of the country doesn't know is that re
search done at Stanford has provided much of the evidence
to support the decision.
Studies by Linguistics Prof. John Rickford demonstrate
that black children may learn Standard English better
when made aware of the differences between it and the di
alect. Rickford has been actively discussing his research
since the school board's decision.
"What we have seen is that experimental evidence sup
ports the resolution that teaching African-American Ver
nacular English is linguistically and pedagogically sound,"
said Rickford, who teaches a class in African-American Ver
nacular English at Stanford.
He said the state and national outcry against the pro
posal is unfounded and almost embarrassing, as California
already has a program in effect that is designed to bridge
speakers of African-American Vernacular English to Stan
dard English. The program uses contrastive analysis of the
two languages to draw attention to their differences.
Rickford said two aspects play into an Ebonics-speaking
child's ability to learn Standard English. One is the child's
recognition of the grammatical differences between the
African-American Vernacular English and Standard Eng
lish. The second is the need for the child's teachers to accept
Ebonics as a legitimate dialect with a systematic, regular
nature, instead of just simple slang.
Another Stanford professor, John Baugh, who teaches a
graduate course on the history of African-American Eng
lish, agreed, saying that teachers need to look at the best
way to help students and Ebonics could be the key to reach
ing kids. He emphasized the importance of the role of lin
guists as the school board continues with its plans.
"It is vital that people not equate race with linguistic be
havior," Baugh said. He explained that recent research em
phasizes the roots of African-American Vernacular English
in slavery and that it is not linguistically related to Ja
maican- or Haitian-English dialects. The term Ebonics
refers to all non-standard dialects spoken in America by
African Americans.
The need for children to recognize the grammatical dif
ferences can be compared to a native Spanish speaker try
ing to learn English as a second language. Only if the speak
er understands the rules in his own language is it possible
for him to comprehend a foreign one.
