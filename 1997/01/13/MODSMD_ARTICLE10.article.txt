## Socialists talk Governing ex-Communists to meet with Bulgarian protesters 
### 
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Faced with Bulgaria's
bloodiest uprising since the end of Stalinist rule, the
governing ex-Communists agreed yesterday to hold
talks with opposition leaders demanding early elec
tions.
Georgi Parvanov, the leader of the Socialist Party,
said on state television that talks could start today. He
made it clear, however, that he expected his party to
stay in power for at least another year to "stabilize"
Bulgaria, which is undergoing its worst economic crisis
since 1989.
Unsatisfied, the opposition vowed to keep up daily
protests until the government sets an election date.
Yesterday, 100,000 people demonstrated in Sofia and
tens of thousands of others in cities nationwide to back
its demand for an early vote that could drive the cur
rent government from power.
Still, the government's concession was a step for
ward. The crowd in Sofia cheered "Victory!" and "Elec
tions!" when opposition leaders announced that the
Socialists would consider their demands.
Frustrated that parliamentary elections weren't due
until December 1998, the opposition says the Socialists
have lost the country's trust and should face a new
vote. The Socialists currently hold 125 of parliament's
240 seats.
"The Socialists violated basic human rights, and we
have the right to ask them to step down," Ivan Rostov,
leader of the main opposition Union, of Democratic
Forces, told the crowd.
The Sofia protests have been inspired in part by
almost two months of peaceful demonstrations in Ser
bia, where the opposition wants the ex-Communist
government of President Slobodan Milosevic to recog
nize its victory in November municipal elections.
Belgrade students have held separate daily protests,
and yesterday several thousand students did the same
in Sofia. They marched through the city's center, stop
ping at Socialist party headquarters to chant, "We are
students. We are not afraid of you!" and "We'll be here
every day until our victory."
The groundswell of anti-Communist opposition
across the Balkans is spawning talk of a second 1989,
when the Berlin Wall fell and Stalinism crumbled
across the former Soviet bloc.
