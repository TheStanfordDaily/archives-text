TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Jordan's King
Hussein persuaded Yasser Arafat yesterday
to accept a prolonged Israeli withdrawal
from West Bank rural areas, sources said,
in a concession that could hasten a compre
hensive accord on expanding Palestinian
autonomy.
"We can envision the end of the negotia
tion in sight," said Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu after meeting with
Hussein. "Because of the important initia
tive His Majesty took we have made consid
erable progress."
Earlier in Gaza, Yasser Arafat agreed to
Hussein's proposal that Israel could pro
long its three-stage withdrawal from West
Bank rural areas, narrowing the gap on the
key sticking point in the talks, a top Pales
tinian official told The Associated Press.
The official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that if Netanyahu agreed
to the proposal, a signing was expected
today — ending four months of rocky nego
tiations.
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators were
planning to meet this morning in
Jerusalem to write out the agreement, said
Ed Abington, the U.S. consul in Jerusalem.
"We expect that there will be no problem
and that the drafting will conclude soon
and we will have an agreement and a basis
for a Netanyahu-Arafat summit .. . very,
very soon," Abington said.
In Tel Aviv, Netanyahu, Hussein and
U.S. envoy Dennis Ross were upbeat but
noncommittal, saying some work remained.
"I leave here confident that everything
will move in the right direction ... a fresh
beginning to continue the work to achieve
the kind of peace and the kind of future we
seek," Hussein said after the meeting.
"We are closer than we were," said Ross,
adding that he would now remain in the

region despite earlier plans to return to
Washington yesterday. Ross had urged
Hussein to get involved in the mediations.
The Jordanian monarch, whose motor
cade was escorted last night by police cars,
was received with a warm, two-handed
handshake by Netanyahu.
"King Hussein has been a great friend of
Israel and a great friend of peace,"
Netanyahu said. "I'm looking forward to
our conversation."
"I'm happy to be here," replied Hussein.
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erakat joined Hussein for the trip to Tel
Aviv.
Although the sides have agreed on the
details of Israel's 10-month-late pullout
from Hebron, the signing has been held up
by a dispute over the timetable for a
promised three-stage pullout from West
Bank rural areas.
The 1995 Israel-PLO agreement calls for
that withdrawal to be completed by
September. Israel, arguing that the securi
ty situation has changed, said the end of
1998 was the earliest possible date for the
completion.
The Palestinian official said the compro
mise proposal would require Israel to com
plete the three stages by mid-1998 — a sig
nificant departure from the Palestinians'
previous insistence on the original deadline.
In Gaza, Hussein and Arafat spoke by
phone to several world leaders. At one
point, according to Palestinian sources, a
conference call included Egyptian Presi
dent Hosni Mubarak, Netanyahu and U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christoper.
Saturday night, Arafat's self-rule gov
ernment warned that "If the international
community does not intervene to save the
peace process from the danger it is in ...
the retrion will witness an exnlosion "
