Female cadets leave Citadel
CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) - Two female
Citadel cadets who said they endured freshman haz
ing that included having their clothes set afire
announced yesterday they would not return to the
military college.
"The school's promises to me and my family that
knob life would be rough but safe were critical to
me," Jeanie Mentavlos of Charlotte, N.C., said in a
statement released by her attorney. "Because The
Citadel broke its promise, I cannot return."
While a federal judge had offered to take steps to
assure the women's safety "it is apparent to me ...
that while I might be physically safe on campus, I
would not be welcome," Kim Messer of Clover said
in a similar statement.
The FBI and state police were investigating alle
gations that, among other things, male cadets set
the clothes of the women on fire, sexually harassed
them and put cleanser in their mouths. Authorities
were also looking into whether death threats were
made against one woman. Eleven male cadets face
disciplinary action.
"I never asked for special treatment at The
Citadel," Messer said. "I asked, and was promised,
that I would be treated like any other Fourth Class
cadet. In return, however, I received special treat
ment. Special treatment by way of criminal
assaults, sadistic illegal hazing and disgusting inci
dents of sexual harassment."

Smoking contributes to wrinkles
LONDON (AP) — Smoking brings on skin
wrinkles more quickly and generally hastens the
aging process, according to a study released yester
day.
Britain's state-funded Health Education Author
ity said it hoped the study — based on observations
of identical twins — will sway young smokers, the
group most likely to ignore warnings about lung
cancer and other health risks.
"It's always been known from observation that
smoking makes you age more quickly, but this has
never been demonstrated in much scientific detail
before," said Dr. Tim Spector, head of the twin
research unit at St. Thomas' Hospital.
A helping hand
WASHINGTON (AP) — A record number of "A"
students entered college last fall, more confident
than ever about their abilities but increasingly wor
ried about how to pay for their education.
They also prefer community service such as vol
unteer work to traditional politics: a record 72 per
cent reported some kind of volunteer activity.
More want to enter helping professions like
teaching or medicine, shunning business, according
to an annual survey of college freshmen released
yesterday. Interest in law dropped to an all-time low
after peaking, like business, in the 1980s.
