## Editorial A 						part-time option 
### 
Allow seniors in their
last quarter to register
as part-time students

HERE'S A COMMON sce
nario on the Farm: You
have a dedicated, hard
working Stanford senior; let's say
he's an English major whose goal in
life is to become a book editor.
With only one quarter left at the
University, Mr. English is all set to
receive his diploma — except he
still has to take (and pass) one last
class. Maybe it's that wretched
world cultures DR or maybe it's the
dreaded "dagger" DR.
The fact of the matter is that one
little class is all that stands between
our senior friend and his dreams of
"Pomp and Circumstance." Just
one class . . . and a tuition bill for
approximately $6,830.
"What?" you ask. Almost $7,000
for just one class? That's what reg
ular, full-time students pay. Isn't
there a discounted rate for part
time students?
Not at Stanford there isn't.
Currently, University policy
requires undergraduates to register
for a full-time course load of 12
units each quarter; requests to reg
ister for a lighter class schedule are
reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
Last quarter only 27 students were
permitted to study part-time.
According to Registrar Roger
Printup, the students who are
allowed to enroll part-time general
ly fall into one of two categories:
people who have a medical emer
gency or a medical condition that
prevents them from carrying a full
course load; or older students who
have a job and family responsibili
ties.
So, where does that leave our
senior friend? Unless he's among
the 27 lucky students who can reg
ister for eight, nine or 10 units (and
thus pay $2,000 to $3,000 less in
tuition each quarter), Mr. English
is forced to register and pay for at
least 12 units.

It seems like a silly situation,
doesn't it? What if Mr. English
wants to get a full-time, paid
internship at a publishing compa
ny? The internship will undoubted
ly be more useful to him than those
unwanted classes; these days it
seems that work experience is prac
tically a prerequisite for getting any
decent job after college. Plus, his
salary will help pay off some oi
those steep college loans.
Granted, there are good reasons
for the University's current policy.
Stanford is unique from many
other institutions that cater to
part-time students — such as com
munity colleges and state-support
ed universities. Stanford's entire
educational program is based on
the assumption that students will
be engaged in full-time study;
that's why students receive the
level of housing and dining services
that they do.
And then, as always, there is
the money. According to Printup,
if each of the 1,600 seniors were
to study part-time for one quar
ter, tuition revenues would be
reduced by about $3 million.
That reduction, he said, would
most likely have to be made up by
increasing tuition during the
other quarters.
However, it is ridiculous to
assume that the loss would be that
high. Given that many financial aid
programs require students to enroll
full-time, it is likely that only a
small percentage of students would
choose the part-time option. As for
concerns that allowing people to
register part-time would negatively
affect Stanford's academic atmo
sphere, it is crucial that the part
time option only be afforded to
seniors in their last quarter. No one
is suggesting that freshmen take
eight units.
The Faculty Senate's Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement ought to re-evaluate
this outdated policy requiring full
time undergraduate enrollment.
Go ahead, ask students what's
important to them and listen to
their responses.
