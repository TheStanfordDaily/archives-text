## Stop Megaphones On Campus 
### 
COLLEGE IS A time to learn and
grow. It is a time to find your
interests and decide which ones
you want to spend your life pursuing.
College is a time to question traditional
values and beliefs, to formulate your
own opinions and to make your mark.
Many college students find that they
are discontent with some part of our
society, and they make efforts to change
that which seems unjust. This is the
origin of the widespread student
activism that exists on college campuses
around the world.
Student activism comes in many
forms. It can be seen in the form of
worthwhile and rewarding community
service work, protests and boycotts or,
most notably, in the< form of a short
man standing near the Claw with a
megaphone annoying the heck out of all
who venture within earshot.
Don't get me wrong, the use of mega
phones has been an important part of
the protest mechanism for a long time.
The megaphone became a powerful tool
for social change during the radical
time of student activism and social
change that occurred during the 19605.
But these days everyone who feels they
have something to say tells the world
(whether they want to hear it or not)
via Radio Shack-issue megaphones.
In the past we've seen numerous
megaphone-clad outsiders come to cam
pus to warn us of the apocalypse and to
discontinue our nefarious lifestyles.
These people are, at the very least,

entertaining. Although I question some
of their specific beliefs and their narrow
views, their intentions — to save our
souls — are some of the best imagin
able.
More recently, a short, questionably
dressed prophet has emerged from
among our ranks. He has a megaphone,
and he promises to save us from the
inevitable doom that campus monopo
lies will bring. He might not save your
soul, but he'll save you a couple of
bucks. Hallelujah!
This man, Danny Bramzon (aka
Danny from Miami), recognizing that
the Stanford Bookstore was an on-cam
pus monopoly, formed Stop Monopolies
On Campus (SMOC) and started a stu
dent-run book-buying co-op. Now he
spends his days trying, quite overzeal
ously, to get everyone to participate.
I think that SMOC, like the traveling
evangelists that come to campus, is
well-intentioned. Unlike the passing
preachers, SMOC could end up being a
permanent fixture. This is not good.
Think about what would happen if
SMOC gained support. What will its
next mission be? It could develop soup
kitchens to fight the tyrannical forces of
food service.
Or maybe SMOC will start its own
academic departments to challenge the
monopoly that Stanford's academic
departments have on campus.
SMOC faces a big problem because
Stanford comprises all of Stanford, and
it is inherently a monopoly. Any ser

vices that Stanford provides its stu
dents will be part of the local monopoly
that Stanford is. When we decided to
come to Stanford, we accepted that con
dition. We all agreed to spend a number
of years living under the rules and
implicit costs that are associated with
Stanford.
Admittedly, some of these costs are
avoidable, and SMOC is in the right for
trying to make things a little cheaper
for us all. However, its specific means of
pursuing its goals are far too confronta
tional and annoying for such a menial
cause.
SMOC approaches inflated book
prices like they were the end of the
world, which I can confidently assure
you, they are not. Bramzon's vehement
megaphone campaign has done more to
discourage me from participating in his
program than anything else, and I think
there are far more important issues to
be tackled on campus.
Every year tuition increases by an
amount much greater than the Book
store's price inflation on books. Maybe
Danny's kids could leave their Book
store vigil to go have a little bullhorn
dialogue with the bursar sometime.

Elliott Brown thinks there's a great
future in earplugs.
