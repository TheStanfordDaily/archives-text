# Final Sand Hill EIR completed
## PA council may vote by Feb. 11 
### Marni Leff Staff writer 
After more than four years and
$1.3 million spent on consultants,
the Palo Alto City Council is likely to
reach a decision on the extension of
Sand Hill Road by Feb. 11. Con
struction could begin as early as the
end of this summer.
The final draft of a state-mandat
edenvironmental impact report was
completed and made public on Fri
day and public hearings are sched
uled Jan. 27 and 30 to give citizens a
final chance to express their con
cerns about the controversial pro
ject.
After the public hearings are
complete, the project proposal will
be sent to the Palo Alto City Council
for deliberation, according to Lori
Topley of the City Planner's Office.

The council will debate whether to
certify the environmental impact re
port and then make a decision ahout
the project.
Four meetings are scheduled be
tween Feb. 4 and 11, after which the
council will likely reach a decision,
Topley said.
The project involves extending
Sand Hill Road to El Camino Real,
expanding the Stanford Shopping
Center and building a 630-unit
apartment complex as well as a se
nior housing center on vacant land
on the border of Menlo Park and
Palo Alto. Stanford would pay for
the project, which should cost about
$341 million.
A draft of the environmental im
pact report came out last summer,
and after fielding questions from
local residents, the Palo Alto Plan
ning Committee tried to address cit
izens' concerns in the final report.
"I wouldn't say there are any big
changes between the draft and the
final EIR," Topley said. "We an
swered questions and expanded dis
cussion in some places, but there
were no major changes."
The final draft, Topley explained,
contains lengthened discussion
about possible alternatives to Stan
ford's plan for the project. These al
ternatives include building a two
lane rather than a four-lane road to
connect Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real.
Menlo Park residents who are
concerned about an increase in traf

fic flow into their community that
might be created by an extension of
Sand Hill feel that this represents
an acceptable compromise.
"I think some of the alternatives
proposed by the Planning Commit
tee are right on," said Dan Dippeiy,
a spokesman for Midpeninsula Ac
tion for Tomorrow. "I think that
two lanes would be adequate and
would work quite well."
Stanford administrators in
volved with the project disagree.
"It is very clear that the projects
put forth by Stanford are the superi
or ones," said Director of Communi
ty Relations Andy Coe. "The final
EIR released yesterday stated very
clearly that the four-lane Sand Hill
Road was much superior to a two
lane Sand Hill Road.
Menlo Park residents were also
encouraged by the report's investi
gation into using empty land around

Hoover Pavilion for the apartment
complex and the possibility of
adding stores to the south end of the
shopping center while leaving the
north part of the mall as it is.
Again, Coe said, the University
supports its initial proposal. The
Hoover Pavilion land, he said, has
environmental and other con
straints which prevent it from being
a reasonable alternative.
"The report also notes that the
Hoover site would result in the loss
of the majority of the 340 trees that
currently exist on the site, com
pared to the loss of only 14 tress on
the proposed Stanford West site,"
Coe said.
"These and other reasons cited in
the report severely affect the viabili
ty of the site for housing and mean
that the Stanford West site is the
site best suited to construct the
rental housing."

The final draft of the report, Dip
pery said, was much as his group
thought it would be.
"There were no surprises in the
final EIR," Dippery said. "We still
feel that the project is too big, and
our concerns remain the same."
As for the group's plans, Dippery
said, "For right now, we are going to
hang in there through the hearings.
If it comes to a vote in Palo Alto,
phase two would be to educate peo
ple that the project is too massive
and that Stanford's plans need to be
stopped."
Coe remained very optimistic
about the project, maintaining that
the final environmental impact re
port conclusively states that the
whole project will prove beneficial to
the community. He added that he
expects the project will be supported
during the hearings at the end of the
month.
