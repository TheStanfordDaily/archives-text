Warning signs on buildings don't mean imminent danger

WHILE MAURO CARDENAS
drew an in correct conclusion in
his letter (last Thursday's
Daily), his observation of the warning
sign on the Gilbert Biological Sciences
Building raises interesting issues that are
not unique to Stanford.
In 1986, California voters passed
Proposition 65, or The Safe Drinking
Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, which
requires warning signs in, or near, areas
that contain any one of the substances
from an extensive list of chemicals identi
fied by the state as capable of causing can
cer or reproductive toxicity. You may
have noticed signs posted on gasoline

pumps, outside hospitals, supermarkets,
convenience food stores, bars, restau
rants, hardware stores and hotels, as well
as on the entrance to campus buildings in
which chemicals are stored. (If homes
were public buildings, most would require
warning signs at the front door because of
the chemical contents of cooking and
cleaning substances in the kitchen and
bathroom.)
Cardenas correctly identifies the sign's
intent: to serve as a public warning that
chemicals on a state list are stored and
used within the building. However, the
conclusion that the building is not safe is
unwarranted. Gilbert is a teaching and

research facility, and those activities
require chemicals. The storage and use of
such chemicals is governed by multiple
regulations and requirements, and these
materials are used by people who are
knowledgeable about the materials,
backed by engineering and protective con
trols to ensure safety. Just like Mr. Car
denas, the people who use these materials
do not want to be exposed, and they take
appropriate measures to assure that no
one is.
There are also many locations in the
Gilbert building where chemicals are not
stored nor used, such as the seminar
rooms and classrooms. These locations

are as safe as the classrooms and seminar
rooms in other buildings on campus that
have no comparable laboratory activities.
So, the sign did its job in gaining Mr.
Cardenas' attention. Alas, the law that
required the sign fails in its real purpose:
informing the public on potential toxic
exposures. The first few times one notices
the required signs, they may be alarming;
once one starts looking for the signs, they
are so Ã¼biquitous as to lose impact and
meaning. Either way, the requirement
confuses rather than informs.
