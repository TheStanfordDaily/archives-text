# Stanford should reject money from Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation
## 
### 
I'm surprised how lightly your edito
rial in last Thursday's Daily treated the

idea of Chiang Ching-Kuo's name being
attached to a Stanford Chinese studies
center, even after mentioning that he
was head of Taiwan's secret police. What
do you think the secret police did? Issue
secret parking tickets? Chiang Ching
kuo was responsible for the repression
and killing of scholars who opposed his
father's and his own regime. I can't

believe you compared this to naming
something after Ronald Reagan, who, at
least to his recollection, never had any
dissenting academics murdered. A Chi
ang Ching-kuo center would be like hav
ing a Joseph Stalin Institute for Intellec
tual Freedom. What would this do to
Stanford's reputation?
The research money for Chinese stud

ies would undoubtedly benefit this
school, but we should consider how
being indirectly associated with political
murders might affect Stanford. It would
be much less risky to just stick to our
current policy of begging from Bill
Gates.
