### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
On Saturday, before a packed Maples Pavilion that
saw the Stanford men's basketball team defeat USC,
senior Jos6 Fierro received the Commandant's Tro
phy for outstanding performance at the Marine
Corps's Officer Candidate School.
Only one Commandant's Trophy is awarded each
year in the entire Marine Corps. Fierro was selected as
the best of about 250 officer candidates enrolled in the
Platoon Leader's Course, which is a summer training
course.
"I'm really honored to receive the award," said
Fierro, an electrical engineering major. "There were a
lot of great candidates at the Officer Candidate
School." He added that he won the award by only a
small margin.
Brig. Gen. Charles Bolden Jr., assistant wing com
mander for the Third Marine Aircraft Wing in Mira
mar, Calif., presented the trophy to Fierro during the
halftime of the Stanford-USC game.
A veteran of 29 years in the Marines and one of only
four black generals in the Corps, BciJen said the
award "represents the fact that Jose excelled at every
thing he was asked to do when he went through his
two summers of officer candidate training and, more

importantly, that he not only did the best he could do
but was the best we could produce in the summer of
1996. He is being recognized as the top graduate from
officer training and the best of the senior increment."
Bolden was asked to represent the commandant of
the Marine Corps, who was unable to attend the pre
sentation ceremony.
Fierro will be commissioned as a second lieutenant in
the Marines after he obtains his degree and will attend
basic training in Quantico, Va., for six months. After
that Fierro has a guaranteed contract which will allow
him to attend aviation officer school in Pensacola, Fla.
"Right now, I'm happy where I am and where I'm
going. Going to the Marines will give me a lot of choic
es," Fierro said.
The School of Engineering received a trophy dur
ing the halftime ceremony as well.
"We recognize the school from which the candidate
comes with a traveling trophy," Bolden explained.
"The award goes to the school for what they have con
tributed to [Fierro's] development as a leader. We
know that we do our part. It's kind of impossible if,
one, there's not a halfway decent family upbringing
and two, a good environment to do your studying."
In addition to being a Marine candidate, Fierro
runs the 3,000-meter steeplechase for Stanford's var
sity track team.
