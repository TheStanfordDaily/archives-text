## 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
The 10th edition of the Woman's Guide to Stan
ford — a publication distributed to all freshman,
graduate and transfer women — has been released
on campus.
Editor in Chief Melanie Corn, a senior, explained
that the publication especially for women highlights
the issues, resources and opportunities for women at
Stanford. The guide is divided into five sections, in
cluding campus life, academic life, health, sexuality
and violence against women.
"The guide celebrates all of the amazing opportuni
ties available to women on this campus," Corn said.
"The goal of the guide is to make women more aware
of the resources available to them on this campus on a
variety of issues."
Founded in 1974, the Women's Guide, housed in
the Women's Center, has served as a publication and
information book that caters to the needs of Stanford
women on campus. Plagued by a lack of funding, the
guide has not been published every year. Corn hopes
that with greater participation and organization, the
guide can become an annual publication.
"We got a real haphazard start, in that nothing was
saved on disk from previous guides," Corn said. "We
also had to raise $4,000 to produce the guide. Through
financial support from dorms, [academicl depart-

ments and the police station, we were able to raise the
funds."
Corn and the guide's contributing writers compiled
much of their information from older guides, but they
also expanded and changed elements of the publica
tion, adding more user-friendly tables and graphs.
"We worked on expanding the academic portion of
the guide and on providing a greater variety of infor
mation," explained junior Michele Hwu, a financial
manager and contributing writer for the guide. "For
example, many new students are not aware of the Ca
reer Planning and Placement Center, and we try to let
them know how they can find information."
The guide also serves as a place for explanations of
important women's issues.
"The guide is the only resource on campus where
they mention health and psychological issues at Stan
ford," explained Hwu.
Corn agreed. "The guide is different than the Stan
ford Directory in that it is the guide where women can
go to learn about how to protect themsolves against vi
olence, birth control and STDs," she said.
"I really encourage people to become involved in
writing for next year's guide, as well as other valuable
things going on at the Women's Center," Corn said.
"We are always looking for new people. It is a great
way to get involved."
Copies of the guide are free and can be picked up at
the Women's Center.
