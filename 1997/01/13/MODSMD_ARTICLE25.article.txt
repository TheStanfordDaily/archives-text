### Therese Lee Staff writer 
The University Fellows met with a group of stu
dents last week to discuss the state of interdiscipli
nary programs at Stanford.
The University Fellows, established vears ago
as a basic forum of discussion, consist. A a dozen
faculty and administration membi rs. Each is ap
pointed to serve for two years by University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper.
The group discussed the survival of interdiscipli
nary programs in the academic setting and also ex
plored ways the programs fit into the undergradu
ate liberal education and post-college experience.
Four students were invited by the fellows to de
liver a presentation on their concerns about inter
disciplinary programs. Traditionally, presenters
have been either distinguished scholars or other
noted figures, said University Fellow and Dean of
Students Marc Wais. This was the first time that
students have been invited to meet with the
group.
"In that respect, it was helpful and very enlight
ening for us to really dialogue with the students,"
said Wais. "This meeting was really unique."
ASSU Special Projects Director Michael Putnam
was one of the four students who delivered a 90-
minute presentation. Earlier in the year, he was a
key planner of an interdisciplinary program panel of
faculty and students.
"This is a great example of involving students in
University dialogue, and I hope that this will con
tinue," Putnam said. "I hope we won't be the last
students to be in front of the University Fellows."
The meeting was part of a year-long endeavor
by the University Fellows to conduct a thorough
discussion on the role of interdisciplinary cooper-

ation at Stanford.
Before each school year begins, the faculty mem
bers meet and choose a theme to be explored during
the coming quarters. The University Fellows then
meet four times per quarter to hear presentations
on the chosen topic.
During the fall quarter, the fellows focused on
the history of interdisciplinary programs.
"This quarter we thought we would also on some
specific issues," said Human Biology Prof. Herant
Katchadourian, coordinator of the University Fel
lows.
"We were very interested in getting a group of
students to come and speak to the fellows on their
perceptions of IDPs," Katchadourian said. "They
did an excellent job articulating their concerns and
made a very strong impression."
The presenters left the meeting with similar sen
timents. "We were pleasantly surprised at the
amount of honesty and frankness" of the discus
sion, Putnam said. The fellows "were very open and
receptive."
At the end of the year, the fellows will meet with
Casper and Provost Condoleezza Rice to discuss
what they have learned. However, the group makes
no formal reports or recommendations; it is strictly
discussion-based.
Putnam plans to submit a report on interdiscipli
nary programs to the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies based on the panel he organized earlier this
year. It will contain recommendations to the Uni
versity that he hopes will be presented to the Facul
ty Senate.
"What I hope to come out of this is really a clos
ing of the gap between recognizing the excellence of
interdisciplinary programs in undergraduate edu
cation and the amount of support they're given at
the University," Putnam said.
