## Manning earns MVP honors in Shrine game 
### Tomoeh Murakami Blake Thompson Contributing writers 
Three Stanford seniors
joined the nation's best on the
West all-star team Saturday at
the East-West Shrine Classic,
a college football all-star game
held at Stanford Stadium. The
Shrine Classic is held annually
at Stanford for senior college
football players, giving them
an opportunity to show off
their skills to scouts and fans
across the country.
Wide receiver Brian Man
ning thrilled the crowd with
six catches and was honored
with the Coffman award given
to the outstanding offensive
player of the game.
Manning, tight end Greg
Clark and offensive lineman
Brad Badger represented the
Cardinal squad on their home
field for a final time. The
seniors, after winning their
last five games in a Cardinal
uniform, all competed on the
West team, which was defeat
ed by the East all-stars 17-13.
Manning's performance,
which included six catches for
115 yards, excited the home
crowd and made him the sixth
Stanford player in the 72-year
history of the game to win the
award. He became the first
Stanford player to win the
MVP award since Ed McCaf
frey in 1991.
The award was especially
sweet for Manning, who was
not originally supposed to
compete in the game but

received a late invitation to
play when Colorado's Rae Car
ruth withdrew.
"A lot of things have hap
pened this week that you only
dream of," Manning said. "I
hope I opened some eyes
today."
More than 300 scouts, rep
resenting all of the NFL and
Canadian teams, were at the
highly publicized game along
with the hyped crowd of
62,500. Most of the scouts
observed the talented athletes
all through the week as they
prepared on the Cardinal prac
tice field.
According to Dan Rambo,
director of player personnel for
the Saskatchewan Roughrid
ers, most scouts say a player
can only raise his stock in a
post-season all-star game such
as this one. Rambo was also a
former scout for the Denver
Broncos, and its star quarter
back, Stanford alumnus John
Elway, is not the only Cardinal
who earned Rambo's praise.
"Manning is doing a good
job," Rambo said. "He stood
out in practices all week long. I
know I'm going to go back and
watch more films of Man
ning."
According to Rambo, char
acter as well as a high level of
skill are the two most impor
tant factors in a draft pick, and
the Cardinal players seem to
have them.
"Clark's got size. He's got
speed. He's smart enough, and
