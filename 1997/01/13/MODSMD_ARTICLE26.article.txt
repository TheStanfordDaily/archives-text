## Manning earns MVP honors in Shrine game 
### Tomoeh Murakami Blake Thompson Contributing writers 
Three Stanford seniors
joined the nation's best on the
West all-star team Saturday at
the East-West Shrine Classic,
a college football all-star game
held at Stanford Stadium. The
Shrine Classic is held annually
at Stanford for senior college
football players, giving them
an opportunity to show off
their skills to scouts and fans
across the country.
Wide receiver Brian Man
ning thrilled the crowd with
six catches and was honored
with the Coffman award given
to the outstanding offensive
player of the game.
Manning, tight end Greg
Clark and offensive lineman
Brad Badger represented the
Cardinal squad on their home
field for a final time. The
seniors, after winning their
last five games in a Cardinal
uniform, all competed on the
West team, which was defeat
ed by the East all-stars 17-13.
Manning's performance,
which included six catches for
115 yards, excited the home
crowd and made him the sixth
Stanford player in the 72-year
history of the game to win the
award. He became the first
Stanford player to win the
MVP award since Ed McCaf
frey in 1991.
The award was especially
sweet for Manning, who was
not originally supposed to
compete in the game but

received a late invitation to
play when Colorado's Rae Car
ruth withdrew.
"A lot of things have hap
pened this week that you only
dream of," Manning said. "I
hope I opened some eyes
today."
More than 300 scouts, rep
resenting all of the NFL and
Canadian teams, were at the
highly publicized game along
with the hyped crowd of
62,500. Most of the scouts
observed the talented athletes
all through the week as they
prepared on the Cardinal prac
tice field.
According to Dan Rambo,
director of player personnel for
the Saskatchewan Roughrid
ers, most scouts say a player
can only raise his stock in a
post-season all-star game such
as this one. Rambo was also a
former scout for the Denver
Broncos, and its star quarter
back, Stanford alumnus John
Elway, is not the only Cardinal
who earned Rambo's praise.
"Manning is doing a good
job," Rambo said. "He stood
out in practices all week long. I
know I'm going to go back and
watch more films of Man
ning."
According to Rambo, char
acter as well as a high level of
skill are the two most impor
tant factors in a draft pick, and
the Cardinal players seem to
have them.
"Clark's got size. He's got
speed. He's smart enough, and
he seems like a pretty nice kid,"
Rambo said. "Badger has good
grades from NFL scouts. He
could use a bit of extra weight,
but he's big enough."
The high level of play execut
ed in the close and exciting con
test made the scouts' visits
worthwhile.
The East built a 6-0 lead going
into halftime after a 20-yard
touchdown pass from Valdosta
State's Lance Funderburk to
Southwest Louisiana's Kenyon
Cotton. The East then extended
its lead to 14-0 on a touchdown
by Ohio State defensive lineman
Matt Finkes, winner of the
award for most outstanding

defensive player in the game.
Finkes intercepted Brigham
Young quarterback Steve Sark
isian's pass and ran it back for a
touchdown on the first play of
the second half.
The West stormed back to
close the gap to 14-13 after three
strong drives in the third quar
ter. On the first drive, Sarkisian
found Manning for two diving
catches to take the ball deep into
East territory before California's
Ryan Longwell finished the drive
with a 25-yard field goal to put
the West on the scoreboard.
Then on the next West scoring
drive, Colorado State running
back Calvin Branch rumbled
through the East defense for a
27-yard touchdown run behind
the blocking of Badger to bring
the West to within four, 14-10.
Finally, another long comple

tion from Sarkisian to Manning
set up a second West field goal,
cutting the lead to 14-13. But
this was the closest the West got
to victory, as the East added
another field goal and then
stopped Cal quarterback Pat
Barnes and the West offense on
four successive plays from the
East 2-yard line with 6 minutes
to go, holding on for a 17-13 win.
The game, begun in 1925, is
played to benefit Shriners Hospi
tals for Children throughout
North America and has raised
more than $14 million over the
years.
While agreeing that the all
star experience was a blast, the
Cardinal players said the best
part was playing the game for the
children in the hospitals. During
the week-long Shrine experience,
the two teams visited and spent

time with the children, surpris
ing them with presents.
"The neatest part is that it
helps out the Shriners Hospital.
I don't think any of us knew
what the game was really for
before," said Clark, kneeling for
a photo with an eager,
wheelchair-bound child from
Shriners Hospital.
Surrounded by a crowd of lit
tle fans, teammate Badger
agreed.
"It was a good feeling to be
honored as a football player and
to come out and play for a good
cause," Badger said as he signed
one game pamphlet after another.
East coach Barry Alvarez of
Wisconsin praised the athletes'
efforts. "I thought the kids com
peted real hard on both teams. I
was proud of our kids, the way
they hung in there."
