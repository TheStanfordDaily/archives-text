# Menâ€™s swimming defeats Michigan
## 
### Casey Harmond Contributing writer 
In its biggest meet of the year thus far, the Stan
ford men's swim team dominated Michigan Friday at
deGuerre Pool 139-104.
The day's beautiful weather, along with the pres
ence of many fans and the entertainment of the Stan
ford Band, created an energized atmosphere in which
Stanford's impressive depth and outstanding individ
ual performances overcame a Wolverine squad that
boasted four Olympians.
The depth of the Stanford team was immediately
shown in the first event, the 400-yard medley relay,
in which the Stanford A and B teams finished first
and second, ahead of Michigan's A team at third.
Both of Stanford's leadoff swimmers, sophomores
Tate Blahnik and Dan Schultz, got a split under 50
seconds in the 100-yard backstroke leg, an impressive
showing of speed after coming off three weeks of hard
training. The final times for the Stanford A and B
relay teams (3:17.9 and 3:21.8, respectively) place
among the top 12 times in the NCAA this year.
The momentum of the first relay was built upon by
Stanford's distance specialists in the very next event,
the 1,000-yard freestyle. Again it was a one-two finish
for the Cardinal, as senior Kevin Radvany's winning
time of 9:06.95 became the fastest performance in the
country this year by a full 2 seconds.
"After our relay teams went one-two, I wanted to
keep the momentum going," said Radvany.
Sophomore Matt O'Mara outraced Michigan swim
mers Mike McWha and Andy Potts in the last 400
yards of the race, finishing second in 9:13.72 to post
this year's eighth fastest time. And like Radvany,
O'Mara was glad to have kept Stanford's ball rolling
