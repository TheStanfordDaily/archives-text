# Menâ€™s swimming defeats Michigan
## 
### Casey Harmond Contributing writer 
In its biggest meet of the year thus far, the Stan
ford men's swim team dominated Michigan Friday at
deGuerre Pool 139-104.
The day's beautiful weather, along with the pres
ence of many fans and the entertainment of the Stan
ford Band, created an energized atmosphere in which
Stanford's impressive depth and outstanding individ
ual performances overcame a Wolverine squad that
boasted four Olympians.
The depth of the Stanford team was immediately
shown in the first event, the 400-yard medley relay,
in which the Stanford A and B teams finished first
and second, ahead of Michigan's A team at third.
Both of Stanford's leadoff swimmers, sophomores
Tate Blahnik and Dan Schultz, got a split under 50
seconds in the 100-yard backstroke leg, an impressive
showing of speed after coming off three weeks of hard
training. The final times for the Stanford A and B
relay teams (3:17.9 and 3:21.8, respectively) place
among the top 12 times in the NCAA this year.
The momentum of the first relay was built upon by
Stanford's distance specialists in the very next event,
the 1,000-yard freestyle. Again it was a one-two finish
for the Cardinal, as senior Kevin Radvany's winning
time of 9:06.95 became the fastest performance in the
country this year by a full 2 seconds.
"After our relay teams went one-two, I wanted to
keep the momentum going," said Radvany.
Sophomore Matt O'Mara outraced Michigan swim
mers Mike McWha and Andy Potts in the last 400
yards of the race, finishing second in 9:13.72 to post
this year's eighth fastest time. And like Radvany,
O'Mara was glad to have kept Stanford's ball rolling
early in the meet.
"I was glad to go one-two with
Kevin in the 1,000," O'Mara said.
"I think the Band and all of the
fans really pumped us up."
After the 1,000, Michigan
drew its first blood of the meet,
with 1996 Olympians John Piers
ma and Tom Malchow touching
first and second over Stanford's
senior Scott Jones and sopho
more Dodd Wales in the 200-yard
freestyle. It was a very gutsy
effort by Jones, who coming off a
bout with mononucleosis, jumped
out to a lead which he held until
the last two laps of the race. How
ever, with 50 yards to go, Piersma
and Malchow inched past him for
the win.
Any excitement on the Michi
gan side of the pool deck resulting
from the 200 free was quickly dis
pelled by the first through fourth
finish by Stanford in the 50-yard
freestyle. Juniors Sabir Muham
mad (29.71), Scott Claypool
(20.85), Jed Crowe (20.9) and
Chris Olson (21.20) dominated
the corps of Michigan sprinters,
as the fastest Wolverine swimmer
in the race, Philippine Olympian
Ryan Papa, was only able to take
fifth in 21.57.
Muhammad's win in the 50
came on the first day of the Mus
lim holiday Ramadan, which he is
celebrating with a month of
dawn-to-dusk fasting.
"We were really excited, and
we knew that a one-two-three
four finish in the 50 would send a
message to the rest of the country
that we are ready to take the
national championship this
year," Muhammad said.
The top three spots in both the
1- and 3-meter diving competi
tions were taken by Michigan,
whose Josh Trexler, Brent
Wilmont and A 1 Flemming came
out ahead of Stanford freshmen
Andrew Harper and Mark Miche
lin on both boards.
In the 200-yard individual
medley, Stanford junior Tom
Wilkens, who won the event at
last summer's national long

course championships, touched
first in 1:49.03 and was followed
by Michigan senior Chris Rumley
and Stanford senior Matt Thom
son. The top-three finishers were
even at the halfway point; howev
er, Wilkens pulled out to a com
manding lead in the breaststroke
leg, followed by Thomson, who
had gained a slight advantage
over Rumley, as the three turned
at 150 yards with the freestyle leg
to go.
Wilkens' lead proved insur
mountable to the hard-charging
Rumley, who out-touched Thom
son 1:51.55 to 1:51.9.
In the 200-yard butterfly, Mal
chow, who won a silver medal in
the event in last summer's
Olympics, scored Michigan's sec
ond swimming win of the after
noon over Stanford sophomore
Matt Pierce. Malchow's time of
1:46.92 ranks him third in the
NCAA this year, but perhaps the
most entertaining performance of
the event came from Michigan's
Tom Almeda, who lost his suit at
the beginning dive and completed
the eight-lap race "baring all."
Due to the tan-lines the Michigan
squad had from spending their
three-week training trip in Perth,
Australia, Almeda's suitless swim
was easily noticed by fans, swim
mers and coaches alike.
After the dominating perfor
mance by Stanford in the 50-yard
freestyle, the day's second short
freestyle event, the 100, looked to
be another chance for Stanford's
sprinters to shine. The crew of
Claypool (45.2), Wales (46.03),
freshman Glenn Counts (46.18)
and Jones (46.9) was too much
for the Wolverines to handle, as
they finished in first through
fourth again for a Stanford win.
Backstrokers Blahnik and
Schultz, whose fast 100 times
helped the Cardinal medley
relays earlier, came out first and
third in the 200-yard backstroke
with times of 1:48.04 and 1:51.03,
respectively. Michigan's Toby
Booker was second in the race
with a time of 1:49.80.
After their one-two finish in
the 1,000-yard freestyle earlier,
Radvany and O'Mara stepped up
against Michigan's Piersma and
Rumley in the 500 free. The

Wolverine swimmers jumped out
to an early lead in the race, with
Rumley leading by mere tenths of
a second over his teammate
Piersma at the 250-yard mark.
The two continued to lead, with
Piersma moving ahead by 350
yards while Radvany swam in
third position. With 100 yards to
go, Piersma and Rumley both
flipped about 3 seconds ahead of
Radvany, who came off the turn
with an enormous kick in hopes
of overtaking them.
Radvany's split of 49.8 over
the last 100 yards was enough to
run down Rumley in an exciting
finish, but Piersma held onto his
lead, finishing first in 4:26.93.
The senior, who was second in
the 1,650 at last year's NCAAs,
learned from his second-place fin
ish, though.
"I should have made my move
one lap earlier in the 500," Rad
vany said. "I probably would have
caught Piersma then."
Stanford's victory was secure
by the start of the 200-yard
breaststroke, but that didn't stop
Wilkens, sophomore Blake Hold
en and freshman Steve Ronson
from scoring another one-two
three finish for the Cardinal.
Wilkens' and Holden's times
place them currently 15th and
20th in national rankings.
In the 400-yard freestyle relay,
Stanford closed out the day with
another victory. The Stanford A
team of Olson, Jones, Counts and
Wales won in 3:03.2 over the
Michigan A team's 3:03.8.
Stanford's convincing win Fri
day pleased assistant coach Ted
Knapp, who was impressed with
his swimmers' racing ability and
looks forward to even faster times
in the future.
"We raced well today," Knapp
said. "We are coming off hard
training, and we have two guys
on antibiotics right now, and one
guy with soreness from a separat
ed shoulder. So some of our times
might have been a bit slower than
we'd expected, but they will come
around later."
Stanford's win was big, but it
will have to turn right around
and prepare for its next chal
lenge, against an equally good
Texas team Thursday.
In its biggest meet of the year thus far, the Stan

the eight-lap race "baring all."
Due to the tan-lines the Michigan
squad had from spending their
three-week training trip in Perth,
Australia, Almeda's suitless swim
was easily noticed by fans, swim
mers and coaches alike.
After the dominating perfor
mance by Stanford in the 50-yard
freestyle, the day's second short
freestyle event, the 100, looked to
be another chance for Stanford's
sprinters to shine. The crew of
Claypool (45.2), Wales (46.03),
freshman Glenn Counts (46.18)
and Jones (46.9) was too much
for the Wolverines to handle, as
they finished in first through
fourth again for a Stanford win.
Backstrokers Blahnik and
Schultz, whose fast 100 times
helped the Cardinal medley
relays earlier, came out first and
third in the 200-yard backstroke
with times of 1:48.04 and 1:51.03,
respectively. Michigan's Toby
Booker was second in the race
with a time of 1:49.80.
After their one-two finish in
the 1,000-yard freestyle earlier,
Radvany and O'Mara stepped up
against Michigan's Piersma and
Rumley in the 500 free. The

Wolverine swimmers jumped out
to an early lead in the race, with
Rumley leading by mere tenths of
a second over his teammate
Piersma at the 250-yard mark.
The two continued to lead, with
Piersma moving ahead by 350
yards while Radvany swam in
third position. With 100 yards to
go, Piersma and Rumley both
flipped about 3 seconds ahead of
Radvany, who came off the turn
with an enormous kick in hopes
of overtaking them.
Radvany's split of 49.8 over
the last 100 yards was enough to
run down Rumley in an exciting
finish, but Piersma held onto his
lead, finishing first in 4:26.93.
The senior, who was second in
the 1,650 at last year's NCAAs,
learned from his second-place fin
ish, though.
"I should have made my move
one lap earlier in the 500," Rad
vany said. "I probably would have
caught Piersma then."
Stanford's victory was secure
by the start of the 200-yard
breaststroke, but that didn't stop
Wilkens, sophomore Blake Hold
en and freshman Steve Ronson
from scoring another one-two
three finish for the Cardinal.
Wilkens' and Holden's times
place them currently 15th and
20th in national rankings.
In the 400-yard freestyle relay,
Stanford closed out the day with
another victory. The Stanford A
team of Olson, Jones, Counts and
Wales won in 3:03.2 over the
Michigan A team's 3:03.8.
Stanford's convincing win Fri
day pleased assistant coach Ted
Knapp, who was impressed with
his swimmers' racing ability and
looks forward to even faster times
in the future.
"We raced well today," Knapp
said. "We are coming off hard
training, and we have two guys
on antibiotics right now, and one
guy with soreness from a separat
ed shoulder. So some of our times
might have been a bit slower than
we'd expected, but they will come
around later."
Stanford's win was big, but it
will have to turn right around
and prepare for its next chal
lenge, against an equally good
Texas team Thursday.
In its biggest meet of the year thus far, the Stan
ford men's swim team dominated Michigan Friday at
deGuerre Pool 139-104.
The day's beautiful weather, along with the pres
ence of many fans and the entertainment of the Stan
ford Band, created an energized atmosphere in which
Stanford's impressive depth and outstanding individ
ual performances overcame a Wolverine squad that
boasted four Olympians.
The depth of the Stanford team was immediately
shown in the first event, the 400-yard medley relay,
in which the Stanford A and B teams finished first
and second, ahead of Michigan's A team at third.
Both of Stanford's leadoff swimmers, sophomores
Tate Blahnik and Dan Schultz, got a split under 50
seconds in the 100-yard backstroke leg, an impressive
showing of speed after coming off three weeks of hard
training. The final times for the Stanford A and B
relay teams (3:17.9 and 3:21.8, respectively) place
among the top 12 times in the NCAA this year.
The momentum of the first relay was built upon by
Stanford's distance specialists in the very next event,
the 1,000-yard freestyle. Again it was a one-two finish
for the Cardinal, as senior Kevin Radvany's winning
time of 9:06.95 became the fastest performance in the
country this year by a full 2 seconds.
"After our relay teams went one-two, I wanted to
keep the momentum going," said Radvany.
Sophomore Matt O'Mara outraced Michigan swim
mers Mike McWha and Andy Potts in the last 400
yards of the race, finishing second in 9:13.72 to post
this year's eighth fastest time. And like Radvany,
O'Mara was glad to have kept Stanford's ball rolling
early in the meet.
"I was glad to go one-two with
Kevin in the 1,000," O'Mara said.
"I think the Band and all of the
fans really pumped us up."
After the 1,000, Michigan
drew its first blood of the meet,
with 1996 Olympians John Piers
ma and Tom Malchow touching
first and second over Stanford's
senior Scott Jones and sopho
more Dodd Wales in the 200-yard
freestyle. It was a very gutsy
effort by Jones, who coming off a
bout with mononucleosis, jumped
out to a lead which he held until
the last two laps of the race. How
ever, with 50 yards to go, Piersma
and Malchow inched past him for
the win.
Any excitement on the Michi
gan side of the pool deck resulting
from the 200 free was quickly dis
pelled by the first through fourth
finish by Stanford in the 50-yard
freestyle. Juniors Sabir Muham
mad (29.71), Scott Claypool
(20.85), Jed Crowe (20.9) and
Chris Olson (21.20) dominated
the corps of Michigan sprinters,
as the fastest Wolverine swimmer
in the race, Philippine Olympian
Ryan Papa, was only able to take
fifth in 21.57.
Muhammad's win in the 50
came on the first day of the Mus
lim holiday Ramadan, which he is
celebrating with a month of
dawn-to-dusk fasting.
"We were really excited, and
we knew that a one-two-three
four finish in the 50 would send a
message to the rest of the country
that we are ready to take the
national championship this
year," Muhammad said.
The top three spots in both the
1- and 3-meter diving competi
tions were taken by Michigan,
whose Josh Trexler, Brent
Wilmont and A 1 Flemming came
out ahead of Stanford freshmen
Andrew Harper and Mark Miche
lin on both boards.
In the 200-yard individual
medley, Stanford junior Tom
Wilkens, who won the event at
last summer's national long

course championships, touched
first in 1:49.03 and was followed
by Michigan senior Chris Rumley
and Stanford senior Matt Thom
son. The top-three finishers were
even at the halfway point; howev
er, Wilkens pulled out to a com
manding lead in the breaststroke
leg, followed by Thomson, who
had gained a slight advantage
over Rumley, as the three turned
at 150 yards with the freestyle leg
to go.
Wilkens' lead proved insur
mountable to the hard-charging
Rumley, who out-touched Thom
son 1:51.55 to 1:51.9.
In the 200-yard butterfly, Mal
chow, who won a silver medal in
the event in last summer's
Olympics, scored Michigan's sec
ond swimming win of the after
noon over Stanford sophomore
Matt Pierce. Malchow's time of
1:46.92 ranks him third in the
NCAA this year, but perhaps the
most entertaining performance of
the event came from Michigan's
Tom Almeda, who lost his suit at
the beginning dive and completed
the eight-lap race "baring all."
Due to the tan-lines the Michigan
squad had from spending their
three-week training trip in Perth,
Australia, Almeda's suitless swim
