# Women's hoops avoids near-upset
## Starbird scores 40 points in a 77-76 win over USC 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES — A great
writer once said that there is no
future and there is no present;
there is only the past over and
over now.
True to form, senior guard
Kate Starbird scored 40 points
(the third most in school history)
yesterday afternoon against the
same USC Trojan basketball
squad that she burned for 44
points exactly one year agp
today. And the third-ranked
Stanford women's basketball
team (16-1, 4-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) needed every single
point, eking out a 77-76 victory
over the Women of Troy (9-4, 3-
1) in a battle for first place in the
Pac-10.
However, with everyone
expecting Starbird to take the
shot, it was senior guard
Charmin Smith (15 points, eight
rebounds, six assists — all sea
son highs) who took charge at
the conclusion of the game, scor
ing on a driving layup over senior
center (and leading conference
shot-blocker) Michelle Campbell
with 9.4 seconds to go. A runner
by senior forward Tina Thomp
son, who led the Trojans with 25
points, fell short at the buzzer,
and the Cardinal hung on for its
31st consecutive conference vic
tory.
"I am very proud of how our
team accepted the challenge of
playing without two starters,"
said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "USC is a very tal
ented team. It is obvious that
they are talented and very athlet
ic as they played very well."
With VanDerveer losing two
fifths of her starting lineup Fri
day due to injury, it was Smith
who was running the offense in
place of senior guard Jamila

Wideman while freshman
Christina Batastini got her first
career start at the other guard
position. The game started off
slowly, as USC held only a 10-8
lead 8 minutes into the game,
with Thompson scoring seven of
those. The Stanford attack was
more diverse, as Starbird nailed
a three, Smith completed a
three-point play and junior for
ward Olympia Scott scored on a
short jumper.
The deficit got as big as seven
before the Cardinal regrouped,
catching the Women of Troy at
27-27 on another Starbird three
with 1:31 to go. Smith closed the
first half by taking a pass from
Starbird and hitting a three to
give Stanford only its fourth lead
of the half and going into the
locker room up 33-31.
Despite USC shooting an
erratic 9-for-29 from the field,
the Trojans stayed in the game
by nailing four threes and forc
ing 12 first-half turnovers, show
ing that Stanford sorely needed
Wideman's services. In the battle
between all-conference stal
warts, Starbird had 14 points
while Thompson led her team
with 12 points and four
rebounds.
The duel was just warming
up.
Over the next 8 minutes, Star
bird took over the game like only
so few have in the past. It started
with a 12-foot baseline jumper
that regained the lead for the
Cardinal after Thompson com
pleted a three-point play 26 sec
onds into the second half. The
senior AU-American nailed a
three from the right corner and a
14-footer on consecutive posses
sions. Feeling it now, Starbird
proceeded to score 14 consecu
tive points from everywhere on
the court to stake her team to a
59-50 lead with 12:16 to go, cap

ping off 8 brilliant minutes of
breathtaking basketball in which
she scored 21 points.
"Kate really impressed me
today, and I'm not easily
impressed," VanDerveer said.
"I've seen some really good play
ers, and she played like an All-
American today."
Amazingly, the Women of
Troy were able to bounce back
with a 12-4 run that knotted

matters at 62-62 with 8:15 left.
Unfortunately for USC, on the
next possession, Wideman (who
entered 3 minutes earlier for the
first time) drew Thompson's
fourth personal foul, forcing Tro
jan head coach Fred Williams to
sit her out.
Wideman's two free throws
