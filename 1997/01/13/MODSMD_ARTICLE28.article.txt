# Women's hoops avoids near-upset
## Starbird scores 40 points in a 77-76 win over USC 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES — A great
writer once said that there is no
future and there is no present;
there is only the past over and
over now.
True to form, senior guard
Kate Starbird scored 40 points
(the third most in school history)
yesterday afternoon against the
same USC Trojan basketball
squad that she burned for 44
points exactly one year agp
today. And the third-ranked
Stanford women's basketball
team (16-1, 4-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) needed every single
point, eking out a 77-76 victory
over the Women of Troy (9-4, 3-
1) in a battle for first place in the
Pac-10.
However, with everyone
expecting Starbird to take the
shot, it was senior guard
Charmin Smith (15 points, eight
rebounds, six assists — all sea
son highs) who took charge at
the conclusion of the game, scor
ing on a driving layup over senior
center (and leading conference
shot-blocker) Michelle Campbell
with 9.4 seconds to go. A runner
by senior forward Tina Thomp
son, who led the Trojans with 25
points, fell short at the buzzer,
and the Cardinal hung on for its
31st consecutive conference vic
tory.
"I am very proud of how our
team accepted the challenge of
playing without two starters,"
said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "USC is a very tal
ented team. It is obvious that
they are talented and very athlet
ic as they played very well."
With VanDerveer losing two
fifths of her starting lineup Fri
day due to injury, it was Smith
who was running the offense in
place of senior guard Jamila

Wideman while freshman
Christina Batastini got her first
career start at the other guard
position. The game started off
slowly, as USC held only a 10-8
lead 8 minutes into the game,
with Thompson scoring seven of
those. The Stanford attack was
more diverse, as Starbird nailed
a three, Smith completed a
three-point play and junior for
ward Olympia Scott scored on a
short jumper.
The deficit got as big as seven
before the Cardinal regrouped,
catching the Women of Troy at
27-27 on another Starbird three
with 1:31 to go. Smith closed the
first half by taking a pass from
Starbird and hitting a three to
give Stanford only its fourth lead
of the half and going into the
locker room up 33-31.
Despite USC shooting an
erratic 9-for-29 from the field,
the Trojans stayed in the game
by nailing four threes and forc
ing 12 first-half turnovers, show
ing that Stanford sorely needed
Wideman's services. In the battle
between all-conference stal
warts, Starbird had 14 points
while Thompson led her team
with 12 points and four
rebounds.
The duel was just warming
up.
Over the next 8 minutes, Star
bird took over the game like only
so few have in the past. It started
with a 12-foot baseline jumper
that regained the lead for the
Cardinal after Thompson com
pleted a three-point play 26 sec
onds into the second half. The
senior AU-American nailed a
three from the right corner and a
14-footer on consecutive posses
sions. Feeling it now, Starbird
proceeded to score 14 consecu
tive points from everywhere on
the court to stake her team to a
59-50 lead with 12:16 to go, cap

ping off 8 brilliant minutes of
breathtaking basketball in which
she scored 21 points.
"Kate really impressed me
today, and I'm not easily
impressed," VanDerveer said.
"I've seen some really good play
ers, and she played like an All-
American today."
Amazingly, the Women of
Troy were able to bounce back
with a 12-4 run that knotted

matters at 62-62 with 8:15 left.
Unfortunately for USC, on the
next possession, Wideman (who
entered 3 minutes earlier for the
first time) drew Thompson's
fourth personal foul, forcing Tro
jan head coach Fred Williams to
sit her out.

stretched the lead to eight
points. Even though the senior
point guard had three points and
no assists, she also had no
turnovers. Furthermore, seeing
her dribble in traffic without as
much as a slight limp may have
been the emotional boost that
pulled the team through in a
rowdy atmosphere in a critical
game.
Trailing 73-67 at the 3-
minute mark, the Women of
Troy made a last-gasp effort —
and almost pulled off a great
upset. Two free throws and a
trey by sophomore guard Kristin
Clark slashed the deficit to one
with 1:45 left. Starbird extended
the lead to three with her 39th
and 40th points this time on a
driving layup.
Thompson answered in kind,
and the Stanford lead was one
again. After a missed shot by the
Cardinal, the Trojans lobbed the
ball down low to Campbell, who
got behind junior Naomi Muli
tauaopele for the easy layin with
22.8 seconds left and a 76-75
lead. It seemed like Thompson's
team would have the last laugh,
and Starbird's remarkable per
formance would go for naught.
The game was now in Smith's
hands. Moving down the left

side, she moved around a terrific
high pick and drove down the
lane and floated it up over Camp
bell's outstretched arm, off the
glass and in for the winning
points. After Thompson's failed

attempt down at the other end,
Stanford escaped.
"I flashed to the left and got
the ball," Thompson said of the
missed shot. "I took it to the
middle and just tried to score. I
shot it like I would shoot any
shot; this one was just a bit
short."
Starbird's brilliant perfor
mance capped the greatest three
game scoring performance in
Stanford's history with 104
points. She also has terrorized
the Trojans with 113 points in
the last three contests. For the
weekend, Starbird made 23 of 37
field goal attempts for a scintil
lating 62 percent while missing
only three of 17 free throws.
"I don't think I've ever felt
that way [shooting] before,"
Starbird said. "Even in that
game against USC where I had
44, it didn't feel like that. In that
game we were up by a lot and
this time, it was more of a pres
sure situation."
