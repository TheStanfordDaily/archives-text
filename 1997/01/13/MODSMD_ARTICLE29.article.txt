# No. 21 men overcome early trouble with the Trojans

Entering Saturday afternoon's Pacif
ic 10 Conference showdown against
USC, Stanford men's basketball coach
Mike Montgomery was a bit concerned,
and he had reason to be. Coming off an
emotional 48-point annihilation of
UCLA the previous Thursday night, the
21st-ranked Cardinal (10-2 overall, 3-1
Pac-10) struggled in the first half but
made enough of a second-half run to top
the Trojans (7-5, 2-2) convincingly 85-
70 in front of a Maples Pavilion crowd of
7,305.
"I had somewhat anticipated this a
little bit going into the week," Mont
gomery said. "I just did not have a real
good feeling about playing SC."
The Trojans, packing a roster full of
transfers, presented some difficulties
for Stanford in the first half USC start
ed three junior college transfers and had
Kentucky transfer senior guard Rodrick
Rhodes coming off the bench. Rhodes,
last week's Pac-10 player of the week,
saw just 12 minutes of playing time due
to a sprained knee.
"They have a lot of new people,"
Montgomery said. "They are very ath

playing hard, and I was just real worried
about the game.
"They shot the ball very well in the
first half from three. They took us out of
our defense and disrupted our offense
with their defensive quickness. We just
had a hard time getting the ball into the
offense on a consistent basis."
After knocking down a school record
15 three-pointers against UCLA, the
Cardinal found itself this time on the
wrong end of a three-point shooting bar
rage. The Trojans drained a scintillating
71.4 percent of their treys in the open
ing half converting on 5-of-7 attempts
from behind the arc.
Meanwhile, Stanford's snipers, enter
ing the contest shooting a torrid 45.3
percent from downtown, had a difficult
time finding their range. The Cardinal
made just 2-of-ll shots in the first half
from deep, and with big man sophomore
center Tim Young strapped with two
early fouls — Young played just 10 min
utes in the opening period — that
spelled trouble for Stanford.
"We played a good first half." said
USC coach Henry Bibbv. "We did some

a win over USC despite a slow start.
