# No. 21 men overcome early trouble with the Trojans
## 
### Dan Kao Staff writer 
Entering Saturday afternoon's Pacif
ic 10 Conference showdown against
USC, Stanford men's basketball coach
Mike Montgomery was a bit concerned,
and he had reason to be. Coming off an
emotional 48-point annihilation of
UCLA the previous Thursday night, the
21st-ranked Cardinal (10-2 overall, 3-1
Pac-10) struggled in the first half but
made enough of a second-half run to top
the Trojans (7-5, 2-2) convincingly 85-
70 in front of a Maples Pavilion crowd of
7,305.
"I had somewhat anticipated this a
little bit going into the week," Mont
gomery said. "I just did not have a real
good feeling about playing SC."
The Trojans, packing a roster full of
transfers, presented some difficulties
for Stanford in the first half USC start
ed three junior college transfers and had
Kentucky transfer senior guard Rodrick
Rhodes coming off the bench. Rhodes,
last week's Pac-10 player of the week,
saw just 12 minutes of playing time due
to a sprained knee.
"They have a lot of new people,"
Montgomery said. "They are very ath

letic. They are very hungry. They are
playing hard, and I was just real worried
about the game.
"They shot the ball very well in the
first half from three. They took us out of
our defense and disrupted our offense
with their defensive quickness. We just
had a hard time getting the ball into the
offense on a consistent basis."
After knocking down a school record
15 three-pointers against UCLA, the
Cardinal found itself this time on the
wrong end of a three-point shooting bar
rage. The Trojans drained a scintillating
71.4 percent of their treys in the open
ing half converting on 5-of-7 attempts
from behind the arc.
Meanwhile, Stanford's snipers, enter
ing the contest shooting a torrid 45.3
percent from downtown, had a difficult
time finding their range. The Cardinal
made just 2-of-ll shots in the first half
from deep, and with big man sophomore
center Tim Young strapped with two
early fouls — Young played just 10 min
utes in the opening period — that
spelled trouble for Stanford.
"We played a good first half." said
USC coach Henry Bibbv. "We did some

a win over USC despite a slow start.
things we wanted to do. We got
to the basket. We hit some jump
shots. We executed some plays."
The Cardinal, however, was
able to counter with something
old and something new. With
Stanford struggling in the first
period, All-American senior
guard Brevin Knight took it
upon himself to keep the Cardi
nal in the game. Knight, who fin
ished with a season-high 27
points to go along with five
assists and five steals, was able
to disrupt USC's offense and
penetrate the Trojan defense the
entire game.
"With the type of defense they
play, they allow you to penetrate
and make plays," Knight said.

"They press you up front and
pretty much invite you to go to
the basket and create things.
That was there tonight, and I
took that opportunity.
"We weren't all clicking
together, and when that's hap
pening I have to step up and be
more offensive-minded to be
sure we don't get too far behind
and to make sure the other guys
know that I'm there to help as
much as possible."
After falling behind by six
with about 5 minutes to play in
the opening half, Knight scored
eight of the Cardinal's last 11
points of the period to pull Stan
ford within 38-37 at halftime.
"Brevin Knight is the best
point guard in the country, and I
think it showed by the way he
took control of the basketball
game," said Bibby. "He con
trolled it from the beginning to

the end. Big, big-time player."
A freshman guard by the
name of David Moseley scored
the other three points in that late
first-half Cardinal surge. With all
the new faces on USC's squad,
Montgomery found that he had
the most important wild card in
the contest. While his fellow
teammates drew nothing but the
clang of iron from three-point
range, Moseley had five for the
game — Stanford's entire three
point output — and two critical
ones in the first half to go along
with a nifty layin off an offensive
rebound and two free throws.
"Fortunately, we found Dave
Moseley off the bench who came
in and shot the ball very well,"
Montgomery said. "He kind of
saved our bacon there with 10
first-half points."
"I just took the opportunity
that was given to me," Moseley

said. "Someone on the team
wasn't having as good a game as
he usually plays, and I just felt
like I had to step it up.
"I don't know if it was really a
cold thing or if USC was playing
great defense. They were playing
their butts off. I felt that they
played a lot harder than UCLA did.
You have to give them credit for us
not shooting as well as we did."
After surviving a tough first
half, Stanford roared out with a
vengeance in the game's second
period. With 15:10 to go in the
final period and a tie score of 49-
49, the Cardinal went on a 17-4
run. Stanford was able to assert
its inside game more with
Young. The center had 15 sec
ond-half points, including two
crowd-rousing dunks and a tip
in, to finish with 21 points for
the game, along with five
rebounds and two blocks.

"To go in down one given the
first half, I felt we were very fortu
nate," Montgomery said. "And we
were able to take it from there and
play a pretty good second half."
In addition, Moseley contin
ued to be hot, and Knight contin
ued to penetrate and dominate.
After shooting just 38.2 percent
from the field in the first half,
the Cardinal scorched the nets
shooting at a 65.2-percent clip in
the second half while holding
USC to 40.6-percent second-half
field goal shooting.
"They took us out of our
offense in the second half,"
Bibby said. "They put more pres
sure on us. We were not able to
get the shots we wanted to get.
They were getting easy shots,
and we were struggling to get
shots. That's the difference in
the game when a lot of teams can
shoot layups and you have a guy

like Moseley knocking down
those open shots."
The second-half run allowed
the Cardinal to seize a lead that it
never relinquished. While the
methods were slightly different
against the Trojans than the Bru
ins, the results proved to be the
same. There was no early domi
nance and the trifectas were not
falling, but the victory still came.
"We know USC is a capable
team," Knight said. "A team
with a lot of guys that can hurt
you in a lot of areas, so we want
ed to make sure we had the same
intensity as we did against
UCLA. I think our intensity was
there, but the shots just weren't
falling. And when the shots
aren't falling, you just have to
stick with it and sooner or later
you know you'll get a run. We
got our run, and we held onto
it."

Kentucky transfer senior guard Rodrick
Rhodes coming off the bench. Rhodes,
last week's Pac-10 player of the week,
saw just 12 minutes of playing time due
to a sprained knee.
"They have a lot of new people,"
Montgomery said. "They are very ath

letic. They are very hungry. They are
playing hard, and I was just real worried
about the game.
"They shot the ball very well in the
first half from three. They took us out of
our defense and disrupted our offense
with their defensive quickness. We just
had a hard time getting the ball into the
offense on a consistent basis."
After knocking down a school record
15 three-pointers against UCLA, the
Cardinal found itself this time on the
wrong end of a three-point shooting bar
rage. The Trojans drained a scintillating
71.4 percent of their treys in the open
ing half converting on 5-of-7 attempts
from behind the arc.
Meanwhile, Stanford's snipers, enter
ing the contest shooting a torrid 45.3
percent from downtown, had a difficult
time finding their range. The Cardinal
made just 2-of-ll shots in the first half
from deep, and with big man sophomore
center Tim Young strapped with two
early fouls — Young played just 10 min
utes in the opening period — that
spelled trouble for Stanford.
"We played a good first half." said
USC coach Henry Bibbv. "We did some

things we wanted to do. We got
to the basket. We hit some jump
shots. We executed some plays."
The Cardinal, however, was
able to counter with something
old and something new. With
Stanford struggling in the first
period, All-American senior
guard Brevin Knight took it
upon himself to keep the Cardi
nal in the game. Knight, who fin
ished with a season-high 27
points to go along with five
assists and five steals, was able
to disrupt USC's offense and
penetrate the Trojan defense the
entire game.
"With the type of defense they
play, they allow you to penetrate
and make plays," Knight said.

"They press you up front and
pretty much invite you to go to
the basket and create things.
That was there tonight, and I
took that opportunity.
"We weren't all clicking
together, and when that's hap
pening I have to step up and be
more offensive-minded to be
sure we don't get too far behind
and to make sure the other guys
know that I'm there to help as
much as possible."
After falling behind by six
with about 5 minutes to play in
the opening half, Knight scored
eight of the Cardinal's last 11
points of the period to pull Stan
ford within 38-37 at halftime.
"Brevin Knight is the best
point guard in the country, and I
think it showed by the way he
took control of the basketball
game," said Bibby. "He con
trolled it from the beginning to

the end. Big, big-time player."
A freshman guard by the
name of David Moseley scored
the other three points in that late
first-half Cardinal surge. With all
the new faces on USC's squad,
Montgomery found that he had
the most important wild card in
the contest. While his fellow
teammates drew nothing but the
clang of iron from three-point
range, Moseley had five for the
game — Stanford's entire three
point output — and two critical
ones in the first half to go along
with a nifty layin off an offensive
rebound and two free throws.
"Fortunately, we found Dave
Moseley off the bench who came
in and shot the ball very well,"
Montgomery said. "He kind of
saved our bacon there with 10
first-half points."
"I just took the opportunity
that was given to me," Moseley

said. "Someone on the team
wasn't having as good a game as
he usually plays, and I just felt
like I had to step it up.
"I don't know if it was really a
cold thing or if USC was playing
great defense. They were playing
their butts off. I felt that they
played a lot harder than UCLA did.
You have to give them credit for us
not shooting as well as we did."
After surviving a tough first
half, Stanford roared out with a
vengeance in the game's second
period. With 15:10 to go in the
final period and a tie score of 49-
49, the Cardinal went on a 17-4
run. Stanford was able to assert
its inside game more with
Young. The center had 15 sec
ond-half points, including two
crowd-rousing dunks and a tip
in, to finish with 21 points for
the game, along with five
rebounds and two blocks.

"To go in down one given the
first half, I felt we were very fortu
nate," Montgomery said. "And we
were able to take it from there and
play a pretty good second half."
In addition, Moseley contin
ued to be hot, and Knight contin
ued to penetrate and dominate.
After shooting just 38.2 percent
from the field in the first half,
the Cardinal scorched the nets
shooting at a 65.2-percent clip in
the second half while holding
USC to 40.6-percent second-half
field goal shooting.
"They took us out of our
offense in the second half,"
Bibby said. "They put more pres
sure on us. We were not able to
get the shots we wanted to get.
They were getting easy shots,
and we were struggling to get
shots. That's the difference in
the game when a lot of teams can
shoot layups and you have a guy

like Moseley knocking down
those open shots."
The second-half run allowed
the Cardinal to seize a lead that it
never relinquished. While the
methods were slightly different
against the Trojans than the Bru
ins, the results proved to be the
same. There was no early domi
nance and the trifectas were not
falling, but the victory still came.
"We know USC is a capable
team," Knight said. "A team
with a lot of guys that can hurt
you in a lot of areas, so we want
ed to make sure we had the same
intensity as we did against
UCLA. I think our intensity was
there, but the shots just weren't
falling. And when the shots
aren't falling, you just have to
stick with it and sooner or later
you know you'll get a run. We
got our run, and we held onto
it."
