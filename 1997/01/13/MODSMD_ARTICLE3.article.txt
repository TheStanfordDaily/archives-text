Denni Woodward has agreed to
serve as interim director of the
American Indian Program Office
until a new permanent director is
chosen, Dean of Students Marc
Wais announced last week.
Woodward, currently assistant
director of the program, arrived at
Stanford in 1981 after working
with several federally funded Na
tive American organizations. A
member of the Mescalero Apache
tribe in New Mexico, Woodward
began working to further the
causc of Native Americans after
graduating from San Jose State
University with a degree in Native

American art.
"Stanford is very fortunate to
have a staff member of Denni's
caliber in terms of skills, talents
and experience to call upon to as
sume this important leadership
position during this transition pe
riod," Wais said
"I've been working in Ameri
can Indian programs for many
years," Woodward said. "I am ex
tremely proud to be associated
with this student body. It is truly
inspiring."
The Native American commu
nity at Stanford includes about
200 students and 60 staff workers.
Woodward said she wants to be an
advocate who will work with the
Native American community and
be a liaison between them and the
University.
She said education is an impor
tant tool for the survival and rep
resentation of Native Americans.
"To be educated is important not
only to feed our souls. We need to
be familiar with not only our own
native culture but with a variety of
different areas," she said.
Woodward believes that Stan
ford plays a crucial role in the Na
tive American community nation
wide. Stanford ranks with Dart
mouth as one of the top universi
ties in recruitment of Native
Americans.
Woodward said that although
the Native American population
at Stanford is relatively small, Na
tive American graduates often
find themselves in very influential
positions in a variety of different
fields.
"Because the Indian tribes are
sovereign nations, we deal a lot
with the federal government,"

Woodward said. "Many of our
graduates work on a federal level.
The network is a very tight and
very small one. You'll find a lot of
Stanford people within it."
Woodward replaces Benny
Shendo, who vacated the position
last month, until a permanent
head is found. Shendo, after hold
ing the position for two years, cited
personal reasons for leaving Stan
ford and returning to his native
state of New Mexico.
Woodward worked closely with
Shendo to facilitate Native Ameri
can students transition to Stan
ford by offering both academic and
social support.
"Shendo brought a whole new
perspective to the directorship,"
said Woodward. "He brought it a
different leadership style and dif
ferent visions."
"Shendo was really dedicated in
the community," said junior
Tanya Lukin. "We will miss him
and his leadership."
"I think Woodward was really
supportive of Benny," Lukin con
tinued. "She has been a constant in
the Native community for so long.
Woodward is the type of person
that gets the job done."
Since opening in 1988, the pro

gram's primary objective has been
the successful retention and grad
uation of Native American stu
dents at Stanford. It provides sup
port services for students through
personal and academic counseling.
"I think my goal would be to
focus on the future of the pro
gram," Woodward said. "This is
the perfect time to assess what we
do and how we do it, to circle back
and to ask everyone what they
want or need from this program, to
ask students what services they
need, to assess what we do and to
work to meet those needs."
Asst. English Prof. Robert War
rior will chair the search commit
tee responsible for hiring a perma
nent director of the program. The
committee will consist of students,
alumni, faculty and staff. Wood
ward will also hold a post on the
committee.
Wais said he hopes the new di
rector will begin his or her tenure
at Stanford before the start of the
1997 fall quarter.
"I consider this to be a very im
portant position at the Universi
ty," said Wais. "We will be con
ducting a national search to iden
tify and recruit to campus the very
best and brightest in the country."
