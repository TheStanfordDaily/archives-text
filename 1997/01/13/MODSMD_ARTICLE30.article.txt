# Women's swimming drowns the Wolverines
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
Despite posting slower times than Stanford
fans are used to, the top-ranked women's swim
ming and diving team destroyed No. 5 Michigan
Saturday, 198-96.
Stanford (3-0) jumped all over the Wolverines
(4-1), winning the first four events to take a
commanding 62-12 lead. And even with that
lead, the Cardinal did not let up, as the squad
finished first through third in five events, and
Michigan only won one race.
"I was real pleased with our team's racing
effort," said Stanford head coach Richard Quick.
"The times weren't as good as I would have liked
them to be, but I think we competed real well
and raced real well."
Leading the way for the Cardinal, was senior
Kerry O'Hanlon, who swept the backstroke
events against Michigan. She first won the 100-
yard backstroke in a time of 56.3 seconds and
then won the 200-yard back in 2:01.2.
"I think that is one of the most significant
improvements we've had on our team, that
[O'Hanlon] has stepped it up to another level,"
Quick said. "It's really going to help us at the
NCAA Championships if she can continue that
trend."
Following the meet, O'Hanlon, who has bat
tled it\jury throughout her career, felt a sense of
relief and accomplishment when describing the
sweep.

Freshman Courtney Llschke swims the 500-yard freestyle in an overwhelming defeat of No. 5 Michigan.
"I was really pleased to be
able to do that because I have
been trying to overcome a lot of
injuries," O'Hanlon said. "I went
into the meet thinking I wanted
to get this cut and I wanted to do
this time, and after the first
relay, I just wanted to race and
hopefully win some events and
get some points."
Junior Amy Oberhelman, who
finished third in the 1,650-yard
freestyle at NCAAs last year,
also turned in strong races, win
ning both the 500-yard free
(4:52.10) and the 1,000-yard free
(4:52.10). Her strong perfor
mance gives Quick a reason to
believe she can improve on her
third-place NCAA finish last
vear.

"I think the fact that she is
swimming this fast during the
year is a good sign that she can
improve quite a bit at the NCAA
championships," he said.
Stanford's dominance against
the Wolverines, the team
believes, is a reflection upon the
hard training the team has
endured in the last two months.
"I think we have made drastic
improvements as far as training
goes that aren't going to show
until Pac-lOs and NCAAs,"
O'Hanlon said. "So it's exciting
to know that we have that
behind us even though it won't
show itself immediately."
Another factor in the team's
success, according to senior co
captain Michelle Jesperson, is
how the team thrives under
stressful and tiring portions of
the season.
"I think the important thing
for us is to keep competing even

though we are training really
hard right now," Jesperson said.
"Michigan's coach came up to a
group of us after the meet and
said, 'We just can't compete
with you guys because we are too
broken down right now.' The
thing is, we are too. So it's
important for us to keep compet
ing so well when we are tired."
Also posting victories for the
Cardinal were freshmen Cather
ine Fox and Gabrielle Rose in the
100- and 200-yard free, junior
Michelle Collins in the 200-yard
butterfly, senior Claudia Franco
in the 50-yard free and sopho
mores Elin Austevoll and Alison
Fealey, in the 200-yard breast
sroke and 400-yard individual
medley, respectively.
In addition, Stanford swept
the diving competition on Satur
day, as freshman Carissa Zenori
ni won both the 1- and 3-meter
diving events.
