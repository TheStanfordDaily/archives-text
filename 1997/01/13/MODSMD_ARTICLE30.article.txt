Despite posting slower times than Stanford
fans are used to, the top-ranked women's swim
ming and diving team destroyed No. 5 Michigan
Saturday, 198-96.
Stanford (3-0) jumped all over the Wolverines
(4-1), winning the first four events to take a
commanding 62-12 lead. And even with that
lead, the Cardinal did not let up, as the squad
finished first through third in five events, and
Michigan only won one race.
"I was real pleased with our team's racing
effort," said Stanford head coach Richard Quick.
"The times weren't as good as I would have liked
them to be, but I think we competed real well
and raced real well."
Leading the way for the Cardinal, was senior
Kerry O'Hanlon, who swept the backstroke
events against Michigan. She first won the 100-
yard backstroke in a time of 56.3 seconds and
then won the 200-yard back in 2:01.2.
"I think that is one of the most significant
improvements we've had on our team, that
[O'Hanlon] has stepped it up to another level,"
Quick said. "It's really going to help us at the
NCAA Championships if she can continue that
trend."
Following the meet, O'Hanlon, who has bat
tled it\jury throughout her career, felt a sense of
relief and accomplishment when describing the
sweep.
