# Volleyball places ninth in tourney
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
Although nobody on the Stan
ford men's volleyball team was
pleased to return home from the
33rd annual UC-Santa Barbara
Collegiate Invitational with a
ninth-place finish in the 24-team
field, both players and coaches feel
the result does not serve as an
indication of the manner in which
the rest of the season will
progress.
The Cardinal won five of the
eight matches it played, recording
victories over Sacramento State,
Westmont, Brigham Young, Cal
State-Northridge and Pacific. The
squad lost matches to UC-Irvine,
the University of Calgary and Indi
ana-Purdue-Fort Wayne. All three
losses came in matches that went
into the third and final game. Both
the Calgary and IPFW matches
saw Stanford lose 15-13 in the
final game.
Despite dominating play at the
net from an attacking and block
ing standpoint, head coach Ruben
Nieves cited the team's service
game, as well as its ability to
receive serves, as the two areas

where the most improvement is
needed.
"The net game has been the
strength of this team," Nieves
said. "Other teams can match us
in receiving serve as well as
defense. Also, there are better
serving teams, so we need to work
on those areas."
The format of the tournament
— two grueling days in which the
squad would play eight matches —
forced Nieves to make a decision
regarding the amount of action his
top players would see.
After seeing that senior All-
American outside hitters Matt
Fuerbringer and Mike Lambert,
also an Olympian, agreed with his
plan to use them, along with the
rest of the team's starters sparing
ly, Nieves realized the team might
suffer an upset at the hands of an
inferior team.
Although the team's overall
record was not terribly impressive,
Nieves feels that its victory over
BYU, the eventual tournament
champion, was particularly telling.
Both teams played its starters
throughout the match, and Stan
ford won in the third game giving
the Cougars their only loss in the

two-day event.
Aside from the BYU result,
Nieves cited a knee injury to
senior middleblocker Brian Moore,
a returning starter, as the most
significant event of the Cardinal's
tournament. Although the extent
of the injury has not been
revealed, Nieves fears it may be
serious.
"It was the type of accident that
makes anybody who has been
around volleyball worry about an
anterior cruciate ligament,"
Nieves said. "If it is indeed an ACL
tear, he could be lost for the sea
son. That would be a real blow."
Despite the injury, Nieves was
upbeat about the overall play of
the team. Citing the team's perfect
3-0 record when the starters were
playing, he said, "I think that we
are where we need to be, and I
think we can beat any team in that
tournament. I would have liked to
have gone 8-0 in the tournament
and have won it, but we didn't
want to sacrifice the health of our
players to do so. We lost two
matches 15-13 in the final game so
our record could have been much
better. However, in the future, I
want us to win the close ones."
