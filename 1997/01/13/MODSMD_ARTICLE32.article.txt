# Moseley proves to be too much for Trojans
## 
### Todd Bernstein Senior staff writer 
USC head coach Henry Bibby
expected Stanford to give his
team problems Saturday, he just
had no idea that freshman David
Moseley would be the biggest.
"No, not a factor at all,"
responded Bibby, when asked if
his coaching staff had scouted
Moseley prior to the game. "But
that's part of a good team when
you can have different players
that other teams don't really see
come in and play."
And play Moseley did, as he
provided the only offensive fire
power, apart from the penetra
tion of senior superstar Brevin
Knight, in the first half against
the Trojans.
Moseley "kind of saved our
bacon," said Cardinal head coach
Mike Montgomery. "They dis
rupted our offense, and we had a
hard time getting the ball in the
offense on a consistent basis.
Fortunately, we found Moseley
off the bench, who came in and
shot the ball very well."
To say that Moseley, a Las
Cruces, N.M., native, helped is a
gross understatement. With the
exception of Knight, the Cardi
nal starters came out flat
against USC, missing all but

three of their 10 field goal
attempts and all five of their
three-point attempts in the first
half.
Kris Weems, who had led the
Pacific 10 Conference in three
point shooting, had a particular
ly tough half, shooting l-of-5
from the floor, including O-for-4
from beyond the arc. Weems'
ineffectiveness paved the way
for Moseley, who responded with
10 first-half points (on 3-of-5
shooting) and three rebounds.
"All I did was take the oppor
tunity that was given to me,"
Moseley said. "Someone on the
team wasn't having as good a
game as they usually play, so I
felt that I had to step it up."
Moseley continued his strong
play in the second half, as the
emergence of sophomore Tim
Young's play in the paint opened
things up for him on the perime
ter. Moseley, who finished with
19 points, was the only Stanford
player to connect from three
point land in the entire game. He
was 5- for-8, while the rest of the
team finished an abysmal 0-for-9
shooting from way outside. And
none of it seemed to surprise his
coaches or teammates.
"David has been shooting the
ball very well, and we just felt
athletically that in this game,

with the way USC was playing,
that he might have been a better
option than someone like [fresh
man Ryan] Mendez, who has
been so good in other occasions
shooting the ball," Montgomery
said.
Even Knight knew Moseley
could put up the kind of num
bers he did against the Trojans.
"He plays really well in prac
tice and shoots like that every
day,"he said. "We just had to get
him to translate practice to game
situations and today he did that."
Ironically, Moseley felt it was
his defense, and not his shoot
ing, that gave him the confi
dence Saturday.
"I first gained my confidence
at the defensive end of the
floor," Moseley said. "My man
missed a shot, I got a rebound,
so I started to get confidence,
and I knew I would get to play
longer because it all starts on
defense."
Moseley did play solid defense
throughout the game, racking
up two steals, one block and four
defensive rebounds. Most impor
tantly, though, Moseley played
well against USC's leading scor
er Stais Boseman, who he began
defending when Knight picked
up his third foul.
"I was just hoping that I

didn't get taken to the hole,"
Moseley said. "I felt that I need
ed to make him go left because
he loves his right hand. He
caught me one time, but after
that I tried to keep him in
check."
According to Montgomery it is
not just Moseley's physical abili
ties that make him a good
defender, but it's his improving
mental skills on defense that
have also helped him to improve.
"He's got pretty long arms,"
Montgomery said. "But one of
the things that I think the fresh
men didn't understand coming
in was what kind of effort that it
takes to play defense at this
level, and both Moseley and
Mendez have gotten an awful lot
better at putting forth that
effort."
Despite the strong showing
against the Trojans, Moseley
knows that one game does not
make a season, and that he must
continue to improve if he hopes
to continue to play.
"It's a great system to be in,"
Moseley said. "If one person is
not stepping it up, you know you
are going to have your opportu
nity, but if you are not playing
up to your capabilities, you are
going to have to sit on the pine,
too."
