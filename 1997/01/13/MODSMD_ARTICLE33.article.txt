LOS ANGELES — The third-ranked
Stanford women's basketball team (15-1,
3-0 Pacific 10 Conference) experienced
Pyrrhic victory in its 74-62 win over UClj\
(7-5,1-2) Friday night in Pauley Pavilion as
senior point guard Jamila Wideman twist
ed her right ankle while junior forward
Vanessa Nygaard suffered a knee injury.
Nevertheless, senior guard Kate Star
bird's 37 points and the effective point
guard play of senior guard Charmin Smith
allowed the Cardinal to overcome sloppy
officiating and an off-shooting night to gar
ner its 30th consecutive conference victory.
"We couid never really get any flow in
our game tonight," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "The key for our
team was to play better defensively. It was
still an excellent win for the team."
It was a game of extreme runs in the
first half in Westwood as the Cardinal
scored the first six points of the game.
UCLA answered with an eight-point run to
temporarily take the lead with 14 minutes,
25 seconds to go in the first half. Over the
next 6 minutes, Stanford took charge again
by going on a 19-7 run, in great part due to
junior forward Naomi Mulitauaopele, who
scored six points in the spurt.
Then disaster struck 2 minutes later.
Wideman took the ball at the top of the key,
drove down the lane and was fouled hard.
She landed awkwardly on her right ankle
and was down for a few minutes before
limping off and being replaced by freshman
Milena Flores. The freshman guard nailed
both free throws to push the lead to 29-17.

Continuing where it left ofT, Stanford
closed the first half with a 15-4 run, capped
off by a brilliant Starbird layup while being
knocked to the floor by Bruin Carla Hous
er. Starbird nailed the free throw for her
18th point of the game and staked her team
to a 46-29 lead.
UCLA struggled from the floor, shoot
ing a meager 37 percent while missing six
free throws. Furthermore, the season-end
ing injury in November to sophomore point
guard Erica Gomez spelled 12 turnovers
and only six assists in the first half.
The woes continued for UCLA despite
the best efforts of redshirt freshman for
ward Takiyah Jackson. Jackson was the
only player on the Bruins that shot more
than 50 percent, scoring 16 second-half
points. Still, Stanford opened its lead to 20
on two free throws by Mulitauaopele with
less than 8 minutes to go.
A minute later, the injury bug bit hard
as Nygaard fell to the floor in a heap near
the left baseline as it seemed like her right
knee buckled after passing the ball. The
junior forward was replaced by Smith with
6:10 to go and the Cardinal up by 17. With
two-fifths of the starting lineup missing,
Smith provided p'eady play with her solid
rebounding (seven) and her keen running
of the point (three assists) when Flores ran
into foul trouble early in the second half.
Smith "really helped out the team," Van-
Derveer said. "It was a really good opportu
nity for the freshmen to mature and give
different people a chance to step up."
Flores teamed up with Starbird on two
possessions late in the game to ice it for the
Cardinal, first nailing a three and then a
layup for a 69-52 lead with 3:25 left.
