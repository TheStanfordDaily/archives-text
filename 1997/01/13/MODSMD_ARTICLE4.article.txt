# Trustees committee rejects progressive endowment fund

The Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility announced last week that it
would not recommend a proposed progres
sive endowment fund to the full Board of
Trustees or University President Gerhard
Casper.
Money in the proposed endowment fund,
which would exist as an alternative to the

current endowment,
would be invested only in
companies designated as
socially and environmen
tally responsible.
The SCIR, which re
viewed the proposal, said
in a memorandum that it
could not support the de
velopment of such a fund
due to economic and politi-

cal concerns.
The proposal for the fund was authored
by ASSU Vice President Nick Thompson
and his assistant, Kelly Nay lor. The pro
gressive fund was inspired by Students for
Environmental Action at Stanford's two
year campaign against corporate irresponsi
bility.
According to Linda Kimball, a staff mem
ber for both the SCIR and the University's
Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibil

ity, the establishment of such a fund would
conflict with the mandate of the Universi
ty's trustees, which is to make low-risk,
high-return investments in order to maxi
mize the University's endowment.
Investments in socially responsible com
panies are "much more volatile than cur
rent investments," Kimball said. She ex
plained that socially responsible companies
are less stable because they often are small
er and involved in new technology.

In the memorandum, the SCIR also ex
pressed concern that an alternate endow
ment fund could confuse donors and possi
bly detract from the success of the Stanford
Fund.
The SCIR argued that the proposed en
dowment fund would blur "the important
distinction between expendable and endow
ment funds." The Stanford Fund, which is


Thompson
« an annual gift-giving program that
raises money to be spent on under
graduate education, is separate
• from the endowment, which is in
vested in corporations for long-term
; financial returns.
According to Kimball, a progres
! sive endowment fund could nega
tively affect donations by asking
. donors to take a political stance.
; "The University is not about
making a political statement but
about educating people so that they
• can make their own decisions and
• choices," Kimball said.
Thompson said the progressive
fund would increase donations by
' giving donors a new, socially respon
i sible option.

A progressive endowment fund
would "hopefully address people
who would not normally give to the
University. This would be the first
fund of its kind and wou Id attract at
tention and get people excited about
giving," Thompson said.
"In the broad view of the educa
tional mission, the University can't
take a stance of neutrality," Nay lor
said. "The University has already
made a political decision to be in
volved in [socially irresponsible] cor
porations and is making a political
statement by its own inaction."
SEAS has protested investments
in PepsiCo, Texaco and Unocal
based on these companies' alleged
violations of human rights and the
environment in Burma.
According to Thompson, socially
responsible corporations can be a
safer investment because they do
not run the risk of corporate scan

dal, after which stocks may fall, as
has happened with Texaco.
Establishment of a progressive
endowment fund was part of the
campaign platform for Thompson
and ASSU President Bill Shen last
spring.
According to Shen, the SCIR has
not addressed the deeper philosoph
ical issue involved in the establish
ment of a progressive fund, which is
"the role of the University in soci
ety."
The SCIR's argument is "an ar
gument without moral context,"
Thompson said.
According to Thompson, the pos
sibility of creating a socially respon
sible endowment fund open to just
the senior class is being discussed.
However, Thompson, Shen and
Nay lor are not planning to abandon
possible University channels for a
progressive fund.
