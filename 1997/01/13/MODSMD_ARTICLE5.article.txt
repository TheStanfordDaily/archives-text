## New technique developed at Stanford identifies cause of some breast cancer 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
A new technique pioneered by
Stanford geneticists has led to a
breakthrough in identifying the
causes of some breast cancers.
The technique has wide appli
cations for studying many forms
of genetic disease.
The procedure is known as ran
dom homozygous knockout and
was invented by Genetics Prof.
Stanley Cohen and postdoctoral
fellow Limin Li. Cohen and Li
used their new method to identify
a gene that suppresses the growth
of tumors.
The researchers first reported
their new method last May in the
journal Cell. Friday's issue of the
same journal contains their find
ings regarding breast cancer.
The RHKO procedure allows
scientists to deactivate both
copies of any given gene in an ani
mal cell without knowing its func
tion. The affected cells will not
display whatever trait the sup
pressed gene governed, allowing
scientists to link the gene to the
trait.
Previously, Li explained in a
statement, methods of identifying
traits through mutation were

very laborious when dealing with
animal genes because animal cells
possess two copies of every gene,
one from each of the animal's par
ents. Li said it was "very difficult
to mutate two genes simultane
ously."
In addition, previously avail
able procedures required scien
tists to know in advance what
gene they were interested in,
whereas Cohen and Li's method
can be applied on a random basis.
The method's first success was
identifying a gene called TSG 101.
The gene serves to inhibit cells
from growing in a cancerous fash
ion: When it is absent or not func
tioning, the cells grow into tu
mors.
Cohen and Li were able to iso
late several cancerous cells in a
sample of mouse cells and found
that those were the cells whose
TSG 101 genes they had deacti
vated. By working with Genetics
Prof. Uta Francke and postdoc
toral fellow Xu Li, Cohen and
Limin Li were able to isolate the
human equivalent of that mouse
gene.
The gene was found to be in an
area of genes that were known to
be missing in many cancer cases,
but previous efforts had failed to
identify the precise gene that sup
pressed tumors.
"Using conventional meth
ods," Francke said in a statement,
"this can take forever."
By looking at tissue samples,
the scientists found out that TSG
101 was missing in seven of 15
samples from women with ad

vanced breast cancer. This is all
the more significant because it
provided insight into noninherit
ed forms of breast cancer, since
most breast cancer cases stem
from spontaneous mutation
rather than inheritance.
While looking forward to
studying the TSG 101 gene,
Cohen and Li see applications for
RHKO technology in many other
fields of genetic medicine and
have sent equipment for carrying
out the procedure to 35 different
laboratories since publishing
their original findings in May.
