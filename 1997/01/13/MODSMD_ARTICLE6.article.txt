The University officially welcomed three asso
ciate deans of religious life into the Stanford com
munity yesterday in a ceremony at Memorial
Church.
The new deans are Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neu
mann, the Rev. Kelly Denton-Borhaug, a Luther
an pastor, and the Rev. D. Maurice Charles, an
Episcopalian.
Each of the deans read part of the opening in
vocation, as well as joining in a refrain with each
other and Dean of Religious Life Robert Gregg.
In his opening remarks, Gregg described the
occasion as "an historical benchmark, since one of
us is a rabbi." Karlin-Neumann is the first non-
Christian dean of religious life at Stanford.
Gregg said this new "interfaith team" is appro
priate to the vision of the University's founders,
who "wanted no single religious group to hold
sway in the University they imagined."
Speakers representing the students and facul
ty of the University read selections from texts of
various faiths, including the Koran and Simon
Weil's "Reflections on the Right Use of School
Studies with a View to the Love of God."
Rabbi Edward Field from Smith and Amherst
Colleges spoke about the choice between devoting
oneself to books or people. In presenting Karlin-
Neumann to the University, he said, "A teacher is
someone who can make the word living in our
lives. Patricia Karlin-Neumann is a wonderful
teacher whom I hope you can learn from."
