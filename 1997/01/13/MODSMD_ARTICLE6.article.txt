### Kelly Vaughan 
The University officially welcomed three asso
ciate deans of religious life into the Stanford com
munity yesterday in a ceremony at Memorial
Church.
The new deans are Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neu
mann, the Rev. Kelly Denton-Borhaug, a Luther
an pastor, and the Rev. D. Maurice Charles, an
Episcopalian.
Each of the deans read part of the opening in
vocation, as well as joining in a refrain with each
other and Dean of Religious Life Robert Gregg.
In his opening remarks, Gregg described the
occasion as "an historical benchmark, since one of
us is a rabbi." Karlin-Neumann is the first non-
Christian dean of religious life at Stanford.
Gregg said this new "interfaith team" is appro
priate to the vision of the University's founders,
who "wanted no single religious group to hold
sway in the University they imagined."
Speakers representing the students and facul
ty of the University read selections from texts of
various faiths, including the Koran and Simon
Weil's "Reflections on the Right Use of School
Studies with a View to the Love of God."
Rabbi Edward Field from Smith and Amherst
Colleges spoke about the choice between devoting
oneself to books or people. In presenting Karlin-
Neumann to the University, he said, "A teacher is
someone who can make the word living in our
lives. Patricia Karlin-Neumann is a wonderful
teacher whom I hope you can learn from."

Denton-Borhaug. He praised her
"articulateness ... theological in
sight ... and personal caring." He
said that although Lutheranism is
"often at its best in a university set
ting ... it is a mistake to suggest
that the Lutheran faith is for intel
lectuals alone."
The Rev. Rebecca Lyman of the
Church Divinity School of the Pa
cific at Berkeley spoke of the "sur
prises and challenges [Charles]
will bring." She said he has a

"mind which is open and unafraid
to explore." He is not afraid to ex
amine "how things are said to be
and what things really are,"
Lyman added.
Provost Condoleezza Rice joined
former Stanford trustee Vernon
Anderson and David Owens, a rep
resentative of the search commit
tee that selected the deans, in pre
senting gifts to the new deans. The
deans received books about Stan
ford as symbols "of our anticipa
tion of great pleasure of your gifts
of mind and spirit," Rice said.
Anderson presented compasses
"to help us to be oriented." Owens
welcomed the deans with large

plastic Stanford coffee mugs, draw
ing laughter from the audience.
In response, Karlin-Neumann
gave the University a shofar, or
ram's horn, which in the Jewish
tradition "calls on those who hear
it to reflect on their aspirations and
purposes."
Denton-Borhaug gave a plumb
line which, she said, is for measur
ing truth, helping the University to
"determine a true line" and repre
senting the "unwavering line of
God's mercy."
Charles' gift was a volume con
taining the Book of Common
Prayer and the Christian Scrip
tures which "holds the tradition

... words handed over from one
generation to the next."
All three deans presented to
Rice a mizrach, or parchment
placed on the wall of a Jewish home
oriented toward Jerusalem. This
parchment contained the verses of
the invocation spoken earlier by
the deans and is intended to "orient
us collectively," Karlin-Neumann
said.
The ceremony ended with the
entire church joining in a recital of
a psalm, a blessingby the deans and
music by the Memorial Church
Choir. It was followed by a recep
tion in the Cummings Art Build
ing.
