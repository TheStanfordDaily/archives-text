## Details discussed Arafat, Netanyahu work on finalizing compromise for Hebron withdrawal 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - After
months of hard-fought negotia
tions and a final push from a U.S.
envoy and the king of Jordan,
Israel and the Palestinians looked
ready yesterday to sign a deal to
pull Israeli troops out of the West
Bank rural areas by August 1998.
The compromise also sets the
stage for an Israeli pullout from
Hebron, the last West Bank city
under Israeli occupation. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said he would struggle to get
Israeli politicians behind him.
Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said the sides
were discussing "final details."
"If the Palestinians don't bring
up new things, I believe we will be
able to sign tomorrow," he said.
In Gaza, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat called his Cabinet
together in what he said would be
a continuous session until the
agreement is finished. Cabinet
members intended "to follow the
negotiations step by step," he said.
Once the draft is finished,
Arafat and Netanyahu must meet
to approve it. Netanyahu also has
promised to try to attain Israeli
Cabinet and Parliament approval
of the accord.
After that, "in a very, very
short time we can redeploy in
Hebron," Mordechai said. "The
army is ready. All the plans have
been completed."
The timetable for a West Bank
pullback was reachcd after a force
ful push Sunday from Jordan's
King Hussein and U.S. envoy Den
nis Ross. In a key compromise,
Arafat told Hussein he would go
along with a U.S. proposal to let
Israel prolong the West Bank pull
out, which had been scheduled to

end by September.
But it was Netanyahu who
faced a revolt in his ranks.
Even though he opposed the
Israel-PLO accords as opposition
leader, Netanyahu had been wide
ly expected to honor Israel's com
mitment to a Hebron withdrawal.
But many in his conservative
coalition were astounded that
Netanyahu agreed to also carry
out the West Bank pullouts, even
tually leaving Arafat in charge of
most of the territories Israel occu
pied in the 1967 Middle East war.
With the issues now linked,
seven of Netanyahu's 18 ministers
said they would vote against the
agreement, and several others
were wavering. Although Cabinet
approval is not legally required,
Netanyahu could face political dif
ficulties if he doesn't get it, includ
ing the potential breakup of his
coalition government.
Transportation Minister
Yitzhak Levy accused Netanyahu
of following in the footsteps of his
dovish predecessor, Shimon Peres,
who negotiated the previous
accords.
"The difference between the
Peres deal and the Netanyahu deal
is only 11 months," said Levy of
the National Religious Party, a
patron of the Jewish settlement
movement in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
Some, like settler leader Nissan
Smolianski, even called for replac
ing the prime minister.
The two sides agreed weeks ago
on details of Israel's 10-month
late pullout from Hebron. A draft
of the agreement specifies that
Israeli troops will withdraw from
80 percent of the city within 10
days after the agreement is signed.
