Court for Clinton?
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court
aggressively questioned both sides yesterday in a
battle over the sexual-harassment lawsuit against
President Clinton, expressing skepticism about
judges managing a president's time yet leery of
having him appear above the law.
As the politically charged case was argued just
one week before Clinton's second-term inaugura
tion, the justices gave little indication whether they
will let Paula Jones' lawsuit go forward while he is
in office.
A decision, which also could affect future presi
dents, is expected by July.

TORONTO (AP) — Supermassive black holes,
once known only in theory, may be sucking in gas
and stellar matter at a voracious rate in the center
of virtually every large galaxy in the universe.
That's the conclusion of astronomers who say
new observations by the Hubble Space Telescope
have detected the "celestial fingerprint" of three
black holes, including one that is a half-billion
times more massive than the sun. A survey of 15
other galaxies suggests that 14 of them also have
black holes.
The discoveries are the strongest observational
evidence yet for black holes, an exotic and elusive
object first predicted by Albert Einstein in his the
ory of general relativity.
