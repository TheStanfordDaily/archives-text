# Clinton proposes Medicare savings
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Pres
ident Clinton's new budget will
propose restrictions in Medicare
payments to health maintenance
organizations as a way to achieve
about $100 billion in savings
over five years, administration
and congressional officials said
yesterday.
The sources, speaking on con
dition of anonymity, said the
reductions in payments to
HMOs would be part of a pack
age that also would call for sig
nificant reductions in payments
to doctors outside of HMO net
works and to hospitals.
About $20 billion in savings
over five years would come from
cutbacks in the premium pay
ments being made to HMOs, the
officials said.
Currently, of the 37 million
Americans covered by the health
care plan for the elderly, 4 mil
lion have chosen to go into
HMOs.
Administration supporters of
the cutbacks argue that the cur
rent fee schedule results in over
payments to HMOs compared
with doctors caring for Medicare
patients in the traditional fee
for-service approach.
They argue that HMOs treat a
larger share of healthy senior
citizens than the regular Medi
care program, which has a larger
share of sicker, more costly
patients. However, HMO offi
cials dispute that contention,
saying it is based on outdated
studies.
At a news briefing yesterday,
presidential spokesman Mike
McCurry refused to discuss
details of the HMO reductions,
which were first reported by The

Washington Post. But he said,
"We believe that. . . the increase
in reimbursements that have
gone to HMOs have been exces
sive. . . . There is a strong argu
ment for reducing some of the
payments that are made."
Administration sources said
the president's budget for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 also
will include a proposal to extend
the life of the Medicare hospital
trust fund, which is projected to
go broke in 2001.
The administration will pro
pose shifting payments for home
health care services from the
hospital trust fund to a separate
Medicare account that is sup
ported by general revenue.
Republicans already have
denounced this idea, which Clin
ton originally put forward last
year, as an "accounting gim
mick" that does nothing to pro
duce actual savings.
On another budget issue, the
president is expected to release
later this week the details of his
aid package for the financially
strapped District of Columbia.
Administration and congres
sional sources said Clinton has
decided to provide support for
the city's share of the Medicaid
program for poor people, run
ning the prison system and cov
ering unfunded pension liabili
ties.
This new federal support
would be extended in exchange
for the elimination of the annual
$660 million federal payment to
the city, these sources said.
Clinton will unveil his budget
plan on Feb. 6, two days after he
delivers his State of the Union
address to Conirress.
