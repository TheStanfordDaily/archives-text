# Letter bombs lead to U.N. evacuation

UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Two letter bombs
sent to the U.N. bureau of an Arab-language
newspaper forced the evacuation of part of U.N.
headquarters yesterday, hours after a third letter
bomb exploded at the newspaper's London offices.
The bomb at the Al-Hayat's London offices
injured two people, one seriously, in an intensify
ing and mysterious mail-bomb campaign against
the Saudi-owned newspaper.
At least a dozen letter bombs have been mailed
to the newspaper's bureaus in Washington, New
York, London and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, this
month. The London bomb is the only one to have
exploded.
The two bombs found at the United Nations
had been fitted into greeting card-sized envelopes,
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
The first apparently arrived at the United
Nations on Friday through the U.S. Postal Ser
vice, remained over the weekend in the central
mail room and was discovered about 11 a.m. by
guards screening parcels at a distribution cen
ter.
Guards then began inspecting all the mail, dis
covering the second letter bomb late yesterday
afternoon in the basement mail room.
"The past pattern is that these things come in
groups so we will be looking for at least a third
one," Eckhard said. Both letter bombs were
addressed to the Al-Hayat newspaper, he said.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan con
demned the bombings as a "cowardly act ... an
assault on the United Nations itself."
