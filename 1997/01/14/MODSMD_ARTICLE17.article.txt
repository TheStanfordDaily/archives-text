## Editorial Attention to freshmen

Freshman seminars are
a smart idea, but must
not interfere with CIV

WHILE FRESHMEN
feel that their academic
concerns are slighted in
the huge research institution that
is Stanford University, the educa
tion of first-year students has been
at the center of academic policy
debate for much of the past year.
Ever since University President
Gerhard Casper announced the
creation of Stanford Introductory
Studies last spring, the future
shape of freshman education has
been up in the air.
The main provision of Casper's
initiative was the introduction of
freshman seminars, intensive
classes of 10 to 15 students to be
taught by senior faculty. The idea
is a good one. Lower-level under
graduates have far too few oppor
tunities to be taught and evaluated
by "regular" faculty, and any
attempt to increase such interac
tions ought to be applauded. But
the freshman seminars ought to be
evaluated in light of the more omi
nous talk about the future of the
most important first-year require
ment, Cultures, Ideas and Values.
Simply put, there is a fear that
freshman seminars are being set
up by Casper and University
Provost Condoleezza Rice to com
pete with, to shorten and ultimate
ly to replace CIV It is critical that
the administration make clear that
no such conspiracy is in the works.
When Casper first announced
the freshman seminars, he explicit
ly suggested "linking it to a current
requirement, such as CIV or Writ
ing and Critical Thinking." In that
vein, many have suggested that
CIV be shortened to two quarters
and that the freshman seminar
replace the last quarter of CIV
That option would only confirm
the worst fears of those who see
freshmen seminars as a tool
against CIV To condense CIV to

two quarters would devastate CIV
both intellectually and economical
ly. How could one possibly intro
duce students to a wide range of
cultures, ideas and values in two
quarters, and who would agree to a
teaching contract for only two
quarters per year? Unless ClV's
goals are radically recast, the
reduction of CIV to two quarters is
nothing more than a prescription
for its eventual demise.
This is not to say that CIV
should continue indefinitely with
out modifications. Every compre
hensive program like CIV ought to
be regularly evaluated to make
sure that it is effectively achieving
a worthwhile goal. Given that CIV
is a required year-long course,
there is even greater reason to
ensure constant improvement.
(And one should note that CIV cur
riculums have hardly remained
static; there is constant fine-tuning
already occurring in every track.)
But decisions on the shape of CIV
ought to be made by faculty, in
close contact with those who actu
ally teach the course, and without
pressure from the administration
to incorporate a new program (i.e.,
freshman seminars).
Rice's comment that "these
things (humanities requirements)
have a life cycle" does not invite
confidence. On a charitable read
ing, she was pointing out the his
torical fact that CIV curriculums
have changed periodically. A more
portentous interpretation suggests
that she is preparing Stanford for
an era free of CIV or any such first
year requirement.
If the administration is truly
looking for ways to ameliorate the
freshman academic experience, the
first thing to do is to strengthen
Ciy not to prepare for its demise.
If increased professor-student
interaction is the goal, how about
having more senior faculty teach
CIV? Freshman seminars should
be great opportunities for those
freshmen who choose to take
them, but they should not in any
way serve the purpose of weaken
ing CIV
