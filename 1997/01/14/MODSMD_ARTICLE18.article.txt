Overseas Studies shows little respect for students

AS A STUDENT who participat
ed in Stanford's Moscow pro
gram this past quarter, I've had
more than a few experiences which I'll
fondly recall for the rest of my life.
Living with a Russian family, strolling
around the grounds of the Kremlin,
visiting St. Petersburg and Kiev and
listening to Stanford destroy UC-
Berkeley in Big Game live over the
Internet were some of the highlights
of my quarter spent overseas. And
while I did not go skinny-dipping with
Daily columnist Carolyn Sleeth, I can
say that I've had my fair share of
memorable experiences.
What I cannot say, however, is that
I've enjoyed my dealings with the
Overseas Studies office. Judging from

my experiences, and from what I've
heard from other students also in the
overseas programs, the quality of the
work done by that staff is lacking. For
example, a friend of mine in the Berlin
program e-mailed Overseas Studies
with an important question regarding
winter-quarter housing, and he did not
even receive a response until he'd writ
ten to the office several additional
times. Or consider the case of another
friend in Moscow. She e-mailed Asst.
Director of Overseas Studies Pam
McNaughton with some criticism of
the academic guidance she was receiv
ing from the Moscow administrators;
instead of ever responding to her,
McNaughton apparently forwarded the
e-mail to the Moscow administrators in

question!
But perhaps the most outrageous
example of all came to my attention
toward the end of last quarter. I
received an envelope from my mother
which she had mailed to the Overseas
Studies office and the office in turn
had included in its weekly FedEx pack
age to Moscow. Imagine my surprise
when I realized that the envelope had
been opened, apparently sorted
through and taped back shut. On the
front of the envelope, next to my moth
er's handwriting, were the words: "OK
— documents only. Forward to stu
dent."
Evidently, someone in the Overseas
Studies office is taking it upon himself
to inspect the correspondences sent via

its office to Stanford's campuses
abroad. How can this gross violation of
privacy be justified? If the Overseas
Studies office feels that the request to
forward mail via its FedEx packages is
excessive, it can return the mail to the
original sender. Or, if the expense of
the additional weight from the letter is
excessive, then it seems simple enough
for the Overseas Studies office to sim
ply bill the recipient. Either way, there
is absolutely no reason to violate stu
dents' privacy in this manner.
Studying overseas can be a wonder
ful experience for Stanford students,
but I cannot say the same about deal
ing with the Overseas Studies office.
