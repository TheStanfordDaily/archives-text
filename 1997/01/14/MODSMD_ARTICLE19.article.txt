# Stanford's rejection of progressive endowment fund is shortsighted
## 
### 
I was outraged to read about the
Board of Trustees' rejection of the stu
dent-initiated progressive endowment
fund proposal in yesterday's Daily. Clear
ly, the University is thwarting its own
goals of increasing alumni participation
in donating to the University by so
quickly dismissing this endowment fund.
I know that I personally will never donate
to this University with the knowledge
that dollars are going toward companies
which are wreaking havoc in the Ecuado
rian rain forest, oppressing indigenous

people in Nigeria and committing acts of
racism against their own employees. This
progressive endowment fund would have
provided a means for me and other like
minded individuals to donate to Stanford.
Even more frustrating is that this
appears to me another instance of the
University attempting to maximize
profit regardless of any sort of moral
consideration for our society. When we
support irresponsible corporations like
Shell and Texaco, we are tacitly
approving of their behavior. It seems to
me that [staff member for both the
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility and the University's
Advisory Panel on Investment Respon
sibility Linda] Kimball's point that the
proposal is taking a "political stance"
and therefore a problem ignores our

University's blatant "political stance"
of approval of corporations' irresponsi
bility. This is an educational institu
tion, not Unocal, Inc.; it seems that
Stanford should be supporting a stu
dent initiative to help the University
rather than so quickly squelching an
idea with such possibility.
