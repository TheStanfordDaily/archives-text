### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
ASSU President Bill Shen and Vice
President Nick Thompson initiated a cam
paign yesterday to prevent University pol
icy from beingdetermined in the interest of
"image, ranking or economic gain" and at
the expense of student interests.
The "University for Students" cam
paign will operate under the broad princi

ples that the foremost responsibility of
higher education is to educate students
and contribute to society, and therefore
universities cannot be run like profit-gen
erating corporations.
"Universities were created for students
and should not have a policy of maximum
returns," Shen said. "If the University fo
cuses primarily on competition and mar
kets, [studentsl become products of an in
dustry, just like soup cans."

According to Shen, Stanford's philoso
phy on student education has "shifted over
the past two years."
The University's failure to support last
year's campaign for social responsibility in
Burma and this year's proposed public ser
vice minor and progressive endowment
fund illustrate that the University has val
ued economic concerns over student edu-
cation, Thompson said.
The principles of the campaign
will be the "broader issue that dri
ves ASSU projects for the remain
der of the year," according to Shen.
Shen and Thompson hope this
campaign will renew discussion
with University administration
about the progressive fund, the pub
lic service minor and the campaign
against the U.S. News & World Re
port college rankings.
The new ASSU strategy also calls

for addressing the need for work
space for student organizations, as
well as reviewing the alcohol policy
and the Stanford Judicial Charter.
"There is a need for discussion
about what should be the driving
policy of the University," Shen said.
The format of the campaign was
inspired by the principles of the
Coalition for Economic Responsibil
ity and Environmental Sustainabil
ity. The environmental group pub
lishes a set of environmental stan
dards which they encourage corpo
rations to follow.
According to Shen, the principles
of the campaign will allow the ad
ministration and students to

achieve a "shared vision of higher
education."
According to Thompson, student
governments at 25 universities
across the country have initiated
similar campaigns. Thompson, who
is a Truman scholar, worked on the
concept with Truman scholars at
Harvard University and Wellesley
College.
Thompson and Shen feel that the
principles of the University should
be dictated by Jane Stanford's
founding grant, which states: "The
University was designed for the bet
terment of mankind morally, spiri
tually, intellectually, physically and
materially."
