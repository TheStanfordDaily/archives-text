# University's emphasis should be on improving education, not economy
## 
### 
It is depressing to me how intricately
connected the success of the Stanford
Fund and the excellence of Stanford

University have become in the eyes of
the administration. Apparently, the
University does not understand, and

therefore expects that no one else will
understand, that one does not need to
invest in large, irresponsible, multina
tional corporations in order to reap a
good return on one's investment.
Many members of the student body,
including its elected representatives,
understand this distinction, and, more
than that, choose to judge the success of
the University by educational, not eco
nomic criteria. I am surprised that the
clarity of thought the students represent
is not shared by the University, especial
ly given the alleged purpose of such an
institution.
