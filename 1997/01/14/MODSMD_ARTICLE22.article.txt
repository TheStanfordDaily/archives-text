## A
						not-so-modest proposal 
### 
Liberal, derived from the
Latin word "liber" or "free." So if
liberal means "free," what then is a
"liberal education"? Certainly not a free
one ... the Bursar's Office can attest to
that!
A liberal education should smack of
freedom when it comes to academics; a lib
eral education should offer students a
chance to explore new worlds of thought
and satisfy that unquenchable thirst for
knowledge, molding every student into
what good ol' Rabelais described as an
"abime de science."
However, Stanford has misunderstood
liberalism in higher education; rather, an
unfortunate and very blatant violation of
this academic freedom still manages to
restrict the winds of freedom from blow
ing.
They are called general education
requirements, formerly known as distribu
tion requirements.
The administration, in its finite wis
dom, claims that GERs "ensure every stu
dent is exposed to different ways of think
ing" and serve "as a nucleus around which
the student is expected to build a coherent
course of study." In English: They want
students to try a little of everything.
That's fine.
But how old are most Stanford stu
dents? Nineteen? Twenty? Did not
Octavius Caesar rule the Roman Empire
by age 19? And how old was Louis XTV
when he took the reins of great France?
What about the young men and women
that compose a large part of our armed ser

vices? Are we not also capable of making
semi-sound decisions by now?
I've always looked at Stanford Universi
ty as one big banquet hall: You've got veg
gies, beef, pork, grains, cakes, pies ... any
and everything you want — "all-you-can
eat" — for only $30K a year.
And then there are GERs. Our own lit
tle "Recommended Daily Allowance" made
obligatory!
A noble effort indeed.
But are we not adults! You don't tell
adults: "Drink your milk, so that you'll
have strong healthy teeth and bones! Eat
your liver, so that you'll get your dose of
iron!" They can decide for themselves.
Selecting courses at a university level is
no different.
I'd like to think that most Stanford stu
dents are smart and want a nice little vari
ety. If there is someone here stupid enough
to pay $30,000 a year for a feast of this
magnitude and only walk out with only a
fruit salad, then they probably don't
belong here to begin with. But that is not
to say that if one opts against the veggies
and the desserts, he is "irresponsible."
Simply, Stanford students are exceptional;
we know what we want and can choose for
ourselves. To quote the Stanford Bulletin:
One of the purposes of the GER is to help
students "become more responsible mem
bers of society."
A community service requirement
doesn't make us more responsible, yet CIV
does? m'm confused.
It appears to me as if the requirements
themselves are a bit arbitrary. How can

the University truly determine which
courses will mold individual students into
"responsible members of society?"
Does "Medicine in Ancient Greece and
Rome" do the trick? What about "Ameri
can Musical Theater"? Or better yet ...
"African-American Vernacular English"?
Instead, permit the students to choose
courses in the same way we do a meal. If
you want "Musical Theater," so be it! I'm
sure the course will be much better since
people who want to be there will be there.
In my case, a Spanish class would certain
ly make me a more "responsible member
of society" — not studying "My Fair
Lady."
But rather than abolishing these GERs,
Stanford has only made it worse. The Uni
versity has taken our tray and prepared it
for us ... calling it a "liberal education."
Bon appetit!
Fewer classes fulfill the requirements
under the new GER system than the old
DRs. And now, one must take the course
for a letter grade. No more pass / no clue.
Thus a force-fed tutelage is fashioned that
is neither liberal nor scholarly, but puerile.
I'm glad I've only one more year at
Leland Stanford Junior High.
