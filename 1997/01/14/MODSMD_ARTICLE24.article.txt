# Tuesday Thoughts: Ethnic Theme Dorms
## Ethnic theme dorms improve minds 
### 
IT IS VERY
tempting to inter
pret my views as
representative of the
staffs of all ethnic
theme dorms on cam
pus, but out of fair
ness to my col
leagues, I feel com
pelled to begin by
saying that I can only

speak for myself.
Before I became a resident assistant
in Okada, the Asian-American theme
dorm, like many people I thought about
the underlying purpose of ethnic theme
dorms and what place they had in the
residential and academic lives of both
students who actually live in the • thnic
theme dorms and those who do not.
To properly evaluate the existence
and role of ethnic theme dorms, it's
essential to remember the original mis
sion of this institution as put forth by its
founders and its first president. Dorms
like Okada can only be viewed fairly in
such a context. Leland Sr. and Jane
established this University on the
premise that it "produce cultured and
useful citizens who were especially pre
pared for personal success in their cho
sen professions."
Furthermore, on May 14, 1887, the
opening day of the University, its first
president, David Starr Jordan, added:
"We hope to give our students the price
less legacy of an educated man, the

power of knowing what really is. The
higher education should help to free
them from the dead hands of old tradi
tions and to enable them to form opin
ions worthy of the new evidence each
new day brings before them."
In this light, ethnic theme dorms are
not merely exercises in political correct
ness nor are they token attempts at
appeasing restless minority populations
as some might argue. Rather, dorms like
Okada, Muwekma-Tah-Ruk, Casa Zapa
ta and Ujamaa are avenues by which the
stated goals of this institution are real
ized. Ethnic theme dorms are important
tools in an important academic exercise:
to learn more about the people and cul
tures that compose a greater American
culture. Okada is not the Asian theme
dorm, it's the Asian-American theme
dorm. This must always be remembered.
Moreover, Okada does not simply pro
vide Asian Americans with a place where
they can segregate themselves from a
larger community. On the contrary,
Okada promotes the idea that Asian
Americans are indeed part of a larger
society. Thus, at a time when the face of
American society is rapidly changing as
minorities become more prominent in
number and recognition, educating stu
dents about all people and their Ameri
can experiences only furthers the goal of
endowing students with the "priceless
legacy of an educated man."
All too often, we easily make the mis
take of relying on outdated stereotypes

rather than the truth — how it "really
is" — to form opinions of unfamiliar
things. In this context, ethnic theme
dorms play a vital educational role by
shedding light on the changes occurring
in the society we live in today and the
one we will live in tomorrow. This is
what I attempt to accomplish as an RAin
Okada, along with the rest of the staff.
I want to show all members of the
University community how it "really is,"
so that by the time they leave the Stan
ford "bubble" I will have done my part to
"help free them from the dead hands of
old traditions and to enable them to form
opinions worthy of the new evidence
each new day brings before them." I
want to share this "new evidence" with
students who might now ordinarily be
witness to it, and under its founding
premise, it is the responsibility of this
institution of "higher learning" to do the
same. Okada is not merely a place to live.
It is a useful vehicle in the search for
truth.
This quarter, Okada is hosting a class
centered on the Asian-American experi
ence. Comparative Literature 40:
"Motions of Asian America: Art and
Media" examines, among other things,
the depiction of Asian Americans in
media. Also, Okada will help sponsor
Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month in
May. These are just two of the ways
Okada offers to share the Asian-Ameri
can experience with the Stanford com
munity. I invite you all to see how it

"really is."
As I continue to examine the role of
ethnic theme dorms and the status of
society in general, I cannot help but ask,
how can this University honestly believe
it is furthering the cause established by
its founders and "producing cultured
and useful citizens" if it does not attempt
to seriously educate its students about
the increasingly dynamic culture of this
country?
So at a time when political correctness

is under intense attack and ethnic theme
dorms are viewed as exercises in political
correctness, the necessity and utility ol
ethnic theme dorms is not even a ques
tion of being PC. Instead, it gets back tc
the roots and the central purpose of this
University: to strengthen students a;
individuals so that they are better fittec
to serve a leading role in a free society.
