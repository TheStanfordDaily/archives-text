# Academic pursuit is too often forgotten in ethnic theme dorms
## 
### 
ONCE AGAIN
the issue of
ethnic theme
dorms has become a
locus of debate on
the Stanford cam
pus. Critics of ethnic
theme dorms see
them as divisive
entities, hothouses
of radical politics

and impediments to desirable assimila
tion. Supporters tend to emphasize the
strong cohesiveness of ethnic theme
dorms, the educ. t-inal opportunities
they afford and their role as "homes
away from home" for ethnic students.
There are two ways to talk about the
establishment of ethnic theme dorms on
campus. One is to look at the history and
contemporary state of race relations at
Stanford. Another perhaps more fruitful
approach might be to look at the larger
context of undergraduate housing in
general.
Since the 19505, when Stanford's
undergraduate population exploded,
the University has consistently empha
sized choice in its residence policy.
True, Stanford went on to build behe
moths like Wilbur and Florence Moore
Halls, but it also allowed fraternities to

maintain their own homes, co-ops and
self-ops blossomed in the 19605, and
coed dorms soon followed. This is the
institutional legacy with which we are
left.
Now, it is always an interesting theo
retical exercise to debate the ideal hous
ing policy of a university. Schools like
Yale and Rice Universities have the col
lege system; Harvard University places
all freshmen into first-year dorms in the
Yard; some schools maintain separate
male and female residences; yet other
colleges encourage students to live off
campus.
There are undoubtedly numerous
ways to organize student residences,
and there is no reason to suppose that
Stanford has the ideal one. But, those
choices have, for the most part, already
been made at Stanford, and the physical
base of the University would not permit
a radical change without significant
cost.
The defining characteristic of the
housing system we have today is its
eclecticism; everything from Mirrielees
apartments to an international co-op to
a human biology theme dorm â€” Stan
ford practically has it all (sorority hous
es being the one notable exception). One
could fill up a whole Draw card without

ever listing two of the same kinds of res
idences. Whether this diversity in hous
ing options is an unqualified good is, of
course, questionable. It is likely a boon
to dorm spirit and simultaneously an

obstacle to University-wide identifi
cation. a

It is therefore suspicious
when only one type of resi
dence house is targeted as V

D
divisive and troublesome.
Why is it that only eth
nic theme dorms are
constantly forced to jus
tify their existence? The
answer, of course, is pol
itics. While the study of
international relations
or environmental studies
is relatively uncontro
versial, issues of race
and ethnic identity
immediately become
entwined in the larger
political context. Unfor
tunately, both ethnic
theme dorms' critics and

supporters use the rhetoric of racial pol
itics to bolster their sides.
Supporters talk about the need for an
ethnic beachhead in an otherwise white
dominated university; they talk about

ethnic pride and the comfort that the
theme dorms provide. Critics talk about
the impending Balkanization of the
campus and the re-introduction of seg
regation.

Both sides need to for
get the culture wars and see
ethnic theme dorms for what
they ought to be: dorms whose
residents are serious about

studying a particular
American minority group
and who want to live with
I other similarly interested

people.
If Stanford can afford
to maintain a human biol
ogy theme dorm, a public
policy theme dorm and
even a popular culture
theme dorm, it can defi
nitely afford theme dorms
in subjects of probably
greater interest to most
Stanford students, namely
ethnic studies.
These houses should

not be defended because they provide
sanctuaries to ethnic students or
because they resist the dominant
paradigm or because the rest of campus
is hostile to minority students.

Ethnic theme dorms should be
defended as legitimate bases for those
students who want to engage in an aca
demic pursuit that the University has
too often ignored. Notice that most of
the other theme dorms are interdisci
plinary programs that do not have inde
pendent departmental bases (interna
tional relations, East Asian studies,
human biology). They also tend to be
highly popular programs.
Ethnic studies fits perfectly into this
mold; the ethnic studies programs are
interdisciplinary programs whose stu
dent interest far outstrips their institu
tional support. Okada, Casa Zapata,
Muwekma-Tah-Ruk and Ujamaa ought
to act as residential bases for these
emerging academic programs.
There is no reason why any racial,
ethnic or religious group ought to have a
dorm solely devoted to self-congratula
tion. Unfortunately, that is how many
critics and supporters see the four eth
nic theme dorms. There is good reason,
however, to have a variety of theme
dorms that focus on academic issues
that interest a lot of students but have
little departmental support.
