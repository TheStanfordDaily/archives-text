### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Stanford wrestling (2-4) lost to 19th-ranked
Fresno State (6-2) Friday 28-6 but bounced back
quickly to make a strong showing and take an
unofficial team title at the Aggie Open the next
day at UC-Davis.
Junior Scott Chapman led the Cardinal team
against the Bulldogs by solidly defeating his
opponent 14-7. Senior Bryan Vaniman also won
for Stanford, beating the Bulldogs' Lalo Moz by
a score of 7-4.
Although the Cardinal managed to win just
two of its matches against the Bulldogs, many of
the contests were extremely close. Stanford
sophomore Zach Zimmerer was edged 5-4 in
overtime by Fresno State's Nick Zinkin at 126
pounds.
"Zach wrestled extremely well," Chapman
said. "He went against a senior who is probably
the best in the country at his weight and basi
cally wrestled him even."
Other close matches for Stanford were sopho
more Doug Bardsley's 7-5 loss to Gary Quintana
at 150 pounds and Jason Gladden's 5-3 loss to
Jason Street at 177 pounds.
While Stanford coach Chris Horpel expected
the experience and competitiveness of Fresno to
put the Cardinal at a disadvantage, his team sur
prised him by remaining competitive with the
Bulldogs in every match.
"1 came into the competition assuming we
were less experienced and therefore unable to be
incredibly competitive," Horpel said, "but the
opposite happened.
"We were in every match, which made me
temporarily satisfied with the team's perfor
mance. However, then I began to think that we
ought to be winning some of the close matches."
Horpel attributes the team's showing to the
hard work during preseason and early-season
workouts and practices.
In the Aggie Open at UC-Davis, Stanford
brought home eight placewinners, nine includ
ing assistant coach and former All-American
Tod Surmon's championship. Chapman again
led the Cardinal by going undefeated in the tour
nament en route to a championship at 167
pounds.
Chapman, who went 5-0 over the weekend,
attributes his success to being in better shape,
having improved confidence and being able to
wrestle "his own style." Chapman is now an
impressive 23-4 overall this season.
Vaniman also capped an impressive weekend
of wrestling by earning a second-place finish.
After cruising to the final in his weight class of
190 pounds, Vaniman lost a heartbreaker 2-1 to
San Francisco State's Lee Lofton.
Vaniman and Lofton remained in a 1-1 tie
through an intense overtime, forcing the match
into an additional 30-second tie
breaker. Opting to take the bot
tom position, Vaniman came
close to escaping his opponent's
tight grip but was held, yielding
the championship.
"Vaniman wrestled better
this weekend than I have ever
seen him wrestle before," Hor
pel said. "He beat his Fresno
opponent for the first time and
wrestled extremely well at the
Aggie Open."
Surmon easily won a champi
onship at 150 pounds, blanking
his opponent 12-0 in his cham
pionship match.
Other placewinners for the
Cardinal included Gladden at
177 pounds, who took second
place, freshman .Jason Talbott,
who took fourth behind Zim
merer at 126 pounds, freshman
Adam Tirapelle, who took third
at 142 pounds, Bardsley, who
finished fourth at 150 pounds,
and senior Chris Serjak, who
placed for the first time in his
career, managing a fourth-place
finish.
"Our performance this week
end is a good indication that
we're heading in the right direc
tion," Horpel said. "With 12
days before our next match, we
will continue to work hard
toward getting ourselves to the
next level."
