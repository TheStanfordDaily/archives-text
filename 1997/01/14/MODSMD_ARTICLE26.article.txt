## Card takes Aggie Open, falls to the Bulldogs 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Stanford wrestling (2-4) lost to 19th-ranked
Fresno State (6-2) Friday 28-6 but bounced back
quickly to make a strong showing and take an
unofficial team title at the Aggie Open the next
day at UC-Davis.
Junior Scott Chapman led the Cardinal team
against the Bulldogs by solidly defeating his
opponent 14-7. Senior Bryan Vaniman also won
for Stanford, beating the Bulldogs' Lalo Moz by
a score of 7-4.
Although the Cardinal managed to win just
two of its matches against the Bulldogs, many of
the contests were extremely close. Stanford
sophomore Zach Zimmerer was edged 5-4 in
overtime by Fresno State's Nick Zinkin at 126
pounds.
"Zach wrestled extremely well," Chapman
said. "He went against a senior who is probably
the best in the country at his weight and basi
cally wrestled him even."
Other close matches for Stanford were sopho
more Doug Bardsley's 7-5 loss to Gary Quintana
at 150 pounds and Jason Gladden's 5-3 loss to
Jason Street at 177 pounds.
While Stanford coach Chris Horpel expected
the experience and competitiveness of Fresno to
put the Cardinal at a disadvantage, his team sur
prised him by remaining competitive with the
Bulldogs in every match.
"1 came into the competition assuming we
were less experienced and therefore unable to be
incredibly competitive," Horpel said, "but the
opposite happened.
"We were in every match, which made me
temporarily satisfied with the team's perfor
mance. However, then I began to think that we
ought to be winning some of the close matches."
Horpel attributes the team's showing to the
hard work during preseason and early-season
workouts and practices.
In the Aggie Open at UC-Davis, Stanford
brought home eight placewinners, nine includ
ing assistant coach and former All-American
Tod Surmon's championship. Chapman again
led the Cardinal by going undefeated in the tour
nament en route to a championship at 167
pounds.
Chapman, who went 5-0 over the weekend,
attributes his success to being in better shape,
having improved confidence and being able to
wrestle "his own style." Chapman is now an
impressive 23-4 overall this season.
Vaniman also capped an impressive weekend
of wrestling by earning a second-place finish.
After cruising to the final in his weight class of
190 pounds, Vaniman lost a heartbreaker 2-1 to
San Francisco State's Lee Lofton.
Vaniman and Lofton remained in a 1-1 tie
through an intense overtime, forcing the match
