# Gymnastics falls prey to No. 3 Georgia
## The
						Lady Dawgs prove to be too much for the Cardinal 
### Tomceh Murakami Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's gymnastics team
sent ripples of excitement and rocked the
overcrowded Burnham Pavilion with its
action-filled routines in its first meet of the
season against Georgia last Friday.
Stanford's overall team score of 191.4
did not capture its No. 3 opponent's
195.025 tally; nevertheless, the Cardinal
squad's performance indicated a bright
season to follow as each gymnast showed
glimpses of what she is capable of.
"Stanford looked really great," said
Georgia coach Suzanne Yoculan. "They
showed so much high-level. They just had
more mistakes, which we didn't have."
Yoculan said the Card looked "especial
ly exceptional on the vault," and"it is only
a matter of time before its high-level diffi
cult moves" elevated the squad to join the
nation's elite.
Although the vault was the Cardinal's
first event, all six gymnasts looked confi
dent as junior Keri Monahan and sopho
more Amy Murakami, co-captains of the
squad, led the young roster on the appara
tus to a near-perfect team average of 9.725
out of a possible 10.

Stanford continued to display consis
tent strength on the next event, the
uneven bars, with Murakami's outstand
ing performance which earned the All-
American a high score of 9.9.
The Card staggered slightly on the diffi
cult beam apparatus with several falls and
shaky landings; however, the highlight of
the night came immediately after this
event with one strong floor exercise after
another bringing the roaring crowd of
1,052 to its feet.
Monahan's opening "full-out," a tum
bling pass of level E difficulty which con
sists of a double-back flip with a full twist
in the second flip, electrified all gathered in
the pavilion. The tumbling passes are
ranked from level A through E, with E
being the most complex. Out of the level E
moves, the full-out is considered especially
difficult and is a rare occurrence in colle
giate gymnastics.
Freshman Larissa Fontaine also shined
in the meet, executing power and elegance
on all four events. She awed the crowd
throughout the night with her consistent
performance, which placed her first in the
all-around category.
