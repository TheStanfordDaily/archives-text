# Men's rugby beats USC
## Bruins beat women 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
The men's rugby team did not let five weeks
without practice stand in the way of a 48-7 rout
over USC Saturday, while the women struggled
to a 45-0 defeat at the hands of UCLA
With finals and the long winter break, the Car
dinal had only one week of preparation under its
belt after the recess but was still able to manhan
dle the Trojans. The team was originally supposed
to face UCLA, but a last-minute cancellation by
the Bruins led to a rescheduling with the cross
town rivals.
Senior Jason White led the team by scoring on
three tries for 15 points for the Cardinal. Also
stepping up to play a key role for the Cardinal was
Shin Inoue.
Inoue "played well because he was very, very
active and very enterprising, and therefore he cre
ated a lot of things for his teammates," said head
coach Franck Boivert "Overall, this victory was a
strong team effort
"This [victory] will give us a lot of confidence in
our offense," he said "Defensively, we have never
really been under pressure, so we have never been
tested there. I hope it's going to happen this Sat
urday against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo."
