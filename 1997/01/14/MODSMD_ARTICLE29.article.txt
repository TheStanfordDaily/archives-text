# Wolters falls in semis at Milwaukee Classic
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
It wasn't a perfect beginning
to the new year, but four Stan
ford tennis players did get 1997
off to a solid start at the 22nd
annual Milwaukee Tennis Clas
sic from Jan. 7-11.
With junior Paul Goldstein
entering as the top seed, and
sophomore Ryan Wolters seeded
second, Cardinal followers had
good reason to hope for a Stan
ford champion, but Harvard's
Thomas Blake walked away with
the crown.
Wolters turned in the top
Stanford effort, advancing to the
semifinals before falling in a
tight match to Blake 6-3, 7-6.
Wolters, who won the event a
year ago as a freshman, breezed
through his first five opponents
without dropping a set.
"I would have liked to have
won," Wolters said. "But I
played pretty well, and it was
good to get some matches in.
Obviously, I think I could have
done better, but I'm not disap
pointed either.
"I had my chances and I think
I could have won that match,
but I just didn't make shots
when I really needed them. I
would set up the points the way
I wanted to, but I wasn't able to
finish them off."
Goldstein advanced to the
third round before dropping a
three setter to Illinois' Gary
Sontag.
"I definitely didn't play the
best I could have," he said. "I
think my problem in singles was
that I didn't have an aggressive
enough mindset at the crucial
times in the match. I didn't play
to win as much as I should

have."
Senior Grant Elliott advanced
to the quarterfinals of the tour
nament by winning six consecu
tive sets. His quarterfinal
matchup with Virginia Com
monwealth's Daniel Anderson
started off very close, but after

'I think I could have
done better, but I'm
not disappointed
either.'
- Ryan Wolters

losing the first set in a tie-break
er, Elliott lost his focus in the
second set and was defeated 7-6,
6-0.
Anderson, who was unseeded,
made it all the way to the final
match before falling to Blake.
The Cardinal's fourth
entrant, junior Charles Hoevel
er, lost in the first round to
Texas Tech's Tvler Jimenez 3-6,
6-4, 6-2.
Wolters and Goldstein
teamed up in the doubles por
tion of the tournament and
advanced all the way to the
finals before getting upended in
three sets by Purdue's Chris
James and Derek Mvers 6-4, 4-6.
6-2.
Stanford's next tennis action
will be Saturday in Albu
querque, N.M., as the Cardinal
takes on the Lobos. New Mexico
boasts a strong squad that
returns most of the players from
a team that almost upset nation
al runner-up UCLA in the first
round of last year's NCAA tour
nament.
