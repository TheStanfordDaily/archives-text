# Water leak causes damage in Ujamaa
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
Several residents of Ujamaa
House returned from winter break
to find their rooms damaged by
water which leaked from a broken
hot water pipe on New Year's Day.
The leaking water pipe was dis
covered on Jan. 2, when firefighters
responded to an alarm. The water
damaged nine rooms in the build
ing, seven of which were repaired
before residents returned from va
cation.
Residents of the two rooms most
damaged by the water leak are cur
rently living in guest rooms adja
cent to Lagunita. Facilities staff an
ticipate the students will be able to
return to their rooms by next week.
"As far as my situation has been
concerned, everyone's been really
helpful," said sophomore Kimberly
Griffin, whose room was one of the
most seriously damaged. Griffin
added that the room is being com

pletely remodeled and that she will
be compensated for her damaged
possessions.
Other students voiced concern
about Lagunita's condition and its
possible connection with the acci
dent.
"It's a concern that's shared by
people not just in Ujamaa but in [all
of] Lagunita," said senior Ines
Diogo, a resident assistant in Uja
maa. "People just want to know
that the building is still going to be
functioning and that their safety is
not endangered."
Residents of Ujamaa met with
University staff at an emergency
house meeting last week to discuss
the incident.
According to Diana Conklin, un
dergraduate residence facilities
manager for Housing and Dining
Services, the leakage itself was not
a serious problem.
"If the break had happened
when the building was occupied, it
probably could have been handled
as a relatively minor maintenance
emergency," said Conklin in a letter
to residents of the affected wing of
Ujamaa.
Rodger Whitney, associate direc
tor of Housing and Dining Services,
said the building is old but in good
condition.
"I think sometimes people asso
ciate things with older buildings
that may or may not be facts of the
physical plant itself," he said.
"While it's an older building, it was
very well constructed"
Whitney added that Lagunita is
home to the Stanford Executive
Program and that participants
choose to live in Lagunita "because
of its character and its good condi
tion."
But some students are not con
vinced. Freshman Jamal Watkins, a
resident of one of the most severely
damaged rooms, said, "The condi
tions in Ujamaa are not up to par."
Housing and Dining Services
staff is "just trying to pacify us by
saying everything is OK," Watkins
said.

Lagunita is the next dormitory
scheduled to be renovated under
the Capital Improvement Program.
Renovation is scheduled for sum
mer 1998.
According to Whitney, water
pipes usually last about 12 years.
The pipe that broke in Ujamaa was
about four years old.
"You don't know exactly why a
washer fails," Whitney said, "[but]
it happens. It's an accident."
Staff members will conduct a
special building systems check be
ginning today, inspecting sink
units in all student rooms and con
ducting spot checks on radiators to
ensure that no leaks are present,
according to a letter Whitney sent
to Ujamaa residents on Friday.
The process will take about one
month.
"We want to reassure [students]
of the ongoing safety in every way
we can," Whitney said. He added
that students will be informed of
the results as soon as the inspec
tions are completed.
"I was really pleased that our
custodial and maintenance staff
were able to respond so quickly
when the leak was discovered, and
that we were able to open seven of
the nine [damaged] rooms on time,"
said Conklin. "That took a lot of ef
forts by a lot of individuals."
