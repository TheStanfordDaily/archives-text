## Equestrian finds success at UC-Davis 
### Erin Reilly Staff writer 
The Stanford equestrian
team returned to the Farm after
winning the UC-Davis-spon
sored Intercollegiate Horse
Show Association competition
Saturday.
Junior team president Aman
da Hoche won high-point rider
and led the Cardinal shutout
over teams from Fresno, UC-
Davis and Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. It was Hoche's second
time this season to capture the
high-point title after winning
top honors at the last competi
tion held at Stanford in Novem
ber.
"The key is you need to know
who the competition is and
where to be [in the ring] for
strategy," said Hoche, who
placed first in the flat phase of
the advanced open division and
second in the jumping class. "It
was an incredible show for us
and well-needed for our confi
dence — our year is really shap
ing
Nearly 125 total riders com
peted, but sophomore Kathleen
Gilbert said she wasn't nervous
since she was concentrating on
her own performance. Gilbert
took first in novice on-the-flat.
"It was a good draw," Gilbert
said of her horse, "and it was
both nice and a relief to point
out " Gilbert needed only one
point to advance to the interme
diate on-the-flat division.
Sophomore Ann Carney bal

anced competing in both English
and Western events. "It's think
ing about different thmgs, but
what I like about riding Western
is that my nerves are already
calmed because the English
classes are earlier," Carney said.
Carney said the main differ
ence between English and West
ern is the speed and tempo of the
ride. "I go from English where I
have to keep the horse going fast
enough and then Western where
I have to slow the pace way
down. But I am getting better at
the transition." Carney finished
sixth in novice over-fences.
The Cardinal riders prevailed
despite several obstacles —
coach Barbara Close was in
Orlando, Fla., for the IHSA
national convention, the team
had a month off from training,
temperatures were near freezing
with foggy weather and the lot
tery of UC-Davis horses was also
fresh from several weeks of
vacation.
The competition wasn't limit
ed to traditional riding horses.
Sophomore Vanessa Bartsch
drew "Danny the Wonder Mule"
and rode him in novice over
fences as well as on-the-flat.
Bartsch said Danny wasn't easy
to pilot since mule conformation
is "downhill." She said he pulled
her around the course but the
experience is one she'll remem
ber. Bartsch, the Western team
president, finished with a trio of
third places for both the English
and Western teams: in English
over-fences, English on-the-flat
and intermediate II stock-seat
equitation.
Freshman Hyman Scott made
his English debut and earned
fourth place in the beginner walk
trot-canter division. The seven
year veteran rider from Illinois said
he was pleased with his perfor
mance but that wearing English
equipment presented a challenge.
"I'm not used to wearing boots
to my knees," Scott said, referring

to the tall black field boots and
britches required in formal English
competition. Previously, Scott only
rode Western for the team.
Sophomore Karen Hoffman
won first place in intermediate
over-fences, and freshman Jana
Cain finished second in beginner
stock seat. Sophomore Chandra
Christenson placed second in the
walk-trot division, and Stanford
alumna Emily Jones ('96) won first
place in the alumni division.
Stanford trails Fresno in year
end standings but looks forward to
continued support from the addi
tion of three new members, plus
interdisciplinary support between
Western and English riders.
