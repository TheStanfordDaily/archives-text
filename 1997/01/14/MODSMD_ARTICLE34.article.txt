# Workshop hopes to avoid grudges
## 
### Nadia Elghobashi Staff writer 
They say that one should for
give and forget, but for some it's
not that simple.
Stanford students will soon
have an opportunity to attend
workshops designed to teach for
giveness when a series of training
sessions begins this quarter.
The program, structured to
teach students how to avoid hold
ing grudges, consists of a series of
five hour-long workshops. Partic
ipants will earn $20 for their in
volvement.
Fred Luskin, a doctoral candi
date and research fellow in the
Complementary and Alternative
Medicine Program of Stanford's
Center for Research and Disease
Prevention, said he designed the
workshops for students to learn
about resentment and ways to
speed up the process of forgive
ness.
" I think life goes better for every
one when you have patience, kind
ness and forgiveness. I chose to
study one of these qualities — for
giveness," said Luskin, who added
that his interest in the subject
stems from a personal experience.
The study, the first of its kind
at Stanford, is unique in its proac
tive approach to conflict, said
Shira Neuberger, a doctoral stu
dent who is assisting Luskin in or
ganizing the program and recruit
ing students.
Luskin's goal is to teach stu
dents to avoid the resentment
which can result from a conflict.
"Teaching a way to avoid hold
ing grudges is a form of primary
prevention," Luskin said.
Neuberger said the study is
"innovative" because it addresses
afield of research which previous
ly was neglected.
"Everyone has been hurt by
someone, so this program has a

broad appeal," Neuberger said.
Participants may share per
sonal experiences if they so
choose.
Neuberger said the workshop's
approach allows students to apply
what they learn to other areas of
their lives as well.
"We will be teaching them
techniques they can use on their
own," Neuberger said.
The first workshop, held in the
Women's Center, will take place
Jan. 27 at 6:45 p.m. Luskin will
hold four additional sessions this
quarter, and another series of
workshops will run during spring
quarter.
Since the beginning of their re
cruitment efforts late last quar
ter, Luskin and Neuberger suc
ceeded in drawing 20 students
into the program. Luskin said he
wants to double the number of
participants.
Despite efforts to advertise the
program via newspaper advertise
ments and e-mail notices, Neu
berger said it has been difficult to
reach students.
Neuberger, who has gone
through the workshops herself,
says she can "speak with passion"
about the research she and
Luskin are doing.
"I think these workshops are
really unique and helpful in look
ing at the way we perceive life and
our priorities," Neuberger said. "I
love working with Stanford stu
dents and reaching out and giving
them an opportunity to partici
pate in workshops like these."
Luskin, who believes the
health of one's heart is linked to
one's emotions, said he hopes this
study will pave the way for future
research in related subjects.
"If we teach people how to for
give and how to heal, over time
this may have a dramatic effect on
the health of their hearts,"
Luskin said.
