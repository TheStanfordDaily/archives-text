# Power outage affects 60 campus buildings
## 
### Jesse Oxfeld Editorial staff 
Parts of the Stanford campus
lost power for roughly 2 1/2 hours
yesterday afternoon after an over
load at the University's Panama
Street electric substation.
Electrical power went out at 1
p.m. at nearly 60 campus buildings,
including most East Campus resi
dences. Wilbur Hall, Branner Hall,
Toyon Hall, Crothers and Crothers
Memorial Hall, and the Cowell
Cluster houses were all without
power, as were some academic
buildings, including Meyer Library.
Power was fully restored by
3:30 p.m.
Although the facilities staff
could not determine the cause of

the power overload yesterday, the
outage is unrelated to October's
failure of the Cardinal Cogenera
tion Facility. The cogeneration fa
cility's staff confirmed that all op
erations were proceeding there as
normal, even during the blackout.
Some campus computing oper
ations were affected by the outage.
All e-mail and other Internet
based systems continued to oper
ate normally, but Residential
Computing's servers shut down
temporarily. Res Comp's servers
allow students using dormitory
clusters to print and to use li
censed software such as Microsoft
Word.
Res Comp's offices are located
in Wilbur Hall, one of the dorms
that lost power.
