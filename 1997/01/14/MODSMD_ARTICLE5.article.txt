# Students protest denial of tenure
## 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
More than 50 students gathered yesterday
to plan a protest against a recent tenure deci
sion in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
The students mobilized after the school's
senior administrators turned down Asst. An
thropology Prof. Akhil Gupta for tenure on
Jan. 6 despite a unanimous recommendation
by an Anthropology Department tenure com
mittee.
The administrators on the committee are
Dean of Humanities and Sciences John
Shoven and his foi lr academic associate deans.
The Ad Hoc Committee for the Tenure of
Akhil Gupta, which first met yesterday at
noon, includes students from a wide variety of

disciplines — ranging from modern thought
and literature to linguistics — and includes
both undergraduates and graduate students.
The committee is conducting its activities
independently of Gupta, who is pursuing his
own appeal.
"Given the unanimous vote in the depart
ment, I was surprised at the decision and, of
course, disappointed," Gupta said. "I am pur
suing whatever avenues are available to me
through the University."
Meanwhile, the student committee plans to
submit letters to University President Ger
hard Casper and Provost Condoleezza Rice in
an efTort to appeal the deans' decision, said
committee member Aly Remtulla, a senior.
"If that level doesn't work out, then a more
aggressive campaign will be conduct
ed," Remtulla said.
The student campaign will focus
on persuading the Humanities and
Sciences deans to reconsider Gupta's
role at the University and reassess
the quality of his scholarship.
Leading anthropologists and
other distinguished scholars across
the country are also expressing dis
may over Gupta's tenure denial, said
Miriam Ticktin, an anthropology
doctoral student and committee
spokeswoman. Professors from Co
lumbia University, the University of
Chicago, Harvard University and
UC-Berkeley continue to write let
ters to the University with evidence
that Gupta's writings are being used
in courses and papers.
The Anthropology Department's
unanimous decision is quite re
markable considering prior intrade
partmental disagreements, Ticktin
said.
However, Assoc. Humanities and
Sciences Dean John Etchemendy
stood firmly by the deans' decision,
which he said was based on an "ex
tremely arduous and careful
process.
"The [tenure] decision is made in
a remarkably fair and judicious
way," Etchemendy said. "The
[tenure process] goes through a
number of committees, and the peo
ple on them take their work about as
seriously as anything they do at the

University."
The files that are put together in
each tenure case are often hundreds
of pages long, consisting of letters
from both experts in the field and
students.
In general, Etchemendy said
Stanford's standards make it excep
tionally difficult for professors to be
granted tenure. Professors seeking
tenure from the University range
from those who are "obviously revo
lutionizing their fields" to those just
"really solid" in them, he said.
"To be quite honest, Stanford
doesn't tenure people who are just
really solid in their field."
Gupta has taught at the Universi
ty since 1989 and is involved in sev
eral interdisciplinary programs in
cluding modern thought and litera
ture, comparative studies in race and
ethnicity, and science, technology
and society.
Several students have voiced con
cerns that the interdisciplinary na
ture of Gupta's work had an adverse
affect on the deans' decision about
his tenure.
However, Etchemendy dis
agreed. "People don't realize it, but
nowadays half of (all) scholars have a
significant interdisciplinary empha
sis in their work.
"If it were because of [interdisci
plinary involvement]," he added,
"then we would see far more people
not getting tenure than we do."
According to Rebecca Stein, a doc
toral student in modern thought and
literature, several Stanford faculty
members will formally support
Gupta in his tenure appeal.
