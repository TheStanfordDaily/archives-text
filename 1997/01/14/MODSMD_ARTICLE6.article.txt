As long as they get rid of the megaphone
and promise not to bad-mouth the Book
store, Stop Monopolies on Campus can set up
its book exchange table on the store's front
steps at the beginning of each quarter, Book
store officials said yesterday.
Group organizers Danny Bramzon and
Hussein Kanji, both juniors, met with sever
al top Bookstore officials including CEO
Peggy Mendelson and Director of Operations
Ken Shark.
Although the Bookstore denied the
group's initial request that it help run the
book exchange, Kanji said he was quite

pleased to be given space on the steps.
"The front steps are Bookstore property
so by letting us set up there, they are kind of
giving us their blessing," Kanji said.
At the meeting, organization members
raised concerns that some books sold in the
textbook section on the lower level of the
Bookstore cost more than books sold upstairs
as part of the general collection.
Bookstore officials explained that bulk
purchasing often leads to higher costs be
cause publishers know the books will be used
as textbooks, Kanji said. However, Bookstore
officials told Kanji that charging different
prices for the same book is unacceptable.
