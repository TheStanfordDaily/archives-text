# Bookstore, SMOC will work together
## 
### Marni Leff Staff writer 
As long as they get rid of the megaphone
and promise not to bad-mouth the Book
store, Stop Monopolies on Campus can set up
its book exchange table on the store's front
steps at the beginning of each quarter, Book
store officials said yesterday.
Group organizers Danny Bramzon and
Hussein Kanji, both juniors, met with sever
al top Bookstore officials including CEO
Peggy Mendelson and Director of Operations
Ken Shark.
Although the Bookstore denied the
group's initial request that it help run the
book exchange, Kanji said he was quite

pleased to be given space on the steps.
"The front steps are Bookstore property
so by letting us set up there, they are kind of
giving us their blessing," Kanji said.
At the meeting, organization members
raised concerns that some books sold in the
textbook section on the lower level of the
Bookstore cost more than books sold upstairs
as part of the general collection.
Bookstore officials explained that bulk
purchasing often leads to higher costs be
cause publishers know the books will be used
as textbooks, Kanji said. However, Bookstore
officials told Kanji that charging different
prices for the same book is unacceptable.
In addition, Bookstore officials
told the monopoly-busters that
they will try their best to ensure a
spot for a student on the Book
store's Board of Directors begin
ning next fall, Kanji said.
Explaining that members of the
Board of Directors assume finan
cial liability for the Bookstore,
Shark said he's not sure that the
board is the most appropriate
forum for student involvement.
"The board is liable for the Book
store, and that is a big financial re
sponsibility," Shark said. "I don't
mean to belittle the students, and
their presence would not be a prob

lem. It's not that the Bookstore is
threatened by having a student on
the board. I just think that it would
be more appropriate for students to
be involved on the management
level."
Shark said the Bookstore's by
laws do not prohibit students from
serving on the board. "I don't think
any students have applied in the
last few years," he said.
Bramzon, however, believes
that students should not simply
serve in an advisory role but rather
play a part in decision making.
Although a summary of the
Bookstore's annual profits is public
information, Bramzon was pleased
that officials agreed to send a copy
of the report to the ASSU and Fac
ulty Senate annually.
"We are pushing for the ASSU to

set up some kind of a committee to
review the itemized report," Bram
zon said.
Because the group is small,
Kanji said he hopes that they will
receive support from the ASSU to
keep its book exchanges going.
" I thought that the book fair was
a tremendous success," Kanji said.
"We would like for the ASSU to
eventually take over. They are a
student service organization, and
the book fair was a big service to
students. Right now, we're waiting
for them to call back."
Overall, both the Bookstore and
the anti-monopoly organization
members felt the meeting went well
and hope to raise the level of stu
dent satisfaction with the Book
store.
"Students have a really evil per

ception of the Bookstore," Bram
zon said. "SMOC wants to help
with that problem. We want to
gather complaints about the Book
store and funnel that information
to the Bookstore to help solve prob
lems."
Textbooks, Shark pointed out,
are extremely expensive, and that
often leads to students feeling
cheated.
"There is a perception that just
because the Bookstore is the only
organization on campus that sells
textbooks means that we are rip
ping people off," Shark said. "Peo
ple think that because the Book
store is a monopoly, the Bookstore
is bad. The Bookstore is a monop
oly, but the Bookstore is not bad.
We provide a good service to the
community."
