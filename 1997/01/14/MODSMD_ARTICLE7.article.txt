# 'Jock' walks walk, shocks stock

When Marin Phenice Heiskell
was crowned the 1997 USA Na
tional Teen Miss, no one was
more surprised than Heiskel!
herself.
A self-described jock, the
Stanford freshman found herself
on a runway in Anaheim, Calif.,
competing with representatives
from every state in the union.
Heiskell's only previous expe
rience was winning her state
competition; she had no doubt
that of the young women on the
stage, she was one of the least fa
miliar with the trappings and
techniques of the pageant world.
Although her mother had
been Miss Teenage Arizona,
Heiskell had never considered
entering any type of pageant.
When she found out that her
church was sponsoring a state
pageant, she was reluctant to
enter. It was the scholarship op
portunity that changed her
mind: The winner of Miss
Teenage Texas would receive
$6,000.
Heiskell was surprised and
impressed by the pageant re
quirements.
"It's not like a typical TV
pageant," Heiskell said. "You
have to submit a resu me, scholas
tic transcripts and evidence of
community service. The inter
views count for 40 percent, which
means that even if you get a per
fect score in the evening gown,
that's still not enough to win."
Despite being an Ail-Ameri
can cheerleader at her high
school in Dallas, Heiskell said
her high school experience was
less than ideal. When consider
ing college, her school advisers
were not supportive, warning
her that her top choices were be
yond her reach.
Heiskell found the support
she needed from her father, a
criminal defense attorney, her
mother, a physician, and her

younger brother.
"My parents never pushed
me. I took dance and piano for 10
years, and when I wanted to quit
piano, my mom said, 'Fine.' They
only wanted me to do things that
I really enjoyed," Heiskell said.
"I played tons of sports and var
sity volleyball, but cheerleading
ended up being the thing I got the
most out of."
Additional support, she said,
came from her pageant success
es.
There is little question that
Heiskell faced fierce and well
trained competition. Texas is
largely considered the most com
petitive stop on the pageant cir
cuit. Some of Heiskell's state
level competitors had been enter
ing pageants since their toddler
days. Most brought custom
made gowns, coaches and the re
sults of years of specialized class
es.
Heiskell had only a few quick
posture lessons from her uncle's
girlfriend, who runs a charm
school, and dresses bought off
the-rack.
"She helped me walk in a long
dress and heels," Heiskell, said
laughing. "I mean, an athlete
walks one way, and a woman on
the runway another."
Her competitors' outside
coaching ended up working in
Heiskell's favor, she explained.
"I really don't believe in
coaching. You should be your
self," Heiskell said. "And when
we had the final question, every
one had to pick one out of the
bowl. You could really tell which
of the girls had prepared an
swers. It sounded fake. I just said
what I thought, and so it had to
be more real."
Clearly, the judges agreed.
There had never been an
African-American Miss Teenage
Texas. Heiskell was thrilled to be
the first.
