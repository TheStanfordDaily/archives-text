## Creativity and innovation mark Stanford Taiko

Wrapped around the barrel in
a clumsy hug, sophomore Kris
Bergstrom struggled to hold to
gether the wobbly wooden
staves.
"OK, maybe we'll try another
way," Bergstrom said, as the bar
rel collapsed inward like a 3-D
jigsaw puzzle.
Every weekend winter quar
ter, Stanford Taiko repairs and
creates new drums for perfor
mances. As with its musical
genre, its design techniques rep
resent the group's creativity and
innovation. Founded in 1992,
Stanford Taiko, a Japanese drum
group, has evolved in its style
and expertise, in both playing
and craft.
"We make do with what we
have," senior Wisa Uemura said as
she hammered apart crooked
staves. "We figure out what
works."
With a grin, Bergstrom added,
"It's a blatant misuse of tools.
Chisels are used for hammering
down rims or screwdrivers for
breaking wood apart."
Several veteran Stanford
Taiko members explained the
drum-making process. After re
moving the metal rings which
hold the staves together, mem
bers race to fill in the cracks with
quick drying glue. Their mission:
to pull together the barrel before
gravity collapses the staves.
"It's like trying to hold togeth
er an onion falling apart," said
junior Glen Shimbo, whose older
brother, Barden, was a founding
member.
After the glue dries, the group
cuts off the ends to achieve the de
aired waveribwation and .sand the
sides. Larger drums have a deep

er, fuller sound, Shimbo said.
Plywood inserts are then use 1
to reinforce the drums, which
often crack under the stress of
playing. The skins are stretched
twice on the drum and nailed
down to the drum, Shimbo said.
Drums are then varnished to a
glossy sheen
After a quarter's worth of
work, the wine barrels are trans
formed into drums as beautiful
as they are functional. And with
every member participating, the
knowledge is passed on through
the ensemble.
A professionally made taiko
costs upward of $2,000. Stanford
Taiko uses French Oak wine bar
rels, which cost about $75. While
traditional taiko drums made in
Japan are carved from a single

solid piece of wood, most groups
rely on the expensive sta\?
method of construction, Uemura
said.
Whatever method selected, ul
timately the true value of an in
strument lies in its capacity to be
played. Stanford Taiko plays
stirring and rousing music upon
its drums. Although practice ses
sions are scheduled for twice a
week, taiko members often put
in many more hours to the wood
en altar.
"We're psychotic," Shimbo
said.
Besides the hypnotic drum
ming which sounds the bats from
the surrounding treetops, taiko
practice includes a round of
push-ups and sit-ups.
"The problem is that Glen is

usually in charge of the workout,
;md he's in so much better shape
that the rest of us," Bergstrom
said. "We'd just as soon stop
when he starts."
The songs, which last from
two to eight minutes, require sta
mina and strength. Besides flex
ing their muscles, members use
their voices to energize perfor
mances.
"Some people call it grunting,
but it's more than that. It comes
from your hara, your center,
your diaphragm," Uemura said.
"It can help you get through the
song, pushing you, giving you in
spiration."
These potent exhalations res
