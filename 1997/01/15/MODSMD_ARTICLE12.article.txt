Mideast accord signed
ERKZ CROSSING, Israel (AP) — Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators signed a long-awaited
agreement on Israel's long-delayed pullout from
Hebron and parts o<' the West Bank yesterday,
ending a dangerous impasse in Middle East
peacemaking.
The agreement lays out "a pathway of greater
hope and possibility for peace in the Middle East
as a whole," said U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, who
pushed for the accord in four months of tortuous
negotiations.
Authorities did not immediately release details
of the accord. But according to reports and infor
mation provided by officials previously, Israel is
to give the Palestinians control of 80 percent of
the Biblical city of Hebron with days.

NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI pressed anew
yesterday for telecommunications industry help
in providing wiretap access to high-tech phone
systems.
But in describing a revised federal proposal
toward this end. Asst. FBI Director James Kall

strom said it would not mean substantially
increased eavesdropping by federal law enforce
ment authorities.
Kallstrom, who used court-ordered wiretaps to
nab Gambino mob boss John Gotti, did say that
unless phone companies abide by the mandate in
a law passed by Congress, "The criminal is going
to have a huge leg up on law enforcement.
"They are going to be able to create a sanctu
ary for themselves that is impervious to the law,
a sanctuary where no law enforcement or search
warrant can reach them," he said at a news con
ference.
Marijuana? Aisle two
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Phones rang and
pot plants grew at the Cannabis Cultivators Club
yesterday in preparation for what supporters
called its historic reopening.
Protected from California's anti-drug attorney
general by a state proposition, the club was set to
provide pot to its first customer today.
"We are going to sell the first legal marijuana in
over 60 years in America," marveled club founder
Dennis Peron as he fingered a cannabis plant
known as northern lights. "I can't believe it."
