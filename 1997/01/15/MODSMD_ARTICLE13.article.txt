BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (APi
Foes of Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic won official recognition yes
terday of an election victory in the Ser
bian capital â€” their biggest demand
during weeks of massive protest and
international pressure.
Milosevic's opponents were skepti
cal of whether he and his Socialist
Party would actually give in to the new
announcement by the city's electoral
commission and hand over control of
Belgrade's municipal government.
They vowed to keep protesting but
suspended a demonstration last night to
see if the government had given way in
Belgrade and in other cities including
Nis, the country's second-largest. For
eign governments also took a wait-and
see attitude.
While giving in could bring an end to
nearly two months of daily protests that
have shaken Milosevic's autocratic rule,
it also would give his opponents much
more political leverage than they have

had during his nine years in power.
The Belgrade commission previous
ly had declared the opposition victori
ous in Nov. 17 balloting, only to be
overturned by a court. It seemed
unlikely, however, that the commission
would have repeated its declaration
without backing from a higher author
ity.
In Nis, Socialists on the electoral
commission gave in after days of stalling
and stopped opposing a court order to
reinstate the opposition's election tri
umph there.
The Socialists already had with
drawn their claims to five lesser towns;
the opposition claims wins in Belgrade
and 13 other major Serbian cities.
"I believe nothing," said opposition
leader Zoran Djindjic, who would be
mayor if the opposition indeed wins Bel
grade. "This is another attempt to buy
time. We will continue our protests
"There is no reason for euphoria.
Belgrade is only a part of the whole

package," he said "We don't trust this
regime until our deputies constitute the
city council."
Djindjic said the opposition wanted
to see its victories recognized in all the
cities it won and its representatives
actually take power.
The 1 S government was waiting for
the same thing. "We're just going to
reserve any kind of commendation for
the Belgrade government" until the
opposition victors take their seats. State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
said in Washington.
Belgrade has been the scene of large
daily demonstrations, including 500,000
people Monday, since the election wins
by the opposition were annulled.
Opposition control of Belgrade would
break the near-monopoly on electronic
media now enjoyed b\ the Socialists and
their neo-Communist coalition part
ners. Bv law. the city council has the
right to run radio and television sta
tions in the city.
