# House ethics panel loses Democrat
## McDermott cites 'conscience' in leaving Gingrich investigation 
### 
WASHINGTON <AP) — The House
ethics committee's ranking Democrat
said yesterday he would remove himself
from the investigation of Newt Gingrich,
bowing to pressure that built quickly
over his handling of a taped phone call
involving the speaker.
As partisan conflict escalated to a
fever pitch. Rep. Jim McDermott, D-
Wash., said that "as a matter of con
science" he was stepping aside to call
attention to Republican "subversion
of an independent, fair ethics pro
cess."
He conditioned his recusal on Repub
licans maintaining political balance on
the evenly divided committee. The GOP
could do so by removing one of their
members — presumably newly appoint
ed Lamar Smith of Texas — leaving the
panel with four lawmakers from each
party.
Not to be outdone by McDermott,
Republicans accused him of violating fed
eral law by accepting a recording of a

C 7
telephone call, in which Gingrich plotted
his responses to his admitted ethical
wrongdoing.
FBI Director Louis Freeh said an
investigation would begin immediate
ly into the taping by a Florida couple
and"the subsequent dissemination"
of the contents. McDermott did not
address whether he leaked the tape to
The New York Times, although the
newspaper said it was obtained from
an unidentified Democratic congress
man.
Gingrich told ABC News that McDer
mott "should do what his conscience dic
tates, but certainly members of Congress
shouldn't break the law "
McDermott tarred ethics committee
Chairwoman Nancy Johnson with accu
sations of violating the House rules >he's
supposed to enforce. He said she refused
to consider evidence on the tape that
showed Gingrich breached his commit
ment not to orchestrate reactions to the
violations.

He bitterly attacked her stewardship
of the committee, saying. "Complaints
lodged against members of the minority
have been used as barter in negotiations
over sanctions for Gingrich. Complaints
had been filed against Democratic floor
leader Dick Gephardt, who was told to
amend his financial disclosure reports,
and Democratic Whip David Bonior.
although the Bonior complaints were dis
missed.
McDermott s comment.- were in a
written statement and a letter to John
son. The chairwoman responded just as
harshly, lashing back in a written state
ment of her own.
"I will not allow angry partisanship to
divert the committee from its job of pro
viding the public and the Congress with
complete information in the Gingrich
case," she said
"We are moving forward to provide
full public disclosure of every aspect of
this case to be followed by a hearing and
a vote on the House floor
