Shen needs to move
to implement all
provisions of 'C '96'

LAST SPRING, THE stu
dents of Stanford University
overwhelmingly voted to
overhaul the student government
by approving a new constitution.
"Constitution '96" included
sweeping reforms designed to cre
ate a more open, sensible and effi
cient government for the ASSU.
But to this day many of those
changes have not been dealt with,
and 111 pages of bylaws have yet
to undergo scrutiny Sadly enough,
the items the ASSU Senate and
ASSU President Bill Shen have
neglected to implement are those
that deal with public information
and checks and balances.
These circumstances are espe
cially upsetting when one consid
ers the upcoming election season.
With all the rules and regulations
which special-fee groups must
hurdle (detailed budget reports,
statements, interviews, etc.), it's
an affront to those groups that the
ASSU itself neglects to follow
what Shen calls the "will of the
students." How can the ASSU
expect those groups to work with
in a system whose rules sway and
bend with the breeze of conve
nience?
For example, if you were to ask
for a copy of the election bylaws
today, no student government offi
cial would be able to find an offi
cial copy. In fact, even though the
process is just a month away from
beginning, the elections commis
sioner herself cannot even get a
complete copy of the rules govern
ing the spring election.
Public documents have long
been a weapon of the common cit
izen against the bureaucracy, and
it's an outrage that these docu
ments are not available to the stu
dents. Students may or may not be
interested in reading the full min
utes of senate or committee meet

ings, but as the consideration of
quarterly funding packages ends,
many student organizations may
wish to review the reasoning for
which they were denied money.
Senate Chair Donald Aing
worth argues that agendas of the
senate and the steering committee
meetings are posted electronically
on the ASSU newsgroup. This
may satisfy, in a basic way, the
constitutional requirement, but
it's not the most convenient
avenue for students to access the
information. Agendas should be
posted on the ASSU Web site
where there's a better chance that
students will see and read them.
What's more, agendas ought to be
supplemented with the actual
minutes of the meetings as soon as
possible. As servants of the stu
dents, ASSU officials should work
for maximum convenience and
access, not mere legalistic tinker
ing.
Another topic of grave constitu
tional concern is the third compo
nent of the ASSU checks and bal
ances system: the Constitutional
Council. This essential, yet nonex
istent, body has the right to over
turn decisions or actions of the
legislative and executive branches
that it deems unconstitutional. Yet
Shen chose to wait until last night
to nominate his candidates to the
council, and the senate has come
to the sudden realization that
there are no guidelines or rules to
approve these nominees. Expect
the council to go unfilled for at
least another quarter.
As the first elected ASSU presi
dent in more than 25 years, Shen
is the chief executive of the ASSU
and is solely responsible for its
day-to-day operations and activi
ties. Yet, the majority of Shen's
agenda to date has included broad
and nebulous campaigns that do
not have direct policy implications
for the ASSU or the students of
Stanford.
While much blame can be
assigned to the senate, Shen must
shoulder this heavy burden of
responsibility
