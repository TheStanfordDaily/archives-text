SMOC member defends use of megaphone by Bramzon

AS A STOP Monopolies on Cam
pus member (or, in Elliott
Brown's words, one of "Danny's
kids"), I feel compelled to register my
objection to his dismissal of the organi
zation as trivial and annoying. I became
involved with SMOC when a friend
asked for help typing the booklist. Soon
afterward, I found myself a used math
book at a great price, and I signed on to
the team. Some $150 saved later ("A
couple of bucks," Elliott?), I'm actually
able to pay my Visa bill this month, and
I have a hard time feeling much sympa
thy for Brown's moments of annoyance
over Danny Bramzon's zealous use of a
megaphone.
The Bookstore's excessive prices
may be an issue of only minor concern
to Brown, but for some students, book
purchases take a huge chunk out of
spending money we don't really have.
If Brown thinks SMOC is just a game,
he should ask the hundreds of students

who saved thousands of dollars buying
and selling books over the SMOC book
list. Better yet, ask the five Bookstore
executives who met with Bramzon and
other SMOC members Monday and
granted several valuable concessions —
including an inclusion of students on
the Bookstore advisory committee.
Eventually, Brown just might be forced
to save money in spite of himself.
Brown's dislike of SMOC seems to
center around his disdain for Bram
zon's method of attracting attention.
He claims that as a result of Bram
zon's "megaphone campaign," he was
actually discouraged from participat
ing. His own loss, no doubt! In any
event, were it not for the megaphone,
Brown may never have known of the
booklist's existence, and neither would
many of those students who did partic
ipate and benefit. Bramzon's use of the
megaphone was undoubtedly crucial to
the success of the booklist, and the

minor and very brief irritation of a few
seems a small price to pay — especially
since others annoyed bv the mega
phone were probably far more able
than Brown seems to be to get over it
rather than wasting their time com
plaining.
Granted, standing in front of the
Bookstore and lobbying students with a
megaphone may not be the most digni
fied way to make a point, but what
works, works. (Anyhow, if we're talk
ing about making our points in a
mature and dignified manner, explain
to me how snide remarks about some
one's stature and clothing fit into that
approach?)
While Brown himself may not have
enjoyed Bramzon's strategy, he cannot
reasonably say that the megaphone did
more harm than good, and his center
ing of his attack on such a trivial point
indicates that he himself is the one
who could be spending his time

protesting "more important issues.
Finally, let me say that when Brown
does get around to attempting a rea
sonable case against SMOC, his logic is
greatly flawed. He points out that, on
campus, the school itself holds a
monopoly. However, the fact that Stan
ford is a monopoly at Stanford bears
little relation to the fact that an on
campus business which students are
forced to patronize has the freedom to
set whatever prices it chooses. True,
we accepted this when we came here —
however, would it be so bad if future
students didn't have to accept the same
raw deal?
What it comes down to is that
SMOC has thus far been successful in
spite of people like Brown, and my
guess is that no one has heard the last
of it. Brown had better hurry up and
buy those earplugs.
