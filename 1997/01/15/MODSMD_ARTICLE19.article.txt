# Criticism of Bramzon is correct, but can also apply to Elliott Brown
## 
### 
What Danny Bramzon (leader of
Stop Monopolies on Campus) is trying
to do is noble at best, obnoxious-we
need-something-better-to-do at worst;
however, at least he's funny.
I also understand what Elliott
Brown is trying to do with Monday's
column. The megaphone gives a speak
er an unfair advantage in that he can
not only drown out everyone around
him, but can harass at will without
running any real risk of conflict.
Elliott's missing one little point,
though: His column is the biggest
megaphone of all.
The Daily reaches just about every
student on campus. Not everyone
reads it, and even fewer people read

each article printed, hut the numbers
they reach still outdoes Bramzon, even
on his best days. If anything is unfair,
it's that his only response now can be
in the form of a letter to the editor,
similar to this one, that few people will
notice.
I'm sure Brown would respond that
while Mr. SMOC picks out people and
"forces" them to participate, readers
can choose whether or not they read
his column; his megaphone in fact is
much friendlier than those fanatics —
including Bramzon — in White Plaza.
There's only one problem, though;
just as a poor student is forced to
cower under Bramzon's onslaught
when trying to sell a book back to the
Bookstore, poor "Danny from Miami"
•as Elliott called him) now has to hang
his head low, knowing that while not
every student read this one-sided
attack, those that did will now look at
him — and his crusade — and laugh.
All I'm trying to say is that some

causes we all love (i.e., Burma), and
some we hate, hut if we're going to
allow one and praise their attention
grabbing techniques, we have to
embrace them all.
This doesn't mean we can't criticize
them or what they do; it just means
that we shouldn't take a high road and
criticize those trying to reach a greater
audience when, in truth, that's all edi
torials like Brown's are doing in the
first place.
I'd say that the pot shouldn't call
the kettle black, but who knows how
many PC objections would come of
that? So instead, my parting words
shall be this: If you don't like Danny,
tell him to shut up. In fact, that's
exactly what I did — more than once
— as I walked by his stand. And if that
doesn't work, then go get a megaphone
of your own, but by all means, don't
try to take his away.
