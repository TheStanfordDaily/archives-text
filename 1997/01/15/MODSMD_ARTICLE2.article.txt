Students studying "Sleep and Dreams" in
Psychiatry Prof. William Dement's Human Biol
ogy 11 course can always get his permission to
sleep in class.
If they did so on Monday, however, they were
doing it on national television.
Hoping that the "sleep-deprived campus"
would provide interesting clips for a week-long

program on sleep scheduled to air early next
month, the NBC Nightly News crew brought its
cameras into Dement's popular class of about
300 students.
Dement said NBC News was only one of
many news organizations interested in his class
and sleep issues in general. He attributed this at
tention to a cover story in The New York Times
Magazine on Jan. 5 and mentioned Good Morn
ing America and the Today show as among the
interested parties.
The series is scheduled to air on NBC News

the week of Feb. 3, Dement said adding that he
had suggested filming the class to NBC and
might make the same suggestion to other pro
grams.
Dement said he was extremely pleased with
the media's new coverage of sleep deprivation,
which he called America's "No. 1 health prob
lem."
He said that of the three biggest health issues
facing students — nutrition, fitness and sleep —
researchers know by far the least
about sleep and the problems of
sleep deprivation.
"We are trying to create an
aware public, and the media is a
good route," said Dement, who has
spent 40 years researching sleep
and dreams.
He added that he had personally
appeared on television many times
but that this marked the first time
his class was actually filmed.
"The students were wonderful"
during t he filming, he said.

Monday was the second day of
class, and Dement began the lec
ture by asking general questions
about his students' sleep habits.
The NBC Nightly News crew
found that perhaps the students of
"the school that never sleeps" were
still on their vacation sleep sched
ule.
Several students said they had
gotten more than eight hours of
sleep the night before, and only a
few said they regularly stay up
until the early hours of the morn
ing.
Freshman Jessika Macias was
the most sleep-deprived that day.
I was kind of surprised that no
one else raised t heir hands because

my friends and 1 usually stay up
until 3 or 4 in the morning," Macias
said.
That day, Macias had stayed up
close to 6 a.m. but still attended De
ment's 11 a.m. class.
According to Dement, students
in his class take away one very
practical lesson.
"1 think they are getting more
sleep," Dement said.
Macias agreed. "We now are
conscious that we are deprived of
sleep," she said. "So we are going to
try to nap during the day."
Macias added that the class has
been a lot of fun so far, and she
thinks she will enjoy going to class
three mornings a week.
