# Jackson's complaints are misleading; mail service obeys law

### 
Fric Jackson (in yesterday's Letters)
complains of the mailing service Over
seas Studies has provided to students in
Moscow. As the staff member responsi
ble for mailing, I would like to respond
briefly. Because of frequently inadequate
postal connections to Moscow, Overseas
Studies extended the courtesy to some
parents of Moscow students of forward
ing written material in our weekly Fed
eral Kxpress packages. Federal Express
requires us to comply with international
postal and customs regulations and to
confirm the contents of all packages. We
have no choice but to obey the law.
