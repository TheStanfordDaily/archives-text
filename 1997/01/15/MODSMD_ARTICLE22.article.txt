## Another victory for peace? 
### 
NOW THAT HEBRON has been
settled. I expect the talking
heads at NBC and CNN to pro
claim a great day for peace. They're
wrong.
Hebron was a fait accompli — Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
walked into the situation with his
hands tied. The entire world expected
Israel to remove its presence from
Hebron, and all he could do was delay
the truly inevitable. But the real prob
lem for the peace process began in
September. In a word, that problem
was, is and always will be "Jerusalem."
Remember last September when the
Israelis built a tunnel right underneath
a Muslim holy site? At least that was
the story in most of the world press . . .
What really happened was much
more complex and had a far more dis
turbing effect on the peace process than
anyone outside of Israel really under
stands.
In fact, no "new tunnel" was dug.
The tunnel itself is far more than 2,000
years old. It has been open to the pub
lic for 17 years. The only new construc
tion was the opening of a second
entrance to the tunnel, which is at least
250 meters from any mosque. Further
more, the "spontaneous" Palestinian
protests did not reach a crescendo until
36 hours after the tunnel had officially
opened, once the Palestinian Authority
had ample time to orchestrate the
event. When Israeli troops responded to
the disturbance, thev were attacked bv

Palestinian "police," who overran at
least two Israeli positions.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world
blamed Israel for the crisis, claiming
that Israeli disrespect for Muslim holy
sites led to a hrutal military crackdown.
Once he was good and ready, Palestini
an Authority President Yasser Arafat
called off his dogs, but he'd skillfully
turned the situation into a PR night
mare for Netanyahu while simultane
ously bolstering his own position with
the Palestinian people. The truth is,
the tunnel's existence is offensive to
Palestinians because it reminds them
that Jews lived in this city for 1,500
years before the existence of Islam.
Israelis had a different reaction.
This summer, I spent two months
teaching English in a development
town called Kiryat Malachi. The work
ing-class Sephardic town voted over
whelmingly for Netanyahu in the May
elections, but its children serve in the
army too; no one wants to send their
kids back into Gaza.
These are the swing voters who in
1992 had had enough of Likud's foot
dragging and helped elect Yitzhak
Rabin in the first place. In 1996, terror
ism pushed this group to vote for
Netanyahu. Now, they too focus on
Jerusalem.
The tunnel incident marked an
important change in Israeli attitudes
toward the Palestinians. Most Israelis
rationally seek coexistence, just as most
Palestinians do; but events change atti

tudes, and the sight of armed Palestini
ans shooting at Israeli troops in Israel
while Arafat hypocritically claimed
Israeli insensitivity was too much for
the Israeli public to handle.
With all the instability remaining in
the Middle East, I can say one thing for
certain: It will take a war to dislodge
Israel from Jerusalem. For almost
2,000 years, Jews suffered while their
capital was occupied, and the divided
Israeli public will demonstrate its
remarkable ability to unite on this
issue.
Certainly Palestinian claims to
Jerusalem have equal validity. After
all, Jerusalem is historically as impor
tant to Islam as it is to Judaism, isn't
it? It was under Arab control for all
time prior to 1967, right? The ancient
nation of Palestinians thrived in this
metropolis before any Jews came
around, nest pas?
You know the truth if you've been
there.
There can and should be a Palestini
an state, without Jerusalem. But there
cannot be an Israel without Jerusalem.
Unfortunately, I doubt the issue will be
decided by negotiation.

Next year, Jim Fins ten hopes to be in
Jerusalem.
