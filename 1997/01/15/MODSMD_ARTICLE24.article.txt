# Jeremy Desmon: Batteries not included
## Namenesia: the facts behind the disorder 
### 
EVKR SINCE I uttered my first
words, I've been remarkably lousy at
remembering people's names. It's
not that I'm a moron; it's just that more
often than not, I just can't match the face
in column A with the name in column B.
Over the years, I have learned how to deal
with this problem, mainly by finessing my
way out of many difficult and embarrass
ing situations through various tactics, but
I'm tired of living a lie. I feel that it is time
to fess up and say it straight:
My name is Jeremy . . . and I have
"namenesia."
Namenesia affects one out of every 7.5
people and is more than just an excuse for
my own sheer stupidity. Namenesia is a
documentable psychological phenomena
(documented here, that is), and we must
not continue to ignore its effect on our
great country. Looking back in our
nation's history, there are hundreds of
examples of great men and women who
were stricken with this debilitating disor
der. In fact, a famous U.S. president had
this problem once, and if I remember

exactly which one it was, I'll let you know.
Right now, you might be asking:
"Aren't namenesiacs just irresponsible,
slovenly people who are undeserving of
our pity and should actually be kicked in
the shins as I walk by?" This question,
however, just propagates the mass igno
rance affiliated with this affliction that is
an affront to all affected. Namenesiacs are
just like me and you — well, me, at least
and we deserve your understanding and
support.
To help you understand how a namene
siac might forget the name of a friend, let
me walk you through a typical namenesia
cal episode. Let's choose a hypothetical
namenesiac that we will call, say, Jeremy*.
Jeremy walks into his political science
seminar, sits down and introduces himself
to the girl sitting next to him. "Hi," he
says. "Hi," she responds. A good begin
ning, but here is where the disease takes
hold. Somewhere between "My name is
. . ." and "Nice to meet you," her name
vanishes from Jeremy's mind. Poof. Gone.
Jeremy searches his mind and finds only

+ = 1."
While he searches, their conversation
continues and soon they have passed "The
Point of No Return." He can no longer ask
her what her name is. It's too late. So he
figures he'll wait for someone to say her
name during class. No one does. The next
day, he runs into her in White Plaza. "Hi
Jeremy," she says. "Hey you," he replies
(or "Hey, babe" or "Wassup, G?"). And
soon enough, they know all about each
other's hopes and dreams and fantasies
and tattoos and favorite episodes of "The
Simpsons," and he can't ask her what the
hell the name is on her door because they
are friends already, and you can't ask your
friend what her name is, and he just fig
ures he'll wait for someone to say her
name in the next class.
And no one ever does.
The tricky thing about this disorder is
that namenesiacs like our friend Jeremy
have become extremely proficient at hid
ing the fact that they suffer from the con
dition. Namenesiacs are usually unwilling
to admit that they are afflicted, and to

avoid detection they have developed many
tricks and tactics designed to learn the
names of friends of theirs who have
become "nameless" to them. I have listed
many of these secrets below, and if you
recognize these patterns of behavior in
your friends, you may need to stage an
intervention. Some typical behavior:* are
as follows:
•Be aware of name-probing questions
such as "What's your e-mail address?" or
"How do you spell your last name again?"
or "My name rhymes with Peremy Pes
mon, what does your name rhyme with?"
Also listen for clever, diversionary strate
gies such as "Hey, can you say your name
five times fast?"
•Namenesiacs also seek out forms of
identification, with such lines as "Hey, can
I see your student ID?" or "I've never seen
a California driver's license before, could I
see yours?" or "Hey, can I look at your
credit card for a while?" This last tactic is
also used by criminals, so be sure that you
can distinguish between your friends who
have this serious psychological problem

and your friends who are criminals.
namenesiacs tend to hide
their diseases from their families as well, if
an immediate family member of yours has
not said your name in. say, three years or
more, he she may be a quiet victim of
namenesia. Untreated namenesia can only
get worse, so don't be afraid to seek pro
fessional help
Namenesia is a serious problem, and
since name-tag laws were found unconsti
tutional in the '30s, there does not seem to
be a solution to this problem The only
thing you can do is be supportive If you
see our hypothetical friend Jeremy dodg
ing your name, help him out. Tell him that
you understand his affliction. Tell him
that you are supportive.
And then tell him your name, just in
case.

*Jeremy is not hin real name.
