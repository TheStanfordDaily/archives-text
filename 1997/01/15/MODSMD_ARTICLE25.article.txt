Silicon chips speed genetic studies

Researchers at the School of Medicine and at
Asymetrix, a Santa Clara biotechnology company,
have developed a new technique that makes genet
ic research faster and cheaper.
Using "Gene Chip" — a small, thumbnail-sized
silicon chip capable of carrying hundreds of thou
sands of I)NA segments — scientists hope to accel
erate current scientific research in the fields of

genetics and medicine.
The Stanford researchers, along with an international consor
tium of 15 laboratories, are currently labeling genes with special
I)NA tags, which can be read by Gene Chip like molecular bar - codes.
Using Gene Chip, scientists can test 6,000 genes in just two hours, a
process that took much longer using older technology.
Biochemistry Prof. Ronald Davis said in a press release that the
new technology will aid in disease diagnosis, basic biological
research and the search for new drugs to fight infections.

SOHO leads to positioning of solar dynamo

While most recognize SOHO as a hip neighbor
hood in New York City, Stanford researchers have
used special equipment placed aboard the Solar
and Heliosperic Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft to
pinpoint the position of the solar dynamo.
Finally answering the mystery of the origin of
the sun's strong magnetic fields, or solar dynamo,
Stanford's solar oscillations investigation team

released its results at a December news conference. The team
showed the solar dynamo to be a layer 38.000 miles thick, located
135,000 miles below the solar surface.
The SOHO spacecraft is a joint venture of the European Space
Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
SOHO was launched in December 1995 and is currently taking mea
surements and readings from the sun while in solar orbit.
Four months of observations allowed the Stanford team to pin
point the location of the solar dynamo, which has caused much con
tention among solar physicists since the 19705.
"Understanding the solar dynamo is extremely important to our
overall understanding of the sun's behavior," the principal investi
gator, Physics Research Prof. Philip Scherrer, said in a statement.
"With these new data we can look forward to a rapid increase in our
understanding of this key feature."

Hlaek holes — a prediction verified

The discovery of a new black hole announced
Monday at the annual meeting of the American
Astronomical Society in Toronto brings to light
predictions made by Physics Prof. Robert Wag
oner. With a 07 Hertz peak in the power spec
trum, the black hole bears a unique signature con
sistent with the predictions of three years ago.
The powerful gravitational forces of a black
hole are strong enough to swallow matter, includ-

ing light. Before being swallowed, gravitational forces cause matter
to flatten into a disk shape, known as an accretion disk.
"Our work predicts oscillations of this gaseous accretion disk
near the black hole. These oscillations modulate the X-rays which
are emitted from the accretion disk, at a characteristic frequency
which depends essentially only on the mass and spin of the black
hole," Wagoner said.
"Recent observations of two of these black hole candidates have
revealed a peak in the power spect rum of X-ray luminosity variations
consistent with the predictions of our diskoseismology calculations.
"We hope to see more modes of oscillations in future observations
which would allow us to provide confirmation of this model if we see
other modes of oscillations," he said.
