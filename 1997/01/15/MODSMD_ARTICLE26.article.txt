# Finding elves in the sky
## Scientists observe phenomenon in atmosphere 
### Daniel Wan 
Last July, Stanford scientists
traveled to Ft. Collins, Colo., in
search of elves. First observed bv
pilots and shuttle astronauts,
these elves are not creatures of
folklore but rather strange flashes
of red light that occur high above
thunderstorms.
They are produced by powerful
electromagnetic pulses generated
by lightning strokes in the tropo
sphere, the lowest layer of the
Earth's atmosphere.
Electromagnetic pulses first
came to the public's attention
when scientists realized that
nuclear explosions could produce
electromagnetic waves strong
enough to damage unshielded elec
tronic equipment. Although these
pulses are much weaker than
those generated by a bomb blast,
they do have enough energy to cre
ate the optical effects of celestial
fireworks.
Electromagnetic pulses propa
gate spherically upward and radi
ally outward at the speed of light
until they reach the ionosphere,
the outermost layer of the Earth's
atmosphere, said Electrical Engi

neering Prof. Umran Inan.
The first part of the pulse to hit
the ionosphere forms a small ring
above the lightning stroke, causing
nitrogen atoms to become excited
and glow red for less than a mil
lisecond. This ring-like structure
continues to expand as portions of
the electromagnetic pulse that
travel longer and longer distances
strike the ionosphere. Occurring at
altitudes ranging from 55 to 60
miles, elves can form rings as wide
as 200 miles.
"The ring lappears to expand I
faster than the speed of light for
the same reason that waves, when
striking the beach at an angle,
seem to travel along the shore at a
faster speed than the waves mov
ing through the water." Inan
explained.
Because of their ephemeral
nature, elves are difficult to detect.
They are too brief to register on
video cameras, which have a time
resolution of about 16 millisec
onds.
It wasn't even until a few years
ago that a Japanese team of scien
tists produced the first direct evi
dence that elves existed by using a
photometer designed to detect sub

millisecond light flashes in the
upper atmosphere. To elucidate
the structure and dynamics of this
phenomena, a new method of
observing elves had to be devel
oped by Inan and his team.
Looking across theCreat Plains
at thunderstorms nearly 150 miles
away, the Stanford team was able
to observe the life cycle and
dynamics of these elusive elves
with a special device named the
Fly's Eye.
This instrument consists of a
dozen 18-inch barrels, each
equipped with a highly sensitive
light detector pointing to a differ
ent part of the sky. With a time
resolution of 30 microseconds, the
Fly's Eye was able to record the
development and motion of elves
with very high spatial and tempo
ral resolution.
Chris Barrington-Leigh. an
applied physics doctoral student
who oversaw the design and con
struction of the Fly's Eye, stressed
the importance of studying these
elves because they help "to eluci
date the energv coupling between
the troposphere and ionosphere"

and demonstrate how different re
gions in the atmosphere affect each
other.
"For a long time we have known
that certain events in the upper
reaches of the atmosphere, such as
solar storms, can affect the lower
atmosphere, with significant con
sequences like power blackouts,"

I nan said "Now we are learning
that events in the lower atmos
phere can affect the upper atmos
phere. As about 1,000 lightning
strokes occur each minute around
the world, it is not unlikely these ef
fects may have a global impact on
the atmosphere."
Exactly how these elves affect
t he atmosphere is still unclear. One
idea suggests that these flashes of
light may actually affect upper at
mospheric chemistry.
Because elves cause electrons in

the ionosphere to be heated to en
ergies well above their normal lev
els, the rates of chemical reactions
that occur in that region might be
affected.
"It is thus possible that thunder
storms may have long-term influ
ences on the chemistry of the ionos
phere," I nan said.
Irian and his team will return to
Colorado this summer to make
more measurements of this natural
phenomenon, hoping one day to
use elves to study the ionosphere.
