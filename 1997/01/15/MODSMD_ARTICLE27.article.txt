# Migraine gene offers clues to disabling headaches
## 
### Evelyn Strauss 
An international team of scien
tists has identified a gene associat
ed with a serious form of migraine.
Peter Oefner, a senior research
associate in the Biochemistry
Department, found defects in the
disease-causing DNA, revealing
that the molecule underlying this
disorder allows important signal
ing molecules into brain cells.
"I think this is fantastic," said
Lydia Kiger, acting director of
Stanford's outpatient neurology

clinics. "We've been looking for
pathophysiologic mechanisms of
migraine for a long time. We've
gotten little bits and pieces, and
we've found some genetic associa
tions. But studying a migraine
gene should lead to significantly
better understanding and better
treatments."
Researchers, clinicians and
patients have long suspected that
migraines run in families. Howev
er, the genetic basis of this dis
abling disorder has eluded scien
tists, most likely because
migraines probably result from a
complex mixture of genetic and
environmental factors.
In the Nov. 1 issue of the jour
nal Cell, researchers described
how they isolated a gene linked to
a serious but rare disorder, famil
ial hemiplegic migraine (FHM>.
People with FHM develop weak
ness on one side of the body before
or during the headache.
The scientists knew that sever
al other hereditary neurological
diseases were associated with
defects in ion channels, or
molecules that control the flow of
salts into cells. They also had
already found that the gene for
FHM resides in a particular area
of human chromosome 19.
Because of this, they zeroed in
on that neighborhood of the
genome and tried to find a gene
used as a blueprint for making an
ion channel. They found one that
contains instructions for a
molecule that regulates the flow of
calcium into brain cells.
The question then was whether
this gene is defective in people
with FHM. Oefner discovered par
ticular changes in the DNA of
affected individuals that did not
exist in their healthy relatives or
unrelated controls.
The next challenge will be to
figure out exactly how the defec
tive channels are misbehaving.

Oefner explained. Both he and
Phyllis (lardner. an associate pro
fessor of molecular pharmacology
and medicine, say it makes sense
that a defective calcium channel
would result in neurological prob
lems.
"Calcium is particularly impor
tant in excitable cells, like nerve,
heart, smooth and skeletal mus
cles," Gardner said. "Allowing cal-

cium into a cell can lead to
particular events —

muscle contraction,
for example.

"In the case

of migraines
it all

b ecnmes
clear.

Migraine
is a case of
abno r m a 1
contraction
and then relax

at ion in cerebral
blood vessels," Gard
ner ex-plained. "So if
you've got a mutation in
a gene that encodes a cal-

cium channel in the brain,
the process of smooth nius-

cle contraction may be altered in a
way thai can lead to these severe
headaches. This would l>e exactly
what you'd expect for a gene that
causes a migraine.

"This might lead to a drug
that's specifically targeted to an
abnormality in the channel," she
continued. "That would be nice
because such a drug would be
directed at the primary defect
instead of all the secondary symp
toms like the drugs that are avail
able now." *
This approach would not be

possible without knowing the
identity of the gene.
Because many of the symptoms
of FHM art 1 similar to those of
other forms of migraine, Oefner

said he believes studying the gene
will help researchers understand
the causes of the more typical

migraine. Furthermore,
'although the report did not

examine the genetic basis of

common migraines, he thinks it
is likely that the same gene

will be involved.
"For more common tvpes

of migraine, the answer is still

out." he said. "Right now the data

to indicate that in at least
50 percent of cases of the more

common forms of migraine, the

same gene may be involved.
That still has to be proven."

Future research will focus
on proving that. "Some-

time early next year we'll
analyze an additional
2(H) patients and con-

trol individuals that
have more common
forms of migraine
and see if we find
mutations in this
gene," Oefner said.
But Genetics
Prof. Neil Risch
cautioned
against prema
ture conclusions.
"The data for com
mon migraine are
not very impres
sive, M he said.
"According to data
that have been pub
lished to date, there is
not strong evidence
for a role for this gene

in common migraine.
"Unlike FHM, it's very com
mon and it has a complex inheri
tance pattern, which means that
it's not due to a single gene," Risch
said. "It's likely to be due to a vari
ety of genetic and environmental
factors. It's not at all clear yet
what the relevance of this hemi
plegic migraine gene is for com
mon migraine."
