# Jell-0 wiggle and jiggle and colloid?

QJs Jell-0 a solid or a liq
.uid?
A .When you were a wee
â€¢ kid, your grade-school
teacher probably taught you
that the three states of matter
were solid, liquid and gas.
And, as everyone knows,
everything you learned in
kindergarten is correct, so
Jell-O has to fit into one of
those categories, right?
At first, you might think
that Jell-0 was a solid. It
holds its shape pretty well, so
you might be inclined to call it
a solid and wolf it down with
no further thought.
But if you think a little
longer about it, Jell-0 just
doesn't seem to conform to
what one would think a solid
should be like. And if you
think even longer, it seems
that a lot of stuff just doesn't
really fit neatly into those
three categories.
For instance. Silly Putty is
liquid when you stretch it and
solid when you throw it
against a hard object. So
where does Jell-O fit into the
grand scheme of things?
Well, it turns out that the
world just isn 't as simple as it
was in kindergarten. The
three states of matter are use
ful for describing pure chemi
cal substances, but even then
there are problems.
In fact, not many people
agree about what the "states
of matter" are anymore. You
may have heard about the
"fourth state of matter,"
namely plasma, and gone
back and gloated in front of
your grade-school teacher
about how wrong he or she
was. as I did.
Anyway, Jell-O is not a
pure chemical substance.
There is no single Jell-0
molecule, which you can gath
er a whole bunch of and make
a mass of Jell-O.
Instead. Jell-0 is actually a
mixture of two substances,
gelatin and water. Gelatin is
derived from collagen, a type
of protein found in skin and
bones which forms long,
stringy fibers. However, when
gelatin is mixed with water
and heated, as the directions
on the side of the box tell you
to do, the proteins get disor
dered and can no longer keep
their nice and tidy arrange
ment.
In the boiled state, the
gelatin and water mix form a
fluid colloid, called a sol. This
means that the mixture is
actually a liquid with very
tiny bits of solid distributed
throughout.
The solid is so finely scat
tered throughout the liquid
that it doesn't settle to the
bottom like small rocks
would. However, the mixture
is not a solution, because the
particles can still be physical
ly separated from the liquid.
Technically, Jell-0 in the
heated state is a hydrosol,
because it is a colloid made of
solid in water. Given that, you
can probably figure out what
an aerosol is.
When the mixture cools,
things become stranger yet.
The gelatin tries to reform
into the nice orderly structure
of collagen, but it can't even
come close.
Instead of forming into
long fibers by lining the pro
teins up properly, the gelatin
just attaches itself to whatev
er other proteins strands
come along. Eventually, you
end up with a huge,
unordered network of pro
teins branching out all over
the place, trapping water
molecules inside.
This mess is not really
either a solid or a liquid. More
appropriately, it is called a
gel, and that is what Jell-O
really is.
1 can't wait to go back to
my elementary school tomor
row and gloat about this one.
