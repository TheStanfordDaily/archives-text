## Azzi takes ABL charge Playing ability only touches surface 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
Ask Jennifer Azzi the way to
San Jose, and she'll probably
tell you it takes five years in
Europe, one year touring the
world with the nation's best, a
gold medal-winning Olympic
performance, a little luck and a
certain amount of fate.
At least that's the path the
former Stanford basketball
standout took to reach her cur
rent position as a member of the
San Jose Lasers in their inaugu
ral season as one of eight
women's professional teams in
the American Basketball
League.
But after a whirlwind year
with the national team, Azzi
now finds herself in a position
she's never been in her entire
basketball career — out for the
season with injury.
"If there were one player we
would've chosen not to be
injured, it's her," said league co
founder Gary Cavalli. "She's
been so instrumental in devel
oping the league and giving us
input."
But the consummate over
achiever, who calls herself spiri
tual rather than religious and
says she believes "things hap
pen for a reason," is now a
month ahead of schedule in her
rehabilitation and could possi
bly come back if the Lasers
make the playoffs.
"It's really painful," Azzi
said of rehab. "I can see how
some people don't want to come
back. It's made me think about
what I'll do after [basketball|."
For now Azzi's contributions
to her team and the league have
taken on a different role, but
her experience at being involved
in a league in its infancy is
invaluable nonetheless. In fact,
the 28-year-old Oak Ridge,
Tenn., native has made a habit
of turning improbable dreams
into overnight successes, start
ing with her four years at Stan
ford.
"I really enjoyed that part,"
Azzi said of her career at Stan
ford. "I've been a part of a lot of
new things, and I've been lucky
to have that. I could jump into
the league 10 years from now
and make a million dollars, but
I'd rather come in now" and
have a direct impact on the
league.
Azzi came to Stanford in fall
1986 as one of the gems of head
coach Tara VanDerveer's first
recruiting class, and once here
she helped turn Stanford's pro
gram into the national power
house it is todav. Bv her senior

year, Azzi and company had
become what most consider to
be the best Stanford team ever,
putting together a 32-1 record
and winning the school's first
national championship practi
cally in Azzi's backyard.
"There was no doubt in my
mind we'd win by my senior
year," Azzi said. "I even wrote it
in a journal when I was a fresh
man. If you work that hard
you're bound to win. There was
some luck, too. We didn't have
any injuries. I believe in fate."
It may have been fate, but
without Azzi's family it never
would have happened. Azzi. an
economics major at Stanford,
said it was her parents who
"made" her go to Stanford.
"I didn't even know where
Stanford was," Azzi said. "They
had more of a vision than I did.
I knew that I wanted to go there
because they'd never steer me
wrong. I made them think it
was my decision."
And what a decision it was.
Azzi's name is painted all over
the Stanford record books, and
in 1990 she became the only
Cardinal basketball player to
ever win the Naismith Player of
the Year award.
"She's a very hard worker
and brings a lot of energy to a

team," VanDerveer said. "She
brought a lot of spark [to our
team) and really made everyone
around her better with her
work ethic. She's a winner in
just who she is. She's a great
person and has compassion for
people. She's very caring. Our
world needs more Jennifers."
In the seven years since she
left Stanford Azzi's career has
carried her all over the world.
She spent five seasons playing
professionally in Sweden, Italy
and France before spending all
of last year playing for Van-
Derveer on the L T .S. National
Team.
That team pulverized the top
collegiate squads in the country
and manhandled international
competition en route to a 52-0
record and Olympic gold in
Atlanta. But perhaps more
importantly, the team elevated
the standard of dominance in
women's basketball and served
as a springboard for the new
professional leagues.
"We blew away every college
team we played," Azzi said. "We
showed people there's a differ
ent level land gavel people a
new respect for the game It was
so intense for a whole vear and
