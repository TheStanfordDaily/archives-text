# Service groups thrive
## Haas Center programs make most of two 2-year grants from Surdna and U.S. Dept. of Education

Planted with the seeds of grants from the
Surdna Foundation and the U.S. Depart
ment of Education, two Haas Center pro
grams have flourished by increasing interac
tion both within the campus community ser
vice groups and among educational institu
tions.
Last January, the center received a pair
of two-year grants, one for $160,000 from
the Surdna Foundation and one for
$118,000 from the Department of Educa
tion's Fund for the Improvement of Post-
Secondary Education.
The Surdna Foundation grant opened
communication between staff and student
members from different service groups, ac
cording to Nadinne Cruz, the center's associ
ate director.
"We learned that before tackling the 'big
differences' — racial, ideological — it's the
many little things that stand in the way,
Isuch as| the demands on time and groups
not having a chance to see each other," Cruz
said.
She added that the center sought to create
a comfort level and a web of connections
among campus groups, which may have con

flicting ideologies.
Groups with the same goals may be
stymied by poor communication, which could
result in lost requests for help from the out
side community. Toward that end, staff
members have met to ensure guidelines for
referrals between groups, Cruz said.
Instead of following a rigid, prescribed
plan, the center exercised flexibility in filling
gaps caused by lack of communication, trust
and understanding, she said.
Created in response to those needs, the
Hub Uniform Board — funded by the grant
— brings together a diverse group ol seniors
to develop ways to unify various service
groups and to work out issues of resources
and space. Sara Sperling, who earned a mas
ter's degree in education from Stanford in
June, was hired half-time last year to act as a
contact point for the board.
"We wanted to act as an invisible hand and
to offer a structure thut would allow students
to get acquainted," Cruz said.
Such student initiatives included a meet
ing of different campus-wide HIV AIDS ser
vice groups and a service day in East Palo
Alto, Cruz said.
