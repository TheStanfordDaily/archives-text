# Service groups thrive
## Haas Center programs make most of two 2-year grants from Surdna and U.S. Dept. of Education 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
Planted with the seeds of grants from the
Surdna Foundation and the U.S. Depart
ment of Education, two Haas Center pro
grams have flourished by increasing interac
tion both within the campus community ser
vice groups and among educational institu
tions.
Last January, the center received a pair
of two-year grants, one for $160,000 from
the Surdna Foundation and one for
$118,000 from the Department of Educa
tion's Fund for the Improvement of Post-
Secondary Education.
The Surdna Foundation grant opened
communication between staff and student
members from different service groups, ac
cording to Nadinne Cruz, the center's associ
ate director.
"We learned that before tackling the 'big
differences' — racial, ideological — it's the
many little things that stand in the way,
Isuch as| the demands on time and groups
not having a chance to see each other," Cruz
said.
She added that the center sought to create
a comfort level and a web of connections
among campus groups, which may have con

flicting ideologies.
Groups with the same goals may be
stymied by poor communication, which could
result in lost requests for help from the out
side community. Toward that end, staff
members have met to ensure guidelines for
referrals between groups, Cruz said.
Instead of following a rigid, prescribed
plan, the center exercised flexibility in filling
gaps caused by lack of communication, trust
and understanding, she said.
Created in response to those needs, the
Hub Uniform Board — funded by the grant
— brings together a diverse group ol seniors
to develop ways to unify various service
groups and to work out issues of resources
and space. Sara Sperling, who earned a mas
ter's degree in education from Stanford in
June, was hired half-time last year to act as a
contact point for the board.
"We wanted to act as an invisible hand and
to offer a structure thut would allow students
to get acquainted," Cruz said.
Such student initiatives included a meet
ing of different campus-wide HIV AIDS ser
vice groups and a service day in East Palo
Alto, Cruz said.
The other grant awarded to the center
last .year went to exploring issues
in community service teaching
and learning.
Based upon the diverse demo
graphics of each school, Stanford in
vited ('a! State-Monterey Bay, Mills
College and Portland State Univer
sity to participate in conferences,
said Haas Center Director Timothy
Stanton. Faculty and staff repre
sentatives met on a quarterly basis.
"We've found that service learn
ing is contextuali/ed hy its settings
and values," Stanton said. These
different perspectives broadened
and enriched their discussions, In
added.
For example, Stanford — a re
search-oriented, suburban institu
tion — focused on implementing
service programs in its existing
curriculum, while Portland State
a metropolitan public school
developed required courses that
built community partnerships,

Stanton said. However, both
schools have gained insight on the
development of a community-sub
ject review.
Research on campus must al
ready undergo review before
human subjects may be used; mov
ing it into the community raises
new concerns related to compli
ance, Stanton said.
Several Stanford programs have
benefited from the conferences.
The Public Service Scholars Pro
gram gives students an opportunity
to create an honors thesis project
that combines academic rigor with
value to the community, Stanton
said.
The students in the multidisci
plinary program that have evalu
ated a prison project in San Fran
cisco. looked at the effect of the
Olympics on homelessness in At
lanta and examined licensing pro
cedures for small businesses,
Stanton said.
In addition, Stanford faculty in
terested in service learning attend
ed a three-day institute in Septem
ber.

Following the institute, Com
munications Teaching Prof.
Kristin Samuelson said she want
ed to give her film production
classes an opportunity to create
short films for community groups.
"Students can go beyond Stan
ford to bring the world into their
media," Samuelson said.
The consortium is also planning
a cross-institutional research pro
ject on students committed to pub
lic service.
"So far in our conferences,
we've examined discrete, program
matic experiences, such as the pub
lic service scholars," Stanton said.
"We'd like to focus on the students'
experience over four years to see
what connections are made and
where, between academics and ser
vice."
The group's collaborative ap
proach has earned the interest and
intrigue of the sponsor, which sent
an evaluator to the conference.
"Traditionally, it's one school,
sharing their wisdom with others,"
Stanton said. "Our group is multi
directional and co-consulting."
