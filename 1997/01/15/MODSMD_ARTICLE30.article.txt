Ultimate frisbee shares many
things in common with the more
familiar sports. Like football,
the object of the game is to catch
the disc in your opponent's end
zone. Like basketball, players
make cuts in order to get open.
Like soccer, players run and run
and run.
However, several things dis
tinguish Ultimate frisbee from
other sports. One is the "Spirit
of the Game," a clause in the
official rule book that addresses
sportsmanship. Flayers of the
more familiar sports would be
surprised to learn that I Iti mate
frisbee games are self-officiated;
there are no referees and play
ers call their own fouls. Having
a sense of humor is another
important part of playing Ulti
mate frisbee. Also, "in Ultimate,
the more random, the better,"
according to senior Abby
Hoover.
People might also be pleas
antly surprised to learn that the
men and women's Ultimate
teams are heading to Santa Bar
bara this weekend for the Santa
Barbara Classic Tournament.
This will be their first tourney
of the season. This is "always a
tentative tournament," said
Hoover, "since half of the time it
is canceled because it is during
the rainy season.
A tournament had been
scheduled last quarter to be held
in Santa Cruz but had to be can
celed due to weather conditions
Since then, cuts have been
made, and now the men have an
A team and a B team. The
women have also divided into

the Superfly and the Z-team. All
four teams will compete in this
upcoming tournament.
Senior Christian Dodge, co
captain of the men's team,
expects the playing fields to be
wet and slippery. Surprisingly,
these are welcome conditions. It
is "fun to play in the mud,"
Dodge said, and it leads to "dirty
and gritty competition, which is
what we like."
Other schools that will com
pete in the Santa Barbara Clas
sic are UC-Santa Barbara, UC-
San Diego, Occidental, Cal Poly-
San Luis Obispo, Berkeley, UC-
Davis and UC-Santa Cruz. Stan
ford competed in this same tour
nament last season, and the
men's A team lost to Santa Bar
bara, the eventual national
champion, in the finals.
The men's team expects to
play a whopping five games on
Saturday, each game lasting
between 75 and 90 minutes. On
Sunday, the team members may
again play five games, depend
ing on their record. The women
have four games planned for
Saturday and, depending on
their record, will play two to
four games Sunday.
The women had a very good
turnout this year. About half the
Superfly are returning players,
and Hoover attributes this to
the good social atmosphere sur
rounding Ultimate frisbee. They
are well-coached by Jennifer
Donnelly and captained by
Hoover and junior Andrea John
son Other top returning players
are senior Dominique
Fontenette, doctoral student
Lena Ting, junior Maggie Math
ias, junior Martita Embe, sopho
more Mary Hunt Martin, junior
Joy Chen and junior Leslie
McArron.
The men's A team has 19
players. Co-captain senior Jim
Schoettler, graduate student
Mike Payne and Dodge are
strong players, and the team is
also lucky to have some younger
stars like sophomore Scott John
ston, junior Alex Young and the
sole freshman, Jon Zalisk.
The men's team has a new
offense this year which they
cleverly named Quantum ().

This offense is "based on the
quantum mechanical model of
the atom." In the same way you
can't "locate the exact location
of atoms" at any given time, the
players don't have predeter
mined locations, either. As for
defense, the team will almost
always play man-to-man.
Many Ultimate frisbee play
ers were athletes before joining
the team, but because they
couldn't play their sport at the
college level or because of
injuries or simply a desire to try
something new, they joined the
Ultimate frisbee team. Also,
many people are attracted to
Ultimate frisbee because the
team "takes competition as seri
ously as anyone else, but takes
the community seriously, too,"
Dodge said.
