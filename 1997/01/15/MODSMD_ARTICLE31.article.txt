# Robin clears up muddled Pac-10 race
## 
### 
OK sports fans, it's winter again and
that means just one thing — BAS
KE'I BALL and lots of it.
If you're anything like me, your Saturday
mornings (and afternoons) revolve around
college hoops. You know who you are. You
take over your dorm lounge and refuse to
move (except for that halftime dash to the
dining hall for brunch), and you've already
started to get that lightheaded, heart-pound
ing feeling you attribute to March Madness.
But we've got to back up for just a minute
and remember that it's only January. Right
now those conference battles are just getting
good, and we shouldn't overlook them in our
desire to fast forward to the tournament.

Everyone I talk to seems to know about the
Pacific 10 Conference from top to bottom on
the men's side but get a little confused when
asked about the women's side, so I've taken it
upon myself to enlighten those of you with
any interest as to just how the women stack
up. So here goes, my very own Pac-10 run
down on who's the best, the worst or just
somewhere in between.
1. Stanford Ves, this was pretty obvious.
Stanford happens to be the only nationally
ranked team in the conference, although Ore
gon, Arizona, USC and UCLA all got votes
(OK, UCLA only got one vote). Granted.
Stanford has beaten all but one of these four
teams <the Card faces Oregon tomorrow), and
only USC was able to keep it close. Right now
it looks like Stanford > biggest opponent in
the conference is Stanford — namely injuries,
foul trouble and turnovers. All three haunted
the Card in its one-point win over USC.
which goes to show that nothing is set in
stone. Final conference record — 18-0.
2. Arizona Despite the advice of' women's
basketball radio gurus, I'm going to pick Ari
zona over Oregon for the No. 2 spot in the
conference. The Wildcats are 12-2 with their
losses coming from two of the best teams in
the country, Stanford and Louisiana Tech
(the loss was before the New Orleans thing).
Arizona was overlooked by the NCAA selec
tion committee last year and proceeded to
win the NWIT. Don't expect them to be over
looked again this year. Next big matchup
— USC this weekend.

3. Oregon The Ducks are still
undefeated in the conference,
but that should change Thurs
day night at Maples Pavilion.
Oregon handled Oregon State
and Washington State with east
but only beat Washington by
seven at home. The Ducks are
10-2 overall with losses coming
at the hands of Georgia and
lowa State and should make the
NCAA tournament for the
fourth year in a row. Incidental
ly, the matchup with Stanford
will be Oregon's first conference
road game. Final words — Not
undefeated for long.
4. USC Any team that takes Stan
ford down to the wire deserves a
little credit. Granted, the Cardinal
was down two starters and got into
an awful lot of foul trouble, but if
the Women of Troy continue to
play the way they did against the
Card, this team just might make
the tourney. It's a long way to
March, though, so we'll just have
to wait and see what develops for
this squad. Early indicator —
how the trip to Arizona this
weekend goes.
5. Washington The 7-6 record
posted by the Huskies thus far
doesn't fully represent the team's
potential. Washington's two con
ference losses were to USC (by one
at the buzzer) and Oregon (by
seven at Eugene), and the four
nonconference losses were to top
-20 teams. Washington should beat
the teams ranked below it in the
conference and may even sneak in
a win that it probably shouldn't
get. My advice — hope that
home-court advantage pays
off.
6. UCLA UCLA got off to its best
start since the 1991-92 season but
is currently 8-5 (2-2 Pac-10) with
its only conference win coming
over Washington State and a
pathetic California team in L.A.
This is definitely not the same
team that played Stanford a close
ballgame at Maples last year, and
the Bruins should settle into the
top of the bottom half of the con
ference On a positive note — at
least the women didn't get
completely humiliated by

Stanford (unlike the men).
7. Cal Cal has an ugly 5-8 record
and doesn't look to have a pretty
year. Cal is out of the cellar for
now, however, with an 89-58 win
over Arizona State. But the Wee
nies have been blown off the court
by San Francisco and Arizona this
year. On the bright side, Cal only
lost to UCIA by nine in a rare
matchup at the Wooden Center in
LA. Final note — what can I
say, I'm still trying to remem
ber Big Game.
8. Oregon State It hurts me to
talk about this team. OSU
wasn't too shabby last year and
even boasted co-Pac-10 player of
the year Tanja Kostic. But let's
face it, the Beavers are not the
same team they were a year ago
just about everybody's gone.
My prediction — it's going to
be a long year for the

Beavers.
9. Washington State VVSU is 5-7
on the year and have conference
losses to Oregon, USC and UCLA.
The Cougars were even blown out
at Oregon State, which says a lot,
and they miss current Laser
bench-warmer Jenni Huff as much
as everybody said they would. My
prediction — it's going to be a
long year for the Cougars.
10. Arizona State Sorry, Sun
Devils, you're dead last according
to my calculations. Despite a 7-7
record, ASU doesn't have much
hope. The Cougars have yet to get
that first win in the Pac-10, and
Cal even beat these guys by a bun
dle. Suggestion — pray really
hard.

able athletic abilities, Beppo also
