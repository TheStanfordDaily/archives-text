# Robin clears up muddled Pac-10 race
## 
### 
OK sports fans, it's winter again and
that means just one thing — BAS
KE'I BALL and lots of it.
If you're anything like me, your Saturday
mornings (and afternoons) revolve around
college hoops. You know who you are. You
take over your dorm lounge and refuse to
move (except for that halftime dash to the
dining hall for brunch), and you've already
started to get that lightheaded, heart-pound
ing feeling you attribute to March Madness.
But we've got to back up for just a minute
and remember that it's only January. Right
now those conference battles are just getting
good, and we shouldn't overlook them in our
desire to fast forward to the tournament.

Everyone I talk to seems to know about the
Pacific 10 Conference from top to bottom on
the men's side but get a little confused when
asked about the women's side, so I've taken it
upon myself to enlighten those of you with
any interest as to just how the women stack
up. So here goes, my very own Pac-10 run
down on who's the best, the worst or just
somewhere in between.
1. Stanford Ves, this was pretty obvious.
Stanford happens to be the only nationally
ranked team in the conference, although Ore
gon, Arizona, USC and UCLA all got votes
(OK, UCLA only got one vote). Granted.
Stanford has beaten all but one of these four
teams <the Card faces Oregon tomorrow), and
only USC was able to keep it close. Right now
it looks like Stanford > biggest opponent in
the conference is Stanford — namely injuries,
foul trouble and turnovers. All three haunted
the Card in its one-point win over USC.
which goes to show that nothing is set in
stone. Final conference record — 18-0.
2. Arizona Despite the advice of' women's
basketball radio gurus, I'm going to pick Ari
zona over Oregon for the No. 2 spot in the
conference. The Wildcats are 12-2 with their
losses coming from two of the best teams in
the country, Stanford and Louisiana Tech
(the loss was before the New Orleans thing).
Arizona was overlooked by the NCAA selec
tion committee last year and proceeded to
win the NWIT. Don't expect them to be over
looked again this year. Next big matchup
— USC this weekend.
