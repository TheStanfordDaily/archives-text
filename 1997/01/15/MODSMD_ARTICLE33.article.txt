Women's basketball
Junior forward Vanessa
Nygaard underwent arthro
scopic knee surgery yesterday
to repair meniscus damage to
her right knee. She sustained
the injury in the second half of
Friday's 74-62 victory at
UCLA. The 6-foot-1 starting
small forward is expected to
miss around four weeks.
Senior Charmin Smith will
likely benefit most from
Nygaard's absence and move
into the starting role.
Nygaard had been averag
ing 12.3 points and 7.5
rebounds per game prior to
the setback, good for third
and second respectively on the
squad. The shooter had been
mired in a long slump, miss
ing her last 10 three-point
attempts and 31 of her last 36,
but her rebounding and long
distance capability have made
her an indispensable cog in
the Cardinal machine.
Three years ago Nygaard
tore the anterior cruiciate lig
ament in the same knee and
was forced to redshirt.
