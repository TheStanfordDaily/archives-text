Freshmen entering college this fall were more com
munity service-minded than ever before and are in
creasingly conservative on a number of social issues,
according to a new survey.
The survey, released this week by the Higher Edu
cation Research Institute at UCLA's Graduate School
of Education, has been conducted annually since
1965. It is one of the most comprehensive assess
ments of attitudes and plans of entering college stu
dents.
This year's survey included 354,853 students from
709 two- and four-year colleges. The data was then ad
justed statistically to represent 1.5 million full-time
students entering college nationwide.
Stanford's freshman class participated in the sur
vey for the 24th year.
According to the survey, a record 38.4 percent of
college freshmen, compared to 60 percent of Stanford
freshmen, spent an hour or more a week doing com
munity service work during their senior year in high
school.
Linda Sax. assistant education professor at L'CLA
and associate director of the survey, suggested that
this trend is a result of "local and national efforts to
encourage community service involvement.
The survey also revealed that college students are
more worried than ever about financing their educa
tion and achieving good grades. This concern may be
correlated to the fact that a record 66.3 percent of stu
dents surveyed plan to earn graduate or advanced pro
fessional degrees.
The survey indicated that nationally there has been
an increasing interest in careers in medicine and

teaching and a declining interest in business and law.
Meanwhile, the Stanford statistics indicated that
there are more aspiring doctors <21.4 percent at Stan
ford as opposed to 6.4 percent nationally) and lawyers
than the national average would suggest. In addition,
there were fewer than average future businessmen
and teachers entering Stanford
In npite of the fact that 1996 was a presidential elec
tion year, only 29.4 percent of freshmen nationwide
viewed political awareness as "very important" or "es
sential This nationwide figure is lower than in any
previous presidential election year since the survey's
inception.
While students do not appear to be more conserva
tive politically, the survey indicated that social views
are becoming more conservative. In the past five
years, students have become les> likely to support le
galized abortion and less likely to believe that casual
sex is acceptable.
StanfordV figures varied from the national aver
age- About f>B percent of Stanford 112 reshmen viewed
political awareness as "very important" or "essential."
In addition, whereas 56.3 percent of students nation
ally supported legal abortions. 7H.4 percent of Stan
ford first-years did
Conversely, fewer Stanford students felt that casu
al sex is acceptable, with 61 percent of Stanford stu
dents strongly objecting to casual sex as compared to
58.4 percent nationwide Whereas 42.6 percent of
Stanford freshmen considered themselves liberal,
only 24.6 percent did nationwide
According to Sax. the purpose of the survey was to
obtain an idea of the interests of college students today
and to provide each participating college with data
that compares the interests and concerns of its stu
dents with national norms.
