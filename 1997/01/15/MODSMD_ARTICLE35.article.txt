# TVC program enters 2nd year
## 
### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
In its second year, the Technology Ventures Co
op Program — a program in the School of Engi
neering designed to give students real-world expe
rience in their fields — has opened its doors to in
clude engineering seniors in its applicant pool.
According to the program's World Wide Web
site, the program was formed "in response to
today's changing industrial environment. It is a
work-study program that selects and matches out
standing Stanford engineering students for paid
summer work assignments in start-up companies."
Participants also take a sequence of supple
mental courses in managing technology ventures
while in the program.
Because of its experimental nature in its inau
gural year, eligibility for participation in the pro
gram was initially limited to engineering cotermi
nal students. This year, the program has been ex
panded to include seniors who "for one reason or
another will remain at Stanford until at least De
cember of this year . . . and plan to graduate from
Stanford by the end of spring quarter 1998," said
Assoc. Industrial Engineering Consulting Prof.
Thomas Byers, who also serves as the director of
the program
Last year, about 10 students out of several
dozen who applied were accepted into the pro
gram, according to Byers, who also said, "We want

to keep the program in the spirit of small under
graduate classes."
Engineering-economic systems and operations
research coterminal student Heleen Kist, a new
teaching assistant for the program, said the re
sponses from the 1996 participants were "wonder
fully positive."
"The TVC program is like studying abroad
without ever leaving Stanford," said one, comput
er science coterminal student Mauria Einley. "In
TVC, I had the opportunity to round out my engi
neering education. In the classroom I learned
about business, and in my internship I got to ex
perience it firsthand.
"Being a TVC fellow has been one of the high
lights of my engineering education at Stanford."
she added.
An information session concerning the pro
gram will be held in Room 134 of Green Library at
5:15 tonight.
According to Byers, "This information session
will be a good chance for people interested in the
program to meet other people" who have already
participated in the program.
He also said it would be a chance for people to
ask any questions about the program.
Applications for the program are due Jan. 31.
