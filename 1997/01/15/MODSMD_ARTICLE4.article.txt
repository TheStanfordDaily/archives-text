# ASSU Senate offers view on burden of proof
## Senators want to keep standard 'at beyond a reasonable doubt' 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
The ASSU Sen
ate last night rec
ommended that
the burden of
proof in the Uni
versity's Honor
('ode remain "at
beyond a reason
able doubt."
The Commit
tee of 15 requested

the senate's opinion on its proposal
for reform of the University's judi
cial charter. The committee's rec
ommendations included a provision
that would have, if approved, low
ered the burden of proof required to
convict a student of an Honor Code
or Fundamental Standard viola
tion, instituting a "clear and con-

vineing evidence' standard.
The committee has agreed to in
corporate the .senate's suggestion
into the final draft of the new judicial
charter which will be presented to the
Faculty Senate on Jan. 23. In < irder to
take effect, the changes must win the
approval of the Faculty Senate, the
ASSU Senate and University Presi
dent Cierhard Casper
The ASSU Senate's decision
came with a request that the bur
den of proof issue be revisited after
observing the effects of the pro
posed changes.
ASSU President Bill Shen. how
ever. raised concerns over some
parts of the reform.
Students, according to Shen,
would not be guaranteed the right
to confront their accusers and


Shen
would not be ensured legal counsel.
Shen told the senate that the com
mittee has promised to consider his
objections.
In other business, Shen and
ASSU Vice President Nick Thomp
son suffered a near defeat when tin
senate debated a resolution endors
ing a campaign to re-examine the
priorities of the Stanford adminis
tration. The measure passed hut
only after heated debate.
The resolution "does nothing
but take up time," ASSU Senator
Doug Natelson said. "It has no real
effect other than to ask us to stand
up and give a symbolic yea."

The resolution in question would
have pledged support to broad prin
ciples such as "Universities were
created for students" and "Universi
ties are fundamentally different
from for-profit businesses."
"I don't think the senate's status
as a deliberative body prevents us
from taking a stance on broad prin
ciples." .ASSI Senate Deputy Chair
Joe Freund said in support of the
resolution.
A sullen Shen watched the de
bate from the back of the chamber
as the senate refused him the unan
imous support for which he had
hoped. The measure passed on a 9-
4 vote with three abstentions.
Shen also presented his Consti
tutional Council appointees to the
senate.
Doctoral student Nawwar KaÂ»-
rawi, sophomores Katherine Wray

and Robert Wmdom. senior Eu
gene Park and junior Ben Decker
will now face the scrutiny of the
senate's Administration and Rules
Committee.
" There are several senators that
are opposed to or are wary of the
power that the Constitutional
Council holds," Shen said. "I hope
that the confirmation process is a
confirmation of the members I have
appointed and not the Constitu
tional Council itself."
In a response to a question by
Senate Chair Donald Aingworth,
Shen and his appointees main
tained that no considerations other
than their qualifications played a
role in their nomination.
Kasrawi and Decker are close as
sociates of Shen's, and questions
had been raised about their ap
pointments.
