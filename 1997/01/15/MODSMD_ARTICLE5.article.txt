Two professors at the School of
Medicine are suing the University
over alleged unfair working condi
tions at the Veterans Administra
tion Hospital in Palo Alto. Yester
day, Stanford's attorneys filed a
response to the lawsuit.
Assoc. Psychiatry Prof Brant
Wenegrat and former Psychiatry
Prof. Adolf Pfefferbaum charge
that the environment at the hos
pital was so "hostile" that "nei
ther they nor any reasonable aca
demic person would remain em
ployed there."
Last summer, as a result ot the
situation at the YA hospital. Pfef
ferbaum left his position there
with the intention of continuing
his research at the Medical
School. The University adminis
tration interpreted his action as a
resignation from the Stanford fac
ulty.
"I take the position that they
dismissed me. I did not resign."
Pfefferbaum said. "1 view this as
some cynical attempt on the part
of the administration to suppress

dissent by the faculty."
He added, "I was a tenured
professor at the University. There
are procedures for dismissing
tenured professors 1 was afforded
none of them."
According to Wenegrat, the ad
ministration's insistence that Pf
efferbaum resigned is designed to
avoid giving him a public hearing
that is due a faculty member dis
charged for leaving his assign
ment. The result is what Wene
grat called an "Alice in Wonder
land" situation, in which Pfeffer
baum's alleged resignation pre
vents him from having a hearing
on whether he.in fact, gave up his
post.
According to Thomas Fenner.
senior University counsel, Pfef
ferbaum "was hired to fill a posi
tion at the Palo Alto YA Medical
Center. That was his assigned
Stanford faculty post. By volun
tarily resigning from that YA po
sition. after being told that to do
so would mean leaving the Stan
ford faculty, he has resigned from
the Stanford faculty."
Pfefferbaum disagreed. "Noth
ing about my tenure required me
to be at the VA," he said.
At a hearing on Jan. 28, Santa
Clara County Superior Court will
consider issuing a writ of man
damus, which may force the Uni
versity to reinstate PfefTerbaum
as a faculty member or give him a
hearing as outlined in the faculty
handbook.
In addition, a conference
scheduled for Feb. 25 will set a
trial date for the lawsuit.
The main body of the lawsuit
addresses the question of whether
the University has "violated the

terms of faculty contracts by fail
ing to protect the rights of faculty
members" at the VA, said Wene
grat.
Some faculty at the Medical
School are assigned to positions at
the VA hospital. However, the
working conditions there do not
meet standards of academic free
dom necessary for Stanford facul
ty, said Paul McCloskey, an attor
ney representing Pfefferbaum
and Wenegrat.
Much of the controversy
around these conditions points to
Anesthesiology Prof. Richard
Mazze, who serves as chief of staff
at the hospital and associate dean
at the Medical School. According
to McCloskey, Mazze has "com
mitted medical misconduct" and
"imposed conditions on [Pfeffer

baum and Wenegrat] which they
feel are onerous."
Wenegrat contends that
Mazze's leadership created an en
vironment that interfered with the
academic work conducted at the
hospital by the Stanford faculty.
The lawsuit charges that Pfef
ferbaum was fired from his posi
tion at the hospital and demoted
by Stanford in February 1995
after he expressed his concern
about Mazze's conduct to then-
Medical School Dean David
Korn
According to Wenegrat, Mazze
subsequently subjected Pfeffer
baum, an internationally
renowned psychiatrist, and his
staff to intolerable harassment.
Mazze declined to comment on
the issue.
