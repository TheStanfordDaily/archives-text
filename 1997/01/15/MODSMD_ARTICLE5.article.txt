Two professors at the School of
Medicine are suing the University
over alleged unfair working condi
tions at the Veterans Administra
tion Hospital in Palo Alto. Yester
day, Stanford's attorneys filed a
response to the lawsuit.
Assoc. Psychiatry Prof Brant
Wenegrat and former Psychiatry
Prof. Adolf Pfefferbaum charge
that the environment at the hos
pital was so "hostile" that "nei
ther they nor any reasonable aca
demic person would remain em
ployed there."
Last summer, as a result ot the
situation at the YA hospital. Pfef
ferbaum left his position there
with the intention of continuing
his research at the Medical
School. The University adminis
tration interpreted his action as a
resignation from the Stanford fac
ulty.
"I take the position that they
dismissed me. I did not resign."
Pfefferbaum said. "1 view this as
some cynical attempt on the part
of the administration to suppress

dissent by the faculty."
He added, "I was a tenured
professor at the University. There
are procedures for dismissing
tenured professors 1 was afforded
none of them."
According to Wenegrat, the ad
ministration's insistence that Pf
efferbaum resigned is designed to
avoid giving him a public hearing
that is due a faculty member dis
charged for leaving his assign
ment. The result is what Wene
grat called an "Alice in Wonder
land" situation, in which Pfeffer
baum's alleged resignation pre
vents him from having a hearing
on whether he.in fact, gave up his
post.
According to Thomas Fenner.
senior University counsel, Pfef
ferbaum "was hired to fill a posi
tion at the Palo Alto YA Medical
Center. That was his assigned
Stanford faculty post. By volun
tarily resigning from that YA po
sition. after being told that to do
so would mean leaving the Stan
ford faculty, he has resigned from
the Stanford faculty."
