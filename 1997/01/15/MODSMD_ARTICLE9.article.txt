# Students help clean up in fire's aftermath
## 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
About 15 Stanford students joined communi
ty members yesterday at East Palo Alto's Green
Oaks Elementary School to clean up in the wake
of fire that destroyed eight classrooms and the
library Monday.
"Everyone was pitching in," said junior Sara
Fisher, who drove to Green Oaks yesterday af
ternoon. "Morale was high considering their
school burned."
In addition to helping clean up the rubble,
students also graded papers and helped teachers
set up new desks for students.
Although no one was hurt in the fire that ap
parently began in the school's library, Green
Oaks Principal Todd Gaviglio estimated
$600,000 in structural damage alone. In addi
tion, the school lost all of its library books, many
school supplies, six computers and children's
backpacks and jackets.
The (ire broke out as three Stanford students
were makingaroutine trip to the school as a part
of the community service organization Step Out.
Sophomore Amy Tovar and seniors Katarina
Milicevic and Angela Amarillas, along with
other members of Step Out, teach jazz dance,

hip-hop and creative movement to elementary
students in East Palo Alto.
Milicevic said the three women were looking
for the cafeteria for their 9:30 a.m. dance class
when they passed by a room with flames coming
out the window.
"This flame was just enormous," Milicevic
said. "No one was screaming. No one was com
ing out. So it was obviously unoccupied."
Gaviglio told The Palo Alto Daily News that
although class was normally held in that room,
Monday's class was canceled because the
teacher had called in sick.
"I ran into the office and told them. Then 1
went into the classrooms and told the teachers
the school was on fire," Milicevic said.
The school was not immediately evacuated,
because not all the fire alarms went off. Milicevic
and her friends helped teachers lead students to
a nearby field.
"We gave them our jackets and mittens be
cause they didn't have time to grab them and
they were cold." Milicevic said.
She said the younger students were crying
and asking about their siblings. Milicevic, Tovar
and Amarillas stayed at Green Oaks for a couple
of hours consoling the children.
Classes resumed yesterday at Green Oaks de

spite the room shortage. The kindergarten class
shared a room with the first-grade class, while
special education shared a room with the lburth
graders.
In order to solve the problem of overcrowd
ing, Gaviglio said he plans for the children to
take educational field trips during this transi
tion time. He said a Held trip to the Stanford Lin
ear Accelerator Center is already in the works.
"Hopefully, the kids will get out and do some
thing to make this a positive experience," Gav
iglio said.
"It's such a shame it happened to them be
cause they really can't afford this," Milicevic
said.
Long-term plans are being made to help the
school.
"We plan on going back every Friday because
the teacher invited us," Fisher said.
Senior Atesa Farshian, Step Out's coordina
tor. said the group also has plans in mind to help
the school.
"We're thinking of organizing a relief effort if
we can," Farshian said.
Step Out still plans on continuing with
today's dance classes despite the fire. The multi
purpose room in which they hold dance classes
was not damaged.
