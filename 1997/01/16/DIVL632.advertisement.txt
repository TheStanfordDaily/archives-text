NUMEROUS CHALLENGING
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE AREAS OF:
Analog Design Engineers
If you ..Afe graduating with an MSEE/PhD or a BSEE with very strong analog
design skills, this position will provide the opportunity to learn advanced IC
design while developing systems engineering skills. Design Engineers will
also have the chance to work in advanced BiCMOS process technologies.
You will design ancj develop analog and mixed signal ICs. This includes chip
definition, circuit-design, simulation, layout supervision, debug, characteriza
tion and release to production.
Test Development Engineers
If you are graduating with a BS/MSEE, enjoy working on analog and mixed
signal circuits, and have computer programming skills, our Test Development
Engineering opportunities may be your ticket. You will use your understand
ing of analog and digital circuits to design hardware and software that per
forms complex electrical screening of our mixed-signal ICs on automatic test
equipment, as well as insure this testing correlates to laboratory benchmarks.
You will work closely with our IC Design Engineers and Product Engineers to
define and implement a test program that guarantees parametric and func
tional operation of the IC.
Product Engineers •
If you are graduating with a BS/MSEE and have a preference for analog cir
cuits, our Product Engineering positions may be of interest to you. Strong
analog skills are integral, as you will evaluate, characterize and introduce
new products to manufacturing. You will also be responsible for analyzing,
enhancing and forecasting Wafer Sort and Final Test yields and supporting
production to resolve product issues.
