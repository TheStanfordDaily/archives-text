You can tell when someone in high school thinks they're being really
smart because they use the word valid. That used to piss me off. You
can tell when someone at Stanford thinks they're being smart because
they use the word paradigm. That pisses me off even more. If you, too,
want to show off your grand, grand grasp of the English language, send
a classified to intermission@daily by midnight this Sunday. And get
cracking, smartypants, because this volume of The Daily is aboutto end
and the new Intermission just might not include a place for you to air
your pain.
