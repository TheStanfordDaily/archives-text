Russia in critical condition
MOSCOW (AP) — Boris Yeltsin lies in the
Kremlin hospital. But it's Russia, stuck in a state
of perpetual crisis, that needs urgent treatment.
The president's week-old bout with pneumonia
— only the latest setback to his shaky health —
has put the country on automatic pilot at a time of
severe economic and social distress.
"The country is much sicker than its presi
dent," Vitaly Tretyakov, editor in chief of the lib
eral newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, wrote
recently.
Besides reviving concern about who's running
Russia, Yeltsin's latest illness has once again
altered the political landscape. His pneumonia —
coming on the heels of his half-year absence for
heart problems and his bypass surgery — has trig
gered a new round of noisy politicking by his
opponents and wider calls for his resignation.
Perhaps more important, it has created a
widespread presumption that Russia is unlikely to
have a full-time leader for the remaining 3 1/2
years of Yeltsin's term — even if he fully recovers,
as doctors predict.
Few people expect the 65-year-old leader to
step down, but there are doubts that he will ever
again be a vigorous, everyday president.
"When the president first appeared after
(bypass) surgery, it looked like there would be a
period of stability," said Yevgeny Volk, Moscow
office director for the Heritage Foundation, a
Washington, D.C.-based think tank.
Some commentators suggest Russia faces a
new period of stagnation, and Yeltsin's opponents
and the media have made unflattering compar
isons to the unproductive era of the late Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev, who was ill for many
years.
This is a dangerous time for Russia to stand
still.
Economic reforms are moving slowly. The
inability to collect taxes has hamstrung the gov
ernment. Millions of state workers and pension
ers are owed back pay. And officials are dead
locked over how to reform an army of underpaid,
underfed, disillusioned soldiers.
Russia also needs to decide soon whether to
make a tough response to NATO's expansion
plans and how to deal with secessionist Chechnya
after its Jan. 27 presidential election.
Nevertheless, the government showed last
year it can muddle along and avoid catastrophe
without the active presence of the president, who
has continued to sign off on major decisions.
Peru, rebels agree to talks
LIMA, Peru (AP) — Leftist rebels agreed yes
terday to formal talks to end Peru's month-old
hostage crisis on the condition that everything —
including freedom for their jailed comrades — be
on the table. •
The announcement — made via two-way radio
from the Japanese ambassador's residence —
raised hopes of a potential breakthrough in the
hostage crisis, which has been at a standoff since
the Tupac Amaru rebels released seven hostages
on New Year's Day.
Negotiations to free the 74 remaining hostages
have been stalled since then, with each side hard
ening its position. President Alberto Fujimori has
flatly refused the rebels' key demand that he free
hundreds of jailed guerrillas.
The government's initial response to yester
day's rebel announcement didn't waver from that
position. Defense Minister Gen. Tomas Castillo
said he welcomed a solution — but only within the
bounds established earlier by Fujimori. The gov
ernment did not immediately say whether it
would accept the rebels' condition for the talks.
About 20 heavily armed rebels seized the
ambassador's residence on Dec. 17, taking
hostage more than 500 people attending a party.
They have released all but 74 men; Japan's
ambassador, Peruvian officials, Japanese execu
tives and Fujimori's younger brother remain cap
tive.
The rebels said they would accept participation
by the Red Cross and Catholic Archbishop Juan
Luis Cipriani, who has been a key player in the
standoff. They also said they wanted representa
tives from Guatemala and an unspecified Euro
pean country to join.
Minutes after the rebels made their statement,
they allowed one of the hostages, identified as
Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela, to
speak over the radio.
The man said that all of the hostages were
"healthy and in good spirits" and realized the
need for patience.
49ers coach resigns
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - George Seifert is
walking away from his job as coach of the San
Francisco 49ers, a startling departure signaling
the overhaul of a team that won five Super Bowls
and was known for its continuity.
UC-Berkeley coach Steve Mariucci, a newcomer
to the 49ers organization, but not their offensive
system, is expected to be named as Seifert's suc
cessor and become just the third 49ers coach in 18
years.
The formed announcement could come some
time today.
Seifert, with the 49ers organization for 17
years, including the last eight as head coach, led
San Francisco to two of its Super Bowl victories
and had the highest winning percentage by a
coach in NFL history.
Sounding very much like Lou Holtz, Seifert
yesterday said leaving was the right thing for him
to do, a decision he arrived at in part during his
just-concluded fishing trip to Mexico.
"Basically, there was a sense and a feel that
there needs to be some changes made. I came back
with the feeling that this was best for myself and
for the 49ers," Seifert said.
"This thing eventually had to come to an end.
It's been a great eight years in a tough position,"
Seifert said. He added he'll fulfill the final year of
his contract with the 49ers as a consultant to the
team.
Team officials did not immediately announce a
replacement, but all signs point to Mariucci.
