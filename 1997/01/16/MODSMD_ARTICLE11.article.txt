# Netanyahu, Arafat agree on withdrawal Hebron pullout will begin next week
## Clinton claims victory, plans Mideast conference 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The hard-won Hebron
agreement gives President Clinton a foreign policy tri
umph to take into his second term and a road map for
further land-for-peace deals between Israel and the
Arabs.
Exulting over the accord between the Israelis and
the Palestinians, reached with the help of American
mediator Dennis Ross, Clinton is preparing for a
series of White House invitations to Middle East lead
ers in February to plot the next steps.
He is keeping Ross and the U.S. "peace team" on
the job and offering their help to unknot such touchy
issues as Palestinian demands for a safe road linking
Gaza and the West Bank and for an airport.
"This is not a time to relax," Clinton said after
Israel and the Palestinians struck a deal yesterday,
following four months of negotiations. It assures the
Palestinians control of Hebron, promised by dovish
Labor governments, as well as a three-stage Israeli
troop withdrawal on the West Bank by mid-1998.
He intends to invite Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israel's prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, to Washington, as well as King Hussein of
Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. The
aim, White House officials said, is take stock of Middle
East peacemaking and get together with Clinton's

new security team, which will be headed by Madeleine
Albright as secretary of state.
The retiring secretary, Warren Christopher, who is
stepping down tomorrow, called yesterday's agree
ment "a road map for the future" and one that could
"help create a greater degree of trust and confidence
between the parties."
It was not immediately clear how much territory
Israel will surrender while retaining the right at least
until the 1998 deadline to protect 140,000 Jews who
live in 120 settlements on the West Bank.
Palestinian officials disputed this interpretation.
They said Israel was reqinred" to pull bdss fh a way
that restricts Israeli troops to the Jewish settlements.
In Jerusalem, Israel's Cabinet temporarily sus
pended consideration of the agreement after an Israel
TV report that the United States did not intend to let
Israel decide the extent of its troop withdrawal from
the West Bank.
The report cited an unidentified top U.S. official in
Washington. The meeting resumed only after Ross
called the Cabinet members to assure them the report
did not reflect U.S. policy.
Clinton said further peacemaking "will demand
every effort to stop those who would choose con
frontation over cooperation."

Hard-liners decry 'betrayal'
JERUSALEM (AP) - A bitterly divided
Israeli Cabinet agreed yesterday to withdraw
troops from most of Hebron and rural West
Bank areas, approving an accord that some of
Benjamin Netanyahu's own hard-line allies
denounced as a betrayal.
"The prime minister committed himself to
give away sections of the Jewish homeland. He
gets zero from Arafat," said Science Minister
Benny Begin, who resigned in angry protest of
the 11-7 vote.
The Hebron accord — wrapped up in a pre
dawn session yesterday after 3 1/2 months of
tortuous negotiations — sailed through Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Cabinet and PLO executive
committee. Palestinians said the Cabinet
approval was by a large majority but did not
immediately release the vote count.
The Israeli Cabinet approval sets the stage
for Israeli parliament debate today on the agree
ment, which outlines the immediate troop with
drawal from Hebron — the last West Bank city
under Israeli occupation — and from the West
Bank countryside by mid-1998.
The troop withdrawal from Hebron is expect
ed to start as soon as parliament gives its
approval, which is all but guaranteed given the
support of dovish opposition parties.
By last night, Israeli troops were already
moving chairs and desks out of their Hebron
headquarters.
The Israeli Cabinet debated the accord for 12
tumultuous hours, breaking once in sudden con
fusion over U.S. guarantees to Israel.
The crisis was sparked by an Israel TV report
that quoted an unidentified senior American
official in Washington as saying Israel could not
unilaterally decide how much of the West Bank
it would turn over to the Palestinians.
The report reached the Cabinet, and minis
ters immediately demanded an explanation from
Netanyahu, who had cited Israel's ability to
determine the size of the pullback as his biggest
achievement in the accord.
Netanyahu aides demanded — and got — a
clarification from the Americans. The U.S. State
Department issued a new statement specifying
that "further redeployment phases are issues
for implementation by Israel rather than issues
for negotiation with the Palestinians."
At Netanyahu's suggestion, the Israeli Cabi
net decided that each stage of withdrawal would
have to be debated and authorized by the minis
ters. Netanyahu apparently intended that to
reassure wavenng Cabinet members.
Tfie new accord says that Israeli troops
should pull out of West Bank rural areas in
three stages, starting in the first week of March.
It says Israel should withdraw to Jewish settle
ments and military locations but does not stipu
late the exact dimensions.
Netanyahu is now for the first time personal
ly committed to the peace agreements he had
once denounced as a foolish gamble with Israeli
security, and the Palestinians said they could do
business with him.
"There was no trust, but gradually it has
started to grow," said Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat's
deputy.
