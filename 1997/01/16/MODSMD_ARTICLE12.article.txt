# Clinton will give Dole highest civilian award
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Offer
ing an olive branch to a van
quished foe, President Clinton
plans to present Bob Dole with
the Presidential Medal of Free
dom, the nation's highest civilian
award.
A White House official, speak
ing on condition of anonymity,
said Clinton plans to award the
medal to Dole tomorrow during
an event to unveil the winning
design for a World War II battle
monument.
Clinton's decision became pub
lic yesterday on the publication
date of fallen political guru Dick
Morris' inside look at the White
House, which quotes Clinton as
calling Dole "an evil, evil man."
Presidential spokesman Mike
McCurry said recently that Clin
ton disputes the quote.
White House spokeswoman
Mary Ellen Glynn declined to say
whether Dole would be offered
the medal but added: "That
sounds like an excellent way to
pay tribute to a person who has
devoted a lifetime to public ser
vice."
It is not known whether Dole
planned to attend tomorrow's
event. He was not available for
comment, and a message left for
his spokesman, Clarkson Hine,
was not immediately returned
yesterday.
During the hard-knuckle cam
paign, Clinton spoke highly of
Dole in public, honoring his
record in World War II and his 35
years of service in the Senate.
But the president and his party
spent millions of dollars to por
tray Dole, 73, as a danger to Med
icaid, education programs and,
more indirectly, too old for the
job.
For his part, Dole often said
Clinton "is not my enemy; he's
my opponent." Yet he openly

questioned Clinton's ethics, sug
gested that he would be
impeached in a second term and
— with prodding from a spectator
— once said, "Bozo's on his way
out."
Clinton defeated Dole last
November. Less than a week
later, at a Veteran's Day ceremo
ny at Arlington Cemetery, he led
a round of applause for Dole, who
lost the use of his right arm as a
result of World War II injuries.
"He refused to withdraw from
the world and instead dedicated
his life to serving the American
people," Clinton said.
The two men have been pro
fessed friends since the death of
the president's mother in 1993.
Dole ran for vice president
alongside Gerald Ford in 1976.
They lost to Jimmy Carter and
Walter Mondale. He unsuccess
fully sought the GOP presiden
tial nomination in 1980 and
1988.
Dole served in the House for
eight years and in the Senate for
27. He was elected Senate majori
ty leader in 1984, but two years
later became minority leader
when Democrats regained con
trol. He became majority leader
again in 1995 and served until he
resigned his seat last June.
The decision revealed yester
day is in keeping with Clinton's
promise to reach across party
lines after the election and
reflects internal polls showing
Americans want more civility in
Washington.
In a speech last week to clergy
man, Clinton called for "a spirit
of reconciliation" in the nation.
Clinton awarded a Medal of
Freedom to departing Defense
Secretary William Perry on Tues
day and to Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin shortly before
Bernadin's death last fall.
