Changes to Admit Weekend
will better help pro fros
evaluate the college choice

THE OFFICE OF Under
graduate Admissions
announced last week it is
restructuring the way prospective
freshmen, once known as pro fros,
will be assigned hosts when they
pay what may be a pivotal visit in
April.
For many, Stanford will be but
one of the schools they are accept
ed to, and those not in the early
decision pool will probably have
the luxury of choosing between
several excellent institutions and
financial aid packages.
This is probably what prompted
the Admissions Office to change
the way it conducts Admit Week
end. In an increasingly aggressive
climate of competition for the best
students, Stanford needs to put its
best foot forward.
Yet while Admit Weekend has
consistently drawn a variety of
enthusiastic students to help, it
has been discriminatory in that
upperclassmen who do not live in a
four-class dorm have been barred
from hosting pro fros.
Even as last-minute hosts were
desperately sought for the thou
sand or so visiting high school
seniors last year, many upperclass
men who volunteered to host were
excluded because of the perception
that pro fros would be given the
"wrong impression" of Stanford.
Juniors and seniors in the midst of
exams or job searches and sopho
mores going through that infa
mous second-year slump were a
threat to the happy, peppy image
of Nirvana that organizers wanted
to project. As such, the socially
incorrect (some argue dead) dorms
of Governor's Corner, Cowell Clus
ter, Castano and Lantana were
quietly removed from considera
tion.
The new system will not only
rectify this past inequality, but

address the problem of an insuffi
cient number of host rooms for
the pro fros. It will also show that
upperclassmen are equally capa
ble of gushing.pride for fair Stan
ford as any spry freshman. Cer
tainly, one need not live in Bran
ner to connect with high school
students.
And while the system still
places emphasis on having fresh
men be the primary custodian of
pro fros, admits can hear alterna
tive points of view from older, and
possibly wiser, room hosts who
may be in a better position to
answer substantive questions.
Freshmen may not be so well pre
pared to answer why they picked
their major and what coming to
Stanford has meant academically
and personally. Getting admits to
accept the golden offer is of sec
ondary importance to having the
students find out if Stanford is a
good fit for them lest they spend
four years questioning why they
came.
The change in hosting duties is
a step in the right direction, but it
also leaves some questions unan
swered. Will upperclassmen living
in fraternity houses and the
Suites be eligible to offer sleeping
arrangements or will the prohibi
tion on hosting continue for
them?
Additionally, the initial esti
mates of assigning 10 pro fros to
one host might prove overwhelm
ing and under serve the admits. It
is critical that hosts speak from
personal experiences and address
concerns pro fros might have but
may not have the opportunity to
ask. Personalizing attention by
limiting the pro fro to host ratio
down to a maximum of four or
five to one while mixing up the
geographic distribution among
the group will bring better
results.
Opening up upperclass dorms to
hosting pro fros is a good move,
but in the end quality, rather than
quantity or projecting the "right"
image, is key to having a truly suc
cessful Admit Weekend.
