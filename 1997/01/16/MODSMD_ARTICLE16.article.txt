Students may be pleasantly surprised by the dreaded GERs

Garry Grundy recently questioned
the logic of requiring general edu
cation requirements at Stanford
(Tuesday's Daily). He claims that Stan
ford students possess the maturity to
select a wide variety of classes and devel
op a course of study which will help them
become more responsible members of
society. Therefore, the University should
not require GERs but trust the student's
judgments. Although I also do not like
the idea that the University requires stu
dents to take certain classes, I believe
that Grundy did not consider the issue
thoroughly.

For example, I am not as confident as
Grundy that Stanford students would
voluntarily explore a variety of classes
without the influence of GERs. On the
contrary, I feel that I meet more and
more students who are influenced by
social pressures to view Stanford as a
stepping stone to the world of careers,
rather than a school of intellectual value.
Consequently, students immediately
enroll in marketable and practical classes
rather than taking the time to explore
other disciplines which might interest
them. GERs work to counteract the
growing influence of social pressures.

Furthermore, GERs not only give stu
dents the opportunity to explore other
areas of interest, but they also provide
students with the opportunity to gather
important skills which they may not
even know exist. I speak from experi
ence. Before I enrolled in my first history
class, I had know idea that I did not
know how to clearly and analytically
write, speak, think and even read. And
although I did not appreciate the subject
matter of my first computer science
class, I did develop an understanding of
how deeply computers influence my
world and shape the people who work

with them. One cannot predict what he
or she will learn in a class from the
description in the course catalog. GERs
give students the chance to gather
knowledge in ways they may not be
aware.
I think Grundy's article would have
evoked much more thought throughout
the student body if he had also attempt
ed to comment upon why the University
feels a need to require students to take
certain classes and how students may
benefit from them.
