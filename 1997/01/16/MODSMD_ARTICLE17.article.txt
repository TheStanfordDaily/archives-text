# Loss of Prof Gupta will prove a devastating loss to Stanford students
## 
### 
It is with great concern that we
learned of the administration's decision
to deny tenure to Anthropology Prof.
Akhil Gupta. As doctoral students from
the Program in Modern Thought and
Literature who have benefited immense
ly from Gupta's scholarship and active
presence on campus, we are asking that
the administration reconsider its deci
sion.
Gupta's classes have been invaluable
resources to modern thought and litera
ture students. His courses on social,
political and economic theory are among
the most theoretically rigorous and com
prehensive of those offered at Stanford,
combining a critical attention both to
classical texts and new scholarship at
the center of current debates. Because of

the intellectual content of his syllabi and
his renown reputation as a scholar,
Gupta's courses have been exciting intel
lectual meeting grounds for students
from across the disciplines.
Gupta's scholarship has been critical
to the work of modern thought and liter
ature students on a range of topics
including post-colonial studies, the his
tory of South Asia, Third World develop
ment and theories of nationalism and
state formation. Gupta's ability to
adeptly bridge disciplinary and theoreti
cal traditions in his own work has been
exemplary for many of us as we pursue
our own careers as interdisciplinary
scholars.
Finally, Gupta has been a committed
supporter of the Program in Modern
Thought and Literature. In addition to
serving on our committee, he acts as an
academic adviser for many of our stu
dents. Gupta's dedication to innovative
anthropology has not only invited our
students into the social sciences but has
been critical in broadening the debates

within his own discipline.
In short, Gupta's contribution to cre
ative, intellectual life on the Stanford
campus is immense. His loss would be
no less.
