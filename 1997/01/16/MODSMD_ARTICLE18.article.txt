# Overseas Studies office should allert students to its intrusive policies
## 
### 
The response from the Overseas
Studies office explaining why it sorts
through students' forwarded mail (yes
terday's Daily) raises two points. First
of all, while the office may indeed be in
compliance with the law — and I never
did accuse the office of breaking it —
the law is not the sole reason that the
office opens students' packages. Anoth

er student in the Moscow program
received a compact disc, sent from his
family, inside an opened envelope which
read: "CD — charge student $5." Clear
ly, Overseas Studies is going through
students' mail for administrative pur
poses in addition to legal ones; it is
checking the content of packages to see
which ones it wants to bill students for
and which ones it will allow to be free.
The second point which must be
raised is the issue that Overseas Studies
does not make this policy known to the
students involved in its programs. I may
be mistaken, but I never received any
indication from the office that this was
standard operating procedure prior to
the opened letter in question arriving in
Moscow. If both law and circumstance
compel the Overseas Studies ofTice to
sort through students' personal mail,
then students should be notified
through some other medium than the
letter column of The Daily.
