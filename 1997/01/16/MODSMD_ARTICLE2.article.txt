## University retains records of all electronic correspondence for one year after deletion 
### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
A study released yesterday by University
President Gerhard Casper reported that in the
case of electronic correspondence, the delete
command often fails to live up to its billing.
The report, written for Casper by law stu
dent Leslie Hatamiya, chronicles Stanford's
electronic record keeping procedures and
their impact on students, faculty and staff. It
confirms the worst nightmares of felonious e
mail users: E-mail messages sent or received
by Stanford students and then deleted are
often saved on University backup disks for up
to a year
"People should realize that whatever they
do on the computer may never disappear,"
Hatamiya wrote.
These copies, kept as a safeguard against a
possible computer system crash, are only ac
cessible by a few people. University policy dic
tates that individual user's files may only be
examined at the direction of the University's
chief information officer or under court order
"The mere fact that files are maintained
in an electronic medium does not exempt
them from being legally discoverable. As a
result, a court could subpoena a file or e-mail
message that a user thought was deleted six
months ago, and the University could be re
quired by law to turn over the information,"
the report said.
Director of University Communications
Terry Shepard confirmed that the adminis
tration would open a file in compliance with
any court orders. In the event of an internal
investigation, however, University policy is
less clear-cut.
If, for example, a student was being inves
tigated for an alleged Honor Code violation
and a deleted e-mail message contained facts

vital to the case , there is no
set University policy as to
whether or not a backup
copy of the message could be
retrieved and used as evi
dence.
Bill Bauriedel, principal
system software developer
for the University's Infor
mation Technology Sys
tems and Services, ex-

pressed doubt that such a message could be
retrieved "It would be very difficult for any
one to look at e-mail in that situation," he
said. "There's no legal subpoena."
Steve Hansen, an information systems
specialist in Distributed Computing and
Communications Systems, concurred. "We
would not (go after such a message)," he said.
"In my opinion, that would violate the Elec
tronic Communications Privacy Act of
1986." That act extended federal protection
to various electronic media, including e-mail.
The University is currently in the process
of drafting a network usage policy that will po
tentially contain guidelines for e-mail re
trieval, according to General Counsel Mike
Roster. That policy is due to be completed in
the spring.
Hatamiva's report was commissioned last
spring by Casper in an effort to boost aware
ness of the issue among both the administra
tion and the University community at large.
The result was a 21-page memo covering five
sections: computer services (including e
mail and Internet access), the telephone sys
tem, the cable television system, the univer
sal electronic identification card and library
circulation.
