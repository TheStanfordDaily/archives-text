## No, a Band-Aid won’t help

Menstruation seems to
be the dirty secret that a good
percentage of the women here
on campus, indeed, here on Earth, real
ly want to keep to themselves. Why?
Because everyone shrinks away whenev
er we mention it. I find that appalling. I
have had to sit through people telling
me about masturbation, showing me
open cuts, popping pimples on their
short-clad legs, scratching their asses,
picking their noses and ears and cough
ing on my food at dinner. It's OK to talk
about all of these things. Why aren't MY
bodily functions deserving of some pub
lic conversation?
This campus is filled with, among
other people, human women who are "of
age." This means that there are a whole
bunch of us who, like the rest of you,
eat, sleep, drink water and get sick and
vomit and sometimes feel good or bad.
Another thing that sets off most of the
human female population is a wonderful
thing called menstruation, in which said
human females spend a few days of the
month bleeding constantly. This, I
believe, needs to be brought to the
attention of the rest of the University.
My freshman year, I had one of the
most painful periods (in both senses) of
my life. I couldn't go to class. I could
barely move. So I decided to go to Cow
ell Student Health Center to get eased
of my pain. I took one of those Mar
guerite buses to get to Cowell, and
that's when the pain started in earnest.
Suddenly all of my clothes seemed too

tight, I had to undo my shoelaces and
take off my hat in order to breathe. The
bus driver asked me if I wanted to go to
the hospital. I told him no, that I want
ed to go to Cowell. He then informed me
that the bus was no longer stopping off
at Cowell, and that I had just missed
the stop a couple of minutes ago. I
ended up getting off of the bus some
where over on Serra Street near the
parking office.
That's how much pain I was in. I was
completely unable to reason, and I
ended up alternating between walking
and crawling for the next three hours
back to my dorm (Florence Moore Hall).
Altogether, the pain lasted about eight
hours. When I finally got back, my car
ing friends asked me what I had done all
day and why I was crying. I had to tell
them. Wouldn't you have? Here is how
they responded:
"That's disgusting!"
"That's WAY more information than
I wanted to know!"
"I just can't relate because I am not a
girl."
Essentially, what they were telling
me was that in approximately one quar
ter of my life after age 12,1 am not wor
thy of conversation. Approximately one
week out of every month I no longer had
the proper language needed to relate to
my (then all-male) friends. The one
most potent thing that makes me who I
am to the rest of the world, my ability
(whether or not it is realized) to engage
in the sexual act, the possibility of my

pregnancy, is something to be men
tioned in a whispered voice to psychia
trists, if at all.
What I want to say is this: wake up.
You want a girlfriend, you want a fami
ly including a woman, you want to have
a daughter? You have to be willing to
accept this one, bloody part of living.
You wanna know why I have bags under
my eyes, why I am walking a little slow
er than usual, why my voice sounds
funny — it's because I'm sick, actually.
But try me again in a few days, when my
cold is gone, and the answer I give will
be quite different.
We have all got to learn how to
acknowledge the ugly. Yes, there is star
vation in the world. There are economic
injustices. There ARE a lot of people out
there who think differently than you do.
There are mass murderers. Many
women bleed for about a week each
month because their bodies are made
that way. Actually . . . maybe that isn't
that ugly. Maybe we should concentrate
on trying to eradicate the other ugly
things out there, hmm? Nah. That
makes too much sense.

Imagine this: three hundred people, two
bands, everyone in a mask or you don't
get in. Masquerade Ball. E-muil me for
information.
