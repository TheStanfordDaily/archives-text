## Tough road trip awaits men's hoops Ranked Oregon squad up first for No. 15 Stanford 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
In a conference where road
wins are a highly precious com
modity — a conference whose
teams are a combined 4-14 on the
road in conference play — there
may be no single road game on a
team's schedule less inviting than
Oregon.
Talk to players and coaches,
and they'll all tell you the same
thing. Forget Arizona's McKale
Center, forget UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion — there's no tougher
place to play in the Pacific 10 Con
ference than Oregon's 10,063-
seat McArthur Court. Cramped
confines and rambunctious fans
have helped make the Ducks'
home floor the Pac-10's least visi
tor-friendly. Tonight No. 15 Stan
ford finds out just how unfriendly
when it meets No. 24 Oregon at
7:35 p.m. on fX (STV Channel
45).
"Because of the structure and
where the people are — and their
enthusiasm has always been great
— it makes it a little more diffi
cult," said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "That court seems to get
a little bit smaller when things get
tough toward the end of the
game."
"The fans are right on top of
you," explained sophomore guard
Kris Weems, who nonetheless
sank 4-of-5 from three-point
range in a 16-point performance
last year at McArthur Court. "It's
the toughest place to plav in the
Pac-10."
Oregon (10-2 overall, 1-2 Pac
-10) crept into the national spot

light this season thanks to a 10-0
start, the school's best in 22 years.
The Ducks have been ranked as
high as No. 17 in the Associated
Press poll despite having won just
one game against a ranked oppo
nent, a 87-75 victory over then-
No. 13, now-unranked Fresno
State on Dec. 7.
Oregon's quick start wasn't
entirely surprising, though, con
sidering all five starters return
from a team that went a
respectable 16-13 in 1995-96. One
of those starters is point guard
Kenya Wilkins, the team's spark
plug and a four-year nemesis of
Stanford's Brevin Knight. In last
year's game at Oregon, Wilkins
hit a running 19-footer at the
buzzer to lift the Ducks to a 64-62
upset of the Cardinal.
The scouting report on Wilkins
reads virtually the same as
Knight's: good quickness, good
defense, a penetrator who can also
pull up and shoot. Both are
diminutive — Wilkins is listed at
5-foot-10, 159 pounds, while
Knight checks in at 5-foot-10, 173
pounds — both are seniors, and
both are among the conference's
elite point guards, if not the
nation's.
Even their numbers match up:
Wilkins averages 16.3 points, five
assists and 2.5 steals and shoots a
nifly 83 percent from the free
throw line, while Knight boasts
per-game averages of 16 points,
7.6 assists and 2.6 steals while
knocking down a conference-best
85 percent of his free throws.
"I think everybody that knows

basketball recognizes that he's a
very good player," Montgomery
said of Wilkins. "He's very similar
to Brevin. He creates the same type
of opportunities, and he has for
four years. He's nonstop."
In tonight's game "you've got
two of the premier point guards in
the conference, guys that have
played against each other for four
years," Montgomery said. "It's
always been interesting, and this
should be no different."
Montgomery has been peppered
with questions from the press this
week regarding lineup and / or
rotation changes, thanks mostly to
freshman David Moseley's surpris
ing performance against USC last
Saturday. Moseley, usually one of
the last players off the bench,
relieved a slumping Weems and
scored a career-high 19 points,
including 5-of-8 three-pointers, to
spark Stanford to a 85-70 win over
the Trojans.
"Different guys are stepping
up," Weems said. "Our bench is so
deep, sometimes it's like, 'Wow,
half these guys could start for
other teams.' It just makes us a
better team in practice and on the
floor."

Freshmen Mark Madsen and
Ryan Mendez have also been par
ticularly effective in reserve roles.
But Montgomery insists there are
no changes in store.
"I don't know that there's any
body on the bench that has come
off yet on a consistent basis and
changed my thinking," Mont
gomery said. "I watch them in
practice every day; I pretty much
know what everybody can do — it's
just a matter of using them more
minutes in an individual game
rather than making lineup
changes."
Oregon enters tonight's contest
coming off a pair of tough losses at
Washington State and Washington
last weekend. Those two losses —
the team's first of the season —
dropped the Ducks into a seventh
place tie in the Pac-10 with Arizona
State.
"I think they were better than
those Washington teams," Weems
said, "but in the Pac-10, it's so
hard to win on the road."
That's exactly what's worrying
Stanford (10-2, 3-1), which lost five
of nine Pac-10 road games last
year, not to mention a 76-75 loss at
Arizona on Jan. 4.

"I think that what we'll experi
ence is a very similar situation
crowd-wise and intensity-wise to
what we had at Arizona," Mont
gomery said.
