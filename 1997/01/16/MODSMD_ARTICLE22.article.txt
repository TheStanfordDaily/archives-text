## Tough road trip awaits men's hoops Ranked Oregon squad up first for No. 15 Stanford 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
In a conference where road
wins are a highly precious com
modity — a conference whose
teams are a combined 4-14 on the
road in conference play — there
may be no single road game on a
team's schedule less inviting than
Oregon.
Talk to players and coaches,
and they'll all tell you the same
thing. Forget Arizona's McKale
Center, forget UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion — there's no tougher
place to play in the Pacific 10 Con
ference than Oregon's 10,063-
seat McArthur Court. Cramped
confines and rambunctious fans
have helped make the Ducks'
home floor the Pac-10's least visi
tor-friendly. Tonight No. 15 Stan
ford finds out just how unfriendly
when it meets No. 24 Oregon at
7:35 p.m. on fX (STV Channel
45).
"Because of the structure and
where the people are — and their
enthusiasm has always been great
— it makes it a little more diffi
cult," said head coach Mike Mont
gomery. "That court seems to get
a little bit smaller when things get
tough toward the end of the
game."
"The fans are right on top of
you," explained sophomore guard
Kris Weems, who nonetheless
sank 4-of-5 from three-point
range in a 16-point performance
last year at McArthur Court. "It's
the toughest place to plav in the
Pac-10."
Oregon (10-2 overall, 1-2 Pac
-10) crept into the national spot

light this season thanks to a 10-0
start, the school's best in 22 years.
The Ducks have been ranked as
high as No. 17 in the Associated
Press poll despite having won just
one game against a ranked oppo
nent, a 87-75 victory over then-
No. 13, now-unranked Fresno
State on Dec. 7.
Oregon's quick start wasn't
entirely surprising, though, con
sidering all five starters return
from a team that went a
respectable 16-13 in 1995-96. One
of those starters is point guard
Kenya Wilkins, the team's spark
plug and a four-year nemesis of
Stanford's Brevin Knight. In last
year's game at Oregon, Wilkins
hit a running 19-footer at the
buzzer to lift the Ducks to a 64-62
upset of the Cardinal.
The scouting report on Wilkins
reads virtually the same as
Knight's: good quickness, good
defense, a penetrator who can also
pull up and shoot. Both are
diminutive — Wilkins is listed at
5-foot-10, 159 pounds, while
Knight checks in at 5-foot-10, 173
pounds — both are seniors, and
both are among the conference's
elite point guards, if not the
nation's.
Even their numbers match up:
Wilkins averages 16.3 points, five
assists and 2.5 steals and shoots a
nifly 83 percent from the free
throw line, while Knight boasts
per-game averages of 16 points,
7.6 assists and 2.6 steals while
knocking down a conference-best
85 percent of his free throws.
"I think everybody that knows


Mike Wilson — Daily file
Junior forward Pete Van Elswyk takes it to the hoop strong. Van Elswyk and the Card
hope to take it to the Ducks tonight.
