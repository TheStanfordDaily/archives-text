## Swimmers take on Longhorns before they head to Dallas 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
Coming off of its biggest
win of the season over Michi
gan last Friday, the Stanford
men's swim team will be test
ed again this week â€” twice.
Stanford swims today in
Austin, Tex., in a dual meet
against the Texas Longhorns,
and then tomorrow and Sat
urday at the Dallas Morning
News Invitational.
With a tough and impor
tant dual meet and the invita
tional in Dallas, to which the
six top teams from last year's
NCAA Championships are
invited, this week's run
through the Lone Star State
will be an important one.
Texas' team does not boast
four Olympians like the
Michigan squad that the Car
dinal beat last week, but its
depth in the sprint events and
fast relays matches up to
Stanford's strengths very
well.
Texas swimmer Neil Walk
er, a senior, is currently
ranked in the top 25 in the
NCAA in five events, the 50-,
100- and 200-yard freestyles,
the 200-yard backstroke and
the 200-yard individual med
ley, and represents Texas'
biggest weapon. Walker's
speed and experience will
undoubtedly challenge the
Cardinal's sprinters, back
strokers and individual med
ley swimmers.
Along with Walker, Texas
sophomore Chris Archer is
another in the line of Texas
tradition of sprinters who is
also a talented butterfly
swimmer. The combination of
Walker and Archer have been

big factors in Texas' owner
ship of the third-fastest times
in the nation in the 400-yard
freestyle and 400-yard medley
relays.
Stanford, who as yet has
been untested in both relay
events, posts slower times in
both relays, but in head-to
head racing, that could very
easily change. Furthermore,
since relay points count dou
ble in swimming, these two
races will be very important
point swings for both teams.
"Texas is going to be a
tougher meet than Michigan
was," said Stanford junior tri
captain Scott Clay pool. "They
have a lot of depth, but they
also have the quality people
up front in every event as
well."
Stanford has shown its
depth well against its oppo
nents so far this year, and
sprinters Claypool, juniors
Sabir Muhammad, Chris
Olson, Jed Crowe and fresh
man Glenn Counts will be the
stiffest competition that
Texas' Archer and Walker
have seen. Backstroke sopho
mores Tate Blahnik and Dan
Schultz, as well as individual
medley swimmers Tom
Wilkens and Matt Thomson,
measure up well to the Texas
stars in the 200 back and 200
individual medley. Also,
Archer will meet his toughest
200-fly competitor yet in
Stanford sophomore Matt
Pierce.
While Stanford and Texas'
strengths seem to balance
each other out in almost every
event (which should make for
a very exciting meet), the Car
