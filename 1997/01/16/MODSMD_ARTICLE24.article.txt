# Rugby takes on Cal Poly
## Women take a break from the action, men gear up for weekend 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
For the men's rugby team, this week
end's opponent may not be as big a rival as
California, but no other team will come any
closer.
The men will host Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo on Saturday in what has become
one of the greatest competitions in this
sport for Stanford. The game will begin at
1 p.m. at Maloney Field.

'For us it's one of the most
emotionally charged
matches we are going to
play this year.'

"Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo historically
has been a great match for Stanford
rugby," said head coach Franck Boivert. "It
has been one of the greatest rivalries, other
than Cal.
"We used to play them always in the
first round of the playoffs and those were

very dramatic games. For us it's one of the
most emotionally charged matches we are
going to play this year. I would like to see
the team emotionally ready for this game,"
Boivert said.
The team will continue to prepare for its
league opener against Chico State next
month after a decisive victory over the USC
Trojans last week. Boivert said that talent
wise, the team is where it should be, and
that in order to have a successful match
against the Mustangs this weekend "the
team has to work mainly on motivation."
The Cardinal will attempt to build upon
the momentum it gained from the victory
over the Trojans after the long winter of
inactivity.
The men's second team will also com
pete on Saturday, going head-to-head with
the Mustangs backup squad.
The women's team is not scheduled to
play this weekend, but will focus it's prac
tice over the next two weeks on reworking
its defensive realignment and sharpening
its ball-handling skills, Boivert said.
The women were trounced 45-0 last
weekend from an unusually fortified UCLA
squad in Southern California. The squad
will resume play a week from Saturday
when it travels to UC-San Diego to face the
Tritons.
