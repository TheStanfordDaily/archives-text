# Ducks face Card in a battle for first place
## 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
The third-ranked Stanford women's basket
ball team (16-1, 4-0 Pacific 10 Conference) looks
to go duck hunting tonight at 7:30 p.m. as it
faces Oregon (10-2, 3-0,1 at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal is coming off a successful but
costly road trip in Southern California, where it
knocked off UCLA 74-62 Friday night and
sweated out a 77-76 victory over USC two days
later. In the game against the Bruins, both
senior point guard Jamila Wideman and junior
forward Vanessa Nygaard went down with
injuries.
Although Wideman played a courageous 11
minutes against the Trojans, Nygaard's injur}'
was more serious. She underwent arthroscopic
knee surgeiy to repair meniscus damage on her
right knee and is expected to be out two to three
weeks. In short, the Cardinal is less than full
strength going into this battle between confer
ence unbeatens.
"Jamila wasn't even close to 100 percent, and
she isn't now I don't think,' Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I want to wait to
see how Jamila's doing [tonight] and during
warmups."
The Ducks come in with perhaps their best
team since Oregon head coach Jody Runge

arrived four seasons ago. The
squad's only losses have been to
fourth-ranked Georgia, a 72-55
decision, and a 72-63 loss at lowa
State. Runge's squad opened Pac
-10 play by beating Oregon State
78-59 on Jan. 4 and sweeping
Washington State and Washing
ton, 80-46 and 67-60 respectively,
last weekend at home.
Now on the road for the first
time in the conference, the Ducks
look to not only improve on last
year's 4-5 mark in Pac-10 road
games, but they are also looking
for their first win anywhere
against the Cardinal since Ronald
Reagan was in office. Oregon last
beat Stanford on March 5, 1987,
by a 72-55 margin at Maples and
have since lost 18 straight games
to VanDerveer's squad, including
last season's 61-42 and 74-65
decisions.
This is as good a chance as any
for the Ducks with the Cardinal
vulnerable and the entire Oregon
starting lineup back from last sea
son's NCAA tournament squad.
Senior center Renae Fegent is a
terror in the middle, averaging
nearly seven rebounds a game
while raining 36 points on the
Washington schools last weekend.
"Oregon has a real good inside
game," VanDerveer said.
"They're real strong."
Arianne Boyer, a senior for
ward, adds more frontcourt and
scoring depth as the leading scor
er and rebounder on the squad.
Point guard Cindie Edamura
returns for her fourth season of

running the offense. Not usually
known for her scoring, she was
the only guard in double figures
with 11 points in last season's 19-
point loss at Maples.
With Stanford down two
starters, VanDerveer is looking to
senior guard Charmin Smith to
provide the strong outside shoot
ing and rebounding that Nygaard
had brought to the team through
out the first 15 games. If the 15
rebounds she grabbed against the
Bruins and Women of Troy are
any indication, Smith should be
able to fill that role while continu
ing to be a three-point threat
along with senior forward Kate
Starbird.
Speaking of Starbird, the all
time scoring-lead watch has
begun. The reigning Pac-10 play
er of the week is presently 265
points away from Val Whiting's
record of 2,077 career points. She
is averaging 20.6 points per game
while shooting 52 percent from
the floor.
Should Wideman not be able to
go at the start of the game, fresh
man guard Milena Flores will step
in. She has played more frequent
ly as the season has progressed,
and VanDerveer has been pleased
with what she has seen. However,
the coach believes the post play
will determine the fate of
tonight's game.
"I think a lot of our success
will be determined by our inside
play," VanDerveer said. "We have
some very talented forwards and
centers on our team. But I'm also
really excited about how well peo
ple have been practicing. We've
had two really good days of prac
tice; different people are stepping
up and that's what we need."
