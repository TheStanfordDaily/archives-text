# Ducks face Card in a battle for first place
## 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
The third-ranked Stanford women's basket
ball team (16-1, 4-0 Pacific 10 Conference) looks
to go duck hunting tonight at 7:30 p.m. as it
faces Oregon (10-2, 3-0,1 at Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal is coming off a successful but
costly road trip in Southern California, where it
knocked off UCLA 74-62 Friday night and
sweated out a 77-76 victory over USC two days
later. In the game against the Bruins, both
senior point guard Jamila Wideman and junior
forward Vanessa Nygaard went down with
injuries.
Although Wideman played a courageous 11
minutes against the Trojans, Nygaard's injur}'
was more serious. She underwent arthroscopic
knee surgeiy to repair meniscus damage on her
right knee and is expected to be out two to three
weeks. In short, the Cardinal is less than full
strength going into this battle between confer
ence unbeatens.
"Jamila wasn't even close to 100 percent, and
she isn't now I don't think,' Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I want to wait to
see how Jamila's doing [tonight] and during
warmups."
The Ducks come in with perhaps their best
team since Oregon head coach Jody Runge
