# Hockey gets back underway against the Ducks
## 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
The Stanford ice hockey team, finally
solidified after months of roster turmoil, is
poised and ready to pounce on the Oregon
Ducks to open the second half of this wildly
successful season.
But don't get too excited.
The Cardinal made that mistake in its first
match with the Ducks in mid-November. The
Oregon team that Stanford was able to easily
pound 10-1 a year earlier came back surpris
ingly stronger, and the Cardinal squad was
only able to impede disaster on two lucky
shorthanded goals by seniors Chuck Glew
and Evan Asano.
After the final bell, Stanford had inched
past Oregon 3-1 in a game that was closer
than the score indicated.
"They were tough. We were only able to

barely beat them by two goals," said sopho
more team president Sami Jo Small.
"We can't go back thinking we're going to
pound them," Small said. "They play really
well as a team, although we have more talent.
It's going to be tough."
The team will have to fight to renew the
momentum with which it entered winter
break. The Cardinal went into its last game
before break against California flying high,
with a 7-0 undefeated league record and
unparalleled levels of enthusiasm. But the
Golden Bears doused the Card's fire 3-1 to
hand Stanford its only loss of the season.
Freshman Phil Enan doesn't think the
final loss slowed the team's momentum.
"I think the vacation has let us forget
about that game," Enan said. "It's been two
months since the Cal game; it isn't hanging
over our heads any more."
S'.iall adds that perhaps the loss was even

a veiled blessing.
"It might have been good that we lost. It
makes us work harder," Small said.
The team can also look forward to a few
months of relative tranquillity in the roster.
Last quarter's team was rearranged twice by
new recruits to the team after season play
had begun â€” once by golfers Eri Crum, a
junior, and Conrad Ray, a senior, and again
by a wave of graduate students. Learning to
play together consistently was a hurdle that
proved difficult to clear.
"It looks like we're more organized this
time," Small said. "The new players that
came in are now settled in. We've got a solid
roster."
"The team members know each other
now," Enan said. "There's a more friendly
atmosphere. There's a feeling of this being a
continuation of success, not a new begin
ning."
