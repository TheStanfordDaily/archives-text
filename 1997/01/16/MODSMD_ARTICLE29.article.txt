# ASSU senators dispute enactment of changes to judiciary council
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Ten months after students approved a new constitu
tion, the ASSU senate is poised to enact one of its signif
icant changes — the creation of a judiciary council. But
some senators have expressed concern about the power
the Constitutional Council may wield.
The current wording of the ASSU Constitution pro
vides two methods of convening the council: in response
to a petition signed by 5 percent of the student body or
at the request of any one member of the council.
"The second method seems a much more likely path
for issues to be brought before the council," said ASSU
Senator Harris Shapiro, the senate's parliamentarian.
"But with that, the council could effectively have veto
power over everything that the other two branches do."
Shapiro's concerns, echoed by other members of the
senate, stem from a comparison between the new ASSU
judiciary and the U.S. Supreme Court.
"You might think that [the Constitutional Council]
works like judicial review" — the principle on which the
U.S. Supreme Court operates — "where someone
thinks something violates the constitution and refers it
to the council; the council would hear both sides and
make a decision," ASSU Senator Doug Natelson said.
"But the way [the constitution] is written, they have
veto power over everything.
"It doesn't work like the Supreme Court,"he added.
"In the federal system there is a check on judicial power
— cases must be brought to the court."
The U.S. Supreme Court can only consider petitions
brought to it that have real plaintiffs, or individuals neg
atively affected by the issue which they are considering.

"We've gone from having no judiciary to having an
all-powerful judiciary," Natelson said.
The council was created to restrict the power of the
senate, which until this year had the unlimited control
to interpret the constitution.
"When the senate was free to interpret its own con
stitution, the senate had a tendency to play fast and
loose with its rules," Natelson said.
Some senators, however, see no benefit in shifting
that power to five people, none of whom face election by
the student body.
Both Natelson and Shapiro have suggested amend
ing the constitution to prohibit the council from calling
itself into session but to allow the ASSU president, vice
president or a group of senators to bring an issue to the
council. The language allowing a student-body petition
to bring an issue before the council would remain un
changed.
ASSU President Bill Shen, who introduced his coun
cil appointees at Tuesday's senate meeting, supports
such an effort but is more concerned about seating a
council than confronting the problems such action
might cause.
"Students wanted a constitutional council, and we
need to deliver that to them," he said. "The students
that I have nominated do not intend to exercise the full
power of the council."
His assurances, however, do not allay all concerns.
"It's just not good to have a system like this in place,"
Natelson said.
The council appointees will now be interviewed by a
senate committee, which will make recommendations
to the full senate. It requires a two-thirds vote of the
senate to seat a member of the council.
