# Former Credit Union employee claims he was unfairly treated
## 
### Dana Hangai Staff writer 
A former Stanford Federal Credit
Union ATM processor said he was un
fairly terminated for claiming that the
credit union does not adequately protect
its members' money.
The termination was an attempt to
"sweep problems under the rug," he
charges.
When Edward Escobedp, an eight

month employee of the credit union, at
tempted to file a grievance against his su
pervisors, he said he was fired from his
position before he could write his com
plaint.
According to Escobedo, he initially ex
pressed concern about his immediate su
pervisors' orders. He claims that start
ing Nov. 12 his supervisor Debra Bayerd-
Ramsey and Delivery Services Manager
Margaret Wold ordered him to pick up
ATM deposits alone, a direct contradic

tion of credit union policy which requires
that two people empty ATMs. The dual
custody policy is designed to protect the
security of deposits.
"A person going alone, carrying
$500,000 in checks and an unknown
amount in cash was not very safe," Es
cobedo said. Numerous people could find
out his daily schedule, he said, endanger
ing both himself and the credit union
members' money.
On Nov. 13, Escobedo said he
went to Michael Hiller, the
Human Resources Department
vice president, to file a grievance.
According to Escobedo, Hiller was
extremely hostile.
On Nov. 19, Escobedo said he
was called into a conference with
Hiller, Human Resources Gener
alist Betty Strickland and Wold,
where he was given his termina
tion documents. According to the
documents, Escobedo was fired for
"insubordination, refusing to fol
low a supervisor's directions or
other unacceptable conduct to a
supervisor."
However, Escobedo said, "I
never told them I wouldn't do the
ATM run." Instead of handling
Escobedo's safety concerns, Es
cobedo claims, his grievances were
"stonewalled" and "swept under
the carpet."
Hiller and Wold declined to
comment on Escobedo's termina
tion. Concerning safety precau
tions, Hiller said: "We always fol
low dual-custody. We really can't
share these ATM procedures be
cause we're very concerned about
the safety of our employees and
the safety of our members."
However, another credit union
worker in Escobedo's department
said dual-custody procedures

often were not followed and that
Bayerd-Ramsey "didn't want to
make it (dual-custody) become a
habit. One person is always going
to go. They (the supervisors) don't
want to budge."
Another concern employees ex
pressed was the difficulty of filing
a grievance through their Human
Resources Department.
According to Hiller, normally,
people with grievances "file
through their supervisor. The
process is a gradual process going
from their immediate supervisor
to the next level of management.
What we've tried to do is have the
problem solved at the lowest level
possible."
However, one former credit
union worker described the
Human Resources Department as
"very corrupt and deceitful.
"There's always a company pol
icy where you can file a grievance,"
the worker continued. "Human
Resources has published those
statutes, but they don't adhere to
them. The vice president of
Human Resources tries to sweep
things under the carpet whenever
he hears them."
Because of problems with filing
grievances, the worker added, the
turnover rate at the credit union,
which currently employs 81 peo
ple, was extremely high.
"Within six months," the work
er said, "I saw more than 30 em
ployees come and leave that credit
union."
A former high-level credit

union official described the
turnover rate in banking as gener
ally high but said that during the
last six months "the turnover rate
in the relatively long-term em
ployees (workers with more than
three years of experience) was cer
tainly worth attention."
Escobedo also claimed his su
pervisors did not know how to do
his job and provided minimal
training. Whenever he attempted
to find out how to do something,
his supervisors told him to learn
from his mistakes.
After Escobedo requested ad
ditional training, the credit
union's corporate trainer, Cyn
thia Furtado, was assigned to
watch the ATM specialists empty
the ATMs.
"Cynthia observed that we
were not following credit union
policy," Escobedo said. "She
asked me why we weren't follow
ing policy. I told her that my [su
pervisor J told me to do it this way.
The only thing 1 was told was get
the envelopes out as quickly as
possible."
Hiller said new workers receive
training based upon their job de
scriptions and their previous expe
rience.
Escobedo said he is not current
ly planning legal action but has
not ruled out the possibility for
the future.
"It's not who's right and who's
wrong," Escobedo said. "It seems
more important concerning the
credit union members' money."
