# 167 undergraduates declare minors
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
They've only had the option since the start of
this school year, but 167 undergraduates have
already chosen to minor in more than 30 differ
ent departments.
According to Registrar Roger Printup, this
figure is "about right and a bit higher than I an
ticipated." Printup predicted it will be two years
before the overall number of students who minor
reaches expected levels.
Dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences John Shoven predicted in 1995 that 75 per
cent of undergraduates would eventually choose
to minor.
Printup explained the smaller number of stu
dents who are currently minoring can be ex
plained by the fact that much of this year's se
nior class has missed the opportunity to minor
and that current sophomores and juniors are not
yet under pressure to declare.
Increases in minoring will be seen once the
freshman class begins to declare, according to
Assoc. Vice Provost of Undergraduate Education
Ellen Woods. For freshman, "minors are a nat
ural part of the academic landscape," Woods
said.
Printup said students have already "voted
with their feet" in support of minors. However,
he doubts that the number of minors will ever
reach 75 percent of the student body because
there will still be a large number of students who
choose to pursue only a single or double major.
Several departments with large numbers of
registered minors, such as economics, psycholo
gy and computer science, are those which also at
tract the highest numbers of majors. The Eco
nomics Department currently leads the pack
with 36 registered minors.

According to Economics Prof. Ron McKinnon,
economics is an attractive minor for students
majoring in the humanities, who may choose the
minor to "appear more applied or practical." The
economics minor is helpful to students pursuing
computer science or engineering degrees who are
also interested in the business world, he said.
"Currently, I have a line of students out the
door to talk about minors," McKinnon said.
However, smaller programs including Span
ish, Japanese and African and Afro-American
Studies have also attracted minors. When the
program was first announced, some smaller de
partments expressed concern that the minor
would be too attractive and decrease the number
of majors. According to Woods, it is too early to
tell if the minor will have this effect on smaller
departments.
Minors are intended to allow more flexibility
in student schedules by giving students an op
tion besides the double major, said Undergradu
ate Advising Director Lori White.
According to White, double majors can "lock
in schedules" and limit academic flexibility. The
minor program, she said, works in the interest of
individuals, especially for those students who
have divergent interests. Now students can
"major in their primary interest and minor in
their secondary interest."
Choosing a minor can "increase [student]
marketability," White said. Minors are "attrac
tive to employers and help students prepare for
the work force and graduate schools."
No students have registered to minor in more
than one subject at this point, but Woods said
she would not be surprised to see this happen in
the future: "You know Stanford students."
"I wouldn't be surprised to see people even
with two majors and one minor," Printup said.
"But I hope that I don't."
