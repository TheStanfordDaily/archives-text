mering pointillistic detail, translating to sound the nine

Take a stroll down Market Street and check out the
10 kiosks featuring selections from David Byrne's

nations of images and icons. Byrne assembles im
ages of weapons and money and incorporates ad
like graphics that often distort or question our fields
of view. David Byrne was in the Talking Heads. On
and around Market Street, in San Francisco.
