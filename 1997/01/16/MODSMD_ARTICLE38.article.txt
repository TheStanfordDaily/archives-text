For rock star Hoc, singing and songwriting
don't just offer the opportunity to ex
press her ideas about music — they also
allow her to address the intense and confusing
feelings that can affect young women during
adolescence and beyond.
"I remember growing up that if guys were
really good at something, they became really
attractive, but the better you were at some
thing as a girl at my high school, whether you
were a great student or athlete, the less attrac
tive you became," she said in a recent interview.
"You know, it's too threatening, and that re
ally sucks. It's like, I'm afraid of letting people
know that I'm really good at this because then
I won't be asked out on a date, and that be
comes so extremely important when you're an
adolescent. That screws up a lot of women, and
then they feel like they have to keep it secret
how powerful they are."
With her soul-searching lyrics and fascina
tion with hell, Poe offers a style that is unique
and powerful: loping dance beats, electric gui
tars, acoustic ballads and swing jazz. She is
more than your average angry, alternative
rocker.
Although she has the persona of a starving
artist, she was educated at Princeton Universi
ty. She declared herself an independent at age
16, moved to New York City where she squat
ted in a building on the Lower East Side and
earned money by making fake subway tokens,
yet she has the sophistication and eloquence of
the upper class.
She does not use her birth name and does
not volunteer information about it. She is sim
ply known as Poe, a nickname she received

when she was about 10. "1 went to a costume
party with my parents where you dressed as a
character from a story, and people were sup
posed to guess who you were," she explained.
"I was really obsessed with Edgar Allan
Poe's ' The Masque of the Red Death,' which is
about a costume party where someone dresses
as the plague, and the emperor ends up dying.
"So I came dressed as death. They all
though it was hysterical, but I was so serious—
people were laughing and I was like, 'This is se
rious performance art!'"
Poe's interest in the darker side of humani
ty may have resulted from her family life. "Dad
was a director, and my mother was an actress,"
she said. "My parents were very dysfunctional,
which made by brother and 1 very close. We
had to be the best of friends at an early age, a
family crisis SWAT team of sorts."
Before she was 8 years old, Poe had lived in
North America, Europe, India and Africa.
After living in Africa for a year, Poe's family
moved to New York City and then to Provo,
Utah. "My brother and I were two of six non-
Mormons in a school of 1,600. It was a gor
geous place, but those school-bus Mormons
took one look at my Sex Pistols T-shirt and
hated my guts," she said.
Poe's irreverence is evident not just in her
clothing but also in her live performances.
Whereas many singers fear for their safety in
fanatic crowds and mosh pits, Poe likes to join
the fun. The first time she dove oft the stage, "It
was just total instinct.... This was a total leap
of faith in a way. The response is that [the au
dience] had the faith in me to let me be on
stage, and you kinda take a leap of faith in re-
