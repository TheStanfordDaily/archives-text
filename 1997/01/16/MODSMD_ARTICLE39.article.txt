# Women Rock
## Poe takes up where Alanis left off 
### 
turn by trusting that they'll take good care of
you while you're out there," she said.
Aware of the potential danger of the situa
tion, she knows how to protect herself and ad
vises other women to do the same. "One thing
I learned very quickly is that if someone is try
ing to grab you in a place you don't like, you can
find them by grabbing their hand and locking
your hand down their arm. They're comfort
able doing it because they're anonymous, but if
you catch them and you look them in the eye,
you see such a feeling of shame. One time, 1
bopped the guy in the head, and he waited two
hours after the show to apologize.
"It's sad, but the world isn't going to change
overnight. So, women have to take control and
protect themselves. I'm not saying that what a
guy does to any woman in any situation is
right, but the more empowered women can
become, the better off they will be."
Poe said she feels that women are still being
repressed. However, "A lot of the repression we
do to ourselves by trying to fulfill societal
norms and expectations.
"I'm a hopeless optimist when it comes to
believing in the power of the human spirit. I

don't believe that anybody should be underes
timated. People throw other humans away too
quickly."
Unafraid of her own power and artistic po
tential, her "agenda in life is to wake up in the
morning and discover something new, create
something new. Happiness to me isn't like,
'Wow, everything's great.' Happiness is when
you feel yourself growing and sometimes that's
painful. Hut then, happiness is painful," Foe
said.
In light of this perspective, it is not surpris
ing that Foe was an Knglish and creative writ
ing major at Princeton, where she learned how
to "learn wise," she said. "1 got turned on to an
enormous amount of cool stuff, from film to
books to ways of thinking, but I think that I've
learned more since I left school because i now)
you're in the context of real life so that there s
heaviness to it."
Real life has not disappointed her yet.
Growing exponentially in popularity, Foe is
bound for success but staying level-headed.
She realizes, in a line she'll include in a future
song, that "the future is a slut; she promises
herself to everyone."


Poe gets political.
