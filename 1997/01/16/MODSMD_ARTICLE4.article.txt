Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
bin Mohamad began a two-day visit to
Stanford yesterday with a speech at
Memorial Auditorium about his coun
try's plans to become a world center for
multimedia development and applica
tion.
In introducing the prime minister,
Dean of the Graduate School of Business
Mike Spence said: "He is a dynamic leader
who understands what it takes to create

an environment where economic growth
and social justice thrive together."
Mohamad then proceeded to tell the
audience of students and business com
munity members about the centerpiece of
Malaysia's agenda: the creation of a Mul
timedia Super Corridor. The government
has already set aside 270 square miles
near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital
and business center, for this purpose, he
explained.
The Multimedia Super Corridor will
offer several important advantages to
companies involved in the development

and application of multimedia that would
like to locate facilities there, Mohamad
said.
The corridor "will have the best physi
cal infrastructure that can be offered in
the world," he explained. The project will
also benefit from a superior legal infra
structure, a high-capacity telecommuni
cations network and a single government
agency to market the whole concept.
The eventual goal is to have the entire
country working and living in new ways
