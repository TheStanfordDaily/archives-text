### Bimal Shah Contributing writer 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
bin Mohamad began a two-day visit to
Stanford yesterday with a speech at
Memorial Auditorium about his coun
try's plans to become a world center for
multimedia development and applica
tion.
In introducing the prime minister,
Dean of the Graduate School of Business
Mike Spence said: "He is a dynamic leader
who understands what it takes to create

an environment where economic growth
and social justice thrive together."
Mohamad then proceeded to tell the
audience of students and business com
munity members about the centerpiece of
Malaysia's agenda: the creation of a Mul
timedia Super Corridor. The government
has already set aside 270 square miles
near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital
and business center, for this purpose, he
explained.
The Multimedia Super Corridor will
offer several important advantages to
companies involved in the development

and application of multimedia that would
like to locate facilities there, Mohamad
said.
The corridor "will have the best physi
cal infrastructure that can be offered in
the world," he explained. The project will
also benefit from a superior legal infra
structure, a high-capacity telecommuni
cations network and a single government
agency to market the whole concept.
The eventual goal is to have the entire
country working and living in new ways
made possible by information tech
nology, Mohamad stated. Malaysia
should be a developed country by
2020, -he predicted.
Although the multimedia pro
ject is; large-scale, "Malaysia is not
tryinjg to create a replica of Silicon
Valley or Hollywood," Mohamad
said. *We realize you are more ad
vanced and we have much to
learn."
The prime minister stressed re
peatedly during his speech that co
operation is in the mutual interest
of everyone. "It is no longer a zero
sum game with winners and
losers," Mohamad said.
While admitting that his plans

are ambitious for a small country,
Mohamad said that "America itself
was a small country in the 19th
century." While Britain launched
the Industrial Revolution, Ameri
ca was its greatest beneficiary be
cause the country offered a setting
where technology could better ful
fill its potential, he explained.
Malaysia has several advan
tages that could allow it to become
a success story as well, Mohamad
said. He listed the country's loca
tion in Southeast Asia, its relative
ly low costs and its lack of en
trenched political interests as at
tributes.
"We are a pragmatic govern
ment which has consistently
proven its critics wrong," the prime
minister pointed out.
After his speech, Mohamad
fielded questions from the audi

ence. Later, he met in a closed-door
session with a number of students.
"I was impressed with the kind
of thinking and planning that's
gone into this thing," said doctoral
student Daniel Wong. "It will be in
teresting to see how this develops."
But fellow doctoral student Ed
ward Chan was more critical. "It
sounds like he has the will to gam
ble the future of Malaysia on the
project," Chan said. If there are
signs that the project is failing, "I
hope he has the political will to turn
around," Chan added.
The prime minister's speech
was sponsored by the Business
School. Kenichi Ohmae, a visiting
professor at the school and one of
the world's leading experts on glob
al business strategy, was instru
mental in bringing Mohamad to
the University.
