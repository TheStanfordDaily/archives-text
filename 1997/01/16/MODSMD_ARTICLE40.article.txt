# Caught in the Act
## JOHN WRIGHT: ACTOR 
### Laura Shin 
"Lots of free nookie if you go to Ram's
Head" are the words John Wright heard
before auditioning and getting cast last fall
in a lead role for a Winter One Act.
Wright did not verify whether he had
personally found that to be true, but this
sophomore from Providence, R. 1. seems
to have enjoyed acting in senior Rudy Del
son's "Waiting for 'Waiting for Godot'
anyway.
Cast as Maynard, one of the two main
characters who are waiting to see the play
"Waiting for Godot," Wright has discov
ered many "cool" things about acting in a
student-written and student-directed
play.
Though initially lured by the idea that
"a bunch of college students just got to
gether and did [a production) them
selves," Wright has actually found that the
fact the play is "student-run is not a big
function" of the play.
"More unique is that it's student-writ
ten," said Wright. Since it's an original
play, the cast can't rent a video of the per
formance and "to try to cop someone
else's style."
By the same token, he finds that he feels
like changing the script at times. For in
stance, he might prefer
to have the character

swear "instead of this
gosh-darn-it thing."
However, Wright
fights this desire to edit,
he said, because he
wants to give more re
spect to student writers,
who are "trying to make
it" with their first, or
one of their first, origi
nal works.
The respect that
Wright accords his
playwriting peers ac
companies the high ex
pectations he has for
them, as well as the
other students involved
in the show — the cast
and the director. He en
visions them acting on
or writing for Broadway
in the future and finds it
exciting that some of his
co-workers will be fa
mous some day.
Even though many
of his fellow cast mem
bers have less experi
ence than the actors and
actresses he's worked
with through depart
mental productions,

Wright finds that their inexperience can
make the work new and interesting be
cause of its "freshness."
Due to the differences between this play
and non-student-run shows, Wright has
become much more aware that everyone
has a different vision for the play, but that
"it's much better to go with the How ...
just improvise and go with whatever's
working."
On the flip side, Wright has discerned a
hesitation among the cast members to ex
press their feelings and troubles — a prob
lem that he feels results from the relative
inexperience of the cast.
Wright's own experience with perfor
mance began when he was a 2- or 3-year
old monster — literally. He co-starred in
family performances with his twin broth
er in "Cookie Monster and the Cookie
Tree." Since then, he has done a variety of
high school musicals and church produc
tions, as well as three different shows in his
first year at Stanford.
In the future he would like to try his
hand at directing, in addition to his real
dream of becoming a rap star. These are
just some of the things he does to fill the
time while he's "Waiting for Waiting for
Godot." He's waiting so anxiously, in fact,
that when the phone rings he belts out a
one-syllable, "Who???"
