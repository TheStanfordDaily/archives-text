# Diary of a Winter One Act
## ROBIN MORONEY: WRITER

The first play I ever wrote, aged 17, ended
up a bad joke. Despite the fact it was the
only entry for my high school's play
writing competition, it still managed to come
runner-up. My second, and more successful,
play "The Voluntary Inane," which will be per
formed as part of Winter One Acts this quarter,
was written at the end of the summer holidays
last year. Before I submitted the play I asked the
advice of my friend Alex Sepiol, who suggested
radical but sound revisions and has kindly
maintained that role since.
The play is a comedy about a poet called
Stanley Carpenter who goes mad and starts
making chicken ads. As well as the normal char
acters, there is a chorus made up of artistic
stereotypes such as The Alcoholic Novelist or
The Avant-Garde Artist, etc.

Arti Garg was chosen by the Ram's Head
cabal as director for my show. She seems sound
enough, although her statement that, as a poet,
she felt empathy with Stanley set alarm bells
ringing. In all the world, teen-age poets along
with vegetarians are the people whom 1 trust the
least. One confuses writing verse with being a
poet and the other confuses cooking with
morality.

I got a message from Sam Park, editor of In
termission, asking me to write about the pro
duction process for the "Voluntary Inane." He
said it should be like the Madonna Diaries in
Vanity Fair. I find it rather bizarre that when he

looks for the sexiest man on campus for his
magazine he gets my Resident Assistant and
when he's looking for a Madonna he finds me.
Acting auditions were the first time I could
see people react to the play first-hand. Some
lines worked and some didn't, and it was obvi
ous a rewrite was needed. Arti has a peculiar
method of auditioning which she calls "seeing it
the actor's got range." What this means is that
she asks the actors to read a passage and then, 30
seconds in, stops them and asks them to read it
as if they were 3 years old, or Mick Jagger, or
Mount Rushmore, or whatever else randomly
comes into her head. The actors generally look
confused and look at the script and wonder how
they could have misread the speech so hadly.

I'm finishing off the second rewrite while act
ing in a movie for a friend's film class. 1 have to
alternate between acting stoned and the rewrite.
It's far harder doing the rewrite. I sit in front of
a computer screen for ages trying to make a
scene less pretentious and funnier, agonizing
over whether someone should say, "The dog
stopped halfway across" or "Halfway across, the
dog stopped." When I'm filming the movie I
simply say, "Why don't I just fill my mouth lull
of whipped cream?"

Went to my first rehearsal today. Larry
[ Lazar| and Dominic |Yu| were rehearsing the
psychiatrist scene, which is my favorite. It's the
most fluid, least forced and funniest scene — it
basically wrote itself. Early rehearsals are almost

entirely non-productive. Actors have hardly any
idea of who they're playing nor any idea of what
they're saying.
Arti also arranged a screening of a Monty
Python film for the cast, on the grounds that it'll
show the cast how to act the play. Americans
generally tend to associate all English people
with either Imperialism or Monty Python so I
shouldn't be surprised.

I've been to two chorus rehearsals so far. Arti
always begins them by sitting everybody down
and making them share a moment from their
day. Since the theater rarely attracts anybody
with a well-balanced personality, these sessions
normally turn into a catalogue of dire emotion
al conflict, crashed cars and paper extensions.
The first chorus rehearsal, which was last week,
was rather discouraging. It was meant to be a
simple question of blocking, or how you arrange
the actors when they're on stage. Arti seemed to
have little direction and would get wound up
over small details, leaving the bigger picture to
ruin itself on its own.
This was the first time I'd seen the actors react
to the rewrite. On the whole the reaction was
positive. There was a problem with a joke about
platitudes which was because nobody knew
what a platitude was. It's probably just as well;
the play is full of them.
The second rehearsal was more positive al
though only four actors showed up. However,
some great work was made in terms of establish
ing character traits, which is terribly important
for the comedy of the chorus to work. There was
some debate as to what sort of drug the
Drugged-Out Rock Star was on and in the end

pot won out. The Alcoholic Novelist is no longer
depressed and is happy to be drunk, and The
Balding Professor has gone from being an Eng
lish schoolmarm to being an abrasive New York
dyke intellectual. She's still not bald, however.
Arti raised a few points about the script. One
was the repeated use of the word "miserable" in
Gemma's monologue. I said I'd need to hear it
said before I changed it. She also thought that a
reference to soccer at a crucial plot twist was too
obscure for Americans. This rather riled me. I
thought it would be nice for America to be on
the receiving end of cultural imperialism for a
change. How do you think Europeans feel about
"Baywatch"?

Been to a lot of rehearsals. My neuroses in
crease about the play. I seem to be the only one
aware of some serious flaws that I have no idea
how to address.
The chorus has come along nicely in terms of
comedy. Chloe [Conger] used to be wounded
when it was suggested her character was ridicu
lous. ("She's just misunderstood"). She is now
flailing around and jealously exclaiming, "Why
isn't anybody laughing at me?" Simone |Ag
nolucci) plays the Suicidal Vamp with nice pre
cision. John Knag, who plays The Avant-Garde
Artist, is getting good at striking poses. The only
weak link is Becky [Zimmerman] who's still un
comfortable with being a drunk. The chorus are
finally beginning to gel, coming up with jokes
that are independent from my script but are also
entirely appropriate to it.
Alex is doing quite a star turn with his cameo
as The Gay Soldier's Wife. He had a similarly

small and funny part in One Acts last year and
hopes to create an Alex-Sepiol-Funny-Gay-
Small-Part tradition at Stanford.
The other actors have harder jobs, since
they have to combine their comedy with re
alism. John Wayland has interpreted his role
as monotonic and pretentious, like Tony
Roberts in Woody Allen films. He's battling
mono and announced at the beginning of the
second run-through that the doctors put him
on a new drug on top of codeine and then
laughed like a man possessed. Normally he's
one of the quieter people in the cast but this
time he was irrepressible, tapping tables,
bouncing up and down, pale as snow, sick as
shit, high as a kite. The new medication cer
tainly made for interesting new acting choic
es.
I just found out that the set now includes
a Roman column and some topiary. I have no
idea how the set designer came up with this.

Went to a production meeting. The main
focus of discussion were images suggested
for the poster. "Waiting for Waiting for
Godot" got a lamp, "Connection Down" an
unplugged computer, and we, surreally, got a
window, on top of some pyramids with a
ring of Saturn around it. All the topiary,
Monty Python comparisons and pyramids
that my script seems to bring out in people
make me wonder if there are, perhaps, two
"The Voluntary Inanes" floating around
Ram's Head.

Met with the lighting director over supper
at Casa Italiana, who turned out to be a girl
called Minji Kim from my freshman dorm.
My script requires some pretty complex
lighting changes, and since we're sharing the
same lighting setup with two other plays we
had to make concessions. When I got back to
Kairos I was greeted by a group of angry fel
low residents demanding to know why I'd
missed supper hash. I told them it was be
cause I'd been bringing light to a theatrical
masterpiece. They told me to mop the floor.
11/12/96
Rehearsals have basically shut down for fi
nals. Arti and I rehearsed with Larry, who's
having difficulty. His ego is too large for him
to suppress and leaks out of a character who's
meant to be self-effacing and humble.
6/1/97
Christmas break was spent trying to re
buff allegations that I'd become a playwright.
"All I've done is write a one-act play," I'd
protest. I soon discovered that a description
of the play's plot was all that was required to
make people realize that, in fact, I'm nothing
like a competent playwright. "Is it a come
dy?" people would ask. "Only if they laugh at
the funny parts," I replied. "If they laugh at
anything else in the play it'll be a tragedy."
The first day back on campus was spent
building sets.
7/1/97
Sana [Hanible], who played the Drugged-
Out Rock Star, has fallen ill. This is an awful
blow. Sana had little to work with, but the
few lines she had she turned into pure gold.
We've managed to get George Mitchell, who

was in"The Inspector General" last quarter,
to replace her.
The first run-through since the holidays
went well. Becky decided to Method the part
of the Alcoholic Novelist by turning up to re
hearsal absolutely plastered. She did an in
credibly good job of standing up, I thought. I
hope it was as helpful for her acting as it was
damaging to her liver.
8/1/97
Arti and 1 did some individual work with
Micah Schaffer, who plays Yuri, the mad
Russian theater director. The Nitery was
locked so we rehearsed in a courtyard beside
Old Union. The University's bureaucracy all
stared out of their windows in disbelief at a
small female student and a curly-haired Eng
lishman intently watching a blond Russian
screaming about dog's blood and vomit
being spread all over the road.

We're running out of rehearsal time. The
big problem now is pace — without it, the
play dies. The regular scenes are finally pick
ing up, but the chorus is still lagging. The
play essentially works like a scatter-gun. The
actors have to get as many jokes out as possi
ble and hope that some of them hit.
George has fitted into the chorus nicely,
lending his incredible brand of physical
dyslexia to the role.
The posters have come out, and I like the
design, even if the color-scheme makes them
like intensely '70s.
Did the photo shoot for Intermission,
with Fred Savage, director of "Connection
Down," Jon Wright, an actor in "Waiting for
Waiting for Godot." Sam asked me to look
less pretentious. He might just as well have
asked Michael Jordan to look less tall. The
shoot was an odd reminder that "The Volun

tary Inane" is not the only Winter One Act
being produced. I never really thought about
the other shows apart from when I was pray
ing that mine wouldn't be the worst.
11/1/97
We had a more general photo shoot today,
which was all rather forced. The photos were
meant to be along the lines of "Director Fred
Savage gives character advice to actress Anne
Cunha" or "The One Act writers discuss the
unique problems of writing for the stage." It
was more like "Director Fred Savage search
es for something to say" and"The One Act
writers notice how the seams of Robin Mo
roney's brown jeans are splitting."
I realize now that the only thing that "The
Voluntary Inane" really needs at this stage is
pace. Frustratingly, therefore, there is noth
ing I can do to help the play other than pray
that the actors study their lines.
Thursday, "The Voluntary Inane" 's first
night, looms larger and larger in my diary.
My excitement about having my play staged
is mingled with a nervousness bordering on
hyperventilation that it won't be well-re
ceived. I don't care if the play doesn't change
people's lives, but I do hope that, at the very
least, people will be entertained.
