# Diary of a Winter One Act

The first play I ever wrote, aged 17, ended
up a bad joke. Despite the fact it was the
only entry for my high school's play
writing competition, it still managed to come
runner-up. My second, and more successful,
play "The Voluntary Inane," which will be per
formed as part of Winter One Acts this quarter,
was written at the end of the summer holidays
last year. Before I submitted the play I asked the
advice of my friend Alex Sepiol, who suggested
radical but sound revisions and has kindly
maintained that role since.
The play is a comedy about a poet called
Stanley Carpenter who goes mad and starts
making chicken ads. As well as the normal char
acters, there is a chorus made up of artistic
stereotypes such as The Alcoholic Novelist or
The Avant-Garde Artist, etc.

Arti Garg was chosen by the Ram's Head
cabal as director for my show. She seems sound
enough, although her statement that, as a poet,
she felt empathy with Stanley set alarm bells
ringing. In all the world, teen-age poets along
with vegetarians are the people whom 1 trust the
least. One confuses writing verse with being a
poet and the other confuses cooking with
morality.

I got a message from Sam Park, editor of In
termission, asking me to write about the pro
duction process for the "Voluntary Inane." He
said it should be like the Madonna Diaries in
Vanity Fair. I find it rather bizarre that when he

looks for the sexiest man on campus for his
magazine he gets my Resident Assistant and
when he's looking for a Madonna he finds me.
Acting auditions were the first time I could
see people react to the play first-hand. Some
lines worked and some didn't, and it was obvi
ous a rewrite was needed. Arti has a peculiar
method of auditioning which she calls "seeing it
the actor's got range." What this means is that
she asks the actors to read a passage and then, 30
seconds in, stops them and asks them to read it
as if they were 3 years old, or Mick Jagger, or
Mount Rushmore, or whatever else randomly
comes into her head. The actors generally look
confused and look at the script and wonder how
they could have misread the speech so hadly.

I'm finishing off the second rewrite while act
ing in a movie for a friend's film class. 1 have to
alternate between acting stoned and the rewrite.
It's far harder doing the rewrite. I sit in front of
a computer screen for ages trying to make a
scene less pretentious and funnier, agonizing
over whether someone should say, "The dog
stopped halfway across" or "Halfway across, the
dog stopped." When I'm filming the movie I
simply say, "Why don't I just fill my mouth lull
of whipped cream?"

Went to my first rehearsal today. Larry
[ Lazar| and Dominic |Yu| were rehearsing the
psychiatrist scene, which is my favorite. It's the
most fluid, least forced and funniest scene â€” it
basically wrote itself. Early rehearsals are almost

entirely non-productive. Actors have hardly any
idea of who they're playing nor any idea of what
they're saying.
Arti also arranged a screening of a Monty
Python film for the cast, on the grounds that it'll
show the cast how to act the play. Americans
generally tend to associate all English people
with either Imperialism or Monty Python so I
shouldn't be surprised.

I've been to two chorus rehearsals so far. Arti
always begins them by sitting everybody down
and making them share a moment from their
day. Since the theater rarely attracts anybody
with a well-balanced personality, these sessions
normally turn into a catalogue of dire emotion
al conflict, crashed cars and paper extensions.
The first chorus rehearsal, which was last week,
was rather discouraging. It was meant to be a
simple question of blocking, or how you arrange
the actors when they're on stage. Arti seemed to
have little direction and would get wound up
over small details, leaving the bigger picture to
ruin itself on its own.
This was the first time I'd seen the actors react
to the rewrite. On the whole the reaction was
positive. There was a problem with a joke about
platitudes which was because nobody knew
what a platitude was. It's probably just as well;
the play is full of them.
The second rehearsal was more positive al
though only four actors showed up. However,
some great work was made in terms of establish
ing character traits, which is terribly important
for the comedy of the chorus to work. There was
some debate as to what sort of drug the
Drugged-Out Rock Star was on and in the end

pot won out. The Alcoholic Novelist is no longer
depressed and is happy to be drunk, and The
Balding Professor has gone from being an Eng
lish schoolmarm to being an abrasive New York
dyke intellectual. She's still not bald, however.
Arti raised a few points about the script. One
was the repeated use of the word "miserable" in
Gemma's monologue. I said I'd need to hear it
said before I changed it. She also thought that a
reference to soccer at a crucial plot twist was too
obscure for Americans. This rather riled me. I
thought it would be nice for America to be on
the receiving end of cultural imperialism for a
change. How do you think Europeans feel about
"Baywatch"?

Been to a lot of rehearsals. My neuroses in
crease about the play. I seem to be the only one
aware of some serious flaws that I have no idea
how to address.
The chorus has come along nicely in terms of
comedy. Chloe [Conger] used to be wounded
when it was suggested her character was ridicu
lous. ("She's just misunderstood"). She is now
flailing around and jealously exclaiming, "Why
isn't anybody laughing at me?" Simone |Ag
nolucci) plays the Suicidal Vamp with nice pre
cision. John Knag, who plays The Avant-Garde
Artist, is getting good at striking poses. The only
weak link is Becky [Zimmerman] who's still un
comfortable with being a drunk. The chorus are
finally beginning to gel, coming up with jokes
that are independent from my script but are also
entirely appropriate to it.
Alex is doing quite a star turn with his cameo
as The Gay Soldier's Wife. He had a similarly
