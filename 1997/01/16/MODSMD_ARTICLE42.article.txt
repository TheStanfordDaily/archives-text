## FRED SAVAGE: DIRECTOR 
### Laura Shin 
"Is this a kissing book?" the
young Joey skeptically asks his
grandfather. If junior Fred
Savage has grown up to be a
college-age version of the little
boy he played in"The Princess
Bride," then the audience is
not going to see any kissing in
the Winter One Act "Connec
tion Down" by sophomore
Jon Goldman. Fortunately,
Savage, in his first directing
experience ever, has not had to
coach many smooches, for
this play is more concerned
with computer MUD (Multi-
User Dungeon) chemistry
than with physical chemistry.
Savage himself, though,
underwent some experiments
as he transformed from TV /
movie star to theater director.
INTER MI SSI ON: What do
you like about directing better
than acting?
FRED SAVAGE: I've most en
joyed working with the actors.
When you're acting, everyone

— even the audience — says,"It could have
been like this." When you're an actor, you bite
your tongue because it's not your place to cri
tique other actors. 1 wanted to go in there and,
instead of just saying, "Oh, it could have been
like this," to really make it like that. And it's
fun not performing for a little while. I have in
credible respect for anyone who shows others
what they've created — like the painters that
hang their paintings in the Coffee House, or
the writers of these plays, who have submitted
these plays for the audience's approval. But
actors are unique because they can't hang
their painting or show their script and then go
hide. Acting—especially live in the theater —
is such a humbling experience because you're
so vulnerable. You're out there, selling your
self to the audience in hopes that they'll like
you. If they don't, you try not to get too upset
about it and go on to the next night. I have rel
ished being able to sit back and watch, instead
of being out there.
l:Why did you want to direct this time instead
of act?
FS: I can see myself directing in the future. I
don't know if anyone I've worked with can see
that, you have to ask them. (Laughs.) One
Acts is a great place to explore directing be
cause they give chances to inexperienced di
rectors. It's not a grand production, like Clai
eties, with ornate sets and special lighting.
One Acts are a more scaled-down produc
tion. So I had less to screw up. For a first shot,
there wasn't a whole lot to get in the way of
what I wanted to do, which was work with the
actors.
/; Do you think the other students in the cast
give you more respect because you've acted pro
fessionally?
FS: No, no, I don't think so at all. I definitely
did not come in thinking 1 commanded more
respect. I came in very humble because many
of them had more experience directing and

acting in theater than I had. I came in intimi
dated by them since they were so established
in theater acting. I feel very much on an even
keel with the actors. We're all in the trenches,
working on this. We're all staying up late and
all giving up a lot.
/: Would you ever try writing?
FS: I wrote a couple scenes in high school that
were performed by our theater company, but
nothing spectacular. My major is English with
an emphasis in creative writing, so I've writ
ten stories but no scripts. I have incredible re
spect for the writers of these plays. One Acts
are so difficult because in a short period of
time, you have to create a story that not only
will [allow] the audience to get the back
ground and the nuances but will also be re
solved. For a normal play, they have three or
four times as long to do what a One Act writer
has to do in about 30 pages.
/: What will he the most memorable part oj di
recting this One Act?
FS: Opening night — the big moment of pre
sentation. You work on something for so
long, and then you present it — just that mo
ment — (gesturing with open arms) "Ahh,
here you go." That first moment is going to be
verv exciting. When you're a little kid, you
make breakfast in bed for your mom, and it's
terrible. But you've worked really hard on it.
And when you go in her room with a tray, it's
"Here vou go. I've worked so hard on this tor
vou — enjoy it." And that's what I feel like
opening night will be like: "Here, enjoy and
tell us what you think." The audience may,
just as your mom may look at the burnt toast
and runny eggs and be like, "OK thanks,' and
then throw it away, which is fine, but I hope
our play is more than burnt toast and runny
eggs. The point I want to make is that the pre
sentation is the most exciting part because it's
before you get a response. It's that first mo
ment before any judgments have been made
and any opinions been formed when you can
go out unfettered.
