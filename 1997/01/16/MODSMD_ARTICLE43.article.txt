## Coming Home 'Marvin's Room' a welcome place for serious moviegoers 
### 
There's nothing pretty about this picture.
So if you're averse to aging, death and dis
ease, maybe you should stay away.
However, perhaps those of us who tend to
avoid such uncomfortable subjects are most
in need of this hard-core dose of reality. For
though the lack of glamour in this movie can
be a bit unsettling, it's good for you.
"Marvin's Room" is a very un-Holly
woodish story about Bessie (Diane Keaton),
a middle America old maid who has spent
most of her adult life caring for her incapaci
tated father Marvin (Hume Cronyn) and her
slowly deteriorating Aunt Ruth (Gwen Ver
don). When her own health begins to de
cline, Bessie contacts her estranged sister Lee
(Meryl Streep) for bone marrow compatibil
ity testing.
So the sisters reunite after 20-some years,
and to the surface rise old resentments about
the roads not taken — caring for one's rela
tives vs. indulging in cosmetology school.
Meanwhile, there's a compelling subplot
about Lee's eldest son Hank (Leonardo Di-
Caprio), a very disturbed young man who
finds a bit of salvation from his loving aunt.
While the plot may be relatively mediocre,
the acting in this movie is spectacular.
Keaton, Streep and DiCaprio are all at their
super-emotionally charged best. I also com
mend their bravery for their honest depic
tion of normal people. Despite the mislead
ing posters for the movie, they are each bold
in their realistic portrayals: Diane has dark
ened teeth, a frumpy wig and polyester pants,

Meryl sports a
tacky hairdo and
cheap clothes,
and Leonardo
wears dingy T
shirts and an un
attractive scowl.
The film's
bluntness in fac
ing an issue that
Americans are
uncomfortable
with is another
commendable act
of courage. We
watch "ER" for
the healthy and
attractive doctors
and nurses, not
for the decrepit
patients. We pre
fer not to deal
with the in -
evitability of bod
ily decline, de
pendence on pills
and needles and
the problem of
feeding and
cleaning our el
ders. Like Lee,
we'd prefer to
stick our old rela
tives in nursing

homes with TVs and walk away. This movie
forces us to turn around and take another
look at these basic human issues.
Part of the genius of this movie is its abili
ty to be at once serious and funny. The in
competent and socially delinquent Dr. Wally
(Robert DeNiro) is hilarious, as is the kooky

soap opera-obsessed Aunt Ruth, with her
electronic garage-door-triggering anes
thetizer.
Despite any natural assumptions about a
movie with this subject matter, "Marvin's
Room" is not a total downer.
In fact, the old and dying seem to have

more love in their lives than the young and
hardened.
Ultimately, there's something about it that
really got under my skin. It didn't make me
cry, but it made me think, hard. For this, I
consider it worthwhile.
