# Fly Down to Disaster
## Liotta's 'Turbulence' shaky in plot, direction and acting 
### 
The movie industry's latest mainstream
thriller, "Turbulence," has little more to
offer the viewer than slight airsickness. A
generic adventure film with a par avion
twist, "Turbulence" attempts to combine a
treacherous, weather-beaten cross-country
flight with the on-board escape and ensuing
chaos of two death-row criminals. Unfortu
nately, the formula only results in failure.
The action begins when Stubbs (Brendan
Gleeson), the cruder of two criminals, man
ages to unshackle himself and kill his atten
dant (with a soap dispenser no less) during
a routine lavatory break. The hardened

though charming serial killer, Ryan Weaver
(Ray Liotta), is then left as the only accept
able intermediary between the armed and
irrational Stubbs and the lives of the few
passengers and flight attendants on board.
In the scuffle, both pilots, all four armed
guards and Stubbs are shot or killed in the
crossfire. This miraculously occurs at
27,000 feet, mind you.
The rest of the movie is a psychological
interplay between Weaver and his object of
desire, ditzy flight attendant Teri Halloran
(Lauren Holly). The plot takes an absurd
turn when Teri tries to simultaneously ma
neuver the jumbo jet through a "level 6"
(out of 6) storm, land the jet solo at Los An
geles International Airport, avoid the mis

siles of a military bomber assigned to elimi
nate the plane and deal with psycho Wtaver,
who's beating down the cabin door with a
hatchet.
Although Liotta almost manages to play
a psychotic serial killer convincingly, with
appropriate use of facial expression and
vocal inflection, the downfall of the movie is
Holly's pitiful attempt at portraying the
"smart, independent .. . gutsy and heroic"
flight attendant envisioned in the press re
lease. I spent most of the movie cursing her
failure to discover Weaver's true identity as a
dangerous criminal and her meek, flighty,
downright dumb depiction of a woman in a
time of crisis.
"Turbulence" did keep me on the edge of

my seat, although I'm not sure whether this
was due to my intense fear of Hying or my
frustration with Holly's depiction of a hero
ine. This film qualifies as a cheap thriller but
lacks any sort of realistic plot, character de
velopment or dialogue. My favorite line was,
"She's just a stewardess for God's sake," and
the air traffic controller's reply, "No, she's a
(light attendant" — a real plug for political
correctness.
If you're capable of "willing suspension
of disbelief" this movie may be for you, oth
erwise you can join me and the other three
quarters of the sneak-preview audience who
found themselves laughing hysterically dur
ing the credits.
