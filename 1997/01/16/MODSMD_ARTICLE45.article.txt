# Sleaze!
## Good performances don't compensate for tasteless subject matter in 'The People vs. Larry Flynt' 
### 
The hype surrounding "The People vs. Larry Flynt" has
exceeded the wildest wet dreams of any public relations
agent. For weeks now, radio, TV and even The New Yorker
have been filled with ads promoting the story of the lewdest,
crudest and all-together baddest defender of the First
Amendment that the United States has ever seen — the
porn king, Lirry Flynt.
"The People vs. Lrry Flynt" is supposedly this month's
alternative film. It's what you'd see if you think yourself
steeled against and interested in any type of sexual perversi
ty.
But what is "The People vs. Urry Flynt" actually all
about? The film starts with a few shots of white-trash boot
legger children, a stereotype so politically incorrect and
amusingly in bad taste that one's hopes for the movie are
raised. Perhaps the entire film will be this campy, a self-par
ody of worthwhile proportions.
The life of Lirry Flynt is a fascinating case study, and
Woody Harrelson plays the part with great aplomb. From
the start of the notoriously sleazy Hustler magazine to his
paralysis resulting from an assassination attempt to his
challenge in the Supreme Court of Jerry Falwell's personal
harm claims, Harrelson's Flynt is a lovable rascal, exactly the
type anyone would want to see defending freedom of
speech.
Courtney Love plays Althea Flynt — the stripper turned
wife turned junkie — convincingly well (no surprise). Her
portrayal of the '80s rock-star type, complete with red
leather dress, pink lace gloves and rainbow fluffed hair is a
poignant reminder of just how scary human taste can be.
However, Althea's character is inherently one-dimensional,
and despite Love's valiant efforts watching Althea's down
ward spiral eventually becomes boring. By the time she dies
of AIDS, Althea's character is no longer relevant to the
movie.
"The People vs. Larry Flynt" does have a distinctly
baroque tint throughout, from Flynt's fashion sense to his
obnoxious publicity antics to his mourning for his dead
wife at the end of the film. At first, one might see this
overblown quality as typical Hollywoodness, just as the
sniper attack on Flynt's life smacked of Oliver Stoniness
(who is the co-producer). But Flynt was himself a baroque
figure, and the medium does him justice and makes his
seem less despicable.
This is probably the greatest problem with "The People
vs. Larry Flynt." Flynt repeatedly admits what a scumball he
is, but the film does nothing to show this. Aside from one
orgy scene before Flynt is married, there is no sign of the
true promiscuity of Flynt's lifestyle; once Flynt is married,
the film portrays him as practically monogamous with
Althea.
Even though people continually object to Hustler maga
zine throughout the movie, "The People vs. I-arry Flynt"
does nothing to show exactly how disgusting and violent
the images of women in Hustler magazine usually were
(and are). "The People vs. Lirry Flynt" lionizes Flynt so that
our sympathy will be entirely with him when he defends all
of our constitutional rights.
Yet the real Flynt is not a great man, nor even a hero by
most people's standards. "The People vs. luirry Flynt" is a
great escapist film, but in the end its refusal to show the dark
side of the pornography industry and its leaders seems al
most as much of a moral travesty as the suppression of free
speech Flynt continually faced.
