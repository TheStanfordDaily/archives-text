## Chan kicks butt with terrific 'First Strike' 
### 
With tongue-in-check humor and
action so exciting it makes you grip your
armrests, "Jackie Chan's First Strike"
makes for a thoroughly entertaining
movie.
The flick has its flaws: A fairly weak
plot involving a nuclear arms trade,
Jackie Chan (whose character's name is
also Jackie Chan) being framed for
murder and a damsel in distress. There
is little to no character development
with the exception of Chan's character
— an agent based out of Hong Kong
who fights the bad guys while maintain
ing a self-deprecating sense of humor.
Also, its script is written in such a way
that the dubbed lines sort of fit over the
movement of the actors speaking in
Chinese, producing some corny, unnat
ural dialogue.

Despite these shortcomings, the ac
tion sequences alone make it worthwhile.
In one sequence, Chan, on a snow
board, is chased by goons wearing Fred
dy Krueger masks on snowmobiles
down a Ukraine mountain slope. In an
other scene he holds off about 10 bad
guys with a broom, a ladder and some
awesome martial arts moves.
Constantly present during the action
is Chan's sense of humor, a nice throw
back to physical comedians such as
buster Keaton. During the snowmobile
chase, Chan wears a ridiculously
adorable harp seal hat. In another scene,
he is forced to confront his suspect while
wearing an amusement park costume in
the form of a very bulbous shark.
Also constantly present is Chan's in
credible physical grace. For instance, he
makes leaping between the rungs of a
ladder and shimming down a wall nat
ural and beautiful feats.

The series of outtakes of stunts-gone
wrong which ends the movie not only
shows some of the pain that went into
those eventually beautiful feats but
proves that the stunts were for real.
Chan, as a former stuntman and the best
martial artist on film since Bruce Lee,
now serves as his own stuntman without
the aid of expensive special effects. Per
haps that is why this Hong Kong pro
duction, outside of the slick, glossy, big
budget Hollywood movie-machine, has
a rugged, more authentic feel. This au
thenticity gives the action an exciting
spirit missing from the "bigger is better"
productions of Hollywood. No comput •
er graphics or animation — it's the real
thing, baby.
Despite its plentiful faults, Chan's
showmanship is so incredible and his
humor so endearing, who really cares? 1
felt like "Jackie Chans First Strike" had
given me my seven bucks worth for the
first time in awhile.
