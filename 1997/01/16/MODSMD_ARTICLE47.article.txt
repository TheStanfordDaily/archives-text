## Brrrr! It's hard to warm to Frosted's generic alterna-rock 
### 
These days it seems every new band out there is sporting
a female lead singer and trying to break into the formerly
male-dominated "alternative" world with their anti-every
thing lyrics.
With "Cold" (Geffen Records), Frosted has come up
with an addition to this ever-growing group, featuring the
Alanis-meets-Victoria-Williams voice of lead vocalist Jane
Wiedlin. Unfortunately, it takes more than just a good voice
to make good music.
At first listen, the band sounds like it could be any one of
the various artists out there, and that is exactly the problem.
Originality is severely lacking with this band, both musical
ly and lyrically.
Too many bands have fallen victim to the three-chord
guitar structure, which doesn't leave a whole lot of room for
creativity, and Frosted is not an exception. Some bands, like
Green Day, have been able to milk this simple musical form
for more than it's worth, but I don't see that happening for
Frosted.
The instrumental melodies and rhythms scream of con
formity to the norm of today's new music mainstream. I he
opening for "Praying" is almost a carbon copy of Better
than Ezra's "Rosealia" intro, and "Hey Girl" features a typi
cal guitar-chords-meet-steady-drumbeat beginning.
Besides the uninteresting guitar and predictable drum
beats, the band also throws in some rather contrived lyrics.
In "Shoulder the Sky," Weidlin proclaims, "You can't run
away from yourself / you can't escape destiny." On the last
track, "Empty and Meaningless," she shouts, "Thank God
life is empty and meaningless," but what's really empty and
meaningless is the album.
Most of the lyrics are a poor attempt at being deep and
introspective, but the only message that the band seems to
convey is, "We're just going to repeat this chorus line an in
sane and inane number of times so we can fill up the space
and have our song go past two minutes." Even the Garbage
like gritty guitar feedback sound effects seem forced and are
definitely overused.
I guess the only good thing about this band is that they
have successfully copied what seems to be working for some
of the more successful bands. Still, to really stick around in
music and avoid the one-hit-wonder syndrome (assuming
they ever get a hit), this group is going to have to come up
with something new and stop copying everyone else.
