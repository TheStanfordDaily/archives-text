# FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE
## Self-titled 
### 
File Fountains Of Wayne under "Guilty
Pleasures" next to Weezer, 311, and The
Cardigans; song for song, their self-titled
first album is the most consistently catchy
CD of 1996. But their simple, streamlined
guitar pop rises above the other aforemen
tioned bands by virtue of their brilliant lyri

cism, a blend of clever rhyme scheme, delib
erately obscure inside-jokery, hopeless-ro
mantic aching and intelligent deadpan wit.
Two guys from New York, Chris Colling
wood and Adam Schlesinger, make up the
core of Fountains Of Wayne. Schlesinger also
plays in the feather-light pop band Ivy and
wrote the title track from the movie "That
Thing You Do!"
Collingwood's past track record is less im
pressive, but he takes center stage here as
Fountains' primary singer. He's got the per
fect pop-star voice, managing to be nerdy
and suave, whiny and sympathetic at the
same time. Both share songwriting duties,
and they keep the hooks as simple and up

front as possible, giving the guitars enough
crunch to play well alongside Stone Temple
Pilots on the radio. But the music is just the
sugar coating that makes the razor-sharp
lyrics go down smoothly.
It's hard to tell if Fountains Of Wayne
treat their song subjects with compassion or
contempt (or both); the lyrics end up telling
just as much about the narrator as it does
about the subject. Collingwood regards the
rude, irresponsible slob of "Joe Rey" with
thinly disguised jealousy as the women flock
to him: "Joe Rey is not so pretty /1 can't un
derstand why he's so in demand."
In "Leave The Biker," he wonders if the
burly guy with the leather jacket and tattoos

"ever has cried because he couldn't get a date
to the prom," and with delicious vindictive
ness, he tries to get his girlfriend to leave
him. But Collingwood is not all petty des
peration, as he empathizes with the de
pressed pop queen of "Barbara H." and gen
tly scolds pottymouths with the wisdom of a
career offender in "You Curse At Girls." The
centerpiece of the album, though, is undeni
ably "Sick Day," a shimmering, acoustic
mini-epic that paints a vivid portrait of dull
corporate office life.
"Radiation Vibe," the first single, is just
the tip of the proverbial iceberg; each song
on the album could be a hit if it were released
as a single. Every now and then, a band
