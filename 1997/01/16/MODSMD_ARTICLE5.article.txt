# Nom Comm fails to place students onto committees
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
The ASSU Nominations Commission,
which appoints student representatives to
University committees, has long had prob
lems communicating the appointment of
students to the appropriate committees.
The recent tempest over a nomination
to the University's Parking and Trans
portation Committee is only the latest ex
ample.
The story began last fall, when doctoral
student Michele Coleman applied for a po
sition on the Parking and Transportation
Committee. Coleman said she had been
told she would be contacted, but she never
was.
She later contacted an ASSU senator
and found out she had been appointed to
the committee, but by the time she was
able to contact the committee directly to
confirm her appointment, Coleman said
administrators had found other student

members to fill the position.
"I think they're just flaky," Coleman
said of the nominations commission. She
has not heard from any member of the
commission since her November inter
view.
"It's quite frustrating for me to have
gone through the whole official process,
only to find out that the committee I want
ed to join had already filled my position by
unofficial means," she wrote in an e-mail
posted to the ASSU newsgroup.
According to Academic Secretary Susan
Schofield, committees that have not had all
their student seats filled are encouraged to
find their own student appointees.
Coleman said she felt she had "wasted a
lot of time, and the commission seems like
they haven't really made much of an effort
to straighten this out or anything."
Similar confusion occurred last fall,
when several University committees were
instructed to select student mem
bers independently of the com
mission's appointments.
ASSU President Bill Shen said
the problem was due to a lack of
clear communication lines.
"What we're dealing with is a
logistical nightmare — there are
over 100 committees operating
out of different offices," he said.
"There's no central conduit
where all the information can
flow through."
Senior Paul Kim, chairman of
the nominations commission, also
said the problem was due to mis
communication.
"This was not due to incompe

tence of the commission but
rather a breakdown of communi
cation lines," he said.
Kim added that in Coleman's
case, the commission had passed
student names on to the Office of
Student Activities, assuming the
information would then reach the
specific committees.
But, ASSU Senator Doug Na
telson noted, "This has happened
several times in the past.
"If you have too many people
involved, everyone thinks some
one else is taking care of these re
sponsibilities," he said.
Natelson said there were simi
lar instances last year in which
students not chosen by the com
mission were appointed to Uni
versity committees.
"There was plenty of finger
pointing within the fCouncil of

Presidents] about whose fault
this was, but basically it was in
ternal communication problems
within the ASSU," he said.
Nanci Howe, director of the Of
fice of Student Activities, said the
University committees are not
supposed to appoint student
members independently of the
ASSU nominations.
"The University has made a re
ally strong commitment to having
a process that actively involves
students," she said. "If there's a
committee chair who is new, they
may not know that."
Howe added, "There are poten
tials for miscommunication in a
number of ways because the Uni
versity is a very decentralized
place."
But Coleman said she wanted a
clearer explanation from the

nominations commission.
"Just saying it was a miscom
munication doesn't quite ring
true," she said. "I don't think it's
just me, I think they're also not
getting in touch with other peo
ple."
Coleman added the staff mem
ber she had spoken with on the
Parking and Transportation
Committee also had not heard
from the commission about stu
dent appointments.
Sophomore Robert Windom
also said he had not been contact
ed about his application to the
Parking and Transportation
Committee, although he was in
formed that he had been appoint
ed to the Alcohol Task Force, to
which he had also applied.
"Any gripe I would have would
not be with . . . the nominations

commission," Windom said. "It
would be with the individual com
mittees for not contacting [stu
dents]."
Windom said he received a
mass e-mail from the nomina
tions commission announcing
student appointments to various
committees and asking for
replies.
"Apparently some people
didn't get the (mass e-mail]," he
said, adding that he noticed Cole
man's name was not on the list.
Shen said the ASSU is fully re
sponsible for making sure com
munication is clear.
"We cannot leave this responsi
bility to anyone outside of the
ASSU," he said. "If there's a screw
up, we're responsible and the stu
dents lose because they don't have
a voice on the committee."
