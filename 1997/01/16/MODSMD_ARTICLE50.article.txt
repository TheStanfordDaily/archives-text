## "Amplexus" 
### 
This latest release from Projekt Records,
"Amplexus: Collected Works from the 1995
Ltd. Series by Vidua Obmana, Thom Bren
nan and Steve Roach," is a beautiful thing.
For all of you nonethereal aficionados out
there, this album will probably sound like
the musical equivalent of a lava lamp: relax
ing, captivating, repetitive and novel.
Each piece on the CD is approximately 20
minutes long and forms a soundscape of its
own. The best way of looking at this album is
as a collection of three mental voyages. If you
listen to the music, it will transport you far
away from everyday life. If you put it on for
its ambiance, it's great to do homework to
and even better to seduce someone with.
All three works on the CD should appeal
to anyone who likes mood music, ambient
techno or scuba diving. It's hard to say any
thing original about any ethereal albums;
most of the music sounds vaguely alike be
cause it is done with synthesizers so dis
cussing technique or vocals is pointless. Suf
fice it to say that "Amplexus" is damned good
and should please both people intimate with
or not already familiar with the medium.
Vidna Obmana's "The Transcending
Quest: Moonstream, The Quest, Authentic
Space," is not as dark as other of their pro
jects, such as "Terrace of Memories." Ob

mana's long-established use of the sounds of
running water, crickets crying and drawn
out harmonized synthesizer successfully cre
ates an enormous space as gorgeous as any
found in the gothic-ethereal category.
Thom Bren nan's "The Path Not Taken
Time" starts out so quietly you can't even
hear it and gradually builds to a wave of
emotion. The length and relative monotony
of the piece is conducive to the regulating of
one's breathing.
Finally Steve Roach's "The Dreamer De
scends: The Dreamer Descends, True West"
ends the CD on a darker and more interior
note, taking the listener slowly inward rather
than pushing toward the sky as the other
pieces are inclined to do. It's an elegant end
ing to a sophisticated CD.
Amplexus is actually an Italian record
label which releases 3-inch CDs in "interest
ing folding jackets." The "Amplexus" compi
lation looks like a typical abstract Projekt
CD, but the quality and effectiveness of the
music within is a true aesthetic triumph.
