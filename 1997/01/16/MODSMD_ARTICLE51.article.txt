# VARIOUS ARTISTS
## "Beavis and Butthead Do America” 
### 
If I could take only 12 songs with me to a
desert island, these would not be the songs.
Marked by energy and diversity, all of the
songs are different, except for their common
electricity.
To take the songs on "Beavis and
Butthead Do America" (Geffen Records) one

at a time: Like the movie, the soundtrack
peaks early with the first song, Isaac Hayes'
ode to Beavis and Butthead, "Two Cool
Guys." A side-splitting throwback to '70s
groove rock, the songs evokes images of
"Charlie's Angels" and"The Love Boat."
The Red Hot Chili Peppers follow up with
"Love Rollercoaster," a fun song with the
usual Peppers how'd-he-do-that bass and
the inane lyrics subverted with the trendy
fuz/.y-AM-sounding vocals.
LL Cool J weighs in next in "Ain't No
body," a platform to use his soothing, flow
ing rap to brag about his sexual prowess.
White Zombie's "Ratfinks, Suicide Tanks
and Cannibal Girls" is a particularly dark
song for them. Like their trademark "Aspro
creme 2000," the song features a repeating
lead riff. Unlike the Zombie you may be used
to, the song also has very industrial Nine
Inch Nails-ish roots from which you may
want to hide the children.
Rancid offers the most unique entry,
which is no small accomplishment on this
compilation. The polka beat in"I Wanna
Riot" is fronted by jazzy brass and saxo
phone solos. Ozzy Osbourne's unmistakable
voice follows on "Walk on Water." Behind
the voice is his typical adrenalized hard-rock
formula.
No Doubt's 1993 song "Snakes" gives a
glimpse of the group before their smash
album "Tragic Kingdom." Although the ska
influence and Gwen Stefani's vocal talents
are evident, the song has more power guitar
and general noise than the usual No Doubt.
Madd Head's "Pimp'n Ain't EZ," includes
a gratuitous amount of violence, profanity
and proclamation of sexual skill. If Madd
Head were as good in the studio as he claims
to be in bed, this song might be worth a lis
ten.

Butthole Surfers are among the innova
tors in the emerging field of alterna-rap, a
genre that features white guys talking about
obscure subjects quasi-rhythmically while
free-wheeling guitar riffs fill in the back
ground. Despite this credential, "The l ord is
a Monkey" is poor, disjointed and purpose
less ... or is that the point?
"White Trash by Southern Culture on
the Skids is a cute song held together b\ a
chorus based on this dialogue:
"White trash."
"Don't call me that."
This is a self-effacing song from some
good ol' boys taking shots at the newly en
vogue ethnic group: rednecks.
AC / DCs "Gone Shootin' " is included as
a tribute to one of Beavis and Butthead's fa
vorite groups. Almost 20 years after its re
lease, "Gone Shootin' " still hits the mark.
In the only song actually incorporated
into the dialogue of the film, "Lesbian Seag
ull" by Engelbert Humperdinck brings this
dysfunctional album to a pacific, lounge
lizard end that would elicit, if ever a song
could, a "This sucks" from anyone with a
mildly critical ear.
Taken as a whole, the soundtrack presents
a snapshot of popular music in themid-'9os:
grunge, rap, industrial, ska, folk and some
retro. If one were putting together a 1996
time capsule, I would be happy to place my
copy of this CD in it for two reasons: so that
posterity might better understand our time
and so that I would not have to listen to it
again.
