Rock 'n' roll was supposed to be dead.
After its massive triumphs in the '60s,
rock had simply become too large for its own
good. Consequently, popular music splin
tered into a multitude of genres (funk, reg
gae, soul, surf, metal, punk, techno, ska, rap,
grunge, etc.), creating a generation of fans

unaware of exactly what "rock 'n' roll"
meant.
However, what most modern "rock"
artists forgot was that rock 'n' roll's greatest
accomplishment was its brilliant synthesis
of seemingly disparate styles of music,
namely black R&B and white country.
An Australian band known as The Cruel
Sea is building a career out of recreating that
synthesis. With an impressive grasp of both
blues and country, the band has formed a
unique style of rock 'n' roll. Essentially, The
Cruel Sea combines swamp- and surf-rock
into a potent mix, suggesting what might
have happened if John Fogerty and Dick
Dale had ever formed a group.
The backbone of the quintet is its breath
taking instrumental work. By creating a
sound which rivals even Booker T. and the
MG's in both complexity and power, the
group's music sounds unlike anything else
being made today.
Still, until the group's latest release, "Three
Legged Dog," (Polydor Records) the group
had suffered from lyrical confusion; the vo
cals could not possibly keep up with the
music. Thus, the group was usually at its best
when covering other artist's songs, such as
with "Blame It On The Moon" from"The

Honeymoon Is Over."
However, with "Three Legged Dog," the
group's lead vocalist / lyricist Tex Perkins
has finally found something to say. From the
sly country grandeur of "Anybody But You"
to the itchy folk-blues of "Too Fast For Me,"
Perkins' vocals add a depth to the music
which had previously been missing.
Indeed, as a whole, the group's songwrit
ing has taken a significant step forward with
this latest album. While the music itself is as
intoxicating as ever, each song clearly pre
sents a singular vision.
The bass-driven funk of "Just A Man," the
Stones-derived riffs of "Teach Me" and the
organic pulse of "The Lot" are all perfect
artistic triumphs, merging inspiration and
technique.
Unfortunately, Polydor appears doubtful
about the group's potential in the United
States. Although "The Honeymoon Is Over"
earned an American release, "Three Legged
Dog" is currently still unavailable.
Even after receiving an Aria (an Aus
tralian Grammy) for best group, The Cruel
Sea is still virtually unknown in the United
States. I acquired my copy of "Three Legged
Dog" through a friend, who journeyed to
Australia. Obtain your own copy by whatev
er means necessary.
Rock 'n' roll was never supposed to be
this good.
