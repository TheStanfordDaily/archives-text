## First-Class Ride 'Travels with My Aunt' a perfect mix of comedy and seriousness 
### 
As the curtain rises on a dreamy blue
green landscape of surreal proportions, four
men sit like replicated images of each other at
four separate tables. Each has pale skin and
wears a gray suit with a brick red vest and tie
of the same color. Little do we know that
these four men will transform themselves
into more than 20 characters, including a 75-
year-old woman and a teen-age flower child,
with only a single slight costume change at
the end of the show.
The American Conservatory Theater pre
sents Giles Havergal's remarkable stage adap
tation of "Travels with My Aunt," Graham
Greene's 1969 novel of the same name.
Havergal adapted Greene's novel in 1989,
and since its first performance the show has
earned awards in New York and London
under his direction.
The minimalism of Havergal's style in the
costumes and sets (which change very little
until the end) lends itself perfectly to the
floating feeling that inhabits Greene's rich
and hilarious tale of youth, adventure, nos

talgia and aging. Written when Greene was
65, "Travels" began as "a sad book about
death that turned out to be funny," wrote
Greene.
The story begins just after the mother of
the main character has died. A retired bank
manager of 30 years, Henry Pulling lives alone
and cultivates his prized dahlias in the back
yard. Henry's uneventful existence changes at
his mother's funeral, where he meets — for
only the second time in his life — the irrever
ent 75-year-old Aunt Augusta, who greets
him casually with the tidbit that the woman
who has just died was not his real mother.
Aunt Augusta invites Henry to her flat for
tea, and he becomes entangled in her myste
rious and exciting life after a comedic mix-up
with his "mother's" funeral urn implicates
him in Aunt Augusta's shady criminal life.
What ensues is a series of trips to Italy, Turkey
and Argentina. Henry and Aunt Augusta fi
nally end up in Paraguay, living in a mansion
with Mr. Visconti, Augusta's Italian lover
who also happens to be an art smuggler.

Aunt Augusta, who is propelled by the
"deep, incurable egotism of passion," brings
Henry into a swirling world of fast living and
easy loving. While at first Henry is critical of
her and apprehensive to spend time with her,
by the end of the play he accepts her offer of
risk and intrigue and stays in Paraguay in
stead of returning to England.
"I would have certainly called her shady
myself nine months ago," Henry says,"and
yet there seems nothing wrong in her cur
riculum vitae, nothing so wrong as 30 years
in a bank."
"Travels" is successful in creating endear
ing and ultimately lovable portraits of both
Henry and Aunt Augusta, as well as comedic
and enjoyable supporting characters. The
quartet of Ken Ruta, Charles Dean, Geoff
Hoyle and Bryan Close are brilliant in their
various roles. Especially entertaining are
Hoyle's portrait of Aunt Augusta's African
lover, Wordsworth, and Ruta's playfully
femme Aunt Augusta. Close steals the biggest
laugh, though, in the absurdly funny role of

an overfriendly wolfhound.
While the slapstick at the beginning of
"Travels" is heavy-handed, the progression of
the show is a perfect mix of comedy and high
seriousness, as both Henry and Augusta envi
sion and map out their mortality and their
pasts as they map out the itinerary of their
travels.
