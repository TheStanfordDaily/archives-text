# CORROSION OF CONFORMITY
## "Wiseblood" 
### 
Corrosion of Conformity has been work
ing hard to keep the old-fashioned metal
scene alive for the past few years. The torch
of crunch-guitar rock, long since dropped
by Metallica, has been carried by groups
such as Corrosion and Pantera. Unfortu
nately, it's going to take more originality
than "Wiseblood" (Columbia Records) to
keep the fire burning.
The foremost problem that plagues
"Wiseblood" is a macho beer-bash attitude
that stinks up the artistic content of the
album. Corrosion proves itself to be major
label nobodies that play well together but
can't quite make it to the top.
What the album does do well is sustain
hard rock intensity throughout. "Wise
blood" is a good album to listen to in your
Jeep doing 75 mph down 80 East. Addi
tionally, the group is in sync — the album is
well-produced by John Custer. And rhythm
is excellent.
The guitars screech and the drums are
thumped, but it doesn't come across as

convincing. Corrosion vocalist Pepper
Keenan, a follower in the footsteps of Mike
Patton and James Hetfield, sounds more
like a garage rock star wanna-be at an audi
tion than someone who sincerely means
what he's singing about. Keenan's tough -
guy attitude makes him look self-conscious
about his mediocre talents.
Of the songs, "Long Whip / Big Ameri
ca" is predictable enough to be played on
the radio but not durable enough to survive
the test of time, like all of Corrosion's music
on this release. "Goodbye Windows" is one
of the highlights of "Wiseblood," progress
ing into a high intensity, quality song.
The next track, "Born Again For The
Last Time" is kept afloat by a great bass line,
but not much else. Bassist Mike Dean is un
deremphasized in the album; his contribu
tions to the group should be magnified in
the songs. Far too often, he gets buried
under Keenan's drab guitar riffs.
"The Snake Has No Head" is the best of
the album, maintaining a '70s groove while
incorporating psychedelic sounds and
blood-curdling Keenan screams. Overall, a
good portion of "Wiseblood" is harmless
fun. Unfortunately, Keenan tries too hard
to make the band something it isn't: an ex
cellent metal band. This leaves Corrosion
open to the criticism shouldered by an ex
cellent band, under which it crumbles.
