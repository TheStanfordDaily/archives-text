# New Jewish student magazine will serve as community forum
## 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
"Haver," which means friend in He
brew, is the title of a new magazine dedi
cated to issues in Stanford's Jewish com
munity.
The name, though, is not altogether
new. Haver has existed for nine years as
an annual alumni publication of the Hil
lel Foundation, Stanford's nonprofit
Jewish student organization. Its goal has
been to keep the University's Jewish
alumni informed about events on the
Farm, as well as to solicit donations.
But the magazine promises to take a
new direction as a student-run monthly
in the hands of junior Stephanie Green
and sophomore Shoshana Deutschkron.
Its new goal is to serve as a forum for the
community to discuss news and issues af
fecting Jews and Jewish students.
"Usually a very strong part of the Jew
ish community is sharing ideas," said
Deutschkron, Haver's editor. She and
Green decided independently that the
absence of a Jewish publication on the
Stanford campus was a void that needed
to be filled, and they have worked togeth
er to get the magazine off the ground.
The first edition of Haver is due out in
mid-February and will contain a mixture
of poetry, literature, art and photogra

phy, as well as news. It will be mailed di
rectly to the 1,200 students on Hillel's
mailing list, and copies also will be dis
tributed to every dorm in order to reach
beyond the Jewish community.
"Part of the vision is to draw people in
from the Jewish community who
wouldn't otherwise be involved," said
Green, the magazine's publisher.
"It will also be instrumental in im
proving the image of Jews on campus,"
she said. "Lots of people consider Ju
daism as a religion rather than a cul
ture."
According to Green, Stanford has a
relatively small Jewish student popula
tion, which deters some prospective stu
dents from enrolling. Hillel was not al
lowed on campus until the mid-19605,
she said.
Although it's small, Stanford's Jewish
community is vibrant, Green said, large
ly due to the charismatic leadership of
Rabbi Ari Cartun, who left Stanford last
summer after 21 years at Hillel.
Jewish undergraduates now make up
about 10 percent of the Stanford popula
tion, while the number of Jewish gradu
ate students is closer to 20 percent, ac
cording to Hillel Interim Director Debo
rah Sloss-Kelman.
In comparison, Ivy League universi
ties generally have a Jewish student pop

ulation of around 30 percent, Green said.
But contributing to Haver is not limit
ed to Jewish students; the only require
ment for articles is that they address is
sues of concern to Jewish students.

"There are a lot of things relevant to
the Jewish community," said
Deutschkron. "It doesn't have to be in
the Jewish voice."
By the same token, Haver won't be ac

cepting articles from writers just because
they are Jewish, Deutschkron added.
"It's a magazine that's meant to enrich
the Jewish community, and the content
should be relevant," she said.
Although the magazine will appear
under the auspices of Hillel, which is pro
viding Haver with a computer and office
space, the foundation has not given any
funding. Green has been busy during the
last few months securing sponsors and
advertisers.
"The response from Jewish organiza
tions has been very strong," she said, "al
though we haven't received dollar
amounts."
The alumni edition of Haver will con
tinue to be funded by Hillel and will come
out as usual in the spring quarter under
Deutschkron's editorship.
"There will always be an alumni edi
tion of Haver because [Hillel] needs it to
bring in money," said Green. "But the vi
sion of Haver will change as it becomes
student-run. I think it underestimates
what alumni want to hear from stu
dents."
Alumni "don't just want to know who
got married and who's had a kid," agreed
Deutschkron. "They want candid re
ports."
