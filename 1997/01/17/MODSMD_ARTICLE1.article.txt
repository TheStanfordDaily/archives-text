# Bell explains reasons for racism
## Visiting NYU prof discusses power of protest 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
According to Prof. Derrick
Bell, the power of protest goes be
yond winning or losing.
Bell, a visiting law professor at
New York University and former
visiting law professor at Stan
ford, came to campus in honor of
Martin Luther King Jr. Day and
spoke with a group of about 20
students, alumni and staff in an
open forum yesterday in Tresid
der Union. Bell also spoke
Wednesday night in Kresge Audi
torium.
"To lose a case doesn't mean
the end," Bell said. "In fact it can
energize the way victory
doesn't."
After serving as Harvard Law
School's first black tenured pro
fessor for 18 years, Bell was dis
missed when he refused to end a
two-year leave taken to protest
the school's failure to hire and
grant tenure to women of color on
the faculty.
"The power of protest,
whether you win or not, is a mar
velous feeling," Bell said. "To be a
part of the Million Man March is
an unforgettable experience. To
be a part of a group that walks out
of the commencement ... to
manifest in a fair and peaceful
way your disagreement . . .
should be a part of your life."
Bell said it is a "rare individual
who on his or her own is able to
rise up and stand up while every
body else is remaining seated."
In response to a question
about the reason for racism, Bell
said it began from an identifica
tion of whiteness that reached
"across great chasms of class and
wealth and opportunity ... and
made it possible Ifor whites] to
identify themselves [against]
blacks or other classes who are

deemed on the bottom."
Segregation began with a "be
lief that [white people) were,
whatever their economic posi
tion, better than blacks," he said.
"What racism is ... is a struc
ture that provides stability," Bell
said. "If black people were all
taken away, the structure would
fall apart because being white
wouldn't mean anything.
"The reason I suggest that
racism is permanent is not be
cause I think all white people are
evil," he said. Bell explained that
he feels racism has a long and per
petuating heritage. For 300 years
American society has accepted
the idefa that being white makes a

person better, regardless of eco
nomic status, he said.
Bell was critical of the argu
ments used by opponents of affir
mative action.
"I am a proud product of affir
mative action," without which
Bell said he would not have been
admitted to Harvard Law School.
"It's so interesting that you al
most never hear merit mentioned
except in the context of which
black folks are qualified," Bell
said.
"The fact that there is no chal
lenge to the legacy admit policy at
all is a contradiction by those who
oppose affirmative action who
[claim] a commitment to merit,"

he said. The-legacy admit policy,
Bell said, measures the economic
background of parents rather
than academic merit.
When asked what he felt about
censorship of racially derogatory
themes in books, Bell explained
why he was against it.
"My view on censorship is that
it's not worth it,"he said. "The ef
fort to censor publicizes that
which you want to censor more
than it would be heard if it wasn't
censored. It gives it an impor
tance that it might not have."
Bell criticized Stanford's fail
ure to keep more professors of

color on its faculty.
"At the Stanford Law School,
if they had kept a half or a third of
the folk who came here as visi
tors, it would be a better school,"
he said.
"Somebody should do an article
on all the black people who were
here, and why they were not able
to stay," he said.
