## Bombs rock Atlanta abortion clinic Six injured in 'vile and malevolent act' 
### 
ATLANTA (AP) - Two bomb
blasts an hour apart rocked a
building containing an abortion
clinic yesterday, injuring six peo
ple who had rushed to the scene of
the first explosion, including fed
eral agents, rescue workers and a
TV cameraman.
"The second explosion is clear
ly designed to maim and hurt
those who were coming to assist,"
said Mayor Bill Campbell. "So
we're dealing with a warped mind
here."
The explosions left the Atlanta
Northside Family Planning Ser
vices clinic in ruins and blew out
windows across the street. Police
immediately tightened security at
all other clinics in the city.
President Clinton condemned
the explosions as "a vile and
malevolent act."
"Make no mistake: Anyone
who brings violence against a
woman trying to exercise her con
stitutional rights is committing
an act of terror," he said.
The first bomb went off at 9:30
a.m. near the clinic on the ground
floor of a five-story office building
that also houses lawyers, dentists
and other professionals. The sec
ond bomb went off near a trash
bin in the parking lot.
A crowd of investigators,
police, journalists and bystanders
who had gathered outside after
the first explosion heard a loud
boom and felt the concussion.
They could see a bright flash and
debris flying in the air.
"It was scary as hell," said clin
ic counselor Geralyn Thompson,
who arrived just after the first
blast. "I probably will never work
at an abortion clinic again in
Atlanta."
All of the injuries appeared to
be minor. An Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms agent was seen

bleeding from the head and hands
as he was carried to an ambu
lance. The other injured included
two FBI agents, a firefighter, an
ambulance worker and a televi
sion cameraman.
In Washington, Asst. Attorney
General Deval Patrick said there
was no immediate claim of
responsibility and that investiga
tors were checking with law
enforcement agencies to see if any
warning was received.
A federal law enforcement offi
cial, demanding anonymity,
warned investigators not to get
"locked in on the clinic."
"We're not saying for sure that
it was aimed at the clinic. We're
being very careful because we
have no evidence on the motiva
tion," the official said, noting that
there are other businesses in the
building.
Employees of the Atlanta
Northside clinic said it does not
see patients every day and none
were expected yesterday. The
blast apparently took place at the
back of the clinic, away from the
only two employees there at the
time.
The attacks came five days
before the 24th anniversary of
Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme
Court decision that legalized abor
tion. Patrick said the government
has for several years sent alerts to
state and local law enforcement
agencies around the anniversary
to watch for violence. But it was
not immediately known if this
year's alert had gone out yet.
Police evacuated other build
ings in the area after the second
explosion and closed down nearby
ramps to Interstate 285, which
circles the city.
Campbell dispatched extra
police officers to ail abortion clin
ics in the city as a precaution. A

nearby clinic was briefly evacuat
ed after the second blast, but all
said they would remain open.
U.S. Attorney Kent Alexander
said investigators were combing

the area to make sure there
wasn't a third bomb. "There's no
reason to think there is, but there
was no reason to think there was
a second device," he said.
