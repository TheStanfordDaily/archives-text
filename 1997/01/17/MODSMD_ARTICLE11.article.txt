# Yeltsin impeachment attempt dropped

### 
MOSCOW (AP) — Russian par
liamentary leaders dropped their
attempt to impeach Boris Yeltsin
over his ill health yesterday, and
the Kremlin said the hospitalized
president's condition is improving.
The Communist lawmaker
behind the long-shot ouster
attempt pledged to push ahead
with it on his own next week.
Yeltsin had been sidelined since
last summer with heart trouble
and has been in the Kremlin hospi
tal with pneumonia since Jan. 8.
His hard-line foes in parliament
have called for his removal, even
though the administration insists
the president is expected to return
to full health.
A day after legal advisers told

parliamentary deputies they had
no constitutional right to remove
the president, the speaker of the
lower house said the motion would
not be raised for debate — for now.
"We must heed our legal sec
tion's advice and take the issue off
the agenda," Duma speaker Gen
nady Seleznyov, a Communist, told
reporters.
Viktor Ilyukhin, who raised the
impeachment proposal, dropped
his demand that the Duma debate
the issue today, citing requests by
several factions for more time to
study it.
But he told the Interfax news
agency he would raise it again next
week.
Presidential aides say the talk of

impeaching the ailing Russian
leader is a groundless attempt to
stir up controversy.
Last evening, the Kremlin said
Yeltsin's condition had "noticeably
stabilized," citing doctors treating
the Russian president at the Cen
tral Clinical Hospital.
X-rays have shown a "positive
trend" in his recovery, a statement
from the presidential press service
said. Yeltsin's blood pressure and
temperature were normal.
The president spent two hours
yesterday doing paperwork at the
hospital, including drafting his
annual address before the upper
house of parliament next month,
the Kremlin said.
Doctors say Yeltsin will stay in

the hospital until at least next
week to avoid possible heart prob
lems and other complications of
pneumonia.
Yeltsin's wife, Naina, was
released yesterday from the same
hospital, where she had been treat
ed for bronchitis, the statement
said.
Yeltsin had been back at work in
the Kremlin for only two weeks fol
lowing heart surgeiy in November
when he had to be hospitalized
again.
A planned meeting next month
in The Hague, Netherlands, with
European leaders is shaping up as
a key test of claims that his health
is improving and he can stay in
office.
