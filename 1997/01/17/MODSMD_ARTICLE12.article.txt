KINGSVILLE, Texas (AP) - In
this friendly little ranching town,
"Hello" is wearing out its welcome.
And Leonso Canales Jr. is happy
as heck.
At his urging, the Kleberg
County commissioners on Monday
unanimously designated "Heaven
o" as the county's official greeting.
The reason: "Hello" contains
the word "Hell."

"When you go to school and
church, they tell you 'hell' is nega
tive and 'heaven' is positive," said
the 56-year-old Canales, who owns
the Kingsville Flea Market. "I
think it's time that we set a new
precedent, to tell our kids that we
are positive adults."
The new salutation, according
to the county resolution, is a "sym
bol of peace, friendship and wel

come" in this "age of anxiety."
Yesterday, courthouse employ
ees were answering the phones,
"Heaven-o." And the chamber of
commerce was working on a cam
paign promoting Kingsville, a Rio
Grande Valley town of 25,000, as a
"heavenly" place to visit.
Not everyone is a convert to Kle
berg County's heavenly ways.
Madolyn Musick, who runs a

bookstore, insisted that "hello" has
nothing to do with "hell." Besides,
she added, "What's wrong with,
'Howdv, y'all?' "
Canales, a Catho' but not a
regular churchgoer, as been as
serious as heck aboi "hello" since
1988, when he tol( lis brother he
might start greeting people with
"God-o." His brother suggested
"Heaven-o" instead.
