# Israel packs up Hebron forces
## Palestinians rejoice over withdrawal

HEBRON, West Bank (AP) —
Emptying sandbags, cutting down
barbed wire and loading trucks
with furniture, Israeli troops dis
mantled their headquarters yes
terday to leave Hebron. As the
army packed, hundreds of Pales
tinians sang and danced.
Israel's parliament approved
the withdrawal by an 87-17 vote
late yesterday, after an all-day
debate in which Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu faced attack
from members of his own Likud
Party. They felt betrayed by his
acquiescence to a peace process he
long opposed.
The withdrawal — worked out
in months of tortuous negotiations
between Israel and the Palestini
ans — is the first tangible act by
Netanyahu's government toward
making peace with the Palestini
ans.
In Hebron, evidence was every
where that 30 years of military
rule was beginning to end. A small
group of uniformed Palestinian
police walked armed through the
city's streets for the first time. An
Israeli army outpost lowered the
blue-and-white Israeli flag.
Netanyahu said the Hebron
redeployment should be completed
before the Jewish Sabbath begins
Friday night. "We will not permit
desecration of the Sabbath," he

said. "If there is a problem, we will
stop."
Besides the Hebron withdraw
al, the agreement calls for Israel to
hand over a large part of the West
Bank countryside to the Palestini
ans by mid-1998. The three-stage
withdrawal from the rural areas is
to begin the first week of March.
Netanyahu emphasized that
Israeli troops will remain in the
parts of Hebron where 500 Jewish
settlers live.
"We are not leaving Hebron, we
are redeploying in part of it,"he
said. "We are remaining in all the
parts of the city where the Jewish
community existed and exists and
will continue to exist. ... There
will not be Palestinian police with
guns near the Jewish areas."
Outside the Israeli military
headquarters — soon to be the
main Palestinian police station —
Palestinians waved keffiyehs, or
head scarves, and sang "Biladi,
Biladi" — "My Country, My Coun
try."
The crowd cheered and flashed
victory signs every time an Israeli
truck pulled away, and some tried
to tear down the barbed-wire fence
surrounding the compound.
"We welcome Arafat," said 12-
year-old Samer Karama. "God
bless him. His coming is an end of
the occupation."
