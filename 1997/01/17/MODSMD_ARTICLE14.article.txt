LOS ANGELES (AP) - Bill
Cosby's only son was shot to death
early yesterday in a possible rob
bery attempt while changing a flat
tire along a freeway.
The body of Ennis William
Cosby, 27, was found by a passer
by about 1:45 a.m. in a pool of
blood next to the car.
No immediate arrests were
made.
The Columbia University grad
uate student was the son of the one
of the world's richest entertainers,
a man for whom fatherhood was
the wellspring of his stand-up com
edy, a best-selling book and the
most popular TV series of the '80s.
Before ducking into his home in
New York City, the 59-vear-old
Cosby, looking grim and puffy
eyed, told reporters: "He was my
hero."
The younger Cosby's Mercedes
convertible was found in a well-to
do area near the crest of the Santa
Monica Mountains not far from
the exclusive Bel-Air section of Los
Angeles.
Police Cmdr. Tim Mcßride said:
"It is unknown whether he was
followed at this time or not. I think
that's a good probability. But it
may have been a chance opportu
nity that somebody took, robbery
being a possible motive."
However, nothing apparently
was taken, he said.
The star of CBS' "Cosby" was
in New York, where the show is
produced, when Mcßride broke
the news. The police commander
said he and Cosby spoke for about
20 minutes on the difficulty of cop
ing with the death of a child.
Mcßride lost a 16-year-old daugh

ter in a hit-and-run.
Cosby and his wife, Camille,
also have four daughters — two
younger than Ennis, two older —
whose names, like their brother,
all begin with E: Erika, Erinn,
Ensa and Evin. Their father said
the E stood for excellence.
Said Cosby in a statement: "We
have every confidence in the
LAPD. Our hearts go out to each
and every family that such an inci
dent occurs to. This is a life experi
ence that is truly difficult to
share."
Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who
played Cosby's son Theo Huxtable
on "The Cosby Show" on NBC,
said: "He was my friend and I
loved him."
Ennis Cosby's neighbors on
Manhattan's East Side, 10 blocks
from where his parents live,
remembered him fondly.
"He was veiy down to earth,"
said deli owner Ali Shahid. "I'd see
him and his sister come here to
buy newspapers,"
The younger Cosby graduated
m 1992 from Morehouse College in
Atlanta and was working toward
his doctorate in special education.
He had overcome dyslexia, a learn
ing disability.
"He was the kind of student
whom we would be proud of even if
his name was not Cosby," said
Arthur lx-vine, president of Teach
ers College at Columbia where
Cosby had earned a master's
degree in 1995.
One of Cosby's advisers at
Teachers College. Margaret Jo
Shepherd, said his dream was to
establish a private school for stu
dents with learning disabilities.
