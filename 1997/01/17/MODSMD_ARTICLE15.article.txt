Snows blanket Midwest
(AP) — Enough already!
With winter not even a month old, storm after
storm has pummeled the Midwest, piling snow into
towering drifts, trapping drivers in their cars and
couples in their homes and leaving cattle to starve
or freeze to death.
People are sick and tired of it — and it's only mid-
January.
"I'm in denial," said Sue Davis, owner of Mike's
Cafe in downtown Marshall, a southwest Minneso
ta city that has weathered eight big storms since
November. "I don't want to think about it, and I
don't want to talk about it."
President Clinton declared a major disaster yes
terday in nearly half of the counties in Minnesota,
where local snow removal budgets are busted and
the legislature is considering a $20 million emer
gency appropriation.
"It was way beyond what anybody could have
budgeted for, and that's why Minnesota had to say,
'We need some help,' " said U.S. Sen. Paul Well
stone, D-Minn.
Little fresh snow fell yesterday afternoon, but
winds gusted to 40 mph, blowing around existing
piles.
Still, there was hope.
"You can see!" Kim Kinev said at the Coffee Cup
Fuel Stop in Steele, N.D. The shop was surrounded

by piles of snow plowed from the parking lot. "But it
looks much better today," she said.
49ers name new coach
SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Steve Mariucci,
with only a year's experience as a college head
coach, inherited one of the great pro football lega
cies of success yesterday when he was introduced as
coach of the San Francisco 49ers.
Standing on a podium between his predecessors,
George Seifert and Bill Walsh, Mariucci was admit
tedly overwhelmed to be in their presence.
"I am in awe of those two coaches. I'm happy
they're here," he said as the trio posed for pictures.
"I understand what I'm getting into," said the
41-year-old coach, who led California to a 6-6 record
this season in his only assignment as head coach.
"This has been the most successful franchise in pro
fessional football over the last 15 years. I under
stand that I have huge shoes to fill."
Mariucci is just the third coach for the 49ers in
18 years, taking over for Seifert, who resigned
Wednesday after leading the team to two Super
Bowl titles and surpassing Walsh as San Francisco's
winningest coach.
He is also the first person from outside the 49ers'
organization to be selected for the job since Walsh
arrived in 1979 and installed his pioneering West
Coast offense.
