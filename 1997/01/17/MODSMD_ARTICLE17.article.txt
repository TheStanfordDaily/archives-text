Bramzon and SMOC
get results in quest
against Bookstore

There probably isn't a
Stanford student who hasn't
winced after seeing their
quarterly bill from the Bookstore.
"Two hundred dollars — for
three books?" a senior exclaimed
earlier this month. "Gosh, these
CIV books sure are expensive," a
still-innocent freshman mused.
And then there's junior Danny
Bramzon and his quest for an elec
tric pencil sharpener. The Book
store sold the desired sharpener for
$34.95; in comparison, the same
model cost $17.95 at Costco.
For Bramzon, this was the straw
that broke the camel's back. He
decided to take action.
The result?
Stop Monopolies on Campus, a
new student group dedicated to
fighting what members perceive as
overpricing at the Bookstore and
other Bookstore-owned companies,
including Tresidder Express and
the Track House.
Recently, group members put
together a used-book list, matching
potential buyers with student sell
ers. The list started out as an e-mail
list of 300 titles and within days
grew into a Web site with more than
1,500 titles. According to Bramzon,
about 1,000 students submitted
titles to the site.
SMOC members chose a unique
way to promote the new list — they
set up shop in front of the Book
store. Bramzon hauled out his
megaphone and strongly urged
passers-by to stop at the SMOC
table and sign up for the used-book
list.
Granted Bramzon and his mega
phone are annoying, but that
doesn't mean SMOC doesn't have a
good point. Everyone agrees that
the Bookstore is too expensive —
and while there are some valid rea
sons behind the store's high costs —
it's admirable that these students

are motivated enough to do some
thing more than whine about the
situation. So their cause isn't earth
shattering — it's not like they're
fighting for an end to world hunger
— but at least these students care
about something.
And it seems their efforts have
already paid off. Earlier this week
SMOC members met with Book
store CEO Peggy Mendelson and
other top officials. In addition to
trying to ensure that a student
serves on the Bookstore's Board of
Directors next year, the store's
brass agreed to look into moderat
ing price differences between identi
cal books sold in the lower level's
textbook section and also upstairs
as part of the general collection.
Because of bulk purchasing, the
textbooks often cost more.
But perhaps most importantly,
the officials agreed to let SMOC
organizers host a book-exchange
table on the store's steps at the start
of each quarter; one member said
the agreement represents a kind of
"blessing" from the store, and he's
entirely right.
The Bookstore is not obligated to
support the used-book exchange —
in fact, the exchange likely means
hundreds, if not thousands, of dol
lars in losses for the store — and the
store's leaders should be praised for
helping out the movement. Giving
students options is always a good
thing.
While SMOC should be com
mended for its efforts to date, more
still needs to be done. Specifically,
the group needs to continue to pro
mote its book exchange, and the
ASSU should lend its support to
this effort. Many students have
benefited from it this quarter, and it
would be a tragedy if it died out next
quarter from lack of organization.
Also, SMOC would greatly help its
cause by preparing a written report
detailing specific complaints with
the Bookstore. This report should
include research about other uni
versities' bookstores — how have
other schools attempted to keep
prices down? After all, maybe we
can learn from them.
