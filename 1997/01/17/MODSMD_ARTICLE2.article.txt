# Alumni blast C-15 judicial charter outline
## 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Proposed revisions to the Leg
islative and Judicial Charter are
"pernicious" and "rights-annihilat
ing," according to Students Have
Rights, an unofficial group of Stan
ford alumni bent on seeing the new
document protect student liberties.
Yet most of the group's argu
ments concerning the plan to re
vamp the University's judicial sys
tem are completely false, said Geo
physics Prof. Mark Zoback, chair of
the Committee of 15, the group of
students, faculty and staff charged
with revising the document last
spring.
The charter outlines the proce
dures under which students are
prosecuted for violations of the
Honor Code and the Fundamental
Standard, the general agreement to
be good citizens that all students
make.
Members of Students Have
Rights contend that, under the new
charter, students would be denied
basic liberties if charged with break
ing University policy.
Yale Braunstein, a spokesman
for the group and Stanford alum
nus, said accused students would be
denied the rights of cross-examin
ing their accusers, being tried in
front of a jury of their peers and
being able to be represented by
counsel. He added that students
would not be able to have their
charges dropped without the ac
cuser's approval.
"All of these things are unheard
of in American jurisprudence," said
Braunstein, an information sys
tems professor at UC-Berkeley.
However, Zoback said he did not
understand how the group could
make these claims as the commit
tee's final revisions have yet to be
made.
In addition, Zoback, infuriated

with what he called the group's
"paranoid rantings," said his com
mittee has striven for nine months
to ensure that the charter guaran
tees as many rights to students as
possible.
According to Zoback, students
will have the right of representa
tion, either through counsel which
they hire themselves or through
volunteer administrators made
available to aid them.
He added that students will be
able to confront their accusers if
they so choose, and the judicial
panel — the group of students and

faculty appointed
to determine the
student's guilt or
innocence — will
be allowed to drop
charges against
the student if no
evidence exists to
continue with the
prosecution.
Bill Evers, a

Hoover Institution research fellow
and member of Student Have
Rights, said he hopes to meet with
Zoback soon to make sure "that
they understand our concerns and
we understand theirs."
Evers acknowledged that the
document is always evolving and
that his group could have been
wrong in some of their judgments
in light of recent changes to the
charter.
"As an alumnus who is some
what removed from the University,
I have the right to make mistakes,"
Evers said.
Nevertheless, Evers said some of
his group's arguments are still
valid. He argues that the judicial
panel is not a jury of the students'
peers as faculty may be included in
the panel.
Zobaek-agreed that the decision


Zoback
to have a jury composed of both
students and faculty is not final
and certainly open to contention.
Student Have Rights has a "le
gitimate point with the juries,"
Zoback said. "They are 100 percent
right in arguing with us on this
point. We don't know right now if
we have the optimal system. It's not
a black-and-white issue."
ASSU President Bill Shen said
he supports the charter's revision
to include faculty on the judicial

panels, as a violation of the Honor
Code or Fundamental Standard af
fects all members of the Stanford
community.
In addition, Braunstein said
his organization's members
feared that the proposal to lower
the burden of proof, the standard
of guilt needed to convict a stu
dent, would have been disastrous
if approved.
Fortunately, Braunstein said,
the ASSU Senate voted Tuesday to
uphold the current burden of proof
as "beyond a reasonable doubt."
Students Have Rights was found
ed in 1991 to fight a similar proposal
to lower the burden of proof to "clear

and convincing evidence."
The members of the organiza
tion, which is described as having
a range of political views and oc
cupations, came together again
this past year to ensure students'
rights were being protected. A
site on the World Wide Web
(http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/ri
ghts) was set up to voice their
concerns about the charter.
According to Zoback, the final
draft of the charter should be ready
in about five weeks, after which it
will be submitted to the student
population, then the Faculty Sen
ate and University President Ger
hard Casper for approval.
