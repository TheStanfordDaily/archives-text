## Co-ops vs. dorms: a primer 
### 
CO-OPS ARE A mystery to most of
Stanford. Some undergraduates are
even afraid of them. Just yesterday
I told a frosh that I lived in Terra. "It's a
co-op," I said. She gave me a frightened
look and backed away, as if I had asked her
out on a date.
Co-ops have weird names like Kairos
and Synergy and dot the edges of campus
like the compounds of some subversive
cult. EBF is out in BFE. Terra is located in
"Cowell Cluster," and no one knows where
"Cowell Cluster" is. Most think that "Cow
ell Cluster" is a strain of herpes you get
from toilet seats in the Cowell Student
Health Center.
Perhaps the obscure status of campus
co-ops is a result of the University's secret
plan to homogenize and pasteurize hous
ing until all residences — frats, co-ops and
self-ops alike — are just like Lantaria.
Another reason for the low profile of co-ops
is that the people who live there are gener
ally very content and enjoy their home as it
is. In this way, co-operators are like people
who live in Seattle.
Co-ops offer something different and, in
many ways, better than more conventional
houses on campus. Rather than listing rea
sons, I offer the following list of differences
that I have observed between dormitories
and co-ops. Hopefully, the co-op spirit will
emerge, and you will see for yourself why
co-op life is the best kind of Stanford life:
Intra-house bonding
Dorm: Occasionally, I have eye contact
with the girl across the hall on my way to
the bathroom.

Co-op: Occasionally, the girl across the hall
borrows my loofah while we shower in the
coed bathroom.
Hygiene
Dorm: Once I puked on the floor and felt
bad because the custodian had to clean it
up with his hands.
Co-op: Once I puked on the floor and felt
bad because my neighbors cleaned it up,
using my head as a mop.
Resident fellows
Dorm: George, our RF, is pretty old. He
remembers Woodstock very well, but he
wasn't there.
Co-op: Dweezil, our eating associate, is
pretty old. He doesn't remember Wood
stock very well, but he was there.
Coed layout
Dorm: The boys live on the second floor.
My roommate swears she saw one yester
day.
Co-op: My roommate is a boy.
In-house social functions
Dorm: There's always "Screw Your Room
mate."
Co-op: See above. No, it doesn't happen.
Neat activities
Dorm: At "Crossing the Line," Jerry
stepped forward and admitted to cheating
on the SAT.
Co-op: Most of co-op life occurs on the
other side of the aforementioned "line."
Food
Dorm: Weeds in the salad.
Co-op: No weeds in the salad. No weed,
either.
Alcohol policy
Dorm: We have a cool resident assistant —

she lets us drink beer if we stay in our
rooms.
Co-op: I enjoy drinking with my RAin the
lounge. My parents told me that people
who drink in their rooms will surely
become alcoholics.
Dorm politics
Dorm: Residents rejoice at the passage of
Prop. 215, pleased that glaucoma sufferers
can now legally receive marijuana.
Co-op: Resident bioengineering majors
devise procedure to self-induce glaucoma.
Inter-house dating
Dorm: A friend asks about a girl in the
house. I don't know her well, so I tell him
she is "quick at the bike rack."
Co-op: A friend asks about a girl in the
house. I know her well enough to tell him
she is "neat in the bathroom."
Parties
Dorm: We hear about all the frat parties
and go to them in groups of 200.
Co-op: Ancient co-op adage: Frosh is to frat
party as lemming is to cliff.
Residential education
Dorm: Once last quarter, my neighbor and
I attended a presentation in the lounge
about the Rhodes scholarship.
Co-op: Once a quarter, my neighbor and I
clean the lounge. She is a Rhodes scholar.
