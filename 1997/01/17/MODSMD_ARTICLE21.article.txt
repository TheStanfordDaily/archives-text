Med School prof explains his side in VA dispute

The article titled
"Response filed in Med School
case" (Wednesday's front page)
does not present the complete and true
facts about the academic environment at
the Veterans Administration Palo Alto
Health Care System nor my role as asso
ciate dean for veterans affairs at the
VAPAHCS.
The affiliation between the School of
Medicine and the VAPAHCS was estab
lished more than 30 years ago. The goal of
the affiliation has been, and still is, to pro
vide the best possible care to veteran
patients while furthering the academic
programs of Stanford University, the

Department of Veterans Affairs and the
faculty and staff of both organizations. I
have been chief of staff at the VAPAHCS
since July 1990 and a Stanford faculty
member based at the VAPAHCS since
1968. The allegation that I have "created
an environment that interfered with the
academic work conducted at the hospital
by the Stanford faculty" is just that, a
bare allegation not supported by the facts.
In fact, during my tenure as chief of staff
and associate dean of research and educa
tional programs, positions and space have
grown despite severe budgetary con
straints.
With regard to Dr. Adolf Pfefierbaum's

situation at the VAPAHCS, it should be
noted that he voluntarily resigned his VA
appointment on July 1, 1996. Prior to his
resignation he had the opportunity to be
heard by a VA peer psychiatrist grievance
examiner, who after taking testimony
under oath ruled against Dr. Pfefferbaum
and denied his grievance.
Following this, Dr. Pfefferbaum went
to the courts in an attempt to obtain a
legal judgment against me personally.
His lawsuit was dismissed by a judge of
the United States District Court, North
ern District of California, on Nov. 14,
1996.
Finally, I take great exception to the

comments of the attorney of Drs. Wene
grat and Pfefferbaum, Mr. Paul
McCloskey, who is quoted as saying that
I have "committed medical misconduct."
This is another false allegation. In my
more than 35 years as a practicing
physician, I have never had a judgment
found against me for medical miscon
duct. If Mr. McCloskey is aware of any
incident of "medical misconduct," he
should come forward now with the
specifics.
