# Professors rally around Dr. Mazze
## 
### 
It was with great surprise and some
dismay that we, members of the Stan
ford faculty and Veterans Affairs physi
cians, read the article titled "Response
filed in Med School case" (Wednesday's
front page). The characterization of Dr.
Richard Mazze — VA chief of staff,
School of Medicine associate dean for VA
affairs and tenured professor of anesthe
sia — was a person unrecognizable to
those of us who have been associated
with him, some for as long as 25 years.
Mazze, a life-long academician with
exceptional credentials in clinical activi
ties, research, teaching and administra
tion, is appreciated as an unwavering
supporter of academic medicine. For this
reason he was selected six years ago to be
the chief of staff at the Palo Alto Division
of the VA and the associate dean for VA

affairs. He has been responsible for the
strengthening and academic enrichment
of clinical, teaching and research activi
ties at what has become a six-campus
division health care system, spreading
from Monterey to Livermore to Menlo
Park.
Listed below are a handful of exam
ples of tangible academic enhancements
for which he is directly responsible:
a) the creation of 30,000 square feet of*
new, state-of-the-art research laborato
ries in the new bed tower and adminis
tration buildings scheduled to open
imminently;
b) the addition of approximately 20
new faculty positions spread through
nearly all departments; faculty recruited
for these positions have broadened and
deepened the core of talented academi
cians already here;
c) support for, literally, thousands of
square feet of additional academic space
including:
1) accommodations for the Crisis

Simulation Center;
2) a vastly expanded and
improved Aging Studies Unit being
planned for the Menlo Park Division;
3) the Geropsychiatric facility at
Menlo Park, housing clinical, research
and new training programs in a facility
which our associate chief of staff for psy
chiatry describes as "without parallel in
this country";
4) well-equipped, new, expanded
facilities for accommodating new prima
ry-care training programs;
d) unwavering support for appropriate
academic time allotments for faculty in
an ever-increasing environment of "more
provider productivity";
e) an unwavering commitment to
assuring an academic milieu which gives
junior faculty the best chance for suc
cess;
112) an increase of 10 house staff posi
tions at a period when training positions
nationwide are being slashed;
g) an increase in peer-reviewed

research funding by independent VA
based investigators despite shrinking
research allocation budgets.
We, all members of the School of
Medicine faculty and employees of the
affiliated VA Palo Alto Health Care Sys
tem, believe that the allegations in the
aforementioned article are unsubstanti
ated by either our personal or profession
al interactions with Mazze. He has our
respect, admiration and gratitude for his
leadership, support for academic
medicine and forbearance in the face of
unsubstantiated accusations.
