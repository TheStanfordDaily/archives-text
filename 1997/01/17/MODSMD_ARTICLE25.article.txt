## Overtime Stanford beats Ducks on Oregon turf 72-69 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore. — Despite the best
efforts of Jamal Lawrence and a deaf
ening McArthur Crowd of 10,024, No.
15 Stanford overcame its worst shoot
ing performance of the season to escape
with a 72-69 overtime win over No. 24
Oregon last night.
Lawrence, a 6-foot-2 senior guard,
hit back-to-back three-pointers — he
was a sensational 8-of-ll from three
point land on the night — to key a 11-2
second-half run that put the Ducks in

command 43-35. But riding the shoul
ders of sophomore center Tim Young,
who scored 20 points and grabbed a
career-high 21 rebounds, the Cardinal
fought back to tie the game at 61-61
and force overtime, and Oregon finally
succumbed.
"We knew coming in this was gonna
be a tough road game, one of the tough
est of the year, and we came out and got
the victory against a top-25 team," said
sophomore guard Arthur Lee, whose
three-pointer in overtime put the Car-

dinal ahead for good 71-68. "It
feels great. I can't recall ever
feeling this good, except maybe
for the UCLA game at home."
Oregon senior point guard
Kenya Wilkins had a chance to
win the game at the end of regu
lation — and re-enact his hero
ics of a year ago when his run
ning 18-footer at the buzzer
gave the Ducks a 64-62 upset
victory — but his three-pointer
from the top of the key was
blocked by sophomore guard
Kris Weems.
Of course, Oregon may never
have even been in position to
win without the effort of
Lawrence, who finished with a
game-high 29 points.
"Jamal Lawrence hit some
big shots. Guys were there, but
he was still jumping up and
knocking them down," said
Stanford senior point guard
Brevin Knight. "And they made
a run. But we just kept with it,
kept chipping away."
Lawrence's three-point bar
rage helped stir the McArthur
Court crowd, which had kept
quiet for most of the first half.
But from halftime on, the fans
were all over the Cardinal.
"They got on us at the start of
the second half," Lee said. "It's
crazy. From warmups to the end
of the game, they're right on
you, talking, calling you every
name in the book. This is the
loudest arena I've ever played
in."

That may have been part of
the reason Stanford's normally
productive outside shooting was
nowhere to be found. All told,
the Cardinal shot a season-low
35 percent from the field and an
abysmal 48 percent from the
free-throw line.
"The things we usually do
well — shoot three-pointers,
shooting percentage and free
throws — we just didn't do so
well tonight," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery.
"The ball didn't go down early,
and I think some of the guys
started doubting themselves a
little bit."
As a result, the Cardinal
turned to Young for relief.
"Timmy was the difference
tonight," Knight said. "I can't
say enough about how much he
carried us. If it wasn't for him,
we're down big. In the end, he
got key rebounds to keep the
ball in our possession, [and] he
made some big shots."
With the win, Stanford
improves to 11-2 overall and 4-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference. It
also moves the Cardinal into a
first-place tie in the Pac-10 with
UCLA (Arizona dropped to 3-1
with last night's loss at USC)
heading into tomorrow's game
in Corvallis, Ore., against Ore
gon State (4-9, 0-4) at 7 p.m. on
Sports Channel (STV Channel
49).
"That was a huge break
through for us, without a
doubt," Montgomery said. "You
know that not everybody's
gonna get la road win at Ore
gon]. You know that a lot of peo
ple are going to come here and

come away with an 'L,' so it
gives you that much better
opportunity down the road."
"This is big, very big," Knight
said. "Not too many people are
going to come in here and win. If
you can get out of here with a
win, you take it and run with it."

EUGENE, Ore. — Despite the best
efforts of Jamal Lawrence and a deaf
ening McArthur Crowd of 10,024, No.
15 Stanford overcame its worst shoot
ing performance of the season to escape
with a 72-69 overtime win over No. 24
Oregon last night.
Lawrence, a 6-foot-2 senior guard,
hit back-to-back three-pointers — he
was a sensational 8-of-ll from three
point land on the night — to key a 11-2
second-half run that put the Ducks in

command 43-35. But riding the shoul
ders of sophomore center Tim Young,
who scored 20 points and grabbed a
career-high 21 rebounds, the Cardinal
fought back to tie the game at 61-61
and force overtime, and Oregon finally
succumbed.
"We knew coming in this was gonna
be a tough road game, one of the tough
est of the year, and we came out and got
the victory against a top-25 team," said
sophomore guard Arthur Lee, whose
three-pointer in overtime put the Car-

dinal ahead for good 71-68. "It
feels great. I can't recall ever
feeling this good, except maybe
for the UCLA game at home."
Oregon senior point guard
Kenya Wilkins had a chance to
win the game at the end of regu
lation — and re-enact his hero
ics of a year ago when his run
ning 18-footer at the buzzer
gave the Ducks a 64-62 upset
victory — but his three-pointer
from the top of the key was
blocked by sophomore guard
Kris Weems.
Of course, Oregon may never
have even been in position to
win without the effort of
Lawrence, who finished with a
game-high 29 points.
"Jamal Lawrence hit some
big shots. Guys were there, but
he was still jumping up and
knocking them down," said
Stanford senior point guard
Brevin Knight. "And they made
a run. But we just kept with it,
kept chipping away."
Lawrence's three-point bar
rage helped stir the McArthur
Court crowd, which had kept
quiet for most of the first half.
But from halftime on, the fans
were all over the Cardinal.
"They got on us at the start of
the second half," Lee said. "It's
crazy. From warmups to the end
of the game, they're right on
you, talking, calling you every
name in the book. This is the
loudest arena I've ever played
in."

That may have been part of
the reason Stanford's normally
productive outside shooting was
nowhere to be found. All told,
the Cardinal shot a season-low
35 percent from the field and an
abysmal 48 percent from the
free-throw line.
"The things we usually do
well — shoot three-pointers,
shooting percentage and free
throws — we just didn't do so
well tonight," said Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery.
"The ball didn't go down early,
and I think some of the guys
started doubting themselves a
little bit."
As a result, the Cardinal
turned to Young for relief.
"Timmy was the difference
tonight," Knight said. "I can't
say enough about how much he
carried us. If it wasn't for him,
we're down big. In the end, he
got key rebounds to keep the
ball in our possession, [and] he
made some big shots."
With the win, Stanford
improves to 11-2 overall and 4-1
in the Pacific 10 Conference. It
also moves the Cardinal into a
first-place tie in the Pac-10 with
UCLA (Arizona dropped to 3-1
with last night's loss at USC)
heading into tomorrow's game
in Corvallis, Ore., against Ore
gon State (4-9, 0-4) at 7 p.m. on
Sports Channel (STV Channel
49).
"That was a huge break
through for us, without a
doubt," Montgomery said. "You
know that not everybody's
gonna get la road win at Ore
gon]. You know that a lot of peo
ple are going to come here and

come away with an 'L,' so it
gives you that much better
opportunity down the road."
"This is big, very big," Knight
said. "Not too many people are
going to come in here and win. If
you can get out of here with a
win, you take it and run with it."
