# Stanford hoops controls Ducks
## Cardinal women continue home winning streak 
### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
It was supposed to be one of the
Cardinal's toughest home games all
season. It was a matchup between the
two top teams in the Pacific 10 Con
ference that promised to be an intense
inside battle. What it turned out to be
was a blowout.
Oregon supposedly had its best
chance to beat Stanford at Maples
Pavilion in a while. The 17-1 Cardinal
squad (5-0 Pac-10) entered the con
test with one starter out and another
questionable. Junior forward Vanessa
Nygaard, the team's second-leading
rebounder, is down with a knee
injury, and the status of senior point
guard Jamila Wideman, who has a
sprained ankle, was uncertain until
the start of the game.
Unfortunately for the Ducks, none
of that mattered as the Cardinal put
down the hammer midway through
the first half and never looked back in
what turned into a lopsided 85-61 vic
tory for Stanford, moving the team's
win streaks to 40 consecutive home
wins and 32 straight conference victo
ries.
"I think it was a post challenge,"
head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They have a really good inside game.
We know we're the biggest game on
everybody's schedule so we have to get
up 18 times."
Oregon only led for 1 minute, 45
seconds, until junior forward Naomi
Mulitauaopele scored six straight
points to put the Card up 6-3. From
that point on it was all Mulitauaopele
and senior guard Kate Starbird. The
duo combined for 43 points in the
game (22 for Starbird, a season-high
21 for Mulitauaopele), including 30 in
the first half.
"We're glad we came out with good
post play," Mulitauaopele said.
"They're pretty physical. It was defi
nitely a good challenge. We were
working really hard all week. I'm glad
we were able to touch the ball more
and step up and convert."
Stanford got its first double-digit
lead of the game with 8:38 left in the
half on two of Mulitauaopele's seven
first-half free throws and stretched
the lead to as many as 13 before the
Ducks cut the lead back to eight on a
12-footer from freshman Jenny
Mowe. The 6-foot-5 center led all
Duck scorers for the game with 17 in
Kara Wolters-like fashion.
But the impressive inside play of
the Ducks was no match for the inten
sity of the Card. Senior forward
Charmin Smith stepped up in the
absence of Nygaard to score eight
points and pull five rebounds but
more importantly held the larger Ari
anne Boyer, Oregon's leading scorer,
to just eight points.

"I think the way Charmin's been
playing, especially in the Pac-10
games, it's going to be hard for me not
to have her in the lineup," Van-
Derveer said. "She gives us defense,
rebounding and shoots the three
pointer. I'm very comfortable with
her out there."
Oregon never got any closer than
eight as Stanford stretched the lead to
18 at the half on a 15-foot jumper by
Wideman, who also finished the half
with five assists but saw limited play
ing time in the second half due to her
ankle injury.
"I was not really comfortable with
Jamila in the game," VanDerveer
said. "I saw her flinch once and that
was it. She's really valuable to our
team."
The Cardinal closed the first half
with a 12-2 run that it kept alive in

the second half by scoring the first
five points of the period and extending
the lead to 23. Despite picking up her
third personal foul, junior center
Olympia Scott was hot for the Card in
the opening of the half, scoring five
quick points before picking up her
fourth personal on a questionable
offensive foul call.
The officiating got even more
debatable just a few minutes later
when Oregon senior Renae Fegent
picked up her fourth foul as Starbird
drove into the lane and drew the
block, knocking Fegent to the floor. A
frustrated Fegent then slammed her
hands down hard on the pine and was
called for a technical foul, which
counted for her fifth personal of the
game.
