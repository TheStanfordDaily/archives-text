# Volleyball hosts California Bears
## Men to compete in first home match of the season at Maples 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
For all of you out there who
have complained about the ridicu
lous prices you had to pay to go
see Big Game, as well as the infla
tion in ticket prices that the cam
pus has seen in the last few years,
tonight is your chance to make a
statement when the men's volley
ball team hosts California.
Just show up at Maples Pavil
ion at 7 p.m. for an occurrence
that has become somewhat unique
at Stanford — a free athletic event.
If the fact that this event is
free is not enough to convince you
to go to tonight's game, perhaps
the fact that the Cardinal is the
No. 1 team in the country will
persuade you to come by. If noth
ing else, the malodorous presence
of the dirty Golden Bear in
Maples should bring out the
entire campus.
Enough, however, with the rea
sons to go to the game. Simply put,
this should not be a major chal

lenge for the Cardinal. Due to Title
DC, which mandates that athletic
programs offer equal numbers of
scholarships to male and female
athletes, the Cal team has
remained a club, not varsity, team.
Due to the inferior caliber of
Cal, the Cardinal players and
coaching staff want to worry
"about our side of the net." Since
the Bears are not a varsity team,
the match will not go on the Car
dinal's overall record. For this
reason, Stanford wants to con
cern itself with executing and
making final adjustments for
next weekend's play when it trav
els to Columbus, Ohio, to chal
lenge national powers Ohio State
and Indiana-Purdue-Fort Wayne.
The only goal the coaching
staff has involving the opposition
is that the Bears earn every point
they get. Even though the Bears
do not appear to be strong, Stan
ford does not want to give any
thing away. Aside from this goal,
the team cites three areas that
Stanford wants to improve in —

digging, ball control and service
reception. These have been areas
of some weakness for the team in
the preseason.
After playing the entire roster,
the coaches plan on playing the
starting unit for the greater part
of the match.
"We really need to give the
starters time together to get
ready for next week," said head
coach Ruben Nieves. "We have
never lost to Cal before, so this
game becomes a bigger deal to
them than to us. We do not want
to be the first team to lose."
Look for this year's team to
dominate the net. "We will be big
ger and stronger than Cal, as we
will be in most of our matches,"
Nieves said. "The only question,
not so much against Cal but in
the future against better teams, is
if firepower will be enough to
overcome the defense and ball
control of other teams."
The most exciting moment of
