## Gymnasts prepare for No. 1 UCLA 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The crowd can expect to wit
ness some quality performances
tonight at Burnham Pavilion as
the Cardinal gymnastics team
has thoroughly prepared to com
pete against No. 1 UCI-iA.
The Cardinal, which came in
ninth in last year's NCAA team
finals competition, is a team that
has been progressing to elite sta
tus over the last few seasons. Its
performance is expected to
sweep the audience off its feet
and rock the pavilion shortly
after the start of the competition

at 7:30 p.m.
"It's going to be an awesome
meet," said sophomore co-captain
Amy Murakami. UCLA is "a very
classy and well-respected team,"
and the Cardinal roster is fired
up and excited about the upcom
ing meet, Murakami said.
The Stanford squad opened
the season last weekend with a
brave fight against the Georgia
Lady Bulldogs, ranked No. 3 in
the nation. Georgia won the bat
tle with 195.025 points, over
Stanford's score of 191.4.
Although the competition
Stanford faced in its opening
meet was tough, each Cardinal

gymnast remained poised
through some shaky moments on
the beam and several weak points
in the bar routines. The Cardinal
still displayed its enthusiasm to
penetrate into the nation's top
with high-level moves of excep
tional difficulty throughout the
meet.
It is only a matter of time
before Stanford breaks into the
top tier. Georgia coach Suzanne
Yoculan said the Cardinal squad
is competing on the same field as
the nation's top teams. Stanford
just made mistakes that the
Georgia team did not, and this is
the main reason Stanford lost,
Yoculan said.

"We're shooting to be a lot
more consistent this weekend,"
Stanford coach Lisa Izzi said.
Although UCLA is the No. 1
team, the Cardinal gymnasts
show no fear. The Bruins are a
Pacific 10 Conference team, and
Stanford is used to seeing them

every year, Izzi said.
"We won't be especially ner
vous," Izzi said. "In fact, we'll
likely be more focused than we
were last week. Last week is what
you might call an ice breaker."
According to Izzi, the squad
had a strong practice week and;is
in good shape to face the vigorous
competition tonight.
"Conditioning went really well
this week," Izzi said. "We are get -
ting ready for pressure situa
tions. We are more well-toned
and refined."
"It's the beginning of the sea
son, so anything can happen,"
said sophomore Katie Fitz
patrick. "We are obviously goiflg
to be impressed by them a little
bit, but we have seen them before
and still think there is a good
chance as long as we concentrate
on us."
Some changes will take place
in the Cardinal roster as sevecal
gymnasts change hands in ord)?r
"to figure out what works best, to
see who can do best where,"
Murakami said.
Freshman Tara La Morte <is
scheduled to replace junior Aipy
Neil on the uneven parallel bars.
In addition, junior veteran
Christie Jones will take Fitjz
patrick's spot on the bars and
freshman Ann Thananopavarri's
spot on the floor exercise.
A few minor changes in some
routines are also expected to
ensure less mistakes and a con
sistent team performance.
"We're looking for more diffi
culty, more confident perfor
mances and a fantastic crowd,"
Izzi said.
