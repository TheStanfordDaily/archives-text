# Gymnasts head to Spartan Open
## 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
The Stanford men's gymnasts
are like warriors on a mission,
and that mission is to bring home
the NCAA title. Their quest
begins tonight at 7 p.m. at San
Jose State.
Last year, the Stanford men's

gymnastics team battled hard to
make it to the final round of the
NCAA-title fight but finished
third after Ohio State and Cali
fornia.
This time, however, there
are new warriors and new bat
tles. But unlike ancient fight
ers, the gymnasts have collect
ed their injuries before the

start of their mission.
The immediate future looks
grim for the gymnasts as several
are sidelined with injuries that,
for some, owe themselves more to
bad luck than anything else.
Consider freshman David
Ludlow, who redshirted last sea
son due to hand surgery but then
contracted pneumonia in the off
season, which required lung
surgery. Or junior Gabe Edle
man, who was bitten by a spider
and had to have his hand
drained.
Then there are those with
gymnastics-induced injuries, like
redslnrt sophomore Jeremy Her
man and senior Jaime Ellis. Her
man suffers from a bulging disc
in his back, whereas Ellis under
went shoulder surgery in early
September. Ereshman Craig
Nesbitt is also coming ofT knee
surgery earlier this year.
Nonetheless, the prospects for
the Stanford squad look good.
The injuries should be all cleared
up within a month, and the team
lost only three seniors for a total
of five events, which is not many
considering some gymnasts com-
I>ete in six events.
Add to the mix two strong
recruits, and the Stanford men
have reason to be optimistic
about their chances of bringing it
all home.
In the two freshmen, head
coach Sadao Hamada has gained
both talent and character. Nes
bitt joins the Stanford squad as a
Junior National Team member
with particular strength on rings
and the parallel bars. Nesbitt has
quickly brought a sense of hard
work and perseverance to the
gym. Hamada described him as
"the one that comes into the gmi
first and leaves last — the team
definitely needs someone like
him."
