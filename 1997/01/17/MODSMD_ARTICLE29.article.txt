# Gymnasts head to Spartan Open
## 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
The Stanford men's gymnasts
are like warriors on a mission,
and that mission is to bring home
the NCAA title. Their quest
begins tonight at 7 p.m. at San
Jose State.
Last year, the Stanford men's

gymnastics team battled hard to
make it to the final round of the
NCAA-title fight but finished
third after Ohio State and Cali
fornia.
This time, however, there
are new warriors and new bat
tles. But unlike ancient fight
ers, the gymnasts have collect
ed their injuries before the

start of their mission.
The immediate future looks
grim for the gymnasts as several
are sidelined with injuries that,
for some, owe themselves more to
bad luck than anything else.
Consider freshman David
Ludlow, who redshirted last sea
son due to hand surgery but then
contracted pneumonia in the off
season, which required lung
surgery. Or junior Gabe Edle
man, who was bitten by a spider
and had to have his hand
drained.
Then there are those with
gymnastics-induced injuries, like
redslnrt sophomore Jeremy Her
man and senior Jaime Ellis. Her
man suffers from a bulging disc
in his back, whereas Ellis under
went shoulder surgery in early
September. Ereshman Craig
Nesbitt is also coming ofT knee
surgery earlier this year.
Nonetheless, the prospects for
the Stanford squad look good.
The injuries should be all cleared
up within a month, and the team
lost only three seniors for a total
of five events, which is not many
considering some gymnasts com-
I>ete in six events.
Add to the mix two strong
recruits, and the Stanford men
have reason to be optimistic
about their chances of bringing it
all home.
In the two freshmen, head
coach Sadao Hamada has gained
both talent and character. Nes
bitt joins the Stanford squad as a
Junior National Team member
with particular strength on rings
and the parallel bars. Nesbitt has
quickly brought a sense of hard
work and perseverance to the
gym. Hamada described him as
"the one that comes into the gmi
first and leaves last — the team
definitely needs someone like
him."

Sophomore Clarence Miao displays his skill and flexibility on the
parallel bars in the NCAAs last season. The men gymnasts will
compete in San Jose tonight and tomorrow in the Spartan Open.
Also joining the Cardinal is
Jason Katsampes. Katsampes is
currently a Junior Elite National
Team member and has excellent
competition experience.
"I think that he is more talented
than anyone I have ever coached,"
Hamada said. "All around I think
he is better than Jair Lynch."
Lynch won a silver medal on the
parallel bars in the 1996 Olympics.
Stanford is led by three Ail-
American seniors: Jaime Ellis, lan
Bachrach and Keith Wiley. Both
Ellis and Wiley compete in all six
events, while Bachrach competes
in four.
"Also I've got some very strong
junior and sophomores — like
Clarence Miao, Jeremy Herman,
Scott Finklestein," Hamada said.
In tonight's match, the Cardi
nal will face San Jose State, Cali
fornia, UC-Santa Barbara and
various club teams at the Spartan
Open. Event finals will take place
tomorrow night, also at 7 p.m.
"Our main concern for this

weekend is to gain competition
experience and not get injured,"
said Finklestein, who will compete
in the all-around category this
year.
The gymnasts will also be adapt
ing to a restructured and more dif
ficult judging system. The value of
some skills have changed and some
moves have been devalued.
"I just want (the Cardinal gym
nasts) to show what they are capa
ble of doing and not get any
injuries," Hamada said.
The matchup between Cal and
Stanford is one that will be repeat
ed throughout the season. Both
teams finished well last year, with
Cal placing second nationally.
Additionally, Cal has added two
Ukranian Olympic team members
to its squad and will serve as
staunch competition for the Cardi
nal.
"Some important members of
the team are currently healing
from injuries," said team co-cap
tain Miao. "Once we are all
healthy, our team will be very
strong. We have more depth and
talent than we did last year, and we
are very motivated to compete well
in the upcoming season."
