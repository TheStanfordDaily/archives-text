## SCBN call-in show to feature co-hosts from Stanford Student Enterprises 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
Beginning this month, Stanford
Teleflicks, produced by SCBN in
conjunction with Stanford Student
Enterprises, will invite various rep
resentatives from the student en
terprises as co-hosts for its Satur
day evening call-in show.
The call-in show, which airs
every Saturday on SCBN at 10:30
p.m., allows Stanford students to
phone in and vote for the 11 p.m.
film they want to see. Students
choose from a selection of movies
and at the end of the show, the film
with the most votes is aired.
According to junior Tudor
Havriliuc, Teleflicks' program
manager, the new hosting system

for the call-in show is an effort to
make people understand that Tele
flicks is a joint project. "Both [the
student enterprises] and SCBN are
essential for its existence," he said.
In addition to Teleflicks, the stu
dent enterprises sponsors a variety
of activities such as Sunday Flicks,
the new Stanford Store, lecture
notes, airport shuttles and Bus
Back the Axe â€” which were former
ly considered the business projects
oftheASSU.
Havriliuc said the first guest on
the show will be John Hall, financial
manager of the ASSU and creator of
Teleflicks. Hall will appear next
Saturday.
Hall initiated the idea of bringing
movies to students through SCBN
free of cost during the 1995-6 school
year in response to the high cost of
cable in-room connections.
Beginning last fall, the student
enterprises and SCBN wrote an of
ficial contract specifying how
many movies would be shown and
at what times. The student enter
prises has set up a special fund to
rent out movies so SCBN can show

them for free.
"The fund to get the movies ia
about $12,000 ayear," said Havrili
uc. "We are able to get really good
movies that you cannot get on
video."
According to Havriliuc, the goal
of Teleflicks is twofold. "One is en
tertainment and the other is educa
tional."
The success of Teleflicks has
been impressive. In week five of fall
quarter, Teleflicks received 385
calls from viewers during the 30-
minute show. Forty percent of
callers were undergraduates and 60

percent were graduates.
"The show even provokes frat
wars, as some frats will call in and
want one movie and another frat a
different one," said Havriliuc.
The movies shown each week are
selected by a voting process via e
mail, including dorm lists, interna
tional lists and the SCBN lists. Re
cent movies on Teleflicks include
"12 Monkeys," "Striptease," "In
terview with a Vampire" and
"Shawshank Redemption."
Teleflicks for the upcoming
week are listed in The Daily's Inter
mission section each Thursday.
