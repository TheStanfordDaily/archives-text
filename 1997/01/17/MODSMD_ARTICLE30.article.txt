# Cardinal tennis leaves the
## Women play Pac-10 tourney in Seattle 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal women's tennis players hopefully
left room for some extra hardware when they
packed for their weekend trip to Seattle this week
end, where they will compete in the Women's
Pacific 10 Indoor Championships.
Virtually unmatched in the Pac-10 in the last
two years — Stanford has strung together two con
secutive undefeated conference seasons — the Car
dinal will most likely be lugging home some Pac-10
trophies when they return this Sunday.
The Pac-10 indoor tournament features three
flights in both singles and doubles competition.
Each school sends two singles players and one dou
bles team in every flight. The top two representa
tives from each school are placed in Flight 1, the
next in Flight 2 and the final two in Flight 3.
Donning the cardinal and white in the Flight 1
singles bracket are the squad's senior All-Ameri
cans, Katie Schlukebir and Sandra De Silva.
Schlukebir, who won both the singles and doubles
brackets of the Rolex Regional Tournament in
early November, is the bracket's third seed and
meets USC's Ditta Huber in today's first round.
De Silva sits right behind her Stanford counter
part as the fourth seed and will find Arizona's
Karen Goldstein across the net.
In an impressive statement of the Cardinal's
depth, Stanford sends two more Ail-Americans
into the Flight 2 singles bracket. Juniors Ania
Bleszynski and Julie Scott sit at the top of the
bracket as the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds, respectively.
Bleszynski, who last season competed in the No. 1
singles spot and finished the year a semifinalist in
the NCAA singles tournament, meets UCLA's
Kelly Rudolph in round one.
An All-American for the first time in her career
last season, Scott will clash with Arizona State's
Katy Propstra this afternoon.
Stanford is seeded No. 1 once again in Flight 3
singles, in the person of freshman Teryn Ashley.
In her first look at the rest of the Pac-10, Ashley
will meet another conference newcomer in ASU's
Kerry Giardano.
Freshman Jennifer Heiser, a native of Stock
ton, Calif., will also vie for a title in Flight 3. Heis
er will not find a fellow rookie across the net, how
ever, as she faces Pac-10 veteran Anna Moll from
ASU.
Each of Stanford's three doubles teams received
No. 2 seeds in their respective flights. Bleszynski
and Scott, who teamed up two years ago early in
their freshman season, face Katherine Costain and

Flight 2 representatives
Schlukebir and Ashley have a rare
match with an Oregon squad of
Shanelle Kaneshiro and Allna
Wygonowska. The final Cardinal
duo features Heiser and senior
Emily Burt, fresh off another suc
cessful soccer season. Their match
against UCLA's Kelly Rudolph
and Alyson Gray is Burt's first ten
nis action of the year.
"It's an opportunity for every
one to get a lot of matches in,"
Stanford head coach Frank Bren
nan said. "There is a consolation
draw, but hopefully we won't have
to use that. Jenn Heiser gets to
play singles and doubles; Teryn
Ashley gets to play singles and

doubles. It's not exactly a team
thing, but it's a little more than an
individual tournament."
Despite the flight assignments,
Brennan has yet to finalize the
Cardinal lineup. The six singles
spots and three doubles positions
will be determined in practice
before the onset of the dual-match
season, which opens Jan. 28
against Loyola Marymount.
"We have decided nothing,"
Brennan said. "But we had to get
something organized for this tour
nament. We had to get three differ
ent flights assigned. We don't want
to do a lot of challenge matches for
this tournament. We have this
event, and then we'll come back
and play quite a few challenge
matches."
Perhaps what is most frighten
ing for Pac-10 opponents is that
two of the Cardinal's top competi
tors, freshmen Lilia Osterloh and

Anne Kremer, are not making the
trip. The two prized recruits are
just returning to campus after
appearing in the Australia Open.
"They are just getting back into
the swing of school," Brennan
said. "That is why we are not tak
ing them. When they get back in
it, we are going to have to figure
out where they are going to play
also."
Even without Osterloh and
Kremer, all but one of Stanford's
12 representatives are seeded.
"We have a lot of talent this
year, so we are conscious of get
ting everyone as much experi
ence as we can," Brennan said.
"If we can have Lilia and Anne go
off and play a Grand Slam Aus
tralia Open, that's great. That
gives the others a chance to move
up and take their place temporar
ily. Then everybody's the better
for it."
