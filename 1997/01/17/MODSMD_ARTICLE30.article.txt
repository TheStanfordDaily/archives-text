# Cardinal tennis leaves the
## Women play Pac-10 tourney in Seattle 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The Cardinal women's tennis players hopefully
left room for some extra hardware when they
packed for their weekend trip to Seattle this week
end, where they will compete in the Women's
Pacific 10 Indoor Championships.
Virtually unmatched in the Pac-10 in the last
two years — Stanford has strung together two con
secutive undefeated conference seasons — the Car
dinal will most likely be lugging home some Pac-10
trophies when they return this Sunday.
The Pac-10 indoor tournament features three
flights in both singles and doubles competition.
Each school sends two singles players and one dou
bles team in every flight. The top two representa
tives from each school are placed in Flight 1, the
next in Flight 2 and the final two in Flight 3.
Donning the cardinal and white in the Flight 1
singles bracket are the squad's senior All-Ameri
cans, Katie Schlukebir and Sandra De Silva.
Schlukebir, who won both the singles and doubles
brackets of the Rolex Regional Tournament in
early November, is the bracket's third seed and
meets USC's Ditta Huber in today's first round.
De Silva sits right behind her Stanford counter
part as the fourth seed and will find Arizona's
Karen Goldstein across the net.
In an impressive statement of the Cardinal's
depth, Stanford sends two more Ail-Americans
into the Flight 2 singles bracket. Juniors Ania
Bleszynski and Julie Scott sit at the top of the
bracket as the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds, respectively.
Bleszynski, who last season competed in the No. 1
singles spot and finished the year a semifinalist in
the NCAA singles tournament, meets UCLA's
Kelly Rudolph in round one.
An All-American for the first time in her career
last season, Scott will clash with Arizona State's
Katy Propstra this afternoon.
Stanford is seeded No. 1 once again in Flight 3
singles, in the person of freshman Teryn Ashley.
In her first look at the rest of the Pac-10, Ashley
will meet another conference newcomer in ASU's
Kerry Giardano.
Freshman Jennifer Heiser, a native of Stock
ton, Calif., will also vie for a title in Flight 3. Heis
er will not find a fellow rookie across the net, how
ever, as she faces Pac-10 veteran Anna Moll from
ASU.
Each of Stanford's three doubles teams received
No. 2 seeds in their respective flights. Bleszynski
and Scott, who teamed up two years ago early in
their freshman season, face Katherine Costain and

Hawaii last season. The tennis team travels to Seattle
this weekend for the Pac-10 Indoor Championships.
