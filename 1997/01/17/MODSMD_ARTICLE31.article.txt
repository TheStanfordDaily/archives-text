### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
team heads to Albuquerque
today to take on No. 20 New
Mexico in its first dual match of
the season.
The Cardinal squad will be
honoring the Lobos in a special
tennis match in the dedication
ceremony of New Mexico's new
indoor tennis center.
"We are looking forward to
our first real match of the sea
son," said head tennis coach
Dick Gould, who is in his 31st
season with the team. "We are
excited to be going out there in
front of a big crowd and chris
tening their new tennis center
for them."
New Mexico will be a good
season opener for the young and
talented Cardinal team. Last
year, New Mexico qualified for
the NCAAs and almost pulled
off a huge upset when it lost a
close match to UCLA.
"It should be an exciting
match against New Mexico.
They had UCLA on the ropes
last year, and they let them get
away," Gould said. "We will be
playing indoors and at 5,000-
(feet)-plus altitude, so we need
to be ready to play with the ele
ments being a little different
there. It will be a good match in
preparation for the team indoor
tournament."
The Cardinal lineup will
include sophomore Ryan
Wolters at the No. 1 spot, fol
lowed by junior Paul Goldstein
and freshmen Bob Bryan and
Mike Bryan. Rounding out the
