Football
Earle Mosley was named the
new Stanford football running
backs coach yesterday by head
football coach Tyrone Willing
ham. Mosley will replace Don
Treadwell, who accepted the job
of offensive coordinator at
Boston College.
Mosley had been the running
backs coach at Notre Dame since
1992 under Lou Holtz. In his
five seasons at Notre Dame,
Mosley helped develop one of the
top rushing offenses in college
football. He coached three of the
six running backs in Irish histo
ry who gained more than 1,000
yards rushing in a single season:
Reggie Brooks in 1992, Lee Bec
ton in 1993 and Autrey Denson
this year. Other great running

backs coached by Mosley
includes Jerome Bettis, Ray Zel
lars and Randy Kinder.
Mosley's 1993 and 1995
squads ranked sixth In the coun
try, and he was a part of four
bowl teams at Notre Dame: the
1993 and 1994 Cotton Bowls,
1995 Fiesta Bowl and 1996
Orange Bowl.
Before working at Notre
Dame, Mosley coached the
defensive line at Temple, defen
sive backs and outside lineback
ers at Northwestern and the
defensive backs at Rutgers.
Women's Golf
Tim Baldwin, head women's
golf coach the past 18 years,
was named coach emeritus of
the Cardinal women's golf pro

gram. Baldwin will retire from
his active coaching and be
responsible for the Medalist
Club and all components of
fund raising for the Cardinal
women's golf program. Caro
line O'Connor will assume
duties as head coach.
"I am excited about the
opportunity to continue to help
the program that has grown
from its infancy to be one of the
best in the country during my 16
years as coach," Baldwin said.
During his tenure as head
coach, Baldwin's teams have
advanced to the NCAA Champi
onships 15 times, including the
last eight. His 1992 and 1995
squads finished fourth in the
nation â€” the best finishes ever
for the Cardinal.
