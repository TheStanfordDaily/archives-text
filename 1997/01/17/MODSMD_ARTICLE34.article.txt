# It's Time to Wear a Crazy Hat — or — A Lousy One-Joke Payoff
## 
### 
What is funny? The answer varies. One
guy says,"I like that guy, Don Rick
les — he's funny." The other guy fer
vently disagrees, immediately responding
"Don Rickles is a real jerk — he just makes fun
of audience members." You see? People dis
agree about humor all of the time, and every
one seems to have their own strong opinions
about "what's funny" and "what's snot."
Some people, like me, think jokes from the
third-grade are funnier than anything, even a
guy with a crazy hat, and 1 apologize to all of
you. The "humor problem" poses a particular
ly difficult obstacle for those aiming to make
people laugh, especially those targeting a wide
audience composed of multitudinous origins,
temperaments and political sensibilities.
What is the common thread that links us
all together and makes us laugh? Have you
seen what other countries laugh at? Jerry
Lewis's brothers, men dressed in bumble bee
suits, appendages that are entirely too big, pies
in faces and dogs with a funny walk. No, I
don't suppose there is any one thing in the
world which coaxes a guffaw from every single
man and woman. Trying to make all people
laugh is an exercise in futility, and this multi
colored quilt of a world is destined to die hold
ing it's one great laugh selfishly to it's heart.
No! No wiiy, Jose! There has to be a single
thing at which we, as one species descended
from the same screaming monkey, can all laugh.
Just to remind you, this is of particular impor
tance to me, as a clown and current holder of
your stuttering attention. Don't go yet, there's a
joke at the end. First, though, an examination of
what is funny and what is not and why.
Aiding me in this presentation will be
Shortstack the Little Ghost. Currently being

sued by Casper the Fr ly Ghost (sorry, folks,
can't use his real name), he's the hottest thing
in Hollywood, and he looks a lot like Casper
and everyone wants him on their show. We
have him here today because Diversions paid
him an enormous fee, and he's addicted to a
berry that I grow in my closet, so he's pretty
much always around me. Hey, Shortstack!
"Whassup, Eric!! Where are the berries,
master?"
Never mind that right now. Hey, Short
stack! I've been thinking really hard lately
about what's funny to all human beings. 1
want to know because 1 want to leak this
humor onto the world in order to save it from
certain nuclear annihilation. So, for humani
ty's sake, can you think of anything that
everyone always laughs at all of the time?
"That s easy. You see, one laughs when two
different 'concept planes' intersect each other.
Their intersection creates an unsuspected 'con
cept combination,' and the shocked, delighted,
surprised mind sends a message from the back
brain to the mouth to 'laugh out loud.' For
example, imagine a baby. Now imagine a dog.
As representatives of two distinctly different
'concept planes,' they both offer their own sepa
rate web of meaning. But, hey — Dogbaby! You
see, the suddenness of the collision of these two
separate conceptual planes made you laugh out
loud, and stimulation will lead your brain to
further experiments with the new word. What
does a Dogbaby look like? Do Dogbabies make
messes doubletime? Can Dogbaby ever be pres
ident of the United States ? Dogbaby has a new
rock band, Dogbaby and the Envelope Heads!
You see, the brain has become fascinated with
the interplay of 'Baby' and 'Dog,' and the
synapses can not stop sizzling with new con

nections. Lucy in the Sky with Dogbaby!"
Sorry about that, folks. Shortstack has
been under a lot of pressure from the Swiss
Mafia lately, and he's either eating berries or
talking gibberish these days. He brings up an
important point, however, that if there's any
thing that makes all humans laugh, it's locat
ed deep within our common psyche, the one
that we inherited from a bunch of screaming,
fighting monkeys.
I see the column nears its end. Please do
not go yet — it's so cold here, my new friends
— let us warm ourselves with companionship
until the column's conclusion. Besides, you've
been promised a joke, and you are probably
expecting some sort of conclusion.
The conclusion here is that there is no con
clusion. Humor is complicated, and "what
makes people laugh" is beyond anybody's
understanding. That's why it feels good to
laugh, because it's one of the few things we
haven't quite learned how to control. Laughter
is a spontaneous burst of transcendence, and
it's the unexpected nugget that we all simply
know and dig.
Hut, just for science's sake, and just
because 1 recently bought a supercomputer
that takes up most of my roommate's room,
let's ask the computer, whose name is COM
PUTER.
COMPUTER,what is funny to every single
human on this planet of ours? (answer upside
down at bottom)
