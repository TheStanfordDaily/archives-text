A new weekly DIVERSIONS feature created
to educate the public about the craft
Here's a cartoon submission by a Stanford junior
whom we'll call ' Creosote Bush" that allows us to
look closely at Funny. A certain type of Funny is
achieved in this depiction, but it's not the deep, res
onant Funny that most humans crave. The reason
why it is "funny' 1 is because it is drawn well and the
techniques employed remind us of funny cartoons
we've seen before. The problem, however, lies in the
content, which leaves us as confused as Buddy
Holly seems to be in the cartoon. We are never told
WHY Buddy Holly converted to Islam. Of course, the
artist may be referring to a particular Buddy Holly
song, in which case the reference made in the car
toon is too obscure to be enjoyed by a wide public
audience.
