# 'A wild time to be alive'
## Barlow explains technology growth 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
Declaring it is "a wild time to be
alive," John Perry Barlow, a leader
in information technology, exam
ined the relationship between
academia and technology in a
speech to a small but impassioned
audience in Cubberley Auditorium.
The speech is the first in a series
of lectures called "Discourse@Net
works.2ooo." Sponsored by the
Stanford Humanities Center, the
lectures explore what new develop
ments in technology hold for the

future.
Barlow is the co-founder of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation,
an organization that examines is
sues affecting technology and soci
ety.
"We are at the edge of the most
profoundly transforming event
since the invention of fire," he said.
The development of technology
will continue at its fast pace as hu
mans continue to be dissatisfied
with things as they find them, Bar
low said.
"Humankind has a permanent
hard-wired dissatisfaction with
things as we find them," he said.
"Every human has an itch that
cannot be scratched. There is no
way to find a balm to that itch to
stop technology at its present
huge, hurtling pace."
Instead, Barlow urged the audi
ence to find ways to adjust to tech
nology.
"There is no stopping it. It is an
inevitable process. The issue is
how we are going to go about living
with this tsunami that is engulfing
us," he said.
Barlow identified a number of
issues — intellectual property
rights, privacy, freedom of speech
—which new technologies con
front.
"Every existing power relation
ship on the planet will be rene
gogiated," he predicted. "Every re
lationship will be up for contract
renewal."
Barlow, a former lyricist for the
Grateful Dead, said the issue of in
tellectual property rights arose for
the band when fans wanted to
videotape their concerts.
Initially, Barlow was reluctant
to agree but conceded when he re
alized that videotaping would in
crease the band's popularity.
"Our value became not in the
thing we had done, but in the thing
we had not done yet," he said. "In
information technology, it is not
what you have done but what you
will do."
His group's organizers believe
that such discussions will stimu
late ideas between intellectuals in
the humanities and technology
leaders.
"It is important to recognize
that the Internet is not just about a
new technology, but it is about
fundamental and personal social
changes," said Alan Bush, a doc
toral student in philosophy.
"Technology is neither good or
bad. It is how it is used that makes
a difference and how it is going to
change our lives," Bush said.
The next lecture in the series
will feature a debate between Hu
bert Dreyfus, a philosophy profes
sor at UC-Berkeley, and Richard
Rorty, a humanities professor at
the University of Virginia. It will
be held Feb. 5 at 5 p.m.
