# In upset, Canadian seizes control of Daily
## Friend and family saddened by surprising turn of events 
### Jesse Ochs Feld Special to The New York Times 
Elizabeth Alison Goldman,
one of The Daily's current man
aging editors and a former chief
obituary writer, was elected vol
ume 211 editor in chief last
night. She was 20 years old.
Earlier in the day, before her
election was so frightfully immi
nent, Goldman shared a happy
moment with her supporters,
imploring them not to mourn
for her new status.
"Don't cry for me [Stanford
Daily]," she said — her unfortu
nate state of dementia evi
denced by the lemur on her
shoulder. "The truth is I never
left you," she added.
As the results were an
nounced and it became clear
that Goldman would, sadly, be
come the next editor in chief,
she was obviously overcome by
the Daily staffs devotion to her.
"You must love me," she ex
claimed.
Most, but not all, of The
Daily's staff was moved by her
exclamation. "It almost wasn't
worth hearing that with such a
lousy sound system," kvetched
Cardinal Cogen correspondent
Therese Lee, who does not live
with a boy.
Goldman's election came
after a long and painful history
of association with The Daily.
She began her long work with
this organization as a freshman,
writing a whopping 66 stories
that year.
"We're certainly saddened by
this," said Carolyn Sleeth, Gold
man's close friend. "But at the
same time, she'd been suffering
for such a long time, waiting for
this moment to come, really,
that it's almost a blessing."
Many of those who knew
Goldman during her long,
painful decline spoke well of
her.
"There's no question that she

was the single best reporter we'd
ever seen," said Sarah Katz, who
served as news editor during
Goldman's early days with The
Daily. "It's just such a shame
that things had to end up this
way."
Professional Journalist Burt
Herman, who served in various
editorial positions during much
of Goldman's Daily career,
echoed similar sentiments: "She
was a great writer and editor —
at least for a brunette. But at
least she's petite. Anyway, it's
just so idiotic it all had to end up
like this."
But another professional
journalist, Andy Dworkin, did
not share Katz and Herman's
views of Goldman.
"I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's terrible what's happened,
and I really do feel for her
friends and family," he said.
"Still, though she was a good re
porter, she certainly didn't
write the best first story ever."
As her illustrious — but,
sadly, brief — career pro
gressed, Goldman moved on to
serve as The Daily's news edi
tor. After that job, she served as
news editor. And then, in her
most recent position, served as
news editor.
"She trieit hard and means
well, but it's a shame that she's
kind of corrupt about the whole
thing," said ASSU President
Bill Shen. It is rumored that one
Michelle Hanson played a key
role in allowing Goldman to hold
the news editor post for an un
precedented third time.
Goldman's parents, Terry and
Bernadine Goldman of Los Alam
os, N.M., her three siblings, Oliv
er, Leah and Matthew Goldman,
also of Los Alamos, were incon
solable after hearing the news.
A memorial service for Gold
man will be held Jan. 31 in the
ASSU Senate office. The Daily
staff requests that alcohol be
sent in lieu of flowers.
