# Police nab suspect in recent car burglaries
## 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Contributing writer 
The successful apprehension yesterday of 37-
year-old Gordon Ford marks the first big break
made by Stanford police officers in their effort s to
combat a recent rash of car burglaries.
Ford was arrested after plainclothes police of
ficer Alex Bocharov witnessed Ford allegedly
breaking into a car in the Stock Farm parking lot,
located off ofWelch Road. The parking lot is in the
area around the Stanford Hospital, which has
been heavily targeted by police for a surveillance
program.
The parking lot surveillance program, accord
ing to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, was
set up in reaction to a series of car burglaries first
noticed in September.
The program has taken a considerable
amount of manpower, said Niemeyer, with plain
clothes officers serving as "spotters" throughout
the lots. The spotters have been placed at fixed
posts and have also been roving t he areas in vehi
cles, on foot and by bicycle.

Prior run-ins with law enforcement officers
helped police identify Ford yesterday as he en
tered the lot in his brown Dodge Challenger. The
spotters watched as he attempted to break into a
car.
Niemeyer said Ford "had the car open in the
blink of an eye, but when the alarm went off, he
took off on foot."
As plainclothes officers converged in the park
ing lot, Ford noticed the activity and began to run.
He was apprehended by Stanford Deputy Bob
Henderson and Detective Tim Schreiner.
Before the arrest, Schreiner recalled similar
burglaries in Menlo Park during 1992 for which
Ford had been convicted and jailed.
At that time, according to Niemeyer, Ford
"bragged about a Stanford burglary." During the
1992 incident, the car's owner returned, discov
ered Ford in the car and threatened to call police.
According to Niemeyer, Ford's retort to the car
owner was, "Well, you better hurry because I'm
leaving."
Ford has had bad luck evading police, how
ever. After his 1992 arrest, Ford was convict-

Ed again in 1995 of vehicle theft and jailed
until December 1996.
Once on parole, Ford was required to report to
parole officers. He reported once and then disap
peared.
Ford did not turn up again until California
State Patrol ran a check recently on a suspicious
vehicle. The vehicle. Ford's brown 1979 Dodge
Challenger, had stolen tabs on the license plate.
Ford lied about owning the car at the scene of the
check and was not apprehended. State Patrol
subsequently declared Ford a parolee at large.
Police began closing in on Ford, however,
when he allegedly assaulted a police officer in the
process of a burglary Wednesday.
The officer, who was unarmed at the time, at
tempted to apprehend Ford in the Palo Alto Vet
erans Administration Hospital parking lot. The
incident, said Niemeyer, seems to indicate that
Ford has been targeting hospital parking lots.
Niemeyer added that the officer was slashed at
with a screwdriver or a knife when he approached
