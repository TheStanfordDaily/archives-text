# PA council to consider sit-lie law
## 
### Vicky Anning Contributing writer 
The Palo Alto City Council is scheduled to vote
tonight on a controversial ordinance that would ban
sitting and lying on a seven-block stretch of Universi
ty Avenue sidewalks.
If the initiative is approved, beginning Feb. 21 peo
ple caught lying and sitting on University Avenue
sidewalks between High and Cowper streets from 11
a.m. until 11 p.m. could face a fine. Under the ordi
nance, however, a person cannot be detained for a vi
olation.
While some council members insist that the pro
posed ban addresses safety concerns in the downtown
area, critics regard the ordinance as an infringement
of First Amendment rights and a veiled attempt to re
move the homeless from the streets of Palo Alto.
The ordinance was hotly debated before a packed
council chamber last July, when more than 30 mem
bers of the public criticized the proposed law.
Councilor Gary Fazzino said at the July meeting
that people sitting or lying on sidewalks pose a poten
tial hazard to pedestrians, especially the elderly, in
firm or visually impaired.
The Stanford Homelessness Action Coalition, a
group of Stanford students and local homeless peo
ple, has organized opposition to the proposed legisla
tion and most recently mounted a telephone cam
paign to lobby council members against the ordi
nance.
"SHAC [is] very well organized and lhasi a lot of
members," Councilor Micki Schneider said. "Those
people really come out and are very vocal" at meet
ings.
However, many Palo Alto residents who support
the ordinance choose to communicate their views by
phone and do not attend meetings, said Schneider,
who intends to vote in favor of the initiative.
SHAC activists said the driving force behind the
ordinance was the business community of Palo Alto.
"It's another attempt to sweep the homeless
away," said Matt Bartels, a doctoral student and
SHAC activist.
The so-called "sit-lie" ordinance was originally
slated to return to the council in September, after
City Attorney Ariel Calonne incorporated several
modifications requested by coun
cil members. The new version of
the ordinance includes provisions
for street performers, as well as
seven exceptions to the sit-lie ban.
For example, people involved in
medical emergencies, sitting in a
wheelchair or stroller, or sitting
on a park bench all are exempt
from the ban.
"It has taken [council mem
bers] half a year to work out a way
to get around the First Amend

ment issues," Bartels said. "They
have stopped asking whether it is
good or bad law and are trying to
find loopholes."
The Palo Alto sit-lie ordinance
is modeled after a similar law in
Seattle which recently was upheld
by the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap
peals.
According to Palo Alto Mayor
Joseph Huber, who is also a
lawyer, the city attorney is expect
ing a legal challenge if the ordi
nance is passed tonight.
Huber said he is waiting until
the public hearing tonight to de
cide his vote, and he could not pre
dict whether the ordinance would

receive majority support among
his colleagues.
Schneider said she was hopeful
that the ordinance would pass and
was confident of support from at
least two of the council's nine
members.
Fighting the ordinance "is an
uphill battle, but it's doable," said
senior Olivia Wang, a SHAC ac
tivist.
Other SHAC members were not
as hopeful. "It's pretty much a
done deal," said Danny Daye, a
SHAC member who is now home
less.
The meeting begins at 7 tonight
at Palo Alto City Hall.
