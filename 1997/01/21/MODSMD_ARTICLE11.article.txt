## Clinton reaffirms presidential oath of office 52nd inauguration marked by pledges of bipartisan leadership for the 21st century 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
William Jefferson Clinton began
his second term as president yes
terday, promising to lead the
nation into the 21st century with
a government that "does more
with less." In a day of inaugural
fanfare and political reflection,
he urged an end to Washington's
"petty bickering and extreme
partisanship."
Five minutes after noon, as a
warming sun shone down on the
chilled Capitol audience, Clinton
put his left hand on the family
Bible held by his wife and raised
his right hand to recite the 35
words spoken by every president
since George Washington.
"Good luck," Chief Justice
William Rehnquist said when the
president finished the oath
before an audience of 250,000
people.
The crowd broke the silence
with a roar of cheers. The presi
dent turned and swept up Hillary
Rodham Clinton and their
daughter, Chelsea, in a two
armed hug. Cannons fired a mili
tary salute.
Clinton will be the first presi
dent of the 21st century and the
approach of a new millennium
was very much on his mind at the
rebirth of his presidency. Clin
ton's vision of his second term
was one of practicality.
"As times change, so govern
ment must change," Clinton

said. "We need a new govern
ment for a new century — hum
ble enough not to try to solve all
our problems for us but strong
enough to give us the tools to
solve our problems for ourselves,
a government that is smaller,
lives within its means and does
more with less.
"Our land of new promise will
be a nation that meets its obliga
tions, a nation that balances its
budget but never loses the bal
ance of its values, a nation where
our grandparents have secure
retirement and health care."
Bob Dole, the defeated Repub
lican presidential nominee, was
in Washington but kept out of
the public eye and issued no
statements. He was remembered
at Clinton's inauguration in
comments by Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., and the Rev. Billy Gra
ham.
Clinton's first official act was
to sign a proclamation declaring
yesterday a national day of hope
and renewal.
Madeline Albright, mean
while, won unanimous approval
from the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee to be secretary
of state. She is the first of Clin
ton's new Cabinet nominees to
pass committee scrutiny, and the
full Senate is expected to confirm
her quickly.
The inaugural parade route
was a wall of patriotic bunting.

and thousands of people lined the
streets. There were 116 bands
and marching units from around
town and across the nation.
The Clintons rode most of the
way in their limousine but then
delighted the crowd by walking
the last two blocks to the White
House. The president and
Chelsea stripped off their coats
despite the cold.
Clinton was the first Demo
crat in 60 years elected to a sec
ond term.
Unlike his first term, when
Democrats ruled Congress as
well as the White House, the
president began this time facing
a partisan Republican majority
in the House and Senate. Clin
ton, in his inaugural address,
said Americans did not elect a
divided government "to advance
the politics of petty bickering and
extreme partisanship they plain
ly deplore."
The promises and challenges
of a new century — and a new
millennium — were woven
throughout the president's
speech from the west steps of the
Capitol.
"At the dawn of the 21st cen
tury, a free people must now
choose to shape the forces of the
Information Age and the global
society, to unleash the potential
of all our people and, yes, to form
a more perfect union," Clinton
said.
