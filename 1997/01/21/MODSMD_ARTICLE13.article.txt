Conducting a use study
would help determine if
charging students is fair

WITH TUITION QUICKLY
approaching $30,000 per
academic year, Stanford
students treasure anything they
can get for free: the occasional free
admission to an athletic event, free
T-shirts and candy offered in front
of the Bookstore just for applying
for a credit card, even free "beer" at
fraternity parties.
But, surely the one free entity
Stanford students have come to
enjoy the most is access to the
Internet, which is why students
were understandably disappointed
to hear that this free access is not
permanently guaranteed.
At a Faculty Senate meeting last
month, Stanford Chief Information
Officer Glen Mueller said students
cannot depend on free Internet
access in the future. Although stu
dents will not be charged within the
next year, no guarantees can be
made beyond that. Students will be
notified 12 months in advance,
however, if the administration
decides to charge them for Internet
access.
Mueller's statement sparked
some debate throughout the cam
pus as to whether students have
the right to expect free e-mail and
other Internet services or whether
they have just been taking the use
for granted.
Before any decision is made as to
the fate of free Internet access for
students, the administration
should conduct a use study. If stu
dents are largely using the Internet
for games, mass forwarding of jokes
and other nonessential activities,
charging students for the use
would be somewhat understand
able.
However, if students are largely
using the Internet for academic
purposes, charging them seems
unfair. Many professors and teach
ing assistants have increasingly

relied on the Internet as a teaching
tool. Class announcements are
often sent through e-mail and
many classes are even starting
their own Web pages complete with
syllabi, slides, lecture notes and
other essentials. Charging students
for keeping up with their classes is
unfair, and wealthier students
should not have the clear-cut
advantage of accessing class infor
mation which their less wealthy
counterparts cannot.
Research, too, has become
increasingly Internet-based. Imag
ine doing a research paper, let alone
an honors thesis, without access to
the Internet. Again, if students are
using the Internet for academic
purposes, access should be free.
Free Internet access has also
helped students mobilize to affect
change. The ability to reach many
students at once has become nearly
essential for many student groups.
Stop Monopolies on Campus' e
mail posting of students wishing to
buy and sell used books at lower
prices than the Stanford Book
store's offerings and the student
movement to convince the adminis
tration to grant tenure to Anthro
pology Prof. Akhil Gupta are just
two recent examples. While these
movements do not fall strictly into
the academic realm, they do show
that students can learn and benefit
from free Internet access in cre
ative ways.
While the administration decides
whether to charge students for
Internet access, students should
treasure the free use while they still
have the opportunity to do so. This
not only means using it but more
over, using it wisely.
If students can limit the playing
of games, sending of chain letters
and mass forwardings of jokes, per
haps they can reduce the cost of
Internet use for the administra
tion, and thus, further delay the
move to charge them for access.
With the prices of room and board,
tuition and books reaching all-time
highs, we should do anything in our
power to keep Internet access free
of charge.
