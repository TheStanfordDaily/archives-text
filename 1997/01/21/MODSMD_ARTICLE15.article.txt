## Race matters on the Farm 
### 
GROWING UP, MOST of my male
friends were black. Some were
Mexican. Only one was white.
When I ventured away from the South Side
to receive my worldly education at my
Jesuit uptown high school, the ethnic
makeup of my associates changed drastical
ly—as none of my close associates were
black males. Oddly enough, this peculiar
phenomenon has managed to subsist even
at Stanford; where I thought I would meet
other sharp, high-browed black men, I've
often found myself disappointed — alone
would be the more appropriate term — and
seemingly detached from the other black
males on campus.
However, Sunday evening, as I sat in the
Mirrielees computer cluster, I realized that
I was not alone in my despondency. Two
other black males, both whom I knew
vaguely, admitted to being equally troubled
by the male-male relations within the black
community, all of us finding some difficul
ty with the fact that few of our close associ
ates were black males.
So where are all those "educated
brotha's" that Stanford publicized during
pro fro weekend and in Approaching Stan
ford?
Certainly the only forum conducive to
brotha's fraternizing is not via Alpha Phi
Alpha; neither can we all be under the whip
of Coach Willingham. Have Ujamaa and
Mirrielees swallowed them up into their
bellies, or do the departments of sociology
and psychology have a mystical monopoly
on black men at Stanford? Maybe French
medievalism isn't "black" enough?

It just seems to me that interaction
between black males outside of the Trinity
(Uj, frat and football — three groups that I
have yet to "click" with) is virtually nonex
istent.
Perhaps other minority groups feel the
same way. But I see more diversity within
the Asian and Chicano communities. Pro
grams like Mi Familia and the Stanford
Society for Chicano / Latino Engineers and
Scientists — all housed under El Centro
Chicano — cater to both specialized and
unspecialized groups within the communi
ty. I see no "clique" propagated by these
ethnic communities.
Then again, half of the males in the
Asian community aren't playing football,
either.
Stanford's ethnic communities should
make sure that minorities feel at home on
the Farm. In the case of the black commu
nity, I am not uncomfortable with our
community, but it would be a lie if I said
that I was completely "at home" either. I
find very little appeal in the activities aimed
at promoting interaction between black
males.
Maybe I'm the problem? Perhaps I'm
placing to much emphasis on race — does
race really matter?
Of course it does.
The bonds between black males run
deeper than the context of slavery. There
is, of course, our music, our food, our com
munities — and the all too brutal realities
associated with those communities. Most of
us come from culturally rich black commu
nities — thus an often undeniable bond

between blacks, and especially black males,
does exist!
But the feeling that I get on campus is
very different.
I'm gonna let the non-black world in on
a secret: Whenever blacks see one another,
did you ever notice that we always nod or
say "hello"? For the most part, Stanford is
no different. Yet there are still some
bi-otha's who act like they can't speak.
Tiger Woods.
The point is: Why don't "educated"
black men associate with others of their cal
iber? Are we all of a sudden too good for
each other? Is there an intimidation factor?
Has "the man" played us so well that we
combat even each other?
I won't pretend to know the answer
because I don't.
What I do know is that I fancied my col
lege experience as a fountainhead for meet
ing other up-and-coming black males. But
in my years at Stanford, I've met very few.
And as my Stanford years dwindle away, so
does the opportunity for me to interact
with those like myself.
Perhaps a Black Medieval French Soci
ety would change things?
Peut-etre.
