The Bookstore's CEO disputes six widely believed myths

I AM CONCERNED about the follow
ing misconceptions which have
appeared on the pages of The Daily
over the last two weeks.
Misconception No. 1: The Stan
ford Bookstore profits at students'
expense.
The Bookstore is a nonprofit organi
zation. Our mission is to serve the fac
ulty, students and staff of the Universi
ty. The Bookstore's management team
and Board of Directors take this mis
sion to heart — we strive to keep costs
low and run a healthy business so that
we can return surplus revenue to the
University community through the
rebate.
Misconception No. 2: The Book
store overprices textbooks.
Textbook pricing begins with the cost
of the book from the publisher. Add to
this the cost of freight, plus warehouse
costs and labor to bring the books into
the store and put them on the shelves.
We cover our costs for textbooks, but as
the sole provider of textbooks at Stan
ford, we are committed not to raise prices
beyond that point.
Misconception No. 3: The Book
store deliberately prices textbooks
higher than general trade books.
The publisher's cost structure for
textbooks and general trade books is
undeniably different. With more than
1,000 crossover titles — sold in both
trade and textbooks — we have found
that price discrepancies go both ways, but

are somewhat more likely to appear at a
higher price on the textbook floor. Often
this difference is due to simple timing. If
a book sits unpurchased on the trade
sales floor for six months, and 100 copies
of the same title are brought in for text
book sales half a year later, these 100
copies will be priced higher if publisher
and freight charges have changed in the
intervening months (and they usually
do).
Just as often, price differences
between the two floors reflect the differ
ence in our cost from the publisher.
Contrary to the economic principle of
supply and demand, publishers often
charge bookstores less for a few copies of
a book that will be sold from a general
trade department than they will for the
same book bought in large quantity for
textbook sales. If more than nine copies
are ordered for trade book sales, many
publishers assume the book will be sold
as a text and refuse to sell at the lower
price.
College bookstores across the nation
face this same pricing dilemma for the
same reasons. The National Association
of College Bookstores is addressing the
legal ramifications of dual discounting
with publishers. We are working to solve
this problem at the store level as well, but
have not yet found the perfect solution.
Misconception No. 4: Bookstore
management promised to put a stu
dent on its Board of Directors.
Regrettably, someone misrepresented

this fact to the press after my meeting
with Stop Monopolies on Campus. I made
no such promise, nor did anyone else in
that meeting.
The Bookstore's Board of Directors
has 15 members who commit to three
year terms. Each year, the Bookstore
runs an advertisement in The Daily to
call for applications from anyone in the
community interested in serving on its
board. When the board has openings, cur
rent board members review the applica
tions and select new members.
Misconception No. 5: Book buy
back is capricious and unfair.
Unlike most college bookstores, the
Bookstore's buy-back is open everyday.
At the buy-back window, we separate
books into one of three categories:
1) If we believe the book will be adopt
ed for course use in the upcoming quar
ter, we will pay 50 percent of the new
price of the book. We assume the risk on
these books, and if they are used again
the following quarter, we sell them at 75
percent of the new price of the book. The
difference between what we pay for a
book and what we charge for it the fol
lowing quarter reflects our cost in han
dling and warehousing the book plus the
risk we assume on books which are not
adopted.
2) If the book is not likely to be used
again at Stanford, a national wholesaler
may wish to buy it for resale at another
university. National wholesalers assume
a greater risk and a higher cost since

freight factors heavily against them.
They typically pay 10 percent to 30 per
cent of the new cost of the book.
3) If the book is of no value to the
Bookstore, the wholesalers or the stu
dent, then the student may leave it with
us to be donated to charity with other
unwanted books.
The Bookstore is committed to the
buy-back program. We encourage stu
dents to make use of it to help control
textbook costs for everyone.
Misconception No. 6: It takes a
megaphone to get my attention.
I have never turned away anyone in
the Stanford community who has
requested a meeting to discuss the Book
store. I frequently meet with individual
students and student groups and wel
come the opportunity to discuss their
concerns.
If anyone has a question or comment
about the Bookstore, I urge them to
attend our annual Stanford community
informational meeting on Wednesday at
7 p.m. in the Stanford Law School, room
80. I will be there with members of the
Bookstore's Board of Directors and rep
resentatives of the Bookstore manage
ment team to answer questions and dis
cuss the concerns of the community.
I am also available by phone (329-
1217), fax (322-1936) and e-mail
(p.mendelson@bookstore.stanford.edu).
