## Women's streak up to 51 Wideman sits as No. 3 Card staggers to win 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
Playing the role of the sleeping giants, the third
ranked Stanford women's basketball team (18-1, 6-0
Pacific 10 Conference) snoozed through a lethargic
72-54 win over the beleaguered Beavers of Oregon
State (7-7, 1-4) last Saturday night before a restless
crowd of 7,016 at Maples Pavilion.
Save for another strong performance from senior
forward Kate Starbird, who had 28 points, the emo
tional play of junior center Olympia Scott (19 points)
and the composed point play of freshman guard Mile
na Flores (six points, seven assists in place of senior
Jamila Wideman, who was not in uniform Saturday),
the Cardinal had to endure a bad shooting night and
a 26-7 Oregon State run late in the game to finally
close out the win and avoid what could have been its
most embarrassing loss in recent memory.
"I thought Oregon State played very well, and I
think it's a real credit to their team," Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "They had a game plan,
and they stuck with it for 40 minutes."
Nevertheless, a team like Oregon State had no
business being in the game, let alone the same build
ing with Stanford. The Beavers' 6-3 nonconference
mark was an obvious mirage, as shown by its 62-57
loss to California on Thursday night. Saturday
night's game should have only further exposed them
as frauds in the Pac-10.
Instead, the Cardinal more or less went through
the motions, perhaps assuming it would bore the
Beavers to death. Unfortunately, it was playing

straight into Oregon State's hands, as Beaver head
coach Judy Spoelstra alluded to after the contest.
"We wanted to limit their transition," Spoelstra
said. "We felt that we had to be very patient on
offense. We wanted to take as much time oft the clock
and have Stanford play as much defense as possible."
The scoring in the first half indicated as much as
the Cardinal held a tenuous 18-12 advantage 10 min
utes into the game. Stanford eventually pushed the
advantage to as much as 18 twice on points by Scott
and senior guard Charmin Smith, but Oregon State
continued to hang around, trailing 34-22 just 2:40
before halftime. Starbird temporarily restored order
by scoring the team's final six points on the half, two
on a terrific baseline move that resulted in a sweet
reverse layp with 2:32 left in the half.
Stanford opened the last 20 minutes of play with a
clear intent to put Oregon State out of its misery,
going on a 13-2 run in the first 4 minutes to surge to
a 53-26 lead. Starbird and Smith were firing from the
outside, Flores was penetrating and Scott was work
ing hard underneath the basket. But just when it
looked ready to cruise to victory, the Cardinal got
stuck in neutral.
During the remaining 15 minutes, Starbird made
five field goals for 11 points and Scott drained three
for six points. As for the rest of the team? Junior for
ward Heather Owen nailed two free throws. Unable
to find the basket with radar, the Cardinal saw its 27-
point lead slowly diminish in 9 minutes. Beaver
junior forward Kris Walsh sank two free throws with
