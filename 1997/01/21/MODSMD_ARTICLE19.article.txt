# Win poses questions to ponder

### Robin Davidson Editorial staff 
For those who spent Saturday
night in some corner booth of
Polio's or Chili's watching the
Stanford men's basketball team
crumble in Corvallis, the
women's 72-54 defeat of the
Beavers (7-7, 1-4 Pacific 10 Con
ference) at Maples Pavilion gave
some interesting, although not
completely convincing, answers
to a few questions.
What happens when
you're the top team in the
conference and have been
for the past several years,
you're ranked in the top five
nationally and are expected
to make your third consecu
tive Final Four appearance
in March? You become the
biggest game on everybody's
schedule, and teams are more
"up" to play you than any other
opponent they face.
Just look at Oregon State.
The Beavers are arguably one of
the worst teams in the Pac-10,
but with 6 minutes, 8 seconds
left in Saturday's game the Car
dinal (18-1, 6-0) only led by
eight points.
Granted, Stanford was up by
16 at halftime and had as much
as a 27-point lead 5 minutes into
the second half, but that "never
die" mentality from Oregon State
and an off period of shooting
from the Card got the Beavers
back into the game.
"When we got the 27-point lead

same intensity," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "I think it was a
wake-up call for people and got
their attention. I felt we had it in
cruise control. We need to come
out with more intensity and a
more focused attitude."
But it was Oregon State that
had the focused attitude for about
10 minutes in the second period.
The Beavers went on a 26-7 run
starting at the 15:49 mark on a
driving layup by junior guard
Nicole McAllister, who scored
nine for Oregon State during the
run, and ending on two free
throws by junior center Kris
Walsh with 6:08 remaining. But
the Card stepped it up and only
allowed two Beaver points in the
final 6 minutes.
"It's a credit to our team that
we bring out the best [in other
teams]," VanDerveer said. "I
thought Oregon State played very
well. It's a credit to their team that
they came back. I reminded our
team afterward that it's a 40-
minute game, not 30.1 like the way
we finished."
Who do you turn to when
your team-leading senior
point guard is not dressed for
the first time all year, and you
know she won't be checking
into the game with 10 minutes
left to help save the day? You
simply expect the freshman back
up point guard to play like a veter
an, and that is just what Milena

Flores did.
Flores stepped into the starting
lineup for the first time all season
because of the injury to senior
Jamila Wideman and put up the
kind of numbers of which even the
four-year veteran would have been
proud. Flores tallied seven assists
to just three turnovers while scor
ing six points and pulling three
defensive rebounds.
"She really had a good game,"
VanDerveer said. "I thought it was
really big for her confidence. She
kept her poise and ran the team in
terms of the halfcourt offense."
Flores served notice to the
Beavers early with a powerful
layup just 2 minutes into the game
that brought the crowd of 7,016 to
its feet. Flores drove through traf
fic down the left side of the lane
and laid the ball over a defender
and off the glass from 3 feet out.
Finally, who do you count
on when the opposition is
making its run and your team
mates' shots seem to creep
halfway down the goal before
rolling back out? You count on
1996 co-Pac-10 player of the year
and potential national player of
the year Kate Starbird.
Starbird scored a game-high 28
in the contest and provided her
usual acrobatic, crowd-pleasing
scores throughout the game,
including a drive down the right
baseline in the first period that
ended with an "in-your-face"
reverse. Starbird ended the half as
the only player from either team in
double figures with 15.
"I don't remember her missing
too many," Beaver head coach

Judy Spoelstra said of Starbird.
"In the first half every time she got
to the key she'd finish and get to
the free throw line too."
Starbird has made a habit of
finishing in Pac-10 play so far this
year. The All-American guard has
been named Pac-10 player of the
week three times this season,
including the last two. Starbird
currently averages 29 points per
game in the conference in addition
to leading the Pac-10 in free throw
and three-point percentage.
In the second half against OSU,
Starbird didn't get as many looks
as she did in the first 20, but she
made the most of them, shooting 6-
for-7 in that period while the rest of
the Cardinal was a paltry 7-for-19.
Starbird seemed to be the only
player who could get the rock to
fall during the Beavers' second
half run and had five of the Card's
seven points during that dry spell
(the other two coming on a layup
from junior center Olympia Scott).
"I think we're a little too depen
dent on [Starbird]," VanDerveer
said. "Kate's been playing great for
our team, [but 1 Kate's allowed to
have a bad game once in a while."
The Cardinal made off with an
18-point victory and a 6-0 confer
ence record, but the team hopefully
gained more than a win against the
Beavers. If what VanDerveer said
is accurate, Stanford probably
renewed its intensity for playing a
full 40 minutes and eliminating
lapses in play, definitely built the
confidence of its freshman point
guard and provided Starbird once
again with the opportunity to show
why she's one of the nation's best.
