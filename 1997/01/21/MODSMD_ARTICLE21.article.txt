# Catastrophe in Corvallis knocks hoops to No. 17

CORVALLIS, Ore. - If you'd
asked No. 15 Stanford before the
start of Pacific 10 Conference
play what its record would look
like after six games, 4-2 would
have been a reasonably opti
mistic response.
Considering the Cardinal
has already played games at
two of the Pac-10's most intim
idating road venues — Ari
zona's McKale Center and Ore
gon's McArthur Court — and a
home game against preseason
conference favorite UCLA, it
should be pleased to return
home from Oregon this week
with a 4-2 mark, good for a sec
ond-place tie in the Pac-10.
Right?
Well, not exactly. Rather than
patting itself on the back this
week, Stanford is busy trying to
erase from its collective memory
the bad dream that was Satur
day night's 86-77 loss to Oregon
State.
The nightmare was all too
real for the Cardinal, whose
climb to the pinnacle of the Pac
-10 hit an ugly and unexpected
snag at Gill Coliseum in Corval
lis, Ore., just two nights after
displaying remarkable poise in a
hard-fought, come-from-behind
overtime win at Oregon. Rather
than lay down and play confer
ence doormat against one of the
Pac-10's most talented teams,
the Beavers instead served Stan
ford a not-so-gentle reminder
that you can't take anything for
granted in this topsy-turvy
league.
"It's just really disappoint
ing," said head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We had a
tremendous opportunity to get
up on top of this league with a
road win, and we just didn't
have anybody play well."
As Montgomery and the Car
dinal are painfully aware, a win
over Oregon State — losers of
five straight before Saturday
and by general consensus the
conference's worst team —

USC earlier this month. Men's basketball faced a disappointing
and unexpected loss to Oregon State on Saturday. 86-77.
