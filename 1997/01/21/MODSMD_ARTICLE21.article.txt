# Catastrophe in Corvallis knocks hoops to No. 17
## 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
CORVALLIS, Ore. - If you'd
asked No. 15 Stanford before the
start of Pacific 10 Conference
play what its record would look
like after six games, 4-2 would
have been a reasonably opti
mistic response.
Considering the Cardinal
has already played games at
two of the Pac-10's most intim
idating road venues — Ari
zona's McKale Center and Ore
gon's McArthur Court — and a
home game against preseason
conference favorite UCLA, it
should be pleased to return
home from Oregon this week
with a 4-2 mark, good for a sec
ond-place tie in the Pac-10.
Right?
Well, not exactly. Rather than
patting itself on the back this
week, Stanford is busy trying to
erase from its collective memory
the bad dream that was Satur
day night's 86-77 loss to Oregon
State.
The nightmare was all too
real for the Cardinal, whose
climb to the pinnacle of the Pac
-10 hit an ugly and unexpected
snag at Gill Coliseum in Corval
lis, Ore., just two nights after
displaying remarkable poise in a
hard-fought, come-from-behind
overtime win at Oregon. Rather
than lay down and play confer
ence doormat against one of the
Pac-10's most talented teams,
the Beavers instead served Stan
ford a not-so-gentle reminder
that you can't take anything for
granted in this topsy-turvy
league.
"It's just really disappoint
ing," said head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We had a
tremendous opportunity to get
up on top of this league with a
road win, and we just didn't
have anybody play well."
As Montgomery and the Car
dinal are painfully aware, a win
over Oregon State — losers of
five straight before Saturday
and by general consensus the
conference's worst team —

would have earned Stanford a 5-1
record and a share of the confer
ence lead. Instead, Stanford drops
to 4-2 (11-3 overall) and into a sec
ond-place tie with USC, while the
Beavers improve to 1-4 (5-9 over
all). That leaves unranked UCLA,
an 84-78 overtime winner over
No. 8 Arizona on Saturday, as the
conference leader with a 5-1
record.
"This is a game we had to
have," said sophomore center Tim
Young in a solemn postgame lock
er room. "With UCLA beating Ari
zona, we definitely had the oppor
tunity to step up into the upper
echelon of the league, and we just
blew this opportunity."
Oregon State's defense contin
ually collapsed down on Young on
Saturday, harassing him into six
turnovers, 2-of-4 shooting and
just five rebounds — in all, a far
cry from Young's 20-point, 21-
rebound performance against
Oregon.
"I didn't make good decisions
with the ball," Young said. "I had
way too many turnovers. In a
defense like that, it's my job to
find the open man, kick it out for
the three-point shot, and I just
could not do that at all."
And on this night, Stanford's
outside shooting wasn't there to
compensate. The Cardinal led 39-
34 at halftime but shot a miserable
29 percent from the floor in the
second half, and Stanford was
outscored 52-38. The Cardinal was
also forced into a school-record 34
three-point attempts, of which
only 11 connected
Add to that mix a 52-percent
shooting performance by Oregon
State, including 56 percent from
three-point range, and you've got
all the ingredients for an upset.
"We got what we deserved,"
Montgomery said. "The ball's not
going down, you're not playing
very smart, you can't defend — it
makes for a game like this.
"We just didn't do anything
very well. Oregon State played
smart, and we didn't play very
smart. We had no advantage at
any particular place on the floor.''
That was particularly true in a
seesaw second half that saw the
lead change hands nine times.
Every time the Cardinal seemed
poised to take control, Oregon
State would respond with timely
shooting. And more often than
not. it was Beaver freshman phe
nom Corey Benjamin, who racked
up 18 of his game-high 26 points
after halftime and earned Pac-10
player of the week honors, doing
the damage.
Nonetheless, Stanford was still
clinging to a 65-64 lead with 6
minutes, 3 seconds remaining in
the game, when a 10-2 Oregon
State run, highlighted by a high

flying, rim-rattling Benjamin
dunk, put the Beavers ahead 74-
67 with 1:34 to go. At that point,
the Cardinal got flustered, miss
ing crucial free throws and open
three-pointers down the stretch.
And with Oregon State freshman
point guard Carson Cunningham
hitting several clutch free throws
— he collected 14 of his 18 points
at the line — Stanford didn't get
any closer than four.
"We got frustrated, we started
reaching, putting people at the
foul line, allowed them to get a
lead," Montgomery said. "We got
a couple of opportunities at the
end of the game where ... we had
easy shots, we missed, put them
back at the line — next thing you
know, we don't have a chance to
win."
Senior point guard Brevin
Knight finished with 16 points
and eight assists for the Cardinal
but was bothered by a hip pointer
that gave him a visible limp for
much of the game. Sophomore
forward Peter Sauer also pitched
in with 15 points and a career
high nine rebounds.
But it wasn't enough against a
team playing more like one of the
conference's best teams than one
of its worst.
"I don't know," Young said, "1
really don't know what happened
Part of being a good basketball
team, of being a mature basketball
team, is ... taking one game at 8
time and just focusing on the jofc
at hand, and we didn't do that '

did," summed up Knight. "Thev

-10 hit an ugly and unexpected
snag at Gill Coliseum in Corval
lis, Ore., just two nights after
displaying remarkable poise in a
hard-fought, come-from-behind
overtime win at Oregon. Rather
than lay down and play confer
ence doormat against one of the
Pac-10's most talented teams,
the Beavers instead served Stan
ford a not-so-gentle reminder
that you can't take anything for
granted in this topsy-turvy
league.
"It's just really disappoint
ing," said head coach Mike
Montgomery. "We had a
tremendous opportunity to get
up on top of this league with a
road win, and we just didn't
have anybody play well."
As Montgomery and the Car
dinal are painfully aware, a win
over Oregon State — losers of
five straight before Saturday
and by general consensus the
conference's worst team —

USC earlier this month. Men's basketball faced a disappointing
and unexpected loss to Oregon State on Saturday. 86-77.
would have earned Stanford a 5-1
record and a share of the confer
ence lead. Instead, Stanford drops
to 4-2 (11-3 overall) and into a sec
ond-place tie with USC, while the
Beavers improve to 1-4 (5-9 over
all). That leaves unranked UCLA,
an 84-78 overtime winner over
No. 8 Arizona on Saturday, as the
conference leader with a 5-1
record.
"This is a game we had to
have," said sophomore center Tim
Young in a solemn postgame lock
er room. "With UCLA beating Ari
zona, we definitely had the oppor
tunity to step up into the upper
echelon of the league, and we just
blew this opportunity."
Oregon State's defense contin
ually collapsed down on Young on
Saturday, harassing him into six
turnovers, 2-of-4 shooting and
just five rebounds — in all, a far
cry from Young's 20-point, 21-
rebound performance against
Oregon.
"I didn't make good decisions
with the ball," Young said. "I had
way too many turnovers. In a
defense like that, it's my job to
find the open man, kick it out for
the three-point shot, and I just
could not do that at all."
And on this night, Stanford's
outside shooting wasn't there to
compensate. The Cardinal led 39-
34 at halftime but shot a miserable
29 percent from the floor in the
second half, and Stanford was
outscored 52-38. The Cardinal was
also forced into a school-record 34
three-point attempts, of which
only 11 connected
Add to that mix a 52-percent
shooting performance by Oregon
State, including 56 percent from
three-point range, and you've got
all the ingredients for an upset.
"We got what we deserved,"
Montgomery said. "The ball's not
going down, you're not playing
very smart, you can't defend — it
makes for a game like this.
"We just didn't do anything
very well. Oregon State played
smart, and we didn't play very
smart. We had no advantage at
any particular place on the floor.''
That was particularly true in a
seesaw second half that saw the
lead change hands nine times.
Every time the Cardinal seemed
poised to take control, Oregon
State would respond with timely
shooting. And more often than
not. it was Beaver freshman phe
nom Corey Benjamin, who racked
up 18 of his game-high 26 points
after halftime and earned Pac-10
player of the week honors, doing
the damage.
Nonetheless, Stanford was still
clinging to a 65-64 lead with 6
minutes, 3 seconds remaining in
the game, when a 10-2 Oregon
State run, highlighted by a high

flying, rim-rattling Benjamin
dunk, put the Beavers ahead 74-
67 with 1:34 to go. At that point,
the Cardinal got flustered, miss
ing crucial free throws and open
three-pointers down the stretch.
And with Oregon State freshman
point guard Carson Cunningham
hitting several clutch free throws
— he collected 14 of his 18 points
at the line — Stanford didn't get
any closer than four.
"We got frustrated, we started
reaching, putting people at the
foul line, allowed them to get a
lead," Montgomery said. "We got
a couple of opportunities at the
end of the game where ... we had
easy shots, we missed, put them
back at the line — next thing you
know, we don't have a chance to
win."
Senior point guard Brevin
Knight finished with 16 points
and eight assists for the Cardinal
but was bothered by a hip pointer
that gave him a visible limp for
much of the game. Sophomore
forward Peter Sauer also pitched
in with 15 points and a career
high nine rebounds.
But it wasn't enough against a
team playing more like one of the
conference's best teams than one
of its worst.
"I don't know," Young said, "1
really don't know what happened
Part of being a good basketball
team, of being a mature basketball
team, is ... taking one game at 8
time and just focusing on the jofc
at hand, and we didn't do that '

did," summed up Knight. "Thev

CORVALLIS, Ore. - If you'd
asked No. 15 Stanford before the
start of Pacific 10 Conference
play what its record would look
like after six games, 4-2 would
have been a reasonably opti
mistic response.
Considering the Cardinal
has already played games at
two of the Pac-10's most intim
idating road venues — Ari
zona's McKale Center and Ore
gon's McArthur Court — and a
home game against preseason
conference favorite UCLA, it
should be pleased to return
home from Oregon this week
with a 4-2 mark, good for a sec
ond-place tie in the Pac-10.
Right?
Well, not exactly. Rather than
patting itself on the back this
week, Stanford is busy trying to
erase from its collective memory
the bad dream that was Satur
day night's 86-77 loss to Oregon
State.
The nightmare was all too
real for the Cardinal, whose
climb to the pinnacle of the Pac
-10 hit an ugly and unexpected
snag at Gill Coliseum in Corval
