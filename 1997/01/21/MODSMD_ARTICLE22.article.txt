# Swimmers lasso Longhorns
## Men follow win in Austin with second in Dallas 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
In a pivotal week of competi
tion, the top-ranked Stanford
men's swim team sent a message
to the rest of the NCAA as it beat
defending champion Texas in a
dual meet and placed second at the
Dallas Morning News Invitational.
The dual meet with Texas,
which took place in Austin on
Thursday, was an impressive per
formance for the Cardinal, which
won six of 13 events in Texas'
home pool.

Junior Tom Wilkens won two
events, the 200-yard individual
medley (1:50.61) and the 200-yard
breaststroke (2:01.5) to lead the
Stanford victory. Also winning
individual events for the Cardinal
were senior Kevin Radvany in the
1,000-yard freestyle (9:08.49),
sophomore Matt Pierce in the
200-yard butterfly (1:48.58) and
sophomore Matt O'Mara in the
500-yard freestyle (4:29.59). The
Stanford A 400-yard freestyle
relay of sophomore Dod Wales,
freshman Glenn Counts, and
juniors Sabir Muhammad and

Scott Glaypool also won over
Texas' A team in 3:00.45.
While the event winners for
Stanford helped spark the team's
momentum, it was the Cardinal's
depth that kept Texas from gain
ing much ground in the seven
events the team won. Almost
every time Texas won an event,
Stanford swimmers took second
and third, thus significantly
reducing the point swing that
favored Texas. This type of depth
has helned Stanford all season and
should be a great asset to the team
as the season continues.
After its 132-109 victory over
the third-ranked Texas team,
Stanford held on to its No. 1 rank
ing and sent a squad of nine to the
15th annual Dallas Morning News
Invitational, hosted by Southern
Methodist. The meet is a yearly
showcase of talent to which the top
six teams in the country are
allowed to bring eight swimmers

and one diver.
Stanford's squad of Wales,
Wilkens, Pierce, Muhammad,
Counts, Claypool, Radvany,
sophomore Tate Blahnik and
freshman diver Mark Michelin
placed second at the invitational
behind Tennessee. Placing third
was Michigan, who Stanford beat
in a dual meet two weeks ago, fol
lowed by Texas, SMU and Auburn.
Wilkens was again Stanford's
highest point-scorer, as he won
both the 200- and 400-yard indi
vidual medley races in 1:49.88 and
3:53.25, respectively. Wilkens also
added a second-place finish in the

200-yard breaststroke, finishing
just behind Tennessee junior
Jeremy Linn, a 1996 U.S.
Olympian.
Stanford's second-place finish
at the Dallas Morning News meet
was especially impressive since the
abbreviated format of the meet
favored teams with a few fast
swimmers, not teams like Stan
ford with a lot of depth. The dis
tance events — the 1,000- and
1,650-yard freestyle — were left
out of the meet. These are events
in which Stanford's Radvany has
been dominating his opponents all
season. The fact that each team

was only allowed eight swimmers
also robbed Stanford of its incredi
bly deep "bench points," as sopho
more Pierce said.
"I think that if we'd brought
our next eight swimmers instead
of the fastest eight we sent to Dal
las, we could have scored a similar
number of points," Pierce said.
"That's the kind of depth we have
that will really show up at
NCAAs."
The Stanford squad will have a
few days off to train before travel
ing to swim at Arizona and Ari
zona State on Friday and Satur
day, respectively.
