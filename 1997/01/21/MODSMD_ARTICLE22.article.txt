In a pivotal week of competi
tion, the top-ranked Stanford
men's swim team sent a message
to the rest of the NCAA as it beat
defending champion Texas in a
dual meet and placed second at the
Dallas Morning News Invitational.
The dual meet with Texas,
which took place in Austin on
Thursday, was an impressive per

won six of 13 events in Texas'
home pool.

Junior Tom Wilkens won two
events, the 200-yard individual
medley (1:50.61) and the 200-yard
breaststroke (2:01.5) to lead the
Stanford victory. Also winning
individual events for the Cardinal
were senior Kevin Radvany in the
1,000-yard freestyle (9:08.49),
sophomore Matt Pierce in the
200-yard butterfly (1:48.58) and
sophomore Matt O'Mara in the
500-yard freestyle (4:29.59). The
Stanford A 400-yard freestyle
relay of sophomore Dod Wales,
freshman Glenn Counts, and
juniors Sabir Muhammad and

Scott Glaypool also won over
Texas' A team in 3:00.45.
While the event winners for
Stanford helped spark the team's
momentum, it was the Cardinal's
depth that kept Texas from gain

events the team won. Almost
every time Texas won an event,
Stanford swimmers took second
and third, thus significantly
reducing the point swing that
favored Texas. This type of depth
has helned Stanford all season and
