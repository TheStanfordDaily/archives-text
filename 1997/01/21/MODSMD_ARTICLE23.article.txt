# Schlukebir, Ashley clean house at Pac-10 Indoors
## Singles winners also take doubles title, De Silva falls to teammate in final 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Senior Katie Schlukebir and freshman
Teryn Ashley combined for three titles as the
Stanford women's tennis squad collected
four championships in all at the Pacific 10
Conference Indoor Championships this
weekend at Washington.
Schlukebir and Ashley each won their sin
gles brackets in Flight 1 and Flight 3. respec
tively, while also pairing up to win the Flight
2 doubles title.
Stanford could have potentially won two
other titles in Seattle, but Cardinal doubles
teams lost in both the Flight 1 and Flight 2
doubles brackets.
Stanford junior All-American Ania
Bleszynski earned a fourth victory for the
Cardinal, bouncing back from a first-round
loss to take the Flight 2 singles consolation
final.
Third-seeded Schlukebir, already a win
ner this season with singles and doubles vic
tories at Rolex Regionals in November,
advanced to the finals by downing in straight
sets USC's Ditta Huber, UCLA's Elizabeth
Schmidt and last season's NCAA singles run
ner-up, junior Vicky Maes from Arizona.
Schlukebir met a familiar foe in the finals,
teammate Sandra De Silva. The fourth-seed
ed Cardinal senior notched wins over Ari
zona's Karen Goldstein, Washington's
Katherine Cos tain and UCLA's Katl Kocsis,
the tournament's top seed. But Schlukebir
was too much for De Silva in the all-Cardinal
final, taking the title in straight sets, 6-2,6-2.

"I was just really confident all weekend,"
Schlukebir said. "I haven't played a tourna
ment since the Rolex, and I was just very
eager to p»ay. I was having a lot of fun and I
played really well."
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan
praised the play of his seniors.
"Sandra played very good tennis up until
the final, and I think she was flat against her
teammate and classmate," Brennan said.
"But those things happen. Katie was great all
the way through; she was dominant. Any
time you beat [Vicky] Maes, you get my
attention."
Ashley, a freshman out of Chestnut Hill,
Mass., gave the Pac-10 something to worry
about in cruising to her first collegiate victo
ry in the Flight 3 singles bracket. The top
seed breezed through the draw, winning four
matches in straight sets. California's Emeka
Mayes, the No. 2 seed, was no match for Ash
ley in the final, 6-4, 6-4.
Stanford freshman Jennifer Heiser also
represented the Cardinal in the Flight 3
singles bracket. Heiser earned a first
round win over Arizona State's Anna Moll
but met elimination in the quarterfinals by
losing to Arizona's Anne Laurence Bilenne
3-6, 6-2, 6-2.
"One of the highlights was Jenn Heiser,"
Brennan said. "She beat (Moll], the No. 5 girl
from ASU, so that sort of validates her."
Schlukebir and Ashley didn't stop with
singles triumphs, however. Teaming up as
