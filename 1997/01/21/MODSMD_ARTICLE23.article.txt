# Schlukebir, Ashley clean house at Pac-10 Indoors
## Singles winners also take doubles title, De Silva falls to teammate in final 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Senior Katie Schlukebir and freshman
Teryn Ashley combined for three titles as the
Stanford women's tennis squad collected
four championships in all at the Pacific 10
Conference Indoor Championships this
weekend at Washington.
Schlukebir and Ashley each won their sin
gles brackets in Flight 1 and Flight 3. respec
tively, while also pairing up to win the Flight
2 doubles title.
Stanford could have potentially won two
other titles in Seattle, but Cardinal doubles
teams lost in both the Flight 1 and Flight 2
doubles brackets.
Stanford junior All-American Ania
Bleszynski earned a fourth victory for the
Cardinal, bouncing back from a first-round
loss to take the Flight 2 singles consolation
final.
Third-seeded Schlukebir, already a win
ner this season with singles and doubles vic
tories at Rolex Regionals in November,
advanced to the finals by downing in straight
sets USC's Ditta Huber, UCLA's Elizabeth
Schmidt and last season's NCAA singles run
ner-up, junior Vicky Maes from Arizona.
Schlukebir met a familiar foe in the finals,
teammate Sandra De Silva. The fourth-seed
ed Cardinal senior notched wins over Ari
zona's Karen Goldstein, Washington's
Katherine Cos tain and UCLA's Katl Kocsis,
the tournament's top seed. But Schlukebir
was too much for De Silva in the all-Cardinal
final, taking the title in straight sets, 6-2,6-2.

"I was just really confident all weekend,"
Schlukebir said. "I haven't played a tourna
ment since the Rolex, and I was just very
eager to p»ay. I was having a lot of fun and I
played really well."
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan
praised the play of his seniors.
"Sandra played very good tennis up until
the final, and I think she was flat against her
teammate and classmate," Brennan said.
"But those things happen. Katie was great all
the way through; she was dominant. Any
time you beat [Vicky] Maes, you get my
attention."
Ashley, a freshman out of Chestnut Hill,
Mass., gave the Pac-10 something to worry
about in cruising to her first collegiate victo
ry in the Flight 3 singles bracket. The top
seed breezed through the draw, winning four
matches in straight sets. California's Emeka
Mayes, the No. 2 seed, was no match for Ash
ley in the final, 6-4, 6-4.
Stanford freshman Jennifer Heiser also
represented the Cardinal in the Flight 3
singles bracket. Heiser earned a first
round win over Arizona State's Anna Moll
but met elimination in the quarterfinals by
losing to Arizona's Anne Laurence Bilenne
3-6, 6-2, 6-2.
"One of the highlights was Jenn Heiser,"
Brennan said. "She beat (Moll], the No. 5 girl
from ASU, so that sort of validates her."
Schlukebir and Ashley didn't stop with
singles triumphs, however. Teaming up as
the No. 2 in tho Fliirht 9 HnuHlnc Hrnu;

showing In Seattle in the Pac-10 Indoor Championships.
the duo earned a third Cardinal
title by defeating Cal's Francesca
La'O and Ester Knox 6-1, 4-6, 6-2.
The Cardinal tandem also downed
representatives from Oregon and
Arizona State en route to the
final.
"Katie certainly solidified her
self as one of the best doubles play
ers in the country, and Teryn
showed that she is a good doubles
player, not just a pretty good one,"
Brennan said.
Stanford narrowly missed wins
in the other doubles brackets as
well. Bleszynski and junior Julie
Scott, the No. 2 seed in Flight 1
doubles, dropped a 7-5, 6-2 final to
Cal's Amanda Augustus and Claire
Curran after fighting through two
three-set wins on their way to the
title match.
Similarly, another Stanford No.
2 doubles seed, junior Emily Burt
and freshman Jennifer Heiser, fell

in the finals of the Flight 3 doubles
championship to a Golden Bears
team. Cal's Mayes and Lisa Swier
niak got the best of Burt and Heis
er 7-5, 6-4. Burt and Heiser did
notch victories over intrastate
rivals USC and UCLA before los
ing in the title match.
"Doubles got a little bit ugly,"
Brennan said. "We lost to some
Cal teams which you never like to
do. I don't know if we were flat or
what. We had a lot of people in the
singles finals earlier in the day and
they all did pretty well. Maybe
they were flat. We certainly
weren't great."
With both the No. 1 and No. 2
seed in the Flight 2 singles draw,
the Cardinal did not enjoy as much
success as expected. Second-seeded
Scott advanced to the semifinals
with impressive straight-set wins
over Arizona State's Katy Propstra
and Arizona's Khristen Pietrucha
before meeting elimination in the
form of UCI.A's Annica Cooper 6-
4, 0-6, 6-4.
Bleszynski, on the other hand,
experienced the top-seed jinx as

she was shocked in the opening
round by UCLA's Kelly Rudolph in
straight sets 6-2, 6-2. Rudolph and
Cooper went on to play in the
flight's title round.
"Ania is definitely improving,"
Brennan said. "She really is a bet
ter player than she was last year.
She just hasn't gotten it together
mentally yet this year. But she's
really doing things better. I was
proud of her the way she came
back and won the back draw."
After losing, Bleszynski got
some extra matches in the consola
tion draw. The Cardinal All-Amer
ican made the most of those oppor
tunities, sweeping three matches
over Washington State's Helen
Frankland, USC's Nicole London
and Propstra.
"You always would like to see
them meet in the finals, but this
isn't Camelot," Brennan said of his
top-seeded juniors. "I was sorry
that Ania got upset, but she didn't
cave in. She's showed some charac
ter. And Julie played very well; she
just lost to a good girl."
The two wins for Schlukebir

wound up a highly successful pre
season for the Cardinal All-Ameri
can. After winning both singles
and doubles at the Rolex Regionals,
the senior added two more titles to
her resume this weekend.
"It's just a confidence booster,"
Schlukebir said. "You obviously
want to be playing your best tennis
in May, not necessarily now. But
it's a good feeling to come away
with some solid wins in the begin
ning and see what we can do with
them."
Brennan was pleased with the
flighted format of the tournament.
"These flighted' tournaments
are always quite nice because at
some other tournament, your No.
6 girl plays the No. 1 girl from Ari
zona and loses," he said. "You
don't get anything from that. Here
you get an idea what your No. 5
and No. 6 players can do against
people they will be playing in dual
matches."
Freshman Lilia Osterloh and
Anne Kremer, recently back from
the Australia Open, did not make
the trip for the Cardinal.

final, taking the title in straight sets, 6-2,6-2.

"I was just really confident all weekend,"
Schlukebir said. "I haven't played a tourna
ment since the Rolex, and I was just very
eager to p»ay. I was having a lot of fun and I
played really well."
Stanford head coach Frank Brennan
praised the play of his seniors.
"Sandra played very good tennis up until
the final, and I think she was flat against her
teammate and classmate," Brennan said.
"But those things happen. Katie was great all
the way through; she was dominant. Any
time you beat [Vicky] Maes, you get my
attention."
Ashley, a freshman out of Chestnut Hill,
Mass., gave the Pac-10 something to worry
about in cruising to her first collegiate victo
ry in the Flight 3 singles bracket. The top
seed breezed through the draw, winning four
matches in straight sets. California's Emeka
Mayes, the No. 2 seed, was no match for Ash
ley in the final, 6-4, 6-4.
Stanford freshman Jennifer Heiser also
represented the Cardinal in the Flight 3
singles bracket. Heiser earned a first
round win over Arizona State's Anna Moll
but met elimination in the quarterfinals by
losing to Arizona's Anne Laurence Bilenne
3-6, 6-2, 6-2.
"One of the highlights was Jenn Heiser,"
Brennan said. "She beat (Moll], the No. 5 girl
from ASU, so that sort of validates her."

singles triumphs, however. Teaming up as

showing In Seattle in the Pac-10 Indoor Championships.
the duo earned a third Cardinal
title by defeating Cal's Francesca
La'O and Ester Knox 6-1, 4-6, 6-2.
The Cardinal tandem also downed
representatives from Oregon and
Arizona State en route to the
final.
"Katie certainly solidified her
self as one of the best doubles play
ers in the country, and Teryn
showed that she is a good doubles
player, not just a pretty good one,"
Brennan said.
Stanford narrowly missed wins
in the other doubles brackets as
well. Bleszynski and junior Julie
Scott, the No. 2 seed in Flight 1
doubles, dropped a 7-5, 6-2 final to
Cal's Amanda Augustus and Claire
Curran after fighting through two
three-set wins on their way to the
title match.
Similarly, another Stanford No.
2 doubles seed, junior Emily Burt
and freshman Jennifer Heiser, fell

in the finals of the Flight 3 doubles
championship to a Golden Bears
team. Cal's Mayes and Lisa Swier
niak got the best of Burt and Heis
er 7-5, 6-4. Burt and Heiser did
notch victories over intrastate
rivals USC and UCLA before los
ing in the title match.
"Doubles got a little bit ugly,"
Brennan said. "We lost to some
Cal teams which you never like to
do. I don't know if we were flat or
what. We had a lot of people in the
singles finals earlier in the day and
they all did pretty well. Maybe
they were flat. We certainly
weren't great."
With both the No. 1 and No. 2
seed in the Flight 2 singles draw,
the Cardinal did not enjoy as much
success as expected. Second-seeded
Scott advanced to the semifinals
with impressive straight-set wins
over Arizona State's Katy Propstra
and Arizona's Khristen Pietrucha
before meeting elimination in the
form of UCI.A's Annica Cooper 6-
4, 0-6, 6-4.
Bleszynski, on the other hand,
experienced the top-seed jinx as

she was shocked in the opening
round by UCLA's Kelly Rudolph in
straight sets 6-2, 6-2. Rudolph and
Cooper went on to play in the
flight's title round.
"Ania is definitely improving,"
Brennan said. "She really is a bet
ter player than she was last year.
She just hasn't gotten it together
mentally yet this year. But she's
really doing things better. I was
proud of her the way she came
back and won the back draw."
After losing, Bleszynski got
some extra matches in the consola
tion draw. The Cardinal All-Amer
ican made the most of those oppor
tunities, sweeping three matches
over Washington State's Helen
Frankland, USC's Nicole London
and Propstra.
"You always would like to see
them meet in the finals, but this
isn't Camelot," Brennan said of his
top-seeded juniors. "I was sorry
that Ania got upset, but she didn't
cave in. She's showed some charac
ter. And Julie played very well; she
just lost to a good girl."
The two wins for Schlukebir

wound up a highly successful pre
season for the Cardinal All-Ameri
can. After winning both singles
and doubles at the Rolex Regionals,
the senior added two more titles to
her resume this weekend.
"It's just a confidence booster,"
Schlukebir said. "You obviously
want to be playing your best tennis
in May, not necessarily now. But
it's a good feeling to come away
with some solid wins in the begin
ning and see what we can do with
them."
Brennan was pleased with the
flighted format of the tournament.
"These flighted' tournaments
are always quite nice because at
some other tournament, your No.
6 girl plays the No. 1 girl from Ari
zona and loses," he said. "You
don't get anything from that. Here
you get an idea what your No. 5
and No. 6 players can do against
people they will be playing in dual
matches."
Freshman Lilia Osterloh and
Anne Kremer, recently back from
the Australia Open, did not make
the trip for the Cardinal.
