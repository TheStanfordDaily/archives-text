# Bears outscore men gymnasts
## 
### Alda Leu Staff writer 
An injury-laden Stanford
men's gymnastics team found
itself outscored by California
228.15-218.65 in its first out
ing at the Spartan Open over
the weekend.
The loss came as no sur
prise to the gymnasts, who
remain optimistic about
improving and recovering by
the NCAA finals. Several team
members competed with
injuries, while some sat out
the meet.
Senior Jamie Ellis contin
ues to recover from shoulder
surgery. But Ellis competed in
all six events, pleasantly sur
prising head coach Sadao
Hamada.
Redshirt freshman David
Ludlow and freshman Craig
Nesbitt watched from the side
lines, whereas redshirt sopho
more Jeremy Herman and
senior lan Bachrach saw only
limited action.
Despite the setbacks, the
Cardinal performed well, post
ing decent scores and adjust
ing to the new scoring system.
In a meet where the prima
ry objective for some was not
to aggravate injuries, senior
Keith Wiley stood out with a
great overall performance.
Wiley placed second in the all
around and took first place on
the vault and pommel horse in
event finals.
"Individually, (Wiley] was
definitely the highlight of the
competition," Hamada said.
"He was excellent, he compet
ed well, and he looked sharp."
Wiley's all-around score of
57.1 was 0.15 behind former
Ukrainian Olympian and cur
rent Cal student Oleg Kosyak.
Wiley posted a 9.7 on both the
vault and pommel horse.
"I have basically had to add
difficulty on every event,"

Wiley said about the new scor
ing. "This new code of points
has changed four times since
this summer, so it's kind of
hard to follow."
Bachrach also added a high
light to the weekend by win
ning the high-bar finals.
Bachrach tied with Cal's David
Kruse for first place with a
9.65 on the event.
Freshman Jason Katsam
pes also made good on his first
outing by scoring a 9.5 on floor
and 9.55 on vault.
"I was pretty pleased with
my performance, especially my
first time out," Katsampes
said. "I was just really excited
to be in a team environment."
Katsampes competed with a
shouler injury which he esti
mated would be better in a
week.
The injury problems and
stiff compotition from Cal do
not particularly trouble the
team's coach, who enjoys the
psychological pressure of
being the underdog.
"Next week I want to close
the gap 3-4 points and do that
each time and keep up the psy
chological pressure," Hamada
said. Cal is "definitely good,
but my guys are more disci
plined in practice and competi
tion — my guys compete bet
ter."
In general, the weekend's
competition provided valuable
experience for the team.
"It was a very important
meet just for us to see where
we are right now," said Wiley,
who also acts as team co-cap
tain. "This next month will be
really important because the
people that did not compete or
were slightly injured will be
key players, and they need to
get in shape this month to
make a differnce when NCAAs
come around. NCAAs are two
weeks earlier this year, and we
don't have as much time."
