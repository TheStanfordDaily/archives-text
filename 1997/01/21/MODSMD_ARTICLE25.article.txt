# Top-ranked tennis spoils Lobo party
## 
### Hillary Stamm Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
team did not have an easy task
for its first dual match of the sea
son. Playing in New Mexico in a
new, crowded stadium at 5,000-
plus feet with more than 1,000
Lobos fans, poor lighting and
high-altitude balls may not be
the ideal way for a young Cardi
nal squad to kick off the 1997
season.
Yet the young, talented Cardi
nal, ranked No. 1 going into the
season, proved it is going to be a
tough team to beat this year no
matter what the conditions, as
Stanford ousted New Mexico 7-0.
"The conditions were pretty
challenging for our young team,"
said head coach Dick Gould. "The
lighting, the altitude, the packed
stadium gave us every opportuni
ty to crack a little bit. But the
team did a resounding job under
the conditions."
Sophomore and No. 1 player
Ryan Wo Iters agreed it was a per
fect way to start the season.
"It was a little tough because it
was a new team, and we were not
playing at home, did not have the
crowd behind us," he said. "But
everything worked out perfectly."
The Cardinal displayed that
difficult conditions do not alter
its play as team members swept
the doubles. The No. 1 team of
sophomore Ryan Wolters and
junior Paul Goldstein defeated
Javier Gutierrez and Jeff
Williams easily. The freshman
Bryan brothers defeated Pepe
Caballero and Pablo Fernandez.
The senior / freshman duo of
Elliott and Abrams finished off
the doubles with a solid 8-2 win.
Elliott and Abrams displayed an
impressive win considering the
little playing time they have had
together.
"Geoff and Grant took charge
and jumped to a big lead in the
start," Gould said.
"The doubles went well,"
Wolters said. "Paul and I played
together some over this summer.
Bob and Mike (Bryan) have
played together their whole lives.
Grant and Geoff did really well,
as they have not played much
together. It was nice to come up
with three solid wins."
The Cardinal kept on winning
as it moved into singles, sweeping
all six spots in straight sets.
Wolters dropped only one game
as he defeated Gutierrez 6-1, 6-0.
At No. 2, junior Paul Goldstein

defeated Caballero 6-2, 6-3. In his
first dual match of his career,
freshman Bob Bryan took Jeff
Williams in straight sets as well,
6-2, 6-3.
"We were a little nervous, being
a young team and all," Bob Bryan
said. "We were a little nervous to
play at New Mexico, with the high
altitude and all, but Coach tried to
keep us really focused. It is a great
way to start the season for our
new young team."

Bryan's twin brother Mike, in
his first match since the U.S.
Open in September, posted an
impressive 6-3, 6-3 win against
Pablo Fernandez at the No. 4 sin
gles spot. Rounding out the sweep
of the Lobos, senior Grant Elliott
won his match 6-0, 6-1 and fresh
man Geoff Abrams came out
ahead 6-3, 6-4.
"What impressed me the most
was that the conditions were
challenging, but at no point did

anyone make an exclamation,"
Gould said of his players. "No one
looked at the balls because they
were different or glared at the
poor lighting. I was extremely
pleased at our focus and competi
tiveness. This is a good chance to
really have the momentum going
into our next match."
The Cardinal will return to
the Farm for its home opener
Feb. 4 against Fresno State at
1:30 p.m.
