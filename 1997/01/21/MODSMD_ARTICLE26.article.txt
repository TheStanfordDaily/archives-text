### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
W. David Rozkuszka, a Stanford librarian
who built an exemplary collection of interna
tional government documents, died Jan. 10 at
the age of 53. His death was attributed to AlDS
related lymphoma.
Rozkuszka was born on Aug. 21, 1943, in
Ludlow, Mass. He earned a bachelor's degree
from Loyola University in Chicago in 1965 and
a master's degree in library science from Syra
cuse University in 1967. He then came to Stan
ford and worked as a librarian until his retire
ment in February 1994, due to problems associ
ated with the HIV infection.
Colleagues and friends of Rozkuszka re
member him as a caring and intelligent librari
an who understood the importance of library
resources.
"David brought great color," said Ann Latta,
assistant head librarian of University Li

braries. "He filled the room. He had incredible
dedication to Stanford faculty and students
within the libraries."
Latta also noted the professional qualities of
Rozkuszka.
"He understood research and the use of pri
mary sources. He understood how foreign gov
ernments publish."
History Prof. Peter Stansky, who worked
closely with Rozkuszka in developing "the best
collection of British government documents in
this country," also remembered his warm per
sonality.
"He was very funny, outgoing and outreach
ing," Stansky said. "He was dedicated to helping
individuals. He urged students to come to him."
As the international documents librarian at
Stanford, Rozkuszka collected many foreign
government documents. He most recently
served as the African and Middle Eastern bibli
ographer.
Latta described the collection of foreign doc

uments as one of the finest in the United States.
"His greatest accomplishment was building
the collections and making them accessible to
students and faculty," Latta said.
Rozkuszka also instructed various students
on many issues related to the libraries' collec
tions.
"He conducted innumerable classes," said
Latta. "He was trying to educate students on
how governments publish."
In his dealings with various foreign govern
ment agencies, Rozkuszka gained an interna
tional reputation. Latta noted that condolences
had been received from civil servants around
the world.
Rozkuszka is survived by his mother, Rose
Rozkuszka of San Antonio, and his two sisters,
Joan O'Brien of San Antonio and Marie Bryan
of Lake Worth, Fla.
Memorial services will be held at 11 a.m. on
Feb. 8 in the Chapel of Grace at Grace Cathe
dral in San Francisco.
