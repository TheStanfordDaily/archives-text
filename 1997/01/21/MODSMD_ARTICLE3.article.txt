# Students launch online job search
## 
### Auren Kule 
The prospect of finding a job after gradua
tion is a growing concern for college students.
But a new service on the World Wide Web could
make it easier.
Seniors Roberto Angulo and Ana Bertran
Ortiz meshed newspaper "help wanted" ads
with cyberspace to create The Job Resource, an

online recruiting service.
Available on the World Wide Web at
http://solimar.stanford.edu, The Job Resource
allows students seeking employment to post
their resumes online and gives businesses a
forum to obtain them.
Users can either post a job listing or respond
to one. Companies looking for prospective em
ployees can search through the database, limit

ing their query by criteria such as major, high
est degree obtained, language and willingness
to travel.
The service eliminates many of the time-con
suming tasks that job-seekers encounter, its cre
ators said. Users can enter their resumes direct
ly on the site, and the administrators will auto-
matically format it to be seen on a
Web page.
In addition, when a company
has read the resume of a prospec
tive employee and is interested in
hiring him or her, the Job Resource
provides e-mail notification.

The service began in September
as a hobby where, Angulo said,
"Students could easily put re
sumes on the Web." The service
originally received resumes from
Stanford students but now has
gained global attention.
In September, about three re
sumes were posted each day, but
currently that number is closer to
17 daily. Around 10 percent of stu
dents who posted resumes on the

service received requests from
companies including Microsoft
Corp. and Veriphone.
With the increased demand, the
future of The Job Resource is un
clear. The growing number of re
sumes being posted and companies
that have requested them might
prompt Angulo and Ortiz to move
the service from Angulo's computer
to an Internet service provider and
to charge a fee for its use, they said.
