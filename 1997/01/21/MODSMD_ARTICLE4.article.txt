### Robert Chiles Contributing writer 
Linda Wong, the chief financial
officer and general counsel of Re
build L.A., will come to Stanford
next month as a part of the Visit
ing Mentor Program at the Haas
Center for Public Service.
Wong, who will stay for five
days beginning Feb. 3, has worked
since 1993 for Rebuild L.A., a
group created to bolster develop
ment in inner-city areas affected
by the Los Angeles riots almost
five years ago.
"Linda comes with the perspec
tive of many years in a wide range
of public service activities," said
Debra Solomon, co-director of the
program. Wong previously served
as a staff attorney for the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Edu
cation Fund and as a director of
both California Tomorrow and
The Achievement Council.
During her stay, she will speak
to classes, staff, faculty, student
groups and individuals. "She will
be speaking with students about
how public service work can be a
gratifying career, as well as about
nationally and internationally

crucial issues like immigration
and civil rights," Solomon said.
On Feb. 4, Wong will discuss
her life experiences at 4 p.m. in the
Haas Center.
Wong also will meet with the
Asian Staff Forum and several
classes within the School of Edu
cation.
The Visiting Mentor Program,
founded in 1993 with private
funds, is designed to engage stu
dents one-on-one with profession
als who have devoted their lives to
public service.
"Students need to see the many
and diverse options available to
them as they start to think about
possible careers or lifelong inter
ests in public service," Solomon
said.
Former visiting mentors have
included Marti Leicester, a park
ranger and conservationist; Suzan
Shown Harjo, a Native American
poet and activist; and David Hil
fiker, a doctor who founded a
home and clinic for men with
AIDS in Washington, D.C.
Next quarter's mentor will be
Chris Avery, an international
lawyer, human rights advocate
and a Stanford alumnus. "He is
currently working on a project
about corporate responsibility in
developing countries," Solomon
said.
