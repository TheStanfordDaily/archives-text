# Perry, Patrick leave D.C. jobs, come to Farm

Two prominent members from
the first Clinton administration
will come to Stanford as profes
sors this quarter.
Engineering-Economic Sys
tems Prof. William Perry, who re
cently resigned as Clinton's secre
tary of defense, will rejoin the De
partment of Engineering-Eco
nomic Systems and Operations
Research, as well as the Institute
for International Studies.
Meanwhile, the Law School
will welcome as a visiting profes
sor Deval Patrick, who served as
assistant attorney general and
head of the Civil Rights Division of
the Department of Justice.
For Perry, the journey to Stan
ford will mark a return home. He
received both his bachelor's and
master's degrees from the Univer
sity and most recently was co-di
rector of the Center for Interna

tional Security and Arms Control,
an affiliate of the Institute for In
ternational Studies.
Until recently, it was unclear
whether Perry would choose to re
turn to the University or follow
other opportunities after his time
in Washington.
"I always hoped he would come
back, and I anticipated that he
would," said James Sweeney,
chair of the newly merged Engi
neering-Economic Systems and
Operations Research Depart
ment.
Now that the department
knows for certain, "There's great
enthusiasm for having Bill back
here," Sweeney said. "He's a care
ful observer and articulate com
mentator about changes in the
world."
"We're all delighted he's com
ing back," said Walter Falcon, di
rector of the Institute for Interna
tional Studies. "He's an extraordi
narily smart man to start with.
Given all the traveling he's done,
everything he's seen up close, he'll
have very keen insights."
Sweeney noted that Perry's re
turn "will build our strength in
national and international securi
ty," as well as other areas. "He's
going to be a very strong asset."
The Center for International
Security and Arms Control "is one
of the premier centers in the U.S.
that deals with security," Falcon
explained. The center looks at is
sues such as proliferation and the
changing nature of war.
"He'll have interesting and im
portant things to say on all those
things," Falcon said, as well as the
U.S. role in China, the Middle
East and elsewhere.
Although eager to see him,
Perry's colleagues will have to
wait a little bit longer. "We expect

him to be starting about March 1,"
Sweeney said.
Perry probably won't be teach
ing this year, but he will be busy
creating some new courses,
Sweeney said. Sweeney also added
that the department is working on
an undergraduate program, and he
hopes Perry will teach in that also.
Patrick, the official in charge of
civil rights enforcement in the
United States for the last three
years, will be the Law School's
Herman Pillager visiting profes
sor.
"It's very exciting," Law School
Dean Paul Brest said. "He's just
an incredibly bright and articulate
and interesting person."
The day Patrick's announce
ment that he was leaving the Jus
tice Department appeared in the
newspapers, about four weeks
ago, Brest called him to suggest
they talk about teaching opportu
nities.
In addition to his own quick re
sponse, Brest thinks that a visit
Patrick made to the Law School
last year also helped sway him. "I

think he liked the students and
faculty he met," Brest said.
The Herman Phlager visiting
professorship has been held by
former U.S. Attorney General Ed
ward Levy; for one day it was oc
cupied by Mikhail Gorbachev. The
underlying idea of the endowed
professorship is to provide stu
dents with "perspectives that they
might not otherwise have," Brest
explained.
"What could be better than to
have the person who was in charge
of civil rights teaching the sub
ject?" Brest asked.
Brest also thinks this will be a
unique opportunity for Patrick.
"This is a chance for him to see
what academic life is from the
view of a professor," Brest ex
plained.
As with Perry, Patrick will not
be arriving immediately. He will
start in early February teaching a
few days each week, while com
muting from his home in Boston.
If things work out well, Brest ad
mits he'd like to attract Patrick
for a longer stay.
