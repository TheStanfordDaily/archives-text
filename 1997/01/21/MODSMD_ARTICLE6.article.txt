# Sand Hill debate goes up on Web
## Site appeals to younger residents 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
A group of Palo Alto residents
are attempting to integrate
younger people into the Sand Hill
Road projects debate with a "revo
lutionary" electronic town hall.
The group, headed by Palo Alto
resident Claire MacElroy, has set
up a World Wide Web site designed
to provide voters with a place to dis
cuss their views on the proposed
projects, which include a new resi
dential apartment complex, the
widening and extending of Sand
Hill Road and the expansion of the
Stanford Shopping Center.
"We felt that the (Sand Hill
Road issue) meetings were largely
attended by older people," MacEl
roy said. "We wanted to open up
the discussion to younger people,
and we thought that an e-mail or

Internet access would be a way to
involve them."
The site — http://www.nanosp
ace.com/SpeakUp/ — indexes elec
tronic information on the project
and pubHc comments. It also offers
a forum that electronically emu
lates a town meeting, allowing par
ticipants to interact in real-time
discussion.
According to MacElroy, the site
is strictly unbiased.
"It is not financed by anybody
and takes no position on the issue,"
she said.
Instead, the site provides links
to the Web sites of the project's
major proponent, Stanford —
http://www-leland.stanford.edu
/—paj/ — and its major opponent,
the Palo Alto Civic League — hll p:
