Organizers of Stanford's Edu
cational Studies Program (ESP)
hope this description sounds like
you.
This fall, ESP hosted a success
ful eight-week program for high
school students, taught by mem
bers of the Stanford community.
The classes ranged from "Pro
gramming in C" to "Sleep and
Dreams." And yes, the "Physics of
Siege Weaponry" was very popu
lar.
For one weekend this spring,
high school students will again
journey to the Farm. However, in
stead of taking one or two classes
over a two-month period, two days
of courses lasting one to 12 hours
will be offered.
"We're calling the weekend

Splash, which isn't an acronym,"
explained ESP co-founder Kci
Harris, a junior. "It's a metaphor
for what we hope the program will
be, a chance for Stanford students
to get their feet wet as teachers
and for the students to try all new
things."

Splash will take place April 26
and 27.
The organizers of Splash are
looking for individuals who feel
strongly about a topic, craft, skill
or hobby. Harris described one po
tential litmus test for choosing a
course to teach.

"While there is absolutely no
limit to what you might love and
want to share, ask yourself, is this
something you wish you had
known or been exposed to as a
high school student?"

this fall were full of praise for co
founders Kei Harris and David
Harris.
Junior Jonathan Levitt taught
"Reagan Era Film and the Yuppie
Mentality" and believes that
Splash will be equally rewarding.
"ESP is an extremely well-run
and well-organized group, particu
larly for a group in its first year,"
Levitt said. "Teaching in the pro
gram exceeded all my expectations
and was one of the most rewarding
experiences I have had at Stan
ford.
"The teachers are all incredibly
enthusiastic about the subjects
they are teaching and about the

program in general, and that en
thusiasm is contagious."
Jacqueline Nerney, a doctoral
student in mechanical engineering,
taught C programming during
ESP's inaugural quarter. She de
scribed her first teaching experi
ence as wonderful.
"It was a great introduction to
teaching and offered us a lot of
room for creativity and originality,"
said Nerney. "I enjoyed putting my
curriculum together and modifying
it according to the needs of the
class."
It is that creativity and originali
ty that Kei Harris is looking for in
potential Splash teachers.
Harris added that the opportu
nity to teach is open to the entire
Stanford community and is not lim
ited to students.
Harris has spent several months

whetting the curiosity of area stu
dents and educators. Since the fall,
she has visited more than 20
schools, talking to classrooms and
guidance counselors about ESP's
mission and Splash.
Harris' diligence and persis
tence has paid off: The program re
ceived a write-up in the education
section of the San Francisco Chron
icle and was included in several
PTA newsletters.
More information can be found
on ESP's World Wide Web site
(www-leland.stanford.edu/group/
esp). Harris said she believes there
are some unique individuals out
there on the Farm who aren't
afraid of getting wet.
"We're looking for an eclectic
smorgasbord of courses," Harris
said. "I don't think the Stanford
community will disappoint us."
