Organizers of Stanford's Edu
cational Studies Program (ESP)
hope this description sounds like
you.
This fall, ESP hosted a success
ful eight-week program for high
school students, taught by mem
bers of the Stanford community.
The classes ranged from "Pro
gramming in C" to "Sleep and
Dreams." And yes, the "Physics of
Siege Weaponry" was very popu
lar.
For one weekend this spring,
high school students will again
journey to the Farm. However, in
stead of taking one or two classes
over a two-month period, two days
of courses lasting one to 12 hours
will be offered.
"We're calling the weekend

Splash, which isn't an acronym,"
explained ESP co-founder Kci
Harris, a junior. "It's a metaphor
for what we hope the program will
be, a chance for Stanford students
to get their feet wet as teachers
and for the students to try all new
things."

Splash will take place April 26
and 27.
The organizers of Splash are
looking for individuals who feel
strongly about a topic, craft, skill
or hobby. Harris described one po
tential litmus test for choosing a
course to teach.

"While there is absolutely no
limit to what you might love and
want to share, ask yourself, is this
something you wish you had
known or been exposed to as a
high school student?"
