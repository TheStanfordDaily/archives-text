## 
### David Stein Staff writer 
The Palo Alto City Council surrendered to time
limitations and a barrage of public debate last night
and chose not to vote on an ordinance that would
ban sitting and lying down on a seven-block stretch
of University Avenue.
With about 50 speaking requests to consider on
the controversial ordinance and the hour approach
ing midnight, the council opted to close debate after
limited testimony and reconsider the issue at a
later date. Fifteen speakers spoke against the ordi
nance, while only three spoke in its favor.
Palo Alto Mayor Joseph Huber said the council
should vote on the ordinance in March.
If the initiative had been voted on and ap
proved, people caught lying and sitting on Univer
sity Avenue sidewalks between High and Cowper
streets from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. would have faced a
fine.
Although City Attorney Ariel Calonne's presen
tation to the council stressed that the ordinance
was designed to ensure public safety and limit the
obstruction of crowded sidewalks, critics argue that
the initiative's main objective is to get rid of home
less people.
The Stanford Homelessness Action Coalition, a
group of Stanford students and local homeless peo
ple, has mounted opposition to the proposed legis
lation with a telephone lobbying campaign and a
significant presence at last night's meeting.
Waving signs reading "Stand Up for the Sit / Lie
Lie," members of SHAC arrived ready to voice their
belief that the ordinance would strip away the dig
nity of the many homeless people who take tempo
rary residence on University Avenue.
"This ordinance represents a growing trend of
targeting homeless people, of using them as scape
goats," said senior Roy Jacob, a SHAC member.
"There is no concern about social justice."
On the other hand, Calonne said during the
meeting that the ordinance should reduce pedestri
an distractions and the possibility of accidents.
Calonne added that accidents involving people trip
ping over sidewalk obstacles could pose a legal lia
bility to the city.
However, there have never been any reported in
cidents of people tripping over a seated person on
University Avenue, according to a report delivered
by officers of the Palo Alto Police Department.
