## Newt disciplined 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
day of dishonor for Newt Gin
grich, the House voted for the
first time in history to discipline
its speaker for ethical misconduct.
After months of partisan strife,
the vote was a lopsided 395-28 to
reprimand Gingrich and impose a
$300,000 penalty.
"The penalty is tough and
unprecedented," ethics commit
tee Chairwoman Nancy Johnson,
R-Conn., said at the start of a 90-
minute debate. Republicans and
Democrats agreed that Gingrich
had done wrong — indeed he had
admitted it — but they clashed
over the gravity of his misbehav
ior.
The partisanship that perme
ated the two-year investigation
was undiminished yesterday
despite the overwhelming vote. At
one point, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-
Calif., questioned whether Gin
grich was "ethically fit" to contin
ue as speaker.
However, most of the 435 seats
on the floor — and most in the vis
itors' gallery — were empty.
Gingrich, was attending meet
ings in his office and did not watch
the debate, said spokeswoman,
Maddox. When admitting
his guilt Dec. 21, Gingrich
acknowledged in a written state
ment that he "brought down on
the people's house a controversy
which could weaken the faith peo
ple have in their government."
After two years of denials, Gin
grich confessed to committee find
ings that he failed to "seek and

follow" legal advice that would
have warned him not to use tax
exempt projects to further parti
san goals.
He also agreed that he should
have known statements submit
ted under his name — denying his
political organization's connec
tion to the tax-exempt activities
— were "inaccurate, incomplete
and unreliable."
There were 196 Republicans,
198 Democrats and 1 independent
who supported the penalty. Twen
ty-six Republicans and two
Democrats were opposed and five
members merely voted "present."
Still unannounced is how Gin
grich will pay the $300,000. Some
Republicans said he would risk
further political uproar if he used
campaign money or established a
legal defense fund rather than
using his own money.
The $300,000 penalty imposed
on Gingrich emerged from plea
bargain negotiations in which the
ethics committee's special counsel
one mentioned a penalty as high
as $800,000, the speaker's lawyer
said yesterday. Attorney J. Ran
dolph Evans said Gingrich was
"shocked" even upon hearing the
lower figure.
A vote to reprimand a member
is reserved for "serious viola
tions" of the rules. The financial
penalty, never before imposed,
was to reimburse the ethics panel
for costs associated with expand
ing the investigation after Gin
grich submitted his misleading
statements.
