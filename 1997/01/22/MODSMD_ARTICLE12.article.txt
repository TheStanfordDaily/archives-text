# Supreme Court allows suits against Unocal

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Environmentalists cheered a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling yesterday
that allows them to sue Unocal for
polluting San Francisco Bay with
toxic selenium.
If found guilty under federal
law, Unocal could be fined $50 mil
lion or more, but the plaintiffs say
they just want the company's oil
refinery to stop the discharge.
"The refinery could have been
cleaned up long ago," said Greg
Karras, a scientist with one plain
tiff, Citizens for a Better Environ
ment. "The main reason we're real
happy is that now we can ensure it
does."
The Supreme Court refused to

reverse a lower court ruling in
favor ot the suit, which has been
stalled for almost three years by
Unocal's appeals.
Unocal operates a refinery in
Rodeo, about 15 miles east of San
Francisco, that environmentalists
say is by far the biggest source of
selenium entering San Francisco
Bay.
Selenium becomes more con
centrated the higher it moves on
the food chain and has already
resulted in a ban on eating certain
diving water birds.
Harbor seals in the bay show
higher levels of selenium in their
blood than do animals from other
regions and have suffered broken

whiskers that may be caused by
excess selenium.
Unocal has acknowledged vio
lating federal selenium limits, but
argued it could not be sued because
the company reached a 1994 agree
ment with California Water Quali
ty Control Board to pay a $780,000
fine. Under the agreement, Unocal
was allowed to violate the federal
50 parts per billion selenium stan
dard until 1998.
"Our position is that we already
paid a fine, we think it's a penalty,
and it's ludicrous that we should
have to pay penalties twice," said
Unocal spokeswoman Karen
Rodgers.
The 9th U.S. District Court of

Appeals disagreed, and now the
Supreme Court has allowed that
ruling to stand.
Lawyers for CBE and the Save
San Francisco Bay Association will
now ask Chief U.S. District Judge
Thelton Henderson to expedite the
case, said Jollee Faber, one of the
plaintiffs' attorneys.
"Judge Henderson has also indi
cated he is concerned about the
public health effects of the delay,"
Faber said.
CBE staff attorney Nora
Chorover said that Unocal faces a
maximum penalty of $25,000 per
day on each of two violations, and
the clock began ticking on Dec.
12, 1993.
