# Future of Hong Kong freedoms questionable
## British, Chinese disagree over civil liberties on the eve of the change of sovereignty 
### 
HONG KONG (AP) - With
Chinese rule less than six months
away, Hong Kong is being forced to
wonder anew how much freedom it
will have after July 1.
Moves by a Chinese-appointed
committee to roll back some of
Hong Kong's recently won civil lib
erties have jangled nerves, plung
ing Britain and China into yet
another round of harsh verbal
exchanges that are marring the
momentous change of sovereignty.
At a deeper level, though, the
clash reflects the conflicting states

of mind of the two powers as they
prepare for the final act in this end
of-empire drama.
Britain is determined to occupy
the moral ground and end the 156-
year colonial chapter with honor.
China is equally determined not to
bow to the country that grabbed a
piece of its territory for a colony.
Prickly attitudes were evident
yesterday when Gov. Chris Patten
denounced the "legal nonsense" of
the proposed legal changes, and
Chinese spokesman Shen Guofang
retorted that China's Communist

government would not let itself be
pushed around.
"We cannot accept others forc
ing their ways on us," Shen said.
By now the pattern is familiar.
Britain proposes a law. China
objects. Britain enacts it anyway.
China says it will annul it when it
recovers Hong Kong on July 1.
That's what happened when
Patten reformed the election sys
tem in 1994. China immediately
said it would disband any legisla
ture elected under these rules.
Now comes the civil liberties

question, which amounts to a clash
between two fundamental pieces of
legislation, each claiming suprema
cy over the other.
There's the Western-style Bill of
Rights bequeathed to Hong Kong
by Britain in 1991, and the consti
tution called the Basic Law that
China introduced for post-colonial
Hong Kong in 1990.
To China's critics, reversing
freedoms is simply part of a Chi
nese scheme to bring the free
wheeling colony to heel once the
colonial era is over.
