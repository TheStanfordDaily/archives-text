# Peru hostage crisis continues
## 
### 
LIMA, Peru (AP) — Police lobbed stones
and bottles at the Japanese ambassador's
residence yesterday, taunting the leftist
guerrillas who have been holding hostages
inside for more than a month.
The government has launched an overall
effort to build pressure on the Tupac Amaru
rebels, who show no sign of dropping their
demand that the government free at least
300 of their jailed comrades in exchange for
the release of the 73 hostages.
A spokesman at Lima police headquarters
said he was not aware of the incidents. Tele
phone calls to the Interior Ministry, which is
in charge of the police, were not answered. It
was unlikely, however, that the police agents
were acting without the approval of their
superiors.
Some police agents laughed and one made
an obscene gesture at the residence. They
threw empty film canisters, pounded on a
door and tossed debris over the 10-foot wall
into the yard of the compound, which the
rebels seized Dec. 17 during a garden cock
tail party.
Holding more than 500 guests at first, the
rebels have been releasing hostages gradual
ly.
The taunting drew no response from the
estimated 20 heavily armed guerrillas inside.
The rebels have warned police to stay 330
feet away, a demand that police commandos
defied on Monday by walking slowly in front
of the compound.
Rebels and the government have yet to
agree on conditions for talks on releasing the
hostages, but the Red Cross showed signs
yesterday it was preparing for negotiations.
Red Cross representative Michel Minnig

and a colleague strolled along the tree-lined
street outside the home in the affluent San
Isidro district, taking notes on a clipboard.
Victor Sanconi, who lives across the
street, said Minnig asked him if he would
allow his home to be used for talks. Sanconi,
71, refused.
"I don't want to leave my house and I
don't want political problems or anything to
do with this," he said. Many residents of
houses neighboring the ambassador's have
moved out temporarily because of the
hostage crisis.
The rebels say they won't talk unless the
government agrees to discuss freedom for
imprisoned comrades, many of whom car
ried out kidnappings and assassinations.
The prisoners include the wife of rebel lead
er Nestor Cerpa.
President Alberto Fujimori hits indicated
the issue could be raised in debate, but at the
same time has flatly refused to trade prison
ers for hostages.
His government has proposed a media
tion panel that would include representa
tives of the Red Cross and the Roman
Catholic Church. Canadian Ambassador
Anthony Vincent, a former hostage, has
agreed to participate as an observer.
No date has been set for talks, and it was
not clear whether stepped-up police activity
around the home might put the brakes on
any progress.
Armed police in bulletproof vests some
times run across the street opposite the resi
dence, crouching in combat poses.
They have thrown objects at the residence
on at least one other occasion, and rebels
said they responded with warning shots.
