# Clinton praised
## Republicans support Medicare budget 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Grap
pling quickly with headaches of his
second term, President Clinton
put forth a Medicare budget plan
yesterday that won surprisingly
strong Republican praise. Clinton
also launched a drive for campaign
reforms he promised but failed to
achieve in his first four years.
The White House also
announced it was taking tougher
steps to restrict access after last
year's embarrassing disclosure
that at least one convicted felon
and a Chinese arms dealer had
attended campaign-related events.
Yet, presidential spokesman
Mike McCurry said Clinton still
would feel free to invite big-money
contributors to sleep over in the
White House in the Lincoln bed
room, as high rollers did in his first
term.
"He has a right as a human
being and as president to say
thank you," McCurry told
reporters.
On the politically explosive
issue of Medicare savings, the pres
ident said he was "meeting the
Republicans halfway" by offering
to scale down spending by $100 bil
lion over five years to balance the
budget by 2002. "I hope they'll
meet me halfway."
The savings would be $138 bil
lion over six years. The savings are
substantially more than Clinton
proposed when budget talks col
lapsed last January. The Medicare
program of health-insurance bene
fits for the elderly is projected to be
insolvent by 2001; Clinton has
promised a plan to keep it solvent
for 10 years.
Republicans, who had accused
Clinton of demagoguery on Medi
care during the campaign, spoke
warmly about his proposal.
"The fact that he has unilater
ally moved halfway in our direc
tion is something that is very, verv

positive for us," said Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the
House Ways and Means Commit
tee. He called it a "tremendous
move" but said Republicans would
have to study the details.
House Budget Committee
chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio,
said, "This brightens the prospects
to get a budget agreement."
Most of Clinton's savings would
be achieved by reducing payments
to doctors and hospitals. But a por
tion of it — $10 billion over five
years — would come from recipi
ents by increasing the premium
they would pay for coverage begin
ning in 1999.
A day after his second magura
tion and a late night of partying,
Clinton met with his economic
advisers at the White House to dis
cuss a plan to balance the budget
by 2002. he went to the win
ter meeting of the Democratic
National Committee and issued a
call for the Republican-led
Congress to enact a package of
campaign finance reforms.
The president renewed his sup
port of a bill co-sponsored by Sens.
John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., seeking to ban
political action committee contri
butions to all federal candidates
and end unlimited soft money
donations.
"Soft money" is a term for polit
ical donations that individuals and
corporations can give to avoid lim
its on direct giving to candidates.
Instead the money goes to the
political parties.
"Act now," Clinton encouraged
Congress. "While the public is
watching, while the momentum is
building, act now. Don't delay.
You've got a good bill here." Clin
ton had promised sweeping cam
paign finance reforms four years
ago, but never made them a high
priority of his first term.
