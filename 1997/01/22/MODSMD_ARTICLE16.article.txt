Bombed clinic reopens
TULSA, Okla. (AP) — Nervous workers yesterday reopened an
abortion clinic that was bombed over the weekend as investigators
checked out fresh tips in their search for the culprits.
"We can't just give up and walk away from what I consider to be
our mission," said Sherri Finik, executive administrator of Repro
ductive Services.
No one was injured when at least one explosion rocked the closed
Reproductive Sen-ices on Sunday afternoon, breaking windows and
sending shrapnel into walls. A second device may also have exploded,
officials said.
As part of their investigation, the FBI released a 1996 audio tape
on Monday in which an unidentified caller claims responsibility for
two firebombings at Planned Parenthood in nearby Broken Arrow.
"I did that — may do something worse again," a male voice said.
"Me and my buddies are out to get you. You better tell your employ
ees it's going to get dangerous."
Foreign money loses style
WASHINGTON (AP) — Trying to improve its image, the Demo
cratic National Committee announced yesterday it would no longer
accept money from people or companies with foreign ties and would
limit contributions from labor unions and wealthy benefactors.
The party also listed steps it said would prevent unseemly charac
ters from gaining access to the president and vice president through
political receptions at the White House and vice presidential resi
dence. Separately, the Clinton administration announced efforts of
its own to conduct more thorough background checks on people
invited into the White House.
