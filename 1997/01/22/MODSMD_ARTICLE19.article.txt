## Editorial Sand Hill expansion 
### 
Don't let the nitpickers
delay the start of Sand
Hill Road construction

IT IS OFTEN said the last two
minutes of a close basketball or
football game are the longest
two minutes in the world. But that
motto might be revised as the final
moments of the tortuous odyssey
known as the planning phase of the
Sand Hill Road project draws to a
close.
Last week, the final Environ
mental Impact Report on the pro
posed expansion of Sand Hill
Road— which took four years and
$1.3 million to complete — was
released. The report, which consist
ed of nine phone-book-sized vol
umes, bore no revelations or sur
prises from a draft report released
last summer. In general, it said the
expansion would benefit the sur
rounding communities without sig
nificant detriment to the environ
ment.
However, before the crews can
break ground, the Palo Alto City
Council must approve the final
details of the $342 million project.
As such, University administrators
and civic leaders must make the
most economically sound and
strategically valuable decisions for
the long term even if it means main
taining an uncompromising or
unpopular position against oppo
nents.
It seems most likely the expan
sion will proceed, after more than a
decade of wrangling and debate.
But opponents can use some last
minute maneuvers to cripple the
project. At public hearings next
week, they are sure to show up in
force to reduce the scope of the
development and bog it down in
details.
Among the biggest concessions
the opposition is sure to demand
would be to make the planned road
connecting Sand Hill Road to El
Camino Real two instead of four
lanes. Also, some would try to

undercut development in order to
preserve Ohlone Field by proposing
the apartment complex be built
next to Hoover Pavilion instead or
be forgotten altogether.
Additionally, opponents hope to
push through a number of restric
tions like limiting expansion of the
Stanford Shopping Center to the
south end.
On the one hand, project man
agers and supporters should be will
ing to compromise on some issues,
like expanding the shopping center
only on the south side. Doing so
would limit the environmental
impact on the San Francisquito
Creek. Listening to and negotiating
with the opposition could do much
to smooth over the tensions gener
ated by this entire contentious
affair
But simultaneously, managers
must bear in mind that conces
sions made now just to get the pro
ject moving could become problem
atic. It has been the unfailing goal
of many opponents to derail this
project completely, even as evi
dence mounted that the widening
and lengthening of Sand Hill Road,
construction of the apartment
complex and senior center and
expansion of the shopping center
would benefit a great many people
without seriously impacting the
environment.
Just the planning phase has
taken years and millions of dollars
to complete, and any future
changes to the project are sure to
meet with stiff resistance by these
same opponents. Planners must
proceed with caution; giving in to
their demands now could make
future improvements exceedingly
difficult.
The expansion of Sand Hill Road
should and will go forward. The
obstacle now is how the project shall
progress. Supporters and managers
of the expansion must not settle for
half-measures or compromise too
much just to get the project started
lest they wish to condemn future
residents and commuters to even
more delays as opponents bicker
over minutiae.
