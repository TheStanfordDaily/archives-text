## An open letter to Casper 
### 
Dear president casper,
Whether you know it or not,
you've got a problem. You are the
chief executive of our University — you
answer to the faculty, alumni, Board of
Trustees and media. Whenever the Band
does something unfunny, or the townies
start yelping about Stanford's develop
ment plans, or the Navy starts wonder
ing about its money, the buck stops with
you. I wouldn't want your job.
But you're making it harder than it
needs to be. The one group you appar
ently haven't mastered on this campus
is the student body. Perhaps it's because
we're young and inexperienced. Perhaps
it's because most of the time we're clue
less. Perhaps it's because you just don't
understand us. But we're your prob
lem.
As Dean Montoya can attest to, we're
not dumb. We read. We learn. We adapt.
And we've got you figured out.
In a nutshell, you and the rest of the
administration and faculty are sending
us the wrong message. If we want to
change something around here, we have
two choices: act responsibly within the
system or throw a temper tantrum. We
know which you prefer. We also know
which one works. Let me elaborate.
1. For five years, a majority of stu
dents opposed the "Grey Interpretation"
of the Fundamental Standard — the
notorious speech code you inherited.
Your response was to do nothing, until
students took the University to court —
and won.

2. Two years ago, when the Faculty
Senate voted to change Stanford's grad
ing policy, student input was largely
ignored. As a result, the drop deadline
was moved up, discouraging students
from taking academic risks. Honors
research appears to be dropping in some
departments, but when The Daily criti
cized Senate Chair Gail Mahood, several
members of the faculty, including your
self, blasted student reaction as childish.
3. For more than 20 years, students
passionately argued for further ethnic
studies resources. They wrote letters,
signed petitions, sat on committees and
were buried. Finally, they got sick of it
all, and students launched a hunger
strike. Now we have the new Program for
Comparative Studies of Race and Ethnic
ity.
When students try to work with
administrators to solve problems, we get
ignored. Sororities want housing? Create
a Greek Task Force! Students want a
socially responsible endowment fund?
Quick, get the Board of Trustees to vote
the idea down before they present a pro
posal!
Delay, stall, ignore. This seems to be
your motto. Unless we're discussing pub
lic universities in California, most stu
dents are gone in four years. Institution
al memory weakens with the high
turnover.
But we've discovered your weakness:
public relations. It's a sign of the times.
The president of the United States can
govern by media poll, so why can't the

president of Stanford University?
President Casper, you are a great
teacher. You have taught us that PR
often means damage control. Hunger
strikes, sit-ins, protests, boycotts and
lawsuits ... sounds like the recipe for
change on the Farm.
In the next several months, the stu
dents will be watching. Many of us have
important issues to be resolved. The
Greek task force should release its report
on sorority housing soon, and Stanford
seems to be breaking the law. Likewise,
students who support a socially responsi
ble endowment fund will not go quietly
into the night. Perhaps we shouldn't put
all of our stock in Ben and Jerry's, but
should Stanford really be supporting
child labor?
Give us a sign that you're listening.
Prevent a lawsuit by being pro-active.
Don't ignore students who attempt to
improve the University by working in the
system. You encourage us to pursue what
are otherwise considered "desperation"
tactics.
Now that we know what it takes to get
your attention, your problems may just
be beginning.

Jim Finsten thinks it's only a matter of
time before someone goes after the senior
gift-
