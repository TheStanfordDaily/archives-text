Academic freedom and the Pfefferbaum controversy

IT WAS WITH some interest that I
read the letter ("Professors rally
around Dr. Mazze," Friday's letters)
signed by Drs. Andrew Hoffman and Paul
Khavari, who were said to be represent
ing 48 other faculty members. Unfortu
nately, for fear of retaliation, many of
those Stanford faculty assigned to the
Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hos
pital who would disagree with that letter
do not feel so free to express their views.
University officials have known for some
time that many faculty assigned to the
VA believe they are working in an oppres
sive environment, in which basic academ
ic freedoms, such as the right to express
an opinion without fear of retaliation, are
not honored.
Indeed, academic freedom and retalia
tion are at the heart of the Pfefferbaum
controversy. The disgraceful events
which led to Dr. Adolf Pfefferbaum's de
facto dismissal from the University were
set in motion when he and two other
Stanford faculty members asked the dean
of the School of Medicine to investigate
Assoc. Dean Richard I. Mazze's perfor
mance. The dean not only permitted, but

apparently encouraged Mazze to retaliate
against the three under color of VA
authority and then denied any University
responsibility for this retaliation, claim
ing that it was purely a VA matter.
The dean of the Medical School and
the University provost have since refused
to investigate other alleged violations of
faculty rights at the VA, on the grounds
that the VA environment is strictly a VA
affair. In recent sworn testimony, VA
Hospital Director James Goff gave ample
proof, however, that VA standards are
not sufficient in themselves to protect
the rights normally afforded faculty
members. According to Goff, academic
freedom "is not a recognized thing in VA
circles."
Several faculty members have told me
they felt pressured to endorse the Hoff
man / Khavari letter, which was circulat
ed in draft form by their VA superiors.
Those faculty who agreed with the letter
should keep in mind that the rights of all
Stanford faculty, inside and outside the
Medical School, and not just Pfeffer
baum's, are under attack in this case.
They should not be so quick to dismiss

charges of rights' violations, the details
of which most of them know little or
nothing about, just because their own
needs are currently satisfied.
Only a formal investigation, conduct
ed in an open and transparent fashion,
can answer the questions raised by Pfef
ferbaum's dismissal. Unfortunately, Uni
versity officials have thus far successful
ly blocked discussion of the issues, which
will now have to come out in court.
The letter by Mazze ("Med School prof
explains his side in VA dispute") pub
lished in the same edition also deserves
some comment. Mazze would like his
readers to believe that Pfefferbaum's
complaints against him have already
received fair hearings, if not through
Stanford channels, then through federal
and court procedures.
In fact, the federal grievance proce
dure to which Mazze refers was based on
VA rules, wherein issues of academic
freedom (e.g., Do professors have a right
to request that the dean of the Medical
School investigate the performance of an
associate dean, without fearing loss of
position?) are not relevant. The Dean's

Office subverted even this limited hear
ing; a senior associate dean, who had told
numerous faculty that he thought Mazze
irrational, claimed under oath that he
could not remember ever making such
statements.
The suit to which Mazze refers, in
which I too was a plaintiff, was never
adjudicated. It could not be pursued
because Mazze took refuge behind the
legal shield of the VA. No court has con
doned his behavior.
Finally, the "medical misconduct"
charge mentioned by former Congress
man Paul McCloskey (see "Response filed
in Med School case," Jan. 15) is a matter
of public record. The alleged victim has
filed a suit against Mazze, which has yet
to be heard in court. At least one Stan
ford professor believes he was harassed
and lost his administrative position for
rendering an honest opinion in this case,
when the alleged victim sought further
treatment.
