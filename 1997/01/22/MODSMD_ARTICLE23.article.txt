# Shen needs to check accuracy of reform's 'general principles'
## 
### 
Some three decades ago, I was teach
ing a course in the history of the French
language, a requirement for students

working toward a doctorate in French.
A student who had failed the course
asked me to relinquish the require
ment.
As he was interested in literature, he
saw no point in taking a course in lin
guistics. I told him I was prepared to
relinquish the requirement if he was
prepared to sign his own doctoral diplo
ma.

Incidentally, ASSU President Bill
Shen's first principle — "Universities
were created for students" — is histori
cally inaccurate. What became in time
"universities" were medieval institu
tions created by scholars for scholars.
Originally, they were gatherings of
savants — "persons with detailed knowl
edge in some specialized field such as sci
ence or literature" (Webster's Third) —

to which students were not admitted.
Later, students were allowed to attend
provided they kept quiet. Ostracized to
the poulailler (remote balconies), they
could listen but not speak. Still later,
students were permitted respectfully to
participate in the scholars' discussions,
disputations and debates.
