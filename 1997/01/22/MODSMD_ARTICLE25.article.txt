HOW OFTEN HISTORY eludes us.
Monday, in addition to being MLK
Day, was also the day that Bill
Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd-and
-1/2 President of the United States
(BCIA42PUS Day), and nobody I know
here watched it. Of course, wo do live on
the West Coast where everything is "just
so laid back," meaning "everything on TV
starts way too early." For example, on ABC
(home of "Monday Evening Football"),
coverage of the inaugural ended at 10 a.m.,
while most of us were still asleep celebrat
ing Dr. King's dream.
It's a shame many of us missed the gala
affair because amidst all the "hype and
hoopla" (or "fanfare and frolic"), there was
a message, which was repeated many times
and goes something like this: "Time is of
the essence and that time is now!"
You may be ask, "Why?" and if so, then

you obviously haven't bothered to look at a
calendar in, like, a thousand years because
if you had, you would know that our mil
lennium, the Millennium, is almost over.
Fortunately, this historical fact wasn't
lost on the throngs gathered in Washing
ton, as they welcomed not just another (or
actually, the same) president, but "The
Last President of the Millennium," one
who issued a "New Promise," a promise to
build a "Bridge to the 21st Century!"
Yes, unless you make your living in
Roman numerals, it seems there's good
reason to get excited about the big 2000.
Everything becomes more important,
seems a little grander when seen in the
grander scheme of things.
Inspired, I decided to start looking at
things with a renewed sense of history.
Here's how my "ordinary" day went:
"Yesterday was a Tuesday, the first and
hist Tuesday I would experience this week.
I began the day as I had begun every day for
more than 22 years: I got up, got dressed
and brushed my teeth, remembering that

our nation's first president, George Wash
ington, had in fact teeth of wood, which he
had fashioned for himself from his father's
cherry tree. Or so the legend goes.
"I walked to class that day, employing a
form of transportation first evolved by the
newly evolving homo erect us and later pop
ularized hy the ancient Israelites in the
Sinai Desert. It is generally noted that in
medieval Europe, most peasants never
ventured farther than 10 miles — this was
before the metric system — from the town
in which they were born. This was because
most of them walked and, given their
incredibly short life expectancies, many
died before they got anywhere.
"At approximately 10:57 a.m. on Jan.
21, 1997, I arrived at the History Corner
(where else?), for what I already knew
would be the very last class I would attend
before lunch. The lecture was long, though
not nearly as lengthy as any of the notable
speeches of the orator Cicero (106-43 8.C.)
who so wowed the Roman Senate with his
day-long harangues that they eventually

named a suburb of Chicago after him.
Class eventually ended, and I prepared to
exit via the doors through which so many
before me had passed, but not before our
professor announced that due to a schedul
ing conflict, his office hours had changed,
not only for this week but for all time.
"Outside, the weather had grown dra
matically warmer. I noticed that the sun
was now much higher in the sky, and I
realized how easy it must once have been
for intelligent people to believe that the
sun in fact revolved around the Earth — so
strongly that their Church would condemn
Galileo in 1633 as a blasphemer lor doubt
ing their divine theory's validity. I walked
home, realizing that when next I ventured
out, it would be afternoon.
"Lunch was good. In fact, history will
show that, having skipjxHl breakfast, this
is the first time I had ever eaten since the
night before. Of course, elsewhere millions
are starving, in part because there are
more people alive now on this planet than
have ever lived here before through histo

ry. Even so, I bit into my cheese-and-let
tuce-on-rye and wondered what I'd be eat
ing if John Montagu, Fourth Earl of Sand
wich (1718-1792; hadn't invented it. .
Well, I think you've got the idea. I'm
sure you don't really care to hear all the
details of my day — important day though
it was in the course of human histoiy.
History is nice, but let's not dwell on it
too much. It's fine if the impending era
brings with it a little sense of urgency. I
myself have far too often been caught
thinking, "Why should I do today what I
can put off 'til the next millennium?"
I just can't get that excited about it
because when the time comes and goes in
alxjut four more years, we'll all realize that
the year is not much different than any
other and we'll wonder what all the hype
was about. And then we can go back to
slacking off until 3000.
