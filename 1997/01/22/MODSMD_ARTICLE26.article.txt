## Bears get clubbed Volleyball spikes Cal 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
If you liked your Weenies well-done, then on
Friday night Maples Pavilion was the place to be.
The top-ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team continued its mastery of the California
Golden Bears with a convincing 15-9, 15-4, 15-9
rout in Maples. Senior swing hitter Matt Fuer
bringer and freshman swing hitter Andy Witt led
the way for the Cardinal with 10 and 14 kills,
respectively, to help roast the Weenies in just
over an hour.
"It was a good match for us," said Stanford
head coach Ruben Nieves. "I also liked our spir
it, enthusiasm and focus."
Game one opened rather ominously with Cal
jumping out to a quick 2-0 lead. As a matter of
fact, the Golden Bears played their best game of
the evening, committing only three errors and
hitting a strong .440. However, the Cardinal was
able to respond with the serving of senior setter
Stewart Chong, who would eventually finish
with a solid 43 assists. His play allowed them to
pull away and take a one-game lead.
"Chong had a real good serving match,"
Nieves said. "He was particularly effective with
the jump serve and his float serve which put a lot
of pressure on Cal's defense"
Game two, Nieves said, was never in doubt.
Indeed, Stanford played like a No. 1 team as the
Cardinal ran out to a huge lead and blew Cal off
the court. The Bears were demoralized and it
showed on the stat sheet, as they hit a pathetic
.097 and committed 10 hitting errors to only 13
kills.
Facing a two-game deficit, Cal made one last
desperate push in the third game. Taking advan
tage of Stanford passing lapses, the Bears were
able to eke out an 8-6 lead. However, that was as
close as they got to any semblance of victory as
Stanford's fierce middle blockers
got a couple of key stuff-blocks to
right themselves and regain an
advantage they would not relin
quish. Furthermore, the strong
blocking up front forced Cal into
nine errors in game three and

that spelled doom for the Wee
nies. The match ended appropri
ately enough, with a jump-serve
ace by hotshot freshman Witt.
Witt, in his first career start, hit
.476, had four digs and assisted
on three blocks.
"He had a good solid match for
us," Nieves said. "He served effec
tively and passed extremely well.
He helped our defense too. He def
initely impressed a lot of people."

Having started fast at home,
hopes remain high for the volley
ball team as it attempts to match
the success of its female counter
parts. Despite the loss of senior
middle blocker Brian Moore to an
ACL tear, they still present oppo
nents with a deep and intimidat
ing block up front.
And unlike last season when
the team struggled mightily due
to a month-long foot injury to

Moore, Nieves feels they are bet
ter equipped to cope with his
loss.
"It's certainly a blow, but I
think talent-wise we are much
better equipped to handle the loss
of Brian because we have [senior
Mike] Lambert back," Nieves
said. "We are still in position to
have a great season, and I still
think we are the No. 1 team in
the country."
