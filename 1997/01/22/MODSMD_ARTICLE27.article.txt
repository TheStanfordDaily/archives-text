# Monahan takes title but women tumble

### Vanessa Arrington Editorial staff 
The Stanford women's gymnastics
team may have lost its home meet against
No. 1 UCIA last Fr ' iy, but the Cardinal
has little to be disappointed about. Despite
two losses for the season, the Cardinal has
been competing with the top teams-in the
nation and continues to improve its own
scoring.
"The team total (this season) is higher
than we scored all last year until late
February," said head coach Lisa Izzi.
"We've really shown a lot of improvement
early in the season."
Stanford's high score of 193.225 Friday
night — which was almost two points high
er than the team's previous score the week
before — was assisted by a packed house at
Burnham Pavilion.
"It was the best crowd in the history of
Stanford gymnastics at Burnham — stand
ing room only," Izzi said. "The meet was
televised on Sports Channel — there was so
much excitement."
"The crowd was incredible; they were so
supportive," said freshman Larissa
Fontaine, who garnered first place on the
bars. "It's so fun to compete at home, with
the school behind you."
Junior Keri Monahan led the Cardinal
against UCLA, rounding up first-place fin
ishes in the all-around category, the vault
and the balance beam. Monahan's all
around score of 39.475 was just enough to
beat out UCLA's Kiralee Hayashi, who
came in second with a score of 39.375.
Bruin Leah Homma took third place with
39.200 points.
In the vault competition, the Cardinal
beat out UCLA by .05 points, and Mona
han's first-place score of 9.950 set a new
Cardinal record. Fontaine's score of 9.900
tied with UClA's Heidi Moneymaker for
second place. Stanford had no falls on the
vault.
"At this point, for us to be vaulting as
good as we are, we're kind of setting a new
standard for Stanford," Izzi said. "Where
that's been weak before, it's now our
strongest event."
On the bars, Fontaine finished first with
9.900 points, a score that would have prob
ably been a 10 if it weren't for a hop on her

dismount, Izzi said. Second place on the
bars went to UCLA's Leah Homma.
"Stanford is definitely moving in the
right direction on the bars," Izzi said.
"We're matching the difficulty other teams
have, we just need to fine tune and make
sure we have clean lines."
Beam continues to be a problem area for
the Cardinal, as four of the sue Stanford
gymnasts fell on this event Friday night.
These falls greatly contributed to the even
tual disparity in scores between Stanford
and UCIA, as the Cardinal only scored
46.650 on the beam while UCLA brought
in 48.275 points.
"People have been nervous (on the
beam), and they're letting it get to them,"
said Monahan, who came in first place with
a score of 9.875. "With the beam you have
a smaller margin of error, and a small devi
ation from your concentration can throw
you off a lot more than on other events,
which depend more on power, strength and
timing.
"That's why I like the beam — it's all
mental, all based on how well you're able to
control what your body is doing."
Coach Izzi credits many of the falls to
the fact that the Cardinal is a young team.
She is fixing the problem in the gym by sim
ulating situations with greater pressure
during practice.
"We need to fix our consistency, espe
cially on the beam," said sophomore Tracey
Kohl. "We do it all the time in the gym; we
just haven't done it yet in a meet, but it's
right there."
Stanford performed well on the floor
exercise, although first-place honors
went to UCLA's Hayashi with 9.925.
Monahan tied with a Bruin for second
place with 9.900 points. Izzi said Stan
ford did more difficult tumbling than
UCLA but still has room for improve
ment on the floor exercise.
"We need to have effortless landings
and no stumbles or extra foot move
ments," Izzi said. "And in their dance
combos, the gymnasts need to have full
amplitude.
"We're a young team, and we still see
that placing at nationals is a realistic
goal for us. We just need to pay attention
to fixing mistakes and continuing
improvement."
