It's not hard to spark American champion
cyclist Greg LeMond's competitive side â€” just
give him the finger.
At least that's what LeMond's nemesis did at
the 1989 World Championships, provoking
LeMond to chase down his fingered fiend,
increasing his speed on the last 300 meters to a
victory.
"That really psyched me up," he said. "It was
a great, great memory."
About 600 people listened to LeMond's other
great moments as a professional cyclist. The
packed event, held in Kresge Auditorium Friday
night, was co-sponsored by the Stanford Cycling
Club and Palo Alto's Wheelsmith bike shop.
LeMond, the only American to win cycling's
most prestigious race, the Tour de France,
retired from professional cycling in 1994. He

won the Tour de France three times and the
World Championship at age 22 and has written
a book about riding and training techniques.
For 90 minutes, LeMond discussed his
cycling career using humorous anecdotes, while
answering a few audience questions. LeMond
narrated slides that highlighted his 19-year
cycling career, all shot by British cycling pho
tographer Graham Watson.
Many of the 60 slides showed LeMond com
peting in the Tour de France, which he
described as "a spectacle, a monumental event
people should see once in their lives."
LeMond said his most memorable victory in
cycling was the 1990 Tour de France. LeMond,
who was shot in a hunting accident in 1987, had
reservations about his physical ability and psy
chological stamina going into the race.
However, LeMond met the challenge. On the
last dav of the three-week race, LeMond rode

into Paris pedaling as fast as 35 mph in a yellow
jersey, which denotes the lowest overall elapsed
time during the race, and won.
LeMond stressed the importance of main
taining confidence and staying focused. "It's all
about telling yourself what's important and
having a tremendous desire," he said.
Slumped over on a stool dressed in a blue
flannel shirt and jeans, LeMond also talked
about unusual riding techniques, such as when
to take a bathroom break without falling behind
the pack.
During an especially long and hilly ride in the
French Alps, LeMond recalled needing to pull
over for breaks as many as five times.
"My teammates just shook their heads. I
found the best time to go is during those really
flat points," he said with a laugh.
