# Building names provide rich history

Dinkelspiel. Green. Kresge. When you hear
these names, you think of buildings — not peo
ple.
You probably think of studying or a Coffee
House espresso when you hear "Tresidder" —
not the Stanford president whose sudden death
moved ASSU senators to fight for a building
named in his honor.
You probably think of the south stacks or re
search papers when you hear "Green" — not the
founder of Texas Instruments who grew to love
the Farm while working at a nearby company.
While some of these people gave money to see

their names immortalized, others were remem
bered because of their service to Stanford. As
part of an occasional series, The Daily will look
at the people behind these names.
Terman Engineering Center
The Terman Engineering Center — a place
many techies consider their home away from
home — was built in memory of Frederick Em
mons Terman, who many consider to be the in
tellectual father of Silicon Valley.
Terman was born on June 7, 1900, and re
ceived his bachelor's in electrical engineering at
Stanford, leaving the Farm to complete his doc
torate at MIT. He returned to teach in the de

partment in 1927, eventually becoming dean of
the School of Engineering.
Terman again left the campus during World
War II to work as the director of Harvard's
Radio Research Institute. His work greatly in
fluenced the Allied effort, and earned him the
Medal of Merit — the highest civilian award
given by the government. He also authored the
"Radio Engineers Handbook," often considered
the Bible of radio engineering.
He became Stanford's provost in 1955, hold
ing the post until his retirement 10 years later.
Largely responsible for the prominence of the
School of Engineering, he died at
his on-campus home on Dec. 19,
1982.
The total cost of the Terman
Engineering Center was $9.2 mil
lion, a major portion of which was
donated by two of Terman's former
students, William Hewlett and
David Packard.
Tresidder Union
Tresidder was named after Don
ald B. Tresidder, Stanford's
fourth president. His brief but in
fluential presidency began on
Sept. 1,1943, and came to a shock
ing end on Jan. 28, 1948, when he
was found dead by a maid in his
New York hotel room.
News of the enormously popu
lar president's death hit the cam
pus hard. Because of this, ASSU
senators proposed building a stu
dent union in his name. After
much consultation with faculty
and administrative board mem
bers, the students' proposal be
came reality. Tresidder Union was
dedicated on Sept. 29,1962.
Before becoming president,
Tresidder had served as president
of the Board of Trustees.
In a historical oddity, Tresidder
died before he could be formally
inaugurated as the University's
president. The University at first
decided to postpone his inaugura
tion ceremonies until after the
end of World War 11, but no plans
were finalized before his death.
Cubberley Auditorium
Elwood P. Cubberley is often
thought of as the man who saved
the Department of Education.
Born on June 6, 1868, he start
ed at Stanford as an assistant pro
fessor in the summer of 1898 fol
lowing tenures at Harvard and
Columbia universities.
After only two months, he was
appointed head of the much-ma

ligned department. In 1917, large
ly because of his efforts, the De
partment of Education became
the School of Education, with
Cubberley as its dean. He retired
in 1933.
He and his wife, Helen, later
donated the $50,000 needed to
build the current School of Educa
tion building, which was dedicated
on June 6,1938.
Cubberley, who died on Sept.
14, 1941, wrote more than 20 vol
umes on education administra
tion and the history of education.
He also edited the 100 volumes of
the "Riverside Textbooks in Edu
cation."
Green Library
Cecil H. Green is a prominent
philanthropist who has con
tributed to scholarships and en
dowments at more than 25 col
leges and universities.
Most anybody who has heard of
a calculator should be familiar
with Green's legacy — he is a co
founder of Texas Instruments and
is considered a pioneer in reflec
tion seismology. He has served on
the School of Earth Sciences advi
sory board and is a consulting geo
physics professor. He is also an
honorary life member of Associ
ates of Stanford University Li
braries.
Green donated $6 million for
the expansion of Green Library,
which was completed and dedicat
ed on April 11, 1980. He also do
nated money for a professorship
in geophysics and established the
Cecil and Ida Green graduate stu
dent fellowships in geophysics.
Although Green never was a
student at Stanford, he has deep
roots on the Farm. During the
19205, he worked at the Federal
Telegraph Co. in Palo Alto. Dur
ing this time, he became friends
wit h such Stanford figures as Ter
man and Herbert Hoover.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Dinkelspiel Auditorium —
home to various Stanford perfor

mances, shows and lecture classes
— was named after Florence Hell
man Dinkelspiel, wife of Lloyd W.
Dinkelspiel.
Lloyd Dinkelspiel was presi
dent of the Board of Trustees at
the time of the auditorium's con
struction. He earned his bache
lor's from Stanford in 1920.
Construction was made possi
ble by gifts from the Dinkelspiel
and Hellman families to memori
alize the late Florence Dinkelspiel.
The auditorium was dedicated
May 23, 1957, opening with the
West Coast debut of "The Ballad
of Baby Doe," a play by Pulitzer
Prize-winner Douglas Moore.
Annenberg Auditorium
Annenberg Auditorium, locat
ed in the Cummings Art Building,
is named after media tycoon Wal
ter Annenberg.
Annenberg donates large
amounts of money to major uni
versities across the nation. Born
March 1, 1908, he was editor and
publisher of The Philadelphia In
quirer and The Philadelphia
Daily News-Press. He founded
"Seventeen" magazine and "TV
Guide."
He has received numerous
awards for pioneering the concept
of presenting educational pro
gramming via television.
The auditorium was dedicated
in May 1969, along with the rest of
the new art building.
Storke Publications Building
Storke Student Publications
Building, which houses all stu
dent publications as well as Stan
ford News Service, was named
after Thomas Moore Storke, one
of the most well-known journal
ists ever to attend the University.
Storke graduated from Stan
ford in 1898 and later went on to
become editor and publisher of the
Santa Barbara News-Press. His
work on that newspaper earned
him the Lauterback Award from
the Nieman Foundation at Har
vard. He won the 1962 Pulitzer
Prize for editorial writing and the
Elijah Lovejoy Award for "coura
geous journalism" from Colby
College.
He made large donations to the
construction of the Storke build
ing, which was Finished and dedi
cated Nov. 20, 1964. A professor
ship in the Department of Com
munication was established in his
name in 1972, a year after he died.
Kresge Auditorium
Sebastian Spering Kresge,
founder of K-Mart, used the
wealth gained from his businesses
to contribute to various schools
and causes around the world
through the Kresge Foundation,
established in 1924.
Kresge has donated money to
510 colleges and universities.
Some of these donations include
$375,000 to the Graduate School
of Business at Harvard and money
for the Kresge Eye Institute at
Wayne State University. There
also are several other Kresge Au
ditoriums.
The foundation gave more than
$1 million for construction of the
new $11.9 million Law School
building at Stanford, which was
dedicated in September 1975.
