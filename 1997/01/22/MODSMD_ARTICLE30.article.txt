# Look out Pac-10 zebras
## Todd blows whistle on poor officiating 
### 
Note: The following letter was
sent today to Booker Turner,
supervisor of men's basketball
officials for the Pacific 10
Conference.
To Mr. Turner, whom it
should concern:
Over the last year, many
sports fans and media have cited
different reasons for the decline

of college basketball. Some say it
is simply the sheer number of
superstars bolting for the NBA
(Newborn Baby Association)
that is taking the magic out of
the NCAA. Others say the prob
lem lies with coaches like Jerry
Tarkanian and Bob Muggins
who have replaced the "no-pass,
no-play" rule with the "no
parole, no-plav" standard.
However, the apparent
decline in Pac-10 basketball does
not lie with the players, nor with
the coaches. No, it lies with your
officials and their insistence on
turning every Pac-10 men's bas
ketball game into an exercise in
refereeing futility.
Now before I go on, I must
point out two things. First, I
used to referee high school bas
ketball in Memphis, Tenn., in
leagues which have featured
such pros as Elliot Perry, Todd
Day and Anfernee Hardaway. I
was taught by current and for
mer college officials who had ref
ereed in the old Metro Confer
ence and were, at the time, offi
ciating in the Great Midwest
Conference. So it is important
for you to understand, Mr.
Turner, that I am not criticizing
as a layman — I know the rules
of basketball and 1 know how to
referee basketball games. What
shocks me is that the majority of
your officiating crew has demon
strated that they know neither.
Secondly, I have closely fol
lowed Pac-10 basketball for four
years now, and 1 can honestly

say that the officiating has got
ten worse over the past few years
— a feat I thought impossible
four years ago. Given the fact
that poor officiating is now over
shadowing the athletes and ruin
ing league games and that your
reluctance to solve the problem
is leading to another poor season
of Pac-10 hoops, I feel it is my
duty to inform you of a few fun
damental problems that seem to
crop up in each game.
Through my experience, I
know that sometimes refs miss
calls — even the best do — and
that many calls in the game of
basketball are judgment calls,
most notably the block, charge
call, which no Pac-10 official has
seemed to master. However, of
greater import is the fact that
Pac-10 officials have made every
call into a judgment call.
Some officials have gone the
extra mile, too, and taken some
bad calls and made them their
own. For example, there's the
Bob Garibaldi "walking" call
that seems to crop up in the odd
est places — just never when
there is actually a walk. Then
there's the Andy Rios "offensive
foul" call, that often appears
without any player contact and
usually disrupts the entire flow
of the game. And who can forget
the blatant disregard for the
"over-the-back" call shown con
sistently by others such as Bill
Gianquinto, Mark Reischling
and Tommy Nunez. Let me tell
you, Mr. Turner, fans just love
that illegal contact which can
turn the tide of a game.
I really don't know from
where the problem stems. I don't
know if these guys have simply
forgotten the rules, don't care
any more or really want to ruin
the games for the fans. I am seri
ous when I say that I know peo
ple who have turned televised
games off this season because of
the officiating. Are you kidding
me? Officials are supposed to go
unnoticed. Officials are sup
posed to keep the game moving.
Officials are supposed to keep
players from getting hurt.
Nowhere does it say in any
rule book that 1 have read that
officials are supposed to make a
game so painful that fans would
prefer a good root canal surgery
