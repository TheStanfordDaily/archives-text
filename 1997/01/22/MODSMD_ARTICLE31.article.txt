# Time change leads to hockey's split
## 
### Blake Thompson Contributing writer 
Despite adverse conditions,
the men's hockey team was able
to salvage a split with Oregon
last weekend in Eugene. The
Cardinal was defeated 6-3 Fri
day but came back to defeat the
Ducks the next night 4-3.
The team stepped out of vans
Friday to discover that the game
time had been moved up by 45
minutes and the Cardinal had
missed its practice time. The
game was originally scheduled to
start at 8:45 p.m., but because of
the World Broomball Champi
onships later that night, the
start was moved up to 8 p.m.
The team was forced to step
onto the ice with tight muscles
and full stomachs from the plane
ride. The men did not receive
any warmup time, and at 8:05
p.m. the puck was dropped.
Understandably, the Card was a
little sluggish, and sophomore
Tom Terbell was the only Cardi
nal skater to find the net in the
first two periods as Oregon took
a 6-1 lead.
"We just looked dead on the
ice, and we weren't controlling
the puck," said captain Evan
Asano.
The Card was able to add two
late third-period goals by for
ward Chuck Glew and Asano,
which seemed to help the team
heading into Saturday night.
"We came out a lot better in
the third period, and it gave us a
positive outlook going into the
next game," Asano said.
Also working against the Car
dinal was the fact that the team
played without coach Ernie Fer
rari, who did not make the trip
due to personal reasons. In
effect, the team was coached by
the captains both nights. The
captains and the backup goalie
were required to make the line
changes, and it took the team
some time to adjust.
"It was definitely a real team
bonding experience though,"

said freshman defenseman Mike
Sloan.
The team fared well after
recovering from Friday's slow
start, but Ferrari hopes to be
back behind the bench for the
games this weekend against San
Jose State.
On Saturday night, the more
rested Cardinal squad was able
to bounce back and defeat the
Ducks 4-3. The Cardinal came
out fired up and a little angry
after Friday night's mishap and
rushed to a 3-1 lead.
"We came out and played an
entirely different game than Fri
day night," Asano said. But the
Ducks, currently in second place
in the Pacific 8 Conference, bat
tled back to tie the game at 3-3 in
the third period.
Glew, with an assist from
Asano, put the puck past the
Oregon goalie for the game-win
ning goal with 1 minute, 14 sec
onds remaining in regulation.
That late goal in Eugene sal
vaged the Cardinal a split with
the Ducks and kept the team in
position to qualify for the Pac-8
playoffs in Februaiy and then
eventually for nationals. The
team began the Pac-8 season
with seven wins before its first
conference loss to California in
November, and with a split at
Oregon the Cardinal continues
to lead the Pac-8 with a record of
9-2-1 in the conference.
The West region consists of
the Pac-8 and one other confer
ence, and the region will qualify
two teams for nationals later in
early March. Although the win
ner of the Pac-8 is not guaran
teed a spot at nationals, the Car
dinal's perch at the top of its
conference puts the team in a
good position to qualify.
This Friday and Saturday
night, the team faces San Jose
State, a squad Stanford knows
little about. The Spartans
defeated the Cardinal in 1996,
but the men are confident about
their ability to avenge that
defeat this year.
