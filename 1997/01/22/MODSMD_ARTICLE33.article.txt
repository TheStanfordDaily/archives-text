# Scrummers slay San Luis Obispo

### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
Despite handing a heavy 31-13
loss to Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
last Saturday on Maloney Field,
the men's rugby team learned that
more work will be needed if it
wants to advance to the playoffs
later in the season.
Senior captain Joe Clayton
earned 10 points for the team by
scoring two tries. Senior Jason
White also brought in two tries for
the Cardinal and sophomore Don
Donester scored one try against the
Mustangs.
Cal Poly has become the Cardi
nal's biggest rival in the sport next
to California, making the game
that much more intense.
But this strong victory may
have only proven that the team still
has a long way to go to become
truly competitive, according to
head coach Franck Boivert.
"We won basically only on indi
vidual efforts, which says a lot
about our team performance,"
Boivert said. "They were all tiying
to shine. So therefore it was
extremely poor, and the ball con
trol was very poor.
"We have to practice much more
discipline-oriented and team-ori
ented," Boivert said.
Quality of play was also reduced
by bad field conditions, caused
mainly by recent rain and wear
from recreational activity on Mal
oney Field.
"I think more than anything the
game kind of showed us our weak

nesses and showed us we had a lot
of room to improve," Clayton said.
"We have a lot of individuals who,
when they carry the ball, go too far
and almost run away from their
sport, so it makes it difficult for us
to recover the ball in a tackle situa
tion."

Refining the skills needed to win
in rugby is made more difficult by
the fact that the sport is not a
major industry in the United
States.
"Rugby's a tough game because
it's not like we can sit down in front
of the TV and watch the NFL,"

Clayton said. "We can't learn from
the older guys, the guys who really
are good at it in the U.S. So hope
fully we'll be able to watch some
films and learn from other people."
The men's second team also
defeated the Mustangs' second
squad 35-5.
