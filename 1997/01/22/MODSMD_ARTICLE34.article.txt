## THE 						ROAD TO MARS Spacecraft to study Mars Researchers hope to learn of planet's nature 
### April Kao 
To take a trip to Tahoe, you
can afford to pack lightly, stuff
a few dollars in your back pock
et and plan your whole stay in a
matter of minutes.
To take a trip to Mars, how
ever, requires tons of luggage,
billions of dollars and years of

planning Hardly your weekend
getaway.
Since the successful relay
tests conducted between Stan
ford's Space Telecommunica
tions and Radio Science (STAR)
Lab and the Mars Global Sur
veyor (MGS) last November,
the MGS spacecraft has been
on its way to Mars, traveling up
to a million kilometers a day.
Communication tests were
performed late last fall in order
to test the spacecraft's ability
to relay test results conducted
on the Martian surface back to
scientists on Earth. MGS is
expected to reach Mars in mid-
September 1997, after travel
ing for 10 months.
For the first six months
after arrival, the spacecraft will
adjust its orbit, not conducting
investigations of the planet
itself until March 1998. MGS
will then perform experiments
for one Martian year (687
Earth days), until late 1999.
But why go to Mars?
"We live on a planet between
two others" of extreme con
trast, explained Electrical
Engineering Prof. Leonard
Tyler, director of STAR Labs
and the MGS radio science

team leader.
"Venus is as hot as the
inside of a self-cleaning oven,
and Mars is as cold as Dante's
hell. We don't understand how
these planets are so different,"
Tyler said.
By studying these two neigh
boring planets scientists can
better understand the state of

the Earth. This has become
especially important in the age
of the greenhouse effect and
other environmental threats.
Five main components of the
spacecraft will conduct investi
gations of the red planet:
• While in orbit, MGS will be
able to see the entire surface of
Mars in a day. The Mars
Orbital Camera (MOC) will
produce a daily image of the
surface and atmosphere of the
planet, as well as narrow-angle
images of objects as small as 2
meters to 3 meters across.
• The Mars Orbital Laser
Altimeter (MOLA) will mea
sure the shape of Mars, using
the echo from a pulse of light to
determine MGS's distance
from the center of the planet.
• By mapping the intensity
of infrared radiation coming
from the surface, the Thermal
Emission Spectrometer (TES)
will determine the mineralogy
of Mars, as well as its weather
and climate.
• A magnetometer will
establish whether Mars has a
magnetic field and / or a metal
core. Data will help put togeth
er Mars' ancient history.
• The final component,

Radio Science,
will be conduct
ed by Stanford's
radio science
team, led by Tyler

It will study the
Martian atmosphere

by measuring the
changes caused by the
atmosphere on radio

waves given off by MGS. The
same radio system will also
track the motion of the space -

craft to provide information about
Mars' gravity field.
Based on these investigations,
scientists hope to apply data from
Mars' past history to the Earth's
current status and future.
Data collected on this mission
will help plan future missions, as
well as the selection of a landing
site. MGS will also make possible
in-orbit relay communications for
Mars landers and atmospheric ve
hicles.
Mars was chosen because it is

accessible, as well as popular.
So when will a manned mission
depart? "Not in the foreseeable fu
ture," Tyler said.
"I think there are philosophical
and romantic reasons for setting
up colonies on Mars but not scien
tific reasons. We have only a hand
ful of data so far. . . . Besides,
Mars is not a very hospitable place
— a warm day on Mars is an aver
age day on Antarctica."
Research will continue, howev
er.
"I think student participation
in [electrical engineering] is im
portant," Tyler said. "We expect
to hire students to help with oper
ations starting next year."
