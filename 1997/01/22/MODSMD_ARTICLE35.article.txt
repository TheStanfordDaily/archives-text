# Conquering the Martians
## Scenario may be reality in distant future

A civilization

from a distant

planet in the solar
i system has dam
aged its environ
ment, so much that

its survival is now threatened.
With billions of years of techno
logical advance, it has been able
to perfect interplanetary travel.
Having found another promising
planet, it is preparing to invade.
Science fiction? No. Here is the
scenario of the — very real —
attack of Mars by Earth.
Years of peace
Before their planet came
under the threat of invasion by
the human civilization, the
(hypothetical) Martians had
enjoyed billions of years of peace.
But life wasn't necessarily
pleasant. Until recent years, life
on Mars had been more threat
ened by harsh environmental
conditions than by an invasion.
According to Geophysics Prof.
Norman Sleep, who studies the
early history of Mars and Earth,
Mars was once a more hospitable
planet than it is now.
"Mars had a warmer climate,"
he said. "Liquid water could exist.
It was not much harsher than
Antarctica." The scientific com
munity agrees that large canyons
and riverbeds, now dry, provide
evidence that water once flowed
freely on the surface of Mars.
Now, life at the surface of
Mars would have to function in a
high-carbon dioxide, low-oxygen,
low-nitrogen atmosphere. Mar

tians would have to resist intense
ultraviolet radiation from the
sun, low temperature and low
atmospheric pressure. They
would also have to live without
liquid water.
"If there was water only one
day a year, there would still be
water at the subsurface — it is
warm inside," Sleep explained.
"On Mars, the habitable range
would be deeper than on Earth."

On Earth, too, humans are
starting to discover life in very
unlikely environments: in frozen
lakes in Antarctica, a mile below
the Earth's surface and in ther
mal vents.
The invasion begins
Hidden from the harsh surface
conditions, Martians were also
invisible to early human explor
ers.
Humans have tried to find evi
dence of life on Mars ever since
they discovered channels on the
Martian surface. By 1960, the
United States and Soviet Union
were technologically ready to
explore the planet remotely. In
the following 15 years, they sent
at least two dozen unmanned
probes on the nearly 50 million
mile journey to Mars.
The most threatening mis
sions were the Viking 1 and 2
probes, launched by the National
Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration in 1975 The two orbiters
sent landers that successfully
i eached the Mart um surface and
took pictures of the surface.
But, despite their beauty, the
pictures revealed a desolate envi
ronment. Furthermore, biologi
cal experiments carried out on
Mars by the landers failed to
show signs of life.
From 1975 to the late 1980s,
Martians enjoyed a renewed peri

od of peace. The only signs of the
early humans' invasion were a
number of spaceship wrecks pol
luting the planet.
Capture them alive!
But human life forms happen
to have big brains, which make
them capable of logical reasoning.
Some of the humans with the
highest capabilities of reasoning
are called scientists.

During the years they left
Mars alone, scientists on Earth
were perfecting their techniques
for interplanetary travel. They
were looking for unknown life
forms on their own planet. Most
importantly, they were analyzing
Martian meteorites found on
Earth.
One of those meteorites, a 4.5-
billion-year-old rock, was ejected
from Mars 15 million years ago
and landed on Antarctica 13,000
years ago Having survived its
ejection and impact with Earth, it
finally fell in the hands of a team
of Stanford, NASA and other sci
entists, who found it contained
incriminating evidence.
Chemistry Prof Richard Zare,
for instance, said his group found
"carbonates that form between
boiling and freezing tempera
tures. This is an indication of
life."
To find more evidence that
there were once life forms on
Mars similar to primitive bacteria
living on Earth, Zare's team will
now search for amino acids in the
carbonated areas of the mete
orite.
Before going to Mars, he said,
scientists should continue to
study meteorites and life on
Earth. "I don't think we under
stand life on Earth. Our concepts
