# Scientists isolate fruit fly gene responsible for sexual behavior
## 
### Kaushik Mukherjee 
It seems that most of the time the only
dating scene at Stanford exists in the test
tubes and petri dishes of the Biology Depart
ment.
In particular, a research group led by
Biology Prof. Bruce Baker in collaboration
with laboratories at three other major uni
versities has isolated and cloned a previous
ly elusive gene. This gene, called the fruit
less or fru gene, has been shown to control
almost all sexual behavior in the male fruit
Hy.
The fruit fly, or Drosophila melanogaster,
has been well studied by scientists, largely
because its short life cycle and prolific repro
duction allow scientists to quickly examine
the effects of any genetic mutations. In par
ticular, radiation has been used to study the
effects of mutations on the behavior of the
fruit fly.
Kulbir Gill, working at Yale University in
the early 19605, discovered that a radiation
induced mutation made some male fruit flies
unable to distinguish males from females.
Therefore, these affected males adopted
bisexual behavior, sometimes forming long
chains of flies, each male trying to court the
one in front of it. This is a dramatic change
from normal mating behavior, which
involves an elaborate set of courtship ges
tures in the form of a dance accompanied by
"mUsic" performed by the vibration of the
male's wings.
Baker has been studying the sexual
behavior of fruit flies since the 19605, when
he was a graduate student at the University
of Washington. Along with Jeff Hall of Bran
deip University, Barbara Taylor of Oregon

State University and Steven Wasserman of
the University of Texas Southwestern Medi
cal Center, Baker concentrated his efforts to
isolate and replicate the fruitless gene.
The gene turned out to be at least 70
times larger than any previously examined
gene in the fruit fly. The sheer size of genet
ic material which existed in the gene. Baker
said, presented some major cloning difficul
ties.
Focusing on the transcripts, or products,
of the fruitless gene, Baker, with the help of
postdoctoral fellow Lisa Hynei and foui
undergraduates, realized that it actually
controlled other genes.
From this research, Baker was able to
draw three conclusions:
• The fruitless gene is a master gene
which controls nearly all aspects of sexual
behavior in the male fruit fly
• The gene works with another gene,
called t he doublesex gene, in its regulation of
sexual behavior.
• The fruitless gene is ver> efficient, it
exerts its influence by controlling as few as
500 of the millions of ner.t cells in a fruit
fly's nei vous system.
Because the mating behavior of the
female fruit fly is much more subtle than
that of the male, the resiaichers were
unable to detei mine the effects of mutations
on the behavior of female flic . They are now
conducting more detailed studies on the
female fruit fly to try and extend their con
clusions to both sexes.
"Our research establishes .» precedent for
complex behavioi being laid down by a single
gene," Baker said. "It was previously
thought that many genes worked together to
create instinctive behaviois. The conclu

sions of the research group illustrate that
genes are more powerful than we have ever
dreamed
However, Baker and other researchers
are reluctant to extend any of their conclu
sions to human mating behavior.
Although studies of identical twins have
concluded that genetics does play a part in
an individual's sexual orientation, other fac
tors such as education and environment play
a much larger role in human life than in the
life of a tly. As a result, Baker terms any
relation of his work to human sexual behav
ioi as pure skepticism."
