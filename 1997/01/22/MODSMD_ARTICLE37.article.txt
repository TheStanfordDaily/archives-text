Cost of life-saving implants debated

How much would, or should,
someone pay for a few extra
years of life?
That question has come
under debate as the result of a
new Stanford study led by Asst.
Internal Medicine Prof. Dou
glas Owens on the cost-effec-

tiveness of the implantable cardioverter defibril
lator (ICD).
The ICD is implanted in the chests of people at
risk of sudden cardiac death, where it administers
life-saving electric shocks when it detects that the
heart is beating irregularly. Although effective,
the treatment costs up to $60,000 per patient,
excluding maintenance and other long-term
expenses.
Owens' team, working with Health Research
and Policy Project Director Kathryn McDonald,
found that use of the ICD would have to lower the
annual risk of death by at least 30 percent com
pared with the cheaper standard drug treatment in
order to be cost-effective.
Various small clinical trials have provided con
flicting results on the benefits of ICD treatment
vs. drug treatment. But Owens said in a press
release that the final results of several large clini
cal trials should be available within the next two

years. At that point, the effectiveness of the ICD
can be determined for certain.

Warning: get your exereise

Lack of exercise can be even
more dangerous to health than
tobacco use, suggest the results
of a new Stanford study pub
lished in the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
According to an editorial writ
ten by David Buchner of the

University of Washington, "A case can be made that
physical inactivity is the No. 1 health problem"
among older adults.
"If the data from the study ... are generaliz
able, they suggest we can achieve a 50 percent
reduction in 18 months in one of the top two
health problems in some subgroups of older adults
by purchasing an exercise booklet, walking shoes,
cuff weights and a short-term startup exercise
class followed by home-based exercise with tele
phone checkups,"he added.
The Stanford study showed that older adults
complaining of sleep problems slept much better
after exercising 30 to 40 minutes a day. Further
more, the exercising elderly took half as long to fall
asleep as they had previously.
