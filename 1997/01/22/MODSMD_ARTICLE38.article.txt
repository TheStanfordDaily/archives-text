# The 						good, the bad and the ozone

Q. If ozone is so bad for us
• near the ground but good
for us in the upper atmosphere,
why can't we just send it all up
there?
A, Well, unless someone wants
• to build a 15-mile-long pipe
that goes straight up into the
ozonosphere, that's probably a
pretty stupid idea. However, it
does bring up a good point about
what ozone does.
First of all, there aren't two
types of ozone. The "good ozone"
in the ozonosphere and the "bad
ozone" near the ground are the
same chemical substance.
Technically, if you could sepa

rate the ozone down here from all
the other nasty stuff that comes
along with it and send it up into
the ozonosphere, it would blend
right in with the "good ozone"
that is already up there. The
problem is that the atmosphere is
really, really huge, and the
amount of ozone we have down
here wouldn't make a very signif
icant contribution to what's up
there.
It was a good try, though.
So what makes ozone good up
there but bad down here? Essen
tially, the difference is because
ozone is a very reactive form of
oxygen. The more familiar form,
or allotrope, of pure oxygen is
molecular oxygen, made of two
oxygen atoms. This is the stuff we
breath to survive. It is good.
Ozone, on the other hand, is
composed of three oxygen atoms
bonded together. Ozone is a pow
erful oxidizing agent, a nasty irri
tant and a general nuisance
around humans.
Down here near the ground,
ozone is produced through a vari
ety of methods. Electrical sparks
create ozone, which you can
detect as the strange smell
around bumper car arenas.
Ozone is also created by reac
tions of nitrogen oxides and
hydrocarbons in the lower atmo
sphere, mostly the result of man

made emissions from sources
such as automobile exhaust and
factories.
Ozone is the chief component
of smog, and many physical ail
ments have been attributed to it.
When humans are exposed to
high enough concentrations,
ozone can irritate the eyes and
mucus membranes and aggravate
respiratory problems.
In the upper atmosphere,
though, it's a totally different
story.
Ozone is created when ultravi
olet radiation splits molecular
oxygen into two oxygen atoms,
which then recombine with other
oxygen molecules to form ozone.
This ozone makes up the ozone
layer which everyone talks about.
Ozone in the upper atmo
sphere absorbs shortwave ultravi
olet light. If this high energy radi
ation were to make it through to
the surface of the earth, most life
on the planet would be killed.
At that point, you most proba
bly wouldn't care about how
much ozone you were sucking in
down near the surface. So it's a
good thing that the ozone is up
there, although it's still unfortu
nate to have it down here.
Of course, we could kill two
birds with one stone if we all
started driving 15-mile-high
bumper cars.
