# Bank of America branch opens
## 
### Connie Chang Contributing writer 
The grand opening yesterday
of the only Bank of America
branch on the Stanford campus
may mean more than just easier
access to ATM machines — it
may also mean increased com
petition for the other two banks
on campus.
The opening marks a reloca
tion for the Bank of America
branch, which used to occupy
space in the middle of the Stan
ford Shopping Center.
While the branch will contin
ue to do business with University
professors and staff members,
executives said they hope to in
crease business with Stanford
students.
According to Branch Manager
Ruby Galli, such an endeavor has
been difficult because of the Uni
versity's long-standing relation
ship with Wells Fargo, which has
a facility on campus that offers
more than just ATM machines
and is rooted within the Univer
sity. In addition, the Stanford
Federal Credit Union also hous
es several branches on campus,
the most visible one in Tresidder
Union.
The 4,000-square-foot Bank
of America facility, located at the
corner of Quarry and Arboretum
roads, houses two Versateller
machines and offers all the same
services as any branch of Bank of
America, said shopping center
Director David Longbine.
The cylindrically shaped
building incorporates the "most
up-to-date design features and
will provide state-of-the-art fi
nancial services," said Harvey

Raden, Bank of America's vice
president of corporate communi
cations.
The bank will also be offering
a new service targeted toward
foreign college students called
the BankAmericash Card, which
will allow parents to wire money
overseas directly into their chil
dren's accounts. The money can
then be accessed through any
ATM machine in the United
States at no cost, said Janice
Chong, secretary to the
U.S. / Asia liaison of Bank of

America.
The card will operate on a
global scale and is being intro
duced in stages starting with
Hong Kong, she added.
Students under 21 years of
age with a student ID card are
also offered a checking account
which will waive the monthly
service charge during the sum
mer months, said Galli.
The bank is open from 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m. Monday through Thurs
day, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Friday
and 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday.
