# What's my number?
## New area code in works for Bay Area 
### Nadia Elghohashi Staff writer 
With the growth in population
and a sharp increase in the number
of faxes, modems and cellular
phones, a shortage in telephone
numbers has moved the State Pub
lic Utilities Commission to add new
area codes to the Bay Area.
According to the Commission's
Senior Public Officer Dianne Dien
stein, "People want to be able to use
their faxes, modems, phones and
cellular phones, and establishing
new area codes is a way to meet
those demands."
The new area code, 650, will
apply to the area south of and in
cluding Daly City. San Francisco
and areas north of the city will keep
415.
Other areas which will be split
also include regions around San
Jose, with San Jose staying at 408

and Santa Cruz and Monterey
changing to an as of yet unknown
number, said Fred Hansson, fi
nance manager at Stanford's Dis
tributed Computing and Commu
nications Services.
"Basically, we've run out of pre
fixes," Hansson said. "A lot of peo
ple have gotten second phone lines,
and there aren't enough numbers
to go around. Within the last 10
years, things have gone through the
roof with new services requiring
area codes."
At a conference last July, the
commission decided to split the re
gion south of Daly City, thereby
generating more numbers, Hans
son said.
The change in area code will af
fect more than just the phone num
bers, he added. "Everything we do
will be affected â€” modems and
faxes will have to be repro
grammed."
Hansson said there will be a
span of about six months, starting
in August, during which both the
new area code as well as the old one
will be in use. After Feb. 1, 1998,
however, only the new area code

will be in service.
"If you haven't made the change
before Feb. 1, you won't receive any
calls," Hansson said.
Although the problem appears
to have been alleviated by the new
area code, subsequent shortages of
numbers are not unlikely.
"With the current growth, we
expect another crunch in numbers
around 2020, when all existing as
signments will have been given
out," Hansson said. "The phone

company is discussing options now
which can address that possibility."
Dienstein said "number porta
bility" could be the solution the
phone companies are seeking.
Number portability would en
able people to move locations with
out having to change their phone
number.
"With number portability, once
you have a number, you take it with
you wherever you go," Dienstein
said. "That could be a solution."
