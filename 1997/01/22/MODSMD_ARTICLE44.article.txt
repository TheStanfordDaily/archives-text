Improvements to Escondido
Village continue at a steady pace
after the University began two
years ago to more systematically
address complaints that had piled
up in previous years.
The heart of the enhancement
is the wholesale renovation of the
old apartment buildings in Escon
dido. Undertaken as part of the
campus-wide Capital Improve
ment Program, this effort to date
has led to a comprehensive
makeover of about 630 of the near
ly 1,300 apartments.
According to Graduate Facili
ties Manager Lynn Glick, this
marks the fifth year of the project,
which targets about 170 apart

ments per year. The goal is to com
plete the renovations in eight
years.
"At the veiy least, we're on
schedule if not a little bit ahead,"
Director of Graduate Residences
Christine Griffith said.
The University has also made a
number of other improvements to
the exterior lighting and the fences
in the area.
"These are things that I think
we have been proactive about,"
said Rodger Whitney, associate di
rector of Housing and Dining Ser
vices for Student Housing. They
did not result from complaints by
residents, he explained.
Glick added that the University
also plans to repaint the exteriors of
the buildings and enhance the land
scaping in the near future. After

spending a lot of money on the inte
riors of the residences, she said,
"Now we're going to expand out."
According to surveys done by
the University, students are happy
with the renovated apartments,
Whitney said. Even the apart
ments yet to undergo the
makeover have received new re
frigerators and stoves and in-room
network connections, he added.
Complaints about the cleanli
ness of apartments when the old
residents move out and new ones
move in also are down from their
high numbers two years ago.
"I've not heard from students
that they're moving into apart
ments that are dirty," Griffith
said.
According to Whitney, im
proved communication between

the University and students helps
explain the better conditions and
higher satisfaction felt by stu
dents. The Graduate Housing Ad
visory Committee, composed of
staff and students, has been up
and running since last year. The
University is also trying to take ad
vantage of e-mail, and it hopes to
do an online survey, Whitney said.
"We need to be sensitive to the
different needs of the population
that lives here," Griffith added.
Remodeling creates "a very dif
ficult scheduling and logistical
problem," Whitney admitted. Yet
considering the high apartment
rental costs in the area, there is no
choice but to continue with the up
grades while trying to minimize
the negative impact on students
caused by construction, he said.
