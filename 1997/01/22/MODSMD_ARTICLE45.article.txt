# Faculty debate merger implications

William Wara answered questions from Stan
ford's School of Medicine faculty last night
about the recent merger between Stanford
Health Services and the UCSF Medical Center.
According to Wara, UCSF Stanford Health
Care, the newly created merged corporation,
will seek to emphasize both financial and acade
mic concerns while promoting cooperation be
tween the two organizations.
The USHC Board of Directors "will have
members that represent both business and aca
demic / clinical interests," Wara said at the
meeting.
Previously, several faculty members had ex
pressed concern that the merger might concen
trate on financial matters at the expense of the
schools' academic priorities.
Wara agreed that more could be done, saying,
"We definitely need to hear the word 'academic'
mentioned more in the merger discussions."
In addition, Wara said the merger would help

facilitate "collaboration and common protocols
between the two schools." He cited areas rang
ing from sharing library databases tc collabo
rating in clinical investigations as possible areas
of cooperation.
Stanford Medical School Dean Eugene Bauer
expounded on Wara's comments, citing four
major areas in which USHC would try to incor
porate the interests of all of those involved.
In the area of business operations, USHC
will attempt to "select a CEO or at least define
the selection process for choosing one" at its
Jan. 31 meeting, Bauer said.
Second, Bauer stressed the general consen
sus "that broad faculty involvement is needed"
in formulating policy and making decisions.
On the issue of academic programs, Bauer
again emphasized the need for "faculty input to
decide issues of integration" such as integrat
ing portions of both universities' cancer cen
ters.
Finally, Bauer commented on the need for
certain areas "to remain within the realm of
each school," such as each school's policy over
the treatment of intellectual property.

However, several questions about the diffi
culty of the merger still remain. Genetics Prof.
Uta Francke, co-chair of the Academic Priori
ties and Strategies for Collaboration Commit
tee, pointed out the financial difficulty of com
bining the residencies of both schools. She
noted that while Stanford pays its residencies
through Stanford Health Services, UCSF uses
University of California funds.
How this financing problem will be resolved
has yet to be determined, Wara conceded.
Asst. Medicine Prof. Linda Boxer, co-chair
of the Oversight and Coordinating Committee,
questioned the extent to which the clinical and
academic programs of the schools could be
matched or combined. Again, Wara said this
possibility has yet to be discussed at length.
In the end, however, Senate Chair and Med
icine and Molecular Pharmacology Prof. Ken
neth Melmon noted the potential benefits that
the merger could offer. By encouraging cooper
ation and not competition between UCSF and
Stanford, the merger will offer "exciting op
portunities that might not have surfaced oth
erwise."
