# Nom Comm appointment sparks debate
## ASSU discusses naming of former Review editor to Program Board 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Senators fell into rancorous de
bate at last night's ASSU Senate
meeting over the appointment of
junior Eric Jackson, a former editor
in chief of The Stanford Review, to
the ASSU Program Board.
The Program Board is responsi
ble for proposing general fee alloca
tion budgets for senate approval.
Jackson, contended ASSU Sena
tor Alane Murdock, is unfit to sit on
the board because he was "editor of
one of the most outspoken political
organizations on campus and was
outspoken against various student
groups."
Murdock indicated she would
not opt to give Jackson power to de
termine which student groups get
ASSU funds.
"I have had dealings with The
Review," Murdock said. "I really
don't trust him."
ASSU Senator Doug Natelson,

however, quickly came to Jackson's
defense.
"If a person gives us their word
that their personal opinions are not
going to affect their professional de
cisions, we should take them at
their word," Natelson said.
During the interview process,
Jackson told members of the Nom
inations Commission, the body re
sponsible for appointing students
to committees such as the Program
Board, that he would view the bud
gets with impartiality and was
more than capable of being unbi
ased.
If appointed, Jackson would be
one of eight members on the board.
Other senators offered that
Jackson has far less to gain by ma
nipulating decisions than other
members who sat on the board in
past years.
