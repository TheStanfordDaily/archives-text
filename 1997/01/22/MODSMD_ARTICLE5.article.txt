# Nom Comm appointment sparks debate
## ASSU discusses naming of former Review editor to Program Board 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Senators fell into rancorous de
bate at last night's ASSU Senate
meeting over the appointment of
junior Eric Jackson, a former editor
in chief of The Stanford Review, to
the ASSU Program Board.
The Program Board is responsi
ble for proposing general fee alloca
tion budgets for senate approval.
Jackson, contended ASSU Sena
tor Alane Murdock, is unfit to sit on
the board because he was "editor of
one of the most outspoken political
organizations on campus and was
outspoken against various student
groups."
Murdock indicated she would
not opt to give Jackson power to de
termine which student groups get
ASSU funds.
"I have had dealings with The
Review," Murdock said. "I really
don't trust him."
ASSU Senator Doug Natelson,

however, quickly came to Jackson's
defense.
"If a person gives us their word
that their personal opinions are not
going to affect their professional de
cisions, we should take them at
their word," Natelson said.
During the interview process,
Jackson told members of the Nom
inations Commission, the body re
sponsible for appointing students
to committees such as the Program
Board, that he would view the bud
gets with impartiality and was
more than capable of being unbi
ased.
If appointed, Jackson would be
one of eight members on the board.
Other senators offered that
Jackson has far less to gain by ma
nipulating decisions than other
members who sat on the board in
past years.
ASSU Appropriations Commit
tee Chair Emilv Andrus told sena
tors that in the past, treasurers of
groups have had seats on the board
hut have been prohibited from vot
ing on appropriations to their orga
nization.
The Review, however, is an inde
pendent publication and is not
funded through any arm of the
ASSU.
Murdock was not persuaded by
such arguments.
"The Review is traditionally not
a professional organization, and
they have history of misrepresent

ing issues and quotes," Murdock
said. "There is some reason to be
lieve he has a chip on his shoulder
regarding some groups and would
not act impartially."
Natelson, usually among the
senate's calmest members, became
incensed at that accusation.
"Just because someone is opin
ionated, it does not preclude them
from behaving in a professional
manner," Natelson said.
"Part of the Fundamental
Standard is that when people give
their word, we are supposed to
trust them," he said. "I think it's
sad that because of [his association
with The Review], we assume he is
a liar."

Other members joined Natelson
in urging the senate to confirm
Jackson. ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson offered: "He's not
a bad guy." And ASSU President
Bill Shen said unless Jackson was
still on The Review payroll, "There
is no reason we shouldn't approve
him."
Jackson was the only applicant
for the board seat vacated by senior
Jeff Giesea. Giesea resigned from
the board to succeed Jackson as ed
itor in chief of The Review last fall.
Despite objections, however, the
senate postponed debate on the
issue so that it could invite Jackson
to provide testimony before its next
meeting.
