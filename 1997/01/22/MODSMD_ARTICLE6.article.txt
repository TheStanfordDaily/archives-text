### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
ASSU President Bill Shen list
ed his plans for ensuring the re
sponsible spending of student
money during his State of the As

Shen said, "Our No. 1 responsibil

ASSU is spent responsibly, Shen
said he intends to institute an au

or the Community Service Board.
The random audits will be run
out of Shen's office.

crease publicity regarding the spe
cial-fee refund program, which
gives students the option to have
the special-fee money charged on
their University bill returned.
"Students want this option but
don't know where to find it," Shen
said.

Shen and ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson last week.
Shen also plans to propose the
creation of a political board in
order to "reduce political apathy"
on campus. The proposed board
