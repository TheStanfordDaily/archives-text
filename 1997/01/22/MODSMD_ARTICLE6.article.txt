# Shen outlines plans for ASSU
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
ASSU President Bill Shen list
ed his plans for ensuring the re
sponsible spending of student
money during his State of the As
sociation address last night.
In addition, he stressed the
need for the ASSU to continue ex
amining student academic con
cerns.
For the remainder of his term,
Shen said, "Our No. 1 responsibil
ity to students is as overseers of
student money."
In order to assure that the spe
cial-fee money students pay to the
ASSU is spent responsibly, Shen
said he intends to institute an au
diting program for all student or
ganizations that receive money
from special fees, the ASSU Publi
cations Board, the Program Board
or the Community Service Board.
The random audits will be run
out of Shen's office.

Shen also asked ASSU Finan
cial Manager John Hall to in
crease publicity regarding the spe
cial-fee refund program, which
gives students the option to have
the special-fee money charged on
their University bill returned.
"Students want this option but
don't know where to find it," Shen
said.
Citing the ASSU's responsibili
ty for the academic needs of stu
dents, Shen emphasized the need
for space for student organiza
tions to meet and for University
support for interdisciplinary ma
jors. These two issues are part of
the University for Students cam
paign, which was launched by
Shen and ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson last week.
Shen also plans to propose the
creation of a political board in
order to "reduce political apathy"
on campus. The proposed board
would receive special fees to fund
partisan organizations, which
cannot receive money from the
Program Board.
"Because we cannot support
any particular political agenda
with student money, we have
placed rules upon what type of
programming the [ASSU] can
support," he said. "We run the
risk of stifling any sort of political
discussion out of a paranoia that
some students will object."
Shen said he also intends to im
prove student safety by commis
sioning a research project to in
vestigate the University's rela
tionship with the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department,
which is the police authority on
campus.
According to Shen, the priori
ties of the Santa Clara Police and
the University's own police offi

cers have been "shifted at the ex
pense of student safety." He added
that police are being primarily
used to issue parking tickets.
Shen said he intends to propose
a constitutional amendment
which would reform the method
by which ASSU candidates are
elected by lowering the number of
candidates that students can vote
for from 15 to five. Under the cur
rent system, students "vote for
whom [they] know first, then go
down the line and click on the last
seven randomly," he said.
Shen praised the ASSU's work
thus far in his term, saying, "We
have much to be proud of."
He commended the ASSU for
its work on the Forget U.S. News
Coalition, a voter registration
drive in October and reviewing
the Stanford Judicial Charter.
Shen also praised the business
side of the ASSU, whose Stanford
Student Enterprises has exceeded
"every expectation for revenues
this year" and is "on the road to
operating in the black," he said.
