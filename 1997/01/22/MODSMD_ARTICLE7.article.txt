The Real World, Stanford.

Winter quarter is underway,
and Real World member Arthur
Chang is digging in with a
vengeance. Last Saturday, Arthur
grabbed a shovel, donned old
clothes and took his turn at the

Synergy compost pile.
Compost pile duty, he explained,
entails shoveling the organic matter
from one pile to the next, with each
pile being at a different stage of
decay. When someone commented
that the pile has been exceptionally
fragrant recently, Arthur bashfully
admitted that maybe he was sup
posed to put hay in with the com
post.
Although the other Real
Worlders have not yet gotten to dig
into the compost piles, they have
not been lacking in agricultural ac
tivities.
Over break, Erik Nordhagen
was enlisted to work on his grand
father's farm in Oregon. Work on
the farm was especially hard this
winter, Erik said, because of big
storms. The fuel line froze on his
grandfather's truck, which is usu
ally used to drive the hay bales to
the cows. Erik had to resort to
dragging the bales to the cow pas
ture by hand.
"One day,"he said, "the cows
were all a little too rambunctious."
Because of the frozen fuel line, they
hadn't been fed in a while. When
the cows spotted their meal arriv
ing, they crowded around the gate.
As Erik delivered the hay, the cows
knocked each other out of the way

and Erik, caught in the feeding
frenzy, was "rammed in the rear
end."
Erik said he went flying and
landed in a fresh cow pie. Recovery
from the incident took him a week.
Scott Dollar, meanwhile, was
also communing with animals.
Scott, however, had no intention of
feeding them. If there was any belly
that was going to be filled, it was
his. With this in mind, Scott set out
over break on hunting and fishing
expeditions.
It seems that the outdoor world
is replete with mishaps. Scott's fa
ther had an unfortunate occur
rence on their father-son fishing
trip. After two days of fishing, Scott
was bringing the boat up the ramp
to hook it to the trailer while his fa
ther stood on the trailer guiding
him in. The engine on the boat quit,
though, and Scott lost control.
The sight of the boat heading
straight toward him shocked Scott's
father so much that he fell back
ward off of the trailer, hitting his
head on the truck during the fall.
At first, Scott's father assured
Scott that he was fine. Soon,
though, he was asking basic ques
tions, such as where they were and
what date it was.
In the emergency room, they
found that he had two broken ribs
and short-term memory loss. It
took two days for his memory to re
turn and, looking back, Scott said
the short time his dad couldn't re

member some things produced en
tertaining situations. For example,
Scott's father was very excited to
hear that he had a son who goes to
Stanford.
Back at Stanford, three of the
four Real Worlders are re-en
trenched in their Synergy digs. The
fourth Real Worlder, Mark Lo, has
vacated his spot at Synergy to
Arthur's new roommate, David So
ergel, in exchange for a spot at
Stanford in Oxford.
The house held another gruel
ing room-assignment meeting at
the beginning of the quarter. Dur
ing the meeting, most Synners
were assigned new rooms. The
three remaining Real Worlders,
however, didn't want to vacate
their rooms and were kindly al
lowed to stay.
Scott and Erik deliberately
chose their room at the beginning
of the year because they did not
want to move each quarter and
they have one of the least desirable
rooms in the house.
It's hard to understand why the
room is undesirable, though. The
space is enormous and has allowed
creativity in setup. quarter, the
beds were triple lofted because the
ceilings are so high and the bureaus
were placed in a line across the front
of the room to divide it. The unusu
al setup has been torn down this
quarter, though, because of concern
that it might be a fire hazard.
This quarter has seen transfor

mation of the front of the room into
a basketball court, complete with
boundary lines and a hoop over the
door.
If the noise gets to be a bit much
during games, it may only be as a
distraction from noises coming
from adjacent rooms. Scott said he
discovered the reason no one want
ed the room: The walls are paper
thin and shared with a bathroom
and the nookie room.
The group also discussed the ac
tivism they have observed in their
housemates. Arthur commented
that his new roommate, David, is a
member of Students for Environ
mental Action at Stanford and the
Free Burma Coalition. David's in
volvement, he said, is indicative of a
generally high level of involvement
throughout the house.
Before Mark left for Oxford,
they discussed how "activism is a
big thing for the residents," Arthur
said. "It is something that they feel
is important to stay involved in.
For us, it is important to stay in
volved in Christianity."
Scott commented that "when
we think of what's going to change
our world and what is going to
make our world better — in other
words, what merits activism — we
come up with different answers.
"Everybody needs a cause," he
said. "Working for a cause is a basic
need in life. The trick is to figure
out which causes are really worth
something to you."
