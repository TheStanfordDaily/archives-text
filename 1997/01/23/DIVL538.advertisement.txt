YOU ARE NOT YOUR RESUME
YOU ARE NOT
SLOGAN
YOU ARE NOT WHAT THEY THINK
It's in there. Somewhere. That double secret part of you. The part that
dreams and smolders in anticipation. The part that's itching and writninq with
the need to break out.
Well join the club. We mean it. Because that's just the kind of energy it takes to
create the world's best internetworking products.
Look in. Is there a character inside you who can't sleep because of what's
happening here?
That's the part of you we want to know. The Cisco that's inside you.
