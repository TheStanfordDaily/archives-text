So over break I watched an entire episode of "Oprah" for the first
time since Bth grade. Actually, I watched two entire episodes: the one
with Steven Spielberg and some Holocaust survivors and then the one
where they did a recap of the winning moments from the last year (Plus,
there was a dorky British guy talking about the "top ten" of various things
like snack foods. You know, popcorn vs. potato chips â€” it got kind of
tense.)
Now I may not be one to judge, but Oprah was so self-indulgent I
was shocked. She talked over her guests, told anecdotes about herself,
name-dropped and just generally preened Worshiping her as I do, I
was more than a little disturbed by all this. Plus, I'm not sure what to
think of her book club, where she single-handedly propels a novel onto
the best-seller list. Is this a good thing? Has her power gone too far? Is
it none of my business? Share your thoughts about daytime TV, female
role models, snack food or the dearth of an informed reading public in
the '90s by sending a classified to intermission@daily by midnight this
Sunday.
