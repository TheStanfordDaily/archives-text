"Failure is not an option."
Thousands of college students
pay Blockbuster $3.50 to rent
Apollo 13 and hear Ed Harris utter
those words; last night about 900
people heard the man whom Har
ris portrayed, Gene Kranz, speak
in Memorial Auditorium.
"I've seen the movie and it was
a drama, but hearing the real guy
tell it to you in a clear, cut-and-dry
way made a huge impression on
me," said community member An
drea Battle. "I loved hearing him
speak so factually."
Kranz was the leader of the
mission control crew for the Apol
lo 13 mission and also the flight di
rector for Apollo 11 's lunar land
ing.
"We fought every second of the
way to get [to the moon]," Kranz
said of Neil Armstrong's historic
Apollo 11 flight. "When we landed,
we had fulfilled the dream given to
us by John F. Kennedy. We had
fulfilled our obligation to a dead
president."
In his speech, Kranz touched
on subjects from his work, includ
ing both Project Mercury — where
he learned "that space flights com
mand personal commitment and a
team" — and the first test of an
Apollo spacecraft in 1967. There
his team "found the final two
words to our space vocabulary:
'tough' [and] 'competent.' "
Kranz focused the majority of
his discussion on Apollo 13 and the

"This is the story of my team,"
Kr.uiz said. "This is the story of ex
cellence.
"For about a minute and a half

thi eyes of a tiger,' and this is the
feeling you have when the only
word in your vocabulary is 'sur

1 le said the toughest problem in
the mission and lowest-morale mo

ment came with the shutting oft of
power, which consequently dimin
ished all chances of going to the
moon.
At one point it appeared the
spacecraft was going to land in the
Indian Ocean, and Russia offered to
rescue the crew because the United
States had no sliips in the area.
"In the peak of the Cold War,
Russians and the U.S. were work
ing together to get this crew home,"
Kranz said. "Literally the whole
world was."
Despite the "incredible amount
of mathematics involved" in get
ting the team home, all done with
paper, pencils and slide rules,
Kranz holds to his Catholic faith: "I
believe there was divine guidance
involved."
After parachuting into the Pacif
ic Ocean, the crew was rescued.
"Every individual in [mission

control] was crying," Kranz said.
One of the biggest problems for
NASA Kranz sees today is the lack
of chance taken to explore space.
Back then "our country under
stood there is no achievement with
out risk," Kranz said. "As a result of
the Challenger, we backed away
from taking risk."
Kranz is one of five speakers the
ASSU Speakers Bureau has invited
to Stanford this year.
"We try to bring a balance of
speakers," said Speakers Bureau
Director Grace Wang. "He's one of
those where the name recognition
isn't too high, but when you talk
about what he's done, everyone is
like 'Oh yeah ... Ed Harris ... the
movie.' "
"I was surprised at how good a
speaker he was," said sophomore
Brian Puskas. "He made it come
alive."
