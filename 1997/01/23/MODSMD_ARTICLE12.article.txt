GREENSBORO, N.C. <AP) — A jury yes
terday ordered ABC to pay Food Lion more
than $5.5 million for sending two reporters
undercover with cameras in their wigs for
an expose accusing the supermarket chain
of selling spoiled meat.
While Food Lion disputed the allegations
in the 1992 "Prime Time Live" report, it was
ABC's newsgathering methods that were at
issue in the federal trial. The jury earlier
found the network committed fraud, tres
passing and breach of loyalty.
But in the closely watched case that
opened a new line of legal attack against the
media — and put undercover reporting
itself on trial — Food Lion got far less than
the $52.5 million to $1.9 billion in punitive
damages it sought.
Juror Tony Kinton called the award a
"slap on the wrist."
"We weren't in there trying to handcufl
the media," explained Gregory Mack, fore
man of the jury that deliberated the dam
ages for six days. "We would not have gotten
the story if the media had not gone in."
Bruce Sanford, a First Amendment
lawyer in Washington, called the Food Lion
verdict emotional, irrational and unconsti
tutional and said it will force journalists to
think twice before doing investigative
pieces.
"It's punishing the messenger, plain and
simple," Sanford said.
The jury, in the second multimillion-dol
lar verdict against ABC in as many months.

ordered the network to pay $5.5 million and
its employees an additional $45,750.
ABC said it will appeal
ABC News president Roone Arledge
called the punitive damages troubling, not
ing they were about 4,000 times the amount
of compensatory damages.
"If large corporations were allowed to
stop hard-hitting investigative journalism,
the American people would be the losers,"
Arledge said in a statement.
The "Prime Time Live" report — narrat
ed by Diane Sawyer — accused Food Lion of
selling rat-gnawed cheese, expired meat and
old ham and fish that had been washed in
bleach to kill its smell.
Food Lion denied the allegations and said
it lost more than $1 billion in sales and stock
value because of the report. The judge ulti
mately barred the supermarket chain from
seeking compensation for its sales and stock
losses, and Food Lion was awarded only the
cost of hiring and paying the ABC workers
— $1,402 — in compensatory damages
Food Lion might have tried to recover
financially with a libel lawsuit, but that
would have required proving that the story
was false and that ABC knew it at the time.
ABC producers Lynn Dale and Susan
Barnett landed jobs as food handlers at
Food Lion and went to work with cameras
hidden in their wigs and microphones inside
their clothing. Small video decks were
strapped to their bodies and activated bv a
switch.
