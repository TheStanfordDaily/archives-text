# Clinton adviser knew of Asia link to Democrats in 1994
## Deposition contradicts White House account of Hubbel's controversial hiring by Indonesian company

WASHINGTON (AP) - Bruce
Lindsey, President Clinton's clos
est adviser, knew in 1994 that an
Indonesian company had hired
Clinton's disgraced friend Webster
Hubbell — long before the compa
ny emerged at the center of the
Democratic fund-raising contro
versy.
Lindsey's statement, contained
in a June 1996 Senate deposition
stored away at the National
Archives, contradicts the account
White House press secretary Mike
McCurry gave just last month.
McCurry told reporters in

December that Lindsey and other
presidential aides did not learn
about the Lippo Group's hiring of
Hubbell until press accounts last
year. "They reported being sur
prised," he said at the time.
Asked by The Associated Press
about the conflicting deposition,
the White House yesterday altered
— for a third time in recent weeks
— its public account of events in
the controversy over Asian-linked
donors to the f3emocratic Party.
White House special counsel
Lanny Davis said Lindsey's testi
mony was accurate and that

McCurry's explanation was wrong.
He blamed miscommunication
between Lindsey, a White House
lawyer and McCurry.
"There certainly was no
attempt to mislead the press at any
time about these matters," Davis
said.
Davis said Lindsey "considers
this to be an honest misunder
standing." He said Lindsey didn't
correct McCurry's account earlier
because he had not seen it and "has
no recollection of reading anything
that would have triggered in his
mind" that there was erroneous

information.
McCurry said he hadn't been
told, until Tuesday, about the
deposition.
"I pressed very hard at the time
inside here, to the point of being
obnoxious, to ensure I was being
told everything accurate, but
apparently I made a mistaken
assumption and I'm sorry for
that," he said.
In the Senate deposition last
summer, before the fund-raising
controversy erupted, Lindsey
acknowledged he knew as early as
November 1994 that Lippo had

hired Webster Hubbell after his
disgrace and fall from a top Justice
Department job.
Lindsey testified he believed he
learned of it because Lippo had
planned to send a group of 20
Arkansans, including Hubbell, to
Indonesia to meet Clinton on a trip
there. Lindsey nixed the idea.
"I believe, as I said, that Webb's
name may have been on the list,"
Lindsey stated.
Congressional investigators
are probing whether Lippo's hir
ing of Hubbell may have been
encouraged by Clinton associates

to assist the close presidentia
friend as he was being asked t
cooperate with Whitewater prose
cutors. The White House denie
involvement.
Hubbell has refused to say wha
he did for Lippo or how much h
was paid. Some published report
have put the payments in six fig
ures.
In explaining why he rejectee
the plan. Lmdsey also suggested ii
his deposition that he was con
cerned reporters might ask ques
tions about Lippo if the Arkansan,
were seen in Indonesia.
