# Hospices close their doors as AIDS patients decrease
## 
### 
BOSTON (AP) — The beds in the Hos
pice at Mission Hill are empty. A hand-knit
blanket lies folded, no longer needed, at the
foot of one. A lone teddy bear stands guard
over another.
The stray mementoes recall 1,200 men
and women who made the converted brick
boardinghouse their final home, dying here
of AIDS over seven years.
In the hardest times, as many as three a
night might slip away. By morning, flicker
ing candles lit their names, freshly penned
on crisp, white cards propped up on an entry
table.
Now, this beacon of compassion and care
has closed its doors, as have others in Cali
fornia and Pennsylvania. They couldn't fill
their beds and couldn't afford to care for the
few patients who lingered.
AIDS still kills — as many as 40,000
Americans every year — and infects up to
80,000 annually. But new drug combina
tions have slowed the ghastly quickstep,
even reversing some symptoms, and many
dying patients are finding warm embraces
amid families who once turned them away
out of fear and shame.
Hospice workers now make house calls to
case caretakers' struggle with the disease's
dreadful final stages: diarrhea, dementia
and agonizing pain.
"People go home to die now," said Allen
Carrier of AIDS Project Los Angeles, one of
the country's largest AIDS service organiza
tions.
Kim Brown, whose brother, John Harris,
died at Mission Hill in 1995, is saddened by
its closing. The care provided was far superi
or to what her brother experienced in many
hospital stays, she said.

"They made the patients feel like they all
belonged, and it was really their home,"
Brown said.
Images that endure for Brown include
the social worker who spoon-fed her brother
ice cream and the nurse who would simply
sit and hold his hand.
"Some days, he'd call up my mother and
he'd be almost in tears and he'd say,
'They're so good to me,' " Brown said.
Visitors were cared for, too. The kitchen
could prepare extra food so relatives could
share mealtimes with patients, and the hos
pice had a tiny chapel on the second floor
and a guest room, where a loved one could
stay when a patient was clearly near death.
Mission Hill opened in 1989 in a non
descript brick bow-front in a scruffy neigh
borhood on the fringes of Boston's hospital
district, the first federally funded Medicare
and Medicaid AIDS hospice in the country.
It had an immediate waiting list for its 18
beds, said Patrick Roll, the hospice commu
nications director. The average stay was a
month or two.
Two years ago, to control costs, the hos
pice closed half its rooms. Its remaining nine
l>eds were still in demand, but the average
stay shrank to seven days. The difference
was that medical advances were allowing
patients to live symptom-free much longer,
and the time to find a place to die was
pushed back later and later. Some patients
died within hours of checking in.
Over the last six months, however,
admissions dropped precipitously, as grow
ing numbers of HIV patients regained their
health with a new class of drugs called pro
tease inhibitors. The hospice lost $80,000 in
December alone, Roll said.
