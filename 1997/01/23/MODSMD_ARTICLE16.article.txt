Jury gets Simpson case
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - O.J.
Simpson was not obsessed with his ex
wife, did not stalk her and had no motive
to kill her, his lawyer told jurors yesterday
to counter what he called a "character
assassination."
"It's part of the efTort by the plaintiffs
to demonize and to manufacture a
motive," defense attorney Robert Baker
said in his closing argument. "You can't
get your arms around it because it doesn't
exist."
Baker got his chance to speak after
plaintiffs' attorneys spent a day-and-a

half imploring jurors to find Simpson
responsible for the 1994 deaths of Nicole
Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman
and to strip the football star of his for
tune. The jury is expected to get the case
today.
"This isn't a fight for justice. It's a
fight for money," Baker said. "We have
witnessed a character assassination."
Astronaut dizzy on return
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -
Astronaut John Blaha returned to Earth
yesterday after a punishing four months
aboard the Russian space station Mir and,

instead of playing the hero, allowed him
self to be carried off shuttle Atlantis on a
stretcher.
It was the first time an astronaut
agreed to be carried off after a long space
flight. The decision delighted NASA doc
tors, who wanted to gauge immediately
the effects of long-term weightlessness on
the body, including dizziness and weak
ened bones and muscles.
Paramedics gently carried the weak
Blaha onto an airport-style people-mover
minutes after Atlantis landed with its
crew of six. He was greeted by hugs and
kisses from his wife of 30 years, Brenda,
and their '23-year-old daughter, Carolyn.

The 54-year-old former combat and
test pilot said he was "absolutely
stunned" at how heavy he felt when
Atlantis landed and how wobbly he still
felt several hours later.

WICHITA, Kan. (AP) - When you
teach adults how to take their first steps
on the Internet, you have to be very
patient.
"I really don't have as much patience
as a teacher does," said instructor Anna
Walter, presiding over a class of six adults.

Anna is 9. She is in the third grade.
She and other pupils of L'Ouverture
Computer Technology Magnet School
taught their first computer class for more
than 60 grown-ups Tuesday night.
The children taught everything from
browsing the World Wide Web to
researching any topic under the sun, to
designing their own home page. Anna told
her class how she set up her own person
al Web page back in second grade.
Tim Nguyen, 45, a Boeing machinist,
said he went to the class to learn how to
look up information on his stock portfo
lios. It was the first time he had explored
the Internet.
