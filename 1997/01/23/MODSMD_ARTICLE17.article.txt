Shen and Thompson's
'A University for Students'
is full of lofty vagueness

ASSU PRESIDENT BILL
Shen and ASSU Vice Presi
dent Nick Thompson have
certainly been creative and hard
working in their various attempts
to make Stanford — as well as
universities around the country —
better places.
Whether diligently campaign
ing to reform U.S. News & World
Report's college rankings or sug
gesting that Stanford create a pro
gressive endowment fund, Shen
and Thompson have tried to
change more policy than most
ASSU leaders in recent memory.
They have also worked closely
with students at other universi
ties to ensure that their goals
reach farther than just Campus
Drive. Pleasantly, the ASSU
seems to have done much more
than argue over sweatshirts this
year.
This is why Shen and Thomp
son's latest political move — pub
lishing "A University for Stu
dents: A Campaign to Reform the
Role of Universities in Society" —
is such a disappointment. The
publication, which was slipped
under students' doors last week,
discusses four general principles,
basically culminating in the idea
that university students and
administrators need to work
together to ensure that decision
making is based on how best to
educate students and, as a result,
improve society. Or something.
Unlike Shen and Thompson's
previous campaigns — like work
ing with U.S. News and suggesting
a progressive endowment fund —
this publication is extremely
vague and does not clearly state
how the proposed goals can be
met. In the publication, Shen and
Thompson state that their end
goal is to "reach consensus on
principles, but also to generate

discussion and help everyone in
the community in our search to
understand the meaning of higher
education." One key question is
not answered: Just how do they
plan to do this?
Full of snippets discussing such
hot Stanford topics as the alcohol
policy, the eating clubs, the judi
cial charter and the post office,
the publication reads like a plat
form for Shen and Thompson.
They seem to say all the things
that Stanford students want to
hear. But, why are they publishing
a platform months after taking
office? Since Shen is not allowed
to run for president for a second
term, according to the ASSU Con
stitution, why does he need to
engage in such a public relations
like stunt?
Shen and Thompson's publica
tion noticeably follows some road
blocks to their more concrete
campaigns. According to Thomp
son, nothing came out of his
recent meeting with the editors
of U.S. News to discuss the fate
of the magazine's college rank
ings. In addition, a Board of
Trustees' committee recently
rejected the idea for a progres
sive endowment fund at the Uni
versity. Hopefully, establishing
the vague "University for Stu
dents" will not take time away
from these much more focused
and purposeful — though recent
ly impeded — campaigns. More
over, the new campaign is hope
fully not an effort to forget these
more important goals.
Just why did "A University for
Students" come about? Is Shen
looking for another resume pack
er? Was Thompson looking for
another venue to express his per
sonal agenda? Were they looking
for more national press?
Perhaps the answer is all too
obvious; perhaps in their months
in office, Shen and Thompson
have already become seasoned
politicians who purposely strive
for vagueness so as not to be held
accountable by the public. Some
how, they seemed to be different.
