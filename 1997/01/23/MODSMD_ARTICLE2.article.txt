# Shen's plans met with skepticism, confusion

### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
Many of ASSU President Bill Shen's numerous pro
posals offered at Tuesday's State of the Association ad
dress have been greeted by confusion and skepticism.
In a speech outlining his plans for the ASSU, Shen
told the senate that he intends to present a constitu
tional amendment to reduce the number of votes un
dergraduates cast for senators, author a proposal to
found a political union on campus, investigate the Uni
versity's relationship with Santa Clara County and ad
dress the open-ended lease of the post office.
Responses to his plans have ranged from confusion
to disagreement.
Shen declared Tuesday night that he had made
"real, concrete progress" toward solving the post office

problem. The Stanford post office has I
been operating under a month-to- £
month lease for the last three years |
while University officials attempt to |
determine what the future of postal |
service on campus will be.
Despite his assurances, though, |
the situation is no closer to resolution 112
than before, according to those clos- \
est to the issue.

"I really have no idea what Bill is talking about,"
said Leonie Batkin, the Stanford Management Co. of
ficial responsible for overseeing the post office lease.
Shen also pledged to form a committee to investi
gate the University's relationship with the Santa Clara

County Sheriff's Office.
Under a long-standing agree
ment with the county, Stanford em
ploys and pays the salaries of all
campus security personnel — but
those officers are deputized mem
bers of the sheriff's department.
Stanford-employed police officers
would have no legal authority as
law-enforcement personnel if they
were not under the aegis of the
county sheriff.
Shen's concern is that parking
ticket revenues issued by Stanford
police officers must be turned over
to the county.
"We give enough money to the
county. I want to make certain we
are getting our fair share of ser
vices," Shen said in an interview
yesterday.

Stanford Police Chief Marv Her
rington explained that such an
arrangement is out of Stanford's
control.
"Revenues from tickets, by law,
all go the county," he said. "As a pri
vate institution, Stanford doesn't
have any claim on those funds."
If that's the case, Shen main
tains, then Stanford police officers
— as University employees —
should not spend time generating
money for the county.
"Stanford deputies should be pa
trolling residences, not parking
lots," Shen said. "We need to bal
ance the parking issue with the
safety issue. If we are generating
revenue for the County of Santa
Clara, we shouldn't be doing it at
the cost of foot patrol."
Herrington maintains that cam
pus safety is not compromised.
"The vast majority (of parking
tickets) are not issued by full
deputies; they are issued by com

munity service officers," he said.
"However, we do pay for that en
forcement program."
A trade-off for the ticket rev
enues, Herrington continued, is
that Stanford's Department of
Public Safety can enforce laws and
mandate penalties through the
county's criminal justice system.
Finally, Shen also plans to pro
pose an amendment to the ASSU
Constitution that would reduce the
number of votes undergraduate
students may cast for senators in
the general election.
Currently, undergraduates may
vote for 15 of the candidates run
ning for senate. Shen would like to
limit that number to five.
"It makes sense; it's plain and
simple common sense," he said. "It
makes voting more manageable."
Shen contends that although
students may cast some of their
votes for candidates they know well
they then "carpet-bomb the rest of

the ballot," selecting candidates
about which they know little more
than a last name or a poster slogan.
"It's not realistic to suggest that
every (undergraduate) student cast
votes for 15 people and make each
one of those an educated vote,"
Shen said.
Graduate students only cast
votes for the senators representing
their district, such as the one in
cluding the Law School, School of
Medicine and Graduate School of
Business.
My proposal is "just natural dis
tricting," Shen said. "It should
make decisions more competitive."
ASSU Senator Doug Natelson,
however, said he doesn't think the
proposal will have a significant sub
stantive effect.
"I don't think this will affect the
makeup of the senate," he said. "I
think the real problem is voter
turnout, and I don't think this real
ly addresses that."
