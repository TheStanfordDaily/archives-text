WHAT IT IS that makes one per
son interesting and another
one not? I have been wonder
ing this for years. Is it angst? Is it inner
torment? Is it bad taste or a messed-up
childhood (not that they are related)?
Drugs? Sex? Fame? Talent? Plain ole
difference from everyone else? I have
tried so many different routes to inter
estingness. If you read my column regu
larly, you have heard about parts of my
melodramatic phase, my angst phase
and the loner phase. So what's left?
At confused times like these, after I
have just had that mind-boggling con
versation with the friend who looks
weird, or taken the long walk to
nowhere in particular with the friend
who is constantly redefining himself, or
just gotten off of the phone with the
friend who seems to spout poetry at
every turn, I am forced to sit down and
ask myself what in the world it is that
they see in me. Why me? Why do I get to
be the one who hears the fairly innova
tive revelations of X? In the past,
because most of my friends here have
been guys, I have tended to attribute
any time they spent with me to some
sort of ulterior motive relating to geni
talia. And though this may have been a
very good assessment in some cases, I
think that in many other cases I have
sold myself short when I've allowed
myself to believe that. But this isn't just
about me.
I have heard similar thoughts from
people who happen to be wonderful

musicians or performers. "They don't
really like me; they like what I do in
public," or "They don't really like me;
they like that I told that guy off at lunch
the other day," or something along
those lines. They don't like ME, they
like what they can GET from me.
Of course, you can also feel quite bor
ing, repressed and inhibited without
having crazy interesting friends. You can
feel uninteresting no matter what your
situation is. Make the necessary conver
sion to your own situation as necessary.
Anyway, in times like these, I believe
that the only way to come to a useful
conclusion about the reason and purpose
of your relationship to the world is to
take some time for reflection inward,
and that will give you your true answer.
Much like taking psychedelic drugs.
Scratch that.
I guess, when it gets down to it, you
feel what others make you feel. It is
hard to feel boring unless people say,
"Gee that is boring!" when you tell them
about your exciting day. Clearly, you are
hanging out with the wrong people.
No, that is wrong.
I guess, when it gets down to that
bottom line, if you don't want to feel
boring, change your life. Try looking at
things a different way, or putting a rib
bon in your hair, or through your belt
loops. Clearly you are just not doing
your part.
Nope, that ain't it either.
I guess, if you really want to be com
pletely and utterly sure of your general

greatness, the thing to do is cultivate a
good ear. Because truly interesting peo
ple only want to talk about themselves.
That way, you can he surrounded by
interesting people who like talking
about themselves and THEN under
stand what it is that makes them inter
esting so you can copy them.
That has got to be wrong.
How about this: Don't worry about it.
Enjoy what you see around you. Don't
worry about BEING it. Obviously you
have some redeeming value. A good
friend will, every now and then, tell you
what that value is. Hopefully.
I am not feeling all that helpful.
How many of you out there are feel
ing mute and boring in this Dennis Rod
man wannabe culture? Raise your
hands. Now take a look around you, and
you will be quite surprised at the num
ber of people who've raised their hands
with you. Ignore them. Take a look at
the people who have not raised their
hands. Now scowl at them and invite
them to lunch. Ask them, not me.
Lemme know what you come up with.
