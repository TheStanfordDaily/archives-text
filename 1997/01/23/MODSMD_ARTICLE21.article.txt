Ujamaa divides the African-American community

AS A WHITE, Southern female, I
don't pretend to consider myself
an expert on the black commu
nity at Stanford. However, I am well
versed in racism and hatred — it has
surrounded me all of my life. And hav
ing lived with members of nearly every
minority community at Stanford, I
must say I am astonished and appalled
by the division and negativity fostered
within some of Stanford's ethnic theme
dorms.
The most horrific example of this
division is that fostered in Ujamaa. If
the idea of having ethnic theme dorms
was to support and cultivate respect

for other cultures, pride in common
heritage and build a sense of communi
ty spirit, then Ujamaa has failed in
every possible way. The alienation that
Garry Grundy (Tuesday's Daily) speaks
of seems to be common among many of
Stanford's African-American students.
I couldn't begin to relate all the stories
of rejection and hostility I have heard
concerning Ujamaa during my four
years at Stanford. Shouldn't Ujamaa
be a place where members of Stan
ford's black community can seek refuge
from the racism that surrounds them
and degrades them? Shouldn't it be a
sort of safe haven from all the crap

African Americans deal with on a daily
basis?
The reality is that it's not. In fact,
most black students I know feel more
threatened when they walk into Uja
maa than in any other dorm on cam
pus. It's truly sad that such hostility
and degradation exists in a place that
should serve as a center of community
pride.
Although I am less familiar with the
associations of other communities to
their theme dorms, I can relate that as
a resident of Okada last year, I quickly
realized many of the "community-ori
ented" activities evolved into clique-

forming activities. The AASA-ites vs.
the non-AASA-ites, the Asian Ameri
cans vs. the "true" Asians. While the
division of community in this dorm
came nowhere near that of Ujamaa, it
still existed. As I have little or no expe
rience with other theme dorms, I will
leave members of those communities to
assess their effectiveness. But, I think
it is crucial for residents, resident fel
lows, theme assistants and community
leaders to re-evaluate the role of their
theme dorms in supporting and foster
ing pride in common heritage.
