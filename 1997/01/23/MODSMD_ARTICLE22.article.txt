# Charge of embezzlement, not buy-back program, is Bookstore's problem
## 
### 
In her letter (Tuesday's Daily), Peggy
Mendelson, president and CEO of the
Stanford Bookstore, seems to somewhat
misunderstand the basis of student dis
trust of the Bookstore. While Mendel
son attempts to present the Bookstore
as an established student advocate, she
counts on long lines and short memo
ries to maintain this appearance. In
fact, the Bookstore has an established
tradition of questionable financial deal
ings since before many of its valued cus
tomers could pronounce the word
"embezzlement." Felony charges filed in
1995 accused former Bookstore man
agers Phillip Chiaramonte and Eldon
Stoeed of misusing store funds to pur
chase luxury boats, a $400,000 retreat
in the Sierra foothills, as well as leasing
motor homes and luxury cars for their
own use and that of other Bookstore

employees.
Given that the extravagances in
question were probably not funded
exclusively from the tip jar of Cafe and
Confections, students are understand
ably skeptical of the Bookstore's pro
fessed mission "to serve the faculty,
students and staff of the University
... to keep costs low and run a
healthy business so that we can return
surplus revenue to the University
community through the rebate."
Rather, past events seem to indicate
that the Bookstore endeavored to
serve not students as much as Book
store top brass, returning surplus rev
enue not to the University community
but to a vacation community in North
ern California.
Its outcome aside, the case solidified
the Bookstore's image as simply anoth
er corporation that is indifferent to stu
dents' interests in the face of the inter
ests of its executives. Students do dis
trust the Bookstore because they
understand that it functions not as a
service-provider but as a business,
skilled in creative fund appropriation,

regardless of its claim to nonprofit sta
tus.
