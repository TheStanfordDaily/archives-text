# Friend of Eric Jackson accuses Alane Murdock of hypocritical bashing
## 
### 
Once again, ASSU Senator Alane
Murdock's hypocrisy, partisanship and
meager intellectual endowment disap
point me.
Tuesday night, Murdock attacked
Eric Jackson, a colleague and friend,
asserting that his connection to The
Stanford Review rendered him unfit to
serve as a member of the ASSU Pro
gram Board. His views, she believes, are
"outspoken." Murdock further contend
ed that Jackson was a liar.
The Review editor or not, Jackson's
views are no more extreme than many

current members, appointed on the ris
ing red tide of multicultural hype. Nor
does it matter; the Program Board
should represent student opinion, and
Jackson speaks for a large number of
students.
Unless Murdock's intellectual powers
are even more feeble than her asinine
analysis leads me to believe, I can only
conclude that she is punishing Jackson
for reporting her numerous follies in
The Review. Leaving aside her own
dubious ascension to the senate chair
(courtesy of her boyfriend), Murdock's
egotistic histrionics and rank hypocrisy
grate on my nerves. She already tried to
derail the nomination of Jeff Giesea for
her own personal gain; now she intends
to derail Jackson.
Murdock said Jackson has a "chip on
his shoulder." Maybe it's time for a little
self-examination. Unless Murdock can
reign in her partisan bilge, or at least
disguise it as ingenious debate, she
ought to shut up. I, for one, am tired of
hearing from her.
