## Men's basketball hopes to rebound from Beaver loss 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
As much as Stanford fans
would have loved to see their
No. 17 Cardinal take two road
wins at Oregon last weekend to
vault into a first-place tie in the
Pacific 10 Conference — not to
mention a possible top-10 rank
ing — there's something to be
said for the humility that
accompanies a game like Satur
day's 84-77 loss to lowly Ore
gon State.
For a young but talented
team like Stanford, Saturday's
game can serve as a healthy
reminder that in this league, no
matter if it's Oregon State or
Arizona, you're going to get
beat if you don't come ready to
play.
"Whatever it is, subcon
sciously you don't prepare
yourself the same (for a team
like Oregon StateJ, or you don't
think it's going to be as hard,"
said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "Whatever it is,
it's not something conscious
because I'll guarantee you we
talked about it at length. I'm
sure they said, 'By God, we're
not going to let down,' but it's
still the idea that maybe you
don't have to do as much."
"Maybe that was a wake-up
call for the Pac-10," said sopho
more guard Arthur Lee. "We
had a wake-up call earlier in
the season with [an 82-78 loss
against) College of Charleston.
Maybe we realize now that we

can be beaten by anybody, so
we've got to be focused for
every game."
The good news for Cardinal
fans is that the wake-up call
came early. Damage was mini
mal, with the Cardinal drop
ping just two spots to No. 17 in
the Associated Press poll and
remaining tied for second place
in the Pac-10. And with two
thirds of the conference season
remaining, Stanford still has
time on its side.
The bad news is that the
Cardinal (11-3 overall, 4-2 Pac
-10) has little room for error
this week, when it meets the
Washington schools in a pair of
must-win home games, begin
ning with a 7:30 p.m. matchup
tonight against Washington
(10-3, 3-2 Pac-10) at Maples
Pavilion.
"At home you have your
fans behind you," Lee said.
"Even when things go wrong,
you still have that support. You
know the crowd is there to
cheer you on, to get you going if
there's a slide of some sort. But
on the road, things go bad and
it's like you against maybe
10,000-plus other people."
First on Stanford's to-do
list in the aftermath of the
Oregon State loss is resusci
tating its suddenly ice-cold
shooting. Sophomore Kris
Weems, the team's resident
sharpshooter, has lapsed into
a funk of late, converting on
just eight of his last 33 three
point attempts. Backup guard
Lee also couldn't find his touch
against Oregon State, missing 8-
of-9 tries.
But that's not always necessar
ily a problem when you have a go
to guy inside like sophomore cen
ter Tim Young. It's when Young
and the shooting game malfunc
tion that Stanford has serious
problems on its hands. And too
often, that's when the game falls
on the shoulders of senior point
guard Brevin Knight.
"What I don't want to happen is
the other players to rely on Brevin,
thinking that he's going to make
magic," Montgomery said. "We've
gotta have other people taking it at
point of attack. . . . We need some
people vocalizing and making
plays and stepping up.
"I think that's when it's partic
ularly tough for Brevin, when
every time that they get a little bit
shaky confidence-wise, they just
throw it right back to Brevin,
thinking he's gonna make it all
right. That's not fair. He can't do
that. When they take you out of
some things, and maybe if Tim
doesn't have a great game or
whatever the circumstances,
there's gotta be other people that
can step up."
Tonight the Cardinal will also
have to step up defensively
against a team that boasts one of
the Pac-10's most talented ath
letes in junior forward Mark San
ford and one of its most promising
big men in 7-foot sophomore cen
ter Todd MacCulloch.

Sanford, who last spring
announced he was foregoing his
final two years of eligibility to
enter the NBA draft only to later
reconsider, is a rare talent who
combines size (6-foot-9, 210
pounds) with out-of-this-world
athleticism. He currently ranks
fifth in the league in both scoring
(16.7) and rebounding (7.5).
"He's taken a lion's share of
their shots," Montgomery said.
"He puts it on the floor, he can
spin-dribble, dunk, jump, run,
shoot the three. That's not a nor
mal [power forwardj-type guy.
The challenge that he presents is
the fact that he's one of the better
players in the league."
Containing Sanford is a key if
the Cardinal hopes to come away
with a win tonight and make a
dim memory of last Saturday.

happen is the other

Brevin, thinking that

The OSU loss "hurt us a lot,"
Lee said, "but we're still in second
place. Our confidence level is still
high. We figure we can beat any
one in the league."
"We realize that we didn't play
as well as we're capable probably
in either game on the road last
week," Montgomery said, "but we
were able to get one. Now we've
just got to try to push on."
