## Men's basketball hopes to rebound from Beaver loss 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
As much as Stanford fans
would have loved to see their
No. 17 Cardinal take two road
wins at Oregon last weekend to
vault into a first-place tie in the
Pacific 10 Conference — not to
mention a possible top-10 rank
ing — there's something to be
said for the humility that
accompanies a game like Satur
day's 84-77 loss to lowly Ore
gon State.
For a young but talented
team like Stanford, Saturday's
game can serve as a healthy
reminder that in this league, no
matter if it's Oregon State or
Arizona, you're going to get
beat if you don't come ready to
play.
"Whatever it is, subcon
sciously you don't prepare
yourself the same (for a team
like Oregon StateJ, or you don't
think it's going to be as hard,"
said Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery. "Whatever it is,
it's not something conscious
because I'll guarantee you we
talked about it at length. I'm
sure they said, 'By God, we're
not going to let down,' but it's
still the idea that maybe you
don't have to do as much."
"Maybe that was a wake-up
call for the Pac-10," said sopho
more guard Arthur Lee. "We
had a wake-up call earlier in
the season with [an 82-78 loss
against) College of Charleston.
Maybe we realize now that we

can be beaten by anybody, so
we've got to be focused for
every game."
The good news for Cardinal
fans is that the wake-up call
came early. Damage was mini
mal, with the Cardinal drop
ping just two spots to No. 17 in
the Associated Press poll and
remaining tied for second place
in the Pac-10. And with two
thirds of the conference season
remaining, Stanford still has
time on its side.
The bad news is that the
Cardinal (11-3 overall, 4-2 Pac
-10) has little room for error
this week, when it meets the
Washington schools in a pair of
must-win home games, begin
ning with a 7:30 p.m. matchup
tonight against Washington
(10-3, 3-2 Pac-10) at Maples
Pavilion.
"At home you have your
fans behind you," Lee said.
"Even when things go wrong,
you still have that support. You
know the crowd is there to
cheer you on, to get you going if
there's a slide of some sort. But
on the road, things go bad and
it's like you against maybe
10,000-plus other people."
First on Stanford's to-do
list in the aftermath of the
Oregon State loss is resusci
tating its suddenly ice-cold
shooting. Sophomore Kris
Weems, the team's resident
sharpshooter, has lapsed into
a funk of late, converting on
