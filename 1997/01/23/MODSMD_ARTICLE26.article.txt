# Injury bites women's hoops, again
## Mulitauaopele becomes third starter on sidelines as the Cardinal heads north for Washington games 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
It's something about Stan
ford-Washington women's bas
ketball in Hec Edmundson
Pavilion that just brings out the
best in Cardinal players.
In 1995, it was current volley
ball star Kristin Folkl who
scored 16 points and grabbed 10
rebounds in a hotly contested
55-50 win. A year later, then
junior guard Jamila Wideman
made Hec Edmundson her per
sonal stage, single-handedly car
rying the Cardinal to a 59-54 vic
tory with a brilliant 27-point
performance.
Who will step up in 1997?
In perhaps the biggest confer
ence game of the season, the
third-ranked Stanford women's
basketball team (18-1, 6-0 Pacif
ic 10 Conference) heads to the
Pacific Northwest for a show
down with the Huskies (8-6, 3-2
Pac-10). The Cardinal, already
down two starters, lost Naomi
Mulitauaopele to a knee injury
earlier this week, and the junior
forward will not make the trip
north. Nevertheless, the intensi
ty of the rivalry will certainly be
present tonight at 7 p.m.
"They've got a real good
crowd," said head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "Their teams have
traditionally been strong. There
is a good rivalry with Stanford
and Washington. We know we
bring out the best in them, and
their crowd will be into it. It's
important that our players come
out and play hard."
The Huskies come into this
game with a deceiving 8-6 mark
under first-year coach June
Daugherty, who replaced the

intense Chris Gobrecht. Among
the six defeats is a 73-70 setback
to No. 6 Louisiana Tech, a 13-
point loss to 12th-ranked Texas
and a controversial one-point
loss to USC in Washington's
conference opener.
Last Saturday, Washington
got back on the winning track at
home with a 78-56 thumping of
rival Washington State before a
season-best 5,977 fans (a num
ber sure to be surpassed
tonight).
In that game the Huskies
were in full force on the boards,
grabbing 43 rebounds. Washing
ton also forced 36 turnovers,
including a season-high 21
steals. Senior guard Laure
Savasta, in only her fifth game
back from a knee injury, estab
lished herself as the perimeter
threat she was a season ago,
scorching the Cougars for five
three-pointers.
In addition to Savasta, guard
Jamie Redd has not succumbed
to the sophomore jinx, averaging
a team-leading 23 points (fourth
in the country) and 5.7
rebounds, including 31 points
and 11 rebounds against USC.
Furthermore, she has taken over
the point guard duties from
Savasta this season, first filling
in during Savasta's injury and
now letting the senior play her
more natural position at the
shooting guard.
VanDerveer always talks
about maintaining her team at a
high level throughout the con
ference season, and if this past
weekend was any indication,
Stanford may need a reminder.
After blowing out a highly

regarded Oregon team in sur
prisingly routine fashion 85-61,
the Cardinal struggled to pull
away from Oregon State before
finishing with an 18-point mar
gin.
Granted, Wideman did not
suit up and junior forward
Vanessa Nygaard continues to
recover from knee surgery, but it
still seemed a bit worrisome that
senior forward Kate Starbird (28
points) had to have a strong
game to pull out Stanford's 33rd
consecutive conference victory.
While the intensity may waver,
VanDerveer's confidence does
not.
"I think we kind of fell asleep
when we were up 27, but we had
to work hard to get up 27," Van-
Derveer said. "I'm not going to
apologize for winning by 18 with
two starters out. We've got some
young players who are in some
different roles for our team.
Every team that we play against
comes out with their guns load
ed."
Just like last week's Oregon
game, tonight's contest may
hinge on the post play. Stanford
and Washington are the top two
teams in the conference in
rebounding margin. Throw in
the intensity of the rivalry, and
the action underneath the bas
ket could have the charm of a
combat zone.
Washington boasts the
exploits of sophomore forward
Amber Hall and junior center
Gena Pelz, who average 10.3 and
7.9 rebounds, respectively. Stan

ford counters with junior center
Olympia Scott at 7.8 boards a
game. With the loss of Muli
tauaopele, players such as junior
forward Heather Owen and
sophomore center Chandra Ben
ton will be counted on by Van-
Derveer.
"Heather's been playing well
for us and maybe this gives
Chandra an opportunity to
play," VanDerveer said.
"They've got to realize that they
have an important job to do on
this team, and it's not just [Star
bird's job to carry the team).
This is what they were recruited
for, so I think they've got to be
looking forward to the game and
be ready to go."
Another factor for Stanford
will be the play of Starbird. The
senior, who is returning to her
home state for the last time in a
Cardinal uniform, has never per
formed well in Seattle, totaling
15 points at Washington in the
past two years.
With Folkl now a full-time
spiker and Wideman still ques
tionable, the third time could
indeed be the charm for Star
bird, adding another colorful
chapter to Stanford-Washington
lore. However, down three
starters, VanDerveer may need
more than a fantastic perfor
mance this time around.
"The thing that concerns me I
guess is being dependent on one
or two people," VanDerveer said
"People in practice have been
doing really well, and they've got
to carry it over to the game.
Charmin [Smith]'s been able to
do this; Milena [Flores] has been
able to do this. And now we need
other people to do the same
thing."
