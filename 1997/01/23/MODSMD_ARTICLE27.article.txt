While most of us are still struggling
to get out of bed at 9 a.m. for our first
class, the Stanford wrestling squad is
already awake, circuit training, drilling
moves, lifting weights and running sta
dium stairs with an intensity that has
made it one of the better conditioned
teams in the Pacific 10 Conference.
"Our season has definitely picked up
since the fall," said head coach Chris
Horpel. "Since Jan. 1,1 have been prac
ticing the team twice a day. We are far
better conditioned now, and I hope that

the two-a-days can help us hit our phys
ical climax as a team at the Pac-10 tour
nament."
Whatever Horpel's training strategy,
it has recently led the squad to an unof
ficial team title at the Aggie Open and a
respectable showing against 19th
ranked Fresno State. Although the
point-spread against the Bulldogs was
substantial (28-6), the Cardinal lost sev
eral close matches which would have
greatly improved the team's score.
The Cardinal wrestlers will soon be
put to the test once more, facing Oregon
tonight at 7 p.m. and UC-Davis on Sat
urday at 3 p.m. Both matches will be

held in Burnham Pavilion.
"Oregon's a solid squad, but proba
bly not quite as solid as Fresno State,"
senior grappler Brian Vaninian said.
"They will definitely put us to the test."
Leading the lineup for the Cardinal
will be sophomore Frank Ruiz at the
118-pound weight class. Following Ruiz
will be sophomore Zach Zimmerer at
126 pounds, while the 134-pound
weight class will probably be headed by
senior Robert Hatta.
Sophomore Beau Weiner will wrestle
at 142 pounds, and junior B.J. Sanchez
will compete at 150 pounds. Junior Jeff
Grant will represent Stanford in the

158-pcund weight class, with junior
phenom Scott Chapman wrestling at
167 pounds. The 177-pound class will
belong to either junior Jason Gladden
or sophomore Tim Kendall. Senior
team leader Brian Vaniman will wrestle
at 190 pounds, and senior Chris Serjak
will wrestle as a heavyweight.
"Oregon will be very tough. (The
outcome) is too close to call," Horpel
said. The Cardinal will have to deal with
Oregon wrestlers Jeremy Enrud (134
pounds) and Scott Norton (150
pounds), both of whom are nationally
