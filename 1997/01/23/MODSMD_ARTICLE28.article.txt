# Rugby gets revamped for its weekend competition
## 
### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
Considering the results of their last
matches, some might expect the men's
and women's rugby teams to be taking
different approaches to their games this
weekend.
Hoping to bring a more unified strate
gy into its play, the men's rugby team
will travel to UC-Santa Barbara this
weekend for two matchups against the
Gauchos.
Both the Cardinal's first and second
teams will face UCSB after successful
victories over Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
last Saturday by comfortable margins of
31-13 and 35-5, respectively.
But despite the strong victories by
both the A and B squads, the team was
only exposed to several weaknesses that
it needs to eliminate to maintain its suc
cess. So instead of spending the week
revelling in two decisive victories the
men have been hard at work.
In those contests it was the strong
individual performances of certain play
ers that helped push the team past the
Mustangs when it began faltering as a
complete unit.
"We won basically only on individual
efforts, which says a lot about our team per
formance," said head coach Franck Boivert.
"It was poor because people weren't really
trying to work as a team. [Monday] we had

a very tough practice where we tried to be
much more disciplined."
Problems for the men include the ball
being run too far out, making it difficult
for teammates to recover in the event
that the ball-carrier is tackled by an
opponent.
On the other side of the ball, the
women's team is scheduled to travel to
UC-San Diego this weekend, after a two
week break from competition. The
women had no games last weekend due
to the three-day holiday and previously
scheduled ski trips.
In the women's previous competition
this month, the team lost big to a strong
UCLA squad on Jan. 11.
But the bright spot in the otherwise
punishing game was that the match
showed the players one of their stronger
aspects of the game — namely, their
defense.
The Bruin team had many ringers and
upper-echelon players according to
Boivert, but after a rough first half the
Cardinal came back with a strong show
ing on defense in the second to slow the
Bruin charge and provide a little confi
dence for the young Stanford squad.
Since that last game, the Cardinal has
spent many of its practice hours focusing
on re-working its defensive realignment
and sharpening its ball-handling skills in
hopes of continuing its improvement on
the field.
