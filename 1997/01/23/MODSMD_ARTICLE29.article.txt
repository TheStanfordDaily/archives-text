# Marathon is a big success for Vanessa
## 
### 
13.1 miles is a helluva long way.
This perception became crystal clear to me
when I embarked upon my first half-marathon
last Sunday in San Diego.
Going into the race I was healthy, in suffi
cient running shape and definitely enthusiastic
to achieve my conservative goal of running the

race within two hours. However, all the enthu
siasm and preparation in the world couldn't
have stopped me from questioning my sanity
come miles 8 and 9.
Sunday, Jaji. 19
5 a.m. — Despite the alarm clock being set for
6 a.m., I voluntarily wake up at 5 a.m. to begin
the day. This is eerie, since I never wake up
before I absolutely have to. 1 must be anxious.
6:25 a.m. — Drive to the race with my
boyfriend Bryan, who is a San Diego native and
resident, and his friend Greg, a Navy Seal. Both
of them are running the full marathon portion
of the race. We try to eat chocolate VO2 Max
bars without throwing up.
6:45 a.m. — Arrive at the race and have to park
about a mile away because of all the hoopla. We
jog to the race site, and my knee already starts
hurting. I hope it is mental.
7 a.m. — My race begins. I look around at all
the other participants. I feel young, as the aver
age racer seems to be middle-aged. I hope I can
still run when I'm their age. I notice some vari
ety among the masses. One man is wearing a
long, green, grass skirt over his running shorts
— I immediately dub him Hula Man. Next to
me is a man pushing a stroller containing a
baby — I vow to run faster than he does.

7:03 a.m. — There are so many
people that I just now cross the
starting line.
7:15 a.m. — The first mile seems
to take forever, as the hordes of
people need time to separate. At
this point I break away from the
crowds and start passing people.
Granted, the people I pass include
those walking and the man with
the stroller, but it feels good
nonetheless.
7:30 a.m. — We reach the ocean.
The race had begun in Carlsbad,
which is about 40 minutes north
of downtown San Diego, but the
course is run primarily beside the
ocean along Highway 1, which has
been closed for the event. The
waves are crashing in, the sun is
rising just ahead of us and my
knee no longer hurts. This is
heaven.
7:45 a.m. — I decide to drink
some water. Every mile or two
there has been a station set up
with people yelling "Water!
Gatorade!" but I've passed them
up to this point. As I run by the
station this time I grab the water
being held out to me, say thanks
and, while still running, try to
drink it. One-quarter of the cup
made it in my mouth, maximum.
I figure next time I'll stop run
ning to drink.
8 a.m. — I reach the turnaround
point, which marks mile 6.55, or
the first half of the race. I feel
great, though my shoes are tied
too tight. I briefly stop to retie my
shoes and have some water, which
fortunately all makes it into my
mouth this time. Up to this point
I'd been hanging with Hula Man,

but my 20-second stop puts him
out of sight.
8:20 a.m. — I have no idea how
far I've run, as there haven't been
any markings for a while. I've
been thinking about the original
marathoner, the Greek who died
immediately after he delivered
the message for which he had run
26.2 miles. Right then the
marathoners pass by us going in
the opposite direction, and Bryan
and I wave to each other. I'd
started to feel tired, but seeing
the marathoners reminds me
that I am only running half the
distance they are, and I get a sec
ond wind.
8:29 a.m. — I reach the 10-mile
mark. As the most I'd ever run
before was 10 miles (which I'd
done once, the week before), every
step becomes a new challenge. I'm
tempted by the "Free margari
tas!" shouts from restaurant
patrons we run by, but I stick
with water and keep repeating
"just 3 more miles, just 3 more
miles."
8:41 a.m. — I'm losing fuel. I
can feel myself slowing down. I
question whether I should've
drank Gatorade instead of water
at the last station. (Or even one
of those margaritas!) Suddenly, I
sense a stroller beside me, and
realize the father pushing his
baby is going to pass me. Not a
chance! This is all I need to revi
talize my energy, and I pick up
my pace, increasing the distance
between us.
8:50 a.m. — I know I'm close, but
not sure how close. To reach my
goal of sub-two hours, I figure I
should finish by 9:03 a.m. (since
that is exactly two hours from
when I passed the start), but I
want my time to be under two
hours on the official clock. (Which

they start when the first racer
passes the start.) So I run fast. My
legs are jelly, but it feels good to
change the pace a bit. I reach mile
13 and start sprinting for that last
tenth of a mile.
8:59:03 a.m. — I pass the finish
line! I'm exuberant as I get a
medal placed around my neck and
start the best part of the extrava
ganza — collecting all my free
food.
9 a.m.- 11 a.m. — The rest of
the morning is spent driving
with Bryan's parents to watch
him at certain points in the
marathon. I am inspired by all
the runners I see, especially the
older ones and the man who is
not wearing any shoes. I make a
promise to myself to run in a full
marathon (with shoes) by the
end of the year.
Running the San Diego half
marathon was one of the most
challenging things I've ever done,
and I eagerly anticipate my first
full marathon (perhaps in Wash
ington, D.C., in October???).
Training for a race is the best way
to continually motivate to run,
and I encourage all of you Cam
pus-Drive-joggers to start upping
your distance and give racing a
try.

Don't worry sports fans, Vanessa
reports that the soreness in her
arms is starting to fade.
