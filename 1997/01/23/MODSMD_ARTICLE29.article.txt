# Marathon is a big success for Vanessa
## 
### 
13.1 miles is a helluva long way.
This perception became crystal clear to me
when I embarked upon my first half-marathon
last Sunday in San Diego.
Going into the race I was healthy, in suffi
cient running shape and definitely enthusiastic
to achieve my conservative goal of running the

race within two hours. However, all the enthu
siasm and preparation in the world couldn't
have stopped me from questioning my sanity
come miles 8 and 9.
Sunday, Jaji. 19
5 a.m. — Despite the alarm clock being set for
6 a.m., I voluntarily wake up at 5 a.m. to begin
the day. This is eerie, since I never wake up
before I absolutely have to. 1 must be anxious.
6:25 a.m. — Drive to the race with my
boyfriend Bryan, who is a San Diego native and
resident, and his friend Greg, a Navy Seal. Both
of them are running the full marathon portion
of the race. We try to eat chocolate VO2 Max
bars without throwing up.
6:45 a.m. — Arrive at the race and have to park
about a mile away because of all the hoopla. We
jog to the race site, and my knee already starts
hurting. I hope it is mental.
7 a.m. — My race begins. I look around at all
the other participants. I feel young, as the aver
age racer seems to be middle-aged. I hope I can
still run when I'm their age. I notice some vari
ety among the masses. One man is wearing a
long, green, grass skirt over his running shorts
— I immediately dub him Hula Man. Next to
me is a man pushing a stroller containing a
baby — I vow to run faster than he does.
