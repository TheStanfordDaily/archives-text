# Bookstore policies debated
## Students question lack of representation, competition 
### Robert Chiles Contributing writer 
Students raised questions about several of the
Bookstore's policies at its annual informational
meeting last night.
Specifically, the small group gathered at the Law
School asked about the lack of student representa
tion on the Bookstore's Board of Directors, the lack
of market competition on campus and Bookstore
policies regarding pricing and student rebates.
The event was hosted by Bookstore President
and CEO Peggy Mendelson and Board of Directors
Chair William Lazier.
Junior Danny Bramzon kicked off discussion by
bringingup the issue of student membership on the
Board of Directors. Bramzon is the founder of Stop

Monopolies on Campus, a group that organized a
used-textbook exchange in the hope that students
would not need to make purchases at the Book
store.
Bramzon said he appreciated the Bookstore's in
volvement with the community and its enthusiasm
in holding the meeting. "This is the type of thing
that changes the image" of the Bookstore in the eyes
of the students, Bramzon said.
The presence of a student member on the Board
of Directors, Lazier told Bramzon, has never been
guaranteed.
He also explained why students might not want
to participate on the board, pointing out all board
members are subject to criminal and financial liabil-
ity for the Bookstore. He added
there are only 15 members on the
board and that it takes members
two to three years to understand
the complexity of the issues dis
cussed.
Furthermore, Lazier said,
most students do not remain on
campus long enough to become a
fully involved board member,
even if selected.
"It's about a 10-year commit
ment," he said. "The board is re
sponsible for the governance of
the corporation. You only have so
many board slots."
However, Lazier said, "There
is no reason, legally, that a stu
dent can't serve on the board."
Mendelson added that the
Bookstore regularly queries its
student employees and cus
tomers about Bookstore affairs
and prices but that no official
panel of students is involved in
the decision-making process. She
said Bookstore officials are avail
able and eager to meet with stu
dents.
"We get a tremendous amount
of feedback," Mendelson said.
"Our suggestion box is full every
week."
Senior Sam Ockman argued
that there is no competition for
consumer goods on campus, as the
Bookstore also owns Tresidder

Express. He requested the Book
store withdraw from the space it
holds in lYesidder Union, allow
ing a rival to move in, which theo
retically would drive prices down
and encourage product variety.
Although Ockman claimed
goods in Tresidder Express near
ly duplicate those available in the
Bookstore, Mendelson said there
is a "less than 10-percent" over
lap of the two businesses' goods.
However, she added, orders for
both stores are grouped in order
to minimize expenditures.
Bramzon criticized the Book
store for selling goods at higher
prices when compared with Cost
co and other chain stores.
Mendelson countered that
computers, textbooks, paper,
pencils and other student com
modity items were kept at mini
mal prices, while less popular,
more unusual goods are bought
in small quantities at unavoid
ably higher prices.
Students also raised questions
about the Bookstore's annual re
funds. Last year, Mendelson and
Lazier said, the Bookstore gave
$400,000 in rebates to students
who submitted receipts.
, Lazier said only some Book
store profits are distributed as re
funds. Some money is retained
for capital improvements, he
said, and some is contributed to
the University.
"Our principle concern is to
keep the Bookstore in good
shape," Lazier said.
