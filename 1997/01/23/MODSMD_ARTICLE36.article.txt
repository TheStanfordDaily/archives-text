# Business School admissions up 7 percent from last year

### Esther Pan Contributing writer 
Although it fell from seventh place to fourth in
this year's Business Week rankings of business
schools, Stanford's Graduate School of Business has
seen a marked increase in the number of students
seeking admission.
The Business School has already received more
than 3,000 applications for the 360 places in the Class
of 1999, a 7-percent increase for the first and most
competitive round of admissions.
Marie Mookini, the school's director of admis
sions, said the number of applications has been in
creasing steadily for the last few years. "Business
schools around the country are doing well, and
most have seen an increase in the last two years,"
she said.
For example, she added, UCLA's business school
has seen applications rise by 30 percent this year
alone.
The increase is evident in Stanford's first of three
rounds of admissions, in which applications were due
Nov. 6 and answers were mailed Jan. 8. For the sec
ond round, applications were due Jan. 3 and respons
es will be mailed March 19. In the latter round, there
was an increase of 3 percent in the number of appli
cations received.
The Business School is currently re-evaluating its
core curriculum in order to address the changing

needs of the business community, which includes ad
vances in technology, a more experienced and inter
national student body and a rising interest in entre
preneurship.
Mookini said she expected a total of 6,500 ap
plicants overall for 360 places. She added that at
top business schools such as Stanford, 81 per
cent of accepted students end up actually en
rolling.
She attributed the increase to a number of factors,
including the healthy pace of the economy.
"When the economy is doing well, there are better
job opportunities post-MBA," she said. "That makes
people think about going back to school."
In addition, Mookini said she saw a shift in the
media's portrayal of the MBA degree from a negative
spin in the past to a more positive perspective now.
"The media's been a lot more generous in portraying
the value of an MBA," she said.
However, she added that there is a down side to an
increase in applications. Besides more work for the
Business School Admissions Office, more applica
tions for a finite class mean more rejection letters,
she said.
"That's the flip side of an increase," said Mookini.
"People forget that more applications means more
people are disappointed.
"And it's not just applicants," she added. "It's rec
ommenders and colleagues and family and friends of
the applicants" that are affected.
