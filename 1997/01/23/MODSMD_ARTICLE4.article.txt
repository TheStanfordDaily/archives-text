Tiffany is coming to town.
The posh, New York jewelers
Tiffany & Co., that is. The company
has spent the last few years looking
for a suitable location in the Palo
Alto area, and now that it's found
one at the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, it hopes to be in business by
spring.
With more than 6,000 square
feet of space that has opened up in
the shopping center, the jewelry
store is eager to begin construction,
according to Wally Steiner,
Tiffany's vice president for the
Western region.
Tiffany & Co. will move into
space vacated by Nicole Miller,
Ports International and Folk Art In
ternational. across from Macy's,

said Julie Pitt, marketing director
for the Stanford Shopping Center.
The shopping center's manage
ment is excited about the new store,
which will be only Tiffany's second
in Northern California.
"A lot of our customers have
asked about Tiffany," Pitt said.
"The only other Tiffany in the area
is in Union Square (in San Francis
co) and to be able to call that our
competition is really a wonderful
thing for us."
Although the new store will not
be the size of the TiiTany & Co. in
San Francisco, Steiner said the com
pany still plans to feature tradition
al items.
"We're looking to carry a full
range of fancy jewelry, silver, fine
china and rift ware," Steiner said.
