# A 						jewel
## Tiffany's opening' at Stanford mall 
### Marni Leff Staff writer 
Tiffany is coming to town.
The posh, New York jewelers
Tiffany & Co., that is. The company
has spent the last few years looking
for a suitable location in the Palo
Alto area, and now that it's found
one at the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter, it hopes to be in business by
spring.
With more than 6,000 square
feet of space that has opened up in
the shopping center, the jewelry
store is eager to begin construction,
according to Wally Steiner,
Tiffany's vice president for the
Western region.
Tiffany & Co. will move into
space vacated by Nicole Miller,
Ports International and Folk Art In
ternational. across from Macy's,

said Julie Pitt, marketing director
for the Stanford Shopping Center.
The shopping center's manage
ment is excited about the new store,
which will be only Tiffany's second
in Northern California.
"A lot of our customers have
asked about Tiffany," Pitt said.
"The only other Tiffany in the area
is in Union Square (in San Francis
co) and to be able to call that our
competition is really a wonderful
thing for us."
Although the new store will not
be the size of the TiiTany & Co. in
San Francisco, Steiner said the com
pany still plans to feature tradition
al items.
"We're looking to carry a full
range of fancy jewelry, silver, fine
china and rift ware," Steiner said.
"The store will feature all of the
goods associated with Tiffany."
Plans call for a store similar to
others across the nation, Steiner
said.
"The store is going to be tradi
tional looking," Steiner said. "It's
going to have the stainless steel and
mahogany doors like the other
Tiffany stores. Tiffany & Co. is 160

years old and has a tremendous tra
dition to uphold."
Part of a national expansion pro
gram, Steiner said, Tiffany targeted
Palo Alto as a choice location.
"We're extremely excited be
cause we have earmarked this loca
tion for so long," Steiner said.
"We're waiting with baited breath
for construction to begin. The Stan
ford Shopping Center is really a
wonderful center, and we've been
looking to expand in the San Fran
ciscoarea."
With Tiffany's central location in

the Stanford Shopping Center, Pitt
said, the jewelry store will be an
asset to the whole mall.
"They're going to be a wonderful
addition to our retail mix," Pitt said.
"Tiffany always does a beautiful job.
The other jewelry stores are also
embracing them. I think it's defi
nitely going to enhance the mall."
Tiffany managers say they plan
to get involved in the Palo Alto com
munity.
"Traditionally we're active in our
local communities," Steiner ex
plained. "Once we open we will have

our share of events for and in the
community."
While some Stanford students
agree that Tiffany will be a good ad
dition to the mall, they noted that
most of Tiffany's items are a bit out
of reach for college students.
"Tiffany has really fine, beautiful
jewelry and will make a great addi
tion to the mall," said sophomore
Jacqueline Shen. "I'm just not sure
that it will really make a difference
for students. Most of Tiffany's
things are not really accessible or af
fordable for students."
