A classic play of the Chicano Cultural Renaissance
opens on the Stanford campus. The Stanford Drama
Department, in association with San Juan Bautista's
El Teatro Campesino, will present Luis Valdez's "La
Gran Carpa de los Rasquachis." This play is the story
of a Mexican immigrant who comes to the United
States to seek a better quality of life. Going from state
to state as a farm worker, he is confronted with the in
equities and labor abuses that plague the season
worker. Performances are today at noon in White
Plaza and tomorrow and Saturday at 8 p.m. in Casa
Zapata. Admission is free. For information, call 723-
2646.

SUN/26
Josh Kombluth is truly an alchemist: He managed to
transform the stories of a chaotic and hyperpolitical
childhood, a truly horrifying stint as a math student at
Princeton University and a litany of secretarial failures
into three brilliant and funny monologues which have
been recently published in "Red Diaper Baby." He
claims to be a longtime sufferer of a mammoth case
of writer's block; if this is the result which Ffculine Kael
characterized as "intellectual slapstick," we can only
hope it will never abate. This is at 7:30 p.m. at Black
Oak Books at 1491 Shattuck Ave. at Vine Street in
Berkeley. It's free.
