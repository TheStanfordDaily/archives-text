## Mamet brings mystery into Magic 
### 
The Magic Theater is a wonderfully im
mersive space, with a semicircle of seats
that surround the stage. The structure is a
fitting frame to David Mamet's "The
Cryptogram," playing through Feb. 9.
Mamet, author of "Glengarry Glen Ross"
and "American Buffalo," has created a
chilly, well-crafted play which haunts long
after the actors have shed their acts and
taken their bows.
At the center of the story is John (Eli
Marienthal), a young boy waiting for his
father to come home and take him camp
ing. Waiting with him are Del (Liam
O'Brien), a family friend, and Donny
(Susan Marie Brecht), his mother. Howev
er, John has yet to realize that his parents'
marriage has disintegrated, and his father,
in fact, will never return.
John is a precocious, intelligent boy
haunted by voices that he hears at the cusp
of sleep. As the play begins, John comes
bounding down the stairs, unable to sleep.
Clearly picking up on the tensions that
riddle his house, he twitches and moves
around the living room, peeking through
the Venetian blinds that form the back
drop in search of his father.
As the play progresses, John descends
into a world of doubt: "Maybe there's
nothing in books. Maybe what the globe
says is there, isn't really there. Maybe there
are no mountains, no rivers. Maybe there's
no such thing as thought; we are only a
dream, we are merely dreaming." His
mother is similarly unsettled, demanding
by the end that John must leave her alone,
that he must go to sleep. Del tries to serve
as the intermediary between the boy and
his mother but ultimately is unable to pro
tect John from the raw savagery of his

mother's depression.
Throughout the play, the actors engage
in a sort of tennis-volley of language,
echoing bits of one another's sentences
and repeating the same phrases over and
over: "Do you remember this blanket?"
"The blanket?" "The blanket that's torn?"
"The torn blanket." "You say the blanket's
torn?" With the wrong actors this could
deteriorate into a sort of self-consciously
Beckett ian confetti of contrivance; here,
however, the overlaps create an interesting
aural texture that presses the audience to
observe the faces of the actors as much as
their language.
The story is compelling and excellently
acted, with much of the content related
through glances and emphasis rather than
through dialogue. The set is visually spare
and objects take on a talismanic quality, al
most becoming characters themselves.
"Do you ever wish you could die? It's
not such a bad feeling." This line that John
delivers to his mother could as well be
asked of the audience — "The Cryp
togram" demands a certain whole-mind
immersion, and the rhythms and concepts
of the play recur long after the viewing,
much like fetches.
