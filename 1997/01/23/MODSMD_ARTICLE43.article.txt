Ward Cleaver, who made a million dollars a
year and dressed in Armani." Soon enough, a
man named Miles is sliding up to her side
with the charm of molasses and a killer Ten
nessee accent to smooth it on.
Alice is by all accounts beautiful and bril
liant (natch), but she lacks the killer pedigree
that every member of the smart-set seems to
sport.
Alice's mother, Roberta, had grown up
reciting Blake and Tennyson while peeling
potatoes for a wealthy white family's dinner;
when Alice is born, her mother dresses her in
the expensive, conservative outfits that mir
ror the clothing of the privileged children
that Roberta cared for. These outfits foster a
feeling of difference that dogs Alice through
out her high school and college years, as she

hobnobs among doctors' daughters and
BAPs (Black American Princesses) while
concealing the fact that her own father is
merely a mailman. —
After graduating from Mount Holyoke,
Alice moves to Manhattan and is hired by a
Newark paper, which insists on feeding her a
constant stream of police-blotter stories and
endless articleiTilbmit ktwer-dass pregnant

The novel proper begins with Alice re
turning from a visit with best friend Cheryl.
Alice is trying to get over Miles, the smooth
charmer who soured after evincing the fa

self next to Jack, a surgeon at Mount Sinai
whom she charms into conversation for the
length of the flight.
Upon returning to New York, lack endears
himself to Alice with a tasteful bouquet of
pale yellow cut French tulips and a dinner in
vite. However, these grace notes fail to hide
Jack's utter lack of self-awareness. Jack re
veals himself to be more and more a dolt
through painfully solipsistic statements that
assume every black man and woman to have
the same rights and privileges that he, as the
fifth installment of a Harvard family legacy,
receives.
lack is the black Ward Cleaver that Alice

always dreamed of, affectionate and commit
ted to their relationship. Hut his lack of class
consciousness brings Alice's lower-class past
to the fore, wracking her with self-doubt over
her lack of a Miss Peterson's School for Girls
diploma.
Their struggle to transcend their differ

lovers makes "Good Hair" particularly en

of college life. - —
Alice is outstandingly real, gifted with a
sense of humor and a certain insouciance
that makes "Good Hair" immediately acces
sible, as well as easy to slip into in the 15-
minute wait for SURE Escort. Still, the book
is far from simplistic — Fitzgerald once said
that the greatest novel is one that's accessible
to the masses yet still stands up to the scruti
ny of the literary establishment. While little
is not, perhaps, at the level of The Next big
Thing, she moves sure-handedly through
various periods of Alice's life without being
torturously Faulknerian about it.
Little's characters are varied and strongly
drawn with a well-placed detail that makes

them spring into sharp focus. ("Holly
Thompson-looked a.s though she were-horn
to he a New York magazine editor") And
Alice tells the narrative in an off-hand, first
person style that never slips into the self-con
sciously vernacular. The story is one that's
heen treated in many a recent chick-flick, but
I think the book format is more germane to
the narrative, as it allows the reader to pause
and think over the more complex hits with
out being swept along by a celluloid tide.
It's a necessary book, in a sense — while
the literary vanguard may dabble in astro
physics theory and construct elegant and ut
terly impenetrable tours de force, it's refresh
ing to read a book so firmly grounded in the
here and now.
