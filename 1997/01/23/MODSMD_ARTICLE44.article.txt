# Having Their Cake
## The
						Sacramento-based band is hitting it big

"Cake is more of a verb than a noun." — John McCrea, singer / guitarist
Submitted for your approval, the latest pop music phenomenon known as
Cake: five polite, clean-cut young men caught in a musical void somewhere be
tween the past and present, torn between the feel-good grooves of funk, coun
try, gospel and mariachi, and the sarcastic irony of alt-rock. Currently, they are
strangers in the strange land known as Post-Alternative-Rock America, having bro
ken into the national consciousness on the strength of their übiquitous single "The
Distance" and their second full-length album, "Fashion Nugget."
Having recently ended a nationwide tour opening for Counting Crows, they are
poised to begin a headlining tour of their own beginning with shows in San Fran
cisco and at Stanford's Dinkelspiel Auditorium next Wednesday.
In 1991, John McCrea moved back to Sacramento after a period with a band in
Los Angeles. Inspired in part by a visit to a New Orleans jazz festival, McCrea

formed Cake wiih the intention of exploring different kinds of grooves.
Original conceptions of the band boasted two drummers and

a full set of horns, which included trumpet player Vincent
DiFiore. In the meantime, future guitarist Greg Brown
was doing time in a local hard rock band, developing a
country twang in his chops which fit in well with what

McCrea wanted to do. "The Sacramento music
scene is very small, so you get to know the other
musicians well," DiFiore said.

Eventually, Cake's lineup coalesced into its
current incarnation, with McCrea, Brown, Di-
Fiore, bassist Victor Diamani and drummer
I odd Roper. DiFiore offered some insight into
Cake's musical heritage when asked about the
band's listening habits while on the road. "We

mostly listen to contemporary R&B and country
swing, like Patsy Cline and Bob Willis & The Texas
Playboys. John likes to listen to Latin big-band
music; he's got this tape of Perez Prado that he listens

to before shows, and it's pretty cool."
There's also some more recent stuff in Cake's tour
bus stereo, as well: "September 67 is a band from Rich

mond, Va., who we really like; we'll be playing with
them at the Fillmore shows. And we also listen to a

little 311, too .. . 'Grassroots,' mostly
Since we're on the same label with them,
our paths cross often when we're

on the road."
After playing around in
the Sacramento area for a
few years, Cake indepen
dently released their first
album, "Motorcade of

Generosity." Capricorn
Records, who in the
1970s was considered a
"Southern-rock" music

label and was attempt
ing a comeback in the
'90s, liked "Motor
cade" enough to li
cense it for distribu
tion in 1995.

"Motorcade" was well-received by critics (the Village Voice called it "unambigu
ity from the near side of cool"), and MTV even aired (lake's low-budget but funny
video for "Rock 'n' Roll Lifestyle," a scathing indictment of scene poseurs. Shortly
thereafter, Capricorn signed Cake, who then started working on what would soon
become "Fashion Nugget."
The album's first single, "The Distance," with its homage to / parody of chunky
hip-hoppish groove-rock, became an unexpected hit; local modern-rock station

Live 105 made "The Dis
tance" No. 1 in its annual

New Year's Countdown,
and MTV has put its
colorful, snappy

If/
video into heavy ro
tation. But has suc
cess changed the
lives of the members
of Cake at all?
"My family's real-

ly excited about it," 1 )il foresaid. "And it's much easier to keep in touch with friends.
Its a fun, interesting thing that's happening in my life, so naturally it's making my
lite better. It's nice to go home for Christmas and have something to talk about."
How do Dil ion s parents feel about their son being in a rock band? "Your par
ents really don't want their kid to run away and join the circus," he said, "but if the
circus is doing preth well, then of course they'll be happy."
(.ake's next single oft "fashion Nugget" is their cover of Gloria Gaynor's disco
classic "I Will Survive," the video for which has just been completed.

On stage, Cake tinkers with their arrangements while remaining a tight unit, im
ploding and exploding at the same time: Roper's steady percussive hand guides the
band as Diamani trades off fluid, funky bass lines against Brown's chugging guitar;
when not punctuating the traditional rock lineup with mariachi-jazz trumpet riffs,
DiFiore provides extra percussion and organ; and on top of it all, McCrea, resplen
dent in floppy fishing hat, bushy goatee and a wardrobe stolen from your grandfa
ther who lives in Miami, strums on an acoustic guitar and sings with a certain grav
elly quality that evokes both sincere passion and bitter sarcasm.
If anything, Cake looks like a college-campus funk band that got pushed
over the edge by playing one too many frat parties.

"We've only played a few of those things," DiFiore said, "and
you feel so invisible playing them ... you feel like another can of
beer for those people. We like to serve our audience, and we re
spect that they might have come a long way to our shows. But
when you get into a situation where you're just another throw
away part of someone's evening, that respect sort of falls apart."
Regardless of how they feel about frat parties, Cake still en
joys playing college campuses and is looking forward to playing at
Stanford. As for playing in theaters with seating, DiFiore said, "It's
nice to have a place for people to put their butts. It's a lot to ask of
audiences to stay on their feet for the whole night."

DiFiore continued,
"The great thing about
theaters like that is that

[the audience] is al
ways focused on
the stage. There's
i something to
be said for

that kind of
focus in a
show. And
the musicians
know they
have to deliver,
since they're
under that sort
of magnifying
glass."
