# Six Stupid Questions with Vince DiFiore of Cake
## 
### 
1. What did you do for New Year's?
1 actually had the night off from performing, so
1 went to a party where there were folks i hadn't
seen since junior high. When you go back and
spend time with people you haven't seen in a
while, you remember a little bit more about
yourself. To see people from that era lends a lit
tle continuity to your life.
2. Who's your favorite Kid In The Hall?
I never watched much Kids In The Ha 11.... 1 saw
Scott Thompson on a few late-night talk shows,
and he's pretty funny.
3. What's your most interesting recurring
dream?
1 seem to have these dreams where 1 m 105t.... 1
remember walking around places looking for
someone, but I couldn't find them, and no one
knows who I am or what I'm doing there.
4. Who's your dream date?
Hillary Clinton.
5. What's your bad habit?
Every once in a while, I II chew tobacco. If there's
something I'm procrastinating on, a little chew
will get me good and nauseous and get me going
on it.
6. What's your favorite lightbulb joke?
Q: How many feminists does it take to screw in a
lightbulb?
A: That's not funny.
