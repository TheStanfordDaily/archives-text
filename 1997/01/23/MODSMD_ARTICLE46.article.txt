## Yes! Yes! Yes! The 						British popsters make up in longevity what they lack in hipness 
### 
The '90s have been tough years for fans of
the British progressive rock super-group Yes.
There was the abortive 1991 "Union"
album (or "Onion," keyboardist Rick Wake
man quipped because it brought tears to your
eyes), which reunited eight Yes-men — there
have been a total of 12 — only to produce an
atonal, disjointed mess, followed three years
later by the cold, sterile corporate rock of the
" Talk" album. So I was naturally a little skep
tical when 1 heard of another Yes "comeback"
album and a live album of old material at that;
Yes seemed destined for a slow decline to
"nostalgia-act" status.
Well, my words taste pretty good now be
cause "Keys to Ascension" (CMC Interna
tional Records) is the most vital Yes album
since the 1983 megahit "90125" and a true
rarity: a live album with a reason for living.
The album captures two nights in San Luis
Obispo by what is the definitive Yes lineup:
vocalist lon Anderson, guitarist Steve Howe,
the aforementioned Wakeman on keyboards,
Chris Squire on bass and Alan White on
drums. During the 70s, these five regularly
topped "best-of" lists in their respective in
strument; this album is good evidence why.
Despite having not played together since the
late '70s, their tight, meticulously arranged
sound shows no signs of rust.
With a catalogue of 15 studio albums —

and to be honest, a lot of substandard filler —
song selection at a Yes concert is pretty cru
cial. Smartly, Yes eschews their '80s arena rock
(remember "Owner of a Lonely Heart") for
their less accessible but far more satisfying
epic mini-symphonies.
The opening track "Siberian Khatru" is a
perfect example of their melange of rock and
classical: In the first three minutes they've
segued from a tricky, swirling intro to bluesy
rock 'n' roll to Vivaldian keyboard runs, all
topped by Anderson's ethereal, almost child
like vocals (with a tone reminiscent of an
emasculated Rod Stewart). When it all clicks,
and for most of "Keys" it does, Yes' music has
truly transport ive powers.
The live portion of this two-disc collection
closes with what are probably their two signa
ture songs, "Roundabout" and "Starship
Trooper." Despite having played these 25-
year-old songs literally thousands of times to
a live audience, Yes approaches these two
pieces with a lean, exuberant attack that
makes them sound new again.
Almost as an afterthought, Yes tacks on
two new studio songs, the 10-minute "Be the
One" and the 20-minute " That, That Is." The
former is a fairly pedestrian tune, although
it's got some nice textures and some good gui
tar work from Howe.
"That, That Is," however, is the best new
Yes song in a very long time and definitely
points to a creative renaissance. Sure, the
lyrics are a bunch of pseudomystical babble,

but Anderson's wide-eyed delivery almost
makes them sound as if they mean some
thing. And musically, this is Yes at its fullest:
dynamic, complex and majestic.
This is the farthest thing from MTV-rock

imaginable, and it has a trendy quotient of
zero, but these five aging hippie virtuosos
have a musical integrity about them that
makes Yes worth rooting for.
