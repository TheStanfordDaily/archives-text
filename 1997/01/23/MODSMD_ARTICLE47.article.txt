# DANNY ELFMAN
## "Music for a Darkened Theatre" 
### 
Behind every good movie is a good sound
track —well, OK, that's not necessarily true, but
behind many a good soundtrack in the movie
theater and on television is Danny Hitman.
This mastermind of everything from the
dark, disturbing theme from "Batman" to the
playful but bone-chilling ballads of the
Pumpkin King of "The Nightmare Before
Christmas" has compiled a two-CD volume
(MCI Records) of some of his most moving
and inspirational music.
This album contains selections from some
of Elfman's greatest scores, including the
dreamlike lullabies of "Edward Scis
sorhands," as well as beloved childhood TV
classics like the themes from "Pee Wee's Play
house" and the animated "Beetlejuice" TV
series. Although many of the movies from
which tracks are taken didn't do so well in the
theaters, we are still able to salvage Elfman's
excellent compositions from the wreckage.

I'm not sure if you can call him a musical
genius, but Elfman's definitely got talent and
creativity. Even music from movies I'd never
seen illustrated this uniqueness. In the first
track from "To Die For,"he combines ele
ments reminiscent of the spooky intro to
"Edward Scissorhands" with a few inter
mixed heavy metal guitar riffs, just enough to
catch you off guard and keep you interested.
F.ven the main titles from "Black Beauty"
are moving in their own sad, sentimental
kind of way. Elfman says in the liner notes
about the "Black Beauty" tracks: "Finally a
chance to really turn on the sentimental valve
up to maximum and if there's one thing I re
ally love, it's sad music."
The only real qualm I had about the album
was that the "Mission: Impossible" tracks
didn't include his version of the opening
theme. There are hints from the main theme
included in the three selections from the
movie, but it's just not the same. 1 was also a
bit disappointed that his theme from"The
Simpsons" was left out of this compilation. I
guess I'll have to do with hearing it every day
at 6 and 6:30.
All in all, you can tell that this composer
puts all his energy into every soundtrack he
produces, be it a blockbuster hit like "Mis
sion: Impossible" or an unheard of film like

"Freeway." Each track is there to take you
through the whole spectrum of moods. And
behind it all is Elfman, a man who shows us
that though unseen, he is equally important
to any actor.
