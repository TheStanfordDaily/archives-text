# METAL MOLLY
## "Surgery for Zebra" 
### 
Metal Molly seems at first listen to be a
VVeezer clone, but in fact this is a talented
group. With "Surgery for Zebra" (Silvertone
Records), Molly rips through tough chords
while incorporating psychedelia and catchy
beats. The group's juvenile Presidents of the
United States of America-ish vocals and ho
hum lyrics hamper the album throughout,
yet somehow the music is appealing regard
less.
The songs begin to get predictable after a
while. The group has a certain songwriting
formula that becomes apparent after the first
few numbers. A hard riff will be followed by
a slow verse, the hard riffs follow up and on
and on. Although it's easy to imagine what
comes next, the group is talented enough to

put a different spin on songs in order to keep
the album fresh.
Molly's bass is virtually nonexistent, but
the guitars and drums stay on the top. Inno
vative use of distortion, feedback and wa-wa
keeps "Zebra" on the move at all times, creat
ing an element of confusion and excitement.
The third song of the album, "PVC," is a
real winner. The timing is excellent and vo
cals are strong, contrasting sharply with the
pathetic opener, "Flipper." The next song,
"Orange," is smart and aggressive, using a
four-note repetition to keep the sound sim
ple and concrete. A brief section of the song
delves into a trippy mood, which is suddenly
interrupted by screeching guitars.
Molly is able to do quite a bit on the album
to differentiate itself from other 90s alterna
tive bands. The group is in sync during the
whole album. Even during the slower songs
"Small Supernova" and "Silver, interest is
maintained. With "Monday is Queer," the
entire tempo of the album is shitted as the
drums begin the song. Progressively, the
strings and vocals enter the picture and be
come strangely cheesy.
If you enjoy the music of Weezer and Green
Day, Metal Molly is definitely for you. If you
not, they're worth checking out anyway.
