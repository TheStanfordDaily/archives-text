## Picture Perfect Terrific performances overcome Campion's bad habits in 'Portrait of a Lady' 
### 
I tried with all my might to hate director
Jane Campion's "The Portrait of a Lady," but
I just couldn't do it.
You see, 1 was one of about five people
who absolutely loathed Campion's Oscar
winning film, "The Piano." To this day I
refuse to forgive Campion for exposing me
to the larger-than-life image of Harvey Kei
tel's nakedness.
With this in mind, 1 sat down for the di
rector's newest creation with a decidedly
hostile attitude but proceeded to be won
over by her film.
Based on the Henry James classic, "Por
trait" shows how Isabel Archer (Nicole Kid
man ) — a sort of early feminist who refuses
proposals of marriage right and left — loses
her freedom to the evil forces of money and
males. This seems very appropriate materi
al for Campion, since the only truly useful
males are either dead or dying.
The strength of the film lies in the cast
ing. Kidman portrays Isabel admirably as a
woman who changes from spirited and in
nocent to submissive and cold. It's perhaps
the most difficult role in the story because,
in his novel, James used lengthy descrip
tions, beyond actions and conversation, to
characterize his heroine.
John Malkovich as Gilbert Osmond, aka
Evil Incarnate, gives one of his patented
creepy performances. His only weakness is
that he never comes across as being nice in
the first place, so it's difficult to understand

why Isabel falls in love with him. The word
"appealing" doesn't really apply to him.
With dark hair pulled back from a very
white brow and lips pursed in calculation,
Barbara Hershey transforms herself into the
villainess Madame Merle. The audience,
like Isabel, is taken in by her friendliness,
only to be shocked when she turns out not
to be what she seems. Other players include
Shelley Duvall as Osmond's obnoxious sis
ter (another bit of appropriate casting), and
Christian Bale ("Little Women") as Os
mond's ultra-pious daughter's spurned
lover. (How could anyone dare to spurn his
love?!)
In case anyone forgets that this is a Cam
pion film, the director has added in some
fairly annoying scenes to remind you. One
such scene uses the look of a silent film com
bined with MTV-ish special effects to show
the pivotal struggle in Isabel's mind over her
attraction to Osmond. The audience gig
gled at this. You're so busy trying to figure
out what the heck is happening that the
message becomes secondary to the effects.
While it was a neat idea to use special effects,
they should have been incorporated a little
more seamlessly.
Despite these moments of weirdness, I
must grudgingly admit that the film had
emotional power, if not thematic strength,
due to a strong cast and a beautiful musical
score. There's very little chance that I would
sit through "The Piano" one more time, but
I could probably handle seeing "The Por
trait of a Lady" again.
