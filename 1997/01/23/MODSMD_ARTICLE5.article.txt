# Reaching out to young readers

### Rito Trevino Contributing writer 
The Lucile Salter Packard Chil
dren's Hospital has launched a lit
eracy program aimed at children
between two months and 5 years
old.
The new "Reach Out and Read"
program will combine the efforts of
pediatricians and community vol
unteers to spark an early interest in
reading and make visits to the clin
ic more enjoyable. The implemen
tation begins in the waiting room,
where volunteers will read to chil
dren in English and Spanish, creat
ing a model for parents.
In the doctor's office, pediatric
residents will talk to parents about
the importance of reading to their
kids, explaining that the vocal and
visual stimuli will help develop
motor skills, language socialization
and autonomy.
Most importantly, after each
visit to the clinic, a child will re

ceive an age-appropriate (and
bilingual for Spanish-speaking
children) book courtesy of Reach
Out and Read. Information about
local libraries, including the chil
dren's hospital's own Family Re
source Library, also will be distrib
uted.
Using these methods, the pro
gram's designers hope to encour
age parents to spend quality time
reading to their children. They
would like to aid literacy among
families that live in poverty or for
other reasons have limited access
to reading resources and pro
grams.
Reading aloud in the waiting
room is nothing new for the clinic.
For the past three years, volun
teers from the Family Resource Li
brary have been reading to chil
dren through a hospital-wide pro
gram. However, the infrequency of
volunteer visits has inspired the
need for a more involved literacy
program.
According to program director
Tamar Gershon, a pediatrician at
the hospital, the pediatric clinic is
the ideal environment for the pro
motion of literacy because the doc
tors have one-on-one contact with
parents long before their children
begin school.
"The emphasis is not on teach
ing children how to read," Gershon
explained. "We're more interested
in engendering an enthusiasm and

love of books by the time children
enter school and creating an inter
action among parents, children
and books."
Reach Out and Read has re
ceived a grant from the Packard
Foundation and is currently await
ing its first order of 1,000 books.
Further book donations to the pro
gram will be used to establish a
new library for the clinic.
Meanwhile, pediatric residents
are being given preliminary train
ing for their roles in distributing
books and conveying information
to parents. They will be supervised
by attending pediatricians in the
visiting rooms.
Reach Out and Read is modeled
after a successful program of the
same name developed at Boston
City Hospital. The Boston pro
gram is 8 years old and serves as a
training site for literacy programs
in pediatric clinics and hospitals
nationwide.
According to a 1991 pilot study,
parents who had received books
and literacy information through
Reach Out and Read in Boston
were four times more likely to
choose reading aloud as an activity
with their children.

The hospital is recruiting volun
teers to be involved in Reach Out
and Read. Members of the Stanford
community aged 16 and over, par
ticularly those who also speak
Spanish, are invited to help by read
ing to children in pediatric clinic
waiting rooms for about two hours a
week. Those interested in joining
the program should call 725-8314.
