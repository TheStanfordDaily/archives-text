## Few belly laughs in Farley's flaky, familiar 'Beverly Hills Ninja' 
### 
These days, screenwriters will dream up
the most peculiar things to get a laugh out of
movie audiences.
Just imagine this scene: Ghris Farley, chub
by comedian extraordinaire, jumps onto the
stage of a exotic dance club. After being mes
merized by the scantily clad women before
him, he proceeds to strip himself...
Let's just say you don't want to eat your
popcorn until after you've seen that scene.
That's the way things go throughout "Beverly
Hills Ninja," a campy comedy that does ab
solutely no justice to the efforts of Bruce Lee or
Chuck Norris. But of course, that's the point.
Farley stars as Haru, a man raised since in

fancy in Japan by ninjas who hoped that he
would someday become the legendary Great
White Ninja. Unfortunately, his physical at
tributes and general clumsiness prevent him
from graduating from his dojo.
Haru's luck improves when he is visited by
the blond and beautiful Allison (Nicollette
Sheridan). She wants him to use his ninja
abilities to spy on her boyfriend Martin
(Nathaniel Parker), whom she suspects is in
volved in criminal activity.
Haru learns that Martin is planning to cre
ate fake yen but has yet to retrieve half of the
bills' design plates from the United States.
Our hero leaves his beloved ninja family to
travel to the Hills of Beverly, cleverly disguised
as a pimp, on a quest to stop the counterfeit
ing, get the girl and basically prove himself as

the Great White Ninja.
Notwithstanding the flaky story and the
stripping scene, "Beverly Hills Ninja" man
ages to get a good laugh out of the crowd with
slapstick. Farley is up to his regular old tricks,
slamming his head into various objects,
knocking things over and ripping his clothes
as he bends over. Various one-liners are also
worked in with good form, although they
don't seem so funny when the movie's over.
On the other hand, the humor is very pre
dictable. Anybody's who's seen "Tommy Boy,"
"Black Sheep" or "Saturday Night Live" will
be expecting Farley's raucous style. When
Haru starts bowing before his ninja masters,
you know he's bound to knock heads with
one of them.
The movie is backed with a reasonable

supporting cast. Chris Rock ("C84,"
"Boomerang") adds his popular brand of at
titude as Joey, Haru's loyal disciple. ("Haven't
you heard of the Great Black Ninja?") Robin
Shou ("Mortal Kombat") portrays Haru's
"older brother" Gobei, compensating for Far
ley's normally bad form with some true mar
tial arts talent.
Big fans (no pun intended) of Farley will
be delighted to see the actor's a la Power
Ranger poses and newfound skills at handling
and mishandling respected Japanese
weapons. But if the rest of you are looking for
a worthwhile mix of comedy and butt-kick
ing, you're better off seeing the new Jackie
Chan flick.
