# New fellowship will support research on semiconductors

A doctoral student in material science and engineer
ing will be the first recipient of a new $75,000 Stanford
fellowship aimed at supporting semiconductor re
search.
Michael Perkins, who does research related to the
metrology — or measurement — of ultra-thin films
used in making integrated circuits, was awarded the fel
lowship earlier this week by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology and the Semiconductor Re
search Corporation.
Perkins will use the NIST / SRC fellowship for tu
ition and will receive an annual stipend. The fellowship
will also grant him internship opportunities at the
NIST laboratory.
Electrical Engineering Research Prof. Robert
Helms, Perkins' adviser, said he was pleased with his
student's award.
Helms, who heads an existing SRC-sponsored re
search program at Stanford, was approached to select
the first student to receive the fellowship.
"When I was asked whom to select, a very good stu
dent came to mind, and that student was Michael,"
Helms said
Helms said Perkins' work on dielectric fdms will con
tribute to the future generations of computer chips

"We are all interested in making chips that are small
er, thinner and have more power," Helms said. He cited
the Intel Pentium chip as an example of a technology
that has benefited from integrated circuit research.
NIST is the first government agency to co-sponsor a
fellowship with the SRC, a research consortium of near
ly 50 semiconductor companies, including IBM, Mo
torola and Intel.
The SRC, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C.,
supports a total of 36 fellowships nationwide and has in
vested more than $340 million in semiconductor re
search since its formation in 1982.
According to Helms, the electronics division of
NIST and the SRC chose Stanford because "we are
the best."
In addition, Stanford's current relationship with
the SRC, in the form of a $140,000 research program
investigating metrology and surface engineering, fa
cilitated the new fellowship's arrival at the University.
"Through co-sponsored graduate fellowships, such
as this one supported by NIST, SRC participants are
able to support and expand research in areas of particu
lar interest to them," said Larry Sumney, SRC presi
dent and chief executive officer.
"As the fellows graduate and enter the semiconduc
tor work force, they also improve the transfer of SRC
funded research results to the industry," Sumney
added.
