# Layoffs forced at SLAC

### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
When James Jue, a graphic
technology specialist at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center,
tried to reach his computer termi
nal earlier this week, he found
himself locked out.
Along with 10 other SLAC
workers, Jue will be laid off in
early February.
According to P. A. Moore, assis
tant for public affairs to the direc
tor of SLAC, a 5-percent cut in
federal funding forced SLAC to
reduce its operating budget.
Funded by the Department of
Energy, SLAC depends heavily on
congressional appropriations.
The "current Congress and ad
ministration have agreed to bal
ance the budget," but the cuts are
mainly affecting discretionary
spending, such as SLAC funding,
rather than entitlements, Moore
said.
According to SLAC's Person
nel Director Lee Lyon, layoffs
were necessary because "a high
percentage of [SLAC's] budget
goes to labor."
The 11 involuntary layoffs fol
low 26 voluntary layoffs made
last October. SLAC also made 28
voluntary and 42 involuntary lay
offs early in 1996.
Jue, who spent 34 years at
SLAC, believes that he deserves
more consideration.
"All they care about is the
buck," he said. "After all this
time, they treat me like I am
nothing."
At 60, Jue said he is pes
simistic about being able to find
another job. He expects it will be
tough to make his money stretch
out until retirement.
"Stanford University is sup
posed to be the greatest institu
tion in the world," he said. "Ajl
they care about are Nobel Prizes.
What about the people?"
