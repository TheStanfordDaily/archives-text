## Clinton, Annan meet in D.C. U.N. leader promises reform, president will work on late dues 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
new U.N. secretary-general, Kofi
Annan, told President Clinton yes
terday he would push for "a
reformed United Nations" and
won a promise in return that Clin
ton would work with Congress to
pay America's long-tardy dues.
"We cannot expect to lead
through the United Nations unless
we are prepared to pay our own
way and to pay what we owe,"
Clinton said.
Annan also found a warm
reception in some parts of the
Capitol, where support for the
world body has not been as strong
as at the White House.
Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee and a strong critic of the
United Nations, met with Annan
both privately and with other com
mittee members.
"If reforms are piecemeal, if the
status quo persists, then you will
have a very difficult time convinc
ing Congress to send more Ameri
can tax dollars to the U.N.," Helms
told the U.N. leader.
Helms, R-N.C., said he would
introduce legislation that would

set "benchmarks for U.N. reform
and that rewards U.N. reform as
those benchmarks are met."
A U.N. official, speaking on con
dition of anonymity, said Annan
told Helms that he was "uncom
fortable" with the idea of bench
marks and recommended that
U.N. and committee aides get
together to "exchange ideas."
Annan, of Ghana, said at the
White House just before meeting
Clinton, "I don't think I should be
seen as a beggar." And no one in
the administration, which had
vetoed Boutros Boutros-Ghali's re
election at the U.N., was treating
him like one.
But Annan, at every stop, said
he needs help from the United
States and other countries who are
not meeting their U.N. financial
obligations.
The United States supplies
about 25 percent of U.N. funding
but is about $1 billion in arrears on
its dues, which have been withheld
by Congress.
"As long as the United Nations
does its part, we should simply be
prepared to pay our debts and pay
our dues," Clinton said.
