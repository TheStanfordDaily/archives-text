Hawaii gets cold feet
HONOLULU (AP) — A proposed state constitutional amend
ment to ban same-sex marriages speedily won approval yesterday in
the state House from lawmakers scrambling to undo Hawaiian court
rulings.
The House, with a 44-7 vote, sent the expedited measure to the
state Senate, where similar legislation is expected to have similar
support. If approved, the proposed amendment would go before vot
ers in November 1998.
Hawaii's Supreme Court in 1993 ruled that denying marriage
licenses to same-sex couples violates the state Constitution's equal
protection clause. In 1994, the Legislature limited marriage to oppo
site-sex couples.
Circuit Judge Kevin Chang ruled last month that the state had
failed to show a compelling reason to ban same-sex marriages, but
held off his order to license them pending the state's appeal back to
the state Supreme Court.
"The judicial branch of government has at this point refused to
recognize this legislative policy," said Rep. Terrance Tom, chair of
the House Judiciary Committee.
Attorney Dan Foley, who represented three same-sex couples in
their lawsuit against the state, said the House-passed amendment is
legally flawed and is unlikely to be accepted by the Senate in its cur
rent form.
"They may eventually come up with a constitutional amendment,
but it won't be this one," Foley predicted. "It was just rushed
through."
Finders, keepers
MIAMI (AP) — Police have recovered only about $300 of the
$800,000 that spilled into one of Miami's poorest neighborhoods two
weeks ago when a Brinks truck overturned on a highway overpass.
"We're still hopeful the money will be returned," said Marven
Moss, a spokesman at Brinks Inc.'s Darien, Conn., headquarters.
And police said yesterday that they won't give up the search for the
bills, coins and food stamps that spilled onto the streets of Overtown
on Jail. 8.
"We're doing the best we can to recover it," said Sgt. Jack
Andrews, who heads the case.
Police met with laughter and slamming doors when they can
vassed the neighborhood after the accident asking residents to
return any stolen cash.
