# School officials tackle Ebonics before Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - School offi
cials who touched off a national contro
versy by recognizing a distinct form of
black English said yesterday they were
only trying to help children learn in the
common tongue.
Facing a Senate panel with control
over federal aid to schools, the Oakland
officials said the debate over Ebonics
overshadowed the real issue: what to do
about the failure of urban schools to close
the gap between white and black achieve
ment on standard tests.
The Ebonics issue has touched off a
national debate. The Oakland school sys
tem has been accused of embracing slang
and bad grammar in an effort to make
black children feel good while learning
less and raising the issue to snag more of
the $10 billion in federal aid to schools.
"The central issue is the underachieve
ment of African-American and other
minority children and what we are doing
to address this dismal record," Carolyn
Getridge, superintendent of the Oakland
Unified School District, said yesterday.
More than half the district's 52,269
students are black. Those black children
had average grades of 1.8, compared with
a district average of 2.12 and more than
3.0 for white and Chinese students,
respectively.
The district gets about $14 million in
federal help for teacher training and

other activities, Education Secretary
Richard Riley has said he would release
no money used for bilingual education to
help with an Ebonics program. But a
group of House members, led by Rep.
Peter King, R-N.Y., also wants to deny
other federal aid to Oakland.
The school board in December adopted
a resolution recognizing Ebonics —
known among linguists as African-Amer
ican Vernacular English — as a unique
language, putting it on a level with for
eign languages. Black psychologist
Robert L. Williams coined the shorter
term 24 years ago by meshing the words
"ebony" and "phonics."
It effectively endorses training teach
ers to recognize Ebonics as a language
and use methods like those used in an
existing California program to teach chil
dren whose first language is something
other than English.
The methods vary, but one in place in
Chicago — which has not embraced
Ebonics — has teachers do what parents
are taught to do: Correct gently by
repeating the statement in standard
English.
Because of the controversy, the school
board made it clear this month that it did
not want to teach children in Ebonics but
instead ease them into common English
without ridiculing their speech or treat
ing it as inferior.
