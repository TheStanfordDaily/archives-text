# Medicare plan gets chilly response
## Republicans unhappy with increasing cost of home health care 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen
ate Republicans gave a frosty
reception to President Clinton's
Medicare plan yesterday, slam
ming it for moving the exploding
costs of home health care from a
nearly bankrupt trust fund into
the general federal budget.
"The president ought to be
ashamed," Sen. Phil Gramm, R-
Texas, said yesterday as the
plan's outline got its first con
gressional hearing. "This is a pro
posal that says 'I am content to
deceive the American people.' "
The Senate Budget Commit
tee also questioned Clinton's
plan to cut payments to health
maintenance organizations and
said the president had failed to
offer a long-term solution for
Medicare as baby boomers

approach retirement.
"Clearly, the policy proposals
are under serious attack in this
committee," said the committee
chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M.
Just hours after the Clinton
Medicare plan was announced
Tuesday, key House Republicans
gave the president rave reviews
for meeting Republicans halfway
on budget savings. They reserved
judgment on policy issues, but
said Clinton's effort had bright
ened chances for a bipartisan
deal.
Senate Republicans praised
parts of the plan, such as requir
ing providers to detail more costs
in advance and allowing new
managed care options.
But generally, they signaled a

tough road ahead.
Some suggested that Medicare
charge wealthier beneficiaries
higher premiums. The adminis
tration says it is willing to consid
er it.
"I'm not necessarily opposed
to that," Clinton said Wednesday
in the interview with television
station WBIS in New York, say
ing it should be considered in the
context of "a long-term fix."
Republicans were most criti
cal of Clinton's plan to move bil
lions of dollars in home health
care costs out of Medicare's
nearly bankrupt hospital trust
fund, which is financed through
payroll taxes. Moving this to
Medicare's other half, called
Part B, would go a long way to
securing the trust fund's

finances for another decade.
In a similar plan last year,
Clinton proposed transferring
$55 billion in home health costs
to Part B over five years. There
were no estimates available for
how much would be transferred
in Clinton's latest plan.
Most of Part B is financed with
general revenues from the feder
al budget and a quarter of the
costs are paid by beneficiaries
through premiums. Clinton's
plan would exempt home health
from the calculation that deter
mines premiums. By doing this,
the plan would not increase pre
miums and taxpayers would foot
the entire bill for home health
care.
"It's very, very expensive,"
Domenici said.
