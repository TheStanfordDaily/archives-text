# Former Vichy official to stand trial
## 
### 
PARIS (AP) â€” France's high
est court rejected a final appeal
yesterday and ordered former
Vichy official Maurice Papon to
stand trial for deporting Jews to
death camps during World War 11.
The ruling against Papon, 86,
clears the way for a trial that
could begin as early as this fall.
He is the last living Frenchman
facing trial for war crimes and
would be the highest-ranking offi
cial of the government of Nazi
occupied France to be tried for
such crimes.
In accordance with French

legal procedure, Papon will
remain free until the day before
the trial. Jewish groups have
asked that he be placed under
house arrest and his passport con
fiscated to prevent him from flee
ing.
Papon is charged with ordering
the arrest and deportation of
1,690 French Jews between 1942
and 1944, when he was a local
Vichy police supervisor in the
southwestern city of Bordeaux.
He has denied any wrongdoing,
saying he knew nothi' r about the
Holocaust, never en iced Nazi

ideology and was just doing his
job.
"This will be the trial of one
man and his personal responsibil
ity," said Gerard Boulanger, a
lawyer representing the first Jew
ish families who filed suit more
than 15 years ago.
"But it is clear that it will also
be an important moment in mod
ern history, shedding light on the
exact and terrible role that Vichy
played in the Holocaust," he told
reporters. "It will reopen one of
the saddest chapters in French
history."

The only Frenchman convicted
of crimes against humanity in
postwar France was Paul Touvi
er, a militia chief in Lyon. He died
in prison in July.
Rene Bousquet, Vichy's
national police chief and Papon's
superior, was assassinated in
1993 on the eve of his war crimes
trial.
Other top-ranking Vichy offi
cials escaped war crimes trials
because the extent of France's
collaboration in the extermina
tion of Jews was kept secret for
years.
