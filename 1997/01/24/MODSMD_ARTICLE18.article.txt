Rejection of the socially
responsible endowment
fund was disgraceful

THE DECISION BY the Spe
cial Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility to pre
emptively reject a progressive
endowment fund proposal was a
slap in the face to every student,
professor and staff member who
has ever worked for a responsible
University investment policy.
Hopefully, it will go down in Stan
ford history as an anomaly in an
otherwise uplifting story of
increased ethical concern for the
consequences of the University's
investments.
The progressive endowment
fund — recently renamed the
socially responsible fund — was
exactly the kind of proposal that
the University administration,
along with the Board of Trustees,
ought to have encouraged. Stu
dents, working together peaceably,
recognized a problem with the way
the University currently invests
its endowment; they came up with
a draft plan, spoke to all the right
people in power and were about to
finalize their proposal. Then,
before they were given a full and
fair hearing, a special committee
of the Board of Trustees rejected
their proposal out of hand.
What is this radical plan that
the SCIR couldn't wait to reject?
Did these kids really think they
could dictate University invest
ment policy? Hardly. A common
misconception about the socially
responsible fund is that the stu
dents want to subject all Stanford
investment decisions to their par
ticular moral vision. In fact, the
proposal is quite modest. It advo
cates the establishment of a new
and completely independent fund
to be built up through alumni
donations that would be invested
according to three levels of ethical
criteria.
The outright rejection of the

proposal was a shocking abdica
tion of the SCIR's role as ethical
watchdog for investment deci
sions. There are legitimate debates
to be had about the meaning of
"socially responsible investing,"
and the students could have done a
better job explaining exactly what
they meant by it; but surely
nobody wants to see Stanford take
the position that morality plays no
part in its investment decisions.
So, what next? Those working
on the proposal are now consider
ing various options. The first thing
they'll want to do is increase the
pressure on top administration
officials — particularly University
President Gerhard Casper and
Provost Condoleezza Rice — to
address the issue of investment
responsibility. Presumably, nei
ther Casper nor Rice wants to be
linked to child labor or the oppres
sive SLORC regime in Burma.
Forcing the administration, facul
ty and students to understand the
very real consequences of unethi
cal investing should be the first
order of business.
Secondly, they'll want to dig
into the ASSU itself. Take a look at
the investment decisions of the
ASSU and see if there's a possibil
ity of establishing a pilot progres
sive endowment by and for the stu
dent government. If students in
the future could show the Board of
Trustees an example of a success
ful socially responsible fund at
Stanford, they would have much
more credibility.
Finally, there's a chance that a
student group could set up an inde
pendent socially responsible fund
that would donate its profits — or
a percentage of its profits — to the
University. There's even been talk
of getting the Senior Class presi
dents to agree to donate the senior
gift to start such a fund. The estab
lishment of a renegade endowment
fund, admittedly a novel idea,
would go a long way toward con
vincing the University that sub
stantial support exists for a fund
that would both support Stanford
and invest conscientiously.
