## Bringing bowling back 
### 
Tiger woods, brevin
Knight. Kate Starbird. You know
these names — they're some of
Stanford's biggest athletic stars. Now,
try this name: Ward Bullard. That's
right, Ward Bullard. Sound familiar?
Probably not, but Bullard is bringing to
Stanford something that has not been
around since the good old days of yore.
A tangible mascot? A functioning art
museum? No, I sing of the Stanford
bowling team.
This week I rolled to Mel's Bowl in
Redwood City to practice with the team.
I met the core of four, each with his own
nickname: Matt "Ointment" Crystal,
Tak "Tak Gun" Nomura, Parker
"Grits" Hume and, of course, Ward
"Guacamole" Bullard. With their bowl
ing shirts and boyish charm, the four
some oddly resembled the pop band
"Weezer."
All are frosh from Otero (except
Parker, who hails from Branner). They
have been practicing since October,
when they found out about the Califor
nia Intercollegiate Bowling Confer
ence's first tournament only two days
before it happened. They bowled any
way, wearing polo shirts of mixed colors
and using house balls and shoes. Their
equipment deficiencies didn't stop them
however — Parker picked up the team's
first "point" by beating another bowler
in his all-time best game of 191.
The team was frank about their
problems scoring points since then.
"Guacamole" explained: "We've com

peted in three tournaments so far, each
with a possible 50 points. Out of 150
possible points, we have four." Stanford
is 12th out of 12. Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, just ahead at 11th, has 43
points. The Weenies are not far away in
10th place.
Ward and his men face many obsta
cles before reaching their goal of bowl
ing at the National Bowling Center in
fair Reno. Stanford is the only team in
the conference without on-campus
lanes and faces schools that give schol
arships, like San Diego and San Jose
State. Short on funds, the team has pro
posed the idea of a "Stanford Bowling
Alumni Memorial Bowling Center."
Each bowler brings his own unique
way of bowling to the team. Schooled in
the ways of Japanese bowling, "Tak
Gun" related the difficulties of travel
ing home to the lanes of South Tokyo
with his bowling ball. "It's heavy," he
said. Tak is also the team's "bowling
theorist," consulting technical manuals
during practice.
Matt bowls with his grandfather's
60-year-old monogrammed ball. "The
ball has sentimental value," he says.
"It's kind of like 'The Natural,' with
Robert Redford and his bat, only this is
bowling." Matt snapped pictures for the
team's Web site, located at www
leland.stanford.edu/~hardhat/sba.html.
Matt also is the team's only "Brooklyn"
bowler, meaning that his ball breaks
between the front and left pins, rather
than the front and right. Continuing to

compare bowling to baseball, he offered
the following illustration: "It's like the
difference between a curve and slider,
or maybe a curve and a screwball."
Parker knows bowling aphorisms.
After I got a 7-10 split (the worst possi
ble), he offered this Nietzschean
nugget: "People get strikes; bowlers get
spares." When he saw me aiming the
ball, his teachings leaned toward Zen:
"Trust in the ball."
Ward fills many roles, serving as the
team's coach, captain and president. He
wants to organize a women's team as
well, though not on the model of the
"wholesome honies" of Fresno State's
women's bowling team. Interested girls
should call Ward. Overwhelmed by
administrative duties, Ward lamented a
recent decline in his bowling technique.
He confided: "Ever since Christmas,
I've been bowling like ass."
Today is a big day for the team. Not
only do they get this column, but at 4
p.m. they meet with University Presi
dent Gerhard Casper. "What will you
talk about," I asked. "Bowling," Ward
said.
Stupid question.

James Silver suggests that you watch
the team bowl tomorrow at San Jose
State's Student Center.
