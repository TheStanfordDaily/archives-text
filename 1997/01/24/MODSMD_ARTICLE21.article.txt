Anthropology grad students support Prof Gupta

WE ARE WRITING to express
our frustration and thorough
dismay at the administration's
decision to deny tenure to Anthropology
Prof. Akhil Gupta. As students of the
Department of Anthropology, we feel it
necessary to comment on the crucial
role that Gupta plays both as a member
of the anthropology faculty at Stanford
and as a pioneer in building the reper
toire of contemporary anthropological
theory. We believe that Gupta's tenure
is essential to maintaining the Universi
ty's commitment to intellectual excel
lence and therefore implore the admin
istration to reconsider and reverse its
decision.
Gupta's presence at Stanford contin
ues to be cited as a leading factor in
attracting students to the Anthropology
Department. He is highly sought after as
an adviser and mentor by students both
within and beyond the department. His
graduate seminars are among the most
popular and academically rigorous, and
his research contributes greatly to the
intellectual diversity of the Anthropolo

gy Department. Additionally, Gupta and
his partner, Purnima Mankekar, repre
sent the core of a regional focus on
South Asia, not only within the depart
ment but also within the School of
Humanities and Sciences in general.
Furthermore, in consideration of the
findings of last year's visiting commit
tee, Gupta's promotion to a tenured
position is vital both to maintaining the
number of senior faculty and addressing
the current situation of understaffing in
the department.
Gupta's work is at the center of con
temporary anthropological discussions
and has paved the way for a reconceptu
alization of the parameters of the disci
pline. For example, Gupta is among the
leading anthropologists who have revo
lutionized theories about culture and
anthropological methodologies. His
stature within the discipline is evidenced
by the fact that he is one of the top two
most cited professors within Stanford's
Anthropology Department.
In addition, a preliminary look at the
1995 volume of the Annual Review of

Anthropology reveals 10 references for
Gupta (as compared to four for Clifford
Geertz and nine for Marshall Sahlins,
two luminaries in the field). We believe
these numbers underscore Gupta's cen
trality to contemporary cultural anthro
pology. His work has shown the inade
quacy and inapplicability of traditional
models of static and spatially circum
scribed cultures to the increasingly
transnational and fluid global environ
ment.
Gupta's work combines the strength
of a variety of social science perspectives
and therefore appeals to a wider intellec
tual community. For example, his work
on the state brings together political eco
nomic, historical and anthropological
approaches in looking at cultural con
structions of the state. This work repre
sents a crucial advancement in the ways
in which the state has been conceptual
ized both within and outside anthropolo
gy-
As students of anthroplogy, we fear
that the potential negative ramifications
of denying Gupta's tenure will be

tremendous. Not only will the Anthro
pology Department lose one of the
brightest minds in the field today, but
the negative tenure decision will
inevitably damage the reputation both of
the department and the institution as a
leading research and academic center
internationally. We feel that the Univer
sity's ability to attract leading faculty
and students will be seriously under
mined. In addition, Stanford's graduate
students' futures as academics will be
seriously compromised by the tarnished
image of the institution.
We therefore appeal to the adminis
tration to reverse a decision that would
do grave injustice to Gupta and would
also pose a major threat to maintaining
the University's commitment to intellec
tual excellence.
