## Three reasons why the inauguration is better than the Super Bowl 
### 
ON MY FLIGHT
back to San
Francisco, I
began to think about
what I would want to
tell people back on the
Farm about my experi
ence at the inaugura
tion.
I guess the easiest

thing to do would have been to explain
the differences between seeing one
through the eyes of a television camera
and witnessing one in person. Unfortu
nately, I have attended the last three and
the one before that was canceled due to
cold weather (as such, I would have to go
back to 1980 — the only thing I can
remember of that inauguration is how
bad I felt for the plain-spoken man from
Plains, Ga.).
Another thought occurred to me: Why
not try to compare the experience of the
inauguration to an event to which most
people can relate: the Super Bowl? In

this editorial, I will try to persuade you
that attending the presidential inaugu
ration was better than even attending a
Super Bowl. (My one regret in this com
parison is seeing my brother's disap
pointed face — similar to the time that I
asked him to switch from "Monday
Night Football" to "Murphy Brown.")
Attending the inauguration is better
for three simple reason . First, although
both the Super Bowl and the inauguration
crown "champions," only the Super Bowl
ends with a loser; second, the inaugura
tion is more unique; and third, the real
and symbolic significance of the inaugura
tion is unparalleled. Let me try to explain
each of these reasons in more depth.
The inauguration would fail as a sports
metaphor because at it there are no
losers. Sure, Bob Dole was in Washing
ton, but he is finished licking nis wounds
and has moved on to other promising
careers. Unlike the Super Bowl, after the
two-hour ceremony, everyone in the audi
ence at the inauguration remained happy.

The sense of community — of the march
toward a common goal — is overwhelm
ing. The participants at the inauguration
will be the builders of the bridge to the
21st century.
The simplest advantage that attend
ing an inauguration has over attending a
Super Bowl is that it happens one-quar
ter the amount of time. Each January, on
usually the fourth Sunday, we all can
appreciate the Super Bowl. An inaugura
tion only occurs after four straight Super
Bowls: As such, it is four times as special!
Consider this from a slightly different
perspective. At the end of the year, dif
ferent sports commentators will point to
different best games: New England vs.
Green Bay, Stanford vs. Cal, Florida
State vs. Florida. All political commenta
tors will agree that the presidential inau
guration was the best inauguration of
the year in which it occurred. The inau
guration of the New Jersey governor, 112 r
example, fails in comparison.
The final reason that attending an

inauguration is better than attending the
Super Bowl is that its significance dwarfs
the competition. At the inauguration,
power and authority are bestowed upon
the president-elect. At this inauguration,
the president and the president-elect
were one and the same. At most inaugu
rations, however, power is officially
transferred from one individual to anoth
er. In this one event he highest-ranking
judge in the United States administers
the oath of office at the seat of all federal
legislative power in the United States to
the chief executive of the United States.
This action legitimizes our democratic
form of government and perpetuates the
peaceful transition between terms, presi
dents and parties.
At a slightly less philosophical level,
the consequences of the inauguration
matter in my life. Next Monday, I'm
fairly certain that my life will not have
changed as a result of either a Packer or
Patriot victory. Had Bob Dole won in
November, I think it is fair to sav that

my life last Tuesday would have been
qualitatively different from my life last
Sunday. Dole would have begun disman
tling the Department of Education (on
which I rely for loans), restructuring
federal grants to universities (on which
I depend upon for food and shelter) and
tearing down the welfare state (on
which I will rely for food and shelter
after I receive my doctorate).
I mean no disrespect to those who will
begin planning their Super Bowl parties
after reading this editorial. Rather, I just
want to make you aware of the impor
tance of an event that occurred this past
Monday — an event that I was lucky
enough to attend.
By the way, why didn't Bill Parcells
call President Clinton after he took the
oath of office to congratulate him? That
this didn't happen should be proof
enough of which event is "better."
