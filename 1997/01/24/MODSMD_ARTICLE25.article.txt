McMorrow got
Okada all wrong
Where does Meredith McMorrow (yes
terday's Daily) ground her argument
against Ujamaa? I think it might be a lit
tle suspect. As her co-resident in Okada
last year, I question her assertions about
theme dorms and Okada in particular.
Meredith lived in Okada for one quar
ter. Did she really have enough exposure
to Okada to draw any substantive con
clusions about the Asian Americans in
the dorm?
She described Okada as polarizing
into the "AASA-ites vs. the non-AASA
ites, the Asian Americans vs. the 'true'
Asians." No resident of Okada was
active in AASA last year. Again, I ques
tion how familiar McMorrow was with
the Asian Pacific American community
in Okada.
But McMorrow's letter raises larger
questions in my mind: Why does society
seem to say it is OK for the white com
munity to be divided on issues, but com
munities of color can only have one
homogeneous identity? Is a numerical
inequity inherently racist in a democrat
ic society? These are issues that ethnic

theme houses are continuously con
fronting.
As a member of this year's Okada
staff, I would like to say that ethnic
theme houses are always re-evaluating
their relation to their respective ethnic
communities, as well as the larger Stan
ford community. We are certainly
already aware of the tensions surround
ing race and ethnicity. It is a travesty for
anyone to assume that we have taken
them for granted.
Ethnic theme houses are sites for dia
logue about race and ethnicity. Through
thought and discussion, we can navigate
our society and celebrate our identities.

An open letter to
Casper from
Naylor and Rubin
Dear President Casper,
Whether you know it or not, you've got
a problem. It would be easy for you to dis
miss Jim Finsten as just a provocative
Daily columnist, but as student leaders
we assure you that the problems Jim
speaks of are real, not imaginary, and the

student movements he describes will not
evaporate but persist.
Delay, stall, ignore. From first-hand
experience each of us is familiar with
what Finsten deems your motto. In Octo
ber, a draft proposal for a socially respon
sible endowment fund was submitted to
the chairman of the Special Committee
on Investment Responsibility, which inci
dentally has no student members. Until
two weeks ago, there was no response: no
phone calls, no e-mails, no meetings, no
attempts to communicate whatsoever. In
mid-November, Bill Shen and Nick
Thompson, the elected executives of the
student body, sent you a letter regarding
their views on the endowment fund pro
posal. The letter remains unanswered. In
the meantime, just as students began to
suspect the disappearance of the draft
proposal, a memo rejecting it outright
was mailed to those involved. Additional
ly, several new members were inexplica
bly added to the committee, tripling the
size of the committee.
On another front, members of the
Greek community still await the final
report of the Greek Task Force, which is
rumored to be finished in mid-February.
Yet even if the task force meets this
alleged deadline, it will still be more than
six months behind its original schedule.

And although the task force's report will
include an evaluation of the University's
current fraternal housing policy, under
which sororities are denied access, many
women on campus fear that the issue will
again be suppressed when the new com
mittee on undergraduate housing that
you recently created begins its work. At
both last spring and this fall's "Tea and
Cookies," you refused to comment on
whether the University is or is not in vio
lation of Title IX by not offering sorority
housing. Similarly, Equal Rights Advo
cates, one of the nation's foremost
authorities on gender discrimination,
recently informed Biology Prof. Robert
Simoni, chair of the Greek Task Force,
that Stanford is, in its legal opinion,
indeed violating Title IX. Still, we await
your public statement.
Make no mistake, we are not attempt
ing to entangle two very different, con
troversial issues for the sake of winning
our respective battles. Indeed, neither
one of us is remotely involved with the
other's organizational efforts, having
never even met prior to authoring this
letter. However, we are united in our
frustration with the University's seem
ingly intentional attempt to exclude stu
dents from meaningful participation in
decision making. Although we are well

aware of student representation on some
University committees, when complex
issues arise, University committees often
seem more like insular time-stalling
devices and less like the effective, demo
cratic processes we envision and desire.
Moreover, we recognize that you were
not directly involved in some of the afore
mentioned events and / or processes.
Still, as president, you are responsible for
ensuring that the University's ultimate
goals are attained. According to the
Founding Grant, chief among those
objectives was preparing students for
"greater service to the public." Stanford
must impress upon its students the
importance of active citizenship, yet
many of our peers shun political partici
pation. Until the University truly values
student input, Stanford cannot claim to
adequately achieve this mission.
Indeed, President Casper, Jim Finsten
was right. Our movements are gaining
momentum, and now that we know what
it takes to get your attention, your prob
lems may just be beginning.
