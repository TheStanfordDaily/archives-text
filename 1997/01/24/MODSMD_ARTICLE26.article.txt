## The 						Cardinal regroups for a Husky win 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
SEATTLE — Down three
starters, the third-ranked Stan
ford women's basketball team
(19-1, 7-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
entered last night's game in a
vulnerable position against con
ference rivaJ Washington (8-7,3-
3 Pac-10). In the end, it was
Washington who was looking
extremely vulnerable as the Car
dinal administered the Huskies'
worst home loss in 16 years,
routing Washington 90-64
before 5,832 sweetly silent
Husky fans in Hec Edmundson
Pavilion.
This year, it was Stanford's
starting front line that followed
in the footsteps of Kristin Folkl
and senior point guard Jamila
Wideman with a legendary per
formance in Edmundson. Junior
forward Heather Owen had a
career-high 24 points and 10
rebounds, junior center Olympia
Scott had 18 points and nine
boards and senior forward Kate
Starbird had a game-leading 30
points (placing her seventh on
the Pac-10's all-time scoring list
with 1,892 points). Wideman

provided a big boost off the
bench as well, looking very spry
on her feet on her way to an 8-
point, no-turnover performance.
"The type of game that
Heather had tonight is so impor
tant to our team," said Stanford
head coach Tar a VanDerveer. "I
just don't know that I can
express how important this was
for our team in how our posts
stepped up. For us to go inside
was the key for our team, and I
think they had trouble stopping
Heather as evidenced by the
number of free throws she had
tonight."
Stanford forced the issue
early in the contest, pounding
the ball inside to Owen and
Scott. The Card was able to cap
italize with some early baskets
while putting sophomore for
ward Amber Hall, the Pac-10's
second-leading rebounder, in
foul trouble before the game was
5 minutes old.
Nevertheless, Washington
came out as if it had been locked
in a room for three days and was
very willing to take out its frus
trations on the Cardinal. Dis

playing good ball movement, espe
cially in the post, the Huskies put
Stanford in a 22-13 hole exactly 10
minutes into the first half, much to
the vocal delight of the Husky fans.
But Stanford never panicked.
"I don't think any of us were
thinking of it as being a bad situa
tion," Starbird said. "We knew that
we eventually would get into the
flow of the game and come back. I
think that just shows that we have
a lot of experience and that a nine
point lead is nothing."
Along with Stanford's compo
sure was the inexplicable need for
Washington sophomore Jamie
Redd to take the game into her own
hands. The gunning guard appar
ently lost her teammates among
the purple seats of Hec Edmund
son as she threw up one erratic
shot after another, aiding the
Husky's 5-of-19 shooting over the
final 9:51 of the first half.
Meanwhile, Stanford went on a
monumental 27-9 run to close the
half and take a 40-31 lead with sec
onds to go. The dynamic duo down
low of Scott and Owen was poetry
in motion, using great post moves
to get good shots. Also, Starbird
came alive with some terrific open
court play, including a coast-to
coast drive through traffic for a
layup that staked Stanford to a 34-
27 lead with a little more than 2
minutes to go. The trio combined
for all the points in the run that
was only temporarily halted by a
three-point shot from senior guard

Laure Savasta at the buzzer.
"When [junior center Gena]
Pelz and Hall were in foul trouble
right out of the gate, it certainly
hurt us," said Washington head
coach June Daugherty. "Stanford
took advantage of that. Their front
line came ready to play, and they
destroyed us."
The Huskies completely went
south in the second half as they
lost all semblance of an offensive
set. The first few possessions for
Washington consisted of a few
dribbles and a desperation outside
shot as its shooting percentage,
already a meager 36 percent, was
going down faster than the wind
chill in Seattle.
The Cardinal continued to build
the lead with its "big three," open
ing up a 17-point lead with 13:05
left. Wideman stretched Stanford's
lead to 19 points just 4 minutes
later by scoring on driving layups
in successive possessions, first fak
ing her defender into press row on
the left side and then driving
around a statue-like Savasta.
The Grane, France, native
teamed up with her blank-shooting
backcourt to miss 23-of-35 shots as
she finished with a team-leading 17
points. Sophomore center Chandra
Benton was able to get into the act
for the Card, nailing a short hook
from the right baseline late in the
game to stretch it to a 78-54 lead.
"I really thought this was an
excellent challenge for our team,"
VanDerveer said. "I think we
learned a lot about our team with
the effort we got from different
people. I just feel so strongly that
this showed so much about our
team in a positive way."
