## The
						Cardinal regroups for a Husky win 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
SEATTLE — Down three
starters, the third-ranked Stan
ford women's basketball team
(19-1, 7-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
entered last night's game in a
vulnerable position against con
ference rivaJ Washington (8-7,3-
3 Pac-10). In the end, it was
Washington who was looking
extremely vulnerable as the Car
dinal administered the Huskies'
worst home loss in 16 years,
routing Washington 90-64
before 5,832 sweetly silent
Husky fans in Hec Edmundson
Pavilion.
This year, it was Stanford's
starting front line that followed
in the footsteps of Kristin Folkl
and senior point guard Jamila
Wideman with a legendary per
formance in Edmundson. Junior
forward Heather Owen had a
career-high 24 points and 10
rebounds, junior center Olympia
Scott had 18 points and nine
boards and senior forward Kate
Starbird had a game-leading 30
points (placing her seventh on
the Pac-10's all-time scoring list
with 1,892 points). Wideman

provided a big boost off the
bench as well, looking very spry
on her feet on her way to an 8-
point, no-turnover performance.
"The type of game that
Heather had tonight is so impor
tant to our team," said Stanford
head coach Tar a VanDerveer. "I
just don't know that I can
express how important this was
for our team in how our posts
stepped up. For us to go inside
was the key for our team, and I
think they had trouble stopping
Heather as evidenced by the
number of free throws she had
tonight."
Stanford forced the issue
early in the contest, pounding
the ball inside to Owen and
Scott. The Card was able to cap
italize with some early baskets
while putting sophomore for
ward Amber Hall, the Pac-10's
second-leading rebounder, in
foul trouble before the game was
5 minutes old.
Nevertheless, Washington
came out as if it had been locked
in a room for three days and was
very willing to take out its frus
trations on the Cardinal. Dis

With the injury to junior forward Naomi Mulitauaopele (back
ground), freshman guard Christina Batastini and company
had to tighten things up against the Huskies.
