Nothing like a little home
cookin' to perk you up.
Just ask No. 17 Stanford,
which returned to the friendly
confines of Maples Pavilion last
night — still smarting from a
loss at Oregon State last week
end — and promptly hammered
out a 78-67 victory over visiting
Washington before a crowd of
6,632.
The Huskies (10-4 overall, 3-3
Pacific 10 Conference) played
Stanford to a 29-29 deadlock in
the first half, but a 20-5 spurt to
open the second period proved
the difference for the Cardinal
(12-3, 5-2 Pac-10), which
improved to 5-0 at home.
"We didn't get into much of a
rhythm in the first half and as a
result, we ended up in a tie," said
Stanford coach Mike Mont
gomery. "Second half, I thought
we upped our defensive intensity
a little bit. We got after it a little
bit, forced some turnovers, got a
little bit more aggressivem, and
got out and got some buckets off
the run."
"The difference in the second
half was the defensive pressure
— defensive pressure and
rebounding," said senior point
guard Brevin Knight. "That led
to fast breaks [and] easy baskets.
When we get easy baskets in
transition, that just makes
everyone feel good about them
selves, which translates into
points."
Knight was his usual Ail-
American self, sinking 10-of-17
shots from the floor for a game
high 26 points.
He also dished out eight
assists to improve on his nation
best 7.7 average.
"He sets the tone," said Wash
ington head coach Bob Bender.

"That's what great point guards
do, and he's a great point guard.
"What we wanted to do is
make him have to hit tough
shots. He started to hit shots,
and then when he steps back and
starts shooting the three, we had
no answer at that point."
In reality, Knight attempted
only two shots from three-point
range, instead preferring to drive
the lane and loft shots over
Husky big men Todd MacCulloch
(7-foot) and Patrick Femerling
(7-foot-l).
As a team, the Cardinal shot
just 10 times from the beyond
the arc, well short of the team's
20.9 average.
One reason was that Stanford
didn't have to play catch-up in
the second half, as it did against
Oregon State last Saturday.
In that game, the Cardinal
was pressed into a whopping 34
three-point attempts.
Last night, Stanford got a bet
ter mix of inside play from
sophomore center Tim Young,
who turned in 20 points and
seven rebounds, and high-per
centage outside shots.
"Threes aren't bad, but when
you start to shoot threes exclu
sively, that's when they start to
hurt you," Knight said. "Tonight
we wanted to get to the basket as
much as possible."
Stanford also did a sound
defensive job on Washington star
forward Mark Sanford, who
managed just 5-of-17 shooting.
Most of the Husky offense was
generated instead by guard
Jamie Booker, who finished with
team highs of 20 points and eight
rebounds.
Despite shooting just 39 per
cent from the floor (29 percent in
the first half, when it made just
eight baskets), Washington

nonetheless played Stanford basically
even outside of two second-half runs (20-
5 and 15-4).
"I've got to give Stanford a tremen
dous amount of credit for the way they
played down the stretch," Bender said.
"The two runs that they made in the sec
ond half really were definitive.
"Stanford is as tough a team as you
can play — physically tough, mentally
very good about having great concentra
tion. They did what they needed to do in
the second half to beat us."
Montgomery's biggest concern head
ing into tomorrow's 5:30 p.m. game
against Washington State (10-7, 2-4 Pac
-10, following last night's double-overtime
loss at California) is that Stanford is con
tinuing to rely too much on the play of
Knight.
"We're concerned that he's having to

do too much," he said. "We're trying to
challenge the other guys to get a little
more involved and make some plays for
us, rather than letting Brevin make all
the plays.
"We're happy to get back in the win
column, yet we realize that we have to
play better," Montgomery said. "As long
as we continue to approach it that way,
we're fine."
