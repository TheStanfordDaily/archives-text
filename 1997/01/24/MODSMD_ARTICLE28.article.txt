# Madsen's defense gives Stanford a second-half surge
## 
### Brian Auld Staff writer 
Once again senior guard
Brevin Knight fueled the Cardi
nal charge, but last night it was
freshman forward Mark Madsen
who ignited the Cardinal to a 78-
67 win.
After a sluggish first half,
Stanford and Washington were
knotted at 29, despite Washing
ton only converting 8-of-28 field
goals for a miserable 28.6 shoot
ing percentage.
"Washington has to feel pretty
good about being tied at the half,"

Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery
said. "We just never got in much
of a rhythm in the first half."
Montgomery elected to start
Madsen, a 6-foot-8 power for
ward, in the second half, and the
freshman's tough defense on
Husky star Mark Sanford
sparked the Cardinal to a 20-5
run to start the period.
"I thought Madsen gave us a
nice lift," Montgomery said. "He
gave us some energy. We just
weren't getting much in terms of
anybody stepping up and making
any plays.
"We certainly focused on San

ford. We knew that he could hurt
us, and Madsen came in and did a
pretty good job, just because he
played hard. Madsen by all rights
should not be able to defend San
ford."
That is because Sanford is a 6-
foot-9 leaper with a quick first
step and outside range on his
jumper. Heading into yesterday's
game he was averaging 16.7
points per game on 42-percent
shooting. Sanford finished the
game with 15 points, but he shot
5-of-17 from the field and only
managed two field goals in the
second half — one on a wide open

layup after the Cardinal coughed
the ball up in its own backcourt
and the other on a driving score
after the game was out of reach.
"Sanford's very active," Mont
gomery said. "Mark just went in
and just worked; he just put some
energy into it and put some effort
into it, and it really paid off."
Madsen's inspired play pushed
the Cardinal to a nearly flawless
opening 6 minutes of the second
period. During that 20-5 spurt,
sophomore guard Kris Weems
nailed three treys, a refreshing
sight to Cardinal fans worried
that the Stanford sharpshooter
had lost his touch.
After starting the season by
hitting 32 three-pointers in his

first 55 attempts for a blistering
58-percent clip, Weems appeared
to have lost his touch as of late,
only making eight of his last 33
for 24 percent. But in the opening
minutes of the second half,
Weems' clutch stroke was back,
as he bottomed out three big bas
kets to carry the Cardinal to its
first double-digit lead of the

night.
But while Weems' shooting
certainly paced Stanford in the
offensive end of the court, both
Montgomery and Knight insisted
that an increase in defensive
intensity was what carried the
Cardinal in the opening minutes
of, and throughout, the second
half.

"The difference in the second
half was defensive pressure and
rebounding," Knight said. "Those
lead to fast breaks, and they
helped us get in a rhythm. We
know we're a good team when
we're playing defense. Our defen
sive intensity has to be there and
then our offense falls into place."
"I said at halftime that we just
have to play better, and that's
what we did," Montgomery said.
"We had guys that weren't play
ing as hard as they needed to, and
in the second half we really upped
our defensive pressure. Again,
Madsen gave us a lift there."
With the defensive pressure up
and a 15-point lead in hand, the
Cardinal turned to its star senior
point guard, Knight, who made
sure that his team never lost the
lead.
With 10 minutes, 36 seconds
remaining in the game, Washing
ton's Jan Wooten made a nice
move to the basket over Knight,
cutting the Cardinal lead to 10.
"Your feelings get hurt when
someone crosses you up like that
on your own court," Knight said
of Wooten's drive. "You never
want to get embarrassed on your
home court, and I was embar
rassed out there. I knew I definite
ly had to get him back for that
one."
Knight got his payback and
more. Over the next 4 minutes he
made two beautiful driving
layups, drilled a three and buried
a short jumper, stretching the
Stanford lead to 19 and burying
all hopes of a Husky comeback.
"They made two runs in the
second half that were very
definitive," said Washington
coach Bob Bender. "When the
momentum swings like that in
front of a big crowd, you know
you're in trouble."
