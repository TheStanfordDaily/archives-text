# Madsen's defense gives Stanford a second-half surge

Once again senior guard
Brevin Knight fueled the Cardi
nal charge, but last night it was
freshman forward Mark Madsen
who ignited the Cardinal to a 78-
67 win.
After a sluggish first half,
Stanford and Washington were
knotted at 29, despite Washing
ton only converting 8-of-28 field
goals for a miserable 28.6 shoot
ing percentage.
"Washington has to feel pretty
good about being tied at the half,"

Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery
said. "We just never got in much
of a rhythm in the first half."
Montgomery elected to start
Madsen, a 6-foot-8 power for
ward, in the second half, and the
freshman's tough defense on
Husky star Mark Sanford
sparked the Cardinal to a 20-5
run to start the period.
"I thought Madsen gave us a
nice lift," Montgomery said. "He
gave us some energy. We just
weren't getting much in terms of
anybody stepping up and making
any plays.
"We certainly focused on San

ford. We knew that he could hurt
us, and Madsen came in and did a
pretty good job, just because he
played hard. Madsen by all rights
should not be able to defend San
ford."
That is because Sanford is a 6-
foot-9 leaper with a quick first
step and outside range on his
jumper. Heading into yesterday's
game he was averaging 16.7
points per game on 42-percent
shooting. Sanford finished the
game with 15 points, but he shot
5-of-17 from the field and only
managed two field goals in the
second half â€” one on a wide open

layup after the Cardinal coughed
the ball up in its own backcourt
and the other on a driving score
after the game was out of reach.
"Sanford's very active," Mont
gomery said. "Mark just went in
and just worked; he just put some
energy into it and put some effort
into it, and it really paid off."
Madsen's inspired play pushed
the Cardinal to a nearly flawless
opening 6 minutes of the second
period. During that 20-5 spurt,
sophomore guard Kris Weems
nailed three treys, a refreshing
