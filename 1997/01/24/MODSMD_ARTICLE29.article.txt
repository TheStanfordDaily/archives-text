# Volleyball enters Midwest tournament
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
Tonight and tomorrow night,
on the campus of Ohio State, on
the Buckeyes home court, volley
ball fans in the Midwest will get
the chance to view the Stanford
men's volleyball team in its first
two NCAA matches of the year.
The NCAA Preview Tourna
ment — which features Indiana
Purdue-Fort Wayne and Ohio
State from the Midwest, and
Stanford and the USC from the
West — should be a real show
case of volleyball talent.
Although it is called a tourna
ment, the preview is a tourna
ment in name only, as there will
be no winner and loser. Rather,
it is more like a conference chal

lenge; Stanford and USC will
play the two schools from the
Midwest during the next two
evenings in what is essentially a
duel between the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation and
the Midwestern Conference. It
will also allow the people of
Columbus, Ohio, who will host
the Final Four in May, to see
what the logistics of a four-team
tournament entail.
Tonight, the Cardinal will
play Indiana Purdue-Fort
Wayne, and tomorrow the team
will face off against the Buck
eyes. Both Ohio State and the
Mastodons are among the top
collegiate volleyball teams in the
Midwest and should provide the
Cardinal with a challenge.
Indiana Purdue-Fort Wayne,

Stanford's first opponent, is a
team that the Cardinal has
already played this year, two
weeks ago in a warm-up tourna
ment at UC-Santa Barbara. The
Cardinal, playing most of its sec
ond team, lost the match 13-15,
15-13, 15-13. Needless to say,
the starters are looking to
avenge the early loss; however,
the Mastodons will not go down
easily.
Unlike many of the opponents
Stanford will face this year, Indi
ana Purdue-Fort Wayne will be
as big as the Cardinal, as it will
start three players above 6-foot -
6. While the size and physical
ability of the Mastodons is not a
question, the team's inexperi
ence — it starts three freshmen
— is.

"The major question for IP-
Fort Wayne is if their freshmen
are consistent enough and men
tally tough enough to play
against us," said Stanford head
coach Ruben Nieves. "They will
be spectacular at times, but they
will also make lots of mistakes. I
do not know how they will react
to playing against Mike Lambert
and the top team in the country,
but if they forget about that and
just show up to play, it could be
a heck of a match."
When Stanford plays the
Buckeyes tomorrow, it will face a
team with a radically different
look than the Mastodons. Rather
than facing a big, physical team,
the Cardinal will be plaving a
