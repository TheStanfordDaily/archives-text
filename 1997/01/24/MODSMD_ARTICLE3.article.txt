# Groups wary of ASSU audits
## Plan designed to ensure accountability for special fees 
### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
A few short days after propos
ing new scrutiny of ASSU-funded
student organizations, ASSU
President Bill Shen is still trying
to pin down the specifics of his
new program.
In his State of the Association
address Tuesday night, Shen pro
claimed his plans to begin auditing
organizations that receive money
through special fees and the
ASSU's Program, Community
Service and Publication boards
The proposal, according to
Shen, is all about accountability.
He said he wants to be sure that if
the senate or student voters ap
prove money for a certain expendi
ture, the funds are indeed used for

their intended purposes.
Stanford students, he said, de
serve to get what they pay for.
While his intentions are clear,
the manner in which his plan will
be carried out is not.
Some parts of the plan are al
ready certain: Beginning in Feb
ruary, the ASSU will perform, in
the words of ASSU Financial
Manager John Hall, "program
matic audits" on recipients of stu
dent funds. The records of these
randomly selected groups will be
examined to ensure that allocated
funds were used for the purposes
for which they were originally
granted.
Initially, interns in Shen's of
fice will handle the audits. But
after this quarter, Shen said, he
would like to see that change. He

hopes to turn the auditing proce
dure over to the senate's Appro
priations Committee. Whether or
not that will happen depends a lot
on the senate.
Hall, who discussed the audit
ing plan with Shen before it was
announced, said Shen "has to get
senate approval if he wants this
program to work." Hall added that
he expects his office to be involved
in the initial stages of the audit
ing.
"The details of the program will
take some time for [Shen] to work
out," he said.
Shen said he hopes no audits
reveal organizations spending
ASSU money in conflict with their
original requests. In such a case,
though, he said he would take the
matter up first with the group in
question.
"We won't actually be directly
questioning student group trea
surers unless there are some dis
crepancies between the projected
budget and their actual expendi
tures," he said.
Hall said that in such a case, the
senate could move to instruct his
office to freeze that organization's
account.
News of the plan drew varying
reactions from student groups re
ceiving special-fee funding.
Junior Jonathan Levitt, head
of the Stanford Film Society,
voiced concern that the audits
would be unrealistic regarding
budget details. "I think it's a good
idea, but in practice it's next to im
possible for a group to plan what
it's going to be doing over a year in
advance," he said.
Levitt added that he hopes spe

cial-fee groups will be able to work
with the ASSU under the same
understanding as in previous
years â€” one that allows organiza
tions to submit basic outline bud
gets that can be modified as the
year progresses.
Senior Lindy Eichenbaum,
chair of Stanford In Government,
had a mixed reaction.
"As far as SIG is concerned, I
welcome [Shen's] audit," she said.
"All he has to do is read The Daily
last quarter to see that the pro
grams we offer exceed what we
had planned."
From the standpoint of the
whole University, though, Eichen
baum was less than enthusiastic.
"It seems kind of ludicrous,
adding another level of bureaucra
cy to the student government,"
she said. "I think it's a waste of re
sources and a distraction away
from student issues."
Hall offered perhaps the most
unique perspective on the propos
al, which he favors. "This will be a
good learning experience for both
the ASSU and student groups," he
said.
