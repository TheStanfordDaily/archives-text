# Groups wary of ASSU audits
## Plan designed to ensure accountability for special fees 
### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
A few short days after propos
ing new scrutiny of ASSU-funded
student organizations, ASSU
President Bill Shen is still trying
to pin down the specifics of his
new program.
In his State of the Association
address Tuesday night, Shen pro
claimed his plans to begin auditing
organizations that receive money
through special fees and the
ASSU's Program, Community
Service and Publication boards
The proposal, according to
Shen, is all about accountability.
He said he wants to be sure that if
the senate or student voters ap

Manager John Hall, "program

randomly selected groups will be
examined to ensure that allocated
funds were used for the purposes
for which they were originally
granted.
Initially, interns in Shen's of
fice will handle the audits. But
after this quarter, Shen said, he
would like to see that change. He

hopes to turn the auditing proce

priations Committee. Whether or
not that will happen depends a lot
on the senate.
Hall, who discussed the audit
ing plan with Shen before it was
announced, said Shen "has to get
senate approval if he wants this
program to work." Hall added that
he expects his office to be involved
in the initial stages of the audit
ing.
"The details of the program will
take some time for [Shen] to work
out," he said.
Shen said he hopes no audits
reveal organizations spending
ASSU money in conflict with their
original requests. In such a case,
