# Competition for swimming's sprints heats up in the desert
## 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
Continuing along its road to the
NCAA Championships, the Stanford
men's swim team travels to Arizona this
weekend for meets against Arizona State
today and Arizona tomorrow.
The Arizona schools have given the
Cardinal little trouble in recent years,
although both the Wildcats and the Sun
Devils are perennial top 20-finishers at
the NCAA Championships. Arizona
State was ninth and Arizona finished
14th at last year's championships.
The Collegiate Swimming Coaches
Association of America has picked ASU
to hold its ninth spot this year, while the
Wildcats are predicted to move up one
and finish 13tn.
But as a team, neither Arizona school
has much of a chance at putting up the
type of point totals to compete with
Stanford. The Cardinal's deep pool of
talent will overwhelm both opponents
point-wise.
However, there might be some indi
vidual challenges coming to Stanford s

sprint-freestyle corps when it swims
against Arizona State today.
ASU sophomore Francisco Sanchez
was the NCAA champion in the 50-yard
freestyle last year and also finaled in the
100-yard free. Sanchez is joined in the 50
by senior and Ecuadorian Olympian
Felipe Delgado, and the two are the
fastest returning sprinters in the NCAA
this year.
Arizona State freshman Kevin Butler
was the fourth-fastest high school senior
in the 200-yard freestyle last year and
should add to the Sun Devils' strength in
the shorter freestyle events, as well as
the relays.
This weekend is the second in a row
that the Stanford team has been on the
road, as the Cardinal swimmers were in
Austin and Dallas last weekend, beating
Texas in the Longhorns' home pool and
placing second in the Southern
Methodist-hosted Dallas Morning News
Invitational.
The Cardinal will have a two-week
break after this weekend before hosting
USC and UC-Santa Barbara on Feb. 7
and 8 at deGuerre Pool.
