# Washington is first road contest for women tumblers
## 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The Cardinal women's gymnas
tics team is ready to impress the
Washington crowd with consistent
excellence tonight.
The squad, more confident now
after two meets which showed off
its spectacular talent and skill, is
fired up for the first away meet of
the season.
However, in order to achieve
absolute team consistency, the
coaching staff has taken out sever
al high-level moves from the com
plex routines that have awed the
crowd in previous meets.
Although the Cardinal squad
has put on amazing performances
so far against its competitors, it has
fallen short of the nation's best
teams due to some shaky landings
or, in last week's case, four falls on
the beam. It is aiming to use this
road meet as a way to gain confi
dence and prove that it can be con
sistent anytime, anywhere.
"I think we are well prepared for
this meet," junior co-captain Keri
Monahan said. "We're going to
water-down some routines. We
really want one confident meet
under our belt."
According to Stanford coach
Lisa Izzi, the Washington team,
ranking somewhere near the top
15, appears to be in excellent shape
this year and cannot be taken light
ly-
"They seem to have a lot of diffi
cult skills and some very talented
kids," Izzi said. "It's looking like
another tough Pacific 10 Confer
ence competition." The Pac-10 is
acknowledged as one of the most
competitive conference in colle
giate gymnastics.
"This is our first time out on a
road trip; the girls have been work
ing really hard, and we're hoping to
do a similar or better performance"
than last week," Izzi said.

Although the Cardinal gym
nasts will not have the support of a
packed home audience this week
end, freshman Larissa Fontaine
said she is looking forward to the
meet against Washington.
"We've been talking a lot about
coming together as a team,"
Fontaine said. "We want to be con
fident this weekend. We have plen
ty of time to add the difficulty back
in; right now we want to focus on
consistency and building confi
dence."
Izzi said this week the squad
worked on hitting moves on the
beam under pressure situations
and keeping up with endurance so
everyone on the team sticks tum
bling landings.
"We have been fine-tuning and
practicing perfecting lines," Izzi
said. "It's an ongoing process
throughout the season, but we try
to get better each week."
Some minor changes will take
place in the lineup for the Wash
ington meet to ensure further con
sistency.
Freshman Tara LaMorte will
now compete in three events — the
floor, beam and uneven bars. In
addition, junior Amy Neil will take
sophomore Katie Fitzpatrick's
place on the bars.
The new gymnasts in the lineup
have "a little bit more consistency,
and that's what we need," Izzi said.
"They have good practices behind
them [this week], and that's impor
tant for their own confidence and
the team's confidence."
The all-around gymnasts com
peting in all four events will be co
captains Monahan and sophomore
Amy Murakami, as well as
Fontaine and sophomore Tracey
Kohl.
Monahan has repeatedly wowed
the crowd with her dynamic rou
tines, placing first in the meet
against UCLA with an astonishing
overall score of 39.475.
