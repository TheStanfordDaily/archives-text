# Baseball opens season as nation's No. 1 team
## 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
Before tomorrow's season opener, base
ball maintenance crews will comb the
infield, trim the grass and put the Finishing
touches on Sunken Diamond. If only the
Cardinal could say the same about its team.
Despite its No. 1 NCAA ranking in a pre
season poll by Baseball America, the final
touches of what could be the nation's best
Division I baseball team are months away —
making assured success a pipe dream and
gray hairs a reality for head coach Mark
Marquess and the rest of the coaching staff.
In the past, high preseason rankings for
the Cardinal haven't translated into a
national championship. Two seasons ago,
the Card took its No. 1 preseason ranking
and ended up No. 5. Last season it began at
No. 2 but was ousted from the NCAA Mid
west regional playoffs after two losses.
This year, the Cardinal will try to make
the preseason ranking indicative of the post
season one. But so far, the team is rife with
uncertainties.
One sure thing, however, is this squad's
starting pitching.
"I think the strength of the team this
year is our starting pitching," Marquess
said. "The three returning starters, Kyle
Peterson, Chad Hutchinson and Jeff Austin,
are the strongest part of this team."
As starters last year, Peterson, Hutchin
son and Austin were a combined 23-11.
Peterson is 24-5 for his career on the Farm,
which earns him the ninth slot on Stan
ford's all-time win list.
But other than the starting pitching, this
year's success is anybody's guess.
"It's hard to say about this year's team,"
Marquess said. "There are a few question
marks."
A big one is relief pitching.
After losing almost all of last year's
squad, Marquess will try to craft a relief
crew out of one experienced returning play
er and three relatively untried pitchers.
Sophomore Tony Cogan, who was 1-0 with a

4.76 ERA in 17 relief appearances last year,
is the front runner for the closer job. The
rest of the crew will be made of relatively
inexperienced junior left-hander Josh Koons
(0-0, 0.69 ERA in 1996), junior right-hander
Adam Harris (0-0, 27.00 ERA), sophomore
left-hander Brent Hoard (0-0, 11.57 ERA)
and freshman right-hander Geoff Linville.
"It's hard to say how our bullpen will do.
We need to have a good one to do well," Mar
quess said.
The other big question mark is the
offense. The team lost formidable run pro
ducers when catcher A.J. Hinch, first base
man Troy Kent and second baseman Brain
Dallimore graduated. But the Cardinal will
attempt to counter with two position play-

team.'

ers: sophomore Jody Geurut in right field,
who earned freshman All-American honors
last season by blasting onto the scene with a
.321 average, and junior catcher Jon Schaef
fer, who hit .292 with 11 home runs and 44
RBIs for Stanford in 1996.
Only one thing's for sure: All definites
will be have to be put on hold until further
notice.
"It's hard to say for sure how we'll do. It
depends on the bullpen, position players and
returning players. We have a good squad,"
Marquess said.
Tomorrow's I p.m. game at Sunken Dia
mond will give the Cardinal its first test, as
the team faces perennial opponent St.
Mary's.
