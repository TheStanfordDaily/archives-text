The top-ranked Stanford women's
swimming and diving team plans to
kick off full-force in its first away
meet of the year. The Cardinal (3-0)
will compete against the Arizona
Wildcats (4-2) today and then face the
Arizona State Sun Devils (6-3) tomor
row.
The fifth-ranked Wildcats may offer
a competitive edge for the Cardinal
women, but with Stanford's strong
supporting cast of Olympic freshmen
and veteran swimmers, chances for a
team victory look grim for the 21st
ranked Sun Devils.
The Cardinal, following its fifth
straight national championship, has
suffered only one loss, to USC last
year, in its last 60 dual meets.
"If Stanford swims as well as

they've always been doing, we should
not be able to win," Arizona State head
coach Tim Hill said.
Hill admitted that the Cardinal
team dominates any of his top Sun
Devil swimmers, but plans to line up
Carolyn Adel (400-yard individual
medley), Kristanne Risser (200-yard
breastroke) and Casey Murphy (500-
yard freestyle) to stay competitive and
score higher overall points.
The Arizona and Arizona State dual
meets will provide a challenge and
opportunity for the Cardinal team to
make qualifying marks for the NCAAs.
The team has racked 10 qualifiers in
eight individual events from its last
three dual meets.
Freshman Gabrielle Rose, an
Olympian from Brazil who earned a
personal best for the season at her last
meet, would need to shave more than a

second to qualify for the 200-yard
freestyle. Sophomore Elin Austevoll
would need to drop one-half of a sec
ond for the 200-yard breaststroke and
seven-tenths of a second for the 100-
yard breaststroke to make the NCAA
qualifying time.
Cardinal swimmers expected to help
lead the team to a strong performance
include senior Kerry O'Hanlon, who
swept both backstroke events at the
last meet against Michigan, junior
Amy Oberhelman, who placed third in
the 1,650-yard freestyle at last year's
NCAAs, and freshman Catherine Fox,
a two-time Olympic gold medalist who
already holds three NCAA qualifying
times.
Freshmen Jessica Tucker-Mohl and
Courtney Lischke and senior Claudia
Franco will add strength to the mid
dle-distance freestyle events.
