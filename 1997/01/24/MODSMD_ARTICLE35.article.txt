# I Slosh Around 'Round 'Round We Slosh Around or Some Ambivalent Feelings Toward the Present Quarter
## 
### 
Sloshing, a sloshing good time. That is
what winter quarter is now to be known as:
"The Sloshy Good Timin' Quarter." Hahaha
ha . . . ha . . . ohhhhh, man — no jokes right
now, please, because oh I'm down. Down,
down in the whiskey dump with my friends,
Tito and Forgotten Sunday. God doesn't
seem to have an ending, my Stanford peers
and colleagues, for the present sucking mud
sliding movie. Sheets of rain are as regular
and continual as Woody Allen's cinematic
pairing with beautiful women who would
otherwise have nothing to do with his neu
rotic person. Oh, you like Woody Allen, or
are not familiar enough with him to under
stand the joke? Sorry, but there's no going
back now because it's a sloppy day and I
pledge to be a sloppy writer, my miserable
lost lambs.
Now, what was that depressing offal?
The fellow who wrote that last paragraph
needs a little change of perspective to shake
his soul from the funk ravine. Wait . . . did I
just unconsciously compose a possible Par
liament song title?* Ho ha, you see, things
aren't so bad! Sure, the Earth outside has
turned against your bike tires, and, if you
have glasses, you feel a little more vulnera
ble because of the droplets impairing your
vision. But, hey, if man never invented
glasses, you would be a blind animal and
truly vulnerable — torn apart by an illiter
ate pack of wolves. It's not the administra
tion's fault that the Viewbook, which you
based your college decision upon, made no
reference to the line of water spread across
the middle of your rear end. Did you expect

a picture of a selectively all-right, healthy
student with the bold, black caption, "I had
a vertical water stain that embarrassingly
defined my mid-buttock for the entirety of
winter quarter! It comes from the back bike
tire, as any frosh is soon to find out soon
after blah blah dynamic professor blah
. . (Dave Lanthilatum, senior, political
science)? These are trilling matters because
look at yourself: You made it to Stanford,
and here you are, and you will almost
assuredly always be better off than a home
less man eating rotten fruit.
But you see, well, I'm lying again in this
last paragraph. It is a very complicated sort
of lying, advanced now to "lying to myself'
as well as "projecting dishonest ego to my
half-awake, miserable audience." "The
homeless man" will still always get the
worst of it — unless the homeless man lives
in sunny Miami, and he owns a bigger house.
Just observe the faces around us as we
tramp to class, work, lab — or the test tube
like numb Napoleonic soldiers with down
turned heads and ridiculous, obsolete
weaponry carried listlessly at their sides.
Our boots to the concrete make scuffling
noises, for we drag our feet like a chain gang
imprisoned by daily obligation, clomp-clomp.
Whoever is commissioner of names of the
University should rename White Plaza
"Walking Zombie Plaza." While you are at
it, commissioner of names, rename Tresid
der Express . . . Zombie Express. Like the
deciduous trees in this sunless land, we are
dormant and half-alive.
Wait, is everything that bad? Things

never get that hopeless. Right, Spiro Agnew?
(Spooky Voice From Grave) Thatsss Rii
ight, Errric.
Granted, when you go to sleep it is rain
ing, and when you wake up it is raining, but
that only makes one more appreciative of
the five-minute sun windows that regularly
occur between rains. Hey, what's that on the
horizon? That's right, it's a rainbow! Also,
with the bad weather comes more opportu
nities to spend some time with housemates,
dormmates and other loved ones. Did you
know that more babies are conceived in this
quarter than any other? The more babies,
the better — we need that labor for Ameri
ca's farms. Now is also a great opportunity
to catch up with long-lost acquaintances
through e-mail. "The weather here is soggy
and rainy — what is it like where you live or
work?" Perhaps it is even time to "get back
into video games "
All that heavy Napoleon stuff and boot
scuffling stuff earlier — that was only
designed by my column's team of wriiers to
encourage you to keep reading. And you did,
dear reader, for the end is finally here . . .
farewell, and try to have a good quarter.
Since we are at Stanford, this can all
painlessly end with an oft-repeated quote by
Linus Pauling: "Winter quarter is the gray,
forgotten lunch meat in the middle of two
pretty decent, worthwhile quarters, BUT it
will nevertheless be devoured for lack of
alternative sustenance.'"
