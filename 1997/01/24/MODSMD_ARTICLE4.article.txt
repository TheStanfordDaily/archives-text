The solution to problems in Cyprus lies within the
European Union, Ananstassios Simonidis told a crowd
last night.
"The people of Cyprus today are living under a cloud
of uncertainty," said Simonidis, the honorary consul
general of the Republic of Cyprus in San Francisco,
during a speech in Campbell Recital Hall.
Cyprus, the third-largest island in the Mediter
ranean, was invaded by Turkey in July 1974. Turkey
occupied 37 percent of Cyprus' territory and expelled,
according to Simonidis, 200,000 Greek Cypriots living
there.
Although Southern Cyprus is occupied by the
Greeks, the refugees are still deprived of the right to re
turn to the Turkish-occupied northern portion of the

island. The Greek half is recognized as an independent
nation by the international community, while the
Turkish half is only recognized as a nation by Turkey.
According to Simonidis, about 1,600 people, includ
ing five Americans, are missing as a result of the Turk
ish invasion.
Simonidis has been active in the Greek-American
community since 1959 and has acted as an adviser to
the Cyprus delegation in the U.N. General Assembly.
In his speech, he argued that, despite the tensions
on the island, Cyprus might still become a bridge of
peace between Greek and Turkey.
Simonidis identified Turkey's Islamic government,
increased militarization and what he referred to as a
poor human rights record as the chief barriers to re
unification.
