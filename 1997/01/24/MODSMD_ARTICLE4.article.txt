# Consul general offers solution to Cyprus' 'cloud of uncertainty'
## 
### David Felman Contributing writer 
The solution to problems in Cyprus lies within the
European Union, Ananstassios Simonidis told a crowd
last night.
"The people of Cyprus today are living under a cloud
of uncertainty," said Simonidis, the honorary consul
general of the Republic of Cyprus in San Francisco,
during a speech in Campbell Recital Hall.
Cyprus, the third-largest island in the Mediter
ranean, was invaded by Turkey in July 1974. Turkey
occupied 37 percent of Cyprus' territory and expelled,
according to Simonidis, 200,000 Greek Cypriots living
there.
Although Southern Cyprus is occupied by the
Greeks, the refugees are still deprived of the right to re
turn to the Turkish-occupied northern portion of the

island. The Greek half is recognized as an independent
nation by the international community, while the
Turkish half is only recognized as a nation by Turkey.
According to Simonidis, about 1,600 people, includ
ing five Americans, are missing as a result of the Turk
ish invasion.
Simonidis has been active in the Greek-American
community since 1959 and has acted as an adviser to
the Cyprus delegation in the U.N. General Assembly.
In his speech, he argued that, despite the tensions
on the island, Cyprus might still become a bridge of
peace between Greek and Turkey.
Simonidis identified Turkey's Islamic government,
increased militarization and what he referred to as a
poor human rights record as the chief barriers to re
unification.
"If Cyprus were to become a
member of the European Union the
benefits to its citizens will be many.
Cypriots will be able to move freely
within Europe, to set up business
on an equal basis with all other Eu
ropeans," Simonidis said.
European Union membership
could force Turkey to release its
grip in the occupied part, Simonidis
said.
However, Simonidis also said
that this will be a complex and slow

moving process. Although Cyprus
today meets all criteria for admis
sion to the European Union, the
Turkish inhabited portion does not,
he said.
While inflation and unemploy
ment levels in the Greek portion of
Cyprus are below 3 percent, in the
Turkish area, these figures are high
— 90 percent and 30 percent re
spectively, Simonidis said.
"There is so much inequality in
Turkey that the masses feel desti
tute. Unless the United States en
courages Turkey to improve the
plight of the masses, the northern
part of Cyprus will follow the fate of
Iran — Islamic fundamentalism,"

Simonidis said
Simonidis commented on the
vulnerability of Greek Cyprus to
the Turkish "military machine."
Since the Turkish invasion, the
United Nations has been trying to
decrease the steady build up of its
military capabilities, he said.
Simonidis stressed that mem
bership to the European Union can
not be possible until Cyprus is de
militarized.
Pan Yotopoulos, an economics
professor at the Food Research In
stitute, expressed doubt as to the
feasibility of this membership.
"The most provocative state
ment [Simonidis] made was that

the solution to the Cyprus problem
would be the acceptance of Turkey
into the European Union,"
Yotopoulos said. "I don't know how
realistic this is as a prospect."
Suzi Abdel-Malak, a board mem
ber of Hellenic Association at Stan
ford which sponsored the event,
said she thought having Simonidis
come and speak was a "big honor."
"I think it is our duty to inform
as many people as possible about
the Cyprus people," she added.
Abdel-Malak, born in Cyprus
three years after the invasion, said
that she will never be allowed to
visit her mother's village as long as
there is Turkish occupation.
