## 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
A former law student who allegedly used a
fellow student's name to carry out thousands
of dollars' worth of credit card fraud turned
himself in to police yesterday after a year-long
investigation.
The suspect, Eugene Edward Jung, 27, is
charged with felony credit card fraud and is
being held on $ 100,000 bail in the Santa Clara
County jail, Stanford Police Det. Allen James
said.
James said the charge stemmed from an in
cident in 1995 in which Jung allegedly as
sumed the name of a fellow student in order to
obtain credit cards.
Jung allegedly charged more than $5,000 to
the stolen cards for a variety of purchases, in

cluding a "mini-vacation" to Yosemite Nation
al Park.
Jung's victim subsequently graduated from
the Law School and is now an assistant attor
ney general in the Midwest, according to a po
lice statement.
According to James, the police suspect that
Jung obtained two cards, but the current
charges relate to only one card. The card was
connected to Jung with the help of a handwrit
ing expert.
James explained that Jung "had been the
focus of an investigation" at the time of the in
cident but that there had not been sufficient
evidence at that time to consider him a "viable
suspect." Shortly afterward, James added,
Jung left the area without graduating from
Law School.
At that point, James said, the investigation

"stalled out" until two months ago, when the
victim of the fraud alerted police that Jung had
reappeared in the area and the police reopened
their investigation.
Jung turned himself in after police told him
through his attorney that a warrant had been
issued for his arrest, James added.
James said the $100,000 bail was perhaps
somewhat "inordinate" but was designed to
hold Jung "just in case he might be a flight
risk.
"We want to bring this investigation to a
close and have fJung] answer to this," said
James.
He added that the police "are still pursuing
an active investigation," with the possibility of
"more charges being filed," and that anyone
with further evidence should contact him at
723-9633.
