### Arthur Hu Contributing writer 
David Anton, a courier for the
campus Mail and Delivery Ser
vices for 34 years, died on Jan. 14.
He apparently suffered a heart at
tack in his sleep at the age of 52.
Wayne Duckworth, the assis
tant director of operations at the
Data Center who had served as
Anton's manager for several
years, said he remembers Anton
as "friendly, haid-working and
keen .. . certainly a great guy to
work with.
"He seemed healthy. There
were no indications of anything
wrong," Duckworth added.
Kathleen Sumner, an adminis
trative assistant for facilities
within the Computer Science De
partment, used to work in the
same department as Anton. "I've
known David for nine years," she
said. "I was very fond of him, as we
were very good friends. He had a

very unique personality.
"He was gentle, soft-spoken,
loyal to Stanford and his unit, and
he was completely dedicated to his
work," Sumner said.
A memorial service is sched
uled for today at 3:30 p.m. in
Memorial Church. The service is
open to all who wish to attend.
According to Sumner, Anton
was "kind of quiet to people who
didn't know him, but he had a
great sense of humor. He quietly
absorbed everything and synthe
sized it. [He was] one of those
unique people on campus who was
here when campus mail first
started" and had seen some of the
evolution of the campus.
"He knew the history behind
the buildings, in addition to a lot
of Stanford trivia," she said.
Anton is survived by his moth
er, Barbara, and his twin brother,
Donald, both of Mountain View,
as well as his sister, Judy Anton
Clark of Maryland.
