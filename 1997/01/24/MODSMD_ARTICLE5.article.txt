# Fac Sen puts obstacle in course guide's path

### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yes
terday hampered ASSU ef
forts to create a comprehen
sive course guide for stu
dents.
In a 14-13 vote, the sen
ate decided not to encourage
the School of Humanities
and Sciences to give quanti
tative data from teaching
evaluation forms to the

ASSU for use in its new course guide.
The vote was on an amendment to the sen
ate's Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement's proposal for guidelines for stu
dent evaluation of teaching.
Under the original legislation, some writ
ten comments included on course evaluations
would be released to the ASSU, but quantita
tive data would be released at the discretion of
the dean.
At the suggestion of ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson, Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy proposed an amendment to the
guidelines that urged the release of " sufficient
quantitative information" to the ASSU.

ASSU Senator Doug Natelson, a represen
tative at large to the Faculty Senate, ex
pressed his concern that leaving the release of
data in the hands of individual deans could
create administrative hurdles in getting com
prehensive information to students.
"As I understood it in October, there was
broad support on the part of the faculty for
giving as much information to the students as
possible," Natelson said. "I don't really under
stand the objection that distributing the in
formation could be damaging."
Chemistry Prof. John Brauman said the
forms serve purposes other than informing
students.
"These forms are doing multiple functions
other than telling students which classes are
entertaining," Brauman said. "We have to
trust deans about which kinds of information
are appropriate for public dissemination."
University President Gerhard Casper said
he worried that information given to the stu
dents would become public information.
Because the course guide is published on
leased to the student body will be ... accessi
ble to every appointments committee at any
