# Fac Sen puts obstacle in course guide's path
## 
### Sarah Cameron Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yes
terday hampered ASSU ef
forts to create a comprehen
sive course guide for stu
dents.
In a 14-13 vote, the sen
ate decided not to encourage
the School of Humanities
and Sciences to give quanti
tative data from teaching
evaluation forms to the

ASSU for use in its new course guide.
The vote was on an amendment to the sen
ate's Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement's proposal for guidelines for stu
dent evaluation of teaching.
Under the original legislation, some writ
ten comments included on course evaluations
would be released to the ASSU, but quantita
tive data would be released at the discretion of
the dean.
At the suggestion of ASSU Vice President
Nick Thompson, Political Science Prof. David
Abernethy proposed an amendment to the
guidelines that urged the release of " sufficient
quantitative information" to the ASSU.

ASSU Senator Doug Natelson, a represen
tative at large to the Faculty Senate, ex
pressed his concern that leaving the release of
data in the hands of individual deans could
create administrative hurdles in getting com
prehensive information to students.
"As I understood it in October, there was
broad support on the part of the faculty for
giving as much information to the students as
possible," Natelson said. "I don't really under
stand the objection that distributing the in
formation could be damaging."
Chemistry Prof. John Brauman said the
forms serve purposes other than informing
students.
"These forms are doing multiple functions
other than telling students which classes are
entertaining," Brauman said. "We have to
trust deans about which kinds of information
are appropriate for public dissemination."
University President Gerhard Casper said
he worried that information given to the stu
dents would become public information.
Because the course guide is published on
leased to the student body will be ... accessi
ble to every appointments committee at any


Casper
university," he said.
Casper was mainly concerned
with the negative consequences this
could have on individual professors.
"That does fill me with some
reservations and shudders," he
added. "This material can be used
for highly defamatory purposes."
However, Faculty Senate mem
bers pointed out that other universi
ties already have similar course
guides.
Student representatives at the
meeting felt that if more data were
released, the ASSU course guide
would better serve the student body.

"It is ironic that the faculty are
worried about the accuracy of the in
formation" gathered from the sur
veys, said ASSU Senator Alane
Murdock, another representative at
large. "The most accurate represen
tation of the information is through
the numbers."
Further discussion on the legisla
tion about student evaluation was
tabled until the next senate meet
ing. The committee withdrew its
proposal for reconsideration in light
of yesterday's discussion.
In other senate business, Casper
reiterated Stanford's commitment
to developing freshman seminars,
after an article in the Chronicle of
Higher Education indicated that the
program lacks faculty support.
Casper, calling the article "terri

bly slanted," repeated the words of
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Ed
ucation Ram6n Saldlvar in calling
the response for departmental pro
posals for freshman seminars "phe
nomenally good."
At least 25 departments have
submitted proposals for a total of 85
to 100 freshman seminars. The ini
tial response is enough "in theory to
cover the entire freshman class,"
Casper said.
He also said the unfavorable re
ports are "being used as arguments
against similar proposals at other
universities."
The senate also heard a report
from Law School Dean Paul Brest.
Brest reported on such issues as
the high cost of legal education, the
growing gap between the legal acad

emy and the profession and the in
terdisciplinary turn of legal scholar
ship.
Reporting that the Law School
does not have a pluralist faculty
stretching across several disciplines,
Brest said, "It is not a Noah's Ark of
legal diversity, but it's a good zoo."
Provost Condoleezza Rice fielded
a question from Biology Depart
ment Chair Pat Jones about the fu
ture of free Internet access.
Emphasizing that she believed
that the use of the Internet and the
Web are "very core to what we are
doing," Rice said the University will
examine the issue.
"The University is committed to
the academic uses of technology and
the Internet," she said. "This is an
issue worth studying."
