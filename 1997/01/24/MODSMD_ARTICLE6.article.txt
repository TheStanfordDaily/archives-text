# Bon Appetit sales down
## Suffering from competition and poor weather, vendors scale back hours, plan expanded menus 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
Despite many renovations, Tresidder
Union's largest vendor has been suffering
from low sales in the past few months.
Bon Appetit, which runs the Corner Pock
et, Coffee House, the Cafe, Baker Street and a
catering service, has suffered about 20 per
cent lower sales compared to this time in pre
vious years, according to Mary Clark, district
manager of Bon Appetit.
To combat the sales slump, Bon Appetit's
vendors are offering new menus and new
deals.
"We're hoping it's just the rain and the
weather," Clark said of the decreased sales.
But the new competition in Tresidder is
also a source of concern for Bon Appetit,
which has been the major vendor in Tresidder
for the past eight years.

Polio Rev opened in early
November, and Jamba Juice
is scheduled to open in
March.
"A lot of it is weather,
[but] some of it is competi
tion, too," Clark said. "What
we're hoping is that all of a
sudden we're going to have a
few great weeks, the sun is
going to shine, and everyone

will be running here for beverages."
In response to the decreased revenues, Bon
Appetit has stopped serving dinner at Tresid
der's Cafe.
According to Clfirk, the lower sales have
not significantly affected the hours employees
work, except for the changes at the Cafe.
"We plan on pretty much going on the


Wais
same hours as now," she said. "In
fact, if there's a demand for dinner,
we'll do it."
Some students did say they were
disappointed with the fact that the
Cafe no longer serves dinner.
"Especially when you have two
evening classes... it's a lot easier to
eat here in the evenings," said mas
ter's student Brad Heers. "Now I'm
stuck here eating pizza."
Sophomore Kate Lowenhar also
said she had liked the Cafe's dinner
hours.
"I thought Stanford was moving
in a positive direction developing
Tresidder Union, getting Polio's...
but I think it's a backward step [to]
close down opportunities for dinner,
[which were] an incentive to spend
time here in the evenings," she said.
"It's turned into a rather sterile
study area."
According to Dean of Students
Marc Wais, the issue of keeping the

Cafe open for dinner has been an on
going one, as it "has never been a
good moneymaker." Wais said
when the Cafe did serve dinner it
was only "to be a good community
neighbor and provide a good ser
vice," rather than to make a profit.
Despite the lower business this
winter, Wais said the opening of
new vendors in Tresidder has creat
ed "healthy competition."
"The bottom line is I think stu
dents, faculty and staff benefit by
having greater choice and variety,
and I think it presents a challenge to
the food vendor to make their
menus more attractive, appealing
and price-competitive," Wais said.
"We're hopeful that with cre
ative innovative management they
can respond to the challenge," he
added.
Numerous renovations have
been made to services in Tresidder
through Bon Appetit, and many
changes are on the way.
"I'm excited about the changes
taking place in Tresidder," said
Wais. "The feedback I've gotten
from students, faculty and staff has

been exceedingly positive — they
enjoy the greater variety, the hours
of operation and the quality of food
and service now provided."
Late in September the Cafe went
through a complete remodel, with
improved lighting for studying. Bon
Appetit has recently developed a
section of the Cafe dedicated to
Asian food, called "The Pacific
Rim." New lighting with dimmers
has been installed in the Coffee
House, in addition to new furniture.
The Coffee House is also imple
menting a new menu next week, in
cluding a new late-night menu and
gourmet pizza cooked to order — a
development that Wais said he
thinks will be "a great hit."
Bon Appetit is also working on a
jukebox upgrade and plans to re
model the infrastructure and en
trance to the Coffee House.
"The Coffee House is so unique
and has a culture and environment
all of its own that the students and
clientele really enjoy," Clark said.
"We're not going to change that...
but we're going to make some
changes that will enhance how

we're able to produce the product."
Clark added that Bon Appetit is
also working on a new gourmet
pizza menu in the Corner Pocket, to
be implemented in mid-February.
"People should come to the
building at night if they want some
thing on campus — there's still
quite a bit to choose," Clark said.
The Corner Pocket, Polio's and the
Coffee House are all open at night,
and Tresidder opens at 7 a.m. every
day.
"It's the best breakfast deal in
town," she said.
Wais said the University is mak
ing an effort to keep Bon Appetit
afloat.
"I think overall that Bon Appetit
does a tremendous job in providing
quality food at reasonable prices,"
he said. "We are concerned about
their financial viability ... and the
last thing we want to do is lose them
as a vendor."
According to Wais, the Tresidder
Advisory Board is still trying to de
cide how to allocate the 2,900
square feet that remain unoccupied
on Tresidder's first floor.
