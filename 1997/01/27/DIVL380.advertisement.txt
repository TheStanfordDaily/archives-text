map customers to study demographics, look for patterns in the way a disease is spreading, help fight forest fires, determine
new national boundaries during peace negotiations, find promising sites for fast-growing companies, support optimal land
use planning, route emergency vehicles, monitor rain forest depletion, and much more.
