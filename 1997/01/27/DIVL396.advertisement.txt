SO, YOU WANT TO BE ONE OF THE
OP* DOLLIES hQ
Well, stop it. Sure, the Dollies are dancing divas, a true troupe of Terpsichores, but think of
all the things you miss out on by being a Dollie: watching "America's Funniest Home Videos",
being lost in an existential void. . .the list is endless. So we took out a half-page ad in the
Daily specifically to tell you not to become a Dollie. Here are some more reasons to not
come to the Informational Meeting TONIGHT in Toyon Lounge at 8:00 pm:
cons
1) The Band health policy
doesn't cover Carpal Tunnel
Syndrome from signing one
gajillion autographs.
2) Being on national
television isn't as fun as
everyone says it is.
3) The Pope won't take "no"
for an answer.

cons
71) Traveling to exotic locales
can leave you blase for the
rest of your life.
4) Gerhard keeps calling and
asking for advice on
University policy.
5) You can only do it once
per lifetime.
By the by, we were just kidding about not becoming a Dollie. So try out. Your kids will thank you tor it.
