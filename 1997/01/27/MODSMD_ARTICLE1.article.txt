# Cochran captivates crowd
## Simpson's lawyer defends profession 
### Jim Tankersley Contributing writer 
If the 500-plus people who filled
Cubberley Auditorium for John
nie Cochran's speech Friday after
noon had all closed their eyes, they
might well have thought them
selves transported to Lance Ito's
star-spangled Los Angeles court
room.
On display was the same
Cochran who captivated TV audi
ences during what many people re
ferred to as "the trial of the centu
-17" — the man sporting a dark
suit, speaking in a smooth, melodi
ous tone and seemingly poised to
suddenly break out in a quick re
frain of "if it doesn't fit, you must
acquit!"
On this afternoon, though,
Cochran was not speaking in de
fense of O.J. Simpson. He was de
fending himself and his vocation.
Cochran's noontime speech,
sponsored by Branner Presents,
focused on the question of, in
Cochran's words, "How can you
defend 'those people'?" During his
talk, Cochran argued the impor
tance of the American legal system
and the integrity of the modern de
fense lawyer.
In the wake of Simpson's ac
quittal, Cochran said, the Ameri
can public has become increasing
ly hostile toward the court system
and defense attorneys. After the
verdict, people were "searching for

anything ... that might explain
what they saw as a travesty of jus
tice."
That outcry led many people to
call for reforms to the justice sys
tem, such as non-unanimous ver
dicts and fewer rights for the ac
cused, he said. But Cochran told the
audience that such proposals violate
the vision of the country's founding
fathers.
"One of the greatest misfortunes
an individual can face is to be arrest
ed and incarcerated for a crime," he
said. "The framers of the Constitu
tion did not intend for the accused to
face this alone."
He asked members of the audi
ence to imagine being held for an of
fense that they did not commit. "If
you are charged with a crime, you
will want every constitutional right
that you have," he said.
The defense attorney, he said, is
one of the most important tools the
Constitution guarantees an accused
person. The advocate — Cochran's
preferred name for his job — is al
ways on the defendant's side,
through good times and bad. He

stressed loyalty and obligation to
one's client, and he questioned
those who attacked him for his role
in the Simpson trial.
In particular, Cochran respond
ed to Simpson prosecutor Christo
pher Darden, who alleged in a recent
book that Cochran "chose 0.J."
over the prosecution. Cochran said
he was miffed by the attack.
"It is a wonder that a lawyer
would fail to understand the role of
a criminal defense attorney," he
said.
Cochran also talked about his
current work, including his fight to
gain a new trial for former Black
Panther Geronimo Pratt. Pratt was
convicted of the Santa Monica ten
nis court murders in 1972 and sen
tenced to life in prison.
Cochran believes that Pratt is in
nocent and was framed by the FBI.
He said he has uncovered a wealth
of new evidence to support that
claim, and his request for a new trial
will be heard in February.
Cochran concluded his remarks
with a call for students to work to
combat injustice. He asked them to
live "with a resolve that you are not
just 'sliding through.' "
After the speech, Cochran signed
copies of his book, "Journey to Jus
tice," at the Bookstore.
