## Pack pulls away from Pats, takes Super Bowl XXXI Green Bay claims 35-21 victory; Howard named MVP 
### 
NEW ORLEANS (AP) - The
Green Bay Packers finally have a
present to go with their past.
The 35-21 Super Bowl victory
over the New England Patriots
yesterday hardly brought back
memories of Vince Lombardi's
grind-it-out champions of the
19605.
Instead, it was a high-powered
Pack — doing it with big plays,
especially by MVP Desmond
Howard — that returned Green
Bay to NFL prominence and put
the title back in "Titletown, USA."
It was Brett Favre finding the
duckwalking Andre Rison for a 54-
yard touchdown on the Packers'
second offensive play, then throw
ing an 81-yard TD pass to Antonio
Freeman in the first minute of the
second quarter to put Green Bay
ahead for good.
It was Howard scoring on a 99-
yard kickoff return then striking
an abbreviated Heisman pose in
the end zone, a dagger in the heart
of the Patriots, who had closed to
within six points at 27-21.
Howard, the first special teams
player ever to win MVP, finished
with a record 244 return yards.

The win was the 13th straight
for an NFC team and kept Bill Par
cells, who had two of those 13 with
the Giants in 1986 and 1990, from
becoming the first coach to win a
Super Bowl with two different
franchises.
Instead, the Packers won the
trophy named for their storied
coach. It was Lombardi's teams
that won the first two Super Bowls.
There was, of course, time for
sentiment.
It started like a blowout by the
Packers, who fulfilled the high
expectations with which they
entered the season — only coach
Mike Holmgren, who referred to
the Super Bowl as "that game"
rather than by its name, tried to
hold down the exuberance.
First there was the TD pass to
Rison from Favre, who finished 14-
of-27 for 246 yards. It was 10-0 just
6 minutes, 25 seconds into the
game after Doug Evans' intercep
tion set up Chris Jacke's 31-yard
field goal.
But by the end of the highest
scoring first quarter in Super Bowl
history, New England led 14-10 on
TD passes by Bledsoe of 1 yard to

Keith Byars and 4 yards to Ben
Coates.
And even after a 17-point sec
ond quarter by the Packers that
included the 81-yard bomb to Free
man and 2-yard TD run by Favre,
New England was still in it at 27-
14.
And when Ted Johnson stopped
Dorsey Levens for a 7-yard loss on
fourth and one at the Pats 37 on
the first drive of the fourth quar
ter, New England gained momen
tum.
They cut it to 27-21 on Curtis
Martin's 18-yard burst up the mid
dle with 3:27 left in the third quar
ter.
But Howard took the kickoff,
burst up the middle and went near
ly untouched to the end zone —
only Hason Graham got a hand on
him. Then Favre hit Keith Jackson
in the back of the end zone for a
two-point conversion to give the
Packers a 14-point lead.
Bledsoe tried to rally the Patri
ots in the fourth quarter, but could
not. He finished with four intercep
tions, going 25 of 48 for 253 yards.
The first half was so explosive
that the only time to come up for

air was on Green Bay's third
touchdown drive, a nine-play 74-
yard march that took up 5:59 and
gave the Packers a 27-14 lead at
halftime.
Favre capped it with a 2-yard
bootleg into the end zone on which
he extended the ball over the goal
line with his right hand as he went
out of bounds. Levens rem four
times for 33 yards in the drive, the
first time in the game either team
was able to move on the ground.
The New England defense con
tinued to persevere, holding the
Packers without a first down on
four possessions afler the Favre-
Rison touchdown until early in the
second period.
But that ended quickly in the
first minute of the second quarter.
The Packers had a first down on
their own 19 when Favre spotted
safety Lawyer Milloy alone on
Freeman in the slot. Sprung by
loose by an audible, Freeman
streaked past the defensive back,
Favre found him perfectly and sud
denly it was an 81-yard touchdown
— the longest play from scrim
mage in Super Bowl history — and
a 17-14 lead for Green Bay.
