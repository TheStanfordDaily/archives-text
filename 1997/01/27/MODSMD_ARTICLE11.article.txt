# GOP House moderates flex their muscle

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Moder
ate Republicans see themselves as
potential catalysts for a budget-bal
ancing deal between Congress and
President Clinton. But the more
conservative GOP leadership team
is moving quickly to retain control
of the process.
On key budget issues that have
divided the president and Congress
since 1995 — how deeply to cut
taxes, how much savings to extract
fropi Medicare, Medicaid and other
domestic programs — GOP moder
ates have occupied the middle
ground. If the two parties' quest
for a compromise falters again this
year as last, moderates hope to be

able to draw the two sides together.
In the House, moderates say
they have the clout to pressure both
parties toward compromise on bal
ancing the budget by 2002, cutting
spending and reducing taxes.
Their muscle comes from their
numbers: About 40 of them help
make the Republican majority in a
chamber the party dominates by
only 19 votes.
Moderate Republicans will have
less influence in the Senate.
November's voting pushed the
GOP majority from 53-47 to 55-45,
and the Senate, on the whole,
became more conservative.
"It's regrettable we lost the sen-

ators we did," said a remaining
member of the group, Sen.
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine. "But
we'll still play a role."
Maneuvering over a budget plan
runs parallel to GOP intentions to
hold votes in late February on a
constitutional amendment to bal
ance the budget. The amendment
died in the last Congress when the
Senate failed by one vote to reach
the needed two-thirds majority.
Eager to protect their own
power as budget brokers, top
House and Senate Republicans
have asked their moderates not to
produce early budget-balancing
plans on their own or with sympa

thetic Democrats. GOP leaders say
they want first to see the plan Clin
ton unveils on Feb. 6, then they
want to orchestrate a response.
In another move to build a uni
fied GOP budget position, Republi
can leaders have laid out a series of
litmus tests to judge the serious
ness of Clinton's spending plans.
These include demands that
Clinton not play accounting "shell
games" by shifting Medicare costs
from one part of the health-insur
ance program to another, not rely
heavily on spending cuts that may
never occur in future years and
produce permanent — not tempo
rary — tax reductions.
