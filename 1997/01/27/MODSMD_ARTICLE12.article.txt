Cohen will bridge differences
WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretaiy William Cohen said yes
terday he will carry out administration policies on missile defense and
gays and women in the military while, as a former Republican senator,
working to bring the GOP-led Congress on board.
Cohen, who took office on Friday, also urged the Senate to ratify a
treaty banning chemical weapons, saying failure to join other countries
in the international convention could isolate the nation and result in
serious economic losses.
Cohen, a three-term senator from Maine, said he would promote a
"three-plus-three" formula on an anti-missile system worked out by his
predecessor, William Perry.
Under that, the Pentagon would research the concept of a national
defense system until 2000 and then decide whether the threat warrants
deployment by 2003, "which is precisely the year that members on the
Hill wanted."
But Cohen, who as a senator criticized President Clinton on the
Bosnian and other U.S. peacekeeping missions, said he thought Clinton
appointed him "to bridge whatever differences might exist, to build a
consensus on Capitol Hill for the things we need to do."

Bungee accident kills performer
NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Volunteers were controlling the cord of the
bungee jumper who fatally plunged into the Superdome floor and may
have let out too much line, The Times-Picayune reported yesterday.
The newspaper quoted police sources as saying the rope and pulley
used to feed line to Laura Patterson showed no obvious problem,
although experts had not been called in to examine it.
Patterson, 43, of Sarasota, Fla., died of head injuries after hitting the
ground on her second dive Thursday night during a rehearsal for the
Super Bowl's halflime show. A professional aerialist who once per
formed with the Ringling Bros, and Barnum & Bailey's circus, she had
never bungee-jumped before being hired for the Super Bowl job.
California-based Branam Enterprises, which set up the stunt, had
expected local experts to act as riggers but found only volunteers, the
newspaper said. Phones at the company were not answered yesterday
and police did not return a call for comment.
Patterson was one of eight jumpers who were to perform acrobatics
before being towered to the ground along the football field's sidelines
during the halftime program. The segment was scrapped after her
death.
