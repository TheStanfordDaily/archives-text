University must clarify
policy on privacy of
deleted e-mail messages

IN A RECENT report, law stu
dent Leslie Hatamiya unveiled
a disquieting fact concerning
all of our electronic correspon
dence. When one deletes electronic
mail, one expects it to be immedi
ately erased from memory.
Instead, it stays on backup disks
for up to one year.
This means that all correspon
dence, written or received, by
every student, professor and staff
member is in the electronic hands
of the University. This is a fright
ening, Orwellian discovery.
These stored messages are said
to be kepL as a safeguard against a
possible computer system crash,
and University administrators
have assured users that these files
are only accessible by a few people
and only then with the authority
of the chief information officer or
a court order.
All members of the University's
e-mail community should know
that e-mail is not a secure medium
and that any one of our messages,
however unlikely, can be intercept
ed and read. This is a risk that
most of us are comfortable with,
for it is an acceptable trade-off for
the ease and convenience of
instantaneous and global commu
nication. But for all messages,
each encoded with an individual's
electronic identification, to be
stored against the user's wishes is
a step beyond reason.
It is criminal, according to the
University's Internet use policy, to
"break" into other users' accounts
or to read somebody else's mail.
This policy plays in concert with
the Electronic Communications
Act of 1986, which extended feder
al protection to electronic mail.
Yet, these very same messages are
available year round to the Uni
versity. Whether or not these
stored, marked-for-deletion mes

sages are being read is not the
issue. As a part of its responsibili
ty to its customers and as a point
of decency, the University must
protect against the possibility of
abuse.
The reasoning behind e-mail
storage isn't very convincing. As
anyone who uses a computer
knows, backup is essential to
guard against crashes. But to
maintain that electronic corre
spondence deleted over a year ago
is essential to fixing a crashed sys
tem is absurd. It is more likely
that these messages are saved
unintentionally as part of a sys
temwide backup process which
does not discriminate among the
files it saves. Distributed Comput
ing and Communication Systems
would not comment on this issue.
The University must comply
with court orders to seize elec
tronic correspondence, but sav
ing a year's worth of deleted mes
sages seems to be an inconve
nient way to satisfy this obliga
tion. The University must enter
tain other options that would
make e-mail erasure more timety
and sensible.
In order to strike a balance
between the privacy needs of users
and the technical and legal
requirements of the University, a
separate backup system could be
created to handle only user e-mail.
This backup system could be
swiped clean every quarter or even
every month.
Everyone that enjoys an e-mail
account with the University
should be guaranteed a specified
degree of privacy. The University
has not shown a deliberate inten
tion to compromise the privacy of
e-mail messages, but its backup
policy demonstrates a risk for
potential abuse.
Hatamiya's report was an
important wakeup call to the cam
pus. As we all come to rely more
and more on electronic communi
cation through University net
works, it is important that privacy
issues be cleared up earlier rather
than later.
