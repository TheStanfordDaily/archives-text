## Staying clear of 'Implantees' 
### 
A COUPLE OF days ago I ran into
an old friend at the post office.
We had a mundane, useless con
versation that refused to end under any
reasonable circumstances.
As we talked incessantly about the
"old days" and gossiped about other old
friends, the sky began to grow dark.
Rain fell and my friend's eyes grew
wide with a look of terror. "This cli
mate is not conducive to my, uh, my, uh
. . . five, six, seven, eight, woo," he
spouted, collapsing to the ground.
Within two minutes, an orange Resi
dential Computing golf cart was on the
scene.
"What are you doing outside?" a
shady figure asked me suspiciously
from within the cart. He gazed intently
into my eyes as I groped for an answer.
"Never mind," he uttered, "um,
everything is OK here. I'm just gonna
give your buddy a ride to, uh, Cowell."
Treating my friend as if he were a sack
of potatoes, the man threw him into
the back of the cart and sped off —
away from Cowell.
Something strange is afoot at the
Farm, my friend 3.
Pursuant to the aforementioned
incident and several others like it, I've
been doing some research — sifting
through dumpsters and talking with
the chess-playing dudes at the Coffee
House, specifically — and I have come
to a startling conclusion.
A large portion of the Stanford stu
dent population has been automated.

Their brains have been replaced with
microprocessors as part of an ongoing
"efficiency study," sponsored by Resi
dential Education.
That's right, Pentium has replaced
personality and panache has been
swapped for productivity in many Stan
ford students.
I have discovered a number of habits
and rituals common to "Implantees,"
and I will share them with you in the
name of public safety. The majority of
the Implantees are programmed to
gather nightly in the 24-hour study
room, while the remaining fraction
conducts covert operations in their
Manzanita courtyard singles.
The easiest way to identify Them is
by asking the simple question, "Would
you like to go get a cup of coffee?" The
three possible responses are as follows:
"Can't, finals are right around the
corner."
"No, I must go to the lab."
Or in older, less refined models,
"Oh, I've had coffee before," followed
by a sequence of intense blinking.
Some other traits to watch for are
"bedhead," short-sleeve button-down
shirts, astigmatism, fear of light, water
and "change," and a modem port at the
base of the neck.
Newer Implantees are also able to
operate their computers telepathically.
There are, in fact, three confirmed
sightings of alleged Implantees sitting,
eyes closed, in the lotus position at
their computers while playing Doom.

Implantees also have several limita
tions. They have to live in either dorms
or recently renovated Row houses to be
near a "power source."
Also, their food intake must be sili
con-based to ensure proper cerebral
function; as a result, they dine fre
quently at the Stern and Roble dining
halls as well as the Terman cafe.
Implantees are basically boring and
harmless, but you can never be too
careful. Make sure to keep conversa
tions with them terse and brief. Try not
to be too socially engaging because your
efforts will be wasted. And most impor
tantly, never, never accept an invita
tion to the "Forsythe Hall Free Ice
Cream and Stanford T-Shirt Party."
Keep this in mind the next time you
are engaged in a miserable conversa
tion with someone you've lost contact
with over the years.
Conspiracy surrounds us all, broth
ers and sisters. Make sure you don't get
dragged in by one of its stealthy tenta
cles.
