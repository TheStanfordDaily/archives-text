ASSU leader explains 6 University for students' campaign

CONSIDER A UNIVERSITY
where the administration and an
unknown Board of Trustees are
motivated primarily by image or rank
ings and where the financial bottom line
is always the highest trump. A universi
ty where students are commodities and
where the faculty are only valued if they
help the university "compete in the aca
demic market." A university that only
exists within itself, cares nothing about
the outside world and runs like an
amoral business. A place where, as
renowned educator Ernest Boyer put it:
"Students get credentialed and faculty
get tenured."
Next consider a university where edu
cation is a public, not private, benefit and
where the ultimate goal is teaching stu
dents how to serve the outside world.
Where moral education and action is
encouraged and debated and where there

is an inextricable link between the cam
pus and the world around. A place where
teachers teach and students matter. A
place where dedicated and thoughtful
students with creative ideas are given
real opportunities to bring change.
The former is the students-for-a-uni
versity model. The latter is the universi
ty-for-students model, and they are both
ideal types. Stanford, like all other uni
versities lies somewhere in between with
a mix of both.
The trouble is this: Stanford lies in
between, but it is too close to the former
and continues to lurch in that direction.
This doesn't mean I want to have myself
and other activist or idealist students in
Building 10; if that happened, we'd run
the school into the ground. What I do
mean, and I think that most students
agree, is that the balance isn't right.
Thursday's Daily editorial got it par

tially right. It wasn't the best thing for
ASSU President Bill Shen, me and the
many other students who worked with us
to start the "University for students and
society" campaign the way we did. We
screwed up. What The Daily got wrong is
that this campaign really matters.
Consider the socially responsible
endowment fund. Students came up
with the idea, brought it to the adminis
tration and were rejected before they
could submit a final proposal. Universi
ty President Gerhard Casper did not
respond to a detailed letter we wrote to
him, and the rejection caught us totally
by surprise. Moreover, the rejection let
ter did not contain any sort of moral
context. (Reasonable people can disagree
with some of our moral arguments, but
no one should be able to simply ignore
them.)
A socially responsible endowment

fund — the idea that students should be
able to give money to the University
without it supporting sweatshop labor or
the SLORC — may not be the most criti
cal issue to you. But, what does matter is
that this is indicative of a larger trend, a
trend we are trying to reverse with this
campaign.
If we really are to build a university for
students and society, there needs to be
substantial student input on the Bod. J of
Trustees. There need to be real avenues
for students who care passionately about
issues to have their voices heard before
gathering a million petitions or striking
in the Quad. We must be convinced that
our education is much more important
than our alumni donation statistics and
that Stanford really is committed both to
society and to us.
