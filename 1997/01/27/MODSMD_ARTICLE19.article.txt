# Alpha Phi Alpha works for black male relationships
## 
### 
The members of Alpha Phi Alpha
Fraternity, Inc., Nu Sigma Chapter
were glad to see the issue of relations
among black men on campus brought to
the forefront of Stanford's attention.
We agree with columnist Garry Grundy
that this issue needs to be investigated,
discussed and debated intelligently
more than it is currently being done.
The fraternity was founded 91 years
ago at Cornell University with similar
goals in mind. Seven students wanted
to enjoy a closer relationship with one

another than their studies would allow.
Throughout its history, the fraternity
has attracted men who aim to enter the
ongoing discussion among educated
black men. Men such as W.E.B.
Dußuois, Martin Luther King Jr. and
Justice Thurgood Marshall have con
tributed greatly to the self-definition of
the black man.
This tradition is being continued on
Stanford's campus with the Third
Annual Alpha Phi Alpha Awards Pro
gram. It will be held Feb. 13 in Tresid
der Union's Oak Lounge. This year's
theme is "Brothers Forging a Path of
Excellence." This program will high
light academic and community accom
plishments of Stanford's black men for
a wide range of achievements. Seven
men will be recognized with awards.

Nominations will be accepted from all
members of the Stanford community.
Nomination forms will be in the Elack
Community Service Center, or nomina
tions can be e-mailed to
drwill@leland.stanford.edu. We aim to
show men from a numbe r of areas of
the campus whose accomplishments are
not limited to the "big three" (Ujamaa,
fraternities and athletics).
We hope that all members of the
Stanford community will feel welcome
to join us in recognizing outstanding
men of the Stanford community.
We are working to contribute to the
ongoing conversation among black men.
Hopefully the awards and the other
events of winter quarter's Alpha Week
will catalyze some much-needed discus
sion.

The solution definitely is not in
weakening the uniting effects of any of
the "big three" campus institutions. It
certainly cannot be found in making or
following uninformed prejudices and
assumptions. It can only be found in
forming alliances and relationships
based on strengths and commonalties
which can transcend affiliations.
