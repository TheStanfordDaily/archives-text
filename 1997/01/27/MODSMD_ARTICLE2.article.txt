# $4 million expected savings
## Administration streamlines buying process 
### Vanessa Hua Staff writer 
Stanford Acquisition Support, a team of staff mem
bers that oversees the University's buying processes, is
implementing a streamlining system that would trim
about $4 million in annual operating costs from the
University budget.
"We're re-engineering the whole process for pur
chasing goods and services," said team manager John
Murphy.
Under the team's leadership, the Buy Pay project de
veloped a plan that reduced the paperwork necessary
for procurement by negotiating with a new office sup
ply vendor, BT Office Products International, and also
with Fischer Scientific, which sells laboratory equip
ment.
The advantages of this new system are faster deliv
ery and cheaper prices, said team forum chair Lisa Ak
selrad.
"The beauty of it is you order and it comes the next
day right to your desk," Akselrad said.
Products from BT can be ordered online. While this
is similar to the old system, the renegotiation of prices
and services will create more efficiency. The online
store replaces many of the functions previously held by
University Central Stores, an on-campus store, Mur
phy said.
However, Central Stores has continued to serve
niche needs, Murphy said. Although Central Stores has
scaled back its product offerings, it still carries some
items unavailable from BT. In addition, some employ
ees may need the same-day convenience of the on-cam
pus store, Murphy said.
In the future, the University may be able to pur
chase other products online, as Stanford Acquisition
Support negotiates with more vendors, he said.
Currently, the University spends about $1.8 million
a year on office supplies. BT Office Products accounts
for about $1.4 million of that amount, Murphy said.
The Buy Pay team will further reduce paperwork
with the use of a liability card that bills the University's
account directly. Thus, the University only has to make
one payment to the credit card company, instead of
writing individual checks for each department, Mur
phy said.
In addition, employees can buy directly from the
company without filling out forms beforehand, or they
can seek reimbursement later, a convenience that saves
time and money, Murphy said.
More than 200 liability cards, or P-cards, are in use,
with a total of 1,000 scheduled for distribution bv the
end of August. Other economic steps include electronic
transmittal of invoices and wire
transfer payment.
Savings were calculated in terms
of lower prices and time saved, not
as a function of employee cutbacks,
said Procurement Department Ad
ministrative Services Manager
Rich Baldwin.

Instead, employees may be
spending more time on new respon
sibilities that come from the decen
tralization of procurement, Mur
phy said.
Departments will have the op
tion of training their staff to certify
reimbursements. Employees with
in a particular department are clos
er to the source of information and
may have a better understanding of
financial transactions that go on
there, he said.
