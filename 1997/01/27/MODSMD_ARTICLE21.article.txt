Everyone can comment
on ethnic theme dorms
The growing debate about the nature
and function of ethnic communities vis-a
vis ethnic theme dorms has, it seems,
taken a rather ugly turn. I was shocked
that students would intimate that Mered
ith McMorrow (Friday's letters) had "no
right" to comment on ethnic communities
because of her race or what dorm she has
or hasn't lived in. Anyone living in a free
society has the right to criticize anything
they see as problematic. Although McMor
row wrote in support of ideas expressed by
Garry Grundy, who is black, respondents
to her letter conveniently limited their
attacks to McMorrow, who is white.
Regardless of the mouth from whence
they come, the issues raised by Grundy
and McMorrow are indeed pertinent and
should be addressed by ethnic communi
ties.
I am an African-American senior who
lived in Ujamaa for one year. It is my
impression that while many black stu

dents feel welcomed and a part of the com
munity in Ujamaa, many others feel
estranged and ostracized. Solange Jacobs
is correct in her assertion that all dorms
have cliques. However, she fails to realize
that the difference between Ujamaa and
"other dorms" is that due to the paucity of
black students on campus, when we feel
unwelcome at Ujamaa, we feel unwelcome
by Stanford's black community. Hence,
the need for serious evaluation of any crit
cism of the social climate there and by
extension, in other ethnic theme dorms.
Although I hate to pull rank, I feel it
necessary to assert that both McMorrow
and I are seniors, and Grundy a junior. I
would suggest to Jacobs that she take into
consideration our collective relationships
and experiences living inside and outside
of Ujamaa, compared to her one quarter
living solely in Ujamaa.
To Neal Chen — exactly how long
would a person have to live in Okada, or be
a student at Stanford where one in four
students is Asian American, to get a sense
of the Asian-American community here?
The real issue at hand is not the qualifica
tions of the speakers, but the speakers'

assertions that the ethnic communities
and theme dorms at Stanford have not
done their best to unify or even include
many of their community members.
By talking to blacks and Asian Ameri
cans outside of their respective ethnic
theme dorms, even Chen and Jacobs will
not take long to realize this fact.

Responding to Grundy
Garry Grundy's column ("Race mat
ters on the Farm," last Tuesday's
Daily) brought up some very significant
points. I may not be black, but I am a
member of the Chicano / Latino com
munity. The issue of male-male inter
action within my community is far
from the one described in Grundy's col
umn discussing African-American
male-male interaction.
Everybody is welcome in my commu
nity. Whether males are in SCCLES,
Los Hermanos, MEChA, Barrio Assis
tance, Black Sheep or in none of the
above — we all know each other and

respect each other's various opinions.
We are constantly discussing, disagree
ing and interacting outside of our spe
cific clusters. The men within any of the
above-mentioned groups do not limit
themselves to those within the group.
For example, last quarter, although I
did not attend, we all got together to
play a friendly game of football.
It pains me as a card-carrying mem
ber of the NAACP to see that black men
at our University interact so rarely out
side of what Grundy described as the
"trinity" (fraternity, football, Ujamaa).
I would hope that the community
would make greater efforts to rectify
this unfortunate breach of brotherhood
within the black community. Was the
Million Man March, comprised of poor,
middle- and upper-class black males, a
one-time event not to be continued
across the nation forever?
Grundy has walked a very fine line.
In my opinion, he is a brave soul for
speaking what is on the minds of many
(they are your football teammates, your
fellow Ujamites, and your fraternity
brothers). They are hiding in the back

of the bus, but Grundy has just invited
them forward.
I may not be black, but as a male of a
minority group, I encourage the broth
ers to get together and talk. Reach out.
If you already have, do it again and
again! You can't miss.

Jacobs 9 letter was
example of'hostility 9
I found Solange Jacobs' statement (Fri
day's letters) about another student's
"pretty little Southern head" a rather
unenlightened example of the hostility she
is attempting to refute. It's interesting how
a letter adressing issues of racism and hos
tility closes with such a biting example of
regionalist sarcasm. Or perhaps (as Jacobs
suggests) I shouldn't worry myself with
matters that do not concern me. Of course,
that doctrine is potentially dangerous in
itself.
