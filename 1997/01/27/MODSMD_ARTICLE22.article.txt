## Baseball cruises in season opener 
### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
After one weekend of NCAA baseball play, it's rain
1, Stanford 1.
After its season opener Saturday was postponed
due to rain, the Cardinal was able to come back to
beat mother nature — and lethargic opponent St.
Mary's — on a gorgeous day at Sunken Diamond yes
terday, proving that all the nation's No. 1 team needs
to post a victory is a sunny day.
The Card did that in convincing fashion, exploding
into the season with a 18-6 victory over the hapless
St. Mary's Gaels, and Stanford will try to complete
the sweep at 3 p.m. today at Sunken Daimond.
The game was only close for the first 5 minutes,
when Stanford's opening day pitcher, junior Kyle
Peterson (1-0), set the Gaels down in order in the top
of the first.
"It was good to come out and throw strikes on the
first day," Peterson said. "And it was nice to get so
much help from the offense."
The 0-0 score wouldn't continue, as the Cardinal
used the bottom of the inning to pump out 10 runs
while sending 15 batters to the plate.
Freshman second baseman and leadoff hitter Tony
Schrager started things off by smacking a double into
right-center field. After junior right fielder Joe Kil
burg flew out, sophomore center fielder Jody Gerut
smashed a home run over the right-field fence,
putting the Cardinal up 2-0.
But St. Mary's couldn't capitalize on the one out,
nobody on situation. After junior catcher and
cleanup hitter Jon Schaeffer flew out on a monstrous
shot to center just below the 400-feet sign, St. Mary's
senior pitcher Aaron Porter hit senior Luke Quaccia
with a pitch, sending him to first. After taking second
on a passed ball, Quaccia was able to steam home
when sophomore third baseman Josh Hochgesang
swung at a third strike that got by Gael catcher
Travis Kermode, making the score 3-0.
Stanford wasn't even near done yet. The next bat
ter, designated hitter sophomore John Salter, leaned
into a pitch to become the second player to be hit by
a ball in the inning. Senior Chris Clark, following
Salter, lined a two-run double to make the score 5-0.
The Card was barely halfway there. After two
more runs, an error and another hit batsman, the
bases were loaded for Gerut. After running the count
to 3-0, he took a close pitch on the outside corner that
the umpire called a ball, waking in a run, giving him
his third RBI of the inning and making the score 8-0.
With the bases still loaded, Schaeffer approached
the plate for his second chance of the inning. He
delivered, smashing a double to the right-center field
fence, marking two more runs for the Card and run
ning the score to 10-0.
Only then did St. Mary's coach Rod Ingram decide
to change pitchers, yanking Aaron Porter (0-1) in a
decision that finally killed the Cardinal's first inning.
But no one could contain the Cardinal for very long,
as it scored two more in the second and added anoth
er two in the third.
Meanwhile, however, St. Mary's offense was play
ing on the other side of the spectrum. After setting
the team down 1-2-3 again in the second, Peterson
gave up a screaming line-drive home run to freshman
Tommy Callen. But the mighty home run looked a lot
like a mouse in context, as it brought the Gaels to
within 11, making the score 12-1.
The Gaels were able to add one in each of the next
two innings, but after five innings, the score was 15-3.
Noteworthy for the Card was the performance of
relief pitching. Before the season, it was a big ques
tion mark for the Cardinal, but yesterday left little
