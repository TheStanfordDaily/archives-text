# Volleyball wins two matches at Ohio St.
## 
### Parker Hume Contributing writer 
This weekend the Stanford
men's volleyball team began to
assert its dominance over the rest
of the nation's top squads. In both
of the matches the Cardinal
played, first against Indiana-Pur
due-Fort Wayne, and then against
the Buckeyes of Ohio State, it was
triumphant. Although neither vic
tory came easily, both left little
doubt about two things — that the
Cardinal was the best team at the
NCAA Preview Tournament and
senior outside hitter Mike Lambert
is the best collegiate volleyball
player in the land.
On Friday night, against Indi
ana-Purdue-Fort Wayne, a team
that Stanford had lost to just two
weeks before in Santa Barbara,
the Cardinal avenged its earlier
defeat in convincing fashion. After
winning the first game of the
match 15-9, the Cardinal dropped
the second game 15-11, setting up

a critical third game. In game
three, in the pivotal point of the
match, Lambert took over to lead
the Cardinal to a 15-12 victory.
After that game, Indiana-Purdue-
Fort Wayne folded, going down
quickly in the fourth game 15-6.
Lambert, who finished the
match with 31 kills and a hitting
percentage was the Cardinal's
biggest star.
"Mike had a really big night,"
said head coach Ruben Nieves.
"We set him lots, and he had clutch
kill after kill. He was dominant."
In addition to Lambert, two
players not normally thought of as
stars had outstanding perfor
mances. Junior swing hitter Devin
Poolman came off the bench to
replace freshman Andy Whitt and
provided 11 kills and two service
aces, finishing the match with an
outstanding hitting percentage of
.563. In addition to Poolman,
junior Tad Hoffman, another
match with an outstanding hit
ting percentage of .563. In addi
tion to Poolman, junior Tad Hoff
man, another reserve svvingman,
came in to replace senior middle
blocker Mike Hoefer, who was
having an uncharacteristically
poor hitting night, to provide out
standing blocking and generally
stabilize the overall play of the
team.
Saturday's contest against
Ohio State followed much the
same pattern as the previous
night's match. Again the Cardi
nal split the first two games, win
ning the first 15-7 but falling in
the second game by the same
score. As a result, game three was
critical once more, and Lambert

carried the Cardinal to victory as
he did the night before.
With Stanford trailing 10-4 in
the third game, Lambert took
over. The team stormed back to
tie the game at 10-10 and went on
to win 15-12. Once again, the
Cardinal's win in the third game
spelled the end for the opposition,
as the Buckeyes folded in the
fourth game 15-5, conceding the
match.
Lambert once again led the
Cardinal with 35 kills and a .403
hitting percentage. In addition to
Lambert, three other players con
tributed greatly. Whitt, who had
struggled Friday, had 24 kills and
finished match with a team-high
.543 hitting percentage. Hoff
man and Poolman came off the
bench to spell starters who were
not playing up to usual stan
dards. Hoffman relieved junior
middle blocker Keenan White

hurst while Poolman came in to
spell three-time All-American
Matt Fuerbringer, who had a
very poor hitting match.
Although both Lambert and
Whitt provided outstanding hit
ting, the real story of the match
was the Cardinal's unusually
strong serving. Over the course of
the match, Stanford had 10 ser
vice aces while the Buckeyes tal
lied only one ace. The ability to
hit great serves allowed the Car
dinal to overcome a poor hitting
night in which it was outhit by
the Buckeyes .368 to .355.
"Even though Fuerbringer,
one of our big guns, really strug
gled, we were able to overcome
this with great play by Mike and
Andy," Nieves said. "Also we
came up with some great jump
serves every time we need one.
We didn't play really well, but we
were good enough to win. That's

what good teams can do."
Lambert's performance was
awesome. Over the two nights he
not only filled up the stat sheets
with great numbers, he also con
tributed outstanding senior lead
ership.
"Mike Lambert was the most
dominant player on the floor both
nights, without a doubt," Nieves
said. "There have been times ear
lier this season when that hasn't
been the case, but it was clear this
weekend. We can't rely on him to
be this way every night, but we
will need it from time to time like
we did this weekend. He was
awfully, awfully good."
Now that both Lambert and
the Cardinal have asserted their
dominance in the Midwest, they
look to do the same when they
begin Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation play next weekend in
San Diego.
