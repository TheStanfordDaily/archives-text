This weekend the Stanford
men's volleyball team began to
assert its dominance over the rest
of the nation's top squads. In both

Poolman came off the bench to
replace freshman Andy Whitt and
provided 11 kills and two service
aces, finishing the match with an
outstanding hitting percentage of
.563. In addition to Poolman,
