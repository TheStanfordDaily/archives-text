# Cougars become 35th consecutive victim in Pac-10

PULLMAN, Wash. - Nei
ther snow nor another
pumped-up conference oppo
nent could stop the third
ranked Stanford women's
basketball team (20-1, 8-0
Pacific 10 Conference) from
getting out of Pullman with a
lackadaisical 84-75 victory
over the Washington State
Cougars (7-9, 1-6) in a nation
ally televised game in Bohler
Gym.
Nevertheless, it was a mile
stone game for senior guard
Jamila Wideman, who in her
first start since the Oregon
game on Jan. 16, got seven
assists to become only the
third player in Stanford histo
ry to dish out more than 500
career assists.
Junior forward Kate Star
bird once again led the way
with her pinpoint shooting to
score 31 points while junior
center Olympia Scott chipped
in down low with 14 points
before fouling out with 6 min
utes, 10 seconds to go in the
contest.
"I'm happy for our team
that we were successful," said
Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "But I wouldn't
call this any type of an ecstat
ic locker room. I think people
are disappointed because we
have higher expectations."
The Cardinal jumped
ahead 23-15 when Starbird
took Wideman's 500 th assist
and drained a three-pointer 9
minutes into the game to
stretch a lead that it would
never relinquish the rest of
the way. However, the lead
never got larger than 14 in the
first half as sloppy ball han
dling (11 first-half Cardinal
turnovers) kept the Cougars
in the game. Then again,
Washington State was not
exactly capitalizing either,
missing six free throws,
shooting 41 percent from the
field and turning the ball over
15 times. All told, it was a
messy first half that saw the
Cardinal take a 40-28 advan
tage into the locker room.
The final 20 minutes
included a bit more focused

effort by the Cardinal as it
took care of the ball and shot a
solid 54 percent from the
floor. Wideman also got into
the scoring act, penetrating
effectively and hitting from
the outside, including a short
jumper from just outside the
paint to give her team a 64-49
lead with 9:28 to go in the
game.
Wideman's injured ankle
"felt really good today," she
said. "I still want to give it
time to heal but hopefully,
I'm on an upward curve."
Yet the Cougars refused to
go down without a fight,
matching the Cardinal almost
basket for basket, hitting 17-
of-32 from the field on their
way to a 47-point half, the
most given up by Stanford all
season. Furthermore, Cougar
junior forward Amy Saneholtz
found her comfort zone on the
left side of the paint, scoring
16 second-half points that
helped cut the Cougars'
deficit to nine at 68-59 with
about 5 minutes to go.
The Cardinal was able to
respond the next time down
the court with a clutch three
pointer by freshman guard
Milena Flores and was never
really seriously threatened
after that. Stanford was ready
to wrap it up and become the
first Division I team to reach
the 20-victorv mark except for
one problem — Washington
State's insistence to drag the
game out as long as humanly
possible. The Cougars fouled
intentionally seven times over
the final 1:27, including an
absolutely useless foul with
4.6 seconds left by freshman
guard Cathy McNeely.
"I was really impressed
with the way they came out
and the way they stuck with
things for the whole game,"
Starbird said. "They kept
playing with a lot of heart and
that was really impressive to
us."
Despite Stanford's excel
lent record. No. 3 ranking and
35th consecutive conference
victory, VanDerveer still has
reason to be concerned. Since
hosting the Arizona schools,
the Cardinal has had trouble
with the second game of each
weekend set. Arizona came out
strong in the first half, the game
at USC was a dogfight all the way
to the end, Oregon State made a
huge run at Stanford in the sec
ond half and now, the Cougars
were able to make it close.
"There are a lot of factors at
work," VanDerveer said. "You've
got injury situations, you've got
travel, you've got playing well at
Washington (Thursday). You
could have all kinds of excuses if
you want to use excuses, or you
could have a team that says,
'This is a great opportunity to
play a team on national televi
sion. Let's come out and get after
it.'
"Our team has not made a
conscious decision to compete for
40 minutes, that's what I see.
I've seen it happen a couple of
times and it's frustrating. It's a
team demise because if you can
not come out and compete for 40
minutes, you're not going to put
yourself in a situation where
you're going to contend for a
national championship."
