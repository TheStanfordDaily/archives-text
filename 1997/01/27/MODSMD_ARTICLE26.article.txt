# Men complete weekend sweep
## 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Stanford's games against Washington and Wash
ington State this weekend were more a test of the
Cardinal's character and resiliency than they were
true tests on the court
That's not to take anything away from the
Huskies (10-5, 3-4 Pacific 10 Conference) or the
Cougars (10-8, 2-5), but let's face it: Playing at
home against a couple of middle-of-the-pack teams,
a team as talented as No. 17 Stanford had no excuse
for coming away from this weekend with anything
but two wins.
And win the Cardinal did, following through on
last Thursday's win over Washington with a 81-61
drumming of Washington State on Saturday night
before 7,231 at Maples Pavilion.
And so, with a 6-2 Pac-10 record (13-4 overall) —
good for sole possession of second place, a half-game
behind UCLA — heading into the halfway point of
the conference season, the Cardinal now turns its
attention to a trio of grueling road games, beginning
with Wednesday night's showdown at California.
"It was definitely a big weekend for us, M said
sophomore forward Peter Sauer. "We've gone
through two road trips already — to Arizona and

freshman guard David Moseley runs alongside.
Oregon — that are some tough
places to play, and maybe we lost
some opportunities. We just kind of
wanted to get back home, get the
wins we needed and then focus on
the road games again."
Saturday, Stanford was simply
too much for an undersized, under
manned Washington State team to
handle. The Cardinal raced out to a
12-0 lead and used an 11-0 second
half run to put away the Cougars.
"I think you'll see this team con
tinue to climb," said Washington
State head coach Kevin Eastman.
"They're better than Georgia —
who we played — I think personal
ly, in a series, would beat Michigan
— who we've played — and those
were two of the better teams that
we've played.
"Regardless of what [Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery] may try
to fool you with, they have all the
parts. Some are very obvious —
you've got to have a good big guy,
you've got to have a good point
guard. But if you have a good big
guy, there's two other things you
have to have, and they have it:
You've got to have shooters, so it

clears out some space for the big
guy, and then you've to have good
passers."
One of the passers Eastman
pointed to was Sauer. Sauer hurt
Washington State not only with his
passing, but also with his shooting
(he was 5-of-5 in the first half, fin
ishing with 14 points) and
rebounding (four offensive boards).
The Cardinal also got solid out
ings from sophomore center Tim
Young (19 points, nine rebounds)
and rapidly improving freshman
forward Mark Madsen, who turned
in eight rebounds and a career-high
nine points and earned praise in
Montgomery's postgame remarks
for the second contest in a row.
"I'm feeling more and more
comfortable. At first I was pretty
jittery out there," Madsen said. "I
still have to be a better finisher
inside. I think that was pretty evi
dent in the first half — I had the
open dunk, and I rushed it."
Then, of course, there was
Brevin. Senior point guard Brevin
Knight notched 17 points, eight
assists, seven rebounds and was all
over the court defensively, record
ing seven steals. About the only
lowlight for the Cardinal on this
night was the continued shooting
woes of sophomore Kris Weems.
Weems, who has had trouble find

ing his three-point stroke in recent
weeks, was just l-of-5 from behind
the arc.
Washington State fought back a
number of times in the second half,
but could never trim the lead any
closer than seven points.
"I think when you get it to five,
it's a lot easier to get it to three,"
Eastman said. "It's more difficult
sometimes to get it to nine, seven,
five ... but when you get it to five,
sometimes there's a lot of pressure
on that other team to make that
next shot. And we never got them
over the hump to the point where I
felt that they felt they had to make
that next shot."
Wednesday, Stanford will visit
Cal's Harmon Gym, where the
Golden Bears registered a 28-
point rout of Washington on Sat
urday to improve to 5-3 in the
Pac-10, good for fourth place.
Then the Cardinal travels to Los
Angeles for road games at USC
and UCLA on Feb. 6 and 8,
respectively, which is precisely
why Stanford could ill afford a
loss at home this weekend.
"We needed these, and even
though it wasn't artistic at times,
the bottom line is we got the win,"
Montgomery said. "We're basically
where we need to be right now
heading into Cal."

and UCLA on Feb. 6 and 8,
respectively, which is precisely
why Stanford could ill afford a
loss at home this weekend.
"We needed these, and even
though it wasn't artistic at times,
the bottom line is we got the win,"
Montgomery said. "We're basically
where we need to be right now
heading into Cal."

Stanford's games against Washington and Wash
ington State this weekend were more a test of the
Cardinal's character and resiliency than they were
true tests on the court
That's not to take anything away from the
Huskies (10-5, 3-4 Pacific 10 Conference) or the
Cougars (10-8, 2-5), but let's face it: Playing at
home against a couple of middle-of-the-pack teams,
a team as talented as No. 17 Stanford had no excuse
for coming away from this weekend with anything
but two wins.
And win the Cardinal did, following through on
last Thursday's win over Washington with a 81-61
drumming of Washington State on Saturday night
before 7,231 at Maples Pavilion.
And so, with a 6-2 Pac-10 record (13-4 overall) —
good for sole possession of second place, a half-game
behind UCLA — heading into the halfway point of
the conference season, the Cardinal now turns its
attention to a trio of grueling road games, beginning
with Wednesday night's showdown at California.
"It was definitely a big weekend for us, M said
sophomore forward Peter Sauer. "We've gone
through two road trips already — to Arizona and

Oregon — that are some tough
places to play, and maybe we lost
some opportunities. We just kind of
wanted to get back home, get the
wins we needed and then focus on
the road games again."
Saturday, Stanford was simply
too much for an undersized, under
manned Washington State team to
handle. The Cardinal raced out to a
12-0 lead and used an 11-0 second
half run to put away the Cougars.
"I think you'll see this team con
tinue to climb," said Washington
State head coach Kevin Eastman.
"They're better than Georgia —
who we played — I think personal
ly, in a series, would beat Michigan
— who we've played — and those
were two of the better teams that
we've played.
"Regardless of what [Stanford
coach Mike Montgomery] may try
to fool you with, they have all the
parts. Some are very obvious —
you've got to have a good big guy,
you've got to have a good point
guard. But if you have a good big
guy, there's two other things you
have to have, and they have it:
You've got to have shooters, so it

clears out some space for the big
guy, and then you've to have good
passers."
One of the passers Eastman
pointed to was Sauer. Sauer hurt
Washington State not only with his
passing, but also with his shooting
(he was 5-of-5 in the first half, fin
ishing with 14 points) and
rebounding (four offensive boards).
The Cardinal also got solid out
ings from sophomore center Tim
Young (19 points, nine rebounds)
and rapidly improving freshman
forward Mark Madsen, who turned
in eight rebounds and a career-high
nine points and earned praise in
Montgomery's postgame remarks
for the second contest in a row.
"I'm feeling more and more
comfortable. At first I was pretty
jittery out there," Madsen said. "I
still have to be a better finisher
inside. I think that was pretty evi
dent in the first half — I had the
open dunk, and I rushed it."
Then, of course, there was
Brevin. Senior point guard Brevin
Knight notched 17 points, eight
assists, seven rebounds and was all
over the court defensively, record
ing seven steals. About the only
lowlight for the Cardinal on this
night was the continued shooting
woes of sophomore Kris Weems.
Weems, who has had trouble find

ing his three-point stroke in recent
weeks, was just l-of-5 from behind
the arc.
Washington State fought back a
number of times in the second half,
but could never trim the lead any
closer than seven points.
"I think when you get it to five,
it's a lot easier to get it to three,"
Eastman said. "It's more difficult
sometimes to get it to nine, seven,
five ... but when you get it to five,
sometimes there's a lot of pressure
on that other team to make that
next shot. And we never got them
over the hump to the point where I
felt that they felt they had to make
that next shot."
Wednesday, Stanford will visit
Cal's Harmon Gym, where the
Golden Bears registered a 28-
point rout of Washington on Sat
urday to improve to 5-3 in the
Pac-10, good for fourth place.
Then the Cardinal travels to Los
Angeles for road games at USC
and UCLA on Feb. 6 and 8,
respectively, which is precisely
why Stanford could ill afford a
loss at home this weekend.
"We needed these, and even
though it wasn't artistic at times,
the bottom line is we got the win,"
Montgomery said. "We're basically
where we need to be right now
heading into Cal."
