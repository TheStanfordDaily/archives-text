# Big men have become an added strength in the Cardinal's game

Given the fact that Washington
State entered Maples Pavilion on
Saturday with just two players 6-
foot-8 or toiler, many fans expected
(he Cardinal to dominate inside the
paint and own the boards.
Those people were right —
Stanford did control the inside play
of the game, as the Cardinal big
men out-rebounded the Cougars
46-35 en route to an 81-61 victory.
Stanford was also able to keep Car
los Daniel, Washington State's
only inside threat, in check for
most of the game.

"lnside, Daniel is a pretty good
player," said Cardinal head coach
Mike Montgomery. "And until we
started fouling him late, we were in
pretty good shape there."
A main reason for the Cardi
nal's success was sophomore cen
ter Tim Young's ability to control
Daniel in the low post. Young, who
was second to Daniel in rebounding
in the Pacific 10 Conference com
ing into the game, out-rebounded
Daniel 9-6. Young also outscored
the big man 19-17, and most of
Daniel's points came with Young
on the bench.
"They're just a strong team;
they have a lot of big guys t hat they

keep running in and out," Daniel
said. "Our guys have to keep play
ing hard, but I can't take anything
away from Stanford — they have a
great inside game."
Young was not the only Cardi
nal big man that played well
against the Cougars though.
Sophomore forward Peter Sauer
came out with the hot hand for
Stanford, hitting all five of his first
half shots for 10 points. Freshman
Mark Madsen was also effective on
the boards, pulling down eight
rebounds.
"I thought Sauer had a good ball
game, stepping on the baseline and
shooting the ball early on," Mont

gomery said. "Madsen came in and
again gave us a lift on the offensive
glass, and Tim Young continues to
be a focal point."
Madsen, who has played better
with each game, also added nine
points Saturday. Most important
ly, though, he cleaned up the offen
sive glass, as five of his eight
rebounds came on the offensive
end.
"Madsen's starting to get better
as he gets more practice time,"
Montgomery said. "But he's also
benefiting from having Tim Young
because people are working real
