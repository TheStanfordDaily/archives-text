The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team held its own against No.
10 Washington in its first away
meet of the season but fell just
short of the win. Not letting the
Hec Edmundson Pavilion crowd of
2,741 get to it, the Stanford team
kept focused and stepped closer to
its own goals.
"Everything we've been doing
in practice, everything we've been
talking about at meetings — it's all
accumulating and coming togeth
er," said coach Lisa Izzi.
The Cardinal (0-3, 0-2 Pacific
10 Conference) strove for clean
routines this weekend; although
each gymnast has strong and com
plex routines of high difficulty, the
squad "watered down" routines in
order to ensure team consistency.
They took out high-level moves in
the routines as a way to experience
a consistent and confident meet.
The result was a near-perfect
team performance with an overall
score of 193.9 to Washington's
195.0. Despite winning all four
events individually — junior co
captain Keri Monahan on the
vault, freshman Larissa Fontaine
on the uneven bars and sophomore
co-captain Amy Murakami on the
balance beam and floor exercise —
Stanford was not quite able to take
home a team victory over the
Huskies (2-1, 1-0).
However, the Stanford team
was definitely more consistent.
Cutting major falls down to two for
the entire meet, the Card set a
team record of 49.35 on the vault,
with Monahan producing a Stan
ford record of 9.975.
On the beam, the Cardinal
marked a strong score of 48.75, a
significant improvement from
46.275 just two weeks ago.
Murakami said that although
the team got off to a tentative
start, the Stanford squad looked
more confident on the difficult
beam, and picked up momentum

as the meet progressed.
The beam has kept the team
short of victories so far, as Cardi
nal members have experienced
some falls and shaky landings in
the past meets. However, there
was only one fall on the beam this
meet, which could be counted out
of the official scoring.
"We had some falls this meet,
but we are getting better,"
Murakami said. "I think we did
well for the first away meet. We
didn't get distracted by the other
team, and stayed together really
well."
The Cardinal underwent a last
minute change in the lineup after
warming up for the meet. Rookie
Fontaine injured her ankle at the
meet against UCLA last weekend,
and the soreness allowed her to
compete only on the vault and bars.
Sophomore Katie Fitzpatrick
and freshman Annie Thanopavarn
quickly warmed up and took
Fontaine's places on the beam and
floor exercise, respectively.
The Cardinal roster will face
Washington later on in the sea
son at the Pac-10 Champi
onships. Izzi said the rematch
will be "one of the most exciting
meets this year."
"They were a very strong
team," Izzi said of Washington.
"They make little mistakes, and
they cannot be taken lightly."
The Washington meet on the
road was a way for each gymnast
to see glimpses of what she could
possibly do, of what is in store for
young and skilled team for the rest
of the season.
The season is only a quarter of
the way through, and Izzi said
there is plenty of time to reinstall
the difficulty in the routines. In
three to four weeks, Cardinal fans
can expect to see a more complete
team with more refined and pol
ished routines.
"We have so much talent,"
Murakami said. "We can totally
see potential; we're right there. We
just have to hit it, be clean."
