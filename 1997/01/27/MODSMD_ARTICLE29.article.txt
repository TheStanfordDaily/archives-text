Although the Stanford
wrestling team suffered a dis
couraging defeat to the 25th
ranked Oregon Ducks 22-10
Thursday, the squadrallied to
destroy UC-Davis 25-9 in an
incredibly exciting dual match
Saturday.
Between freshman Rudy
Ruiz's aggressive body throws,
freshman Zach Zimmerer's suf
focating head locks, sophomore
B.J. Sanchez's unbreakable pin,
junior Scott Chapman's bone
crushing arm bars and, of
course, junior Jason Gladden's
"secret move," the crowd thun
dered enough enthusiastic
applause to shake Burn ham
Pavilion.
In many ways the Oregon and
UC-Davis dual meets stand in
direct contrast. Thursday wit
nessed several close Cardinal
matches which were lost only by
a point or two while the
wrestlers won many close
matches Saturday. Coach Chris
Horpel attributes his squad's
inspiration to team leadership
and collective responsibility.
"Scott Chapman ran part of
the practice on Friday and
helped keep the intensity up," he
said. "Our team spirit was pretty
big before the match, but it real
ly came down to collective
responsibility and who's taking
it to who. We haven't lost to
Davis in 20 years, and we
weren't about to."
Aggie head coach Mike Birch
also commented on Stanford's
readiness. "When it came down
to it, almost all of the matches
were close," Birch said. "The
turning point in this dual was in
the intensity and preparation of
both teams, and (Horpel's) team
had more if it than we did."
Kicking off the Cardinal ram
page was 118-pound wrestler
Ruiz. He set the pace for the
team through his aggressive
wrestling and impressive
throws, which also solicited

strong support from the fans.
Coming off a heartbreaking 2-1
loss against Oregon, Ruiz felt he
had something to prove.
"With Oregon behind me, I
was motivated to wrestle aggres
sively and worry less about tak
ing chances," Ruiz said. "Lots of
times our team has been missing
aggressiveness and when we put
it in, everything starts to go
awry. (Saturday) I felt that our
technique was more solid â€” we
we're aggressive but still wres
tled smart."
Zimmerer followed Ruiz's
lead, dominating his opponent
with vice-like head locks and
shucks to a 8-2 victory which far
overshadowed his painfully close
6-5 loss against Oregon. But per
haps the most exciting match of
the night belonged to 134-pound
junior Robert Hatta, fresh back
from an injury to his sternum.
"I haven't practiced in two
weeks so my physical condition
isn't what it should be," Hatta
said. "My strategy was to wrestle
slow and save my wind whenever
1 could, and it worked." Hatta
won 4-3.
"Davis is a good yardstick for
our team to measure up against,"
Hatta said. "Like us, they get vir
tually no funding from their
school, and to beat them says
something about the strength of
our program. Against Oregon, we
lost a lot of close matches by a
point or two, but no opponents
have out-skilled us. We're far
from peaking."
Beau Weiner, the 142-pound
sophomore, took the mat next
against Davis' star wrestler Oliv
er Salud. After a controversial
call which cost Weiner two
points at the beginning of the
match, his opponent went on to
beat him 8-6.
Boasting the only pin of the
night, 150-pound wrestler
Sanchez flattened his opponent
2 minutes into the first round to
send his teammates and the
crowd almost into hysterics.
After losing to Oregon team
leader Scott Norton 6-2, Sanchez

pulled off an impressive revival.
"The loss to Oregon made us
wake up and realize that we need
to win close matches," Sanchez
said. "I hope we can carry that
spirit on next week against Cal
Poly."
In another close heartbreak -
er, Jeff Grant lost 6-5 in the last
few seconds in the 150-pound
match. Against Oregon, Grant
had one of the few Cardinal wins
of the night, winning by a score
of 6-5.
Threatening to break his
opponents' arm with his arm
bars, Stanford team leader
Chapman continued his winning
streak in the 167-pound weight
class, posting a 9-2 score. Sever
al times Chapman held his oppo
nent in cradle-pinning combina
tions, but his flopping opponent
proved too flimsy to be pinned.
Gladden also had a winning
night at 177 pounds, grappling
in close with fast singles and the
patented "secret move" to beat
his opponent 8-6. Gladden was
upset against Oregon 4-2.
At 190 pounds, freshman Tim
Kendall replaced senior Brian
Vaniman, who will be out of the
lineup until the Pacific 10 Con
ference tournament with a bro
ken hand. Usually a 177-pound
wrestler, Kendall fought
through a 13-pound weight dis
advantage to win his match 12-6.
Kendall lost a close match
against Oregon 6-5.
"I am giving up the weight,
but I can feel the extra quick
ness," Kendall said. "It's intimi
dating to wrestle up a weight,
but it's also a great opportunity
to be thrown into the lineup."
Capping the night off, the
heavyweight match proved to
leave the crowd asking for more,
with a series of floor-shaking
slams. Junior Chris Serjak lost
his match 6-3 after losing to Ore
gon as well 11-4.
"Next week, Cal Poly will be
on the same level as Oregon,"
Horpel said. "How we do against
them will be a product of how
much we learn next week."
