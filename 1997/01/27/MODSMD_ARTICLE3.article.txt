# Major restructuring in the works for CIV
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
CIV in its current form is end
ing.
Years of student dissatisfaction
have motivated a close look at the
Cultures, Ideas and Values Pro
gram, and as a result of the find
ings, the CIV Design and Review
Committee has decided to recom
mend a change.
The new program, if approved
the Faculty Senate, will remain
three quarters. However, CIV will
be taught in a one quarter-two
quarter sequence.
Proposed changes
The first quarter, titled "Intro
duction to the Humanities," will
be team-taught and will examine
only three to five texts, each in
great depth. The second quarter
will be a truncated version of the
current CIV program.
The CIV Review and Design
Committee, chaired by English
Prof. Robert Polhemus, has pro
posed that the first quarter consist
of only three tracks, with about
500 people in each. Students will
examine the work through differ
ent disciplines. Teams of profes
sors will develop a lecture series
based on at least three different
view points — such as historical,
literary and philosophical perspec
tives.
Lectures will occur at most
twice a week, and there will be at
least three hours of discussion sec
tions.
Section size will be reduced

from 18 or more to a maximum of
15 students.
The second and third quarters
of the program will be similar to
the current CIV tracks, and stu
dents will choose the track that
they wish to join in the fall quarter.
Some tracks will remain in similar
style to their current form, but
new tracks may be organized along
interdisciplinary, thematic lines —
for example, love or revolution.
The professor teams may also
choose to create tracks that are dis
cipline-oriented, like art history or
East Asian studies.
Section leaders in both the first
quarter of "Introduction to the
Humanities" and in the second
two quarters will continue to be
postdoctoral fellows who are hired
for the entire year. The CIV com
mittee has recommended an up
grade of the status of the leaders to
three-year, term-limited assistant
professors.
Motivations for change
The motivation for these
changes to CIV originated in the
proposals of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education in Oc
tober 1994, which created the CIV
Review and Design Committee to
examine the program. The com
mittee of 15 faculty and staff mem
bers, plus two students, began
work in October 1995 reviewing
the program.
The CIV committee surveyed
graduating seniors to explore stu
dent concerns. Fewer than half of
