# Major restructuring in the works for CIV
## 
### Carolyn Sleeth Staff writer 
CIV in its current form is end
ing.
Years of student dissatisfaction
have motivated a close look at the
Cultures, Ideas and Values Pro
gram, and as a result of the find
ings, the CIV Design and Review
Committee has decided to recom
mend a change.
The new program, if approved
the Faculty Senate, will remain
three quarters. However, CIV will
be taught in a one quarter-two
quarter sequence.
Proposed changes
The first quarter, titled "Intro
duction to the Humanities," will
be team-taught and will examine
only three to five texts, each in
great depth. The second quarter
will be a truncated version of the
current CIV program.
The CIV Review and Design
Committee, chaired by English
Prof. Robert Polhemus, has pro
posed that the first quarter consist
of only three tracks, with about
500 people in each. Students will
examine the work through differ
ent disciplines. Teams of profes
sors will develop a lecture series
based on at least three different
view points — such as historical,
literary and philosophical perspec
tives.
Lectures will occur at most
twice a week, and there will be at
least three hours of discussion sec
tions.
Section size will be reduced

from 18 or more to a maximum of
15 students.
The second and third quarters
of the program will be similar to
the current CIV tracks, and stu
dents will choose the track that
they wish to join in the fall quarter.
Some tracks will remain in similar
style to their current form, but
new tracks may be organized along
interdisciplinary, thematic lines —
for example, love or revolution.
The professor teams may also
choose to create tracks that are dis
cipline-oriented, like art history or
East Asian studies.
Section leaders in both the first
quarter of "Introduction to the
Humanities" and in the second
two quarters will continue to be
postdoctoral fellows who are hired
for the entire year. The CIV com
mittee has recommended an up
grade of the status of the leaders to
three-year, term-limited assistant
professors.
Motivations for change
The motivation for these
changes to CIV originated in the
proposals of the Commission on
Undergraduate Education in Oc
tober 1994, which created the CIV
Review and Design Committee to
examine the program. The com
mittee of 15 faculty and staff mem
bers, plus two students, began
work in October 1995 reviewing
the program.
The CIV committee surveyed
graduating seniors to explore stu
dent concerns. Fewer than half of
the students surveyed felt CIV had
"even moderate value," Polhemus
said. These students felt problems
existed because of too many texts,
tokenism, checklist pedagogy, not
enough student choice and not
enough discussion. Students also
complained there was not enough
commonality among the texts,
while others said there was not
enough diversity.
"Students are always going to
have some degree of unhappiness
with something that is required,"
History Prof. Carolyn Lougee
Chapell said. "But generations
change, and at different times, stu
dent bodies need different things."
Lougee Chapell said during the
19705, when a Western civilization
requirement was first implement
ed, students were actually pushing
for the addition of a cultures core
requirement. Now, Lougee
Chapell said she hears a lot of crit
icism about the CIV requirement.
She added that an ideal CIV would
be one that allowed professors
more flexibility to change their
own courses.
"We need to ask what is com
pelling to students right now and
how can we better help students
understand the culture in which
they live," said Lougee Chapell.
"What is our world and what are
our historical roots?"
The CIV committee's recom
mendations have been drawn up to
combat these problems, Polhemus
said, adding that looking at fewer
texts in more depth and creating
smaller sections will really change
the nature of CIV.
Faculty fears
CIV faculty, however, are anx
ious about the changes. History
Prof. Paul Seaver, who has chaired
CIV for the last eight years, said he
is concerned that in the new one
quarter-two quarter sequence,
there will be a loss of ability to talk
over a longer period of time about
cultural evolution and sense of
chronological succession.
Seaver believes truncation of
the current three-quarter tracks
into two quarters can only harm
the program.
"Even now, we are only skim
ming the surface," Seaver said.
"By limiting the number of texts,
we decrease the diversity of expo

sure even further."
Lougee Chapell said she thinks
the proposed noncontinuous
structure is too disruptive for
freshmen "Freshmen are trying
for stability — it is the key to the
undergraduate experience," she
said.
Polhemus said there are posi
tive aspects of the change in se
quence, however. Currently,
freshmen choose their CIV track
in the summer before they come to
campus, without meeting faculty
or getting a sense for departments.
Now, students can choose their
track after getting to campus.
Also, with the smaller struc
ture, participation in the program
may open up to more departments.
Some departments that didn't
have a professor to spare for three
quarters may be able to give one up
for two quarters.
Faculty ignored?
There are other concerns, how
ever. Lougee Chapell said she felt
the CUE recommendations and
the organization of the CIV com
mittee were done without the
input of the current CIV faculty.
She said when CIV professors tried
to get information about the
changes to CIV while still in the
planning stage, they were ignored.
Although the CIV committee
began meeting in October 1995,
the first meeting held with current
CIV faculty to discuss their con
cerns was a full year later. Instead
of CIV faculty and student-pro
pelled changes, the push is coming
from"the top down," Lougee
Chapell said.
"This administration wants to
do away with everything that was
in place before they came, to
makeover the University's image,"
she said.
Both Seaver and Lougee

Chapell said there was no effort on
the part of the administration to
work within the current program
to change it.
Seaver said his standing com
mittee that heads CIV was com
pletely ignored during the process.
His requests to have joint meet
ings of the two committees were
turned down, and he said Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation Ramon Saldivar never at
tended his committee's meetings,
although repeatedly invited.
"If you compare this process of
change to the process that de
signed the original CIV program in
1988, this is totally different,"
Seaver said. "There were open
meetings with the faculty, and all
drafts of proposals were published.
In general, now there is less debate
but also less input."
Seaver added he felt the desires
of the provost and the president
were overly influential in the pre
sent proposal.
"There was no interest on the
part of the administration to bet
ter the existing program," Seaver
said. "I don't think that CIV the
way it is (now) is broken, and they
wanted to change everything. We
haven't balanced our gains and
losses."
Saldivar said the recommenda
tions did come from the adminis
tration, but as recommendations
from CUE, they were proposals
that represented the thoughts of
representatives from the entire
faculty.
The recommendations are
causing potential problems in
other areas, as well. For example,
incorporating the writing require
ment into the new CIV program is
also causing trouble. Currently,
several CIV tracks offer sections
that incorporate the writing re
quirement.

English Prof. Rob Rebholz, di
rector of the Program in Writing
and Critical Thinking, said he also
felt left out of the process of chang
ing CIV.
"Trying to connect the writing
program to a program that totally
changes format after only one
quarter is going to be very diffi
cult," Rebholz said. He said al
though the new program helps
students look closely at texts and
adds sophistication to the reading,
a continuous, effective writing pro
gram requires more than one
quarter.
Because the writing program
was not included in the discussion
in earlier stages, it cannot be in
cluded effectively, Rebholz said,
adding that he hoped writing could
be better integrated with the
freshman seminars.
Seaver said there were a num
ber of other ways the CIV commit
tee could have made changes. He
said he wished that the examina
tion had looked at the program
through each of the existing
tracks, restructuring by dropping
the weak tracks and creating new
ones.
The CIV committee also talked
about combining the newly pro
posed freshman seminars with
CIV. While freshman seminars are
"still very active," according to
Saldivar, the committee had decid
ed not to try to work them into the
Area One requirement.
Lougee Chapell said she hoped
that because there was some
doubts surrounding the new one
quarter-two quarter sequence, the
committee would also propose to
run a pilot program before a per
manent change. She said she ap
preciated the University's effort to
build up the first two years of un
dergraduate education, but she
felt the methods being used would
not solve the problems.
