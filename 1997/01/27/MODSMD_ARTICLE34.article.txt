### David Felman Contributing writer 
Lewis H. Gann, a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution
who edited books on Africa and
Western Europe, died Jan. 17
after suffering a heart attack. He
was 72 years old.
Gann served as deputy cura
tor of the African collection from
1967 to 1993 and as curator of
the West European collection
from 1993 until his retirement in
1995.
Gann "was a pillar of scholar
ship within the Hoover Institu
tion for more than 30 years,"
Hoover Director John Raisian
said in a statement. "We will miss
his dedication to scholarship and
his wealth of knowledge."
Gann was born in Mainz, Ger
many. Duringthe Nazi period, he
and his parents emigrated from
Mainz to England.
He "represents this enor
mous, valuable influx of people
who were the intellectual exiles
of World War II," said German
Studies and Comparative Litera
ture Prof. Gerald Gillespie.
Before coming to Stanford,
Gann worked for two years as a
research officer at the Rhodes-
Livingston Institute in Northern
Rhodesia, now Zambia, with
some of the world's greatest an
thropologists.
He later returned to central
Africa as an archivist for the Fed
eration of Rhodesia and Nyasa
land.
Gann wrote many of the
guides and registers to the
records of the federation, which
The New York Times Literary
Supplement in 1960 called the
best histories written on African
countries.
Gann remained in Salisbury,
Rhodesia — now Harare, Zim
babwe — until 1964, when he ac
cepted an appointment as a re
search associate at Hoover. He
became a senior fellow in 1970.
With his colleague, Peter
Duignan, Gann authored four
books and co-authored or co-edit-

Ed nearly 40 volumes.
"His publications are so well
written, so witty," said Kathari
na Mommsen, an emeritus pro
fessor of German studies. "He
never wanted to make himself
popular. He always did the con
trary. He followed his con
science."
In their work, Gann and Duig
nan predicted the specific month
of apartheid s fall and the way in
which it fell.
"We predicted a coalition gov
ernment and the success of
blacks in gaining control of par
liament and government," Duig
nan said. "No one else predicted
this because they were convinced
that sanctions and boycotts
would bring the whites to their
knees."
Gann wasn't just a specialist
in African issues. His scholarly
work covered a wide range of top
ics, including German history,
studies of central and southern
Africa, military affairs, guerrilla
warfare, race relations, the histo
ry of Latinos in the United
States, comparative studies in
Japanese-European colonialism
and the history of colonialism in
Africa.
In 1985 Gann turned to the
study of the history of American-
European relations during and
after World War 11. He Co-au
thored three books which docu
mented and analyzed these rela
tions.
"He was the type of scholar
who wrote what he thought, even
when it was not politically favor
able," Gillespie said. "He was one
of the very learned people at
Stanford. He was an extraordi
nary scholar, an independent
thinker, forthright in what he
said."
Gann is survived by a daugh
ter, Margaret Sandvig, of Salem,
Ore.; a son, Thomas Gann, of Ar
lington, Va.; a brother, Peter
Gann, of Oxford, England; and
four grandchildren.
A memorial service will be
held in Memorial Church on a
date still to be determined.
