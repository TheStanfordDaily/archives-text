# Student OK after Mayfield accident
## 
### Shoshana Deutschkron Staff writer 
Torrential rains Saturday night contributed
to a collision on Mayfield Avenue in which a ve
hicle struck pedestrian Ama Ofosu-Barko.
According to Stanford Police Sgt. David Lee,
California Highway Patrol officers arrived at
the scene of the accident shortly after 11 p.m.
Ofosu-Barko was then transported by ambu
lance to the Valley Medical Center in San Jose.
The accident dampened the spirits of those
already soaked by rain as they left the National
Championship of A Cappella West Coast re
gionals, which was held in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um.
Just minutes before the collision, Stanford's

Talisman a cappella group had been awarded
first place in the regionals. Ofosu-Barko, a ju
nior majoring in English, was a member of Tal
isman last year.
Junior Akhi Sista, a Talisman member, said
Ofosu-Barko was treated at the hospital for a
dislocated shoulder and received stitches for
cuts on her hands.
Ofosu-Barko was discharged from the hospi
tal yesterday.
After being awarded first place, members of
Talisman hugged and cried on-stage in the au
ditorium before performing a final song to the
sell-out crowd. The song sang of strength and
praise for Jesus.
Ofosu-Barko was walking with members of
Talisman when the accident occurred. The

scene in front of Florence Moore Hall, at the in
tersection of Mayfield Avenue and Lagunita
Drive, was one of stark contrast to the joy which
had been present in the auditorium.
Traffic traveling east on Mayfield was tem
porarily blocked to facilitate the arrival of emer
gency vehicles.
With unfavorable weather conditions and an
excess of pedestrians, the collision was an un
fortunate but unsurprising occurrence to
many.
Melinda Mattes, a sophomore who drove
past the scene, said that she had trouble seeing
while driving Saturday night. "It was raining so
hard," said Mattes, "that even after I rolled
down both of my side windows, I still couldn't
see very well."
