##

Despite the upcoming changes
to the Cultures, Ideas and Values
Program, current students appear
to think highly of their CIV experi
ences.
A poll conducted by The Daily
last week found that 60 percent of
students rated their CIV track a
fourora fiveon ascaleofonetofive,
with five as excellent. Nearly 70
percent of students believed that
CIV should continue to be required.
CIV, a five-unit course that is a
requirement for freshmen and
transfer students, has long been on
object of complaint among stu
dents. A Stanford Daily poll in No
vember 1993 found that 72 percent
of students felt that CIV should be
changed in some respect.
In last week's poll, students did
not rate the quality of lectures as
high, as only 38 percent of students
gave lectures a four or a five. How
ever, 54 percent of students
thought their sections were either
good or excellent.
Despite these fairly positive re
views, only 40 percent of students
gave their CIV 7 track a four or a five
when asked how educationally ben
eficial it was or is.
Looking at CIV track-by-track,
students were generally positive
about the tracks, although some
tracks are more popular.
On the same scale, 70 percent of
students gave anthropology a four
or a five, rating it as good or excel
lent in the content of the course.
Eighty-three percent of students
rated Literature and the Arts as
also very good, and 84 percent of
students taking the Structured Lib
eral Education track of CIV rated it

as very good.
The humanities and philosophy
tracks, received 60 percent and 67
percent of high votes, respectively.
Fifty-eight percent of students
in Myth and Modernity rated it as
very good, and 53 percent rated Eu
rope and the Americas and Great
Works as very good.
Only 37 percent of students in
history CIV gave it a four or a five.
Proposals to change CIV have
ranged from combining it with the
new freshman seminar program to
redesigning and dropping the weak
er tracks.
