# Program helps EPA kids shoot for the stars
## 
### Angel Flores Contributing writer 
In the heart of East Palo Alto, where more than
half the students drop out of high school, some am
bitious youths are not only going to graduate —
they plan to go on to a four-year university.
Shoot for the Stars Inc. is helping these students.
When it was founded in 1991 by then-Stanford stu
dent Chris Bischof, the nonprofit group enrolled
seven fourth-grade boys in a program to prepare
them to break free of the conditions that hamper so
many students in the impoverished community.
The after-school program provides rigorous col
lege preparatory work for students. Five of the pro

gram's original students are now ninth-graders at
Eastside Preparatory High School, opened last fall
by Shoot for the Stars. The high school has nine stu
dents enrolled, and the program now has 51 stu
dents from grades four through eight.
"It's been tough," said Bischof, the school's di
rector. But Bischof s work has paid off. Today, the
after-school program is open to girls as well as
boys.
Until Eastside opened, the program offered only
after-school study hall sessions for boys in fourth
through eighth grades who attend regular public
schools. Because the boys don't have much home-

work assigned by their schools,
Shoot for the Stars provides addi
tional assignments that are more
challenging.
With the opening of the high
school, Shoot for the Stars stu
dents will also have a place to call
home. Currently housed in a com
munity center, the school will
soon have its own classrooms and
office space at Pulgas and Myrtle
streets.
Most of the program's volun
teers are Stanford alumni or stu
dents who teach, tutor and men
tor at the after-school study hall
sessions.
"We have a tremendous con
nection with Stanford," said
Bischof, who received a bachelor's
in history and a master's in educa
tion from Stanford in 1992 and
1993, respectively. "And we en
courage that connection."
The two teachers and five of
the six board members are Stan
ford alumni or faculty. Stanford's
Black Student Union, National
Society of Black Engineers and
Haas Center for Public Service
have also provided help.
The Shoot for the Stars pro
gram uses basketball to attract
and motivate students to do well
academically, combining the sport
with study time. Students must
complete their assignments be
fore they can play basketball.
The girls are as attracted to
playing basketball as the boys are.
"It's more popular with the

girls because they don't have
much to do," said sophomore
Stacy Green, a tutor.
Students at Eastside have a
nine-hour day. Class sizes are lim
ited to 12. During the summer,
students attend enrichment class
es, and Eastside hopes soon to
offer internships and research op
portunities.
"They are all enthusiastic and
inspired by the program and the
new school," said freshman John
Norwood, another tutor.
The opening of the school's
new site in late November added
to the excitement. The 1 1/2 acres
of land, donated anonymously,
will eventually contain two small
offices, two homes for full-time
staff members, a gym, a full-size
basketball court and a parking lot.
A house on the site will have its
bedrooms converted into offices,
and a modular unit which holds
two classrooms has been brought
onto the property.
"It's small but just enough to
have 105 students," Bischof said.
The students have proven the
program's success. With growth,
maturity and increased self-con
fidence, they have set high expec
tations for themselves and have
fulfilled those, testing higher
than other students in their dis
trict.
"It has improved my grades
and helped me learn better," said
Lamont Johnson, 12, who has
been with the program for 1 1/2
years.
Besides academic accomplish
ments, the boys' basketball team
has been successful. It has placed
in three state championship

tournaments and successfully
competed in national tourna
ments.
"We get to travel, meet new
people and learn a lot," said fresh
man Kiazi Malonga, 14. Through
the basketball team, the students
have made trips to Las Vegas,
Tennessee, Los Angeles, Florida,
Delaware and Arizona.
There are other travel opportu
nities, too. Two weeks ago Malon
ga, along with other classmates,
attended a conference in Denver
given by the National Society of
Black Engineers where he won
first place in two engineering con
tests.
Before joining the program,
students must prove their com
mitment to it. For admittance
into the high school, students
must fill out an application and
have an interview; so must their
parents.
"We look for students who
show interest and who could be
motivated to work for the ulti
mate goal of going to a four-year
college," Bischof said.
With this year the first open to
girls, the Shoot for the Stars after
school program has grown to 24
boys and 27 girls. Everyone is wel
come to participate in the pro
gram as long as rules are followed.
"We demand that they show up
and do their work," Bischof said.
Although the after-school pro
gram opens its doors to anyone,
the high school has limited class
sizes so students can receive more
attention and a more individual
ized academic challenge.
"As freshmen, the students are
getting the type of courses that

I've taught to sophomores in the
past," said Helen Kim, one of the
school's two teachers.
Freshman Liza Smith, 14,
feels that at Eastside she is get
ting a more advanced education
than she would at another district
school.
Through Shoot for the Stars,
students of this community have
formed goals. Malonga aspires to
go to a University of California
school and major in engineering.
Smith has plans to major in psy
chology at college.
Many students have formed
strong friendships through the
program, creating a family atmos
phere among students and staff.
"I think we should have more pro
grams like it," Johnson said. "We
should get the kids off the
streets."
For students in East Palo Alto,
college often is something un
known and intangible.
"Clearly there is a need for a
school like this in the communi
ty," Bischof said.
Fifty percent of black students
who enter Menlo-Atherton High
School as freshmen drop out. Sev
enty percent of black males enter
ing that institution do not gradu
ate, according to Adolescent
Counseling Services' 1994-95 An
nual Report.
Ravenswood District statistics
show that only 11 graduated out
of a class of 200 at Carlmont High
School last year.
"These statistics are really
scary," Bischof said. "But it's
been amazing in terms of all the
support we've had to help make
the school successful."

tations for themselves and have
fulfilled those, testing higher
than other students in their dis
trict.
"It has improved my grades
and helped me learn better," said
Lamont Johnson, 12, who has
been with the program for 1 1/2
years.
Besides academic accomplish
ments, the boys' basketball team
has been successful. It has placed
in three state championship

tournaments and successfully
competed in national tourna
ments.
"We get to travel, meet new
people and learn a lot," said fresh
man Kiazi Malonga, 14. Through
the basketball team, the students
have made trips to Las Vegas,
Tennessee, Los Angeles, Florida,
Delaware and Arizona.
There are other travel opportu
nities, too. Two weeks ago Malon
ga, along with other classmates,
attended a conference in Denver
given by the National Society of
Black Engineers where he won
first place in two engineering con
tests.
Before joining the program,
students must prove their com
mitment to it. For admittance
into the high school, students
must fill out an application and
have an interview; so must their
parents.
"We look for students who
show interest and who could be
motivated to work for the ulti
mate goal of going to a four-year
college," Bischof said.
With this year the first open to
girls, the Shoot for the Stars after
school program has grown to 24
boys and 27 girls. Everyone is wel
come to participate in the pro
gram as long as rules are followed.
"We demand that they show up
and do their work," Bischof said.
Although the after-school pro
gram opens its doors to anyone,
the high school has limited class
sizes so students can receive more
attention and a more individual
ized academic challenge.
"As freshmen, the students are
getting the type of courses that

I've taught to sophomores in the
past," said Helen Kim, one of the
school's two teachers.
Freshman Liza Smith, 14,
feels that at Eastside she is get
ting a more advanced education
than she would at another district
school.
Through Shoot for the Stars,
students of this community have
formed goals. Malonga aspires to
go to a University of California
school and major in engineering.
Smith has plans to major in psy
chology at college.
Many students have formed
strong friendships through the
program, creating a family atmos
phere among students and staff.
"I think we should have more pro
grams like it," Johnson said. "We
should get the kids off the
streets."
For students in East Palo Alto,
college often is something un
known and intangible.
"Clearly there is a need for a
school like this in the communi
ty," Bischof said.
Fifty percent of black students
who enter Menlo-Atherton High
School as freshmen drop out. Sev
enty percent of black males enter
ing that institution do not gradu
ate, according to Adolescent
Counseling Services' 1994-95 An
nual Report.
Ravenswood District statistics
show that only 11 graduated out
of a class of 200 at Carlmont High
School last year.
"These statistics are really
scary," Bischof said. "But it's
been amazing in terms of all the
support we've had to help make
the school successful."
