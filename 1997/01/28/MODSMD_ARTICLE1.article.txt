# ASSU will open responsible fund
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
The ASSU will maintain a pri
vate, socially responsible endow
ment fund until the University
complies with a number of de
mands, ASSU President Bill Shen
and Vice President Nick Thomp
son announced yesterday.
Progressive Asset Management,
a San Francisco-based socially re
sponsible investment firm, will
oversee the fund. The firm will re
ceive an undetermined percentage
of all donations as commissions. A
student committee will also moni
tor the fund.
Shen and Thompson's original
proposal for the fund was rejected
three weeks ago by the Special
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility, a committee of the Board of
Trustees. The committee decided
not to recommend the proposed
fund to the full board or to Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper.
According to Thompson and
Shen, the sudden rejection of the
proposed fund is indicative of the
lack of communication between
the University and students and of
the University's overall neglect of
student concerns.
"This issue embodies the prob
lems with the University," Shen
said. "The manner in which the
University engages student ideas is
disgraceful. This is where most of
the motivation for the campaign is
coming from. We're fed up with the
lack of University response."
According to Thompson, "Uni
versity channels have been shut off
to students for too long."

Shen and Thompson hope that
this move — part of the larger
"University for Students" cam
paign announced Jan. 13 — will
open "serious negotiation" with
the University, Shen said. In addi
tion to opening the fund, the ASSU
executive branch is asking the Uni
versity to take social responsibility
seriously and provide "a channel
available to students by which they
can be taken seriously."
Specifically, Thompson hopes
students will be able to serve on the
SCIR and play a greater decision
making role on the Board of
Trustees.
Once the conditions are met the
fund will be discontinued, and all
its money will be given to the Stan
ford Fund, according to Thomp
son, who said the new fund is not
meant to compete with the Stan
ford Fund.
"We hope that this will be over
in a week, but we are willing to go
for the long term," Thompson said.
"Casper is a reasonable person, and
these are reasonable concerns.
"To know and be assured that
[students] are being taken serious
ly would be enough," Thompson
said.
According to Linda Kimball, a
staff member for both the SCIR
and the University's Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsibili
ty—a group made up of faculty,
staff and students which advises
the SCIR — Shen and Thompson
have failed to address several of the
SCIR's reasons for rejecting the
fund.
"Many of the SCIR's concerns
were very in-depth and haven't
been responded to yet," Kimball
said.
According to Kimball, 48 per
cent of the companies in which the
University invests are considered
socially responsible according to
the standards of the Domini Social
Equity Fund.

"The SCIR response was thor
ough. There were several levels of
discussion for over two months,"
Kimball said. "Student response
has been too quick."
Response to the new campaign
has been overwhelming so far,
Shen said. Seven hundred students
have signed postcards to be sent to
Casper supporting the fund, and
more than 50 students and alumni
already have donated to the fund,
Thompson said. Thompson added
that an alumnus has agreed to
match all gifts given to the socially

responsible fund.
"There is a strong body of evi
dence showing that you can beat
the economic benchmark by using
screened funds," said Conrad
MacKerrom, director of social re
search for Progressive Asset Man
agement. "The argument that so
cially responsible funds risk small
market returns is not a valid case
anymore."
Terry Shepard, director of Uni
versity Communications, said that
the University has "no reaction to
[the fund] at this point."
