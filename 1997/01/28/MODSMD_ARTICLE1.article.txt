# ASSU will open responsible fund
## 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
The ASSU will maintain a pri
vate, socially responsible endow
ment fund until the University
complies with a number of de
mands, ASSU President Bill Shen
and Vice President Nick Thomp
son announced yesterday.
Progressive Asset Management,
a San Francisco-based socially re
sponsible investment firm, will
oversee the fund. The firm will re
ceive an undetermined percentage
of all donations as commissions. A
student committee will also moni
tor the fund.
Shen and Thompson's original
proposal for the fund was rejected
three weeks ago by the Special
Committee on Investment Respon
sibility, a committee of the Board of
Trustees. The committee decided
not to recommend the proposed
fund to the full board or to Univer
sity President Gerhard Casper.
According to Thompson and
Shen, the sudden rejection of the
proposed fund is indicative of the
lack of communication between
the University and students and of
the University's overall neglect of
student concerns.
"This issue embodies the prob
lems with the University," Shen
said. "The manner in which the
University engages student ideas is
disgraceful. This is where most of
the motivation for the campaign is
coming from. We're fed up with the
lack of University response."
According to Thompson, "Uni
versity channels have been shut off
to students for too long."

Shen and Thompson hope that
this move — part of the larger
"University for Students" cam
paign announced Jan. 13 — will
open "serious negotiation" with
the University, Shen said. In addi
tion to opening the fund, the ASSU
executive branch is asking the Uni
versity to take social responsibility
seriously and provide "a channel
available to students by which they
can be taken seriously."
Specifically, Thompson hopes
students will be able to serve on the
SCIR and play a greater decision
making role on the Board of
Trustees.
Once the conditions are met the
fund will be discontinued, and all
its money will be given to the Stan
ford Fund, according to Thomp
son, who said the new fund is not
meant to compete with the Stan
ford Fund.
"We hope that this will be over
in a week, but we are willing to go
for the long term," Thompson said.
"Casper is a reasonable person, and
these are reasonable concerns.
"To know and be assured that
[students] are being taken serious
ly would be enough," Thompson
said.
According to Linda Kimball, a
staff member for both the SCIR
and the University's Advisory
Panel on Investment Responsibili
ty—a group made up of faculty,
staff and students which advises
the SCIR — Shen and Thompson
have failed to address several of the
SCIR's reasons for rejecting the
fund.
