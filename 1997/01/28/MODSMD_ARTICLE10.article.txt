# South African activist's death revisited

JOHANNESBURG, South
Africa (AP) â€” Five former police
officers plan to seek amnesty for
the 1977 killing of activist Steve
Biko, whose death galvanized
apartheid's opponents and exposed
to the world the brutality of the
white-led government.
The officers will petition South
Africa's Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, the panel led by
retired Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu and charged with
investigating apartheid-era crimes.
Reports that five men planned
to file an amnesty petition were
published yesterday in The Port
Elizabeth Herald. Truth Commis

sion spokeswoman Christelle Ter
reblanche confirmed that the panel
was expecting amnesty applica
tions related to Biko's death.
A source close to the five men,
speaking on condition of anonymi
ty, told The Associated Press that
the amnesty applications would
assert that Biko was "handled
robustly" but that there never was
any intention to kill him.
The Herald identified the for
mer officers as Col. Harold Sny
man, who led the team that inter
rogated Biko; Lt. Col. Gideon
Niewoudt, a detective sergeant at
the time; Ruben Marx, a warrant
officer; Daantjie Siebert, a captain;

and Johan Beneke, a warrant offi
cer.
Biko, 30, died on Sept. 12, 1977.
He had been arrested and appar
ently beaten in Port Elizabeth on
the Indian Ocean coast. Denied
medical attention, he was driven in
the back of a police van nearly 700
miles to Pretoria, where he died in
prison. At the time, police denied
beating him.
The charismatic black leader
developed a wide following during
the early 19705, urging South
African blacks to take pride in their
culture and to fight for control of
their country.
The white government labeled

him a terrorist.
At his funeral, pictures of his
battered body were widely dis
tributed and later published
around the world. He came to sym
bolize the victims of apartheid bru
tality.
"He was very broad-minded and
working to unify all the black orga
nizations," said Donald Woods, a
white former newspaper editor
whose friendship with Biko was
depicted in the 1987 British film
"Cry Freedom."
"It was a great tragedy that he
was killed, but his death had enor
mous impact overseas," Woods
said.
