# Millions aren't enough for garbage man
## N.Y. trash collector still at work after winning $10 million lottery jackpot 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Even with
his $10 million jackpot, Sergio
Martini is still doing a job some
people wouldn't do for a million
bucks.
"I'm not the kind of guy to stay
home and do nothing," the 12-year
New York City garbage man said
yesterday, working hatless in 15-
degree wind chill during a shift
that started at midnight.
"I feel more energetic now since
winning," Martini added, tapping

dripping coffee cups out of the bot
tom of a litter basket. "I only have
to work one job now."
The 50-year-old father of four
won a $10.3 million Powerball lot
tery jackpot on Thursday. He will
get about $370,000 a year for 20
years.
Up until last week, Martini had
worked double shifts for the city
Sanitation Department and drove
his brother's taxi to pay the bills.
He quit the taxi job a day after win

ning the lottery.
But Martini, who according to
the city makes a base salary of
about $40,000 and a total of
around $70,000 with overtime,
insisted he will stay on the garbage
beat for at least 2 1/2 more years to
qualify for his pension.
In the meantime, he said, "I've
got to find a hobby or something."
Martini's beat includes some of
the most stylish neighborhoods of
his native Manhattan but still is

dangerous. There are rats, chemi
cals, toxins, needles — name tht
nastiness of New York City, anc
Martini's handled it.
Four New York City sanitatior
workers have been killed on the jot
since 1992.
Along Martini's roi e, Marinoi
Franziskos, manager 112 the Times
Square Deli on 43r<' Street, said
"The guy makes $10 million and ht
still wants to work? That's beauti
fuL"
