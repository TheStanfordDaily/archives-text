# Democracy arrives in Chechnya
## Elections dominated by separatists amid secession talk 
### 
GROZNY, Russia (AP) - Barely
two years after Russia poured
troops into this tiny Muslim repub
lic, Chechens voted triumphantly
yesterday in elections dominated by
the separatist leaders Moscow tried
so hard to subdue.
The separatists have been run
ning the southern republic since
the war ended in August, and many
residents saw the presidential and
parliamentary elections as laying
the groundwork for full indepen
dence from Moscow.
But Russia has vowed to prevent
Chechnya from seceding, and the
two sides appear headed for
renewed confrontation if the
Chechens move to cut all ties with
Moscow, as they are almost certain
to do.
After the disastrous military
campaign, Russia has no appetite
for more fighting but it will tiy to
put political, economic and diplo
matic pressure on Chechnya to
keep it in line.
Chechens were in a buoyant
mood ns they headed to the polls in
snow-covered towns and villages.
"This election is about our free

dom," said Hassan Khalidov, a for
mer businessman who served as a
rebel fighter in Chechnya's war
against Russia. "The Chechen peo
ple have waited hundreds of years
for this."
Turnout was heavy at 450
polling stations across the republic,
with lines of people forming well
before some stations opened. Polls
were kept open an extra two hours
to handle the crush before closing
late last night.
Preliminary results from the
presidential race are expected
today. If no one gets 50 percent of
the vote, a runoff vote will be held
in February, though no date has
been set. About 400,000 Chechens
were eligible to vote.
Chechnya's Central Election
Commission declared the vote valid
when the turnout topped the
required 50 percent and stood at
55.7 percent by late evening, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
At the No. 12 polling station in
the bombed-out center of Grozny,
the capital, the facade of the three
story building was pocked with bul
lets and the top two floors were

charred by fire.
But the ground floor was packed
with voters and election officials,
and outside was the Chechen (lag, a
green banner with a black wolf in
the center.
Security was tight as soldiers
with automatic rifles guarded the
polling stations and told young men
with guns to leave their weapons
outside. But the atmosphere was
relaxed and there were no reports
of trouble.
All of the leading Chechen candi
dates are heroes of the guerrilla war
and favor independence for Chech
nya despite its small size. Chechnya
had only 1.2 million people before
the war and has even fewer now.
"People are very tired of war,"
Asian Maskhadov, the front-runner
in the presidential race, said after
voting yesterday. "If people place
their trust in me, we will have a
chance of a better future."
Maskhadov, the former rebel
chief of staff who negotiated the
peace deal with Russia in August, is
considered a moderate. But like all
top Chechen leaders, he want* to
cut ties with Russia.
