# Ambassador's remarks anger Jewish groups
## Swiss diplomat voluntarily resigns 
### 
BERN, Switzerland (AP) â€”
Switzerland's ambassador to the
United States resigned yesterday
after outraging Jewish groups and
their supporters by likening his
country's Nazi gold crisis to a war
that had to be won.
Carlo Jagmetti described alle
gations from Jewish groups and
U.S. politicians that Swiss banks
profited from World War II as a
"war" Switzerland must "fight
and win on two fronts: foreign and
domestic."
In a confidential report, he also
spoke of "opponents" who "cannot
be trusted."
The report, sent to Switzerland
in December, was leaked Sunday
by a Swiss newspaper that said the
"opponents" referred to Jewish
organizations and U.S. Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
Jagmetti's remarks prompted
protests inside and outside
Switzerland. Israel's Jewish Agen
cy called for an immediate apology
from Switzerland. D'Amato had
said he was shocked by the ambas
sador's choice of words and Swiss
based Jewish groups demanded
Jagmetti's immediate suspension.
D'Amato welcomed Jagmetti's
resignation, saying "We have
heard this language and sentiment
all too often in the not too distant
past. It is frightening."
Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio
Cotti said the 65-year-old ambas
sador's decision to resign was his
own and had not been forced by
the government.
While distancing the govern
ment from the ambassador's lan

guage, he said he regretted that "i
truly successful and conscientiou:
diplomatic career should end 11
such a way only a few month
before planned retirement."
Jagmetti was due to retire ii
July after 35 years of service. 1
lawyer, he has served in impor
tant Swiss embassies, includin
Rome, London and Brussels
Before arriving in Washington i:
1993, he was ambassador t
France.
Jewish groups have accuse
Switzerland of holding up to $
billion of gold and valuable
belonging to Jews who perished i.
the Holocaust. Switzerland say
the real figure is a tiny fraction c
that.
They also claim that Swis
banks profited from the war b
acting as Hitler's banker, launder
ing gold looted from the centra
banks of occupied countries.
The international row, brewini
over the last few months, ha
rocked the tiny Alpine nation
which prided itself on its neutrali
ty.
Avraham Burg, chairman o
the Jewish Agency, welcomed Jag
metti's resignation as "appropri
ate."
"By resigning, the Swis
ambassador saved the honor o
Swiss diplomacy," he said. "Any
one who fights the Jewish peopl
today will find himself facing th
Jewish organizations and leader
who will respond in kind.
"Verbal violence leads to incite
ment, racism and murder. We wi:
excise it from its roots."
