Floods plague San Jose, again
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — An overflowing creek near downtown
kept scores of people from their homes yesterday as storm-related
troubles continued to plague Northern California.
But the region was likely to get a break as forecasters called for
an extended dry period beginning midweek.
The swollen Coyote Creek, which runs through San Jose, over
flowed its bank late Sunday night about a mile south of downtown,
forcing about 200 people to evacuate. More than three dozen sought
shelter at a nearby Red Cross shelter, where they were expected to
remain last night.
"The water is receding so (evacuees* may be able to get back into
their homes and get belongings. But they may not want to live there
tonight — it may not be safe," said Lindsey Wolf, a city spokeswoman.
No itsy-bitsy spider here!
PAWTUCKET, R.I. < AP) — Parents who worry their toddlers are
picking up germs when they pick up their play things have a new
weapon: Hasbro's Playskool division yesterday introduced 15
antibacterial toys.
"Toys are hugged, they're loved, they're chewed on and drooled
on," said Anna Dooley, vice president of marketing for Playskool.
"But they also roll all over the floor. The dog may take an interest in
them. They get passed from one child to another."
The company said it was encouraged by the reaction to the
antibacterial 1-2-3 High Chair it introduced last May. The tray is
treated with a process called Microban, which permanently bonds
germ-killing pellets to plastic or fiber.
Hasbro officials said it stops mold, mildew, fungi and a range of
bacteria that can cause sore throats, skin infections and stomach ail
ments.
Treated toys include the Roll 'n' Rattle Ball, Busy Band Walker
and an activity toy shaped like a cellular telephone.
