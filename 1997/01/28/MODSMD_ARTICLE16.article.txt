## Editorial A 						little competition 
### 
Bon Appetit's sales down,
but with improvements,
things are looking up
AS THE OLD saying goes,
when the going gets tough,
the tough get going. We can
only hope that Bon Appetit —
Tresidder Union's largest food
vendor — uses this as its mantra,
as well.
Bon Appetit, which runs the
Corner Pocket, Coffee House, the
Cafe, Baker Street and a catering
service, has recently been met with
some formidable competition in
the form of Polio Rey. As a result,
Bon Appetit has suffered a sales
decrease of about 20 percent com
pared to this time in previous
years.
Some might ask why Tresidder
is competing with itself. Both the
Coffee House and a section of the
Cafe offer a fairly large variety of
Mexican food, which obviously now
competes with Polio's. The addition
of Jamba Juice planned for March
will clearly mean lowered smoothie
sales at the Corner Pocket.
Perhaps more serious, though, is
the remaining 2,900 square feet of
empty space in Tresidder. One
would be fairly hard-pressed to
think of a food vendor that would
not compete with any part of Bon
Appetit. If the increasingly popular
Noah's Bagels or Starbucks fill the
space, as some students hope, the
Coffee House would surely face
financial trouble. Another viable
option for the empty space is a pizza
vendor, which would mean direct
competition for the Corner Pocket.
In this instance, though, the
addition of competition in Tresid
der is positive. Bon Appetit has, in
actuality, had a monopoly on
Tresidder food for many years.
Granted, the food vendor has not
acted like the stereotypical price
inflating, bottom-line-minded
monopoly. It has consistently
worked to improve its relations
with Stanford staff and students

by offering specials and keeping
prices fairly consistent. Perhaps
more importantly, though, Bon
Appetit has offered many jobs to
Stanford students and has consis
tently given them fairly regular
hours. But even if Bon Appetit is
not a "bad" monopoly, if competi
tion makes it improve its services,
the Stanford community should be
thankful.
Unfortunately, Bon Appetit has
had to stop serving dinner at the
Cafe, but other changes which
have already been made or are cur
rently in the works are very posi
tive.
Last September, the Cafe was
completely remodeled, with the
addition of improved lighting for
studying. A section of the Cafe
called "The Pacific Rim," which
serves Asian food, has also been
added. The Coffee House has also
received new lighting and furni
ture and is currently implementing
a new menu, including a new late
night menu and gourmet pizza
cooked to order.
Bon Appetit is also planning a
jukebox upgrade and a renovation
of the infrastructure and entrance
of the Coffee House. The food ven
dor is also working on a new
gourmet pizza menu for the Cor
ner Pocket, which will be imple
mented in February. AJI of this can
only come as good news to the
Stanford community.
The subject of monopolies has
been a hot debate on the Stanford
campus lately, especially with the
new students' organization, Stop
Monopolies on Campus, working to
mitigate the power of the Stanford
Bookstore. SMOC's book buy-back
program, which competed with the
Bookstore's program, was met
with open arms by students.
Though some would argue that
Bon Appetit was a more benign
monopoly than the Bookstore, we
should welcome competition for
the food vendor, as well.
Competition means a better
product for students — as seems to
be the case with Bon Appetit. That
should be the bottom line.
