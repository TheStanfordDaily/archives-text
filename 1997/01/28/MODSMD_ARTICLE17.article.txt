Ujamaa's role is not to act as 'safe haven 9 for all blacks

AS A BLACK Northern female, I
don't pretend to consider myself
an expert on the black communi
ty at Stanford. So Meredith McMorrow
and I are very much alike in this
instance.
However, I disagree with everything
else she had to say in her brief, unsolicit
ed, opinionated letter in Thursday's
Daily.
I have lived in Ujamaa for three out
of my four years at Stanford. I have
been very involved in house activities
during this period, and I know almost
everyone who has lived there during the
time I've been at Stanford. Strangely

enough, I have yet to meet up with the
alienation, negativity, rejection and divi
sion McMorrow describes with such
vivid detail.
Oops . . . the word "detail" implies
experience, doesn't it?
Ujamaa is an African-American
theme dorm, devoted to the fostering of
the culture and history of African Amer
icans. Ujamaa is not a safe haven for
every brown-toned person in the Stan
ford community.
And it is definitely not the responsi
bility of Ujamaa-ites to welcome with
open arms every black Stanford student
regardless of philosophy, attitude and

community involvement. The black
people that are hollerin' that Ujamaa is
a den of "hostility and degradation" are
the same ones that I've never seen at
BSU or SBSE meetings (and if you don't
know what these acronyms stand for,
you're either not black or one of the
aforementioned), working on a paper in
the Black House or showing up at a
Kwanzaa or Diaspora celebration. As is
stated in my house's creed, "Ujamaa, in
Swahili, means collective economics,
people bringing their resources together
for the community." Community is an
all-encompassing term, with several dif
ferent facets and aspects. However, it is

illogical to assume that you can immedi
ately be accepted into one aspect while
not participating in any of them.
I could thank you, McMorrow, for
expressing your individual opinion of the
situation of the black community at
Stanford.
But I think I speak for the majority of
the residents of Ujamaa when I say keep
your uninformed opinions to yourself.
And by the way, please tell the face
less, spineless black students you quoted
to come forward and express their opin
ions on their own.
