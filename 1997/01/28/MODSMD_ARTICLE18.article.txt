# Students call for boycott of Tresidder Express
## 
### 
We are calling for a campus-wide boy
cott of Tresidder Express until it agrees to
stop selling Pepsico and Frito Lay prod
ucts.
Last Thursday we met with Ken
Shark, director of operations, and Peggy
Mendelson, president and chief executive
officer of the Bookstore, which owns
Tresidder Express. We asked them to join
the national boycott of Pepsico and its
subsidiaries, which aims to force Pepsico
to pull out of Burma. The pullout is cru
cial because by doing business in Burma,
multinational corporations like Pepsico
are supporting as well as profiting from
the SLORC's inhumane, illegitimate mili
tary regime.
Mendelsson responded that they want
ed to "stay as neutral as we can with poli
tics ... [becausel as a retailer it is not our
place ... to make moral decisions." This
stance demonstrates a fundamental error
in logic. When one faces a situation with

only two options, it is impossible to be
"neutral." The Bookstore has a choice of
either supporting Pepsico's actions in
Burma by purchasing and reselling their
products in Tresidder Express or not. And
that choice is felt daily by millions of
Burmese.
We are not interested in superficial and
evasive solutions, such as the taste tests
between Doritos and Granny Goose chips
Mendelson suggested we hold. The issue
is a moral, not gustatory, one. The
attempt to compartmentalize ethics and
money is a categorical mistake. It is this
same faulty assumption that is behind
University President Gerhard Casper's
refusal to work toward establishing a
socially responsible endowment fund. And
it is this that we challenge.
Now is the time to increase the pres
sure on Pepsico and all other corporations
in Burma. Ten localities have passed
selective purchasing resolutions, and such
legislation is currently pending in Palo
Alto, Los Angeles and the state of Califor
nia. The boycott of Tresidder Express
may have some unfortunate consequences
for the Bookstore, but it is the only lan-

guage Shark and Mendelson profess to
understand. The Bookstore is not living
up to the responsibilities that come along
with being a member of the University
community, and it must.
