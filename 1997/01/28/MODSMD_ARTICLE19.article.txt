# Murdock was wrong to prejudge Eric Jackson

### 
At best, many of Eric Jackson's polit
ical views give me major gastrointesti
nal difficulties. The newspaper he edit
ed last year, The Stanford Review, is
often a bully pulpit for conservative
ideas which make me want to curl up in
the fetal position in the corner of a dark
room and cry. However, I feel that
ASSU Senator Alane Murdock's con
tention that Jackson is unfit to sit on
the ASSU Program Board is not only
unwarranted but also evidence of less
than satisfactory leadership skills.

Jackson promised the ASSU Nomi
nations Commission that he would act
in a professional manner when scruti
nizing budgets. Frankly, he should be
given the benefit of the doubt. If he
breaches this oath and performs unpro
fessionally, I am sure there are mecha
nisms in place to remove him. The knee
jerk reaction of Murdock, founded on
Jackson's editorship of The Review,
really bothers me. Can't she see beyond
his association with that newspaper no
one reads anyway? Can't she judge the
person instead of getting caught up in
petty partisanship?
Jackson lived across the hall from me
last year. I sit diametrically opposite
from him on every political issue you
can possibly imagine. I think the news
paper he edited is usually shamelessly
wrongheaded. Nevertheless, I think
Jackson is a decent, nice guy who will
provide sober, fair appraisals of budgets
presented to him. Or as the hallway
consensus was last year, he's one of the
nicest fascists any of us has ever met.
