## Why I'm not an atheist 
### 
WHEN THE TIME came for me
to choose a university, I took
the religious nature of the
school into serious consideration. Of
Georgetown, the Jesuits proclaimed: "A
fine institution my lad . . . God's choice
for you." Of Duke, they boomed: "A
very Christian environment." Of Har
vard: "Perfect for the Christian schol
ar." But when the focus turned to Stan
ford, the men in black lamented:
"Garry, they'll try and make an atheist
out of you. Don't go there! Stanford is
wrong for any God-fearing young man."
This was one time that I probably
should have listened to the Jesuits.
Atheism has made its mark on Stan
ford. How such an irrational way of
thinking can seem so conventional per
plexes me. How baffling it is to me that
any man or woman could be an atheist.
I ask atheists to consider their child
hood: When you ate too much candy,
what happened? You got a tummy ache!
And when you touched the stove, you
burnt your finger. Or better yet —
when you tried to kiss LaKeisha, she
slapped you. The point is: As children
we understand clearly the notion of
cause and effect! One action causes the
other.
Yet atheists seem to have forgotten
that the kiss caused the slap.
Atheist thinking asserts that the uni
verse came to be without a cause ... it
just happened. "One day," writes athe
ist thinker Carl Sagan (God rest his
soul), "by accident, a molecule arouse

that was able to make crude copies of
itself."
By accident, eh?
So creation is nothing more than a
mindless effect — causeless; from a
mindless nothing to a something ... a
tummy ache with no candy, a burn
without the fire, a slap and no kiss.
Perhaps we oughta slap our atheist
back into reality.
And though our atheist friends find
no difficulty accepting the universe as a
mindless, irrational effect, I find it most
bizarre that they are unwilling to haul
over their ideas to reality. This is to say
that more often the naught, atheists are
very much inclined to inquire the cause
for every end result: "Why did my Mer
cedes break down? Why aren't there
enough seats in first class? Why aren't
there any more tofu and sprouts?"
Atheists do understand cause and
effect, yet it is most bizarre that in light
of the obvious, they still deny this basic
principle by ignoring the first cause.
How convenient.
Consider the marvelous order to this
world. I remember my boyhood love for
astronomy and the idea that the planets
all dance around the sun; or reflect
upon the order that exists in the flight
of birds or even the more miraculous
process of human reproduction. Even as
I sit here slicing this apple to comple
ment my glass of blush, I am reminded
of symmetry, order — and thus divini
ty, the first cause.
But you still insist that it is evolution

in which I am in awe.
Let's say that you are right: Let's say
that all of this is a result of a mindless,
orderless, accident — some slime got
busy with some other slime and — poof!
— you have humans! If an orderless
evolution was the effect, then humanity
— a result of this mindless accident —
is also an effect without reason. Human
nature would simply be a mindless
effect caused by nothing. All of our
thoughts, actions and appetites would
be devoid of reason; our present condi
tion would embody the tummy ache
with no candy. Life would be complete
ly irrational.
Thus to deny the existence of a God
is to deny human intelligence altogeth
er.
This is why I am convinced that
there is a God — by virtue of the fact
that I am a thinking, reasoning crea
ture. If atheists wish to assert that
there is no reason in this world, that is
fine. Human nature would be vacuous.
Life would mean nothing; humanity
would be nothing. Why go on? Atheist
might as well kill themselves!
Uhh . . . maybe not.
I need some professor to write my
law school recommendations.
