# The 						Future of CIV
## Why and how CIV should give way to Introduction to the Humanities' 
### Prof. Robert Polhemus 
IS THE AREA One
curriculum, as it
is now constitut
ed, structured and
taught in the eight
different Cultures,
Ideas and Values
tracks, fulfilling the
justification for
requiring all new stu-

dents to take it for three quarters?
Our CIV Design and Review Com
mittee decided that, for this particular
institution, a year-long requirement to
study questions, texts, ideas, values and
cultures of humanity can and often
does work to foster a sense of common
academic endeavor and to achieve cru
cial educational goals.
If Stanford is to maintain its leader
ship in preserving the opportunity for a
liberal education for all undergraduates
— if it is to continue promoting the
cause of higher education as something
more than specialized knowledge and
vocational training — it had best now
maintain and even strengthen its Area
One requirement and its commitment
to humanistic inquiry.
To do that, we need to honor and
build on the manifest successes and
excellence in the current CIV program,
but we need to remedy those things

that come in for recurrent criticism in
evaluations of CIV by its students and
faculty (e.g., too many texts and goals,
checklist pedagogical tokenism each
quarter due to some micromanaging
legislation, an unclear pedagogical
rationale, not enough student choice,
too little discussion time, not enough
commonality, not enough diversity,
uneven work loads, decline over the
school year of assigned reading done).
We support the aim of the present
CIV legislation to make students aware
of the range of human experience and
cultures, but we think the Area One
requirement could be more effective
with a sharper focus and a more flexible
charter. We want to promote even more
opportunity for faculty creativity and
innovation in its courses and more
options for the students in satisfying
the requirement.
In order to clarify and implement its
goals and meet the evolving needs of
students, we propose to define Area
One as something even more inclusive
than CIV and also more manageable for
practical instruction: namely, an intro
duction to the humanities (broadly con
ceived) and inquiries into the various
nature of human beings.
Here is the essence of our general
proposal:
Stanford's revised first-year Area
One course sequence, "Introduction to

the Humanities and Inquiries into
Humanity," will require students to
study intensely — from various per
spectives in the humanities and in
important texts from different times,
cultures and places chosen and taught
by diverse spectrum of faculty members
— significant ideas, values, issues,
intellectual traditions, problems,
myths, imaginative constructs and
desires that resonate in human experi
ence and history, in our dynamic mod
ern American culture and in this aca
demic community.
That means that the requirement
will feature the study of works and sub
jects that have cultural importance by
virtue of their influence, enduring her
itage, power, relevance, representative
significance, potential to shape the
future, ability to inspire fresh scholar
ship, aesthetic appeal and / or arresting
mode of expression.
The Area One requirement shall con
sist in the first quarter of three or four
team-taught, general introduction-to
humanistic inquiry courses from
diverse perspectives centered on a
strictly limited number of texts (per
haps three to five), followed, in winter
and spring quarters, by several two
quarter track courses of more special
ized study exploring particular themes,
issues, forms of experience, modes of
expression and / or bodies of knowl

edge.
Any revised Area One requirement
should stress the need and importance
of teaching entering college students to
read complex and significant works
closely, carefully and patiently. Almost
unanimously, in the survey on CIV we
conducted of graduating seniors and in
every contact we had with students, the
gist of this remark appears: "Close
readings of texts should be further
emphasized even at the expense of the
number of texts read."
We favor for the three-quarter Area
One requirement the "one-quarter,
two-quarter" course sequence because
this structure offers common ground
ing in the practical study of the human
ities from multiple perspectives, fol
lowed by a variety of courses in major
subjects and concerns in the humani
ties. It allows the process of detailed
instruction to move from the general to
the particular and thematic. It offers
close, common focus on a few represen
tative texts, chosen from different tra
ditions, interpreted in light of key, but
different disciplinary approaches in the
humanities, e.g., aesthetic, historical
and philosophical, and then it moves to
more diversified subjects studied from
more specific approaches. Students
would be able to select courses for quar
ters two and three when they are on
campus.

The principle that guides the intro
ductory course and which we see as
basic to inquiry in the humanities is the
principle of beginning with close read
ing from various points of view and for
multiple purposes: If students can read
thoroughly, from many perspectives, a
single rich and complex work, they can
learn to do the same thing with other
texts.
Once the rationale of a "culture" or
CIV course was to read particular works
forming the core of civilization, but
with the assault on cultural parochial
ism, a better one seems a broad-gauged
study of what constitutes the humani
ties and what humanistic inquiry is.
Popular conceptions of "culture" or
"civilization" courses now suffer from
two opposite stereotypes, both ulti
mately shallow — that such a course
tends to feature the literature of an
oppressive white patriarchy ("dead
white males") or, alternatively, that
such a course should include the indis
pensable authors and texts that form
"the canon." Our committee, then, is
alive to the criticisms of our plan from
two different directions:
1) That our recommendations,
because they ma}' eschew the prescrip
tive rubrics of the 1988 legislation (Sen
ate Document 3307) and set up a set of

broadly based criteria that the
Area One requirement should
meet, might be construed as an
abandonment of the opening to
diversity and a return to a course
with a prescribed canon that sup
posedly constitutes culture; and
2) From an opposite point of
view, that in failing to prescribe
a common core of texts, we are
abandoning the heritage of the
past and the teaching of the
foundations of civilization and
culture that an educated person
needs to know.
To the first criticism, we say
that we strongly support the
opening to study cultural
breadth and a new inclusiveness
enacted in the Area One require
ment, and we can not conceive

of, and would not sanction, an
introductory course sequence in
humanistic study that didn't
include, for instance, multicul
tural perspectives, attention to
gender, race, religion, social
identities and significant texts
by women and men of various
ethnicity.
To the second objection we say
that by recommending an intro
duction to, and forms of, inquiry
into the humanities, we intend
the teaching — through repre
sentative texts and subjects,
rather than through a flurried,
doomed attempt to choose and
cover "the" great books and
"our" or "others' " cultural his
tory — of precisely the founda
tions of culture that an educated
person at the end of this century
needs; and we stress that the
wording of the legislation, the
judgment of the faculty and the
oversight of the Area One Gover

nance Committee will ensure the
study of texts of enduring
influence, power and pedagogical
relevance that help make stu
dents aware of the living past,
the force of tradition and the for
mation of general cultural her
itage. In the present stage of bur
geoning humanistic inquiry,
reducing civilization — or the
humanities — to a core list seems
both arbitrary and impossible.
It is time to redefine the heart
of an introduction-to-the
humanities, CIV-type course: It
is not a list of authors and works
that nobody can quite agree on
or "the common intellectual
experience of broadening stu
dents' understanding of culture,
cultural diversity and the pro
cess of cultural interaction"
(though it could and should fos
ter such experience), but the
study of the making and mani
fold understandings of impor

tant articulations and expres
sions, significant in the histori
cal memory that makes the
future, of what it is — and how
many ways there are — to be
human.
With regard to the specific
implementation of the program
and the legislation we are craft
ing, we propose that:
1) The best and most dynamic
teachers in the humanities con
tinue to be encouraged and
attracted to teach in the Area
One course sequences and that
even more University effort and
resources be mobilized toward
this goal. (In the first-quarter
course, the process of putting it
together would require leading
faculty from different disciplines
to discuss, agree and set up par
ticular goals for the course and
plan, articulate and exchange
ideas about how these goals
might be reached; for the next

two quarters, the University
must continue to recruit leading
faculty in several departments
or leading faculty from similar
areas of interest and expertise.)
2) Small-group instruction,
since it is so central to the pro
gram's success, must be
increased from at least two
hours per week (as is now man
dated) to at least three hours per
week, and that the size of the
sections should not exceed 15
students.
3) The discussion group lead
ers should all hold doctorates,
that their status should be
upgraded to the standing of a
three-year, term-limited assis
tant professor, with the possibil
ity of a one-year reappointment
but no more and that, following
the recommendation of the 1988
CIV legislation and the model of
some present CIV tracks; these
degree-holders, competitive in

the job market, should be highly
qualified, outstanding postdocs
identified and chosen for their
excellence, promise and produc
tive capacities in a national
search.
4) The Freshman Writing
requirement should be integrat
ed with the Area One require
ment whenever it can be done in
accordance with the positive pro
posal to the provost from the
Writing and Critical Thinking
Program for "Linking the Writ
ing Requirement with Area One
and Freshman Seminars." (We
find evidence that when both
requirements are merged the
potential academic and intellec
tual benefit for students is sub
stantially increased.)

cial educational goals.
If Stanford is to maintain its leader
ship in preserving the opportunity for a
liberal education for all undergraduates
— if it is to continue promoting the
cause of higher education as something
more than specialized knowledge and
vocational training — it had best now
maintain and even strengthen its Area
One requirement and its commitment
to humanistic inquiry.
To do that, we need to honor and
build on the manifest successes and
excellence in the current CIV program,
but we need to remedy those things

that come in for recurrent criticism in
evaluations of CIV by its students and
faculty (e.g., too many texts and goals,
checklist pedagogical tokenism each
quarter due to some micromanaging
legislation, an unclear pedagogical
rationale, not enough student choice,
too little discussion time, not enough
commonality, not enough diversity,
uneven work loads, decline over the
school year of assigned reading done).
We support the aim of the present
CIV legislation to make students aware
of the range of human experience and
cultures, but we think the Area One
requirement could be more effective
with a sharper focus and a more flexible
charter. We want to promote even more
opportunity for faculty creativity and
innovation in its courses and more
options for the students in satisfying
the requirement.
In order to clarify and implement its
goals and meet the evolving needs of
students, we propose to define Area
One as something even more inclusive
than CIV and also more manageable for
practical instruction: namely, an intro
duction to the humanities (broadly con
ceived) and inquiries into the various
nature of human beings.
Here is the essence of our general
proposal:
Stanford's revised first-year Area
One course sequence, "Introduction to

the Humanities and Inquiries into
Humanity," will require students to
study intensely — from various per
spectives in the humanities and in
important texts from different times,
cultures and places chosen and taught
by diverse spectrum of faculty members
— significant ideas, values, issues,
intellectual traditions, problems,
myths, imaginative constructs and
desires that resonate in human experi
ence and history, in our dynamic mod
ern American culture and in this aca
demic community.
That means that the requirement
will feature the study of works and sub
jects that have cultural importance by
virtue of their influence, enduring her
itage, power, relevance, representative
significance, potential to shape the
future, ability to inspire fresh scholar
ship, aesthetic appeal and / or arresting
mode of expression.
The Area One requirement shall con
sist in the first quarter of three or four
team-taught, general introduction-to
humanistic inquiry courses from
diverse perspectives centered on a
strictly limited number of texts (per
haps three to five), followed, in winter
and spring quarters, by several two
quarter track courses of more special
ized study exploring particular themes,
issues, forms of experience, modes of
expression and / or bodies of knowl

edge.
Any revised Area One requirement
should stress the need and importance
of teaching entering college students to
read complex and significant works
closely, carefully and patiently. Almost
unanimously, in the survey on CIV we
conducted of graduating seniors and in
every contact we had with students, the
gist of this remark appears: "Close
readings of texts should be further
emphasized even at the expense of the
number of texts read."
We favor for the three-quarter Area
One requirement the "one-quarter,
two-quarter" course sequence because
this structure offers common ground
ing in the practical study of the human
ities from multiple perspectives, fol
lowed by a variety of courses in major
subjects and concerns in the humani
ties. It allows the process of detailed
instruction to move from the general to
the particular and thematic. It offers
close, common focus on a few represen
tative texts, chosen from different tra
ditions, interpreted in light of key, but
different disciplinary approaches in the
humanities, e.g., aesthetic, historical
and philosophical, and then it moves to
more diversified subjects studied from
more specific approaches. Students
would be able to select courses for quar
ters two and three when they are on
campus.

The principle that guides the intro
ductory course and which we see as
basic to inquiry in the humanities is the
principle of beginning with close read
ing from various points of view and for
multiple purposes: If students can read
thoroughly, from many perspectives, a
single rich and complex work, they can
learn to do the same thing with other
texts.
Once the rationale of a "culture" or
CIV course was to read particular works
forming the core of civilization, but
with the assault on cultural parochial
ism, a better one seems a broad-gauged
study of what constitutes the humani
ties and what humanistic inquiry is.
Popular conceptions of "culture" or
"civilization" courses now suffer from
two opposite stereotypes, both ulti
mately shallow — that such a course
tends to feature the literature of an
oppressive white patriarchy ("dead
white males") or, alternatively, that
such a course should include the indis
pensable authors and texts that form
"the canon." Our committee, then, is
alive to the criticisms of our plan from
two different directions:
1) That our recommendations,
because they ma}' eschew the prescrip
tive rubrics of the 1988 legislation (Sen
ate Document 3307) and set up a set of

broadly based criteria that the
Area One requirement should
meet, might be construed as an
abandonment of the opening to
diversity and a return to a course
with a prescribed canon that sup
posedly constitutes culture; and
2) From an opposite point of
view, that in failing to prescribe
a common core of texts, we are
abandoning the heritage of the
past and the teaching of the
foundations of civilization and
culture that an educated person
needs to know.
To the first criticism, we say
that we strongly support the
opening to study cultural
breadth and a new inclusiveness
enacted in the Area One require
ment, and we can not conceive

of, and would not sanction, an
introductory course sequence in
humanistic study that didn't
include, for instance, multicul
tural perspectives, attention to
gender, race, religion, social
identities and significant texts
by women and men of various
ethnicity.
To the second objection we say
that by recommending an intro
duction to, and forms of, inquiry
into the humanities, we intend
the teaching — through repre
sentative texts and subjects,
rather than through a flurried,
doomed attempt to choose and
cover "the" great books and
"our" or "others' " cultural his
tory — of precisely the founda
tions of culture that an educated
person at the end of this century
needs; and we stress that the
wording of the legislation, the
judgment of the faculty and the
oversight of the Area One Gover

nance Committee will ensure the
study of texts of enduring
influence, power and pedagogical
relevance that help make stu
dents aware of the living past,
the force of tradition and the for
mation of general cultural her
itage. In the present stage of bur
geoning humanistic inquiry,
reducing civilization — or the
humanities — to a core list seems
both arbitrary and impossible.
It is time to redefine the heart
of an introduction-to-the
humanities, CIV-type course: It
is not a list of authors and works
that nobody can quite agree on
or "the common intellectual
experience of broadening stu
dents' understanding of culture,
cultural diversity and the pro
cess of cultural interaction"
(though it could and should fos
ter such experience), but the
study of the making and mani
fold understandings of impor

tant articulations and expres
sions, significant in the histori
cal memory that makes the
future, of what it is — and how
many ways there are — to be
human.
With regard to the specific
implementation of the program
and the legislation we are craft
ing, we propose that:
1) The best and most dynamic
teachers in the humanities con
tinue to be encouraged and
attracted to teach in the Area
One course sequences and that
even more University effort and
resources be mobilized toward
this goal. (In the first-quarter
course, the process of putting it
together would require leading
faculty from different disciplines
to discuss, agree and set up par
ticular goals for the course and
plan, articulate and exchange
ideas about how these goals
might be reached; for the next

two quarters, the University
must continue to recruit leading
faculty in several departments
or leading faculty from similar
areas of interest and expertise.)
2) Small-group instruction,
since it is so central to the pro
gram's success, must be
increased from at least two
hours per week (as is now man
dated) to at least three hours per
week, and that the size of the
sections should not exceed 15
students.
3) The discussion group lead
ers should all hold doctorates,
that their status should be
upgraded to the standing of a
three-year, term-limited assis
tant professor, with the possibil
ity of a one-year reappointment
but no more and that, following
the recommendation of the 1988
CIV legislation and the model of
some present CIV tracks; these
degree-holders, competitive in

the job market, should be highly
qualified, outstanding postdocs
identified and chosen for their
excellence, promise and produc
tive capacities in a national
search.
4) The Freshman Writing
requirement should be integrat
ed with the Area One require
ment whenever it can be done in
accordance with the positive pro
posal to the provost from the
Writing and Critical Thinking
Program for "Linking the Writ
ing Requirement with Area One
and Freshman Seminars." (We
find evidence that when both
requirements are merged the
potential academic and intellec
tual benefit for students is sub
stantially increased.)

IS THE AREA One
curriculum, as it
is now constitut
ed, structured and
taught in the eight
different Cultures,
Ideas and Values
tracks, fulfilling the
justification for
requiring all new stu-

dents to take it for three quarters?
Our CIV Design and Review Com
mittee decided that, for this particular
institution, a year-long requirement to
study questions, texts, ideas, values and
cultures of humanity can and often
does work to foster a sense of common
academic endeavor and to achieve cru
cial educational goals.
If Stanford is to maintain its leader
ship in preserving the opportunity for a
liberal education for all undergraduates
— if it is to continue promoting the
cause of higher education as something
