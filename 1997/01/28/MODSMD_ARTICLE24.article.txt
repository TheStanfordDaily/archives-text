# 'Why all the hullabaloo about this great course?'

### Prof. John Perry 
Xle v e r
say that Stan
ford doesn't
take the educa
tion of fresh
men seriously,
however inept
we may be at

actually doing it.
It is almost 20 years since the
Western Culture Task Force start
ed work. Before its creation had
lasted a decade, Cultures, Ideas
and Values had been instituted.
The Western Culture track man
dated five books a quarter for all
tracks; of the total of 15, none
were by women or minority
authors, although a number of
tracks had such works on their
reading list. CIV mandates less
than five books for the whole year,
but insists that the rest of the
reading list include some minori
ty, woman, and non-European
authors. Other than that, it's pret
ty much the same.
I served on both of those task
forces and chaired the pilot pro
gram, which recruited and built
up the various tracks and estab
lished the notorious "core list,"
from 1978-1980. I'm not a mem
ber of the current task force.
Thank God. I can barely stand to
hear the topic discussed at the
Faculty Senate. Only the fact that
I'm supposed to be writing a
review of a book by Jerry Fodor
motivates me to think and write
once again about CIV. As far as
planning and administering this
requirement, it seems to be a
perennial tarbaby, leaving every
one who gets involved with it
messed up.
Teaching it is a different mat
ter. It's fun and rewarding. I've
taught the winter quarter of
Western Culture and then CIV
for most of those years; I'm not
teaching it this year, but probably

will next year.
It all seems so simple to me.
There are so many rich, interest
ing books out there, well worth
teaching, and so much fun to
teach. Plenty of them are by dead
European males, but lots of them
are not. Think of some themes,
pick some books, read them and
read up on them, lecture, talk to
students. Let the assistants grade
the papers. Bliss
It's so great because you don't
have to be a great scholar. I read
and read up on St. Augustine,
probably the single most impor
tant figure in the history of Chris
tianity. What a thrill to be allowed
to stand in front of a class and talk
about what he had to say about
evil and the nature of time and to
recite his great prayer, "Lord, give
me chastity, but not yet." I love it.
I don't read Latin, but I think I do
a perfectly fine job of lecturing
about Augustine for a week or two
to first-year students, thank you.
People should be lining up to teach
CIV.
Why all the hullabaloo about
this great course? When we went
from Western Culture to CIV lots
of my friends moaned and groaned
about having to integrate the
female, minority and non-Euro
pean authors. One was so horri
fied by the prospect that he went
off to be president of an Eastern
institution of higher education.
But most everyone else has been
working hard to do this, recruiting
new blood to help, enjoying more
than they thought they would,
and as far as I can tell doing a pret
ty good job.
Some people complain that the
representation of women, minori
ties and non-Europeans is just
token. Give me a break. The whole
course is tokens. The philosophers
are tokens in most of the tracks,
and the poets sure are in my
course. Someone who has read a
good book by Equiano or Frederick


Douglass has just scratched the
surface; someone who has rushed
through Descartes in a week has
just scratched another surface.
The whole course is surface
scratching. The whole freshman
year is just surface scratching. It's
great to scratch all those surfaces!
The longest subway ride starts
with just a token, to coin a phrase.
Now we have another blue rib
bon committee looking at CIV.
The current president and provost
have worked hard and successfully
to deal with Stanford's financial
woes. They have broken a lot of
eggs, but an impressive omelet is
emerging. They have every right

to push the Faculty Senate to
reconsider CIV. Maybe another
great omelet will come of it.
I'm not very optimistic. I think
only some deep, irrational, unfath
omable, utterly perplexing instinct
can be responsible for their desire
to wrestle again so soon with this
tarbaby. I think the whole issue
will be in The Wall Street Journal
and all the other papers again, and
the ghosts of horses once flogged
beyond recognition will be back on
campus, and once again all the fun
will be sucked out of teaching the
damn thing. It's so depressing I'm
going to go work on that book
review.
John Perry is a philosophy profes
sor and chairman of the philoso
phy and human existence CIV
track.
