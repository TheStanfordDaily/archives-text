# New course should not replace CIV immediately

### Prof. Carolyn Lougee Chappell 
Mr*
seems, got it
right: "History
doesn't repeat
itself, but it
does rhyme."
For the third
time in 20
years, the

Stanford faculty is debating its
freshman humanities require
ment (Area One). We are not,
today, repeating what we have
done before, but their resem
blances or "rhymes," and
lessons that can be learned from
the earlier episodes can help us
come to a wise decision this time
around.
Recurring debate is — we all
understand — laudable. But it is
not necessarily a sign that the
current curriculum needs to be
replaced. The issue of Area One
won't die precisely because the
Stanford faculty cares too much
about its undergraduates' edu
cation to allow the foundational
freshman course to be anything
but the best it can field. And cer
tain problematic tendencies do
seem endemic to the current
program — Cultures, Ideas and
Values — as they did to its pre
decessor "Western Culture":
Reading assignments easily
become too much too fast, expec
tations of what the courses are
to undertake and accomplish
tend to be too numerous and dis
parate, the courses are so hard
to teach that faculty recruitment
is a perennial challenge.
That these problems have
been identified makes it the fac
ulty's responsibility to correct
them but is not in itself proof
that the flawed courses are
incorrigible.
Moreover, there are always
provocations and temptation to
break with current courses even

when they are not broken. At
Stanford, where no more than
10 percent or so of entering
freshmen indicate an interest in
studying the humanities, a year
long humanities requirement
will always generate some level
of student complaint; the diffi
cult challenge is distinguishing
accurately at any given time
between a built-in minimum of
complaint that does not in itself
indict the course and negatives
that do necessitate reform.
And finally, since there are, in
theory, dozens of different
courses that could be invented to
serve the ends for which the
requirement exists and none of
those theoretically possible
courses has yet been put to the
tests of experience that will
reveal flaws, there will always be
a temptation to think that some
where else the grass is greener
— some other course will do a
better job than the one that is
proving itself imperfect in the
classroom day after day.
The problems that took cen
ter stage in 1978 — whether to
have such a requirement at all —
and in 1987 — how to incorpo
rate a new. inclusive under
standing of "we" in a course that
had been explicitly designed to
teach about "our heritage . . .
our society" — are not those
driving the current reconsidera
tion; in terms of substance,
then, the echo or "rhyme" is but
distant. But on certain issues of
process the earlier episodes echo
with lessons we now ought to
heed.
In 1978, when a committee
charged with fashioning a new-
University requirement brought
its recommendation the Faculty
Senate, the senators were reluc
tant to buy a pig-in-a-poke; that
is, to mandate as a University
requirement courses that had
never been taught and so might
or mieht not be worthy of
