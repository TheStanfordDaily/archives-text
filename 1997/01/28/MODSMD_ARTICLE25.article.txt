# New course should not replace CIV immediately
## 
### Prof. Carolyn Lougee Chappell 
Mr*
seems, got it
right: "History
doesn't repeat
itself, but it
does rhyme."
For the third
time in 20
years, the

Stanford faculty is debating its
freshman humanities require
ment (Area One). We are not,
today, repeating what we have
done before, but their resem
blances or "rhymes," and
lessons that can be learned from
the earlier episodes can help us
come to a wise decision this time
around.
Recurring debate is — we all
understand — laudable. But it is
not necessarily a sign that the
current curriculum needs to be
replaced. The issue of Area One
won't die precisely because the
Stanford faculty cares too much
about its undergraduates' edu
cation to allow the foundational
freshman course to be anything
but the best it can field. And cer
tain problematic tendencies do
seem endemic to the current
program — Cultures, Ideas and
Values — as they did to its pre
decessor "Western Culture":
Reading assignments easily
become too much too fast, expec
tations of what the courses are
to undertake and accomplish
tend to be too numerous and dis
parate, the courses are so hard
to teach that faculty recruitment
is a perennial challenge.
That these problems have
been identified makes it the fac
ulty's responsibility to correct
them but is not in itself proof
that the flawed courses are
incorrigible.
Moreover, there are always
provocations and temptation to
break with current courses even

when they are not broken. At
Stanford, where no more than
10 percent or so of entering
freshmen indicate an interest in
studying the humanities, a year
long humanities requirement
will always generate some level
of student complaint; the diffi
cult challenge is distinguishing
accurately at any given time
between a built-in minimum of
complaint that does not in itself
indict the course and negatives
that do necessitate reform.
And finally, since there are, in
theory, dozens of different
courses that could be invented to
serve the ends for which the
requirement exists and none of
those theoretically possible
courses has yet been put to the
tests of experience that will
reveal flaws, there will always be
a temptation to think that some
where else the grass is greener
— some other course will do a
better job than the one that is
proving itself imperfect in the
classroom day after day.
The problems that took cen
ter stage in 1978 — whether to
have such a requirement at all —
and in 1987 — how to incorpo
rate a new. inclusive under
standing of "we" in a course that
had been explicitly designed to
teach about "our heritage . . .
our society" — are not those
driving the current reconsidera
tion; in terms of substance,
then, the echo or "rhyme" is but
distant. But on certain issues of
process the earlier episodes echo
with lessons we now ought to
heed.
In 1978, when a committee
charged with fashioning a new-
University requirement brought
its recommendation the Faculty
Senate, the senators were reluc
tant to buy a pig-in-a-poke; that
is, to mandate as a University
requirement courses that had
never been taught and so might
or mieht not be worthy of

requiring. Rather than immedi
ately adopting what seemed a
good idea, they set up a pilot pro
gram. The courses proposed for
the possible requirement were
taught for two years to students
who volunteered to take them
and were modified gradually as
experience showed desirable.
When the committee returned to
the senate two years later, it
could show a track record of the
courses' success, and the senate
adopted the requirement with
assurance of its appropriateness
to the students it sought to
serve.
In 1988, the task force that

set up the new CIV was con
cerned to promote experimenta
tion within the framework of
the program. One of the weak
nesses of the Western Culture
program had been a certain
resistance to innovation. And
one of the key breakthroughs
demonstrating the feasibility of
CIV was a one-quarter experi
mental course taught in 1987 by
History Prof. Clayborne Carson
that combined African-Ameri
can literature and history with
Western Culture's canonical
materials. In the end, the task
force wrote into the CIV legisla
tion a provision for future
"experimental courses" as well
as whole tracks.
The Polhemus committee is
about to propose that CIV be
replaced, beginning in 1998, by a

year-long requirement that will
combine a one-quarter "Intro
duction to the Humanities" with
a two-quarter thematic sequence.
Neither course has ever been
taught, and neither has been
worked out in the slightest intel
lectual or practical detail. In
favor of this "greener grass," the
committee will ask the senate to
jettison CIV.
Positing an either / or
between CIV and the new idea
makes the current reprise of the
Area One issue more divisive
than it needs to be. Reform does
not require choosing between
the untried brainstorm and all
that CIV has learned to do well
in its years of experience. I
would propose that, as in 1978,
we institute a pilot program for
the new idea — this time, exper

imental teaching of the "Intro
duction to Humanities." And
that we do this, as the reforms of
1988 made possible, under the
aegis of the Area One require
ment as it is currently constitut
ed.
Let us go forward with a two
pronged strategy: improving the
CIV tracks — whose flaws are
not fatal — even as we develop
new approaches to freshman
humanities that — if they do
indeed prove superior in practice
— can eventually (whether all at
once or gradually) become suc
cessor to CIV.
