# CIV needs reform, but students also need to change their tune
## 
### Alex Rayskin 
Mention civ
to a Stanford
student and,
in all probability, you'll
hear a terrible tale or
two or, at the very
least, get a dismissive
gesture of disapproval
or even disgust. The

students' opinion of Cultures, Ideas and
Val"es becomes especially clear when at
the end of a CIV final in June you can
observe numbers of elated freshmen
congratulating each other and shouting
excitedly, "No more CIV! No more CIV!"
The depravity of CIV has become so
ingrained in our campus culture that
freshmen are virtually socialized into
the idea that CIV is an ordeal to be gone
through and, with some luck, forgotten.
Thus, they start out already prejudiced
against it, complete with unfavorable
expectations and an unflattering atti
tude before their CIV classes have even
begun. For many, this inclination
defines and remains their "CIV experi
ence," only to be passed on to under
classmen several quarters later, thereby

strengthening and perpetuating the
stereotype. All of this, of course, begs
the question: Why?
Some dislike the difficult workload
required by the majority of the CIV
tracks, while others simply do not wish
to be subjected to a year-long 15-unit
requirement of any kind. Many fail to
grasp the relevance of the material cov
ered in CIV to their current and future
lives. So, why should we even have CIV?
The truth is whether we like it or
not, whether we realize it or not, we
need CIV and need it badly. This isn't
just an issue of dropping the right
names at a cocktail party 10 years from
now. CIV provides an intellectual foun
dation that unites us with humanity's
past, and despite our different back
grounds, with each other. I would even
argue that it is a prerequisite to a mean
ingful life or "a rich human experi
ence," if you will. Indeed, how can we
move forward if we don't know and
understand the past? How can we be
leaders and trailblazers if we don't
know where we come from?
There certainly have been many suc
cessful people in all realms of life who
might have gone through their lives

without having read Descartes or Dante
and still managed to excel and con
tribute significantly to their societies.
However, my point should be clear.
There must be a backbone, an intellec
tual foundation on which we can build
our skills of critical thinking and rigor
ous analysis. There must be a base from
which we can develop and pursue our
academic and, I dare say, personal inter
ests. CIV affords us the opportunity to
acquire such a foundation, and we
would be foolish not to take full advan
tage of it.
CIV is often criticized for attempt
ing to cover too much material in too
little time. This is a criticism I find
invalid. The average pace in CIV is one
book a week, which is a standard work
load for humanities courses at Stan
ford. Of course, ideally, we would like
to study the "great works" that CIV
offers in greater depth and take time to
ponder their meanings. But sometimes
quantity is better than quality. ClV's
purpose is to introduce us to some of
the great ideas of humanity and stimu
late us to learn more. If you would
have loved to spend more than just a
week on the "Divine Comedy," by all

means do so â€” you can take a course
on it. The same holds true for the vast
majority of the books on various CIV
reading lists.
It is unreasonable to demand that
CIV be everything for everyone. Instead,
we should allow it to serve as a survey
course in the masterpieces of the world
civilizations and a foundation for fur
ther studies.
CIV is by no means perfect. It's not
even close. Two of its most egregious
faults that I feel compelled to mention
are unequal workloads between tracks,
as well as sections within the same
track, and unfair grading practices. CIV
workloads vary considerably, even
between sections within the same CIV
track. It is not uncommon for one sec
tion leader to assign only part of a
required book and for another to assign
the entire book plus 100 pages of sec
ondary sources. It is simply unfair to
require some students to read twice as
much material as others.
Inaccurate grading procedures are
also a common phenomenon and are
even more detrimental to the morale of
CIV students. It is unfortunate, but
very often true, that the relationship

between work put into a CIV course and
the final grade is virtually nonexistent. I
know of many students who read all
required texts in one quarter and read
only one or two texts another quarter
and received the same grade: B+ for
both! The frequency of the B+ as a CIV
grade is at the very least suspicious,
causing many students to dub it as "the
CIV grade of choice."
Almost everyone agrees that CIV
needs reform. Some of ClV's problems
can only be solved by University admin
istrators in conjunction with track coor
dinators and section leaders themselves.
However, the core of the "CIV problem"
lies with the students. After all, we are
the ones who don't feel like reading
Descartes and struggling through Virgil .
Yet we are the same people, who on our
college applications, pledged to devote
ourselves to the pursuit of knowledge
and the "life of the mind." These con
cepts look great on paper. If we could
only make it a reality for ourselves and
for those who will come after us
