## Domination Stanford rules in Arizona pools 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
Like a juggernaut that crushes
everything in its path, the Stanford
women's swimming team rolled
into the Grand Canyon State,
pummeled the Arizona State Sun
Devils 202-96 and then moved on
to flatten the Arizona Wildcats
150-82 this past weekend.
The top-ranked Cardinal (4-0;
clinched top spots in all but two
events against the Sun Devils (6-4J
and the Wildcats (4-3). In addition,
freshman Carissa Zenorini won
the 1-meter diving competition
(283.8) at the Arizona meet.
At its first meet with the 21st
ranked Sun Devils Friday, the
Stanford swim team impressed its
opponents by setting four new pool
records at the Plummer Aquatic-
Center in Tempe, Ariz.
The Cardinal team widened the
gap early on when it secured the
top three places in the 200-yard
freestyle and 200-yard butterfly
events at the Arizona State meet.
At its second meet against the
sixth-ranked Arizona Wildcats, the
women's team posted slower
times, especially in the sprint
freestyle races. Swimmers said
they faced cold, windy weather at
the outdoor pool, which made it
difficult to keep muscles warmed
up. Cardinal teammates also cited
fatigue from traveling.
But aspects of the away game
brought comfort to one swimmer.
Maren Ewers, a freshman from
Phoenix, had a special crowd of
Stanford fans rooting for her.

Her parents, dressed in match
ing Stanford swimming sweat
shirts, attended both meets to
cheer on Ewers during her back
stroke and freestyle relay events.
"It was great having [my family]
there, but it was also embarrass
ing," Ewers said. "Every time I
looked up into the stands, my mom
was taking pictures."
Cardinal coach Richard Quick
said he was pleased with the over
all performance at both meets.
"We had some swimmers that
really stepped it up to another level
and did a good job," he said.
At the Arizona meet, junior
Amy Oberhelman swam the 1,000-
yard freestyle with the third
fastest time in women's intercolle
giate swimming this season.
Kari Edwards, who swam her
personal best in the 200-yard but
terfly (2:01.18), had an "exception
al weekend," Quick said.
Two swimmers made qualifying
marks for the NCAA at the Ari
zona State meet. Freshman
Catherine Fox, who already holds
six NCAA qualifying times, racked
her seventh this season in the 200-
yard freestyle (1:48.44). Sopho
more Eiin Austevoll shaved two
seconds from her last meet to qual
ify in the 200-yard breaststroke
(2:14.60), her season best.
In a sport, where tenths of a sec
ond can be difficult to drop,
Austevoll said focusing on her
underwater pull and turns helped
her make NCAA qualifying times.

all-time best record in the 200-yard
breaststroke this season, she said
she feels confident she will drop at
least two more seconds in upcom
ing meets.
Quick has stressed more
emphasis on specific techniques
like off-the-wall dolphin kicks,
turns and enhanced peak perfor
mances during practice to encour
age his swimmers to continually
lower their times for the national
championships meet.
The Arizona dual meets moti
vated the Cardinal team to prepare
for an upcoming meet against the
USC Women of Troy, the most
important dual meet of the season,

Quick said.
The Cardinal team has suffered
only one loss, to USC last year, in
the last eight years. The return of
Troy breaststroke and individual
medley swimmer Kristine Quance,
who was named 1996 NCAA swim
mer of the year and Lindsay
Benko, who won the 500-yard
freestyle and 200-yard backstroke
events at the national champi
onships last year, will provide a
challenge for the Cardinal team.
"I think the Trojans are per
forming better than last year.
They've got some real strong swim
mers," Quick said. "It should be a
very good, very competitive meet
for our swimmers."
The Cardinal will battle the
UCLA Bruins at 1 p.m. Friday and
the Trojans at noon Saturday at
deGuerre Pool.
