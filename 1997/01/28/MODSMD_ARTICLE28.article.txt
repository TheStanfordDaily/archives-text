# Baseball swamps Gaels

### Ben Freda Contributing writer 
The Cardinal baseball team, flexing its
muscles for the second time this season, non
chalantly tossed aside St. Mary's yesterday
with such ease that many speculated the team
was ready for arenas more challenging than
NCAA baseball. Perhaps the team would be
willing to try its prowess with the national
budget or the hostage situation in Peru.
Until a position in the cabinet opens up,
however, the Cardinal has to satisfy its lust by
crushing teams like the St. Mary's Gaels (0-2),
10-0 victims of the Cardinal (2-0) before 192
fans at Sunken Diamond.
"I thought the game was great," said head
coach Mark Marquess. "This was a better
game than even Sunday's [18-6 victory]. We
had great pitching, no errors and impressive
execution."
Marquess doesn't exaggerate.
In yesterday's game, the Gaels looked help
less at the hands of Stanford and particularly
sophomore hurler Jeff Austin. In front of a
sharp defensive squad, the right-hander
pitched five innings of nearly flawless one-hit
ball, incapacitating St. Mary's for the lion's
share of the afternoon.
What the defense did to the Gaels in the top
of each inning, the Card offense equaled dur
ing the bottom.

Stanford started quickly. After a fast dou
ble play, sophomore center fielder Jody Gerut
was able to nurse a two-out walk. Junior
catcher Jon SchaefTer made it worth his while,
smashing a towering home run to right-center
field, making the score 2-0.
To lead off the second, the long ball was at
it again, this time off the bat of sophomore
shortstop Josh Hochgesang to up the score to
3-0. Then, in the third, the Card added a cou
ple more on a two-run double by senior first
baseman Luke Quaccia.
Austin's domination of batters kept the
score at 5-0 until he was removed from duty
after five innings, having shut out St. Mary's
and allowed just a single hit. Austin turned it
over to the relief squad.
Before the season, the quality of the relief
pitching crew was a conspicuous question
mark, blinking on and off like a neon sign in
the minds of coaches and dedicated fans. Yes
terday's game did more to allay those ques
tions than months of preseason planning
could have.
Sophomore southpaw Brent Hoard, in his
first appearance of the season, took the steer
ing wheel from Austin to start the sixth
inning.
"I was all juiced up in the beginning, but I
was able to settle down and concentrate,"
