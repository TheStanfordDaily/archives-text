# Season kickoff
## No. 2 women's tennis plays host to Loyola Marymount Lions 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
It will most likely not be the
toughest outing for the Stanford
women's tennis squad when it
meets Loyola Marymount today
at the Stanford Tennis Stadium
at 1:30 p.m., but the Cardinal
could definitely use the tuneup.
The match is the season open
er for the Cardinal, but with the
outcome practically a foregone
conclusion, it represents one last
warm-up before the opening of
the grueling Pacific 10 Confer
ence season. Stanford, undefeat
ed in two consecutive league
campaigns, begins Pac-10 play
Friday against Arizona in Tuc
son.
"They are not quite as good as
a Pac-10 powerhouse, but they
are building something down
there," said Stanford head coach
Frank Brennan.
"We'd like to have more of
these matches before" the Pac
-10 season, Brennan said. "It
would be nice to warm up some
first, but we go off to Arizona
real soon."
Today's match will also serve
to secure the Cardinal lineup as
the women head into conference
competition.

"We are trying to get our line
up together," Brennan said. "We
don't know what it is yet. It's
just one of those years. The play
ers aren't cooperating because
they all look pretty good.
Nobody's falling off the cliff."

'We are trying to
get our lineup to
gether. ... It's just one
of those years. The
players aren't coop
erating because they
all look pretty good.'

Although the lineup is not yet
set for today's match, it will like
ly resemble the flight assign
ments which Brennan employed
last weekend at the Pac-10
Championships.
In singles, seniors Katie
Schlukebir and Sandra De Silva
battled in the top flight, followed
in Flight 2 by junior Ail-Ameri
cans Ania Bleszynski and Julie
Scott.

Freshman Teryn Ashley cap
tured the singles title in the
third flight, where she was
joined by fellow freshman Jenn
Heiser.
Freshman Anne Kremer, who
did not make the trip to Seattle
last weekend, will likely be
placed in the singles lineup as
well.
Also absent from the festivi
ties last weekend was freshman
Lilia Osterloh, who is doubtful
to compete today in singles due
to tenderness in her shoulder.
However, Osterloh may be in
the lineup for doubles play. If so,
she would team up with
Schlukebir, who already has col
lected two doubles and two sin
gles titles this season.
Bleszynski and Scott will also
pair up for Stanford, as will Kre
mer and Ashley. Ashley captured
a second title in Seattle while
playing doubles with Schlukebir.
Today "may be a little
screwy," Brennan said of the
lineup for Loyola Marymount.
"But I do want to have my
starters in there because this is
their only warm-up before Ari
zona."
Loyola Marymount comes
into the match with two dual
match wins over Hawaii.
