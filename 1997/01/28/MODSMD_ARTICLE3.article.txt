# High burden of proof supported
## 56 percent want for 'beyond a reasonable doubt' 
### Elisabeth Morse Staff writer 
More than half of all students
believe that the standard of proof
used to determine guilt or inno
cence in Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard violations
should remain at guilty "beyond
a reasonable doubt," according to
a recent Daily poll.
Last spring, the Committee of
15 — a panel of faculty, students
and administrators appointed by
University President Gerhard
Casper to revise the Stanford Ju
dicial Charter — considered low
ering the judicial charter's bur
den of proof to "clear and con
vincing evidence."
The committee decided it
would base its final recommenda
tion for burden of proof on stu
dent wishes, as determined by
the ASSU Senate.
"A number of the community
members felt that the burden of
proof should be decided by the
students," said committee mem
ber John Pearson, director of
Bechtel International Center.
"We wanted to create a system
that would work no matter what
the burden of proof was."
On Jan. 14, the ASSU Senate
decided by an almost unanimous
vote to recommend that the bur
den of proof should remain at

"beyond a reasonable doubt."
"I am more concerned with
the risk of convicting the inno
cent than the risk of acquitting
the guilty," ASSU President Bill
Shen said.
Only 23 percent of students
polled felt that the burden of
proof should be lowered to "clear
and convincing evidence." An
other 23 percent said they had no
opinion; 10 percent answered
that they didn't care.
The current burden of proof
standard has been criticized as
being unreasonable in many
cases, making it unnecessarily

complicated to prosecute many
violations of the Honor Code and
Fundamental Standard.
"The concept [of burden of
proof] is a difficult one to under
stand without seeing how the
burden of proof impacts individ
ual cases," said Assoc. Provost
Ann Fletcher, a committee mem
ber. "Probably, 'beyond a reason
able doubt' is more than is neces
sary for these cases.' "
However, issues of student
rights vs. an efficient process ig
nited controversy over the sug
gested changes.
"The student constitution

(which both Casper and the
Board of Trustees agreed to)
states under the rights of the ac
cused that they are innocent
until proven guilty," Shen said.
The Committee of 15 also pro
posed bringing the judicial
process back to the community,
using a committee of peers and
faculty instead of administra
tors.
Currently, accused students
have the option of meeting with
Dean of Students Marc Wais or
going before the Judicial Council.

All of the roughly 50 students ac
cused of violating the Honor Code
or Fundamental Standard last
year chose private hearings with
Wais.
This system, however, has
come under fire from faculty and
students alike.
"The present system is a trav
esty and totally inefficient," said
Law Prof. Barbara Babcock, an
other committee member. "Al
most anything would be an im
provement in terms of fairness
and due process."
Pearson said there has been
concern that the process has be
come purely administrative.
"The main process that we are
trying to do is give back as much
of the system as possible to those
that have a vested interest in it,
which is the faculty and stu

dents," he said.
Another proposed change to
the charter is an emphasis on a
stronger student understanding
of the Honor Code and Funda
mental Standard.
"My feeling is that students
don't know enough about their
rights which are being talked
about and changed," Shen said.
The Committee of 15 hopes to
raise student awareness of Honor
Code and Fundamental Standard
violation issues through extensive
education.
"Beginning with freshman Ori
entation, there will be a discussion
of what the Honor Code really
means, how people can make poor
decisions under pressure and
what academic honesty really
means," Fletcher said. "Some
times those lines aren't really as
clear as they ought to be."
While 84 percent of students
polled claimed to have read the
Honor Code and Fundamental
Standard as presented on the

cover of exam booklets, 5 percent
of students polled admitted to vio
lating the Honor Code or Funda
mental Standard; two students
declined to answer.
"There's the hope that with the
new system, which includes more
education, poll methodology
might ultimately be less violations
because people will understand
what's expected of them," Fletch
er said.
