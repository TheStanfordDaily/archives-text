# Men remain strong in Arizona
## Wins over Sun Devils, Wildcats put Stanford at 6-0 
### Casey Harmon Contributing writer 
The Stanford men's swimming and
diving team extended its undefeated
dual meet record to 6-0 last weekend
with wins over Arizona (140-101) and
Arizona State (150.5-83.5).
The top-ranked Stanford team
took on Arizona State Friday in
Tempe and started out the meet in
familiar fashion, taking first and sec
ond places in the 400-yard medley
relay. The Stanford A team of senior
Matt Thomson, junior Andre Salles-
Cunha, sophomore Matt Pierce and
senior Scott Jones edged out the Car
dinal B relay of sophomores Dan
Schultz and Blake Holden, and
juniors Jed Crowe and Chris Olson,
3:22.57 to 3:22.81. Arizona State's
fastest relay finished third in 3:23.81.
In the 1,000-yard freestyle, an
event in which Cardinal senior Kevin
Radvany has been dominant all sea
son, Stanford got another win from

sophomore Matt O'Mara, who won
the event over Arizona State's Mike
Melley in 9:15.72.
Coaches Skip Kenney and Ted
Knapp kept Radvany out of the 1,000
free, his dual-meet specialty. Perhaps
they knew they would need his help in
the next event of the meet, the 200
freestyle, featuring Arizona State's
Francisco Sanchez, who was an
NCAA champion last year.
Radvany, along with teammates
Justin Ewers, Kurt Spenser and
Thomson, were unable to overcome
Sanchez's speed; Sanchez won the
event in 1:39.27, bettering second
place Radvany's 1:39.70.
Arizona State's sprint freestyle
strength showed again in the 50
freestyle when Sun Devil senior and
Ecuadorian Olympian Felipe Delgado
and his teammate Craig Hutchinson
took first and second in 20.64 and
20.72 seconds, respectively. Stanford
juniors Scott Claypool, Olson and
Crowe ended up third, fourth and

fifth in the event, respectively.
In the diving events, freshman
Andrew Harper put together two
good lists against Arizona State.
Harper picked up his first dual-meet
victories of the season, winning
both the 1- and 3-meter spring
boards with totals of 249.30 and
265.18, respectively. He was sup
ported by fellow freshman diver
Mark Michelin, who took third on
the one-meter and fourth on the 3-
meter board.
Another notable performance was
freshman Glenn Counts' win in the
200 individual medley in 1:53.36.
Counts was followed by teammates
Jones and sophomore Dodd Wales to
lock up the first three positions for
the Cardinal. Pierce's 200-yard but
terfly victory in 1:48.60 was seconded
by Wilkens, who touched in 1:50.10,
and Ewers' 200-vard backstroke win
(1:50.06) was just ahead of sopho-
more teammate Casey Ketter
ling's 1:51.00.
Radvany and O'Mara com
bined for a one-two finish in the
500-yard freestyle, again beating
out Arizona State's distance spe
cialist Melley, and Holden and
Salles-Cunha took first and sec
ond in the 200-yard breaststroke
in 2:04.68 and 2:07.45.
Stanford definitely showed its
depth in the second half of the
meet against Arizona State, and
even a pool-record-setting Ari
zona State win of 2:59.71 in the
400-yard freestyle relay could not
catch the Cardinal.
Stanford traveled to Tucson for
its Saturday meet against Arizona
and started the meet with another
1-2 finish in the 400 medley relay.
However, the Wildcats would
pick up victories in the next three
events, as Ryk Neethling handed
Radvany his first dual-meet loss
of the year in the 1,000 free, and
Adam Grodski and Jason Orozco
won the 200 and 50 freestyles for
Arizona.
Stanford's first individual win
came from Wilkens in the 200
individual medley, while his team
mates Thomson and Wales
grabbed the second and third posi
tions.
Another 1-2-3 victory for Stan
ford came in the 200 butterfly as
Pierce won in 1:50.25 and was fol
lowed bv Jed Crowe and Holden.

In the 100 free, Claypool and
Olson took first and second, while
Ewers, Ketterling, Thomson and
Pierce went 1-2-3-4 in the 200
backstroke, and Wilkens and
Holden took first and second in
the 200 breast.
Stanford's A 400 free relay of
Crowe, Olson, Jones and Wales
was victorious with a time of
3:04.23.
If the Arizona schools looked
surprisingly strong at times
against the Cardinal, there were
reasons.
Many of the Stanford swim
mers swam off-events during the
trip to gain some experience with
different types of races, resulting
in many non-specialists taking the
reigns in certain events.
Add the fact that Cardinal
standouts Sabir Muhammad and
Tate Blahnik stayed home from
the trip, and it is clear that Stan
ford's two wins were achieved
without the Cardinal's best possi
ble lineup in the water.
One thing that the weekend did
prove is that the sprint programs
at both of the Arizona schools will
be serious contenders in the short
er individual events and relays at
NCAAs. While neither the Sun
Devils' nor the Wildcats' chances
at winning the championship are
very realistic, their strength in the
sprints will add excitement to a
wide-open meet.
With what it learned this week
end, Stanford knows a little more
about where its challenges lie as it
prepares for the NCAA Champi
onships in March.
