### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
Stanford Health Services and its midwifery ser
vice agreed on a plan last week that will maintain
full-time availability of midwives, revising an earlier
budget proposal that threatened the future of the
service.
Midwifery Service at Stanford will become "an in
dependent entity that will contract with the Univer
sity," said Linda Walsh, director of midwifery at
Stanford Hospital. The agreement "can ensure that
we maintain a strong midwifery service," she said.
The University will provide a startup loan and ac
cess to clinical, office and computer services, accord
ing to Judy Frabotta, a special assistant to SHS Pres
ident and CEO Peter Van Etten.
However, the plan will still impose some financial
risk on the midwives, Walsh said. "The next six
months will be tight fiscally," she predicted.
Financial difficulties for midwives may be com
pounded because some patients left the service, as

suming it would be discontinued.
In a statement, Van Etten stressed the benefits of
maintaining a midwifery program in the high-tech
setting of Stanford Hospital.
"Mothers-to-be at Stanford are particularly fortu
nate to have this alternative approach to childbirth,"
he said, adding that women who encounter complica
tions in giving birth will be surrounded by some of
the most advanced technology available.
According to Frabotta, the SHS administration is
"pleased to retain midwifery services in a way that
satisfied both parties."
Letters from the community built support for the
midwifery service when a budget proposal threat
ened its existence. Last week's agreement showed
that SHS is responsive to consumer preferences,
Walsh said.
Midwifery offers patients an alternative to tradi
tional care by focusing on the psychological, in addi
tion to the medical, aspects of pregnancy.
Growing through word of mouth, midwifery has
been an option at Stanford since 1994.
