# Support voiced for Sand Hill

Community members voiced almost unanimous
support for Stanford's proposed Sand Hill Road project
at a packed meeting of the Palo Alto City Council last
night.
More than 200 people attended the meeting.
The Stanford Management Co. has offered to pay for
the entire Sand Hill expansion, which would widen
Sand Hill Road and connect it to El Camino Real, build
rental housing aimed at Stanford employees and senior
housing in the West Campus area and expand the Stan
ford Shopping Center.
The Palo Alto Planning Commission and Architec
ture Review Board were among the groups that gave
presentations prior to the public comment, both sup
porting the proposed changes.
A short video presented the proposed changes in
model form, allowing the audience to envision what the
final stage of the changes would really look like.
Lany Horton, Stanford's director of community re
lations, explained that Stanford already engaged in
much community outreach before drafting the plan.
He also said the proposals were designed to correct
growing problems in the area, including traffic, a
shortage of housing and a lack of economically viable
community.
"We at Stanford are not in this for the short run,"
Horton said. "We are long-term community members."

Palo Alto Mayor Joe Huber and the rest of the city
council members plan to comment after further public
meetings are held.
Some community residents did speak out against the
changes, asking that the council further review the pro
ject's environmental impact before making a decision.
Priya Graves, a resident of College Terrace, east of
Stanford Avenue, said that considering the widening of
Sand Hill to be a panacea for all traffic problems is trou
bling. "In the long run," she said, "roads are always
going to get full again."
Many more people, however, most representing com
panies or organizations, favored Stanford's planned
changes.
Irene Sampson, a Palo Alto resident, said the expan
sion would ease the housing shortage in the Palo Alto
area. She said she believed both the new Stanford West
housing and the senior housing would have positive ef
fects. Because 25 percent of the housing units would be
sold below market rate, families with lower incomes
could also rent in the area, she said.
Bay Area Economic Forum President Larry Bach
also supported the proposed changes. "There are clear
connections between Stanford as an eminent research
university and the economic health of the Bay Area,"
Bach said. "We need to promote the economic vitality of
our region."
Palo Alto resident Linda Kimball said she feels Stan
ford is a good neighbor. "They are very concerned about
the environmental impact."
