# PepsiCo to pull out of Burma
## Student activists will end boycott 
### Daniel Wolk Contributing writer 
PepsiCo announced late Sunday
it will discontinue its business ven
tures in Burma, ending nearly a
year of student protest against the
company.
"Based on our assessment of the
spirit of current U.S. government
foreign policy, we are completing our
total disengagement from the
Burmese market," Edward Lahey
Jr., a senior vice president for Pepsi-
Co, said in a statement.
PepsiCo's bottler in Burma plans
to end all production and distribu
tion by May 31.
The corporation had been under
great pressure from various student
activist groups and government
agencies to pull out from the belea
guered nation because of alleged
human rights abuses. The nation

has been ruled by an autocratic mili
tary junta since 1988, when the mil
itary crushed a popular uprising and
renamed the country Mvanmar. its
precolonial name.
"There is an incredible feeling of
elation after working for so long on
something and to succeed," said
ASSU Vice President Nick Thomp
son, a member of Students for Envi
ronmental Action at Stanford. The
group, which led local protests
against the involvement of Ameri
can corporations in Burma, also en
couraged students to boycott Pepsi-
Co products.
"This shows how much student
activists can accomplish," Thomp
son added.
SEAS was involved in petitioning
the University last March to prevent
Taco Bell, a subsidiary of PepsiCo,
from opening a branch in Tresidder
Union. SEAS also was active in or
ganizing a hunger strike last May.
PepsiCo, one of the largest com
panies to withdraw from Burma,
controls the restaurant chains Pizza
Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken,

although it is in the process of spin
ning off those divisions. Eddie
Bauer, Strauss and Liz Clai
borne have already withdrawn from
Burma.
PepsiCo, reacting to student
protests, announced in May that it
would sell 40 percent of its stake in
the Burma bottling venture to a sep
arate contractor. The company,
however, continued to supply mate
rials necessary for the production of
its popular Pepsi-Cola soft drink.
But PepsiCo's recent decision
severs all ties with the bottler and
with Burma itself.
"I feel very surprised, very
happy," said Jason Burnett, a junior
and member of SEAS who was ac
tive in the Taco Bell debate. "I am
proud of any involvement [student
activists] had in that decision.
"It will help [student activists]
gain support for other campaigns
like the Burma one," he added. "It's
encouraging for the future."
Burnett added that Texaco and
