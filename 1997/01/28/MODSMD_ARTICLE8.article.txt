## CIA left in dark over arms sales 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Anthony Lake's National Security
Council knew that disclosure of
Iranian arms sales to Bosnia
would be "dynamite" and sought
to leave no fingerprints when tac
itly approving it, Republicans con
tend in a newly declassified report.
The document, portions of
which were blacked out in a White
House security review, is to be
released later this week. A copy
was obtained by The Associated
Press.
The report by a select House
subcommittee says Lake — nomi
nated by President Clinton to head
the CIA — kept the CIA and
Congress in the dark about the
U.S. role in the shipments. It also
says the account given by Lake and
other senior administration offi
cials was contradicted in sworn tes
timony by two senior diplomats.
The subcommittee's criticism
of Lake is expected to be raised
during his confirmation hearings
next month.
The report examines Clinton's
April 1994 decision not to object to
Iranian arms passing through
Croatia en route to Bosnia. The
secret decision ran counter to the
administration's public support
for an international arms embargo
over the former Yugoslavia.
The Republicans said Lake's
testimony about the administra
tion policy contradicted the sworn
testimony of Peter Galbraith, the
U.S. ambassador to Croatia, and
then-special envoy Charles Red
man.
Lake's statements were sup
ported in the report by his deputy,
Samuel Berger; Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott; and
Lake's European adviser, Jenonne
Walker.
The subcommittee reached no
conclusion on whose testimony
was truthful.

In dispute is the National Secu
rity Council role in instructing
Galbraith, who sought guidance
before meeting with Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman.
Because of its sensitivity, the ques
tion went immediately to Lake.
On April 27, 1994, Lake con
ferred with Clinton aboard Air
Force One en route to the funeral
of former President Nixon. Clin
ton approved an option in which
Galbraith would tell Tudjman that
he had "no instructions" on the
arms shipments. In diplomatic
parlance, that meant the United
States would raise no objections
Galbraith gave Tudjman the
"no instructions" message on
April 28. But the ambassador was
concerned that Tudjman still
believed the United States might
oppose the shipments, according
to the majority report.
Walker reiterated the "no
instructions" guidance in a tele
phone call to Galbraith. She
added, according to Galbraith's
testimony, that Lake had spoken
"with raised eyebrows and a
smile." Galbraith took this to
mean he could be more clear about
U.S. intentions with the Croatian
president.
Neither Lake nor Walker
recalled any such body language.
Lake, furthermore, told the panel
that it was the State Department's
responsibility to officially instruct
Galbraith.
A clear endorsement of the
arms shipments by the United
States risked angering European
allies who feared that open sup
port of arms shipments could pro
voke Serb attacks on their peace
keepers in Bosnia.
In part for that reason, Berger
said, "It would be 'dynamite to do
a record,' meaning that there
should be no paper trail," accord
ing to the report.
