Attention African American, Chicano, Native
American and Filipino American Students!
The Irvine Fellows Program For Future Ph.D.s
is now accepting nominations from Stanford Faculty for
students to participate in the 1997 summer program to take place
June 22 through July 26 on the Stanford campus.
In an effort to increase the flow of historically under-represented
students entering graduate study, the James Irvine Foundation
provides funding for students who are of African American,
Mexican American, Native American or Filipino American
descent to take part in the Irvine Fellows Program for Future
Ph.D.s.
This program is designed to provide the intellectual rigor and
orientation to academic culture which will ease students'
transition into doctoral study and enable them to excel in Ph.D.
programs in preparation for careers as faculty in the Humanities
and Social Sciences.
Program Activities Include:
• Graduate-level seminar led by Stanford Faculty.
• Tutorials led by Stanford Graduate Students.
• Writing Workshops.
• Miscellaneous Supplementary Workshops (GRE
preparation, library research sessions, etc...)
• Cultural-Educational Fieldtrips.
The Program Provides:
• Room and Board.
• $2,000 Stipend.
• Required Texts.
Interested students who wish to be considered for this program
should have a professor send a letter of nomination to Jacqueline
Olvera, 122 Sweet Hall 3088, jackie@forsythe.stanford.edu.
Nominations must arrive by February 14.
Come to an informational meeting on Monday, February 3,
7:00-8:00 PM, Bldg. 200, Rm. 105. Speak with the Program
Director and hear former Irvine Fellows share their experiences
of the program.
