# Med School professor reinstated
## 
### Boris Bershteyn Contributing writer 
The Superior Court of Santa Clara County yes
terday overturned a decision by the University ad
ministration, granting a motion to reinstate Adolf
Pfefferbaum to his tenured position as a psychiatry
professor.
Pfefferbaum resigned his teaching position at the
Veterans Affairs Hospital in Palo Alto in July. The
University has maintained that this resignation
amounted to a resignation from his professorship,
an interpretation with which Pfefferbaum dis
agrees.
The ruling by Judge Peter Stone rejected the Uni
versity's argument and maintained that Pfeffer
baum had not resigned and the University's action
constituted a dismissal.
Before they can be dismissed, tenured professors
are entitled to a hearing before the Advisory Board,
a faculty body that deals with appointment and pro
motion of professors. The University had contended
that no such hearing was necessary because Pfeffer
baum had resigned.
Stone also put off a lawsuit by Pfefferbaum and
Assoc. Psychiatry Prof. Brant Wenegrat against the
University, pending the results of the Advisory
Board hearing.
Pfefferbaum and Wenegrat argue that the Uni
versity has violated standards of academic freedom
because the environment at their assigned position
at the hospital was so "hostile" that "neither they
nor any reasonable academic person would remain
employed there."
Pfefferbaum resigned his position at the hospital
because he found "being a VA employee incompati
ble with the exercise of | his] rights, duties and privi
leges as a faculty member.
"This in no way represents a resignation from my
position as a professor at Stanford, nor is it an ex
pression of my unwillingness to fulfill my obligations
to the University," Pfefferbaum said in a letter to
Alan Schatzberg, chair of psychiatry and behavioral
science at the School of Medicine.
Yesterday's decision concurred.
According to Eli Gould, a Palo
Alto attorney who is representing
Stanford in the matter, the Uni
versity disagrees with the court's
order to reinstate Pfefferbaum
but will follow it.
However, Gould praised
Stone's decision to stay the law
suit. Academic freedom issues
should be pursued within the Uni
versity, not in the courts, he said.
Pfefferbaum's attorney, Paul
McCloskey, responded that his
client's appeals to Provost Con
doleezza Rice and University
President Gerhard Casper were
rejected last year.
In August, Casper wrote to Pf
efferbaum, warning that "the
University will regard [himl as
having resigned from [his] Stan
ford faculty position" unless he
returns to the hospital or opts for
University retirement status.
McCloskey said yesterday's de
cision rejects Casper's reasoning.
University Communications Di
rector Terry Shepard said Casper

declined to comment.
Gould said Pfefferbaum will be
restored to the University's pay
roll but only for the amount the
University paid him, which con
stitutes about a quarter of his
original salary. The rest was paid
by the Veterans Affairs Hospital.
Gould added that it was "not
clear yet" if Pfefferbaum will re
sume any of his other duties be
fore the Advisory Board hearing.
According to McCloskey, Pfef
ferbaum is cooperating with the
University to ensure that the
three federally funded projects he
oversees will continue. One will
remain at Stanford and two will
move to the Stanford Research
Institute, which has no affiliation
with the University. Pfefferbaum
will continue as the principal in
vestigator of all three.
If the University administra
tion continues its attempt to dis
miss Pfefferbaum, it will have to
do so through a public hearing by
the Advisory Board.
"The University administra
tion has been trying to avoid open
discussion," Wenegrat said, pre
dicting that embarrassing revela
tions about the Veterans Affairs
Hospital and the Medical School
may surface.

Much of the lawsuit deals with
the actions of Anesthesiology
Prof. Richard Mazze, who serves
as chief of staff at the hospital and
associate dean at the Medical
School.
According to McCloskey,
Mazze used his position to retali
ate against Pfefferbaum, Wene
grat and other faculty members at
the hospital who criticized
Mazze's conduct.
The key to the lawsuit is that the
administration will not step in and
protect the rights of the faculty be
cause of the financial benefits of
the University's connection with
the hospital, McCloskey said.
He stressed that the freedom of
professors to "search for the un
known" without political con
straints "is the heart of a great
university."
"No great professor will come
to Stanford University if they
deny academic freedom," Mc-
Closkey added.
This would mark the second
time in the history of the Univer
sity that the administration has
attempted to remove a tenured
professor. In 1971, the Advisory
Board dismissed English Prof.
Bruce Franklin who took part in
violent anti-war protests.
