### 
SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) - The
president gave the ruling Social
ists a mandate to form a new gov
ernment yesterday, and opposi
tion leaders said their foes must
take full responsibility for leading
Bulgaria out of its crisis.
The Socialists are blamed for
rampant inflation, a plunge in liv
ing standards and failure to insti
tute economic reform. Their gov
ernment resigned last month,
prompting 21 days of street
protests by residents demanding

early elections.
The constitution obliged Pres
ident Petar Stoyanov to offer the
helm of government to the Social
ists because they are the most
numerous party in parliament.
Stoyanov asked the party, the for
mer Communists, to turn down
the offer to help clear the way for
urgent reforms and new elec
tions.
But Nikolai Dobrev, now pre
mier-designate, made clear yes
terday that he would go ahead

and form a government. He
promised it would be broad
based.
Aware that the opposition
promised street protests if deci
sive measures were not taken,
Dobrev warned "confrontation at
this very moment is deadly for
the country."
Emerging from the talks
between Stoyanov and all the
groups represented in parliament,
Yordan Sokolov, leader of the
main opposition Union of Demo

cratic Forces, said the Socialists
must now ease the crisis.
Stoyanov had proposed that in
the next 10 days, Parliament
should establish a currency board
to impose spending discipline;
authorize a caretaker govern
ment to negotiate with interna
tional lending institutions for
new loans; and adopt a program
to rein in hyperinflation, guaran
tee a minimum living income
until spring and promote eco
nomic reform.
