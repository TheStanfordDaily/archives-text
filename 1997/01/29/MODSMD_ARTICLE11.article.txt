# Chechens elect separatist president

GROZNY, Russia (AP) - The
Chechen military commander who
negotiated a triumphant peace
with Russia emerged the winner
yesterday in the republic's presi
dential election.
While asserting Chechen inde
pendence, he acknowledged he still
must convince the rest of the world
of it.
Asian Maskhadov's insistence
that Chechnya already has won its

freedom is all but certain to bring
confrontations with Russia.
But Russia is unlikely to renew
its disastrous war against
Chechen separatists, and
Maskhadov stressed he is willing
to negotiate the highly charged
issue of his republic's ultimate
political status.
Moscow says it will not tolerate
secession, and President Boris
Yeltsin made it clear yesterday that

Chechnya must remain part of
Russia.
After a 20-month guerrilla war
that led to the humiliating with
drawal of Russian troops,
Chechens clearly feel they are in a
strong negotiating position. But
Moscow is certain to place political,
diplomatic and economic pressure
on Chechnya, which can expect a
struggle to win recognition from
the international communitv.

"If the Russians finally realize
that they've tried every single
method and that the only thing
that's left is direct talks, then we
are prepared for this," Maskhadov
told reporters at his campaign
headquarters in Grozny, the capi
tal.
"I will try to compromise, but
only within reasonable limits," said
Maskhadov wearing a lambswool
hat against the cold.
