# Jury begins deliberating O.J. wrongful death suit
## 
### 
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - O.J.
Simpson's fate was placed in the hands of
a jury yesterday after a final theatrical
flourish from an attorney who waved a
wad of bills at the football great and
accused him of cheapening the lives of the
victims.
The panel deliberated two hours before
quitting for the night. They must decide
whether Simpson should be held responsi
ble and made to pay millions for the June
12, 1994, knife slayings of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Simpson
was acquitted of the crime of a year and a
half ago.
Some jurors took notes as Judge
Hiroshi Fujisaki explained in his instruc
tions that Simpson is not being subjected
to double jeopardy: "Even though the
defendant Simpson was acquitted in the
criminal case, you can still find him liable."
In contrast to the mostly black criminal
jury that voted unanimously to clear Simp
son in downtown Los Angeles, just nine of
the 12 jurors on the mostly white civil
panel must agree to find Simpson respon
sible.
In his final words to the jury, plaintiff
attorney Daniel Petrocelli responded to
defense claims that the wrongful death
claim was baseless and that anyone can file
such a lawsuit by paying a $200 fee. He
took out some bills and waved them in
front of Simpson.
"In their zeal to get your verdict, have
they become so insensitive to the greatest
of human tragedies, the loss of life . . . that
they tell you it costs $200 to file a law
suit?" Petrocelli said.
"Mr. Simpson, here's $200. Give . . my
client back his son!"

Simpson's lawyer, Robert Baker, rose
from his seat and yelled back: "Give it up!
Give it up!"
"Give my client back his son, and we
will march out of here in a heartbeat!"
Petrocelli raged. Simpson showed no reac
tion.
Petrocelli's stirring end to the five
month case came after nearly five days of
closing arguments.
As the court day began, the case was
further delayed by an hour because of an
undisclosed jury problem.
Sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said some jurors had been con
tacted by a person or agency offering to
represent them after the trial for media
deals. Jurors brought the matter to the
judge's attention, and the judge inter
viewed all the panelists without dismissing
any of them.
Once jurors returned to their seats, the
plaintiffs unleashed a final volley of invec
tive against Simpson. Petrocelli berated
both Simpson and Baker for "denying the
undeniable" and for underestimating the
victims' lives.
"We heard Mr. Baker say Mr. Simpson
is the victim in all of this — not two pre
cious human beings that are dead," Petro
celli said.
"Enough is enough," the lawyer contin
ued. "Two people lost their lives. ... They
deserve their final peace. Their lives mat
tered . . . and that man who took their lives
should be held accountable."
Petrocelli urged jurors to discount
Simpson's easy demeanor and winning
smile, quoting Shakespeare's "Hamlet" —
"One may smile and smile and be a vil
lain."
