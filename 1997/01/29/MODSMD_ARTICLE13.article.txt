# Clinton calls for restoring welfare money

WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Clinton and the Senate's top
Republican sharpened battle lines
yesterday over Clinton's desire to
restore money to the newly over
hauled welfare program. But on
another budget front, each said he
might consider raising monthly
premiums for some Medicare
recipients.
The remarks by Clinton and
Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., underline the
numerous, complex political and
fiscal issues the two sides must
address if they are to complete a
budget-balancing deal this year. In
nine days, Clinton will present
Congress with his fiscal 1998 bud
get and newest plan for eliminat
ing deficits by 2002.
At a news conference, Clinton
said he will propose easing the new
welfare law's impact on legal
immigrants, which he has said he
would do since signing the legisla
tion last August during his re-elec
tion campaign.
The measure, which is sup
posed to trim welfare spending by
$55 billion over six years, denies
many federal benefits to legal
immigrants who have not yet
become citizens, including many
elderly people.
The president is expected to
propose restoring about $16 billion
to the programs for legal immi

grants and food stamps and to help
welfare recipients to get jobs,
according to administration and
congressional officials.
In recent days, even Republican
governors who a year ago wanted
dramatic welfare cuts have been
lobbying Lott and other GOP con
gressional leaders to restore some
benefits for immigrants.
"I'm not sure we can't get some
changes," Clinton said during a
White House news conference.
"I'm very hopeful that we can, and
I'm going to give it my very best
effort."
Congressional Republicans
strongly oppose adding money
back to the program. At his own
news conference at the Capitol,
Lott said earlier in the day that
with the federal government's
budget problems, he is in no mood
to spend more on welfare.
"We have a great big national
debt and an annual deficit that
we're trying to address," Lott said.
"So when anybody comes up here
and says 'Oh, geez, we need to
open up welfare and add back $13,
$14, $17 billion ... I'm not real
impressed with that.' "
Lott said he would not rule out
addressing the request for extra
money during budget talks. But he
cautioned, "1 think it would be
pretty hard to go back and find
that amount of money."
