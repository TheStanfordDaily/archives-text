Mexican immigrants not so draining
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Most immigrants from western Mexico
who come to California legally or illegally return home within a few
years, and those who stay tend to be educated and have good paying
jobs, a study found yesterday.
While it is common for immigrants to return home, the study's
author said she was surprised by the extent of the movement back
to western Mexico.
Fifty-one percent of illegal immigrants who come to California
from western Mexico return home within two years, Belinda Reyes
said. Twenty percent of that group stay longer than 10 years.
Among immigrants legally in the United States, about 50 percent
return to Mexico after 10 years, the study found. And among all
immigrants, regardless of legal status, fewer than a third stay longer
than 10 years.
Reyes said the results debunk notions that Mexican immigrants
drain social services and educational resources in California and that
immigrants flock north in hopes of receiving public assistance.
Army sex scandal continues
BALTIMORE (AP) — A fifth Army instructor has been charged
in a sex scandal at Aberdeen Proving Ground, and another soldier
who was already charged was dismissed yesterday.
Sgt. Ist Class William Jones, the latest soldier to be charged, is
accused of indecent assault, being drunk while on duty and failing to
obey orders governing the interaction between instructors and stu
dents, the Army said.
If he is found guilty, he faces up to six months in military prison.
