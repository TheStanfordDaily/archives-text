ASSU President Shen
shows chutzpah in his
misguided audit idea

ASSU PRESIDENT BILL
Shen has once again
demonstrated his tight
grasp on the concept of irony. Last
week, he proposed auditing stu
dent organizations that receive
money though special fees and the
ASSU's Program, Community
Service and Publications boards.
Shen characterized his new
proposal as a policy of account
ability. He wants to be sure that
money approved by the ASSU
Senate or the students is being
used for its intended purpose.
Shen stressed the importance of
students getting what they pay
for. However, typical of this presi
dency, he has yet to enumerate the
specifics of the program.
The core of this proposal's
irony lies in its author. Shen has
had a long history of budgetary
improprieties as a leader of the
ASSU and as a leader of student
groups. His most recent budget
follies were discovered just
months ago when it was revealed
he had overdrawn his ASSU bud
get, some estimates placing him at
more than $2,000 in debt. He
denies the legitimacy of these
claims but has yet to discount
them by offering solid accounting
to the contrary.
Shen defended his budgetary
actions by parading his accom
plishments: the Jackson-D'Souza
debate, the third-party candidates
debate, the Ross Perot speech,
etc. Yet these events, typically
handled by student groups such
as Stanford In Government, cost
the students a lot of money. Plus,
Shen has yet to resolve his post-it
notes scandal in which he pur
chased and rush ordered 8,000
self-adhesive notepads to the
ASSU for a total cost of $3,000. It
is unlikely these expenses were
worth their price.

It is ironic that Shen should
want to hold student groups to
their budgets. Just two months
ago, Shen told The Daily that his
"budget is only a recommendation
for the year" and inferred that
budgets were meant to be adjust
ed over time.
Despite the origin of this new
policy proposal, one aspect does
have promise. When student orga
nizations apply for funding
through the ASSU, they are
required to submit budgets that
list detailed expenditures for spe
cific programming events. These
budgets, if approved by the senate
for funding, are then frozen. It
would be wise for the ASSU to
ensure that funds doled out to the
these groups are indeed being
used to support the same specific
programming events as promised
in their requests.
The business office of the ASSU
already keeps detailed records of
student groups' expenditures, and
these records are subject to an
external audit every year. But
they are analyzed so that receipts
and expenditures per line item
agree, not so that events that were
said to take place do. A line-item
audit would simply and needlessly
duplicate the business office's
responsibility.
Shen has proposed that his
interns handle the audit. This is a
disastrous idea. In the hands of a
single office, the audit could turn
into a political weapon against
student groups. But alternately, in
the hands of the 10-member Sen
ate Appropriations Committee,
the audit could be fair and even
handed. Additionally, Shen should
not exempt internal ASSU organi
zations from this auditing pro
cess.
Somehow, it's not surprising
that Shen's conversion to fiscal
restraint would be accompanied
by a dangerously partisan and
redundant policy prescription. If
any organization on campus has
demonstrated the need for bud
getary scrutiny, it is Shen's own
ASSU Office of the President.
