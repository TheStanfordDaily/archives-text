I CONSIDER MYSELF a taxpayer to
the Nation of Stanford. I have little
income (Daily columns don't pay, in
case you're thinking of applying next
volume), yet my "country" charges me
and my family about $30,000 per year
for the privilege of being a citizen. For
that kind of money, you'd think that my
nation would have a pretty big standing
army. They do. Unfortunately, the
army seems to be at war with the citi
zens.
I have a friend, who I'll call Mitch.
Mitch is your typical Stanford student
— bright as hell, motivated, interesting
and considerate. Mitch is one of the bus
iest people I've ever met. He pays his
taxes to the University also, but Mitch
will not be graduating this June, despite
the fact that this is his fourth year. He is
three classes short of his major, has fin
ished all of his distribution require
ments and was 45 units short of 180
when he came back to campus this fall.
On Monday Mitch found out that he
has been suspended for a full year. He
was allowed to move in during fall quar
ter, but his registration was revoked a
month later. He reapplied late last
December, and it took the powers that
be until late last week to determine his
fate.
What was Mitch's crime against
humanity? No violation of the Honor
Code or Fundamental Standard. No
felony convictions or late child support.
Mitch was "unit deficient."
Late last October, when Mitch was

kicked out, he was enrolled in 15 units.
Had they left him alone, Mitch would
have needed to take a grand total of 30
units over two quarters to graduate on
schedule. Even after Mitch was forced
out of his fall quarter classes, he could
have graduated on time with two
tremendous quarters, but the Universi
ty apparently wanted to teach him a les
son.
For three weeks Mitch tried to take
classes. For three weeks he tried to live
a normal life, despite the fact that he
had no housing. For three weeks, he
held down two almost full-time jobs. For
three weeks, the committee which deter
mined his fate sat on its ass while Mitch
waited.
So how exactly does the University
inform students that they won't be
graduating with their class and that
they'll be expected to start paying off
their loans immediately? No phone call.
No e-mail. Just a letter, which sat in the
Stanford post office for several days
before it found its way to Mitch's box.
I'm not too worried about Mitch. He's
a tough guy, and he'll find a detour
around this roadblock. But as a Stan
ford "taxpayer," I find this to be
extremely troubling.
Of course, Stanford is not its own
country. Students pay tuition, not taxes.
The administration and faculty are not
an occupying army, although they may
sometimes act like it.
But people who make decisions on
this campus often leave out the human

element. Mitch was not allowed to meet
his jury of faculty, who so callously
decided his fate. The men and women
who serve on that committee may be
reading this column and have absolutely
no idea who they have wronged or what
they have done.
I chose to attend Stanford because
unlike most large schools, I was under
the impression that I would not be treat
ed like a number. Mitch is a number. I
am a number, and if you're reading this
in class, you too are a number.
1 have never felt as small and power
less as I did Monday afternoon when I
found out what happened to Mitch. I'm
sad for him, but I'm more sad for Stan
ford. How many times has the Universi
ty flaunted common decency when deal
ing with students? I firmly believe that
what comes around goes around.
In his letter to The Daily last week,
Prof. Alphonse Juilland noted that uni
versities where created "by scholars for
scholars" and seemed to suggest that
we'd all be better off if things hadn't
changed. Know this, Prof. Juilland: I've
learned more from Mitch than I have
from any professor. Today Stanford has
one less student, and I feel so much bet
ter.
