### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
As last night's "Tea and More Cookies" demon
strated, reaction to the decision to turn down Asst.
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta for tenure has
been intense, with support from a wide range of stu
dent groups.
About 15 Gupta supporters showed up to the
open forum with Casper. "We want to be sure
[Casper's] communicating to us what the adminis
tration's commitments are," said anthropology
graduate student Monica Dehart De Galicia, speak
ing for a student organization that has been formed

to back Gupta.
"We knew [Casper] wouldn't be able to answer
questions directly," De Galicia said. "It was really
more important for us to express our concerns."
While receiving no promises from Casper, the
student supporters have not lost spirit.
"I think our campaign will continue even after
the [School of Humanities and Sciences senior ad
ministrators' say] no," she added. Their plans are
to continue with a letter-writing campaign and add
new items to a World Wide Web site created for the
cause.
