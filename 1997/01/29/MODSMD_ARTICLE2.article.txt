# Casper answers student criticism
## Supporters say they will continue backing Gupta 
### Bimal Shah Staff writer 
As last night's "Tea and More Cookies" demon
strated, reaction to the decision to turn down Asst.
Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta for tenure has
been intense, with support from a wide range of stu
dent groups.
About 15 Gupta supporters showed up to the
open forum with Casper. "We want to be sure
[Casper's] communicating to us what the adminis
tration's commitments are," said anthropology
graduate student Monica Dehart De Galicia, speak
ing for a student organization that has been formed

to back Gupta.
"We knew [Casper] wouldn't be able to answer
questions directly," De Galicia said. "It was really
more important for us to express our concerns."
While receiving no promises from Casper, the
student supporters have not lost spirit.
"I think our campaign will continue even after
the [School of Humanities and Sciences senior ad
ministrators' say] no," she added. Their plans are
to continue with a letter-writing campaign and add
new items to a World Wide Web site created for the
cause.

During yesterday's "Tea and Msore Cookies" session, freshman Christie Larson (right) questions Uni
versity President Gerhard Casper about the recent denial of tenure to Asst. Anthropology Prof. Akhil
Gupta.
Other interested student
groups include the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Community Center.
In addition to being generally sup
portive of its interests, Gupta is "a
supervisor for a couple of students
who are working on anthropologi
cal studies of gay cultures in
South Asia," said community cen
ter member Benjamin Lawrance,
a doctoral student.
Gupta has also taught classes
as part of the Science, Technolo

gy, and Society Program.
"No official position has been
taken by STS students," junior
STS major Ben Sussman said, but
"by all accounts, Prof. Gupta is a
credit to his department and the
University."
Like many others, Sussman
could not explain the disagree
ment between the Anthropology
Department and the School of Hu
manities and Sciences. "I'd be cu
rious to know the criteria the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences used," Sussman said.
Gupta's case has also attracted
support from faculty in addition
to the unanimous support of his

own deparment's tenure commit
tee. The Asian American Studies
Curriculum Committee is prepar
ing a letter in support of Gupta,
according to Assoc. History Prof.
Gordon Chang, a member of the
committee.
Chang said the committee is
planning to circulate the letter for
faculty signature and eventual
submission to the dean's office,
but that exactly what will be in the
letter and to whom it will be circu
lated is still not final.
Speaking personally, Chang
called Gupta "a very important
contributor to [the Asian Ameri
can studies] effort."
