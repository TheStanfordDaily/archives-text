Ujamaa senior explains difficulties of community building

ON BEHALF OF similar-minded
individuals in the black communi
ty at Stanford, I am writing this
letter to offer an apology to the larger
Stanford community.
Despite our community's continued
efforts to build community at Stanford
through our many institutions — the
Black Community Services Center, Uja
maa and the Black Voluntary Student
Organizations (BVSO) — the black com
munity has not been able to achieve fully
its goal of academically and socially sup
porting all African-American students,
faculty and staff.
As a member of the black community
at Stanford, I am able to authoritatively
say that there are some black people here
who feel that we are exclusive. Some have
voiced the concern that when they visit
Ujamaa to "bond" with the community,
they are not welcomed. Others have com
plained that they find it difficult to keep
abreast of the activities in the community
because information is not distributed to
all black people regardless of where on
campus they live or work.

All of these criticisms are valid. There
fore, the community is working diligently
to address them. Meanwhile, however, we
ask that folks be patient with us. It's diffi
cult.
First you must appreciate that we're
just people. Ujamaa is not a social exper
iment, and our cultural immersion is not
what we do for amusement. Ujamaa is
literally my home and this is how I live.
When people demand in the pages of
The Daily that I accept any and every
one into my home and family, they
politicize my most intimate personal
relationships. Under the watchful eye of
the world, it isn't easy for me to build
community.
Moreover, most of us are students, fac
ulty and staff whose purpose in being at
Stanford is not to befriend other black
people. Like other students who are here,
we have also come to obtain a top-notch
education. Part of the education process is
social, but there are other parts, such as
the major course of study, the distribution
requirements and the course electives. No
matter how hard we work to build com-

munity, when we apply for jobs and grad
uate studies after leaving Stanford, if our
grades are not competitive, when we are
evaluated, we will not be excused by our
dedication to black people.
In addition to the aforementioned fac
tors that make it difficult for members of
the black community to build a strong
community, our task is further complicat
ed by the many different and often con
flicting viewpoints of race and culture
that blacks hold — not to mention the
viewpoints of non-blacks. For example
there are many black students at Stanford
who object to all racial classifications and
have no desire to associate with other
blacks.
Then there are blacks who prefer not
to associate with people who feel this way.
And there are non-black people who seek
to delegitimize the primary institutions of
our community, arguing that they contra
dict our alleged demands for a color-blind
society. Given our world's erosion of the
moral basis on which we build communi
ty, our task is formidable indeed.
I am sorry that even people outside of

our community are so disappointed in us.
I never knew that Stanford cared so much
about how we got along. However, if you
really support us, you can do more than
offer criticism. You can take the initiative
to join a BVSO. If affiliating yourself with
a black organization would make you feel
uncomfortable, you can form an alliance
between an organization of which you are
a member and a BVSO on campus to per
form a project of mutual interest.
You can have a conversation with a
black person. You can welcome us into
your dorms when we visit them. You can
learn and adopt some practices of African-
American culture so that you don't make
us feel uncomfortable when we are
around you.
You can make Stanford a refuge from
racism — as Meredith McMorrow said
regarding Ujamaa, "a safe haven from all
the crap we put up with on daily basis." In
short, iif you really want to have a friend in
the black community, you really need to be
a friend to the black community.
