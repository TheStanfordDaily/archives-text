# Grundy's proof of God was not an impressive use of human reason
## 
### 
Garry Grundy, offering fresh and
intelligent dialogue on the mind-numb
ingly simple issues of religion, science
and the creation of the universe, was
wonderfully kind to answer every ques
tion one could have regarding "exis
tence" in his column yesterday.
Following closely a time-honored
way of thinking, perhaps seen most
magnificently in the Inquisition,
Grundy insightfully discovers that
atheist-scientists (one and the same)
are entirely irrational and, when you
think about it long enough, totally

inhuman, too.
Right on. In the way of evidence,
Grundy really gets to it: I must say that
it doesn't happen often that a college
newspaper columnist soundly disproves
(in general) the claims of Carl Sagan by
talking about a "tummy ache" as a
child. This is distinctly Stanford
genius. I will miss it.
OK, OK, let me stop sounding all bit
ter: Grundy, never be a quitter. You have
talent! A positive career move might be
for you to begin to write for The Stan
ford Review; you and Eric Jackson (see
Jan. 27 Review) could work together,
combining your shared logical skills and
knack for understanding social and intel
lectual issues with great ease to produce
a multivolume work. In fact, whenever
the existence of someone who doesn't
think like you baffles you, you could

write another page explaining their obvi
ous stupidity. Before you know it, you
will have a fat, Bible-length publication
that you could call "GG and EJ: On
Point like Vanilla Ice."
