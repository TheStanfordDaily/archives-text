# Grundy deserves praise for opening up dialogue
## 
### 
While I understand Garry Grundy's
confusion over the issue of atheism, I
doubt that his column (yesterday's Daily)
will alter many people's thinking.
Whether or not this was his objective, one
could only speculate. Nonetheless he rais
es the too often neglected issue of religion
at Stanford.
While students speak freely and openly

on many issues, religion seems a forbid
den topic in many conversations. This
may result, at least to some extent, from
the growing secularization of our society,
ignorance of other religious traditions or
any other number of causes. One must
also consider that college is a time when
may students explore new philosophies,
leaving the outdated ones behind.
Many people seem to feel uncomfort
able speaking about religion on the Farm.
Grundy's view of atheism clearly illus
trates this point.
While there are indeed atheists who
would argue that the universe is entirely
irrational, Grundy mistakenly assumes
that all atheists hold this view. His state
ment — "to deny the existence of a God
is to deny human intelligence altogether"
— while indicative of the viewpoints of
many, clearly does not express the over
riding sentiment of all. For example,
objectivists insist that the construction
of a God stems from the lack of human
intelligence.
This debate as to the rational justifi
cation brings up an interesting contrast.
In my experience believers in God are
considered irrational for the large part
while atheists are viewed as rational.
Grundy makes a strong argument to the
contrary. His words are reassuring in
light of my beliefs.
As a lifelong Presbyterian I suspect
that Grundy and I share many of the
same views. The philosophy of science as
the methodology of God has long
intrigued me, along with the idea of
divine order in the universe. It is indeed
comforting to know that someone else
believes that logic and God are necessar
ily inseparable.
While each reader is free to take
Grundy's opinion as he or she wishes, it
is important to remember the underly
ing message: It is acceptable to discuss
one's beliefs even if others disagree. We
apply this to politics, musical tastes and

many other subjects but shun discussion
of religion. For his willingness to discuss
his convictions I applaud Grundy in his
efforts.
