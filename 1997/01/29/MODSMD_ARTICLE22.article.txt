# Grundy deserves praise for opening up dialogue

### 
While I understand Garry Grundy's
confusion over the issue of atheism, I
doubt that his column (yesterday's Daily)
will alter many people's thinking.
Whether or not this was his objective, one
could only speculate. Nonetheless he rais
es the too often neglected issue of religion
at Stanford.
While students speak freely and openly

on many issues, religion seems a forbid
den topic in many conversations. This
may result, at least to some extent, from
the growing secularization of our society,
ignorance of other religious traditions or
any other number of causes. One must
also consider that college is a time when
may students explore new philosophies,
leaving the outdated ones behind.
Many people seem to feel uncomfort
able speaking about religion on the Farm.
Grundy's view of atheism clearly illus
trates this point.
While there are indeed atheists who
would argue that the universe is entirely
irrational, Grundy mistakenly assumes
that all atheists hold this view. His state
ment â€” "to deny the existence of a God
is to deny human intelligence altogether"
