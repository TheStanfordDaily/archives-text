## Let them eat cake: the mystical powers of The Last Piece 
### 
OK, HERE'S THE situation:
You're at a dinner party, and your
host brings out a chocolate layer
cake for dessert. You know the kind —
homemade, with a little help from home
and a lot of help from Betty Crocker —
baked to its moist, delicious best with
way-too-much, way-too-chocolate frost
ing smothered on top. With one gigantic
bite, everyone inhales their slices of
devil's food nirvana. At this moment in
time, life as we know it could end, and all
would die happy.
After a few milk chocolate burps, how
ever, your stomach sends a short tele
gram to your noggin, saying, "Please sir,
may I have some more?" Cautiously, you
raise one eye to check the status of the
remaining cake among the crumbs at the
center of the table. And there it is, with
one eye raised back at you — the one piece
left. It's just sitting there, taunting you,
teasing you, wanting you. But you balk.
You hold back. Because this is not just
any measly piece of cake.
It is The Last Piece.

The Last Piece is an extraordinary
piece in the grand scheme of cake. It holds
mystical powers. He who eats it has a
curse placed upon his home and his first
born. No one, without cover of heavy fire
power, will ever reach across an empty
table to claim The Last Piece. Scientific
studies have proven that laboratory rats
who have wandered lost in the desert for
months and have eat n nothing but sand
for weeks won't even sniff The Last Piece.
It is protected by Ziploc, the Norse
demigod of leftovers.
You know exactly what I'm talking
about. It is as if everyone is waiting
around for someone else to eat it so they
can say to themselves, "Wow, Joey ate it.
I can't believe he ate it. That son of a
bitch." Or maybe they are waiting for
everyone else to make it known that
they're full. "Well, if none of you want it,
I guess I can force it down." Or maybe we
are all just pathetic morons adhering to
social rules, norms and mores beyond our
control.
The Last Piece is bigger than you or I

— it is universal, crossing all borders,
whether they be geographical, cultural,
Bocioeconomical. Everybody figures that
as long as there is one piece left, they are
not to be blamed for the fact that they've
already eaten too much. And so, The Last
Piece remains.
Antarctica, for example, is the world's
Last Piece. The only reason nobody wants
it is because it would be just too damn
socially awkward to reach across the table
and take it. If Argentina for some reason
were to step forward and claim our sev
enth continent as a colony, the whole
world would think to themselves, "Wow,
Argentina ate it. I can't believe they ate it.
Those sons of bitches." And I won't even
mention what some of the native pen
guins would be thinking about the new
wave of brutal Argentine imperialism.
Over the years, a common maneuver
has been executed by experienced cake
eaters in attempting to circumvent
Piece angst. This maneuver is referred to
in the textbooks as "Divide and Conquer."
It involves cutting The Last Piece in half.

This way, you can have your cake, eat it
too and still leave another Last Piece for
someone else. All of the calories and none
of the social awkwardness. And, of course,
this can be done an infinite number of
times, always leaving a Last Piece (or at
least a Last Crumb) for someone else. The
initial defenders of "Divide and Conquer"
were burned at the stake for "subverting
the laws of nature."
Sometimes people don't even divide up
The Last Piece, they just kinda nibble at
it. This maneuver is referred to as "What
My Mom Does." She eats a little bit
around the edges, makes sure both sides
are even, tests the sweetness of the frost
ing, evens it off again, etc., until finally
there is absolutely no cake left at all, and
no one has a clue where it went. (Warn
ing: This move should not be tried at
home. My mother is a trained profession
al. And no mom jokes please, i.e. "Yeah,
your mom is a trained professional." Very
funny. Ha ha. I'm laughing. Really I am.)
Despite such progress, The Last Piece
goes uneaten, undivided and unnibbled at

today. Everyone wishes that they could
overcome the social stigma, but instead
they just say good night, the host wraps
The Piece poorly in tin foil, puts it in the
back of the fridge and throws it away
three weeks later. If only they had held a
raffle or sold off small portions or given it
to charity or just been plain selfish sons of
bitches like those damn Argentines, the
cake wouldn't have been wasted. Such is
the destiny of The Last Piece.
So next time you feel that social awk
wardness, be relieved that you're not the
only one suffering. Everyone is in the
same excruciating pain as you are. Don't
attempt to overpower it. Just accept it.
And understand that there are forces in
Nature that mere mortals will never be
able to overcome.
