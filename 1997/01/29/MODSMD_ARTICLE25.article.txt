# Turkish students present their side of Cyprus issue
## 
### 
As the executive committee of the
Turkish Students Association of Stan
ford University, we appreciate your
efforts to bring attention to Ananstas
sios Simonidis' "solution to Cyprus"
that he conveyed in Campbell Recital
Hall last Thursday (Friday's front
page). However, we would like to inform
you and your readers that Simonidis'
views are not at all representative of the
truth, which, in the case of Cyprus, nec
essarily has two sides to it.
First of all, the side that we repre
sent, as citizens of the Turkish Repub
lic of Northern Cyprus and The Repub
lic of Turkey, remembers the events of
1974 not as an "invasion," as your arti

cle states, but as a legal (by the 1960
Zurich and London treaties that stated
the active guarantorship of Turkey)
and necessary intervention by Turkey
to protect the safety of the Turkish-
Cypriot population and to restore peace
on the island.
Followers of the Cyprus question will
no doubt recall that five days before the
intervention, peace had come under
severe threat by a coup staged in Cyprus
by the junta ruling Greece in an attempt
to annex the island. Records indicate
that many Creek Cypriots were killed
during the fighting between junta sup
porters and the proponents of the
Greek-Cypriot government then in
power. In fact, most of the "1,600 miss
ing Greek Cypriots" that Simonidis
refers to were killed during this chaotic
five-day period before the Turkish army
came to the island.
Far from aggravating the situation,
the actions of the Turkish army swiftly
restored peace in Cyprus and, somewhat
ironically, may have led to the restora
tion of democracy in Greece, as the
junta ruling Greece stepped down a few
days after the Turkish intervention.
Second, we would like to react to
Simonidis' view that "Turkey's Islamic

government" and "increased militariza
tion" constitute "the chief barriers to
reunification." The Republic of Turkey
has been secular since 1924 and
remains the only truly secular, Mus
lim-majority country. Therefore, claims
that the Turkish government is an
Islamic one are absurd.
However, we do want to point out
that many spokespersons of the Greek
side have insisted on using this falla
cious statement to gain sympathy
among some Western policy-makers
who have made a habit of ringing alarm
bells even at the mere mention of Islam.
Also, we would like the readers of The
Daily to seek the signs of an "increased
militarization" on the Greek-Cypriot
side. A rather visible media item these
days has been the recent purchase from
Russia by the Greek Cypriots of an air
defense missile system that could poten
tially be used to hit targets not just in
the Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus, but also in Turkey.
Last but not least, we would like to
present our own view of what an
acceptable resolution to the Cyprus
problem might look like. We believe
that despite the past conflicts, a peace
ful settlement to the Cyprus question

is possible through good-willed negotia
tions, uniting the two sides in a bizonal
federal system, as agreed in principle in
the 1977 negotiations.
For this to happen, the Greek-Cypri
ot side should give up its dream of
uniting with Greece and acknowledge
the Turkish-Cypriot state as an equal
partner in a future federal solution.
They should continue the negotiations
to work out the details of a settlement
within the framework provided by the
offices of the secretary-general of the
United Nations.
Political maneuvers like pretending to
be the legitimate government of the
whole island and applying for European
Union membership on behalf of the
whole island will not produce any fruitful
results. Turkish Cypriots will never agree
to join an organization for which Greece
is a member and Turkey is not; neither
will they ever accept a solution that does
not include the active guarantorship of
Turkey. This would be an indirect route
to Greek annexation of Cyprus, against
which they have struggled all along.
