## Hoops hopes for victory at Cal 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
Don't let California's low pro
file deceive you.
The Golden Bears are for real,
and they're not conceding any
thing to No. 15 Stanford (13-3, 6-
2 Pacific 10 Conference) when the

two collide tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
Berkeley's Harmon Gym. The
1996-97 edition of Golden Bear
basketball may not live up to the
standard set by previous Cal
squads when it comes to garner
ing publicity, but the basketball is
as good as ever.
Gone from last season's team

is Todd Bozeman, dismissed from
his head coaching position follow
ing a string of underachieving
seasons and miscellaneous scan
dals. Gone are malcontent super
stars Jelani Gardner and
Tremaine Fowlkes (who trans
ferred to Pepperdine and Fresno
State, respectively), as is Shareef

Abdur-Rahim, last year's Pac- 10
freshman of the year who now
plies his trade for the NBA's Van
couver Grizzlies.
In their place are Ben Braun
— the Bears' mild-mannered but
highly regarded head coach —
and a cast of dependable seniors.
So while recruiting scandals,
player unrest and sexual-harass
ment suits may be a thing of the
past in Berkeley, the Bears con
tinue to give reporters something
to write about. Only now, it's on
the court.
Take a close look and you'll see
this team may be playing better
basketball than last year's. The
Golden Bears are 14-5 (5-3 Pac
-10) and unranked, but three of
their losses have come against
top-10 teams in No. 1 Kansas, No.
5 Maryland and No. 10 Arizona,
with another loss coming to first
place UCLA. They've beaten
quality opponents in lowa, Illi
nois and Oregon; they're a
respectable 2-2 on the road in the
Pac-10 (same as Stanford); and
they've won four in a row coming
off last Saturday's 28-point whip
ping of Washington.
The Bears will counter Stan
ford's inside presence with an
imposing front line of its own. Cal
starts 6-foot-9 Alfred Grigsby, a
rare sixth-year senior, and 6-foot
-10 Michael Stewart, and then
brings in 6-foot-10 towers Sean
Marks and Kenyon Jones off the
bench.
"We use a rotation of five big
guys, and they have four or five
big guys too so it's gonna be an
interesting challenge," said Stan
ford sophomore Peter Sauer. "I
think our big guys are just as tal
ented as theirs, if not better, espe
cially with [7-foot-l center Tim
Young] in the middle — I don't
know if they have anyone to
guard him. If we come to play, I
think we can get the job done."
Cal will also cause the Cardi
nal problems in the backcourt.
Point guards Prentice McGruder
and Anwar McQueen both play
tough defense, and off-guard Ed
Gray is one of the potent
weapons in the conference, if not
the nation. The 6-foot-3 senior
has scored 28 points or more in
six straight games and is cur
rently averaging a conference
best 23.9.
"Basically, what we're gonna
do is just try to deny him the
ball," said freshman swingman
Ryan Mendez. "Instead of just
letting him get it and then play
really hard defense on him, we're
gonna just try to not even let him
get the ball, try to take him out of
his rhythm and push him back
about 25 feet so he won't be able
to just catch and shoot it all the
time."
With the Pac-10 season at its
midpoint and a tough road trip
to Los Angeles ahead, tonight's
game is crucial for Stanford.
