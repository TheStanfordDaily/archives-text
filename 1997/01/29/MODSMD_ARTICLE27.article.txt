JLjLket."
It's words like the ones above
(spoken on national television by a
broadcaster at the Tennessee-
Stanford women's basketball game
on Dec. 15) that let me know that I
too, could one day have a career in
television broadcasting — especial-

ly in women's sports.
George Rambling (names have
been changed to protect the true
identities of embarrassed
sportscasters) and a few others
aside, men's sports has a solid
selection of sports personalities to
put in front of those cameras. Of
course nothing is perfect — I'm
sure you all enjoy those continual
references to Walton's glory days
and didn't laugh any harder than I
did at Madden's turkey. But let's
face it, for the most part the men
get their fair share of quality
broadcasters.
Again, I'm sure you're having
flashbacks of last year's Stanford-
California men's basketball game
when Raveling — er, I mean Ram
bling — connected the play of
freshman Shareef Abdur-Rahiin to
the success of the Vietnam War.
Or perhaps you're wondering if

he'll ever figure out that there is
an "r" in the name Brevin. In fact,
I have no doubt we could devote an
entire page to Raveling and still
not understand why (or if) this guy
gets paid to say the things he says.
But Raveling tends to be the
exception in broadcasting for
men's sports and unfortunately is
par for the course in women's
sports. There are some that know
what they're doing (Robin Roberts
is a favorite of mine), but the ones
that end up announcing those
national games of the week on
Sports Channel just kill me.
I don't know if you've ever had
the urge to completely mute the
volume on your television while
watching a sporting event, but I
have. In fact I even followed
through on that urge once or
twice. Most recently I did it at the
very end of the Stanford-San Fran
cisco game on Dec. 8.
I knew things were going to be
bad from the start when during
introduction of the starting line
ups, Larry Rosen made special
notice of the name Mulitauaopele.
He pronounced it fairly well and
added that they would "have fun"
saying that name all day. I thought
it was an acceptable comment to
make but his partner Cathy
Andruzzi followed it up with a loud
(aka yelling into the microphone)
"We'll just call her Omi! That's
what the team calls her."
I decided that maybe Andruzzi
just wasn't a funny person and
could be very knowledgeable at
basketball, but she quickly dis
pelled those rumors just minutes

into the game. I'm just going to
point out to anyone that doesn't
know that senior guard Kate Star
bird is a pretty impressive player in
the open court — you know, out on
the break, running the ball, push
ing it up the court. Well I guess not
everyone is aware because our
friend the sportscaster constantly
advised the unknowing Starbird to
slow down and set up the offense,
reminding viewers that setting up
the offense is just what the dribble
should be used for.
Let's just say I was happy Kate
wasn't listening, and by the end of
the game I wasn't listening either.
But the tragedy doesn't end with
basketball. A great portion of the
NCAA championship game for
women's volleyball on ESPN2 was
dedicated to the discussion
between Chris Marlowe and Maria
Barnes about the uniforms.
For those of you who didn't
catch the match it was a debate
over whether or not the uni's
should have sleeves. Marlowe
voted for sleeveless, saying that
most of the players pushed the
sleeves up anyway and that vvay
they could show off their "guns."
Granted, the Cardinal didn't
make the championship match
much of a contest, but I don't think
it would be that difficult to find
something to fill the airwaves with
that has a little more relevance to
the situation at hand. I guess it's a
good thing that we've moved from
comments like "and she's cute too"
to discussions about players' guns,
but I'm still wondering what

sleeves or a lack thereof had to do
with the national championship.
It's pretty ugly out there, and
I'm just a few short steps from
investing in a television without
sound. On the bright side, I'm
more confident that I could find a
job as a broadcaster for women's
sports. Unfortunately, I'm not a
former athlete or coach or some
body with connections. The one
thing I've got going for me is that I
would never say some of the idiotic
things I've heard on TV.
Here's a list of some of my
favorites:
1. "She dribbles past two defenders
and through a couple more then,
SHIMMY-SHIMMY-COCOA
POP, it's a basket."
2. "The dribble is used to set up the
offense. Excellent defense by Jami
la Wideman." (pronounced Wide-a
man)
3. "We'll just call her Omi."
4. "If they'd had him in Vietnam,
they'd have been out of there two
years earlier."
5. "Whoa momma, she's getting
hot now!"
6. "The Stanford team needs to
score more points than it allows."
7. "She doesn't have her sleeves
pushed up; she's just not with the
program."
8. "Knight seems to have an excel
lent sense for the game of basket
ball, Barry." (As if any of us were
really wondering.)
9. "He's just so tall and has grace
ful talent."
10. "It's nice when you have a 7-
footer throwing the ball to a 6-10er
with hands to get the ball
inbounds."

Robin would like to remind TV per
sonalities to get off the schnide.
