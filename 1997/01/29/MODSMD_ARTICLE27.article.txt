It's words like the ones above
(spoken on national television by a
broadcaster at the Tennessee-
Stanford women's basketball game
on Dec. 15) that let me know that I
too, could one day have a career in
television broadcasting — especial-

ly in women's sports.
George Rambling (names have
been changed to protect the true
identities of embarrassed
sportscasters) and a few others
aside, men's sports has a solid
selection of sports personalities to
put in front of those cameras. Of
course nothing is perfect — I'm
sure you all enjoy those continual
references to Walton's glory days
and didn't laugh any harder than I
did at Madden's turkey. But let's
face it, for the most part the men
get their fair share of quality
broadcasters.
Again, I'm sure you're having
flashbacks of last year's Stanford-
California men's basketball game
when Raveling — er, I mean Ram
bling — connected the play of
freshman Shareef Abdur-Rahiin to
the success of the Vietnam War.
Or perhaps you're wondering if

he'll ever figure out that there is
an "r" in the name Brevin. In fact,
I have no doubt we could devote an
entire page to Raveling and still
not understand why (or if) this guy
gets paid to say the things he says.
But Raveling tends to be the
exception in broadcasting for
men's sports and unfortunately is
par for the course in women's
sports. There are some that know
what they're doing (Robin Roberts
is a favorite of mine), but the ones
that end up announcing those
national games of the week on
Sports Channel just kill me.
I don't know if you've ever had
the urge to completely mute the
volume on your television while
watching a sporting event, but I
have. In fact I even followed
through on that urge once or
twice. Most recently I did it at the
very end of the Stanford-San Fran
cisco game on Dec. 8.
I knew things were going to be
bad from the start when during
introduction of the starting line
ups, Larry Rosen made special
notice of the name Mulitauaopele.
He pronounced it fairly well and
added that they would "have fun"
saying that name all day. I thought
it was an acceptable comment to
make but his partner Cathy
Andruzzi followed it up with a loud
(aka yelling into the microphone)
"We'll just call her Omi! That's
what the team calls her."
I decided that maybe Andruzzi
just wasn't a funny person and
could be very knowledgeable at
basketball, but she quickly dis
pelled those rumors just minutes
