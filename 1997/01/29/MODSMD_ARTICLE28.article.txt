# Women's tennis tramples Lions on home court
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The Stanford women's ten
nis squad's victory over Loyola
Marymount yesterday after
noon was so convincing that the
players needed to practice after
ward in order to complete their
workout.
Everybody was a winner at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium as
the No. 2 Cardinal (1-0) deliv
ered the Lions (2-1) an old-fash
ioned 9-0 whooping in its open
ing dual match.
"It turned out to be a good
match for us," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan.
"They were better than we
thought they would be, even
though the scores were sort of
lopsided. The matches were bet
ter contested than the score
might indicate."
It didn't take long for the
Cardinal to dispose of LMU as
each Stanford competitor took
her match in straight sets.
Senior co-captain Katie
Schlukebir debuted in the No. 1
singles spot and sent LMU's
Mara Colaizzi home with a 6-1,

6-2 defeat.
In the No. 2 spot, senior San
dra De Silva earned a 6-3, 6-2
win over Laura Gross while
freshman Anne Kremer, in her
dual-match debut as No. 3, had
little trouble with Anna Zaricki,
winning 6-1, 6-1.
The Cardinal sent two junior
Ail-Americans into action in the
second half of the singles line
up. At the No. 4 position, Ania
Bleszynski dropped the opening
three games in the first set to
Janina Bunker, but bounced
back to take the next 12 games
for a 6-3, 6-0 win.
Co-captain Julio Scott
refused to drop even a game at
the No. 5 singles slot, white
washing Lia Bunker 6-0, 6-0. In
the final singles match, fresh
man Teryn Ashley earned the
first dual-match triumph of her
career over Amy Labetich 6-1,
6-0.
"We usually don't put all of
our superstars in the lineup this
early in the season," Brennan
said. "But because this is our
first match of the year and our
only one before Arizona, we
couldn't afford not to. So we put
everyone in there, and they did
nicely."
Already having clinched the
victory, Stanford added insult to
injury by sweeping the doubles
matches as well. Bleszynski and
Scott cruised in an 8-1 win over
Colaizzi and Zaricki in the No. 1
doubles match. In the No. 2 spot,
Kremer and Ashley teamed up to
the tune of an 8-3 victory over
Gross and Kisic. Schlukebir and
senior Emily Burt completed the
sweep for the Cardinal with an 8-
1 win over Labetich and Bunker.
Noticeably absent from the
Stanford lineup against the Lions
was freshman Lilia Osterloh, who
took the match off due to a sore
shoulder. Osterloh is considered
questionable for Friday's match
against Arizona. If she does not
compete, Burt will likely substi
tute in doubles.
"We're not sure when Lilia is
going to come around," Brennan
said. "It would actually be really
nice to get her in doubles. That
would help a lot. Unfortunately,
you use that shoulder a lot in dou
bles with saves and overheads."
With two days remaining
before the Pacific 10 Conference
opener in Tucson, Brennan has
not yet secured a lineup. The
squad will hold challenge match
es before they leave for the
desert tomorrow for the next
day's match with the Wildcats
and Saturday's contest at Ari
zona State.
