The Stanford women's ten
nis squad's victory over Loyola
Marymount yesterday after
noon was so convincing that the
players needed to practice after
ward in order to complete their
workout.
Everybody was a winner at
the Stanford Tennis Stadium as
the No. 2 Cardinal (1-0) deliv
ered the Lions (2-1) an old-fash
ioned 9-0 whooping in its open
ing dual match.
"It turned out to be a good
match for us," said Stanford
head coach Frank Brennan.
"They were better than we
thought they would be, even

Senior co-captain Katie
Schlukebir debuted in the No. 1
singles spot and sent LMU's
Mara Colaizzi home with a 6-1,

6-2 defeat.
In the No. 2 spot, senior San

win over Laura Gross while

winning 6-1, 6-1.
The Cardinal sent two junior
Ail-Americans into action in the
second half of the singles line
up. At the No. 4 position, Ania
Bleszynski dropped the opening
three games in the first set to
Janina Bunker, but bounced
back to take the next 12 games
for a 6-3, 6-0 win.
Co-captain Julio Scott
refused to drop even a game at
the No. 5 singles slot, white
washing Lia Bunker 6-0, 6-0. In
the final singles match, fresh
man Teryn Ashley earned the
first dual-match triumph of her
career over Amy Labetich 6-1,
6-0.
"We usually don't put all of
our superstars in the lineup this
early in the season," Brennan
said. "But because this is our
first match of the year and our
