# In its own league
## Fencing flies high 
### Vanessa Arrington Editorial staff 
Men's and women's fencing,
ranked third in the country, made
their presence known last weekend
as they crushed the competition at
Cal State-Fullerton and Caltech in
Stanford's first matches of the sea
son.
The Cardinal men's team beat
Fullerton 27-0 on Titan turf Fri
day then garnered a second victory
(19-8) on Saturday when it faced
the Titans again at Caltech. The
Stanford men also defeated Cal
tech 25-2 and UC-San Diego 25-2
at the Saturday tournament.
The women quelled their oppo
nents as well, defeating Fullerton
26-6 Friday and 21-11 Saturday,
and Caltech 25-2 and UC-San
Diego 18-14.
The clean sweep should come as
no surprise, however, as Stanford
fencing sports a field of world
champions and hot new recruits.
Among the world-level competi
tors are team captain Timmy
Chang, Sean McClain and Alden

Clarke, as well as Alex Wood and
Monique deßruin, the latest fresh
man recruits. Other fencers to look
for include Lauren O'Brien and
Mary Barsanti.
"We didn't lose anyone last sea
son, and we won't lose anyone this
year," said Sherry Posthumus,
director of fencing. "It is a very
young team. And because we've
got some tremendous recruits, it
really increases our chances at
nationals."
During the weekend tourna
ments, deßruin, Chang and
Richard Hong remained undefeat
ed, winning every bout. A won
bout signifies that the winner suc
ceeded in executing five touches
against his or her opponent.
Men's collegiate fencing is bro
ken up into three squads: foil, epee
and saber. Each Cardinal men's
squad consists of three members.
In contrast, women's collegiate
fencing includes just the foil and
epee categories, and there are four
Stanford women on each squad.
