# President uses 'Tea and Cookies' to address ASSU campaign, Gupta decision
## 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
University President Gerhard Casper's quarterly
"Tea and More Cookies" session did not begin as
usual last night.
Before inviting questions from students at the
open meeting, Casper attacked the ASSU's "Univer
sity for Students" campaign, as well as recent student
criticism regarding the Stanford Fund and the issue
of a socially responsible endowment.
"It may be hard to believe, but university presi
dents too are human beings," he began.
Casper first expressed his disappointment with an
editorial in Monday's Stanford Review complaining
about his "Stanford Fund obsession" and an adver
tisement for the newspaper which referred to him as
"Fiihrer."
"In view of the crimes perpetrated by Hitler, the
Nazis and by Germans, I am utterly and completely
discouraged by the fact that there are Stanford stu
dents who believe it is funny to call me 'Fiihrer,' " he
said.
Casper also criticized the ASSU President's Of
fice's "campaign to reform the role of universities in
society." He agreed with one of the campaign's four
general principles, that "universities are fundamen
tally different from for-profit businesses."
"An institution that subsidizes both students and
research and can balance its books only because of
gifts from alumni and friends hardly meets the most
rudimentary expectations concerning profit maxi
mization," he said.
"To suggest that we are profit-maximizing ... is
simply ludicrous," he added. "The principle that uni
versities are fundamentally different from for-profit
businesses was not discovered by the leadership of
the ASSU."
Casper then addressed recent criticisms regarding
his commitment to the Stanford Fund and the issue
of a socially responsible endowment.
"I have worked very hard to establish the Stanford
Fund," he said. "It has nothing to
do with endowment.
"If students want to diminish fi
nancial aid funds for their succes
sors ... [or] deprive student organi
zations of support, the way to do it
is to fight the Stanford Fund," he
said.
After Casper's introduction,
several students brought up the
issue of Asst. Anthropology Prof.
Akhil Gupta's recent denial of
tenure.
"I do not know on what basis the
Gupta decision has been reached,"
Casper immediately acknowl
edged. He explained the process of
granting tenure, emphasizing that
he plays only a minor role in it.
"The provost will have the next
review if Prof. Gupta files griev
ances," Casper explained. "There is
no doubt that this will become my
concern," he admitted, but he
stressed that he must let the
process go through its stages.
Doctoral student Benjamin

Lawrance pointed out the effects of
Gupta's denial on students.
"Many graduate students don't
want to be at a university where the
entire faculty can unanimously
support a candidate [for tenure]
only to be overturned without any
explanation why," he said after the
event.
In response to concerns that the
Gupta decision reflects declining
support for interdisciplinary pro
grams, Casper responded, "I my
self have primarily been involved in
[interdisciplinary research], and
the University is not wavering in
its commitment to that."
Questioned about high prices at
the Bookstore, Casper emphasized
that it is an "independent entity."
"They have not let me in on the
mystery of their pricing policy,"
Casper said, adding that he was
proud of the Bookstore's prompt
ness in responding to a recent stu
dent complaint.
Doctoral student lan Sobieski
raised the issue of the University's
harshness in fining students who
file registration commitments or
study lists late.
University Registrar Roger

Printup, who was also in atten
dance, said "the process is under re
view by the Registrar's Office.
"We are trying to get to a situa
tion where you do not have to file
commitments," Printup said.
"Stanford is a very stable body —
about 90 percent graduate here. It
really does not make much sense to
me why we're asking whether you
are going to come back."
He also said "the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment is questioning whether we
should ask students to file study
lists."
In addition, junior Lisa Rubin,
president of the Intersorority
Council, presented a petition to
Casper signed by more than 200
sorority women calling for equal ac
cess to housing. Casper made no
further comment on the request.
When one student raised con
cern that the University offered no
adequate facility for students to
work out, especially when rain pre
vented jogging outdoors, Casper's
response was drowned in laughter.
"First of all, about the rain, I
have been working very hard," he
said.
