## Eating breakfast important in maintaining healthy diet Nutritionists advise that eating meal aids body in proper physical and mental functioning 
### Rollin Hu Contributing writer 
For far too many students,
breakfast has become a victim of
scheduling.
Sleepyheads who spring out of
bed five minutes before class and
skip a healthy meal are common.
According to nutritionists, how
ever, skipping breakfast may not

be a very smart move. It

may be one that leads

to short- and long-

term health prob-

lems.

In fact, of all
meals, breakfast

may be the
worst one to
skip. Lisa Cooper,

a nutritionist at
Cowell Student

Health Cen
ter, suggested

that not eat
ing breakfast

is like taking a

prolonged fast. "By

the time you finally get

to eat something, you are starv
ing, which leads to overeating,"
she said.
Cooper emphasized that exces
sive hunger resulting from skip
ping breakfast can lead to unwise
consumptive behavior. "When
you're that hungry, you'll eat
anything that's available," she

said. "You'll grab that dough-

nut, even though it may

not be healthy."

According to Coop
er, such irregular eat
ing practices can lead to
problems like unwanted

weight gain.
For athletes, eating
breakfast is especially
important.

Nancy Clark, a dieti

tian with
Sports Medicine

Systems of Boston,
pointed out that

athletes who pass

over the morning meal

"train less effectively,
suffer needless

fatigue and may per
form suboptimally."

Julie Tinker, a

freshman on the track

team, agreed. "When I don't
eat breakfast, I can always tell
at practice," she said. "I don't

have that energy."

Moreover, it has been clearly
proven that skipping breakfast
results in not only physiological
stress but decreased cognitive
capabilities. According to the
October 1995 issue of the Journal
of the American Dietetic Associa
tion, not eating breakfast may
interfere with mental functions
such as vigilance and memory.
Data presented in the article

indicate

that the brain is espe-

cially sensitive to varia-

tions in nutrient supplies. Vari-

ations in the availability of nutri
ents can adversely affect "speed
and accuracy of information
retrieval."
Physiologically, the reason for
these adverse effects is easy to
understand.
During the night, the body and
brain slow down, and physical
regulatory mechanisms kick in to

provide the

body with a constant supply

of fuel. Upon awakening, howev

er, metabolism revs back up

and requires nutrient
i intake to maintain a
constant level of glucose.
Unless the body gets this

intake in the form of breakfast,
both glucose and insulin levels
fall, affecting the entire body and
particularly the brain.
In studies involving young
schoolchildren, those given
breakfast performed significantly
better on late morning tests than
those not given breakfast. People

who don't eat breakfast "tend to
have trouble concentrating and
work or study less efficiently in
the late morning," Clark said.
Given the clear dangers of
skipping the morning meal, a sur
prising number of people contin
ue to do so. For those who claim
they have no time, Clark suggest
ed that a "breakfast on the run,"
like a cheese sandwich on the way
to school or yogurt and a muffin
during a morning break, is better
than nothing.
"The most important thing is
that you eat it," she said.
Another excuse for not eating
breakfast is the refrain, "I'm not
hungry in the morning."
Not feeling hungry in the morn
ings results from the bad habit of

snacking at bedtime. Habitual
nighttime munching can lead
to weight gain if you overeat,
dietary deficiencies if you
replace a wholesome breakfast
with nutritionally poor snacks
and muscular fatigue if you eat
inadequate carbohydrates

Clark warned.
Even if on a diet, eating a good
breakfast and a smaller dinner
can be a better way to lose
weight, Clark said. She quoted

research indicating that calo
ries from food eaten during the

day were more likely to be
burned off than calories taken lr
later in the evening.

While there is no excuse for
not eating breakfast, some break
fasts are definitely better than
others. Foods loaded with carbo
hydrates are the best choices.
Bagels and cereal with milk
are traditional, healthy choices,
Cooper said. But they are not the
only options. She suggested that
pizza or other leftovers from din-

ner can be good

choices
because they
have many

elements
from differ
ent food

groups.
No matter

what kinds of

breakfast you choose, Cooper

offered the following tip:
"Just think about nutri
tional balance — get
something that falls
within the food pyra
mid."
While eating nothing

is the worst case scenario,
eating too much at break-

fast can be bad for you as well,
she warned.
"Breakfast should not be
too high in calories or fat so it

won't slow you down,"
Cooper said. "An adequate

breakfast is around 500 calo
ries, with less than 30 percent of
the calories from fat."
