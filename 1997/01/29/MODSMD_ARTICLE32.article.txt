bypassing angioplasty — making a decision

Everyone faces tough choices every day — what to
wear, what to eat, even when to go to bed. But what if
you were faced with the difficult and uncomfortable
choice between angioplasty and open-heart surgery?
As the result of a recent study led by Health
Research and Policy Prof. Mark Hlatky, the choice may
be easier for patients undergoing the trauma of heart
disease.

The results of a study, published in the Jan. 9 iss j.e of the New
England Journal of Medicine, indicates that heart bypass surgery
would be the better option for those with three blocked vessels, while
the less invasive balloon angioplasty procedure would be better for
those with only one blocked vessel.
For those with two blocked vessels, Hlatky said, "The medical
results are so close that how the patient feels about the two options
should be given the most weight in the decision."
Angioplasty causes less discomfort initially but may require a sec
ond angioplasty or heart bypass procedure later on. Heart bypass
surgery leads to higher chances of full recovery but requires a longer
hospital stay and recovery time.
"In the long run ... both methods were comparable in terms of
overall rates of death and subsequent heart attacks," he said.
The study was done in collaboration with clinical centers around
the country; it involved 934 patients, 465 of which had angioplasties
and 469 of which had heart bypass surgeries.

Identifying black holes

Asst. Physics Prof. Roger Romani has fixed his eyes
on what could be the closest black hole to the solar sys
tem. Collaborating with researchers from four Texas
universities, Romani hopes to use a new telescope to
identify such near-system black holes.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope (IIET), the center
piece of the new project, took about five years to devel-

op, Romani said. It will look for sudden outbursts of
energy corresponding to matter from "flaring stars" being trans
ferred to a black hole.
Starting with a list of more than 300 such flaring stars observed
since the 1800s, the observations from HET token last month have
allowed Romani and his collaborators to narrow the list of potential
black holes to about 10.
Emphasizing the experimental nature of this project, Romani said
full analysis of the data will most likely take place this summer, as
HET is fine-tuned for more readings.
"My hope is that one or two [of the flaring stars] will be a black
hole," he said.
