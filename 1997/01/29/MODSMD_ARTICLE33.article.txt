# Rocks clue to copper-deposit formation
## 
### Julie Choe Contributing writer 
Few people can take the heat of
working a mile below the Earth's
surface.
Kurt Friehauf, a doctoral stu
dent in geological and environ
mental sciences, is one who can,
having spent the last six years
studying rocks whose tempera
tures can read 1,250 degrees
Fahrenheit at their subsurface
location.
Friehauf is studying the mech
anism of formation of copper ore
deposits, particularly the Superi
or mine district in Arizona.
In that district, "there are a
stack of limestones that are simi
lar in appearance, but the ore
only form in certain beds," he
said. These sheets of rock are all
considered limestones with very
slight variations.

"My thesis is in studying what
the chemical mechanisms were
for converting the limestone into
high-grade copper ore and what
caused the focusing of fluids to
form ore bodies in specific sites,"
said Friehauf, who spent 11
months working underground.
A large body of copper ore
forms when ore fluids at a site
float up the cracks in the ground
and react with the- limestones.
HoweVer, tluid only forms
an ore body with a specific type of
limestone bed.
According to doctoral student
Peter Redmond, a new member of
the Stanford research group,
"Metals can be thought of as
being dispersed all over through
all rock masses, but geological
processes will usually concentrate
those metals in one place."
The origin of the ore fluids can
point to copper ore. If the feeder
veins, or the paths of the ore flu
ids, are located, it can give
researchers further hints as to
which part of the country or even
counties on which to focus.
"If we know what caused this
limestone to be replaced instead
of others, we know what kinds of
limestones to look for that are
intersected by these feeder veins
that occur in (other) parts of the
country," Friehauf said.
The key to deducing the mech
anisms of ore body formation
involves using methods such as
geological mapping, thermody
namic modeling, minerology and
microsopy.
The large cracks, called feeder
cracks or veins, can be located
using geological maps. This pro
cess involves the collection of
many rock types, followed by
careful tracking of the different
shapes and orientations of rocks
as well as their relative ages
because this can hint at how the
ore deposits formed over time.
"From this map, geologists can
infer how those rocks occured,"
Redmond explained. "If you find
one rock on top of another, you
can infer that that is the sort of
sequence of how the rocks

occurred or if those rocks are sed
iments or igneous rocks, you can
infer the environment that they
formed in."
More specifically, "We try our
best to figure out the relative tim
ing of the different rocks ... by
looking at the cross-cutting rela
tionships between them,"
Friehauf added.
The identification and differ
entiation of the rock types that
are collected are carried out in the
lab using polarized light micro
scopes. Before Friehauf was able
to locate the copper ore deposits,
he first had to figure out the dif
ferent mineral types of the col
lected rocks.
"Minerals have an unusual
property such that they have dif
ferent refractive indices, or differ
ent ways of transmitting light
that vary depending on the orien
tation within the crystal,"
Friehauf said.

The difference between two
minerals can be detected by com
paring the different colors and
shapes that are emitted when the
microscope stage is rotated while
focusing on the same exact spot
"W r e spend a lot of time studying
such kaleidoscopes, trying to
ure out what mineral it
Friehauf said.
Both the ore fluids and the
minerals that precipitate with
them are analyzed because a tluid
will precipitate a mineral that is
characteristic of that fluid. In
other words, "Each fluid is said to
be in equilibrium with different
mineral assemblages," Friehauf
said.
Therefore, with the knowledge
of the relative timing of the differ
ent minerals and with the use of
thermodynamics, the fluid com
position that precipitated each of

the minerals can be deduced. In
addition, the timing relationships
of how the minerals changed can
also hint at how the fluids
changed.

"If ore deposits form from hot
water solutions that carry metals
from one place and deposit them
somewhere else, we want to know,
first of all, what caused that fluid
to get metals in one place and then
what caused it to precipitate met
als somewhere else," Friehauf
said.
The work is all conceptual and

theoretical. "The research group
here has very close ties with indus
try because there are companies
whose sole purpose of existing is to
find ore deposits and they do it in a
very commercial way," Redmond
explained. "Our job is to develop the
theory; it is up to the exploration
companies to go apply the theories
that our research develops."
