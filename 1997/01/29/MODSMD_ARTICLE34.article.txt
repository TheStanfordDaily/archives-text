A .Now don't just
• ignore this article
because you think you
already know the
answer. Chances are

you don't.
Most people think the pressure exerted
on the ice by the ice skating blades lowers
the melting point of the ice and causes a
small layer of water to be formed under the
blades, thereby lowering friction and
enabling easy gliding.
It's a good theory, and if it were the real
reason ice skating were possible, then it
wouldn't be so bad that every single chem
istry teacher in the world tells it to stu
dents. The problem is, though, that no one
ever bothers to do the calculations to see if
this works.

First, it helps to understand why people
think ice melts under pressure.
It is true that increasing the pressure on
ice will lower its melting / freezing point.
This is because cold, liquid water is denser
than ice — water expands when it freezes.
That explains why ice floats on water, soda
cans explode in the freezer and I'm writing
this article.
Ice is less dense because water molecules
have to form up into a nice, orderly lattice,
while liquid water is a jumble of molecules,
clinging together like they have nothing
else left in the world to live for.
When you put pressure on ice, you're
essentially trying to squeeze it into a small
er space. Because water takes up less space
than ice, the liquid form becomes more
favored than the solid when pressure is
increased.
The more pressure that is applied, the
greater this inclination becomes. The prop
erty manifests itself in the lowering of the
freezing point when ice is exposed to high
er pressures.
That means that under higher pres

sures, you have to get the water colder to
freeze it. It also means that you can cause
ice to melt by exerting enough pressure on
it.
The problem is that it requires enor
mous pressures to lower the freezing point
of water significantly. If you do the calcula
tions, it turns out that you need to apply a
pressure 120 times stronger than atmo
spheric pressure just to lower the freezing
point of water by 1 degree Celsius. If you
don't speak metric, that's about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit.
Average-sized people using average
skates probably exert about 10 atmo
spheres of pressure under their skates,
which only leads to a freezing point lower
ing of one-tenth of a degree Celsius.
According to this theory, you would
only be able to skate on ice that was just
below freezing, which is obviously not
right. Plus, light objects, like hockey pucks,
seem to have no problem gliding across the
ice.
This means there must be some other
factors which allow you to ice skate. One

possible explanation is that the friction
between the ice and the front edge of the
skate produce enough heat to create a trail
of water for you to skate on.
Another, more intriguing possibility is a
phenomenon known as surface melting.
On the surface of ice, water behaves a little
bit differently because it's not completely
surrounded by its nice orderly lattice but
instead has parts exposed to the rest of the
world.
Documentation shows that on the sur
face of ice there is a layer of liquid water,
down to a temperature of about -10
degrees Celsius (-14 degrees Fahrenheit).
The surface melting is even more pro
nounced when the ice is in contact with the
metal blade of the skate.
So it is correct that water reduces the
friction between the skate and the ice, but
the water is not there because of increased
pressure applied to the ice.
Now go ahead and gloat in front of all
your friends who didn't read this article
and continue to hold antiquated ideas
about ice skating. And maybe at the same

time you should reconsider being friends
with people who don't read the Science
Bug.
