# S. African group honors Kennedy
## 
### David Stein Staff writer 
Former University President Donald Kennedy will
be commended tonight for his efforts to improve
health care for victims of South African apartheid.
Kennedy, the Bing Professor of Environmental
Sciences, will be the guest of honor at a San Francisco
dinner sponsored by Medical Education for South
African Blacks, a group which he chaired for a decade.
The group is a nonprofit organization of Ameri
cans and South Africans devoted to making the health
care system of a country still recovering from en
trenched racism more accessible to all people.
"Right now there are really two health care sys
tems in South Africa, even after apartheid," Kennedy
said. "There is a Third World health care system and
an industrial world system.
"Whites get access to the latter, while non-whites
are the ones using the former," he added.
Recognizing the unfairness of a system which ide
ally should harbor no prejudice, Kennedy assumed
the chairmanship of the medical education group in
1986 while he served as Stanford's president.
Although occupied with Stanford issues at the
time, Kennedy said most presidents take on outside
interests about which they care deeply.
In a recent letter to the group, South African Pres
ident Nelson Mandela commended Kennedy for his

contributions.
"That [Kennedy] could include South Africa
among his many concerns speaks to the breadth of his
vision and the generosity of his spirit," Mandela
wrote.
During his chairmanship, Kennedy was often chal
lenged by critics who thought Stanford should divest
all interests with companies that did business with an
apartheid regime.
Rather than supporting a "blanket divestment" of
interests, Kennedy said he thought the best way of
making a contribution to the fight against apartheid
was through a case-by-case review of interests and by
joining Medical Education for South African Blacks.
Since 1987, the group has provided scholarships to
more than 2,000 black students at South African uni
versities and supported training programs for rural
nurses in midwifery and neonatal care.
The dinner tonight will also mark the establish
ment of the Donald Kennedy Fund, a $500,000 en
dowment that will support fellowships in infectious
disease research.
"I am especially pleased that [Medical Education
for South African Blacks] has chosen to honor Dr.
Kennedy by establishing a fund that will help young
black researchers in the fight against infectious dis
eases like AIDS and tuberculosis," Mandela wrote.
"As a victim of TB myself, this is an area very close to
my heart."
