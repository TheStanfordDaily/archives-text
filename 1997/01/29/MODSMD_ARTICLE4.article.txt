# Frosh rejuvenates sumie art form
## 
### Mariko Hayashibara 
Japanese monks never imagined trumpeters, swimmers
or jazz singers appearing on the white rice papers used in
sumie, or Japanese brush painting.
But freshman Drue Kataoka, a professional sumie
artist, paints jazz, tango and athletes in addition to the
more traditional tea gardens, bamboo and temples.
Kataoka, 19, was born in Tokyo to an American mother
and a Japanese father. Her multicultural heritage is re
flected in her art, in which she explores ways to link Japan
ese traditions to Western culture.
"It struck me one night to find a powerful relationship
between jazz and sumie " said Kataoka, who has been
studying sumie since she was 7.
Sumie is a 2,000-year-old art form which was originally
practiced in Japanese monasteries.
As the word sumie — black ink — implies, its form is
mainly black and white. How long the artist grinds the
black ink determines the shadow of the subject.
"The ink has to be black enough," said Kataoka, who
usually grinds the inks for about 40 minutes. "I often fin
ish one ink in a day, and an ink costs over $100."
The main difference between sumie and other forms of
painting is the stroke. In sumie, the subject is distilled to
its essence in only one or two strokes, whereas Western
and Chinese painting allow many strokes.
"The more you take away, the more you have," said
Kataoka.
"In sumie, one mistake can ruin an entire work," she
added. "To paint in one stroke, you have to know the exact
proportion of the subject and pick up the shading very care
fully."
Kataoka noted that in sumie, the artist makes no pencil
sketch before painting. Therefore, intense concentration
and attention to detail are required in order to capture the
essence of a subject.
"You can't erase them," Kataoka said. "But in oil paint
ing, you may paint over the canvas again and again."
According to Kataoka, the precision of sumie is similar
to that required of jazz artists. "Both have only one
chance," she said. "Painting over black ink into the expen
sive Japanese traditional papers is as impossible as going
back to a jazz concert and changing what was played in peo
ple's mind."
After 12yearsofstudyingsam/ewith her master sensei,
Marjorie Yamanaka Iseke, Kataoka received the han, a
signature stamp with her artistic name carved into it. The
stamp signifies professional status.
Kataoka is currently exhibiting "Explosive Movement,"
a series of paintings of Stanford athletes, on the second
floor of the Arrillaga Family Sports Center. At the end of
this month, Kataoka will be displaying her work at the Cof
fee House. "Co Ho Blues" is a series of paintings of campus
jazz musicians.
Kataoka's work has earned the praise of many around
campus.
"I like the style. It's very simple and unique," said ten-

nis coach Dick Gould. "You don't
see many paintings focused on
sports."
Her mentor also was full of
praise. "I think what she is doing
is terrific," Iseke said. "Her

painting is full of energy and at
the same time, her strokes are
still traditional."
Not surprisingly, Kataoka is
an advocate for preserving and
promoting art. She is committed
to bringing art to both the young
and old.
"Art is always the first thing
the government tries to cut
spending for," she said. "They

should support art. Art is the glue
that connects everybody."
That's one of the reasons why
Kataoka is considering a major in
computer science.
"Computer science and art
seem like opposites, but in fact
they are not," she said "The In
ternet allows you to expose young
people to different forms. The In
ternet is a tool to promote arts."
