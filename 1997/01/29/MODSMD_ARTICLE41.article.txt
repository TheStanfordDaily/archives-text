# Menlo Park residents offer opinions on Sand Hill project

Menlo Park residents questioned whether Stan
ford's proposed Sand Hill Road project will prove
beneficial to their community at a packed Menlo
Park City Council meeting last night.
The meeting came a day after Palo Alto residents
voiced strong support for the project to their city
council.
If approved, the Stanford project will widen Sand
Hill Road and extend it to El Camino Real, build se
nior housing and apartment complexes on West cam
pus and expand the Stanford Shopping Center. Sand
Hill Road, whose two lanes now overflow with traffic
during rush hours, will be made into four lanes.
Last night's 2 1/2-hour Menlo Park meeting drew
more than 200 citizens. Many of their comments fo
cused on whether the project will alleviate the al
ready-saturated traffic conditions in the area or add
to the intensity.
Many also argued that the project will have nega
tive ecological effects and add to pollution and noise
in the area, destroying the cultural aspects of the re
gion.
"Please stop this project," said Menlo Park resi
dent Victor Lovell. "Stop it by any means possible. If
necessary, use aggressive litigation. No way is there
going to be any meaningful negotiation after [Mon
day night's] Palo Alto council meeting."
If the Palo Alto City Council approves the state-re
quired environmental impact report assessing the ef
fects of the project and is therefore able to give it the
go-ahead, Stanford will foot the entire $341 million
bill.
"Stanford is offering to provide more lanes at no
price," resident Erika Bailey said. "But we will pay a
price. Widening the Sand Hill Road is a temporary so
lution. It is doubtful this project can accommodate all
the new traffic that will be drawn by new medical re
search centers, the building of housing and apart

ments and the expansion of the shopping center."
The project's magnitude makes it hard to specu
late end results, and some residents said they fear the
area will undergo a drastic change into urbanism.
Menlo Park resident Robert Cohn, a Stanford
emeritus professor of French literature, said he has
seen the University become "more of a factory" dur
ing his 30-plus years of teaching.
"When I first came to the University, it was closer
to my idea of a farm," Cohn said. "Stanford has be
come distorted in its purpose. I suspect the air will be
unbreathable."
Resident Don Brawner said the project was "a
cash cow for private developers deeply connected to
the University" through organizations such as the
Board of Trustees, fraternities and the athletic
board.
"It has nothing to do with Stanford," he added.
However, not all the comments last night were
negative. Some residents said the University is doing
its best to serve the various needs and interests of the
community.
"We recognize the adjustments Stanford has
made to the original proposal," resident Mary Kneip
said.
In an effort to lessen the project's negative im
pacts on the neighborhood, the University changed
the apartment site plan, reduced the size of the se
nior housing project without reducing the number of
units, widened the setback from the nearby creek
and moved the proposed shopping center parking
structure to the south side of the development.
Still others last night asserted that the area's pre
sent situation desperately calls for the project's com
pletion.
In a letter to the city council, Woodside resident
Alf Carlson said the project will address the need for
senior housing and relieve congestion on Sand Hill
Road.
The Menlo Park City Council will meet again
tonight to discuss the project further.
