# Course guide would be more complete
## Organizers stress need to include quantitative data 
### Marcella Bernhard Contributing writer 
Quantitative data from course evalua
tion forms may increase the accuracy of
reviews in the ASSU course guide, its or
ganizers say.
The Faculty Senate voted last week
not to encourage the School of Humani
ties and Sciences to release such data, by
which students give a numerical rank to
the structure, workload and teaching in a
course. Currently, only qualitative com
ments from the evaluation forms are
available for the ASSU's use in its online
guide.
It would benefit professors to have
quantitative information included in the
guide, said sophomore Douglas Bloom,
one of the creators and current managers
of the course guide.
"The quantitative information (ei
ther) would show that there is no bias to

the comments or would expose any bias
that might exist," Bloom said.
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy, who presented the legislation that
would have encouraged deans to release
the information, said allowing the guide
to publish student comments but not the
accompanying quantitative data can cre
ate an inaccurate portrayal of courses.
"It is possible the negative quotes
which are selected could overshadow a
review of a course that is positive over
all," Abernethv said "Releasing quanti
tative data would provide more useful in
formation."
Bloom and sophomore Toll Kuznets,
another course guide manager, said the
guide's inability to use the quantitative
data conflicts with a verbal agreement
that they received in September from
Ellen Woods, assistant vice provost of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
Woods said, however, the Uni
versity is still operating under the
previous legislation from 1983,
which states that no information
from course evaluation forms can
be released to students.
Woods has negotiated with the
ASSU previously about what infor
mation could theoretically be re
leased, but she said that "until the
new legislation is passed, no infor
mation [besides the qualitative
portion] can be released."
The Faculty Senate's Commit
tee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement currently is revising
the 1983 policy, but its proposed
changes presented at last Thurs
day's senate meeting were sent
back to the committee for revi
sion.
One of the committee's pro
posed changes suggests that deans
release some quantitative informa
tion. Abernethy's legislation was
an amendment to the proposal. It
strengthened the language to rec

ommend releasing "sufficient
quantitative information" to the
ASSU; the amendment was nar
rowly voted down 14-13.
Some professors are uncomfort
able with the idea that tabulated
information would be broadly dis
tributed to the public, said ASSU
Senator Doug Natelson.
Physics Prof. Mason Yearian,
chair of the senate committee', said
the next proposal will not recom
mend how much information the
deans should release.
"This is really for the deans to
decide," Yearian said. "It is not the
place of the Faculty Senate to tell
the deans what to do."
In the meantime, the course
guide is expanding rapidly. Forty
classes offered last spring quarter
were reviewed, and reviews of more
will be available online by next
week, Bloom said.
The online course guide was
conceived by Bloom and Kuznets
during their freshman year. They
were referred to then-ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents member Rich
Stolz, who was interested in start
ing a course guide under the aus
pices of the ASSU.
The guide currently receives
$3,000 in funding from the ASSU

president's discretionary fund.
According to Bloom, the course
guide uses a set formula to deter
mine which comments are included
its World Wide Web site. Bloom and
Kuznets read every form and di
vide student comments on the
basis of whether they are positive,
negative or indifferent. A ratio of
how many times each type of com
ment appears is used to determine
what comments are included in the
course guide.
"The comments are overwhelm
ingly positive," Bloom said. "I have
yet to see a form saying 'this pro
fessor sucks.' "
The course guide also abides by
set guidelines, delineating be
tween information that is submit
ted through the Web site and in
formation from evaluations.
Bloom also said they screen out po
tentially libelous material.
The quantitative information
could not be misused by outside
persons, Bloom added, because
the Web site, which has an elec
tronic lock, can only be accessed by
members of the community who
have a Leland or Forsythe ac
count.
"The problem is moot," Bloom
said.
