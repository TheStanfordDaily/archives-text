# Course guide would be more complete
## Organizers stress need to include quantitative data

Quantitative data from course evalua

reviews in the ASSU course guide, its or
ganizers say.
The Faculty Senate voted last week
not to encourage the School of Humani
ties and Sciences to release such data, by
which students give a numerical rank to
the structure, workload and teaching in a
course. Currently, only qualitative com
ments from the evaluation forms are
available for the ASSU's use in its online
guide.
It would benefit professors to have
quantitative information included in the
guide, said sophomore Douglas Bloom,
one of the creators and current managers
of the course guide.
"The quantitative information (ei
ther) would show that there is no bias to

the comments or would expose any bias
that might exist," Bloom said.
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy, who presented the legislation that
would have encouraged deans to release
the information, said allowing the guide
to publish student comments but not the
accompanying quantitative data can cre
ate an inaccurate portrayal of courses.
"It is possible the negative quotes
which are selected could overshadow a
review of a course that is positive over
all," Abernethv said "Releasing quanti
tative data would provide more useful in
formation."
Bloom and sophomore Toll Kuznets,
another course guide manager, said the
guide's inability to use the quantitative
data conflicts with a verbal agreement
that they received in September from
Ellen Woods, assistant vice provost of the
