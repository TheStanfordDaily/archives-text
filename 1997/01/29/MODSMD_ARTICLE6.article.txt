ASSU Senator Bruce Gibney had au

The bill will be considered again at
next week's meeting.

distributing general funds to student
groups.
Jackson, appearing before the senate
in open forum, reassured senators that
he would conduct himself without bias.
"I am, in fact, an editor emeritus,
which means that I served as editor," he
said. "I am just an occasional contribu-
