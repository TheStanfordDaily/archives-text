# Vote on ROTC bill delayed
## 
### Patrick Bernhardt Staff writer 
In a behind-the-scenes power plav by
ASSU President Bill Shen, the senate
lost quorum before considering its most
controversial piece of legislation this
school year at last night's meeting.
ASSU Senator Bruce Gibney had au
thored a bill encouraging the adminis
tration to invite the U.S. Department of
Defense's Reserve Officer Training
Corps program back to the Stanford
campus. The program left campus more
than 20 years ago amidst student
protest.
Outrage over the proposal spread
across campus e-mail newsgroups as
students argued that the military main
tains a policy discriminating against
gays, lesbians and bisexuals. In the sen
ate, the bill's primary detractors are
Shen and members of the People's Plat
form political party.
When it became uncertain whether
Shen would have sufficient votes to de
feat the bill, he stalled the proceedings

after inducing members of the platform
to leave the meeting. In the absence of
ASSU Senators Fern Mechlowitz, Soma
Gonzales and Celia Garcia, attendance
fell below the number needed to conduct
business and the senate adjourned.
The bill will be considered again at
next week's meeting.
In other business, the senate ap
proved the appointment of junior Eric
Jackson and senior Reginald RufTin to
the ASSU Program Board.
Jackson's nomination had been sub
ject to intense debate last week when
ASSU Senator Alane Murdock objected
to placing a former Stanford Review ed
itor in chief on the body responsible for
distributing general funds to student
groups.
Jackson, appearing before the senate
in open forum, reassured senators that
he would conduct himself without bias.
"I am, in fact, an editor emeritus,
which means that I served as editor," he
said. "I am just an occasional contribu-
tor and a trouble-shooter, but I am
not salaried."
The senate concurred with the
sentiments of Gibney and ASSU
Senator Doug Natelson. Gibney
is a regular contributor to The
Review.
"If a person gives us their word
that their personal opinions are
not going to affect their profes
sional decisions, we should take

them at their word," Natelson said
while debating the issue last week.
The senate also approved long
considered changes to the bylaws
governing the special- and gener
al-fee process.
"Umbrella organizations" —
such as MEChA, a Chicano / Lati
no student group, which apply for
funding on behalf of a collective
of similarly focused smaller
groups — will now be able to
apply for special and general fees.
One treasurer will manage all
funds granted.
The changes increase the

amount of general-fee funding for
which an umbrella organization
that loses its special-fee request is
eligible.
According to ASSU Senate
Deputy Chair Joe Freund, the al
terations "are just making iegal a
process that goes on every year."
The senate started half an hour
late after Senate Chair Don Aing
worth, at the suggestion of ASSU
Vice President Nick Thompson,
provided food from Taco Bell — a
subsidiary of PepsiCo — to cele
brate that company's decision to
abandon its operations in Burma.
