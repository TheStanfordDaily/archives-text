This is how you develop an obsession: You know someone — say,
a boy — and think nothing about him one way or the other. Then you
have some interaction that's kind of ambiguous. He seems maybe in
terested, but you're not sure how you feel. Then he pays absolutely no
attention to you for days and days, and you're thinking, "Does he not like
me anymore? Did he like me to begin with? Why does he not like me?"
and then you're not even thinking about his feelings, you're just thinking
about him. You're wondering when you'll next see each other and how
you'll both act and what you should say. And then, it's happened. You're
obsessed. (My roommate explained that to me.)
Send your own roommate's explanations about life to intermis
sion@daily, but don't invest too much time in them because we're
changing editors and classies might never be printed again. Oh well.
