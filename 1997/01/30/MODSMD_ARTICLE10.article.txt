# Marijuana debated
## Journal says federal officials 'out of step' with public 
### 
BOSTON (AP) — The New England Jour
nal of Medicine has come out in favor of
allowing doctors to prescribe marijuana for
medical purposes, calling the threat of gov
ernment sanctions "misguided, heavy-hand
ed and inhumane."
"Whatever their reasons, federal officials
are out of step with the public," Editor
Jerome Kassirer wrote in an editorial in
today's issue. The journal is one of the world's
most prestigious medical publications.
Alter voters in Arizona and California
passed propositions letting doctors prescribe
pot for medical uses, Attorney General Janet
Reno said doctors who do this could lose their
prescription-writing privileges, be excluded
from Medicare and Medicaid and even be
prosecuted.

Some doctors believe marijuana can
relieve internal eye pressure in glaucoma,
control nausea in cancer patients on
chemotherapy and combat the severe weight
loss seen in AIDS patients. However, admin
istration officials note that such uses of mar
ijuana have not been proven.
Kassirer said marijuana is safer than some
drugs used legally for some of the same con
ditions, such as morphine. Furthermore, he
said experiments to prove marijuana's value
would be hard to do because of the difficulty
of measuring nausea and similar sensations.
"What really counts for a therapy with
this kind of safety margin is whether a seri
ously ill patient feels relief as a result <rf the
intervention, not whether a controlled trial
'proves' its efficacy," Kassirer wrote.
