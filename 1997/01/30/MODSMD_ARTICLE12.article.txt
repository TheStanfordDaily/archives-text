What's the frequency, Kenneth?
NEW YORK (AP) — The mystery may be solved: Dan
Rather has identified the man he says beat him up on the
street in 1986 while demanding to know, "Kenneth, what is
the frequency?"
The CBS anchorman said his assailant was William Tager,
now in prison for killing an NBC stagehand outside the

"Today" show in 1994.
Tager was convinced the media had him under surveil
lance and were beaming hostile messages to him, and he
demanded that Rather tell him the frequency being used,
according to a forensic psychiatrist who examined Tager after
the NBC shooting.
It is still unclear why Rather's attacker apparently called
him Kenneth.
