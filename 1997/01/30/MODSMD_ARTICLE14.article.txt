All course evaluation data
should be released to give
students complete picture

Knowledge is power,
and those who have it tend
to guard it carefully. Take
the example of what is currently
transpiring between students who
want to establish a course rating
guide and members of the Faculty
Senate, who want to control what
goes into its pages.
When it comes to course selec
tion, Stanford students are lucki
er than most â€” we have a two
week shopping period at the
beginning of each quarter when
we can check out any course we
want. Still, many students feel
helpless when they try to defini
tively decide on their courses,
especially when they venture into
unknown academic fields.
The ASSU's proposal to create
a comprehensive student course
guide would be a boon to all stu
dents. Students at dozens of col
leges across the country, includ
ing our friends at Harvard Uni
versity, benefit from the informa
tion they get from student course
guides. The only thing stopping
the ASSU from producing a qual
ity guide is an old clause in a Fac
ulty Senate bill. Senate legisla
tion from 1983 states that no
quantitative information from
course evaluation forms can be
released to students.
In practice, that means depart
ments are able to release the com
ments students write on evalua
tion forms, but they are prohibit
ed from releasing the results of
those questions that ask students
to rate professors and courses on a
scale of one to five.
The senate almost passed a res
olution last week that would have
scrapped the old law and allowed
the release of some quantitative
data upon the dean's approval.
But last-minute reservations by a
couple of faculty members about

an amendment to encourage the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences to release the data resulted
in a 14-13 negative vote. The orig
inal bill was subsequently with
drawn, and the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment plans to redraft it.
For students' sake, we hope the
committee gets down to business
quickly, builds the requisite facul
ty support and reintroduces the
bill as soon as possible.
Some professors, it seems, are
hesitant to have all of the quanti
tative data released, and Physics
Prof. Mason Yearian objected to
the senate butting in on what
ought to be a decision of the dean.
However, there must be senate
legislative action to overturn the
1983 law. As for the fear that some
professors will be unfairly slan
dered by student evaluations, that
is only further reason for releas
ing the quantitative information.
If only comments are given to the
ASSU, then course guide editors
could pick and choose comments
reflecting their own biases. The
quantitative data is important
precisely because it is an average
of student opinion.
Stanford administrators and
faculty would be wise to follow
the example of Harvard which
has been a model of disclosure
and cooperation. There the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Educa
tion, which is composed of junior
and tenured faculty, University
officials and student representa
tives, work together to put out a
comprehensive course ratings
guide, otherwise known as the
"CUE guide." While faculty here
bicker about releasing trivial
numbers, Harvard goes much fur
ther with disclosure, including
ratings for difficulty and effort
levels.
Departmental course evalua
tions are one of the primary
means by which departments
assess courses, instructors and
course content. It's about time
students got to see the results of
those evaluations.
