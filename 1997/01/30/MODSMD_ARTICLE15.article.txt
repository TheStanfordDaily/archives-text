Banning ROTC from campus shows Stanford's elitism

AS A MEMBER of the Army ROTC
Program at Santa Clara Universi
ty and a Stanford student, I found
ASSU President Bill Shen's recent
actions to stifle the passage of ASSU
Senator Bruce Gibney's ROTC bill both
selfish and reprehensible. More than 20
years ago, ROTC was removed from the
Stanford campus amid protests from stu
dents over U.S. military involvement in
the Vietnam conflict. Although U.S. mili
tary action in Southeast Asia has ceased
since then, ROTC programs are still cur
rently banned from campus. As a result
of this ban, many patriotic and well
motivated students who are interested in
ROTC are compelled to find transporta

tion to schools like UC-Berkeley and
Santa Clara in order to fulfill the
requirements of their scholarships.
When I was a high school senior, I
was interested in both serving my coun
try and attending a prestigious univer
sity. With a middle-class background,
the opportunity to attend a university
of Stanford's caliber was a pipe dream
â€” not because I was unqualified but
because the cost of a Stanford educa
tion was well beyond my family's finan
cial means. In order to resolve this
dilemma, I applied for and won an
Army ROTC scholarship. At Stanford,
where most students struggle to wake
up in time for their 10 a.m. classes, I

am compelled to wake up at 4:30 a.m.
three days a week in order to make a
40-minute commute to Santa Clara
University because of Stanford's cur
rent ban on ROTC.
Although many do not agree with the
military's current policy toward homo
sexuals, there is a more immediate issue
at stake. A ban on ROTC will not compel
the U.S. military to change its policy. It
will merely force them to take their pro
grams and money elsewhere. Further
more, the only effect a ban on this pro
gram has is that it makes life harder for
the average middle-class student who is
interested in serving his or her nation.
ROTC is an alternative for students from

predominantly low- to middle-class back
grounds who normally would not be able
to afford Stanford's expenses. Any effort
by Stanford to stifle an attempt to bring
ROTC back to campus is merely a reaf
firmation of its elitist pretensions. For an
institution so interested in diversity, it is
a shame that it alienates much of main
stream America in the process. For a
university so interested in tolerance, it is
a pity that it fails to reward those willing
to work hard for the chance to obtain an
education that is reserved for the
wealthy.
