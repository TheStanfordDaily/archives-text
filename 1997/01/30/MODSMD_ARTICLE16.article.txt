# Garry Grundy should take a lesson from Kant to understand atheism
## 
### 
On Tuesdays I don't have class, so it
gives me plenty of time to sit around and
contemplate the great questions of the
universe. I've been thinking of picking up
a Tuesday seminar or something because
as an atheist, I'm left in great despair by
the end of the day, what with being forced
to see the world as a completely irrational
place and all. When I call my mother and
tell her to @!#%!! herself, I just can't
understand why she gets upset, and when
I go on a homicidal rampage it doesn't
make any sense to me why I wake up in
jail the next morning. Because as we all
know, according to Garry Grundy, true
and consistent atheists can't believe in
cause and effect.
Luckily, Tuesday, during my custom
aiy period of deep questioning, I hap
pened to have picked up a copy of that
respected philosophical journal, The
Daily. Grundy was kind enough to explain
to me the nature of cause and effect and
by reason of the cause of "cause and

effect," the effect of the existence of God.
Clearly, Grundy isn't getting enough
Kant (of the Immanuel variety). Grundy,
please allow me to serve you up some of
the Kant that you so desperately need.
(Note: For a more detailed and correct
explanation of what follows, see Kant's
"Critique of Pure Reason.")
The problem with Grundy's argument
is his interpretation of the laws of cause
and effect. What Kant tells us is that our
laws of cause and effect are only applica
ble to our experiences. And our experience
of the world is merely that of appear
ances; we do not ever experience the
objects of the world in and of themselves.
When you see, hear, touch, feel or smell
something, you do not experience the
thing itself. What you experience exists
only in your mind. You cannot get at the
actual object.
Our knowledge can only go so far as
our experience goes. And since our experi
ence never leaves our own minds, we can
know nothing of things in and of them
selves. Because we have no experience or
knowledge at all of things in and of them
selves, we cannot apply the laws of cause
and effect to them. The laws of cause and
effect can only be applied to the appear
ances that exist within our minds.

This limits the applicability of cause
and effect quite a bit, especially with
regard to the existence of God. If the laws
of cause and effect can only be applied to
appearances, who's to say that the world,
the universe or intelligence requires any
kind of cause? It isn't me, it isn't Grundy,
and for that matter, it isn't you because
neither he nor I nor you know anything
at all about the world, the universe or the
nature of intelligence in and of them
selves. Additionally, I am pretty gosh
darn sure that Grundy experienced nei
ther the appearance of the creation of the
world nor the creation of the world in and
of itself. His assertion that he knows the
cause of the creation of the world is whol
ly invalid.
Regardless of what you think of Kant's
argument or my interpretation of it, what
this letter shows is that the issue of cause
and effect is much more complicated than
as presented in Grundy's column.
And Grundy, you might say that with
out God to create the world, our existence
makes no sense. I ask you, what makes
you think the world litis to make any
sense, and even if it does, why do you
think that you can understand it?
