# Science and religion work together to answer complicated questions
## 
### 
My congratulations go to Garry
Grundy! With Tuesday's column, I sus
pect that he managed to incense both athe
ists and many religious people alike. Obvi
ously, he alienated atheists by labeling
them "irrational" (when indeed the "call
ing" for many atheists is the search for a
more rational, empirical explanation of
existence than they think religion can pro
vide) and by suggesting, hopefully in jest,
that they "might as well kill themselves."
However, I doubt he realized that by
comparing the creation of the universe to a
childhood axiom, by making the pseudo
logical claim that order in nature necessar
ily implies design by a deity and by trivial
izing evolution as a "mindless, orderless
accident," he insults numerous religious
communities here at Stanford and con
tributes to the mistaken view that mem
bers of these communities have as little
respect for or interest in science as he
seems to have.
Furthermore, 10 column inches is no
place to settle the centuries-old debate
about the relationship of science and reli
gion. Neither is this responsorial letter.
But it needs to be stated that science and
religion on this campus and in the civilized
world can and often do operate in quite dif
ferent spheres of human concern. Sciencc
attempts to answer questions such as,
"How does human reproduction work?"
whereas religion suggests answers for
queries such as, "What is the meaning and

value of human reproduction?" I would
suggest that it is as much a mistake to sub
stitute religion in place of science as it is to
think that scientific investigation per se
can provide normative moral values.
I encourage Grundy to continue his
search for both religious and secular erudi
tion. Moreover, I ask that he consider care
fully the tenuous relationship between reli
gious groups and academia here at Stan
ford before making a public statement that
helps {KM-petuate the myth that the former
does not care about the latter.
