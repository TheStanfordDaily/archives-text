## Continuing our education 
### 
The most fundamental
question that has plagued me
this year has been the question
of how to pursue my education. I don't
mean graduate school. I am referring to
a vaguer concept than getting a degree
and making contacts in sunny Califor
nia. I mean self-improvement: the con
scious, constant, tortuous uphill trek
that all good students of life should con
stantly be gathering provisions for, to
kill a metaphor.
In writing this column, I've attempt
ed to bring the Stanford community
into my calculating space, to figure out
what is wrong within each of ourselves
and assuage the fears connected with
those things. However, I have gathered
a lot of recent evidence that points to a
general inability of at least part of the
Stanford community to improve itself
at all.
The conservative community here,
particularly those members who work
at The Stanford Review, is a bunch of
wimps. I call them wimps because of
their apparent fear of actual issues.
What Stanford has shown me is that
people like George F. Will and Dinesh
D'Souza are indeed quite talented. You
don't have to like what they say, but
you do have to respect the fact that they
can say what they have to say coherent
ly, with a specific point to get across.
Clearly they are the cream of the crop if
the example of conservatism that Stan
ford has to offer is in any way represen

tative of the rest of the nation. The con
servative community here, or at least
the vocal ones, pick at their plate of
intellectual food like a spoiled brat
whose parents never told him that peo
ple in other countries are starving.
Instead of attacking ideas, they attack
people. Instead of bringing up issues,
they pick at the minor points of old
issues. In their shoddy-ass, un-proof
read, misinformation-filled paper, there
are occasional good stories, like the
recent one about Stanford programs
overseas. But generally, good stories
are an anomaly.
The conservative community repre
sented by The Review is so busy trying
not to be liberal that they forget that
there should actually be a point behind
a point of view. No one there seems to
know the difference between tongue-in
cheek and hand-in-underwear. Specifi
cally, see past Review articles about lec
turer Jonathan Reider, Garry Grundy,
me and the student organization
RAGE. The Review presents no clear
reason for dislike besides a desire to dis
like something. The Review is a publica
tion dedicated to insults and cliches
(stick to your day job?) directed at any
one who happens to have something to
say.
I have a very good friend who used to
go to college nearby before he dropped
out. Right now he's taking continuing
education classes at a different college.
In the middle of a recent conversation,

he suddenly got very angry at me. My
silly little friend problems are never
going to completely go away, but I con
tinue working at them diligently. Real
issues that I can directly afTect I don't
spend enough time on. This sort of
action / inaction is tantamount to fail
ing to continue my education. My friend
hates his school. He hates the intellec
tual atmosphere there. We have so
much here. The conservative and liber
al camps here don't have to get along,
but we should at least try to attack the
monster of issues that we disagree on
and not each other.
The Review should be trying to
change things. I don't see anyone at
The Review trying to look into Univer
sity investing or going to "Tea and
Cookies" with University President
Gerhard Casper or having any concrete
opinions on anything at all. I see them
reacting. I see them having so little ful
fillment in their intellectual lives that
they are forced to whine to anyone who
will listen. Perhaps the people at The
Review are scared of turning out to be
as loose and liberal as they think the
rest of Stanford is. Maybe they should
face up to what they really are.

By the way guys, if you need a new
columnist, I am now free.
