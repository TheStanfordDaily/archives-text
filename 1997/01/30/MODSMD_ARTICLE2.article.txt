# FRI closure frustrating
## After a year, faculty and students say few are helping in the search for alternatives to Food Research Institute 
### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
Although the Food Research Institute
is not scheduled to close until June 1998,
faculty and student are already growing
frustrated with the process of winding up
its operations.
Institute faculty were told they had the
option of moving to other departments
within the University, moving to other in
stitutions or signing early retirement
packages when the closure announcement
was made last year.
According to Food Research Institute
Director Jeffrey Williams, none of the se
nior faculty has moved to another depart
ment; instead, many have decided to sign
retirement packages.
Departmental negotiations to transfer
faculty have proven difficult — after one
year, discussions are still in the works for
Prof. Pan Yotopoulos.
Yotopoulos, who has spent 30 years at
Stanford, said he hopes to move to anoth
er department because he wants to contin
ue research projects here.
"Ideally, I would need a departmental
base to continue my research," Yotopoulos
said. "Those are not easy problems to be
solved overnight. It seems this ideal world
does not exist. I don't see an easy solu
tion."
Law Prof. Robert VVeisberg, vice
provost for faculty recruitment and devel
opment, expressed regret that faculty
were not having an easier time changing
departments. "I would have hoped [nego
tiations] would have lasted a few months,"
he said.
Junior faculty say they have found little
support in the transition. Only two assis
tant professors, Scott Rozelle and Marcel
Fafchamps, have been able to move to the
Economics Department.
Asst. Food lie search Prof. Heidi Albers
said the younger junior faculty have been
treated like visiting professors. Originally,
Albers said, "I was told I could apply to
move to other departments and would be
available for tenure or I could stay where I
was and ride out my career."
Instead she has been forced to look out
side the University.

"Helpful isn't a word I would use," Al
- said of the negotiations she has been
through. "It's been an extremely long
process. Oftentimes, I wouldn't get a re
sponse from them for six weeks.
"This was a decision that went against
Dean John Shoven's promise that under
no circumstances would I lose my job," Al
bers said. "And that's what happened."
Shoven, dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences, was not available for
comment.
"According to the dean's plan, our pro

gram would have been taken over or
merged" with the master's Program in In
ternational Policy Studies, Williams said.
"That did not happen."
Williams said junior faculty members
have had to pursue other career options.
Fafchamps said even though he has
found a place in another department, he is
frustrated with the tenure process.
"I was to be up for tenure in FRI last
academic vear. but a tenure review was
never organized, given the circum
stances," he said. "I am now on a
three-year tenure-track appoint
ment in the Economics Depart
ment."
Asst. Food Research Prof. Fred
Zimmerman said he had the impres
sion that administration said "it
would deal humanely with all its fac
ulty." Instead, he said, "they were
treating us veiy poorly."
Meanwhile, the institute's stu
dents have had their own problems
to deal with — they need either to
join other programs or to finish

their dissertations early.
"Originally, the dean said that
FRI would last for four years and
finish that first-year class,"
Williams said. "Meanwhile, all the
indicators were that faculty were
not going to be here, which didn't
make sense."
Fifth-year doctoral student Liz
Robinson said one of the msyor con
cerns among students has been that
advisers would leave for other uni
versities.
Eighteen doctoral students are
still with the program, all of whom
must finish their dissertations by
June 1998.
Six first-year doctoral students
left the program at the beginning of
winter quarter last year. Two trans

ferred to Stanford's Economics De
partment, one went to the Engi
neering-Economic Systems Depart
ment, one went to the Graduate
School of Business and two trans
ferred to UC-Berkeley's Agricultur
al Economics Department.
Eleven master's students also
still are studying at the institute,
some of whom are involved in joint
degree programs. All should finish
this year.
Even though it will not close for
more than a year, Williams said he is
disturbed by the perception that the
Food Research Institute already is
gone.
"I think most people have forgot
ten about FRI," he said, "which is
really sad."
