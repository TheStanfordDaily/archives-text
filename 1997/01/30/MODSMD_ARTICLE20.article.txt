## An intern finds more politics than policy in Washington 
### 
Every summer, thousands
of bright-eyed, fresh-faced college
students descend on Washington,
D.C. They come to intern in the myriad
agencies which populate the city. They
come to change to world.
OK, they are not that naive. They know
that they are only interns, the lowest of the
low, the bottom of a very big barrel. But
they still hope. After all, they will be work
ing for important, people in important jobs
who make decisions every day which
change the lives of millions. Perhaps they
could contribute in some small way, the
interns think.
Then they are introduced to a stack of
paper.
Paper means one of three things for an
intern — faxing, copying or filing. And as
the intern quickly learns, there's a lot of
paper in Washington.
That's because paper is the ambrosia of
the gods in this Olympus. Every report,
letter or memo has to be distributed in
triplicate, just to make sure that no one is
left out and everyone has an extra copy for
their files.
Even the onset of the technological rev
olution has not diminished Washington's
ravenous desire for paper. In fact, it has
just shifted into cyberspace.
Now, in addition to writing memos, peo
ple send e-mail, which is all stored in a gov
ernment computer just because it might be
important someday. (This includes thee

mail I wrote to my boyfriend from my gov
ernment computer, which I am convinced
is vital to national security.)
And so after a few weeks (and a few
hundred reams of paper), the interns
become disillusioned, sure that they will
never be able to make the tiniest differ
ence.
Hut it is not like the bosses are doing
anything either. Sure they go to meetings
. . . and more meetings to plan future
meetings .. . and more meetings to plan
how to plan future meetings.
But the problem with meetings is that
nothing is ever accomplished, for example,
consider a meeting that I attended this
summer when I worked in the Congres
sional Affairs Office of the U.S. Trade Rep
resentative. My job at USTR was to make
congressmen and their staffs (particularly
the latter since they actually control what
the congressmen think) happy. To do that,
we had meetings. Meetings allowed con
gressional staffers to feel powerful because
they could order around executive branch
personnel.
This particular meeting was with a
senior staff member for then-Sen. Larry
Pressler, chair of the Commerce Commit
tee, at the time a very important man for
us. The meeting was allegedly about
scheduling a possible hearing on telecom
munications trade negotiations. Actually,
it wjis a chance fort his staffer to show how
cool he was.

On the way there (in a taxi on the tax
payers' tab), the bosses plotted strategy.
One suggested ways to humiliate the
staffer, the other relayed some nasty gos
sip about his sexual prowess. When we got
to the meeting room, the staffer made us
wait, to show how important his time was.
When he walked in, everyone greeted each
other in that falsely sincere way, sizing
each other up instead of exchanging gen
uine salutations.
The meeting was a sham, a chance to
show off in front of the interns, rather
than a policy discussion. When we left, my
bosses were happy. They had won, they
said, and made the staffer look stupid in
the process.
So much for policy-making.
I soon became completely disheartened.
Could it be that the common people were
right about government — that it just
sucked?
As a political science major, a devout eli
tist and an aspiring government bureau
crat, I could not accept this conclusion. So
I made a pilgrimage to that fountain of
wisdom — my congressman.
He asked me what I thought of Wash
ington. OK, I replied, but it seemed a little
too much politics and too little policy.
He fixed his eyes on me.
"Have you gone to a hearing yet?"
No, I answered.
"Go to a hearing," he advised. "They
are the heart of the legislative process."

Reassured, I left, secure in the knowl
edge that somewhere in this town, some
thing worked.
Until I got back to my office that was.
For there was actually a hearing the next
week, and I immediately started preparing.
Now, I think the congressman was
right; hearings are the heart of the legisla
tive process. There's nothing more phony
than a hearing.
Hearings are the culmination of the
ongoing power struggle between the execu
tive and the legislative branch. The legisla
tive branch, flush with power, beckons the
heads of various agencies to appear before
them to be examined on some issue. The
issue is unimportant, as those summoned
don't actually know anything about the
issue. Those who really follow issues are
much too junior to appear before Congress.
Instead, the junior staffers scurry around
preparing a cheat book for the senior per
son to learn about complex issues like Mex
ican drug trafficking in one day.
But it gets worse. It was my job to call
up congressional staffers and ask them
what questions the members would ask.
Then the policy people in my office would
write the answers for our official to learn.
Why ask the staffers? Because they were
the ones who wrote the questions and the
briefs so that the congressmen could also
learn about the issue in one day.
The hearings ran on a script. The con
gressmen would look at their briefing

sheets and ask a question, and our official,
who had actually memorized the informa
tion, would respond. What a grand legisla
tive process.
But before you accuse me of being a
closet Republican, as my mother did, con
sider this: I voluntarily stayed in Washing
ton through the end of fall quarter. Why?
Because in the heart of the labyrinthine
bureaucracy fueled on Starbucks, there's
something real. Something that works.
I glimpsed it a few times, like the day I
read an article about a woman who gradu
ated from college and credited her success
to a Head Start program. Or the day that
the bickering on C-SPAN stopped for a
moment and was replaced by the scene of
70 smiling senators wearing bowties to
honor the retiring Sen. Paul Simon. Or the
day when 1 saw the endangered tamarins
frolicking happily at the government-fund
ed National Zoo.
That's why I stayed. Because once in a
while, something works, and then it's won
derful.
And nothing would work if we stopped
trying.
