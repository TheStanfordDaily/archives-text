# Grundy uses faulty logic to explain religion in terms of cause and effect
## 
### 
Regarding Garry Grundy's column on
atheists (Tuesday's Daily), ignore its uglier
aspects â€” however interesting it might be
to speculate about the likely reaction to a
piece that, for instance, said "perhaps we
oughta slap our (Ghristian, Jew, Muslim,
Buddhist, etc.) back into reality."
Instead, focus on his main point. He's

incapable of imagining something as
complex as the universe and the life with
in it simply happening on its own. It
doesn't agree with his notion of cause and
effect.
OK, so accept for a moment his idea
that the universe was and is created and
guided by a divine force. Fine.
Presumably this divine force, however
you conceive it, is even more complex, deep
and mysterious than the universe and life
it created and guides.
OK, so where did that force come from,
and how was it created 7 What, you say it
was always there? Why is that notion any

less fantastic, any less incredible, any less
amazing than the idea that what happened
around us is nothing more than a happy
accident that happened over billions of
years?
It's not. If we're lucky, we live to 100.
Cause and effect over the time scale of bil
lions of years isn't something we have intu
ition about, so of course there may be
things that beggar the imagination.
But hey, if Grundy can't deal with that,
that's OK. It's just too bad he feels like
slapping around those who can.
