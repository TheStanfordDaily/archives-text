## Stanford gets roasted by Weenies at Harmon Gym Goodbye and good riddance to Harmon 
### Jim Finsten 
BERKELEY — Harmon Gym, a building
which dates back to the Wilson administra
tion, has seen its share of battles. Last
night's game between Stanford and Califor
nia will be the last game between these arch
rivals in the arena's current incarnation.
Next year, Harmon is scheduled to be thor
oughly remodeled, as well as renamed the
Haas Pavilion. The roof will be torn off, and
seating will be expanded from 6,578 to more
than 12,000. Undoubtedly, Berkeley officials
will not build one new parking space . ..
The gym itself is really quite ugly. Wooden
benches like those at Maples Pavilion sur
round the court and go up nine rows. The 14
additional rows sit on concrete blocks. There
are no backs to the seats, which isn't such a
problem since most fans stand the entire
game anyhow.
The roof is held up by a series of six heavy
cross-beams painted a lovely shade of piss
yellow. My high school gym is far more aes
thetically pleasing.
An hour before tipoff, Berkeley fans show
their class by booing a couple of elderly Stan
ford fans who dawdle along the court directly
in front of the student section.
At Harmon, there is no "white line" which
fans are not supposed to cross. There are no
tables and benches separating fans from
players. A spill into the crowd is most defi
nitely a spill into the crowd, and if you're a
Stanford player, you'd be advised to check
your jewelry once you remove yourself from
the din.
The public address announcer proclaims
the entrance of the "Infamous California
Straw Hat Band." Fanfare. The students
rise and start clapping. Band strikes up
"The Dirty Golden Bear." Two sousaphone
players descend to the floor, and the Cal
basketball team emergeth. The student
body then demonstrates its ability to spell.
"C .. . A .. . L .. . CAL! CAL! CAL!" The
band now moves into the UCLA fight song.
Of course there was a game last night.
Stanford showed up 30 minutes into it and
didn't play so bad. But 10 minutes of basket
ball is not enough, especially in a crusty pit
like Harmon.
This year, men's basketball is different at
Cal. Gone are Jason Kidd, Lamond Murray,
Shareef Abdur-Rahim, embattled head coach
Todd Bozeman and their respective rap
sheets.
I long for the days of beating an overrated


Alex Ho — Daily
Sophomore center Tim Young lofts a jumper over Cat's Michael Stewart in yesterday's 70-64
setback in Berkeley.
Cal team whose depth in talent
was only matched by its abun
dance of selfishness and lack of
cohesion. Now they play like a
team, sort of. I wonder where they
learned that!

Last year, when Cal fired
Bozeman and replaced him with
Ben Braun, they came as close as
possible to hiring Mike Mont
gomery.
Both men are relatively quiet
and are experts in team defense.
Make no mistake of it, Stanford
was cold, and Cal played as well as
it's capable of playing. But if imi
tation is the sincerest form of flat

tery, Cal fans must really love
Stanford.
As I finish this column, the
arena is nearly empty, and a
pleasant thought enters my head.
Gone are the teams and players.
The respective bands have headed
outside for fresh air. The building
is still ugly. And Stanford will
never again lose a game in Har
mon Gym.
