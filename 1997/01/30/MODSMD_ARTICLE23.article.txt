# Card shoots 36 percent as Cal rolls to 70-64 triumph
## 
### Bobby Cuza Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY - When the
smoke had risen and jubilant
Berkeley fans finally cleared the
court here last night, the score
board at old Harmon Gym read
California 70, Stanford 64.
The Cardinal was lucky it was
even that close.
After jumping out to a 12-4 lead
in the opening minutes, No. 15
Stanford (13-4, 6-3 Pacific 10 Con
ference) suffered a total team melt
down. Down 28-23 at halftime and
trailing by as many as 16 in the sec
ond half, the Cardinal was out
hustled, out-muscled, out
rebounded, outscored — you name
it. On this night, Stanford was sim
ply outplayed in every facet of the
game.

'To be down by five
and really to have a
chance to cut it to
two at the end — as
poorly as we played
— is kind of amazing.'
— Mike Montgomery

"We just didn't play well
enough," said Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery. "Cal defended
us very well, Cal made more big
plays, they had some people jump
up and shoot it in, and we were
struggling to find anybody to score.
It just puts too much pressure on
your defense to expect to be able to
win when you aren't getting any
production.
"Our three leading scorers were
8-fof-31 from the floor. We got out
rebounded for maybe the first time
this year. There's not much to
hang your hat on when those
things happen."
Cal's bruising five-man inside
rotation (Alfred Grigsby, Michael
Stewart, Kenyon Jones, Tony Gon
zalez and Shawn Marks) thorough

ly dominated Stanford's big men
holding sophomore center Tim
Young to just six points and si*
rebounds. As a team the Bears out>
rebounded the Cardinal 38-32 and
forced 19 turnovers, 13 of them ii)
the first half.
With sophomore guard Kris
Weems unable to find his touch fof
the seventh game in a row — he
was 0-for-6 from three-point range
— senior point guard Brevin
Knight finding the inside lanes
clogged and a vociferous crowd of
6,578 raising the roof on Harmon
Gym, this one had all the
ents for a blowout.
And that's exactly where it
looked like things were headed in
the second half. After a Young bas
ket cut the Cal lead to 31-29 with
18 minutes, 9 seconds remaining
in the game, the Cardinal broke
down. For the next 8:18, Stanford
did not put a single point on ths
scoreboard, allowing Cal (15-5, 6-
3) to build up a commanding 45-29
lead.
"There were loose balls we
could've come up with We didn't
— Cal got 'em. There were loose
rebounds we could've come up
with. We didn't — Cal got 'em. Yoi)
put all those things together, it's
hard to win," Montgomery said. !
To Stanford's credit, it didn't
throw in the towel. The Cardinal
kept plugging away and, thanks
largely to a couple of clutch treys
by sophomore Arthur Lee. got as
close as 67-63 with 40
remaining.
"To be down by five and really
to have a chance to cut it to two at
the end — as poorly as we played —
is kind of amazing," Montgomery
said. "I thought we showed some
guts, hanging in there and trying;
to find a way to get back in the bait
game, but as fnr as playing weH.
enough to win against this team in;
this environment, we just didn't d£
that." •'
The first half wasn't much bet
ter than the second for Stanford.
After jumping out to the early lead,
the Cardinal started playing sloppy
and allowed Cal to pull ahead on
the strength of a 19-5 run.
"I think it was obvious we were

a little bit nervous early," Mont
gomery said. "We missed countless
number of layups inside, shooting
too fast, then they got a couple of
blocks, and I think we started look
ing around for the block rather
than just finishing the play."
Cal guard Ed Gray — the con

ference's leading scorer — finished
with a game-high 27 points. But it
was on the free-throw line where
he hurt the Cardinal most, bury
ing 11-of-ll to help squelch Stan
ford's second-half comeback. The
Bears also got clutch play from
Randy Duck, who was 4-of-6 from
three-point range, and Grigsby,
who finished with 12 rebounds.
"You've got to give them cred
it," Montgomery said. "They made
enough big plays that it kept us
significantly behind, and [we never
got] in a position where we had a
chance to make a play or two to
win.
"Tough place to play, tough con
ference to win on the road. But if
you're going to beat anybody on
the road you have to have two,
three, four guys step up and play,
and we just didn't get that
tonight."
