# Charmin Smith steps up in her final season
## Senior guard's character and versatility keep women's hoops on the right track 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
At Stanford, where national champi
onships are remembered fondly, senior
guard Charmin Smith has a different sort of
memory. It is not the Final Four appear
ances the last two seasons, but rather the
1994 Western Regional semifinal game
against then-No. 5 Colorado at Maples Pavil
ion.
Despite not playing a single minute, the
78-62 win over the Buffaloes "was one of the
most exciting victories that I've had," Smith
said. "We didn't win the Pac-10 that year,
and we were coming in with a 13-game win
ning streak. But just the way the team came
together that season was something that was
just new to me [at the time]. I didn't realize
how much of a challenge it would be to come
out and compete every day.
"I just expected a lot of things to be a
given because I was at Stanford. I figured,
'Oh, we'll win the Pac-10; we'll go to the
Final Four.' I just thought it was auto
matic. But the way we had to fight that
year really taught me a lot about how hard
it's going to be and what you have to put
into things."
It is that kind of lesson that Smith has
carried into her final year on the Farm, a sea
son in which the third-ranked Cardinal is the
odds-on favorite to bring home a national
championship for the first time in five years.
This season has seen her become one of the
unsung heroes of the team, what with senior
forward Kate Starbird's scoring and the
improved post play of juniors Olympia Scott
and Naomi Mulitauaopele.
Nevertheless, she has turned it up in con
ference play, averaging 7.9 points and 4.5
rebounds per game while filling in at the
point for senior Jamila Wideman and start -
ing in place of junior forward Vanessa
Nygaard, both of whom have been hampered

with iryury.
"She is a real unsung hero on this team in
terms of stepping in and dealing with the
injuries," said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "She is a great example for the
rest of the team."
Smith came to Stanford by way of St.
Louis. The youngest of two children, she
took to basketball pretty quickly.
"I have an older brother and I always
wanted to do whatever he did," Smith said.
"And I couldn't play football, so basketball
was the way to go."
And go she did, garnering several awards
in high school and piquing the interest of
several colleges. One of these, of course, was
Stanford. Early on, though, the interest was
not mutual.
"I kind of threw [its recruiting letter] in
the back of the drawer with [the other let
ters] because I figured, "Stanford — that's a
nerdy school,' " Smith said. "Then I was
watching the national championship game
on TV in 1990, and it was, 'Jennifer Azzi
leads Stanford to its first national champi
onship.' And I'm thinking 'Stanford?' w
Needless to say, Smith found that let
ter and attended VanDerveer's camp the
next summer. While she also considered
UCLA, Virginia and Purdue, Smith had
her mind basically made up in the summer
of 1990.
"I met Tara and Amy and some of the
players and ever since then, I really felt
that's where I wanted to be," Smith said.
After appearing in 24 and 31 games,
respectively, her first two seasons, Smith
broke through in her junior year. She start
ed 23 games under the tutelage of interim
head coach Amy Tucker and co-head coach
Marianne Stanley, helping Stanford meke a
surprising Final Four run.
"The thing that really impressed me was

how she worked and worked and
worked," Stanley said. "She is not
the type to get down, and I really
liked her determination. It was a
real joy to work with her."
This season though, Van-
Derveer made a triumphant
return from Atlanta and decided to
go with a bigger lineup, which
meant Smith would be coming off
the bench in her senior year.
"When I come in, I'm still doing
the same things," Smith said.
"Trying to be the defensive stop
per, taking care of the ball and
rebounding, which are kind of the

main things I did last year.
"This year, I've been tiying to
work on my offense a lot and trying
to be more aggressive, and I think
I've picked it up with the start of
conference play," Smith said.
Among her highlights in confer
ence play this season include her 3-
of-3 three-point shooting against
Arizona and a driving layup with 9
seconds left to beat USC in Stan
ford's closest shave of the young
Pac-10 season. Now, with the team
getting Nygaard back as soon as
tomorrow and Wideman getting
stronger each game, Smith sees
the team coming together in simi
lar fashion as 1994, especially with
Smith stepping up recently.
"It's all about timing," Smith
said. "We have all the talent, all the

ability and the motivation and
desire. It's just a matter of being
healthy at the right time."
Smith may once again return to
a backup role and provide instant
defense, offense and ball handling.
But she has shown no problems
with her role as long as it helps
Stanford win.
"You learn the most about peo
ple when things don't go their
way," VanDerveer said. "When we
made the decision to go with a big
ger lineup, she could have pouted
and gone into the tank, but instead
she has been very steady. She's
someone I depend on."
Should her steadiness hold up,
Smith may very well have a cham
pionship memory to add to that
