# Rugby meets Gaels, Slugs

### Gil Lopez Contributing writer 
After having its match against UC-Santa
Barbara canceled last Saturday, the men's
rugby team defeated the San Carlos 19-year
old and younger team 27-24 over the week
end. The team from Argentina is currently
touring the United States and competing
against various collegiate squads.
Senior Greg Gueyney led the Cardinal in
that contest by scoring on two tries for 10 of
Stanford's 27 points.
"He created a lot of things for the team,"
said head coach Franck Boivert. "He was
very smart and played almost a perfect game.
"It was excellent training for us because
while they were not as big as we were, they
were playing much faster and were playing
very smart. So therefore it really showed
what we need to work on, especially defen
sive realignment."
The team will travel to St. Mary's on Sat
urday for a match at 1 p.m. Boivert said the
Cardinal will try to put into practice those
aspects of the game which need improvement
this weekend against the Gaels. One big area
of concern is keeping the ball in a tighter for
mation on offense.
By trying to go too far with the ball, an
individual makes it more difficult for the
team to recover in case he is tackled. These
mistakes make it easier for an opponent to
regain possession and increase its opportuni
ties to push the ball farther downfield.
Also on Saturday, the women's rugby
team will travel to UC-Santa Cruz to face the
Banana Slugs. Stanford has been out of
action for almost three weeks now, when it
lost to UCLA. Since then the Cardinal had a
week off and was rained out of the UC-Santa
Barbara game last weekend.
Stanford will play the Slugs
after working on a more aggres
sive defense to ensure that oppo
nents do not dictate the tempo

of the game. Tighter defense will
also prevent the Cardinal from
recovering the ball too far in the
backfield. The Cardinal has also
been working on better ball-han
dling skills in order to more
effectively move the ball down
the field.
"When we start making mis
takes and letting the other team

recover the ball, that's when
things get hard for us," said
senior captain Megan Himan.
"Basically what we've been work
ing on the last couple of weeks is
improving the flow of the game
and trying to take advantage of
the natural momentum of the
game and trying not to get ner
vous when we play."
