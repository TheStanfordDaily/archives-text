After having its match against UC-Santa
Barbara canceled last Saturday, the men's
rugby team defeated the San Carlos 19-year
old and younger team 27-24 over the week
end. The team from Argentina is currently
touring the United States and competing
against various collegiate squads.
Senior Greg Gueyney led the Cardinal in
that contest by scoring on two tries for 10 of
Stanford's 27 points.
"He created a lot of things for the team,"
said head coach Franck Boivert. "He was
very smart and played almost a perfect game.
"It was excellent training for us because
while they were not as big as we were, they
were playing much faster and were playing
very smart. So therefore it really showed
what we need to work on, especially defen
sive realignment."
The team will travel to St. Mary's on Sat
urday for a match at 1 p.m. Boivert said the
Cardinal will try to put into practice those
aspects of the game which need improvement
this weekend against the Gaels. One big area
of concern is keeping the ball in a tighter for
mation on offense.
By trying to go too far with the ball, an
individual makes it more difficult for the
team to recover in case he is tackled. These
mistakes make it easier for an opponent to
regain possession and increase its opportuni
ties to push the ball farther downfield.
Also on Saturday, the women's rugby
team will travel to UC-Santa Cruz to face the
Banana Slugs. Stanford has been out of
action for almost three weeks now, when it
lost to UCLA. Since then the Cardinal had a
week off and was rained out of the UC-Santa
