The creation of a new research cen
ter devoted to the study of econorn ic pol -
icy reform in developing countries was
announced this week by Provost Con
doleezza Rice and Dean of Research and
Graduate Policy Charles Kruger.
Economics Prof. Anne Krueger, a
renowned expert on international eco
nomics, was named the director of the
new center, which will be called the
Stanford Center for Research on Eco
nomic Development and Policy Reform.
The center, Krueger said, will help
support research on how to improve the
economic systems of developing coun
tries and countries such as Russia that
are moving away from centrally
planned systems to competitive market
economies.
"We've learned quite a bit about thi.-
issue, but there's always more to
know," said Krueger, who hopes to at
tract some of the world's foremost econ -
omists and policy experts to the center
Krueger said she hopes the center
will house the premiere collection of
scholars of economic development in
the nation within the next five years.
She said she expect s the appointment of
eight to 12 fellows to the center within

the next few months.
The center will be funded in part by
the endowments that were previously
used by the Food Research Institute, a
unit that University administrators
and the Board of Trustees decided to
close last year.
In recent years, the institute has fo
cused its research on agriculture in de
veloping countries, an area on which
Krueger the new center will also
concentrate.
However, Krueger added that she
doesn't think the center will assume the
professors mid graduate students who
will lose their positions when the Food
Research Institute shuts its doors in
June 1998.
"Right now, 1 don't know what the
connection will be between FRI and the
new center," she said.
Nevertheless, Krueger said the
study of agriculture is necessary in un
derstanding the economies of develop
ing countries because many such na
tions biise their economic livelihoods on
farming.
Although the center will be the home
of both visiting and S taxi ford profes
sors, no instruction will be offered
there, Krueger -vud.
