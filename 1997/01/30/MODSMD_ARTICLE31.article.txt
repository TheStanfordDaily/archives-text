Louise Spindler, a lecturer in the School of Educa
tion who spent more than 40 years at Stanford, died
Jan. 23 after several years of illness.
Spindler, who would have turned 80 this spring,
died at her home near Calistoga, Calif. A small private
funeral was held for the Stanford scholar last Sunday.
After earning a master's in anthropology from Stan
ford, Spindler became the first person ever at the Uni
versity to earn a doctorate in the field in 1956. She lec
tured for more than 40 years, specializing in women
and cultural change.
Faculty and staff remembered her as a pioneer who
could be consistently depended on to carry out her role,
as well as a leading figure in the field who worked more
by example than by exhortation.
"She was just a delightful person," said Richard
Shavelson, dean of the School of Education. "She was
intelligent and a very knowledgeable scholar but also
just about the sweetest person in the world. She was an
extremely caring person and worked really well with
students."
Spindler's work will be carried on by her husband
and research partner, Education Prof. Emeritus

George Spindler. The couple focused oil Native Ameri
can communities, cultural diversity in American class
rooms and the urbanization of America and Germany.
The two team-taught one class each year in anthro
pology and education. This quarter, the Spindlers were
teaching a course titled, "Ethnographic Approaches to
Cultural Diversity in Schooling." George Spindler will
continue the class with the help of teaching assistants
and will appear in the classroom tonight as scheduled.
Some of the Spindlers' most prominent works in
cluded annual questionnaires which sought to get to
the core of American culture by posing various ques
tions to college students. They found their surveys
gave witness to the changing times. For example,
while nudity was regarded as "vulgar" among the
young in the 1950s when they began their question
naires, it became "beautiful" and "where it's at" a
decade later.
"I think the most striking thing about Louise is that
she and her husband worked so closely together," said
Anthropology Prof. Emeritus James Gibbs. Gibbs
worked with the couple when he published his first
paper in The American Journalist in 1963. The
Spindlers were editors of the journal at the time.
A memorial service for the Stanford community is
planned for the spring.
