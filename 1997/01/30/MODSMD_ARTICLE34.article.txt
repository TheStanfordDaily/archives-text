Film
The Stanford Film Society presents "Paradise Lost:
The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills." A gripping
documentary about the trials of three Arkansas teens
accused of murdering three 8-year-old boys as part of
a satanic ritual, the film has garnered wide acclaim,
gaining inclusion to numerous "best 10" lists.
Although one of the accused teens confessed to the
cnme, several expert witnesses doubt his memory,
citing possible mental incompetence. "Paradise Lost"
examines the other side of the case — the drama
outside the courtroom. It suggests that community
prejudices against teen-agers, who dressed in black
and read books about witchcraft, may have created
much of the motivation for the criminal charges.
Filmmakers Joe Berlinguer and Bruce Sinofsky are
best known for their 1992 Sundance Film Festival suc
cess "Brother's Keeper." "Keeper" is a gritty docu
mentary about the controversial murder case of a
farmer in upstate New York accused of murdering his
brother. Unable to find a distnbutor for "Brother's
Keeper," Berlinguer and Sinofsky chose to distribute it
alone, transforming themselves into sawy business
men; to date, their film has earned more than $1.5
million, offering them the opportunity to make "Par
adise Lost."
"Paradise Lost" will be shown tomorrow at 7 p.m. and
10 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium. Tickets cost $2 in

advance and $3 at the door for undergraduates, and
$4 in advance and $5 at the door for all others. For
more information, call Ratty Huang at 497-1835 or e
mail her at pph@leland.
