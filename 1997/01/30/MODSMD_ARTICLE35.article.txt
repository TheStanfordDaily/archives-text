# Theater New coming-of-age play offers a more authentic look at Hawaii

Most of us probably think of Hawaii as a vacation spot,
as a place to surf or to go on your honeymoon. Mention the
hula, and images of grass skirts and plastic leis might float
through your head. But senior Esther Pan, writer and direc
tor of the play "Na Ahi o Ka Lani," will paint you a different,
more authentic picture of Hawaii.
"It's an incredibly spiritual place," Pan said. "This is a
culture that is very tied to nature. Man and the land are truly
like brothers." Hawaii is also the land of the Aloha Spirit,
which Pan described as "a warmth of spirit and love" and a
"healing power on so many levels."
Pan spent the summer between her sophomore and ju
nior years at the University of Hawaii, researching the native
culture and natural history of Hawaii for "Na Ahi o Ka
Lani," which means "the fires of heaven."

While the play is based on a foundational Hawaiian myth,
the story is universal: Two immortal sisters, Pele (Alice Bug
man) and Hi'iaka (Natasha Takara), must readjust their re
lationship when a man comes between them. The love tri
angle provides the crux of the plot, but it was the character
conflict and sibling rivalry that intrigued Pan the most. "The
play is like a coming of-age story for Hi'iaka," she said.
Hi'iaka is a romantic, dreamy-eyed girl who brings gen
tle rains that nurture the land. Having grown up in the
shadow of her older, more powerful sister, Pele, Hi'iaka is
now ripe to experience her first love. Meanwhile, Pele, the
goddess of fire and creation, is on the hunt for a new lover.
Pele is confident of success, for men are drawn to her "like
flies to a web."
When Pele first sets eyes upon Prince Lohiau (David
Lampson) at a hula competition, she decides that he is the
right man for her. She gives Hi'iaka the task of fetching Lo

hiau from the island Kau'ai within three days. In return, she
promises to protest Hi'iaka's beloved lehau forests and best
friend, Hopoe (Kim Giffin). But falling prey to human na
ture (as well as a flat tire and a plane delay), Hi'iaka and Lo
hiau fall in love on the way back. And when she finds out
that her younger sister has betrayed her, Pele gives new
meaning to the warning, "Don't play with fire."
"Na Ahi o Ka Lani" also incorporates native music and
dances performed by members of the Stanford Hawaiian
Club. The dances, or hulas, range from kahiko (traditional)
toauana (modern). And, contrary to popular belief, men as
well as women are proficient at this artform. As Pele says at
the competition, "I love a man who can hula."

"Na Ahi oka Lani" runs through Saturday, with shows at 8
p.m. in the Eleanor Prosser Stuaio behind Memorial Audito
rium. Tickets cost $2.
