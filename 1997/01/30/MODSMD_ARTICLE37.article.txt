# DANCE
## 'Fitting Room' showcases work of Stanford dancers at their best 
### Sylee Gore 
Modern dance comes to Roble Dance Stu
dio in the form of "Fitting Room," a two-part
piece choreographed by Stanford seniors
Heidi Schweiker, Sarah Margolis and Kaney
Crump.
On a Friday afternoon, Schweiker sits
watching her dancers run through her piece.
One of the performers is missing today, and
when the part becomes central, she leaps off
the floor to seamlessly integrate into the
piece before returning to her role as choreo
grapher. This moment frames Schweiker's
long-standing relationship to dance, which
began in elementary school.
"Before we knew each other as people we
knew each other as dancers," said Crump,
speaking of her relationship with fellow

dancers Anne Claiborne and Margolis. "We
became better friends through dance."
The piece choreographed by Margolis and
Crump reflects these relationships. The sinu
ous, organic movements sketch out an explo
ration of movement and stillness with injec
tions of humanness, what Margolis calls "lit
tle stories against bodies in space."
Speaking on music's role, Margolis de
scribed "dripping off the beat, sliding back
onto it. Modern dance is a long way from the
traditional method of beginning with a piece
of music and creating a dance to complement
that music." Schweiker elaborated, "It's a far
more fluid process than the linear beat-to
beat progression."
Schweiker cites a piece she'd rehearse play
ing Led Zeppelin and Prince. When it came
to the performance, though, she substituted

"an airy, spacious, expansive music. The
other sound was present in the movement,
not the sound."
Hearing the two speak in concert under
scores the collaborative relationship that
Schweiker and Margolis share. "We have a
good mutual respect thing going on," said
Margolis, describing their ability to challenge
and inspire one another. The relationship
lends a certain nostalgic flavor to "Fitting
Room," which will be the last joint piece to be
performed by these long-standing partners.
The two are passionate when describing
their excitement at bringing their work to a
larger audience. "So many people are intimi
dated by modern dance, they feel that they
don't 'understand' it," said Margolis. But the
beauty of the dancers' movements is far more
intuitive than logical.

"It's very much a medium of now,"
Schweiker added. "Modern dance tends to be
defined in negatives — it's not ballet, it's not
jazz dance, it's not tap — and this leaves a lot
of open space in which a choreographer can
apply her imagination and her innate under
standing of motion."
"It's such an exciting art that few people
know about," Margolis said. "Every time I
take a friend to a modern dance perfor
mance, they come away loving it. Dance is
just such a gift, and I want to share it with
everyone."

"Fitting Room" shows at Roble Dance Stu
dio tomorrow and Saturday at 8 p. m. Margolis
stressed that the suggested $2 donation "is only
a donation. We don't want to keep anyone
away."
