BOOK REVIEW

Although Rosa Lee Cunningham and I, a
Stanford student from Cleveland, Oh., share
little beyond our two X chromosomes, I have
come to know and even understand her
through Leon Dash's compelling book,
"Rosa Lee: A Mother and Her Family in
Urban America" (Basic Books; $23). Both
Rosa Lee and Dash are black.
Originally published as "Rosa Lee's
Story"—a Pulitzer Prize-winning eight-part
series for The Washington Post — the book,
which also contains photographs, retains a
journalistic flavor which is one of its greatest
strengths.
Followed hy "Mr. Dash," as Rosa Lee calls
him, from September 1991 to September

1994, Rosa Lee
conducts her
life as usual,
giving the read
er a glimpse of
life in an inner
city, drug-rid
den housing
project. Includ
ed in such a life
arc daily visits
to the meth
adone clinic,
sporadic run
ins with the po-

lice, euphoric
shoplifting sprees, days in the hospital,
months in jail, trips to the welfare office and
days ot sickness from heroin withdrawal.
Despite the fact that I could not identity
with Rosa Lee, the matter-of-fact tone of the
hook blunts its shock factor. The hook refus
es to sensationalize, allowing the disturbing
material to speak for itself.
For instance, when revealing how Patty,
her oldest daughter, came to be prostituted at
the age of 11, Dash simply states, "In 1969,
when Fatty was 11, one of her mother's cus
tomers made an unusual request: He asked
Rosa Lee if he could have sex with Fatty.
"There's no way to recapture exactly
what went through Rosa Lee's mind as she

considered this request. It is not something
that she wanted to remember or talk about.
After Patty told me about it, I waited almost
three years before broaching the subject
with Rosa Lee. When 1 did, she angrily de
nied that it ever happened and accused Fatty
of lying."
Finally, Rosa Lee admits that it happened,
and Dash states the facts of the "transaction":
"Fatty said her mother asked her to have sex
with the man, who was then in his mid-40s.
Patty agreed. Rosa Lee told the man it would
cost $40 — twice as much as she had been
charging him. The man drove Patty to his
home in suburban Maryland. When Patty re
turned, she put two 20 dollar bills in Rosa
Lee's hand."
The story is related plainly, and though
Rosa Lee's shame and pain are recorded, they
are simply more facts to be added to the story.
Dash refrains from making judgments or
using stylistic tricks to make the story even
more shocking.
The blunt style can, however, slow down
the story, and I found myself frustrated by
the relative lack of emotional reaction. Addi
tionally, the simplicity of the style makes the
book seem tedious at times.
Reading one depressing string of unemo
tionally recounted events is tiring. In just the
first chapter, we see Rosa Lee wake up due to
stomach pains common to all heroin addicts.

We hear that five of her grown children try all
sorts of tricks to obtain money from Dash to
further their drug habits.
We witness an instance of Rosa Lee's fal
tering short-term memory as she finishes an
appointment but then returns to the waiting
room to wait for the appointment again. We
see her cry as she reveals that she has HIV, as
do her two oldest children. We find out she
cannot handle basic tasks like paying the
bills.
And that's only what we learn in the first
seven pages. There are still 12 more pages in
the chapter and 250 more in the book.
The one not-so-depressing chapter in the
book describes the lives of two of her sons,
Alvin and F.ric, who live independently and
lead working-class lives — entirely drug-free.
Because this chapter seeks to explain how
anything good could have come from Rosa
Lee's family, it cannot escape from the sorrow
the two brothers feel about the lives their sib
lings and their mother lead.
"Rosa Lee" is a heavy-hitting book. The
factual style does not try to shield the read
er from the grim facts of life in the urban
underclass. Though this can make the book
tough to withstand at times, the style also
gives the reader a direct understanding of
and empathy for Rosa Lee, a person with a
life so different from the one most of us
lead.
