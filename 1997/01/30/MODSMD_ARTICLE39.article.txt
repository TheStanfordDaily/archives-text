# Ghost Story
## Heinz Insu Fenkl's autobiographical fiction focuses on cultural differences and family spirits 
### Alex Tung 
In a world constantly feeling the friction
of grinding cultures, there are endless stories
of clashes and attempts at survival. "Memo
ries of My Ghost Brother" (Dutton, $23.95)
by Heinz Insu Fenkl distinguishes itself from
similar books with its very real portrayal of a
half-German, half-Korean boy struggling to
understand himself in the misery-laden
streets of Pupyong, Korea.

BOOK REVIEW

Set against the backdrop of the Vietnam
War, the autobiographical novel presents an
eerie view of a child's growth to adolescence
amidst the conflicting cultures of Korean
back alleys and an American military base.
With his father — a German soldier with
the American army — rarely at home, the
young Insu finds role models in his uncle Hy
ongbu and among his peers. Death touches
his life many times: first when his beloved
aunt Gannan commits suicide after being
scorned by her GI lover and again when his
best friend James is found drowned in a

drain; neighborhood gossip blames the
child's mother, whose search for a new GI
husband would have been hindered by a half
black son.
America's presence in Korea influences
Insu, not only through the American school
he attends, where teachers forbid Korean stu
dents to speak their native language or use
their Korean names, but also through his fa
ther's status as an American soldier. Even as
he and his friends playfully taunt the half
black James, he is constantly reminded of his
own dual identity as Heinz Insu Fenkl. The
cultural division even manifests itself among
the prostitutes in the back alleys of Pupyong
— some deal only with Gls, and others will
not take anyone who's not Korean.
Despite the prominence of this conflict, the
novel deals with issues beyond the obvious
theme of culture clash. Mostly, it is the story of
a boy forced to grow up too quickly, a boy who
has learned about the harshness of human re
lations on the filthy streets of a Korean town.
All the while, Insu is haunted in his
dreams by the image of a mysterious ghost, a
half-brother from the almost forgotten past.
"His was the face I so often took for my own.

and this time I knew his name — Kuristo, my
ghost brother."
The story line flows well and is comple
mented by the lyrical style and vivid but
frank discussion of the character's thoughts
and emotions. As a writer, Fenkl alternates
perspectives, beginning each chapter as the
adult narrator, evaluating memories from a
mature point of view. The rest of the chapter
is told from the child's perspective — in true
"Wonder Years" fashion, though this is a
much darker story.
This structure gives the novel a reflective
feel, as though the narrator is telling the story
and at the same time analyzing its impact on
his current life. He formulates an honest nar
rative which, despite the seemingly extreme
circumstances, brings to light the realities of
adolescence we've all had to face.
Mingling in the pages of the story are mys
tical undertones and the tradition of folk sto
ries told to Insu by his uncle Hyongbu. Insu
learns of women through his aunt's and
mother's relations with soldiers and through
his uncle's stories.
"A woman can ruin an entire bloodline,"
Hvongbu says. "A woman can suck vou drv of

your strength. And she's going to grow up
into a bitch, just like the rest of them."
Not all Hyongbu says of women is negative,
however. His story of the ginseng hunter por
t rays a loving wife who goes to all ends to save
her husband, an ailing ginseng flower hunter.
The novel is rich with many other stories,
and thesebecomean important part oflnsu's
life while intensifying his internal confusion.
This is a novel which touches the heart of
what every child experiences in the process of
growing up, with the added complications of
a mixed heritage.
FenkJ's fictional depiction of his own life
story is an extremely powerful first work,
demonstrating Fenkl's own belief in the im
portance of the narrative. As his uncle Hy
ongbu says to Insu, "You always ask me what
it means. And I always try to explain to you
that the meaning of the story is in the story. It
I could tell you what it meant, I'd just tell you
the meaning and throw the story away,
wouldn't I?"
