Students are used to performing public
service on a volunteer basis, solely for the
community good it provides. Now, howev
er, an ASSU-supported working group is
hoping Stanford will allow students to
minor in public service, receiving academ

With tea, juice and cookies, the group
served up a discussion of its plan to turn
public service into an academic minor last
night in Oak Lounge East. More than 20
people attended to discuss the structure of
such a program.
"There needs to be a strong connection

reciprocal relationship in which they both
enhance and add to each other."
Juergens added that "the people that
showed up tonight are very dedicated to
this cause and have a commitment to see
ing it through."
After dividing into small groups, the
participants discussed a wide range of is
sues related to the public service minor, in
cluding the definition of leadership, the

practicality of the minor and finding sup

"This is for students, and we want it to
be a real student initiative," said junior
Angie Mei, another of the coordinators.
Junior Marianna Sanchez said she is
too far into her academic career to start a
new minor but believes the public service
option is a great idea.

tangible reward. Many people spend as

(for Public Service as they do doing home
work."
