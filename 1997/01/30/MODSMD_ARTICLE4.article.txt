# Students hold meeting to discuss public service minor
## 
### Theresa Vargas Contributing writer 
Students are used to performing public
service on a volunteer basis, solely for the
community good it provides. Now, howev
er, an ASSU-supported working group is
hoping Stanford will allow students to
minor in public service, receiving academ
ic credit for their work.

With tea, juice and cookies, the group
served up a discussion of its plan to turn
public service into an academic minor last
night in Oak Lounge East. More than 20
people attended to discuss the structure of
such a program.
"There needs to be a strong connection
between our community and academics,"
said master's student Julie Juergens, one
of the program's six coordinators. "It is a

reciprocal relationship in which they both
enhance and add to each other."
Juergens added that "the people that
showed up tonight are very dedicated to
this cause and have a commitment to see
ing it through."
After dividing into small groups, the
participants discussed a wide range of is
sues related to the public service minor, in
cluding the definition of leadership, the

practicality of the minor and finding sup
port.
"This is for students, and we want it to
be a real student initiative," said junior
Angie Mei, another of the coordinators.
Junior Marianna Sanchez said she is
too far into her academic career to start a
new minor but believes the public service
option is a great idea.
"I think it will motivate Stanford stu

dents to get more involved in public ser
vice," Sanchez said. "It will give them a
tangible reward. Many people spend as
many or more hours in the Haas Center
(for Public Service as they do doing home
work."
Sophomore Tina Bhargava attended
hoping to coordinate Project Dosti — a six-
week summer program for stu
dents to do volunteer work in
India — with the public service
minor.
"So many people put so much
time in public service," Bhargava
said. "It would be nice to have
something from the University to
show for that."
Senior Leslie Anne Hummel
didn't classify herself as a prospec
tive public service student. Still,
she said, "This University as an ed
ucational institution serves its stu
dents much better by encouraging
the students to serve others."
According to Juergens, the pro
gram would provide leadership op
portunities to the University as
well.
"What Stanford does is heard
and seen throughout the nation,"
she said. "We have a chance to lead
the forefront."
While one coordinator, junior
Kelly Naylor, said the Haas Center
has been very receptive toward its
program, her fellow coordinator,
Mei, pointed to one problem area.
"We've talked to some faculty
members, but it's not moving
along," Mei said.
However, a faculty member
was present at the meeting to

show his support. Fred Stout, a
lecturer in the Program in Urban
Studies, said he's spent 20 years of
his life involved in public service.
"I would guess that half of what
I know and teach at this Universi
ty has come from that experience,"
Stout said.
The working group is made up
of six members and two interns,
including some who are active
with the ASSU. The idea of public
service as a minor originated with
in the group and is now part of the
ASSU's "University for Students"
campaign designed to encourage
university administrations to
focus on students' needs as their
primary mission.
"All of us (in the working
group) came from different back
grounds," Naylor said, but "we all
realized we had a common vision
for connecting our service work
with academics."
It is only a matter of time before
the minor becomes a part of Stan
ford's curriculum, Naylor added.
Juergens said the difference be
tween a "mediocre minor and a re
ally strong program" depends on
student support. She added that
many students come to Stanford
for the focus placed on public ser
vice and wants to "legitimize
that."
The next public service minor
meeting will be held Wednesday at
8:30 p.m. in the ASSU Office.
