# Jennifer Derr
## WOMEN WE LOVE 
### 
After spending my quarter in
Moscow, I decide to fly to Egypt
to spend a few weeks with my
roommate from last year, Jennifer Derr,
where she is studying in Cairo.
I bundle up for the plane ride anyway — I
can't forget the cold frostiness of Moscow even
as 1 picture the warmth that awaits me in Cairo.
Jenn is there at the airport, as she
promised. Her long blond hair blows tousled
in the humid air, and she reaches for me,
pulling me into her warm, tanned, California
skin. Pale and sweaty, I melt into her em
brace. She peels off my long black coat and
untangles my scarf.
"Talk to me," she says, as we climb into the
taxi. She gives the cab driver directions to her
dorm in downtown Cairo, all in Arabic. Peer
ing out the cab window, I look into the night
world of Cairo, the city that Jenn embraces
like she embraced me only minutes before.
Cairo is beautifully vulgar and passionately
dirty. The lotus flower hotels rise proudly on
the banks of the Nile river, and their reflec
tions shimmer in the water below.
Our friendship hasn't changed, even
though I haven't seen her in six months. We
head to a bar and she buys me the only kind
of beer they sell in Egypt — a cold Stella. I tell
her about the little towns 1 visited in Russia,
and 1 hear about her adventures in the Sinai
Desert.
We fall right back into our old patterns:
She borrows my clothes, I borrow her face
soap. We talk both about recently lost loves

and the Egyptian view of the Israel / Pales
tinian conflict. I tell her everything, and I lis
ten to her anything.
The next day we take the train to Alexan
dria and wander among the Greek and
Roman ruins there, discussing whether Ayn
Rand's character Howard Roark possesses
true integrity or not. Of course 1 lose the de
bate— Jenn can beat anyone in an argument.
We walk out to the Corniche, the road that
runs along the bay, and we watch the sun set
into the shifting waters. We buy peanuts
from kids on the street, and again Jenn
speaks in Arabic to them. The spindly dark
boys dance around us, shrieking gleefully the
few English words they know — "Hello,"
"Welcome" — they call out.
We walk back to the train station in the
dark, and a powerful rush fills me, and I, too,
want to dance about around my friend Jenn.
She has pulled me into her world, and people
dance around us, but it is she who deserves it.
Jenn pulls me in like a sister, but 1 know who
the dancing children really worship. I am
only her pale relflection, shimmering in the
water below her.
Jenn is the lotus flower. When she argues
with me, she wins; when she meets someone
new, she impresses them. She works in an on
cology lab 20 hours a week and is learning
Arabic because she thinks it's a beautiful lan
guage. When we drink together, she insists on
vodka shots. She can predict my thoughts,
and she stands up for me when I need help.
She is my friend, the alter ego that 1 only wish
1 were.

Jennifer Derr is a junior majoring in biology.

Love, according to Webster's Dictionary, can encompass emo
tions ranging from brotherly goodwill to plain old lust. In this
case, we're using the term to mean admiration: We look up to
the women mentioned on these pages for their myriad
achievements, both personal and professional. They embody,
variously, generosity, intelligence, athleticism, wit, strength
and kindness. We love these women because they are our role
models and our friends. Our lives are fuller because we've
known them.

The aging matriarch clutched her cane that
afternoon and tried to hold back tears.
Mrs. Moore did not live to see many more
Stanford students move through her halls and
enjoy her gift. She missed more afternoon vis
its and nervous curtsies and beaming smiles.
But after 40 years, those students are no less
grateful.
On a clear day, looking east from her hilltop
vista Florence Moore can see the Bay.
Thanks, Flo.
