# Francesca Beard

### 
Francesca Beard is a
woman of strength —
emotional and physical.
Elusive in spirit, she cul
tivated relationships that were
honest and strong.
I love her for her sense of
humor and unnerving powers of
perception. She realized thoughts
in friends and pinpointed their

vulnerabilities but maneuvered around them gracefully as only one
with her sensitivity could. Her sensitivity was the source of her
strength.
Her mastery of languages and personality tests impressed and en
tertained. Her honesty encouraged and criticized.
1 didn't get to know her well enough ... that is something I regret.
But my love for her is unquestionable. The memory of her smell, her

smile and her appreciation of beauty remain.
I think of her when I snowboard, when I see nimble fingers knit
ting great yarn creations and when I witness the blessings of friend
ship.
I wish I'd given a more enthusiastic "hello" that one spring day.
I try to remember that now when I rush past friends and ac
quaintances, zipping down the Row and through the Quad on my
bike.
Frankie taught me the value of people. She made me realize the evil
of the cursoriness with which we often lead our lives. She appreciated
the inadequacy of time yet still managed to avoid living her life in a
panic.
I love her for her intelligence, wisdom and biting sense of humor.
A dogwood tree stands outside Rinconada — a dorm of exemplary
collective strength — as a tribute to the impact her life had on me and
all those she came across.
Frankie is No. 1 — regardless of whether the tide is high. Mean
while, the rest of us just keep holding on ... and loving her.
