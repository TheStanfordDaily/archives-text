# Florence Moore

On a clear day, looking east from her
hilltop vista, Florence Moore can
see the Bay.
On a clear day, across Mayfield Avenue the
green blanket of oak, palm, eucalyptus and liq
uid amber fall gently to the water, dotted with
red tile roofs and disrupted only by the rising
form of Hoover Tower, Old Union and Memo
rial Church — symbols of Stanford's teachers,
its students and its spirit.
For Mrs. Moore, it was the only place to
build a dormitory.
Completed in the fall of 1956, Florence
Moore Hall was the dream of its benefactor.

With her $1 million donation, she conveyed a
series of instructions to ensure that certain de
tails were not overlooked.
The closets, she instructed, were to he large
enough to comfortably fit a woman's formal
gown and crinoline. The hallways, she suggest
ed, should he heated. And ice cream, she com
manded, would be available every day.
The first residents of Mrs. Moore's hall were
women, escaping from the aging walls of
Roble. Throughout its history, however, it has
cradled both sexes in its luxury — a reputation
it maintains 40 years after its construction.
Today, the seven houses — from Alondra to
Paloma — are home to both sexes, all classes
and Structured Liberal Education — fulfilling
a desire to bring learning to the dorm. But Mrs.

Moore saw to it that lessons are taught outside
the lecture lounge and seminar rooms.
The lack of urinals encourages gentlemen to
pay attention to the orientation of the toilet
seat. The circular tables invite dinner conversa
tion. The always-locked doors teach absent
minded students to keep track of their keys.
And the catwalks invite cross-wing interaction.
When the 92-year-old Moore visited her
namesake on Oct. 24, 1956, it was a clear day.
But she did not look to Hoover Tower or be
yond to the sea — she'd seen those before. In
stead, she spent the afternoon going from door
to door, meeting the students who occupied
her halls. When they learned her name, the
women offered polite curtsies and beaming
smiles and said, "Thank you, Mrs. Moore."
