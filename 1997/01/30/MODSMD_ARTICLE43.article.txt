# Condoleezza Rice
## 
### 
This week's edition of
Newsweek is devoted to pre
dictions of the 21 st century. In
2005, an article says, the president will
call a meeting of his top advisers to deal
with a tense military situation between
Russia and China. Included in the
group is his most trusted adviser, Secre
tary of State Condoleezza Rice.
What makes Condi — who has kind
ly devoted her past few years to serving
as Stanford's provost before moving on
to bigger and better Cabinet positions
— such a great person is that even when
she's secretary of state, I know she'll re
member and have kind words and a
smile for those who knew her back here
on the Farm.
When 1 came to work at The Daily as
a freshman, I was nervous beyond belief
when told to interview such a great fig
ure as Rice. Not only does she hold ar
guably the most important position in
the University, but she is one of the
smartest, most talented and strongest
women I've ever encountered.

She knows who she is and what she
stands for. She doesn't take anyone's
crap, and she doesn't hesitate to make
the hardest of decisions.
Behind this loomingly awesome
profile, however, Condi is friendly,
open and down-to-earth. During our
interview, she talked about work on the
newspaper at her alma mater, the Uni
versity of Denver, moving to a level
where we could relate to each other.
She has overcome teachers who told
her she wasn't "college material," accu
sations of deserting multiculturalism
and society's standard prejudices
against women and minorities.
With such varied talents that she
could have become a concert pianist
rather than the country's foremost ex
pert on Soviet and East German politics,
Condi is everything a woman could want
in a role model. She has done what she set
out to do, well and with conviction.
Watching her answer questions at
Faculty Senate meetings, meet with de
tractors and supporters, you know she
has discovered and fallen in love with
who she is.
And that's why we've fallen in love
with her.
