# Kate Starbird
## 
### 
She stands 6-foot-2, is currently averaging just
under 30 points per game in Pacific 10 Confer
ence action and plays with a fiery intensity that

you wouldn't expect from such a quiet-looking person.
Her name is Catharine Evelyn Starbird, but everyone
knows her simply as Kate.
Known for leading by example, the placid 21 -year-old is
no doubt a crowd favorite at any home Stanford basketball
match. Her skills have earned her numerous awards and
honors, and she currently holds the school record for most
points scored in a single game (44 against USClast season).
At the rate she is going, Kate will probably have scored
more points in her Stanford career than any other female
basketball player in school history.
OK, so she can play some ball. Hut what makes fans, like
me, love her so much? More than just her athletic skills,
Kate's hunger for success is what we all would like to have
inside of us. We love Kate because she gives credence to the
old adage that hard work truly does pay off.
Kate's talents extend far beyond the basketball court,
however. In addition to lighting it up on the floor, she opted
to major in one of the most time-consuming subjects at
Stanford. Yes, that's right, she is a computer science major.
(1 have to admit, it took some time getting used to seeing
Kate hunched over one of the Sweet Hall machines.)
How does she do it? The question puzzles me personal
ly, and maybe that's another reason whv we love Kate. In ad
dition to MVP and player of the year awards, she has also
been named to the Pac-10 All-Academic Team twice.
She makes it all look so easy, yet vou know that behind
that calm demeanor of hers is a burning flame that won't
accept failure as an option.
While many players and sports analysts around the
country have grown an admiration for the abilities of No.
30, here on the Farm, it's a little different. We don't just ad
mire Starbird, we love her... for just being Kate.
