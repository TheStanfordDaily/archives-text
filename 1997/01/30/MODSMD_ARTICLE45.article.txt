# Joss Marsh

### 
Prof. Joss Marsh is a scholar, but if she were a writer of fic
tion, it wouldn't be tough to imagine what kind of novel
she'd write. Maybe something with Dickensian elements,
the author she knows so much about; maybe something centering
around a teacher, someone who is deeply committed to the intellec
tual lives of her students.
Whatever narrative she chose, it would most likely betray her in
tense interest in human beings, her great generosity toward people
and her deep commitment to make the kind of changes she believes
in. For Marsh is someone who is genuinely interested in intellectual
ly challenging her students, in and out of the classroom.
Her "Cinema and Literature" class, which was meant to be a small,
seminar-type affair, has blossomed into one of the English Depart
ment's largest and most popular classes. I took the class last fall, and
1 was surprised to see the level of commitment of everyone in the
class. Going to Meyer Library on any given day meant running into
students checking out the assigned film list and diligently taking
notes.
Marsh's classroom style sparks that sort of excitement in those lis
tening. She makes literary research exciting, drawing parallels be
tween the novels she's talking about and the culture of the period, re
vealing in fresh and often fascinating ways the influences and inspi
rations that shape the work of authors such as Dickens or Fitzgerald.
Marsh is committed to students out of the classroom as well. Her
office hours generally overflow with students seeking guidance and
advice. And as director of the undergraduate program in English,

Marsh has begun implementing changes to make the major friend
lier and richer in resources. She is deeply committed to treating stu
dents as human beings whose intellect needs to be fed and taken care
of.
For these reasons and more, Prof. Marsh is a woman we love.
