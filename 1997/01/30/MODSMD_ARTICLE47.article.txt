## The 						Joys and Payne of Directing 'Ruth' Why this Stanford grad is still waiting for some angry phone calls 
### Kerry Rodgers 
From the outset, Alexander Payne seems
like a really nice, normal Stanford alumnus.
Before we get started he asks me all kinds
of polite questions about school and my
major and the screening 1 went to for his new
movie.
But underneath it all, he has a hit of a ten
dency for the outrageous.
"Personally, of course, I feel abortion
should be mandatory for everyone including
men," Payne provocatively told me on the
phone, exasperated after too much talk
about the issue.
As director and co-writer of the recently
released "Citizen Ruth," Payne has been
asked a lot of questions about abortion late
ly.
But the movie, he insists, is not actually
about abortion but rather about "the politics
around the issue."
It may seem like a subtle distinction, but
it's an important one that many critics seem
to be missing, to Payne's frustration.
"The discussion is always about, 'Oh
they're fair on the abortion issue,' or, 'They
come down on this side,' or 'They don't take
a side, they cop out,' and it's like all about this
goddamn abortion issue, which is like just an
excuse to be in that film and to see someone
amoral among a bunch of moral people and
just to explore these American types," Payne
said.
"Citizen Ruth" is an ambitious project for
a feature debut — to delve head on into this
explosive issue from a comic perspective.
And Payne certainly paid his dues during the
long and painful struggle to get financial
backing for the film. Somehow it came
through and for only $3.5 million Payne
managed to assemble a great cast and make a
quality film.
Interestingly, Payne, who considered be
coming a journalist after graduating from
Stanford in '84, got the inspiration for the
film while reading the morning news and
sputtering over his coffee.
"The film was suggested by news stories,
but we didn't think, 'Oh, let's make this
movie about abortion.' It just came from
going, 'Jim [Taylor, co-writer], can you be
lieve this?!' Like I remember in one, some guy
at one point had actually changed his name
to Pro-life Anderson.... It becomes such a
window into Americana."
Payne's own life reads like a bit of the
American dream: Son of a Greek restaurant
owner, he spent much of his childhood in
Omaha, Neb., being obsessed with classic
comedy film. He came to Stanford as an un
dergraduate, where he said he "purposely
didn't take a single film class ... so I could
just concentrate on my liberal education."
Payne took the whole well-rounded edu
cation approach quite seriously. He was in
Structured Liberal Education, he spent his
junior year studying overseas in Spain, and
he majored in history and Spanish literature.
Though he thinks of Stanford fondly and be

lieves all he learned has served him well, he
also concedes that he has had to unlearn "a
lot of what 1 was trained to do at Stanford."
"In entering a creative field, one thing I
have had to work on is not thinking ... find
ing other processes in myself separate from a
rational, logical, analytical point of view be
cause when you do creative work you have to
encourage instinct and irrationality," Payne
said.
That's quite an artsy comment from a
Stanford alum, so I inquire if Payne's parents
were early hippies or something.
Nope.
"1 come from a kind of traditional Greek
background, you know, medicine, law and
business — and that's it,"he said. However,
they didn't object too much when he decided
to enroll in UCLA's graduate school of film
over Columbia's graduate school of journal
ism.
"They were supportive because they love
me and they're good parents," Payne ex
plained. As for himself, "I couldn't not go
into film, 1 mean ... life's too short."
So after film school and "five proverbial
years of struggle," Payne has found himself in
the precarious position of being a misunder
stood artist — many critics, he believes, are
not seeing his "point of view about the
world" which lies behind the superficial
story of the film.
"It's not like I have that point of view for
mulated. It's something you only get out
through making the film and seeing what it

is," he cryptically explained.
For him, filmmaking is a highly personal
and expressive endeavor. When I ask him
what he likes most about his job, he first an
swers in snippets about touching film and
working with actors and then says, "What's
best about it really — this is the most high
falutin answer but it's true — is, well, discov
ering myself.
"But it's true," Payne continued, "because
I don't go to therapy; 1 have no idea who I am,
I don't really care, but in film, what's occur
ring to me — I can just put it out there and
go, 'Is that what 1 think about? Is that really
who I am?' It's a medium of self discovery."
It's the whole self-discovery kick that
seems to be driving Payne's decision to set his
movies (both "Citizen Ruth" and his next
one, "Election") in his hometown, Omaha.
"Early in people's careers, you know, writ
ers and stuff, they always want to deal with
where they're from. They just feel comfort
able in it."
But there's a political motivation as well:
"I've rarely seen the Midwest represented on
film accurately."
His connection to his home has made it
difficult for Payne to now live in the City of
Angels.
"Having to live here is the single greatest
sacrifice you make if you want to be in film,"
Payne wryly said.
At least his house isn't being vandalized.
When the movie was coming out people

suggested that he unlist his name in the
phone book, to prevent him from being the
victim of some abortion activist.
"I'm real disappointed," he said in a mock
self-pitying tone. "I haven't gotten a single
letter or phone call or e-mail or fax from any
one upset! And I'm still listed in the phone
book."
Payne theorizes on the greater signifi
cance of a film having to do with abortion
that doesn't elicit riots: "Either [it] hasn't
penetrated the culture enough, or it's a sign
of the times that we're all — even fanatics —
we're all beyond it, beyond knee-jerk re
sponses to this, and that feeling that, 'Oh, if
you're not for me you're against me, and so
I'm going to picket you.' "
Even so, I'm still surprised that Payne's
mailbox hasn't been egged yet because I
think there are people who would say that
abortion is too sacred of an issue to be the
subject of a satire.
Payne objects: "[lf] you use satire that has
a humanist heart to it, you can do anything.
Satire is so healthy. We always need to laugh
at ourselves, no matter what pain we're going
through, even when our parents die or we get
really sick or when you're being bombed in
Sarajevo every day for four years.
"Humor allows us always to distance our
selves from the gravity of our circumstances
and survive and have a fresher look at it."
Amen.

window into Americana."
Payne's own life reads like a bit of the
American dream: Son of a Greek restaurant
owner, he spent much of his childhood in
Omaha, Neb., being obsessed with classic
comedy film. He came to Stanford as an un
dergraduate, where he said he "purposely
didn't take a single film class ... so I could
just concentrate on my liberal education."
Payne took the whole well-rounded edu
cation approach quite seriously. He was in
Structured Liberal Education, he spent his
junior year studying overseas in Spain, and
he majored in history and Spanish literature.
Though he thinks of Stanford fondly and be

lieves all he learned has served him well, he
also concedes that he has had to unlearn "a
lot of what 1 was trained to do at Stanford."
"In entering a creative field, one thing I
have had to work on is not thinking ... find
ing other processes in myself separate from a
rational, logical, analytical point of view be
cause when you do creative work you have to
encourage instinct and irrationality," Payne
said.
That's quite an artsy comment from a
Stanford alum, so I inquire if Payne's parents
were early hippies or something.
Nope.
"1 come from a kind of traditional Greek
background, you know, medicine, law and
business — and that's it,"he said. However,
they didn't object too much when he decided
to enroll in UCLA's graduate school of film
over Columbia's graduate school of journal
ism.
"They were supportive because they love
me and they're good parents," Payne ex
plained. As for himself, "I couldn't not go
into film, 1 mean ... life's too short."
So after film school and "five proverbial
years of struggle," Payne has found himself in
the precarious position of being a misunder
stood artist — many critics, he believes, are
not seeing his "point of view about the
world" which lies behind the superficial
story of the film.
"It's not like I have that point of view for
mulated. It's something you only get out
through making the film and seeing what it

is," he cryptically explained.
For him, filmmaking is a highly personal
and expressive endeavor. When I ask him
what he likes most about his job, he first an
swers in snippets about touching film and
working with actors and then says, "What's
best about it really — this is the most high
falutin answer but it's true — is, well, discov
ering myself.
"But it's true," Payne continued, "because
I don't go to therapy; 1 have no idea who I am,
I don't really care, but in film, what's occur
ring to me — I can just put it out there and
go, 'Is that what 1 think about? Is that really
who I am?' It's a medium of self discovery."
It's the whole self-discovery kick that
seems to be driving Payne's decision to set his
movies (both "Citizen Ruth" and his next
one, "Election") in his hometown, Omaha.
"Early in people's careers, you know, writ
ers and stuff, they always want to deal with
where they're from. They just feel comfort
able in it."
But there's a political motivation as well:
"I've rarely seen the Midwest represented on
film accurately."
His connection to his home has made it
difficult for Payne to now live in the City of
Angels.
"Having to live here is the single greatest
sacrifice you make if you want to be in film,"
Payne wryly said.
At least his house isn't being vandalized.
When the movie was coming out people

suggested that he unlist his name in the
phone book, to prevent him from being the
victim of some abortion activist.
"I'm real disappointed," he said in a mock
self-pitying tone. "I haven't gotten a single
letter or phone call or e-mail or fax from any
one upset! And I'm still listed in the phone
book."
Payne theorizes on the greater signifi
cance of a film having to do with abortion
that doesn't elicit riots: "Either [it] hasn't
penetrated the culture enough, or it's a sign
of the times that we're all — even fanatics —
we're all beyond it, beyond knee-jerk re
sponses to this, and that feeling that, 'Oh, if
you're not for me you're against me, and so
I'm going to picket you.' "
Even so, I'm still surprised that Payne's
mailbox hasn't been egged yet because I
think there are people who would say that
abortion is too sacred of an issue to be the
subject of a satire.
Payne objects: "[lf] you use satire that has
a humanist heart to it, you can do anything.
Satire is so healthy. We always need to laugh
at ourselves, no matter what pain we're going
through, even when our parents die or we get
really sick or when you're being bombed in
Sarajevo every day for four years.
"Humor allows us always to distance our
selves from the gravity of our circumstances
and survive and have a fresher look at it."
Amen.
