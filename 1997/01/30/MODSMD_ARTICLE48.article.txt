# Aesthetic Shock
## Fritsch show at the SFMOMA intensely disturbing, worth a look 
### Elisabeth Morse 
In a class, I recently spent a good deal of
time looking at a Liechtenstein painting
called "Forget It." Done in Liechtenstein's
typical red, yellow and blue cartoonish style,
the painting displayed the word "ART," its big
block letters mocking itself.

ART REVIEW

For most moderately educated and inter
ested people, the desire to seem intellectual
with a healthy appreciation for beauty is
strong. Yet the average human being's muse
um endurance limit is not more than an
hour, and I would be surprised to find a ca
sual viewer who could tell you the differences
between a Boticelli and a Filippo Lippi.
Let's face it. Modern society's fascination
with art has become as much a lifestyle thing
as an aesthetic value system, as the pop artists
so loudly declared, lust as Andy Warhol's
greatest work was his career (or so claims my
art history professor), the viewing of art now
often has little to do with the art itself, or en
richment and education. For a busy student,
it's no surprise that unless an "artsy" experi
ence is entertaining and fun, it will be skipped.
With this in mind, I'd like to present you
with some whimsical and worthwhile muse
u my endeavors. Not only will I tell you where
to go and what to see, I will tell you a bit
about what you are seeing so that you will
have some background knowledge and criti
cism with which to impress your friends, as
well as about a nearby cafe that you can go to
afterward to flaunt your wearing of black and
your newly acquired visual opinions.
As always, start with the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art (I can't say this
enough), located at 151 Third St.in San
Francisco. From now through March 11,
there's a show by the German artist, Kathari
na Fritsch.
When one walks off the elevator onto the
fifth floor of the museum, one is confronted
by a crime scene — a roped-off area includ
ing a sheet and a large smear of blood.
1 ritsch's "Ghost and Fool of Blood" (19K8)
immediately gave me the impression that I
had entered a reality where normal norms no
longer applied, where the dead come back to
life and where there are gruesome murders
on the immaculate hard-wood floors of art
museums.
What is appealing about Fritsch's work is
that at first it is visually amusing, but when
looked at more closely, it becomes intensely
disturbing. "Ghost and Pool of Blood," with
its floating specter, seems novel. However,
upon further inspection, one realizes that the
blood is approximately the same size and
shape as the ghost, suggesting a violent
death; the piece quickly becomes introspec
tive and dark.
My initial reaction to "Man and Mouse"
(1991-1992) was also laughter. A colossal

black mouse perched on a white platform of
sorts is an understandable cause for mirth.
But "Man and Mouse" is actually replete with
what could be interpreted as Holocaust refer
ences. The platform is actually a wooden
plank bed containing a purely white man —
a death mask, at best. The man is probably
being crushed by the large black mouse
(white and black being a play of good and
evil). Finally, the image of the mouse was for
ever immortalized in Art Spiegelman's
"Maus" series as the degraded position Jews
were put in during World War II (the Nazis
were drawn as cats).
Not all of Fritsch's work is depressing, but
most of it is strange and wields some type of a
double-edged sword. "Company at Table"

(1988), with its super-long table, mechanical
ly checked red table cloth and 32 identical and
largely featureless men with white faces, white
hands and black clothes, is quite surreal.
But Fritsch's reference is actually to mini
malism, an art movement of the '60s which
used simple repetition as one of its primary
tools (for example: plain white cubes repeat
ed four times). By repeating a recognizable
subject more times than the human eye is ac
customed to, Fritsch abstracts what is a real
istic subject quite effectively. As 1 watched
viewers bending down at the end of the table
to admire the effect that the rows of the men's
legs made, I realized that Fritsch had elegant
ly transformed a recognizable topic into
something which could be formally appreci

ated in aesthetic terms. This is no easy feat.
Fritsch also plays with the kitsch but less
successfully. The second room of the show
features a tower of neon yellow Madonnas,
reminding me primarily of the time in high
school when a punk-rock friend of mine stole
a statue from a church and painted it glow
in-the-dark yellow. Religion and kitsch have
been done already, and Fritsch's take on the
combination doesn't seem particularly origi
nal or appealing.
From the Fritsch show, proceed to the
show of Paul Klee drawings on the second
floor. These are actually part of the perma
nent exhibits, but they make a nice transi
tion. Klee, another German artist, presents a
series of "fantastic creatures" which are

amusing with a hard, cutting
side. The quote on the wall
suggests that Klee viewed all
of his creatures as self-por
traits, a disturbing idea con
sidering how grotesque
some of the drawings are.
"Threatening Head"
(1905) is an etching of a
scary head with a mouse-like
creature (maybe a weasel)
perched on top of it. "Vegetal
Evil" (1927) depicts plant
people, one lying down and
the other dancing. "Stachel,
the Clown" (1931) is a prick
ly creature, taking one's per
ceptions of clowns as plavhi!
fellows and twisting them.
If all of this seems too high
brow, you ought to take a
trip to the C alifornia Histor
ical Society 678 Mission
St.), which is right across the
street. Ihe society otters a
cheap alternative to the Sf

includes paintings and pho
tographs dealing with the
historv of ( alifornia iduh,.
some ot which are prett\

largely featureless men with white faces, white
hands and black clothes, is quite surreal.
But Fritsch's reference is actually to mini
malism, an art movement of the '60s which
used simple repetition as one of its primary
tools (for example: plain white cubes repeat
ed four times). By repeating a recognizable
subject more times than the human eye is ac
customed to, Fritsch abstracts what is a real
istic subject quite effectively. As 1 watched
viewers bending down at the end of the table
to admire the effect that the rows of the men's
legs made, I realized that Fritsch had elegant
ly transformed a recognizable topic into
something which could be formally appreci

ated in aesthetic terms. This is no easy feat.
Fritsch also plays with the kitsch but less
successfully. The second room of the show
features a tower of neon yellow Madonnas,
reminding me primarily of the time in high
school when a punk-rock friend of mine stole
a statue from a church and painted it glow
in-the-dark yellow. Religion and kitsch have
been done already, and Fritsch's take on the
combination doesn't seem particularly origi
nal or appealing.
From the Fritsch show, proceed to the
show of Paul Klee drawings on the second
floor. These are actually part of the perma
nent exhibits, but they make a nice transi
tion. Klee, another German artist, presents a
series of "fantastic creatures" which are

amusing with a hard, cutting
side. The quote on the wall
suggests that Klee viewed all
of his creatures as self-por
traits, a disturbing idea con
sidering how grotesque
some of the drawings are.
"Threatening Head"
(1905) is an etching of a
scary head with a mouse-like
creature (maybe a weasel)
perched on top of it. "Vegetal
Evil" (1927) depicts plant
people, one lying down and
the other dancing. "Stachel,
the Clown" (1931) is a prick
ly creature, taking one's per
ceptions of clowns as plavhi!
fellows and twisting them.
If all of this seems too high
brow, you ought to take a
trip to the C alifornia Histor
ical Society 678 Mission
St.), which is right across the
street. Ihe society otters a
cheap alternative to the Sf
MOMA for all ofvou star\
ing fu//y maiors out there. It
includes paintings and pho
tographs dealing with the
historv of ( alifornia iduh,.
some ot which are prett\
cheesy and some ot whi«.h
are neat. Also, it's got a tan
tastic bookstore.
After you are done with
your museuming, walk over
to Lulu (816 Folsom St , i
restaurant / bar between
Fourth and Fifth streets. For
anyone used to eating in
New York, the food isn't
good enough tor the prices
charged. However, lulu is
definitely a place to see and
be seen. !sit at the bar, bu\ a
drink and lust exude cool
ness. Atter all, you've spent
the rest of the dav working
your eyes; you deserve a
break.
