## The 						Dead Live Two multi-disc collections demonstrate just what a long, strange trip it's been "Dozin' at the Knick" "The Arista Years" 
### 
One legend. Two compilations. Three
decades. Four million Deadheads. Five
compact discs. A little overwhelming, eh?
Such a serious mass of music, as offered in
two new retrospective releases "Dozin' at
the Knick" (Arista Records) and"The Arista
Years" (Arista Records), warrants serious
attention.
"Dozin' at the Knick" is a collection of
live recordings selected from numerous sets
played over a three day period at the
Knickerbocker Arena in Albany, New York
in the spring of 1990. I'm only an amateur
Deadhead, but there are several amazing
songs on this album that I had never heard:
"Row Jimmy," "Lady With A Fan" and
"Black Peter" to name a few.
The first CD contains gems like
"Dupree's Diamond Blues" and "Walkin'
Blues." 1 love Jerry's advice to "never trust a
woman who wears her pants too tight / she
might love you tomorrow / she'll be gone
tomorrow night" in "Never Trust A
Woman." Take this to heart, all — laconic
philosophy at its best. The First CD conveys

the generic, though classic, live sound of the
Dead — slower tempos, longer instrumen
tal and funky improvisation.
The second CD in the album begins with

a continuation of the upbeat
melodies from the first CD

with "Playing in the
Band" and "Uncle

John's Band" but
quickly lapses

into the psy
ched e 1 i c
realm for
which the
Dead is fa
mous. The j

last three
songs on
this CD,
"Mud Love

Buddy

Jam,"
"Drums"
and "Space"

reveal an

eclectic,
freestyle exper
imentation with
music that is not
often found on
formal record
ings.

The third CD con
tinues with the spiritual

element introduced on

disc two, but slides back toward
mainstream sound to conclude

the anthology. The Dead does Dylan's "All
Along the Watchtower" as well as their own
classics "And We Bid You Goodnight" and
"Goin' Down the Road Feeling Bad".
All three-plus hours of the Grateful

Dead's live "Dozin' At
The Knick" is well

worth shelling out
the dough for

and will proba
bly become a

collector's
item. I

have yet
to find
such a di-

verse,
well-exe
cuted col
lection of
Dead
music on

one
album
and high-

ly recom
mend it for

novices and
experts alike.
In compari-

son, "The Arista
Years" seems a
bit more con-

trived. This col
lection includes ex-

cerpts from eight al
bums over a course of 13

years: "Terrapin Station,"
"Shakedown Street," "Go to

Heaven," "Reckoning," "Dead Set," "In The
Dark," "Built to Last" and "Without A Net."
Most songs are straight off the album and
are therefore a bit redundant for those who
already have the originals.
However, disc one proffers the complete
rendition of the suite "Terrapin Station"
with all seven movements intact — a true
talent exhibition recorded with a full choir
and orchestra. This edition far outshines
the same release on the "Dozin' at the
Knick" collection. The first disc also con
tains mainstream favorites like "Shakedown
Street" and "Fire on the Mountain." Disc
two, however, is pretty generic.
"The Arista Years" showcases a prolific
time for the Grateful Dead and tries to exact
the feeling from each album with a careful
selection of songs. However, this compila
tion adds nothing new to the already exist
ing albums except that it offers an abbrevi
ated version for those listeners with short
attention spans.
Be warned: After a five-disc, six-hour
Grateful Dead listening spree, your body
will turn into a gelatinous pile of timpanic
membrane and cochlea reverberating with
funkified guitar riffs and tribal drum beats.
I wouldn't try this experience in a con
densed period of time, but 1 definitely rec
ommend obtaining either "Dozin* at the
Knick" or "The Arista Years" (preferably
the former) for pure, relaxed, interspersed
with-other-music, listening enjoyment.
