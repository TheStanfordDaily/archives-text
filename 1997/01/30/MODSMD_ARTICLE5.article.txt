# Credit Union employees claim mismanagement

### Dana Hangai Staff writer 
The Stanford Federal Credit
Union is mismanaging projects and
wasting members' money, accord
ing to a former purchasing coordi
nator at the credit union.
Scott Reid, who worked for the
credit union for more than five
years before resigning in Novem
ber, said more than $300,000 was
wasted on the "Optical" project â€” a
new computer system with greater
storage capacity.
A current employee said the pro
ject was designed to "download
statements and reports from our
main host computer to another
computer system and present that
information via our local area net
work to staff." It was also to include
scanned signature cards and some
other information, the employee
said. The 2-year-old project was
scheduled to become operational at
the start of this year.
However, Reid claims that the
project was badly mismanaged and
a terrible allocation of resources.
The product was supposed to be de
veloped by NPA West, a computer
systems company, but the credit
union management of the project
was given to people who did not un
derstand technology. When the Op

tical system failed to work, the
management tried to recover the
lost money and renamed the project
the Viper project.
The current employee also
agreed that the Optical project lost
a lot of money and was poorly run.
"What they (the company) were
delivering to us was not what we
purchased, and they were pretty
much making it up as we went
along," the employee said. "So
when they finally had something to
deliver to us, that's when they real
ized it wouldn't work."
Products were purchased by the
credit union with no advice from
the technical departments, accord
ing to a former technician there.
"Basically we were given pro
jects that were already bought and
told to fix it,"the technician said.
"If it didn't work, it became our
problem," even though the projects
had often been purchased without
any advice and an "understanding
of our network."
The credit union also started an
intranet project in March which
was supposed to provide policies
and forms to the employees, accord
ing to Reid.
"It's not there," Reid said. "It's
supposed to have been done by July.
