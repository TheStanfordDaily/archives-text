# Credit Union employees claim mismanagement
## 
### Dana Hangai Staff writer 
The Stanford Federal Credit
Union is mismanaging projects and
wasting members' money, accord
ing to a former purchasing coordi
nator at the credit union.
Scott Reid, who worked for the
credit union for more than five
years before resigning in Novem
ber, said more than $300,000 was
wasted on the "Optical" project â€” a
new computer system with greater
storage capacity.
A current employee said the pro
ject was designed to "download
statements and reports from our
main host computer to another
computer system and present that
information via our local area net
work to staff." It was also to include
scanned signature cards and some
other information, the employee
said. The 2-year-old project was
scheduled to become operational at
the start of this year.
However, Reid claims that the
project was badly mismanaged and
a terrible allocation of resources.
The product was supposed to be de
veloped by NPA West, a computer
systems company, but the credit
union management of the project
was given to people who did not un
derstand technology. When the Op

tical system failed to work, the
management tried to recover the
lost money and renamed the project
the Viper project.
The current employee also
agreed that the Optical project lost
a lot of money and was poorly run.
"What they (the company) were
delivering to us was not what we
purchased, and they were pretty
much making it up as we went
along," the employee said. "So
when they finally had something to
deliver to us, that's when they real
ized it wouldn't work."
Products were purchased by the
credit union with no advice from
the technical departments, accord
ing to a former technician there.
"Basically we were given pro
jects that were already bought and
told to fix it,"the technician said.
"If it didn't work, it became our
problem," even though the projects
had often been purchased without
any advice and an "understanding
of our network."
The credit union also started an
intranet project in March which
was supposed to provide policies
and forms to the employees, accord
ing to Reid.
"It's not there," Reid said. "It's
supposed to have been done by July.
They don't have the information.
All they have is the disheveled re
mains of what they tried to start.
There are no biographies, no poli
cies and two forms. A lot of time and
money were spent."
One ex-employee also claimed
that the manager of the project
lacked any experience with data
processing and "didn't know any-

thing about what I did." He later
left because of the working experi
ence under the manager.
Human Resources Departmetnt
Vice President Michael Hiller said
the intranet project was not yet
ready, but "it's still being devel
oped. Information is gradually
being added to it."
Ileid also agreed with former em
ployee Edward Escobedo's state
ments about the lack of concern for
the credit union employees. Escobe
do previously told The Daily he was
unfairly fired for questioning an

order he believed was contradicting
company policy.
Reid claimed he had an ongoing
back problem for two years and
Human Resources "wouldn't take
care of it for my insurance," he said.
"My description says I'm a desk
clerk, and I'm supposed to be sitting
at a keyboard. Instead, I had to do a
lot of physical work and lift boxes.
"I would go to them and [Human
Resources] would say, 'We'll work
on it,' and then you'll never hear
about it," Reid said. "They neglect
ed it for a long time, and it was high

ly visible."
A source in the credit union
agreed that the company does not
treat its workers well.
"There's been a number of un
happy people here," the source said.
"You look at the bottom line, the bot
tom line doesn't say that, but if you
look at other things, such as the num
ber of people who've left and who
they are, that tells us a new story."
Hiller declined to comment on
employee complaints, saying it was
against company policy to discuss
personnel matters publicly.
