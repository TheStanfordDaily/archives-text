# NERF HERDER
## Self-titled 
### 
It's nice to see that "alternative" music fi
nally has a sense of humor. Now that groups
such as Weezer, Barenaked Ladies and the
Presidents of the United States of America
have gained significant recognition, angst is
no longer the only path to success.
In the footsteps of these quirky bands
comes a new, seemingly conventional rock
trio from Santa Barbara named Nerf Herder
(a smart reference to one of Princess Leia's
lines from"The Empire Strikes Back") with a
self-titled debut album (My Records). The
group's most obvious trait is its unique comic
instinct, apparent on tracks such as "Van
Halen," a fan's history of the rise and fall of
the supergroup.
On "Nosering Girl," an off-beat ode to an
alternative goddess, the group's lead singer,
Parry (who appears to have only one name)
reveals that "She was the kind of iiirl who you

would give up eating meat for / No more sala
mi / No more steak and potatoes."
Further, the group's humor often takes a
decidely dark turn, as with "Sorry," an apolo
gy from an obsessive ex-boyfriend: "Sorry I
showed up at your wedding / Sorry I tried so
hard to get in / Sorry 1 screwed up your pic
tures / Sorry I had sex with you sister."
More importantly, the group's eccentrici
ties are supported by a muscular, convincing
sound, combining the instrumental blur of
the Clash with the upbeat vocal harmonies of
early Van Halen. Pop punk has rarely been
this much fun.
A more apt comparison, however, might
actually be with the Police. Like that group
(whose music was originally promoted as
punk), Nerf Herder is a good band trying to
sound dumb. Beneath the appealing vocals
lies a surprisingly complex interplay between
the bass guitar and drums.
Accordingly, the albums most successful
moments come when the music matches the
lyrics, such as with "Easy Mark," a poignant
tale of escape and redemption from an abu
sive relationship.
On one of the album's best tracks, "Golf

shirt," the hand even creates an anthem for
"nice-guys," as Parry sings that although "I'm
not the one you dream about / I'm not the
one you can't live without /.. . When you're
tired of all the jerks / When you're tired of all
the work / And when you're tired of being
hurt / You will long for the comfort of my
golfshirt."
Nerf Herder is a solid band which makes
interesting and irreverent music. Enjoy them
now before they get serious and boring.
