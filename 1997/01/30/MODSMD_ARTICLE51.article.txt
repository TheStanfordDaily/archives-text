# TREBLE CHARGER
## "Self-title" 
### 
Think of an average band: average lyrics,
average guitars, average melodies. Nothing
special, but not dreadfully dull either. If you
have difficulty imagining this band, don't
worry. Bands are remembered for their
"hook" — that look, sound or stage presence
that makes them distinguishable from the

rest of the herd. Lacking a hook, Treble
Charger need not be committed to memory.
No one else will remember them, so why
should you?
The average band would have to be alter
native. It would include four members: a
bassist, a drummer and a couple of singing
guitarists. It would blend the sounds of pop
ular bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and
Nirvana. This blend would not repulse the
listeners but instead make them shrug and
think, "Yeah... so?" The band would be great
at a fraternity party, where no one was really
listening. Their lyrics would convey a decent
message, without the poetic genius that sets
apart the truly great bands.
Treble Charger is average to the core. Lest
you mistake this normalcy for mediocrity, it
should be explained that, technically, the
band gets it done. The sound is solid on each
of the nine songs on their debut album
"Self=title" (BMti Entertainment). For a
first foray into recording, the Canadian quar
tet is all right but absolutely devoid of indi
viduality. In a musical genre that changes
more quickly than the Hypercolor T-shirt
that I wore in junior high, the key to success
