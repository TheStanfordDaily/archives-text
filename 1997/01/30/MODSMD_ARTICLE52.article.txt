is to take a risk — to live not on the cutting
edge but on the bleeding edge, where innova
tion is encouraged for its own sake and inge
nuity is rewarded.
The majority of the album's songs are
classic grunge (if such a thing yet exists). Of
course, there is the obligatory ballad ("Dis
claimer"), the slow-starting-then-explod
ing anthem ("Morale"), the fuzzied vocal
song ("Slight") and a Cure-wanna-be ("Sick
Friend Called") thrown in for good mea
sure.
Nothing about this band stands out, and
ultimately, Treble Charger's uninspirationl
grab at stardom reminds us how sour the au
thentic, idealistic and well-intentioned
grunge movement has gone.

gressive groove with a thumping bass by Evil
Jared, horns and quirky sound effects, not to
mention cool guitar and catchy vocals.
"Fire Water Burn," the Bloodhound
Cang's claim to fame single, is a beautiful pop
song. It begins with a calm acoustic guitar
and the brilliant lyrics, "The roof is on
fire / We don't need no water let the mother
fucker burn / Burn motherfucker burn,"
then a grinding sludge guitar is introduced,
and the lyrics get funnier and catchier. "I'm
not black like Barry White, no I am white like
Frank Black is," Jimmy Pop Ali rhymes.
Ali's raps are real masterpieces. On "Shut
Up," Ali sings, "And I don't give a damn if you
don't like me / 'Cause I don't like you 'cause

you're not like me /1 hate a lot of whites and
I hate a lot of blacks /1 hate poopin' in public
places but we all hate that." Among other
things on the album, the lyrics mention Old
Milwaukee Jolt black coffee, the Flamin' Waf
fle, a body-building elf, Judas Priest, Po
laroids and Mark Twain.
You want punk rock? Bloodhound Gang
does punk rock. From the opening "Kiss Me
Where It Smells Funny," rock complemented
by DJ Q-Ball's turntables and female "oohs"
and "aahs" (a la White Zombie samples), to
the hilarious "I Wish I Was Queer So I Could
Get Chicks," the Gang delivers. All of the hard
rock songs are driven by Lupus' manic guitar
jams.

The Run DMC cover "It's Tricky" has a
kick-ass drum solo complements of Spankv
G.
Bloodhound Gang has something for just
about everyone who appreciates the contem
porary music scene, especially those who ap
preciate Beastie Boys, Sublime, 311 and Gake.
While the band refuses to take anything seri
ously (the liner notes begin with a quick mes
sage from the band: "If you find the content of
these lyrics offensive, you're not cool"), the
talent of the musicians is obvious. Blood
hound Gang takes pop music and they turn it
inside out. The result is a 46-minute united
hodgepodge of club-blastin' tunes. Three
thumbs up.
