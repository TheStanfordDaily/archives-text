## Animal House The
						'Wanda' troupe mix and match with 'Fierce Creatures' 
### 
lohn Cleese and the all-star cast of a "A Fish C Called
Wanda" returned to theaters last Friday to dazzle au
diences with their hilarious new comedy "Fierce (fea
tures." Though this farce is not a sequel to the ISJSS
blockbuster, its winning script and polished comedic
talents combine to equal the success of the first work.
The film, written by Cleese and lain Johnstone, may
not be related to "Wanda" but is sure to challenge the
$200 million box-office generated by its bizarre but hi
larious sister flick.
The hysterics take place at a London zoo recently
acquired by magnate Rod McCain (Kevin Kline), a
crude New Zealander who is only interested in the
prospect of raking in the dough. With the intention
of increasing the zoo s annual profits, McCain sends
Rollo Lee (Cleese), a loyal but floundering ex-Hong
Kong cop, to the scene.
Determined to win the praise of his boss, Lee fig
ures the only way to increase profit is to appeal to peo
ple's inherent fascination with violence. He then pro
poses the elimination of all tame animals and de
mands that the entire population be replaced with
fierce creatures.
The ludicrous proposition doesn't go over too well
with the zookeepers, who have an unfaltering loyalty
to the park. The extremely sappy zoo crew is hilari
ous; they create a winning dynamic with their animal
loving alliance that really adds to the ridiculous
humor that drives the film.
Cleese is superb and lends his English humor to
the script and the screen with brilliance and confi
dence. His character is plagued with an impressive
amount of bad luck, and Cleese portrays the frantic

and misunderstood corporate failure with comedic
precision.
Jamie Lee Curtis plays Willa Weston, an ambi
tious businesswoman eager to climb the corporate
ladder of McCain's company, Octopus, Inc. She ar
rives for her first day, however, and is greeted by the
news that the division she's been hired for was sold
minutes earlier. Weston then begins searching for
another company project and decides on running
the Marwood Zoo.
but there's a catch. The boss' spoiled, uncouth
son, also played by Kline, insists on accompanying
the sexy executive to London. The young McCain
spends the movie pursuing Weston, attempting to
make his sex-crazed fantasies a reality, and Weston
humors the slimy beast to ensure job security. The
two create an enormously funny chain of sexual pur
suits and denials that color the film with hilarity.
Curtis plays herself in the movie, seducing the
cast and the camera, taking off her already scarce
clothing whenever possible and using every oppor
tunity to show off her patented, Jamie Lee figure. De
spite her annoying ostentation, which oftentimes
borders on embarrassing, Curtis pulls it off and no
doubt fulfills directors Robert Young and Fred
Schepisi's vision of the comedic seductress.
Kline also gives a masterful performance as both
Rod and Vince McCain, making them the guys the
audience loves to hate.
Although the humor of "Fierce Creatures" relies
on sophomoric jokes and classic sexual undertak
ings, it is a highly entertaining film that provides the
audience with two hours of fun and laughs. The film
creates an escape for the audience through a combi
nation of hilarious dialogue and a fine-tuned cast.

It's not "Wanda," but it sure is a hit
