## Laura Dern fights off abortion extremists in 'Citizen Ruth' 
### 
Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern) is not a very
good citizen.
She's had a bit of trouble with the law: The
state has taken away her four children for being
an indecent mother, she's been arrested lf>
times in the past year for sniffing spray paint
(officially called "hazardous fumes inhala
tion"), and she's been placed in five drub rehab
programs.
Not this time.
This time the judge is pissed, and as her
medical test shows that she is pregnant, the
judge has decided to charge her with a felony,
for endangering the life of her unborn fetus,
unless she "takes care" of the problem.
But perhaps Ruth's luck is changing. For
just when you thought she could get no lower
some sympathetic anti-abortionists bail her
out and take her in.
And before you know it, Miss Fucked Up
USA is caught in the middle of a moral war
— overnight she's gone from a person no one
cares about to a person everyone wants a
piece of.
The wacked-out characters fighting over

her are some of the best parts about "Citizen
Ruth" — whether they're lesus freaks or les
bian feminists, the extremism is not too far
from reality, though it's totally out of control.
Kudos are due to Dern for conquering
Ruth, the messed-up role. Unlike her annoy
ing pseudo-tough chick part in "Jurassic
Park," Ruth is a character with some serious
balls, and Dern plays her with some cajones
of her own.
All the surprises and over-the-top craziness
of "Citizen Ruth" qualify it as the comedy it's
being pitched as, but the film's not a ha-ha
funny kind of movie that makes you laugh out
loud till you cry. Instead, it's more like a subtly
sick satire that, as the plot gathers speed and
mass like a gigantic snowball, will have you
cringing and writhing in your seat by the
weirdness of it all in the end.
And it's in the end that you realize that, un
like most entertaining movies of this genre,
there's social commentary going on that tran
scends both humor and the abortion debate.
It's something about the way people manipu
late and relate to each other within highly
charged contexts, and the hypocrisy that exists
when people try to live other people's lives for
them.
