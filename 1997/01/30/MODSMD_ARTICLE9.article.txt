## America Online refunds millions 
### 
(AP) â€” Threatened with lawsuits across
the country, America Online agreed yester
day to give refunds to customers who
haven't been able to log on because of the
overwhelming demand created by AOL's flat
$19.95-a-month rate.
Customers will be offered either cash or a
month of free service. AOL had no immedi
ate estimate of how much the settlement will
cost.
However, if every member was able to get
a full refund for the two months, a highly
unlikely scenario, the agreement would cost
America Online about $320 million.
The settlement was reached with 36
state attorneys general but applies to all 8
million of AOL's customers nationwide.
Several of the states had threatened to sue
America Online unless it promised
refunds.
The nation's largest online service also
agreed to make it easier for dissatisfied cus
tomers to cancel and said it will suspend its
advertising for a month.
America Online, based in Dulles, Va., pre

viously said it was selectively giving refunds.
But it had refused to give blanket reim
bursements.
The states had complained that AOL
signed up hundreds of thousands of new cus
tomers without the means to accommodate
the heavy usage. Some computer users try
ing to get online have gotten busy signals for
hours on end.
"Under the consumer fraud laws of this
state and many other states, you can't offer
something to a subscriber and then not be
able to deliver," Illinois Attorney General
James Ryan said.
AOL chief executive Steve Case acknowl
edged that the company underestimated its
ability to handle the increased usage.
The company previously said it plans to
spend $350 million by June on new equip
ment and staff to handle the demand.
Analysts viewed the settlement as a nec
essary move by America Online to get past a
barrage of negative publicity at a time when
its online service is threatened by easy access
to the Internet.
