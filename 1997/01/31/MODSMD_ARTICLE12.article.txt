# Bomb blast rocks Vallejo, Calif, courthouse

### 
VALLEJO, Calif. (AP) - An
explosion blew a manhole-sized
crater in the wall of the Solano
County courthouse yesterday,
smashing windows and damaging
nearby buildings. It was the
region's fourth bomb-related inci
dent in a week.
"It sounded like a sonic boom,
but I knew it was a bomb because of
everything that's been happening,"

said Teena Camarillo, 33, whose
home is next to the courthouse.
The powerful device, placed
behind a wail of hedges near the
front of the courthouse, didn't pen
etrate the building when it explod
ed, and no one was injured. Still, it
shattered 22 courthouse windows
and damaged several adjacent
buildings.
Federal agents were looking for

connections between the court
house blast and two earlier bombs,
one of which blew up near several
bank ATMs, as well as a threat that
forced the evacuation of the Vallejo
courthouse.
And later yesterday morning, a
bomb threat forced officials to evac
uate the courthouse and sheriffs
of lice in nearby Fairfield. No bomb
was found after either threat.

Investigators said thick fog find
the dense hedge probably shielded
whoever planted the device at the
Solano courthouse. A wire leading
from the site across the lawn and
an adjacent street to an alley proba
bly was used to trigger the explo
sion, according to Charles Barnett,
arson and bomb supervisor for the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms office in San Francisco.
