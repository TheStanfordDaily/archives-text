# Chinese human rights violations subject of report

WASHINGTON (AP) -
China has silenced all public dis
sent through intimidation, exile,
prisons and other means, the
State Department said yester
day. Its human rights report
also alleged severe repression in
Nigeria, Cuba and Burma.
China's policy of zero toler
ance for dissent, as described in
the report, is certain to be a
major topic of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's visit to
Beijing in late February.
"The Chinese government in
1996 continued to commit
widespread and well-document
ed human rights abuses in viola
tion of internationally accepted
norms, stemming from the
authorities' intolerance of dis
sent, fear of unrest and the con
tinuing absence of laws protect
ing basic freedoms," the report
said.
Issued annually, the report
covers human rights conditions
worldwide. It concluded that dic
tatorships of the left and the
right are guilty of repression as
are, to a lesser extent, some
democracies. It found some
shortcomings in countries such
as Israel and Germany, but the
democracy with which the
report appears to deal most
harshly is India.
Briefing reporters, Asst. Sec
retary of State John Shattuck
said respect for human rights
gained globally in 1996, which
should not be overlooked.
Included, he said, are such coun
tries as Bosnia, Romania, Haiti,
Guatemala, Ghana, Liberia,
Mali and Sierra Leone.
Albright also spoke to

reporters, indicating she will
make combatting religious per
secution and intolerance a hall
mark of her tenure.
"These are plagues that, from
ancient times, have fomented
war and deep-seated resent
ment," she said. "In too mam'
countries, from Sudan to Viet
nam to Iran, this form of repres
sion persists. In a few, including
China, it has increased."
The China section of
report is certain to fuel further
debate over whether the Unitril
States should distance itsejf
from China or show its displea
sure over its human righCs
record in other ways.
Since 1994, the administra
tion has virtually ruled out link
ing U.S. trade policy with Bei
jing to human rights. I
The report said, "All public
dissent against party and gov
ernment was effectively silenced
by intimidation, exile or thne
imposition of prison terms,
administrative detention cfr
house arrest. No dissidents were
known to be active at the yearlb
end."
Albright will visit China at
the end of a nine-country toiir
encompassing Europe and other
Asian countries.
She said the U.S. relationship
with China is too important to
be "held hostage" by any one
issue. j
Making the case for contin
ued engagement with China,
Assistant Secretary Shattuck
said, "Never has the human
rights situation in China
improved by the isolation of
China. Quite the contrary."
