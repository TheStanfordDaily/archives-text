## Editor's Farewell 
### 
I DONT KNOW quite how to
sum up these last five
months as editor in chief.
I know I'm supposed to use
this final column to make some
kind of profound, earth-shatter
ing statement — perhaps spell
out my solution to achieving
world peace or ending poverty.
My predecessors certainly did an
admirable job of this, offering a
myriad of deep thoughts on such
topics as the meaning of life and
death.
But as I stare at the twilight
hours of my editorship, I find
that I'm not feeling very "deep,"
or even very coherent. It's proba
bly too many late nights and too
much fast food — a common
plight of Daily editors, I've dis
covered.
Instead, I find myself remem
bering the lessons my parents
taught me as a child. Their clich
es ring in my head: "Treat others
the way you want to be treated,"
"Always hold hands when cross
ing the street" and the most oft
heard in my house, "If at first
you don't succeed, try, try
again."
Like most parents, my mom
and dad were big supporters of
the hard-work ethic. In the
Berselli household, failure
wasn't the crime; not trying hard
enough was. From an early age I
believed that if you tried hard
enough, you could accomplish
anything.
Though some of my youthful
naivete has faded, I remain
grateful to my parents for teach
ing me the value of hard work —
both through their words and
their actions. More than any
thing else, this lesson proved
useful during my tenure as edi
tor.
Like any volume, my staff
members and I have faced many
trials and tribulations. October's
campus-wide power outage and
my news editor's car accident in
November were two such trials
that I'm sure will remain perma
nently etched in my memory.
I am incredibly proud of my
staff for persevering during
these difficult situations. It
would have been easy to give up.

It certainly would have been
understandable.
After all, in the scheme of
things, what is more important
— tomorrow's issue of The Daily
or the health of our co-worker? I
know that writing headlines and
editing stories was the absolute
last thing I felt like doing that
November evening.
And if a power outage prevent
ed us from publishing the paper
one day, who would really care?
Undoubtedly, our advertisers
would be the angriest.
But we stuck with it, and the
results speak for themselves.
To me, this refusal to give up
represents what is best about
The Daily. We may make mis
takes, but they are never the
result of not enough effort. You
may hate what is in the paper,
but please consider the hard
work that went into it.
I would urge others on campus
to remember this lesson of perse
verance. This year students have
proposed several new projects —
sorority housing and a socially
responsible investment fund,
among others.
The investment idea has
already been shot down; now it's
up to the students to follow
through on their idea. One "no"
does not mean "no" forever.
With that said, I want to sign
off by offering my sincere thanks
to each and every person who
called, wrote in or stopped by
The Daily this fall. The Daily
exists to serve the community,
and we have appreciated your
thoughts on how we can improve
in our mission. '
All in all, it has been a plea
sure learning from the communi
ty, and hopefully we have taught
you something too.
