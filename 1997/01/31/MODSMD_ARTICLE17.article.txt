## Silver; the anti-columnist 
### 
FOR MY LAST trick, I will attempt
an anti-column. What exactly is
that, you ask? An anti-column is a
column made of topics that no Daily
columnist should ever take up again. Con
sider it a no-no list, a public service
announcement to the incoming five
columnists on behalf of every Stanford
student who has ever slogged back to
Stern only to find pink fettucine and a
banal column about:
Dating
Far and away, Stanford's lack of dat
ing is its biggest cliche. Is it the women?
The men? Friends, follow this simple
algorithm: "If at first you don't succeed,
floss and try again."
Unreasonable Palo Alto prices
I come from Stockton, Calif., where
things are much cheaper than they are in
Palo Alto. Or so I thought until I com
pared the cities more closely.
Palo Alto date: Go to cafe, buy fancy
drinks, cute sandwiches and foreign
desserts. Walk outside, smile at security
guard, realize you are the most shabbily
dressed person on the street, go home.
Total cost: $30.
Stockton date: Go to diner, buy Cokes,
burgers and Goobers. Walk outside, smile
at bum, realize you are the most expen
sively dressed person on the street, get
mugged. Total cost: $40.
Career anxiety
Many believe that the "C" in CPPC
does not stand for "career," but rather
"computer," "consultant," "capitalist" or
even "catastrophe." Like many humani

ties students, I fear a coming society
where those who are not computer pro
grammers will become "content
providers," and those who neither pro
gram nor write will find jobs as "soda
providers." Best of luck, fellow seniors.
School spirit
Many do not know that Stanford, in its
infinite wisdom, has developed a group
separate from the student body whose
sole purpose it is to attend sporting
events and cheer on the Cardinal. They
are called alumni. Alumni do fun things
like attend games because they have grad
uated and can live comfortably. We stu
dents, on the other hand, are busy work
ing toward that end. This is related to the
fact that there is really only one major
offered at Stanford: Delayed Gratifica
tion. Humanities and social science stu
dents all minor in Relativism; students of
engineering and hard science minor in
Stress.
Bonfire crisis
This will take care of itself — colum
nists need not bother. I predict that angry
alumni will use their awesome financial
power to bribe a team of Nobel Prize-win
ning zoologists into testifying before the
EPA that the tiger salamander actually
"thrives in fire, the hotter the better."
Juice Club
Juice Club has been gone since sum
mer. No one has died because of it. In fact,
things are better. What we really need is a
Gin and Juice Club. Get Wais on it.
Stanford Police
Recently I drove to Carl's Jr. at mid

night, not knowing that one of my head
lights was out. In 20 minutes I was pulled
over three times. My point: Yes, Stanford
Police are extremely touchy, but so are
Palo Alto and Mountain View police offi
cers. I am told that Atherton police offi
cers actually execute motorists with miss
ing headlights. Back in Stockton,
motorists must fire at least three rounds,
preferably from an automatic weapon,
before deserving the attention of a peace
officer.
Stanford women
Some guys like to rant about how Play
boy rates Stanford men near the top of
the collegiate heap and ranks Stanford
women at the bottom. Have you seen
Playmate of the Year Jenny McCarthy on
her show, MTV's "Singled Out"? I don't
know about you, but I think she is a bitch.
The post office
Second only to dating, the post office
has clogged the columnist's box for far too
long. When I really need my mail, I
crouch outside my P.O. box and peer
inside. Right as the postal worker walks
by, I reach through the box, seize his
thigh and demand my mail. I try to grab
him right around his holster — it's safest
that way.
