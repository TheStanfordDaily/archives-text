Weisberg clarifies conditions of FRI closure

I WRITE TO clarify several com
ments made yesterday in The Daily
article "FRI closure frustrating."
The closure of the Food Research Insti
tute has been a painful disruption for
faculty and students, but hundreds of
hours and voluminous resources have
been devoted to working out transitions
for faculty and graduate students.
We have provided FRI faculty with
very extensive paid research leave and
research support for equipment, travel,
research assistants and other scholarly
support aids. These funds are portable
for faculty who leave the University.

For faculty seeking positions in
other Stanford departments, the pro
cess has been slow and complex, but
ultimately decisions on professorial
appointments are made by departmen
tal faculty and schools, not the
Provost's Office. And for senior faculty,
we have provided very generous retire
ment packages. Nevertheless, the tran
sition has been very slow for many rea
sons, including the understandable
need of individual faculty to think long
and hard and to gather advice concern
ing their futures.
Meetings were also held with FRI

doctoral students and help provided in
various forms. Six students transferred
to other programs at Stanford, and
three students transferred to doctoral
programs at other universities. Resources
were provided to fulfill original financial
aid commitments to them and, in many
cases, additional funds were allocated
to cover costs associated with these
transfers.
Similar arrangements were provided
to students who chose to complete the
FRI doctoral program. They are correct
in understanding that it will be easier
to finish their dissertations while FRI

faculty are still on campus. But there is
no University rule that will prohibit
them from receiving an FRI degree
after 1998, and we will work with them
after that date to help them with doc
toral committee arrangements and final
dissertation work.
I felt that it was important to pro
vide an additional perspective on the
considerable efforts we have made fol
lowing a very difficult decision to close
the FRI.
