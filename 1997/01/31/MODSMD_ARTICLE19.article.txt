# Grundy got casuation all wrong in God proof

### 
Garry Grundy argues in his Tuesday
column "Why I'm not an atheist" that
atheism is untenable because atheists are
supposed to believe that the universe, life
and human beings are the result of pure
chance, mere cosmic caprice. He quotes the
late Carl Sagan to the effect that "one day"
a self-replicating molecule appeared "by
accident" and then proceeds to claim that
atheism is based on a "bizarre" belief that
effects don't have causes.
Of course effects have causes. That's
why any molecule with a talent for even
clumsy self-replication will reproduce itself
infinitely better than one with no such tal
ent, why molecules that are better at self
replication will have more descendants,
why natural selection works. As far as
ghosts in the machine, Grundy is, of
course, perfectly free to postulate deities in
the sky, demons under the hood, imps in
the Internet. With the second two of these
I might sometimes concur.
Grundy's contention that atheists
"might as well kill themselves" since life
supposedly has no meaning for them is
about as absurd as the claim that the godly

should just kill themselves in order to
reach heaven, nirvana or the transdimen
sional Venusian mother ship all the faster.
Of course there is "reason in this world,"
although probably not enough of it. And
whatever reason there is, is human.
If Grundy wishes to believe in supernat
ural causes for natural effects, that is, of
course, purely his concern. But when he
trots out logic and "reality" in favor of his
angels, he should be aware of the famous
reply of a scientist when it was pointed out
that references to God were nowhere to be
found in his writing: "That is a hypothesis
of which I have no need."
