## 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
Former Sen. Bill Bradley's career has taken
him from Madison Square Garden to Capitol
Hill, and the next stop on his schedule is Stan
ford.
He will serve as a visiting professor next year
at the Institute for International Studies.
Bradley was a forward for the New York
Knicks from 1967 to 1977 and a Democratic sen
ator from New Jersey from 1978 to 1996. He will
be the institute's Payne distinguished professor
for the next academic year.
According to the institute Director Walter

Falcon, the Payne professor gives five public lec
tures over the course of the year. Falcon said he
also hopes Bradley will be available to lecture to
classes and meet with student groups.
"I expect there will be great student interest
both in him personally and in what he has to
say," Falcon said. ,
The interest will be mutual: Bradley said he is
"really looking forward " to the job and to the stu
dents. He has been associated with the Universi
ty in nonteaching capacities for 14 years.
Although the jobs involved no formal interac
tion with students, he said students impressed
on him the high "caliber of the mind at Stan
ford."

He added that he has a "great respect for the
institute and for Stanford." For the past year
Bradley has served on the institute's advisory
council.
He also has worked extensively at the
Asia / Pacific Research Center, where he and for
mer Secretary of State George Shultz chair
meetings every year of leaders from that region.
Falcon said that when working with Bradley,
he found him "both wise and articulate." He
called Bradley "exactly the kind of person whose
involvement in lIS gives our policy research its
unique quality."
He added that past Payne pro
fessors have been experts on a
wide variety of foreign policy is
sues and focused their lectures ac
cordingly.
The person currently holding
the position is James Goodby,
President Clinton's former princi
pal negotiator and special repre

sentative for nuclear security.
Goodby has still to give two of his
lectures.
Bradley said he had yet to de
cide his lecture topics, but suggest
ed general discussion of United
States' foreign policy and also the
"economic transformations"
going on here and abroad. Falcon
said he thought at least one lecture
would probably focus on "Ameri
ca's strategic choices in Asia,"
which has been Bradley's area of
specialty in his work at Stanford.
