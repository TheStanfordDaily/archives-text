# Grad student ready to dish out all the Kant you could ever want

### 
In Thursday's Daily, David De Noia
takes on Garry Grundy by appealing to
Kant's definition of knowledge. "Grundy,
please allow me to serve you up some of the
Kant you so desperately need," says De
Noia. He goes on to argue, a la Kant, that
our knowledge is only through the appear
ances we receive. "When you see, hear,

touch, feel or smell something, you do not
experience the thing itself." For a more
detailed explanation, De Noia says, please
see Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason."
Well, I have read the book in question.
In fact, I spent an entire quarter studying
Kant with four other graduate students,
an undergraduate and a professor (Philos
ophy Prof. Houston Smit, who is now
teaching in Arizona). There are several
doctrines of Kant that De Noia appeals to
which go against science. One is that
Kant's categories insisted that Euclidean
geometry is part of the way in which we
perceive objects. The use of non-Euclidean
geometry by science to describe the world
accurately is problematic, then, under
Kant, if not entirely irreconcilable.
Second, De Noia notes that Grundy did
not witness the creation of the world, thus
"his assertion that he knows the cause of
the creation of the world is wholly invalid."
I would say that this philosophical position
is consistent with Kant, who said that we
cannot know God. But I think Kant was
wrong â€” his definition of "to know" is too
narrow.
Take, for example, particle physics.
Physicists postulate the existence of
quarks and then carry out repeatable
experiments to test their hypotheses. If the
math predicts accurately the reactions,

then this is evidence that quarks exist. In
the same way, I believe Grundy's point was
that we can know God, in the sense that
He is the most reasonable explanation for
the world around us, particularly when we
consider cause and effect.
I know I have quickly raised a number
of philosophical issues without enough dis
cussion; however, this is a letter to the edi
tor. I would be happy to discuss this in
more detail with Grundy and De Noia. My
