# Lots of people at work on socially responsible investment fund
## 
### 
Articles in The Stanford Daily have
made it appear that almost all of the
impetus for the socially responsible
investment fund is coming from me and
ASSU President Bill Shen. This actually
isn't true. While we have worked hard on
this issue, Kelly Naylor wrote most of the
draft proposal, and there is a whole coali
tion of students from diverse groups
working on the campaign. We'd like to
take credit for all of the great work that's
happened — and continues to happen —
but we can't.
