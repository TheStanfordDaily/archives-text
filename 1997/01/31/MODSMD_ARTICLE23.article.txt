# Message was muddled in newspaper medium

In a recent Stanford Daily article
("Barlow Explains Technology Growth,"
Jan. 17) the quote "technology is neither
good or bad. It is how it is used that
makes a difference" was attributed to me.
This is exactly the opposite of the posi
tion I related to your reporter.
New media technologies have effects
in virtue of their form, independent of
their specific content. Forms of media
technology embed assumptions about
society and the world, and forms of media
technology engender modes of perception
in the people who are exposed to them.
These ideas underlie Marsh McLuban's
epigram: "The medium is the message."
The speaker series which we are orga

nizing through the Stanford Humanities
Center (Discourse@Networks.2ooo, for
which John Perry Barlow was the first
speaker) has among its goals an investi
gation of the effects of the Internet as a
medium and an open discussion about
how we might respond to and / or partici
pate in its evolution. We do not consider
the Internet as ethically or socially neu
tral. We consider its effects and value
worthy of reflection.
