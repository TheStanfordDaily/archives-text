# Sanskriti leaders write in support of tenure for Gupta
## 
### 
As past, current and future leaders of
Sanskriti, Stanford's South Asian Ameri
can student organization, we would like
to express our sense of dismay and dis
gust at the unfortunate and unjust denial
of tenure to Prof. Akhil Gupta of the
Anthropology Department.
As leaders who constantly call upon
and utilize the intellectual and cultural
resources and skills of a scholar such as
Gupta, we are utterly distressed at the

possibility of losing a valuable asset to
our community and the greater Stanford
community. Time and again, we call on
Gupta to speak on various topics at our
meetings and generally support our
efforts and endeavors to learn about and
celebrate our culture. Not only has he
responded willingly, he has gone out of
his way to expose us to diverse facets of
our history and identity, setting up a
South Asian lecture series to host speak
ers from around the world.
As an ethnic minority on campus, we
struggle to see our experiences legit
imized through sparse academic course
offerings in South Asian and South
Asian American studies. Gupta and his
partner Purnima Mankekar are two fac
ulty who devote considerable time and
effort to this topic. It troubles us that
the quality and quantity of his work
would be attacked on the grounds of
interdisciplinary or progressive scholar
ship.
According to Anthropology Prof.
George Collier, an experienced nd
tenured colleague of Gupta, Gupta's
work is at "the center of contemporary
anthropological research. His work, com
bining agriculture, economics and
anthropology effectively interrelates
integral factors in South Asian develop

ment. It seems unlikely that Stanford
will ever find any sort of replacement for
Gupta's diverse background and interest
in South Asia. Trained as an engineer,
Gupta has more to offer to the Anthro
pology Department than simply his back
ground on the Indian subcontinent."
As second-generation South Asian
Americans, we constantly seek and draw
upon this very type of scholarship in
order to understand and legitimize our
experiences. To denounce its place in
academia would b committing a great
injustice to a signmcant body of people
who contribute not merely academically,
but culturally, to the intellectual life of
this University.
As a minority group that exhibits
such diversity, we have a challenging
task in organizing ourselves. To foster
this, we maintain strong ties to our
countries of origin. With the help of
people like Gupta, we are able to display
our various cultures and learn about
the multiple factors that contribute to
our lives in South Asia and abroad By
the time another faculty member with
Gupta's knowledge and interest in our
community arrives at Stanford, our
progress as a community will be set
back years. Gupta is a central feature of
Sanskriti, and his loss will indeed be

detrimental.
Aside from all the educational resources
that Gupta provides us, we are also fortu
nate to have him as a role model in
academia. As a community with historical
ly little representation in social sciences,
we need scholars such as Gupta to exem
plify career options in these fields. If we are
to grow intellectually as a community, we
must have the options and reinforcements
to pursue — what are to us "nontradition
al" careers in social science academia.
As an organization, our members
spend countless hours sharing our her
itage and traditions with Stanford. For
the School of Humanities and Sciences to
undermine our efforts by dismissing a
prominent faculty member who supports
and encourages us is contrary to the Uni
versity's mission to embrace diversity.
As South Asian Americans we are com
mitted to taking ownership of the intel
lectual and cultural life of the University
and ask that you support our efforts by
granting tenure to Gupta.
