## Gymnasts face some of NCAAs best in Arizona 
### Tomoeh Murakami Staff writer 
The women's gymnastics
team is off to Arizona to join
some of the top teams in the
nation for a meet tonight at
7:30 p.m.
The Stanford squad, ranked
11th in the country, will face No.
6 Oregon State, No. 8 Arizona
and George Washington.
Coach Lisa Izzi said the Car
dinal is looking forward to a
neck-and-neck competition
against the teams, if not a win.
"Arizona and Oregon will no
doubt be fantastic," Izzi said.
"We want to go in there and hold
our own and be competitive."
Tonight's meet is the Card's
second meet on the road and the
first meet against more than one
team.
"Hopefully it won't be dis

tracting," sophomore co-captain
Amy Murakami said. "There's
going to be a lot more people,
and it's going to be harder to
concentrate."
Murakami said the team
underwent exceptionally tough
practice sessions this week and
is in good condition to take on
the tough competition.
"We are well prepared,"
Izzi said. "We did a lot more
numbers on the beam this
week."
The Cardinal members have
been "watering down" their rou
tines in the past few meets, tak
ing out moves of high difficulty
in order to be more consistent as
a team. Izzi said they will keep
this strategy for the meet
tonight.
"We are still looking for a lit
tie bit more consistency," Izzi said.
"We're not going to go all out on
difficulty." However, she added
that the team may add back triple
series moves on the beam.
Izzi focuses on the long term
when helping the gymnasts plan
their routines. She said that
though the team would welcome a
win in tonight's meet, the more
important goal is to peak at NCAA
Championships.
"We've been building week by
week, and I'm looking forward to
competing with more people," said

freshman Larissa Fontaine, who
placed first in the all-around cate
gory in the first meet of the season
against Georgia.
Fontaine will not compete on
the floor exercise due to an ankle
injury. She may also refrain from
performing on the beam, in which
case sophomore Katie Fitzpatrick
would take her spot.
Additional changes in the Cardi
nal lineup are scheduled to take
place. Junior Amy Neil, in addition
to her routine on the bars, will
compete on the beam for the first
time this season.
Co-captains junior Keri Mona
han and Murakami will be the only
two gymnasts competing in all four
events.
