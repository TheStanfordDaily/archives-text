# L.A. swim teams travel to deGuerre
## 
### Yi-Wyn Yen Contributing writer 
At about this time last year,
Stanford's Kari Edwards and
USO's Alison Fealey competed
against each other as they both
swam in the 400 individual medley
at the Stanford-USC women's
swim meet.
This year, however, sopho
mores Edwards and Fealey will
root for the same squad, as Fealey
transferred from USC this past
summer to became a Stanford
swimmer.
As a Woman of Troy, Fealey
was on the winning squad that was
the only one to beat the Cardinal
last season. "Hopefully, I'll be on
the winning team again (this year)
— the Cardinal team," Fealey said.
To be sure, the Cardinal team
will look to avenge its only loss in
61 meets starting at noon tomor
row when it battles the fourth
ranked Troy (6-0 overall).

USC's German diver Drte
Linder, an established diver who
has competed internationally,
will challenge the Cardinal div
ing team in both the 1- and 3-
meter events.
The top-ranked Stanford
women's swimming and diving
team (4-0 overall, 2-0 Pacific 10
Conference) will also face the
ninth-ranked UCLA Bruins (6-0
overall) at 1 p.m. today. Both
meets will be held at deGuerre
Pool.
Stanford coach Richard Quick
anticipates the USC meet to be
"very, very close." Last year's meet
came down to the final race, the
400-yard freestyle relay, which
USC won.
With 16 events at the USC
meet, coach Quick anticipates pen
ciling in nine first places for the
Women of Troy.
"That's not absolute, of
course," he said. But in order to
win, Quick is gambling that the
Cardinal team clinches first-place
spots in the other seven races and
consistently places second
through fourth in all other
events.
Quick said he will determine the
swimming lineup for the USC meet
play-by-play. The Cardinal strate
gy will depend on how well the
Troy team swims the butterfly and
individual medley events, its
stronghold.
The Cardinal team anticipates
that Troy standouts Kristine
Quance, a 15-time All-American
who holds six NCAA titles, and
Lindsay Benko, an Olympic Trials
finalist with NCAA titles in the
200-yard backstroke and 500-vard
freestyle, will capture a few top
spots. However, the Cardinal
team has the overall depth to win,
said Stanford senior co-captain
Michelle Jesperson.
The Cardinal team boasts one of
the "most outstanding freshman
classes in the nation," Quick said.

Members of this class will help gar
ner crucial points in a diverse
range of events, especially sprint
and butterfly.
Two-time Olympic gold medal
ist Catherine Fox is one of these
freshmen. Fox currently ranks
first in intercollegiate swimming in
three events: the 100-yard back
stroke, 100-vard freestyle and 200-
yard butterfly. Freshman Gabrielle
Rose, an Olympian from Brazil, is
ranked in the 200 freestyle, 100
butterfly and 200 individual med
ley. Jessica Amey, also a freshman,
holds a fifth-place ranking in the
100 butterfly.
Junior Amy Oberhelman,
senior Sarah Anderson and fresh
man Courtney Lischke will also
add strength in the distance
freestyle.
The tight-knit Cardinal swim
mers motivate and encourage each
other during practice and meets.
The supporting shouts of "Go!"
and "Stroke!" help strengthen and
unify the team.
"When one of us swims fast, we
feed off of each other," Jesperson
said.
"It'll comes down to who the
better team will be on Saturday —
we believe that's us," she added.
