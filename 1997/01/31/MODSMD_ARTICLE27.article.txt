# Showdown
## Women host Bears hoops 
### Ed Guzman Editorial staff 
Tonight, California head coach Marianne Stan
ley gets back to where she once belonged.
Stanley brings her Golden Bears (6-11, 2-6
Pacific 10 Conference) into Maples Pavilion for a
7:30 p.m. showdown with the third-ranked Stan
ford Cardinal (20-1, 8-0). As most Stanford fans
know, Stanley and assistant coach Amy Tucker
guided the Cardinal team to a berth in the 1996
Final Four while Tara VanDerveer was on leave.
Now, Stanley will be pacing the opposite end of
Maples' court as she tries to steal a win on the
road, something that her team has not done this
season.
"I'm really excited about" tonight's contest,
Stanley said. "We're going to go in there and make
the game competitive and play as well as we can."
While a lot of the hoopla has surrounded the
"return" of Stanley, she is not a novice at being the
visiting head coach in Maples. After 10 legendary
seasons at Old Dominion and two at Penn, Stanley
coached USC from 1989-93, squaring off against
VanDerveer nine times in all.
Following the 1993 season, Stanley asked for a
new contract that demanded the same salary and
incentives as then-Trojan head coach George Rav
eling. Athletic Director Mike Garrett turned her
down, inciting an ugly, well-publicized legal mess.
Even more discouraging was the way college
basketball turned its back on her, not even offering
her an administrative position. Whereas outlaws
like Jerry Tarkanian continued to get jobs, a suc
cessful coach with a lifetime .718 winning percent
age and three national titles sat home simply
because she stood up for what was right.
"I was supportive of her, personally," Van-
Derveer said. "I truly believe she is the Curt Flood
of women's basketball. She brought attention to a
problem that really needed to be addressed."
After resurrecting her career in two seasons on
the Farm, Stanley brought her renewed energy to
Berkeley to turn around a hibernating Bears pro
gram that went 7-20 last season and finished dead
last in the Pac-10 for the first time in its history.
The improvement has been steady, altho' gh not
spectacular, with a 4-5 nonconference mark and
wins over Arizona State and Oregon State. Stan
ley's squad has also taken its share of lumps, such
as last weekend, when it was swamped by Wash
ington State 79-53 and Washington 67-56. Cal is
led by senior forward Patrycja Czepiec, who is aver
aging a team-leading 16.9 points and nearly five
rebounds a game. Sophomore center Jennie Lean
der joins her on the front line as the only other Cal
player averaging in double figures at 10.9 points
and a team-high 8.9 boards per game.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal is going to get a much
needed boost tonight with the return of Vanessa
Nygaard. The junior forward practiced all week
with a brace on her recovering right knee but was
able to go full speed. Averaging 12.3 points and 7.5
