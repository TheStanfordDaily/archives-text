# Baseball ventures to Cal State-Fullerton
## Cardinal sluggers meet new Titan coach in tough three-game series 
### Jennifer Splansky Contributing writer 
No. 1 against No. 12, says Baseball Ameri
ca's top 25 poll. No. 9 against No. 15, says Col
legiate Baseball. Or will it simply be Fullerton's
offense against Stanford's pitching?
No outsider's predictions will matter when
the Cardinal and Titans take to the field for
this weekend's three-game series in Fullerton.
The two schools have met 48 times, each taking
home 24 victories. Both schools have perenni
ally tough teams and a successful history in the
postseason. Both teams lost an All-American
and 1996 Olympians, Stanford's A.J. Hinch
and Fullerton's Mark Kotsay. But with all this

said, who will come out on top this year?
This weekend will give both teams a good
opportunity to assess where they are at; it is a
bit of a diagnostic series, if you will.
Fullerton will be fired up after losing its sea
son opener at Cal State-Northridge 5-3 Tues
day. The young Fullerton pitching staff had a
rocky outing, allowing four solo home runs.
Though the Titan offense had 10 hits, it was
unable to capitalize on its scoring opportuni
ties.
"We need to go out and play well this week
end," said Fullerton pitching coach Dave Serra
no. "We are a new ballclub who lost a lot of key
players. We have the players, but we may be
slow out of the gates."

The Titans feature a new skipper and sever
al new faces, as Augie Garrido left after last
season to coach at Texas and was replaced by
George Horton.
Only three of Fullerton's eight position play
ers were starters last year. First baseman and
preseason third-team All-American C.J.
Ankrum (.312, 5 home runs, 60 RBI in 1996)
will be an offensive leader. Scott Hild (9-4, 4.66
ERA, 72 strikeouts in 1996) is the only pitcher
returning to the starting rotation.
Both teams' coaches predict that the Stan
ford pitching staff, considered by many as the
best in the nation, will determine the outcome
of the series.
"The key thing for us is for
(Kyle) Peterson, [Chadl Hutchin
son and [Jeff] Austin to have good
outings," Marquess said. "If this
doesn't happen, our chances of
winning aren't great."
"We need to get to their pitch
ers earlv," Serrano said. "As their

pitching goes, they go. We are an
offensive club."
Fullerton's loaded offense will
lest the Cardinal defense as well as
its pitchers. If Stanford can play
solid defense to support the pitch
ers, as it is expected to do, the Car
dinal will be hard to beat.
"We have hit well our first two
games, but it is not as constant,"
Marquess said. "Offense comes
and goes, and our consistency
must come from the pitching and
defense."
