### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
As the regular season begins
to wind down, Stanford
wrestling has focused its atten
tion on preparing for the Pacific
10 Championships, which take
place the first weekend in
March. With only five dual
meets remaining, the Cardinal

looks to improve its wrestling
steadily so that it can turn in a
peak performance at the compe
tition.
This weekend, Stanford looks
to continue building its momen
tum when it meets perennial
power Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
in Burnham Pavilion tonight at
7 p.m. and heads to San Francis
co State tomorrow to compete in

the Ail-California Invitational.
Cal Poly represents some of the
best competition in the West,
which will be a good measuring
stick for the Card's progress to
date.
"As the season begins to wind
down, we want to get ourselves
into a streak going into the Pac
-10s," said sophomore B.J.
Sanchez.

As traditionally one of the
best wrestling programs in Cali
fornia, Cal Poly will challenge
Stanford in all weight divisions.
At 158 pounds, senior Ryan
Barnes will meet Mustang David
Wells, who has been wrestling
consistently well this season. At
118 pounds, Stanford freshman


Sophomore Zach Zimmerer maintains the upper hand in a match against UC-Davis last week. The wrestling team hosts Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo tonight at 7 p.m. and travels north tomorrow for the All-California Invitational In San Francisco.
