# Cardinal wrestlers prepare for busy weekend
## 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
As the regular season begins
to wind down, Stanford
wrestling has focused its atten
tion on preparing for the Pacific
10 Championships, which take
place the first weekend in
March. With only five dual
meets remaining, the Cardinal

looks to improve its wrestling
steadily so that it can turn in a
peak performance at the compe
tition.
This weekend, Stanford looks
to continue building its momen
tum when it meets perennial
power Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
in Burnham Pavilion tonight at
7 p.m. and heads to San Francis
co State tomorrow to compete in

the Ail-California Invitational.
Cal Poly represents some of the
best competition in the West,
which will be a good measuring
stick for the Card's progress to
date.
"As the season begins to wind
down, we want to get ourselves
into a streak going into the Pac
-10s," said sophomore B.J.
Sanchez.

As traditionally one of the
best wrestling programs in Cali
fornia, Cal Poly will challenge
Stanford in all weight divisions.
At 158 pounds, senior Ryan
Barnes will meet Mustang David
Wells, who has been wrestling
consistently well this season. At
118 pounds, Stanford freshman


Sophomore Zach Zimmerer maintains the upper hand in a match against UC-Davis last week. The wrestling team hosts Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo tonight at 7 p.m. and travels north tomorrow for the All-California Invitational In San Francisco.
Rudy Ruiz will take on Cal
Poly's very physical Tyson Ron
deau, who was a place-winner in
the Las Vegas Invitational.
"Rudy has made significant
progress this season," said Stan
ford coach Chris Horpel. "I feel
he's ready to beat someone as
good as Rondeau."
At 167 pounds, it will be a
battle of team leaders. Junior
Scott Chapman, described as
"tough as nails" by teammate
Tim Kendall, will wrangle with
Mustang Jeremiah Miller. At

126, sophomore Zach Zimmerer
will have his hands full with Cal
Poly's Gale Miller, who upset
Stanford's Matt Cano twice last
year even though Cano was an
NCAA qualifier.
At 190 pounds, Cardinal
sophomore Tim Kendall will
once again get the start in place
of the injured Brian Vaniman,
who will be out for the rest of
the regular season with a broken
wrist. Because he is naturally a
177-pounder, Kendall will
undoubtedly have to contend
with a wrestler who will be big
ger than him.
"Wrestling up a weight adds
an interesting dimension to an
already challenging sport,"

Kendall said. "As the wrestling
weight increases, the style tends
to change so that it's not as
technique-oriented."
At 177 pounds, Stanford's
Jason Gladden will get the start,
while at 134 pounds Robert
Hatta will get the nod for the
Cardinal. Sanchez will meet
junior Craig Welk at 150
pounds. At 6-9 for the season,
Horpel said he feels that
Sanchez should be able to get
the win. Sophomore Beau Wein
er will hit the mat for the Card
at 142 pounds, and senior Chris
Serjak will represent Stanford in
the heavyweight division.
Horpel predicts that the Cal
Poly meet will likely be similar

to the Fresno State and Oregon
dual meets. In both of those
meets, the Card was close in
almost all of the matches, but
was only able to win two to four
matches in all.
"We've made significant
progress, but we're going to have
to be able to win the close ones if
we want to win," Horpel said. "I
feel that this team is ripe to beat
a team of Cal Poly's caliber."
Tomorrow, the Cardinal will
compete in the All-California
Invitational along with six other
teams from around California.
Traditionally a challenging tour
ney, the invitational should give
the Card another opportunity to
gain experience and test itself.
