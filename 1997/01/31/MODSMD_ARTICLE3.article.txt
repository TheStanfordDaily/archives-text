# Empty search
## Committee comes up short in hunt for Chicano studies prof 
### Therese Lee Staff writer 
The Anthropology Depart
ment's search for a Chicano stud
ies scholar to teach in the new
Program in Comparative Studies
in Race and Ethnicity ended last
quarter, failing to produce any se
rious candidates for the position.
Chicano studies is one of the
four new majors offered under the
program, which was approved by
the Faculty Senate last fall. Given
the restrictions of the academic
schedule, it is not likely that the
slot will be filled before next year.
The nature of the academic
cycle is such that most searches
commence in the fall, said
Stephen Haber, an associate dean
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences. Final candidates are
then interviewed in the winter.
"There was a relatively small
pool of candidates," said CSRE
and Chicano Studies Chair A 1 Ca
marillo. "No one candidate stood
out that the committee could en
thusiastically endorse."
At one point, the search was
narrowed down to four candi
dates. However, each of these po
tential finalists failed to make the
cut.
"It happens," Camarillo said.
"A search gets closed down for one
reason or another. Deans also
have the prerogative to close down
a search if they don't think the
pool is adequate."
A few options remain after a
search committee decides not to
make an appointment. In this
case, the search can be resurrect
ed by opening it up to other de
partments, or it could be post
poned until next fall, Camarillo
said.
The issue will be decided when
Dean of the School of Humanities
and Sciences John Shoven re
turns from his medical leave,
Haber said.
Because CSRE is an interdisci
plinary program, it does not have
the authority to hire faculty.

Scholars must be hired through
established departments.
"It's always been our hope that
a Chicano studies scholar could be
found in a social sciences depart
ment," Haber said.
CSRE courses were offered for
the first time this quarter after the
senate approved the new interdis
ciplinary program last November.
Camarillo said the new curricu
lum will not suffer as a result of
the fruitless search.
"We would have preferred to
have someone here next year, but
it's not critical," he said. "We were
not depending on the person for
any part of the course.
"But it means one fewer person
with expertise in this area that we
will be able to call on next year,"
Camarillo said.
As anticipated, this quarter ls
one mainly of organizational
value for the CSRE program.
Dozens of courses are being of
fered this quarter and next, Ca
marillo said.
Two of the core courses will be
offered in the spring, and other
courses may be accepted retroac
tively for the major as students
petition.
Undergraduates may be able to
declare CSRE as a major as soon
as the eighth or ninth week of this
quarter.
CSRE began its faculty semi
nar series last night with Assoc.
History Prof. Gordon Chang, and
plans are now under way to begin
graduate student seminars. E
mail surveys have been sent to
5,000 graduate students to gauge
interest.
The search for a new director
for the African and Afro-Ameri
can Studies Program is continu
ing. The search committee for this
position met Wednesday night
and looked over 92 potential can
didates, Camarillo said.
This position is "a very attrac
tive opportunity for people," he
added. "It is rare [for such a posi
tion | to be tied to an undergradu
ate program."
