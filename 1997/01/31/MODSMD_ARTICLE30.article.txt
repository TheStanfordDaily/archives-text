# Women's tennis visits Arizona for conference opener
## 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
Heading into the conference
opener against Arizona this
afternoon, the No. 2 Stanford
women's tennis squad has a bit
of Pacific 10 Conference
momentum — it has won 24
consecutive league matches.
The last time the Cardinal 11-
0) lost in the Pac-10 was three
seasons ago, and head coach
Frank Brennan and company
have gone on since to string
together two consecutive unde
feated Pac-10 seasons.
However, Brennan and the
rest of the Stanford squad
have their minds set on loftier
goals.
"We don't think about that
much," Brennan said. "Our
goal is to win a national cham
pionship. Pac-10 dual matches
are nice, and we take a lot of
pride in that. It's a pretty nice
streak, but it's not going to
last forever."
Brennan added that this sea
son the rest of the Pac-10 (and
the country for that matter)
could be looking at an improved
Stanford team.
"I think we have stepped it up
this year," Brennan said. "I
think the talent we have is pret
ty good. We are loaded, this is
like the old days. We are doing
drills that we couldn't do the last
three years. This is a more tal
ented, more athletic team than
we have had. We've got that
back again. I think this is the
strongest team I have ever had
No. 1 through No. 7."
The glory days Brennan
referred to were the late 1980s
when Stanford racked up six

straight NCAA titles.
For the time being, however,
the road to the title begins in the
desert with the No. 5 Wildcats
(3-0), last season's surprise
squad in the Pac-10. Led by Pac
-10 Player of the Year Vicky
Maes, Arizona shocked everyone
by finishing ahead of perennial
powerhouses UCLA and Cal in
the nation's most competitive
conference.
"They are probably as good
again this year," Brennan said.
"They've got Maes back and
most of their players back. They
are always tough to beat, and
they are always tough to beat
down there. It's going to be a
rough weekend. We will get a
good indication of how good we
99
are.
Maes, ranked No. 1 in the
nation for much of the season,
compiled a 21-2 record in dual
match play and a 44-8 record
overall last season.
Maes is followed in the Wild
cat lineup by Stephanie Sam
maritano, a second-team All-
Pac-10 selection, and Karen
Goldstein, who received honor
able mention honors from the
conference.
However, the Cardinal was
also appropriately represented
by the Pac-10. Along with Maes
on the first team were Stanford
All-Americans Ania Bleszynski
and Katie Schlukebir. Sandra
L)e Silva and Julie Scott joined
Sammaritano on the second
team as well.
While Arizona returns its top
three in Maes, Sammaritano
and Goldstein, Stanford returns
all four of its All-Americans in
addition to bringing in a phenome
nal recruiting class, highlighted by
Lilia Osterloh and Anne Kremer.
Both freshmen are recently back
from competing halfway across
the world at the Australian Open
earlier this month.
The Cardinal swept Arizona in
three contests last season, the clos
est of which came at the National
Team Indoor Championships. The
Wildcats pushed the Cardinal to
the limit, losing 5-4. Stanford took
the other two matches at home 6-
3 and in Tucson 7-2.
Brennan has every reason to
believe that this year's squad will
be even stronger.
The Cardinal will likely be with
out Osterloh's services for the
weekend — Stanford will play Ari
zona State in Tempe tomorrow —
due to a shoulder injury. Brennan
would like to see his freshman get
into doubles play but will send
senior doubles specialist Emily
Burt into action with Schlukebir if
necessary.
"We may not see Lilia in sin
gles," Brennan said. "And we may
not see Lilia with Katie in doubles.
So that will still be a question
mark even after this weekend."
The matchup at the No. 1 sin
gles match will likely pit Maes
against Schlukebir. The Cardinal
senior has beaten Maes in her
career, but Maes was 3-0 against
Stanford in dual-match play last
year.
De Silva, who competed at No.
2 singles against Loyola Mary
mount on Tuesday, got a glimpse
of Goldstein two weeks ago at the
Pac-10 Indoor Championships. De
Silva, who lost in the finals to
Schlukebir, defeated Goldstein in
the first round of the singles draw,
6-3, 7-5.
Arizona State, the Cardinal's
opponent tomorrow, is also led by
a member of last season's All-Pac
-10 team, Reka Cseresnyes.
