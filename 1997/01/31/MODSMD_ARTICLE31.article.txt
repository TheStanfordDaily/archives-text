For the past two days, students have had the chance
to display their feelings about sexual assault on an un
usual medium — a T-shirt.
The Clothesline Project, an event sponsored by the
Coalition Against Sexual Assault, gives students the
opportunity to paint T-shirts in White Plaza. The pro
ject ends today.
According to junior Noelle Stout, the project coordi
nator, students "paint a T-shirt with a representation
of what sexual violence means to them.
"We're trying to create a growing art exhibit, one
that gives a collective voice to people affected by sexual
violence," she said.
The ever-increasing collection of painted shirts in
White Plaza attested to students' varied responses to
the subject of sexual violence. Some depicted quiet col
orful scenes; others cried out with violent art. Still oth
ers made their statement with words.
"You don't have to be an artist," said Sally Baird,
Cowell Student Health Center's sexual assault preven
tion coordinator, who is helping with the project. "You

can use your fingers if you want. All we're looking for is
a good expression of your feelings about sexual as
sault."
"The shirts are supposed to reflect how people feel
about the subject, whether through abstract art, words
or pictures," Stout said. "Some are funny, and some are
artistic. There's a good mix."
One shirt made a chilling comment about contem
porary culture by depicting a black, industrial-looking
chain covering the words "Miss America." Another
shirt screamed, "Semen is not a weapon."
Volunteers were enthusiastic about the number of
students participating in the project. "There's been a
great response," Stout said. "It's interesting that we've
gotten an equal mix of men and women."
After today, the shirts will be removed from White
Plaza. The exhibit will reappear at the Women's Center
during Rape Awareness Week in the spring.
The Stanford project is part of a nationwide move
ment to promote sexual assault awareness. Similar
events have occurred in other communities and col
leges.
"Hopefully, these shirts will be thought-provoking
and raise awareness," Baird said.
