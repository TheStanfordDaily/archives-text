# Men's volleyball heads down south

This weekend the Stanford
men's volleyball team will open
its Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration season. The team leaves
this morning for matches in the
San Diego area today and Sun
day. Although the squad mem
bers know that they will be play
ing UC-San Diego this afternoon
and San Diego State on Sunday
afternoon, they know little else.
The Cardinal has some knowl
edge of UC-San Diego, as it got
to see the Tritons play briefly
during the preseason tourna
ment in Santa Barbara earlier
this month. However, Stanford
has no idea what to expect as far
as San Diego State is concerned,
as it has not seen the Aztecs play
this year.
UC-San Diego has played
three matches so far this year
within the league, two against
Hawaii and one against USC. In
the match against USC, the
team lost 3-1, and in the match
es against Hawaii, the Tritons
lost 3-0 and 3-1, respectively.
These results, as well as the
fact that UC-San Diego was 0-19
in league play last year, have
shown the Stanford players and
coaches that the Tritons are by
no means a strong team.
San Diego State does not fig
ure to be much of a challenge for
the Cardinal either. Last year,
the Aztecs finished in sixth place

in Stanford's division of the
MPSF, just one place ahead of
last-place San Diego. This year,
like UC-San Diego, San Diego
State is unranked in the nation
al coaches' poll.
UC-San Diego and San Diego
State are the only two teams in
the Cardinal's division not to be
ranked within the top 15.
Nevertheless, Stanford is
wary about its lack of informa
tion.
"Both of these teams could be
surprisingly strong," said head
coach Ruben Nieves. "This kind
of thing makes a coach nervous,
especially when the team doesn't
have a strong reputation. These
are the most important matches
of the year for us because we do
not want to lose ground to any
other teams in our conference."
While it is very doubtful that
Stanford will have any problems
with either team, it remains to
be seen whether all six of the
starters will be able to play two
solid matches. Of the starting
six, only seniors Mike Lambert
and Stewart Chong turned in
back-to-back good matches in
Columbus.
The rest of the starters strug
gled in one of the two matches and
all were, at some point, replaced
by bench players. The Cardinal
hopes it will turn in a strong
showing this weekend, getting off
to a fast start in league play as
well as getting solid play out of its
starting lineup.
