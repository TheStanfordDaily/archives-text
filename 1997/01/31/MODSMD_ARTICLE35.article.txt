The first comic strips were drawn on cave
walls by Java Man, a far-out artist with
a wild prognathic jaw. His tools were
simple — he only used a brick of mastodon
lard and a crude protractor — but he pro
duced strips that speak to our species' psychic
archetypes. His strip was titled "Mastodon
Hunt" and ran for 40 years with the exact
same format, art and crude descriptions that
appeared in the first strip. Before he was
killed during a cave-in, he left behind the lega
cy of a vision that always remained true and
consistent, and his work today serves as inspi
ration to the many unevolved cavemen that
still live in our nation's sewer systems.
There are many stories like these in the
history of cartooning: anecdotes about men
and women painstakingly transcribing their
raw spirit onto the page, experiencing the
public's complete apathy toward their work,
trying once more, failing again and finally
falling into alcoholism and working at
"Bazooka Comics" in exchange for cheap bot
tles of Rossi wine.
It's a tough life, cartooning. Or, at least, it
seems tough. I wouldn't know — I'm an out
rageously well-off Stanford student. But, as
Daddy's money narrows into a trickle, I may
very well be looking at a full inkwell, an
empty page and a 6-gallon jug of Gallo very
soon. It's not like any doors will spontaneous
ly open for me after this year's graduation.
There simply are not a lot of options for a self
designed Dookie Studies major. (I chose self
development over a cushy, boring, bourgeois
post-grad existence.) So, perhaps for survival,

I am going to have to make this cartooning
thing go the distance. This means that it's
time to start seriously ruminating about the
medium.
Cartoons are a legitimate art form, and it's
the one most "fine artists" derisively thumb
their noses at. "It's just a stupid funny page,"
says American abstract impressionist Jackson
Polyp, "but, THIS" (pulls out bloody lint
mixed with Dorito bits from pocket) "is ART!"
I agree that the lint-Dorito-blood mixture is a
profound contemporary statement of con
sumer fetishism, but I would also argue very
passionately that cartoons are a medium for
compelling, powerful art. I can hear the "fine
art" factionalists already start to crinkle and
ball up this page so that it may fit into a fancy
Italian shoe, but wait! What follows will be
more entertaining and persuasive than a 4
a.m. infomercial in which a human loses his or
her dignity to sell a product. Ah, you're back!
Dig the following argument.
First of all, cartoons, comics, strips —
whatever title you give "sequential art" — are
all, at their best, representative of a new lan
guage unto themselves. If we all studied it in
CIV, the cartoon would be defined as "an art
and literary form that deals with an arrange
ment of pictures or images and words to nar
rate a story or dramatize an idea." The car
toon's different components come together in
a myriad of combinations in order to commu
nicate with other humans — just like an
alphabet or an entire language. Nancy, Hagar
the Horrible, Family Circus, and Hi and Lois
are all complete verbal systems unto them

selves, for their artist's language and drawing
styles are idiosyncratic and distinct. "A New
Language" is what we recognize great artists
to have created. Van Gogh scraped paint all
over the canvas, indicating his inability to
clean his brush properly. Still, he created a
new language. The Sarge and Beetle Bailey's
constant bickering is it's own language, too.
Bill the Cat's spasms, Newspaper-holding Mr.
Wilson, Garfield's immobility ... the reso
nance of recognition vibrates even in our
advertise-drowned minds. OK, maybe the res
onance in Nancy is not as sublime for you (It
is for me. Look at old Nancy's by the original
artist, Ernie Bushmiller — everything is sym
metrical, beautiful.) as a Picasso, but now you
at least must acknowledge that there is more
going on in a cartoon than a cheap gag. Unless
that cartoon is a "Bazooka Joe" or "Double
Bubble" comic.
The simplest things, those unassuming lit
tle flowers ignored at the side of the road to
more roads, hold all the meaning in this life.
You'll see as things get more and more com
plicated and progressively more meaningless.
As for me, give me bread and cartoons.
