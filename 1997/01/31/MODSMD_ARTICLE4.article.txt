# Graduate community lacks organization and integration

One student called it her job. Another, his prison
sentence. Graduate school can be a time for immer
sion in a field of interest, yet some say this immersion
promotes isolation from the rest of the University.
"Many graduate students themselves have adopt
ed the idea that grad school is meant to be survived,
not enjoyed," said Susan Owen, a fourth-year doctor
al student in geophysics. "Also, there is the feeling
that only with a very large amount of effort could any
thing change. A lot of graduate students put their en
ergy into getting out rather than seeking support or
changing the status quo."
Inherent differences
Many people are quick to point out the inherent
differences between graduates and undergraduates,
who are generally more visible in campus activities.
Graduate students "vary by discipline, by interest

and by where they are in their studies," said Susan
Clement, assistant dean of graduate student affairs in
the School of Engineering. "They also cover a much
broader age range in general. They frequently come in
their late 20s, early 30s, and many of them are mar
ried."
Dean of Students Marc Wais estimated that 25 per
cent of Stanford's graduate students are married. In
addition to a difference in romantic relationships,
those between friends tend to differ.
"As an undergrad, you may have had many ac
quaintances," said James Kuffner, a fourth-year doc
toral student in computer science. Kuffner also serves
as the graduate coordinator of the Newman Catholic
community. "In grad school, you make a transition to
knowing a few people well."
Another major difference about graduate student
life is that most of their work is focused in their re
spective departments.
