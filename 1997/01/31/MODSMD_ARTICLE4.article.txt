# Graduate community lacks organization and integration

### Kelly E. Young Staff writer 
One student called it her job. Another, his prison
sentence. Graduate school can be a time for immer
sion in a field of interest, yet some say this immersion
promotes isolation from the rest of the University.
"Many graduate students themselves have adopt
ed the idea that grad school is meant to be survived,
not enjoyed," said Susan Owen, a fourth-year doctor
al student in geophysics. "Also, there is the feeling
that only with a very large amount of effort could any
thing change. A lot of graduate students put their en
ergy into getting out rather than seeking support or
changing the status quo."
Inherent differences
Many people are quick to point out the inherent
differences between graduates and undergraduates,
who are generally more visible in campus activities.
Graduate students "vary by discipline, by interest

and by where they are in their studies," said Susan
Clement, assistant dean of graduate student affairs in
the School of Engineering. "They also cover a much
broader age range in general. They frequently come in
their late 20s, early 30s, and many of them are mar
ried."
Dean of Students Marc Wais estimated that 25 per
cent of Stanford's graduate students are married. In
addition to a difference in romantic relationships,
those between friends tend to differ.
"As an undergrad, you may have had many ac
quaintances," said James Kuffner, a fourth-year doc
toral student in computer science. Kuffner also serves
as the graduate coordinator of the Newman Catholic
community. "In grad school, you make a transition to
knowing a few people well."
Another major difference about graduate student
life is that most of their work is focused in their re
spective departments.
"That's where my life is cen
tered," said Sean Mclntyre, a first
year master's student in German
studies. "Everything I know about
this campus, the people I know,
comes through the department."
However, the strength of in
tradepartmental bonds may actu
ally weaken interdepartmental
communication.
"There's no centralization.
Things are very segregated," said
Graduate Women's Network Coor
dinator Melanie Ghosh, a first
year master's student in educa
tion. "The biggest problem is com
municating between those enti
ties."
Kuffner said he feels there are
two camps of graduate students.
One group's members are working
for their degrees and have a small
group of friends within the depart
ment. Members of the other group
do not find that support in their de
partment and actively seek out
supplements to their work.
"This campus needs to catch on
to how important cross depart
ment / school communication and
support is to each and every stu
dent on campus," said Barbra Bai
ley, a third-year doctoral student
in mechanical engineering.
"How come there is so much
more effort and money spent on
undergraduate support when
there are practically equal number
of grads and undergrads?" she
asked.
Housing differences
Kuffner, who also spent his un
dergraduate years here, noted that
the undergraduate housing sys
tem facilitates social exchange
much more readily than graduate
residences.
"When you're an undergrad,
there's sort of a built-in social envi
ronment because people live in
dorms," he said. "As a graduate,
the dorms that exist don't really
have that built in.
"First of all, in undergrad
dorms, you're at least forced to go
to the dining halls to eat and walk
out of your room and down the hall
to use the restroom and the show
ers. In an apartment complex,
there's really no reason to leave,"
said Kuffner, adding that he hard
ly knew any of his neighbors while
he lived in Rains.

"Another reason why it's hard
er to build social networks is be
cause there are kitchens in the
apartments, so they cook for them
selves," he said.
While graduate students do
have the option of joining co-ops or
eating clubs, such as the Toyon
Eating Clubs, Kuffner said he
doesn't think graduate students
realize what they can do.
"Some grad students feel they
have to cook for themselves," he
said.
"It will be interesting to see how
they design those (new graduate
dorms)," Kuffner said.
However, it does not appear
that the new graduate residences
will bring much in the way of
change.
According to Director of Hous
ing Keith Guy, two new graduate
residences are currently in the
works. The Schwab Residential
Center — located behind Branner
Hall — and a newer residence in
Governor's Corner will both have
apartment-style features like sep
arate kitchens and bathrooms.
Combating the differences
Many agree that the way to
combat department and residen
tial isolation is to get involved in
University-wide activities.
"I think (the Graduate
Women's Network) is a way for
graduate women to meet women
across different disciplines and
schools," Ghosh said.
"The Graduate Women's Net
work tries to reach beyond borders
of schools and connect women on
levels they can relate to, offering
services that maybe all graduate
women need," she said.
There are actually many other
graduate-specific organizations
on campus, but most are within
the departments. Some, like the
Graduate Women's Network and
the Black Graduate Students As
sociation, make a conscious effort
to reach beyond departmental
borders. However, many students
are simply unaware of these
groups.
"I'm fairly sure things are going
on, but there seems to be no one
place to get the information, at
least none that I know of," said
Beth Scarloss, first-year master's
student in education.
Many students suggested hav
ing a University-wide orientation
for graduate students in addition
to the traditional orientation
arranged by each school.

"Freshmen have great welcom
ing activities which help bring
them into Stanford and show them
what Stanford is all about. They
know about the bands, the student
groups and meet each other," said
Tenny Chang, a second-year me
chanical engineering student.
"Grad students tend to be much
more isolated. Many still don't
know what the Co Ho is and never
will," she said. "Many have never
seen the Band or don't know what
White Plaza is. It's a whole differ
ent awareness, which isn't neces
sarily bad."
Others have recommended a
graduate student union.
"I'd be interested to see what it
would be like to have a graduate
student union — some social cen
ter where people would congregate
outside their research, classrooms
and apartments," Kuffner said. "I
think this is especially relevant for
single grad students who live off
campus who really have no social
network at all."
However, finding a place to
house such a union on campus
would be a problem.
"I think there's a real premium
for space on this campus," Wais
said.
The administration's role
Owen said the administration
needs to take the first step in mak
ing a positive change for graduate
students.
"We don't have anyone in the
administration who's charged up
about improving the quality of
graduate student life," Owen said.

"There seems to be an unspoken
acknowledgment on campus that
it's OK for graduate students to
suffer. We've had our fun as un
dergraduates, and now we're pay
ing our dues so that we can join the
faculty ranks."
However, Owen admitted that
some faculty members were sup
portive of graduate student con
cerns.
"Our goal is to make a graduate
student's experience at Stanford
as smooth as possible — to help
them navigate their way through
rules and regulations so they don't
get tripped up on that and can
focus on their work," Clement
said.
Wais insisted that the adminis
tration is tuned in to graduate con
cerns, as well as undergraduate
concerns. He said there are plans
for a mixer for graduate students
of all disciplines at the end of win
ter quarter or the beginning of
spring quarter.
He joked that it would be inter
esting to see a future lawyer and a
future doctor get together under
good terms like the mixer and not
through malpractice suits, as is
often the case.
Wais spoke at most of the grad
uate orientations. At orientations,
he said he encouraged graduate
students to be involved at Stanford
by doing things like joining an a
cappella group or going to Big
Game.
"It's a good release for them. It
makes them complete, and it en
hances their Stanford experience,"
Wais said.
One student called it her job. Another, his prison
sentence. Graduate school can be a time for immer
sion in a field of interest, yet some say this immersion
promotes isolation from the rest of the University.
"Many graduate students themselves have adopt
ed the idea that grad school is meant to be survived,
not enjoyed," said Susan Owen, a fourth-year doctor

to the traditional orientation
arranged by each school.

"Freshmen have great welcom
ing activities which help bring
them into Stanford and show them
what Stanford is all about. They
know about the bands, the student
groups and meet each other," said
Tenny Chang, a second-year me
chanical engineering student.
"Grad students tend to be much
more isolated. Many still don't
know what the Co Ho is and never
will," she said. "Many have never
seen the Band or don't know what
White Plaza is. It's a whole differ
ent awareness, which isn't neces
sarily bad."
Others have recommended a
graduate student union.
"I'd be interested to see what it
would be like to have a graduate
student union — some social cen
ter where people would congregate
outside their research, classrooms
and apartments," Kuffner said. "I
think this is especially relevant for
single grad students who live off
campus who really have no social
network at all."
However, finding a place to
house such a union on campus
would be a problem.
"I think there's a real premium
for space on this campus," Wais
said.
The administration's role
Owen said the administration
needs to take the first step in mak
ing a positive change for graduate
students.
"We don't have anyone in the
administration who's charged up
about improving the quality of
graduate student life," Owen said.

"There seems to be an unspoken
acknowledgment on campus that
it's OK for graduate students to
suffer. We've had our fun as un
dergraduates, and now we're pay
ing our dues so that we can join the
faculty ranks."
However, Owen admitted that
some faculty members were sup
portive of graduate student con
cerns.
"Our goal is to make a graduate
student's experience at Stanford
as smooth as possible — to help
them navigate their way through
rules and regulations so they don't
get tripped up on that and can
focus on their work," Clement
said.
Wais insisted that the adminis
tration is tuned in to graduate con
cerns, as well as undergraduate
concerns. He said there are plans
for a mixer for graduate students
of all disciplines at the end of win
ter quarter or the beginning of
spring quarter.
He joked that it would be inter
esting to see a future lawyer and a
future doctor get together under
good terms like the mixer and not
through malpractice suits, as is
often the case.
Wais spoke at most of the grad
uate orientations. At orientations,
he said he encouraged graduate
students to be involved at Stanford
by doing things like joining an a
cappella group or going to Big
Game.
"It's a good release for them. It
makes them complete, and it en
hances their Stanford experience,"
Wais said.
One student called it her job. Another, his prison
sentence. Graduate school can be a time for immer
sion in a field of interest, yet some say this immersion
promotes isolation from the rest of the University.
"Many graduate students themselves have adopt
ed the idea that grad school is meant to be survived,
not enjoyed," said Susan Owen, a fourth-year doctor
al student in geophysics. "Also, there is the feeling
that only with a very large amount of effort could any
thing change. A lot of graduate students put their en
ergy into getting out rather than seeking support or
changing the status quo."
Inherent differences
Many people are quick to point out the inherent
differences between graduates and undergraduates,
who are generally more visible in campus activities.
Graduate students "vary by discipline, by interest

and by where they are in their studies," said Susan
Clement, assistant dean of graduate student affairs in
the School of Engineering. "They also cover a much
broader age range in general. They frequently come in
their late 20s, early 30s, and many of them are mar
ried."
Dean of Students Marc Wais estimated that 25 per
cent of Stanford's graduate students are married. In
addition to a difference in romantic relationships,
those between friends tend to differ.
"As an undergrad, you may have had many ac
quaintances," said James Kuffner, a fourth-year doc
toral student in computer science. Kuffner also serves
as the graduate coordinator of the Newman Catholic
community. "In grad school, you make a transition to
knowing a few people well."
Another major difference about graduate student
life is that most of their work is focused in their re
spective departments.
"That's where my life is cen
tered," said Sean Mclntyre, a first
year master's student in German
studies. "Everything I know about
this campus, the people I know,
comes through the department."
However, the strength of in
tradepartmental bonds may actu
ally weaken interdepartmental
communication.
"There's no centralization.
Things are very segregated," said
Graduate Women's Network Coor
dinator Melanie Ghosh, a first
year master's student in educa
tion. "The biggest problem is com
municating between those enti
ties."
Kuffner said he feels there are
two camps of graduate students.
One group's members are working
for their degrees and have a small
group of friends within the depart
ment. Members of the other group
do not find that support in their de
partment and actively seek out
supplements to their work.
"This campus needs to catch on
to how important cross depart
ment / school communication and
support is to each and every stu
dent on campus," said Barbra Bai
ley, a third-year doctoral student
in mechanical engineering.
"How come there is so much
more effort and money spent on
undergraduate support when
there are practically equal number
of grads and undergrads?" she
asked.
Housing differences
Kuffner, who also spent his un
dergraduate years here, noted that
the undergraduate housing sys
tem facilitates social exchange
much more readily than graduate
residences.
"When you're an undergrad,
there's sort of a built-in social envi
ronment because people live in
dorms," he said. "As a graduate,
the dorms that exist don't really
have that built in.
"First of all, in undergrad
dorms, you're at least forced to go
to the dining halls to eat and walk
out of your room and down the hall
to use the restroom and the show
ers. In an apartment complex,
there's really no reason to leave,"
said Kuffner, adding that he hard
ly knew any of his neighbors while
he lived in Rains.

"Another reason why it's hard
er to build social networks is be
cause there are kitchens in the
apartments, so they cook for them
selves," he said.
While graduate students do
have the option of joining co-ops or
eating clubs, such as the Toyon
Eating Clubs, Kuffner said he
doesn't think graduate students
realize what they can do.
"Some grad students feel they
have to cook for themselves," he
said.
"It will be interesting to see how
they design those (new graduate
dorms)," Kuffner said.
However, it does not appear
that the new graduate residences
will bring much in the way of
change.
According to Director of Hous
ing Keith Guy, two new graduate
residences are currently in the
works. The Schwab Residential
Center — located behind Branner
Hall — and a newer residence in
Governor's Corner will both have
apartment-style features like sep
arate kitchens and bathrooms.
Combating the differences
Many agree that the way to
combat department and residen
tial isolation is to get involved in
University-wide activities.
"I think (the Graduate
Women's Network) is a way for
graduate women to meet women
across different disciplines and
schools," Ghosh said.
"The Graduate Women's Net
work tries to reach beyond borders
of schools and connect women on
levels they can relate to, offering
services that maybe all graduate
women need," she said.
There are actually many other
graduate-specific organizations
on campus, but most are within
the departments. Some, like the
Graduate Women's Network and
the Black Graduate Students As
sociation, make a conscious effort
to reach beyond departmental
borders. However, many students
are simply unaware of these
groups.
"I'm fairly sure things are going
on, but there seems to be no one
place to get the information, at
least none that I know of," said
Beth Scarloss, first-year master's
student in education.
Many students suggested hav
ing a University-wide orientation
for graduate students in addition
to the traditional orientation
arranged by each school.

"Freshmen have great welcom
ing activities which help bring
them into Stanford and show them
what Stanford is all about. They
know about the bands, the student
groups and meet each other," said
Tenny Chang, a second-year me
chanical engineering student.
"Grad students tend to be much
more isolated. Many still don't
know what the Co Ho is and never
will," she said. "Many have never
seen the Band or don't know what
White Plaza is. It's a whole differ
ent awareness, which isn't neces
sarily bad."
Others have recommended a
graduate student union.
"I'd be interested to see what it
would be like to have a graduate
student union — some social cen
ter where people would congregate
outside their research, classrooms
and apartments," Kuffner said. "I
think this is especially relevant for
single grad students who live off
campus who really have no social
network at all."
However, finding a place to
house such a union on campus
would be a problem.
"I think there's a real premium
for space on this campus," Wais
said.
