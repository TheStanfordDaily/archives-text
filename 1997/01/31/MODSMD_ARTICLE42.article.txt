# Filmmaker shares movie's motivation
## 
### Kori Wen Contributing writer 
Academy Award-winning film
maker Terre Nash discussed her
motivation for becoming a direc
tor at a screening last night at
Cubberley Auditorium.
Nash showed her recent docu
mentary, "Who's Counting? Mar
ilyn Waring on Sex, Lies and
Global Economics."
"While I was still in university,
I remember hearing a professor
lecture on 'doing what you can,'
and I thought, 'She was saying
this from one place, but film could
get out to more people.' " Nash's
first film, "If You Love This Plan
et," won an Academy Award for a
short documentary, despite being
denounced by the U.S. Depart
ment of Justice as political propa
ganda.
Waring, the focus of the recent
project, is a former member of
New Zealand's parliament, a uni
versity professor, a political econ
omist and author and, at present,
a goat farmer.
In the film, Waring relates the
global economy to different as
pects of life that she has witnessed
from traveling around the world.
She began with a provocative de
scription of the 1989 Exxon
Valdez tanker disaster as a boost
to the economy with the wide
spread publicity, insurance gains

and increase in volunteer partici
pation.
She combined this and other
such examples to conclude that
the current world economic sys
tem "encourages environmental
disaster ... and can eventually
kill us."
Looking at the multibillion
arms market which supports
much of the world's trade, Nash
said, "Killing people or preparing
to kill people is a very valuable
service to the economy. If a coun
try is a major exporter of arms,
then it's in that country's interest
to always have a war going on."
In contrast, she pointed out the
relative unimportance of careers
that do not involve money, such as
"reproducing life" and caring for
the household.
"In many families in the Third
World, the women are responsible
for providing for the children —
often eight or nine. . . . Many of
these children are sold eventually
into prostitution."
In conclusion, Nash urged her
audience to persist in fighting the
system, that "the only principles
are that we don't stop . . . and
most important, don't stop hav
ing fun along the way."
The evening was sponsored by
Bay Area Action, an environmen
tal action organization striving to
"strengthen our connections to
the environment."
