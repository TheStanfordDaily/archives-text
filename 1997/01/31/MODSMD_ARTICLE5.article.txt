# Asian community discusses mural at town hall meeting
## 
### Adam Kemezis Editorial staff 
A town hall meeting of the Asian-American com
munity last night focused on issues from a mural on
the wall of the community center to the tenure of
Asst. Anthropology Prof. Akhil Gupta.
The mural project was started last quarter by
artist Darryl Mar, who lives in Los Angeles but has
taught a course at Stanford. The idea, as expressed
by Asian American Activity Center Director Rick
Yuen, was to "build a stronger community through
the medium of art."
However, the mural was left unfinished at the
request of community leaders for several reasons.
The main concern, which dominated discussion
last night, was the perception by many in the com

munity that images of East Asians dominated the
mural. Another issue was whether the mural
should be the work of a single artist or a communi
ty effort.
The meeting consisted of an audience of about 25
and a panel of six. Panel members were Yuen,
Nadinne Cruz, the resident fellow of Okada; senior
Kris Hayashi, one of two students who first de
signed their own major in Asian American studies;
ASSU President Bill Shen; Aly Remtulla of Under
graduates for the Tenure of Akhil Gupta; and Brian
Chu of the Stanford Asia / Pacific Alumni Club.
Sophomore Jane Kim, chair of the Asian Ameri
can Students Association, explained that the orga
nizers of the mural had sent a "diverse" selection of
images to Mar for consideration
but that in the final plan, the im
ages used tended to be of East
Asians rather than other Asian
ethnicities.
"One of the things made clear
from the beginning was that the
mural was to be diverse," Kim
said, meaning that South and
Southeast Asians, as well as Fil
ipinos and Pacific Islanders were
to be depicted.
Yuen said painting would be
stopped at least until a communi
ty meeting on Feb. 13. He said all
options, including finishing the
current mural or beginning a
new one, remain open.
While there was a general con
cern that the mural was not in
clusive, several panelists and au

dience members cautioned
against what Raj Sheth, co-chair
of Sanskriti, a South Asian stu
dent group, called "nit-picking."
"I kind of feel that it is an
issue, but it is part of a larger
issue of community unity,"
Sheth said, adding that the
mural was not worth "ruining"
the sense of community among
Asian-American students.
Others added that the purpose
of the project was to depict the
community as a whole rather
than ensuring that every ethnici
ty was represented.
Therefore, Cruz said, the im
portant thing is to ensure that
the process of directing and fin
ishing the project is as inclusive
as possible.
Some discussion also focused
on support for Gupta, who was
refused tenure despite the unan
imous recommendation of his de
partment's tenure committee.

Many at the meeting thought
the decision cast doubt on the
University's commitment to a
new Asian American studies
major.
"They've instituted a pro
gram," Remtulla said, "but are
all their actions consistent with
what they claim is the purpose?"
Hayashi added, "It's always
going to be a battle to keep [Asian
American studies] and keep it
strong."
Other issues brought up by
the panelists included the Asian-
American community's relations
with the larger community, both
at Stanford and out of it.
Cruz, who is a student services
officer at the Haas Center for
Public Service, stressed a need to
"enlarge and increase the con
cept of community service" to in
clude "a sense of alliance with
people who struggle to see justice
done for their own people."
