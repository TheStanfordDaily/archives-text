# Lights out!
## Power outages strike campus 
### Jeanhee Hong Staff writer 
A flooded electrical manhole at the intersection
ofGaJvez Street and Campus Drive caused two brief
power outages on campus yesterday.
The buildings affected were the post office, the
Bookstore, Cummings Art Building, the Career
Planning and Placement Center, Encina Hall,
Stern Hall, Wilbur Hall, Cowell Student Health
Center and the Cowell Cluster dormitories.
The first outage occurred at 8:43 a.m. and the
second at 9:44 a.m. Each lasted about 15 minutes â€”
too short to create much of a problem but long
enough to disturb some students at work and inter
rupt operations at the post office and Bookstore.
Steve Mischissin, utilities manager in Facilities
Operations, said the flooding was caused by
groundwater.
"We've resolved the problems, and we are look
ing to (completel maintenance work on Sunday at
that manhole on Galvez," he said. "We're OK to get
to Sunday now with what we've done."
The work on Sunday will affect only the Track
House.
According to Mischissin, the outages occurred
while facilities workers attempted to isolate a trans
former. As they were trying to switch loads on the
circuits, there was a grounding problem, he said.
The post office shut down operations during
both outages.
The Bookstore remained open, using emergency
lighting on some levels and ringing up sales manu
ally with calculators.
"Fortunately, it was daylight so on the upper and
main levels there was sufficient light," said Book
store Director of Operations Ken Shark.
Several students had to wait in line at the regis
ters during the outages. According to customer
Sylvia Chen, employees had difficulty ringing up
purchases manually.
"It took a long time," she said. "It was kind of sad
to see how unprepared they were and that they had
such little training for such an emergency."
Shark said the lower level of the Bookstore was
cleared, as emergency lighting lasts for only a limit
ed time.
"I think things went reasonably smoothly," he
said.
