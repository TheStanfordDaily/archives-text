spreading, model the path of atmospheric pollution, and much more.

during peace negotiations, find promising sites for fast-growing companies,
rebuild cities around the world, support optimal land use planning, route
emergency vehicles, monitor rain forest depletion, contain oil spills, and
perform countless other vital tasks every day.
