A MESSAGE FROM PHI BETA KAPPA, STANFORD CHAPTER
Phi Beta Kappa is a nationwide society honoring students tor the excellence and breadth of their undergraduate
scholarly accomplishments. Membership in the Stanford Chapter (Beta of California) Is open to undergraduates of all
majors.
Approximately a tenth of the members of a graduating class are elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Of this number, about
one fourth are chosen in their junior year, the remainder in their senior year.
To be elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford, a student must achieve academic distinction In the major as well as
In courses across a broad range of fields. Normally, a student will not be considered to have met the breadth
standard If he or she has not satisfied all the Distribution Requirements by the time elections to the Stanford chapter
are held, early In the Spring Quarter. In its evaluation of the breadth of a student's program of study, the selection
committee looks for achievement beyond the beginning level In areas outside the major.
A grade of"+" Is not considered a sign of distinction.
The academic records of all students are automatically reviewed, so no special action is required for students
wishing to be considered for membership. Anonymity in the election process is ensured by removal of students'
names from their academic records before consideration. Students who desire that their records not be made
available for consideration by the Stanford chapter of Phi Beta Kappa should inform the Registrar, room 133, Old
Union.
