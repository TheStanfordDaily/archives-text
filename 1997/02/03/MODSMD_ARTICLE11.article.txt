ABA to consider death penalty
SAN ANTONIO (AP) — The American Bar
Association never has taken a position on the death
penalty but may be on the brink of seeking an end
to executions "unless and until greater fairness
and due process prevail."
A report by two groups within the 370,000-
lawyer organization recommended a moratori
um because "efforts to forge a fair capital pun
ishment jurisprudence have failed. Today,
administration of the death penalty lis] a hap
hazard maze of unfair practices with no internal
consistency."
The ABA's policy-making House of Delegates,
meeting at the group's national convention, will be
asked today to adopt the moratorium recommenda
tion in response to recent federal and state actions.
If accepted, it would become the focus of ABA lob
bying efforts in Congress and state legislatures.

Remembering Herb Caen
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — It was the kind of
San Francisco morning Herb Caen — who died of
lung cancer at age 80 Sturday — would have loved,
with wailing horns echoing the arrival of thick fog
through the Golden Gate.
But, to many, the wail seemed particularly
mournful on Saturday as San Franciscans, who'd
grown accustomed to Caen's daily musings in the
morning newspaper, awoke to news the Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist had died.
"As soon as I heard it, little tears welled up in
my eyes," said Will Kirkland, 53, as he sipped a
cappuccino in Caffe Roma, a North Beach cafe
Caen wrote about
NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, a longtime
friend, remembered Caen as "indefatigable," a
man who could work all day and dance all night. "I
don't think we'll see his likes again," Brokaw said.
