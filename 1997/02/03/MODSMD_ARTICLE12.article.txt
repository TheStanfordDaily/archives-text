# Budget battle set to begin

WASHINGTON (AP) - Presi
dent Clinton's budget will land on
desks this week with a command
ing thud, two days after he speaks
to the nation.
But what that sound signifies
will be for Congress to decide. And
Congress has some ideas of its own.
Clinton's budget is ultimately a
wish list, although a powerful one
made more so by the debut of the
line-item veto. Its prospects
depend on whether those wishes
are in negotiating range of Repub
lican goals.
So far both sides have struck a
conciliatory tone that contrasts
with the fur-flying that shut down
the government two budgets ago
and carried into the election.
Prudence has overtaken pas
sion, and step-by-step is seen now

as the way to go, whether on Clin
ton's efforts to improve access to
health care or the flagging GOP
push to close whole government
departments.
"I want to keep our powder dry
and want them to keep their pow
der dry," Clinton said in the lead
up to his State of the Union speech
tomorrow and the release of his
budget on Thursday.
Some Republican budget chiefs
foresee "potholes . . . not big
bombs," in the way of Clinton's
spending plans, as New Mexico
Sen. Pete Domenici, one of those
leaders, has put it.
But few doubt congressional
powers will reassert themselves,
that partisan tensions now in
check could come quickly crashing
forward and that the two parties

hold on to fundamentally compet
ing visions of government.
Republicans come to the table
with a tax-cut package roughly
double that of Clinton's $100-mil
lion, education-centered one, and
different in focus. They also want
to hold firm on welfare reforms
Clinton would partly roll back.
Still, both sides have the high
est stake in staying on course for a
balanced budget in 2002. It is Clin
ton's top priority and Republicans
want it so badly they'd amend the
Constitution to get it.
They also have narrowed the
gap on Medicare cuts, the issue
that gave the GOP migraines in
the election. Republican efforts to
rewrite the sweep of environmen
tal law and close the Education
Department are in abeyance.
