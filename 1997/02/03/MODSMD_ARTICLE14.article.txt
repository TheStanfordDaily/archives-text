## Editor's welcome 
### 
During the course of my
three years working at The
Daily, my perspective of
what the newspaper is and what
it should be has changed many
times. Now, as editor in chief for
Volume 211, I find myself
required to define that perspec
tive for our entire readership.
I walked into The Daily's office
freshman year after a summer
working as a full-time reporter for
my local newspaper. I was confi
dent of my skill, proud of my expe
rience and ready to defend myself.
I didn't see The Daily as a "real"
newspaper, and 1 didn't realize
what it could do both for me and
for the Stanford community.
Since then, The Daily has
proven itself to me. As a reporter
and editor, I have learned more
about the newspaper business,
human relations and manage
ment than I ever could have
imagined.
In the course of those experi
ences, I have had ample opportuni
ties to see how The Daily succeeds
or fails in interacting with the rest
of the Stanford community.
When we succeed, relation
ships can be gratifying. We have
helped students become aware of
the issues surrounding impor
tant curricular or administrative
changes. We have given student
politicians a forum through
which to reach out to their con
stituents. We have praised those
who do good.
But when we fail — even on a
minor detail — tempers flare,
accusations are made and people
on both sides forget the potential
that's there.
Mo§V on pampus
don't remember much about the
1994 hunger strike by Chicano
students that is commonly given
as the excuse for poor relations
between The Daily and the rest of
campus, especially the ethnic
communities. Maybe that means
it's time to accept that mistakes
were made three years ago and
move on to a more positive
future.
This fall, Daily editors and
reporters met with representa
tives of student groups and
administrative offices, outlining

our perspective and asking for
theirs.
That was a start, but it was far
from all The Daily can do to help
communicate better with the
larger campus community.
Meetings can only accomplish
so much. Their formality can pre
vent some ideas from being
expressed, and they inevitably
will fail to reach everyone. There
is no reason that meetings need
to be the end of good communica
tion between The Daily and the
campus; they should be the
beginning.
But without a formal struc
ture, the responsibility for effec
tive communication lies with
everyone out there in the larger
community. We want to know
what you like about our coverage
and what you think we're miss
ing. An open dialogue will go a
long way to helping each of us
understand the other.
The Daily office has under
standably not always seemed the
most welcoming of places. It's a
land of mass confusion and har
ried staffers. But if more people
out there braved the storm, they
might find it's worth it.
Cooperation and communica
tion will be key to making this
volume the beginning of an era of
positive relations between The
Daily and the campus. We can't
pretend we won't have problems
with each other on occasion; after
all, you don't want us to know
everything and it's our job to find
everything out.
But I'm willing and eager to
improve understanding this
spring, and I hope you'll cooper
ate with me on this endeavor.
