Revised CIV will demoralize students and faculty

THE SPECTER OF an abrupt
switch to a new Area One pro
gram — to courses that have
never been taught and which to date
have been given by their advocates not
the slightest content either intellectual
or practical — recently led me to pro
pose that we begin the move to a new
program through a pilot period.
The idea was (1) that the new ideas
the Polhemus Committee has come up
with could be tried out before the Facul
ty Senate would be asked to make them
a requirement for all Stanford fresh
men; and (2) that CIV could continue to
reform its flaws and develop its poten
tial new ideas alongside the new
track(s). At the end of some period of
experimentation and revitalization, the

senate could make a decision informed
by experience.
Since then, the Polhemus Commit
tee has managed to come up with, and
adopt, an idea that is even worse than
an abrupt switch. Now they have
decided that the Senate should go
ahead this spring to make the decision
to end CIV. The new courses would
then be phased in during a "transi
tion" period in which CIV tracks
would continue to enroll (at first near
ly all) freshmen. Sounds reasonable,
except for the following.
Imagine the CIV classroom after the
decision has been made to end CFV.
When 20 percent of the freshmen
entering next fall have been assigned to
the new and heroic courses, anointed

by the Faculty Senate as Stanford-wor
thy and no doubt highly touted to the
public, what will be the attitudes of the
80 percent of the freshmen who have
been assigned to CIV, now branded by
the Senate as unworthy of their atten
tion? Could we expect to have demoral
ized — not to say outraged — students
on our hands?
And on whose hands? Will any of
our faculty colleagues be willing to con
tinue teaching CIV as a mere place
holder while the new program gets its
act together? Could we expect demoral
ization of the faculty to match demor
alization of the students in these lame
duck courses?
The members of the faculty who cur
rently teach CIV do so on a volunteer

basis; they, like all faculty, have the
option of teaching more specialized
courses in their fields of expertise.
Given this academic freedom, will there
— once the senate has voted to kill CIV
— be the possiblity of a placeholder at
all? Or will the faculty currently teach
ing CIV give notice — as I personally
did on Friday — that they will not teach
CIV under those conditions?
Recent prose from English Prof.
Robert Polhemus' pen has made much
of his committee's support for CIV.
Good Politics Speak.
In truth, just how does the Polhemus
Committee support CIV?
As the rope supports the hanging man.
