# Returning ROTC to Stanford would endorse anti-gay regulations
## 
### 
The question of whether ROTC should
be invited back onto campus is a difficult
one for many people. ROTC scholars are a
group of hard-working students who have
a forty minute (according to Sean
Hazlett's Thursday letter) commute at an
early hour all because of Stanford's ban
on the program. Some of these ROTC
scholars come from low- or middle-class
households and so, for them, ROTC pro
vides an opportunity to attend Stanford
that, Hazlett claims, would not be finan
cially possible otherwise.
Unfortunately, ROTC policy explicitly
states that no one who is gay, lesbian or
bisexual may receive a ROTC scholar
ship. There are those who feel that the

ROTC's ban on homosexuals is wrong
and so ROTC should not be allowed at
Stanford. In response to Hazlett's letter,
I would like to make some points in
defense of keeping ROTC off campus.
In his letter, Hazlett points out that
keeping ROTC off campus will not change
the military's policy; all it does is force
Stanford students to suffer a cruel and
unusual commute. I would agree with
him that Stanford's rejection of ROTC
has not yet had a walloping impact on the
military's homophobic policy.
I doubt that the Joint Chiefs of Staff
are following this campus debate very
closely. However, there is the fact that
Stanford's own policy explicitly states
that it does not discriminate on the basis
of sexual orientation. Regardless of the
impact on the military's policy, welcom
ing in an outside organization that did
not follow one of Stanford's basic hiring
and admission policies would be an act of
blatant hypocrisy on Stanford's part.

Even if we knew that refusing to let
ROTC on campus would not budge the
military's position one nanometer, Stan
ford believes in the equal rights of gays,
bisexuals and lesbians and the Universi
ty has the responsibility to ensure these
rights on campus. And so Stanford has
to require the same fundamental non
discrimination policy from any company
or organization who wants to install
itself as part of the campus.
I also think that accepting ROTC and
its policy of excluding gays, bisexuals and
lesbians sends the wrong message to the
ROTC students themselves. With the
future in mind, Stanford should send to
those people now in ROTC, who might
some day be a military chief of staff or a
U.S. senator, this message: Non-discrim
ination policies are something we should
stand by, not just implement only in
those special cases when they are easy
policies for everyone to follow.
Realistically, the best chance the mili

tary's ban on homosexuals has for
changing is when officers and politicians
with clearer heads and more political
courage replace those presently in power.
The military's history of defending its
discriminatory policies against African
Americans and women have taught us
that the armed forces do not go gently
into the light. The persons who make the
decision to openly admit gays, lesbians
and bisexuals in the military will have to
face down a lot of anger and fear.
So when the current crop of Stan
ford students are in positions where
they can more directly affect national
policy, I want them to remember that it
is not okay to condone an indefensibly
homophobic (or sexist or racist or oth
erwise unjustly discriminatory) policy.
Inviting ROTC on campus will teach us
all ROTC scholar or not, the exact
opposite lesson.
