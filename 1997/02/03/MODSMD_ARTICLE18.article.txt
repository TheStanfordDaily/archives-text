## Doug Natelson Why graduate students finish last 
### 
I HAVEN'T taken
"Abnormal Psy
chology" since my
undergraduate days,
but even as a physics
graduate student I can
see that Stanford Uni
versity as an institu
tion suffers from mul-

tiple personality disorder.
There are at least four faces of Stan
ford: the University where undergradu
ate education is top priority; the Univer
sity where both pure and applied research
are top priority; the University as profes
sional training ground (e.g., Business,
Law and Medicine schools); the Universi
ty as fiscal creature, manifested in things
like the Stanford Fund and the Stanford
Management Co. I am only going to con
centrate on the first two.
Being a graduate student gives me
the right to be cynical, especially about
the interplay between the "top priori
ties" of undergraduate education and
research.
Certainly, the University takes
undergraduate education and life seri
ously here. Witness the hubbub over
the CIV review. Mark the number of
task forces focusing on undergraduate
issues. Note the care put into sculpting
the undergraduate curriculum and indi
vidual courses. Heck, undergraduates
pay $26,000 per year to be here; they
deserve good treatment.
Research, too, is given tremendous

attention. By being a first-rate research
university, Stanford brings in a large
percentage of the money it needs to
function through research grants. The
University's national reputation is
greatly enhanced by its research, which
in turn attracts some of the world's best
faculty. In some departments, faculty
are expected to spend at least as much
of their time on research as on teaching.
The graduate student experience, a
critical interface between these two
realms, is frequently relegated to sec
ond-class status. Certainly, individual
faculty, in general, do an outstanding
job as research advisors, in terms of
producing well-trained master's and
doctoral students. Beyond research
training, however, are other issues. The
University's attitude toward its gradu
ate students, while not hostile by any
means, is simply lukewarm.
How many hours are spent here to
make sure that graduate classes are of
the same quality as undergraduate
courses? Has there ever been a Univer
sity-wide effort to prepare academia
bound graduate students for their
future responsibilities as instructors, a
skill set at least as important as
research in today's job market?
How many University personnel
focus on issues of importance to gradu
ate students, as opposed to focusing on
Greek issues and alcohol policies? Why
did the "temporary" graduate housing
in Manzanita Park last over 25 years.

while multiple new undergraduate
dorms were built during that time?
Does the limited availability of graduate
student housing coupled with the low
graduate payscale ever enter into con
siderations of Transportation Programs
when determining parking permit
charges?
Don't get me wrong; graduate life
here is certainly better than at many
other schools. That's one reason I came
here. The central role of departments in
the graduate process, coupled with the
age difference between graduates and
undergraduates, naturally leads to a
less parental University attitude, com
pared with that shown to the under
graduate population. The last thing I'd
want would be the sudden creation of
one or more task forces whose final rec
ommendations will boldly declare that
graduate life will improve.
The point is that this University sets
exacting standards of excellence for
itself in both undergraduate life and
sponsored research. Graduate students
are critically necessary for achieving
those standards, both as instructors
and researchers.
I would encourage Stanford to
ensure that the graduate experience
here is held to a similarly high stan
dard. After all, with so many already,
what's one more "top priority"?
