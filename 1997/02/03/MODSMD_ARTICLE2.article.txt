# Post office not a hit with students

Students are displeased with mail deliv
ery at the Stanford post office, according to
the results of a recent Daily poll.
Of 197 students polled with mailboxes at
the post office, 65 of them — 33 percent —
rated the timeliness of deliveries to their
mailboxes as "poor," giving the post office a
rating of one on a scale from one (poor) to
five (excellent). Another 59 students, or 30
percent, gave the post office a two. Only 24
students — 12.2 percent — rated the time
liness of delivery as above average, giving ei
ther a four or a five.
"This confirms everything we already
knew about the post office," said ASSU
President Bill Shen. "None of it is a shock.
It is good evidence."
When asked about counter service at the
post office, students gave slightly more fa
vorable marks. Of 385 students polled, 136
students, or 35.4 percent, rated the service
as below average, giving the service either a
one or a two. A total of 153 students, or
39.7 percent, gave the service an average
three. Only 70 students, or 18.2 percent,
gave the post office an above average mark
of four or five — about half of the percent
age of students ranking service as below av
erage.
Jim Ruiz, station manager of the Stan
ford Post Office, refused to comment on the
poll results due to lease negotiations with

Stanford Management Co.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said both
counter service and inconsistent mail de
livery have been issues with a small but
vocal group of students since he arrived at
Stanford. He added the issue has been
brought up to him both in office hours and
while working on the Tresidder Advisory
Board.
"I don't know if the students (complain
ing) are . .. speaking for a silent majority,"
Wais said.
The issue of slow mail delivery has long
been a complaint of many Stanford stu
dents, according to Shen.
"The reality is that most students on
campus are appalled at two-day mail taking
four days and overnight mail taking three
days to get here," Shen said. "Getting
Christmas cards on Valentine's Day — for
most people, that is really perplexing."
However, ASSU Senator Emily Andrus
defended the post office, saying postal offi
cials are making efforts to improve service.
Andrus has had several meetings with Ruiz
and Vice Provost for Institutional Planning
Geoff Cox, and she said she understands
why the post office has problems.
"You have to realize there are like 8,000
too many post office boxes," Andrus said.
"It is very hard for them to keep up, and
there are a number of logistical problems."
Andrus also said the post office has made
