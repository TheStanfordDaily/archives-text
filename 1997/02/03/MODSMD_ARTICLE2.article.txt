# Post office not a hit with students
## 
### Jimmy Boegle Editorial staff 
Students are displeased with mail deliv
ery at the Stanford post office, according to
the results of a recent Daily poll.
Of 197 students polled with mailboxes at
the post office, 65 of them — 33 percent —
rated the timeliness of deliveries to their
mailboxes as "poor," giving the post office a
rating of one on a scale from one (poor) to
five (excellent). Another 59 students, or 30
percent, gave the post office a two. Only 24
students — 12.2 percent — rated the time
liness of delivery as above average, giving ei
ther a four or a five.
"This confirms everything we already
knew about the post office," said ASSU
President Bill Shen. "None of it is a shock.
It is good evidence."
When asked about counter service at the
post office, students gave slightly more fa
vorable marks. Of 385 students polled, 136
students, or 35.4 percent, rated the service
as below average, giving the service either a
one or a two. A total of 153 students, or
39.7 percent, gave the service an average
three. Only 70 students, or 18.2 percent,
gave the post office an above average mark
of four or five — about half of the percent
age of students ranking service as below av
erage.
Jim Ruiz, station manager of the Stan
ford Post Office, refused to comment on the
poll results due to lease negotiations with

Stanford Management Co.
Dean of Students Marc Wais said both
counter service and inconsistent mail de
livery have been issues with a small but
vocal group of students since he arrived at
Stanford. He added the issue has been
brought up to him both in office hours and
while working on the Tresidder Advisory
Board.
"I don't know if the students (complain
ing) are . .. speaking for a silent majority,"
Wais said.
The issue of slow mail delivery has long
been a complaint of many Stanford stu
dents, according to Shen.
"The reality is that most students on
campus are appalled at two-day mail taking
four days and overnight mail taking three
days to get here," Shen said. "Getting
Christmas cards on Valentine's Day — for
most people, that is really perplexing."
However, ASSU Senator Emily Andrus
defended the post office, saying postal offi
cials are making efforts to improve service.
Andrus has had several meetings with Ruiz
and Vice Provost for Institutional Planning
Geoff Cox, and she said she understands
why the post office has problems.
"You have to realize there are like 8,000
too many post office boxes," Andrus said.
"It is very hard for them to keep up, and
there are a number of logistical problems."
Andrus also said the post office has made
efforts to improve customer service
and that "it's getting a lot better."
Currently, the post office is ne
gotiating a new lease with the
management company. A 35-year
lease expired in February 1995,
and since then the post office has
been operating on a series of
monthly leases. Stanford is one of
only three colleges to have an on
campus post office in the nation.
However, with a growing stu
dent body and a post office facility
that has stayed the same size since
1960, postal officials have ex
pressed displeasure, saying a larg
er facility is needed.
Students have expressed their
displeasure with the situation
more vocally in recent years. Sev
eral protests have occurred, in
cluding one last June.
Options for improving the situ
ation have ranged from moving
the distribution facility elsewhere
and leaving the boxes in the same
place to having a private company,
such as Mail Boxes Etc. or Green-
Mail Inc. take over the space.
Shen emphasized that despite
the problems, it is crucial that
Stanford keep the post office.
"The top priority is to keep

Stanford 94309," he said. "We
can't take that for granted. The
post office could leave at any
month; that would be a night
mare. We need to keep 94309
while improving mail service.
"We can work this out if we
could sit down and find the post of
fice a better processing facility.
They're upset because it's too
small, and we're are upset because
our mail is coming late," Shen said
Andrus said her meetings with
Cox and Ruiz are ongoing, and
that they are trying to come up
with ideas for a solution to make
everyone happy.
"We're looking at all of the al
ternatives and keeping an open
mind," she said.
