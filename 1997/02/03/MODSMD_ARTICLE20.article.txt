# Victor Wishna: All in the timing
## Feel the force: the hypnotic cult of wookie wackos 
### 
ALONG TIME AGO, in a galaxy far,
far away, an idea was born. Soon it
grew into a force that its creators
could not have foreseen and could barely
control. One movie became two and then
three. The movies' characters showed up as
action figures, on cereal boxes, on lunch
boxes and at box offices around the world.
There was even that really, really bad made
for-TV spinoff starring only the Ewoks. I
hate the Ewoks.
When "Star Wars: Special Edition"
exploded into theaters this weekend, it
wasn't so much an anticipated re-release
of an old classic as an extravagant revival
of an old cult.
You see, the "Stars Wars" sect — so
powerful in the early and mid-1980s —
faced an increasing danger of seeing its
grip on society slip as time rolled on. By the
mid-19905, that insecurity reached critical
levels. An entire generation of young peo
ple — the population most susceptible to
the charms of "Star Wars" — had likely
never seen it on the big screen. Many had
not even seen it in letterbox! The time had

indeed come for the masters of 60-mm
mind control to work their industrial light
and magic once more.
I went (of course I went; anyone can be
drawn in, as we will discuss later), and I
have to admit that those luminaries down
at Lucasfilm did some nice things. I espe
cially liked the way they spliced that "Juras
sic Park" footage into the scenes at Mos Eis
ley spaceport. But the show on the screen
wasn't nearly as entertaining as the real life
fantasy going on in the theater itself. Mid
dle-aged men in white bathrobes bran
dished plastic flashlights, defending women
in earmufis from little kids in black masks.
A new generation of converts awaited its
first taste of the magic.
For those of you who don't believe the
power of the "Star Wars" cult, take a hint
from the experts. Psychologists Anthony R.
Pratkanis and Elliot Aronson, authors of
"How to Become a Cult Leader," offer some
swift tactics for group indoctrination. A
quick perusal of their basic strategies
reveals that the gurus behind "Star Wars"
know exactly what they're doing:

1. Create your own social reality.
The first step in cult formation is to assem
ble your new members in a location isolated
from the outside world — an armed com
pound in Waco, Texas, a jungle colony in
Guyana, a movie megaplex in Redwood City
— where they will see only what you want
them to see and hear only what you want
them to hear, preferably in THX.
2. Create your own social identity.
Truly devout cult members will alter their
identity to denote membership. For "Stars
Wars" fans, this could mean a well-placed
R2D2 tattoo or an e-mail address like "obi
wan (gydeathstar." Often, it is helpful for the
cult to create its own language or jargon.
Followers of Star Wars reaffirm their com
munity by addressing each other with
phrases such as "May the Force be with
you" or "Normally, I totally agree that
Sandpeople kick the Jawas' butts, but I'm
saying if they had just one AT-AT, they
could blow Greedo AND Boba Fett AND
Admiral Ackbar from Tatooine to the Dego
ba System, doncha think?"
3. Ensure obedience by establishing

a spiral of escalating commitment.
Cult members' devotion and trust can be
cultivated by extracting small commit
ments, one step at a time. Hence, sequels.
By the time "Return of the Jedi" rolls
around, compliance is complete. That whole
"Ewok celebration" scene, which inspires
abdominal discomfort in a normal viewer, is
met with complacency, even compassion by
the truly initiated.
4. Distract members from thinking
"undesirable" thoughts. Cults are
authoritarian societies based on a strict
hierarchy. Any dissent, no matter how
small, can threaten that hierarchy and the
cult's very existence. Therefore, it is impor
tant for the cult to keep its members in line.
My friend "Dan," a borderline "Star
Wars'" cult member since the age of 3, once
tempted fate by dropping a simple question
on one of the cult's many newsgroups. It
went something like this: "Why did the
Death Star go around the planet Yavin to
get to the Rebel base instead of just blowing
it up?" Unwittingly, Dan set off a thread
that would ultimately stretch to more than

30 messages over two weeks.
With one sentence, my friend appar
ently challenged the evil of the Empire,
the strength of the Death Star, the
resolve of the Rebels and the scriptwrit
ing of George Lucas — the entire canon
on which this fragile religion is based —
and the true believers let him know it.
Dan never posted again.
Anyone can be sucked in, but you don't
have to be if you know the signs. Remember
that it's only a movie, stay away from people
who introduce themselves as Bob A. Fett or
use the phrase, "as my father was before
me," and avoid that urge to sign their e
mails with "MTFBWY." You should be fine.
In other words, go pay your $7.50, see your
Special Edition and have a good time — just
remember, beware of the Dark Side.
