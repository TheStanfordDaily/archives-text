## Netters keep streak alive in Arizona 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team extended
its conference winning streak to 26 yesterday by
opening up the Pacific 10 Conference season with
wins at No. 16 Arizona State on Saturday and No. 4
Arizona on Friday.
"I thought the trip went very well," Stanford head
coach Frank Brennan said. "I was really pleased. We
didn't have everyone in the lineup and everyone at
full strength. We had to play a tough Arizona team in
the second match of the season on the road. That was
kind of scary but worked out well."
After disposing of a tough Wildcat squad 6-3 Fri
day, the Cardinal (4-0, 2-0 Pac-10 South) jumped all
over the Sun Devils on Saturday, 8-1. Stanford swept
the doubles competition and the bottom five singles
victories from Arizona State (1-1, 1-1).
In the singles competition, the Cardinal was led by
senior Sandra De Silva, junior Ania Bleszynski, junior
Julie Scott and freshman Teryn Ashley, who each
earned straight-set victories.
De Silva refused to lose in the No. 2 singles match,
eking out a 7-5 first set and making it even more excit
ing by taking the match in a second-set tie-breaker, 7-
6 (7-2).
At the No. 3 position, Arizona State's Katy Prop
stra was no match for Ail-American Bleszynski, who
cruised to victory 6-3, 6-1. Scott shook off a close first
set with Sun Devil Anna Moll to earn a 7-5, 6-3 win in
the No. 4 match.
In the No. 5 position, Ashley, winner of two titles
at the Pac-10 Indoor Championships just weeks ago,
also found little resistance from Keriy Ciardino in a
6-0, 6-3 triumph.
Just behind Ashley, another Cardinal freshman
notched a win for the Stanford squad with a three-set
victory. After dropping the first set 4-6, Anne Kremer
bounced back against Torey Pratt for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2
triumph.
Kremer competed all weekend with a muscle pull
in her stomach, which severely limited her mobility,
especially on serves and overheads.
Kremer "did a great job," Brennan said. "She could
have said she couldn't play, and I wouldn't have
played her. But she sucked it up, took one for the
team and won all four of her matches. It shows her
heart is in the right place."
The Sun Devils earned their lone point of the
match at No. 1 singles, in a match which featured two
members of last season's All-Pac-10 team. Arizona
State's Reka Cseresnyes got the best of this clash,
downing Stanford senior Katie Schlukebir in straight

sets 7-5, 6-2.
"It's tough up at No. 1," Bren
nan said. "Everybody's good up
there. There are a lot of good play
ers."
The Cardinal were without the
services of freshman Lilia Osterloh
in both singles and doubles. How
ever, senior Emily Burt filled in
ably by teaming with Schlukebir in
the No. 2 doubles match. Stan
ford's experience was too much for
Cseresnyes and Moll as the Cardi
nal rolled 8-1.
Stanford's Ail-American juniors,
Bleszynski and Scott, paired up for
an 8-4 win over Lansdorp and Prop
stra in the No. 1 match, while fresh
men Ashley and Kremer found sim
ilar 9(uccess over Pratt and Giar
dano; triumphing 8-4 as well.
The same lineup went into bat
tle against the No. 4 Wildcats on
Friday in a matchup against the
top two Pac-10 squads from a year
ago. The Cardinal, who swept Ari

zona in three matches last season,
earned a 6-3 dual-match win by
taking the bottom four singles
matches and two doubles matches.
Ashley and Kremer clinched the
win with an 8-6 win in the No. 3
doubles match, and Scott and
Bleszysnki followed with a win just
minutes later. The No. 2 doubles
contest went to Arizona after the
final verdict had been decided.
The Cardinal took a 4-2 advan
tage into the doubles match despite
losing the top two singles matches.
Wildcats Vicky Maes and Karen
Goldstein got the best of Schluke
bir and De Silva in the top two
spots, but Scott, Ashley and Kre
mer were taking care of business
on courts 4, 5 and 6.
It was Bleszysnki who pulled
out the crucial match in the No. 3
spot over Arizona's Stephanie
Sammaritano, giving the Cardinal
a 4-2 lead rather than sending the
match into doubles at three wins
apiece.
"Ania was the pivotal on Fri
day," said Brennan. "No. 1 and No.
2 singles lost rather quickly, and
Ashley won pretty quickly. But

Ania played a tough girl in Sam
maritano. They split the first two
sets and then they just had a great
third set. Ania ran eight or nine
miles in the first set, but she did all
of the things she needed to do to
win."
Despite not having Osterloh in
the lineup, Brennan was pleased to
have her on the trip with the team.
"We got Lilia into the mix,"
Brennan said. "She saw how this
works. She cheered and rooted and
screamed and got real excited. She
was there helping out and being
part of the team."
With Lilia out and Kremer
injured. Cardinal fans have yet to
see Stanford's Lineup m order at
full strength.
"We are still in transition with
the lineup," Brennan said.
The Cardinal goes out of the
conference for its next match, a
Tuesday afternoon meeting with
Fresno State. The Bulldogs recent
ly upset Pac-10 foe USC last week.
"Nobody's going to have the day
off," Brennan said. "We are going
back into war."
