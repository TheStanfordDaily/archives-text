## Netters keep streak alive in Arizona 
### Courtney Mann Senior staff writer 
The No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team extended
its conference winning streak to 26 yesterday by
opening up the Pacific 10 Conference season with
wins at No. 16 Arizona State on Saturday and No. 4
Arizona on Friday.
"I thought the trip went very well," Stanford head
coach Frank Brennan said. "I was really pleased. We
didn't have everyone in the lineup and everyone at
full strength. We had to play a tough Arizona team in
the second match of the season on the road. That was
kind of scary but worked out well."
After disposing of a tough Wildcat squad 6-3 Fri
day, the Cardinal (4-0, 2-0 Pac-10 South) jumped all
over the Sun Devils on Saturday, 8-1. Stanford swept
the doubles competition and the bottom five singles
victories from Arizona State (1-1, 1-1).
In the singles competition, the Cardinal was led by
senior Sandra De Silva, junior Ania Bleszynski, junior
Julie Scott and freshman Teryn Ashley, who each
earned straight-set victories.
De Silva refused to lose in the No. 2 singles match,
eking out a 7-5 first set and making it even more excit
ing by taking the match in a second-set tie-breaker, 7-
6 (7-2).
At the No. 3 position, Arizona State's Katy Prop
stra was no match for Ail-American Bleszynski, who
cruised to victory 6-3, 6-1. Scott shook off a close first
set with Sun Devil Anna Moll to earn a 7-5, 6-3 win in
the No. 4 match.
In the No. 5 position, Ashley, winner of two titles
at the Pac-10 Indoor Championships just weeks ago,
also found little resistance from Keriy Ciardino in a
6-0, 6-3 triumph.
Just behind Ashley, another Cardinal freshman
notched a win for the Stanford squad with a three-set
victory. After dropping the first set 4-6, Anne Kremer
bounced back against Torey Pratt for a 4-6, 6-4, 6-2
triumph.
Kremer competed all weekend with a muscle pull
in her stomach, which severely limited her mobility,
especially on serves and overheads.
Kremer "did a great job," Brennan said. "She could
have said she couldn't play, and I wouldn't have
played her. But she sucked it up, took one for the
team and won all four of her matches. It shows her
heart is in the right place."
The Sun Devils earned their lone point of the
match at No. 1 singles, in a match which featured two
members of last season's All-Pac-10 team. Arizona
State's Reka Cseresnyes got the best of this clash,
