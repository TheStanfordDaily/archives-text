# Busy weekend
## Wrestlers finish third at Cal Invite 
### John Sullivan Contributing writer 
Stanford wrestling started the
weekend on a disappointing note
by losing to an impressive Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo squad Fri
day but redeemed itself Saturday
with six place-winners and an
overall third place at the All-Cali
fornia Invitational.
The Cal Poly meet started slow
ly for the Cardinal, with the first
three matches going to the Mus
tangs. At 118 pounds, Stanford
freshman Rudy Ruiz lost 8-4 to Cal
Poly senior Tyson Rondeau, while
Cardinal sophomore Zach Zim
merer fell to senior Gail Miller 7-2.
Junior Robert Hatta kept his
match close until he got what
appeared to be a cramp in his leg
that put him on the defensive and
prevented him from keeping the
match competitive. The final score
was 20-9 in favor of the Cal Poly
grappler.
At 142 pounds, junior Beau
Weiner served up a crowd-pleaser

by defeating his opponent in over
time in a tense and well-fought
match. Although Weiner jumped
out to an early lead, he was unable
to keep his scrappy opponent from
fighting back to a 5-5 tie at the end
of regulation. However, Weiner
responded quickly in overtime by
taking down his opponent to earn
the 7-5 victory.
Stanford sophomore B.J.
Sanchez lost to junior Mustang
Craig Welk 7-2. Junior Jason Glad
den lost a heartbreaker in over
time 2-1, and Cardinal sophomore
Tim Kendall's aggressive and
scrappy style was not enough to
overcome his larger and more
experienced opponent. Kendall,
who normally wrestles at 177
pounds, moved up a weight to 190
to replace the injured senior Brian
Vaniman.
What was supposed to be the
premier matchup of the night at
167 pounds quickly turned into a
domination as junior Scott
Chapman had his way with Mus
tang team leader, Jeremiah
Miller. Chapman's superior
technique proved too much for

the brute strength of Miller.
At heavyweight, senior Chris
Serjak looked as if he had the
match under control early by
jumping out to a 2-0 lead and con
trolling action for the majority of
the first two periods. However,
Serjak was unable to squelch a late
surge of aggression from his oppo

nent and the match slipped away,
with the final 4-3 in favor of the
Mustangs.

foe. Stanford's Zimmerer looked
impressive in making it to the
finals in his weight class. In a close
ly fought final match, Zimmerer
lost but earned second place.
At 142 pounds, Stanford had
two place-winners. Sophomore
Warren McPhersen took second
while Weiner took fourth. At his
usual 177 pounds, Kendall wres
tled his way to a fourth-place fin
ish. Sophomore Doug Bardsley
took fourth at 150 pounds.
The shining moment for the
Cardinal occurred courtesy of B.J.
Sanchez, who won the 150-pound
championship. In his semifinal
match, Sanchez was able to throw
a headlock on his Fresno State
opponent which allowed him to get
the pin.
Although the weekend was not
as successful as planned, the Card
only has two dual meets next
weekend, giving them the entire
week to train and prepare.
"We have shown glimpses of
great wrestling but have to gain
consistency," Sanchez said.
"Though we have built up a lot
of confidence this season, we
still have to focus on the funda
mentals."
